Henry, hi.

00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:31,940
What are you doing here?

5
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:33,108
I was looking for Walt.

6
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:35,402
Did I miss something
while I was in prison?

7
00:01:35,403 --> 00:01:39,489
No. [chuckles] Shut up.
I was just, like, dropping by.

8
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,024
With beer?

9
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:45,237
Um...

10
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:49,249
so, do you have any idea
where he is, or...

11
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,035
If I did, I would be there
rather than here.

12
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:54,879
[Henry] Hmm.

13
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,631
What?

14
00:01:56,632 --> 00:01:58,133
[Henry] Walt's saddle's on the fence.

15
00:01:58,134 --> 00:01:59,926
He normally puts it in the barn.

16
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:01,428
So?

17
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:03,297
So that is odd. Excuse me.

18
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:09,478
Hey, it's me... Vic.

19
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,481
Um, just, uh, seeing
what you're up to and...

20
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:15,984
and I was hoping that,
um, this isn't too weird,

21
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:18,611

00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:28,037
What?

26
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:30,999
This was in his saddlebag.
It is empty.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,126
So he's out of tea.

28
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:35,545
This box used to hold Walt's wife's ashes.

29
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:37,964
The fact that the ashes
are gone is significant.

30
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:39,799
Why?

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,093
Walt once told me that he would
not scatter Martha's ashes

32
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:44,547
until he found the person who killed her.

33
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:48,258
Yeah, Miller Beck, which
we've known for months.

Henry.

35
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,193
Miller Beck stabbed her, but
David Ridges hired him to do it.

36
00:02:58,194 --> 00:02:59,735
And Ridges worked for somebody else.

37
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:01,154
Yeah, Jacob Nighthorse.

38
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:02,947
I think Walt is going after him right now.

39
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:04,991
[Vic] No, he can't be.
Nighthorse has immunity.

40
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:06,909
Walt can't arrest him.

41

He's not going to arrest him.

I'll just use this one.

I do not think this is
what Martha would want.

We'll never know.

66

If you fire that gun now,

you will kill everything that
you have ever stood for.

We have been given a second

I will not let you ruin it by

Nighthorse is gonna pay for Martha.

73
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:18,196
He will!

74
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:21,366
If you go after him the right
way, through legal means.

75
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,110
It's too late for that.

76
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:28,497
If you shoot him now, I will
be implicated as an accomplice

77
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:31,000
and I will be thrown right back in jail.

78
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:34,246
You promised me that I
would never go back there.

00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:46,982
But... you did put years
of sweat into this bar.

166
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:48,609
You know how to run it.

167
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,607
You'll still be the face of the Red
Pony, and I'll look after the finances.

168
00:10:57,994 --> 00:11:00,788
Well, if Barlow comes in, please
have him call me immediately.

169
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:01,949
It's important.

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,168
Barlow hasn't come into the office yet.

171
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:08,045
His secretary doesn't know where he is.

172
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:09,714
But that could just be her, uh,

173
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:13,001
standing instructions on
what to say if I call, so...

174
00:11:14,302 --> 00:11:17,054
- You find anything?
- No.

175
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:18,514
I checked Branch's bedroom.

176
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:20,767
Luggage in the closet.

177
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:22,727
Toothbrush by the sink is dry.

178
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:24,853
I don't think he slept here.

179
00:11:24,854 --> 00:11:27,641
- Bed's been made.
- He always makes his bed.

180
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:32,270
From what I remember.

181
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:39,903
It's warm.

182
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:43,406
Dad.

183
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:52,047
"I'm sorry. This was not
supposed to happen.

184
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:55,676
But when I look in the mirror,
I don't know who I am anymore.

185
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:57,928
I've let everybody down
and I can't fix this.

186
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:00,097
I can't undo what I've done.

187
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:02,891
Don't try to find me.
I deserve to be alone.

188
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:04,935
It's the white warrior's fault.

189
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:07,271
He made me do this.

190
00:12:07,272 --> 00:12:09,565
Forgive me."

191
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:11,818
Oh, God.

192
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:13,944
What do you think he's done?

193
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:15,863
I'll find him.

194
00:12:15,864 --> 00:12:17,865
I'll get Vic and Ferg to trace his phone.

195
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:20,660
We'll find him, okay?

196
00:12:20,661 --> 00:12:21,828
You go home.

197
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:24,413
You try and get ahold of Branch's dad.

198
00:12:24,414 --> 00:12:27,826
Try the house, try the office.

199
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,504
Maybe he'll respond to you.

200
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:32,963
Dad.

201
00:12:32,964 --> 00:12:34,666
What are you looking for?

202
00:12:35,843 --> 00:12:37,502
Nothing.

203
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,720
He's got a shotgun.

204
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:41,806
Which is exactly why you
want to put one of these on.

205
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:43,182
Never wore one. Not starting.

206
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:44,975
So, this is where the phone
company pinged his phone?

207
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:46,143
More or less.

208
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:47,978
Stop changing the subject. Put it on.

209
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:51,899
In my experience, bulletproof
vests beget bullets, so...

210
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,568
Yeah, and in my experience,
when a cop goes postal,

211
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:56,529
you want to have one of these on.

212
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,231
She's right, Sheriff.

213
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,574
We're not going with you
unless you put it on.

214
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:02,660
I don't have time to argue.

215
00:13:02,661 --> 00:13:04,404
[Vic] Oh, Jesus.

216
00:14:16,568 --> 00:14:18,937
[breathing heavily]

217
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:40,458
No.

218
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:13,241
Branch.

219
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,493
Branch.

220
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:21,624
[breathing heavily]

221
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:03,799
His, uh...

222
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,712
truck was parked about 100
yards or so down the bank.

223
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:14,727
His deputy's uniform and his hat were
in the truck along with his phone.

224
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:17,222
Box of shotgun shells in the back.

225
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:19,849
Okay.

226
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:26,564
[Vic] Should we move the body?

227
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,443
No.

228
00:16:33,454 --> 00:16:35,414
Walt, I think we know what happened here.

229
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:37,083
Doesn't matter.

230
00:16:37,084 --> 00:16:39,043
We still got to do the work.

231
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:41,370
We still got to write up the report.

232
00:16:42,714 --> 00:16:45,549
Branch Connally was a
deputy in my department.

233
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,921
He gets the same thorough investigation
that anybody else would get.

234
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:52,514
I wasn't suggesting that we don't...

235
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:58,145
I want to know every detail about
every minute of his last days.

236
00:16:58,146 --> 00:17:00,389
Every minute I didn't get to him.

237
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:04,777
Determining time of death is gonna
be hard because of the cold water.

238
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:06,271
I don't care.

239
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:09,941
We're gonna try.

240
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:16,364
I ignored everything,
everything leading up to this.

241
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:20,076
I'm not gonna ignore anything now.

242
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,125
Need me to take pictures of the body?

243
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:29,676
No.

244
00:17:29,677 --> 00:17:31,796
Give me the camera.

245
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:37,551
I'll do it.

246
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,226
Vic, you...

247
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:49,605
You got any of those rubber gloves?

248
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:53,283
What?

249
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:56,570
Just never seen you use gloves before.

250
00:17:58,915 --> 00:18:00,574
Well...

251
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,288
I've never lost a deputy before.

252
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:14,847
I'm gonna go back through Branch's
truck a bit more carefully,

253
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:18,976
see if the shotgun shells match,
check the call log on his cellphone.

254
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:24,023
After that, head over to his house,
take a look with fresh eyes.

255
00:18:24,024 --> 00:18:26,733
I was... I was there earlier, but I...

256
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:28,602
Yeah. Of course.

257
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:36,652
So, who's gonna tell Cady?

258
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:46,586
[engine shuts off]

259
00:18:46,587 --> 00:18:50,666
[breathes deeply]

260
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:56,089
Cady, I'm sorry.

261
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,633
It's Branch.

262
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,304
[breathes deeply]

263
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:06,682
We found Branch.

264
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:10,228
It's not good.

265
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:14,648
Oh, shit.

266
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:28,461
[Cady] Hey. I thought I heard you pull up.

267
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:30,998
What happened? What's going on?

268
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:34,168
Ferg, what happened?

269
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,464
Is he okay?

270
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:43,261
He... He's... [clears throat]

271
00:19:44,604 --> 00:19:46,555
He's dead, isn't he?

272
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:49,816
[Ferg] He committed...

273
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,777
[clears throat]

274
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:53,771
He killed himself.

275
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:00,569
[crying] I'm so sorry, Cady.

276
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:20,714
Truth is that the Branch that we
knew was gone a long time ago.

277
00:20:26,437 --> 00:20:28,889
I know this wasn't easy on you, Ferg.

278
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:32,268
I'm glad you were the one to tell me.

279
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:36,063
I was the last one to see him alive.

280
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,195
I had to go get the keys to his squad car.

281
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:51,253
[Cady] Just doing your job.

282
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:55,966
I mean, he knew... He knew that.
You were always a good friend.

283
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:57,835
No, I wasn't.

284
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:02,715
I was jealous.

285
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:07,978
And I wished for bad
things to happen to him.

286
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:10,557
Now it just seems so stupid.

287
00:21:15,028 --> 00:21:17,605
[sighs]

288
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:22,109
It's okay.

289
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:24,904
It's okay, Ferg.

290
00:21:26,497 --> 00:21:28,199
It's okay.

291
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:43,256
[Walt] 196.

292
00:21:44,265 --> 00:21:45,724
Okay, that's it.

293
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:47,976
- Out, Walt.
- What?

294
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:51,063
Look, I said you could sit there as
long as you kept your mouth shut.

295
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:53,315
- Sorry. I will.
- No, you won't.

296
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:56,436
I-I don't blame you,
but it rattles my nerves.

297
00:21:57,111 --> 00:21:58,987
Well, I need to know what happened.

298
00:21:58,988 --> 00:22:00,113
I told you.

299
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:03,367
Birdshot to the head at
extremely close range.

300
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:05,369
I found wadding from a
shotgun shell in the wound

301
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:10,707
and, as you have so rigorously
pointed out, 196 pieces of shot.

302
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,626
All consistent with a
self-inflicted gunshot.

303
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:15,003
Suicide.

304
00:22:15,004 --> 00:22:16,588
You sure?

305
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:18,048
Consistent with suicide.

306
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,717
I mean, I have more work to do
before I can confirm anything,

307
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:24,930
and all due respect, Walt, I had
planned on doing that work alone.

308
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:26,056
I need to run a couple more tests

309
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:28,558
before I can release the body
to the family, so if you can...

310
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,394
You can take your time, Doc.

311
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:32,479
I haven't found the family yet.

312
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,647
And I still need them
to I.D. the body, so...

313
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:38,735
Well, Walt, we know who it is.
I mean, I gave him that scar.

314
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:41,280
Well, technically, I guess
we gave him that scar.

315
00:22:41,281 --> 00:22:43,399
You're not releasing him
till I find the family.

316
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:46,193
Okay.

317
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:51,240
[sighs]

318
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,620
[mid-tempo music playing]

319
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:00,340
[Henry] You do know we serve food here.

320
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:02,335
[Walt] I'm not hungry.

321
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:09,182
How are you doing?

322
00:23:09,183 --> 00:23:13,645
Well... checked three shells,

323
00:23:13,646 --> 00:23:19,025
all from the box of number 4 game
loads that Branch had in his truck.

324
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:21,903
All came out to the exact
same pellet count.

325
00:23:21,904 --> 00:23:23,696
Not one anomaly.

326
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:25,657
I meant how are you doing?

327
00:23:25,658 --> 00:23:28,319
Better than Branch.

328
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:36,243
Walt, I know what it feels like
to have a death weigh on you.

329
00:23:37,628 --> 00:23:39,963
I think about Hector every day.

330
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:41,298
I wonder if there is anything I can...

331
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:43,167
Six pellets are missing.

332
00:23:43,676 --> 00:23:45,677
All these shells have 202.

333
00:23:45,678 --> 00:23:49,382
Branch's head wound only had 196, so...

334
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:51,724
Six pellets are missing.

335
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:53,310
Probably washed away in the river.

336
00:23:53,311 --> 00:23:55,304
And this proves what?

337
00:23:57,648 --> 00:24:01,477
Are you trying to turn this suicide
into a murder to ease your conscience?

338
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,570
Or is this so you have another reason

339
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:06,566
to go after Nighthorse as
the most likely suspect?

340
00:25:13,266 --> 00:25:15,884
[Ruby over radio]
Walt, I got Vic for you.

341
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:20,397
Go ahead.

342
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:22,649
[Vic] So, I'm at Branch's house.

343
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,568
And I found some business cards.

344
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:26,736
Branch started working for his dad.

345
00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:28,196
[Walt] Doing what?

346
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:30,740
Vice Presidenting.

347
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:34,327
You find out, uh,
anything about the, um...

348
00:25:34,328 --> 00:25:37,205
Well, you saw the note on the computer.

349
00:25:37,206 --> 00:25:39,082
But I also found a bunch
of pills in a drawer

350
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,418
that I recognize from a
case a few months back.

351
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:43,211
He stole them from evidence?

352
00:25:43,212 --> 00:25:45,088
Yeah, looks like it.

353
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:47,257
So, he was self-medicating.

354
00:25:47,258 --> 00:25:50,969
Left a self-loathing note.
We've both seen this before.

355
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:54,139
I know we don't want to admit
it, but it looks like suicide.

356
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,602
Walt, listen, I... I know that you're gonna
try and take responsibility for this,

357
00:25:58,603 --> 00:26:00,395
but you didn't even fire him.

358
00:26:00,396 --> 00:26:02,772
After everything that he did,
you only suspended him.

359
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:04,816
I'm the one that he was mad at.

360
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:08,736
I'm the one that he had an
entire file of research on.

361
00:26:08,737 --> 00:26:09,862
[cell phone chimes]

362
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:12,191
If he blamed anyone, it was me, okay?

363
00:26:12,783 --> 00:26:15,702
So, what do you think that he
meant by "I can't fix this"?

364
00:26:15,703 --> 00:26:17,745
Do you think he was talking
about us and the job,

365
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:19,747
or do you think he did something else?

366
00:26:19,748 --> 00:26:21,784
[Walt] Vic, I got to go.

367

[Barlow] Mother Superior says,
"Well, Monsignor, it's usually $150,

368
00:26:49,153 --> 00:26:51,946
but with the clerical
discount, it'll be $75."

[laughter]

370
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:57,910
Now, there's a PG-13 version
of that story for the family,

371
00:26:57,911 --> 00:26:59,829
but it's not half as funny.

372
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,782
[laughter]

373
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,000
Oh.

374
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:06,127
Gentlemen, if this is
your idea of a stripper,

375
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:08,213
I'm gonna have to kick all your asses.

376
00:27:08,214 --> 00:27:10,374
- [laughter]
- It wasn't me.

00:27:11,718 --> 00:27:13,510
Barlow, I need a word.

378
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:14,678
This is a private dinner.

379
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:16,722
If you need to talk to
me, you call my office,

380
00:27:16,723 --> 00:27:18,515
and we'll get you put on my calendar.

381
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:20,183
[Walt] I tried that.

382
00:27:20,184 --> 00:27:22,268
And my secretary told you I was here?

383
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:24,521
- I'm gonna have to fire her.
- [laughter]

384
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:26,398
You told me you were here.

I... Oh.

386
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:31,361
I am way too buzzed to
play Sherlock Holmes.

387
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:34,740
Whatever it is you came to say,
you just go ahead and say it.

388
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:38,159
Really, Barlow, please.
This... This needs to be in private.

389
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,656
Sheriff, anything you got to say to me you
can say in front of my partners-to-be.

390
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,499
It's Branch.

391
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,584
Yeah, I know. He's late.

392
00:27:45,585 --> 00:27:47,335
It's not the first time.

393
00:27:47,336 --> 00:27:49,504
He's not coming.

394
00:27:49,505 --> 00:27:51,624
Why in the hell not?

Branch is dead.

00:28:19,034 --> 00:28:21,361
He's been shot.

399
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:25,957
I found him.

400
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:27,083
He had his phone on him.

401
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:28,752
That's...

402
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:30,704
how I knew to come here.

403
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:35,793
But he...

404
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:43,050
Who?

405
00:28:46,312 --> 00:28:48,104
Who shot him?

406
00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:54,353
Well, it looks, um... self-inflicted.

407
00:28:55,738 --> 00:28:57,564
No.

408
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:01,193
No. No, no, no, no.

409
00:29:02,495 --> 00:29:03,821
No.

410
00:29:05,832 --> 00:29:07,282
No!

411
00:29:18,886 --> 00:29:20,754
He's my son.

412
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:26,969
He's my son.

413
00:29:29,938 --> 00:29:32,099
My only son.

[boy] Dear Hector, if you are not
dead, will you please help me?

421
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,949
Sometimes my uncle drinks too much,

422
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,701
and then he gets really
angry and he hits my mom.

423
00:31:48,702 --> 00:31:52,580
I'm not big enough to make
him stop, but you are.

424
00:31:52,581 --> 00:31:56,709
[woman] Hector, every day my son comes
home from school beaten to a pulp.

425
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,962
I tell him to fight back, but he refuses.

426
00:31:58,963 --> 00:32:01,881
Please help my son
find the fighter within.

427
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:04,300
[man] Hector, all the money
I've been saving is gone.

428
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:06,344
I've been working every day
since I was 13 trying to save.

429
00:32:06,345 --> 00:32:08,054
[woman 2] I just had a beautiful baby girl.

430
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:10,682
When my boyfriend saw her,
he knew she wasn't his.

431
00:32:10,683 --> 00:32:12,350
[man 2] Please, justice for my wife,

432
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:13,935
who was mugged getting off
her shift at the hospital.

433
00:32:13,936 --> 00:32:16,855
[boy 2] Hector, you're the only one who
knows how scared I am to go to school.

434
00:32:16,856 --> 00:32:18,690
[woman 3] He can hit me all he
wants, but if he touches...

435
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:21,526
[woman 4] My son is missing, and I
know it's my ex-husband who has him.

00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:47,520
[Vic] The river already did that.

446
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,317
[Walt] You okay?

447
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,321
[Vic] I did it again.

448
00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:58,031
What?

449
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:03,954
Another man is dead because of me.

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,798
I'm toxic.

451
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,838
You should just stay away from
me 'cause I'm bad for people.

00:34:13,847 --> 00:34:16,800
And really bad for possums.

453
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:19,226
Or is it opossum?

454
00:34:19,227 --> 00:34:21,437
Possum, opossum.

455
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:23,815
I don't even know.

456
00:34:23,816 --> 00:34:26,059
Doesn't matter. He's dead.

457
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,944
Vic, that's...

458
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:33,158
Did you know that I came
to Wyoming to start over?

459
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,078
Like, I-I left Philly to get
away from all of that shit.

460
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,665
But you can't... Can't start over.

461
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:42,083
There are no second chances.

462
00:34:42,084 --> 00:34:46,462
Your shit just follows
you everywhere you go,

463
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:51,467
and you just keep making the same
goddamn mistakes over and over again.

464
00:34:51,468 --> 00:34:53,552
Maybe...

465
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:57,799
Maybe the point is to keep trying.

466
00:34:58,308 --> 00:35:02,061
Maybe getting it right just
one time is good enough.

467
00:35:02,062 --> 00:35:04,396
- Come on. Let's get you out of here.
- Oh.

468
00:35:04,397 --> 00:35:06,858
[chuckles]

469
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:12,822
Did you know that my dad used
to call me "The Terror"?

470
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:14,157
He's right.

471
00:35:14,158 --> 00:35:15,616
You know, I'm... I am the terror

472
00:35:15,617 --> 00:35:19,453
because everyone who gets too close
to me either dies or they leave.

473
00:35:19,454 --> 00:35:21,455
So, you know... Don't you touch me!

474
00:35:21,456 --> 00:35:23,415
Uh! [screams]

475
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:25,744
[breathing heavily]

476
00:35:26,545 --> 00:35:27,670
No.

477
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:31,458
- Come on.
- No. No.

478
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:33,843
Fine.

479
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:36,338
Gonna be fine.

480
00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:42,719
[knock on door]

481
00:35:45,313 --> 00:35:47,523
Did my dad send you?

482
00:35:47,524 --> 00:35:48,892
I sent me.

483
00:35:49,735 --> 00:35:51,944
I made you waffles.

484
00:35:51,945 --> 00:35:54,398
Food eases sorrow.

485
00:35:54,948 --> 00:35:56,908
Have you even spoken to your dad?

486
00:35:56,909 --> 00:35:58,526
No.

487
00:35:59,452 --> 00:36:00,745
Have you?

488
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:02,454
Yes.

489
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:05,291
Or should I say I talked at him.

490
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:07,877
[silverware clatters]

491
00:36:07,878 --> 00:36:13,292
Branch's death has him
immersed in his work.

492
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:17,511
It's okay. I... need time
to be with my own thoughts.

493
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:20,424
I have been thinking about Branch, too.

494
00:36:21,641 --> 00:36:23,802
How much he helped me.

495
00:36:24,978 --> 00:36:27,855
I would like to return his bail money.

496
00:36:27,856 --> 00:36:30,775
Henry, you don't have that kind of money.

497
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:32,985
And besides, I don't think
it matters much to him now.

498
00:36:32,986 --> 00:36:36,189
My freedom cost a lot of people.

499
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:42,245
I would at least like to return the
legal defense money that was donated.

500
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:44,747
Do you have records of who
contributed and how much?

501
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:48,660
Not really. It was kind
of a pass-the-hat thing.

502
00:36:50,254 --> 00:36:53,505
But I have copies of all the
affidavits that people wrote for you.

503
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:57,135
That should be close to a complete
list of the people who donated.

504
00:36:57,136 --> 00:36:59,345
I have those files. I'll get them.

505
00:36:59,346 --> 00:37:01,472
No.

506
00:37:01,473 --> 00:37:03,008
They can wait.

507
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:06,261
Eat.

508
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:25,738
You know the hardest part?

509
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:34,622
Realizing how little I feel about
someone who once meant so much to me.

510
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:43,340
[sighs]

511
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:48,636
[groans]

512
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:13,328
If you're looking for your possum, I
buried him by that tree over there.

513
00:38:15,172 --> 00:38:17,290
Isn't the water cold?

514
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,543
Yep.

515
00:38:20,886 --> 00:38:23,296
What are you doing?

516
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:29,643
Looking for the missing birdshot from
the shotgun shell that killed Branch.

517
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:33,640
Planning on dredging the
entire river or just...

518
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:38,777
Hey, Walt, what's this gonna prove?

519
00:38:38,778 --> 00:38:40,522
Don't know yet.

520
00:38:41,865 --> 00:38:45,034
Yeah, I think you do.

521
00:38:45,035 --> 00:38:47,703
If you find the pellets, it just
proves what we already know.

522
00:38:47,704 --> 00:38:50,789
If you don't find them, it just
means that they're buried by mud

523
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,167
or they were carried
away by the stream or...

524
00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:57,163
If it was me instead of him, I'd
hope you'd do the same thing.

525
00:39:00,384 --> 00:39:02,710
Do you know who you sound like?

526
00:39:03,387 --> 00:39:04,754
Look at you.

527
00:39:05,931 --> 00:39:07,598
You've been up all night, and...

528
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,561
And you're planning on panning an
entire river for a couple of BBS.

529
00:39:12,562 --> 00:39:15,689
It's like Branch's obsessive
behavior was contagious.

530
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,691
I missed something, Vic.

531
00:39:17,692 --> 00:39:20,228
I didn't pay close enough attention.

532
00:39:20,904 --> 00:39:23,406
I didn't see how bad things
had gotten for Branch.

533
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:25,866
You have got to stop
blaming yourself for this.

534
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:28,035
It's too late.

535
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:31,205
I'm not gonna miss anything more.

536
00:39:31,206 --> 00:39:33,458
If I find the rest of the birdshot,

537
00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:37,586
maybe this'll all make more sense
to me than it does right now.

538
00:39:37,587 --> 00:39:42,292
And if I don't, at least I'll know
it wasn't through lack of trying.

539
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,429
I think I'm gonna be sick.

540
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,923
Well, try to get clear of the crime scene.

541
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:52,927
Jesus.

542
00:39:56,189 --> 00:39:59,817
Hey, Ruby said she didn't know
where either of you guys were,

543
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:01,645
so I thought you'd be down...

544
00:40:02,446 --> 00:40:04,105
What's he doing?

545
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:07,533
Grasping at anything that will prevent him

546
00:40:07,534 --> 00:40:10,536
from having to face the fact
that Branch committed suicide.

547
00:40:10,537 --> 00:40:11,620
[gunshot]

548
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:12,788
Shit! Jesus.

549
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:17,168
Guns make a lot of noise,
especially shotguns.

550
00:40:17,169 --> 00:40:21,922
Anybody could hear my gun sure
as hell could hear Branch's.

551
00:40:21,923 --> 00:40:24,091
Ferg, get out there.

552
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:28,220
See if you can find anyone who was
in earshot the last couple of days.

553
00:40:28,221 --> 00:40:31,098
I'm supposed to just ask anyone
that lives within a mile of...

554
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:32,141
[gunshot]

555
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:35,387
Ferg, why are you still here?

556
00:40:45,655 --> 00:40:48,449
Nothing to see here.

557
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,784
Just, you know...

558
00:40:50,785 --> 00:40:52,195
move along.

559
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,702
[organ music playing]

560
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:07,718
Ruby.

561
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:10,012
Are you sure he knows it's today?

562
00:41:10,013 --> 00:41:11,972
I reminded him three times.

563
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:14,008
He should be here.

564
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,136
[door closes]

565
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:21,200
[Barlow] Branch Connally, my son...

566
00:42:22,419 --> 00:42:25,371
did not take his own life.

567
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:32,044
He was a deputy of the Absaroka
County Sheriff's Department.

568
00:42:34,973 --> 00:42:37,676
And that job took his life.

569
00:42:42,105 --> 00:42:48,936
Branch emptied himself out...
trying to help other people.

570
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:52,148
Trying to help all of you.

571
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,401
Help the sheriff.

572
00:42:56,703 --> 00:43:02,742
He sacrificed himself, even
when it went unappreciated.

573
00:43:05,545 --> 00:43:08,998
He would've been sheriff
himself one day if only...

574
00:43:17,516 --> 00:43:19,467
The, um...

575
00:43:20,101 --> 00:43:24,472
The Connally family settled this county.

576
00:43:26,149 --> 00:43:31,396
And a lot of Connallys...
laid down their lives for it.

577
00:43:37,494 --> 00:43:40,906
But not before they left their mark.

578
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:48,128
Branch was supposed to have
built on what I had done,

579
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:51,290
j-just like I did from my daddy.

580
00:43:53,092 --> 00:43:55,503
But now, uh...

581
00:43:57,847 --> 00:43:59,674
it's the end of the line.

582
00:44:01,267 --> 00:44:03,845
We, uh...

583
00:44:05,188 --> 00:44:07,648
We all let him down.

584
00:44:07,649 --> 00:44:10,359
But that's, uh...

585
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,563
that's the past now.

586
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,608
So, let's, uh...

587
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:24,073
Let's try to carry him in
our hearts going forward.

588
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:27,493
He...

589
00:45:00,076 --> 00:45:02,745
Did you notice who wasn't here?

590
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:04,121
Lucian?

591
00:45:04,122 --> 00:45:06,290
[Walt] Lucian doesn't do funerals, no.

592
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:08,208
Nighthorse.

593
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:09,744
Ah.

594
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,915
I'm not obsessing, Henry. I'm observing.

595
00:45:14,674 --> 00:45:17,718
Nighthorse was Branch's biggest
benefactor during the election.

596
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:19,886
You'd think he would make an appearance.

597
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,346
Walt, do you think it might be a good idea

598
00:45:21,347 --> 00:45:23,932
to take a break from your
crusade just for today?

599
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:25,259
Ferg.

600
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:29,563
When you brought Branch the
personal items from his desk,

601
00:45:29,564 --> 00:45:32,316
do you remember seeing a bag
full of surveillance cameras?

602
00:45:32,317 --> 00:45:34,401
Yeah, they were right on top. Why?

603
00:45:34,402 --> 00:45:37,112
'Cause I don't remember seeing
them in Branch's house.

604
00:45:37,113 --> 00:45:39,740
- Did you?
- Did I what?

605
00:45:39,741 --> 00:45:42,367
See a bag full of surveillance
cameras at Branch's house?

606
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:44,662
No, why?

607
00:45:44,663 --> 00:45:47,665
So, what do you think that means, Sheriff?

608
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:48,791
I don't know.

609
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:51,418
Maybe he put them somewhere
we haven't looked yet.

610
00:45:51,419 --> 00:45:55,631
Or maybe there was incriminating
evidence on those cameras.

611
00:45:55,632 --> 00:45:59,210
And Jacob Nighthorse
broke in and stole it.

612
00:46:12,482 --> 00:46:14,107
Cady.

613
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:15,560
Cady.

614
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:18,445
How you holding up?

615
00:46:18,446 --> 00:46:20,698
Oh, you know. [chuckles]

616
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:22,115
Yeah.

617
00:46:22,116 --> 00:46:24,785
You want to get some breakfast?

618
00:46:24,786 --> 00:46:26,119
Uh, I-I can't.

619
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,332
Branch's family invited me to a private
ceremony at the grave site, so...

620
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:32,543
Of course. Makes sense.

621
00:46:32,544 --> 00:46:36,421
Not really, but I guess they don't
know that Branch and I broke up.

622
00:46:36,422 --> 00:46:40,133
It's awkward because I've never
met Branch's mom before.

623
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:41,635
That's good of you to go, so...

624
00:46:41,636 --> 00:46:43,428
Yeah.

625
00:46:43,429 --> 00:46:44,805
Um...

626
00:46:44,806 --> 00:46:46,340
How are you?

627
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:47,892
I'm fine.

628
00:46:47,893 --> 00:46:49,393
Really?

629
00:46:49,394 --> 00:46:51,019
That's not what I'm hearing.

630
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,848
What are you hearing?

631
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:59,979
That you're having a hard time
accepting the reality of this.

632
00:47:00,906 --> 00:47:05,234
- You talking to Henry?
- Doesn't matter who I'm talking to, Dad.

633
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,829
You got to stop carrying
around all this guilt.

634
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,414
You couldn't have done anything.

635
00:47:10,415 --> 00:47:11,874
Branch changed.

636
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:15,001
I didn't even recognize him at the end.

637
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:19,540
What he did, it was... It was really sad.

638
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:25,337
But it happened, and it wasn't your fault.

639
00:47:33,772 --> 00:47:35,731
You know what?
Let's go to breakfast. Let's go.

640
00:47:35,732 --> 00:47:37,023
No, no. You can't.

641
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:39,777
I-I don't think that you
should be alone right now.

642
00:47:39,778 --> 00:47:41,570
Neither should Branch's parents.

643
00:47:41,571 --> 00:47:44,114
They just lost their only son.

644
00:47:44,115 --> 00:47:47,735
Now, sometimes we got to do
things we don't want to, Punk.

645
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:52,873
But what do I say to them?

646
00:47:52,874 --> 00:47:54,993
You don't have to say a word.

647
00:48:11,726 --> 00:48:12,844
Thanks.

648
00:48:39,337 --> 00:48:43,089
- Hey. Are you following me?
- Not anymore.

649
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,716
Let me put this another way.

650
00:48:44,717 --> 00:48:46,844
Why are you following me?

651
00:48:46,845 --> 00:48:48,470
You know why.

652
00:48:48,471 --> 00:48:50,430
Okay, I give you my word.

653
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,642
I will have no contact whatsoever
with Jacob Nighthorse today.

654
00:48:53,643 --> 00:48:55,678
There. You satisfied?

655
00:48:56,896 --> 00:48:58,973
For today, at least.

656
00:49:16,207 --> 00:49:17,165
Good morning.

657
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:18,834
Standing Bear.

658
00:49:18,835 --> 00:49:20,168
Hey.

659
00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:22,629
I heard you was out.

660
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,091
It's good to see you breathing
the air of your ancestors.

661
00:49:26,092 --> 00:49:27,676
You have no idea.

662
00:49:27,677 --> 00:49:29,928
I do, actually.

663
00:49:29,929 --> 00:49:33,724
I did a nickel in Rawlins
back in the '90s.

664
00:49:33,725 --> 00:49:36,518
Like to buy some oranges?

665
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:38,687
I also got some buffalo jerky.

666
00:49:38,688 --> 00:49:42,440
Or maybe some dream catchers.

667
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:44,068
The turistos love them.

668
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:47,029
No, no, thank you. I am good.

669
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,322
I actually stopped to pay you back.

670
00:49:49,323 --> 00:49:50,983
For what?

671
00:49:52,243 --> 00:49:54,528
You contributed to my defense fund.

672
00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:57,873
You ain't got to pay me back for that.

673
00:49:57,874 --> 00:50:00,208
I donated that money.

674
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:02,586
Never meant to see it again.

675
00:50:02,587 --> 00:50:04,546
Or you, for that matter.

676
00:50:04,547 --> 00:50:07,549
Well, here I am.

677
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:08,717
And here is your money.

678
00:50:08,718 --> 00:50:10,552
I ain't touching it.

679
00:50:10,553 --> 00:50:14,598
Ain't often an Indian goes into
the white man's justice system

680
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:16,058
and comes out again.

681
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:19,185
Ain't often an Indian
gets any kind of justice,

682
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:22,140
especially now that Hector's gone.

683
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,987
You know, people still put
notes into Hector's jar.

684
00:50:36,955 --> 00:50:39,205
Out there at the old wall.

685
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:41,416
If it makes them feel comfort...

686
00:50:41,417 --> 00:50:43,085
that's good.

687
00:50:43,086 --> 00:50:47,248
But it's a shame ain't no one
to answer those notes no more.

688
00:50:52,595 --> 00:50:54,964
How about an orange for the road?

689
00:50:56,432 --> 00:50:58,516
Keep the change.

690
00:50:58,517 --> 00:51:00,469
Hey.

691
00:51:05,775 --> 00:51:08,144
[engine turns over]

692
00:51:10,989 --> 00:51:12,781
[Ruby] As soon as I get
the messages checked,

693
00:51:12,782 --> 00:51:14,783
I'll put on a pot of coffee.

694
00:51:14,784 --> 00:51:16,402
[door closes]

695
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:25,828
- [sighs]
- [clicking]

696
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:31,334
[Vic clears throat]

697
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:41,935
- What the hell are you doing?!
- I wasn't, Vic!

698
00:51:41,936 --> 00:51:44,062
- I am not gonna lose you, too!
- I wasn't!

699
00:51:44,063 --> 00:51:45,605
The gun's not even loaded.

700
00:51:45,606 --> 00:51:47,191
- What?
- See?

701
00:51:47,192 --> 00:51:48,517
Empty.

702
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:52,487
I couldn't stop...

703
00:51:52,488 --> 00:51:56,608
thinking about the length
of the barrel of this shotgun.

704
00:51:57,743 --> 00:52:02,823
Whether it was even possible for Branch
to pull the trigger with his hands.

705
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,543
It would be difficult.

706
00:52:06,544 --> 00:52:08,371
But it would be possible.

707
00:52:13,718 --> 00:52:17,838
Even if he couldn't, he could use his toe.

708
00:52:20,183 --> 00:52:22,934
Okay, then, so it was suicide.

709
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:25,854
Will you move on now?

710
00:52:25,855 --> 00:52:27,598
Please.

711
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:33,145
Branch was obsessed with his case.

712
00:52:34,405 --> 00:52:38,533
[sighs] We thought he was
wrong, but he was right.

713
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:42,529
I owed it to Branch to keep
on digging, but, uh...

714
00:52:43,873 --> 00:52:48,411
I think I have to stop
fighting this and just, uh...

715
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:52,839
just admit that what
happened happened, so...

716
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,794
Okay. So, then, you're not
gonna need this, right?

717
00:52:57,386 --> 00:52:59,012
Shit. God damn it.

718
00:52:59,013 --> 00:53:00,597
- No, wait, I'll just...
- I got it.

719
00:53:00,598 --> 00:53:02,341
It's fine.

720
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:14,652
What?

721
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:18,240
How'd the dirt get in the shell?
Never left the gun.

722
00:53:18,241 --> 00:53:21,527
- There's dirt inside the shell casing?
- Uh-huh.

723
00:53:29,877 --> 00:53:33,838
That would mean that somebody
put a spent shell back in the gun.

724
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,759
Someone tampered with that shotgun
before we got to the scene.

725
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,345
So, I went all over Branch's
house and the garage.

726
00:53:40,346 --> 00:53:43,424
No sign of the cameras
or the bag they were in.

727
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:48,346
I'm sorry.
Am... I interrupting something?

728
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:52,433
Branch didn't die the
way we thought he did.

729
00:53:53,943 --> 00:53:56,153
What we found down by
the river was staged.

730
00:53:56,154 --> 00:53:59,323
And whoever did it made sure
all the evidence washed away.

731
00:53:59,324 --> 00:54:03,402
I already know someone with a history
of staging fake death scenes.

732
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:05,696
Nighthorse?

733
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:07,698
Nighthorse.

734
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:11,251
[Walt] Doc...

735
00:54:11,252 --> 00:54:14,629
I need you to change the cause of
death on Branch's death certificate.

736
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,048
- I can't.
- Well, you have to.

737
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:20,010
It wasn't suicide. It was murder.
I found new evidence.

738
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:21,678
It's too late, Walt.

739
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:22,846
Don't you even want to hear it?

740
00:54:22,847 --> 00:54:27,017
Honestly, I don't really like discussing
tragedy after work hours, so, no.

741
00:54:27,018 --> 00:54:29,644
Come on, Doc. You saw Branch's wound.

742
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:31,604
You think after he shot
himself in the face,

743
00:54:31,605 --> 00:54:33,564
he ejected the shell,
picked it up off the ground,

744
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:35,192
and put it back in the gun?

745
00:54:35,193 --> 00:54:37,402
'Cause there was dirt in the spent shell.

746
00:54:37,403 --> 00:54:39,904
That's the only way
this could be a suicide.

747
00:54:39,905 --> 00:54:42,157
Okay, even so, Walt, the
paperwork's already been filed.

748
00:54:42,158 --> 00:54:43,449
There's nothing I can do.

749
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,827
So, you're gonna hide behind
some stupid bureaucratic process

750
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:47,329
'cause you don't want to do your job?

751
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:49,122
Wait a minute. Are you kidding me?

752
00:54:49,123 --> 00:54:50,374
My job description says nothing

753
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:54,336
about being your unofficial,
unpaid forensic researcher.

754
00:54:54,337 --> 00:54:56,296
Officially, that body was
supposed to go to Laramie.

755
00:54:56,297 --> 00:54:59,674
I did the autopsy as a personal
favor out of friendship.

756
00:54:59,675 --> 00:55:00,633
Now you're gonna walk in here

757
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:03,511
and you're gonna criticize me for...
for not breaking the law?

758
00:55:03,512 --> 00:55:05,347
I'm sorry. I'm not asking
you to break the law.

759
00:55:05,348 --> 00:55:07,473
Actually, that's exactly what
you're asking me to do, Walt.

760
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:10,185
I cannot legally alter
that death certificate

761
00:55:10,186 --> 00:55:12,520
unless I'm ordered to do so by a court.

762
00:55:12,521 --> 00:55:13,688
So, if you want a change,

763
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,899
you're gonna have to present
evidence in a court of law.

764
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,194
And if you want to prove that
Branch didn't commit suicide,

765
00:55:19,195 --> 00:55:20,278
I'm telling you right now,

766
00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:22,322
you're gonna need a little bit
more than just some dirt.

767
00:55:22,323 --> 00:55:23,990
Hey, listen.

768
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:25,909
You two rummies don't
keep it down out here,

769
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:28,078
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

770
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,080
What are you doing in Henry's office?

771
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:33,208
Oh, you know, just going over
the books, learning the ropes.

772
00:55:33,209 --> 00:55:37,295
It ain't easy with you two crackers
out here making a lot of racket.

773
00:55:37,296 --> 00:55:39,339
- Where's Henry?
- He's off the clock.

774
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,840
It's none of my concern.

775
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:43,718
Why are you walking around
like you own this place?

776
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:48,639
'Cause. Ever since your boy
signed the deed over to me, I do.

777
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,267

Hey, it's me.

786
00:57:10,722 --> 00:57:14,600
So, I have been to his house,
the office, the construction site.

787
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:16,853
There is no sign of Nighthorse anywhere.

788
00:57:16,854 --> 00:57:20,982
It's possible I alerted Jacob to our
interest in him earlier tonight.

789
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:22,317
[Vic] How?

790
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:23,651
Malachi.

791
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:26,446
He overheard me talking to Doc
Weston at the Red Pony, so...

792
00:57:26,447 --> 00:57:28,656
Shit.

793
00:57:28,657 --> 00:57:32,702
[Walt] Yeah, uh, was there something
else you wanted to talk to me about?

794
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:34,745
What? No. Why?

795
00:57:34,746 --> 00:57:36,122
Well, it's, uh...

796
00:57:36,123 --> 00:57:40,911
It's just that I-I saw you called
earlier and didn't leave a message.

797
00:57:42,046 --> 00:57:44,088
Um, yeah, no, that was nothing.

798
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:45,298
[Walt] You sure?

799
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:47,592
Yeah. Get some sleep, Walt.

When General Custer looked out
over the field at Little Bighorn,

807
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:15,172
do you think he had a moment to reflect?

808
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:17,265
I suspect.

809
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:21,519
How do you think he characterized
his failure in his own mind?

810
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,357
You think he felt he had
underestimated the Indians?

811
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:28,234
Overestimated himself?

812
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:29,777
What do you want, Jacob?

813
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:32,029
I just want to talk.

814
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:35,116
No lawyers, no bullshit.

815
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:36,618
[Walt] No bullshit?

816
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:38,453
What do you call this display?

817
00:59:38,454 --> 00:59:42,457
This is just... backup.

818
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:46,169
What do you want from me?

819
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:47,746
Your head on a pike.

820
00:59:48,631 --> 00:59:52,049
Or barring that, prison.

821
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:53,843
For what?

822
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:57,054
What did I ever really do to you, Walt?

823
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,848
I believe you murdered Branch.

824
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:00,224
Why would I murder Branch?

825
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:04,429
Because he exposed your soldier.
David Ridges.

826
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:08,107
Yeah.

827
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:09,693
But you killed him.

828
01:00:09,694 --> 01:00:13,571
[Walt] So, I take your
deputy, you take mine.

829
01:00:13,572 --> 01:00:17,359
Or maybe he found something
out that Ridges did for you.

830
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:21,572
Like kill my wife.

831
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:24,616
Oh.

832
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:29,337
So, that's what this is all about.

833
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:31,255
That's what this is all about.

834
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:35,259
Well, let me... put your mind at ease.

835
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,546
I don't kill women and children.

836
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:42,975
In fact, in my experience and
the experience of my people,

837
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:45,645
that's been more of a
white man's strategy.

838
01:00:45,646 --> 01:00:49,357
You once said you intended to
fight the white man on his terms.

839
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:51,192
And I will.

840
01:00:51,193 --> 01:00:56,113
Harnessing the power of the
almighty dollar with casinos.

841
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:58,533
You took our land.

842
01:00:58,534 --> 01:01:02,912
You killed us with guns and disease.

843
01:01:02,913 --> 01:01:05,206
You lied to us.

844
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:06,916
Shame on you!

845
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:10,294
But we were naive. We were gullible.

846
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:13,164
We never came together as
a people, so shame on us.

847
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:16,884
Look around you, Walt.

848
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:20,555
Cheyenne, Blackfoot, Sioux, Cherokee.

849
01:01:20,556 --> 01:01:27,311
Could it be we are no longer a
beaten, drunken, vanishing people?

850
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:29,021
We are united.

851
01:01:29,022 --> 01:01:32,983
We will not be harassed
and intimidated anymore.

852
01:01:32,984 --> 01:01:34,686
These men have my back!

853
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:38,615
And I have theirs.

854
01:01:38,616 --> 01:01:41,117
So, you're threatening me? Is that it?

855
01:01:41,118 --> 01:01:46,038
I'm just giving you the warning
poor General Custer never got.

856
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:49,785
Don't overestimate yourself.

857
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:54,581
And don't underestimate us.

858
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,753
Oh.

859
01:02:03,014 --> 01:02:04,599
All right, let's go!

860
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,052
[speaks native language]

861
01:02:10,147 --> 01:02:12,016
