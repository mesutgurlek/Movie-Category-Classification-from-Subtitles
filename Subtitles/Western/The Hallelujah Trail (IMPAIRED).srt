<i>or the lance of an Indian warrior.</i>

<i>Every page in history

<i>and ours takes us to the year 1867.</i>

58
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,164
<i>An army that had fought
in the war between the states,</i>

59
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,365
<i>that had bravely battled
in many an Indian campaign,</i>

60
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,529
<i>now patrolled the West in a time of peace,</i>

61
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,211
<i>with ever-present thoughts of home.</i>

62
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,928
<i>The Indian was back on the reservation,</i>

63
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,841
<i>where the Peace Commission of 1867
had met with various warlike tribes</i>

64
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,691
<i>and secured certain promises from them.</i>

65
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,690
<i>In return, papers were given to Indians,</i>

66
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,045
<i>certifying them to be good citizens
who would obey the laws of the land.</i>

67
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,447
<i>Many gifts were distributed.</i>

68
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,847
<i>Beads,</i>

69
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,047
<i>pieces of cloth,</i>

70
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,962
<i>ammunition,</i>

71
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,087
<i>and war-surplus rifles.</i>

72
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,643
<i>Naturally, these rifles</i> were
<i>quite unfamiliar to the Indians.</i>

73
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,089
<i>Of course, it was understood
these weapons were to be used</i>

74
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,771
<i>solely for the purpose of hunting game.</i>

75
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,966
<i>The leaves fumed early in that year.</i>

76
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,122
<i>It could be a long, hard winter.</i>

77
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,127
<i>The signs were everywhere.</i>

78
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,406
<i>In the high country, the morning frost
would sometimes last until afternoon.</i>

79
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,648
<i>Buffalo were feeding ravenously.</i>

80
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,685
<i>Beaver were damming
and storing with strange vigour.</i>

81
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,124
<i>Horses and dogs were becoming
shaggy-haired as never before.</i>

82
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,048
<i>And it could be sensed in the booming,
bustling mining town of Denver.</i>

83
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,607
<i>Most historians agree that the events
leading to the Battle of Whiskey Hills</i>

84
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,326
<i>and the subsequent disaster
at Quicksand Bottoms</i>

85
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,683
<i>began here in Denver,
at a miners' meeting.</i>

86
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,841
<i>Such meetings were frequent and held
as part of the political fabric of the town.</i>

87
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,964
<i>But the meeting of November 4th
had a marked air of grim foreboding.</i>

88
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,240
Quiet! I got an announcement
I gotta make.

89
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,924
In 10 days from now
the city of Denver will be bone dry.

90
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,485
<i>(all) No!</i>

91
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,285
Not one drop of whiskey anywhere.

92
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,205
- Speak up! We can't hear ya!
- I said Denver will be bone dry in 10 days.

93
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,606
You heard what I said.
I said plumb out and I mean out!

94
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,528
Wait a minute. I thought Bert Keeler
was gettin' in a big order, but he was sick.

95
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,804
Sam Buford was gettin' in So barrels, but
Sam got his foot caught in that bear trap.

96
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,366
He didn't tell Shelby
to get his 50 barrels, so...

97
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,768
So with four big orders outta reach,
there ain't nobody else put in.

98
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,680
- Now, take this here saloon alone.
- That's all there is.

99
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,725
Look at it. And there's already been
snow flurries along Gunner's Pass.

100
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,808
If we get ourselves a hard, cold winter,

101
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,003
there won't be a wagonload of whiskey
in Denver till spring.

102
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,122
And it could be a late spring.

103
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,168
Hold it! So what we need,
we need us a plan.

104
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,960
Hey! What does Oracle say?

105
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,728
Afternoon, gents.

106
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,491
Oracle, what about this here winter?

107
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,091
The buffalo are feedin' ravenous.

108
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,885
The beaver are workin' somethin' fierce.

109
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,642
The horses and dogs are growin'
shaggy-haired like never before.

110
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,608
What else? Have you seen anything else?

111
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,886
Yep, I had me a vision on, uh...
Oh, it come on me two days ago.

112
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,367
- Well?
- What'd you see?

113
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,288
Uh...

114
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,368
Why, thank you.

115
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,286
At the feed store, it was.
Come on more sudden than most.

116
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,609
I was lookin' up, and there it was.

117
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,087
- What was it?
- Snow.

118
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,407
Heavy, white snow.

119
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,568
Yep, it's gonna be a long, hard winter.

120
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,526
And when a long, hard winter hits us,
by damn, she hits.

121
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,008
- No wagons gettin' through, no supplies?
- And no whiskey.

122
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,690
- You know.
- Yep.

123
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,883
It come on me two days ago.
We gotta have a plan.

124
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,685
- What kinda plan, Oracle?
- Uh, let me just...

125

<i>♪ Hallelujah!</i>

126

There! Now I see it!

127
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,447
I see all of us a-comin' together. I, um...

128
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,329
I see us puttin' all the whiskey orders into
one big shipment for the whole winter.

129
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,643
I see us gettin'

from some good company like, uh, uh...

131
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,967
Thank you. Like Frank Wallingham...

132
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,884
to get them drinkables to our saloons
right now afore the snows hit.

133
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,967
I, uh...

134
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,608
I see a wagon train, a whole
wagon train loaded up with whiskey

135
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,927
a-comin' down on us from Julesburg.

136
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,408

30...

138
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,210
40 wagons.

139
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,210
- Are you Hobbs?
- I am, sir.

140
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,524
- Did you print that?
- I did, sir.

141
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,803
- And who, may I ask, are you?
- Frank Wallingham.

142
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,242
I see. How do you do?
Won't you sit down, Mr Wallingham?

143
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,170
No. I wanna know why.
Why did you do it?

144
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,647
I've done nothing but print the truth.

145
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,481
600 barrels of Philadelphia-brewed
whiskey moving from here to Denver.

146
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,527
Yes. Then what happens when the Indians
get wind of 40 wagons full of firewater?

147
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,122
- They'll scalp us from head to foot.
- Indians don't read newspapers.

148
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,562
- Who says they don't?
- The Indian problem's all settled.

149
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,126
Haven't you read
the Peace Commissioners' report?

150
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,210
All right, then. Worse than Indians!
Revenue agents!

151
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,926
Oh... Haven't paid
your federal taxes, huh?

152
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,409
Of course I pay my taxes! I'm an honest
businessman. <i>And</i> a good Republican.

153
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,729
But give those snoopers a taste of honey

154
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,888
from every direction but up.

155
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,651
- You have my sympathy.
- Sympathy?

156
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,127
It's because I didn't advertise in your rag,

157
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,325
- because I didn't give you free whiskey.
- You'd better get outta here.

158
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,967
You listen to me. I've got every cent
that I own tied up in this cargo.

159
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,562
By damn, I'm gonna see it gets to Denver.
You can print that, sir.

160
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,806
I shall.

161
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,685
I'm sending a telegram to
Colonel Gearhart at Fort Russell.

162
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,930
I am demanding an entire troop of
US cavalry as escort. Print that, sir!

163
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,804
- I shall.
- Good.

164
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,890
You should also put in your paper
that I say

165
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,971
that any tax snooper, white road agent
or Red Indian that comes near my wagons

166
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,401
had better be wearin'
cast-iron underwear.

167
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,126
And if you try to blackmail me
one more time,

168
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,403
I'll come back here and cram
this down your lyin' throat.

169
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,488
Good day, sir.

170
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,850
- Smythe.
- Yes, sir.

171
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,804
What's the name of that
temperance woman? Martindale?

172
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,924
Massingale, sir.
Cora Templeton Massingale.

173
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,044
Oh, yes, Massingale.
Do you know where she is?

174
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,803
On a tour of New England last month, sir.
Then Boston, to Philadelphia, to Trenton.

175
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,890
She may be a female hellcat
about whiskey, sir,

176
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,402
but a fine figure of a woman, with eyes...

177
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,329
- Smythe.
- Sir?

178
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,408
I asked you where she is.

179
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,888
Oh. At Fort Russell, sir.
She got there yesterday.

180
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,446
Fort Russell?

181
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,245
Send a telegram to her. Mark it urgent.

182
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,010
<i>The editor of the Julesburg Gazette
was quite right.</i>

183
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,487
<i>Indians did not read newspapers.</i>

184
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,201
<i>It's a matter of speculation therefore just
how they did hear of the whiskey cargo.</i>

185
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,368
There were couriers, of course,

186
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,327
<i>and there was the smoke signal, first
used by the ancient Greeks and Hebrews.</i>

187
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,606
<i>How the Indians acquired it from them
is of no importance here. But they did.</i>

188
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,211
<i>Nor was smoke used exclusively.</i>

189
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,642
<i>A crude mirror, painted stone,</i>

190
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,809
<i>carved bark of trees were quite popular.</i>

191
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,680
<i>And a peculiarly knotted string.</i>

192
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,643
<i>The message was always
transmitted in code.</i>

193
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,048
<i>A code which no white man
was ever able to break.</i>

194
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,203
<i>Regardless of what method
was used by the Indians,</i>

195
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,244
<i>it's a matter of record
that news of the whiskey train</i>

196
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,807
<i>became common knowledge within 48 hours</i>

197
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,404
<i>to every tribe of every
North American Plains Indian.</i>

198
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:27,085
<i>We are still unaware why only one tribe
rode out to investigate the firewater train.</i>

199
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,888
<i>But it's supposed there was competition
among the various tribes for the honour.</i>

200
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,691
<i>It is for us to make reconnaissance
of wagon-train position.</i>

201
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,482
<i>It is for me to make such reconnaissance.</i>

202
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,806
<i>He is chief of Sioux.</i>

203
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,331
<i>And I am chief of Crow.</i>

204
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,208
<i>We will do it.</i>

205
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,570
<i>You will not do it. I will do it.</i>

Yes, we are.

<i>Authorities agree that personal disputes

<i>were settled very quickly.</i>

Oh, thank you, thank you!
Your reception has warmed my heart.

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,166
- Where the hell did you come from?
- I couldn't help but overhear, sir.

309
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,251
I want the colonel to know that what
happened tonight, the way it happened,

310
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,045
was so quick that I hardly
had time to marshal my forces.

311
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,323
Did you give that woman permission
for a temperance rally?

312
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,286
Yes and no. That is, I had no idea
it would get outta hand, so to speak, sir.

313
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,641
What the hell did you expect?

314
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,764
Give a woman an acorn
and you're up to your rump in oak trees.

315
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,963
That's very true, sir. And I am sorry.

316
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,448
If only they hadn't started moving...
that is to say, marching.

317
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,121
- Led by the Fort Russell band.
- I'd say that Mrs Massingale led them.

318
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,802
The band came next. You see, they were
playing The <i>Battle</i> Hymn of the Republic,

319
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,481
and every time they got to
"Hallelujah" - boom!

320
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,530
- I'm sorry, sir, about the cannon.
- Spare me the details.

321
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,608
Slater, what if word got out

322
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,610
that Fort Russell stood behind
a temperance movement?

323
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,930
That I, a line officer,
could ever support such a movement?

324
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,202
Well, you got a point there, sir.

325
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,043
- And you let them go right ahead.
- Well, I, uh...

326
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,085
Actually, I was trying to keep the colonel's
daughter out of it, for your sake.

327
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,362
What's my daughter got to do with this?

328
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,926
- Well, your daughter...
- Please.

329
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,725
I beg you not to hold
Paul responsible, Father.

330
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,808
It was my fault. I was the one who...

331
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,811
She was not. And I refuse to allow her
to accept responsibility. I was the one.

332
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,604
- You were not.
- Yes, I was.

333
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,881
Paul...

334
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,891
- In my own quarters.
- We're sorry, Father, truly we are.

335
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,889
- B-but...
- But what?

336
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,968
But...

337
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,049
But may I point out, sir, that you have
the only private quarters at the fort,

338
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,050
and we didn't expect you back so soon.

339
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,050
It's true that Miss Gearhart
has her own quarters, sir,

340
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,927
but I thought that my presence there
might put her in a compromising position.

341
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,283
- Since my own quarters are shared, sir...
- Slater! Answer me.

342
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,768
- I'm trying to, sir.
- He isn't either, not truthfully.

343
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,282
He wasn't keeping me out of the
temperance meeting, I was keeping him.

344
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,927
I thought he might try to stop
the marching, so this seemed a lovely...

345
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,249
I mean, a way... to divert him.

346
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,048
Louise.

347
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,561
You don't really mind, do you, darling?

348
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,605
I mean, you certainly couldn't have
enjoyed yourself any the less.

349
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,688
Louise!

350
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,003
Well, I'd do anything for
Cora Massingale and her cause.

351
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,045
And if you've hurt her, Father,
I'll never forgive you.

352
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,402
- Slater.
- Yes, sir.

353
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,844
The women, the rally, the cannon.
I'll chalk it all up to your inexperience.

354
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,927
Thank you, sir.

355
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,206
But you cannot... you simply cannot use
my quarters for... for this sort of thing.

356
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,651
I'm sorry, sir.

357
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,810
Why don't you just get on with it and
marry the girl? Stop all this lying around?

358
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,244
Well, the colonel knows my feelings about
that, sir. The West is no life for a woman.

359
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,728
The West is no life for anyone.
Wind, dust, Indians.

360
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,208
I hate the wind. I hate the dust.
And I hate the Indians.

361
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,609
Yes, I know. And until my transfer
comes through to an eastern post, I'll...

362
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,527
I'll drink to that.

363
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,008
To you and Louise and a transfer.
There you are.

364
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,970
- I can't, sir.
- Why not?

365
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,402
I haven't said good night to Louise yet.
The liquor on my breath...

366
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,002
- She knows you drink, she knows I drink.
- I know that, sir, but...

367
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,886
if you had seen her at that meeting
tonight. She heard Mrs Massingale.

368
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,766
Her eyes all lit up.
Frightened hell out of me, sir.

369
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,326
All right. Go to her.
Do whatever it is you do.

370
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,807
- Thank you, sir.
- But not on my bear rug!

371
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,888
No. No, sir.

372
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,047
Slater.

373
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,290
Here. Escort for a wagon train.
Fella named Wallingham.

374
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,482
Taxpayer, good Republican.

375
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,844
I want you to figure out how to intercept
the train and escort them to Denver.

376
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,726
Denver? That'll take over a week.
I promised Louise...

377
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,002
I know, I know. She'll cry, of course.

378
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,646
Just tell her duty is a cruel master.

379
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,206
Yes, sir. Duty... is a cruel... master.

380
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,971
Yes, sir. Thank you. Good night, sir.

381
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,081
- (knocking)
- Colonel Gearhart?

382
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,848
Colonel?

383
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,408
Colonel?

384
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,851
I, uh...

385
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,284
I don't wish to intrude on your privacy,
Colonel, but... this is vitally important.

386
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,607
I'm taking a bath.

387
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,768
The sight of a gentleman taking his bath

388
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,521
is not foreign to a woman
who's been widowed twice.

389
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,883
Well... Would you care to have a seat?

390
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,845
No, thank you. What I have to say
is best said standing.

391
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,281
You'll forgive me if I don't get up.

392
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,562
It's not necessary.

393
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,403
Mrs Massingale, I've already told Captain
Slater I won't hold him responsible.

394
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,649
In your case, I've written off
the entire incident. So now...

395
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,524
That's not why I'm here.

396
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,281
I have received a telegram from Julesburg
that distresses me deeply.

397
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,847
It says a train of 40 wagons left there
yesterday bound for Denver

398
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,123
and that you are to furnish
military escort for that train.

399
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,607
Is that information correct?

400
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,929
I received a request to that effect, yes.

401
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,251
Were you aware, Colonel, that the cargo
of those 40 wagons is alcohol?

402
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,843
- No, ma'am.
- Well, now you know.

403
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,770
Tell me, Colonel, are you
going to furnish escort?

404
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,644
Yes, ma'am.

405
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,844
I respectfully request
that you reconsider, Colonel.

406
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,601
In the name of suffering humanity,
I implore you to halt that wagon train

407
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,088
and destroy this poison
that they're carrying.

408
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,091
What you ask is... What you ask
is impossible. The cargo is legal.

409
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,090
I have no grounds nor wish
to destroy civilian property.

410
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,646
And now, madam, will you
leave me to my bath?

411
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,047
Is it legal to sell whiskey to Indians?

412
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,642
Who said anything...
Who said anything about Indians?

413
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,491
The cargo is headed for Denver,
for businessmen there.

414
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,570
- How do you know?
- I have the owner's word for it.

415
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,331
Mr Frank Wallingham,
who is an acquaintance,

416
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,966
a taxpayer, and a good Republican.

417
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,247
Well, in that case,
you force me to take action.

418
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,289
Our movement has many friends
in many high places.

419
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,006
Men such as... Horace Greeley.

420
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,763
Is that a threat?

421
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,362
You can consider it such if you like.
My conscience forces me to make it.

422
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,642
And mine demands that I do my duty.

423
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,288
So be it.

424
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,807
May I impose upon your kindness for
directions to the post telegraph office?

425
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,688
Mrs Massingale, I'll do better than that.

426
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,486
I'll furnish you transportation
to the Cheyenne telegraph office,

427
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,082
where your messages are sure
to get out twice as quickly.

428
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,443
Thank you.

429
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,450
Call on me again if there's
anything further I can do.

430
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,040
You're a very generous man, Colonel.

431
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,368
Right tum! Ho!

432
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,606
Three telegrams, sir, just arrived.

433
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,568
Read them.

434
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,242
"The Governor of Colorado is
against liquor and its vicissitudes,

435
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,170
but his position makes it impossible
to take a position

436
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,851
in the matter of whiskey cargo to Denver."

437
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,769
"The Adjutant General's office is
grateful to Women's Temperance

438
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:15,647
for the splendid morale factor they have
upon the American soldier. However..."

439
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,604
Whiskey matters must be left
to commanders in the field.

440
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,688
"Respectfully."

441
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,207
"Mr Horace Greeley

442
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,642
has ever championed the noble cause
of temperance and suffrage,

443
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,209
but is unable to interfere with
constituted authority of the West."

444
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,802
Buell. Give these to Mrs Massingale
with my compliments

445
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,686
and arrange transportation for her.
Her movement is moving.

446
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,408
Yes, sir.

447
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,609
<i>On the morning of November 16th,</i>

448
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:55,170
<i>the Wallingham wagon train was moving
along north of the South Platte River.</i>

449
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,648
<i>At the head was its owner,
Frank Wallingham,</i>

450
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,809
<i>and its wagon master, Rafe Pike.</i>

451
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,527
<i>To the rear was a group of Irish teamsters</i>

452
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,122
<i>under the leadership
of one Kevin O'Flaherly.</i>

453
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,322
<i>The Slater patrol was turning south</i>

454
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,125
<i>towards the course
of the Wallingham train,</i>

455
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,811
<i>and a band of Sioux warriors
was on the move,</i>

456
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,526
<i>led by the great Chief 5 Barrels</i>

457
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,644
<i>and his sub-chief, Walks-Stooped-Over,</i>

458
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,205
<i>who was also known in certain
Indian circles as Sky Eyes,</i>

459
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,482
<i>due to the blue colour of his eyes,</i>

460
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:36,403
<i>the heritage apparently of some slight,
uh... irregularity in his ancestry.</i>

461
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,810
- Please, Father, be reasonable.
- No.

462
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,811
If Mrs Massingale wants a farewell
meeting, she may use the mess hall.

463
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,843
But I will not attend.

464
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,167
But we're not asking you
to take the pledge.

465
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,568
Although a bit of temperance
might make you happier.

466
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,524
No red-blooded drinking man
is more temperate than I am.

467
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,768
And I'm happy. I'm damned happy.

468
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,851
If you would only try to
understand Mrs Massingale,

469
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,167
a woman who's lost
two husbands to alcohol.

470
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,806
They drank themselves
into an early grave.

471
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,888
I can only wonder why.

472
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,684
Do you absolutely refuse, Father,
to attend this meeting?

473
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,610
I do, and I'm beginning
to regret giving you the hall.

474
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,007
The least you can do
is release the post band.

475
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,609
No.

476
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,041
- But we can't sing hymns without them.
- Good.

477
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,640
- There's no point in having the meeting.
- Splendid.

478
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,728
Please, Father.

479
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,288
It means so much to us.
And Mrs Massingale is leaving.

480
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,368
We may never see her again.

481
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,490
- Can I depend on that?
- Oh, I never go back on my word.

482
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,046
I shall say goodbye at the meeting.

483
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,730
Well, maybe the trombone.

484
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,286
Thank you, Father. You're a dear.

485
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,483
- And the drums?
- No. No drums.

486
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,407
Good afternoon.

492
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,211
- What's goin' on over there?
- Singing, sir.

493
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,891
- You have guards at every exit?
- As you ordered, sir.

494
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,209
You'd better double the guards.
Check the exits yourself.

495
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,210
If they break out of that hall
in marching formation...

496
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,041
- That's what happened to Captain Slater.
- Yes, sir.

497
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,129
(Mrs Massingale) Ladies,
our enemy has two heads.

498
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,369
First, the enslavement of women by men.

499
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,686
(women) Yes.

500
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,883
And second, the enslavement
of men themselves

501
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,401
by the remorseless tyrant alcohol.

502
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,603
- Are we willing to fight these enemies?
- Yes.

503
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,768
Then we must reach out for freedom,

504
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,724
and tear this tyrant from the lips of man.

505
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,122
Now, ladies, I have
an announcement to make

506
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,642
to each and every one of you
who has touched my heart.

507
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,129
The time has come for me to say goodbye
to all you wonderful women...

508
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,685
Thank God!

509
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,088
Something has occurred
which requires my presence elsewhere.

510
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,364
- I am going to the city of Denver.
- Denver?

511
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,281
I know, I know. You ask me
"Why Denver?" I'll tell you why.

512
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,722
Because 40 wagons of whiskey
are going to Denver right now.

513
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,129
40 wagons of poison
for those poor misguided citizens,

514
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,322
and no one in high office seems to care.

515
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,169
Well, <i>I</i> do!

516
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,442
And I shall shout it over and over

517
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,168
until the mountains of Colorado come
tumbling down to the Denver saloons.

518
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,166
- Will your hearts go with me?
- Yes!

519
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,445
- Is our cause just and righteous?
- Yes!

520
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,604
- I've doubled the guards, sir.
- I want you to guard the main entrance.

521
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,849
- Do I have your blessings?
- Yes!

522
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,007
No!

523
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,329
No! I cannot let you go
to that sinful city alone.

524
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,244
If you'll have me, Mrs Massingale,
I'll go with you.

525
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,843
Get over there.
Drag my daughter off that platform.

526
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,165
Oh, how wonderful, ladies!

527
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,648
- Oh, ladies, we'll all go to Denver.
- Yes!

528
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,970
- We'll make it our marching song.

Knocked me flat, sir.

Did you hear what that... woman said, sir?

548
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,923
I did.

- "But, sir" what?

550
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,047
How can we let them
go through with it, sir?

551
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,006
March to Denver through country like this,
without escort or protection?

552
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,600
What if they come upon
a bunch of Indians, sir?

553
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,087
I suggest we pray for the Indians.

554
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,203
Can the... the army refuse escort, sir?

555
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,331
From now on, the army will do

Go away.

561
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,208
Louise, will you please go away?

562
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,846

You will not under any circumstances

Yes, Father.

00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,283
To Denver or anyplace else.
I want that clearly understood.

Yes, Father.

Louise, go and get me some
more blankets. Lots of them.

574
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,601
I want him to perspire. We will
sweat the poison out of his system.

Blankets. All right, Mrs Massingale.

576
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,887
- Mrs Massingale!
- Lie back.

577
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,002
- Madam...
- Back.

578
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,689
Now... just be quiet, please.
Don't exert yourself.

579
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,524
- Madam, we have a surgeon.
- Just relax.

580
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,608
Let the blood flow.

581
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,609
Now tell me, Colonel, does
the pain centre lie about here?

582
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,688
Look, Mrs...

583
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,009
- It's a little higher.
- A little higher. Yes, of course.

584
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,370
- About this march, Mrs Massingale...
- Just unwind.

585
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,131
This march to Denver... impossible.

586
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:44,410
Right here, at this junction,
Colonel, a series of cords.

587
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:50,564
And beneath them, intertwined nerves
like fine silk threads.

588
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,971
Matters of... transportation.

589

Rattlesnakes...

590
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,248
All connected up to here
where the pain centre lies.

591
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,888
Examine my position.

592
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,608
Consider, if you will...

593
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,842
- Oh, that feels good.
- That's the key point.

594
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,409
First we rub gently downwards,

595
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,607
and then upwards,

596
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,282
and then downwards again.

597
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,645
Now you're beginning to relax.
I can feel it in my fingers.

598
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,728
I wish I could help you, but...

- Husbands. Not all the ladies are single.

- What do they want here?
- The ladies are takin' their wagons away.

They want the colonel

Sir, do you really intend
to go through with this thing?

Buell, you've got a great deal

Would you mind calling some other time,
Colonel? I'm taking a bath.

747
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,008
I am well aware that you're taking a bath.

748
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:05,523
I don't care how dirty you are. I will not
have you ladies bathing in the nude.

749
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,642
There's no other way I know of, Colonel.

750
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,287
The opportunity was there and...
who knows what tomorrow might bring?

751
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,324
Especially now that
we've changed our plans.

752
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,410
- Changed your plans?
- Yes, Colonel.

753
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,211
You mean you want to go
back to Cheyenne now?

754
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,370
Don't be ridiculous. Of course not.
We want only to meet the wagon train.

755
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,087
But you are meeting the train.
That's why we're going to Denver.

756
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,044
But we want to meet it
long before it reaches Denver.

757
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,322
- That's not possible.
- On the contrary.

758
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,843
We now intend to intercept
the wagon train along the River Platte.

759
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,642
(shouts) You what?

760
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,760
In a clash of wills, Colonel,
he who shouts loudest is lost.

761
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,848
Madam...

762
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:54,887

ladies through unsettled Plains country

763
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,243
- along the South Platte River trail.
- Exactly.

764
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:02,160
And upon meeting the wagon train, I
surmise you will put on a demonstration,

765
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,329
whose purpose is to tum back the train.

766
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,885
Precisely.

767
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,009
Very well. But if you think
the United States Army

768
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,727
is going to escort a bunch of
harebrained females across open desert,

769
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:19,289
bent on throwing themselves under
horse teams, you're gravely mistaken.

770
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,724
Very well. I thank you
for your many courtesies thus far,

771
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,731
but if you force us to go our way
unescorted and any harm comes to us,

772
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:33,244
three million infuriated women will
turn the War Department upside down.

773
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:40,763
Mrs Massingale, if I could force you
to do anything, which obviously I cannot,

774
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,044
it would be to go home, and stay home,
where all decent women belong.

775
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,448
- Sergeant.
- Sir?

776
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,528
- Dammit.
- Yes, sir.

777
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:19,722
Sergeant, I want some scouts
on the trail of those women tomorrow.

778
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,161
Have them keep
in constant touch with us.

779
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,647
We'll move in a somewhat
parallel direction.

780
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,728
Yes, sir.

781
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,762
Excuse me, sir. Parallel direction...

782
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,410
Is that a new tactic, sir?
I'm not acquainted with it.

783
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,206
- It was well known throughout the war.
- Yes, sir, of course.

784
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,006
- What's it called, sir?
- Called?

785
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:47,808
What command shall I give the men?
"Move in a somewhat parallel direction"?

786
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,844
It's called... detached contact.

787
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,486
Detached contact?

788
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,410
And let it so be recorded
in the daily journal!

789
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,408
Yes, sir.

790
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:26,042
<i>No documents can establish just how
the Sioux formulated their plans,</i>

791

807

810

- It's a miracle.
- I beg your pardon, sir?

931
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:17,769
A miracle of the highest order that so
many bullets could miss so many people

932
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,770
in so small an area
in such a short space of time.

933
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:25,090
- No fatalities at all?
- None reported, sir.

934
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,841
- What do you propose that we do now?
- Our duty is crystal clear.

935
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,611
The first thing we must do
is keep the peace.

936
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,121
- Do you agree, Buell?
- Absolutely, sir.

937
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:37,050
There are three important steps
to peace negotiations.

938
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,925
No fraternisation
and no discharge of firearms.

939
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:41,246
Yes, sir.

940
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,524
- And the third step, sir?
- The third step? It's not important.

941
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:49,725
What is important is to have a conference.
No peace without a conference, Slater.

942
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,845
Buell, inform all interested parties
a conference will be held here

943
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,327
- in one hour from now.
- Yes, sir.

944
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,763
Beyond that, my contract - I got it here -
says that I am going to deliver,

945
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,406
and I am gonna deliver,
come hell or high water.

946
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:09,251
You gotta get them
damn foreigners outta here.

947
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,409
- Mr Wallingham...
- I am a taxpayer and a good Republican,

948
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,522
which means I am entitled to army escort.

949
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:17,769
I'm damn well gonna get army escort
or I'm gonna raise hell...

950
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,644
- Mr Wallingham.
- What?

951
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,128
I will not tolerate profanity
in the presence of ladies.

952
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,448
Oh...

953
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,920
I think we understand
your position by now.

954
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:33,806
The next party to be heard from
will be... uh... uh... Who are you?

955
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:38,287
My name is Clayton Howell, sir,
commander of the Denver Free Militia.

956
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,721
- What do you want?
- I'd like to inform the colonel

957
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:44,640
that a lot of us here are members of
the Denver Saloon Owners' Association,

958
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:48,048
and we intend to receive that there cargo
and take it home with us.

959
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,561
The winter nights are
long and lonely in Denver,

960
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,682
and a man is sorely in need of comfort.

961
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,408
Startin' next month, that there sun
is gonna be a-settin' at 5.33pm,

962
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,682
and she's gonna rise 11 dark hours later...

963
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,804
All right. I think we can
leave the sun out of this.

964
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,167
- What are you doing here, Oracle?
- Colonel.

965
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,681
I'm the guide to the Denver Free Militia.

966
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,486
It is my duty to see that this
precious cargo and these good people...

967
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:16,366
Thank you, Oracle.
I'm well aware of the duties of a guide.

968
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,730
- You're next.
- Kevin O'Flaherty at your service, sir.

969
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,003
President of the Irish Teamsters.
With your permission,

970
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,885
I have here a resolution
containing 14 points,

971
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,810
which I'd like to read
prior to these labour negotiations.

972
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,445
Labour negotiations?

973
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,006
If our demands are not satisfied,
your lordship,

974
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,805
we intend to strike,
as nasty as that may seem.

975
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,526
- By damn, you just try...
- Wallingham!

976
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:40,481
Oh.

977
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,331
I am not gonna abandon
10 of my wagons to them Indians.

978
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:47,809
Who said you had to? You've got the
Denver Free Militia to drive your wagons.

979
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,843
What?

980
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,644
Excuse me, sir.

981
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:55,367
The militia couldn't do it, unless
we took a soldier to guard each wagon.

982
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:00,611
- They're the worst bar flies in Denver.
- And who's gonna guard the soldiers?

983
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:04,406
I see what you mean. Our supply of
temperance men is extremely limited.

984
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,443
Yes, sir. It sure is.

985
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:11,922
Well, since you have nothing further
to say, Mr O'Flaherty, sit down.

986
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:15,010
- I call on Mrs Massingale.
- Thank you very much, Colonel.

987
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,011
The temperance movement has now
spread right across this great nation.

988
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,690
Founded in the year...

989
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,724
Mrs Massingale, we are not here
for a history of the movement.

990
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,411
- Have you anything further to say?
- I have.

991
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:30,081
Dump it, I say. Dump this entire
vile cargo into the river right now.

992
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,090
- By damn, madam...
- Mr Wallingham!

Did you get that, Captain?

995
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:55,087
Not a word, but I have
an interpreter standing by. Sims!

996
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,523
Yes, sir.

997
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:03,009
Sims, find out what they're doing here,
why they left the reservation.

998
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,123
<i>Hunt buffalo. Minding own business.</i>

999

<i>Then white Long Knives come along
and attack peaceful Indian.</i>

1000

<i>Paper say peaceful Indian.</i>

1001

<i>We go home,
but first you give us presents.</i>

1002
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,129
- What'd he say?
- He said.

1003
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:48,084
"Hunt buffalo in peace,
minding their own business,

1004
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,282
- when white Long Knives attack."
- What?

1005
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,483
Yes, sir. But they're willin'
to go home now, sir.

1006
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,047
- Well, tell him he's made a wise decision.
- Yes, sir.

1007
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,451
Where are presents for us?

1008
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:14,051
<i>You give me 20 wagons whiskey</i>

1009
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:18,051
<i>or I' don't take my braves home.</i>

1010
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,608
<i>Period.</i>

1011
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,329
Yes? What'd he say?

1012
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:30,728
He said he would like
to give you a present, sir.

1013
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,842
- That's fine.
- But he hasn't got one, sir.

1014
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,645
I see. Thank him, but tell him
no present is necessary.

1015
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,728
Wait... I'll tell him.

1016
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:58,243
All right, then. Tomorrow morning,
this whole, uh... this, uh...

1017
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,485
We're leaving for Denver.

1018
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:04,321
You will take your orders from
Sergeant Major Buell as to starting time,

1019
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,364
disposition of marching order,
camp sites, et cetera.

1020
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:10,051
Any decisions to be made
will be made by me.

1021

- Sergeant.
- Conference stands adjourned!

1022
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,488
- Buell.
- Yes, sir?

1023
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,048
What are those Indians doing here?

1024
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:00,846
- I don't know, sir.
- How long have they been following us?

1025
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,328
I was gonna bring that matter
to the colonel's attention.

1026
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:09,401
They've been trailing us all day, sir.
Shall I take a squad and run 'em off, sir?

1027
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:14,125
Buell, the Indian wars are over. These
Sioux are wards of the government.

1028
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:18,325
- How would that look in Washington?
- The colonel has a point, sir.

1029
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:23,207
Get the interpreter. Find out why they're
still here. And we'll camp early tonight.

1030
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:26,642
- Field quarters assembly?
- Have the sentries out before dark.

1031
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:34,250
Carter, check the rest of the sentries
and find Sergeant Buell.

01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,048
Compliments of Mrs Massingale, sir.

1035
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:32,848
She has use of another tub, sir, and
she thought the colonel looked dirty, sir.

1036
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,645
Kind of scroungy and mucky, sir.

1037
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:38,761
And she thought... she sort of...

1038

Yes, sir.

- Colonel Gearhart, sir.
- Yes?

All sentries on their posts, sir. The Denver
militia has retired for the evening.

1041
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:05,767
- Where's Sergeant Buell?
- At the Indian camp with the interpreter.

1042
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,241
- That's all, Carter.
- Yes, sir.

Well?

1047
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,808
There might be a little confusion, sir.

1048
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,082
- Confusion?
- Confusion. Yes, sir.

1049
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:42,602
The interpreter was only sure they said
"Hunt buffalo in peace,

Would like to give you present."

01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,728
Yes, sir.

01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:18,122
What is it, Sergeant?
What happened, Sergeant?

1218
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:20,481
- The Indians have captured the women.
- What?

1219
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:23,285
One minute they were all
signing pledges and then...

1220
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,607
How did that idiot Slater
ever let it happen?

1221
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:28,849
On behalf of Captain Slater, sir,
it's only fair to state

1222
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:34,126
that if the women hadn't started singing
hymns and making all that... racket...

1223
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:42,203
Sir, the Indians disarmed my men
and took the ladies captive.

1224
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,243
I know what they did, Slater.

1225
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:48,001
They moved fast, we were outnumbered,
there was nothing I could do.

1226
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:49,724
- Sergeant.
- Sir!

1227
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:52,571
Alert the bugler. Rouse the camp.
Prepare for battle.

1228
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:58,050
Yes, sir! Sir, any rash move on our part
may endanger the lives of the women.

1229
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:01,403
- Dammit, I can't just twiddle my thumbs.
- No, sir!

1230
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,522
Sir, the sergeant's right, sir.

1231
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:07,281
An attack right now might be
most ill-advised... sir.

1232
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:12,686
- Why is he here?
- He's a symbol of their good faith.

1233
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,609
Good faith?

1234
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:17,200
- They wanna bargain with us.
- Bargain?

1235
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:20,642
20 wagons of whiskey
in exchange for the women.

1236
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:23,969
- 20 wagons?
- Yes, sir. You see, the Indians...

1237
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:29,126
- Can he understand us?
- Not a word, sir.

1238
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:31,846
20 wagons comes out to about...

1239
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,446
three and seven-eighths women
per wagon.

1240
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:38,689
I think that was it, or maybe
the interpreter was confused.

1241
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:39,767
- Slater.
- Yes, sir.

1242
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:43,965
There's only one course of action now.
I am declaring martial law!

1243
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:51,246
I say you can't do it! No tinhorn colonel's
gonna come here and declare martial law.

1244
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:54,523
If you don't shut up, Mr Wallingham,
my first step will be to lock you up.

1245
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:57,723
Gentlemen, this bickering
can lead to nothing constructive.

1246
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,162
Since you cannot take
military action against the Indians

1247
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:05,683
and you cannot negotiate with them, there
is only one course of action open to us.

1248
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:09,600
We must accede to their demands
and give them the whiskey without delay.

1249
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:12,007
Giving whiskey to Indians
is strictly forbidden

1250
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:15,169
by the army regulations
so dear to you, Mrs Massingale.

1251
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:17,521
Not if the Indians don't drink the whiskey.

1252
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:20,166
What's to stop the Indians
from drinking whiskey?

1253
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:21,770
Precisely.

1254
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:25,009
I have their pledges.
One hundred signed pledges

1255
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:29,170
with this one on the top signed by
Chief 5 Barrels himself. That's his mark.

1256
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,601
She's right. That's his mark.

1257
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:33,449
Do they get the whiskey?

1258
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:36,530
It's my whiskey, and you're not
going to touch one drop of it!

1259
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:38,483
- Listen, Frank...
- Quiet!

1260
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:42,685
In that case, I have no choice but to
destroy all the whiskey right now.

1261
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,245
You're bluff in'.

1262
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:46,601
Oh...

1263
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:48,688
Am I?

1264
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:52,249
There is a woman hidden in each
and every one of those wagons,

1265
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:56,649
awaiting my order by code to start
smashing the barrels of this vile cargo.

1266
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:58,967
Madam, you lie.

1267
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:00,730
Indeed?

1268
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,482
Ladies of Group B...

1269
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:11,802
Frank, will you keep your pants hitched?

1270
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:17,211
The signal was to be a hymn, but that's
not necessary. I'll just tell them to begin.

1271
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:20,802
- You wouldn't do that.
- Ladies of Group B, you may begin!

1272
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:23,048
Puncture those barrels!

1273
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,766
- No, wait!
- Just a moment, ladies!

1274
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:34,131
You let her smash one barrel and I'll have
those brass buttons ripped off your chest!

1275
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:37,722
- I'm a taxpayer and a good Republican!
- You say that one more time

1276
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:40,366
and I'll bust you right in the nose!

1277
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:43,006
- Are you threatening me?
- Now sit down!

1278
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:46,488
- You hear that?
- Sit down! Come on, Frank. Sit down.

1279
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:52,002
And shut up!

1280
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,801
Mrs Massingale, sit down.

1281
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:00,488
Sit down!

1282
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,082
And stay down.

1283
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:26,644
Ladies of Group B,
get out of those wagons!

1284
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:29,128
Right now!

1285
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,807
- Sergeant, put this down.
- Yes, sir.

1286
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:48,164
The United States Army confiscates
20 wagons of the Wallingham train.

1287
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:51,124
There! You hear that?
Confiscation of private property,

1288
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:54,961
in which case I shall be repaid in full.
Go ahead, declare martial law.

1289
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:58,527
- Martial law to take effect at daybreak.
- You declare it right now!

1290
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:01,450
Don't you tell me
when to declare martial law.

1291
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:06,410
Slater. Take that symbol of good faith
back to Chief 5 Barrels.

1292
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:09,126
And, Slater, knock down the price.

1293
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:15,847
- Buell.
- Sir!

1294
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:17,928
This meeting stands adjourned.

1295
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:28,051
Get outta here!

1296
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:30,925
Go on! Get outta here,
you bunch of vandals!

1297
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:33,008
Get off of my property!

1298
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:35,762
Get off of my bed! Get outta here!

1299
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:56,882
Get outta that wagon! Get outta there!

1300
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:00,648
Out! Out!

1301
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:13,488
<i>(laughs)</i>

1302

I thought I heard ya, Frank. (Chuckles)

1303
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:20,122
He, he, he...

1304
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:22,607
You got me into this, you soothsaying sot.

1305
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:26,691
And now I'll get you out of it, Frank.
In fact, it's all set.

1306
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:30,646
Everything's ready, except one
more chore I gotta do right now.

1307
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:34,481
Believe me, Frank,
you just trust old Oracle.

1308
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,285
Me and my Billy girl is gonna fix it all up.

1309
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,686
Come on now, Billy girl.
Take me slow and take me true.

1312
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,848
Go away!

1313
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:19,722
Madam, I don't know what you're up to,

1314
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,650
but whatever it is
I don't wanna hear about it.

1315
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:26,529
I've come to tell you how truly sorry
I am for what I've done.

1316
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:28,927
Thank you, and good night.

1317
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,281
Colonel, do you realise what will happen

1318
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:35,564
when word gets out that you've given
20 wagons of whiskey to Sioux Indians?

1319
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:37,409
I realise!

1320
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:40,967
20 wagons confiscated from
a taxpayer and a good Republican.

1321
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:44,004
Don't you tell me what he is
or I'll bust you on the nose!

1322
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:48,330
- Colonel, those cords again. Just let me...
- Get away from my cords!

1323
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:51,011
If you just relax and let the blood flow...

1324
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:53,282
My blood can flow on its own.

1325
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:58,402
Mrs Massingale, I don't know
what your plans are for tomorrow,

1326
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:01,410
but judging from experience,
you'd better get some rest.

1327
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:04,603
How can I rest
after what I've done to you?

1328
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,688
Try!

1329
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:19,008
<i>(sobbing)</i>

1330
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:25,768
Oh...

1331
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:45,166
My selfishness, my obstinacy,

1332
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:47,965
my stupidity in not listening
to your advice.

1333
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:49,809
I must agree with you.

1334
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:54,721
- It's all my fault you're in this position.
- Well, crying isn't going to help.

1335
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,729
Mrs Massingale...

1336
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,522
Mrs Massingale!

1337
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:19,608
You needn't look so shocked.

1338

Plato, Augustus, Alexander...

1339
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:29,249
even George Washington took
occasional spirits in medicinal amounts.

1340
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:35,409
There's nothing wrong with limited
libation under emotional stress.

1341
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:41,087
Your entire career is ruined!

1342
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:45,809
Well... I suppose
there'll be some criticism.

1343
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:48,361
Criticism? You'll be crucified!

1344
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:52,689
The press, the public,
the War Department.

1345
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:55,448
Horace Greeley.

1346
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:58,608
Oh...

1347
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:13,524
Well, if I can save the lives of 27 women,
I... I'd gladly sacrifice my career.

1348
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:17,167
After all, what is it?
Only 19 years of service.

1349
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:20,723
With Grant at Vicksburg.
With Thomas at Nashville.

1350
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:24,003
17 Indian campaigns,
Laramie to Fort Hall.

1351
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,888
One more year.

1352
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:32,764
281 dollars and 25 cents a month,
pension.

1353
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:37,526
Sergeant Buell,
27 dollars and 50 cents a month.

1354
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:41,167
Every month.

1355
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:43,248
19 years.

1356
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:48,926
And all that time, not once have I ever...

1357
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:52,328
never have I ever met anyone like...

1358
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:55,002
Like me?

1359
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:59,768
Oh, well, I'll just resign gracefully.
Anyway, I'll resign.

1360
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:03,571
Well, at least you'll still
have your beloved West.

1361
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:05,842
- I hate the West.
- Oh, dear!

1362
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:08,327
Dust, wind, Indians.

1363
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:14,569
My stubbornness, my obstinacy,
my selfishness.

1364
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:17,001
Now, now, Cora... uh... Mrs Massingale.

1365
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:19,327
If only I'd listened to you. If only!

1366
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:22,724
Easy, easy, Mrs Massingale... Cora.

1367
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:25,684
Do you think you could
ever forgive me, Thaddeus?

1368
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,962
Well, l...

1369
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:43,605
I could try.

1370
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:52,648
Cora...

1371
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:56,364
Couldn't we forget all this? I mean...

1372
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:03,326
I mean... just forget
the whole thing... Cora?

1373
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:06,205
- Colonel Gearhart!
- One moment, Slater.

1374
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:18,408
Come in, Slater.

1375
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:26,565
- Captain Slater reporting, sir.
- ♪ Stand up, we'll march to Denver.

1376
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:31,041
- ♪ No more wine or beer.
- Someone's singing. Go on, Slater.

1377
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:34,446
Uh... Chief 5 Barrels
said he'd take 15 barrels.

1378
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,767
I came back with eight and he said 13.

1379
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:41,286
I think that was the number.
The language barrier is very difficult, sir.

1380
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:44,563
- Did you reach any agreement?
- 10 wagons of whiskey.

1381
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:46,170
- 10 wagons?
- For all the women.

1382
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:48,123
- Good work, Slater.
- Thank you, sir.

1383
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:52,165
- What's he doing here?
- The same, sir. A symbol of good faith.

1384
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:59,240
Are you sure he can't understand us?

1385
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,601
- Not a word.
- That's all, Slater.

1386
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:10,682
Oh... The Indians
would like to have... uh...

1387
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,883
Mrs Massingale present
for the exchange, sir.

1388
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:18,400
- What for?
- Our symbol of good faith.

1389
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:22,966
Tell Chief 5 Barrels I'd be happy
to join my brave ladies.

1390
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:29,325
Yes, ma'am. I'll make all
the arrangements for the exchange. Sir.

1391
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:31,681
Good night, Slater.

1392
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:33,768
It's scheduled for dawn.

1393
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:42,370
Oh...

1394
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:45,211
Thaddeus, isn't it wonderful? 10 wagons.

1395
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:48,130
That's the exact number
held by the Irish teamsters.

1396
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:53,007
You're not gonna have to confiscate
any of Mr Wallingham's wagons after all.

1397
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,728
Yes... well...

1398
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:58,969
It's a long day tomorrow, Cora,
and you need rest.

1399
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:01,048
I'll take you back to your camp.

1400
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:06,730
- Oh...
- Oh, I can get back by myself.

1401
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:10,242
- You're sure?
- Oh, Thaddeus...

1402
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:14,649
You're so kind and generous... and brave.

1403
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:22,528
Good night, Thaddeus.

1404
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:28,961
♪ Stand up, we'll march to Denver

1405
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:31,926

01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:44,208

01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,968

01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:54,120
- ♪ Hallelujah.
- Frank.

1410
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:56,288
- Huh?
- Frank, she's all fixed up.

1411
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:00,682
- What?
- Frank, listen carefully. This is important.

1412
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,962
Frank! Hey, Frank!

1413
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:06,922
You've been drinkin'.

1414
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:11,568
Frank, listen carefully. If you could
get your wagon train outta here,

1415
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:17,323
if you could cross the river so as nobody,
no lnjuns, women or army could follow,

1416
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:19,920
would you do it?

1417
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:22,042
- How?
- Wait a minute!

1418
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:25,130
You'd have to give up
them 10 wagons on the exchange.

1419
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:28,130
Now, here's what we do.
We take the rest of the wagons

1420
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:31,847
and we ride across Quicksand Bottoms.
None of them people could see us.

1421
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:33,928
- Hold it.
- We'd get across the river...

1422
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:36,964
Hold on! Just a damn minute now.

1423
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:40,482
Nobody can cross Quicksand Bottoms
cos they'd sink.

1424
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:43,809
We can. There's a way, Frank.

1425
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:46,366
I found it five years ago.

1426
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:50,849
A bunch of scalp-hungry lnjuns
chased me right up to the edge.

1427
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:54,248
I knew for sure they'd get me
that night if I didn't get across.

1428
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:58,968
I just pointed my Billy girl south
and let her go. She didn't miss a step.

1429
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:03,201
I did the same thing tonight.
She took me right across.

1430
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:09,687
I've staked out a trail across the Bottoms
with my red flannel. We can't miss it.

1431
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:15,125
We'll take all the wagons you got and go
across, a-pullin' up the stakes as we go.

1432
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:17,846
They won't even know
what happened to us.

1433
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:23,126
Once across the Bottoms, it's a straight
shoot to Denver over flat, open country.

1434
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:26,767
- We'll be free and clear.
- (Wallingham chuckles)

1435
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:31,090
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
- Sh! Hush up!

1436
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:34,444
Yeah... My sentiments exactly.

1437
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:37,448
Hallelujah.

1438
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:40,728
Here's one.

1439
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,408
Here's another one.

1440
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:51,682
Here...

1441
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:54,007
and here's one.

1442
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:56,851
- But what are they?
- I don't know.

1443
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:00,806
- But does it look familiar?
- It looks like Mr Jones' underwear.

1444
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:04,208
- It is.
- Are you... are you sure?

1445
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:08,530
The ladies have confirmed it. He's not
wearing those underdrawers now.

1446
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:13,851
They're torn to shreds and spread out
on stakes all across Quicksand Bottoms.

1447
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:18,243
- Where's Group C?
- (whistles)

1448
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:24,610
Mrs Massingale, have you any idea
what these stakes are for?

1449
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:27,610
I'm not sure, but I know
what we're gonna do with them.

1450
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:30,041
- What?
- Move them.

1451
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:03,604
Stay between those red markers.
Don't be a-laggin' behind.

1452
02:01:03,720 --> 02:01:05,688
Keep your wagons up close, all of ya!

1453
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:08,770
Militia, when we move out,
get on the wagons.

1454
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:15,768
That's the signal, sir. All wagons ready for
exchange. Platoons A and B in position.

1455
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:20,249
Get down there, Buell. Send Mrs
Massingale over to the exchange point.

1456
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:26,361
- Mrs Massingale!
- Whoa, whoa!

1457
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:29,802
- Mrs Massingale, excuse me.
- I'm busy right now, Mr O'Flaherty.

1458
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:32,890
- It's about them 10 wagons.
- What's the matter with them?

1459
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,607
- Nothing, mum, but they ain't whiskey.
- Ain't whiskey?

1460
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:40,566
No, mum. Those wagons is filled
with French champagne. All of 'em.

1461
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:43,650
You know anything about
French champagne, mum?

1462
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:46,969
Well, I sipped some once
on my second honeymoon in Paris.

1463
02:01:47,080 --> 02:01:50,482
Aye, but it was most likely cold.
These bottles ain't, they're warm.

1464
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:54,924
If you open a bottle of warm champagne,
especially when it's been shooken up,

1465
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:57,202
well, it's...

1466
02:01:58,280 --> 02:02:02,046
- You mean they explode?
- Like a Marsh gun, about a .58 calibre.

1467
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:04,925
We gotta handle those bottles
like dynamite.

1468
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:08,647
That's why they hired us Irish teamsters.
It's our business.

1469
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:11,570
What's gonna happen when
them savages get them wagons?

1470
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:13,921
What's gonna happen to that champagne?

1471
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:16,042
- Explosions?
- Right.

1472
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:18,162
I just thought someone oughta know.

1473
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:22,410
- Have you told Colonel Gearhart yet?
- Oh, no, mum. I've been afeard to.

1474
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:24,488
What's holding you up, Mrs Massingale?

1475
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:28,321
I'm sorry, Sergeant Buell.
Excuse me, Mr O'Flaherty.

1476
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:43,248
Mrs Massingale,
we have a bit of a problem.

1477
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:45,931
Chief 5 Barrels insists on
taking the first wagon,

1478
02:02:46,040 --> 02:02:49,886
and his two brothers-in-law
the second and third wagons,

1479
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:55,006
and Elks-Runner the fourth wagon. That
leaves nobody in charge on their side.

1480
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:57,202
Me in charge.

1481
02:02:57,320 --> 02:03:01,370
You? You speak our tongue?

1482
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:04,848
I speak with straight tongue.
Me in charge good. Drink later.

1483
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:07,884
We'll agree to your taking charge
on one condition,

1484
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,651
that I stay at the exchange point
the whole time.

1485
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:13,240
- Me there... whole time.
- Good.

1486
02:03:15,080 --> 02:03:17,242
One moment, please, Captain.

1487
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:25,528
Mrs Massingale, I'll never forgive
myself for having failed you.

1488
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:27,881
10 wagonloads of whiskey to the Indians.

1489
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,322
- I've destroyed the crusade.
- Not quite yet.

1490
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:33,602
- What?
- Give me a hatpin.

1491
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:37,288
Hatpin?

1492
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:40,809
Our goal is still in sight, Louise.
Courage, ladies!

1493
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:48,531
First three ladies, front and centre.

1494
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:53,283
There they go, sir.
Three women starting across...

1495
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:56,608
- Sir... sir!
- What's the matter?

1496
02:03:56,720 --> 02:04:00,566
That Massingale woman.
She's heading for the exchange point.

1497
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:06,088
- Why's that symbol of good faith there?
- I can't say, sir.

1498
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:14,651
- Roll the first wagon.
- First wagon... roll!

1499
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:45,008
What's he trying to do,
bolting out of there like that?

1500
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:50,090
- Roll wagon two.
- Wagon two... roll!

1501
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:53,768
Ladies, move out!

1502
02:04:55,240 --> 02:04:57,720
Wagon two, roll!

1503
02:04:59,480 --> 02:05:01,767
Next three ladies, front and centre.

1504
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,649
<i>(corks popping)</i>

1505
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:22,684
Tell 'em not to bolt like that.
Our teams'll get out of control.

1506
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:24,962
Tell those Indians not to bolt like that.

1507
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,248
<i>(popping)</i>

1508
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:10,570
- Roll wagon three.
- Wagon three, roll!

1509
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:15,200
Roll!

1510
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:17,927
Next three ladies, front and centre!

1511
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:23,048
Well, move out. Go!

1512
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:43,609
<i>(popping)</i>

1513
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:47,805
Don't let those idiots bolt that way.
