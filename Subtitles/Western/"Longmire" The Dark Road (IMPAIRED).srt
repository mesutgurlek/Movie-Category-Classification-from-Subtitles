Cheap place to live and, yes, a car.

Why'd you impound it, by the way?

One of the residents, Hannah Clausen...

323

...she was found dead a few nights ago.

Well, I can tell you
that her job wasn't the safest.

331
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,416
She was a dancer.

332
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:02,879
An exotic dancer.

00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,384
You saying she was a stripper?

334
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,292
She didn't want anyone
at the house knowing...

335
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,758
...so she asked me to
drive her to the club.

You can help me find the person
that did this.

Any chance you'd be able
to translate that for me?

"He who is not with me, is against me."

Yeah, looks familiar.

345
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,995
Sort of like the cottonwoods
you see along the Dark Road.

Sorry, Dark Road?

It's the road that leaves
straight out of Ashlan.

When you go on Rumspringa,
you have to walk down that road.
