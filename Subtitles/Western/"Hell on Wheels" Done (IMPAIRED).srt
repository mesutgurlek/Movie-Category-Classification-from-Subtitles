I'm here to invite you to President
Grant's gala this evening.

I ain't much for galas.

In celebration of the

I come to testify, Mr.
Romans, not socialize.

The President has asked for
you personally, Mr. Bohannon.

Your stay at the Willard
Hotel has been compensated.

Might I suggest you get
yourself checked in

on the railroad, Mr. Bohannon.

Ten miles in a single day, was it?

216

Who did you serve?

219
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,139
I rode under General
Nathan Bedford Forrest.

221

you boys at Bull Run.

us one hell of a steeplechase.

to more than a steeplechase, Colonel.

explaining the difference

a good Yankee from a bad one?

in form of stock or cash in
exchange for favorable legislation?

355
00:29:53,996 --> 00:29:55,963
The transcontinental railroad

356
00:29:57,466 --> 00:30:00,701
could not have been built
without Thomas Durant.

357

That wasn't an answer.

I'll ask again.

359
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:11,478
As a former employee
of the Union Pacific,

360
00:30:11,514 --> 00:30:13,847
did Thomas Durant ever
voice his intention to

361
00:30:13,883 --> 00:30:15,916
or offer any bribes to
an elected official?

362
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:21,055
The transcontinental railroad could not
have been built without Thomas Durant.

363
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:24,091
Mr. Bohannon, you have sworn an oath

364
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:26,860
before this committee
under penalty of perjury.

365
00:30:26,896 --> 00:30:31,832
We have a dozen Senators on record saying
Thomas Durant attempted to bribe them,

366
00:30:32,468 --> 00:30:35,235
are you disputing their
account of the facts?

367
00:30:36,005 --> 00:30:37,905
The fact I know to be true

368
00:30:38,674 --> 00:30:40,674
is that the transcontinental railroad

369
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,278
could not have been built
without Thomas Durant.

370

This committee has the authority
to hold you in contempt, Colonel.

371
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,283
You have the right to
detain me, Governor,

372
00:30:49,318 --> 00:30:51,151
but that won't change the fact

373
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,021
that the transcontinental railroad
could not have been built

390
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:56,817
Then they traded me to the Mojave
for three blankets and a horse.

391
00:31:57,253 --> 00:31:59,052
Three blankets and a horse.

392

The price of a human soul.

- Mmm.

395
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,896
So, the Mojave marked your
face and made you their slave.

396
00:32:08,931 --> 00:32:10,631
No. Not exactly.

Had me a Mojave sister and...

don't seem to fit right.

00:40:06,315 --> 00:40:10,383
but the one I witnessed
with my own eyes out West.

488
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:14,487
Five years ago,

489
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:18,158
the American people, torn apart by war,

490
00:40:18,193 --> 00:40:22,095
cried out into the darkness
and turned a hopeful ear

491
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,230
to the void for an answer.

492
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,500
Americans needed a dream

493
00:40:28,403 --> 00:40:29,903
and I gave them one.

494
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:36,643
A transcontinental
railroad that would unite

495
00:40:39,414 --> 00:40:41,981
Dreams don't come pretty,

496
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:44,217
they don't come clean

497
00:40:44,252 --> 00:40:46,386
and they sure as hell
don't come simple...

498
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:49,723
They come true.

499
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,059
Truth delivered by lies is no less true,

500
00:40:57,132 --> 00:41:02,335
and dreams made reality by f.

501
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:09,876
1,776 miles of iron track,

502
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:12,178
that is what I delivered!

503
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:16,549
Track upon which thousands
of wheels will now revolve

504
00:41:17,386 --> 00:41:21,388
carrying on their axles the
wealth of half the world.

505
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:25,358
Final Destination, San Francisco!

506
00:41:26,328 --> 00:41:28,294
DURANT: Drawn by the Iron Horse,

507
00:41:34,102 --> 00:41:37,804
announcing to the world
with its piercing scream

508
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:42,909
that we are a great people who
can accomplish great things.

509
00:41:45,614 --> 00:41:47,981
Yet the American people,

510
00:41:49,084 --> 00:41:52,786
driven by their cowardly
representatives in Washington,

511
00:41:53,288 --> 00:41:55,288
are in need of a villain.

512
00:41:56,057 --> 00:41:57,757
And so here I sit,

513
00:42:00,762 --> 00:42:02,262
elected by you,

514
00:42:03,865 --> 00:42:05,265
to play my part...

515
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:10,937
The part of the scapegoat.

516
00:42:12,474 --> 00:42:14,607
The patsy. Sent into the wilderness

517
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,677
so that men sitting in this room

518
00:42:17,712 --> 00:42:19,813
can lay their sins upon my back,

519
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:22,115
and claim they themselves are clean.

520
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:29,022
Men enjoying immunity while
enriching themselves on the backs

521
00:42:29,391 --> 00:42:33,126
of those who sacrificed everything

522
00:42:33,161 --> 00:42:39,161
to make manifest America's destiny.

523
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:41,745
Lives have been lost.

524
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,047
Men have been ruined.

525
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:48,685
I saw it, and I survived.

526
00:42:57,563 --> 00:43:03,233
I will not return from the wild
having made America's dream a reality

527
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:09,506
only to have six bureaucrats
in starched collars judge

528
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:13,743
the manner in which I
realized that dream.

529
00:43:18,217 --> 00:43:22,152
Put me on trial, lock me in prison,

530
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,189
erase me from the record.

531
00:43:30,128 --> 00:43:32,262
For history is written in pencil...

532
00:43:35,734 --> 00:43:40,770
And the truth is carved in
steel across this nation.

533
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:46,910
And one truth above
all others is this...

534
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:52,159
Without me and men like me,

535
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:56,052
your glorious railroad

536
00:43:57,222 --> 00:43:58,655
could never have been built.
