- Make it easy on yourself.

How unfortunate. But he will have to split it.

She used to fool around with snakes.

You mean, rattlesnakes?

955
01:02:21,175 --> 01:02:24,645
These snakes didn't rattle, they crooned.
She was the Queen of Egypt.

Yes, teacher.

That's what I thought you said,
and that's a very good question, too.

Addition is when you take one thing
and add it to another and you get two.

974
01:03:19,215 --> 01:03:22,844
Two and two is four and five will get you 10,
if you know how to work it.

975
01:03:23,335 --> 01:03:26,054
Anyway, it all adds up in the end...

Subtraction.

That's very simple.

For instance, a man has $100
and you leave him with $2.
