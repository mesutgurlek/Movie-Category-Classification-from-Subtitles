was flat as a pizza.

Right in the middle, where the

And Julius Caesar,
he was the big cheese.

Julius Caesar bestrode the world
like a colossus...

came right down on top of Gaul.

had the gall to defy Caesar's legions.

That the sky would fall
on their heads tomorrow.

Vitalstatistix, said:

Yesterday was tomorrow
the day before yesterday.

a potion brewed by the druid, Getafix.

It was this that made the Gauls
invincible, inexhaustible...

intolerable.
