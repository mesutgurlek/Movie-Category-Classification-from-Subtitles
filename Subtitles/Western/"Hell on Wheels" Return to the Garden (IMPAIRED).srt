00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:09,796
Isaac's gone to water the horses.

329
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:12,732
Brigham Young hopes you're
in church on Sunday morning,

330
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:16,468
front row, so he can
bless your marriage.

331
00:30:31,085 --> 00:30:33,752
My father would have wanted
me to keep my vow to you.

332
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,123
This ain't your head talking.

333
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:40,625
William is your son.

334
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:44,862
It ain't right for me
to keep him from you.

335
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:49,433
Pray on it.

336
00:30:58,211 --> 00:30:59,210
I will.

337
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,823
Throw your backs into it.

338
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:15,992
Listen here. This is slack work.

339
00:31:16,494 --> 00:31:18,260
Pick it up, else we miss a meal.

340
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:19,628
Why?

341
00:31:21,498 --> 00:31:23,698
Why we gotta work like
mule for the fat man?

342
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:28,070
'Cause it's your job, that's why.

343
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:32,440
And he break our backs,
steals our money.

344
00:31:34,078 --> 00:31:36,911
This ain't slavery time. We
ain't got to go along now.

345
00:31:39,949 --> 00:31:40,948
You're right.

346
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:43,717
To hell with the fat man.

347
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:46,654
We don't work for him.

348
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:48,656
We work for ourselves.

349
00:31:49,926 --> 00:31:51,892
I was tricked by the devil, that's true.

350
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:55,028
Was tempted by easy money.

351
00:31:55,864 --> 00:31:57,230
But freedom ain't easy.

352
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,500
So next time, we wait. We wait and see.

353
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:03,637
- We ain't got no money left for next time.

PSALMS: That's why we
need our jobs, fool.

355
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:08,775
So we can save up. Can't
let the devil beat us.

356
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:10,843
We'll just see what the
Lord got in store.

357
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,680
I'm done waiting on the Lord.

358
00:32:18,552 --> 00:32:22,554
What else you got, huh?
No bread. Nowhere to go.

359
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,224
No 40 acres and no mule.

360
00:32:25,892 --> 00:32:28,559
All you got is this job. Huh?

361
00:32:31,064 --> 00:32:32,263
It's all you got.

362
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:36,301
Now you pick up them damn shovels.

363
00:32:36,636 --> 00:32:37,735
And you work.

364
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:59,789
McGinnes is our only connection to
the labor market in the northeast.

365
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:04,761
More Freedmen, then. Buy out the
bonds from the southern prisons.

366
00:33:04,762 --> 00:33:07,263
We haven't kept up payment on
the Freedmen's bonds we have.

367
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:10,566
The prisons have refused
further business with us.

368
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:12,434
Thank you, Mr. Delaney.

369

This is what comes of nepism.

370
00:33:21,611 --> 00:33:24,179
The useless son-in-law

371

of my bloated former partner.

372
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:28,716
Well, what does he do all day?

373
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:31,753
Tap a ball of string around...

374
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:38,825
You need McGinnes if you want
the coal fields in Ogden.

(CLEARS THROAT)

376
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:47,034
Our schemes have left us with no
friends, New York, no allies.

377
00:33:48,437 --> 00:33:50,137
You need Mickey.

378

I'm right and you know it.

in Union Pacific Railroad.

380

Enough to buy you out
of the vice business

381
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:10,122
and set you on the road to legitimacy.

It's not all steaks and French wine.

384
00:34:18,632 --> 00:34:20,832
Ownership comes with responsibilities.

385
00:34:21,402 --> 00:34:22,867
And what kinds of responsibilities?

386
00:34:23,304 --> 00:34:25,937
Responsibilities suited to
a man of your background.

387
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:29,440
A man unafraid of back alleys.

388
00:34:30,643 --> 00:34:33,378
This is supposed to keep me from
them kinds of responsibilities.

It's not just the Dead Rabbits.

Every business is dirty.

Give me the stock.

392

I'll have your thousand workers out
to you by the end of the week.

Hmm.

394

You kept your word.

- Thank you.
- I ain't done it for you.

396

You take your hat off at the table.
