00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,119
my father, your grandfather...

167
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:41,250
shot for cowardice the son
of a United States senator.

168
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:42,657
That was his duty.

169

I will do mine.

170

You've chosen my way of life.

I hope you have the guts
to endure it.

172
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,402
But put out of your mind...

173
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:56,874
any romantic ideas
that it's a way of glory.

174
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:59,240
It's a life of suffering
and of hardship...

to your oath and your duty.

permission to speak?

yes.

I didn't ask
to come to this regiment, sir...

179
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:13,357
but I wouldn't have it otherwise
now that I'm here.

180
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:15,791
May I also
put something straight?

181
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:16,919
Proceed.

I'm not in this post
to call you father.

183

I was ordered here
as Trooper Jefferson Yorke...

as of now.

KIRBY:
What are you waiting for?

193
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,256
Trooper Yorke expects his salute
to be returned.

194

When I was a young man
like yourselves...

208
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:48,782
I could jump nine feet tall...

with an Indian under each arm.

There, you see?

221
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,955
That gives you an idea
what horsemanship is like...

222
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:25,216
in the United States Cavalry.

223

Now after that
comes the Roman teams.

That's easy.

225

It's the way the Romans
used to ride.

That's the general idea...

with youse...

wants to make a routine check.

might be among our new recruits.

KIRBY: You mean Quincannon?

388
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:15,054
He is a sergeant major
in the United States Army.

Anything he may have done
long ago in the line of duty...

KATHLEEN:
Oh. The reluctant arsonist.

393

KATHLEEN: The safest way for
us to start our conversation...

394
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,627
would be for you to just say...

"To what do I owe the honor
of your visit?"

KATHLEEN: How is he?

KIRBY: He's grown considerably,
I thought.

399
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,798
Right now he's bruised up
a little.

400

Had a fight. Not much.

401
00:29:04,408 --> 00:29:06,103
KATHLEEN: A fight?

With another soldier.

403
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:09,406
KIRBY: Hardly an officer.

404
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,309
KATHLEEN:
Hardly with an officer?

405
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,681
He's not gentleman enough
for that.

406
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:17,721
KIRBY: You said it... soldier.
That's enough for me.

Not for me.

Jeff was boyishly ashamed when
he was expelled from West Point.

409
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,689
He shouldn't have enlisted.

410
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:27,697
I could have sent him
to Lexington.

411
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,392
He could have tutored
in mathematics...

412
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,401
and then got his commission.

413
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,666
But he did enlist,
and he's here.

He signed enlistment papers.
He took an oath.

from the army...

for the sum of $100.

You forget
one very important detail.

00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:13,743
A release requires my signature
as commanding officer.

427
00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:20,044
You've overlooked several other
important details.

on charges of manslaughter.

649
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:20,066
TYREE: The way that sounds,
I must be arrested.

650
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:22,264
PRESCOTT: As Colonel Yorke
is not present...

651
00:52:22,338 --> 00:52:24,499
you will await his signature
before taking him.

652
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,474
MARSHAL: Any place I can lock
this soldier boy up...

653
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:28,972
till the paperwork's signed?

654
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:32,947
DOC: With a fella like this,
I mean a desperado...

655
00:52:33,516 --> 00:52:35,211
why not leave him
at the hospital?

656
00:52:35,284 --> 00:52:37,718
MARSHAL: That's a good idea.
Get my feet checked.

657
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:39,448
They've been bothering me.

658
00:52:39,655 --> 00:52:41,452
You want to come along
peaceful-like...

659
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:44,057
or want me
to use these cuffs on you?

660
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,150
TYREE: I'm always peaceful,
marshal.

661
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,163
Ain't no use doing nothing else.

662
00:52:49,098 --> 00:52:50,656
TYREE: Excuse me, ma'am.

663
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,136
KATHLEEN: You're arresting
that nice man for manslaughter?

664
00:52:55,204 --> 00:52:56,728
PRESCOTT: Not me, Mrs. Yorke.

665
00:52:56,772 --> 00:52:59,172
The United States
Deputy Marshal.

666
00:53:02,278 --> 00:53:04,041
KATHLEEN: Manslaughter.

667
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:07,480
KATHLEEN: What are you going
to do about it?

668
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:10,709
A gentle soul who'd walk
10 miles out of his way...

669
00:53:10,786 --> 00:53:12,083
before he'd step on an ant.

670
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:13,281
[Spits]

671
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,351
KATHLEEN:
You go to the hospital.

672
00:53:16,425 --> 00:53:18,359
Get him some tobacco,
anything he wants.

673
00:53:18,427 --> 00:53:20,486
And we'll get him a lawyer
to defend him.

674
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,357
JEFF: He's partial
to molasses candy.

675
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:23,693
KATHLEEN: Get some.

676
00:53:26,435 --> 00:53:28,733
KATHLEEN: Yankee justice.

677
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:32,972
Arresting a nice young man
like that for manslaughter...

678
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:36,341
and promoting arsonists
to be sergeant majors!
