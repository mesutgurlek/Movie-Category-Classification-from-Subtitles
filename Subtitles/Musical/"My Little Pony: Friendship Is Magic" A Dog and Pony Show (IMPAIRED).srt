1
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:11,333
Rarity: Perfect!

2
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:12,875
(door opens, bell rings)

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,458
Rarity: (singsong) Coming!

4
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:19,308
Welcome to Carousel Boutique, where every garment is chic, unique, and magnifique!

5
00:00:19,308 --> 00:00:20,558
(shocked gasp)

6
00:00:20,558 --> 00:00:24,474
(gushing, shrieking) Sapphire Shores! The Pony of Pop!

7
00:00:24,474 --> 00:00:27,558
Sapphire Shores: (theatrical tone) Good afternoon, Miss Ra-ri-tee!

8
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:30,891
Rarity: (stammering) You, yuh...y-y-you know my name?!

9
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:32,531
Sapphire Shores: Well, of course I do, darling.

10
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:39,156
I make it a point to know all of the up-and-coming 
 designers, and Clothes Horse Magazine simply RAVED about you!

11
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:43,406
Rarity: Oh my stars...If I'm dreaming, do NOT wake me up!

12
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:45,948
How may I help you, Miss (voice breaking) Shores?

13
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:48,630
Sapphire Shores: Oh please, call me Sapphire.

14
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:52,214
Rarity: (giggles) How may I help you, SAPPHIRE?

15
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:56,714
Sapphire Shores: Well, as I'm sure you know, I'll be 
 touring all of Equestria with my latest concert,

16
00:00:56,714 --> 00:01:05,271
"Sapphire Shores' Zigfilly Follies," so I need to look (hamming) SEEENSAATIONAL! OW!

17
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:07,146
Rarity: I have just what you need!

18
00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:12,230
Sapphire Shores, prepare yourself for the piece de résistance de la haute couture!

19
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:14,355
(harp flourish)

20
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:18,286
I used every last diamond I found on this one garment!

21
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:23,120
Sapphire Shores: (gasps) And it is SPECTACULAR! I'll take it.

22
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:24,286
Rarity: Really?

23
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:28,036
Sapphire Shores: Oh, yes, and five more, each done up in a different jewel.

24
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:29,870
Rarity: (dumbstruck) Beg pardon?

25
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:31,087
Sapphire Shores: Costume changes.

26
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,636
(Rarity faints theatrically)

27
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:38,052
(chuckles, smugly) Yes, I do have that effect on ponies.

28
00:01:40,403 --> 00:01:46,086
(theme song begins) My Little Pony, My Little Pony, ah, ah, ah, ah,

29
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:51,008
(My Little Pony) Twilight: I used to wonder what friendship could be

30
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:55,031
(My Little Pony) Until you all shared its magic with me

31
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,026
Rainbow Dash: Big adventure
Pinkie Pie: Tons of fun

32
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:59,063
Rarity: A beautiful heart
Applejack: Faithful and strong

33
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:01,051
Fluttershy: Sharing kindness
Twilight: It's an easy feat

34
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:03,088
All: And magic makes it all complete, yeah

35
00:02:03,878 --> 00:02:12,033
(My Little Pony) Do you know, you're all my very best friends

36
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:20,069
Spike: (gushing) Oh my gosh, Sapphire Shores! The Pony of Pop!

37
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:24,003
She is AWESOME! I mean, she's gorgeous, and talented, and, heh...

38
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:27,056
(sheepishly) ...and not even half the pony you are.

39
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:31,005
(sucking up) I mean, you're ten times more gorgeous, and talented, and...

40
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:33,074
Rarity: (strained) Spike, a lady is NEVER jealous.

41
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:37,008
Spike: Er, uh, of course not. But were you TOTALLY flipping out or what?!

44
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:48,000
I need to find more jewels than ever before to decorate her costume.

45
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:51,043
Ooh, ooh...AHA!

46
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:52,022
Spike: Did you find some?

47
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:53,071
Rarity: Yes, Spike! Right there!

48
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:58,031
(Spike digging)

49
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:02,076
Spike: Oooooh! (licks lips noisily)

50
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:08,015
(entranced) You look so...delicious! (drools)

51
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:10,043
Rarity: (admonishing) Spike!

52
00:03:10,427 --> 00:03:13,044
I promised I'd give you gems to snack on,

53
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:17,058
but we need to collect more first or I'll never 
 be able to make these outfits for Sapphire.

54
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,044
(Spike sighs heavily)

55
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:22,002
Spike: I will miss you, my sweets.

56
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:25,047
Rarity: Come along, Spike. We have many jewels to find.

57
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,010
Spike: At your service, milady.

58
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:42,042
Rarity: Spike!

59
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:58,005
(jackhammer pounding dirt)

60
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:00,042
(Spike shudders happily)

61
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,086
(Spike slurping and drooling noisily)

62
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:08,041
Rarity: You've been very patient today, Spike. And 
 for that, you get the finest reward.

63
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:11,015
This is from me to you.

64
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,037
Is something wrong, Spike?

65
00:04:17,138 --> 00:04:20,090
Spike: No. It's perfect.

66
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:26,033
Rarity: Ooh! Bring the cart, Spike! There are more over here!

67
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:30,095
Spike: For me...from Rarity.
(Spike's heart beats loudly, pigeon cooing)

68
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:38,027
Diamond dog leader: (lisping a la LotR's Gollum) Yesss, gemsss. Gemsss! Our preciousss gemsss!

69
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:44,079
He is the gem hunter. With him, we 
 can have all those gems, and more!

70
00:04:44,793 --> 00:04:48,055
Let's get the dragon.

71
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,067
Rarity: (singsong) Spike? Where are you?
Leader: What?! Who is that?

72
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,001
Rarity: You know, it's terrible to keep a lady waiting.

73
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,084
Spike: Coming!

74
00:04:57,842 --> 00:05:04,011
Rarity: I think we're REALLY going to strike gold this time...so to speak. (giggles)

75
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:05,092
Spike: JACKPOT!

76
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:10,089
Leader: Oh, it's not the DRAGON we want. It's the PONY!

77
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:13,063
Diamond dogs: The pony...

78
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:15,095
Rarity: Well, Spike, I think that's all we can do for today.

79
00:05:15,954 --> 00:05:18,088
And these will get me well on my way with Sapphire's outfits.

80
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:22,083
Why don't we start headi-oh! What's this? Another jewel!

81
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:25,085
Oh, strange. It's in the trees.

82
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:28,072
(entranced) Ohhh... (startled) EWW!

83
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:32,067
(stumbling over words) Er, uh...good day, gentle, uh, fellow.

84
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:35,064
I am Rarity, and this is my friend Spike.

85
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:36,057
(Spike chuckles nervously)

86
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,052
Rarity: And you are...?

87
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:40,043
Leader: A diamond dog.

88
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:44,019
Rarity: (stalling) Oh, really? Oh, well, that explains your fine taste in jewelry.

89
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:50,069
(trembling) I mean, I-I know diamonds are a girl's best friend, and 
 now I know they're a dog's best friend, too. (giggles nervously)

90
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:53,029
So, um. (clears throat nervously) You out hunting for gems as well?

91
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:55,075
Leader: Yes, we hunt.

92
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:56,091
Rarity: Er, "we?"

93
00:05:56,914 --> 00:06:01,014
Leader: We hunt for gems, but YOU are a better hunter.

94
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:04,016
(dirt shifting)
So now we hunt...FOR YOU.

95
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:05,088
(dogs burst out of ground)

96
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:07,013
(Rarity shrieks, paw swipes air)

97
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:10,071
(jackhammer pounding, diamond dog yelps)

98
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:13,072
Spike: Run, Rarity! Run!

99
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:14,070
(Spike yelps)

100
00:06:18,183 --> 00:06:21,054
(diamond dogs yell, crash into ground in turn)

101
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:24,021
Rarity: Spike! Come on! Hurry!

102
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,067
Leader: Gotcha!
Rarity: (shrill scream) SPIKE!

103
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:27,067
Spike: (straining) I got 'im, Rarity! I got 'im!

104
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:31,060
Big dog: (derisive laugh) Nope!

105
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,052
Small dog: Sorry, scaly one!

106
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:36,047
Spike: Wait! Rarity...?

107
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:38,031
Rarity: Unhand me this instant, you ruffians!

108
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:41,039
Stop! Put me down, you scum! You rough- (trails off)

109
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:42,097
Spike: (gasps) Rarity!

110
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:47,057
Rarity: Spike! (repulsed scream) Dirt! (screams) SPIKE!

111
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,082
Spike: Which, what, where?!

112
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:51,012
Rarity: (echoing) SAVE MEEEE!

113
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:55,045
Spike: NOOOOOOOOO!

114
00:06:58,574 --> 00:07:01,012
(Spike hyperventilating into paper bag)
Twilight: Spike! Can you breathe now?

115
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:04,076
Spike: (hyperventilates) ...Yes, (inhales sharply) I think so.

116
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:06,067
Twilight: Good. Now, tell us what you know.

117
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:08,084
Rainbow Dash: Yeah, 'cuz all you said earlier was:

118
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:13,021
Spike: (in flashback, rapid, panicky speech) AAAAH! Rarity, 
 woods, jewels, dogs, hole, taken, SAVE HER!

119
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:16,076
Applejack: Not a whole lot t'go on there, Sport.

120
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:20,094
Spike: Sorry. Rarity and I were in the woods looking 
 for jewels when these creepy guys showed up.

121
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:21,098
Twilight: "Creepy guys?"

122
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:23,094
Spike: They called themselves, the "diamond dogs."

123
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:26,056
They grabbed Rarity and disappeared down a hole in the ground!

124
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:28,060
Applejack: Well, that sounds mighty easy.

125
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:30,094
Just take us to that there hole and we'll save Rarity!

126
00:07:30,938 --> 00:07:34,050
(ponies gasp in turn)

127
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,050
Pinkie Pie: Holy moly, that's a lotta holeys.

128
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:39,083
Twilight: Come on, girls! Let's get started.

129
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,070
(echoing) Hello...?

130
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:49,084
(low growl)

131
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,001
(Twilight gasps, gags, spits)

132
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:54,018
(Rainbow Dash grunts)

133
00:07:54,177 --> 00:07:57,034
(Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, and Spike gasp in turn)

134
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,097
(holes filling with dirt)

135
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:03,034
Twilight: Quick! We gotta get down one before they're all filled up!

136
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:07,057
Fluttershy: (as holes fill up) Oh! Oh my. Oh! Oh!

137
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:13,015
(Pinkie Pie grunts)

138
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:18,053
(Applejack strains, yelps)

139
00:08:18,527 --> 00:08:20,011
Applejack: We can't muscle through 'em!

140
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:22,002
Rainbow Dash: We'll see about that.

141
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,031
(Rainbow Dash gasps)

142
00:08:29,306 --> 00:08:31,049
Applejack: Whew...Heavens to Betsy.

143
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:33,097
Now, I'm used t'pickin' myself up and dustin' myself off,

144
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:36,053
but Rarity won't even TOUCH mud 'less it's imported.

145
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:38,029
Twilight: (anxious) Oh, Rarity...

146
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:40,073
(harp flourish, wipe to imagination)

147
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:46,026
Rarity: Oh, woe is me! What EVER shall I do?

148
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:51,097
(screams) Dirt, dirt! Get away, dirt!

149
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:54,085
Make it stop, make it stop! (screams)

150
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:58,033
Filthy, disgusting dirt. It stings. It BURNS!

151
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:02,065
Help! Oh, somepony save me, SAVE ME... (trails off)

152
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:05,034
Applejack: We gotta save 'er.

153
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,007
Fluttershy: But they blocked up all the holes.

154
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:10,068
Applejack: Don't mean we can't dig 'em out. Come on!

155
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:17,000
Pinkie Pie: OW!

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,007
(crash)

157
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,041
(Fluttershy grunts)

158
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:25,001
(Spike panting, yelps, crashes and grunts)

159
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:28,049
Rainbow Dash: GET 'EM!

160
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:30,049
(Rainbow Dash grunts)

161
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:40,048
(Applejack grunts repeatedly)

162
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:41,082
(Applejack gasps)

163
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:45,012
Pinkie Pie: Whoooa!

164
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:49,067
(ponies grunt and crash into ground)

165
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:50,051
Rainbow Dash: Go get 'em!

166
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,097
(Twilight yelps, crashes)

167
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:57,084
(all panting in exhaustion)

168
00:09:57,844 --> 00:10:00,044
Fluttershy: All these scary monsters popping up everywhere...

169
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:03,074
Fluttershy: Oh, poor Rarity must be terrified!
Twilight: Oh...

170
00:10:03,742 --> 00:10:05,041
(imagination wipe)

171
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:07,060
Small dog: Get me the baubles!
(Rarity yelps)

172
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:09,022
Big dog: Get me the beads!
(Rarity yelps)

173
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,087
Leader: Get me the trinkets!
(Rarity shrieks)

174
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:13,042
Dogs: WHERE IS THE TREASURE?!
(Rarity swoons)

175
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:16,095
Twilight: Poor Rarity. What are we gonna do?

176
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:21,097
Spike: I've GOT IT! (bravado) I'll save you, my sweet!

177
00:10:23,502 --> 00:10:24,066
Ponies: Huh?

178
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:32,000
Twilight: Spike, it is very noble of you-
(Spike shushes Twilight)

179
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,074
(hushed) to sacrifice the gem Rarity gave you.

180
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:38,042
Spike: O Lady Rarity, my damsel in distress...

181
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:40,041
(in Spike's imagination)
Adult Spike: (same voice) I shall save you!

182
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,068
Show yourselves, you dogs! You curs!

183
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:47,091
(guttural growls)
Ah, there you are, you mangy mutts.

184
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:51,090
Leader: Who are you calling mutts?! UNLEASH THE HOUNDS!

185
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:53,094
(blows dog whistle inaudibly)

186
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,024
(dogs bark)

187
00:10:55,244 --> 00:11:05,014
(frenzied barking)

188
00:11:07,597 --> 00:11:11,022
(dogs whine)

189
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:15,038
(barking)

190
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:17,009
(dogs whine)

191
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,093
(barking)

192
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:22,078
(Spike breathes fire, dogs yelp)

193
00:11:24,064 --> 00:11:28,003
(Spike breathes fire)

194
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:31,000
Spike: (heroically) Now, where is Lady Rarity?

195
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:35,076
(door shatters)

196
00:11:37,017 --> 00:11:40,078
Rarity: Ah, Spike! I KNEW you would save me!

197
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:43,075
Spike: (modestly) Nothing could stop me, milady.

198
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:47,074
Rarity: (trembling coquettishly) O-o-o-oh Spike, you are my...hero.

199
00:11:47,744 --> 00:11:50,011
(Rarity smacks lips noisily)

200
00:11:50,113 --> 00:11:51,083
Spike: Mmmm...

201
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,071
Applejack: (chuckling) Whoa-ho there, Lover Boy.

202
00:11:56,707 --> 00:12:01,068
Spike: Huh?! Whoa! Whoa whoa whoawhoawhoa! I've got a bite!

203
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:02,065
I got a bite!

204
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:04,032
Applejack: (grunts, mouth full) Hold on there, little fella!

205
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,088
Twilight: Applejack!

206
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:08,022
Rainbow Dash: Twilight!

207
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:11,015
Fluttershy: Oh my goodness, oh my goodness!

208
00:12:11,015 --> 00:12:14,012
Pinkie Pie: (unfazed) Wait for me! WHEEE!

209
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:22,062
(all screaming)

210
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:23,083
(Pinkie Pie laughs)

211
00:12:27,218 --> 00:12:30,042
(all grunt in turn as they crash into ground)

212
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:35,016
Spike: (voice echoing) Ha HA, it worked! We're 
 in! Now we can finally save Rarity!

213
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,032
Twilight: Um...which way do we go?

214
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:45,024
Spike: (echoing) NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

215
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:50,016
Twilight: All these tunnels...how are we ever gonna find Rarity?

216
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,099
Applejack: Guess we're just gonna have t'start goin' down 'em one by one.

217
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:56,050
Rainbow Dash: That could take forever! There's gotta 
 be a way to narrow it down.

218
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:59,098
Spike: I know! I bet they've taken Rarity 
 down the tunnel with the most gems!

219
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:03,093
Twilight: But Spike, Rarity's the only one who knows how to find gems.

220
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:08,039
Spike: No, Twilight, you can! You can copy Rarity's gem-finding spell!

221
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:12,057
Twilight: Oh my gosh. You're right! Rarity showed me 
 how she did it a while back.

222
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:14,068
If I can just remember...

223
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:17,065
(Twilight strains, horn poofs)

224
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:24,032
Spike: That's it! You did it, Twilight! Come on!

225
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:28,017
We're comin', Rarity! We'll save you! Just hold on!

226
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:32,016
Rarity: Oh please, diamond dogs. Please let me go.

227
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:35,009
Small dog: NO!
Big dog: You're our precious little pony.

228
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:38,002
Leader: FOREVER! (maniacal cackle)

229
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:40,006
Rarity: But whatever do you want from me?

230
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:44,047
Leader: (lisping) Gemsss!
Small dog: Yes, the gems, the jewels!

231
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:46,061
Big dog: Find them. Find them all!

232
00:13:46,607 --> 00:13:48,019
Rarity: (confidently) Oh. Is that all?

233
00:13:53,712 --> 00:13:58,064
There, a lovely pocket of jewels is right there. Now if 
 you'd be so kind as to show me the exit...

234
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:04,035
Leader: (amused cackle) Good! Now, dig them up, pony.

235
00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:08,030
Rarity: What? But you said you wanted me to FIND the gems.

236
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:11,022
Small dog: Yes! Find, and then dig.

237
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:14,001
Rarity: (dryly) Dig?
Big Dog: (exasperated grunt) Yes, dig.

238
00:14:17,954 --> 00:14:19,067
(aggrieved sigh)

239
00:14:19,672 --> 00:14:28,050
(Rarity paws at ground and whimpers lightly)

240
00:14:28,496 --> 00:14:31,070
Big dog: What are you doing?! We said DIG!

241
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:35,056
Rarity: (indignantly) Forgive me, but prior to you so 
 rudely dragging me into your dirt pit,

242
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:40,029
I had a pony pedi, and I am not about to 
 chip a hoof because you dislike my style of digging.

243
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:46,042
(Rarity paws at ground and whimpers)
Leader: Oh, for goodness... (groans)

244
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:48,098
Fine, just stop. Stop!

245
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:52,009
Dig, dogs! Dig! And fast.

246
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:55,006
(frenzied barking)

247
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:58,029
Big dog: (grunts) She won't dig, she pulls.

248
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:02,000
Rarity: I beg pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?!

249
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:05,062
Big dog: Others will dig. You will haul the wagon.

250
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,083
Small dog: (sardonically) Precious pony pedi will be preserved.

251
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:11,085
Rarity: Well, SOMEBODY certainly needs proper nail care.

252
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:14,012
When was the last time YOU two had a manicure?!

253
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:16,000
You're scratching up my coat with those jagged things!

254
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:18,033
Leader: (pleading) PLEASE BE QUIET!

255
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:21,053
Rarity: (repulsed) Good HEAVENS, what IS that smell?!

256
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,078
Leader: Smell?

257
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:26,096
Rarity: (dryly) Ah, mystery solved. It's your breath.

258
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:29,056
(leader breathes on hand and sniffs)

259
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:34,095
Leader: (frustrated) ENOUGH! SEARCH, PONY!

260
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:37,078
(cart drags along ground)
Rarity: Well, since you insist.

261
00:15:37,784 --> 00:15:40,090
But I must say, the working conditions in here are simply dreadful.

262
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:44,061
(dogs digging)
Musty and damp. It's going to wreak havoc on my mane.

263
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,093
And this air... (scoffs) ...suffocating.

264
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:50,060
And when I try to take a deep breath, the 
 scent of all you dogs makes me nauseated.

265
00:15:50,602 --> 00:15:52,023
(rock shatters, crashes into ground, dogs whimper)

266
00:15:52,227 --> 00:15:55,029
You look and smell like you haven't bathed in WEEKS.

267
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:56,092
Have you never heard of soap?

268
00:15:56,918 --> 00:15:59,063
(dogs sniffing each other)
You could all do with 
 a good round of soap and water.

269
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:03,016
Water, water...I'm terribly thirsty. Could I please have some water?

270
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:08,023
Small dog: (frazzled) Good gracious, I can't take this anymore! BE QUIET, PONY!

271
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:12,045
Rarity: (haughtily) And that's another thing. I would appreciate 
 it if you would stop calling me "pony."

272
00:16:12,452 --> 00:16:15,066
I am a lady, and I wish to be addressed as such.

273
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:19,032
So you can call me "Miss," or "Rarity," or "Miss Rarity."

274
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:23,060
Leader: ENOUGH! Your whining, it-it-it HURTS!

275
00:16:23,597 --> 00:16:26,090
Rarity: "Whining?" I am NOT whining. I am COMPLAINING.

276
00:16:26,895 --> 00:16:28,057
(ominously) Do you want to HEAR whining?

277
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:30,054
(shrill, exaggerated whining) Thiiis is whining!

278
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:33,014
Oh, this harness is too TIIIGHT!

279
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:34,040
It's going to chafe.

280
00:16:34,395 --> 00:16:35,060
Can't you loosen it?

281
00:16:35,602 --> 00:16:38,062
Oooh, it hurts, and it's (piercing) sooo rusty!

282
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:41,000
Why didn't you clean it first?!

283
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:42,007
It's gonna leave a staaain!

284
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:46,004
And the wagon's getting heavy, why do I have to pull it?!

285
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:47,008
Small dog: Aaah! Make it stop!

286
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,003
Leader: Stop whining!

287
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:53,003
Rarity: (indignant whining) But I thought you waaanted whiniiing!

288
00:16:53,342 --> 00:16:56,001
Leader: We'll do ANYTHING, pony!

289
00:16:57,568 --> 00:17:02,009
(nervously) Oh, uh, we'll do anything, "Miss Rarity." (sheepish chuckle)

290
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:04,004
Rarity: "Anything?"

291
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:16,000
This water is hardly sparkling, but I suppose it'll have to do.

292
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:24,002
(dogs groaning and straining)
Leader: ...Wait! Why are WE doing this?!

293
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:31,005
Small dog: To stop the awful noises from 
 the pony's mouth, remember? (imitates Rarity whining)

294
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:34,003
Leader: Yes, yes, I know! This is ridiculous!

295
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:36,006
Letting a pony order us around?!

296
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:38,007
What are we?! Mice or dogs?

297
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,008
Big and small dogs: (hesitantly) Mi-er, dogs?

298
00:17:42,243 --> 00:17:44,008
Leader: Dogs do not pull. Ponies pull.

299
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,000
Let her make the awful noises.

300
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:51,003
Rarity: Huh? What are you doing?! Hey! You spilled my drink!

301
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:55,007
Oh! (shrill, exaggerated whining) Not so tiiiiiiiiight!

302
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:59,004
Leader: Ha! Make the noises all you want! But MOVE while you make them!

303
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:00,007
Hyah, mule! (slaps Rarity)

304
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:05,008
Rarity: (tearing up) Did you just call me a..."mule?"

305
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:08,006
Leader: Eh...?

306
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:13,002
(sniffling, voice breaking) Mules are ugly. Are you saying that I, too, am ugly?

307
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:18,008
(Rarity sobs theatrically)
Small dog: What are THESE noises?!

308
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:24,008
Rarity: (whiny sobs) HE CALLED ME UGLY!
Leader: (defensively) No! Mule! I said "mule!"

309
00:18:24,782 --> 00:18:28,005
Rarity: An old ugly mule! And it's true!

310
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:29,008
Just look at me.

311
00:18:29,762 --> 00:18:34,006
I used to be beautiful, but, but, no-o-o-o-ow...!

312
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,002
Large dog: (henpecked) No, no! You're still beautiful, po-uh, Miss Rarity!

313
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:41,002
Rarity: You're just saying that!

314
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:43,007
Small dog: (tripping over words) No, you're still pretty, and...and...

315
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,005
Leader: Oh, uh, uh, nice! Yeah.

316
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:50,006
Rarity: I don't believe you! You never liked me!

317
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:56,008
(Rarity sobs loudly)
Leader: (groans) I've had just about enough of this.

318
00:19:00,843 --> 00:19:04,002
Twilight: We're getting close. I can feel it.

319
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:09,005
(Rarity's sobs echo through tunnels)
Spike: It's coming from down here! Come on!

320
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:15,001
(Rarity sobbing)
Rainbow Dash: She must be in there! Let's go-

321
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:16,001
(all yelp)

322
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:17,008
Dog: More workhorses!

323
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,005
(Applejack grunts)

324
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:24,009
Applejack: Ho, doggies. If you can take this bull by 
 the horns, you better be ready fer a ride.

325
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:27,006
Come on, ponies! Kick 'em up, kick 'em out!

326
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:30,000
Buck 'em up, buck 'em down!

327
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:36,009
(dogs yelping frantically as they are tossed about)

328
00:19:36,903 --> 00:19:40,009
Applejack: YEE-HAW! Git along, little doggies!

329
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:45,005
(cacophony issues forth from tunnel)

330
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:49,008
Spike: (bravado) I'm comin' for you, milady!

331
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:52,005
Hi-ho Twilight, AWAY!

332
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:55,003
Twilight: And just what do you think you're doing?

333
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:57,007
Spike: Please, Twilight. Just give me this.

334
00:19:57,732 --> 00:20:00,009
Twilight: (sighs) Fine. (neighs)

335
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:03,005
(door shatters)

336
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:07,000
Spike: Lady Rarity, I'm here to save you!

337
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:10,008
(dogs pleading with ponies to make Rarity stop)

338
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:11,004
Twilight: Excuse me...?

339
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:13,009
Small dog: So picky.
Big dog: And critical.

340
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:16,000
Small dog: She won't stop talking.
Big dog: And crying.

341
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:18,004
Leader: We, uh, give her back. Yes.

342
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:21,000
Spike: Rarity! You're safe!

343
00:20:20,998 --> 00:20:23,005
Rarity: (calmly) Why, yes. Hello, girls.

344
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:25,008
You arrived just in time to assist me.

345
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:27,005
Applejack: Assist you with what?

346
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:28,009
Rarity: With THOSE.

347
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:36,006
Spike: You're letting us leave? With all these...jewels?

348
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:40,005
Leader: (pleading) Yes, take them! And HER with them!

349
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:42,000
Small dog: PLEASE!

350
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,006
(dogs sigh)

351
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:49,006
Pinkie Pie: I can't believe you got all these gems!

352
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,007
Rainbow Dash: I can't believe you tricked all those dogs.

353
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:57,003
Rarity: Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean I 
 cannot handle myself in a sticky situation.

354
00:20:57,314 --> 00:21:00,003
I had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time.

355
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:04,002
Twilight: I can't wait to write to Princess Celestia 
 to tell her what you taught me today.

356
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:06,006
Rarity: (quizzically) Me? What did I teach you?

357
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,001
Twilight: Just because somepony is ladylike doesn't make her weak.

358
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:16,005
In fact, by using her wits, a seemingly defenseless pony can 
 be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all.

359
00:21:16,054 --> 00:21:18,006
Spike: Mm. "Outshines" is right.

360
00:21:18,642 --> 00:21:22,004
Now you have enough gems to cover Sapphire Shores' costumes.

361
00:21:22,438 --> 00:21:24,009
Rarity: Not if you eat them all, Spike.

362
00:21:24,853 --> 00:21:29,001
(Spike yelps, ponies laugh)

363
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:32,001
(ending theme begins) My Little Pony

364
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:36,003
My Little Pony

365
00:21:38,553 --> 00:21:47,003
(instrumental)

366
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:53,008
My Little Pony, friends
