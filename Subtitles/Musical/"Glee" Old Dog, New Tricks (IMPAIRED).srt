00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:01,572
<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

2
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,453
<i>Rachel's a hit in</i> Funny Girl
<i>on Broadway,</i>

3
00:00:03,487 --> 00:00:05,488
<i>but she's on thin ice</i>
<i>because she lied to producers</i>

4
00:00:05,522 --> 00:00:06,956
<i>and missed a performance.</i>

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,390
<i>Mercedes is finishing her album</i>
<i>with a duet with Santana</i>

6
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:11,527
<i>and Blaine's getting wooed</i>
<i>by a rich society dame</i>

7
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:12,962
<i>who's dying to showcase</i>
<i>his talent.</i>

8
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:14,864
I'm a little jealous,
but I'm not resentful.

9
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:17,033
<i>And all Kurt's got is NYADA</i>
<i>and the diner</i>

10
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:18,468
<i>and his precious collection</i>
<i>of neckerchiefs.</i>

11
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:20,203
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

12
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,925
KURT: Hey, do any of you guys
want to catch a matinee tomorrow?

13
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,928
I have a late shift at the diner
and I know<i> Funny Girl</i> is dark.

14
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,830
SANTANA: Uh, "dark" as in
there are no performances,

15
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,665
or "dark" as in it's
kind of a downer.

16
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,867
RACHEL: Oh, my word. I'm
sorry, I-I would love to go,

17
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,935
but June's got me taken up with
dinners and rehearsals...

18
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:40,072
Yeah, I know. Count me out.
I'm gonna be at recording studio all day.

19
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,340
This is terrible... look what I
just found on Broadwaybuzzard.com.

20
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,409
SANTANA:
I'll take that.

00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,334
that they don't know
you're seriously considering

32
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,269
leaving your show
to do a TV pilot.

33
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,704
This is terrible, okay?

34
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,539
I cannot be branded
a problem child

this early in my career.
I-I might be ambitious,

36
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:18,243
but I'm not a bad person.

37
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:22,447
You can't expect total strangers
to know exactly who you are.

38
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,449
I mean, look at Angelina
Jolie... she used to be

39
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,885
that girl with the vial of blood
around her neck

40
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:29,354
who liked kissing her brother,
and now she's mother earth.

41
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,956
How'd she do it?

42
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,759
Two things...
publicist and a cause.

43
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,861
BLAINE: She can't afford a publicist.
And<i> I've</i> always been my cause.

44
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,129
KURT: Inside voice, honey.
Sorry.

45
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:38,263
Well, you don't need a publicist

46
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:39,598
when you've got Snixx
on your side.

47
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,033
If there's one thing
I know about,

48
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,768
it's cultivating an image.
In high school,

49
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,203
I was a huge bitch,
but also most popular.

50
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,339
I was voted
Best Shoulder to Cry On

51
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,275
and Most Likely to Poison Someone.
Excuse me.

52
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:53,712
Excuse me, miss,

53
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,315
I know that you have
a dog in your purse.

54
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,550
It's a... service animal.

55
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:00,719
I would seriously think that
zipping a Seeing Eye dog

56
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,888
in your bag would hinder it
from doing its job.

57
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,891
You know, there are so many dogs
out there that need good homes,

58
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,993
and you're just treating it
like some fashion accessory?

59
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,428
You should be ashamed

them five walks a day.

122
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,154
We take them to a dog run
for two hours of exercise

every other day...
we really do our best,

funding that we have.

125
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,495
You got to remember, these are rescue
dogs, you know? Most of these dogs have

126
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,399
been living on the streets, or
they were abandoned, abused...

127
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,735
RACHEL: Oh...
MERCEDES: So... you know,

128
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,938
what happens
to them eventually?

129
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,540
Well, it depends on how old they
are, really. We try to get as many

130
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:13,178
of them adopted as we can, but
when we can't, not much choice.

131
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,214
You know, it's...
it's the worst part of my job.

132
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,516
RACHEL: Well, that's why
we're here, actually.

133
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,818
We want to arrange

135
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,156
we are so passionate
about: animals.

136
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,025
Yeah, you said something about Broadway?
Yes. I am starring currently

137
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,794

Broadway revival of<i> Funny Girl.</i>

138
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,164
I don't know if you've seen it. I
don't really get into the city much.

139
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,600
I'm not a Broadway guy. But I liked<i> Cats.
</i> (laughs) Okay,

140
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,635
well, it doesn't really matter,
you know... we just want

141
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,437

00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,747
- Yeah?

149
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,549
I'll get the information
together; let's do it.

00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,992
Look at you. Ooh.
Oh, no. Sam, I love animals,

154
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,327
but I've got my hands
full taking care of you.

155
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,430
You're more than enough.

156
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,465
(dogs barking)

157
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,869
(excited barking)

158
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,705
(shouting): It happens sometimes.
Uh, it's no big deal.

159
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,840
When they get like this,

160
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,309
I pipe music in
through the P.A. system,

161
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,678
but it's all busted now, so...

162
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,714
Today's your lucky day... I just
read John Mayer's bio, and he

163
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,685
said you always have to have
your guitar 80% of the time.

164
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,389

207
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,026
SANTANA: I've got it.
I have got the perfect plan

208
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,928
for how to get this thing
off the ground.

209
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,397
Later today,
you are going to take

210
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,532
a couple of dogs
for a walk around the block,

211
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,901
where paparazzi will be
conveniently waiting.

212
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,669
You're gonna get snapped,
give a quote,

213
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,505
bam, Broadway Bitches
is off and running.

214
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,006
And I also snagged you

215
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,108
this designer number
by a designer that is so fancy,

216
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,711
I can't even pronounce his name.
There's hardly any vowels in it.

217
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,546
And if you wear it and
get photographed in it,

218
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,427
you get to keep it for free. But how
do we know that they'll be there?

219
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,583
I made a couple of calls

220
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,985
and I tweeted from your account,

221
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,887
and I used hashtag living,

222
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,356
so everyone sees it.
Oh, perfect.

223
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,091
RACHEL: Oh, my God, Kurt!
I have the best news

224
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,492
that I've been wanting
to tell you about.

225
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,661
Is Liza off her meds, running
around Central Park again?

226
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,130
I'm starting
a dog-rescue charity!

227
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,499
And Santana and Mercedes and I
are doing a performance.

228
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:28,534
It's gonna be great.

229
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,203
Oh, could I perform, too?

230
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,639
I-I've been itching to do
something outside of school.

231
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,973
One Three Hill's
been on a hiatus

232
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,508
ever since Elliot went
to his yoga retreat

233
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,583
and Dani's Roller Derby team
became state champions.

234
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,846
I-I... I think we're
just gonna keep it us girls.

235
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,681
We don't want the event
to be, like...

236
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,049
Amateur open mic night?

237
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,951
No, no, no, Kurt.

238
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,619
This is not personal, okay?

239
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,488
This is about Rachel
and her image.

240
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,923
And you are so good

241
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,192
that you would just be
pulling focus from her.

242
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,327
No, I-I get it.
I get that I haven't exactly

243
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,063
made a name for myself like
the rest of you have, but...

244
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,465
gosh, you'd just think
after everything,

245
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,200
someone would
throw<i> me</i> a bone for once.

246
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,102
Kurt, wait.

247
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,440
(man coughing in distance)

248
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,577
MAGGIE (in distance):
All right, boys, I don't want...

249
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,612
(continues indistinctly)

250
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,417
MAGGIE:
I'll leave the window unlocked.

251
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:23,655
That strange boy may come
looking for his shadow.

252
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,325
Oh, Pillsbury, you made it!

253
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,060
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

254
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,995
Sit down.

255
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,565
Take in the magic!

256
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,205
MAN: Debbie, it's your...
it's your cue.

257
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,709
Debbie! Rule number one:
hearing aids on

258
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,278
during rehearsal!

259
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,354
Uh-oh.

260
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,524
Peter's dead, folks.

261
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,405
MAGGIE: Of all times
she chooses to die,

262
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:10,875
less than a week away
from opening night.

263
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,111
Oh, she was always so selfish.

264
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:14,779
MARTY:
We have to cancel.

265
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:18,116
Debbie was the only one
with hips strong enough

266
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,951
f-for the harness.

267
00:11:19,985 --> 00:11:23,655
Take a walk down
the halls here.

268
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:25,757
Room after room of beds

269
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,693
filled with people who won't
get out of them anymore.

270
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:30,628
Not because they can't

271
00:11:30,663 --> 00:11:33,364
but because they can't find
any reason to.

272
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,966
This show,

273
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,768
uh, getting up in front

274
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:39,103
of an audience...
this was my reason.

275
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:44,075
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

276
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:46,744
Wh-Wh... uh, when is
opening night?

277
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,513
Uh, Monday
at 4:00 p.m.

278
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:50,547
Incidentally,
that's also closing night.

279
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:52,851
I-I could fill in,
unless there's a rule

280
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:54,619
about residents only
being in the show.

281
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:57,489
First of all,
we only have two rules.

282
00:11:57,523 --> 00:11:59,424
One, remember your teeth.

283
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,526
And your teeth.

284
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,528
And... don't mix up

285
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:05,029
your night pills

286
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:06,998
with your day pills.
It's simple.

287
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:09,000
I thought I was a pterodactyl.

288
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:12,137
Are you sure, Pillsbury?

289
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:14,639
Peter Pan is a very vocally

290
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:16,674
demanding role for a woman.

291
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,943
Can you handle it?
Oh, yeah.

292
00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:20,211
I-I'm a countertenor,

293
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:21,679
and I practically have the score
memorized.

294
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:23,782
I was obsessed with my tape

295
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:25,283
of Mary Martin's version
when I was a kid.

296
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:26,551
She was my childhood hero.

297
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:28,653
Which explains a lot
now that I think about it.

298
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:30,188
We have a piano.

299
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:33,658
Uh, could you audition
with any music or anything?

300
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:36,394
You know, we just
can't hand you a part.

301
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:38,897
We have standards. Right?

302
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:41,099
I-I do. I always carry

303
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,834
sheet music with me
just in case.

304
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:44,936
Oh. Oh.
Oh.

305

Yay!

341
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,835
SAM: Aw... ARTIE: This is
an unusually violent game.

342
00:15:38,844 --> 00:15:40,211
Hey, McConaughey. Hey.

343
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:41,713
(a la Matthew McConaughey):
All right, all right, all right.

344
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:43,081
Grr. (sputters) (growls, barks)

345
00:15:43,115 --> 00:15:44,849
(growls) We're working
on his impressions.

346
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:45,850
It's like watching

347
00:15:45,885 --> 00:15:47,385
Goofy teach tricks to Pluto.

348
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,540
(chuckles) Mercedes is gonna
freak when she gets home.

349
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:51,022
Hush. She's gonna fall
in love with him,

350
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:53,491
just like I did. You have to
help me sell it to her so she,

351
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:55,627
like, thinks he's really awesome
when she gets here, okay?

352
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:58,096
ARTIE:
Don't worry. I got your back.

353
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,098
Sam? Did you
go back

354
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:01,199
and adopt that dog?

355
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:03,201
Uh... uh, hey.
I tried to stop him.

356
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:04,502
Uh, baby, yeah.

357
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:06,171
Sorry I didn't, uh, talk
to you about it first.

358
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:07,439
It's just that when I saw

359
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:09,107
McConaughey in his cage,
something inside me just clicked

360
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:10,575
and I knew that we were meant
for each other.

361
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:11,876
I blame Sarah McLachlan.

362
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:14,079
I don't mean to be patronizing,

363
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:17,282
but we have a kitchen full
of dead Chia Pets

364
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:18,383
that you can't take care of.

365
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:21,186
This is a living,
breathing creature.

366
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,620
So is Artie,
and I take care of him.

367
00:16:22,621 --> 00:16:23,702
Hold up. Did you just...

368
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:25,023
Look, hey, look, I know

369
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:26,758
I can take care of him, okay?
I just...

370
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,153
Give me a chance.
Look, look, look.

371
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,462
(a la Matthew McConaughey):
Oh, McConaughey loves you.

372
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:32,997
He lo... (baby talk):
Oh, oh, look at the face.

373
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:35,900
- The pooch. He d... The face.
- Okay. Fine.

374
00:16:35,935 --> 00:16:40,372
If it's that important to you,
we will try it.

375
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:41,973
Okay. She's gone. Let's go.

376
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:44,242
- Did you pay the gas bill?
- Yeah.

377
00:16:44,276 --> 00:16:46,778
Uh, no.
Uh, I've...

378
00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:49,381
Artie was just
into this video game.

379
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:51,983
Did you take out the recycling?

380
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:54,586
Um, Artie was gonna do it
on his way out.

381
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,954
Am I still here? Am I invisible?

382
00:16:57,523 --> 00:16:59,290
Hold up.

383
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:01,092
Is that my faux-huahua?

384
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:02,160
Uh...

385
00:17:02,194 --> 00:17:04,329
(snaps)

386
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:07,832
Oh, I did that.

387
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:09,787
Okay, you better
clean this mess up.

388
00:17:09,802 --> 00:17:11,469
Okay, just because
McConaughey is cute,

389
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:13,505
it doesn't mean...

390
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:21,579
Oh, no.

391
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:22,854
Oh, I know

392
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:24,282
that that dog
is not eating my hair.

393
00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:26,017
I<i> know</i>

394
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:28,586
that you did not let that dog
near my bedroom or my wardrobe

395
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:30,622
or my makeup!

396
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,027
(Mercedes gasps)

397
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:37,662
I got to go. Um...
Sam!

398
00:17:37,697 --> 00:17:39,297
Can one of you guys
bring me Don't.

399
00:17:39,331 --> 00:17:40,632
Down the stairs? Don't you even speak.
Don't you even look

400
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,033
I got you. like you're
about to speak to me.

401
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:43,802
You just pack up that dog
and you take him back

402
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:45,937
where you got him
or, so help me,

403
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:47,872
I will go full-on Carcosa
on you.

404
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:50,809

Okay.

Oh, my God, is
that Rachel Berry,

408
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:10,729
star of Broadway's
smash-hit musical

<i>Funny Girl?</i> ARTIE: I love her!

410
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:15,400
I saw<i> Funny Girl</i>

411
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:18,370
five times!
She is just so likeable!

412
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:19,738
RACHEL:
Oh! (chuckles)

413
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:21,539
Ms. Berry,
what on earth are you doing

414
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:22,941
walking all these
beautiful dogs?

415
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:24,409
Well, someone has to.

416
00:18:24,443 --> 00:18:26,211
Did you know
that New York City shelters

417
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:28,613
are the most overpopulated
in the state?

418
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:31,883
What? No, I didn't know that.
That's such a shame.

419
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:35,353
That's why I'm starting
my own dog rescue charity,

420
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:37,856
Broadway Bitches.

421
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,890
(chuckles)

422
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:40,892
Okay. Wait,
just stay right there.

423
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:43,194
(chuckles)
At the, uh, Spotlight Diner.

424
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:45,263
(Rachel chuckling)

425
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,934
(dogs barking)

426
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:51,002
Okay.

427
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:52,437
Oh, my God. Stay.

428
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:54,339
Oh, my God.

429
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:57,442
Oh, my God. Ah!

430
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:00,945
(shouting)

431
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:04,322
Oh, my God.

432
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:19,018
At least you're wearing underwear.
I got dragged four blocks

433
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:20,620
and now I have to
pay for this dress

434
00:19:20,654 --> 00:19:22,155
and that man got
bit by a shih tzu.

435
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:23,289
Seriously, is this a good idea?

436
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:24,763
Because I feel like
I look worse now.

437
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,826
No. Yes, this is
a good idea, okay?

438
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,961
Um, everybody's talking
about your activism.

439
00:19:28,996 --> 00:19:31,631
And, in fact, out of the 500
Broadway Bitches Evites

440
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:34,567
that I sent out this morning,
over half are confirmed.

441
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:37,236
And I even have a reporter
from NYTheatreNews.com ready

442
00:19:37,271 --> 00:19:38,671
to do a piece on it.

443
00:19:38,706 --> 00:19:40,573
So just stick to the plan

444
00:19:40,607 --> 00:19:42,575
and don't go soft on me.

445
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:45,511
Guys, I got good news.
I landed a role.

446

And I'm Peter!

They needed an
emergency replacement

450
00:19:51,652 --> 00:19:52,952
because the woman

451
00:19:52,986 --> 00:19:55,960
playing him dropped... out.

452
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,227
Possibly be serious.

453
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,898
I am, actually,
and I'm very excited about it.

454
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:03,667
Opening night is Monday,
and I'd love to have you.

455
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,336
No, sorry, can't make it.

456
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,605
As much as I would love
to watch Homocchio

457
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,873
and the Geriatric Puppets
put on a depressing

458

sub-community theatre show,
Rachel's event is that night.

459
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,845
Well, that shouldn't be
a problem

460
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:16,313
because the show starts at 4:00.

461
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,383
I'm sorry, Kurt. Santana has
me doing all these photo ops

462
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,919
and interviews, and my
reputation is at stake here.

463
00:20:21,953 --> 00:20:23,887
Seriously, you know,
I could lose jobs

464
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,356
if I don't clean this up.

465
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,959
I bend over backwards for you
every time you need something.

466
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,263
Well, I need you now
so please support me in this.

467
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,633
I am doing something good
for the animals.

468
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,034
No, you're doing it
for yourself.

00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:39,436
You treat me exactly like
the world treats those dogs...

470
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,105
you just cast me aside.

471
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,339
Well, I'm done being a friend

472
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,220
only when it's convenient
for you.

473
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:48,989
SAM: Mercedes doesn't want me
to get rid of the dog, okay?

474
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,781
She just wants him
to stop tearing everything up.

475
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,183
ARTIE: You seriously think
you can train that dog?

476
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,119
I had to teach you
how to use Velcro.

477
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,655
Okay, yeah, well, Velcro's hard.
It's like black magic.

478
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:01,358
But, look, I can do this, okay?
Doggies crave discipline.

479
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,562
We'll just run him through
the Doggy Gauntlet of Doom...

480
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,564
it's a working title,
don't judge me...

481
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,233
and then once Mercedes gets home
tonight, he'll be groomed,

482
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:11,235
trained and ready
to melt her heart

483
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:14,605
with those big, beautiful puppy
dog eyes that he gets from me.

484
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:17,007
- Let's do it.
- All right, good.

485
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,710

Boys, I've returned
to Neverland!

525
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,871
GUS: Maggie, you're supposed
to be on the ground.

526
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,007
Peter, we killed a giant bird
while you were gone.

527
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,979
If I get down,
I'm not getting back up.

528
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,714
Oh, we look ridiculous!

529
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,382
What were we thinking when

530
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,750
we chose to do<i> Peter Pan?</i>

531
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:41,418
Well, we wanted
to show our families

532
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,154
that we were still
energetic and young.

533
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,355
Right, Freddie?

534
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,323
(snoring)

535
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,859
But you guys<i> are</i> still
energetic and young.

536
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,729
You know, if you want to seem
young, you got to feel young.

537
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,130
I don't know about all of that.

538
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,299
I was thinking
of changing up the music.

539
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,667
You know, maybe updating it
a little bit.

540
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,269
I still think that we should do

541
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,938
<i>The Importance</i>
<i>of Being Earnest.</i>

542
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,541
Ever since you were a question
on<i> Jeopardy!,</i>

543
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,676
you have been
such a know-it-all.

544
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,879
Maggie, flowers came for you.

545
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,181
Oh.

546
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,953
Oh, they're from
my daughter, Clara!

547
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,089
She's a defense
attorney. "Mom,

548
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,493
"sorry I have
to miss opening night.

549
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,929
I have to be in Reno
for a deposition."

550
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,834
Oh.

551
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:33,270
She is so thoughtful.

552
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,539
She spoils me.

553
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,477
Oh, that's too bad.

554
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,912
I know how important
Clara is to her.

555
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,614
She talks about her constantly.

556
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,008
All about their lunches, and
their late night phone calls,

557
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,218
and their double dates.

558
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,220
Except none of it's real.

559
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,122
Those flowers aren't
from her daughter.

560
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,957
Maggie sends herself flowers

561
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,959
once a week
to keep up appearances.

562
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,461
Clara hasn't been here in years.

563
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,434
(door closes,
Sam muttering gibberish)

564
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,239
You are shredding my last nerve.

565
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,741
Before you say anything else,
you should know

566
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:13,344
that Artie and I tamed the beast
that is McConaughey.

567
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:14,545
He's not barking,

568
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,881
he's been off his leash
for the last few hours,

569
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,783
but didn't poop anywhere
he wasn't supposed to,

570
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,985
and he didn't eat any
of your weird, strange,

571
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,987
Indian hair.

572
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,123
All of that is great,

573
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,992
Sam, but we talked about this,

574
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,728
and we both agreed,
we can't take care of a dog.

575
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:31,996
Really? Because
it looks like

576
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,764
I'm doing a pretty good
job of it right now.

577
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,332
For the moment.

578
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,669
But what's gonna happen when
you have, like, a 20-hour shoot,

579
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,772
and you can't walk McConaughey,
or-or put out his food?

580
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,341
I don't know. I thought
maybe you could help.

581
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:48,112
Well, I would, and I could, but
what happens when I go on tour?

582
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:51,282
Uh, we could get a dog-sitter.
I don't know.

583
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,483
Who's gonna call the sitter?

584
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,052
Who's gonna make sure
that they have a key to get in?

585
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:56,520
Who's gonna pay them?

586
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,389
I am, and you know what else
I've been thinking about?

587
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,424
You going on tour, and me
being in this brownstone,

588
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:03,160
all alone
and wanting some company.

589
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:04,628
(panting)

590
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,430
You know, last time I checked,

591
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:08,265
New York's a pretty lonely town.

592
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,934
Is that what
this is really about?

593
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,936
Maybe.

594
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,804
Partly, yes.

595
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,039
But if we're being honest,

596
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,373
I think it's also about

597
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,275
when I suggested
we take McConaughey home,

598
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,078
you couldn't even imagine me
being able to take care of him,

599
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:22,993
okay, and that's just...
that's just crap, okay.

600
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,249
It's like you're looking at me
like I'm a boy and not a man.

601
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,418
- Sam...
- Look, I took care of

602
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,019
my whole family
when they had nothing, okay.

603
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,988
When they were as poor
and as homeless as McConaughey.

604
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,189
I made sure they ate,

605
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,691
I made sure
they had a roof over their head,

606
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:34,885
I made sure my little brother

607
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,093
and sister got
to school on time.

608
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,294
Me, Sam, the slacker.

609
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,796
- Oh, Sam, I... I know.
- But, yeah, yeah, yeah.

610
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,165
I know... I know
that I forget about

611
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,533
appointments sometimes,

612
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,402
and I leave my clothes
around the apartment,

613
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,903
and I get distracted
playing video games,

614
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,371
but that doesn't mean
I'm a joke.

615
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,707
I never called you a joke.

616
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,376
Mercedes, look, I...
I want to marry you eventually,

617
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:54,612
when we're ready, and I
want to have a family

618
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,846
with a house and a yard
and kids and stuff,

619
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,381
but that's only gonna happen

620
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,417
if you start taking me
seriously, and that starts with

621
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,753
me proving to you that I can
take care of McConaughey.

622
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,924
You-you did, and, uh, I'm giving
you your props for that.

623
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,826
Okay, great.
But I...

624
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,395
I still don't think
that you should keep him.

625
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,530
Why not?

626
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,864
(sighs)

627
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,366
Because it's not good for him,

628
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,234
Sam. Like I said, I'm about

629
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,036
to go on tour, and you...

630
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,806
your schedule's crazy,
and it's just gonna get worse.

631
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,742
So, what's the point
of having a dog, even one

632
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,377
as cute as McConaughey,
if you can't

633
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,580
take care of him,
and you can't enjoy him?

634
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,749
(sighs)

635
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,951
You heard
what they do to the pets

636
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,387
that you bring back
to the shelters, right?

637
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:40,691
Well, then, you're gonna have
to find a home for him.

638
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,259
And I promise you, some day,

639
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,328
we're gonna have
everything that you want.

640
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:45,963
Okay, and that includes a dog.

641
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,566
But we're still figuring
things out between you and me,

642
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,968
like who we are together
and where we're gonna be.

643
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,471
I just don't think

644
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,140
that we should drag McConaughey
into that, do you?

645
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,701
WOMAN:
Liz, send in my 10:00.

646
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:21,809
Hi. Um, I'm Kurt Hummel.

647
00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:24,278
Um, I-I didn't
actually cause

648
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:26,380
a major chemical spill
in National Park.

649
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,582
Uh, your receptionist said
that you were really busy,

650
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:32,352
and that was the only way that I
could make an appointment, so...

651
00:28:32,387 --> 00:28:34,054
Oh. Uh...

652
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,222
Liz, call security.

653
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,057
Well...
They should only need one guy.

654
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:38,659
No. It's-it's about your mother.

655
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:40,093
I'm-I'm friends with her.

656
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:44,698
Wait. Is this some kind of
Martha Raye-Mark Harris thing?

657
00:28:44,732 --> 00:28:46,733
'Cause she doesn't
have any money.

658
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:49,937
No, no. We're performing
together at the home.

659
00:28:49,971 --> 00:28:51,038
Uh,<i> Peter Pan.</i>

660
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,906
Uh, she's Wendy, I'm Peter.

661
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:56,076
Okay. Weird, but whatever.

662
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,912
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but the minute the show's over,

663
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,914
she's gonna lose your number.

664
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,549
(laughs) I...

665
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:05,085
I don't know what happened
between you two, but, uh,

666
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,288
I can't imagine a sweet old lady
like that hurting anyone.

667
00:29:08,323 --> 00:29:10,657
Well...

668
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:12,760
she wasn't always
a sweet old lady.

669
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:15,796
She was young and ambitious and

670
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,030
so hungry to get back
in the game,

671
00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:18,426
she tended
to forget little things,

672
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:22,436
like her daughter at school
and birthdays.

673
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,940
And I bet
that was very painful,

674
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:30,310
but your mother is 86 years old.

675
00:29:30,345 --> 00:29:33,380
I mean, don't you want
to forgive before it's too late?

676
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:35,382
Oh, I've forgiven.

677
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:37,718
Wasn't her fault.

678
00:29:37,752 --> 00:29:40,354
She never should have become
a mother in the first place.

679
00:29:40,388 --> 00:29:43,090
Did you know that she sends
herself flowers from you,

680
00:29:43,124 --> 00:29:44,825
and that she talks about you
constantly?

681
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:47,728
I know all about the scar
on your elbow from the time

682
00:29:47,762 --> 00:29:50,330
that you climbed on the counter
trying to get the box

683
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:52,900
of Frosted Flakes, nd your
fear of balloons, and that

684
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:54,101
you aced the SAT.

685
00:29:54,135 --> 00:29:56,103
Wow.

686
00:29:56,137 --> 00:29:57,704
Did she also tell you

687
00:29:57,739 --> 00:29:59,973
that she missed
my high school graduation?

688
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:03,811
She had a dream,
and she got lost in it.

689
00:30:05,713 --> 00:30:08,849
But she is clearly
full of regret.

690
00:30:18,326 --> 00:30:21,061
My mom died when I was eight,

691
00:30:21,096 --> 00:30:24,698
and I spent my entire life
pretending that I had one.

692
00:30:24,732 --> 00:30:27,868
Whatever she did to you,
yours is still here.

693
00:30:29,404 --> 00:30:33,818
Don't you see that by coming
to see her perform

694
00:30:33,853 --> 00:30:36,187
for taking her away from you
that you could heal all of this?

695
00:30:36,222 --> 00:30:37,822
(sighs)

696
00:30:37,857 --> 00:30:40,125
Well, your mother
couldn't take care of you

697
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,695
when you were little, but
you could take care of her now.

698
00:30:45,364 --> 00:30:47,365
(sighs)

699
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:53,538
(horn honks,
dogs barking and whining)

700
00:30:55,265 --> 00:30:57,585
RACHEL: Oh, this is better than
I could have ever imagined!

701
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,778
I mean, a dozen dogs
have already been adopted,

702
00:30:59,812 --> 00:31:01,680
and we just started! Hi.

703
00:31:01,714 --> 00:31:03,715
Okay, um, Beverly Stevens
from NYTheatreNews.com

704
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:05,450
is going to be
here later today,

705
00:31:05,484 --> 00:31:07,252
and I've picked out
the perfect pooch

706
00:31:07,286 --> 00:31:09,354
for you to pose with.

707
00:31:09,388 --> 00:31:11,089
He's a three-legged dog!

708
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:12,524
Oh. Come here.

709
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:14,859
Who doesn't love a lady
holding a three-legged dog?

710
00:31:14,894 --> 00:31:16,928
You know, it's like
a ticket to Heaven.

711
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:18,463
Oh, Santana,
you're really good at this.

712
00:31:18,497 --> 00:31:20,131
Have you ever thought about
doing this professionally?

713
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:23,234
Sure enough,
every time I watch<i> Scandal.</i>

714
00:31:24,637 --> 00:31:26,604
Okay, come on, Sam.

715
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:30,008
We have to turn McConaughey
into the doggie rescue.

716
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:32,010
No way, Jose.

717
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:33,978
Guys, I think we have an issue.

718
00:31:34,013 --> 00:31:35,146
RACHEL: I'm going to
have to take the dog.

719
00:31:35,181 --> 00:31:36,314
You're telling me
I can't take this dog?

720
00:31:36,349 --> 00:31:37,509
Just, I need to take the dog.

721
00:31:37,516 --> 00:31:38,783
No, I can't believe that!
No, no, no, no, no.

722
00:31:38,818 --> 00:31:40,318
WOMAN: No. RACHEL: Yeah,
'cause I have to take

723
00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:42,120
a photo with that dog
later, so...

724
00:31:42,154 --> 00:31:43,621
But this is the dog
my son wants to adopt.

725
00:31:43,656 --> 00:31:45,323
Isn't that the whole point
of this event?

726
00:31:45,358 --> 00:31:46,958
Um, well, maybe you could just
wait a couple of hours?

727
00:31:46,993 --> 00:31:50,328
I have to catch a train back
to Long Island in 20 minutes.

728
00:31:50,363 --> 00:31:51,730
Okay, I'm so sorry, lady,

729
00:31:51,764 --> 00:31:53,531
but hand over the tripod,
and nobody'll get hurt.

730
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:55,467
I'm sorry...
I can't...

731
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:57,469
I get it.

732
00:31:57,503 --> 00:32:00,171
I know who you are.
I read the Broadway blogs.

733
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:02,674
You can't redeem a lie
with more lies.

734
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:05,643
You may get away
with this farce this time,

735
00:32:05,678 --> 00:32:07,979
but you're a fraud, and
it's gonna come out soon enough.

736
00:32:08,014 --> 00:32:10,782
You don't care
about these dogs.

737
00:32:10,816 --> 00:32:14,819
I doubt you care much
about anyone but yourself.

738
00:32:14,854 --> 00:32:16,855
Come on, honey, let's go home.

739
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:20,859
Don't listen to her.

740
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:22,427
Look at...

741
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:24,062
Look at her shoes.

742
00:32:24,096 --> 00:32:25,897
(scoffs)

743
00:32:27,933 --> 00:32:29,934
(dogs barking)

744
00:32:44,024 --> 00:32:46,144
Thanks. I just don't want
the harness to show.

745
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:47,536
I mean,
the show's tacky enough.

746
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:49,271
Well, I am missing
dinner with June

747
00:32:49,306 --> 00:32:51,440
and Diane von Furstenberg
at Annie Leibovitz's house,

748
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:54,043
(chuckles) but... there's no
other place I'd rather be.

749
00:32:54,077 --> 00:32:55,945
Drop all the names you want,

750
00:32:55,979 --> 00:32:59,582
my old ladies are much
cooler than yours.

751
00:32:59,616 --> 00:33:02,218
It's really nice
to see you so happy.

752
00:33:02,252 --> 00:33:03,819
I never thought
that a retirement home

753
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:05,855
can make someone smile so much.

754
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:08,691
You know, for the first time
since I moved here, I...

755
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:10,960
I feel like I'm doing
something with purpose.

756
00:33:10,994 --> 00:33:13,496
Besides school, of course.

757
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,564
Should I save some seats?

758
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:18,534
No, no, I'll see you after.
Okay.

759
00:33:18,568 --> 00:33:20,269
Love you.
Me, too.

760
00:33:20,303 --> 00:33:22,471
Oh, uh, don't sit
in the first row.

761
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:24,940
I don't trust the harness.
And Gladys has been having

762
00:33:24,975 --> 00:33:27,243
a hard time keeping
solid foods down, so...

763
00:33:27,277 --> 00:33:29,178
Okay.

764
00:33:29,212 --> 00:33:30,646
Break a leg.

765
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,515
(quietly):
Thanks.

766
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:41,333
You know, Maggie,
I was thinking,

767
00:33:41,358 --> 00:33:43,926
since your daughter and my
friends are always so busy,

768
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,828
why don't we become
each other's family?

769
00:33:45,862 --> 00:33:47,963
I mean, you'd be
doing me a favor.

770
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:50,478
I-I could use
someone to talk to.

771
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:55,771
(laughs): Well, as long as
I'd be doing you a favor,

772
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:57,173
I'd love to.

773
00:33:57,207 --> 00:33:58,374
(both laugh)

774
00:34:00,043 --> 00:34:02,478

Um, my show is about to start,
and I just wanted

781
00:34:27,237 --> 00:34:29,205
to wish you good luck
at the benefit.

782
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,907
I know things have been really
tense between us this week,

783
00:34:31,942 --> 00:34:34,110
um, but I would
never want you to think

784
00:34:34,144 --> 00:34:36,979
that I'm not proud
or supportive of you.

785
00:34:37,013 --> 00:34:39,949
Um, I'm-I'm very glad
you're doing what you're doing,

786
00:34:39,983 --> 00:34:42,184
because... my life
would certainly be dull

787
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:44,420
without friends like you
to inspire me every day.

788
00:34:44,454 --> 00:34:47,123
That is very sweet of you,
but I have to go,

789
00:34:47,157 --> 00:34:51,093
because, um, my best friend's
show is about to start.

Clara.

851
00:37:25,082 --> 00:37:27,883
Seeing you in the audience
makes this

852
00:37:27,918 --> 00:37:29,952
the best performance of my life.

853
00:37:29,987 --> 00:37:33,856
A friend of yours told me
it was one I couldn't miss.

854
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,758
I'm so glad he did.

855
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:38,461
I have so many things to say.

856
00:37:38,495 --> 00:37:40,863
So many "I'm sorrys."

857
00:37:40,897 --> 00:37:44,567
And I so want to know
about your life.

858
00:37:45,702 --> 00:37:47,837
Oh, my gosh you were amazing!

859
00:37:47,871 --> 00:37:49,538
I couldn't stop smiling
watching you perform

860
00:37:49,573 --> 00:37:51,107
with all these sweet old folks.

861
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:53,209
It's like, this is gonna be us
in the future when we're older,

862
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:54,477
and be so cute.
It is,

863
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:56,045
and we'll be very cute.
Oh, dude, hold up.

864
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,848
Well, hello. This harness cannot
be good for the sack puppies.

865
00:37:58,882 --> 00:38:00,249
Oh, years of skinny jeans

866
00:38:00,283 --> 00:38:02,018
have prepared me
for this performance.

867
00:38:02,052 --> 00:38:04,320
Well, you look great.
The costume and the key.

868
00:38:04,354 --> 00:38:05,788
Yeah, I just wish
more people could see

869
00:38:05,822 --> 00:38:06,822
Maggie and the gang perform.

870
00:38:06,857 --> 00:38:08,424
I mean, they're the real stars.

871
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,092
Hey, there's a bus outside.

872
00:38:10,127 --> 00:38:12,228
There's a... Freddie, wake up!

873
00:38:12,262 --> 00:38:13,663
(snoring) Wake up!

874
00:38:13,697 --> 00:38:15,798
Freddie, there's a bus outside,
and it's got a lift.

875
00:38:15,832 --> 00:38:17,333
Oh, a lift?
A lift.

876
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:19,368
Yeah, okay.
Oh, boy.

877
00:38:19,403 --> 00:38:21,203
Why is there a bus outside?

878
00:38:21,238 --> 00:38:23,172
Artie was able to get
the film school

879
00:38:23,206 --> 00:38:24,940
to loan it to us for the day.

880
00:38:24,975 --> 00:38:27,209
This is your opening night gift.

881
00:38:27,244 --> 00:38:30,346
(speaking loud and slowly):
Hey, everybody!

882
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,949
I'm Sam,

883
00:38:32,983 --> 00:38:35,217
and there's a bus outside.

884
00:38:35,252 --> 00:38:38,087
Old people usually freak me out,
but in this case,

885
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:39,588
you guys are pretty cool.

886
00:38:39,623 --> 00:38:41,524
Anyway, Rachel has asked us

887
00:38:41,558 --> 00:38:43,159
on behalf
of the adoption charity

888
00:38:43,193 --> 00:38:45,528
Broadway Bitches,
to personally invite all of you

889
00:38:45,562 --> 00:38:47,229
to be our guest performers

890
00:38:47,264 --> 00:38:49,198
at an event we're holding
this evening.

891
00:38:49,232 --> 00:38:52,668
(applause)

892
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:54,770
Well, what do you say, Maggie?

893
00:38:54,805 --> 00:38:57,006
Do you think you have
a second act in you?

894
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,076
I never used to believe
in second acts,

895
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:03,145
but you've proven me wrong.

896
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,448
KURT (chuckles):
Great.

897
00:39:05,482 --> 00:39:08,517
(clears throat)
To the bus, everybody!

898
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:13,782
Hello, everyone.
Thank you so much for coming

899
00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:15,908
and supporting Broadway Bitches.

900
00:39:15,942 --> 00:39:17,910
You know, as New Yorkers,

901
00:39:17,944 --> 00:39:20,412
we get so wrapped
up in our careers

902
00:39:20,447 --> 00:39:22,448
and making it that we forget
the importance

903
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:24,984
of really creating a legacy
that we can be proud of.

904
00:39:25,018 --> 00:39:28,220
Um, and what better way
and what's more rewarding

905
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:31,123
than giving back
to man's best friend

906
00:39:31,158 --> 00:39:33,092
and to all of our friends,
really.

907
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:36,328
So please join me
in giving a warm welcome

908
00:39:36,363 --> 00:39:39,665
to some very special friends who
are here today to help us out.

909
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:42,668
From the Lexington Home
of Retired Performers,

910
00:39:42,702 --> 00:39:44,403
give it up and enjoy the song.

911
00:39:44,437 --> 00:39:46,071
If he's not going home with us,

912
00:39:46,106 --> 00:39:48,026
we need to find the perfect
home for McConaughey.

913
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:49,375
If you don't, Sam, I mean,

914
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:50,609
we'll just,
we'll figure something out,

915
00:39:50,644 --> 00:39:52,178
but we're not gonna take him
back to the shelter.

(applause)

963
00:42:10,016 --> 00:42:12,017
(laughs)

964
00:42:20,026 --> 00:42:21,494
(applause continues)

965
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:28,000
This was inspired,
to say the least.

966
00:42:28,034 --> 00:42:29,635
New Broadway mixing with old,

967
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:31,604
plus this amazing cause.

968
00:42:31,638 --> 00:42:33,038
Where did you get
the inspiration

969
00:42:33,073 --> 00:42:34,140
to put on an event like this?

970
00:42:34,174 --> 00:42:35,641
Well, it's funny that you ask,

971
00:42:35,675 --> 00:42:38,177
because, um, I actually have
an amazing publicist.

972
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:39,512
Well, thank you.

973
00:42:39,546 --> 00:42:42,415
Hi, uh, Santana Lopez,
public relations.

974
00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:44,950
My motto is "If I can make
Berry work, I can do anything."

975
00:42:44,985 --> 00:42:46,552
(chuckles)

976
00:42:46,586 --> 00:42:50,054
And it was actually
my really amazing friend, Kurt,

977
00:42:50,088 --> 00:42:52,823
all these incredible retired
Broadway performers.

978
00:42:52,857 --> 00:42:55,125
Oh, well, we are uploading
the video

979
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,795
that my cameraman shot
on our site immediately,

980
00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:00,763
and I am betting that we are
going to get a lot of hits.

981
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:02,388
Thank you for all your support,

982
00:43:02,423 --> 00:43:03,756
but Rachel isn't giving herself
enough credit.

983
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,091
I mean, this is
a true collaboration,

984
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:08,089
- and we're just happy to
be giving back. - Yay!

985
00:43:08,107 --> 00:43:11,304
