Let's go.

00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,234
Whoa! Hold it.

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,788
There it is!

59
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,555
- Get over here. Now stop it!
- (Donkey braying)

60
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,998
Hello!

61
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,635
(Echoing) Is... they... dead?!

62
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,358
They'd...

63
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,715
better be!

64
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,509
Cos I'm gonna bury 'em!

65
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,318
Let's go.

66
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,957
(Chicken clucks)

67
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,957
(Chicken squawks)

68
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,236
Aah... aah...

69
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,231
aah...

70
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,352
(Muffled clucking)

71
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,916
My brother.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,956
My brother.

73
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,316
He's dead.

74
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,433
His shoulder and leg
is pretty badly broken.

75
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,399
- You a doctor?
- Horse doctor. But bones is bones.

76
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,436
Also a blacksmith.

77
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,036
Bring brother.

78
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,276
More in the centre.

79
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,550
Oh, God...

80
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,471
we pass on to You

81
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,757
the body and soul...
of this nameless peckerhead.

82
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,751
Well, at least he went quick,

83
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,229
and he ain't going to suffer scurvy,

84
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,232
dysentery, spotted fever,
or the cholera

85
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,515
not to mention them other maladies

86
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,114
contracted in a consort
with low women.

87
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,395
Or waste years digging in the dirt

88
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,153
and finding dirt,
like I've been doing.

89
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,549
- Talk about him!
- You wanna be next?

90
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,878
And seeing how he survived that,
he could have been hit by timber,

91
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,555
fall down a shaft,
starved, get murdered

92
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,269
or committed suicide
on Christmas Eve.

93
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,593
What I mean, God, is you have
no pity for your living children,

94
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,432
so that's why we're asking you

95
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,353
to be a little kinder
to 'em when they dead.

96
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,034
So, with all due reverence, Lord,

97
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,591
we pass on to you
this corncracker's body and soul

98
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,114
to take him and to keep him...

99
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,318
I stake this claim! For me
and my new pardner, whoever he is...

100
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,233
Forever and ever. Amen.

101
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,311
Pull him up.

102
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,789
# Got a dream, boy

103
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,836

# What will I get?
I ain't equipped to say

119
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,348
# But who gives a damn?

120
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,668
# Who gives a damn?

121
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:28,599
# We're on our way #

122
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,551
# I still see Elisa

123
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,349
# She keeps on returning

124
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,271
# As breathless

125
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,388
# And young as ever

126
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,149
# I still hear Elisa

127
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,789
# And still feel a yearning

128
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,796
# To hold her against me again

129
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,992
# Her heart was made of holidays

130
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,915
# Her smile was made of dawn

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,879
# Her laughter was an April song

132
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,080
# That echoes on and on

133
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,831
# Since I saw Elisa

134
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,708
# The shadows are falling

135
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,593
# And winter is calling above

136
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,356
# But I still see Elisa

137
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,910
# Whenever I dream

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,551
# Of love #

139
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,750
Elisa. That the name of your girl?

140
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,956
Yeah.

141
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,113
Oh, I found this. I thought
it might make a good crutch for you

142
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,953
now you seem to be
getting around pretty good.

143
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,792
Thanks.

144
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,796
You know, it just
don't seem right, Mr Rumson.

145
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,678
You doing all the work
and me getting half.

146
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,548
I mean, it's your mule,
your tools and all.

147
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,278
It was your brother.

148
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,956
Well...

149
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,474
where I come from, Mr Rumson,

150
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,519
we're cautious of strangers
who talk in an easy manner.

151
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,388
Oh, you got me down for some kind
of low scuff from New Orleans, hmm?

152
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,630
Sell you patent medicine
with one hand,

153
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,676
pinch your purse with the other?

154
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,389
Matter of fact,
that's what I was thinking.

155
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,710
As a matter of fact, you're right,

156
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,314
but I ain't yet sunk
to horse stealing.

157
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,716
Oh, I've salted claims, yeah.

158
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,030
And I've sold whisky to Injuns.

159
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,032
Once a man come at me with a gun,
and I killed him.

160
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,829
I can't think of one commandment
I ain't shattered.

161
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,835
I never did fancy my parents, let
alone respect them or honour them,

162
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,673
and I have coveted
my neighbour's wife.

163
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,469
Whenever I had a neighbour
and he had a wife. Mm-mm.

164
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,154
And I gamble and I cheat at cards,

165
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,516
but there is one thing I do not do.

166
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,989
I ain't never gulled a pardner.

167
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,757
The one sacred thing, even to low
scuff like me, is a man's pardner.

168
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,230
Two pennyweight short
of four ounces.

169
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,517
Now, you pass me your pouch,
I'll pour your share.

170
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,832
And, Pardner,

171
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,071
I'll swap pouches with you
anytime you say.

172
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,233
Well... I meant no offence,
Mr Rumson,

173
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,471
and I appreciate
you saving my life and all.

174
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,676
But what's expected in return?

175
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,309
That's right. I like to know
what crops I'm planting.

176
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,517
Well, when I get dead drunk,
fall in a muddy street,

177
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,909
I expect you to come get me,

178
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,195
cos I don't want to die muddy drunk.

179
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,556
If I owe a man $100,
stand good for me,

180
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,473
and if I get melancholy,
which can happen,

181
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,757
I expect you to be
my companion and solace me.

182
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,673
What happens when you get in a fight?

183
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,072
If four of anything come at me
at one time, you might lend a fist.

184
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,754
Up until that,
I can take care of myself.

185
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,193
You see, I don't fight fair.

186
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,831
Well, I don't fight at all
unless I absolutely have to.

187
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,119
I got kind of a temper,
and once I start, I just can't quit.

188
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,751
Well, good. Just remember
that I'm on your side.

189
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,476
Well...

190
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,475
I hear a shopkeeper's pulled into
town with a wagon full of whisky.

191
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,475
What do you say I hoist you
up that mule and we go get boiled?

192
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,235
Oh, I ain't a boozing man
either, Mr Rumson.

193
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,838
Well, I am.

194
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,438
(Man) Town meeting tonight! There's
gonna be a town meeting tonight!

195
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,556
Town meeting tonight, Ben.

196
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,471
Blaah!

197
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,357
Ben! Ben Rumson!

198
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,556
Mooney! This is my pardner.

199
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,599
- I thought you went back to Ireland.
- I am. I'm just passing through.

200
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,036
- It's right on the way.
- Mooney.

201
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,992
How's it going, Willie?

202
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,516
I ain't won a hand
in three weeks, Ben.

203
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,158
This is my pardner.

204
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,075
He calls himself Rotten Luck Willie,
but that's just to get the suckers.

205
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,913
You can't beat him with five aces,
so don't play.

206
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,037
- Oh, I don't gamble.
- Neither does he.

207
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,032
(Snoring)

208
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,112
My name's Ben Rumson.
This here's my pardner.

209
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,590
And I'm buying whisky
for any man that can stand up.

210
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,676
Aha!

211
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,878
- I was sitting there.
- Now you're standing there. Whisky!

212
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,837
Ben Rumson,

213
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,675
you have an outstanding account
in the amount of $68 from Yuba City,

214
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,593
and which you skipped town on me.

215
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,432
Skipped town on you?

216
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,909
I was run out.
Don't you remember, Gus?

217
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,754
I want to be paid now before
they run you out of this town.

218
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,549
Put that damn gun down
and stand these boys the whisky.

219
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,110
Dry your hands before you weigh it.
We need supplies.

220
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,794
A pound of sugar,
half a case of whisky,

221
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,236
and a case pneumonia
for Schermerhorn there.

222
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,871
A pound of sugar and a two-pound
sack of flour, please.

223
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,234
Evening.

224
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,153
Horace Tabor,
Worcester, Massachusetts.

225
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,152
- When did you get in?
- Arrived this morning.

226
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,196
Hit a vein this afternoon,

227
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,317
and I aim to be back
in Worcester by Christmas.

228
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,757
It says here California's
going to be admitted to the Union.

229
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,638
Just what it needs... law and order.

230
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,518
- That's good news.
- Well, it ain't to me.

231
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,071
It's my policy to bust out of any
territory the day it become a state

232
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,436
- and head for the wilderness.
- I don't agree, sir.

233
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,036
You look around the human race,
you wonder what was God thinking.

234
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,315
(All grumble)

235
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,356
Oh, oh, oh!

236
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,112
# God made the mountains

237
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,397
# God made the sky

238
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,675
# God made the people

239
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,991
# God knows why

240
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,230
# He fixed up the planet

241
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,233
# As best as He could

242
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,959
# Then in come the people

243
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,315
# And gum it up good

244
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,960
# The first thing ya know

245
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,871
# They civilise the foothills

246
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,632
# And everywhere He put hills

247
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,314
# The mountains and valleys below

248
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,072
# They come along and take 'em

249
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,752
# And civilise and make 'em

250
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,230
# A place where
no civilised person would go

251
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,390
# The first thing you know

252
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,471
# The first thing you know

253
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,277
# They civilise what's pretty
by puttin' up a city

254
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,079
# Where nothin'
that's pretty can grow

255
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,639
# They muddy up the winter

256
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,714
# And civilise it into
a place too uncivilised even for snow

257
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,115
# The first thing ya know

258
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,597
# They civilise left
they civilise right

259
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,717
# Till nothin' is left
till nothin' is right

260
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,110
# They civilise freedom
till no one is free

261
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,156
# No one except

262
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,117
# By coincidence, me

263
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,760
# The first thing ya know

264
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,437
# The boozer's in prison
and the criminal, he isn't

265
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,114
# And only the rascals have dough

266
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,670
# When I see a parson
I gotta put my arse in

267
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,038
# The wagon that follows
the tail of a crow

268
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,953
# The first thing ya know

269
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,156
# I pick up and blow

270
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,075
# The first thing
you know-oh-oh-oh #

271
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,991
(Man) Ben! Ben Rumson!

272
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,877
Ben!

273
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,951
You bloody old rumpot!

274
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,110
Mad Jack Duncan! This is my pardner.

275
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,952
I heard you was in town.

276
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,510
Wait till I tell you what happened
to Harry and Ernest and me.

277
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,750
- What?
- We never went home.

278
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,718
Come on, lads!
We're having a dance. Jump in!

279
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,678
Climb on, Pardner.
We're going to a dance!

280
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,276
# Out the winder go the beans

281
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,716
# Out the winder go the beans

282
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,633
# Mary, my Mary

# So hand me down that can o' beans

320
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,836
# Hand me down that can o' beans
hand me down that can o' beans

321
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,956
# I'm throwin' it away

322
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,316
# Out the winder go the beans
out the winder go the beans

323
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,154
# Out the winder go the beans
go the beans, go the beans

324
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,519
# Good times are here to stay #

325
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,477
(Thunder rumbles)

326
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,831
Anybody seen Ben Rumson?

327
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,229
He left here about 20 minutes ago.

328
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,514
Thanks.

329
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,637
- Are you his pardner?
- Yeah.

330
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,314
He, uh, owes me $80.

331
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,550
He said you would stand good.

332
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,470
(Rumson) Hey, Pardner.

333
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,995
Can you help me get up on that mule?

334
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,672
You all right?

335
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,639
I get melancholy every now and then.

336
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,430
It's a disease common to
mountain men who live alone a lot,

337
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,071
but if you stay with me at such...
such times, uh, I'll be OK.

338
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,753
All right.

339
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,394
Did Ezra Atwell come to you
for that $80?

340
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,833
Yeah.

341
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,911
I stood good for you.

342
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,754
I guess this is what you meant,
when you said you expected me

343
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,718
to come get you
muddy drunk in the street.

344
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,395
And now you're gonna be my companion
in my moment of despair.

345
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,749
Well, you're my pardner, ain't you?

346
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,316
Hey. I like you, Pardner.

347
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,472
I like you, Ben.

348
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,759
Well, my mother and father's dead,

349
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,354
and my two brothers and myself...

350
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,432
we worked the... we worked the farm.

351
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,640
Then last year, my older brother,
he took himself a wife.

352
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,919
Me and my kid brother, we decided
to leave Michigan and come out here,

353
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,198
maybe dig some gold,
get enough money to buy some land.

354
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:59,195
'Cept now that he's gone, I don't
have too much appetite for farming.

355
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,316
Well, what about your girl?

356
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,629
- Girl?
- Yeah. Elisa.

357
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,714
Is she gonna come out and join you,
or did she marry your brother?

358
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,916
Well, to tell you the truth,

359
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,797
there is no Elisa.

360
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,393
I just...

361
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,392
read that name somewhere
and made it up.

362
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,994
Well, them's the best kind,

363
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,470
but what I need now
is the worst kind.

364
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,951
It's a living hell up here,

365
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,636
what with the bloody rain
and the bloody loneliness

366
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,076
and that bloody, bloody wind.

367
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,637
# Maria

368
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,236
# Maria

369
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,030
# They call the wind

370
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,476
# Maria

371
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,711
# Away out here they got a name

372
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,712
# For rain and wind and fire

373
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,313
# The rain is Tess

374
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,753
# The fire's Joe

375
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,550
# And they call the wind Maria

376
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,791
# Maria blows the stars around

377
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,952
# And sends the clouds a-flyin'

378
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,350
# Maria makes the mountains sound

379
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,470
# Like folks were up there dyin'

380
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,552
# Maria

381
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,792
# Maria

382
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,319
# They call the wind Maria

383
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,631
# Before I knew Maria's name

384
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,757
# And heard her wail and whinin'

385
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,037
# I had a girl and she had me

386
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,989
# And the sun was always shinin'

387
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,038
# But then one day I left my girl

388
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,351
# I left her far behind me

389
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,032
# And now I'm lost

390
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,236
# So goldurn lost

391
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,759
# Not even God can find me

392
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,638
# Maria

393
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,878
# Maria

394
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,149
# They call the wind Maria

395
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,312
# Out here they got a name for rain

396
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,437
# For wind and fire only

397
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,592
# But when you're lost and all alone

398
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,390
# There ain't no word but lonely

399
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,631
# And I'm a lost and lonely man

400
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,757
# Without a star to guide me

401
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,118
# Maria, blow my love to me

402
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,958
# I need my girl beside me

403
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,918
# Maria

404
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,631
# Maria

405
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,590
# They call the wind Maria

406
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,638
# Maria

407
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,351
# Maria

408
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,310
# Blow my love

409
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,039
# To

410
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,672
# Me #

411
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,394
(Man) Look at the women!

412
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,589
(2nd man) Look! Two women!
Look at the two women!

413
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,559
(3rd man) There's five women!
I wanna get one of them gals!

414
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,393
(Cheering and shouting)

415
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,555
(All shouting) Women! Women!

416
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,909
(Man) Hey, there's 64
women coming into town!

417
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,991
(Men cheer)

418
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,548
Hey, men, 80 women
coming down the river!

419
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,876
(Cheering and shouting)

420
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,836
Lady, I, uh...

421
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,388
got $50 here in gold dust.

422
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,031
You can have it all if you, uh...
let me hold the baby.

423
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,833
Very well.

424
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,229
No, I don't want your money for it.

425
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,153
You'll hurt his feelings,
Sarah. Take it.

426
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,797
(Baby gurgles)

427
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,072
Look at them eyes,
glowing like he just hit pay dirt.

428
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,469
He's a girl, you bummer!

429
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,028
Would anyone else
care to hold the baby?

430
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,951
(Sarah) Not now, Jacob.

431
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,190
Just where are you people from?

432
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,953
Illinois, originally.
I'm Jacob Woodling.

433
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,031
This is my wife Sarah.

434
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,351
And who might
this fine young lady be?

435
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,158
Her name is Elizabeth Woodling.

436
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,674
- Your sister?
- No. My wife.

437
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,432
(Crowd mutters)

438
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,478
Your wife?
I thought that one was your wife.

439
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,599
- They both are.
- Holy Moses! They're Mormons!

440
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,036
- Du lieber himmel!
- Nice work, old man!

441
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,519
(Laughter)

442
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,114
Can we get something
to eat over there?

443
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,749
With $50, you can, sir.
Uh, follow me.

444
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,395
What the hell is a Mormons?

445
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,232
(Speaks German)

446
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,998
Aah!

447
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,996
Hey, bridegroom,
I don't give a damn how a man prays.

448
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,471
There's room in hell for all of us,
but it just ain't equitable, man,

449
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,792
for you to be having two of
something all of us got none of.

450
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,632
Yeah! Yeah!

451
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,631
So I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

452
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,551
Your mule's lame,

453
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,394
and I got a beauty that cost me $140.

454
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,439
I'll swap you straight...
my mule for one of your wives.

455
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,114
Now... which one's baby's mother?

456
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,954
God knows I wouldn't want
to separate mother and child.

457
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,995
I am.

458
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,275
Good. I fancied t'other one, I did.

459
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,397
- (Tabor) This is immoral.
- I hope so!

460
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,517
- The woman's married.
- No, she's not!

461
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,718
We don't recognise plural marriage
in California.

462
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,076
Then I bid $250 in gold for her.

463
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,116
- 260!
- 265!

464
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,794
Wait! You can't buy
a woman for money.

465
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,634
- Try and get one without it.
- (Laughter)

466
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,154
All right, what about it, Mormons?

467
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,629
Jacob, we need every penny,

468
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,871
and I can't bear another day
of those martyred looks.

469
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,439
There it is again.

470
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,432
This ain't a martyred look, Sarah.

471
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,238
This look is pure...

472
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,673
hatred.

473
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,079
Quiet!

474
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,116
Brigham Young has 27 wives,

475
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,590
and he hasn't had half the trouble
with them I've had had with you two.

476
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,558
Then simplify your life, Jacob.
Sell me.

477
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,871
But, Elizabeth,
you don't know what you'll get.

478
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,791
I know what I've had.

479
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,758
(All laugh)

480
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,433
- Go ahead, Jacob.
- Gentlemen...

481
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,112
out here...

482
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,350
I ain't a Mormon.

483
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,000
Now, Elizabeth
is a headstrong woman,

484
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,878
especially since
her own baby died two weeks ago,

485
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,428
but she's given
her consent to be sold.

486
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,230
Therefore, if any of you
want to bid for her, so be it.

487
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,799
But...

488
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,998
let's go outside...
where there's room for more people.

489
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,312
Ooh! But these religious dogs
are bloody greedy!

490
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,391
Ah, come on! Come on!

491
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,070
You wait here and feed the baby.

492
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,594
It's not proper,
you standing on a block.

493
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,672
If anyone wants to inspect you
I'll send them in.

494
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,036
Order! Order!

495
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,829
I intend to conduct this auction
in an orderly manner!

496
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,751
And no bids in Spanish.

497
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,833
The last bid was $265
and two blankets.

498
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,151
$265, two blankets and a jackass!

499
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,119
A two-pound sack of coffee,
a two-pound sack of brown sugar...

500
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,113
Holbrook, even if she is bought,
how will she marry who bought her?

501
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,113
She'll be married according to the
prevailing law of this community,

502
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,156
which is mining law,

503
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,552
and she will be treated
like any other legal claim!

504
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,959
(Cheering)

505
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,554
(Holbrook) Order! Order! Order!

506
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,990
(All shouting bids)

507
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,151
(Holbrook) Order! The man bids $275,

508
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,869
four blankets, one pickaxe,

509
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,996
and a bedpan.

510
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,674
Hey, Mooney...
Mooney, there's a woman in the saloon

511
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,035
with a baby
pressed against her breast.

512
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,519
That's right.

513
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,354
Wait. It ain't every day
that we got a woman in Atwell's

514
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,069
- pressing her breast with her baby.
- That's right, Ben.

515
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,116
(Shouting bids)

516
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,349
- Clendennon...
- Shh!

517
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,194
There's a woman in Atwell's
pressing her breast to the saloon.

518
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,794
I know, Ben,
and we're bidding for her.

519
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,429
(Holbrook) Sam Fletcher bids $300,
four blankets...

520
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,078
Ben, where you going?

521
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,711
There's a breast in Atwell's
pressing a woman against her.

522
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,109
- You better stay here.
- Huh?

523
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,871
Look! There's another one!

524
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,520
Well, he's a Mormon.
He has two wives.

525
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,593
- I'll kill him.
- Ben, they're bidding on her now.

526
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,390
Whatever the bid is...
whatever the bid is, I double it!

527
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,913
Ohh!

528
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,352
(Holbrook) $400 was bid last!

529
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,879
Mr Ben Rumson gallantly
doubles that bid to $800!

530
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,115
- (Cheers)
- 800 once...

531
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,192
Wait! I'm his pardner,
and he withdraws the bid.

532
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,874
- You have power of attorney?
- Power of what?

533
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,793
Written permission,
signed and witnessed.

534
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,678
If he could do that,
he'd talk for himself.

535
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,957
800 twice!

536
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,314
Wake up, Ben. Come on.

537
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,633
Sold to Mr Ben Rumson for $800!

538
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,312
(Cheering)

539
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,837
He only looks that way
when he's drunk, ma'am.

540
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,832
You ain't exactly
seein' him at his best,

541
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,673
but once I get him
washed down and clipped,

542
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,433
I think you'll be
agreeably surprised.

543
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,959
# Get the soap and water
whoop-ti-ay

544
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,198
# Get the soap and water
whoop-ti-ay

545
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,396
# Got a sweet perfumer

546
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,674
# To try his humour

547
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,911
# It's Ben's weddin' day

548

# Wash him down and clip him

549
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,112
# Wash him down and clip him

550
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,715
# He's got a blue-eyed wonder
to put him under

551
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,711
# It's his weddin', yeah!

552
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,271
# Ben's weddin', woo!
Ben's weddin' day #

553
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,748
# Where am I goin'?

554
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,434
# I don't know

555
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,318
# Where am I headin'?

556
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,198
# I ain't certain

557
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:00,391
# All I know is I am on my way

558
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,713
# Amen #

559
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,153
Dearly beloved,

560
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,949
we have gathered together
to grant this man, Ben Rumson,

561
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,192
exclusive title to this woman,
Mrs Elizabeth Woodling,

562
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,635
and to all her mineral resources.

563
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,995
I have drawn up this record of claim,

564
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,356
which here and henceforth
will be recognised

565
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,396
as a certificate of marriage.

566
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,278
So I ask you, Ben,

567
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,148
do you recognise this claim
as a contract of marriage,

568
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,756
and do you take this woman
to love, honour and cherish?

569
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,639
Oh, he does.

570
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,314
Elizabeth Woodling,
do you take this man, Ben Rumson,

571
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,155
to love, honour, and obey him
until death do you part?

572
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,068
She does.

573
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,310
I now pronounce you

574
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,155
claimed and filed
as Mr and Mrs Ben Rumson.

575
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,515
(All cheering)

576
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,596
(# Carnival music)

577
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,757
# Mr Rumson went to town

578
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,876
# Ridin' on a pony

579
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,919
# Bought a wife and brought her home
and called it matrimony #

580
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,351
# Mr Rumson bought a bride

581
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,237
# Out in Californy

582
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,470
# He'd have saved a lot of money

583
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,516
# Stayin' drunk and horny #

584
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,117
# Oh, Susannah,
he's happy as can be

585
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,236
# For he's got him somethin' better

586
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,515
# Than a banjo on his knee #

587
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,715
# Rumson, he got married today

588
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,791
# Married today, married today

589
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,110
# Rumson, he got married today

590
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,714
# What'll he do tomorrow? #

591
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,474
Hey, Ben! I'll be glad
to help you work your claim!

592
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,516
(Laughter)

593
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,992
(Gunshots)

594
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,317
I'll be bedding down
by the fire if you need me.

595
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,073
You'll not regret taking me in,
Mr Rumson.

596
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,116
I'll make you a good wife.

597
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,876
You sure as hell will.

598
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,998
I don't fault you
for taking me for an easy woman.

599
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,355
I was bought and paid for.

600
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,718
But you bought me for a wife,
not a whore.

601
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,271
If you come again at me again like
a slavering dog, I'll shoot you!

602
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,476
Watch where you point that thing.

603
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,279
You'd blow my manhood
halfway to the moon.

604
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,592
I mean to make you a good wife and
honour this contract of marriage,

605
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,194
but only if you
will honour it as well.

606
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,919
I don't know what
you mean by honour it.

607
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,719
I know your sort of man, Mr Rumson.

608
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,510
My father was the same sort,
born under a wandering star.

609
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,310
I ain't fool enough to bond you
with all the tyrannies of marriage.

610
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,472
All I want is your name, Mr Rumson,

611
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,678
and the least measure
of respect due to a man's wife.

612
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,230
But... most of all...

613
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,039
I want you to build me a cabin.

614
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,875
A cabin... that'll stand up
in winter with a fireplace of stone

615
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,270
and a door I can bolt if I have to.

616
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,076
And if you do that,

617
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,958
I will say
you have honoured the contract.

618
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,750
But if you regret having bought me,
Mr Rumson, say so now.

619
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,118
And if I have to work forever,
I'll see you get your $800 back.

620
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,509
I admire your pioneer spirit and
your straightforward manner, ma'am.

621
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,355
Is that what you've been admiring?

622
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,908
I've been admiring you, ma'am.

623
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,110
All right, I'll build you a cabin,

624
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,395
and I'll give you my name proudly.

625
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,153
You're Mrs Ben Rumson,

626
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,959
and I'll kill
any man that says you ain't,

627
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,350
and I'll stick to it till I move on,

628
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,353
which is when the gold pinches out
or the first snow of winter.

629
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,838
You...

630
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,278
you ain't gonna claim duress later
just cos I held a gun on you?

631
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,112
No, ma'am,

632
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,430
I ain't going to claim duress.

633
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,794
I seem to lack all sense
of shame with you, Mr Rumson.

634
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,875
(Cheering)

635
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,439
Hey, Ben!

636
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,273
These men came all the way
from Fiddler's Camp

637
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,191
just to see your wife.

638
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,589
(Man) Hiya, Ben!

639
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,912
Well, looks like I married myself
a tourist attraction.

640
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,195
Some of these boys hiked 15 miles.

641
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,469
Ben, how's married life?

642
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,030
Pardner, it was so good,
I forgot that I was married.

643
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:34,079
Wow. I'd hike 15 miles
to look at that myself.

644
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,350
I can see it ain't gonna be easy

645
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,477
married to the only woman
in these mountains.

646
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,594
(Cheering)

647
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,871
All right, boys!

648
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,669
The lady wants a cabin to live in,

649
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,149
a proper cabin made out of wood

650
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,071
that'll hold up in the winter!

651
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,436
So just don't sit there gaping -
get to work!

652
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,678
# Send back the world

653
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,036
# There's too much night for me

654
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,874
# The sky is much too high
to shelter me

655
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,758
# When darkness falls

656
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,638
# Four cabin walls

657
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,474
# Would be just right for me

658
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,358
# I need a threshold I can cross

659
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:53,073
# Where I can sit
and gather moss forevermore

660
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,836
# A million miles away

661
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:04,597
# Behind the door

662
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,070
# Roll up the plains

663
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,232
# There's too much view for me

664
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,719
# There's so much space

665
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,591
# Between the waiting heart
and whispered word

666
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,229
# It's never heard

667
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,198
# One room will do for me

668
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,034
# Where every evening
I can stare at someone

669
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:34,752
# Smiling from his chair
across the floor

670
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:41,029
# A million miles away

671
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:47,275
# Behind the door

672
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,672
# Where every evening
I can stare at someone

673
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,072
# Smiling from his chair
across the floor

674
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,712
# A million miles away

675
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:29,432
# Behind the door

676
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,318
# No fears

677
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,755
# No fools

678
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,671
# No lies

679
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,354
# No rules

680
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,513
# Just doing with my life

681
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:50,119
# What life is for

682
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,910
# A million miles away

683
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,111
# Behind

684
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,398
# The door #

685
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,076
Elizabeth.

686
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,672
Elizabeth?

687
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,273
Elizabeth?

688
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,156
Where have you been?

689
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,993
I was down at the rapids
taking a bath.

690
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,231
You mean you was taking a bath?

691
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,995
I mean I was taking a bath.
What do you think I mean?

692
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,072
You was down at the rapids just now,

693
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,311
bare beam... and buck naked?

694
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,631
I'm not like to take a bath
with my clothes on, Mr Rumson.

695
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,996
Are you trying to tell me
you was taking a bath?

696
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,913
That's right. I was taking a bath.

697
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,231
In the middle of the night?

698
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,518
Mr Rumson,
in a community of 400 men,

699
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,878
would you rather I took my bath
bare beam and buck naked

700
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,269
in the middle of the day?

701
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,911
What's the matter with you?

702
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,956
What's the matter with me?

703
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:43,033
I ain't running around in the
middle of the night in MY drawers.

704
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,351
Hey! Hey, boys!

705
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,192
Listen to this.

706
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,592
"The proprietors of the
Hares and Hounds Club in Sonora

707
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,319
"wish to announce that six ladies

708
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,393
"are expected to arrive by stage
from San Francisco

709
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,074
"on the 15th of August."

710
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,116
How about that, huh?

711
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,111
That's a hundred miles away.

712
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,078
What good is that gonna do us?

713
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,720
Ain't no one trying
to steal your wife, Ben.

714
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,951
I'll admit there's a few
who wouldn't mind trying.

715
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,749
Horace Tabor, for instance.
He likes to give her a look.

716
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,796
Horace Tabor?

717
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,677
Come on, Ben.

718
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,230
He just looks. She doesn't
encourage him or anybody else.

719
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,198
But you're beginning
to cut a comical figure.

720
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,236
Everybody's laughing at you.

721
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,709
I would've never thought of Tabor.

722
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,313
(Door opens)

723
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,272
What the hell
are you looking at, Horace Tabor?

724
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,353
I'm looking for my stirring stick.

725
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,715
You make any more
advances towards my wife,

726
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,554
and I'm gonna shoot you down
like mother-lovin' the dog you are!

727
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,279
That goes for the rest
of you horny gorillas!

728
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,873
You want something to do?

729
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:24,590
Put up your money for them six
French tarts coming into Sonora!

730
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,877
But keep your lusting,
lechering minds off of my wife!

731
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:34,035
I'd advise you, Rumson,
not to refer to me as a dog again.

732
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,715
- Is that clear?
- I'll stick my fist in your ear!

733
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,712
- Why you!
- Grab Tabor! Stop him!

734
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,155
Get back! Get ahold of him!

735
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,708
(Elizabeth) Mr Rumson!

736
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,190
- Rumson, I...
- Mr Rumson!

737
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,953
Nobody has behaved unseemly to me.

738
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,828
I have been treated with nothing
but kindness in this camp,

739
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,835
and you owe every one of these men,
especially Mr Tabor, an apology.

740
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,275
By God, you're right!

741
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,271
I don't know what's come over me.

742
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,397
I've been behaving like a damn fool,

743
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,517
and I wish to beg
your communal pardons,

744
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,195
and especially yours, Horace Tabor.

745
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,236
Well, I suppose if I was married

746
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,834
to the only woman
in the neighbourhood,

747
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,593
I might be just as demented.

748
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,716
And, Mrs Rumson! Uh, Mrs Rumson,
may I extend my compliments?

749
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,109
You are as wise as you are fair.

750
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,272
Get your hands off me!

751
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,510
That lunatic tried to kill me!

752
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,239
I demand a town meeting...

753
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,153
...to consider
a proper course of action.

754
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,878
(All mutter) Yeah...

755
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,520
If that knife
had come one inch lower,

756
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,398
I would not be here today.

757
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,311
(All) That's right. Yeah.

758
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:02,077
My fellow citizens, as long
as that madman prowls among us,

759
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,549
- no one is safe.
- (All mutter) Yeah.

760
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,758
Therefore, we must
find a solution by tonight.

761
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:15,029
Let us not wait until the condition
worsens... or his aim improves!

762
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,031
(All) Yeah!
(Holbrook) Order!

763
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,872
Mr Chairman!

764
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,430
The chair recognises Ezra Atwell.

765
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,596
I would like
to ask Ben Rumson directly

766
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,877
if he doesn't think
that with a little sober effort

767
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,269
he could control
these fits of jealousy?

768
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,750
No. It's getting worse every day.
Sorry, I can't help you.

769
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,991
The chair recognises Ben's pardner.

770
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,513
Thank you, Mr Holbrook.

771
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,751
I've been giving it
some considerable thought

772
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,594
ever since Ben Rumson,
my pardner here, poor bastard...

773
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,636
Oh, excuse me, ma'am...

774
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,712
Well, ever since he became a lunatic.

775
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,236
What's putting
the strain on Ben's mind

776
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,357
is having the only woman
for 90 miles around here.

777
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,956
Now, my proposal is that we
get some more women for this town.

778
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,349
How you gonna get women
to come up here?

779
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,919
(Holbrook) Order!

780
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,434
I know where we can get some women.

781
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,149
The six French bawds arriving
in Sonora a week Saturday.

782
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,639
Ben, you're right.

783
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,632
Why don't we get them
to come up here instead?

784
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,712
How? If I was a French bawd,
I'd go to Sonora.

785
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,439
If you was a French bawd,
we'd have no trouble.

786
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,715
How will we get 'em up here?

787
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,598
They gotta take
the stage from Sacramento

788
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,353
and change horses
at Starbottle's Pass.

789
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,796
So five of us go down there,
hijack that stage,

790
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,916
re-route them tarts up here instead.

791
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,956
What's so hard about that?

792
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,112
- (Muttering)
- It all sounds just fine to me.

793
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,112
- When do we go?!
- Order! Order!

794
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,998
Is it your proposal, Mr Rumson,

795
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,231
that we knock out
the stage driver, steal a coach,

796
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,197
and kidnap six women?

797
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,555
Sounds better every time I hear it.

798
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,154
You fail to see
what's wrong with this?

799
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,639
What's wrong?

800
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,110
Well, if you don't consider
assault and battery,

801
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,430
grand larceny and kidnapping wrong,

802
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,080
what the hell do you consider wrong?

803
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,833
- Oh, you maniac!
- Sit down!

804
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,879
- You insane man!
- Schermerhorn, you're out of order!

805
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,315
- What?
- I yield the floor.

806
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,231
Proceed, Schermerhorn.

807
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,912
- What?
- Speak!

808
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,992
You maniac! You insane man!

809
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,117
What do you think them people
in Sonora will do

810
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,760
when we hijack their Fruleins?

811
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:39,789
They grab their guns
and come up here to get them back!

812
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,394
(Muttering)

813
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,629
(Banging gavel)

814
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,438
Order, order!

815
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,115
- Gentlemen!
- Mr Atwell has the floor.

816
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,034
Gentlemen, it is 50 miles
from here to Starbottle's

817
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,076
without a road or a trail.

818
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,071
Not even my mule can do it.

819
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,196
Oh, you lunatics!

820
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,919
Besides a civil war with Sonora,

821
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,232
you want to put us
in the white slave business!

822
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,914
Schermerhorn, you're out of order!

823
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,752
Again?

824
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,751
You haven't been recognised!

825
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,796
I'm Schermerhorn.

826
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,599
- Mr Holbrook.
- Oh, sit down!

827
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,398
Ben, these boys are right.

828
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,472
Mr Holbrook,
I withdraw the proposal.

829
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,632
- (Muttering)
- Have you gone out of your skull?

830
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,996
You can't expect them
to build a two-storey building

831
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,992
- just to get women here.
- Who said two storeys?

832
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,753
Somebody's got to run
the faro tables.

833
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,796
Rotten Luck Willie will.

834
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,838
You can't expect him
to build a fancy building

835
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,912
with chandeliers
and masterpieces of art

836
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,151
and gambling
and six beautiful tarts upstairs.

837
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,152
Ben, we'd have every bummer
for miles around

838
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,312
coming here to spend
his money on women and whisky

839
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,550
at Atwell's and Schermerhorn's.

840
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,596
You think that's bad?

841
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,756
Why, it's terrible!

842
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,671
Just terrible!

843
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:07,038
You'd turn this camp into a
boom town! We don't want to do that.

844
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:10,476
- Soon there'd be another saloon.
- And a bawdy house!

845
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,109
- And another gambling hall!
- And another bawdy house!

846
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,919
Why, property
would shoot straight up!

847
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,709
They'd make more money
selling old claims than gold.

848
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,190
These men didn't come
out here to forge a nation!

849
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,751
That's for men with a big dream,
with visions of America's greatness.

850
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,831
Well, I'm warning you,

851
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,435
if you want to turn us into
a dreary boom town metropolis

852
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,795
filled with nothing
but millionaires,

853
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:43,797
all you gotta do is put up one
little, tiny two-storey... cathouse!

854
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,677
I say let's put it to a vote.

855
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,194
And any man opposed is a traitor!

856
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:53,912
All those in favour of bringing
prostitution to this camp, say aye!

857
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,831
(All) Aye!

858
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,715
Passed!

859
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,520
Pardner, there's a shifty side to you

860
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,194
that I'm just beginning
to appreciate.

861
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,350
Why can't I go along with you?

862
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,476
Who'll take care of Elizabeth?

863
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,552
Lt'll take three days
to get them tarts back here.

864
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,633
You don't expect me to leave a feast
like her alone in all this famine?

865
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,915
Who can I trust if it ain't you?

866
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,356
You didn't say being pardners
meant wife-guarding.

867
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,635
Well, it just come up.

868
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,991
(Cheering)

869
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,317
- (Man) Howdy.
- Captain Barnsfeather, Fort Sumter.

870
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:10,076
- When does the Sonora stage come?
- About four o'clock tomorrow. Why?

871
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,799
Uh, supplies for the troops.

872
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,233
Unmount!

873
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,396
(Elizabeth humming)

874
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,437
Come in, Pardner.

875
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,553
(Humming)

876
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,676
You sure I'm not intruding?

877
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,796
Come in.

878
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,991
(Humming)

879
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,435
Will Ben really
get back in three days?

880
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,755
- Why?
- I'd like to know.

881
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,395
Who you expecting for dinner?

882
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,394
You! Sit down.

883
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,637
Oh. Thanks.

884
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,472
(Humming)

885
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,278
I didn't know you was expecting me.

886
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,995
(lnaudible over music)

887
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,550
# I talk to the trees

888
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,758
# But they don't listen to me

889
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:41,231
# I talk to the stars

890
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:45,871
# But they never hear me

891
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:50,078
# The breeze hasn't time

892
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:54,597
# To stop and hear what I say

893
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:59,276
# I talk to them all

894
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,397
# In vain

895
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,994
# But suddenly my words

896
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:12,234
# Reach someone else's ear

897
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:19,874
# Touch someone
else's heartstrings, too

898
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:26,555
# I tell you my dreams

899
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,633
# And while you're listening to me

900
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,474
# I suddenly see them

901
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,949
# Come true

902
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,476
# I can see us on an April night

903
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:47,599
# Looking out across a rollin' farm

904
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,878
# Having supper in the candlelight

905
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,839
# Walkin' later arm in arm

906
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:00,151
# Then I'll tell you
how I passed the day

907
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:05,233
# Thinking mainly
how the night would be

908
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:09,552
# Then I'll try to find
the words to say

909
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:14,111
# All the things you mean to me

910
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,398
# I tell you my dreams

911
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,837
# And while you're listening to me

912
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:29,391
# I suddenly see them

913
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:36,835
# Come true #

914
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,075
They're coming out of Starbottle's!

915
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,831
All right! Fall together!

916
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,639
Hey, put me down, you bloody idiot!
Put me down!

917
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,995
Down, down, down, down!

918
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,433
Ow!

919
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,636
(Rumson) That's it! Get in line!

920
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,275
Come on! Come on, move!

921
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,556
(Driver) Yah! Yah!

922
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:08,552
- Whoa, now! Whoa!
- (Horses neigh)

923
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,395
Captain Barnsfeather, Fort Sumter.
At your service, ladies.

924
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,994
Here to protect you along the way!

925
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,234
We're gonna
have to take this detour.

926
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:24,269
- Detour through open country?
- The road up ahead ain't safe.

927
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,636
- Injuns!
- Ain't no Injuns around here!

928
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,390
- (Panicked shouts)
- Get back in the coach, ladies.

929
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,233
(All shouting)

930
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,350
- There's a coach comin' in!
- There's a coach comin' in!

931
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,796
- Comin' in!
- Comin' in!

932
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,190
# There's a coach comin' in
if you listen, you can hear it

933
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:11,590
# A-clip-cloppin' over the hill

934
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,956
# And the sound that you hear
is as good to your ear

935
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,350
# As the call of
the wild whippoorwill

936
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,910
# There's a coach comin' in
you can feel it gettin' near

937
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,231
# All at once,
and it bursts into view

938
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:28,995
# And it looks to your eye
like it fell from the sky

939
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,913
# Like a coach
full of dreams come true

940
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,595
# For it's bringin' me
eyes that are moonlight

941
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:39,195
# And it's carryin' lips
that are wine

942
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,397
# And it's comin'
with arms that are pillows

943
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,995
# And this evening
it all will be mine

944
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,390
# There's a coach comin' in
and you're smellin' like a steer

945
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,756
# Get the soap out,
it ain't far away

946
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:56,355
# Cut the socks from your feet
cut the socks from your feet

947
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,750
# Rake your hair till it's neat
rake your hair till it's neat

948
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,512
# There's a coach comin' in

949
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,910
# There's a coach comin' in today

950
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,470
# There's a coach comin' in

# With a cargo o' joy from Paree

952
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,196
# Drop the tables and chairs
get them beds up the stairs

953
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,989
# And be sure
every lock has a key... #

954
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,435
(Women shrieking and shouting)

955
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,518
# For it's coming mit girls

# Who wear powder

# Who will have to go
somewhere to get them

958
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:46,074
# And the somewhere to go will be me

959
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:49,630
# There's a coach comin' in
and it's flyin' like a deer

960
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,951
# Thank the Lord
there's relief on the way

961
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,749
# Thank with all of your hearts,
thank with all of your hearts

962

# A-clip-cloppin' over the hill

966

# And the sound that you hear
is as good to your ear

967
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,429
# As the call
of a wild whippoorwill... #

968
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,317
(Women screaming)

969
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:36,150
# For it's bringin' me eyes
that are moonlight

970

# And this evening
it all will be mine... #

973
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,756
(Whooping and hollering)

974
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,870
# There's a coach comin' in
you can feel it gettin' near

975
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,236
# All at once,
and it bursts into view

976
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,790
# And it looks to your eye

977
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,429
# Like a coach
full of dreams come true

# For it's bringin' me
eyes that are moonlight

01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,117
# And it's carryin' lips
that are wine

980
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,556
# And it's comin'
with arms that are pillows

# There's a coach comin' in
now it's riding in the clear

# And the sound of it grows to a din

984
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:57,830
# No, there ain't far to go

985

# Now they're hollerin' "whoa!"...#

986
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,989
Whoa!

01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,878
# There's a coach comin' in,
there's a coach comin'

01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,510
(Cheering)

990
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,156
(# La Marseillaise)

991
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,433
Ben!

992
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,391
Pardner, I wanna talk to you!

993
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:36,399
Why, you rotten, lecherous,
deceiving, no-good, thieving...

994
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,392
The only reason
I ain't blowing your brains out

995
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,596
is the relief it's gonna give me

996
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,513
when I tear you apart
with my bare hands.

997
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,238
What's the matter with you?

998
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,756
What was the two of you
doing on the same horse?

999
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,957
Riding. What else?
That's the last place I'd...

1000
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,555
- Where was HER horse?
- That WAS her horse.

1001
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,155
And where... ha ha... was your horse?

1002
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:03,118
You had my horse.

1003
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,559
(Sighs)

1004
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:13,270
If that's true,
why ain't you fighting back?

1005
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,430
Cos you ain't been yourself lately.

1006
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,876
That's a widely known fact,
and you know it yourself.

1007
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,830
Get up, Pardner.

1008
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,716
How's your jaw?

1009
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,870
Feels like it's coming off.

1010
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,269
You ought to trust me, Ben.

1011
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,396
You're right.

1012
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,837
You ain't the kind of man to go
lusting after another man's wife,

1013
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:46,230
especially with them six bawds
arriving in town.

1014
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,437
That's right, Ben.
I wouldn't do that.

1015
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:55,072
The only kind of feelings
you'd ever have would be deep ones,

1016
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,116
and if you had 'em for Elizabeth,

1017
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,954
you'd come and tell me
before you would her.

1018
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,794
That's right, Ben.
That's what I'd do.

1019
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,950
You're a good man, Pardner.

1020
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,110
That's what
I was coming to do, Ben...

1021
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:12,317
tell you I got
some deep feelings for Elizabeth.

1022
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,276
Ben, you hit me one more time,
I'll bust your skull open.

1023
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:23,069
Nothing's happened,
and nothing's gonna happen...

1024
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,390
cos I'm leaving.

1025
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,908
You're breaking up the partnership?

1026
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,279
If I hang around here long enough
watching you and her together,

1027
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,999
I'll become
as big a lunatic as you are.

1028
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,472
All right.

1029
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,233
I'll go get your share
of the gold dust.

1030
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:00,034
You can have the mule
and that new gold pan.

1031
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,308
You can even have the rocker,
if you want to.

1032
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:17,152
(Elizabeth) What's the matter, Ben?
Where you taking the rocker?

1033
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,879
It's for Pardner. He's going away.

1034
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,511
Going away?

1035
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,114
He... he never mentioned
going away to me.

1036
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,077
Of course he didn't.

1037
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,232
You don't know that man
like I do, Elizabeth.

1038
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,834
What are you saying, Ben?

1039
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,960
He loves you. That's why he's going.

1040
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,479
I don't want Pardner to go, Ben.
I love him.

1041
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,315
(Rumson) Unpack, Pardner.
You ain't going nowhere.

1042
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,994
That woman loves you.

1043
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:07,032
And that puts a new wheel
on the wagon, don't it?

1044
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,631
Now, you get this straight, Ben.

1045
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,678
I'm not gonna take away your wife,
and that's final.

1046
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,432
But you love her.

1047
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,397
So do you.

1048
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,075
There's only one way for anybody
to be happy and that's...

1049
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:26,517
for one of us to move
away and forget it, and I'm going.

1050
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,476
Now, get out of my way.

1051
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,918
Pardner, there comes a time
in the life of every partnership

1052
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,515
when the party of the first part
has no recourse

1053
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,798
except to knock some sense
into the party of the second part!

1054
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,836
You're staying!

1055
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,793
What happened?

1056
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,030
He's staying.

1057
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:26,835
- Is he hurt?
- No, ma'am. Just tired.

1058
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,952
He'll be good as new
in a couple of weeks.

1059
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,756
Where you going, Ben?

1060
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,308
You love Pardner? You take him.

1061
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,595
And you take good care of him.

1062
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,911
That's the decentest man
I ever run across.

1063
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,956
And the strongest.

1064
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,519
Now...

1065
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,990
I know you women like
things legal, so here's what.

1066
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:59,755
It takes two weeks for you
to be an abandoned claim.

1067
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,436
After that, you take the name
of your new owner

1068
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,114
and file it
down at the mining office.

1069
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,395
Then everything'll be legal.

1070
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,154
Ben!

1071
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,595
I don't want you to go.
I love you.

1072
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,229
What are you talking
about, Elizabeth?

1073
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,432
You're my husband.
I don't want you to go away.

1074
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,273
- What was that?
- Don't let him go, Pardner.

1075
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:40,679
- You said she was in love with me.
- Didn't you say you loved him?

1076
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:43,149
Yes, I did, and I do.

1077
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,435
You just said you were
in love with Ben.

1078
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,351
Yes, I did, and I am.

1079
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,349
Ben, do you, uh...
get that feeling you need a drink?

1080
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:57,750
- How did you know?
- Cos I do, too.

1081
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:02,719
- But, Pardner, you don't drink.
- No, but I'm changing.

1082
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:06,393
Hmm, and it takes a woman to do it.

1083
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,396
Bless their hearts.

1084
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:17,953
(Coughs)

1085
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:23,114
Now, Elizabeth, let's try
and be reasonable about this.

1086
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,674
For God's sake, make up your mind!

1087
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,756
I can't.

1088
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,316
I love both of you.

1089
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,359
But that ain't going to work.
You can't have both of us.

1090
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,954
- Why not?
- Why not?

1091
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,758
Why not?

1092
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,833
Cos, uh... a woman
can't have two husbands.

1093
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,350
Well, I was married
to a man who had two wives.

1094
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,000
Why can't a woman have two husbands?

1095
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,389
Because you can't.

1096
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,789
Well, why?

1097
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:01,031
You explain it to her, will you, Ben?

1098
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,031
I'd like to oblige, Pardner,

1099
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:06,874
but I'll be damned
if I can think of a reason.

1100
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,509
Out here we make up
our own rules as we go along.

1101
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,592
A man with two wives
wants to sell one at auction,

1102
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,636
nobody thinks twice about it.

1103
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,756
And if a town needs females,

1104
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,479
hijacking 'em
seems the natural thing to do.

1105
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,677
And if two pardners
want to share a wife, why not?

1106
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,558
This ain't Michigan.
It's gold country.

1107
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,632
Why, hell, it's the golden country!

1108
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,837
Untouched and uncontaminated
by human hands!

1109
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:36,196
It's where people can look
civilisation in the eye and spit!

1110
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:40,592
You don't have to please anybody,
don't have to love thy neighbour.

1111
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,478
It's wild, human and free,

1112
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:47,394
and all over this nation,
they preach against it every Sunday.

1113
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:50,153
But I don't think God's listening.
You know why?

1114
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:54,119
Because he's here...
in glorious California!

1115
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,272
You trying to tell me, Ben,
that you're willing?

1116
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,679
(Elizabeth) I am.

1117
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:05,153
I think it's a humane,
practical, beautiful solution.

1118
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:08,118
- It does make a lot of sense.
- It don't.

1119
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,272
It don't in Michigan.
It does in California.

1120
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:14,909
- What's everybody gonna say?
- Who are you talking about?

1121
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,879
You mean everybody in town
playing with them French horns?

1122
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,157
They'd be damn glad
to have two less in line.

1123
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,231
- Ben, you're right.
- Of course I'm right.

1124
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:38,233
It's not like somebody was asking
you to do something immoral,

1125
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,072
like stealing gold!

1126
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:43,516
- It ain't as bad as all that.
- What the hell's bad about it?

1127
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,955
Show me on that list of commandments

1128
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:48,838
where it says a woman
can't have two husbands.

1129
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:51,309
There ain't no commandment like that!

1130
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,998
Hot damn! I think it's great!

1131
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,036
It's history-making!

1132
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,396
Can't hold it.

1133
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,997
- Elizabeth...
- Yes, Ben?

1134
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,469
We will be three... for dinner.

1135
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,716
(# Instrumental medley)

1136
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:09,917
(Man) Shameless harlots!

1137
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,755
You think the Lord was some boy in
a raggedy old sheet 2,000 years ago?

1138
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:18,594
Well, you're wrong!
He's here now and he sees you!

1139
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:28,710
Ye godless jaspers! Who are you?

1140
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,394
Freemasons? Rosicrucians?

1141
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:34,836
Heathen emissaries
from the dens of Babylon?!

1142
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:37,480
Boozers. Gluttons.

1143
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:40,358
Gamblers. Harlots.

1144
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,032
Fornicators!

1145
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,151
What's a fornicator?

1146
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:48,630
I don't know.
I ain't a religious man.

1147
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,791
The stench of the city
is in the nostrils of the Lord,

1148
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,518
and it's making him sick.

1149
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,433
The Lord ain't going
to take it much longer!

1150
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:06,149
Come on up, parson,
and get some old-time religion.

1151
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:08,674
(Laughter)

1152
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:16,474
Mrs Rumson. How are your husbands?

1153
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,471
Fine. Thank you, Mr Atwell.

1154
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:22,235
Husbands? Did I hear husbands?

1155
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,869
You animals! You pagans!

1156
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,673
O God, Lord of hosts,

1157
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,558
close thine eyes, then hold thy nose.

1158
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:35,552
I am passing through
the garbage of humanity!

1159
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:36,834
(Laughter)

1160
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:38,433
Come on, dearie.

1161
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:42,752
Scum, keep your filthy claws
off my wife, Princess Hummingbird!

1162
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,159
(Laughter)

1163
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:46,470
You heathen swine!

1164
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,518
Do you know what God done
to Sodom and Gomorrah

1165
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,673
when he couldn't find 50 righteous
men in them stinking cities?

1166
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,113
(All) No!

1167
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,839
I'll show God a place
where there ain't 40.

1168
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,876
- (All) Yeah!
- 30!

1169
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:02,076
- Yeah!
- Two!

1170
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,993
- Yeah!
- Or one!

1171
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:08,038
- Yeah!
- And here it is.

1172
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:09,109

1211
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:59,838
Evening, Pardner.

1212
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,876
Evening, Elizabeth.

1213
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:04,110
Evening, Ben.

1214
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,713
Evening, Elizabeth.

1215
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:34,073
I hear...
George Lonergan pulled out today.

1216
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:37,277
(Elizabeth) He's smart.
(Pardner) He's broke.

1217
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:41,478
Ben thinks placer mining's
all but finished in these parts.

1218
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:45,071
What are we gonna do?

1219
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:48,357
I hear talk of
a strike up to Red Dog.

1220
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,670
I'm not leaving my home, Ben.

1221
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:53,991
I wasn't suggesting it.

1222
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,670
I'll live on grass and mud water
before I'd do that.

1223
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:02,275
Ben isn't asking you
to leave your home.

1224
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:04,078
Damn it! Why won't you leave?

1225
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:07,277
You like this town as much
as I like Schermerhorn!

1226
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:10,557
That's right,
I hate what this town has become,

1227
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:13,108
but it's one place
we can live together.

1228
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:17,678
And... there's nothing I hate

1229
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:21,355
as much as I... love
the two of you and this cabin.

1230
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,715
Now, if you want
to go up to Red Dog,

1231
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:26,917
you go ahead and go,
but I'm staying here.

1232
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,355
You come back whenever you want to.

1233
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,830
The only thing stopping you
being the perfect woman

1234
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,512
is your stubbornness.

1235
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:38,798
Somebody should hit you till it's
gone. Somebody's gotta support us.

1236
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,474
You can't go through
a whole winter here alone.

1237
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:43,710
I won't leave her here alone.

1238
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:47,509
You mean you'd let this man
who took care of you

1239
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,591
and nursed you back to health

1240
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:54,390
light out alone while you sleep
through winter like a fat groundhog?

1241
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,835
If he goes, you go.

1242
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:58,990
And I ain't going.

1243
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,631
Well, I'll go, then.

1244
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:05,676
If he goes, you go with him.

1245
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:09,799
Didn't I just tell you you can't go
through a winter alone here?!

1246
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,515
You ever see such a stubborn woman?

1247
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,158
No, I never did.

1248
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:20,597
But if you ever hit her, you'll
have to deal with me straightaway.

1249
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:47,709
I sure am one tired man tonight.

1250
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,268
Must be from lifting
those cards all night.

1251
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,796
I only played a few hands
last night, Elizabeth.

1252
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,348
I had a lucky streak, too.
I broke even.

1253
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:04,439
You'll tell Three-Fingered Sweeney
I'll pay him next week, huh?

1254
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,956
You was playing poker last night?

1255
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:10,476
Yeah, I was playing poker
and you was tired. Remember?

1256
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,273
Oh. Well.

1257
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:18,399
I think I'll go down and have a
last drink with them three limeys.

1258
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:22,632
- They're pulling out tomorrow.
- How much does he owe Sweeney?

1259
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:25,314
Now, wait a minute.
I won't take your money.

1260
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,038
Why not?

1261
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:30,635
Cos a man don't do that
in Michigan or in California.

1262
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:34,269
That's all right with me, but if you
want to keep your manhood,

1263
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:37,670
quit trying to beat
three aces with a pair of fours.

1264
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,796
See you at breakfast.

1265
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:43,718
(Music and chatter)

1266
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:15,835
Sorry, boys.
Pardner ain't playing tonight.

1267
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:30,398
- Willie?
- What?

1268
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,233
- Have you seen Mad Jack?
- He's over there.

1269
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:39,519
Hey, I want to convert
this dust into dollars.

1270
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,718
Look out! He's losing gold dust
every time you bump his elbow.

1271
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:48,715
There's more spilled here in one
night than we've dug up in a month.

1272
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,076
Must be a pirate's fortune
under them floorboards.

1273
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:55,550
- Where are you heading?
- Where I can find some gold.

1274
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:58,712
Fleshpot Hill,
Brass Monkey Ravine. I don't know.

1275
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,554
Save your souls
and help build a house for the Lord.

1276
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:06,428
He can have my shack, parson.
I'm moving out.

1277
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:10,354
You heathen scum. Money.

1278
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:13,830
And the Lord sayeth,
"Money is the root of all evil."

1279
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:16,150
The Lord sayeth that
cos he ain't rich.

1280
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,515
- He knoweth about you...
- You don't say?

1281
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:21,160
Living in that cabin.
You're going to hell!

1282
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,470
I hope so. If it ain't too far down,

1283
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:28,270
I'll tunnel and get some gold dust
that's fallen through these floor...

1284
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:39,633
How do you figure we can
dig a tunnel without being seen?

1285
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,950
We'll dig down from
the floor in our cabin,

1286
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:46,272
under the street,
and right up under here.

1287
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:48,476
- A tunnel?!
- You idiot!

1288
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,631
(Snoring)

1289
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:20,356
Why, you... Dig now. Hit him later,
lunatic.

1290
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:24,752
- What the hell's happening?
- We're tunnelling under Willie's.

1291
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,718
After that gold dust
under Willie's floor, eh?

1292
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,156
How in the hell did you know that?

1293
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:36,268
- Been thinking about it for weeks.
- Why didn't you speak up, eh?

1294
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:39,033
- You dirty, lazy, drunken...
- Oh, hey!

1295
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,793
- Lazy, am I? Damn you, Duncan!
- Shut up!

1296
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:45,350
- Look, dig now. Hit him later.
- Shh! Right.

1297
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:48,034
- You can hit me later.
- I'll remind you.

1298
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,554
Don't forget. Pardner's in on this.

1299
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:52,915
- Then where is he?
- He's at home.

1300
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,991
- Doing what?
- Damn you!

1301
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:58,072
Keep a civil tongue
in your mouth, or I'll...

1302
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:01,630
- You can hit him later.
- Right. You can hit me later.

1303
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:03,790
And I'll remind you. Dig!

1304
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:14,195
Hey, Willie, you seen Ben Rumson?

1305
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:15,633
Uh-uh.

1306
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:37,274
- Sorry.
- Close the bloody door.

1307
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:46,918
- Oh, you're digging a hole.
- You don't miss a trick, do you?

1308
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,635
Ben?

1309
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:57,713
Pardner, we got big news for you.

1310
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:00,917
- You're doing what?
- We ain't stopping at Willie's.

1311
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,709
There's 16 gambling halls,
seven hotels and 21 saloons.

1312
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,678
Mad Jack figures
we can build tunnels under them,

1313
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,479
honeycomb Main Street,
one end to the other.

1314
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:14,394
- What do we do with all that earth?
- Give it to the meek.

1315
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,630
- Have you gone crazy?
- He's not crazy.

1316
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:20,156
There's a lot of gold dust
going through those floors.

1317
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:22,276
I think there's more than a lot.

1318
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:25,352
I think maybe there's
enough for the winter.

1319
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,678
Hurry up and eat this, both of you.

1320
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,558
Coffee will be ready in a minute.

1321
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:36,835
I don't want you to be late to work.

1322
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,552
# The earth is pure muck

1323
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:54,517
# Muck's a good thing

1324
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,670
# And oozin' with mud

1325
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:58,591
# Mud is just fine

1326
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,432
# It's drownin' in bog

1327
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,511
# Bog is good luck

1328
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:04,511
# And crawlin' with crud

1329
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,318
# Crud's a good sign

1330
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,197
# The poor, they got hope

1331
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:12,874
# The rich can buy soap

1332
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:18,715
# What rainbows ain't got a pot of

1333
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,792
# And I ain't got a spot of

1334
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,509
# A few feet down there's a lot of

1335
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,511
# Just waitin' to buy

1336
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:30,352
# Tobacco and rye

1337
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:33,159
# From now till I die

1338
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:40,079
# The best things in life are dirty

1339
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:42,151
# And nothing in life is

1340
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,958
# Better to hold than dirty gold

1341
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:46,270
# The best things in life are

1342
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:51,229
# Filthy, dirty hunks
of gold, gold, gold

1343
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:59,356
# There's more than just gold

1344
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,078
# Gold is enough

1345
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:03,037
# That's buried below

1346
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:05,031
# Beautiful gold

1347
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:06,872
# There's seed in the ground

1348
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,678
# Loveable gold

1349
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:10,591
# Just waitin' to grow

1350
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:12,796
# Spendable gold

1351
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,836
# A man has his creed

1352
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,511
# And mine is all greed

1353
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:23,158
# What banks have bulgin' accounts of

1354
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:27,152
# And I ain't got an ounce of

1355
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:31,710
# Below there's endless amounts of

1356
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,836
# Just dirty old trash

1357
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,831
# That turns in a flash

1358
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,273
# To dirty old cash... #

1359
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,554
Uh-huh!

1360
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:43,679
(Crash)

1361
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:53,955
# The best things in life are dirty

1362
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:56,031
# The worst thing in life is

1363
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:57,917
# Wakin' up clean without a bean

1364
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,230
# The best things in life are

1365
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:07,590
# Filthy dirty hunks
of gold, gold, gold

1366
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:22,829
# The best things in life are dirty

1367
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,876
# The worst thing in life is

1368
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,791
# Being content without a cent

1369
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:29,030
# The best things in life are

1370
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:34,752
# Filthy dirty hunks
of gold, gold, gold, gold

1371
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:38,276
# Stinkin' rotten chunks
of blimey, slimy

1372
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:40,396
# Lousy, lovely... #

1373
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:48,869
(All) Gold.

1374
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:24,720
Hey, you bummers, over here!

1375
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,076
I found him in the mountains.
He's half-frozen.

1376
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:31,197
He says there's a wagon train
marooned up there.

1377
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,396
Get up a rescue party!

1378
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:39,440
Let's get out of these mountains
before a storm comes up. Pack up!

1379
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:42,796
You've arrived at the height
of the season, Mr Fenty,

1380
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:47,112
but we'll find hotel space
for the whole bloody lot of you.

1381
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:49,998
If you can shake your family
and don't die,

1382
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:52,071
you'll have one hell of a time.

1383
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:55,357
We shouldn't take
respectable people to No Name City.

1384
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:59,513
We can put up a few up at our place.
Can you take the rest?

1385
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:03,434
(Man) Have you got room in your
cabin for a couple of invalids?

1386
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:08,839
Ben's bringing in her husband.
Mrs Fenty, this is Mrs Rumson.

1387
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:12,629
I'm Mrs Fenty's son, Horton.
This is my sister Laura Sue.

1388
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:15,678
Here are some blankets.
Keep warm by the fire.

1389
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:26,036
I'll take care of the children.

1390
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:29,634
Your husband
is a good man, Mrs Rumson.

1391
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:31,278
Yes, they are.

1392
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:34,716
I said that husband
of yours is a good man.

1393
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,872
Yes, uh, thank you, Mrs Fenty.
Don't you worry.

1394
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:42,112
Those children went straight to
sleep. I'll see to Mr Fenty now.

1395
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:45,670
- Thank you, Mr Rumson.
- Oh, my name's not Rumson, ma'am.

1396
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,512
That's my wife's name.

1397
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:55,352
Now, I'll bet that seems
a little confusing, don't it?

1398
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,396
A little, yes.

1399
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:02,073
How is it you and your husband
don't have the same name?

1400
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,390
Oh, well, that's easy to explain.

1401
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:07,758
It is?

1402
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:14,711
(Rumson) In the Chinese section
of town was the Pagoda Hell Saloon,

1403
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:19,510
and upstairs there lived
a real Mandarin princess

1404
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:23,195
who invited me over
occasionally for a little egg roll.

1405
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,714
- (Elizabeth) Ben.
- (Knock on door)

1406
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:28,951
I'm entering to pray
for the unfortunate victims.

1407
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,838
Parson, these folks
have suffered enough.

1408
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,595
Why don't you do that outside
where God can hear better,

1409
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:37,636
cos I'll be talking in here.

1410
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:41,952
You can't talk to the parson
that way in front of these people.

1411
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:44,315
This is a nice, church-going family.

1412
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:47,472
Now, go see where Pardner is
with the supplies.

1413
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:49,118
Yes, ma'am.

1414
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:53,239
Mr Rumson, will you tell me
the rest of the story after dinner?

1415
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:56,198
Sure. About 10 years after dinner.

1416
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:59,238
(Coughing)

1417
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:06,474
I'll take care of
your little sister. You keep warm.

1418
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:15,076
Mrs Rumson, if the other
gentleman is your husband,

1419
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:16,991
who's Mr Rumson?

1420
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,957
He's my husband's partner.

1421
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,554
Well, how is it you have his name?

1422
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:26,120
Just a coincidence.

1423
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:27,519
Oh.

1424
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,956
What are you talking about?
Elizabeth ain't sick.

1425
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:35,079
You listen to me. She's picked up
a bad case of the respectabilities.

1426
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:38,914
In a few days she'll
be burning up in a fever of virtue.

1427
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,958
- And then look out.
- Why?

1428
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:44,031
It's been my experience

1429
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:47,271
that there's nothing
more ruthless and treacherous

1430
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,794
than a genuine good woman.

1431
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:00,712
Ben, you have to put up
at Atwell's tonight.

1432
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,153
What?

1433
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:05,357
I can't tell them I'm living with
two men. I just can't.

1434
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:08,000
Elizabeth, you ain't
making any sense.

1435
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:12,312
If you want to be respectable,
how come Mr Rumson has to move out

1436
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:15,073
while Mrs Rumson
stays with another man?

1437
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:17,628
If anybody leaves, it ought to be me.

1438
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:21,190
You can't. I already
told them Pardner was my husband.

1439
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:25,637
- Tell them you've made a mistake.
- It's only for one or two nights.

1440
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:29,076
It'll be six weeks
before they can move!

1441
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:31,754
Only a farmer's
dumb enough to get froze

1442
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,876
and tough enough to survive it.

1443
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:35,552
Damn farmers!

1444
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:38,757
- All right, I'll sleep out.
- Where you going?

1445
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:41,434
- To get my things.
- I got 'em right here.

1446
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:48,912
Mm-hm.

1447
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:58,870
See you in the tunnels, Ben.

1448
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:45,197
- You moving out, Ben?
- No.

1449
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:47,157
Me, neither.

1450
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:51,153
I guess there's two kinds
in the world, Ben.

1451
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:55,233
People who move, people who stay.
Ain't that true?

1452
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:57,390
No, that ain't true.

1453
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:59,357
Well, what's true?

1454
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,749
Oh, there's two kinds of people.

1455
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:06,072
Them going somewhere
and them going nowhere...

1456
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:07,593
and that's what's true.

1457
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:09,875
I don't agree, Ben.

1458
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:13,748
That's cos you don't know
what the hell I'm talking about.

1459
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,195
I'm an ex-citizen of nowhere,

1460
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:19,192
and sometimes I get mighty homesick.

1461
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:28,712
# I was born

1462
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,759

1468
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:52,638

01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:19,910

1485
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:49,275

1509
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:47,673
(Laughter and shouting)

1510
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:58,876
Willie, could you accommodate me
for a couple of days?

1511
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:00,837
Sure. Take your pick.

1512
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:03,593
No. I mean a room I can sleep in.

1513
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:05,750
We don't rent empty beds.

1514
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:08,752
Just till them
sick farmers leave my house.

1515
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:11,354
Wait. Clotilde's
gone off for a while.

1516
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:14,273
- Use her room.
- What happened to Clotilde?

1517
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:18,035
Some bummer says if she don't
marry him, he's gonna kill her.

1518
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:21,351
She took off to give him
a chance to simmer down.

1519
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:24,955
She said she'd marry him.
He wants her to quit working.

1520
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:27,315
That's a narrow-minded attitude.

1521
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:38,516
(Sniffing)

1522
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:42,318
- Whew.
- Yeah. She's a fancy smeller.

1523
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:51,436
Damn farmers.

1524
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:57,040
(Snoring)

1525
01:55:57,120 --> 01:55:59,076
(Knock on door)

1526
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:01,754
(Man) Sugar, guess who this is?

1527
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:05,752
Sugar, guess who this is.

1528
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,752
(Sniffing)

1529
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:19,991
Hey, by gum,
I must have been down here too long.

1530
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:22,878
You're beginning
to smell like a woman.

1531
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:26,793
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr Rumson.

1532
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:30,350
You're an hour late.
Who the hell's the stranger?

1533
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:33,398
He won't tell anybody.
He's practically family.

1534
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:36,438
Just wanted to see
what a gold mine looked like.

1535
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:41,071
You open your mouth about this,
I'll put a stick of dynamite in it.

1536
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:43,594
You tell no one, do you hear?

1537
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:46,717
- I swear before God.
- I said no one.

1538
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,677
Start at end of number four.

1539
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:51,718
Work an extra hour
to make up for being late.

1540
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:01,438
- How's Elizabeth?
- Oh, she's fine.

1541
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:04,512
In fact, we'd like to have you
for dinner tonight.

1542
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:08,115
- Is that right?
- Yeah. 6:30. Is that all right?

1543
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:10,156
That's mighty neighbourly,

1544
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:13,471
but I got to play the organ
for the parson tonight.

1545
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:16,949
Well, possibly some other time.

1546
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:29,040
Well, if you're
one of the family, dig!

1547
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:35,876
Mr Rumson, I swore
I wouldn't tell anyone.

1548
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:38,110
I hope that means
except my parents.

1549
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:41,192
That means especially
your mother and father.

1550
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,236
I've never kept secrets before.

1551
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:46,596
It's about time you started,
cos when you do,

1552
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:49,478
a whole new world opens up.

1553
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:56,113
You got that kind of cold,
empty feeling inside of you?

1554
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:58,555
Yes, I do.
Do all gold miners get that?

1555
01:57:58,640 --> 01:58:01,837
- It's very common.
- What do they do for it?

1556
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:05,316
I'll show you.

1557
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:12,596
Are we going in a saloon?

1558
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:15,592
Well, that's where
the medicine closet is.

1559
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:19,514
It's part of that whole new world
I was telling you about.

1560
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,516
After you, Columbus.

1561
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:26,679
# Gentle music fills the sky

1562
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:29,957
# At No Name City

1563
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:32,554
# And the days, they whisper by

1564
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:35,279
# At No Name City... #

1565
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:36,759
Come on.

1566
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:39,274
# Sure, there's not
a spot as rare in

1567
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:43,638
# All heaven or in Erin

1568
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:47,190
# Let me live until I die

1569
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:50,716
# In No Name Town #

1570
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:04,759
(Hiccups)

1571
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,872
Ahh.

1572
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:19,952
That's good.

1573
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:21,871
My first drink.

1574
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:36,432
Ahh.

1575
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:40,075
You, uh... feeling all right?

1576
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:42,310
Oh, yes, sir. Thank you.

1577
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:48,673
That, uh, cold, hollow feeling
is almost gone.

1578
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:50,876
Bartender, cigars.

1579
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,632
Thank you.

1580
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:20,630
I'll bet that's the strongest cigar
you ever smoked.

1581
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:25,190
It's the first cigar I ever smoked.
It's delicious.

1582
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:28,832
(Choking)

1583
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:30,876
You all right, Mr Rumson?

1584
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:32,916
(Gasping) Yeah, fine.

1585
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:52,439
Why do you think my father
is so dead set against saloons?

1586
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:56,593
Cos farmers ain't got the time
to enjoy the good things in life.

1587
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:58,716
Farmer's got a busy day.

1588
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:02,031
Got to pull them turnips,
talk about the weather.

1589
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:04,315
That's about as much
as he can handle.

1590
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:05,992
(Women shouting)

1591
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:10,958
Quiet!

1592
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:14,589
- Who are they, Mr Rumson?
- Oh, they're on the menu.

1593
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:19,036
I don't understand, sir.

1594
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:28,235
Now, Horton...
now, you ain't gonna tell me

1595
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:31,073
that you ain't never
had a woman, neither?

1596
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:33,435
No, sir, I haven't.

1597
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:36,956
That's abso... Why, that's terrible!

1598
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:41,431
Do you know you could go blind?
We got to do something about that.

1599
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:43,078
I wouldn't know what to do.

1600
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:46,869
Don't worry. With your talent,
you'll catch on in no time.

1601
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,278
Uh, Willie, ahem...

1602
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:55,557
if you was to go trapping
for the first time,

1603
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:58,438
who would you take along as a guide?

1604
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:03,638
That would be Gracie.
She loves adventure.

1605
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,036
Oh, Grace, uh...

1606
02:02:30,120 --> 02:02:32,714
I give you the boy.

1607
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,756
Give me back the man.

1608
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:47,558
- That was the best, Mr Rumson.
- You think so?

1609
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:51,679
I like smoking and drinking
but they can't touch the last one.

1610
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:53,352
That's got everything.

1611
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:56,750
Most people'd go along
with that. Well, good night.

1612
02:02:56,840 --> 02:03:00,355
Mrs Rumson will be sorry
you're not coming for dinner.

1613
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:03,830
- She said to be sure and bring you.
- Oh?

1614
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:07,071
- Well, in that case, maybe I will.
- Good.

1615
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,956
I'll walk you home after.

1616
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:16,712
Now, remember, you wasn't in no
tunnels and wasn't in no saloon.

1617
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:18,870
I remember.

1618
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:22,350
We thank thee, Lord,
for the two of these friends...

1619
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:25,717
Shut the door, will you, Ben?

1620
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:30,709
For this we thank thee, Lord.

1621
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:32,791
- Amen.
- (All) Amen.

1622
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:38,269
- Will you wipe your feet off?
- Evening, Ben. Come sit down.

1623
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:40,316
Evening, Elizabeth.

1624
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:50,834
Well, Pardner,
you handled grace pretty good.

1625
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:54,674
Not as good as Horton did this
afternoon, but pretty good.

1626
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:59,548
- Where have you been, Horton?
- Uh, gold mining, Pa.

1627
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:03,599
Your son is the most natural-born
gold miner that I ever met.

1628
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:06,672
I brought him up not
to be afraid to try anything.

1629
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:09,399
Well, that boy tries everything.

1630
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:14,508
Did you know that the Fentys had
an apple farm back in Pennsylvania?

1631
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:19,310
- Applejack, huh?
- No, we did not make applejack.

1632
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:21,755
- Then why grow apples?
- Mr Rumson,

1633
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:26,038
should everything that comes out
of the earth be used for liquor?

1634
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:27,553
Whenever possible.

1635
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:29,870
(Mrs Fenty) You should read
the Bible.

1636
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:31,996
(Rumson) I have read the Bible.

1637
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:34,310
Didn't that discourage you
about drinking?

1638
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:36,595
No. Killed my appetite for reading.

1639
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:41,639
We've been telling the Fentys
what good land's all around here.

1640
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:43,950
(Mr Fenty) We might settle here.

1641
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:45,712
Oh, great!

1642
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:48,712
That news is so Goddamn great,
I need a drink.

1643
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:52,873
Don't listen to him.
He's always joking.

1644
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:57,953
- Elizabeth, the whisky's gone.
- I know. I poured it all out.

1645
02:04:58,040 --> 02:04:59,758
You what?

1646
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:02,274
Out of courtesy to our guests, Ben.

1647
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:05,875
If you want a drink,
get your carcass out of this house.

1648
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:10,437
You can't order a man
out of his own house.

1649
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:13,239
- His house?
- That's right. It's his house.

1650
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:17,518
- Mrs Rumson is married to him?
- She's married to the both of us.

1651
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:20,831
- At the same time?
- Well, we're pardners.

1652
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:24,151
- I have never heard...
- Shut up and sit down!

1653
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:28,119
- Don't order the guests around.
- Why not? It's his fault.

1654
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:32,113
Without his respectability
we'd still be a happily married...

1655
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:33,428
triple.

1656
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:36,876
- There's not one drink of whisky?
- Take mine.

1657
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,791
(Rumson) You saved my life.

1658
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:42,111
Horton, how did that bottle
get into your pocket?

1659
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:43,349
Horton...

1660
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:46,034
How long have you been
drinking hard liquor?

1661
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:47,439
Since this afternoon.

1662
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:51,308
You don't approve, but until
you've had a good cigar and whisky,

1663
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:54,153
you're missing
two of the best things in life.

1664
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:57,391
- Horton...
- Where'd you take him, Ben?

1665
02:05:57,480 --> 02:05:59,277
Damn you, Ben Rumson.

1666
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:01,874
What are you gonna
teach this boy next?

1667
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:07,080
How to cheat at cards or
physical education with some floozy?

1668
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:10,277
- That's the best one.
- Horton!

1669
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:13,591
Is that what you did today, Ben?

1670
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:15,716
That's what HE did today.

1671
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:20,430
He's got a talent for dissipation
that is absolutely unique.

1672
02:06:21,560 --> 02:06:22,913
Out.

1673
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,911
Get out!

1674
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:27,836
I order you out of this house!

1675
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:31,435
This is not your house!
This is my house!

1676
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:34,353
That's right. I give her the house.

1677
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:40,035
If you cross this threshold again,

1678
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:42,714
I'll shoot you
like any other marauder.

1679
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:45,109
What's she so het up about?

1680
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:47,509
She's got a right to be.

1681
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:51,388
You had to take your revenge
on the virtue of this boy,

1682
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:54,278
show him what an ugly town
this really is.

1683
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:57,318
Well, if we live here,
then we're ugly, too.

1684
02:06:57,400 --> 02:07:00,039
I could never go back
to what we had before.

1685
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:02,918
It's over and it's done
and it's finished.

1686
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,718
Now get out.

1687
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:07,633
Wait. If Ben goes, I'd have to go.

1688
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:09,950
Then you go, too.

1689
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:35,358
- Evening, ma'am.
- Good evening, ma'am.

1690
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:41,277
You mutton-headed clunk.

1691
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:43,794
You knew she didn't
want them to know.

1692
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:46,235
Elizabeth's a sick woman.

1693
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:49,471
Ben, you got no respect
for anybody or anything.

1694
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:51,915
I don't have your kind of respect,

1695
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,434
sitting there
with your hands folded

1696
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:58,229
and that pious look on your face
after a hard day's thieving.

1697
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:01,392
- It ain't thieving.
- Then why are we hiding it?

1698
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:04,438
Why are we talking about it?
She's all alone.

1699
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:06,875
- Whose fault is that?
- Yours.

1700
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:08,712
Hers. She threw us out.

1701
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:11,837
Don't say anything
against Elizabeth around me.

1702
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:16,198
I'll say anything I want. She's my
wife, paid for, and don't forget it.

1703
02:08:18,120 --> 02:08:20,076
I never do forget it.

1704
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:25,119
I got nothing more to say to you.

1705
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:27,555
You got nothing I want to hear!

1706
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:29,835
If I catch you
sneaking back without me,

1707
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:31,876
they'll never find
all of you to bury!

1708
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:36,040
Bull and bear fight!
Bull and bear fight!

1709
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:39,874
See the great bull that cut up
the mountain lion in Sonora

1710
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:43,236
and emerged triumphant
over 10 large dogs!

1711
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:45,629
(Parson) Save your souls,
heathen scum!

1712
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:48,632
Allow this butchery
to take place on Sunday,

1713
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,915
and God will wash his hands of you!

1714
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,797
Thank you, parson. Now go.

1715
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:55,189
God is gonna cause
the earth to open

1716
02:08:55,280 --> 02:09:00,149
and swallow up this nest of evil,
and the Lord ain't fooling.

1717
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:01,673
(Rumbling)

1718
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:05,639
I hear strange rumblings
in the earth below.

1719
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:09,873
Yeah, they're gonna sell
a lot of tickets

1720
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:12,349
to the bull and bear fight
on Sunday.

1721
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:15,034
A lot of gold dust is gonna fall.

1722
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:18,032
But Jack, we don't have
a tunnel under there!

1723
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:22,556
(Growling)

1724
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:27,077
You bloody maniac!
Why didn't you build one?!

1725
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:30,675
We can get under there by Sunday.
There's nothing to it.

1726
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:34,712
Maybe so...

1727
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:40,313
but we could sure use a bit of help.

1728
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:50,837
Hey. Hey.

1729
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:52,956
What about that young farmer?

1730
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:55,156
- Where's he?
- Horton Fenty?

1731
02:09:55,240 --> 02:09:57,196
Little did I realise it,

1732
02:09:57,280 --> 02:10:01,193
but when he set foot on the
second storey of Willie's Saloon,

1733
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:03,236
history was in the making.

1734
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:06,232
- Is that where he is?
- That's where he always is!

1735
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:09,630
Puffing cigars, drinking,
and knocking on doors.

1736
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:14,236
If he don't slow down, them girls
are gonna strike for shorter hours.

1737
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:18,631
I'll see if I can catch him
between rooms tonight.

1738
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:23,874
If we could divert his energy,
we could be through by morning.

1739
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:29,952
Come on, bet.

1740
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:32,472
I'll bet 50.

1741
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:37,639
- I'll see that and raise you 50.
- Not for me. I'm out.

1742
02:10:40,440 --> 02:10:43,318
Have you seen
the future father of our country?

1743
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:46,358
- Yeah. He went home.
- When will he be back?

1744
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:50,115
- Soon as his folks get to sleep.
- Tell him I want to see him.

1745
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:52,668
Leave your door open
and wait your turn.

1746
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:56,553
Here.

1747
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:09,278
Uh, pardon me, sir.
Could you lend me $10?

1748
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:12,515
Why don't you go home and go to bed?

1749
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:15,672
I was thinking of doing it
the other way around.

1750
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:21,232
Thank you, sir.

1751
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:23,276
I'll see your 50.

1752
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:27,629
(Croupier) Red seven wins again!

1753
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:46,116
Pardon me.

1754
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:49,997
Here's your $10 back, sir,
Oh. And 10 more.

1755
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:52,036
Red seven.

1756
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:11,879
You're losing a lot of money,
Pardner. Where do you get it all?

1757
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:14,076
- Thieving.
- (Laughs)

1758
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:25,955
# I would give the world to see
how I used to be

1759
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:29,715
# When I had no axe to grind

Here's your day's earnings, Ben.

1812
02:16:19,120 --> 02:16:21,475
And here's yours, Pardner.

1813
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:27,473
Jack, tell Ben
something for me, will you?

1814
02:16:27,560 --> 02:16:29,471
(Jack) He's right there.

1815
02:16:29,560 --> 02:16:33,473
Just tell him that I'm moving on
before winter sets in.

1816
02:16:33,560 --> 02:16:35,915
He can get himself another pardner.

1817
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:39,754
You bummers can, uh,
divide up anything I got coming here.

- Where you heading?
- Red Dog.

1819

I hear they're digging it up
in chunks over there.

1820

By gum, they're always digging
it up in chunks somewhere else.

- Good luck, man.
- Thanks, Jack.

is doom! Doom!

You are not going to fight
that bear on the Sabbath.

1841
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:12,119
I represent the Lord, and the Lord
says get out of this arena.

Out, out!

1843
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:17,070
He will open the earth,
and you will sink into the pit!

You hear?!

1845
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:25,156
I said, sink into the pit.
I said, sink into the pit!

1846
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:31,757
- Well, I'll be God damned.
- Hello, parson.

the valley of the shadow of death...

Oh! Have you seen Pardner and Ben?

- Ben Rumson!

(All) There he is!

1869
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:30,679
Go down and get him!

02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:33,556
(Pardner) Ben! Where you going?

1871
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:40,556
# No Name City, No Name City

1872
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:42,995
# The Lord don't like it here

1873
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:45,071
# No Name City, No Name City

1874
02:21:45,160 --> 02:21:47,549
# Your reckonin' day is here

1875
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:49,790
# No Name City, No Name City

1876
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:51,598
# Here's what He's gonna do

1877
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:53,830
# Gobble up this town
and swallow it down

1878
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:56,070
# And goodbye to you

1879
02:21:56,160 --> 02:21:58,435
# Will you go to heaven,
will you go to hell?

1880
02:21:58,520 --> 02:22:00,636
# Go to hell

1881
02:22:00,720 --> 02:22:03,234
# Either repent or fare thee well

1882
02:22:03,320 --> 02:22:05,151
# Fare thee well

1883
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:07,549
# God'll take care of No Name City

1884
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:09,870
# Comes the end, it won't be pretty

1885
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:11,279
# Here it is

1886
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:14,557
# I mean, here it is

1887
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:16,073
# Here it is

1888
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:18,515
# I mean, here it is

1889
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:21,160
# Here it is

1890
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:27,713
# I mean, here it is #

1891
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:34,389
# For in heaven or in Erin

1892
02:22:34,480 --> 02:22:37,472
# Let me live until I die

1893
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:41,109
# In No Name Town

1894
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:47,320
# Let me live until I die... #

1895
02:22:50,040 --> 02:22:54,033
(Man) Let's get out of here.
I think this place is crumbling.

1896
02:22:56,280 --> 02:22:59,511
(Banging and groaning)

1897
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:01,556
(Panicked shouts)

1898
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:03,073
(Woman screaming)

1899
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:22,350
(Woman wailing)

1900
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:30,033
(Yelling)

1901
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:32,872
Be calm, my dear.

1902
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:36,834
(Screaming)

1903
02:23:38,280 --> 02:23:41,511
(Elizabeth) Oh, Pardner, where's Ben?

1904
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:50,268
What the hell are you doing there?

1905
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:57,759
(Elizabeth) I didn't like that town,

1906
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:01,310
but it'll seem funny
not having it there.

1907
02:25:03,880 --> 02:25:06,474
It's gonna be a cold,
long, hard winter without it.

1908
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,195
I'm not leaving my home, Pardner.

1909
02:25:13,480 --> 02:25:15,232
I know that.

1910
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:19,476
Do you have to go?

1911
02:25:20,360 --> 02:25:23,079
Can't we all try...
living the way we used to?

1912
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,799
No.

1913
02:25:29,880 --> 02:25:31,836
No, I can't.

1914
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:36,830
You see, ever since
that night the Fentys came

1915
02:25:36,920 --> 02:25:38,512
and we were...

1916
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:41,637
you and I were like
a real husband and wife...

1917
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:49,393
I... couldn't live with you
any other way.

1918
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:54,673
And you belong to Ben.
He shared you with me.

1919
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:57,274
I didn't share you with him.

1920
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:02,872
Ma'am...

1921
02:26:33,160 --> 02:26:34,718
Whoa, mule.

1922
02:26:36,120 --> 02:26:38,793
Did you know
them farmers was unpacking?

1923
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:40,598
You mean the Fenty party?

1924
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:44,753
That might sound like a party to you,
but it ain't my idea of one.

1925
02:26:44,840 --> 02:26:47,035
Hop in. You can't get out that way.

1926
02:26:50,480 --> 02:26:52,038
Come on. Giddy up.

1927
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:55,635
I didn't see they was building
a church and a courthouse

1928
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:58,473
- till the town went under.
- Neither did I.

1929
02:26:58,560 --> 02:27:02,109
- You still heading up to Red Dog?
- Yeah. Still am.

1930
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:04,350
Well, I don't care where we go

1931
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:08,274
as long as I stay a hundred miles
ahead of civilisation.

1932
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:11,191
You moving out, Ben?

1933
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:13,236
You want me to die?

1934
02:27:13,320 --> 02:27:15,914
I can just see this valley in a year.

1935
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,673
All broke out
in white clapboard houses,

1936
02:27:18,760 --> 02:27:21,274
schools, churches,
courthouse, museum.

1937
02:27:21,360 --> 02:27:24,477
Ugh. Just one big, bad dream.

1938
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:30,473
- What about Elizabeth?
- I'm gonna miss that woman.

1939
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:33,233
But you can't blast her
out of that cabin.

1940
02:27:33,320 --> 02:27:36,915
Funny, here we go and build a town
just the way we like it,

1941
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,956
and then we go and sink it.

1942
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:40,996
Giddup, mule!

1943
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:45,356
Come on. Come on. Giddup.

1944
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:48,318
- Come on.
- Pull up, Ben.

1945
02:27:48,400 --> 02:27:50,356
Whoa, mule.

1946
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:53,196
What's the matter?

1947
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:57,670
I'm staying. I have to.

1948
02:27:57,760 --> 02:28:01,309
I always said
you had a farmer's mentality,

1949
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:04,517
but you're still the best
pardner there ever was.

1950
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:08,872
Well, you're the only
pardner there ever was.

1951
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:11,520
Then that makes me the best.

1952
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:15,793
Ain't you gonna say
goodbye to Elizabeth?

1953
02:28:15,880 --> 02:28:17,836
No. I don't think I'll do that.

1954
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:20,275
I'll get melancholy enough later on

1955
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:22,828
without picking up an extra load now.

1956
02:28:22,920 --> 02:28:25,753
You say something nice
to her for me, Par...

1957
02:28:26,840 --> 02:28:29,354
Say, what the hell
is your name anyway?

1958
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:33,311
Sylvester Newel.

1959
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:36,798
Sylvester Newel.

1960
02:28:36,880 --> 02:28:39,235
Yeah, just one "l".

1961
02:28:39,320 --> 02:28:42,073
Well, that's a good name
for a farmer.

1962
02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:45,719
Well...

1963
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:50,549
- So long, Pardner.
- So long, Ben.

1964
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:58,117
Never liked a man
as much as I liked you.

1965
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:02,994
Giddup! Giddup!

1966
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:33,670
Ben says goodbye, Elizabeth.

1967
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:38,435
Aren't you going with him?

1968
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:44,952
No.

1969
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:50,110
No, I'm not going anywhere.

1970
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:04,513
Do you think
he'll be all right, Pardner?

1971
02:30:07,120 --> 02:30:08,917
Where's he going?

1972
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:10,877
# Where am I goin'? I don't know

1973
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:12,712
# Where am I headin'?
I ain't certain

1974
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:16,270
# All I know is I am on my way

1975
02:30:16,360 --> 02:30:18,316
# When will I be there? I don't know

1976
02:30:18,400 --> 02:30:20,038
# When will I get there?
I ain't certain

1977
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:23,032
# All that I know
is I am on my way

1978
02:30:23,120 --> 02:30:25,111
# Got a dream, boy

1979
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:26,792
# Got a song

1980
02:30:26,880 --> 02:30:30,509
# Paint your wagon and come along

1981
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:32,909
# Where am I goin'? I don't know

1982
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:34,718
# When will I be there?
I ain't certain

1983
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:38,110
# What will I get?
I ain't equipped to say

1984
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:42,113
# But who gives a damn?
I'm on my way

1985
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:43,952
# Where am I goin'? I don't know

1986

1989

# When will I get there?

1990
02:30:53,320 --> 02:30:56,630

02:30:56,720 --> 02:31:00,952
