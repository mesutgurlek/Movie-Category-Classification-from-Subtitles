Darlin', in my wildest dreams

1118
01:11:07,195 --> 01:11:12,338
I never thought I'd go

1119
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:17,507
But it's time to let you know

1120
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:21,347
I'm gonna harden my heart

1121
01:11:21,576 --> 01:11:25,319
I'm gonna swallow my tears

1122
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:31,590
I'm gonna tum and leave you here

1123
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:36,669
AH of <i>my</i> fife I've been wa:'t:'n' in the rain

1124
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:40,739
I've been waiting for a feeling
That never, ever came

1125
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:42,671
It feels so close

1126
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:46,540
But always disappears

1127
01:11:50,138 --> 01:11:51,583

1128
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,018
[SINGING]
Oh, oh, <i>oh</i>

1129
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:06,030
Mm, mm, ah, ah
Oh

1130
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:10,637
Darlin', in your wildest dreams

1131
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:16,633
You never had a clue
