<i>Deadliest Catch is on.</i>

24
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,964
- What are you wearing?
- It's a unitard.

25
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,267
Guys wear them to, uh, work out nowadays.

26
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:17,332
Do sports.
They wick sweat from the body.

27
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,474
F-F-Football.

28
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,642
Yeah, all the guys in football wear 'em.
They're jock-chic.

29
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,515
Totally. Kurt's on the football team now.

30
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,954
He's the kicker.
That's the smallest guy on the field, right?

31
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,549
Yeah. Ye...

32
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:36,823
Brit and Tina were just helping me
with some conditioning work.

33
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:39,296
Hmm. Really?

34
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:43,267
You know, I played in J.C.
before I busted up my knee...

35
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,861
poppin' wheelies on my dirt bike.

36
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,471
Cool. I guess we'll have something
to talk about then.

37
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,536
So one of you two his girlfriend?

38
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:59,176
But I'm not ready
to be exclusive just yet.

39
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,186
Hmm.

40
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,223
All right, just keep the music down.

41
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,281
I can't hear myself think up there.

42
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,551
<i>Hey, Kurt.</i>

43
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,757
Be sure to get me a ticket
to your first game.

44
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,610
You're doing great, baby.
Just keep breathing.

45
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:34,551
<i>No, no, no.</i>

46
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,647
Giving birth is not like
how it is in the movies.

47
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,783
It is bloody and bestial...

48
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,884
and you get poop
all over your cowboy boots.

49
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,725
- Well, I'm just trying to be supportive.
- Well, this isn't about you.

50
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,197
I'm sorry, Kendra.
When was I making it about me?

51
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,430
You have to be liked, Will.

52
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:54,098
You're nice and supportive
and you avoid conflict.

53
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:58,474
Your wife is going to be pushing a watermelon
out of her boy-howdy...

54
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,706
<i>in five months.</i>

55
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,271
She doesn't need nice. She needs Dolomite.

56
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,149
- I can be tough.
- Of course you can, sweetie.

57
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,780
Okay, why don't you come on down here.

58
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:14,316
I'm gonna show you how to rub the gas bubbles
out of your wife's stomach.

59
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:18,262
- Oh, no, wait.
- Oh, no, no. You'll like it. Phil still does it to me.

60
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,799
- It feels great.
- I don't want him touching my stomach.

61
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,301
- I mean, maybe he would bruise the baby.
- Oh.

62
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:28,306
<i>Yeah. Honey, would you make me a B.L. T?</i>

63
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,003
Sure. Uh... Um,
it's gonna take a few minutes though.

64
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,104
- That's okay.
- Okay, be right back.

65
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:38,173
Make me one too. But hold the tomato.

66
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,412
<i>- Okay.
- And the lettuce.</i>

67
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,977
<i>- Okay.
- I can't do this.</i>

68
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,990
Don't worry about it.
You're gonna have an epidural.

69
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,186
I'm just making it sound worse than it is
to make him feel guilty.

70
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,753
And then you have him by the balls
for the rest of your life.

71
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:55,494
Kendra, if I told you something, would you
promise not to tell anybody, not even Phil?

72
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,004
Oh, my God. Is the baby black?

73
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,040
No.

74
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:08,346
The doctor said it's a hysterical pregnancy.

75
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,042
I can't tell Will. I can't.

76
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:14,644
He already has one foot out the door.
This baby's the only reason he's still here.

77
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,451
What do you think
he's gonna do when he finds out you lied?

78
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:21,516
Oh, God, I don't know.
I gotta tell him the truth.

79
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,562
I've gotta tell him,
and I've gotta deal with the consequences.

80
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,495
- Are you insane?
- What?

81
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:29,626
Dishonesty is food to a marriage.
It will die without it.

82
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,569
- Oh, Kendra.
- Stop being so emotional.

83
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,403
- Okay.
- The solution is clear.

84
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,237
We're gonna have to get you a baby.

85
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,497
Hey, guys.

86
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:04,002
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- No. Not at all.

87
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,837
Oh, um, so get this.

88
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,174
You know how I'm kind of like
a local news junkie, right?

89
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,214
- Isn't that kind of depressing?
- Oh, no.

90
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,545
It's kind of like a horror film, you know.

91
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,519
It's drug recalls and poison toys.
Africanized bees... that was terrible.

92
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:25,648
That's because disasters freak you out
yet fascinate you at the same time, sweetie.

93
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,216
So you like the local news
because this way you can experience them...

94
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,455
from the safety of your condo.

95
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:36,633
Anyway... Yeah, um, they just finished
this story on this zoo mauling...

96
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:40,139
and, um, you'll never guess
who came on next.

97
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,197
Well, let's see what's going on now...

98
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,800
with the local champion cheerleading coach,
Sue Sylvester...

99
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:48,244
in a brand-new segment
we call "Sue's Corner."

100
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,248
Take it away, Sue.

101
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,375
Thanks, Rod, Andrea.

102
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:57,253
You know, caning has fallen out of fashion
in the United States.

103
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:01,953
But ask anyone who's safely walked
the immaculate sidewalks of Singapore...

104
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,997
after winning an international
cheerleading competition...

105
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,396
and they'll tell you one thing:

106
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,129
caning works.

107
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,639
And I think it's about time
we did a little more of it right here.

108
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,608
And to all those naysayers out there
who say, "That's illegal.

109
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,909
You can't strike children on their bare buttocks
with razor-sharp bamboo sticks."

110
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:27,180
Well, to them I say, yes, we cane.

111
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,814
And that's how Sue sees it.

112
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,824
They gave her a segment on the local news?

113
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,291
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

114
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,852
<i>Because being a local celebrity
who's been written up twice...</i>

115
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,865
<i>on the sports page of USA Today
has its perks, William.</i>

116
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,629
Hey, pal, you wanna pull
that chair out for me?

117
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,730
My hand's still sore from signing autographs
down at the Donut Hole...

118
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,001
this morning.

119
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,600
Brought you some holes I couldn't finish.

120
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,771
And, uh, F.Y. I...
the overnights were through the roof.

121
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,975
You don't know what that means, do you?

122
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,245
Overnights.
Well, that's lingo for overnight ratings...

123
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,947
which shows us leading
among 18 to 49-year-olds...

124
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:06,514
making WOHN western Ohio's
number one local newscast.

125
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,026
- Wow.
- "Wow" is the word, Alma.

126
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,962
<i>You know, I wasn't always in the spotlight.</i>

127
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,398
<i>But I didn't wanna end up
stuck at a lousy high school...</i>

128
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,902
wrestling with mental illness.

129
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,995
Or 40 and single...

130
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:24,532
<i>coaching the worst football team
in the history of our state.</i>

131
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,374
Or having to go to the salon every week
to have my hair permed.

132
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,314
<i>I didn't wanna have to do that to myself.</i>

133
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,409
<i>So I sent out my résumé,
and I am so happy to tell you...</i>

134
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,512
that I am busting out of my box.

135
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,150
I'd love to stay and chat,
but I got a satellite interview.

136
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,354
<i>That's lingo, again, for an interview...</i>

137
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,920
via satellite.

138
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,105
- E-Excuse me. This-This isn't the right key.
- It's actually the right key.

139
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,048
- This is the alto part.
- Yep. Tina's doing the solo.

140
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:09,076
<i>I'm-I'm sorry.
There must be some sort of mix-up.</i>

141
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,680
<i>I thought I made it very clear that anything
from West Side Story goes to me.</i>

142
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,725
Maria is my part.

143
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,421
Natalie Wood was a Jew, you know.

144
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,624
I've had a very deep, personal connection
to this role since the age of one.

145
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,190
Well, I'm trying to shake things up a bit,
get us out of our boxes.

146
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,930
- You're trying to punish me.
- I think you're being irrational.

147
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,199
I think you're being unfair.

148
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,503
I think you're being unfair to Tina...

149
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,566
who might have been happy
about getting her first solo.

150
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,272
Tina knows how much I respect her,
and I think she would agree with me...

151
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,645
<i>that she's not ready
for such an iconic role as Maria.</i>

152
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,480
<i>Wait. I'm a Jet?</i>

153
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,261
The more times she storms out of rehearsal,
the less impact it has.

154
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,059
Congratulations, Tina.

155
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,568
This is going well.

156
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,103
<i>Finn? I needed to ask you something.</i>

157
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,166
Thanks, but I already have a date to the prom.
But I'm flattered.

158
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,508
I know how important dances are to teen gays.

159
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,174
- I'm not gay.
- Oh.

160
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,444
I just... I needed a favor.

161
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,923
This is not that difficult, gentlemen. Let's go.

162
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,889
Come on! Let's go!

163
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,667
Just relax, okay?

164
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,004
Remember what I told you.
Keep your eye on the ball. Don't try to aim it.

165
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,442
- Okay, put your helmet on.
- It'll mess up my hair.

166
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,537
Put your... Put your helmet on, okay?

167
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,515
- Oh! God, it's...
- Good. Red's your color.

168
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,678
Thank you for helping me with this, Finn.
You're really cool.

169
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,018
Well, I figure the more crossover
between Glee and football...

170
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,388
the easier my life's gonna be.

171
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,620
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going?

172
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,993
- To get my music ready.
- What, are you nuts? You can't use that.

173
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,830
- But we did when we were rehearsing.
- Practicing. No one was around.

174
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,961
You know how much interference I had to run
with these guys just to get you this tryout?

175
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,631
If you do it your way,
they're gonna kill you.

176
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:11,302
My body is like a rum chocolate soufflé.

177
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,504
If I don't warm it up right, it doesn't rise.

178
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,548
I'm doing this. I'm doing it my way.

179
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,479
So are you two an item now, or...

180
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:25,012
- He doesn't belong here.
- You joined Acafellas. What's the difference?

181
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,993
I'm a stud, dude. I can wear a dress to school,
and people think it's cool.

182
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,689
<i>Everybody take a knee.</i>

183
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,062
Six games.

184
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,693
Our kicker, Mr. Langanthal...

185
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,567
is zero for 12 in field goal attempts.

186
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,164
<i>As most of you
statistically-minded people know...</i>

187
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,334
that sucks!

188
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,910
So Mr. Langanthal...

189
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,507
will thusly now be in charge
of hydration services.

190
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:57,113
The next player that can get a football
between those uprights will get his job.

191
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,750
Hi. I'm Kurt Hummel,
and I'll be auditioning for the role of kicker.

192
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,108
¶¶  I'm up on him
He up on me ¶¶

202
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,477
- That was good, right?
- Yeah.

203
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,812
- It's good.
- Yeah.

204
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,046
Can you do that with the game on the line...

205
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,111
and 10 gorillas bearing down on you...

206
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,749
- who want nothing more than
to taste your sweet virgin blood?
- Sounds like fun.

207
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,123
Can I have my music?

208
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,321
If you kick like that,
you can wear a tutu for all I care.

209
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,492
Gentlemen, we have found ourselves a kicker!

210
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,195

213
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:27,279
More mail for you, Sue. But I think there
might be some hate mail mixed in...

214
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,371
from your editorial on littering.

215
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,679
Well, Mr. McClung, your station
didn't hire me because I was yella.

216
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:37,189
And not everyone's gonna have the walnuts
to take a pro-littering stance...

217
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,659
but I will not rest until every inch
of our fair state is covered in garbage.

218
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,025
That's why I pay taxes.

219
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,496
It keeps garbage men earning a living...

220
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,830
so they can afford tacos for their family.

221
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,598
Fantastic.

222
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,639
But I'm...

223
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,301
concerned...

224
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,368
<i>about your future at WOHN.</i>

225
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,471
You see, my daughter goes to your school...

226
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:07,986
and she says that a lot of the top cheerleaders
are defecting to the show choir.

227
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,317
You know, it makes me wonder if you're...

228
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,085
if you're losing all that talent
how you can expect to win nationals.

229
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,255
See, your segment's all about being
a champion, Sue, a winner.

230
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,423
So... we need you to win nationals.

231
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,297
Okay. Uh, thanks a bunch.

232
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,498
Great work.

233
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,746
Quinn.

234
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,750
Quinn.

235
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,116
Hey, what's with the silent treatment?

236
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,882
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

237
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,689
I'm pregnant.

238
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:54,461
I wasn't sure,
and I really didn't wanna go by myself.

239
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:58,469
- I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you sooner.
- Mine?

240
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:02,564
Yes, you. Who else's would it be?

241
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,241
- But we... we never...
- Last month. Hot tub?

242
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,889
Oh, no.

243
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,357
Oh, no. Oh.

244
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,418
Think of the mail.
Think of the mail. Think of the...

245
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,987
- Oh, you killed him! What are you gonna do?
- Oh.

246
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,796
- But we were wearing our swimsuits.
- Ask Jeeves said a hot tub...

247
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,928
is the perfect temperature for sperm.

248
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,995
It helps it swim faster.

249
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:37,474
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

250
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,502
- Are... Are you gonna get a...
- No.

251
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,311
I really thought I had a shot
of getting out of here.

252
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:04,562
<i>I've been collecting since 1961.</i>

253
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,970
Now, isn't this just lovely and normal?

254
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,530
They're my everything.

255
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,975
Teatime!

256
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,948
Right.

257
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,781
So, to what do I owe the honor
of your presence?

258
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,220
Oh, I just thought I'd stop by
and say hello, buddy.

259
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,384
Boy, the only thing missing from this place
is a couple dozen bodies...

260
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,257
limed and rotting in shallow graves
under the floorboards.

261
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,355
Please, have a seat on the casting couch.

262
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:41,838
It is so wonderful
to finally have some Sandy time.

263
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,808
I have my bridge game on Fridays.

264
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,244
Saturdays, I am fully committed
at the local cat rescue.

265
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,078
Sandy. Let's cut the crap.

266
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,819
I'm living in a cocoon of horror.

267
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:02,156
Yesterday I ate nine cans
of aerosol whipped cream.

268
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,158
- No...
- You...

269
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:10,065
Sandy, Sandy. We have similar problems.

270
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,662
You need to be back in the spotlight.

271
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:17,573
I wanna offer you the school's
arts administrator position.

272
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,909
You will have control
of all the arts programs...

273
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,541
music, art, drama.

274
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:29,019
Wait for it. Glee Club.

275
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,682
That's impossible.
Figgins will never allow it.

276
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,021
Oh, don't you worry about Figgins.

277
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,028
I'm never letting Sandy Ryerson
back in this school.

278
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:41,965
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

279
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:05,245
Well, I would hate to think of this video
circulating around the school.

280
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,315
Better yet, YouTube.

281
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:12,953
- Our first order of business is Glee Club.
- Oh!

282
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,091
I couldn't agree with you more.

283
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,101
William is running it into the ground.

284
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,160
And there's one linchpin
holding that group together.

285
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,229
Rachel Berry. How do we steal her away?

286
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:25,106
Hold on to your Easter bonnet, Sandy.
I'm gonna fire four words at you.

00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,657
- Wow.
- What's next?

300
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:23,224
<i>Congratulations, Miss Sally Bowles.
You have just landed the lead.</i>

301
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,231
- This is a joke.
- William.

302
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,210
<i>Sandy has never been
formally charged with anything.</i>

303
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:37,510
And the fact is, upon further reflection,
my firing of him was rash.

304
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,574
<i>This is a wonderful thing, Will.</i>

305
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,414
How many times have you sat in the chair...

306
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,422
<i>complaining how I don't care
about the arts program?</i>

307
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,516
This was you.
You have always been out to get me.

308
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:51,552
Well, if I was out to get you, I'd have you
pickling in a mason jar on my shelf by now.

309
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,860
William, take a chill pill.
I'm here to help you.

310
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,368
Oh, really?
Is that why you stole my best singer?

311
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,665
An opportunity arose for me
to showcase my talents, and I took it.

312
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:06,507
How is that any different from when you
quit Glee to form your boy band?

313
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,512
Because I didn't do it out of spite.

314
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,346
I'm offended by that accusation.
I've always been a team player.

315
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:16,217
- Just admit it, Mr. Schue.
You don't like me very much.
- That's not true.

316
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:21,851
I am your biggest,
and sometimes your only fan.

317
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,553
Look, I know who I am, okay?

318
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,862
I know I can be a little abrasive,
bossy and conceited.

319
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:32,893
I'm just hurt that you chose to judge me
on that rather than on my talent.

320
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:36,270
I know it sounds awful,
but I'm the best one in there.

321
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,809
I try the hardest, and I want it the most.

322
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,937
Everyone knows that,
and they're scared of it.

323
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,778
They all think that they can slack off
because you'll pick up their weight.

324
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,943
We can't win regionals like that.

325
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,579
We need everyone to think
that they're a star.

326
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,249
We're giving everyone a chance
to think they're a star.

327
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,816
<i>We're providing opportunities.
We're opening doors.</i>

328
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:59,352
Find your voice.
Stomp that yard. All that crap.

329
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,922
<i>- What does she have on you?
- Enough.</i>

330
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,937
I tried to play nice with you, William.

331
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:11,942
But clearly, you prefer to be adversaries.
So be it.

332
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,238
<i>I'm not quitting Glee.</i>

333
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,475
I'm just looking for a reason to stay.

334
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,449
Oh, like me taking the solo away from Tina?

335
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,851
Everyone on the team
is getting something out of being there.

336
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:26,015
You're doing a great job
of getting them out of their shells.

337
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:29,993
Except for me. I'm still getting
my lipstick flushed in the toilet.

338
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,428
I still don't have a boyfriend.

339
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,863
Tina's great, but...

340
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,527
why do you have to hurt me
to make her feel good?

341
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,503
Just come to rehearsal.

342
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,922
¶¶  Tonight, tonight ¶¶ 

343
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,795
¶¶  It all began tonight ¶¶ 

344
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:15,136
<i>¶¶  I saw you and the world went away ¶¶ </i>

345
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,643
¶¶  Tonight, tonight ¶¶ 

346
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,077
¶¶  There's only you tonight ¶¶ 

347
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:28,575
<i>¶¶  What you are, what you do
What you say ¶¶ </i>

348
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:34,149
¶¶  Today, all day I had the feeling ¶¶ 

349
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,525
¶¶  A miracle would happen ¶¶ 

350
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:42,624
¶¶  I know now I was right ¶¶ 

351
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,363
¶¶  For here you are ¶¶ 

352
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:52,240
¶¶  And what was just a world is a star ¶¶ 

353
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,304
¶¶  Tonight ¶¶ ¶¶ 

354
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,573
That was great, Tina. Good job.

355
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,017
You don't have to say that. I was sh-sharp.

356
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:06,554
- I c-can't do this.
- Hey, look at me.

357
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,093
Have you noticed the more confident you are,
the less you stutter?

358
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,629
Hey. I need you to be great at regionals.

359
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,134
To do that,
you've got to know that you can do this.

360
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,430
You have to give this song to Rachel.

361
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,600
She's better than me.

362
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,770
And you know she'll quit if you don't.

363
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,837
I'll just take one for the team.

364
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,219
Hey, Finn, what's up?

365
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,383
<i>Hey.</i>

366
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,122
It's okay.

367
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,823
It's okay.

368
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,065
Thanks a lot for this, Mr. Schue.

369
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,607
- I couldn't talk to my mom, you know.
- Yeah.

370
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,303
So how far along is she?

371
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,677
I don't know. A couple of weeks maybe.

372
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,478
It's pretty recent, I guess.

373
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,644
Well, what do you...
what do you need me to do? You want me to...

374
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,881
You want me to set you up
with Planned Parenthood?

375
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:14,653
No. No. It's not even a conversation.
She's keeping it.

376
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:20,263
I've seen the guys around town
who had kids in high school.

377
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:25,827
They work here or at the supermarket
or pumping gas or worse.

378
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,840
They're caged. Got no future.

379
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,808
I can't become one of those dudes.

380
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,471
Mr. Schue, I got to go to college.

381
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:37,743
But we don't have any money, and...

382
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,478
I need a football scholarship.

383
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,020
But the only way I'm gonna get one
is if we start winning.

384
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,682
I'm not a football coach.

385
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,787
Remember when we were working
on that Acafella stuff...

386
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,852
and you helped me and Puck with the dancing?

387
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,592
- Yeah.
- You loosened us up.

388
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,725
That's the football team's problem.

389
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,963
I figured it out
watching Kurt kick those field goals.

390
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,471
Here. Check this out.

391
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,202
I got this at the school library.

392
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,370
Did you know you can just
borrow books from there?

393
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,574
All of 'em.
Except for the encyclopedias, but...

394
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:14,949
It says in here that Walter Payton
was a great dancer.

395
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,854
<i>In college, he won
dance competitions on Soul Train.</i>

396
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,949
And he took ballet lessons.

397
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,256
And he even got the whole Bears team
to take them...

398
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,421
the year they won the Super Bowl.

399
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,330
- That's how they came up
with the Super Bowl Shuffle.
- Let me just get this straight.

400
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,665
You want me to teach
the football team how to dance?

401
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,537
Uh, I don't think Ken will go for that.

402
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,167
We'll talk him into it.

403
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,939
Look, you said you needed guys
for Glee Club, right?

404
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:45,506
If you can help us win one game,
they'll start to trust you.

405
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:48,678
Then I'm sure some of them will wanna join.

406
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,849
It's a win-win for both of us.

407
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,627
Eat up.

408
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:06,467
- How far along is she?
- A few weeks.

409
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,699
It breaks my heart.

410
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,764
They're both so scared to death, Ter.

411
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,402
They're just kids. They can't raise a baby.

412
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,537
Here this poor girl is so ashamed...

413
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,674
she feels like she can't tell anybody.

414
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,980
I mean, can you imagine?

415
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,215
Having to hide something like that.

416
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:29,591
All that effort covering that up.

417
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,720
What did you say her name was? Quinn?

418
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,264
- Quinn Fabray.
- Oh.

419
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:37,824
Oh, and here's the kicker.
She's president of the Celibacy Club.

420
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,808
This is garbage. What the hell does Beyoncé
have to do with football?

421
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,341
Why don't you ask Kurt? He seems to be
the only one who can score on this team.

422
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,150
<i>- Even in practice.
- So we're taking coaching advice
from Lance Bass now?</i>

423
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,817
Guys. Guys.

424
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,292
Athletes are performers
just like singers and dancers.

425
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:07,161
<i>And think about it. Jim Brown. Dick Butkus.</i>

426
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,167
- O.J.
- O.J. Right.

427
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:15,036
All pretty tough guys.
All of them had big careers as performers.

428
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,075
Now, I don't think you guys are losing
because you don't have the talent.

429
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,134
You're losing
because you don't have the right attitude.

430
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,510
Oh, I get it. We have to think
more like Amazonian black women.

431
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:28,349
Think about it. If you can sing and dance
in front of people, everything else is easy.

432
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,650
Coach. Please. Step in here.

433
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,919
I'm down with it.
I mean, heck, what do we got to lose?

434
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:37,393
We gave up our pride
when we lost to that school for the deaf.

435
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:39,396
<i>That's true.</i>

436
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,865
<i>Sun Tzu says in his Art of War
to never let the enemy know you.</i>

437
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,835
Our greatest weapon
could be the element of surprise.

438
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,395
Don't tell me that you
wouldn't be on your heels...

439
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,237
if the other team
started busting a move on the field.

440
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,745
Okay, too much talking, not enough stretching.

441
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:59,375
<i>In the choir room in full pads in five.
That's five minutes. Let's go.</i>

442
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,385
A-five, six, seven, eight.

443
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,048
Step, ball change, up.
¶¶  Da, da, da, da ¶¶ 

444
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,751
¶¶  Ba, ba, ba
A-ba, ba, bam ¶¶ ¶¶ 

445
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:12,320
That's good, guys.
Your hips are still a little tight, okay?

446
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,388
It's just like you're playing football.

447
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,957
It's all about the lateral movement.
Just stay low and...

448
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,503
- May I?
- Watch Kurt.

449
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:25,404
All right, boys. Five, six, seven.

450
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,536
Hand, hand.

451
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:30,274
Point to the finger. Hip, head.

452
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,612
Oh! Sneak attack. Back to the ring.

453
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:35,209
Comb through the hair. Slap the butt.

454
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,914
<i>Okay, that's enough for today, gentlemen.</i>

455
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,789
We'll... work on it. Just hit the showers.

456
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,488
Bye, Coach.

457
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,793
Um, Coach, I don't mean to interject...

458
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,391
but I think we should end with a show circle.

459
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,468
What's your problem?

460
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,440
Nothing. I just got a lot on my mind.

461
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,171
Seriously, dude, what's going on?

462
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,941
I'm your best friend. Talk.

463
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,209
It's personal.

464
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,808
I knew it. You're in love with Kurt.

465
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,684
Quinn's pregnant. She's keeping the baby.

466
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,699
- What's up, MILF?
- Leave me alone.

467
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,232
Who's the daddy?

468
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,935
I just think it's kind of weird if it's Finn...

469
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,376
since you told me
you were a virgin when we did it.

470
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,573
And I know for a fact
that you didn't do it with him.

471
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,673
How can you be so sure?

472
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,843
Finn's my boy. He would've told me.

473
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,082
You make a habit of sleeping
with your boy's girlfriends?

474
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,692
Well, call the Vatican. We got ourselves
another Immaculate Conception.

475
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,390
I'd take care of it, you know.
You too.

476
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,025
My dad's a deadbeat,
but I don't roll that way.

477
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:59,468
Weren't you fired for peeing
in the fast-food fryolator?

478
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:02,973
- I've got my pool-cleaning business.
- We live in Ohio.

479
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:08,810
I had sex with you
because you got me drunk on wine coolers...

480
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,542
and I felt fat that day.

481
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,380
But it was a mistake.

482
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:17,512
You're a Lima loser,
and you're always gonna be a Lima loser.

483
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,965
<i>How many weeks are you?</i>

484
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,907
From the looks of you,
I'd say no more than five or six.

485
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,208
<i>I assume you haven't told your parents yet.
I mean, how could you?</i>

486
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,478
After Daddy bought you this car
so you could drive him to the Chastity Ball.

487
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:50,544
- You can't raise this baby, Quinn.
- I'm sorry, but who are you?

488
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,147
I'm just somebody who wants to help.

489
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:55,385
I don't need your help.
Get the hell out of my car!

490
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,055
Really? What kind of prenatal vitamins
are you taking?

491
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,101
Yeah.

492
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,864
Here. Three times a day,
or your baby will be ugly.

493
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,500
I don't understand.

494
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,704
What do you want from me?

495
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,056
W-M-H-S!

496
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,431
<i>Anyone sitting here?</i>

497
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,403
<i>- Um, no. No, here.
- W-M-H-S!</i>

498
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,473
- Well, at least I know it's clean.
- Yeah.

499
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,661
Well, I think we, uh,
really came together this week as a team.

500
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:10,223
<i>Yeah, a gay team.</i>

501
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,462
A big gay team of dancing gays.

502
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,597
<i>Seriously, Finn,
it was fun in practice and all...</i>

503
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,971
but we can't do that out here
in front of everybody.

504
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,840
<i>It'll make us even more of a joke.</i>

505
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:38,790
- Divert right, 87 on one. Break!
- Break!

506
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,832
<i>Yo, Q. B!</i>

507
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,960
Your mama's so fat, the back of her neck
looks like a pack of hot dogs!

508
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,903
- Give me some ketchup!
- Down, set, hike!

509
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:58,444
<i>- Whoo!
- Punch and Judy on one. Break!</i>

510
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,513
Come on!

511
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,989
<i>Come on!</i>

512
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:13,897
Dad! Dad!

513
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:17,128
I told you! I told you!

514
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,700
<i>Jordan versus Bird on one!
Hut!</i>

515
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:26,535
Run!

516
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:34,082
- Aw!
- Cupid tips on one. Break!

517
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,874
Time-out!

518
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:08,048
- Dude, we got to do it.
- We will be jokes
for the rest of our high school lives.

519
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,053
We're already jokes.

520
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,181
I don't wanna be a Lima loser
for the rest of my life.

521
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,925
<i>Yo, left tackle, your mama's so fat...</i>

522
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,193
<i>her cereal bowl comes with its own lifeguard,
like Baywatch!</i>

523
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:26,259
Hey, ankle grabber,
I had sex with your mother.

524
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,771
No, seriously. I cleaned your pool.

525
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,241
<i>And then I had sex with her in your bed.
Nice Star Wars sheets.</i>

526
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,540
Let's do it, captain.

527
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,642
<i>Come on. Huddle up. Huddle up.</i>

528
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:44,552
Okay, "Ring On It" on three.

529
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,622
<i>Yeah. All right?</i>

530
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:53,096
- Come on. On three. One, two, three, break!
- Break!

531
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:04,074
Hut one, two!

532
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,975
Three! Let's hit it!

533
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,683
<i>- ¶¶  All the single ladies ¶¶

Hike!

557
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,386
You're up, kid.

558
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,581
You make this, and we win.

559
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,991
You make this, and you die a legend.

560
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,286
Can I pee first?

561
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,632
He's so little.

562
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,124
Center, hike!

563
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,729
Yes!

564
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,296
Yes! Yes!

565
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,168
That is my boy!

566
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,057
Nighttime skin care is a big part
of my post game ritual.

567
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:45,687
I don't know what to say
about that, but, uh...

568
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,288
I was really proud of you tonight, Kurt.

569
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,831
I wish your mom would've been there...

570
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:54,132
I mean, alive.

571
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,530
Thanks.

572
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,078
Dad?

573
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,982
I... have something that I wanna say.

574
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,715
I'm glad that you're proud of me.

575
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,484
But I don't wanna lie anymore.

576
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:24,028
Being a part of the Glee Club and football...

577
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,797
has really showed me that I can be anything.

578
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,602
And what I am...

579
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,100
is...

580
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,447
I'm gay.

581
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,184
- I know.
- Really?

582
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:45,780
I've known since you were three.

583
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,757
All you wanted for your birthday
was a pair of sensible heels.

584
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:56,764
I guess I'm not totally in love
with the idea, but...

585
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:01,100
if that's who you are,
there's nothing I can do about it.

586
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,402
And I love you just as much.

587
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,467
Okay?

588
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,372
Thanks for telling me, Kurt.

589
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,661
You're sure, right?

590
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,789
- Yeah, Dad. I'm sure.
- Just checking.

591
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,902
Hey.

592
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:42,603
Here. It's my gee-ge.

593
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,080
This is the baby blanket
my dad got me the day I was born.

594
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,242
It was the only thing
I had to remember him by.

595
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,752
I used to cry without it.

596
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,755
I took it everywhere with me,
so it's a little dirty.

597
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:56,020
But I want our baby to have it.

598
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,857
I'm gonna do everything I can
to be a good father.

599
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,834
Thank you, Finn.

600
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,529
Hey, guys. How you doing?

601
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:12,540
- Lately I've been getting really sick in the morning.
- Must be a virus.

602
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,135
Hey, you putting on a little weight?
You should watch your carbs.

603
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,272
They're not gonna be able to hoist you
to the top of that cheerleading pyramid...

604
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,782
much longer.

605
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,614
Hey, don't talk to my girlfriend like that.

606
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,822
You know what?
You're right. I was out of line.

607
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,965
See you guys around.

608
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,139
You know, there's a question
I get asked a lot.

609
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:48,508
Whether I'm accepting an honorary doctorate
or performing a citizen's arrest...

610
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:52,310
people ask me, "Sue, what's your secret?"

611
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,647
<i>Well, I'll tell you my secret,
western Ohio.</i>

612
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,915
Hey, guys, let's give a big Glee welcome
to our three new members...

613
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,081
fresh off their big win on Friday night...

614
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:03,684
Noah Puckerman,
Matt Rutherford and Mike Chang.

615
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,820
<i>Regionals, here we come.</i>

616
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:09,593
Sue Sylvester's not afraid
to shake things up.

617
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:13,501
<i>Let's start today with "Tonight"
from West Side Story.</i>

618
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:20,869
Tina. Show us what you got.

619
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,641
<i>You know, I'm tired
of hearing people complain...</i>

620
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:27,878
<i>"I'm riddled with this disease"
or "I was in that tsunami."</i>

621
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:31,319
To them I say, shake it up a bit.
Get out of your box.

622
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:34,687
<i>Even if that box happens
to be where you're living.</i>

623
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:38,819
I thought you had Glee practice,
my little multitasking star.

624
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,626
I quit. I'm yours exclusively.

625
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,133
I'll often yell at homeless people...

626
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,965
"Hey, how's that homelessness
working out for you?

627
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,631
<i>Give not being homeless a try, huh?"</i>

628
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,938
<i>- Maybe this time in B-flat.
- You know something, Ohio?</i>

629
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,036
It's not easy to break out
of your comfort zone.

630
00:41:56,113 --> 00:42:00,049
People will tear you down, tell you you
shouldn't have bothered in the first place.

631
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,415
<i>But let me tell you something.</i>

632
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:07,014
<i>There's not much of a difference
between a stadium full of cheering fans...</i>

633
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:10,492
and an angry crowd screaming abuse at you.

634
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,859
They're both just making a lot of noise.

635
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,398
How you take it is up to you.

636
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,798
<i>Convince yourself they're cheering for you.</i>

637
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,634
<i>You do that, and someday, they will.</i>

638
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,334
And that's how Sue sees it.
