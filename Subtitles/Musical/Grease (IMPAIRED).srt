1
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:27,943
 Love...

2
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:32,529
... Is a many splendoured thing

3
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:13,222
I'm going to Australia,
I won't see you again.

4
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:15,349
Don't talk that way, Sandy.

5
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:17,142
But it's true.

6
00:01:17,242 --> 00:01:23,447
I've had the best summer of my life.
Now I have to go away. It isn't fair.

7
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:36,161
Danny, don't spoil it.
- Sandy, it's only making it better.

8
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:38,468
Danny, is this the end?

9
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:40,597
Of course not.

10
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:43,711
It's only the beginning.

11
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:45,963
This is the main brain,
Vince Fontaine,

12
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:48,674
beginning your day the only way.
Music, music.

13
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:50,301
Get out of bed, first day of school.

14
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,679
Don't be a slob, don't get a job,
go back to class, you can pass.

15
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:58,309
To start the day off nice and fine,
here's a new old favourite of mine.

16
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,395
 I solve my problems and I see the light...

17
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:03,689
... We got a lovin' thing...

18
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:06,424
... We got to feed it right...

19
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:10,571
... There ain't no danger
we can go too far...

20
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:12,740
... We start believin' now...

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,950
... That we can be who we are...

22
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,260
... Grease is the word...

23
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:23,918
... They think our love
is just a growin'pain...

24
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,128
... Why don't they understand?

25
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:28,897
 It's just a cryin' shame...

26
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:32,676
... Their lips are lying,
only real is real...

27
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:35,095
... We stop the fight right now...

28
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:37,181
... We got to be what we feel...

29
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:38,933
... Grease is the word...

30
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,685
... Is the word,
is the word that you've heard...

31
00:02:41,785 --> 00:02:45,270
... It's got groove, it's got meaning...

32
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:51,362
... Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion...

33
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:55,162
... Grease is the way we are feelin'

34
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,539
 We take the pressure
and we throw away...

35
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,639
... Conventionality...

36
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:06,465
... Belongs to yesterday...

37
00:03:07,227 --> 00:03:10,339
... There is a chance
that we can make it so far...

38
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,716
... We start believin' now...

39
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:15,010
... That we can be who we are...

40
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,470
... Grease is the word...

41
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,390
... Is the word,
is the word that you've heard...

42
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,975
... It's got groove, it's got meaning...

43
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:28,691
... Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion...

44
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:32,919
... Now grease is the way we are feelin'

45
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:36,639
 This is a life of illusion...

46
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:39,118
... Wrapped up in troubles...

47
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,703
... Laced in confusion...

48
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,172
... What are we doing here?

49
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:48,168
 We take the pressure
and we throw away...

50
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:50,345
... Conventionality...

51
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,935
... Belongs to yesterday...

52
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:57,136
... There is a chance
that we can make it so far...

53
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:59,221
... We start believin' now...

54
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:01,640
... That we can be who we are...

55
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,058
... Grease is the word...

56
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:06,103
... Is the word,
is the word that you've heard...

57
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:09,688
... It's got groove, it's got meaning...

58
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:15,923
... Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion...

59
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,420
... Grease is the way we are feelin'

60
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,427
 Grease is the word,
is the word that you've heard...

61
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,012
... It's got groove, it's got meaning...

62
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:47,603
... Grease is the time,
is the place, is the motion...

63
00:04:47,703 --> 00:04:51,321
... Grease is the way we are feelin'

64
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:58,581
 Grease is the word,
is the word, is the word...

65
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:13,754
You don't eat this, you bury it.
- That's a home-made lunch.

66
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:16,382
Your old lady drag her carcass
out of bed for you?

67
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:20,137
She does it first day of school.
- Big deal.

68
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:24,920
Kenickie. Over here.
- Where you at?

69
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:27,351
We're right here.

70
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:30,145
Where were you all summer?
- Are you my mother?

71
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:33,691
Just askin'.
- Working. More than you can say.

72
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,236
Working?
- Yes, lugging boxes at Bargain City.

73
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,708
Nice job.
- Eat me.

74
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:41,824
I'm saving up to get me some wheels.

75
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,701
Wanna hear what I did?
- No.

76
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,007
Hey, there's Danny.

77
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,885
Danny. Danny.

78
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:04,847
You seen any new broads there?

79
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,602
Nah, same old chicks,
everybody's made them.

80
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:10,728
So what'd you do all summer?

81
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,522
I was hanging around at the beach.
You know.

82
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:16,567
It's tough with all those chicks
hanging around you.

83
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:20,738
The only thing
that hangs around you are the flies.

84
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,983
How was the action at the beach, man?

85
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:26,500
Whew. It was flipping.

86
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:28,412
Yeah? Crazy?

87
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:32,889
I did meet this one chick.
She was sorta cool.

88
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,175
You mean she puts out?

89
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,505
Come on, Sonny,
is that all you think about?

90
00:06:38,605 --> 00:06:41,310
Freakin' A.
- (Bell)

91
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,595
Hey, guys, wait up.

92
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,514
Do I look OK, Frenchy?
- Sure, you look good.

93
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:50,948
I'm really nervous.
- You look terrific.

94
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:54,991
So, this is Rydell?
- Yep. You'll love it.

95
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:58,984
I loved the last school I was at.
I wish I was there right now.

96
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:01,612
Still, I'm no stranger to heartbreak.

97
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,037
Why? You got psoriasis?

98
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,343
(Car backfires)

99
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:24,189
Well, here we are again.

100
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:28,264
But this time we're seniors.
- We're gonna rule the school.

101
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,364
(All laugh)

102
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,226
Jan, that is so adolescent.

103
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,896
We are adolescent.
- We don't have to flaunt it.

104
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:37,565
OK, girls.

105
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,665
Let's go get 'em.

106
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,658
Blanche, do you have the new schedules?

107
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,494
Yes, Miss McGee,
I just had my hands on them.

108
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:53,497
Oh, good, they'll be nice and smudged.

109
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:58,527
Here we are. If it had been a snake,
it would've bitten me.

110
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:02,089
These are the schedules
we couldn't find last semester.

111
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:05,674
Next year,
you might find this semester's.

112
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:16,562
I've got Kenickie again.
- He's been here longer than I have.

113
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:21,422
First day of school and already
my castor oil is missing.

114
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,486
How many days till Christmas vacation?

115
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:25,738
86.

116
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,838
86?
- And counting.

117
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:32,036
Can I help you?
- Yes, it's my first day.

118
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,748
I'm not sure where I should be.
- Welcome to Rydell.

119
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,667
You'll have to fill out these forms, but...

120
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:41,997
Excuse me a minute.
I'll be right back.

121
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:48,032
Do you have a pencil, please?
- Yes, dear. There you are.

122
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:50,485
(Bell)

123
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,898
Jeez. Every teacher I got this year
has flunked me at least once.

124
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,484
You'll spend your time in McGee's office.

125
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:07,780
She'll wish she'd never seen me.
- Yeah? And what are you gonna do?

126
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,825
I just ain't gonna take her crap.
I don't take no crap from nobody.

127
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:14,214
Sonny?
- Oh, hello, ma'am.

128
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,456
Shouldn't you be in home room?
- I was going for a walk.

129
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:19,750
You were dawdling.
- Yes, ma'am.

130
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,420
That is no way to start
a new semester, Mr LaTierri.

131
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,964
(Mutters in Italian)

132
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:29,635
Perhaps a session of banging erasers
after school would put you on track.

133
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,220
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,182
Do you plan to stand there all day?
- No, ma'am. I mean, yes.

135
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:37,226
Well, which is it?
- No, ma'am.

136
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,791
Good. Then move.
- Yes, ma'am.

137
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,025
I'm glad you didn't take
any of her crap, Sonny.

138
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,986
You would have told her off, huh?

139
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,170
Mr LaTierri.
Yes, ma'am, no, ma'am...

140
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:51,323
Hey, Eugene.

141
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:53,423
How you doin'?

142
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,792
Shake, buddy.
- (Buzzing)

143
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,039
What's wrong?
You're wearing glasses.

144
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:01,774
I got an astigmatism.
- Too bad.

145
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:08,966
(Students)  As I go travelling down
life's highway...

146
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:13,692
... Whatever course my fortunes
may foretell...

147
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:17,271
...(chimes)

148
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:22,146
Good morning, boys and girls.
Welcome to what we're sure will be...

149
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,398
...our greatest year at Rydell.

150
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,943
Saturday night will be
our first pep rally and bonfire.

151
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,654
I want to see all of you students out there,

152
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:35,534
with plenty of support for Coach
Calhoun and the Rydell Rangers.

153
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:40,054
If you can't be an athlete,
be an athletic supporter.

154
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,791
And now for the really good news.

155
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:44,919
One of the most exciting things...

156
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,824
...to ever happen at Rydell High.

157
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,674

158
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:55,262
...has selected Rydell as
a representative American high school...

159
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:59,016
...and will do a live broadcast
from our very own gym.

160
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,768
(Cheering)

161
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,729
It is our chance to show the entire nation...

162
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,549
...what fine, bright, clean-cut,

163
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,752
wholesome students
we have here at Rydell.

164
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,712
(Screams)...

165
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,330
... Ba, ba, bamba...

166
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,430
... Ba, ba, bamba...

167
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,940
... La, la, la, la, la bamba

168
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,465
Did you guys get a look
at Zuko this mornin'?

169
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,176
Lookin' pretty good this year,
huh, Rizz?

170
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:38,556
That's ancient history.
- History sometimes repeats itself.

171
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,111
Hey, you guys.
- Hi, Frenchy.

172
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:45,286
Go sit down.
This here is Sandy Olsen.

173
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:48,399
And that's Jan and Marty,
and this is Rizzo.

174
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,694
She just moved here
from Sydney, Australia.

175
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,619
How are things down under?
- Oh, fine, thanks.

176
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,410
Marty, are those new glasses?

177
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,538
Yeah, just for school.
Do they make me look smarter?

178
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,832
Nah, you can still see your face.

179
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,460
How d'you like school, Sandy?
- It's different.

180
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,051
Hi, kids.
- (All groan)

181
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,966
Patty Simcox,
the bad seed of Rydell. Hi.

182
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,469
I love the first day of school.
- The biggest thrill of my life.

183
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:20,306
You won't guess what's happened.
- Probably not.

184
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,600
The nominees for Student Council are out.

185
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,019
Guess who's up for Vice President?
- Who?

186
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,896
Me. Isn't that the most?

187
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,023
To say the least.
- The very least.

188
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,108
I hope I don't make a poor showing.

189
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,111
We wish you the best of luck,
don't we, girls?

190
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,591
I've got my fingers crossed.

191
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,993
Oh, you must think I'm a clod
for not introducing myself.

192
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,465
Hi, I'm Patty Simcox.

193
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,017
Welcome to Rydell. (Squeals)

194
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:54,590
Will you be at cheerleader tryouts?
We'll be lifelong friends.

195
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,259
You guys, how do you like Sandy?

196
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:01,138
Do you think we can
let her in the Pink Ladies?

197
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,642
She looks too pure to be pink.
- Ohh, double do-do.

198
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,893
What's up, doc?

199
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,733
One of my diamonds
just fell in the macaroni.

200
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,691
Kenickie, want a piece of salami?

201
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,444
Are you kidding?
If I eat that, I'll smell like you.

202
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,196
What a stink.

203
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,296
Hey, guys, look.

204
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,583
Ladies and gentlemen,
dingleberries on parade.

205
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,708
Look. You really put
your foot into it this time.

206
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,382
Try hopscotch, you hot dog.

207
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,354
What a gavone. Gumdrops, man.

208
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:43,055
Any of you guys see
that new chick in registration?

209
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,266
Sure beats the foam domes round here.

210
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,017
Jugs bigger than Annette's?

211
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:50,517
Nobody's jugs are bigger than Annette's.

212
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,373
Hey, guys. Hey.

213
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,673
Hi, girls.

214
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,798
You're a sick man, Putz.

215
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,625
Hey, I wanna hear about
what Danny did at the beach.

216
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:15,254
It was nothing.
- Sure, nothing, Zuko. Right?

217
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,465
You got in her drawers, right?
- Come on, tell us.

218
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:20,050
What did you do this summer?

219
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,470
I spent most of it at the beach.
I met a boy there.

220
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,307
You hauled your cookies
to the beach for a guy?

221
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,572
He was sorta special.
- There ain't no such thing.

222
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,605
It was really romantic.

223
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,030
Everything about it.

224
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,110
You don't want to hear the horny details.

225
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,210
Alright, I'll tell you.

226
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:43,996
 Summer lovin', had me a blast...

227
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,917
... Summer lovin', happened so fast...

228
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,422
... I met a girl, crazy for me...

229
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,844
... Met a boy, cute as can be...

230
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,013
... Summer days, drifting away...

231
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,425
... To uh, oh, those summer nights...

232
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,594
... Wella, wella, wella, huh...

233
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:07,306
... Tell me more, tell me more
Did you get very far?

234
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,101
 Tell me more, tell me more
-  Like does he have a car?

235
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,813
 Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
-  Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do...

236
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:18,828
... She swam by me, she got a cramp...

237
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,375
... He ran by me, got my suit damp...

238
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:26,576
... I saved her life,
she nearly drowned...

239
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,009
... He showed off, splashing around...

240
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,541
... Summer sun, something's begun...

241
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,252
... But uh, oh, those summer nights...

242
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,045
... Wella, wella, wella, huh...

243
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:42,174
... Tell me more, tell me more
-  Was it love at first sight?

244
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,053
 Tell me more, tell me more
-  Did she put up a fight?

245
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:49,848
 Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
 Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie-dum...

246
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:54,228
... Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
 Doobie-doo, doobie-doo, doobie-dum...

247
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,661
... Took her bowling in the arcade...

248
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,622
... We went strolling, drank lemonade...

249
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,121
... We made out, under the dock...

250
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,671
... We stayed out till ten o'clock...

251
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,967
... Summer fling, don't mean a thing...

252
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,596
... But uh, oh, those summer nights...

253
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:21,005
... Tell me more, tell me more
-  But you don't gotta brag...

254
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,007
... Tell me more, tell me more...

255
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,509
... Cos he sounds like a drag...

256
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:29,555
... Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop
Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop...

257
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,851
... Shuda-bop-bop, shuda-bop-bop
Shuda-bop-bop, yeah.

258
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,284
 He got friendly, holding my hand...

259
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,541
... She got friendly, down in sand...

260
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,202
... He was sweet, just turned 18...

261
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:49,332
... Well, she was good,
you know what I mean...

262
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,286
... Summer heat, boy and girl meet...

263
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,331
... But uh, oh, those summer nights...

264
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,124
... Whoa, whoa, whoa...

265
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,920
... Tell me more, tell me more
-  How much dough did he spend?

266
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,950
 Tell me more, tell me more
-  Could she get me a friend?

267
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:12,481
 It turned colder,
that's where it ends...

268
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:17,694
... So I told her we'd still be friends...

269
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,744
... Then we made our true love vow...

270
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:31,046
... Wonder what she's doing now...

271
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,045
... Summer dreams...

272
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,427
... Ripped at the seams...

273
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,552
... But...

274
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,687
... Oh...

275
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,647
... Those summer...

276
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,236
... Nights...

277
00:17:55,949 --> 00:18:01,074
... Tell me more, tell me more

278
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,463
He sounds real nice.

279
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,994
True love and he didn't lay
a hand on you? Sounds like a creep.

280
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,496
He wasn't. He was a gentleman.

281
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,248
What was his name?

282
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,208
Danny. Danny Zuko.

283
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,793
(All giggle)

284
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,953
Well, I think he sounds peachy keen.

285
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,258
Maybe, if you believe in miracles,

286
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,094
Prince Charming will show up again
someday.

287
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,054
Somewhere unexpected.

288
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,824
See you later. Come on, girls.

289
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,599
Do you really think so, Frenchy?
- Sure.

290
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,821
Erm... Sandy, I think
we oughta get to class.

291
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,382
(All) Do the splits, give a yell

292
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,426
Show a little spirit for old Rydell

293
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,684
Way to go, red and white

294
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,455
Go Rydell, fight, fight, fight.

295
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,575
(Fanfare)

296
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,372
And now...

297
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,122
Quiet, please.

298
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:37,159
Quiet, everyone. Now, boys and girls,
the man of the hour.

299
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,119
The coach we're all depending on...

300
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,790
...to pull Rydell out of
a seven-season slump,

301
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,677
our very own Coach Calhoun.

302
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,809
(Cheering)...

303
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,072
Who's the best?
- (All) Rydell.

304
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,775
Give 'em hell, Rydell.

305
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,608
I just wanna tell you students
that we have a banner year coming up.

306
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,861
Because my boys are primed,
really primed,

307
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,832
because I primed 'em.

308
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:20,744
Not only primed, they're honed.
Honed to a sharp razor-edge.

309
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,122
We're not just going out there to win.

310
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:27,293
We're going out there for glory.
And when we get out there,

311
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,962
we're gonna yank 'em and tear 'em...

312
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,881
...and rip 'em.

313
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:36,677
We'll take 'em and roll 'em around
and rip 'em up to pieces.

314
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,412
Then we're gonna slaughter 'em.

315
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,099
And after the slaughter is over,

316
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:46,704
we're gonna come back here
and ring that victory bell.

317
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,206
Like we always wanted to.

318
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,007
Watch this.

319
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,167
Nyik-nyak, nyik-nyak Brrr, nyik-nyak

320
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:22,443
Do a split, give a yell
Shake a tit for old Rydell.

321
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,936
Guys.

322
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,036
Be cool, huh?

323
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,580
Hey, watch out, pinhead.

324
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,045
Well, what do you think?

325
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,174
What a hunk of junk.

326
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,955
Wait till I give it a paint job,
soup up the engine.

327
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,333
She'll run like a champ.
I'm racing her at Thunder Road.

328
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,378
Thunder Road?
- Yeah. Wanna make something of it?

329
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,923
I wanna see you
make something of this heap.

330
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,092
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

331
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:02,442
What are Scorpions doing here?
It ain't their turf.

332
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:09,078
Think they wanna rumble?
- If they do, we'll be ready.

333
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,830
Alright, gang. Let's go get 'em.

334
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,498
Hey, chicken.
- Whoo-hoo.

335
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,598
What you doing?

336
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,129
Thanks, Frenchy.
- That's alright.

337
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:39,383
You were great out there.
- I messed up, I was so nervous.

338
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,219
Your split was divoon.
- Hi, Sandy.

339
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,264
Hi, Rizz. Hi, girls.
- We got a surprise for you.

340
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,765
What is it?
- You'll see.

341
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,017
Right, Rizz?

342
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,727
Let me comb your hair down.

343
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,827
Where are we going?

344
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,912
Want a little lipstick?

345
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,068
If you fix up this car,
it could be make-out city.

346
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,572
A chick is gonna have to put out
before she even gets in.

347
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,073
You'd better believe it.

348
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,233
Hey, Zuko. I got a surprise for you.

349
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,301
Oh, yeah?

350
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,721
Yeah.

351
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,422
Sandy.
- Danny?

352
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,297
What are you doing here?
I thought you were back in Australia.

353
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,437
We had a change of plan.

354
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,691
I can't...

355
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:28,724
That's cool, baby. You know how it
is. Rockin' and rollin' and whatnot.

356
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,477
Danny?
- That's my name, don't wear it out.

357
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,855
What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?

358
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,250
What's the matter with you?

359
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,570
What happened to the Danny Zuko
I met at the beach?

360
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,005
Well, I do not know.
Maybe there's two of us, right?

361
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,746
Why don't you take out
a missing-persons ad or...

362
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,991
...try the Yellow Pages?
I don't know.

363
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:58,128
You're a fake and a phoney.
I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.

364
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,228
(All) Ooohhh...

365
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,254
I wonder if she carries silver bullets.

366
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,674
So she laid her eyes on you,
huh, Zuko?

367
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,643
I bet that's not all she's laid on him.

368
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:16,397
Hey, Zuke. I got a car, remember?
- Come on, Danny.

369
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:20,577
Who's got beer money?
- I swiped my brother's ID.

370
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,741
He was so nice to me this summer.

371
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,878
Listen, Sandy, men are rats.

372
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:35,929
Listen to me.
They're fleas on rats.

373
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:40,004
Worse than that,
they're amoebas on fleas on rats.

374
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:44,269
I mean, they're too low
for even the dogs to bite.

375
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:49,394
The only man a girl can depend on
is her daddy.

376
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:54,405
You know what you need?
A night out with the girls.

377
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:59,440
We're having a sleep-over
at my house tonight. Wanna come?

378
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,541
Good. You'll love it. Come on.

379
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,988
Hey, look at Jan.

380
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,033
 Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
Get the new lpana...

381
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:12,244
... With the brand-new flavour
It's dandy for your teeth...

382
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,623
... Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a,
New lpana toothpaste...

383
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:19,877
... Brush-a, brush-a, brush-a
Knocks out decay germs fast...

384
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,952
... Fast, fast, you sure are right

385
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,022
Turn it off.

386
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,427
Hand me a ciggie butt.
- Yeah, me, too.

387
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,638
Want one, Sandy?
- I don't smoke.

388
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:34,733
You don't?
- Go ahead, try it. It won't kill ya.

389
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:44,401
Oh, I forgot to say, you shouldn't
inhale unless you're used to it.

390
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:49,771
Sandy, let me teach you how to
French inhale. It's really cool.

391
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,965
God. That is
the ugliest-looking thing I ever saw.

392
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,750
The guys really go for it.
It's how I got my nickname.

393
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,850
Sure it is.

394
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:09,158
OK, how about a little Sneaky Pete
to get the party goin'?

395
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,388
Italian Swiss Colony?
Wow, it's imported.

396
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,723
I brought Twinkies.
Anybody want one?

397
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,768
Twinkies and wine?
That's real class, Jan.

398
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,980
It says right here it is a dessert wine.

399
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,715
Hey, Sandy didn't get any wine.

400
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:27,444
Oh, that's OK.
- I bet you never had a drink before.

401
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,698
I had champagne
at my cousin's wedding once.

402
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,241
Ring-a-ding-ding.

403
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,316
What's wrong? We don't got cooties.

404
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:41,292
Hey, Sandy. Would you like me
to pierce your ears for ya?

405
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:44,725
(Jeering)
- Shut up.

406
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,591
Isn't it awfully dangerous?

407
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,760
I know what I'm doing.
I'm going to be a beautician.

408
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,597
What's the matter? You afraid?
- No, I'm not.

409
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:59,476
Here, Frenchy, use my virgin pin.
- It's good for somethin'.

410
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,854
It's not a good idea.
- It's OK.

411
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,844
My father won't like it. (Screams)

412
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,110
Sandy, let's go into the bathroom.

413
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,155
My mother'll kill me
if I get blood on the carpet.

414
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,658
It only bleeds for a second.
- I don't feel very well.

415
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,785
Don't worry. If she screws up,

416
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,710
she can fix your hair
so your ears don't show.

417
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,391
Sandy, Sandy, beauty is pain.

418
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,045
(Screams)

419
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:29,131
Could you get some ice to numb her ears?

420
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:34,076
Let the cold water run
and stick her ear under the faucet.

421
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,228
Personally,
I'm getting rather chilly.

422
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:45,231
Hey, what's that?
- From Bobby in Korea.

423
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:48,567
Are you going with a Korean?
- Dummy, he's a marine.

424
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,039
A marine? Whooo.

425
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,503
Wanna see a picture?

426
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:57,908
God. You're turning into a one-woman USO.

427
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,121
Hey, you guys, Sandy's sick.

428
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:05,251
I just did one ear.
She saw the blood and... bleurgh.

429
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,545
You won't get your hands on my ears.

430
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:12,341
Yeah? You'll be sorry. I have been
accepted to La Cafury Beauty School.

431
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,552
You're dropping out of Rydell?

432
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:19,473
I don't see it as dropping out. I see
it as a very strategic career move.

433
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:24,078
Why's it torn in half?
- His old girlfriend was in it.

434
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,663
Er... Sandy,
here's your toothbrush.

435
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:36,124
Thanks, Frenchy.
I'm sorry to be so much trouble.

436
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,173
It's OK.

437
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,705
Miss Goody Two-Shoes
makes me wanna barf.

438
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:46,637
 Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee...

439
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:50,468
... Lousy with virginity...

440
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:54,344
... Won't go to bed Till I'm legally wed...

441
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,359
... I can't, I'm Sandra Dee

442
00:28:58,779 --> 00:28:59,805
Watch it.

443
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,064
 Hey, I'm Doris Day...

444
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:06,031
... I was not brought up that way...

445
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,440
... Won't come across
Even Rock Hudson lost...

446
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,581
... His heart to Doris Day...

447
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:16,322
... I don't drink
- No.

448
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,948
 Or swear
- Oh.

449
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,909
 I don't rat my hair
- Yeurgh.

450
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:23,037
 I get ill from one cigarette (coughs)...

451
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:27,302
... Keep your filthy paws
Off my silky drawers...

452
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:31,088
... Would you pull that crap with Annette?

453
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,563
 As for you, Troy Donahue...

454
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,163
... I know what you wanna do...

455
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:44,016
... You've got your crust
I'm no object of lust...

456
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:47,402
... I'm just plain Sandra Dee...

457
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,829
... Elvis. Elvis.

458
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,954
 Let me be...

459
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,903
... Keep that pelvis far from me...

460
00:29:56,003 --> 00:30:00,748
... Just keep your cool
Now you're starting to drool...

461
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,917
... Hey, fongool...

462
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,845
... I'm Sandra Dee

463
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,895
Making fun of me, Rizz?

464
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,276
Some people are so touchy.

465
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:33,107
 Later on they start to scratch...
- Shut up, you vultures.

466
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,900
I changed my mind. Let's go.

467
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,319
What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

468
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,419
(Squealing)...

469
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:44,493
They can't come. My folks'll flip.
- Putzie, you call her.

470
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,796
Oh, Sandy.
Wherefore art thou, Sandy?

471
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,930
Shut up. Sit down.

472
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,335
You goody-goodies are too much.

473
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:57,631
I'm gonna get my kicks while
I'm still young enough to get 'em.

474
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,092
Is she gonna shinny down the drainpipe?

475
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,317
Hey, look. There's Rizzo.

476
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,081
You're doing that without a net.

477
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,815
Swell bunch, rushing to help a lady.

478
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,651
Lady? I don't see a lady.
- Shut up. Shut up.

479
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,918
What's up, Kenick?
- One guess.

480
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:25,296
You got a lot to offer a girl.
- Yeah, you know it.

481
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:29,923
What say you, Zuke?
- You're lookin' good, Rizz.

482
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:35,016
Eat your heart out.
- Sloppy seconds ain't my style.

483
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,611
You going to flog your log?

484
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:48,146
It's better than hanging around
with you dorks.

485
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,070
Your chariot, my lady.

486
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,074
I don't know what I saw in Danny Zuko.

487
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:08,489
Don't sweat it, honey.
Have one of mine.

488
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,747
There's so many of them.
- I know.

489
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:15,000
How do you keep up with them?
- I'm a terrific pen pal.

490
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,820
Hopelessly devoted to every one.

491
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,513
What are you doing?

492
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,558
OK. What do you think this is?
A gangbang?

493
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,658
You wish.
- (All laugh)

494
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,853
Hit the pavement.

495
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,397
You gotta be kidding.

496
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,573
I said now.
- Alright.

497
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,832
Remember us in your will.

498
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:50,661
When a guy picks a chick
over his buddies, something's wrong.

499
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:54,501
Come on, guys,
let's go for a slice of pizza.

500
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,799
Can I have some of that?

501
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:00,011
Sure.

502
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,304
Thanks.
- Wait.

503
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,196
(Door closes)...

504
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:28,254
... Guess mine is not
the first heart broken...

505
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:34,298
... My eyes are not the first to cry...

506
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:38,694
... I'm not the first to know...

507
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:43,685
... There's just no getting over you...

508
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:54,322
... You know,
I'm just a fool who's willing...

509
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,361
... To sit around and wait for you...

510
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,335
... But, baby, can't you see?

511
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:09,747
 There's nothing else for me to do...

512
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:16,632
... I'm hopelessly devoted to you...

513
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:24,056
... But now there's nowhere to hide...

514
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:27,418
... Since you pushed my love aside...

515
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:30,940
... I'm out of my head...

516
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:36,823
... Hopelessly devoted to you...

517
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:43,739
... Hopelessly devoted to you...

518
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:53,208
... Hopelessly devoted to you...

519
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,301
... My head is saying...

520
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:03,476
... Fool, forget him...

521
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,671
... My heart is saying...

522
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:09,187
... Don't let go...

523
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:13,685
... Hold on to the end...

524
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:18,150
... And that's what I intend to do...

525
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:25,658
... I'm hopelessly devoted to you...

526
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:32,453
... But now there's nowhere to hide...

527
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,819
... Since you pushed my love aside...

528
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:39,627
... I'm out of my head...

529
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:45,268
... Hopelessly devoted to you...

530
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:51,934
... Hopelessly devoted to you...

531
00:35:55,863 --> 00:36:02,577
... Hopelessly devoted to you...

532
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,656
...(radio) Is acne ruining your life?

533
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:17,326
Do you close your eyes when you
look in the mirror? Fear no more.

534
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:21,705
Face up to Face-Off, for deep
penetration into infected pores.

535
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:25,630
Help dry up unsightly pimples
and blemishes...

536
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,101
...(grunts)...

537
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:43,894
Rizz. Rizz.
- Could you call me by my first name?

538
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,994
Oh, erm...

539
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,147
Betty.

540
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,247
Betty. Betty.

541
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:59,491
Have you got something?
- Are you kidding?

542
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:09,044
My 25-cent insurance policy.

543
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,144
Big spender.

544
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,808
What?
- It broke.

545
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:19,102
How could it break?

546
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:23,055
I bought it when I was in seventh grade.

547
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,619
Ohhh...

548
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,049
What the hell?

549
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:47,306
(Crash)...

550
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:53,339
What the hell are you doin'?
- It's a no-parking zone, creep.

551
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:56,383
The whole place is a no-parking zone,
crater-face.

552
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,523
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

553
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
(Crash)

554
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:05,351
You're gonna pay for that.

555
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:10,721
I'll give you 75 cents for
the whole car, including your chick.

556
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:21,659
We just have to bang out the dent.

557
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:25,579
The problem's not in the dent,
it's this rubber-band engine.

558
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,416
The problem's your mouth.
- Where you gonna get a carburettor?

559
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:33,921
Ever heard of borrowing?
- Kenickie, you got any Scotch tape?

560
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,840
Hey, big stuff.
What do you drive, huh?

561
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,134
I drive.
- Yeah? How about you?

562
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,886
Who, me?
- Yeah.

563
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,846
What about Doody?

564
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,599
Well, I...
- That's what I thought.

565
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:51,572
C'mon, guys. This car could be
a major piece of machinery. Look.

566
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,421
This car could be systematic.

567
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:58,752
Hydromatic.

568
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,254
Ultramatic.

569
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:05,586
It could be Greased Lightning.

570
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:09,582
 You get some overhead lifters
and four-barrel quads, oh, yeah...

571
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:12,001
... Keep talking, whoa, keep talking...

572
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:15,170
... With fuel-injection cut-off
and chrome-plated rods, oh, yeah...

573
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,882
... We'll get her ready We'll get her ready...

574
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:21,010
... With a four-speed on the floor
They'll be waiting at the door...

575
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,762
... You know that ain't no shit
We'll be getting lots of tit...

576
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,723
... In Greased Lightning
-  Go, go, go...

577
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:27,182
... Go-go-go-go...

578
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:30,561

... Go, go, go, go-go-go-go...

585

and 30-inch fins, oh, yeah...

586
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:56,031
... A palomino dashboard
and dual-muffler twins, oh, yeah...

587
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:59,965
... With new pistons, plugs and shocks
I can get off my rocks...

588
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:03,052
... You know that I ain't braggin'
She's a real pussy wagon...

589
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:05,277

00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:53,340
... For Greased Lightning

602
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:08,287
Come on, guys. Let's get to work.

603
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,360
(Yelling)

604
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:28,524
Those Scorpions,
they're asking for it.

605
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:32,910
Danny, what's up?
You still thinking about that chick?

606
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,094
You nuts?
- No, I was just thinking.

607
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:39,111
Don't think so much.
- That's cool.

608
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:44,269
Hey, guys.

609
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:48,097
Kenickie, Zuko.
- How's it hangin'?

610
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,783
OK, the meeting is in session.

611
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:57,268
Know what I heard? Last year the fuzz
had Thunder Road staked out.

612
00:42:57,368 --> 00:43:01,689
Everyone got hauled to the clink.
- No one'll catch Greased Lightning.

613
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:04,077
Yeah?
- Yeah.

614
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:08,487
Somebody snaking you, Danny?
- Bite the weenie, Rizz.

615
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:10,587
With relish.

616
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:19,415
I don't know about these chicks.
- They're only good for one thing.

617
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:24,420
What do you do with 'em
the other 23 hours 45 minutes a day?

618
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,985
Does it only take 15 minutes?

619
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:31,271
Want some new music?

620
00:43:31,402 --> 00:43:34,071
Yeah.
- I'll need some money.

621
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:39,032
Thanks.

622
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:44,246
(Wolf whistles)

623
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:47,165
I'll be right back.

624
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:54,464
Hi, Danny.

625
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,995
I can't talk.
- What are you doing later?

626
00:43:58,095 --> 00:44:00,815
I can't talk, alright?
- Call me.

627
00:44:11,442 --> 00:44:13,600
Hi, Sandy.
- Oh, hi.

628
00:44:13,736 --> 00:44:16,031
How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

629
00:44:16,113 --> 00:44:17,598
That's good.

630
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:21,227
Sandy, I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time.

631
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:24,355
What about?
- About the night at the bonfire.

632
00:44:24,455 --> 00:44:26,857
The way I acted, that was terrible.

633
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:30,160
It wasn't me, you gotta know that.

634
00:44:30,294 --> 00:44:33,524
It was me, of course,
but it wasn't me.

635
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:37,284
You see, Sandy,
I got this image, right? And...

636
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:41,974
That's why I'm so glad
that Tom's such a simple person.

637
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:49,713
Simple's right.
Too bad his brains are in his biceps.

638
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:51,813
Jealous, are you?

639
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:56,604
Jealous? Oh, come on, Sandy,
don't make me laugh.

640
00:44:57,321 --> 00:44:59,361
What have you ever done?

641
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:05,854
Come on. I can run circles
around those jerks.

642
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:08,674
I'll believe that when I see it.

643
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:38,097
Let's start with the first rule. Cut
it down to two packs a day. There.

644
00:45:40,364 --> 00:45:43,767
What sort of athletics are you interested in?

645
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:44,977
You like the rings?

646
00:45:45,077 --> 00:45:49,327
Yeah, I installed a set
just a couple of weeks ago.

647
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:54,361
The first thing we have to do
is you have to change.

648
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:56,614
That's why I'm here, to change.

649
00:45:56,714 --> 00:46:00,047
No, I mean your clothes.
- Oh.

650
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:08,834
Alright. Let's knock it off.

651
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:14,640
Fellas, I wanna introduce a new man.
Danny. Let's give him a tryout.

652
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:21,489
Better watch it.
- Come on. A little fire, here we go.

653
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:36,585
You have to dribble.

654
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,201
Here you go, Coach.
- Thanks, son.

655
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:44,703
Dribble the ball,
put it in the basket.

656
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:47,831
Think you can do that?
- Can I do that.

657
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:50,968
OK.
- Danny, over here. Danny.

658
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:53,101
Let's go.

659
00:46:55,064 --> 00:46:57,064
That's it. Go, go, go.

660
00:46:57,733 --> 00:46:59,733
Get him, Danny.

661
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:05,641
(Whistle)
- What'd I do?

662
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:08,493
Is he kidding?
- Boy, oh, boy.

663
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:16,450
I want you to meet
your wrestling partner. Danny, Andy.

664
00:47:18,295 --> 00:47:20,072
Are you crazy?

665
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:23,409
Come on, come on.
Let's start. Get in first position.

666
00:47:23,509 --> 00:47:25,751
Danny, you get down.

667
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:28,258
OK, Andy, get down. Ready?

668
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:33,016
(Whistle)

669
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:35,811
Hold it, hold it.

670
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,100
Danny, you gotta try. Come on.

671
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:45,709
Alright, Andy, let's change
positions. You get down. Come on.

672
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:51,451
Alright. Ready?

673
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:53,453
(Whistle)...

674
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:56,150
Give?
- Yeah, give.

675
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,250
Good.

676
00:48:02,715 --> 00:48:04,715
He's a hitter.

677
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:11,373
You'll like baseball. It's not
that much of a contact sport.

678
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:13,959
Get in there and let's see what you can do.

679
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:16,354
Throw the ball. Let's play.

680
00:48:17,563 --> 00:48:19,340
Let's pitch this guy out.

681
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,218
He can't hit.
- This boy can't even bat.

682
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:25,346
Strike.
- I told you. He doesn't even swing.

683
00:48:25,446 --> 00:48:29,526
What kind of ball player are you?
Put it in here.

684
00:48:30,743 --> 00:48:32,743
Strike.

685
00:48:33,871 --> 00:48:38,376
Come on. A little fire in there.
Let's see you hit it.

686
00:48:41,712 --> 00:48:43,712
Foul ball.

687
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,542
Easy, easy.
- Now. Come on.

688
00:48:48,677 --> 00:48:51,652
Put the bat down. Put the bat down.

689
00:48:52,556 --> 00:48:56,085
There's a lot of other sports
that don't have any contact.

690
00:48:56,185 --> 00:48:58,890
Yeah, like what?
- Like track.

691
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:02,931
What do you mean, running?
- Just like running?

692
00:49:03,484 --> 00:49:05,886
I mean something that needs endurance.

693
00:49:05,986 --> 00:49:10,831
Something that needs stamina.
Like, long-distance running.

694
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:13,150
Cross-country running.

695
00:49:15,496 --> 00:49:17,738
That could be cool.
- Good.

696
00:49:44,692 --> 00:49:46,692
Danny.

697
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:52,147
Danny, are you alright?

698
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:56,284
Danny, talk to me.

699
00:49:57,162 --> 00:50:00,733
The least you can do is talk to me
after the way you treated me.

700
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:03,652
The way I...?
Sandy, I told you I was sorry.

701
00:50:03,752 --> 00:50:05,752
Got you talking.

702
00:50:07,006 --> 00:50:09,981
You sure you're OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

703
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,745
So, still dating that jockstrap?
- Well...

704
00:50:15,556 --> 00:50:19,501
Is he taking you to the dance?
- Well, that all depends.

705
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:21,170
On what?
- On you.

706
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:23,270
On me?
- Yeah.

707
00:50:23,564 --> 00:50:25,564
He can stag it.

708
00:50:30,988 --> 00:50:32,556
Come on.

709
00:50:32,656 --> 00:50:34,656
(Horn)...

710
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:37,964
...(music plays in background)...

711
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:47,625
Sandy, let's go someplace else.
- Why?

712
00:50:49,757 --> 00:50:51,825
We can't be alone here, that's why.

713
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:53,925
Danny.

714
00:50:55,262 --> 00:50:57,262
OK.

715
00:51:04,772 --> 00:51:06,757
You nearly pulled my arm out.

716
00:51:06,857 --> 00:51:10,928
I didn't want to miss this table.
It's the best one.

717
00:51:11,028 --> 00:51:14,139
What are you doing?
- I just want privacy.

718
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:17,685
What'll it be, kids?
- Cherry soda, please.

719
00:51:17,785 --> 00:51:19,770
Danny?
- I'm not very hungry.

720
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:24,275
Give me a double polar burger with
everything and a soda with ice cream.

721
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:26,443
Sounds good. I'll have the same.

722
00:51:26,543 --> 00:51:28,737
The same? You can eat a lot.

723
00:51:28,837 --> 00:51:31,210
You're funny.
- No, you are.

724
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:35,619
How ya doing, Zuke? Nice.
- Hiya, Rizzo. How are you?

725
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:37,878
Peachy keen, jelly bean.

726
00:51:38,347 --> 00:51:41,584
You got any quarters?
We could split an Eskimo Pie.

727
00:51:41,684 --> 00:51:45,963
My Dutch treat days are over.
- You plan on staying home a lot.

728
00:51:46,063 --> 00:51:49,717
Greetings, pals and gals.
Anybody got 23 cents?

729
00:51:49,817 --> 00:51:52,303
Wanna chip in for a Dog-Sled Delight?

730
00:51:52,403 --> 00:51:56,682
I don't know where my money goes.
A dime here, 15 cents there.

731
00:51:56,782 --> 00:51:59,935
In a couple of months
Frenchy can take us all out.

732
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:01,812
A working girl with income.

733
00:52:01,912 --> 00:52:05,024
Y'know, they don't pay
that much to start with.

734
00:52:05,124 --> 00:52:09,194
It's more than we make. Ante up,
I don't get my allowance till Friday.

735
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:11,822
You get an allowance?
- When I'm a good boy.

736
00:52:11,922 --> 00:52:14,533
Viola, a Dog-Sled Delight with four spoons.

737
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:18,203
And an Eskimo Pie with a knife.
- Hi, gang.

738
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:22,150
Here you are. Grab it and growl.

739
00:52:25,686 --> 00:52:28,047
I got so many hickeys I look like a leper.

740
00:52:28,147 --> 00:52:32,218
Cheer up. A hickey from Kenickie
is like a Hallmark card.

741
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:35,548
You care enough to send the very best.

742
00:52:36,196 --> 00:52:39,596
You pig.
- I love it when you talk dirty.

743
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:45,898
My parents want to invite you
to tea on Sunday. Will you come?

744
00:52:45,998 --> 00:52:49,993
I don't like tea.
- You don't have to drink tea.

745
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:52,380
Well, I don't like parents.

746
00:52:54,548 --> 00:52:56,920
Want some?
- Erm, uh-uh.

747
00:52:57,051 --> 00:52:59,036
You sure are a cheap date.

748
00:52:59,136 --> 00:53:02,206
I didn't mean it like that.
- I understand.

749
00:53:02,306 --> 00:53:05,805
I always found you understanding.
- I am.

750
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:09,849
I also think
there's more to you than just fat.

751
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,685
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

752
00:53:12,816 --> 00:53:14,885
Got a date for the dance-off?
- No.

753
00:53:14,985 --> 00:53:16,220
Wanna go?
- Yeah.

754
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:21,058
I'll be a senior forever if
I don't study for that algebra test.

755
00:53:21,158 --> 00:53:24,061
You're in luck.
You got an armed escort home.

756
00:53:24,161 --> 00:53:28,357
It's not the arms I'm worried about,
Sonny. It's the hands.

757
00:53:28,457 --> 00:53:30,457
She loves me.

758
00:53:32,503 --> 00:53:34,822
You coming, French?
- I don't think so.

759
00:53:34,922 --> 00:53:38,033
I think I'll hang out a bit longer.
- Alright.

760
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:43,038
I have been dieting all day long. My
mom's apple pie's better than this.

761
00:53:43,138 --> 00:53:45,943
Do you want a piece?
- Yeah, sure.

762
00:53:46,475 --> 00:53:47,835
Putzie.
- Yeah?

763
00:53:47,935 --> 00:53:49,935
15 minutes.

764
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:55,342
I'm worried about this dance-off. Do
they dance differently to back home?

765
00:53:55,442 --> 00:53:59,522
Don't worry.
Maybe we'll invent the Kangaroo Bop.

766
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:03,058
Let's get out of here, Sandy.

767
00:54:03,158 --> 00:54:05,158
See you later.

768
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:07,917
Bye, Frenchy.
- See ya, Sandy.

769
00:54:10,165 --> 00:54:14,075
Great. I'm stuck with the check.
Give me money.

770
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,407
OK, what's with you tonight?
You got the personality of a wet mop.

771
00:54:18,507 --> 00:54:23,182
Don't start with me.
- Fine. How about I finish with ya?

772
00:54:23,387 --> 00:54:25,387
Finish this.

773
00:54:26,432 --> 00:54:28,642
To you from me, Pinky Lee.

774
00:54:30,811 --> 00:54:32,811
Sorry, French.

775
00:54:37,484 --> 00:54:41,139
(Distant) Hey, Rizzo.
I want to talk to you.

776
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:45,184
No use crying over spilt milk shake.

777
00:54:45,284 --> 00:54:47,284
Oh, I'll be OK.

778
00:54:48,746 --> 00:54:50,814
You know it's near closing time?

779
00:54:50,914 --> 00:54:53,025
Do you mind if I stay a bit longer?

780
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:55,125
No, suit yourself.

781
00:54:55,252 --> 00:54:57,708
Wow.
- What?

782
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:01,992
I hate to tell you, but your
hair looks like an Easter egg.

783
00:55:02,092 --> 00:55:03,953
Oh, yeah.

784
00:55:04,053 --> 00:55:07,414
Well, I had a little trouble in tinting class.

785
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:10,834
In fact, I had a little trouble
in all my classes.

786
00:55:10,934 --> 00:55:14,296
Beauty school sure wasn't
what I thought it'd be.

787
00:55:14,396 --> 00:55:16,396
Nothing ever is.

788
00:55:19,818 --> 00:55:26,437
Vi? Erm... I dropped out.
What do you think of waitressing?

789
00:55:26,575 --> 00:55:28,700
You're too young to know.

790
00:55:29,411 --> 00:55:32,641
Maybe I could be a telephone operator.

791
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:37,444
No, I don't think I'd like to wear
those little things over my ears.

792
00:55:37,544 --> 00:55:42,984
God, if only I could have a guardian
angel to tell me what to do.

793
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:47,470
Like Debbie Reynolds had in Tammy.
What do you think?

794
00:55:47,763 --> 00:55:51,248
If you find him,
give him my phone number.

795
00:56:06,115 --> 00:56:09,400
 Your story's sad to tell...

796
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:13,986
... A teenage ne'er-do-well...

797
00:56:14,957 --> 00:56:20,663
... Most mixed-up non-delinquent
on the block...

798
00:56:22,339 --> 00:56:26,503
... Your future's so unclear now...

799
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:30,884
... What's left of your career now?

800
00:56:31,515 --> 00:56:39,226
 Can't even get a trade-in on your smock...

801
00:56:54,496 --> 00:56:56,961
... Beauty school dropout...

802
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:01,036
... No graduation day for you...

803
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:03,635
... Beauty school dropout...

804
00:57:04,298 --> 00:57:07,743
... Missed your midterms
and flunked shampoo...

805
00:57:07,843 --> 00:57:10,955
... Well, at least you
could have taken time...

806
00:57:11,055 --> 00:57:14,208
... To wash and clean your clothes up...

807
00:57:14,308 --> 00:57:16,752
... After spending all that dough...

808
00:57:16,852 --> 00:57:19,922
... To have the doctor fix your nose up...

809
00:57:20,022 --> 00:57:22,022
... Baby, get movin'

810
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:26,562
 Why keep your feeble hopes alive?

811
00:57:26,695 --> 00:57:29,723
 What are you provin'?
-  What are you provin'?

812
00:57:29,823 --> 00:57:33,269
 You've got the dream but not the drive...

813
00:57:33,369 --> 00:57:36,369
... If you go for your diploma...

814
00:57:36,497 --> 00:57:39,472
... You could join a steno-pool...

815
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:41,610
... Turn in your teasing-comb...

816
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:44,711
... And go back to high school...

817
00:57:48,926 --> 00:57:51,391
... Beauty school dropout...

818
00:57:52,137 --> 00:57:54,874
... Hangin' around the corner store...

819
00:57:54,974 --> 00:57:57,809
... Beauty school dropout...

820
00:57:58,602 --> 00:58:01,964
... It's about time you knew the score...

821
00:58:02,064 --> 00:58:05,301
... Well, they couldn't teach you anything...

822
00:58:05,401 --> 00:58:08,429
... You think you're such a looker...

823
00:58:08,529 --> 00:58:11,599
... But no customer would go to you...

824
00:58:11,699 --> 00:58:14,334
... Unless she was a hooker...

825
00:58:19,373 --> 00:58:22,443
... Baby, don't sweat it
-  Don't sweat it...

826
00:58:22,543 --> 00:58:25,821
... You're not cut out to hold a job...

827
00:58:25,921 --> 00:58:29,066
... Better forget it
-  Forget it...

828
00:58:29,174 --> 00:58:32,286
... Who wants their hair done by a slob?

829
00:58:32,386 --> 00:58:35,956
 Now your bangs are curled,
your lashes twirled...

830
00:58:36,056 --> 00:58:38,751
... But still the world is cruel...

831
00:58:38,851 --> 00:58:41,045
... Wipe off that angel face...

832
00:58:41,145 --> 00:58:44,035
... And go back to high school...

833
00:58:45,232 --> 00:58:47,527
... Baby, don't blow it...

834
00:58:48,569 --> 00:58:51,597
... Don't put my good advice to shame...

835
00:58:51,697 --> 00:58:53,822
... Baby, you know it...

836
00:58:55,034 --> 00:58:58,354
... Even Dear Abby would say the same...

837
00:58:58,454 --> 00:59:01,815
... Now, I've called the shot,
get off the pot...

838
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:06,459
... I've really got to fly...

839
00:59:07,546 --> 00:59:13,419
... Gotta be going to that malt shop...

840
00:59:13,552 --> 00:59:20,005
... In the sky...

841
00:59:24,438 --> 00:59:27,355
... Beauty school dropout...

842
00:59:27,483 --> 00:59:30,033
... Go back to high school...

843
00:59:30,778 --> 00:59:33,695
... Beauty school dropout...

844
00:59:33,822 --> 00:59:36,444
... Go back to high school...

845
00:59:37,034 --> 00:59:40,035
... Beauty school dropout...

846
00:59:40,162 --> 00:59:44,207
... Go back to high school...

847
00:59:56,512 --> 00:59:59,456
Lower your head, Kenickie.
- What are you doing?

848
00:59:59,556 --> 01:00:01,959
Give him a break.
- Oh, I will.

849
01:00:02,059 --> 01:00:04,670
No, we'll work on the brakes later.

850
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,463
Move over, slick.

851
01:00:06,563 --> 01:00:08,549
Fruitcake, you got it on backwards.

852
01:00:08,649 --> 01:00:12,644
What car did you swipe it from?
- Your mother's.

853
01:00:19,785 --> 01:00:21,785
Rizz.

854
01:00:28,335 --> 01:00:31,820
Can you believe it?
Nationwide television.

855
01:00:34,633 --> 01:00:37,745
How you doing?
- Still gonna go to the dance?

856
01:00:37,845 --> 01:00:41,500
Man, I'm gonna have the hottest date there.

857
01:00:41,974 --> 01:00:45,669
Biggest thing to happen to Rydell
and we don't have dates.

858
01:00:45,769 --> 01:00:48,797
Maybe Rudi from the Capri Lounge?
- Get serious.

859
01:00:48,897 --> 01:00:52,382
It's a suggestion.
- I already called him.

860
01:00:58,282 --> 01:01:01,342
Relax. I think our luck is changing.

861
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:09,944
Do you know what you're doing?

862
01:01:10,044 --> 01:01:12,254
What we're doing. Come on.

863
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:44,075
Hey, Marty. Lookin' good.

864
01:01:45,412 --> 01:01:48,472
Would you just excuse me one second?

865
01:01:50,918 --> 01:01:53,076
Feelin' good, too, huh?

866
01:01:53,212 --> 01:01:55,823
Sonny. There he is. Vince Fontaine.

867
01:01:55,923 --> 01:01:58,117
I seen better heads on a mug of beer.

868
01:01:58,217 --> 01:02:03,317
Grow up. He's the living end.
- Yeah, if you like older guys.

869
01:02:16,443 --> 01:02:18,053
Danny, this is so exciting.

870
01:02:18,153 --> 01:02:20,848
You gotta make friends
with the cameraman.

871
01:02:20,948 --> 01:02:23,498
You know him?
- His name's Ted.

872
01:02:24,326 --> 01:02:25,978
Doody, how do I look?

873
01:02:26,078 --> 01:02:29,743
Like a beautiful blonde pineapple.

874
01:02:32,126 --> 01:02:34,737
You're late, fellas. Where you been?

875
01:02:34,837 --> 01:02:38,282
The gym never looked so good.
- You bring the provisions?

876
01:02:38,382 --> 01:02:41,357
Alright, kids. I want a big circle.

877
01:02:43,429 --> 01:02:47,458
Come on, boys and girls,
we are going on the air very shortly.

878
01:02:47,558 --> 01:02:53,253
But first, some warm-up numbers
with Johnny Casino and the Gamblers.

879
01:03:01,196 --> 01:03:06,296
 Oh, baby, rock'n'roll
is here to stay, it will never die...

880
01:03:07,036 --> 01:03:11,440
... It was meant to be that way,
though I don't know why...

881
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:16,237
... I don't care what people say
Rock'n'roll is here to stay...

882
01:03:16,337 --> 01:03:20,908
... We don't care what people say
Rock'n'roll is here to stay...

883
01:03:21,008 --> 01:03:25,053
... Everybody rock, everybody rock...

884
01:03:25,804 --> 01:03:29,553
... Everybody rock, everybody rock...

885
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:32,309
... Come on...

886
01:03:32,394 --> 01:03:34,394
... Everybody rock...

887
01:03:34,897 --> 01:03:39,760
... If you don't like rock'n'roll,
think what you'd be missin'

888
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:44,056
 If you like to bop and stroll,
come on down and listen...

889
01:03:44,156 --> 01:03:46,559
... Let's all start to have a ball...

890
01:03:46,659 --> 01:03:49,124
... Everybody rock'n'roll...

891
01:03:58,003 --> 01:04:00,531
What are their names?
- Fred and Ginger.

892
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:02,631
Fred and Ginger.

893
01:04:25,864 --> 01:04:30,561
I hope I don't get camera fright.
- Don't worry, we'll be cool.

894
01:04:30,661 --> 01:04:32,661
Yeah?
- Don't worry?

895
01:04:32,663 --> 01:04:34,703
Good. Come on, let's go.

896
01:04:37,251 --> 01:04:40,869
 What's that playing on the radio?

897
01:04:41,005 --> 01:04:44,836
 Why do I start swaying to and fro?

898
01:04:44,967 --> 01:04:48,667
 I have never heard that song before...

899
01:04:48,804 --> 01:04:52,339
... But if I don't hear it any more...

900
01:04:52,474 --> 01:04:54,668
Why not let me lead for a change?

901
01:04:54,768 --> 01:04:56,837
I can't help it. I'm used to leadin'.

902
01:04:56,937 --> 01:04:58,937
OK.

903
01:05:00,816 --> 01:05:04,261
Doody, can't you
turn me around or something?

904
01:05:04,361 --> 01:05:07,598
Don't talk, Frenchy.
I'm trying to count.

905
01:05:07,698 --> 01:05:09,737
 A melody...

906
01:05:09,867 --> 01:05:11,560
... That's never the same...

907
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:14,480
... A melody that's calling your name...

908
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:17,608
Have you thought
of singing professionally?

909
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:19,777
 (Off key) Come back to me-e-e...

910
01:05:19,877 --> 01:05:22,488
... Please...
- Hey, Zuko. Zuke.

911
01:05:22,588 --> 01:05:25,199
I want you to meet Cha Cha di Gregorio.

912
01:05:25,299 --> 01:05:27,594
How you doing, baby?
- Fine.

913
01:05:27,718 --> 01:05:28,827
Who is she?

914
01:05:28,927 --> 01:05:33,165
They call me Cha Cha, cos I'm
the best dancer at St Bernadette's.

915
01:05:33,265 --> 01:05:36,432
With the worst reputation.

916
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,560
Let's go, Sandy.

917
01:05:38,687 --> 01:05:42,852
Who's that girl?
- Just a girl I know, that's all.

918
01:05:48,989 --> 01:05:50,989
Hi.

919
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,700
I'm Vince Fontaine.

920
01:05:54,161 --> 01:05:57,523
Do your folks know
I come into your room every night?

921
01:05:57,623 --> 01:05:59,781
Over KZAZ, that is.

922
01:06:02,753 --> 01:06:05,030
I'm judging the dance contest.

923
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:06,865
I don't think I'm entered.

924
01:06:06,965 --> 01:06:09,952
A knockout like you?
What's your name?

925
01:06:10,052 --> 01:06:12,377
Marty.
- Marty what?

926
01:06:12,513 --> 01:06:15,929
Maraschino. You know, like in cherry.

927
01:06:39,665 --> 01:06:42,895
What are you doing?
- Washing my hands.

928
01:06:43,627 --> 01:06:46,747
 You don't remember me...

929
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,336
... But I remember you...

930
01:06:49,466 --> 01:06:52,253
... It was not so long ago...

931
01:06:52,386 --> 01:06:54,413
... You broke my heart in two...

932
01:06:54,513 --> 01:06:57,182
... Tears on my pillow...

933
01:06:57,808 --> 01:06:59,848
... Pain in my heart...

934
01:06:59,852 --> 01:07:03,252
... Caused by you,
you, you, you, you...

935
01:07:03,314 --> 01:07:05,314
How do you know her?

936
01:07:05,399 --> 01:07:09,649
Erm, she's an old friend
of the family, that's all.

937
01:07:09,653 --> 01:07:12,144
 Love is not a toy...

938
01:07:12,281 --> 01:07:15,017
... When you find the one you love...

939
01:07:15,117 --> 01:07:17,937
Aren't you glad to be back?
- Oh, yeah.

940
01:07:18,037 --> 01:07:20,927
Besides, blondes do have more fun.

941
01:07:21,665 --> 01:07:24,370
 If we could start anew...

942
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:26,796
... I wouldn't hesitate...

943
01:07:28,881 --> 01:07:31,992
When I hear music,
I can't make my feet behave.

944
01:07:32,092 --> 01:07:35,407
Thinks she's Tinker Bell.
- Hush, Sonny.

945
01:07:35,512 --> 01:07:37,920
 Pain in my heart...

946
01:07:38,057 --> 01:07:40,057
... Caused by you...

947
01:07:40,643 --> 01:07:42,801
... You-ou-ou-ou

948
01:07:44,938 --> 01:07:47,512
Sshh.

949
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:49,891
The Rydell fight song.

950
01:08:13,592 --> 01:08:15,964
When you are finished...

951
01:08:17,054 --> 01:08:22,579
You will be happy to know that
I am not judging the dance contest.

952
01:08:26,855 --> 01:08:29,466
I think we all owe a round of applause...

953
01:08:29,566 --> 01:08:33,220
...to Patty Simcox and Eugene Felznik
and committee...

954
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,681
...for their beautiful decorations.

955
01:08:35,781 --> 01:08:38,756
Let's hear it for the toilet paper.

956
01:08:41,662 --> 01:08:46,859
In a few moments, the entire nation
will be watching Rydell High,

957
01:08:46,959 --> 01:08:51,238
God help us, and I want you all
to be on your best behaviour.

958
01:08:51,338 --> 01:08:53,338
No heinie-biting.

959
01:08:55,092 --> 01:08:56,785
And now, here he is,

960
01:08:56,885 --> 01:08:58,746
the Prince of the Platters,

961
01:08:58,846 --> 01:09:01,301
Mr Vince Fontaine.

962
01:09:07,938 --> 01:09:10,607
Mr Vince Fontaine?

963
01:09:23,162 --> 01:09:25,162
(Drum rolls)

964
01:09:34,757 --> 01:09:38,339
Hey, it's great being here at Rydell High.

965
01:09:40,387 --> 01:09:42,852
What's your name, sweetheart?

966
01:09:45,476 --> 01:09:47,931
And now, for the rules.

967
01:09:50,981 --> 01:09:54,849
Game rule one.
All couples must be boy-girl.

968
01:09:54,985 --> 01:09:57,108
Too bad, Eugene.

969
01:09:59,657 --> 01:10:01,867
Alright, alright. Come on.

970
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:04,853
Game rule two.
During the dance contest,

971
01:10:04,953 --> 01:10:10,401
if you're tapped on the shoulder,
leave the floor, or else. I mean it.

972
01:10:10,501 --> 01:10:13,571
And rule three,
anyone doing tasteless...

973
01:10:13,671 --> 01:10:17,032
...or vulgar movements will be disqualified.

974
01:10:17,132 --> 01:10:19,132
That leaves us out.

975
01:10:22,805 --> 01:10:25,291
Keep it clean, please. Keep it clean.

976
01:10:25,391 --> 01:10:27,679
20 seconds.

977
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:31,297
Thank you, fans and friends.
Now a few words to the wise.

978
01:10:31,397 --> 01:10:33,090
You are my best pals.

979
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:37,136
To look your best for the contest,
just have a ball, that's all.

980
01:10:37,236 --> 01:10:39,513
Forget the camera, keep on the beat,

981
01:10:39,613 --> 01:10:43,100
give the folks at home a treat.
Keep dancin', that's showbiz.

982
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,478
If I tap you, step aside.
Let the others ride.

983
01:10:46,578 --> 01:10:48,904
Ten seconds. Nine, eight,

984
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:52,622
seven, six, five, four,

985
01:10:52,751 --> 01:10:56,120
three, two, one. On the air.

986
01:10:56,797 --> 01:11:00,534
Welcome to National Bandstand,
live from Rydell High School.

987
01:11:00,634 --> 01:11:03,454
This is what you're waiting for,
the dance-off.

988
01:11:03,554 --> 01:11:07,464
Away we go with
Johnny Casino and the Gamblers.

989
01:11:08,684 --> 01:11:11,295
 You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...

990
01:11:11,395 --> 01:11:13,464
... Cryin' all the time...

991
01:11:13,564 --> 01:11:16,300
... You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...

992
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,594
... Cryin' all the time...

993
01:11:18,694 --> 01:11:22,640
... You ain't never caught a rabbit
and you ain't no friend of mine

994
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:24,865
Look. There's the camera.

995
01:11:33,584 --> 01:11:35,584
That's Putzie and Jan.

996
01:11:48,307 --> 01:11:52,387
 Said you was high class,
that was just a lie...

997
01:11:53,312 --> 01:11:57,732
... Call yourself high class,
that was just a lie...

998
01:11:58,108 --> 01:12:00,719
... Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit...

999
01:12:00,819 --> 01:12:03,441
Oh, there's Danny and Sandy.

1000
01:12:03,572 --> 01:12:05,641
 You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...

1001
01:12:05,741 --> 01:12:08,036
... Cryin' all the time...

1002
01:12:10,704 --> 01:12:12,815
... Cryin' all the time...

1003
01:12:12,915 --> 01:12:18,865
... You ain't never caught a rabbit
and you ain't no friend of mine...

1004
01:12:20,005 --> 01:12:22,045
...(song ends)

1005
01:12:22,174 --> 01:12:25,870
Now the event you've all been
waiting for, the national dance-off.

1006
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:28,956
Some guy and gal will get
some fantabulous prizes.

1007
01:12:29,056 --> 01:12:32,585
Don't feel bad if I tap you out.
It don't matter if you win or lose,

1008
01:12:32,685 --> 01:12:35,462
it's what you do with your dancin' shoes.

1009
01:12:35,562 --> 01:12:38,197
Does everybody here know Marty?

1010
01:12:40,234 --> 01:12:45,249
OK, cats, throw your mittens
round your kittens. Away we go.

1011
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:50,227
That wasn't supposed to happen.

1012
01:12:50,327 --> 01:12:52,818
Let's go, let's hand-jive.

1013
01:12:54,415 --> 01:12:57,560
 Before I was born late one night...

1014
01:12:58,168 --> 01:13:01,653
... My papa said everything's alright...

1015
01:13:01,922 --> 01:13:03,782
... The doctor made my ma lay down...

1016
01:13:03,882 --> 01:13:07,197
Guy with the girl in red,
throw 'em out.

1017
01:13:09,221 --> 01:13:11,540
 Cos the bebop stork was about to arrive...

1018
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,040
... Mama gave birth to the hand-jive...

1019
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:18,714
... I could barely walk
when I milked a cow...

1020
01:13:18,814 --> 01:13:22,259
... When I was three I pushed a plough...

1021
01:13:22,359 --> 01:13:26,099
... While choppin' wood I'd move my legs...

1022
01:13:26,113 --> 01:13:30,059
... And I started dancin'
while I gathered eggs...

1023
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:32,144
... Townsfolk clapped, I was only five...

1024
01:13:32,244 --> 01:13:35,731
... I'd outdance 'em all,
I was born to hand-jive

1025
01:13:35,831 --> 01:13:38,666
Yes, split 'em, buddy.

1026
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:41,414
Go, go, go, go.

1027
01:13:41,545 --> 01:13:43,545
Shake it. Shake it.

1028
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:45,630
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

1029
01:13:46,425 --> 01:13:48,425
Attagirl.

1030
01:13:48,886 --> 01:13:51,507
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1031
01:13:51,639 --> 01:13:55,470
Everybody.
 Born to hand-jive, baby...

1032
01:13:56,352 --> 01:13:59,637
... Born to hand-jive, baby

1033
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,440
Here we go.

1034
01:14:04,068 --> 01:14:06,703
Hey, break it up. What is that?

1035
01:14:11,742 --> 01:14:13,742
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1036
01:14:14,495 --> 01:14:16,653
C'mon now, shake it.

1037
01:14:16,789 --> 01:14:18,789
Yeah.

1038
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:21,208
Twist it.

1039
01:14:30,761 --> 01:14:32,761
Alright, get it.

1040
01:15:03,794 --> 01:15:05,571
 How low can you go?

1041
01:15:05,671 --> 01:15:07,448
 How low can you go?

1042
01:15:07,548 --> 01:15:09,548
 How low can you go?

1043
01:15:39,621 --> 01:15:41,621
There you go.

1044
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:44,833
C'mon now, hand-jive.

1045
01:16:07,149 --> 01:16:09,391
That's the stuff.

1046
01:16:12,488 --> 01:16:14,488
Do it, baby.

1047
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,200
Do it.

1048
01:16:28,379 --> 01:16:31,249
That's the hand-jive grand-jive.

1049
01:16:51,068 --> 01:16:53,448
Yeah, let's bring it up now.

1050
01:16:53,904 --> 01:16:55,904
Bring it on up.

1051
01:16:57,908 --> 01:16:59,101
Higher.

1052
01:16:59,201 --> 01:17:01,201
Higher.

1053
01:17:01,328 --> 01:17:04,413
Higher and higher.

1054
01:17:05,249 --> 01:17:08,166
 Now can you hand-jive, baby?

1055
01:17:09,044 --> 01:17:11,666
 Oh, can you hand-jive, baby?

1056
01:17:12,381 --> 01:17:14,381
 Oh, yeah...

1057
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:20,414
... Born to hand-jive, oh, yeah.

1058
01:17:20,514 --> 01:17:22,374
Oh, yeah.

1059
01:17:22,474 --> 01:17:24,668
Here they are, the new champs.

1060
01:17:24,768 --> 01:17:26,927
Come on up here.

1061
01:17:28,856 --> 01:17:34,551
Can I have your names, please?
- Cha Cha di Gregorio and Danny Zuko.

1062
01:17:35,321 --> 01:17:37,514
We'll do it now.
- Where's Marty?

1063
01:17:37,614 --> 01:17:41,099
Don't worry, she's in good hands.
- Whose?

1064
01:17:42,536 --> 01:17:46,361
Now let's see our champs
in a spotlight dance.

1065
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:51,544
 Blue moon
-  Blue, blue, blue, blue moon...

1066
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:55,502
... You saw me standing alone...

1067
01:17:58,469 --> 01:18:02,597
... Without a dream in my heart...

1068
01:18:04,725 --> 01:18:08,853
... Without a love of my own...

1069
01:18:10,564 --> 01:18:13,175
Ready? One, one, two, three, go.

1070
01:18:13,275 --> 01:18:15,517
 Blue moon...

1071
01:18:19,698 --> 01:18:21,738
Who's that on the right?

1072
01:18:22,534 --> 01:18:25,980
We have pictures of you so-called mooners.

1073
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:30,568
Just because it's not your faces
doesn't mean we can't identify you.

1074
01:18:30,668 --> 01:18:34,738
At this very moment, those pictures
are on the way to Washington,

1075
01:18:34,838 --> 01:18:40,046
where the FBI has experts
in this type of identification.

1076
01:18:40,177 --> 01:18:45,447
If you turn yourselves in now,
you may escape a federal charge.

1077
01:19:07,705 --> 01:19:10,524
C'mon, Doody. Watch your hands.
Move it out.

1078
01:19:10,624 --> 01:19:13,027
I feel like a meatball in here.

1079
01:19:13,127 --> 01:19:15,252
Let's go find the chicks.

1080
01:19:16,046 --> 01:19:18,046
Marty. Marty.

1081
01:19:22,803 --> 01:19:26,165
Hold my money. Don't let me
go near the refreshment stand.

1082
01:19:26,265 --> 01:19:29,580
I'm not hungry.
- Hey. What's happening?

1083
01:19:30,853 --> 01:19:32,892
There's nobody here.

1084
01:19:36,692 --> 01:19:39,803
Come on, Sandy.
I told you on the phone I was sorry.

1085
01:19:39,903 --> 01:19:43,140
I know you did.
- You believe me, don't you?

1086
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:47,436
Yes, but I still think
you and Cha Cha went together.

1087
01:19:47,536 --> 01:19:50,439
We did not go together.
We just went together.

1088
01:19:50,539 --> 01:19:53,540
It's the same thing.
- No. No.

1089
01:20:15,689 --> 01:20:17,729
(Screams)
- Ohh.

1090
01:20:17,858 --> 01:20:19,858
Sandy, I'm sorry.

1091
01:20:28,827 --> 01:20:30,827
Sandy...

1092
01:20:31,955 --> 01:20:34,197
Would you wear my ring?

1093
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:36,819
Danny. I don't know what to say.

1094
01:20:36,919 --> 01:20:38,995
Say, yes.
- Yes.

1095
01:20:43,842 --> 01:20:49,537
Danny, this means so much to me.
Cos I know now that you respect me.

1096
01:20:56,981 --> 01:20:58,340
Hey, Rizz?

1097
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,440
Watch it.

1098
01:21:00,943 --> 01:21:04,889
What's with you tonight?
- I feel like a defective typewriter.

1099
01:21:04,989 --> 01:21:07,600
I skipped a period.
- You think you're PG?

1100
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,184
I don't know. Big deal.

1101
01:21:09,284 --> 01:21:12,187
Was it Kenickie?
- Nah, you don't know the guy.

1102
01:21:12,287 --> 01:21:14,106
Rizz, look, it's OK.

1103
01:21:14,206 --> 01:21:18,152
I caught Vince Fontaine putting
aspirin in my Coke at the dance.

1104
01:21:18,252 --> 01:21:19,278
Hey.

1105
01:21:19,378 --> 01:21:24,733
Marty, you won't tell no one?
- Sure, I'll take it to the grave.

1106
01:21:28,262 --> 01:21:33,107
Coming through, coming through.
Come on, lady with a baby.

1107
01:21:34,935 --> 01:21:37,094
Hey, Marty, what's up?

1108
01:21:37,229 --> 01:21:39,229
Rizzo's pregnant.

1109
01:21:44,737 --> 01:21:47,287
Rizzo's got a bun in the oven.

1110
01:21:58,083 --> 01:22:00,083
Rizzo's knocked up.

1111
01:22:04,131 --> 01:22:06,200
Rizzo, I hear you're knocked up.

1112
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,870
You do?
Boy, good news really travels fast.

1113
01:22:10,387 --> 01:22:13,022
Why didn't ya tell me about it?

1114
01:22:13,098 --> 01:22:14,750
What's it to ya?

1115
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:19,015
I might be able to do something.
- You did enough.

1116
01:22:19,772 --> 01:22:22,856
I don't run away from my mistakes.

1117
01:22:22,983 --> 01:22:28,253
Don't worry about it, Kenickie.
It was somebody else's mistake.

1118
01:22:32,701 --> 01:22:34,701
Thanks a lot, kid.

1119
01:22:35,496 --> 01:22:37,496
Any time.

1120
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:45,406
(Sneezes)
- Are you getting a cold?

1121
01:22:45,506 --> 01:22:50,168
No. It's probably
a little drive-in dust, that's all.

1122
01:23:02,523 --> 01:23:04,895
Danny.
- Sandy. Oh, Sandy...

1123
01:23:05,025 --> 01:23:07,094
Danny, what are you doing?

1124
01:23:07,194 --> 01:23:09,388
Don't worry, nobody's watchin'.

1125
01:23:09,488 --> 01:23:13,483
Get off me.
- Sandy, what's the matter with you?

1126
01:23:13,867 --> 01:23:16,687
I thought I meant something to you.

1127
01:23:16,787 --> 01:23:22,822
Think I'm gonna stay with you in this
sin-wagon? Take this piece of tin.

1128
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,360
Sandy, you can't walk out of a drive-in.

1129
01:23:35,681 --> 01:23:38,146
 Stranded at the drive-in...

1130
01:23:39,435 --> 01:23:42,720
... Branded a fool...

1131
01:23:43,605 --> 01:23:46,061
... What will they say...

1132
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:50,230
... Monday at school?

1133
01:23:57,786 --> 01:23:59,826
 Sandy...

1134
01:23:59,955 --> 01:24:02,031
... Can't you see...

1135
01:24:02,166 --> 01:24:04,870
... I'm in misery?

1136
01:24:06,337 --> 01:24:08,376
 We made a start...

1137
01:24:08,505 --> 01:24:10,664
... Now we're apart...

1138
01:24:10,799 --> 01:24:14,003
... There's nothing left for me...

1139
01:24:15,304 --> 01:24:17,343
... Love has flown...

1140
01:24:17,473 --> 01:24:19,473
... All alone...

1141
01:24:19,475 --> 01:24:23,603
... I sit and wonder why-aye-aye...

1142
01:24:23,729 --> 01:24:27,145
... Why you left me...

1143
01:24:28,233 --> 01:24:30,233
... Oh, Sandy...

1144
01:24:31,445 --> 01:24:33,817
... Oh, Sandy...

1145
01:24:33,947 --> 01:24:36,024
... Maybe...

1146
01:24:36,158 --> 01:24:37,935
... Someday...

1147
01:24:38,035 --> 01:24:41,155
... When high school is done...

1148
01:24:42,665 --> 01:24:46,116
... Somehow, some way...

1149
01:24:46,877 --> 01:24:50,163
... Our two worlds will be one...

1150
01:24:51,382 --> 01:24:53,382
... In heaven...

1151
01:24:53,467 --> 01:24:55,507
... Forever...

1152
01:24:55,636 --> 01:24:59,052
... And ever we will be...

1153
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:03,426
... Please, say you'll stay...

1154
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,762
... Oh, Sandy

1155
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:12,724
Sandy, my darling,

1156
01:25:12,861 --> 01:25:14,901
you hurt me real bad.

1157
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:18,029
You know it's true.

1158
01:25:18,784 --> 01:25:22,524
But, baby, you gotta believe me
when I say...

1159
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:25,960
...l'm helpless without you.

1160
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,576
 Love has flown...

1161
01:25:28,711 --> 01:25:30,571
... All alone...

1162
01:25:30,671 --> 01:25:34,716
... I sit, I wonder why-aye-aye...

1163
01:25:34,842 --> 01:25:38,674
... Why you left me...

1164
01:25:39,555 --> 01:25:42,010
... Oh, Sandy...

1165
01:25:44,143 --> 01:25:46,182
... Sandy...

1166
01:25:48,605 --> 01:25:50,764
... Sandy...

1167
01:25:55,195 --> 01:25:58,896
... Why-aye-aye-aye?

1168
01:26:00,617 --> 01:26:02,617
Oh, Sandy.

1169
01:26:07,166 --> 01:26:09,461
Head it out. Come on, guys.

1170
01:26:16,258 --> 01:26:18,468
Well, the crate shaped up.

1171
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:21,872
It's as hot as the parts on it.
- We didn't steal all of it.

1172
01:26:21,972 --> 01:26:25,626
Some of it was donated.
- Just wait till Thunder Road.

1173
01:26:25,726 --> 01:26:28,337
Right. You could still change your mind.

1174
01:26:28,437 --> 01:26:32,132
The flag is in three hours.
- And Greased Lightning strikes.

1175
01:26:32,232 --> 01:26:35,094
You coming?
- My boys won't let me down,

1176
01:26:35,194 --> 01:26:37,404
and I won't let them down.

1177
01:26:39,698 --> 01:26:41,857
I wanna talk to you.

1178
01:26:44,078 --> 01:26:48,668
Those guys at Thunder Road
don't fool around, you know.

1179
01:26:48,999 --> 01:26:51,039
You want me to punk out?

1180
01:26:51,085 --> 01:26:54,655
No, I'm not saying punking out,
I'm just...

1181
01:26:55,255 --> 01:26:57,295
You know what I mean.

1182
01:26:58,676 --> 01:27:00,834
Hey, Danny, erm...

1183
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:03,706
We been friends a long time, right?

1184
01:27:03,806 --> 01:27:05,806
Yeah.

1185
01:27:06,517 --> 01:27:09,336
You remember the drive-in the other night?

1186
01:27:09,436 --> 01:27:12,965
The movie with the duel,
the guy's best friend went with him...

1187
01:27:13,065 --> 01:27:15,217
...as his lieutenant, his second?

1188
01:27:15,317 --> 01:27:17,317
Yeah. So?

1189
01:27:19,238 --> 01:27:24,351
Well, I thought that... you could
maybe be my second at Thunder Road.

1190
01:27:24,451 --> 01:27:28,106
What, you want me
to drive with you or what?

1191
01:27:38,924 --> 01:27:42,494
Listen, I'll pick you up at three,
alright?

1192
01:27:42,594 --> 01:27:46,123
Open up the door.
What are you sitting around for?

1193
01:27:46,223 --> 01:27:50,218
Take the can off
the front of the car, you putz.

1194
01:27:55,733 --> 01:27:58,427
Hello, Rizz.
Are you going to Thunder Road?

1195
01:27:58,527 --> 01:27:59,887
Not a chance.

1196
01:27:59,987 --> 01:28:02,181
I have to go.
I have to talk to Danny.

1197
01:28:02,281 --> 01:28:05,643
Without wheels and a motor,
he won't know you're alive.

1198
01:28:05,743 --> 01:28:09,480
We haven't been friends,
but if there's anything I can do...

1199
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:14,485
I can take care of myself.
And anybody else who comes along.

1200
01:28:14,585 --> 01:28:17,947
You think I don't know
what people are saying about me?

1201
01:28:18,047 --> 01:28:20,047
Hey.

1202
01:28:23,469 --> 01:28:25,469
Thanks.

1203
01:28:35,147 --> 01:28:38,462
That's the one I was telling you about.

1204
01:28:39,735 --> 01:28:43,021
 There are worse things I could do...

1205
01:28:43,906 --> 01:28:47,405
... Than go with a boy or two...

1206
01:28:48,702 --> 01:28:50,896
... Even though the neighbourhood...

1207
01:28:50,996 --> 01:28:54,163
... Thinks I'm trashy and no good...

1208
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:58,043
... I suppose it could be true...

1209
01:28:58,712 --> 01:29:02,537
... But there are worse things I could do...

1210
01:29:03,092 --> 01:29:08,050
... I could flirt with all the guys...

1211
01:29:10,683 --> 01:29:15,345
... Smile at them and bat my eyes...

1212
01:29:17,898 --> 01:29:21,516
... Press against them when we dance...

1213
01:29:21,652 --> 01:29:25,097
... Make them think they stand a chance...

1214
01:29:25,197 --> 01:29:28,483
... Then refuse to see it through...

1215
01:29:29,785 --> 01:29:32,760
... That's a thing I'd never do...

1216
01:29:32,913 --> 01:29:38,073
... I could stay home every night...

1217
01:29:39,586 --> 01:29:43,916
... Wait around for Mr Right...

1218
01:29:46,677 --> 01:29:50,093
... Take cold showers every day...

1219
01:29:50,222 --> 01:29:53,093
... And throw my life away...

1220
01:29:53,767 --> 01:29:57,082
... On a dream that won't come true...

1221
01:29:58,981 --> 01:30:04,141
... I could hurt someone like me...

1222
01:30:06,697 --> 01:30:12,071
... Out of spite or jealousy...

1223
01:30:13,787 --> 01:30:17,073
... I don't steal and I don't lie...

1224
01:30:17,207 --> 01:30:20,541
... But I can feel and I can cry...

1225
01:30:20,669 --> 01:30:24,797
... A fact I'll bet you never knew...

1226
01:30:28,385 --> 01:30:32,928
... But to cry in front of you...

1227
01:30:35,267 --> 01:30:37,936
... That's the worst thing...

1228
01:30:38,062 --> 01:30:42,106
... I could do...

1229
01:31:26,944 --> 01:31:30,180
You guys think you got a winner?
- That's right.

1230
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:33,392
Takes more than a coat of paint
on Thunder Road.

1231
01:31:33,492 --> 01:31:36,645
Oh, yeah?
- Not thinking of changing your mind?

1232
01:31:36,745 --> 01:31:39,607
No way.
- Good. Cos we're racing for pinks.

1233
01:31:39,707 --> 01:31:41,233
Pinks?

1234
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:44,818
Pinks, punk.
Pink slips. Ownership papers.

1235
01:31:47,756 --> 01:31:51,071
Stop. Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

1236
01:31:52,011 --> 01:31:54,050
Hey, get the dude, man.

1237
01:32:00,269 --> 01:32:05,061
What did she give him?
- A lock of hair. From her chest.

1238
01:32:07,568 --> 01:32:09,568
Poor Kenickie.

1239
01:32:11,905 --> 01:32:16,101
See a penny, pick it up,
all day long you'll have good luck.

1240
01:32:16,201 --> 01:32:18,201
Gimme that.

1241
01:32:20,664 --> 01:32:23,484
If it were in any better condition,
it would fly.

1242
01:32:23,584 --> 01:32:27,747
She's gonna.
- I brought you this for good luck.

1243
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,240
Gee, thanks.

1244
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:31,380
I'm sorry.
- I'll get it.

1245
01:32:36,930 --> 01:32:38,930
You putz.

1246
01:32:40,184 --> 01:32:42,224
Put this under his head.

1247
01:32:43,145 --> 01:32:46,340
Zuko, he's out cold.
- What are we gonna do?

1248
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:49,524
Kenickie. Talk to me, buddy.

1249
01:32:50,069 --> 01:32:52,069
You OK?

1250
01:32:52,696 --> 01:32:54,938
Yeah. I'm OK.

1251
01:32:55,074 --> 01:32:56,850
I'm fine. (Groans)...

1252
01:32:56,950 --> 01:33:00,396
You can't drive.
- No, really, I'm alright.

1253
01:33:00,496 --> 01:33:03,216
I'm just seeing two of you, man.

1254
01:33:04,166 --> 01:33:07,867
Hey, you want me to drive for you?
- Huh?

1255
01:33:08,003 --> 01:33:10,494
Yeah. Yeah.

1256
01:33:11,256 --> 01:33:13,256
Alright. Help him up.

1257
01:33:13,676 --> 01:33:16,083
Marty, give me a hand.

1258
01:33:22,184 --> 01:33:24,592
(Car engines start)

1259
01:33:30,943 --> 01:33:32,636
Hey.

1260
01:33:32,736 --> 01:33:34,972
The rules are, there ain't no rules.

1261
01:33:35,072 --> 01:33:39,322
To the second bridge and back.
First one back wins.

1262
01:33:39,702 --> 01:33:41,702
Haul ass, kid.

1263
01:34:01,098 --> 01:34:04,328
You ain't gonna see me for dust, Zuko.

1264
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:38,300
Come on, baby.

1265
01:36:25,826 --> 01:36:29,688
 For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow...

1266
01:36:29,788 --> 01:36:34,633
... For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny...

1267
01:36:35,836 --> 01:36:38,505
... Look at me...

1268
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:41,631
... There has to be...

1269
01:36:42,176 --> 01:36:44,176
... Something more...

1270
01:36:44,261 --> 01:36:47,048
... Than what they see...

1271
01:36:47,723 --> 01:36:50,296
... Wholesome and pure...

1272
01:36:50,434 --> 01:36:53,969
... Oh, so scared and unsure...

1273
01:36:54,104 --> 01:36:58,850
... A poor man's Sandra Dee

1274
01:36:58,984 --> 01:37:00,344
Danny won.

1275
01:37:00,444 --> 01:37:02,900
Isn't that great?
- Yeah.

1276
01:37:05,032 --> 01:37:07,601
What's the matter? Aren't you happy?

1277
01:37:07,701 --> 01:37:12,231
Not really. But I think I know a way
I could be. Could you help me?

1278
01:37:12,331 --> 01:37:14,525
Of course.
- Can I come to your place?

1279
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:16,625
Sure. Come on.

1280
01:37:20,881 --> 01:37:25,839
 Sandy, you must start anew...

1281
01:37:26,595 --> 01:37:30,972
... Don't you know what you must do?

1282
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:33,341
 Hold your head high...

1283
01:37:33,477 --> 01:37:37,897
... Take a deep breath and sigh...
- Come on, Sandy.

1284
01:37:37,982 --> 01:37:39,982
 Goodbye...

1285
01:37:40,109 --> 01:37:46,277
... To Sandra Dee

1286
01:38:02,256 --> 01:38:03,824
Attention, seniors.

1287
01:38:03,924 --> 01:38:07,077
Before the merriment
of commencement commences,

1288
01:38:07,177 --> 01:38:10,414
I hope your years with us here
at Rydell High...

1289
01:38:10,514 --> 01:38:13,626
...have prepared you
for the challenges you face.

1290
01:38:13,726 --> 01:38:18,380
Who knows, among you, there may be
a future Eleanor Roosevelt,

1291
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:20,888
or a Rosemary Clooney.

1292
01:38:21,025 --> 01:38:23,385
And among you young men,
there may be...

1293
01:38:23,485 --> 01:38:26,847
...a Joe DiMaggio,
a President Eisenhower...

1294
01:38:26,947 --> 01:38:29,837
...or even a Vice President Nixon.

1295
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:35,022
But always you will have
the glorious memories of Rydell High.

1296
01:38:35,122 --> 01:38:38,039
Rydell forever. Bon voyage.

1297
01:38:39,084 --> 01:38:41,243
(Chimes)

1298
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:47,163
Oh, Blanche, stop blubbering.

1299
01:38:52,181 --> 01:38:54,181
(Cheering)...

1300
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:31,052
How many?
- One.

1301
01:39:32,262 --> 01:39:34,262
(Bell rings)

1302
01:39:35,599 --> 01:39:38,294
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

1303
01:39:38,394 --> 01:39:39,962
How did I flunk phys ed?

1304
01:39:40,062 --> 01:39:42,062
Did I take phys ed?

1305
01:39:43,273 --> 01:39:46,760
Step right up here.
It's for a wonderful cause.

1306
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:51,432
The Teachers' Retirement Fund.
Give 'em a pie in the puss.

1307
01:39:51,532 --> 01:39:53,809
Coach, how could you flunk the T-Birds?

1308
01:39:53,909 --> 01:39:57,897
Don't worry. You'll get diplomas.
Just come back to summer school.

1309
01:39:57,997 --> 01:40:00,452
Summer school?
- Look out.

1310
01:40:03,127 --> 01:40:06,155
If you'd come to class,
you wouldn't have missed me.

1311
01:40:06,255 --> 01:40:08,975
Wise guy, huh? Take that, Coach.

1312
01:40:10,634 --> 01:40:13,609
Why, you couldn't pitch one inning.

1313
01:40:17,891 --> 01:40:20,169
What's your name? I want you.
- Eugene.

1314
01:40:20,269 --> 01:40:23,244
You're a great pitcher.
- Thank you.

1315
01:40:32,531 --> 01:40:35,532
Rizzo. Rizzo.

1316
01:40:35,659 --> 01:40:38,103
Get off of that. You got a condition.

1317
01:40:38,203 --> 01:40:42,066
Forget it. It was a false alarm.
I'm not pregnant.

1318
01:40:42,166 --> 01:40:44,166
Whoo-hooo.

1319
01:40:47,087 --> 01:40:49,949
I'll, erm,
make an honest woman of you.

1320
01:40:50,049 --> 01:40:54,129
Listen, fella, if this is a line,
I ain't biting.

1321
01:40:54,219 --> 01:40:55,996
That's a bona fide offer.

1322
01:40:56,096 --> 01:40:59,581
Well, it ain't moonlight and roses,
but...

1323
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:10,850
Hey, there's Zuko.
- You gotta be kidding, man.

1324
01:41:12,988 --> 01:41:16,559
What is this? Halloween?
- Where did you swipe the sweater?

1325
01:41:16,659 --> 01:41:20,479
While you tools were out stealing
hubcaps, I lettered in track.

1326
01:41:20,579 --> 01:41:23,315
I can't believe it.
Danny Zuko turned jock?

1327
01:41:23,415 --> 01:41:26,652
That's right, I did.
- What you doing? Deserting us?

1328
01:41:26,752 --> 01:41:30,406
You guys can't follow a leader all your lives.

1329
01:41:30,506 --> 01:41:34,034
Come on, you know you mean
a lot to me, but Sandy does, too.

1330
01:41:34,134 --> 01:41:37,449
I'm gonna do anything I can to get her.

1331
01:41:40,891 --> 01:41:42,967
(Wolf whistles)

1332
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:50,440
Sandy?

1333
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,436
Tell me about it, stud.

1334
01:42:01,578 --> 01:42:03,578
 I got chills...

1335
01:42:03,664 --> 01:42:05,704
... They're multiplyin'

1336
01:42:05,958 --> 01:42:10,419
 And I'm losing control...

1337
01:42:10,546 --> 01:42:12,585
... Cos the power...

1338
01:42:12,715 --> 01:42:14,715
... You're supplyin'

1339
01:42:14,842 --> 01:42:17,249
 It's electrifyin'

1340
01:42:23,976 --> 01:42:26,016
 You better shape up...

1341
01:42:26,395 --> 01:42:28,637
... Cos I need a man...

1342
01:42:29,606 --> 01:42:32,496
... And my heart is set on you...

1343
01:42:33,068 --> 01:42:35,262
... You better shape up...

1344
01:42:35,362 --> 01:42:37,827
... You better understand...

1345
01:42:38,699 --> 01:42:40,893
... To my heart I must be true...

1346
01:42:40,993 --> 01:42:44,521
... Nothin' left,
nothin' left for me to do...

1347
01:42:44,621 --> 01:42:47,274
... You're the one that I want
-  You are the one I want...

1348
01:42:47,374 --> 01:42:49,193
... Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey...

1349
01:42:49,293 --> 01:42:51,612
... The one that I want

1350
01:42:51,712 --> 01:42:53,822

01:42:53,922 --> 01:42:56,408
... The one that I want

1352
01:42:56,508 --> 01:42:57,743
... Ooh, ooh, ooh...

1353
01:42:57,843 --> 01:42:59,843
... The one I need...

1354
01:42:59,845 --> 01:43:02,134
... Oh, yes indeed...

1355
01:43:07,061 --> 01:43:11,308
... If you're filled with affection...

1356
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:15,687
... You're too shy to convey...

1357
01:43:15,819 --> 01:43:20,362
... Meditate in my direction...

1358
01:43:21,116 --> 01:43:23,488
... Feel your way
- Wow.

1359
01:43:24,995 --> 01:43:27,035
 I better shape up...

1360
01:43:27,164 --> 01:43:30,609
... Cos you need a man
-  I need a man...

1361
01:43:30,709 --> 01:43:33,514
... Who can keep me satisfied...

1362
01:43:33,962 --> 01:43:36,335
... I better shape up...

1363
01:43:36,465 --> 01:43:39,577
... If I'm gonna prove
-  You better prove...

1364
01:43:39,677 --> 01:43:41,996
... That my faith is justified...

1365
01:43:42,096 --> 01:43:45,666
... Are you sure?
-  Yes, I'm sure down deep inside...

1366
01:43:45,766 --> 01:43:48,502
... You're the one that I want
-  You are the one I want...

1367
01:43:48,602 --> 01:43:50,296
... Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey...

1371
01:43:57,403 --> 01:43:58,929
... Ooh, ooh, ooh...

01:43:59,029 --> 01:44:00,639
... The one I need...

1373
01:44:00,739 --> 01:44:02,739
... Oh, yes indeed...

1374
01:44:03,575 --> 01:44:06,270
... You're the one that I want
-  You are the one I want...

1375
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:08,272

...(bell rings)

1399
01:45:00,507 --> 01:45:03,494
Hey, everybody.
Rizzo and Kenickie made up.

1400
01:45:03,594 --> 01:45:06,049
Alright.

Look. The gang's together.

1402
01:45:07,973 --> 01:45:10,125
What will we do after graduation?

1403
01:45:10,225 --> 01:45:12,836
Maybe we'll never see each other.

1404
01:45:12,936 --> 01:45:15,214
That won't happen.

1421
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:07,141

1422
01:46:07,241 --> 01:46:09,226
... And stars are shining bright...

1423

 We take the pressure
and we throw away...

1458
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:37,240

1459
01:49:37,576 --> 01:49:40,067

01:50:19,076 --> 01:50:20,436
 Grease is the word

1475
01:50:20,536 --> 01:50:23,001
 Is the word, is the word...
