Nothing more than
a feathery spring roll.

1304
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:24,956
Watching them up there

1305
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,293
makes you want to chase them
and grab them in your mouth

1306
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,670
and bite their
heads off, huh?

Blu, what's wrong?

1315
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:11,127
Nothing.
Everything is perfect.

1316
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,754
You'll be off

What? That you'd
come to Minnesota?

1322
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,267
Great, l guess
I値l knit you a scarf.

1323
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,686
No, that's not
what l meant.

1324
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,855
Look, Jewel,

You know what?
This is good.
Just clear the air.

1330
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,121
Just be completely honest
with each other.

1331
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:48,915
You want honesty?
Fine, l can be honest.

1332
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,125
l don't belong here.

1333
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:53,002
In fact, l never

You belong together!
You are Juliet to his Romeo!

Young love.
Always so melodramatic.

1352
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,919
All right, boys,

1353
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:39,090

the wrong direction.

my family much more.

With big ninja talons!

1391

This cockatoo was ugly!
Anyway, that's not the point.

1392
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:15,436
And then Jewel was there,
and he snatched Jewel up.

1393
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:16,938
Like, he snatched her up.
And then he was like,

"You're coming with me,
you little princess."

1395

"l ain't your princess,
leave me alone."

And l was like, "What?"
Then he was like, "What?"

Stop! Just tell me
what happened.
