When I sang my solo,

9
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:26,529
I felt, like, a really palpable
connection with the audience.

10

And-and I know that it was,
like, a bummer my mom didn't show,

11
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:33,603
but in that moment, it was
like everyone was my mom.

12
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:35,238
You know?

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,906
(scoffs) Ugh, whatever, she's just pissed

14
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:39,575
because I didn't do the
mock-trial summer intensive.

15
00:00:39,577 --> 00:00:41,244
Ugh, she wasn't even gonna let me go here,

16
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:43,579
but then I called my dad on
his honeymoon in the Bahamas,

17
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:45,281
and I told him I was
having suicidal thoughts,

18
00:00:45,283 --> 00:00:46,782
so, ta-da, here I am.

00:00:51,656 --> 00:00:55,691
Josh, session B has been a whirlwind,

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,403
and you've been my rock.

22
00:00:57,921 --> 00:01:01,197
You've awakened my sexual
being for the first time.

23
00:01:01,593 --> 00:01:04,734
I never knew that two
people could be so connected.

24
00:01:05,204 --> 00:01:07,404
This has been the best summer of my life,

25
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:10,374
and you're the reason why.

26
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:12,384
Okay, let's talk schedules.

27
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:13,642
So I'll visit at Christmas,
and then I think...

28
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:16,217
- WOMAN: Josh, you ready?
- Um, my mom and dad are here.

29
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:18,568
Ugh, my mom is laz', per the us'.

31
00:01:19,684 --> 00:01:21,851
Um, this-this has been a great summer...

32
00:01:21,853 --> 00:01:23,586
It has been the best summer. Yeah.

33
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:24,754
But, uh...

34
00:01:24,756 --> 00:01:27,223

00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:28,190
Ugh, grande dame arrives.

36
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:29,639
Okay, I'll be right there, Mother!

37
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:31,160
I'm sorry, you were saying?

38
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:34,039
Well, with school and baseball, uh...

39
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,932
What?

40
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:37,010
- Wh-What? 
- (car honks)

41
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,632
Good God, Mother. Are 
you trying to kill me?!

42
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:40,881
Uh... What?

43
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:43,606
I-I just think that we're
just really different,

44

you know, um, like, you're,
like, really dramatic

45
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:51,948

46
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:53,582
I don't know.

47
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:55,484
I-I think maybe we should take a break.

48

No, no... (stammers)

49
00:01:57,522 --> 00:01:58,988

Uh, bye, Rebecca.

- I'll-I'll see you around. 
- No, no, but...

00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,259
No.

56
00:02:09,284 --> 00:02:10,000
What?

57
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:11,357
No, I'm not dramatic.

MOTHER: Damn it, Rebecca, is
that a hickey on your neck?

63
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:38,661
Okay, look, keep in mind,

64
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:40,570
anything happens, we go
right to the abortionist.

Your future is all that matters.

70
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,946
So did you win the Corcoran case?

71
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,932
You want that promotion, don't you?

72
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:56,156
It's very important.

73

I've said that a million times.

Eh, I guess you don't care what I think.

Spread it, indulge.

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,195
Yeah, the last eight months.

167
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,093
Dude, we should... we should hang out.

168

- Yeah.

169
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:38,431
Actually, I'm moving.

Oh, moving.

171
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:45,104
Yeah, I've been trying to make
it work here in the Big Apple,

172
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:46,806
and one day I realized,

173
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:48,226
why get stuck in a rat race?

174
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:49,876
I mean, what's the point, right?

175
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:51,811
And it's so awesome back home.

I hope you don't mind,

00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,312
but I handed out copies of your résumé.

341
00:14:54,337 --> 00:14:56,057
I mean, we are just so honored

342
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:58,465
and, well, confused, frankly,

343
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,029
to have an attorney of your caliber here.

344
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:03,019
- So... Darryl Whitefeather. 
- Hmm.

345
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:04,677
That's a really interesting name.

346
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:07,312
Well, I'm what they
call a full one-eighth.

347
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:09,968
One-eighth Chippewa.

348
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:11,540
Oh.

349
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:12,953
Those are my people.

350
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:13,687
Wow.

351
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,045
Everybody here calls me “Chief”"

352
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,237
Okay. So I should address
you as “Chief”?

353
00:15:17,388 --> 00:15:18,487
I wish you'd get it started,

354
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,551
'cause nobody's really doing it...

355
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:20,776
- Okay, will do. 
- Thank you.

356
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:22,434
- Um, I have a question for you... Chief. 
- Mm-mm.

357
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,406
Uh, is there a problem

358
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:26,699
with cell phone service in West Covina?

359
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:29,525
Because I feel like my friend
is trying to get ahold of me

360
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:31,460
- Mm-hmm. 
- And nothing's coming through.

361
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:32,476
No, we don't have anything...

362
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:33,596
Well, I mean, I have Sprint,

363
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,343
- and it's “the bomb.” 
- Ah.

364
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,901
I'm sorry. I have a kid, so...

365
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:37,891
(laughs)

366
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:38,949
Oh, the b... yeah.

367
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,773
Yeah, but I'm getting a divorce.

368
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:41,640
Sorry.

369
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:43,572
Oh, I'm not.

370
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:46,137
Hey-o! Come on. Let me show you around.

371
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:48,657
So, uh, you're from New York.

372
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,415
You know, I spent some
time in Gotham myself.

373
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:51,968
- Yeah? 
- Oh, yeah.

374
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,650
Uh, for about a week after
college with my buddies.

375
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:56,132
We went to all the best places.

376
00:15:56,157 --> 00:15:58,724
Hey, do they still have
that great pizza place...

377
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,700
Oh, downtown...

378
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:01,890
What was the name of it?

379
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:02,925
D-something.

380
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:04,326
Gosh, have you heard of that one?

381
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:05,761
D...

382
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:07,229
Yeah. Uh-huh.

383
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:08,430
- Did you? 
- Oh, it's great.

384
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:09,598
Oh, it's so good.

385
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,333
And they fold it up and it's thin crust

386
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:12,750
and the sauce and
there's all the cheese.

387
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:13,686
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

388
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:14,977
That's pizza. Yeah.

389
00:16:15,002 --> 00:16:16,468
You know, actually, we
have some great places

390
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:17,659
right here in the Cove. Uh-huh.

391
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:18,683
You know, there's, uh...

392
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,208
a wine bar on Foothill

393
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:22,466
- that has a killer Riesling. 
- Uh-huh.

394
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:23,742
It's actually called
Jimmy's House of Spirits.

395
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:24,250
Uh-huh.

396
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,108
It's like a liquor store and a wine bar.

397
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:28,869
Also, in the restaurant in the Hilton,

398
00:16:28,894 --> 00:16:30,460
they have, um, something called branzino.

399
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:31,684
You ever heard of branzino?

400
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:33,008
Yes, I have.

401
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:35,491
- It's a fish. 
- I know.

402
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:36,765
- Really? 
- Yeah. Of course.

403
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,127
'Cause I thought it was a sandwich.

404
00:16:38,152 --> 00:16:39,251
Well, anyway, I'm just...

405
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:40,906
I'm so excited to be here

406
00:16:40,931 --> 00:16:42,564
and chillax

407
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,633
and just live that SoCal
sunny lifestyle, you know?

408
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:46,422
Well, we are two hours from the beach...

409
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:48,180
- Well, four in traffic. 
- So I hear.

410
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,340
I feel like you and I are
gonna have a lot in common.

411
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:53,093
And I'm not just talking
about the pizza and the fie.

412
00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:54,117
Mm-hmm.

413
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:55,074
Oh, you know what?

414
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:56,132
Until my business cards come in,

415
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:57,421
I'm gonna take a few of these,

416
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:59,925
in case anyone asks what I'm doing in town.

417
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,250
And I can show them this and be like,

418
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:02,751
“I have a job. It's legitimate”"

419
00:17:02,753 --> 00:17:03,835
(laughs nervously)

420
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,127
Okay. So this is the kitchen.

421
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,393
Did you see this résumé?

422
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:12,895
Harvard? Yale?

423
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:14,029
Special skills: Mandarin?

424
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:15,531
Did she get this out of a résumé book?

425
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:16,999
What the hell is she doing here?

426
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:17,750
(exhales)

427
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:19,783
Exactly. It makes no sense.

428
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:22,312
Uh, Rebecca, this is Paula.

429
00:17:22,337 --> 00:17:23,470
Oh, hi!

430
00:17:23,495 --> 00:17:24,673
Are you my assistant? Great.

431
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:25,941
I am going to need so much help

432
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:26,942
setting up my computer.

433
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:28,177
I'm, like, a total grandma.

434
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,828
Uh, actually, Paula is
our, um, head paralegal.

435
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:33,386
Oh! (scoffs) Hello.

436
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:34,944
Sorry. Hi. Hi.

437
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,535
- Nice to meet you. 
- Yeah.

438
00:17:36,945 --> 00:17:39,154
Two years of training,
six months of night school

439
00:17:39,156 --> 00:17:40,867
and 15 years of experience, but...

440
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:42,624
Never mind.

441
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:45,718
Those are some great knock-off Louboutins.

442
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:49,431
Yeah. I know how to say it.

443
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:51,710
Uh, actually, they are real.

444
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:53,296
But I got them on sale.

445
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:54,929
Lindsay Lohan wears those.

446
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:56,478
She's been to jail six
times and has fake hair.

447
00:17:56,503 --> 00:17:57,562
Did you know that?

448
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:59,476
Everyone knows that, right, Mrs. Hernandez?

449
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:01,453
Oh, I'm sorry. That's Mrs. Hernandez.

450
00:18:01,478 --> 00:18:02,632
She's our communications director.

451
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:04,123
Oh, great! Hi!

452
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:05,484
So nice to meet you.

453
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:06,508
Wow!

454
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:07,932
- Oh. 
- (laughs) Careful, there.

455
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:09,842
She went to a “women
in business” seminar

456
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:11,720
a couple of years ago, came
back with that death grip.

457
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:15,171
So what, uh, brings you
to our lovely West Covina?

458
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:18,093
Just looking for change.

459
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:18,929
You know?

460
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:20,721
Yeah? No friends in town?

461
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:23,109
- A relative, or... ?
- Uh... no.

462
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:24,700
No.

463
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,968
Okay.

464
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:27,046
- Yeah, yeah. 
- Okay.

465
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:27,903
Okay.

466
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:28,937
- Pretty-pretty simple. 
- (laughs)

467
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:29,938
Here to start fresh.

468
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,473
Well, yes, well, welcome aboard.

469
00:18:31,475 --> 00:18:32,574
Well, thank you, so much.

470
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:33,445
And sorry about the mix-up, again.

471
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,488
- No worries. 
- No, no.

472
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:36,979
- Total... fart brain.
- Not a problem.

473
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:38,046
Super happy you're here.

474
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:40,015
Like, senior year graduation excited!

475
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:41,445
(whoops) Yeah, yeah.

476
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:45,698
(sneering voice): “They're
real. Got them on sale.”

477
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,851
Who is this person?

478
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:56,630
Wow.

479
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:58,667
I, uh...

480
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:00,124
love all the wolf imagery.

481
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:02,604
Yeah, I went to a swap meet in Gardena

482
00:19:02,606 --> 00:19:03,710
and got all this.

483
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:06,069
I keep the pelts at home
because they shed a little bit.

484
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:08,010
Uh-huh.

485
00:19:08,012 --> 00:19:10,846
- Okay... 
- Look, I wasn't going to...

486
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:12,815
talk about this out there, because, well,

487
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,593
I mean, you know how offices

488
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:15,703
can be, you know.

489
00:19:15,728 --> 00:19:16,693
It can be very gossipy.

490
00:19:16,718 --> 00:19:18,418
But I'm in the middle of a divorce.

491
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:20,304
Right. Yeah, you mentioned that.

492
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:21,390
And my wife, well,

493
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:23,171
she's got a very powerful pit bull lawyer.

494
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,729
I mean, this guy's amazing.

495
00:19:24,754 --> 00:19:26,687
One of those real smart Jewish guys.

496
00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:29,382
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm... I'm Jewish.

497
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:30,381
Really?

498
00:19:30,406 --> 00:19:31,593
Yeah, but it's okay.

499
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:33,384
I... I honestly had no idea.

500
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:34,842
That is a tiny nose.

501
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:35,866
It's like a button.

502
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:37,718
Thank you.

503
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,910
Look... (sighs)

504
00:19:40,455 --> 00:19:42,555
(crying): I'm sorry.

505
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:43,925
It's just that...

506
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:45,710
I'm in kind of a bind here.

507
00:19:46,196 --> 00:19:47,295
(sobbing): Oh, geez.

508
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,937
Oh, I didn't want to do this.

509
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,304
Um... (sobbing)

510
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:56,717
Oh... Um...

511
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:58,382
(sobbing)

512
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,274
I like the wolf with the bandana.

513
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:02,476
That's my favorite, too.

514
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:07,035
I just can't lose her.

515
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:08,370
I can't lose her.

516
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:10,572
Darryl, uh...

517
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:12,441
You know, there's other fish in the sea.

518
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:13,414
Right?

519
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,806
It's not healthy to keep
fixating on one person.

520
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:16,864
The relationship's over...

521
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:18,455
I am not talking about my wife.

522
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,979
I am talking about my daughter.

523
00:20:20,004 --> 00:20:21,304
My ex-wife is trying

524
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,804
- to get Madison away from me. 
- Huh?

525
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:26,688
I want you to represent me in my case.

526
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,557
- Oh... 
- No, you're right.

527
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,525
I'm sorry. I...

528
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:30,593
This is so inappropriate.

529
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:32,118
Oh, Jiminy Christmas.

530
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:34,143
- I don't know what I'm doing. 
- Uh, look, Darryl,

531
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,565
I'm very flattered that-that
you asked me to represent you,

532
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:38,000
but you know my
specialty's real estate law.

533
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:39,334
I wouldn't be qualified...

534
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:41,257
I know, but I just want
to see my wife's face.

535
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:42,488
I mean, her Jew

536
00:20:42,513 --> 00:20:43,976
went to CSU Long Beach.

537
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,408
My Jew? Harvard and Yale.

538
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,687
Mmm?

539
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,709
Can I think about it?

540
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,307
I will think about it, sincerely,

541
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,499
because I see that
you're a really good dad.

542
00:20:52,524 --> 00:20:53,923
But you know, that's why
I moved to West Covina,

543
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:56,348
to be with families who care.

544
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,130
And I care, too.

545
00:20:58,155 --> 00:21:00,617
And I promise that I will
always be there for you.

546
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:02,142
(phone chimes) Hold on one second.

547
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,031
_

548
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,529
But right now, I got a thing.

549
00:21:05,554 --> 00:21:07,462
I'm gonna go do this thing.

550
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:09,298
Doesn't mean that I don't care,
I'm just gonna go do the thing.

551
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,398
I will come back later...

552
00:21:10,423 --> 00:21:12,756
and let's circle back about the Jew thing.

553
00:21:12,781 --> 00:21:15,215
'Cause that's a conversation
that we need to have.

554
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:19,828
The Jew thing?

555
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,423
Why did I say that?

556
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,142
♪ ♪

557
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:37,012
ANNOUNCER: curve-balling out
about five to ten miles per hour.

558
00:21:37,014 --> 00:21:39,714
Jerry Murdoch steps in against Patterson.

559
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:43,451
He hit two home runs in the second inning,

560
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:47,055
but down three now, here
in the bottom of the fifth.

561
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:49,531
Are you lost?

562
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:51,256
The wine bar's over on Foothill.

563
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:53,395
I'm just here for some baseball.

564
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:54,429
Sounds good.

565
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:55,463
What can I get you?

566
00:21:55,465 --> 00:21:56,798
Beer, please.

567
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,199
Any kind.

568
00:22:00,837 --> 00:22:02,537
You from around here?

569
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:04,132
Never seen you before.

570
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,726
I actually just moved
to town from New York.

571
00:22:05,751 --> 00:22:06,717
Seriously?

572
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:09,245
I love New York.
What-what brings you here?

573
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,137
Work and, um...

574
00:22:11,483 --> 00:22:14,437
I-I'm actually here because
I'm meeting a friend.

575
00:22:14,462 --> 00:22:16,362
But I don't...

576
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,414
I don't see him.

577
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:19,905
Great. Maybe I know him.

578
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,196
Is he eight years old? Or an alcoholic?

579
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:22,854
'Cause that's what we've got here.

580
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:25,906
You're a good listener.

581
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:27,731
- Hmm? 
- Exactly.

582
00:22:27,831 --> 00:22:29,364
You know, a buddy of mine
just moved back from New York.

583
00:22:29,366 --> 00:22:30,665
Guy I grew up with.

584
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:31,891
- Really? 
- Yeah.

585
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:33,007
But there's no way you know him, right?

586
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:33,965
It's a big city.

587
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,189
I might. What's his name?

588
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:37,215
Josh Chan.

589
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:39,421
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

590
00:22:39,446 --> 00:22:41,313
That's crazy! I... I know him!

591
00:22:41,338 --> 00:22:42,870
- Seriously? 
- Yeah. Yeah.

592
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,795
That's crazy. He was just here.

593
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:46,081
You just missed him.

594
00:22:46,106 --> 00:22:47,271
That... that's his beer.

595
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:48,710
Ah!

596
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,703
Mmm!

597
00:22:50,987 --> 00:22:51,953
(laughs)

598
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:52,954
Um, yeah.

599
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,055
Oh, mmm...

600
00:22:54,057 --> 00:22:56,601
Um, it's actually such a funny s-story.

601
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:57,890
So, I was in New York,

602
00:22:57,915 --> 00:22:59,548
but I was looking to
relocate to Los Angeles

603
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,202
because I'm just, I'm a beach gal.

604
00:23:01,431 --> 00:23:03,304
Uh, so I run into Chan and he tells me

605
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:04,507
how great West Covina is.

606
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:05,694
And I'm like, okay, filing
it away, filing it away.

607
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:06,890
But then, boom!

608
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:08,248
That same day, I get this rando call

609
00:23:08,273 --> 00:23:09,272
from a one-eighth Chippewa

610
00:23:09,297 --> 00:23:10,629
who's very prominent in my field,

611
00:23:10,861 --> 00:23:13,128
asking me to start a position here.

612
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,853
Crazy, right?

613
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:16,304
Wait.

614
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:17,428
So you left a job in New York

615
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:18,585
to live near the beach?

616
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,743
We're four hours from the beach.

617
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:21,134
People say two, but those people are dumb.

618
00:23:21,195 --> 00:23:23,495
Yeah, but, like, you know,
it's such a great place.

619
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,020
- I mean, the motto is “Live, Work, Play.” 
- We have a motto?

620
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:27,889
- Yes, on the Web site. 
- We have a Web site?

621
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:30,007
It takes a few minutes to
load, but it's very informative.

622
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:31,960
This is where I live.

623
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:32,882
Yay for me.

624
00:23:32,907 --> 00:23:34,841
So, anyway, to go back to my, um, story.

625
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:36,341
- Please do. 
- So I got here

626
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:37,699
and I reached out to Josh, but...

627
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:39,134
he hasn't gotten back to me,

628
00:23:39,136 --> 00:23:40,835
so I don't if he-he dropped
his phone in the toilet,

629
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:41,903
'cause I did that once

630
00:23:41,905 --> 00:23:43,071
and I was out of commission for hours.

631
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:44,706
So maybe he did that.

632
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:45,807
Do you know where he went, though?

633
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:47,442
- 'Cause I'd love to, like... 
- No.

634
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:48,810
No idea. He said he was going out,

635
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:50,101
but he didn't say where.

636
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:51,992
Okay. Thanks.

637
00:23:53,464 --> 00:23:56,046
But I, uh... it's funny.

638
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:57,619
I do know where he's
gonna be tomorrow night.

639
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:58,164
Yeah?

640
00:23:58,196 --> 00:23:59,629
Yeah. This guy, Beans

641
00:23:59,654 --> 00:24:01,453
we call him that, he's Mexican...

642
00:24:01,478 --> 00:24:03,912
That sounds racist, but
he named himself that

643
00:24:03,937 --> 00:24:05,837
and he kind of makes us call
him that; we don't want to.

644
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:07,395
His actual name's
Bernard. It doesn't matter.

645
00:24:07,397 --> 00:24:09,297
Anyway, he's having a house party.

646
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:10,932
It should be a lot of fun and, um...

647
00:24:10,934 --> 00:24:12,133
Josh is going.

648
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:13,468
And I'm going.

649
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,636
(exhales)

650
00:24:16,133 --> 00:24:17,732
Do you want to go?

651
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:19,115
Yeah. Is there, like,

652
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,734
a Paperless Post that I should reply to?

653
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,578
Why don't we...

654
00:24:21,603 --> 00:24:23,250
why don't we just go together?

655
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:25,547
Great, yeah.

656
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,148
Okay, so, um...

657
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,109
So you'll come to me, in a car?

658
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:32,335
Yes, like... a date.

659
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,870
Because you're pretty and you're smart

660
00:24:34,926 --> 00:24:37,059
and you're ignoring me, so
you're obviously my type.

661
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:38,450
I'm sorry. What were you saying?

662
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:39,976
Perfect.

663
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:40,929
(sighs)

664
00:24:40,954 --> 00:24:42,120
A party.

665
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,885
Big party.

666
00:24:49,472 --> 00:24:51,673
(singing to self)

667
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,515
Ooh! (laughs)

668
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,806
You were right behind me.

669
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:58,914
Yeah. What's up?

670
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:00,914
Uh, about the Ramirez case:

671
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,550
The judge refused to grant the stay,

672
00:25:02,552 --> 00:25:04,625
so we present our arguments on Wednesday.

673
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,097
Well, that's swell,

674
00:25:06,122 --> 00:25:07,622
because I'm really good at arguing.

675
00:25:07,624 --> 00:25:10,091
Oh! Before I forget to tell you, though,

676
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:11,659
I do not like the judge in that case.

677
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:13,194
I want Judge Egan. I did a little research.

678
00:25:13,196 --> 00:25:15,296
So what I need you to
do is petition the court.

679
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:17,298
We will get Judge Egan

680
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,001
and we will crush that illegal water park.

681
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,733
You're in a good mood today.

682
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:27,325
Yeah, ever just have, like, a great day?

683
00:25:28,054 --> 00:25:29,617
No.

684
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:30,610
Really?

685
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,365
That's, like, really sad.

686
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:33,414
Okay.

687
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:34,656
So...

688
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,209
you mentioned you didn't
know anyone in town.

689
00:25:37,234 --> 00:25:38,400
No. Not a soul.

690
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:39,444
Living or dead.

691
00:25:39,469 --> 00:25:40,801
Don't know no ghosts. (giggles)

692
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,453
Okay, stop.

693
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:43,710
Something is wrong.

694
00:25:43,735 --> 00:25:46,936
I am not buying any of this.

695
00:25:47,265 --> 00:25:48,832
Okay, yeah, again,

696
00:25:48,857 --> 00:25:50,389
the reason that I'm here...

697
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:52,014
'cause you seem, like, weirded out

698
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,138
with my whole presence...

699
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:54,462
Is because I moved here

700
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:56,821
'cause I got a really
great offer from Darryl.

701
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,279
(stammering loudly)

702
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,341
It's okay, don't tell me the truth.

703
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:01,409
In fact,

704
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:02,810
thank you

705
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,245
for not telling me the truth,

706
00:26:04,247 --> 00:26:06,187
because I will figure it out.

707
00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:06,882
Ah!

708
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,799
Now I have something fun to do.

709
00:26:09,257 --> 00:26:10,918
Okay, well,

710
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,679
I'm glad that this is really fun for you.

711
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,838
Enjoy whatever you have going on,

712
00:26:14,863 --> 00:26:16,696

Oh, I totally just woke up from a nap.

765
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:01,480
So, I got accepted

766
00:29:01,482 --> 00:29:02,932
to business school at Emory.

767
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:05,257
- Mm-hmm. 
- Uh, and then my dad got sick.

768
00:29:05,628 --> 00:29:07,453
- Um, my parents are divorced. 
- Mm-hmm.

769
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,088
- So I... 
- Oh, uh, mine are divorced, too.

Yeah, yeah, like, they're really divorced.

You know, it's so weird.

00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:21,567
I, like, haven't seen Josh yet.

777
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:22,935
What's...

778
00:29:22,937 --> 00:29:24,403
What's the deal with you and Josh?

779
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:27,098
Because we've been talking about him a lot.

780
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:28,456
What? Come on.

781
00:29:28,481 --> 00:29:29,980
Dude, he's just... You know, I told you.

782
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:31,238
He's, like, an old friend of mine.

783
00:29:31,263 --> 00:29:32,929
I just, like, I want to, I want to see him

784
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,380
and want to see him and surprise him.

785
00:29:34,382 --> 00:29:36,315
You're sure? Because if
you were into him, Yeah.

786
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,183
I would totally get it.
He's a good-looking guy.

787
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:39,151
He's built like a brick house.

788
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,034
Okay, uh-huh. He knows magic.

789
00:29:43,378 --> 00:29:45,324
Okay, I'll shut up about that.

790
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,526
Yeah.

791
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:51,878
Hey.

792
00:29:52,107 --> 00:29:53,840
Do you want to go outside?

793
00:29:56,971 --> 00:29:58,938
Actually, um, I'm cold. Let's go inside.

794
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:02,031
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

795
00:30:02,056 --> 00:30:03,355
Uh...

796
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:07,234
Hey, is...

797
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:09,392
something wrong?

798
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,983
No, no, no.

799
00:30:10,985 --> 00:30:13,752
Um, do you want find a bedroom?

800
00:30:13,754 --> 00:30:15,321
No.

801
00:30:15,323 --> 00:30:16,956
I would not... Yes.

802
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:21,128
Is this room okay?

803
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,760
Yeah, it's fine.

804
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:24,551
Is it okay that Josh isn't in here?

805
00:30:24,838 --> 00:30:26,137
- Or... 
- Yeah, it's fine.

806
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:28,434
(chuckles)

807
00:30:28,436 --> 00:30:30,235
(phone chimes) Oh.

808
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:33,272
Ah, speak of the handsome devil himself.

809
00:30:33,274 --> 00:30:34,417
Chan just texted.

810
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:36,342
“Not gonna come tonight”"

811
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:40,174
His girlfriend's making him
go to her sister's quinseñera.

812
00:30:44,418 --> 00:30:46,612
Sorry. Um...

813
00:30:47,604 --> 00:30:49,198
Josh has a girlfriend?

814
00:30:49,534 --> 00:30:52,291
Just 'cause Facebook says he's single.

815
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,126
Okay, I'm getting the Josh vibe again.

816
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:55,557
Maybe we should just go back to the party.

817
00:30:55,582 --> 00:30:57,816
No, no, that's crazy.
Come-come here, crazy.

818
00:31:04,004 --> 00:31:07,807
Like, if you must know, Josh isn't my type.

819
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:15,714
But, like, speaking of types,

820
00:31:15,716 --> 00:31:17,983
like, what type's his girlfriend?

821
00:31:17,985 --> 00:31:19,118
- I should go.
- No, no.

822
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,319
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

823
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:21,520
(in baby voice): Where you going?

824
00:31:21,694 --> 00:31:23,268
Where's the little boy going?

825
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:28,167
Are you going anywhere now?

826
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:30,370
- No.
- Okay, good.

827
00:31:30,665 --> 00:31:33,198
Is this, does this feel good?

828
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,667
You really like talking, don't you?

829
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:35,768
Okay, I'll stop.

830
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,192
I'll stop, I'll stop, I'll stop.

831
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,505
I'll stop talking. Shh, shh.
Shh, shh, I'll stop talking.

832
00:31:39,507 --> 00:31:40,706
But just, like,

833
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:43,175
circling back to Josh for
just, like, a quick second.

834
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:44,964
I know, I know, just a quick second.

835
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:47,401
Um, like, where did he, where did he,

836
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:48,714
where'd he meet his girlfriend?

837
00:31:48,716 --> 00:31:50,349
Like, what's their, what's their story?

838
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:51,483
What's their deal?

839
00:31:51,485 --> 00:31:52,526
They dated in high school.

840
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:54,184
He moved back to be with her.

841
00:31:54,933 --> 00:31:55,854
Oh.

842
00:31:58,307 --> 00:31:59,224
Got it.

843
00:31:59,226 --> 00:32:00,426
Okay, good.

844
00:32:00,428 --> 00:32:02,127
I'm so, I'm happy for him.

845
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,065
(crying): He moved back here for her.

846
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:06,598
It's like, it's like<i> The Notebook.</i>

847
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,100
(zipping) Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

848
00:32:08,102 --> 00:32:09,568
- I, uh, 
- What? What?

849
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,940
I can't believe I'm doing
this, because I-I really...

850
00:32:13,107 --> 00:32:14,339
I really need this,

851
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:15,774
but, um, I don't know much,

852
00:32:15,776 --> 00:32:17,342
but what I do know is it's not good

853
00:32:17,344 --> 00:32:18,911
to hook up with a crying girl.

854
00:32:18,913 --> 00:32:20,612
No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not crying.

855
00:32:20,614 --> 00:32:21,747
I'm not crying. I'm fine.

856
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:22,848
No, you're not.

857
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,760
Hey, whatever it is,

858
00:32:25,518 --> 00:32:27,384
I really don't think you should be here.

859
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:30,422
Come on.

860
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,691
I'll drive you home.

861
00:32:32,693 --> 00:32:34,259
Okay. Are you sure?

862
00:32:34,261 --> 00:32:35,527
- I can do that. 
- Yeah, yeah, no, hey.

863
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:37,396
No, no, no, no, no. You've done enough.

864
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:39,798
Okay, okay.

865
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,533
(sighs, zippers)

866
00:32:41,597 --> 00:32:43,764
(groans)

867
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:00,542
Huh?

868
00:33:07,057 --> 00:33:08,479
Um, what are you doing here?

869
00:33:08,504 --> 00:33:10,323
I just stopped in to chat with you.

870
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:11,659
- Who's this? 
- You want to chat?

871
00:33:11,684 --> 00:33:12,346
Who are you?

872
00:33:12,371 --> 00:33:15,714
Um, Greg, uh, Paula.

873
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:17,472
- Paula, Greg. 
- Hi there.

874
00:33:17,814 --> 00:33:19,081
You half Italian?

875
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:20,805
Uh, yeah?

876
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,643
I can always tell.

877
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,897
Okay, all right.

878
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:24,131
I don't know what you're doing.

879
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:25,566
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. We'll be back, Greg.

880
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:27,890
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'll
iChat you or something.

881
00:33:27,915 --> 00:33:29,323
No, I'll just...

882
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,737
I'll just wait here.

883
00:33:33,286 --> 00:33:33,978
Where are we...

884
00:33:34,003 --> 00:33:36,339
Is this far enough from the house?
Come here.

885
00:33:36,565 --> 00:33:37,797
What are you doing here?

886
00:33:37,822 --> 00:33:39,549
You think you are so
much better than me, huh?

887
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:41,214
Harvard? Yale?

888
00:33:41,272 --> 00:33:43,049
I am just as smart as you
are, Miss Snooty Shoes.

889
00:33:43,074 --> 00:33:44,612
What are you talking about?

890
00:33:44,637 --> 00:33:45,869
I'm talking about Josh.

891
00:33:46,043 --> 00:33:46,995
Chan.

892
00:33:47,117 --> 00:33:48,167
Yeah.

893
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:50,063
Josh Ch... Josh Chan!

894
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:52,073
- Josh Chan! 
- Okay, hey, hey, hey! Hey.

895
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:53,659
- What do you know about Josh?
- What do I know about Josh?

896
00:33:53,684 --> 00:33:55,221
Uh, let's see, um,

897
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:56,813
I know he lives in town, which is weird,

898
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:58,571
because you told you
didn't know anyone here,

899
00:33:58,596 --> 00:33:59,729
and clearly,

900
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:01,854
you know him, because
you checked his Facebook

901
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:03,042
63 times today

902
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:05,057
and his Instagram 18 times.

903
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:06,542
Have you been going through my computer?

904
00:34:06,567 --> 00:34:08,000
Yes, yes, I have.

905
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:09,456
I could have you fired.

906
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:10,880
Oh, you lied to me.

907
00:34:10,905 --> 00:34:12,538
I wasn't lying to you. I wasn't under oath

908
00:34:12,563 --> 00:34:13,896
when I met you in the office.

909
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:14,784
All right, you know what?

910
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:16,792
Did someone shove a Bible under my hand?

911
00:34:16,817 --> 00:34:18,283
This is not the point. The point is

912
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:19,808
whoever this Josh Chan is,

913
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:21,332
you are, you're obsessed with him.

914
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:23,135
(laughs) What?

915
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,860
You love him, you moved here for him,

916
00:34:24,885 --> 00:34:27,401
and you won't admit it. Why?

917
00:34:27,426 --> 00:34:29,995
Wow, okay. I do not love him.

918
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:31,807
I barely know him.

919
00:34:31,832 --> 00:34:34,268
I dated him for two months
when I was 16 at a summer camp.

920
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:35,659
So you're saying that I moved here

921
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:37,317
from New York and I left behind a job

922
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:39,604
that would've paid me $545,000 a year

923
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:41,395
for a guy who still skateboards?

924
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,553
I did not do that.

925
00:34:42,578 --> 00:34:44,144
Here's what happened. I was in New York.

926
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:45,902
I ran into Josh. He
made me feel warm inside.

927
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:47,660
Like glitter was exploding inside me.

928
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:48,884
Then I moved here.

929
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,242
I did not move here because of Josh,

930
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:52,542
because that would be
crazy, and I am not crazy.

931
00:34:56,843 --> 00:34:58,049
Oh, my God.

932
00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:00,291
Oh, my God.

933
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:01,854
No, I'm not crazy.

934
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:05,089
I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy.

935
00:35:05,114 --> 00:35:07,048
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. 
- Okay, no, stop it.

936
00:35:07,073 --> 00:35:08,339
Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh, my God, I'm crazy.

937
00:35:08,364 --> 00:35:09,979
- Stop it. Listen. 
- Oh, my God, I'm crazy.

938
00:35:10,004 --> 00:35:11,042
No, no, no, no, I'm crazy.
Oh, my God, I'm crazy.

939
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:11,778
You're not crazy.

940
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:13,073
You hear me, you're not
crazy. You're in love.

941
00:35:13,098 --> 00:35:14,764
And that is, that is totally different.

942
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:16,249
No, I'm not in love.
That would be stupid.

943
00:35:16,274 --> 00:35:16,994
Hey, wait, whoa.

944
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:18,792
- You're not stupid. 
- That would make me stupid.

945
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:19,753
You just should've told me.

946
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:21,237
That's all.
I-I-I'm just,

947
00:35:21,262 --> 00:35:22,661
I was busting your balls
'cause you lied to me.

948
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:24,319
- Okay, no... 
- No, no, no, no, no, I'm crazy. I'm crazy.

949
00:35:24,344 --> 00:35:26,411
- All right, this is going down a road 
- I'm crazy and I'm irrational

950
00:35:26,436 --> 00:35:28,065
- that I am not... 
- and I'm everything my mother said I was.

951
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,923
Now stop it!

952
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:33,122
Don't you talk about my
friend like that ever again.

953
00:35:33,124 --> 00:35:34,714
Do you hear me?

954
00:35:35,682 --> 00:35:37,327
We're friends?

955
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:39,495
(chuckles)

956
00:35:39,497 --> 00:35:41,479
I would be proud to be your friend,

957
00:35:41,935 --> 00:35:43,835
now that I know the truth.

958
00:35:44,205 --> 00:35:47,106
What you did for love, for true love,

959
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:48,830
the sacrifices,

960
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,456
the-the money that you walked away from...

961
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:53,348
- Oh, God. 
- No, no, no, no, no. No.

962
00:35:53,373 --> 00:35:55,373
You're not crazy, and you're not stupid.

963
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:57,010
You know what you are? You're brave.

964
00:35:57,035 --> 00:35:59,302
And I wish that I had been

965
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:03,262
as brave when I was your age.

966
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:04,750
Okay, look,

967
00:36:04,775 --> 00:36:06,198
you want it to be a secret? I get it.

968
00:36:06,223 --> 00:36:07,923
I will not tell a soul, okay?

969
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:09,380
But-but I'm here now.

970
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:11,346
Okay, you are not in this alone.

971
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:12,670
And I will, I will help you.

972
00:36:12,695 --> 00:36:14,629
Let me help you, 'cause
we can win this thing!

973
00:36:14,654 --> 00:36:16,320
(whispering): We can win it.

974
00:36:16,353 --> 00:36:17,909
We can... (exhales)

975
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:19,500
We can win the whole thing.

976
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:20,690
Okay?

977
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:22,214
It doesn't matter, um...

978
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:25,073
because I just found out
that Josh has a girlfriend.

979
00:36:25,098 --> 00:36:27,031
- What? 
- No, it makes sense, because I texted him

980
00:36:27,056 --> 00:36:29,390
46 hours ago and he
hasn't gotten back to me,

981
00:36:29,748 --> 00:36:31,147
because he's busy with his girlfriend.

982
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:32,215
No, no, no.

983
00:36:32,217 --> 00:36:33,449
His Facebook status says he's single,

984
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:35,118
and if he was into her,
why would it say that?

985
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,073
That's what I said.

986
00:36:37,098 --> 00:36:39,098
Exactly. All right.
This is why you need me.

987
00:36:39,123 --> 00:36:40,889
All right, look,

988
00:36:40,914 --> 00:36:43,315
if we play this right, one day,

989
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:45,466
it is gonna hit him

990
00:36:45,491 --> 00:36:48,464
like a bag of nails to the balls,

991
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:49,789
and that day,

992
00:36:49,814 --> 00:36:52,870
he will text.

993
00:36:53,597 --> 00:36:54,878
(phone chimes)

994
00:36:56,906 --> 00:36:58,706
Are you a witch?

995
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,656
I-I can't. I think I might faint.

996
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:03,715
- Just, I can't, I can't, I can't. 
- Okay, hold on, no, no, no.

997
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,640
- I can't... 
- (gasps)

998
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:06,971
- What? (gasps) 
- Josh Chan.

999
00:37:06,996 --> 00:37:08,262
Oh, God, oh, God.

1000
00:37:08,287 --> 00:37:10,187
“Want to grab dinner?”

1001
00:37:10,884 --> 00:37:12,417
Smiley face.

1002
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:14,042
My God, is it really smiley?
There's a smiley face!

1003
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:16,067

PAULA: You want to go drive by his house?

1025
00:38:19,995 --> 00:38:21,394
REBECCA: You know where he lives?

1026
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:24,754
This is gonna be so much fun.

1027
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:27,549
Hey, Denise. It's me, Nipsey Hussle.

1028
00:38:27,574 --> 00:38:30,075
I recently had an eye-opening experience.

1029
00:38:30,314 --> 00:38:32,581
I'm calling to apologize
for the way I treated you

1030
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:34,639
when you danced in my recent music video.

1031
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:37,971
Denise, I'm sorry that I
showered you with Cristal.

1032
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:39,796
I didn't even ask if you liked Champagne,

1033
00:38:39,936 --> 00:38:42,003
and it probably messed up your blow out.

1034
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,429
Ashley, I realize now
that it wasn't right for me

1035
00:38:44,454 --> 00:38:46,354
to tell you what to do
with that big fat butt.

1036
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:47,811
You can wiggle it,

1037
00:38:47,836 --> 00:38:49,336
or you could sit it down in a classroom

1038
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,456
and get that college
degree in communications.

1039
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:54,449
Chelsea, I'm sorry I put you
in a bikini made of gold coins

1040
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:56,741
and then made you dance
on the roof of my Bentley.

1041
00:38:56,943 --> 00:38:58,609
I realize now that metal conducts heat

1042
00:38:58,634 --> 00:39:01,602
and that was probably a very
uncomfortable experience.

1043
00:39:01,627 --> 00:39:03,660
Anyway, Denise, hit me
up whenever you get this.

1044
00:39:03,685 --> 00:39:05,418
I'd love to discuss <i>The Second Sex</i>

1045
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,044
by Simone de Beauvoir, which I just read.

1046
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:10,436
You are beautiful inside as well as out.

1047
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:12,361
You are my equal.

1048
