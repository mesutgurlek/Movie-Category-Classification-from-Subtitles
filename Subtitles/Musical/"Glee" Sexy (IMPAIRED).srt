1
00:00:01,544 --> 00:00:04,079
The Celibacy Club will now
come to order.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,131
Let's start the meeting
by reading the minutes

3
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:08,350
from last week's meeting
where we read the minutes

4
00:00:08,418 --> 00:00:10,185
from the previous meeting,

5
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:12,771
and Rachel spent the hour
quizzing Quinn about the nature

6
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:14,023
of her relationship with Finn.

7
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,308
Questions somebody still
refuses to answer.

8
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:18,160
And I will continue
to refuse to answer them

9
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:19,428
because they are none
of your business.

10
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:20,813
All I will reveal

11
00:00:20,897 --> 00:00:23,598
is that I rejoined the Celibacy
Club to focus on me.

12
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,883
Me, too.
Finn is kryptonite, which is

13
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:27,453
why I am focusing all my energies
now on my song-writing.

14
00:00:27,537 --> 00:00:30,439
Yes, and I have to say
I am very inspired

15
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,626
that both of you are showing how
celibacy is a viable option

16
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:35,411
for teens who simply aren't
ready for intimacy,

17
00:00:35,462 --> 00:00:36,945
and for those who are older

18
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:38,664
and are terrified
of the hose monster.

19
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:40,782
I have a little bit
of club swag here

20
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:44,503
that I think's really
gonna catch on. Ready?

21
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:45,804
Chastity charms.

22
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:49,091
We hand out the little hearts,
but not the key.

23
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:51,644
That way, nobody can open
the lock forever.

24
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:54,763
And ladies,
that's what keeps us safe.

25
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:56,715
I have some questions.

26
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:58,467
Some things that I...
I'm curious about.

27
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:00,135
No, no, no,
why be curious?

28
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:02,738
No, wait to have relations until
you're comfortable, right?

29
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:04,973
Maybe till your honeymoon,
I don't know.

30
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:06,442
Maybe even later!

31
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:08,460
Celibacy, ladies! Dig it!

32
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,645

33
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:13,832
(school bell rings)
I'm just so disappointed.

34
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:16,318
Why? I thought you wanted the
chastity charms to catch on.

35
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:19,038
I did, until I realized they
were wearing the chastity charms

36
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,205
as clip-on nipple rings.

37
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,590
I know preaching
abstinence is hard,

38
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:23,092
but I've seen
how a teen pregnancy

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,593
can turn a kid's
world upside down.

40
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,545
So keep fighting the good fight.

41
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:29,548
And I'm happy to do whatever I
can to help make celibacy

42
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,016
an option for these kids.

43
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:32,601
I don't know, hot stuff.

44
00:01:32,668 --> 00:01:35,637
Sounds pretty lame...

45
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:37,005
Holly!
What are you doing here?

46
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:40,109
Subbing. The health and wellness
teacher's out

47
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:43,395
with a mad case of the herp.
Yikers.

48
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,514
- Oh, it's so good to see you!
- You, too!

49
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:46,648
Oh, this face, this face!

50
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,067
(clears throat)

51
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,235
Oh. Oh, this is...

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
Emma.

53
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:52,854
- Emma, Emma Pillsbury.
- Oh, hi.

54
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:54,073
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

55
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,291
- This is Holly Holliday.
- Hi, Holly.

56
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,543
Have a seat here.

57
00:01:57,627 --> 00:02:00,045
- Oh, thank you.
- Wow!

58
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,332
So, I'm curious why
you don't, uh, think

59
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:05,884
that celibacy is a valid choice
for teenagers.

60
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:07,369
Oh, I do.
I think it's a valid choice.

61
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,971
I just don't think it's
that realistic.

62
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,756
You know, it's like saying

63
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,142
vegetarianism is an option
for lions.

64
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,894
(laughs)

65
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:18,931
I just read in the newspaper
that ninety high school girls in

66
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:23,152
a Memphis school district got
pregnant within three months!

67
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,770
I mean, it <i>is</i> Tennessee,
but still.

68
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:27,106
We've got to shake things up,
you know?

69
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,575
Information is power.
Oh, and by the way, Will,

70
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:33,328
some of your Glee kids are
the most clueless.

71
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:36,565
Demonstration: This is a condom,

72
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,667
which can help prevent
the spread of HIV,

73
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:40,068
which can lead to AIDS,

74
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,087
and it also prevents pregnancy.

75
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:43,789
Wait, cucumbers can give you
AIDS?

76
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:46,425
Seriously? 'Cause I just had
them on my salad!

77
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:49,878
- We've got to educate these kids.
- I strongly disagree.

78
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:51,580
I don't think that we
should barrage these kids

79
00:02:51,648 --> 00:02:53,132
with graphic information.
They're kids.

80
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:54,683
I don't want to steal
their innocence.

81
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,687
Are you, like,
some kind of crazy Pope lady?

82
00:02:58,754 --> 00:03:01,723
Think about the images
that these kids are exposed to.

83
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,393
I mean, think about
what they have access to.

84
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:05,761
That doesn't make it okay.

85
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:07,229
And it shouldn't
change the message

86
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,314
that they get from us,
which is this is serious stuff

87
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,449
and it's not for kids
and it's not for adults!

88
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:15,270
Okay, well,
I think that's a little naive.

89
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:19,208
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to have crazy sex,

90
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:21,943
because I'm crazy
informed about it.

91
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:24,129
Kidding.

92
00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:26,298
(Will and Holly laugh)

93
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:28,634
<i>- Hasta luego.
- Hasta luego.</i>

94
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:32,621
Oh, man.
(school bell rings)

95
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:36,124
Hey, Britt-britt.
So listen.

96
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:39,144
How about you and I pop in some
<i>Sweet Valley High</i> this evening,

97
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:40,629
get our cuddle on?

98
00:03:40,697 --> 00:03:43,232
Look, I'd really like to
get my sweet lady-kisses on,

99
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:47,352
but I haven't been
feeling very sexy lately.

100
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:49,304
I think I have a
bun in the oven.

101
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,740
Please don't tell anyone.

102
00:03:51,807 --> 00:03:54,860
- Okay? Especially Artie.
- Yeah, sure.

103
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:55,944
Your secret's safe with...

104
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:57,746
Oh, my God. Brittany's pregnant.

105
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,081
Oh, my God.
Brittany's pregnant.

106
00:03:59,148 --> 00:04:01,166
- It was only a matter of time.
- For what?

107
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:02,367
Brittany to get pregnant.

108
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:04,369
- Oh. Congratulations.
- For what?

109
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:05,654
Oh, you didn't hear?
Your girlfriend's preggo.

110
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,206
You're gonna be a baby daddy.

111
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,957
(bell ringing)

112
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:10,125
All right, folks.

113
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:11,493
Regionals is in a week.

114
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,545
It's time to get deep
into our set list.

115
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,464
Artie?

116
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:17,299
You okay?

117
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,017
My life is over.

118
00:04:19,102 --> 00:04:22,170
How am I supposed
to support a baby?

119
00:04:22,222 --> 00:04:24,339
How could you not
tell me about this?

120
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,324
Wait, Brittany,
are you pregnant?

121
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:27,593
Definitely.
I'm so sorry, Artie.

122
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,279
I didn't want to upset you.

123
00:04:30,346 --> 00:04:32,481
I thought I could surprise you
when I dropped him off.

124
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:34,683
I'm pretty sure it's a boy.

125
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,835
Um...
Babies don't get dropped off.

126
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:38,537
Wait, Brittany.
Have you been to a doctor yet?

127
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:40,822
That's the only way to be sure.

128
00:04:40,874 --> 00:04:42,958
I don't need to go to a doctor.

129
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,626
I just need
to look outside my window.

130
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:46,528
Three days ago,

131
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:48,764
a stork built its nest
on top of my garage.

132
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,966
I'm not stupid.
It's obviously getting ready

133
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:53,051
to bring me my baby.

134
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:55,003
I know where babies come from.

135
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,558
<i>WILL: And that's when I realized
you were right.</i>

136
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:03,011
Let's go. Health and wellness
Jazzercise class!

137
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:04,930
Do we feel our hearts
pumping yet, guys?

138
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,381
(cheering)

139
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:09,050
You see? We have really got
to educate these kids.

140
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:10,519
How are we going to do that
without being too graphic?

141
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,770
Breathe it in.

142
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:13,572
I want to educate them,
not titillate them.

143
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:17,276
Didn't you ever read
Jessica Seinfeld's cookbook?

144
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,895
It's all about taking vegetables
and hiding it in food

145
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:23,282
so that you can trick kids into
eating what's good for them.

146
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:24,666
Shake it!

147
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:26,084
Ah! And loose.

148
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:27,786
I'm not following.

149
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,671
It's Jazzercise, Will.
It's really not that hard.

150
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:31,039
- No.
- Grease it.

151
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,174
I'm still talking
about the vegetable hiding.

152
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:33,508
All I'm saying is

153
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:36,261
all we have to do
is find a way to sneak in

154
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:39,548
the sex education lesson
in a less provocative way.

155
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:41,583
And stretch.

156
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,936
Oh!

157
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,887
- You guys were awesome.
- Yeah!

158
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:47,189
How good do we feel?

159
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:49,141
(cheering)
Are we sweating? Yes!

160
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,475
Next week, we are going to talk

161
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,427
about the power
of muscle testing.

162
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,929
Yeah? Bye. Love you.

163
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,148
(groans)
Okay.

164
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:57,866
Here's what I think
you should do.

165
00:05:57,933 --> 00:05:59,117
Let me come
into Glee Club this week

166
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:00,652
and I'll show you what I mean.

167
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:02,437
The kids will think that they're
getting ready for Regionals,

168
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,990
but really I'll slip
in a little lesson

169
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:07,108
about how to avoid STDs.

170
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,162
And speaking of STDs,
how is your dating life?

171
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:13,665
Um, right now, I'm the president
of the Celibacy Club.

172
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,083
Mmm.

173
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:16,785
That's a waste
of some fine man-butt.

174
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,074
Sexy.

175
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:23,759
I really hope that's not one

176
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,110
of the requirements
for Regionals,

177
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:26,428
because with Berry
in those tights,

178
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,146
- we don't stand a chance.
- No, this isn't

179
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:29,348
about Regionals.
I'm less worried

180
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:30,565
about that right now
and more worried

181
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,300
about the fact that
it's become clear to me

182
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:34,469
that some of you
have been lacking

183
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,138
when it comes
to understanding the...

184
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,408
The, uh...

185
00:06:39,475 --> 00:06:43,445
The intricacies
of adult relationships.

186
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:44,830
(sparse laughter)
Yeah, anyways...

187
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:47,082
Along with preparing for our
Regional next week,

188
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,334
I want to spend the week
educating ourselves

189
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,753
about some of these...
intricacies.

190
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:54,156
Is this the appropriate forum
for that?

191
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:55,990
WILL:
Look, whenever we had, uh,

192
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,793
issues in the past
that are on our minds

193
00:06:57,844 --> 00:06:59,127
or giving us problems,

194
00:06:59,178 --> 00:07:00,429
it's always helped us
to sing about it.

195
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:04,549
So this week I have
invited a special guest.

196
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,718
Miss Holiday.

197
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:07,769
(cheering)

198
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:10,472
<i>Hola, clase.</i>

199
00:07:10,523 --> 00:07:11,940
Oh, no.
It's the salad lady.

200
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,842
Okay. So sex...

201
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:17,345
It's just like hugging,
only wetter.

202
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:18,513
Yeah, it is.

203
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,232
Okay, so let's start
with the basics. Finn.

204
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:21,516
Is it true

205
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:22,901
that you thought you got
your girlfriend pregnant

206
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,119
via hot tub?

207
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:25,570
I have always been dubious.

208
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:26,455
(strikes off-key chord)

209
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:27,622
And Brittany,

210
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,207
you think that
storks bring babies?

211
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:31,543
I get my information
from Woody Woodpecker cartoons.

212
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:35,130
Well, that's all gonna end
right here, right now.

213
00:07:35,197 --> 00:07:37,916
Because today,
we are gonna get under the covers

214
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,801
all together

215
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:42,721
- and get the ditty on the dirty.
- I'm so turned-on right now.

216
00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:46,091
Uh, what about those of us
who choose to remain celibate?

217
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,810
Oh, well, I admire you.

218
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:50,712
Although I think you're naive

219
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:53,398
and possibly frigid,
I do admire your choice.

220
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:55,233
I think this is
a good time for a song.

221
00:07:55,318 --> 00:07:57,352
Oh, yes. Okay.

222
00:07:57,403 --> 00:07:58,720
- Okay.
- Rule number one:

223
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:00,322
Every intimate encounter
that you're ever going

224
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:01,990
to have in your life
is going to start with

225
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:04,943
a touch. Hit it!

226
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,746

So just remember

286
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:41,266
whenever you have sex
with someone,

287
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,353
you're having sex with everyone
they've ever had sex with.

288
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:47,372
And everybody's got a random.

289
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:51,859
Don't you think it's time
for the Warblers

290
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,227
to do
a Joan Armatrading medley?

291
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,613
Um, I'm not so sure
people know who that is.

292
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,366
SUE: Well, well, if it
isn't my sweet, sweet Porcelain.

293
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,534
Coach Sylvester.

294
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:01,952
What are you doing here?

295
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,654
Oh, just picking up
some coffee.

296
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,290
I like my enemas piping hot.

297
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:07,858
Actually, boys, I heard

298
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:10,644
that this was a Dalton
Academy hangout, and I come

299
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,880
in a spirit of fellowship.

300
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,767
As you no doubt have heard,
I've taken over

301
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,974
for the coach of Aural Intensity.

302
00:11:16,998 --> 00:11:17,918
We heard you pushed him
down the stairs.

303
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:19,303
No, you can't prove that.

304
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,089
This is just sort of
how she talks.

305
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:26,093
So, I happen to have
some top secret intel.

306
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:27,561
<i>Will Schuester
has finally realized</i>

307
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,513
<i>that his team's Achilles' heel</i>

308
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,565
<i>is their utter lack
of sex appeal.</i>

309
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,986
The New Directions
are getting sexy.

310
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:38,355
And the key to Regionals
is out-sexing them.

311
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,390
And I suspect

312
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:44,161
that the judges are scoring
extra for it this year.

313
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:45,829
So, Porcelain,

314
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:47,831
<i>quid pro quo</i>:

315
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,085
What do you have for me?

316
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,738
I'm sorry, Coach,
but you and are not in cahoots.

317
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:56,340
Probably should have
nailed that down

318
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:59,376
before I gave you
my top secret intel.

319
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,178
Porcelain,

320
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:04,682
you just made a powerful enema.

321
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,352
We got to hold an
emergency meeting.

322
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:10,137
- Why?
- Weren't you listening?

323
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:12,422
The judges at Regionals
have an eye out

324
00:12:12,474 --> 00:12:14,158
for something new,
which means...

325
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:18,612
The Warblers got to do
something sexy-fied.

326
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,597
(bell ringing)

327
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:22,616
I am very disappointed
in you, Will.

328
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,318
Letting Holly come in and just

329
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:25,936
teach the Glee kids
about... stuff.

330
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:28,438
I mean, why didn't you
just pair them up, huh?

331
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,773
Rent them a bunch
of motel rooms?

332
00:12:29,824 --> 00:12:31,775
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I had no choice, Emma.

333
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:33,744
These kids are
totally unprepared.

334
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,212
Look, in the spirit
of fairness,

335
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,498
why don't you and the kids
in your Celibacy Club

336
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:38,949
come in and do a number?

337
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,135
What, like, sing?

338
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,471
Yeah. We're trying
to teach through song.

339
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,457
And yours can be
a counterargument to Holly's.

340
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:50,144
Well, I look forward
to the opportunity

341
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,845
to nail her to the wall.

342
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,130
(laughs)

343
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:55,799
You know what I mean.
(laughing)

344
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,937
Well, Puckerman,
it's your lucky day.

345
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,972
You're finally going
to let me motorboat those twins?

346
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:04,691
Remember I told you I had
a master plan? Here it is.

347
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:06,827
Can you think of a celebrity
who released a tape

348
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,979
of their intimate relations that
didn't make them more famous?

349
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:10,364
If this is going
where I think it's going,

350
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:11,648
I may need to sit down.

351
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:13,417
Rachel Berry wants to
be a famous singer.

352
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:14,918
I just want to be famous.

353
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:16,670
Doing that number for Glee Club

354
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,822
was my first step
toward being a star.

355
00:13:18,873 --> 00:13:20,457
I want to be like a Kardashian.

356
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,209
I want a TV show
and a fragrance.

357
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:23,877
It'll be called Zizes,

358
00:13:23,962 --> 00:13:26,096
and the slogan will be
"You just got Ziced!"

359
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,467
I'm not sure I heard
that last part right,

360
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,186
'cause I'm getting
a little light-headed,

361
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,888
but if we make one
of those tape, that means...

362
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:38,341
Wow. If your lovemaking
prowess is as impressive

363
00:13:38,393 --> 00:13:41,278
as your skills at deduction,
I'm in for a wild night.

364
00:13:41,345 --> 00:13:43,063
I would like
to welcome the ladies

365
00:13:43,148 --> 00:13:44,832
of our sister school,
Crawford Country Day.

366
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:48,068
As you know,
the Warblers are competing

367
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:50,154
in our show choir's Regionals
competition next week.

368
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,022
So, what we're going for here

369
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:55,542
today, ladies,
is something a little...

370
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,828
A little sexy.

371
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,829
But we need your input.

372
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,249
Are we scream worthy?

373
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,251
Do we make your knees
turn to jelly?

374
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:08,505
So, without further ado,
hang on to your bobby socks, girls,

375
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,924
'cause we're about
to rock your world.

(giggling)

417
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:18,335
Sweet, but not on your team.

418
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:19,386
(sighs)

419
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,439
Are you okay?

420
00:16:22,506 --> 00:16:23,807
You kept making

421
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,943
those weird faces
the whole song.

422
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,394
Those weren't weird faces.

423
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:29,229
Those were my sexy faces.

424
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:32,332
It just looked like
you were having gas pains

425
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,900
or something.

426
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:36,570
Great. How are we supposed to
get up on the stage at Regionals

427
00:16:36,654 --> 00:16:39,623
and sell sexy to the judges when
I have as much sexual appeal

428
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,041
and knowledge as a baby penguin?

429
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,010
We'll figure something out.

430
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:50,321
I want to talk
to you about something.

431
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:52,940
I really like
when we make out and stuff.

432
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:54,725
Which isn't cheating,
because...?

433
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:58,312
- The plumbing's different.
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,864
But when Artie
and I are together,

435
00:16:59,915 --> 00:17:01,081
we talk about stuff,
like feelings.

436
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,500
Why?

437
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,602
Because with feelings,
it's better.

438
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:06,069
Are you kidding?

439
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:08,405
It's better when it
doesn't involve feelings.

440
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:10,240
I think it's better when it
doesn't involve eye contact.

441
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:13,627
I don't know. I guess I just
don't know how I feel about us.

442
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:14,912
Look...

443
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:16,246
Let's be clear here.

444
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:18,015
I'm not interested
in any labels,

445
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:20,284
unless it's on something
I shoplift.

446
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:21,785
I don't know, Santana.

447
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:23,554
I think
we should talk to somebody.

448
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:25,055
Like an adult.

449
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:26,774
This relationship
is really confusing for me.

450
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:28,409
Breakfast is confusing for you.

451
00:17:28,476 --> 00:17:30,845
Well, sometimes it's sweet,
and sometimes it's salty.

452
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:33,781
Like, what if I have eggs for dinner?
Then what is it?

453
00:17:33,865 --> 00:17:36,200
(school bell rings)

454
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:37,434
Those linens are incredible.

455
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:38,869
I know.
Is that Egyptian cotton?

456
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:41,455
Why do they keep editing all
this vacation and plane stuff?

457
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,923
It classes it up.

458
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:45,876
If I want to see Kim Kardashian
being classy, I'll watch E!

459
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:47,077
(laughs)
Touch me.

460
00:17:47,128 --> 00:17:49,780
We're not putting any
of that stuff in ours.

461
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:51,632
- Well, maybe...
- Hey, guys. What's going on?

462
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:54,335
- Oh, hey, Miss H. Hey, can you help us out?
- Uh, yeah.

463
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,470
Lauren and I are gonna
make a sex tape.

464
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,055
So I can get a
recording contract.

465
00:17:58,122 --> 00:17:59,390
Wow. Okay.

466
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:00,891
Well, first, can I just say

467
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:03,060
that I'm very impressed
by not only your ambition,

468
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:05,479
but by how comfortable you are
with your own bodies?

469
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:07,681
Easy to be comfortable
when you look this good.

470
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:08,816
- You know what I mean?
- Agreed.

471
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,818
Uh, now for the downside.

472
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:13,404
Are you aware that because
you're under eighteen years of age,

473
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:15,806
making and owning a sex tape
could make you guilty

474
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:18,025
of child pornography?

475
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:21,028
Listen, guys, don't take this
too hard, all right?

476
00:18:21,112 --> 00:18:23,197
These things just...
They never work out well.

477
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:27,651
My sex tape with J.D. Salinger
was a disaster.

478
00:18:27,702 --> 00:18:31,338
- Thanks, Miss H.
- Later, dudes.

479
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:32,623
Ladies.

480
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:34,925
Miss Holiday,
we need your help.

481
00:18:34,993 --> 00:18:36,377
(bell ringing)

482
00:18:36,461 --> 00:18:38,712
So, why are we
sitting on the floor?

483
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:40,714
'Cause we're in Japan.

484
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,549
No.

485
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:46,503
Welcome to my sacred,
sexy sharing circle.

486
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:49,006
I want to thank you guys
for confiding in me,

487
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:50,641
'cause I know this is tough.

488
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,726
And I want to ask both of you

489
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:56,513
if either one of you thinks
that you might be a lesbian.

490
00:18:56,564 --> 00:18:58,699
I don't know.

491
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:00,200
Yeah, I mean, who knows?

492
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:03,537
I'm attracted to girls,
and I'm attracted to guys.

493
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:05,205
I've made out with a mannequin.

494
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,458
I even had a sex
dream about a shrub

495
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:09,693
that was just in the
shape of a person.

496
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:11,795
Hmm. Well, we've all been there.

497
00:19:11,863 --> 00:19:13,747
I went to an all-girls college

498
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:16,050
where the only industry
in the town

499
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:18,702
was the manufacturing
of softball equipment.

500
00:19:18,753 --> 00:19:22,556
I still feel a little tingle
when I hear Ani DiFranco.

501
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:25,559
(shudders)
Ooh!

502
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:26,877
Anyway, it's not about

503
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:28,595
who you are attracted to,
ultimately.

504
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,597
It's about who you
fall in love with.

505
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:32,816
Well, I don't know how I feel,

506
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:35,218
because Santana refuses
to talk about it.

507
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,772
Okay, well, I know talking about
feelings can be really hard,

508
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:41,408
so I have an idea.

509
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,911
Why don't you guys find a song

510
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:46,897
and see if maybe the lyrics
of the song could help you

511
00:19:46,948 --> 00:19:49,149
start a dialogue going?

512
00:19:49,217 --> 00:19:50,751
I could be down with that.

513
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:54,204
I have the perfect song.

514
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:55,739
There's just one problem, though.

515
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,926
Brit and I may need your help
to sing it.

516
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,612
I thought you'd never ask.

517
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,596
(bell ringing)

518
00:20:02,664 --> 00:20:04,965
All right, so give me sensual.

519
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,384
But don't make fun of it.
Like, really try.

520
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:14,058
Okay. Now give me... sultry.

521
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,431
Um, Kurt, they're all
sort of looking the same.

522
00:20:21,483 --> 00:20:24,051
That's because the face I'm
actually doing is uncomfortable.

523
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,569
This is pointless, Blaine.

524
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,321
I don't know how to be sexy,

525
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:29,323
because I don't know
the first thing about sex.

526
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:30,941
Kurt, you're blushing.

527
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:33,160
I've tried watching
those movies,

528
00:20:33,244 --> 00:20:34,528
but I just get
horribly depressed.

529
00:20:34,596 --> 00:20:36,130
And I think about how
they were all kids once,

530
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:37,414
and they all have mothers.

531
00:20:37,465 --> 00:20:38,665
And, God, what would
their mothers think?

532
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,117
And why would you get
that tattoo there?

533
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:41,785
Then maybe we should have
a conversation about it.

534
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:43,420
I'll tell you what I know.

535
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:45,589
I don't... I don't want to
know the graphic details.

536
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,141
I like romance.

537
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,560
That's why I like
Broadway musicals,

538
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:51,294
because the touch
of the fingertips

539
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:53,313
is as sexy as it gets.

540
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:55,015
Kurt, you're going to have
to learn about it someday.

541
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,567
Well, not today.

542
00:20:56,634 --> 00:20:59,036
I think I've learned quite
enough for today, thank you.

543
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:00,621
I think you should leave.

544
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:05,843
(school bell rings)

545
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,261
So just nice and easy.
I don't want

546
00:21:07,345 --> 00:21:08,929
to go too far away
from the original version.

547
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:10,097
Since when do you need help

548
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,215
singing in front
of the Glee Club?

549
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:12,749
Oh, it's not about the singing.

550
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:14,685
I'm trying to make Prince's
"Kiss" into a tango.

551
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:16,103
Just want to make sure
it's appropriate.

552
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:18,255
"Kiss" as a tango?

553
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:21,191
That's awesome and ridiculous.

554
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,727
Anyway, I want to do this right
for the sexy lesson.

555
00:21:23,778 --> 00:21:24,895
So picture us

556
00:21:24,946 --> 00:21:26,613
in the auditorium,
big backdrop,

557
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:30,200
lighting, costume,
the whole thing.

558
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:35,272
Hit it.

559
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:37,207

- Don't be.
- Go out with me.

598
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:49,572
Oh, you don't want any of this.

599
00:23:49,624 --> 00:23:51,008
I'm damaged goods.

600
00:23:51,075 --> 00:23:52,960
Yes, it makes me
terrific in bed,

601
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:55,745
but it also means I tend
to break nice guys like you

602
00:23:55,797 --> 00:23:57,580
into Wasa crackers.

603
00:23:57,632 --> 00:23:59,416
Oh, I think I can handle it.

604
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:01,751
You married
your high school sweetheart,

605
00:24:01,803 --> 00:24:03,437
and then you went out
with a virgin.

606
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:07,724
It's a great song.

607
00:24:07,775 --> 00:24:09,426
You don't need me, though.
The kids are going to love it.

608
00:24:12,697 --> 00:24:14,147
(bell ringing)

609
00:24:18,586 --> 00:24:21,204
Need a hand?

610
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:24,941
Yeah, why don't you hand
me that carburetor?

611
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:29,796
How'd you know
which one it was?

612
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:32,299
My dad and I
rebuilt a '59 Chevy

613
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:33,633
in our driveway
two summers ago.

614
00:24:33,718 --> 00:24:36,286
One of his many
attempts at bonding.

615
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:38,955
- You here looking for parts?
- No, actually.

616
00:24:39,006 --> 00:24:40,340
I, uh, wanted to talk
to you about Kurt.

617
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:42,008
Is he okay?

618
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:45,462
Have you ever talked
to him about sex?

619
00:24:45,513 --> 00:24:48,181
Are you gay
or straight or what?

620
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:51,935
- I'm definitely gay.
- Okay. Good.

621
00:24:51,986 --> 00:24:54,187
I mean, you know,
whatever, but, uh...

622
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,472
You know, good for Kurt.

623
00:24:55,523 --> 00:24:58,308
He needs someone like you
to talk to.

624
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,410
Well, that's kind of my point.

625
00:25:00,478 --> 00:25:01,862
I've tried talking to him,

626
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:03,914
but he basically puts his
fingers in his ears

627
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:05,315
and starts singing.

628
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:07,751
Well, when he's ready,
he'll listen.

629
00:25:07,818 --> 00:25:09,503
I'm worried that
it might be too late.

630
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:12,622
You know, Dalton doesn't
even have sex ed classes.

631
00:25:12,673 --> 00:25:14,324
Most schools don't,
and the ones that do

632
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:16,326
almost never discuss what
sex is like for gay kids.

633
00:25:16,377 --> 00:25:20,830
Kurt is... is the most moral,

634
00:25:20,882 --> 00:25:22,716
compassionate person
I've ever met.

635
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,601
You know, he gets that
from his mother.

636
00:25:24,668 --> 00:25:27,354
And... And I am blown away
by your guys' relationship.

637
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:30,791
You think my dad built a car
with me because he loves cars?

638
00:25:30,858 --> 00:25:32,008
I think he did it

639
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:34,144
because he thought
getting my hands dirty

640
00:25:34,195 --> 00:25:36,012
might make me straight.

641
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,118
You know, did he talk to you
about this, uh, kind of stuff?

642
00:25:41,185 --> 00:25:43,820
No. I had to go
find it for myself.

643
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:46,523
The Internet is great,
and all the information is out there,

644
00:25:46,574 --> 00:25:47,791
but I went searching for it.

645
00:25:47,858 --> 00:25:49,409
Kurt won't.

646
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:50,961
And one day,
he'll be at a party,

647
00:25:51,028 --> 00:25:53,964
and maybe have a few drinks

648
00:25:54,031 --> 00:25:55,698
and then he'll meet some guy
and start fooling around.

649
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,635
And he's not going to know
about using protection

650
00:25:58,702 --> 00:26:00,303
or STDs.

651
00:26:00,371 --> 00:26:02,756
I don't have the relationship

652
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,642
with my dad
that you have with Kurt.

653
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,599
I think it would be really cool
if you took advantage of that.

654
00:26:14,885 --> 00:26:16,236
I'm sorry if I'm overstepping.

655
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,738
You are.

656
00:26:22,243 --> 00:26:25,445

SANTANA:
Thank you.

687
00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:18,952
Pretty cool that our girlfriends
are such good friends, right?

688
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:20,420
I wish you and I
were that close.

689
00:29:20,504 --> 00:29:21,888
Can I just applaud this trio

690
00:29:21,956 --> 00:29:25,342
for exploring the uncharted
world of Sapphic charm?

691

<i>Brava. Brava.</i>

692

Look, just because
I sang a song with Brittany

693
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,514
doesn't mean that you can
put a label on me.

694
00:29:31,582 --> 00:29:32,716
Is that clear?

695

(school bell rings)

696

This meeting of the Celibacy Club
will now come to order.

697
00:29:41,525 --> 00:29:43,309
Before we begin,
I would just like to start

698
00:29:43,377 --> 00:29:44,778
by congratulating you by
reminding you

699
00:29:44,862 --> 00:29:46,246
not one member of this club

700
00:29:46,313 --> 00:29:48,615
has had an unwanted pregnancy
in almost a year.

701
00:29:48,699 --> 00:29:50,066
You get tenses for menses.

702
00:29:50,117 --> 00:29:51,701
I'd also like to welcome
our newest member,

703
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:52,902
Noah Puckerman.

704
00:29:52,953 --> 00:29:55,605
- Are you lost, Noah?
- Yeah, you don't belong here.

705
00:29:55,656 --> 00:29:56,823
You're the biggest
French whore of them all.

706
00:29:56,907 --> 00:29:58,324
Zizes and I were going
to make a sex tape.

707
00:29:58,409 --> 00:29:59,693
I found out that

708
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,227
making that tape would have
resulted in my arrest.

709
00:30:01,295 --> 00:30:02,796
I've hit rock bottom,

710
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,897
and I've come here
to set myself straight.

711
00:30:03,964 --> 00:30:05,215
That's just awesome, Noah.

712
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:06,883
And you're just in time,
because tomorrow

713
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,968
the girls and I are going
to perform a song for Glee Club

714
00:30:09,053 --> 00:30:10,953
extolling the benefits
of celibacy.

715
00:30:11,005 --> 00:30:12,505
I'm down for that.

716
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,090
Point of order, though.

717
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:16,176
While three chicks and me is
just a typical Saturday night

718
00:30:16,243 --> 00:30:17,460
in the Puckerman bedroom,

719
00:30:17,511 --> 00:30:18,895
it's not the best balance
for singing.

720
00:30:18,962 --> 00:30:20,213
We need at least one more dude.

721
00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:22,515
I've got that covered.

722

- Yeah?

742
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:32,702
So I'm a little confused.

743
00:31:32,753 --> 00:31:37,257
Isn't this a strange song for the...
the Celibacy Club to sing?

744
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:38,892
(chuckles)
But why?

745
00:31:38,976 --> 00:31:41,094
It's so wholesome.

746
00:31:41,178 --> 00:31:42,395
It was written during
the Bicentennial

747

to celebrate America
and fireworks...

748
00:31:45,065 --> 00:31:47,767
No, it's about sneaking
out for a nooner.

749
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:49,152
Yes. Exactly!

750
00:31:49,219 --> 00:31:51,187
A nooner's when you have
dessert in the middle

751
00:31:51,238 --> 00:31:52,589
of the day, right?

752
00:31:52,656 --> 00:31:54,340
Right, Carl?

753
00:31:54,408 --> 00:31:55,492
WILL:
Well, regardless...

754
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,076
It was a great job, guys.
Great number.

755
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:59,445
HOLLY: It was...
It was fantastic.

756
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,663
WILL: Hey, Glee Club, let's go.

757
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:01,998
Miss Holliday?
Excuse me a second.

758
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:03,733
Miss Holliday?

759
00:32:03,784 --> 00:32:05,168
You're still the, um...

760
00:32:05,235 --> 00:32:06,369
You're still the acting
sex-ed teacher, right?

761
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,204
You know it, brother.

762
00:32:08,255 --> 00:32:11,040
Uh, you don't happen to have
any office hours, do you?

763
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:12,675
- Sure.
- EMMA: Afternoon Delight is a dessert.

764
00:32:12,743 --> 00:32:15,044
It's made with coconut
and pineapple

765
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:16,262
and marshmallow fluff.

766
00:32:16,347 --> 00:32:18,264
I think Emma and I
need an appointment.

767
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:22,972
What are those?

768
00:32:23,056 --> 00:32:25,841
Those are some pamphlets
that I picked up from the free clinic.

769
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:27,760
I thought it might
help the process along,

770
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:29,795
because it is time you
and I had "the talk."

771
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:31,764
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

772
00:32:31,815 --> 00:32:33,349
- You told me to educate myself.
- La, la, la!

773
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:35,234
- La, la, la!
- Hey, you think this is easy for me?

774
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:36,602
- La, la, la, la!
- Okay, believe me,

775
00:32:36,653 --> 00:32:38,404
I want to do this even
less than you do.

776
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:40,472
This is going to suck
for both of us,

777
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:42,825
but we are going
to get through it together,

778
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:44,827
and we will both be
better men because of it.

779
00:32:46,997 --> 00:32:49,165
Now, first, most of the, um...

780
00:32:49,249 --> 00:32:51,917
mechanics of what you're going

781
00:32:51,985 --> 00:32:54,036
to be doing is covered
in the pamphlets.

782
00:32:54,121 --> 00:32:58,323
Okay, so, I want you to read them,
and then I want you to come talk

783
00:32:58,375 --> 00:32:59,992
to me about it.

784
00:33:00,043 --> 00:33:02,011
Deal?

785
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:03,763
Okay.

786
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,965
All right. Now.
Hey, sit down.

787
00:33:06,016 --> 00:33:07,516
We're just getting started.

788
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:08,801
All right.

789
00:33:08,852 --> 00:33:11,103
You know, for most guys,
sex is just... You know...

790
00:33:11,171 --> 00:33:12,471
It's this thing
we always want to do.

791
00:33:12,522 --> 00:33:14,190
You know, it's fun.

792
00:33:14,274 --> 00:33:15,608
It feels great.

793
00:33:15,675 --> 00:33:17,643
But we're not really thinking
too much about, you know,

794
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:21,313
how it makes us feel on
the inside or, you know,

795
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:23,866
how the other person
feels about it.

796
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,568
Women are different?

797
00:33:25,652 --> 00:33:28,537
Only because they get that
it's about something more

798
00:33:28,622 --> 00:33:30,823
than just the physical.

799
00:33:30,874 --> 00:33:33,959
You know, when... When you're
intimate with somebody

800
00:33:34,027 --> 00:33:37,913
in that way,
you're exposing yourself.

801
00:33:37,998 --> 00:33:41,000
You know, you're never going
to be more vulnerable,

802
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:43,469
and that scares the hell
out of a lot of guys.

803
00:33:43,536 --> 00:33:47,056
Believe me, I can't tell
you how many buddies I've got

804
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,292
who have gotten in
way too deep with a girl

805
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,711
who said she was cool
with just hooking up.

806
00:33:52,763 --> 00:33:54,430
But that's not going
to happen to me, Dad.

807
00:33:54,514 --> 00:33:56,232
No. It's going to be worse.

808
00:33:56,316 --> 00:33:57,883
Okay? Because it's two guys.

809
00:33:57,934 --> 00:33:59,301
With two guys,

810
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:02,855
you've got two people
who think that sex is just sex.

811
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:04,907
It's gonna be
easier to come by.

812
00:34:04,991 --> 00:34:06,025
And once you start
doing this stuff,

813
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:07,392
you're not going
to want to stop.

814
00:34:07,444 --> 00:34:09,445
You just... You've got to know
that it means something.

815
00:34:09,529 --> 00:34:12,915
You know,
it's doing something to you,

816
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:16,452
to your heart,
to your self-esteem,

817
00:34:16,536 --> 00:34:19,338
even though it feels like
you're just having fun.

818
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:22,858
So, you're saying I
shouldn't have sex?

819
00:34:22,926 --> 00:34:27,279
I think on your thirtieth birthday,
it is a great gift to yourself.

820
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,083
Kurt...

821
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:34,270
When you're ready...

822
00:34:34,354 --> 00:34:38,724
I want you to be able to...

823
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:40,776
Do everything.

824
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:42,862
But when you're ready,
I want you

825
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:47,633
to use it as a way
to connect to another person.

826
00:34:47,701 --> 00:34:49,601
Don't throw yourself around

827
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:51,654
like you don't matter.

828
00:34:51,738 --> 00:34:55,191
'Cause you matter, Kurt.

829
00:34:58,795 --> 00:35:00,779
Is that it?

830
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:03,115
That's it. For now.

831
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,583
Can I make you some toast?

832
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:06,669
I think I'll take
it up to my room

833
00:35:06,753 --> 00:35:09,839
to eat while I look
over my new pamphlets.

834
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:16,061
- Thank you, Dad.
- You're welcome.

835
00:35:22,235 --> 00:35:24,620
(sighs)

836
00:35:24,688 --> 00:35:26,689
Now, I hear you guys are
having some problems.

837
00:35:26,773 --> 00:35:28,190
- I wouldn't call them problems.
- No, we are.

838
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:29,525
We really, really are.
We're having problems.

839
00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:31,577
When is the last time
that you...

840
00:35:31,644 --> 00:35:33,712
- Never.
- I beg your pardon?

841
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,447
We've been married four months

842
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:36,815
and we still haven't
done the deed.

843
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,784
Girlfriend,
what is up with that?

844
00:35:38,835 --> 00:35:40,169
He's hot!

845
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:41,871
You're thirty.

846
00:35:41,955 --> 00:35:43,455
I haven't felt comfortable.

847
00:35:43,506 --> 00:35:46,842
- So...
- Well, what is it that you do?

848
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:49,261
Um, okay...

849
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:50,495
So we cuddle a lot.

850
00:35:50,547 --> 00:35:51,547
- A lot.
- A lot.

851
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:52,831
- We cuddle too much.
- Oh, well, no...

852
00:35:52,883 --> 00:35:54,283
- We're... We're cuddle monsters.
- Okay. Okay.

853
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:56,001
We... We watch
the <i>Housewives</i> shows,

854
00:35:56,052 --> 00:35:57,269
which are so, so racy. Racy!

855
00:35:57,337 --> 00:35:58,888
It's not like I haven't tried.
I try.

856
00:35:58,955 --> 00:35:59,855
I've made her romantic dinners.

857
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,056
I give her roses,

858
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:02,641
and every time I try
to touch her...

859
00:36:02,692 --> 00:36:04,693
(laughing)
That happens.

860
00:36:04,778 --> 00:36:06,812
I'm so sorry.

861
00:36:06,863 --> 00:36:09,698
Okay, look.
I am not a doctor, okay?

862
00:36:09,783 --> 00:36:11,367
I don't even
like doctor TV shows.

863
00:36:11,451 --> 00:36:14,519
Unless it's one of those ones
where people strap bombs

864
00:36:14,571 --> 00:36:16,989
to their chest.
Love those.

865
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,492
So I would like
to ask you a question,

866
00:36:20,543 --> 00:36:24,413
and I want you to answer it
very seriously.

867
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:28,033
Are you still in love
with Will Schuester?

868
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:29,902
You know, I was sort
of thinking the same thing,

869
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,537
but I was afraid to ask it.

870
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:33,989
- Um...
- Are you?

871
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:40,596
I feel very confused
about my feelings.

872
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:42,598
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

873
00:36:42,682 --> 00:36:44,600
No, you and your feelings
can stay at the condo,

874
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:46,151
and I'll be at the Radisson.

875
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:48,070
Thank you, Doctor.

876
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:52,491
Not a doctor.

877
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,947
Could you please,
please not tell Will about this?

878
00:36:58,031 --> 00:37:00,532
- No, of course not. Of course not.
- Okay.

879
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:02,918
- My lips are sealed.
- Okay, thank you.

880
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:05,087
Just like your legs!

881
00:37:05,171 --> 00:37:06,505
Oh. Ha. Kidding!

882
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:07,840
God. That was rude.

883
00:37:07,907 --> 00:37:09,908
Why did I say that?

884
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,094
See, a real doctor would
never have said that.

885
00:37:12,178 --> 00:37:14,096
Whew.

886
00:37:14,164 --> 00:37:15,631
(school bell ringing)

887
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:19,935
- Hi.
- Hey.

888
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,920
- Can we talk?
- But we never do that.

889
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:24,640
I know, but, um,
I wanted to thank you...

890
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:27,426
for performing that song
with me in Glee Club.

891
00:37:27,477 --> 00:37:28,610
Yeah.

892
00:37:28,695 --> 00:37:31,763
'Cause it's made me do
a lot of thinking.

893
00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:38,437
What I've realized is why
I'm such a bitch all the time.

894
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:41,824
I'm a bitch because I'm angry.

895
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:45,527
I'm angry because I have
all of these feelings...

896
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:50,215
Feelings for you...
that I'm afraid of dealing with,

897
00:37:50,283 --> 00:37:54,386
because I'm afraid of dealing
with the consequences.

898
00:37:54,454 --> 00:37:56,055
And Brittany,

899
00:37:56,122 --> 00:37:59,341
I can't go to an Indigo Girls
concert. I just can't.

900
00:37:59,426 --> 00:38:00,726
I understand that.

901
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:05,164
Do you understand what
I'm trying to say here?

902
00:38:05,231 --> 00:38:07,950
Not really.

903
00:38:11,137 --> 00:38:14,957
I want to be with you.

904
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:18,810
But I'm afraid of the talks,
and the looks.

905
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:21,480
I mean, you know what happened
to Kurt at this school.

906
00:38:21,531 --> 00:38:26,318
But, honey... If anybody were
to ever make fun of you,

907
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:28,253
you would either kick their ass

908
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:30,422
or slash them with your vicious,
vicious words.

909
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:34,126
(sniffles)
Yeah, I know. But...

910
00:38:34,177 --> 00:38:36,845
I'm so afraid of what everyone
will say behind my back.

911
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:39,498
Still, I have to accept...

912
00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:42,084
that I love you.

913
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:45,170
I love <i>you</i>.

914
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:47,639
And I don't want to
be with Sam or Finn

915
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:50,442
or any of those other guys.

916
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,977
I just want you.

917
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,698
Please say you love me back.

918
00:38:56,766 --> 00:39:01,203
- Please...
- Of course I love you. I do.

919
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:03,405
And I would totally
be with you,

920
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,723
if it weren't for Artie.

921
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:06,825
Artie?

922
00:39:06,876 --> 00:39:09,995
I love him, too.

923
00:39:10,046 --> 00:39:12,164
I don't want to hurt him,
that's not right.

924
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:13,665
I can't break up with him.

925
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:16,585
Yes, you can.
He's just a stupid boy.

926
00:39:16,669 --> 00:39:18,170
But it wouldn't be right.

927
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:20,556
Santana, you have to know...

928
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,510
If Artie and I were
to ever break up,

929
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:26,812
and I'm lucky enough
that you're still single...

930
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:29,565
Don't.

931
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:32,901
I am so yours.

932
00:39:32,986 --> 00:39:35,554
Proudly so.

933
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:38,157
Yeah, wow.

934
00:39:38,224 --> 00:39:42,227
Whoever thought that being fluid
meant you could be so stuck?

935
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:44,496
I'm sorry.
Don't...

936
00:39:44,564 --> 00:39:47,166
- Get off me.
- I'm sorry.

937
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:49,818
(school bell rings)

938
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,223
(school bell rings)

939
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,008
Nerd.

940
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,127
Whoa! Why you gotta hate?

941
00:39:58,178 --> 00:40:00,596
You joined the Celibacy Club?

942
00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:02,682
What the hell?

943
00:40:02,766 --> 00:40:04,317
I thought you and me
were an item. Lauren.

944
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:07,653
Stop. I need to talk
to you about something.

945
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,821
I realized something lately.

946
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,273
I do a lot of stupid things.

947
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,475
Once, on a dare,
I swallowed a thumbtack.

948
00:40:12,526 --> 00:40:14,077
I'm about 90% sure
it's still in there.

949
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:15,644
I don't think about
consequences.

950
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:18,197
And while I used to
think that made me cool,

951
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,116
now I just think it
makes me a loser.

952
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:23,119
I like you, Lauren.
I like wooing you.

953
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,420
Next to dropping
my afternoon deuce,

954
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:25,705
it's my favorite
part of the day.

955
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:27,656
So I'm making a change.

956
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:30,159
And if that makes
me a nerd, fine.

957
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,712
I really do have
the urge to punch you.

958
00:40:37,851 --> 00:40:41,687
If we can play footsie
in Celibacy Club, I'm in.

959
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,639
Nerd.

960
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,777
(school bell ringing)

961
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,364
I hereby call the Celibacy Club
to order.

962
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:53,149
Where's Ms. Pillsbury?

963
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,151
She decided to take
the hour she was spending here

964
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,036
to use it to fix her
sham of a marriage.

965
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,488
In the interim,
I'll be taking over.

966
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,956
Because you annoyingly
take over everything?

967
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:02,792
Because I realized that

968
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:05,495
while all of us making our
celibacy pledge is wonderful,

969
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,214
one day we're going to
fall in love with someone,

970
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:10,550
and we're going to choose
to be intimate with them.

971
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,052
Speaking of being intimate...
What's with the hickey, Quinn?

972
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,637
It's not a hickey.

973
00:41:14,704 --> 00:41:17,473
Oh, I know hickeys.
I'm a freakin' connoisseur.

974
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,708
I can make them into shapes,
like balloon animals.

975
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,645
I burnt myself this
morning with a curling iron.

976
00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:24,847
The key is to use the
curling iron in the bathtub

977
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:26,098
to keep you from getting burnt.

978
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:27,517
No.

979
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,169
<i>QUINN:
I was sure I was caught.</i>

980
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,071
(car horn honks)

981
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:33,222
What was that?

982
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:35,525
Is that your mom?

983
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,945
She's at work.
She won't be home for hours.

984
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,030
Divorce rules.

985
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,999
Come here.

986
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:48,404
Ooh!

987
00:41:48,455 --> 00:41:50,756
I'll be more careful with the
hickey placement next time.

988
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,158
This is so awesome.

989
00:41:52,226 --> 00:41:54,677
We have two months until Prom,
so we have plenty of time

990
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,379
to campaign for
Prom King and Queen.

991
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,632
But that's not all this is about,
though, right?

992
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,352
Look, I made a mistake
with Puck.

993
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,205
You should have been my first.

994
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:11,644
This is where I belong.

995
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:16,866
- With you. Okay?
- Okay.

996
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:18,317
(school bell ringing)

997
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:19,986
Hey, hot stuff.

998
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,822
Holly. Hey.

999
00:42:22,906 --> 00:42:24,490
I'm just, uh, walking through
some choreography.

1000
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,959
Got Regionals in a week,
and I just want to make sure

1001
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,295
all the dances are what
I like to call "Finn-proof."

1002
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:32,048
Oh, well, I won't keep you.

1003
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:34,600
I just, um,
just came to say good-bye.

1004
00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:37,803
I'm going over to Shawnee
Township to teach algebra.

1005
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,639
Really?

1006
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:43,792
Yeah. There were some
parent complaints.

1007
00:42:43,844 --> 00:42:45,978
Apparently, my cucumber
demonstration

1008
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,464
made it impossible
to watch <i>VeggieTales</i>

1009
00:42:48,515 --> 00:42:49,899
the same way ever again.

1010
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:53,402
I personally thought it made
watching that show hilarious.

1011
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,656
Uh, wow, I...

1012
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,475
I really don't want
to say good-bye.

1013
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:04,330
Then maybe we shouldn't.

1014
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:07,116
Teaching Santana and Brittany
how to get their Stevie Nicks on

1015
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:11,370
made me realize how
closed off I've been.

1016
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,506
I'm getting older, too.
Maybe I should try

1017
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:17,076
a relationship that lasts
more than thirty-six hours.

1018
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,346
You're serious?

1019
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,298
Plus, seeing another woman
with the hots for you

1020
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,966
kinda made me jealous...

1021
00:43:24,017 --> 00:43:26,135
- Wait, what?
- Oh, nothing.

1022
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:30,339
I know a lot about sex,
Will, but...

1023
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:33,809
Maybe it's time I learned a
little something about romance.

1024
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:40,483
Well, I don't know
if you've heard...

1025
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,321
But I happen to be
an excellent educator.

1026
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:49,375
