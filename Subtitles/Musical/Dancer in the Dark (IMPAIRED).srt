00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,520
'You're sweatin'.'

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,000
'I'm excited,
I can see it all happening.'

3
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,840
(# Piano: "These Are A Few
Of My Favourite Things")

4
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,040
A little turn. Now side to side.

5
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,320
- # Raindrops and roses...
- Other people can sing.

6
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,800
(All) # ..on kittens

7
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,000
# White copper kettles
and warm woollen mittens

8
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,960
# Brown paper packages
tied up with string

9
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,120
# These are a few
of my favourite things... #

10
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,120
- Can we talk?
- But she's fantastic.

11
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,360
- I think she sings funny.
- God!

12
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,920
- Her dancing's not great either.
- It's the first time she did it.

13
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,200
Bum bum-bum, bum bum-bum,
bum bum-bum...

14
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,680
But I had the kettle by then,
she didn't take the kettle.

15
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,760
Do you want me to...

16
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,400
No, I just want Kathy
to put it here. This is...

17
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,760
You say these words, put
your hands out and they're there.

18
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,160
(All) # These are a few
of my favourite things... #

19
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,520
Please, don't drop the props, Kathy.

20
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,280
# Cream-coloured ponies
and apple strudels

21
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,800
# Doorbells and sleigh bells
and schnitzel with noodles... #

22
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,640
(Samuel) Why are you putting it
on her head? I'm a little confused.

23
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't know... Because she's not
going to pick it up.

24
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,360
It looks like you're trying to put
a hat on her head.

25
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,040
You're fantastic. You just have
to listen to your heart, Cvalda.

26
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,960
I don't want you to call me Cvalda.

27
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,640
You're Cvalda to me.

28
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,320
Let's do some sound effects.

29
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,040
- Uh! # When the dog bites
- (All) Woof!

30
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,040
- # When the bee stings
- Ouch!

31
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,160
# When I'm feeling sad...

32
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,680
- (Selma) # When the dog bites
- Woof!

33
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,120
# When the... #

34
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,960
- I'm not barking.
- # ..I'm feeling sad

35
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,480
# And then I don't feel so bad #

36
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,920
(Applause)

37
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,360
Wait!

38
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,320
I told you no tapping
in "The Sound of Music"!

39
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,040
It needs rhythm,
like drums or something.

40
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,480
(Samuel) Everybody's doing
a great job.

41
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,280
Really.

42
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,720
- Hello, Selma. Come in. Ready?
- Yeah.

43
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,920
- OK, you know where to stand.
- Yeah.

44
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,960
Let's try this one.

45
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,200
F-E-Z-D

46
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,040
Maybe the last one.

47
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,400
D-E-F-P-O

48
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,360
I think you can work
that machine safely.

49
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,320
I'll write a note to the plant.

50
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,040
OK, thank you.

51
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,480
Bye.

52
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,200
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

53
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,320
Bye.

54
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,880
(Roar of machines)

55
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,280
# So long, farewell,
auf wiedersehen, adieu... #

56
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,120
# I'd like to stay
and taste my French champagne

57
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,680
# Ah-ha!

58
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,520
# So long, farewell,
auf wiedersehen, adieu #

59
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,440
We lost five hours cos some
idiot broke the machine.

60
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,880
- Bill's here.
- So?

61
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,240
Well, he's here with Gene.

62
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,000
That sounds like bad news.

63
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,600
What are you going to do?

64
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,280
I guess I gotta tell her, don't I?

65
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,960
# So long... #

66
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,240
You can't bring the script
to work, Selma.

67
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,120
Keep your eyes on the machine, OK?

68
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,920
Yeah.

69
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,760
Sure, sure.

70
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,160
Bill's here.

71
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,520
Bill?

72
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,480
He's here with Gene.

73
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,080
Damn.

74
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,360
Not again.

75
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,600
You gotta come right back, OK?

76
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,520
Don't be too worried.

77
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,560
We'll work this out. Here she comes.

78
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,400
(Sighs)

79
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,880
Why are you not in school?

80
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,120
When I say so you go to school.

81
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,120
Do you think I joke?
You have to study!

82
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,640
Come on, Selma, stop.

83
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,680
We talked about this, didn't we?

84
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,040
Hanging out with those
automobile thieves.

85
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,400
- So what?
- He's learning.

86
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,440
Selma, he's learning.

87
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,560
Gene, this is the most
important thing.

88
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,600
You have to go to school.

89
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,280
I-I-I can drive him back to school.

90
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,880
Since when was that your business?

91
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,920
If you need a ride home...

92
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,080
I-I don't even punch out
till another two hours.

93
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,120
- Sometimes you punch out around now.
- I never punch out early!

94
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,880
Don't need a dump!
Don't need a ride!

95
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,280
..in your little head.

96
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,800
Let's get you to school, Mr G.

97
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,160
(Train whistle)

98
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,560
Thank you, but...I'll just,
I'll just ride my bike.

99
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,360
Bye, Jeff.

100
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,800
She likes you.

101
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,760
I'm sure of it.

102
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,600
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure of it.

103
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,440
This is my punishment,
that you help me with this.

104
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,400
And you've got...

105
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,520
You've got to make your bed as well.

106
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,480
And you forgot to wrap up
the bread...two times.

107
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,960
There's no more of that.
You keep reading.

108
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,560
"So long, farewell,
auf...wiedersehen,

109

"adieu, adieu, adieu
to yieu and yieu and yieu."

110
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,280
To "yieu" and "yieu"...
What does that mean...

111
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,840
"yieu"?

112
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,480
- It's your dumb musical.
- And yieu?

113
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,040
It's German.

114
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,040
Do you think?

115
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,040
- Y-you want some more ketchup?
- No.

116
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,440
Are you tired?

117
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,760
Wh-Why should you...always
ask me so, so stupid questions?

118
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,800
Shall I show you my step?

119
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
(Metronome clicks)

120

# So long... #

122
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,640
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, Gene. Hi.

123
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,480
How's the dancin'?

124
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,160
- Oh, good, yeah.
- Yeah?

125
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,200
You want to come to me and Bill's
place and listen to some music?

126
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,960
That...that would be lovely.
But we couldn't.

127
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,000
- Come on. Come on.
- Yeah, I'll...

128
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,120
Let's go. Come on.

129
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,880
You should ask Bill about his money.

130
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Linda likes it
when we talk about that.

131
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,880
(Classical Spanish guitar)

132
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,440
You're doing a nice job of these.

133
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
How about that?

134
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,040
You have to be very careful
not to bend the card.

135
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,320
Otherwise I don't get paid for it.

136
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,800
No?!

137
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,840
That's fair, because the people
in the shops

138
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,520
would never buy it if it's bent.

139
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,520
- You wouldn't buy it if it was bent.
- That's true. No.

140
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,640
In Czechoslovakia...I saw a film

141
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,800
and they were eating candy
from a tin just like this.

142
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,520
- No (!)
- I thought to myself...

143
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,920
how wonderful it must be
in the United States.

144
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,600
(Linda) Yeah? You think
my house looks like a movie?

145
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,120
- Our house looks like a movie!
- (Bill) You look like a movie star.

146
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,560
Bill gives me a lot of money,
you know.

147
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,800
Of course, it's all that money
you inherited, Bill.

148
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,040
(Bill and Linda) That's right.

149
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,960
Hey, Selma...
(Take the rest with you.)

150
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,160
- Are you sure?
- (Go on.)

151
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,120
(Sweets rattle in tin)

152
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,800
(Whistle)

153
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,440
- (Bill) Hello.
- (Selma) Good morning.

154
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,600
Got the rent.

155
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,840
Oh, you always pay right on time.

156
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,120
Don't worry about Gene,
I'll get him to school.

157
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,400
Thank you. Thanks very much.

158
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,440
Remember your bag.

159
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,440
- (Linda) Bye.
- (Selma) Bye.

160
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,160
You're always so serious, Kathy.

161
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,160
Ah, again we start.

162
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,080
(Laughs) I don't think
inside you're serious at all.

163
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,120
I don't know.

164
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,840
- Not always.
- Cvalda.

165
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,520
- Why do you call me that?
- It's like...someone who's...

166
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,080
- What?
- Dunno, big and happy.

167
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,080
Hey! I'm not that big.
Happy, I don't know.

168
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,520
You just need someone
to pull it out.

169
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,360
# You're getting to be
a habit with me... #

170
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,760
- (Kathy) Beautiful eyes.
- (Selma) Yeah. But he's not happy.

171
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,200
How's she doing?

172
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,600
It's when she cannot keep up
and she is going to faint.

173
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,040
(Kathy) She fainted.

174
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,520
- (Man) Please, be quiet.
- She doesn't see that well.

175
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,600
- I paid good money to see this.
- So did she.

176
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,600
I love it when they dance.

177
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,600
It's a musical,
of course they're dancing!

178
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,840
- We know.
- You're so smart!

179
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,000
- Yes.
- Oh.

180
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,040
I think you made friends, Kathy.

181
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,520
Shh!

182
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,520
(Stop.)

183
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,040
(Linda) So?

184
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,160
So what did she say?

185
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
- What?
- What did she say?

186
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,360
She didn't say anything.

187
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,120
Are you trying to tell me something?

188
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,640
It's about the bike.

189
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,680
- (Selma) The bike?
- (Bill) Mmm. The bike.

190
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,760
Oh...I-I cannot give...
give Gene a bike.

191
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,720
- Is this his idea?
- (Bill) It is not.

192
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,920
- Gene?
- Yeah?

193
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,360
Did you ask them to come over?

194
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,880
No.

195
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,400
(Kathy) No, he doesn't
know anything, Selma. Frankly.

196
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,400
- Why? Have I done something?
- No.

197
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,440
I haven't got the money.

198
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,240
I'm almost the only kid in class
who doesn't have a bike.

199
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,160
I even know a boy
who's got a scooter.

200
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,000
You all know I haven't got any money.

201
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,280
All the extra money I've got...

202
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,880
The times I save up -
I send it to Grandpa.

203
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,640
Come and have a look.
Your mother is only teasing.

204
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,760
Look what she's brought for you!

205
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,240
It's a bike!

206
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,240
- (Selma) We can't accept that.
- (Kathy) It's not new.

207
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,080
I can't give him any expensive things
- not even for his birthday.

208
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,560
He's just gotta accept
I'm not that sort of mum.

209
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,600
I-I-I'm just not
that kind of mother, G-Gene...

210
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,880
Can't you be that kind of a mother?

211
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,000
It's not exactly a scooter.

212
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,520
We'll see.

213
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,680
- (Kathy) Careful! Careful!
- (Linda) Don't ride so fast!

214
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,720
(Bill) Gene, bring it over here.

215
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,120
- He looks very happy.
- (Bill) He does look happy.

216
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,960
(Kathy) Here he comes again.
Attention!

217
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,200
(Bill) Bring it over here.

218
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,120
- Mom?
- OK.

219
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,280
(Kathy) Did you hear that?

220
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,840
- (Gene) Did you say OK?
- (Kathy laughs) Yeah.

221
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,840
- (Bill) She said OK?
- (Linda) Yeah.

222
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,160
- But promise to go to school.
- Yes, yes.

223
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,680
Every day...on time.

224
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,880
I didn't know
you were such a good biker.

225
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,280
(Jeff) Rust and women are the same.

226
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,560
Rust and women are the same?

227
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,480
Yeah, I'm just saying...

228
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,160
- Your father said that.
- Yeah.

229
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,720
I didn't know what it meant.

230
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,560
(All laugh)

231
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,440
He is so kind. Look at me...

232
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,520
He did all the work.
He's really kind.

233
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,520
Thank you, Jeff.

234
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,080
(Jeff) You're welcome.

235
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,960
Come in.

236
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,600
Something up, Bill?

237
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,680
No. I just couldn't sleep,
that's all.

238
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,400
I have no money.

239
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,440
All the money that I inherited is...
It's gone.

240
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,840
And Linda...

241
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,640
Ah, Linda.

242
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,640
She just spends and spends.

243
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,880
And my salary is nowhere near enough.

244
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,840
I can't say no to her.

245
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,280
The bank is going to repossess
the house...

246
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,760
because I'm so far behind
on the payments.

247
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,640
And I'm going to lose Linda.

248
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,680
I know it.

249
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,280
I know I am.

250
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,920
She loves you, Bill.

251
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,840
(Bill sobs)

252
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,680
Ah, don't cry.

253
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,160
I shouldn't have told you.

254
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,200
- Don't worry. It's OK.
- I shouldn't have.

255
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,040
No, I think you've got...
enough stuff...

256
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,680
Would it make you feel better
if I told you a secret?

257
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,720
What could you tell me?

258
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,080
I'm going blind.

259
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,520
Not yet, but...soon.

260
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,840
Maybe sometime this year.

261
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,160
Blind?

262
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,040
It's not as bad as it sounds.

263
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,760
It's a...

264
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,360
It's a family thing.

265
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,560
- But blind?
- I've always known it.

266
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,240
From...from...
I was a little girl, I knew.

267
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,080
(Sniffs)

268
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
And you're OK?

269
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,760
Well, I came to America,

270
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,080
because in America they can give
Gene an operation, you know?

271
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,600
Gene?

272
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,120
But, he doesn't know about it.

273
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,800
You mustn't tell him
because then it could get worse.

274
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,080
I just have to save up money,
you know. Enough money to...

275
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,120
Oh, I almost got it.

276
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,680
To, um... For the operation.

277
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,320
They can operate on Gene
when he turns 13.

278
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,360
You made up that story
about your father?

279
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,560
I never had a father.
I made up his name too.

280
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,600
That's why you put in all these
hours and do everything you do.

281
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,160
For him? For his operation?

282
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,280
Well, it is my fault...I guess.

283
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,680
How is it your fault?

284
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,520
Because I knew he would...
he would have bad eyes like me.

285
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,880
But I had him all the same.

286
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,440
You're very strong.

287
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,280
I'm not strong.

288
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,040
I've got little games I play
when it goes really hard.

289
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,400
When I'm working in the factory...

290
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,440
and the machines,
they make these...rhythms.

291
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,680
And I just start dreaming
and it all becomes music.

292
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,360
- You like movies, don't you?
- I love them.

293
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,720
- Yeah?
- I just love the musicals.

294
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,160
- When they're all tap-dancing?
- All of them tap-dancing.

295
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,840
All of them in those huge long lines.

296
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,040
I... Wouldn't you like
to be in that line?

297
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,160
- Yeah.
- Just kicking your feet.

298
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,840
Yeah.

299
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,560
When they're like spiralling up
the huge enormous wedding cakes.

300
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,760
- Yeah, yeah.
- To the top?

301
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,800
Isn't it annoying when they
do the last song?

302
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,240
Why?

303
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,520
You know when it goes really big

304
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,000
and the camera goes, like,
out of the roof

305
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,760
and you just know it's going to end.

306
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,720
I hate that. I really hate that.

307
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,880
I used to cheat when I was
a little girl in Czechoslovakia.

308
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,640
I would leave the cinema just
after the next to last song.

309
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,680
And the film
would just go on forever.

310
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,720
- It's lovely, isn't it?
- It is lovely.

311
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,200
- Selma?
- Yeah?

312
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,280
Thank you for telling me your secret.

313
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,400
Thanks for telling me yours.

314
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,840
Mum's the word, right?

315
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,560
Mum?

316
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,600
- We don't tell anybody.
- Oh, yes.

317
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,760
(Selma) I won't tell anyone.

318
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,800
Good night.

319
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,080
Thank you.

320
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,440
So, can I get you another?

321
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,280
Yeah, sure.

322
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,280
- How about a big one?
- How many is there in a big one?

323
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,320
Ten thousand.

324
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,720
I'll have a big one.

325
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,440
(Man) What's this guy's name again?

326
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,320
(Kathy and Selma) Who?

327
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,360
The old man - the guy we're
carding these pins for?

328
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,800
Her father? I know. Oldrich, right?

329
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,240
Yeah.

330
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,880
Oldrich Novy.
He used to dance in Prague.

331
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,200
You commies make a big deal
out of sharing everything.

332
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,880
Yeah, it's a good thing.

333
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,920
What are you doing here,

334
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,760
if Czechoslovakia is so much
better than the US of A?

335
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,960
No, Selma, no!

336
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,120
There are two plates.

337
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,800
It's all right.

338
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,720
You know what happens when you put
two plates in, don't you?

339
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,760
Well, she didn't. It didn't..

340
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,800
You destroy the tool!

341
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,760
Takes a whole day to mend.
Never two plates, Selma!

342
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,360
You cheated the doctor.
You shouldn't be working here.

343
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,920
How dare you! How much can you see?

344
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,720
We could do it with our eyes closed.

345
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,160
No.

346
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,640
It's just because I was daydreaming.

347
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,560
Daydreaming? Dreaming about what?

348
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,280
- I just hear music.
- Come on, Selma. Music?

349
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,120
You could cut off your hand.
You have to watch out.

350
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,440
Promise me you'll stay awake.

351
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,720
I promise I will stop daydreaming.

352
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,280
No, you're not really,
you repeat but...

353
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,120
I don't know why I bother that much.

354
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,280
(Car engine)

355
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,320
(Jeff) Hi, Selma.

356
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,640
If you're not going with Kathy
can I give you a lift?

357
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,760
I don't want a boyfriend.
I-I told you.

358
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,560
You're a really nice guy,
Jeff, but...

359
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,640
I just don't have time
for a boyfriend.

360
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,680
Not right now.

361
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,960
I know.

362
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,760
If I wanted a boyfriend,
it would be you, Jeff.

363
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,320
I just don't want one right now.

364
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,120
No problem, you know - on the
back - to have the bike there.

365
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,960
Yeah.

366
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,680
Bye, Jeff.

367
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,960
I don't think it's very safe,

368
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,040
riding the bike wearing glasses
and all.

369
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,600
- Selma?
- Bye, Jeff.

370
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,960
(Jeff) Are you OK?

371
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,680
Yeah, I'm fine.

372
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,960
- Hi, Selma.
- Hi, Bill.

373
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,720
- Heading home?
- Oh, yes.

374
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Wanna throw that in the back?

375
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,960
That would be lovely. Yes, please.

376
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,920
- Hi, Jeff.
- Hey, did you see the truck?

377
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,360
No.

378
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,680
Like, driving like crazy.

379
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,480
- He what?
- He was driving like crazy.

380
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,920
Getting dirty.

381
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,560
Thank you.

382
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,720
- (Selma) Bye, Jeff.
- Bye. Thank you, Bill.

383
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,840
- OK?
- (Bill) OK.

384
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,520
If I could make the next payment,
I'd have a bit more time.

385
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,160
Yeah.

386
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,080
All I need is a loan.

387
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,000
Just be a month.

388
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,720
This money's Gene's.

389
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,400
- I'm sorry, Bill.
- I shouldn't have asked.

390
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,960
Don't worry,
there's no harm in asking.

391
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,760
No, I shouldn't have asked.
Linda wants new couches.

392
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,120
Huh.

393
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,360
I could always shoot myself.

394
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,680
You mustn't say things like that.

395
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,800
It'd just...make things easier.

396
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,920
- You know that, Bill?
- No, Selma...

397
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,120
- You mustn't say those things.
- I'm kidding.

398
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,840
Hi, Selma. Come on in. Hi, Gene.

399
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,400
- Good morning.
- Hi.

400
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,920
- (Linda) How are you?
- (Selma) Fine, thank you.

401
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,440
- (Gene) Can I see the gun?
- (Linda) Yeah, go on.

402
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,240
- He's got a gun?
- Sure, he's a police officer.

403
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,840
Just didn't know he'd keep
it here, in the house.

404
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,960
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Keeps it in his desk.

405
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,160
Maybe I should pay more rent.

406
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,200
It's been the same
since I've been here.

407
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,400
No, Selma. I won't hear it.

408
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,240
You keep your money,
you need it more than we do.

409
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,400
Two boxes?

410
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,320
You are going to do two boxes
at the same time now?

411
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,880
- Yeah.
- Selma, ten o'clock, then?

412
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,920
Yeah, ten o'clock.

413
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,160
What happens at ten o'clock?

414
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,080
I'm gonna do the night shift.

415
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,680
The night shift? You can hardly
see enough to do your own shift.

416
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,720
It suits me fine.
It's just after drama class.

417
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,240
You are going to do that too?

418
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,000
I've had my fill of you.
Do what you want.

419
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,360
Go ahead! Break your neck.
You do your night shift.

420
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,600
But don't think
I'm going to come rescue you.

421
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,120
(Jeff) Selma.

422
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,000
Kathy split already.

423
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,920
I'm not looking for Kathy.
I was looking for you.

424
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,520
Just have to go to a drama rehearsal.

425
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,800
What do you say?

426
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,360
You always ride your bike.
You have it over there.

427
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,680
I...I left it at home. I thought
it would be quicker if I walk.

428
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,120
How do you reckon that?

429
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,600
I'd just walk along
the railroad tracks.

430
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,880
It's, a...short cut.

431
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,480
I don't understand, in musicals...

432
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,640
why do they start to sing
and dance all of a sudden?

433
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,960
I mean, I don't suddenly start
to sing and dance.

434
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,800
No.

435
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,400
You're right, Jeff. You don't.

436
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,640
The last thing on the list
is the bake sale.

437
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,680
Two Sundays away.

438
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,840
- Hi, Selma. Come on in.
- Hi.

439
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,280
I'm gonna introduce you
to your understudy.

440
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,960
- My...my understudy?
- Yeah.

441
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,720
This girl, Suzan, whom Boris knows.
She's a good singer and dancer.

442
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
She'll learn your part too.

443
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:01,520
Because, say you get a cold
and...you can't do it...

444
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,000
then the show
doesn't have to stop. OK?

445
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,880
Suzan - Selma. Selma - Suzan.

446
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,640
Ah... Could you take off
your glasses?

447
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,680
I think we'll do the part
without glasses.

448
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,040
Next Sunday you will see both Marias.

449
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,480
I mean Selma will do the role, but
I'll have you read too. All right?

450
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,360
It's your first night shift, right?

451
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,360
While this is being pressed,
you'll be cutting here.

452
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,400
That means you'll be in charge
of two machines.

453
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,160
You have to feed Sarah
over there, right?

454
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,200
This palette must never be empty.

455
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,240
- Is it always so dark in here?
- What?

456
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,040
It's exactly the same as the daytime.

457
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,480
But you have to work a little faster.

458
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,000
- That's what we're paid for. OK?
- Thank you.

459
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,960
Excuse me. You have to work,
you know, a little faster.

460
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,880
OK.

461
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,480
What are you doing here?

462
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,520
What do you think?

463
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,320
I didn't put you down
for the night shift, Kathy.

464
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,640
Run along, Norman.
I'm on my own time now.

465
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,280
How I spend it is my own business.

466
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,360
- Night, ladies!
- Good night.

467
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,240
Faster. A little faster.

468
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,920
I like it better when you dance.

469
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,680
You should dance more, Cvalda.

470
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,840
I will when there is music.

471
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,000
(Machines begin working in rhythm)

472
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,880
# Clatter, crash, clack

473
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,640
# Racket, bang, thump

474

00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,560

(Kathy) Selma!
Stop it you've cut yourself!

523
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,640
Get away from the machine. Henry!

524
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,680
Oh, Jeff is here.

525
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,760
- Hello, Jeff.
- Hi, Kathy.

526
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,800
Do you live here?

527
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,080
She might say yes to a ride
when it's this late.

528
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,240
Maybe Kathy...wants a ride.

529
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,480
No, it's all right.

530
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,920
What's that on your hand?

531
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,640
- She cut her...
- Cut my finger.

532
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,360
- It's going to be all right.
- The plates are sharp.

533
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,720
- Good night.
- Careful.

534
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,200
(Birds twittering)

535
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,920
I think I found a solution
to my problem.

536
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,120
That makes me really happy.

537
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,800
It's nothing special.

538
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,680
But I've made up my mind
I'm gonna tell Linda.

539
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,640
I mean, after all,
she loves me, and...

540
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,040
We'll just work it out together.

541
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,520
That sounds like
a really good idea, Bill.

542
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,920
Sorry. I'll let you get to bed.

543
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,560
I guess I'm kinda tired.
Thanks, Bill.

544
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,600
- Good night, Selma.
- Good night, Bill.

545
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,480
Bill?

546
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,200
What's happening now?

547
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,720
(Samuel) Here we go.
Selma, are you ready?

548
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,080
# So long, farewell,
auf wiedersehen, goodbye

549
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,440
# I hate to go
and leave this pretty sight... #

550
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,960
(Samuel) And...

551
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,000
You're on.

552
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,640
(Samuel) Cut, cut.
Stop, stop, please.

553
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,360
(Samuel) This is
Selma's entrance, OK? Yeah?

554
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,160
OK, Paul, please.

555
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,760
(All) # ..an absurd little bird... #

556
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,400
How far do you think it is?

557
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,880
I don't know.

558
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,240
(All) # So long, farewell,
auf wiedersehen, goodbye... #

559
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,800
(Samuel) And...

560
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,280
Kathy, what are you doing?
This is Maria's entrance.

561
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,320
Yes, I'm sorry. It's my mistake.

562
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,320
Please, I don't have all night.

563
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,160
- Six steps.
- OK.

564
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,000
(Samuel) Good.

565
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,640
OK, I'm thinking maybe, Selma,

566
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,320
you could take a little circle
around Boris on this next part.

567
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,800
Unless you have something else
you want to suggest.

568
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,600
I'm open.

569
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,120
OK?

570
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,080
- Samuel?
- Yes?

571
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,000
I need to talk to you.

572
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,400
If it's about the drummer,
I have been looking everywhere...

573
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,240
- I promised you...
- It's not about the drummer.

574
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,280
- Just a quick word.
- Do you wanna go outside?

575
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,360
- Yeah.
- OK.

576
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,440
(All) # And up in the nursery
an absurd little bird

577
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,160
# Is popping out to say cuckoo

578
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,560
I'm...I'm not gonna play Maria.

579
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,040
What?

580
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,560
My heart just isn't in this,

581
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,840
like, I shouldn't be wasting
my time on something...

582
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,880
that isn't that important, really.

583
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:18,440
I've been watching Suzan
and she's...she's great.

584
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,680
She's...she's a much better
dancer than I am.

585
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,080
Suzan's terrific,
I'm not denying that.

586
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,240
But, you... I thought
you lived for musicals.

587
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,360
So you've been pretending
the whole time?

588
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,080
Yes, I've just been pretending.

589
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,280
I don't know what else...
Everything's cast now.

590
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,120
Yeah.

591
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,960
The only part that's left
is the old nun.

592
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,800
I don't think you'd want
that part. There's no dancing.

593
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,280
She's quite serious, then?

594
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,240
She's serious, yeah.
It's important for the part.

595
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:59,400
And not dancing, really. No.

596
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,120
I could put a little dancing
in there.

597
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,440
You think so?

598
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,320
I didn't have it in mind.

599
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,760
You can have your tapping.

600
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,320
She could be just a little
humorous once in a while.

601
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,640
Even though she's a nun.

602
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,360
You'll always be my perfect Maria.

603
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,480
Where are all the hairpins today?

604
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,520
I left them at home.

605
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,120
And she won't be playing Maria.

606
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,320
What will I do
if I can't bawl you out

607
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,880
for learning your lines
on company time?

608
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,200
One...two...three!

609
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,520
What kind of a joke is that?

610
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,160
- I need a word with you.
- We're talking now.

611
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,920
All right. Come on.

612
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,560
Please, sit down.

613
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,960
We were off for the whole day.

614
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,400
Everything stops when the
machine breaks, you know that.

615
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:17,400
I-I can do my job just fine
if I stick to the day shift.

616
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,880
This won't happen again.

617
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,360
I-I daydream too much.

618
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,000
I-I decided to quit.

619
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,240
I guess, then, I forgot.

620
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,080
I've been ordered
to let you go, Selma.

621
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,800
You don't have to pay for the machine
you broke. I got them to agree.

622
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,840
Thanks, Norman.

623
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,520
This is your, ah...salary.

624
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,280
And you know, ah...

625
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,000
maybe we can find you something
away from the machines...

626
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,920
where your eyesight
wouldn't matter so much.

627
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,560
- Not right away.
- That's very kind.

628
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,160
But, um, I'll be OK.

629
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,200
I-I really will.

630
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,520
- Thanks, Norman.
- Thank you, Selma.

631
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,440
Thank you.

632
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,880
What is she going to do now?!
Did you ever think about that?!

633
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,920
Don't worry, Kathy, really.
I'm going to be fine.

634
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,480
Has anybody seen Jeff today?

635
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,160
He's usually here early, Selma.
But not this early.

636
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,440
That's a shame.

637
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,600
Selma!

638
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,680
Selma.

639
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,560
I could give you a lift if you want.

640
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,200
I-I will need a lift...later.

641
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,880
I need to do something important
at, ah...three.

642
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,840
You need to get your truck,
then, don't you?

643
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,880
Yeah.

644
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,960
(Whistle)

645
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,720
Train's coming.
Get off the track, Jeff.

646
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,080
You have to be careful.

647
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,160
Stick to the side.

648
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,520
You can't see, can you?

649
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,560
What is there to see?

650
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,200
(Whistle)

651
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,360
(Rhythmical clacking
of train on tracks)

652
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,680
# I've seen it all

653
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,040
# I have seen the trees

654
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,640
# I have seen the willow leaves

655
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,360
# Dancing in the breeze

656
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:52,080
# I've see a man killed
by his best friend

657
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:58,320
# And lives that were over
before they were spent

658
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,600
# I've seen what I was

659
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,000
# And I know what I'll be

660
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:11,280
# I've seen it all -
there is no more to see

661
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:39,360
# You haven't seen elephants,
kings or Peru

662
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:46,320
# I'm happy to say
I have better to do

663
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,280
# What about China?

664
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,400
# Have you seen the Great Wall?

665
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,920
# All walls are great
if their roof doesn't fall

666
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,080
# And the man you will marry

667
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,400
# The home you will share?

668
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,360
# To be honest, I really don't care

669
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:38,960
# You've never been to Niagara Falls

670
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,640
# I have seen water

671
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,880
# It's water, that's all

672
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,960
# The Eiffel Tower, the Empire State

673
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:56,960
# My pulse was as high
on my very first date

674
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:03,720
# Your grandson's hand
as he plays with your hair

675
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:10,000
# To be honest, I really don't care

676
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,360
# I've seen it all

677
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,320
# I have seen the dark

678
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:43,480
# I have seen the brightness
in one little spark

679
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:49,720
# I have seen what I choose
and seen what I need

680
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:56,360
# And that is enough,
to want more would be greed

681
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,120
# I've seen what I was

682
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,680
# And I know what I'll be

683
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:08,800
# I've seen it all -
there is no more to see

684
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:24,400
(Workmen) # You've seen it all
and all you have seen

685
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:30,000
# You can always review
on your own little screen

686
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:36,560
# The light and the dark,
the big and the small

687
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:42,320
# Just keep in mind
you need no more at all

688
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:49,040
# You've seen what you were
and know what you'll be

689
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:54,200
# You've seen it all,
there is no more to see #

690
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,080
(Music stops, train keeps beat)

691
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,160
(Jeff) You can't see, can you?

692
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,440
See you at three.

693
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,200
I can see.

694
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,120
Gene hasn't come back yet.

695
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,560
I need to talk to Bill.

696
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:28,600
He decided to take the day off
to go to the bank for his box.

697
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,040
Is he...is he upstairs?

698
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,920
I know everything, Selma.
Bill told me.

699
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,400
I want you to move out.

700
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,680
I don't understand. What do you know?

701
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,920
That you came on to him.

702
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,600
That you asked him into the trailer,
but he turned you down.

703
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,720
You've got nothing
to say for yourself?!

704
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,840
No. I want to talk to Bill.

705
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,520
(Record has finished playing)

706
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,560
Hi, Bill.

707
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:40,960
Linda saw me go up to the, um...
up to the trailer.

708
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,640
I told her it was you
who wanted to...

709
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,200
That you'd... That you'd fallen
in love with me.

710
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,960
I know. She told me.

711
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,240
And what did you tell her?

712
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,400
Nothing.

713
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,080
You didn't tell her I was lying?

714
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,320
Mum's the word, right?

715
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,600
Linda told me you went to the bank.

716
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,120
I went to the bank
to ask for more time.

717
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:26,720
But I couldn't do it
and I brought the box home instead.

718
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:32,200
Linda always gets so proud when she
sees me sitting in here with it.

719
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,040
But you've put my money in it,
haven't you?

720
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,000
To make it look like it's yours.

721
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:55,200
But it's my money, Bill.
I'm gonna have to take it.

722
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,960
You can have it back.

723
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,320
Y-You can...
you can have it back in a month.

724
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,080
But I can't do that, Bill.

725
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,640
Selma...

726
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:18,160
I-I've decided to...
to pay the doctor this afternoon.

727
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,480
I can't save up more money.
That's over now.

728
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,480
Gene doesn't even turn thirteen
until after Christmas.

729
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:40,120
There was $2,026
and ten cents in the tin.

730
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,280
I can't count it now,
but I trust you.

731
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:51,080
And it's thirty dollars
I got today...

732
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,160
which makes it...

733
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:59,920
2,056...ten cents.

734
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,960
It's not enough...

735
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,960
but it'll have to do.

736
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,080
- Selma.
- Bye, Bill.

737
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,520
Selma.

738
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,160
Selma, stop.

739
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,200
I'm pointing my gun at you, Selma.

740
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,720
I don't believe you.

741
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:32,520
You're just trying to scare me.
I can't see a gun.

742
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:38,680
Just feel this.
Feel this. Feel it. Feel it!

743
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,640
(Selma sobs)

744
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,280
Do you believe I have the gun?

745
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:46,760
I believe you. But it's my money.

746
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,920
No, it's my money.
It's the money I had in MY box

747
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,520
and you're trying
to steal it from me.

748
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,560
Selma! Selma!

749
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:00,920
SELMA! STOP! SELMA, STOP!
LINDA! LINDA! LINDA!

750
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,160
What's the matter, Bill?

751
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,520
She was trying to steal our money.

752
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,360
She knew I had the gun
in my drawer and she...

753
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,000
Is that why you wanted him?
For the money?

754
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,600
Run to the car and get my handcuffs.

755
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,640
Go get the handcuffs.

756
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,000
Give me the money.

757
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,480
(Give me the money.)

758
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,040
(Gimme the money
and I'll let you go.)

759
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,120
Where should I go?

760
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,880
(Just gimme the money.)

761
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,960
(Selma, just gimme the money.)

762
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,120
Gimme the money. Give me...

763
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,560
No! No! No!

764
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,200
(Gunshot)

765
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,800
(Selma cries)

766
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,440
You shot me.

767
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,240
I'm gonna...

768
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,640
No, no, Selma,
you did the right thing.

769
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,240
I should have done it myself.

770
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,800
Kill me.

771
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,000
Just kill me.

772
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:24,920
Be my friend and show some
mercy, please, and just kill me.

773
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,720
You handcuffs aren't in the car.

774
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,440
Show some mercy, Selma, and just...

775
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,840
Linda, run. Run up to Miller's farm.

776
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,120
Call the station
and tell them to hurry.

777
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,840
RUN! GET UP THERE!
Go to Miller's farm!

778
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,120
If you want the money...

779
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,160
(Breathes heavily)

780
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,120
You're going to have to kill me.

781
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,400
Don't do this to me.

782
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,240
(Selma cries)

783
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,600
Don't do this to me.

784
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,040
I'm not letting go.

785
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,080
No.

786
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:24,120
Just shoot me. Just shoot me.
Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me!

787
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,040
(Gunshot)

788
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,240
(Bill shouts and gasps)

789
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:42,240
Can't you just stand up
and pull the goddamn trigger!

790
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,920
(Sobbing) I want to take my money.

791
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,360
(Music starts)

792
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:32,600

# Does it hurt?

798
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,520
# I hurt you much more

799
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,600

Selma?

844
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,360
Jeff.

845
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,440
What are you doing here?

846
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,920
Is it already three?

847
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,360
Well, not really.
But, hell, I'm always early.

848
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,960
You cut yourself again.

849
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,520
There's some blood on your blouse.

850
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,400
Strange.

851
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,080
I couldn't feel it at all.

852
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,400
(Sirens)

853
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,880
Selma?

854
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,040
We're here now.

855
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,880
By the bus stop?

856
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,880
Yeah, the bus stop.

857
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,400
It's over there.

858
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,440
And the lake is here.

859
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:16,320
Promise me that you won't
follow me. Promise.

860
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,600
Yeah, I promise.

861
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,440
(Speaks Czech)

862
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,360
I would like to pay for
the operation now.

863
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,320
2,056 dollars and ten cents.

864
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:23,680
I know it's not quite
what you told me, but...

865
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,600
But it's all I could get together.

866
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:35,360
What last name
shall I put on the receipt?

867
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:39,600
Oh, I don't need a receipt,
I really don't.

868
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,880
I have to know the name of your son

869
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,560
for when he comes in
for his operation.

870
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,520
Novy.

871
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,720
He will come and he will say
that his name is Novy.

872
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:00,640
And then you will know...
that he's been paid for.

873
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,680
Novy?

874
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:07,000
Like Oldrich Novy,
the tap dancer?

875
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,680
It is strange, isn't it?

876
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,000
He never really made it
over here, did he?

877
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:16,440
I saw his films when I was a kid.

878
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,840
He was in the first musical
I ever saw.

879
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,280
Same here.

880
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,440
(Jeff) Selma?

881
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,360
(Car door slams)

882
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,560
It's Tuesday night.

883
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,240
What about your rehearsal?

884
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,560
Yeah, I guess...

885
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,560
You wanna go?

886
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,200
Yeah.

887
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:04,320
And maybe put your arm around her
and a little bit of...

888
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,000
Hi, Selma.

889
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,760
Hi, Samuel.

890
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:12,200
We weren't sure you'd show up,
actually.

891
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,920
Sure I show up.

892
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,400
Nice to see you. Be right back.

893
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,080
OK.

894
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,120
(Murmuring)

895
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,320
(She's here.)

896
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,720
(Yeah. OK. OK. OK.)

897
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,840
Uh...

898
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:51,000
OK, I think you could try it
one more time for me.

899
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:56,320
But I should... I should be going
now. Gene might wonder where I am.

900
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,280
Jeff, he hasn't seen me all day.

901
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:05,000
I think we could do your scene.
Let's do the tapping scene. OK?

902
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,040
We haven't done it in weeks.

903
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:11,880
While you're here, we might as well
take advantage of the time. Please?

904
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:15,680
Let's do the tapping scene.
Let me have the nuns up there.

905
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,280
Imagi... You do Selma's part
for her for now, all right?

906
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,680
(Piano)

907
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,640
- Like it?
- Yes.

908
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:29,480
We haven't done it for a while.

909
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:36,520
(Selma hums along)

910
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:57,880
Remember that part we did where you,
uh, you come to the convent gate?

911
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,160
To say goodbye to Maria.

912
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,200
I should leave, Jeff.

913
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:05,440
- What?
- Gene is probably worried now.

914
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,680
I haven't seen him all day.

915
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,040
I'm sorry, Samuel, but...

916
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,800
Betty, come here a second.

917
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,400
The drummer you wanted, remember?

918
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:20,080
I found somebody. She's fantastic.

919
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:24,480
She's here for the first time.
Please meet her. This is Selma.

920
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:28,320
- Hi, Betty. You play the drums?
- Yeah.

921
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,760
Tell her how long
you've been studying.

922
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,400
Two years.

923
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:36,280
She's wonderful. You've gotta
stay and enjoy this. You've...

924
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:39,480
I have an idea. Let's do the finale.

925
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:42,400
(Samuel) I just remembered,
you hate finales.

926
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,120
No finale. I've a better idea.

927
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,080
"Climb Every Mountain", part one.

928
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,600
(All) # Climb every mountain

929
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:04,800
# Ford every stream

930
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,640
(Samuel) Like Indians!

931
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:10,680
# Follow every rainbow

932
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:13,520
# Till you find your dream #

933
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:19,920
# Why do I love it so much?

934
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:29,680
# What kind of magic is this?

935
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:41,160
# How come I can't help adore it?

936
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:48,600
# It's just another musical

937
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,040
# No one minds at all

938
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,880
# If I'm having a ball

939
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:01,040
# Cos this is a musical

940
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:08,320
# And there's always someone
to catch me

941
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:14,760
# There's always someone to catch me

942
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:21,560
# There's always someone to catch me

943
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,480
# There's always someone to catch me

944
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:30,120
# When you fall #

945
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,360
(Siren)

946
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,760
The State will show...

947
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:50,560
that the defendant has not only
perpetrated the most callous

948
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:54,000
and well-planned homicide
in recent memory,

949
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:59,720
but is also a fundamentally
selfish individual

950
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:03,960
who cynically hides
behind a handicap,

951
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,960
devoid of sympathy for anybody
but herself.

952
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:12,040
This woman found trust
and friendship

953
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,960
when she sought refuge
in our country.

954
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:19,680
And the evidence will show that
she has repaid such kindness

955
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,560
with betrayal, robbery and murder,

956
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,920
inflicted upon the VERY people

957
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,360
who opened their homes
and hearts to her.

958
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,160
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

959
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,840
the evidence will prove
that she herself

960
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:39,040
did not show that mercy
she will ask of us.

961
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,680
Is this the bag here, Detective?

962
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,520
Uh...

963
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,360
Yes, the very same.
Houston's blood was all over it.

964
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:54,760
Shortly before the homicide
I had a check-up on her vision

965
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:59,200
and I found that she was myopic.
That's near-sighted.

966
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,920
Near-sighted, but she COULD see.

967
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,280
Yes.

968
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,920
She said communism
was better for human beings.

969
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,000
She had nothing but contempt
for our great country and...

970
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:18,360
Apart from its musicals. She said
the American ones were better.

971
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:20,360
So...

972
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:23,760
The defendant preferred
Hollywood to Vladivostok.

973
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:27,480
I suppose that's
an acknowledgement of sorts.

974
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:30,160
She just asked many times
about the money.

975
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,920
(DA) She wanted to know where it was.

976
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,360
That's right.

977
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:37,480
- She asked about the gun?
- Yes, she did.

978
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,240
She wanted to know where it was kept?

979
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,920
That's right.

980
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,960
Bill was lying on the floor...
and he was wounded and...

981
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,320
Um...

982
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,960
(DA) He was pleading for his life.

983
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,560
Yes.

984
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,400
"I beg you. I beg you. I beg you."

985
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,920
You showed him no mercy, Selma.

986
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:09,160
You should have no mercy either.

987
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,880
(DA) Would you state your name
for the record, please.

988
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,360
Selma Jezkova.

989
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:25,960
And Bill and Linda Houston...
were your friends. Is that right?

990
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:30,720
Yeah.

991
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,560
In fact you lived in a trailer
on their property.

992
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:39,440
Yeah.

993
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:45,040
And didn't they also take care of
your young son when you were at work?

994
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,080
Yeah.

995
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:55,680
They bought him
a birthday present recently.

996
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,720
Is that right?

997
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,920
Yeah, they got him a bike.

998
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:07,480
Right.

999
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:11,760
Your sight was poor, you claim -

1000
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,280
contrary to the expert testimony
we received.

1001
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,840
But you saw well enough

1002
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:22,560
to inflict 34 wounds on Bill Houston.

1003
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,760
So why did you kill him, actually?

1004
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,800
If I may be so bold to ask.

1005
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,560
He asked me to.

1006
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,840
He did?

1007
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,000
How intriguing.

1008
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:46,480
A man with a fine career,
some wealth and a happy marriage?

1009
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,400
Why would this Bill Houston
ask you to kill him?

1010
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,560
I promised not to say.

1011
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,760
Oh! That clears things up
immensely (!)

1012
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,960
You promised you wouldn't say.

1013
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:06,880
In that case we'll just have
to take your word for it

1014
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,360
that the money you stole was yours

1015
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,920
despite the fact that Bill
Houston's savings

1016
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
also disappeared so mysteriously
that same day.

1017
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:17,080
Just, ah....

1018
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,920
Just where did you get your money?

1019
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,960
Well...

1020
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,080
I'd been saving up.

1021
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,760
I suppose you could call it that.

1022
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,600
What were these savings
to be used for?

1023
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:39,320
You never bought your son so much as
a birthday present, as we've heard.

1024
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,680
Um...

1025
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,120
Yes?

1026
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,320
My...my father...

1027
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,840
in Czechoslovakia.

1028
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:56,920
Your father.

1029
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:01,200
And what, pray tell, is his name?

1030
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,200
My...my father is...

1031
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,040
Oldrich Novy.

1032
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:13,600
So...

1033
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,120
We're meant to believe

1034
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:20,400
that you killed Bill Houston
by inflicting 34 wounds on him

1035
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,120
because he asked you to?

1036
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,400
Just as we're meant to believe

1037
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:29,480
that you were blind when you did it.

1038
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:34,840
As we're meant to believe that it
was your savings you stole from him.

1039
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,960
Just as we're meant to believe

1040
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,480
you sent all you had
to your father back home.

1041
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,440
A man by the name of Oldrich Novy.

1042
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,480
Is that right?

1043
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,200
Yes.

1044
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:55,080
Thank you, Miss Jezkova.

1045
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:08,080
Ladies and gentlemen, you've now
heard from the defendant's lips.

1046
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:10,240
You must believe her.

1047
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,520
Just as you must believe her

1048
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:16,920
when she claims her father's name
is Oldrich Novy.

1049
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,520
Your Honour,

1050
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:22,120
at this time the State
calls to the witness stand...

1051
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,880
Oldrich Novy.

1052
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,320
(DA) Please state your full name.

1053
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,840
My name is Oldrich Novy.

1054
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:43,240
And you used to live
in Czechoslovakia.

1055
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:47,960
That is right. I live now
in California, as you know.

1056
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,080
Right. That's where we found you.

1057
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:54,480
What exactly is your relationship
to the defendant?

1058
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,480
I do not know her.

1059
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:04,600
You don't know her?

1060
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:08,720
So...you have
not received money from her?

1061
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:13,000
Money, that...that she says
was so dearly earned?

1062
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,680
No, I have not.

1063
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,720
Perhaps you're not her father, then.

1064
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,800
- No, I am not.
- No.

1065
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:25,040
Well, if this relationship
was made up by the defendant

1066
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:29,120
then can you think of any way
she might know your name?

1067
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:33,360
(Novy) I was once well-known
in Czechoslovakia

1068
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,880
because of my profession.

1069
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:38,400
Yes, and Mr Novy,
what is your profession?

1070
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:41,760
Maybe that can give us a clue
to why -

1071
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,840
why this somewhat romantic,
certainly communistic woman

1072
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:47,800
who worships Fred Astaire,
but not his country -

1073
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:51,760
why she might have lied
and misused your name -

1074
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:56,160
to make everybody think all
her money was spent on a poor father

1075
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,200
and not her own vanity?

1076
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:02,560
- What do you do?
- I was an actor. I made films.

1077
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,000
They were musicals.

1078
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,960
(Pencils tap in rhythm)

1079
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,800
(Music starts)

1080
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:18,120
# Why do I love you so much?

1081
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:26,160
# What kind of magic is there?

1082
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:32,600
# How come I can't help adore you?

1083
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:38,120
# You were in a musical

1084
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,440
# I didn't mind it at all

1085
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,560
# That you were having a ball

1086
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:49,560
# At my musical

1087
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:57,520
# And I was always there to catch you

1088
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:04,440
# You were always there to catch me

1089
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:09,840
# You were always there to catch me

1090
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:17,760
# You were always there to catch me

1091
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,880
# When I'd fall

1092
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,520
(All) # Say it again

1093
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:52,360
(Novy) # I don't mind it at all

1094
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:55,080
# If you're having a ball

1095
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:59,240
# This is your musical

1096
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:05,480
# I'll always be there to catch you

1097
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:11,200
# You will always be there
to catch me

1098
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:18,720
# I'll always be there to catch you

1099
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:24,000
# You will always be there
to catch me

1100
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:43,600
(All) # We'll always be there
to catch you

1101
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:50,040
# We'll always be there to catch you

1102
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:56,400
# We'll always be there to catch you

1103
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:03,280
# We'll always be there to catch you

1104
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,120
# When I fall #

1105
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,320
(Officer) Will the court please rise?

1106
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,680
The honourable
Judge AD Mantle presiding.

1107
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,920
Have you reached a verdict?

1108
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,120
Yes, Your Honour.

1109
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:52,320
(Officer) Will the defendant
please rise?

1110
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:05,360
We, the jury, find the defendant,
Selma Jezkova,

1111
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,760
guilty of murder in the first degree

1112
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:10,400
and hereby sentence her to death.

1113
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,280
(Judge) Is this the verdict
of this jury?

1114
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:16,360
You fully understand
that it must be unanimous?

1115
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:18,560
(Foreman) We do, Your Honour.

1116
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,120
(Judge) Selma Jezkova...

1117
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:25,080
you are hereby sentenced
to be taken from this place

1118
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:27,800
and confined
in the state penitentiary

1119
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:30,840
until such time
as you shall be executed

1120
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:34,720
by being hanged by the neck,
until you are dead.

1121
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,880
This court is adjourned.

1122
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,920
(Officer) All rise.

1123
01:38:55,400 --> 01:39:00,080
I just heard about the...
the Supreme Court decision.

1124
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:04,440
Yeah, I...I just want to talk
practical stuff.

1125
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,840
On Gene's birthday...

1126
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,240
he will receive a letter.

1127
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:21,000
And it's so important, Kathy,
that he reads it very carefully.

1128
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:24,360
I need you to take care of that
for me.

1129
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:28,160
Because I'm not going to be there
when he gets it.

1130
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:32,520
He should not be afraid, because
there's nothing to be afraid of.

1131
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:36,280
Listen, Gene wants
to see you so badly.

1132
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:38,880
Won't you let him? Please.

1133
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:44,720
There's nothing for him to see.

1134
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,440
He's got you now, Kathy.

1135
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:53,720
And there's one more thing.

1136
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,960
He has to call himself Novy.

1137
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:58,360
That's very important.

1138
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:03,880
- All right. Time's up, Selma.
- I know it sounds foolish.

1139
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:08,120
Sorry I didn't tell you before
about this, I didn't dare to

1140
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,680
because they would ruin everything.

1141
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:13,560
But why does he have to call
himself Novy?

1142
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:15,560
Stop asking those questions, Cvalda.

1143
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:19,760
Please, let me tell Gene hello,
from you to him.

1144
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,320
No.

1145
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:44,400
I know you love your son very much.

1146
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,400
I love him very much.

1147
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:53,800
Got a boy of my own back home.

1148
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,160
You never told me that.

1149
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:08,440
- Good night, Brenda.
- Good night.

1150
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:11,160
Say hi to your son from me.

1151
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:15,080
Thank you, Selma.

1152
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:11,480
Can I help you?

1153
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:14,680
Did you once have a patient called...

1154
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:16,720
Jezkova?

1155
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,760
Selma Jezkova?

1156
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:23,400
Well, if it wasn't too long ago,
I can check my records.

1157
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:28,600
Jez...Jez...Jez...

1158
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:31,480
Sorry, there's no one here
by that name.

1159
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:39,160
What about Novy?

1160
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:43,800
- I have good news for you.
- What's that?

1161
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:48,400
We found a new lawyer and he is
going to get your case reopened.

1162
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:51,240
He says your lawyer was incompetent.

1163
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,960
W-what do you mean?

1164
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:59,520
Well, the case is going
to be reopened.

1165
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:02,000
You won't get the death sentence.

1166
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:07,920
- Is that true?
- Yes. New information has turned up.

1167
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,160
What information?

1168
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:15,560
We know the whole story, Selma.
Why didn't you tell us anything?

1169
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:19,520
You know, about...about the money
for Gene's operation.

1170
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,280
How did you find out?

1171
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:26,920
Well, Jeff talked to the doctor.

1172
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,840
Does...does Gene know?

1173
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:34,960
Have you told Gene?

1174
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:39,520
No. No, I didn't. But you've got
a much better case now.

1175
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,080
That's very important, Kathy.

1176
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:46,320
His eyes might get worse
from worrying.

1177
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:49,120
And then the operation won't work.

1178
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:53,800
Yes, Selma, but don't you see,
it would help you if they knew

1179
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:58,160
that you were trying to save
your son from going blind.

1180
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:01,440
The lawyer will come
in two weeks' time.

1181
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:05,160
Kathy, by then... You know
they're hanging me in one week.

1182
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:08,760
We know, but he says
you can apply for a stay.

1183
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:11,560
Most cases get one the first time.

1184
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,720
Well, you can smile.

1185
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:21,840
- Selma?
- Yeah... It's just too much for me.

1186
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:28,440
I thought I was strong.
I just can't take it, Kathy.

1187
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:30,560
Apply for a stay.

1188
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:44,280
What if they don't phone?

1189
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,760
Ah, well, you'll be transferred
to the other...

1190
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:52,600
cell block at some point tomorrow.

1191
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:58,120
That's the cell block
where they hang people?

1192
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:04,960
Yeah, that's where they...
spend the last day.

1193
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:11,440
And then they do their 107 steps
that's from that room...

1194
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,680
to the gallows, isn't it?

1195
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:18,520
That's what they say, Selma, but...

1196
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:21,800
Look, it...
You're gonna get your stay.

1197
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:25,720
Why don't you try to think
of somethin' nice, all right?

1198
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:31,160
It's just so quiet here.

1199
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:36,240
What's that got to do with it, Selma?

1200
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:43,360
You know, when I used to work
in the factory,

1201
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,160
I used to dream
that I was in a musical.

1202
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:52,640
Because in a musical
nothing dreadful ever happens.

1203
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,800
But it's so quiet here.

1204
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:03,480
Don't the prisoners march
or something?

1205
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:07,120
March? No. No, they don't...
they don't... There's not...

1206
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:11,880
There's not much noise
around here, Selma, I know.

1207
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:16,600
But later they turn on the radio.

1208
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,520
No, no, no. There's no...

1209
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:22,880
They don't allow radio
in the isolation block, Selma.

1210
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:27,320
But I've been listening
to the ventilation shaft.

1211
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:32,040
I hear sometimes people
singing there, like...

1212
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:35,040
hymns, or...

1213
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:38,080
It's not against the rules
to listen, is it?

1214
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:41,160
No.

1215
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:43,960
I wonder if...

1216
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:47,680
if maybe you're hearing the singing
coming from the chapel.

1217
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,320
Yeah?

1218
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:54,680
- Maybe you'll even get a sermon.
- Yeah?

1219
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:44,240
(Choir singing)

1220
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:23,400
# Raindrops...and roses

1221
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:30,280
# And whiskers on kittens... #

1222
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,280
(Sniffs)

1223
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:45,680
(Crying) # Raindrops and roses
and whiskers on kittens... #

1224
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:49,280
(Sniffs)

1225
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:52,160
(Clears throat)

1226
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:58,400
# Bright copper kettles
and warm woollen mittens

1227
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:03,920
# Brown paper packages
tied up with string... #

1228
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,400
(Ghostly humming
continues in background)

1229
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:17,840
# These are the few
of my favourite things... #

1230
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,840
(Sighs deeply)

1231
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:37,720
# Cream-coloured ponies

1232
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:44,160
# And crisp apple strudels

1233
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:50,680
# Doorbells and sleigh bells and...

1234
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:55,480
# Schnitzel with noodles

1235
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:02,720
# Wild geese that fly
with the moon on their...wings

1236
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:08,320
# These are the few
of my favourite things

1237
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,200
# When the bee stings

1238
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:12,320
# When the dog bites

1239
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:16,600
# When I'm feeling bad

1240
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:24,200
# I simply remember
my favourite things

1241
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:32,640
# And then I don't feel so sad #

1242
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:40,080
Selma.

1243
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:42,640
Selma.

1244
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:45,480
You got your stay.

1245
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:47,400
You got the stay.

1246
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:52,440
I'm so happy for you.

1247
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:09,280
I'm your new legal counsel.
My name is Luke, OK?

1248
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:11,120
Hi, Luke.

1249
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:15,840
I'm quite sure I can get
your sentence commuted.

1250
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:21,520
All I need is a signature
stating you want the case reopened.

1251
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:24,680
Then I can get the paperwork
ready by tomorrow.

1252
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:32,960
There are things your other lawyer
didn't do that I'm going to do.

1253
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:36,640
A lot of ground wasn't covered
that I'm going to cover.

1254
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:41,000
The fact you were fighting for your
boy is something we can really milk.

1255
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:45,720
And I have some experience
in cases like this, so...

1256
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,920
That's what the attorney before said.

1257
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,920
Oh, yeah.

1258
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,360
You see, he was appointed
by the court.

1259
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:57,280
And you don't get the best
legal counsel that way.

1260
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:00,320
You were not appointed by the court.

1261
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:01,960
I'm not, no.

1262
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:04,280
You're gonna have to pay me.

1263
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:10,760
- But...not to worry.
- Yeah.

1264
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:14,960
That's been taken care of.
I made a deal with your lady friend.

1265
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:18,560
- Deal?
- Yeah, in regard to my fee.

1266
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:23,680
I'm going to accept the amount
that she said she could raise.

1267
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:36,760
How much... How much was it?

1268
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:39,840
I can tell you precisely
because I received an envelope.

1269
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:45,800
- It was, ah...$2,000...
- $2,056 and 10 cents?

1270
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:48,320
That's it, precisely.

1271
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:53,040
Now...ah...

1272
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:55,840
There's something here...

1273
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:01,920
Uh...I'd like to...
just sort of go over our tactics.

1274
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,520
I have a couple of questions
to ask you.

1275
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:08,200
If he doesn't have the operation
next month it'll be too late!

1276
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:10,240
He'll never be able to see!

1277
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,400
This is what it's all about.

1278
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,840
So he can see his grandchildren...

1279
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:18,840
- Let me tell you...
- It's the only thing that matters!

1280
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:21,240
You don't understand, Kathy.

1281
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:24,680
It's plain stupidity
to waste that kind of money

1282
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:27,680
on a blind woman in jail.

1283
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:30,440
But he needs his mother!
No matter where!

1284
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:32,960
You don't understand!
He needs his eyes.

1285
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:34,640
- He needs his mother.
- NO!

1286
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,080
- Yes, alive...
- NO!

1287
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:39,320
Listen to reason for once, Selma.

1288
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:43,000
- Selma...
- I listen to my heart.

1289
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:48,320
I will go to the police, I will tell
them you stole the money from Bill.

1290
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:51,360
I will say that.
I will tell them that.

1291
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:55,400
That you stole it from Bill.
Then you'll never see it again.

1292
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:57,680
They will be gone for good.

1293
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:00,000
No parachute. No mother. Nothing!

1294
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:11,720
You can have your money back.

1295
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,960
I just want to make sure

1296
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:19,160
you fully comprehend
what this means - this decision.

1297
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:21,280
- Yeah.
- You realise what will happen?

1298
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:25,440
Yeah. I've already
asked for no more stays.

1299
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:29,720
Once this starts there's no
stopping it, do you understand?

1300
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:31,560
Yeah.

1301
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,240
I'm prepared.

1302
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:39,760
(Walkie talkie)

1303
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,160
Gene says thank you.

1304
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,720
Thanks for what?

1305
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:57,760
Oh, some comic book on his birthday.

1306
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:05,520
You can't buy him presents
and say it's from me.

1307
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:09,560
You're to stop doing that, Jeff.

1308
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:12,920
Maybe you can just...

1309
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:19,360
phone him.

1310
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:22,880
Just say, you know...

1311
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:25,160
something to him.

1312
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:28,000
No, that's... That's not a good idea.

1313
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:34,560
He wants to be the one...

1314
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:38,760
who's allowed to be there
when it happens.

1315
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:46,600
But I... And then they told him
he's too young.

1316
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:53,120
Who put that crazy idea
in his head anyway?

1317
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,520
I don't want him to be there.

1318
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:01,640
I'd be there if you would...

1319
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,800
And Kathy?

1320
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:12,800
You know Kathy, she's...

1321
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,440
She's still angry.

1322
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:21,120
If you think you can take it...

1323
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:25,960
I would love you to be there.

1324
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:34,760
Don't cry, Jeff.

1325
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:38,120
Jeff, don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

1326
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:41,240
Jeff?

1327
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:52,680
Why did you have him?

1328
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:57,440
You knew he would have
the same disease as you.

1329
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:09,280
I just wanted
to hold a little baby...

1330
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,040
in my arms.

1331
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:24,480
I love you.

1332
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,320
It's time, Selma.

1333
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:23,640
OK?

1334
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:28,200
OK.

1335
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,080
Your meal, Jezkova.

1336
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:08,080
(Rattling of keys)

1337
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,880
(Footsteps)

1338
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:23,040
(Key in lock)

1339
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:27,080
(Door opens)

1340
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:40,880
(Sobs softly)

1341
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:51,960
Selma Jezkova.

1342
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:54,000
It's time.

1343
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:13,600
Please stand.

1344
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:17,320
She can walk on her own.

1345
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:22,840
Selma.

1346
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:26,200
I'm afraid my legs
aren't working very well.

1347
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:29,160
- You can do it, Selma.
- Yeah.

1348
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:32,240
- I have a plan, OK?
- Yeah.

1349
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:36,400
- You're gonna stand up with me.
- Yeah.

1350
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:39,240
OK, I will make some noise.

1351
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:41,920
It will give you
something to listen to.

1352
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,360
- Yeah.
- Listen.

1353
02:01:44,440 --> 02:01:45,840
(Selma sobs)

1354
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:48,720
(Stamping continues)

1355
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:52,320
It's 107 steps.

1356
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:55,320
- Listen to the march.
- I couldn't even do one.

1357
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:59,360
- You can do it.
- (Sobbing) I can't do it.

1358
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:02,840
Now, listen Selma,
I want you to do one.

1359
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:04,880
There - one.

1360
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:08,200
Come on.

1361
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:09,960
Listen.

1362
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:12,840
Two.

1363
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:14,880
(Soft music)

1364
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:23,960
(Brenda) ..five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

1365
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:28,560
thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen...

1366
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:32,520
(Brenda continues counting
in time to march)

1367
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:34,960
..twenty-one, twenty-two,
twenty-three...

1368
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:36,480
(Rattles against bars)

1369
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:39,080
..twenty-five, twenty-six,
twenty-seven,

1370
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:41,280
twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty...

1371
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:44,760
# Thirty-one

1372
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:50,240
# Thirty-five, thirty-eight

1373
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:53,680
# Forty-two... #

1374
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:56,720
(Brenda continues to count)

1375
02:02:57,040 --> 02:03:00,600
# Forty-eight

1376
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:04,960
# Fifty-one, fifty-four

1377
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:09,840
# Fifty-eight

1378
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:15,800
# Sixty-four

1379
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:20,880
# Sixty-eight, sixty-nine

1380
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:24,640
# Seventy-five

1381
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:31,600
# Seventy-nine

1382
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:37,160
# Eighty-two, eighty-six

1383
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:44,080
# Eighty-nine, ninety-three

1384
02:03:44,160 --> 02:03:49,040
# One hundred and seven

1385
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:53,920
# Steps #

1386
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:57,080
(Brenda) One hundred and seven.

1387
02:03:57,160 --> 02:04:01,080
Selma Jezkova,
do you have any last words?

1388
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:07,960
Very well. Proceed.

1389
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:20,840
Selma. Selma. Selma, are you OK?

1390
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:25,480
It's OK.

1391
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:31,600
Come on, now.

1392
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:33,960
- Use the board.
- No, wait. Give her a chair.

1393
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:37,080
(Brenda) She can stand up,
she can stand.

1394
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:39,280
(Man) Get her feet.

1395
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:55,000
(It's OK. It's OK.
It's OK. It's OK...)

1396
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,960
(Man) Straps on her hands...

1397
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:06,880
- I'm scared. I'm so scared.
- I know.

1398
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:16,240
(Guard) On the mark.

1399
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:26,440
No. I can't do the hood.

1400
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:28,360
It's OK, Selma.

1401
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:32,040
I have to breathe.
Nobody told me about the hood.

1402
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:35,000
- It's just so you can't see...
- I can't breathe!

1403
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:36,960
- I can't breathe!
- Look, look...

1404
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:38,680
(Screams) I can't breathe!

1405
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:39,800
She can't breathe!

1406
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:42,200
- (Screams)
- She can't breathe!

1407
02:05:42,280 --> 02:05:44,640
She can't...
I'm taking it. I'm taking it.

1408
02:05:44,720 --> 02:05:46,360
- Look...
- This is irregular.

1409
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,280
I don't care. She can't see...

1410
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:50,760
- We have regulations...
- I don't care!

1411
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:52,800
The girl is blind for Christ's sake.

1412
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,840
- I'm gonna make a call.
- Make the call.

1413
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:57,280
(Screams)

1414
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:58,720
Gene!

1415
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:02,320
We have a situation here.
I'll hold for him.

1416
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:03,920
Gene.

1417
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,280
The woman is blind.

1418
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:07,120
Gene!

1419
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:08,960
Gene.

1420
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:12,400
We're waiting for a call.

1421
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,880
Gene.

1422
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:19,200
(Screams)

1423
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,440
Gene!

1424
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:25,200
Gene!

1425
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:27,320
(Piercing scream)

1426
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:28,600
Gene!

1427
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:33,000
He's just outside.
He gave me these for you.

1428
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:35,760
So he had the operation?

1429
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:39,720
He will see his grandchildren.
He's just outside.

1430
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:44,280
You were right, Selma.
Listen to your heart!

(Hums)

1434
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:29,200
# Dear Gene, of course you are near

1435
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:37,680
# And now there's nothing to fear

1436
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:44,360
# I should have known

1437
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:52,840

1439
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:04,320
# There's no violin

1440
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:10,840
# The choir is so quiet
and no one takes a spin

# This is the next to last song

1442
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:26,480
# And that's all

1443
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:33,720
# All

1444
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:42,520
# Remember what I have said

1445
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:49,720
# Remember, wrap up the bread

1446
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:57,360
# Do this, do that, make your bed

1447
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:06,840
# This isn't the last song,
there's no violin

1448
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:13,960
# The choir is quiet
and no one takes a spin
