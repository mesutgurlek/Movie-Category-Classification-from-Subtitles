# Oh, oh, oh #

7
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:43,507
# Hungry for something
that I can't eat #

8
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:45,233
# Then I hear that beat #

9
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:48,877
# That rhythm of town
starts calling me down #

10
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:52,713
# It's like a message
from high above #

11
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,151
# Oh, oh, oh #

12
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:58,275
# Pulling me out to the smiles
and the streets that I love #

27

# The rats on the street #

28
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:51,016
# All dance around my feet #

29
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:55,043
# They seem to say:
"Tracy, it's up to you" #

# There's the flasher
who lives next door #

34
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:10,386
# There's the bum on
his barroom stool #

35
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:14,413
# They wish me luck
on my way to school #

# I know there's a place where I belong #

43

# I see all those party lights
shining ahead #

44
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:43,373
# So someone invite me
before I drop dead #

45
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:45,387

46

47

# Something inside
of me makes me move #

50
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:58,620
# When I hear that groove #

51
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,346
# My ma tells me no #

52
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:02,168
# But my feet tell me "go" #

53
00:04:02,168 --> 00:04:06,291
# It's like a drummer inside my heart #

54
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,963
# So oh, oh, don't make me wait #

55
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:21,730

61
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:41,772
# That someday when I take to the floor #

62
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:45,991
# The world's gonna wake up and see #

63
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:49,443

65
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:52,991
# Yes, more or less, we all agree #

# Baltimore and me #

69
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:13,033
Mount Everest is the most
famous, but not the highest...

70
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:15,238
geographical point on this earth.

71
00:05:15,238 --> 00:05:17,636
Now, who can tell me what that is?

72
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:19,841
Um, excuse me, Miss Whimsy?

73
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:21,184
I can't see the board again.

74

Tracy Turnblad.

75
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:25,786
If I have to write you up...

76
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:28,759
for inappropriate hair height
one more time...

77
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,677
you will be removed to detention.

78
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:32,978
Miss Wimsey, what am I supposed to do?

79
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:36,047
Hair can't just hang there like a dead thing
on your cheeks.

80
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:39,499
I mean, well... Uh-you know what I mean.

81
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:41,896
I... Ahh.

82
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:46,787
As I said, it is not Mount Everest.

83
00:05:46,787 --> 00:05:49,472
Now, next week we will be talking...

84
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:52,349
about earthquakes and volcanoes.

85
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:54,363
And as exciting as that might sound...

86
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:58,390
we have to look back approximately
60 million years.

87
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,828
Now, if you turn your pages...

88
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:01,746
we are going to start
with the Ring of Fire.

89
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:03,664
I want you to contemplate what causes...

90
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,966
the separation of the two components.

91
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,829
Penny, come on, hurry!

92
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:23,514
Outta my way!

93
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:25,719
Push! We're late.

94
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:36,651
Ahh!

95
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,007
- One minute to air.
- OK.

96
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:47,391
40 to go!

97
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,117
Don't change that channel.

98

00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:02,542
- Hiya, Dad!
- Goodbye!

101
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:03,885
Hi.

102
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:04,844
It's my daughter.

103
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:07,720
10 seconds. Places, everyone.

104
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:10,214
Hurry up, Penny, we're missing it!

105
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,707
My mom says I'm not
allowed to perspire!

106
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,789
Hey there, teenage Baltimore!

107
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:19,803
Don't change that
channel 'cause it's time...

00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:08,545
# So, if every night you're shakin' #

164
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:10,559
# As you lie in bed #

165
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,518
# Mony, mony #

166
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,860
# Shake it, baby #

167
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,833
# And the bass and drums
are poundin' in your head #

168
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,943
# Mony, mony, ooh, mony, mony #

169
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:20,628
# Who cares about sleep when
you can snooze in school #

170
00:09:20,724 --> 00:09:23,409
# You'll never get to college
but you'll sure look cool #

171
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:25,135
# Don't need a cap or a gown #

172
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:28,012
# When you're the nicest kids in town #

173
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:30,505
They must think my ears
are garbage cans.

174
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:34,053
Would you turn that racket down?

175
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:35,875
I'm tryin' to iron here.

176
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,601
# Nicest kids in #

177
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:42,683
# Kids in town, whoo! #

178
00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:46,902
<i>Ma, it's not racket.
It's The Corny Collins Show.</i>

179
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:48,724
Well, it's turning your brains into mud.

180
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:50,642
Mrs. Turnblad, it's a new dance!

181
00:09:50,738 --> 00:09:52,081
The Stricken Chicken.

182
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:54,094
Well, I can't hear myself think.

183
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,779
How am I supposed to negotiate pleats?

184
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:57,738
Edna?

185
00:09:57,738 --> 00:09:59,368
I'm in here, Prudy.

186
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:01,574
What's that racket?

187
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:03,780
Ohh, Tracy.

188
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,218
Edna, is my laundry ready?

189
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,848
Yep.

190
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:08,766
That'll be $3.00, hon.

191
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:11,163
That's pretty pricey
for a pair of petty pants.

192
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:12,218
Well, I'm sorry, Prudy...

193
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:13,656
but some-a your personal stains...

194
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,670
required poundin' with a rock.

195
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:18,068
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

196
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,575
You're letting her listen
to that race music again?

197
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:25,260
My daughter spends every afternoon
at the Stamp and Coin Club.

198
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,465
Oh, really? Well, your daughter hap-

199
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,287
Ohh, ohh.

200
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:31,780
Oh, what is that? The Wavin' Raven?

201
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,602
It's a little twitchy.

202
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,821
Oh, you wanna play Charades now.
All right.

203
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:39,356
OK, go ahead.

204
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:40,602
You.

205
00:10:40,698 --> 00:10:41,657
Penny.

206
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:44,150
No. Ahh!

207
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:47,698
Tracy Turnblad, are you tryin' to tell me...

208
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:48,945
that-that Penny didn't get permission...

209
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:50,192
from her mother to be here?

210
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:51,342
What?

211
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:52,493
Penny.

212
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:55,370
You are banned from this house.

213
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,192
You will never watch that show again!

214
00:10:57,288 --> 00:11:00,644
- Without that show I have nothing!
- Having nothing builds character!

215
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:03,041
Toodle-oo, Edna!

216
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:13,398
Give 'em a hand, folks.
All right, all right.

217
00:11:15,987 --> 00:11:18,288
And, once again,
that's the Stricken Chicken.

218
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:21,357
We will be right back
for some more of that hot Detroit sound.

219
00:11:22,987 --> 00:11:24,713
And we're off!

220
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,247
Corny.

221
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,028
"Detroit sound"?

222
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:31,234
What's that, the cries
of people being mugged?

223
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,152
Aw, velma, the kids dig
the rhythm and blues.

224
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:34,494
Yeah, they're kids, Corny.

225
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,083
That's why we have to steer
them in the white direction.

226
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,042
Right direction?

227
00:11:39,193 --> 00:11:40,631
Didn't I say that?

228
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:48,974
I'll do it.

229
00:11:53,193 --> 00:11:55,974
You try that again and there'll be stumps
where your feet should be.

230
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:57,508
You got that? You little whor-

231
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,659
Amber.

232
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:00,960
...holy moly. Baby.

233
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,303
Good job dancing today.

234
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:04,221
- It's time.
- Ah!

235
00:12:04,221 --> 00:12:05,180
Link.

236
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,139
Amber.

237
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:07,289
Ah!

238
00:12:07,385 --> 00:12:09,399
- Amber.
- Amber, Amber, Amber.

239
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:12,755
Save your personal life
for the cameras, sweetie.

240
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:14,577
Oh! Shiny.

241
00:12:15,824 --> 00:12:17,454
Tammy, Lou Ann,
you're gonna die.

242
00:12:17,454 --> 00:12:19,564
Speaking of cameras,
did you have a nice nap?

243
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:22,345
If you'd do your job, my daughter wouldn't
have to fight to be visible.

244
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,742
I gotta show some of the
other kids once in a while.

245
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:27,139
You know, this is a small city.

246
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:28,673
There aren't that many stations.

247
00:12:28,673 --> 00:12:30,400
This time next year
you could be wearing...

248
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:32,989
an ill-fitting tux,
snapping bar mitzvah photos.

249
00:12:34,235 --> 00:12:35,386
I don't know.

250
00:12:36,057 --> 00:12:40,564
# It takes two, baby... #

251
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:42,961
Show Link.

252
00:12:43,057 --> 00:12:45,263
This is nuts. She can't even dance.

253
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:47,181
Plastic little spastic.

254
00:12:47,277 --> 00:12:51,016
Oh, Link. I can dance
so much better than her.

255
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:53,030
Why don't you notice me at school?

256
00:12:53,126 --> 00:12:54,181
Mm-hmm.

257
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:57,249
# Ooh #

258
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:03,387
<i>Hey, that was our very own Link Larkin
singin' It Takes Two.</i>

259
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:05,400
And I'm Motormouth Maybelle remindin'...

260
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:08,373
the last Tuesday of this month's
your rhythm and blues day.

261
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:10,962
That's right! Negro Day
will be comin' your way.

262
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:15,181
So don't-uh... Uh... Over here.

263
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:16,524
Thank you.

264
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,976
So, catch all the croonin'
when y'all set and tune in.

265
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:21,510
Thank you, Motormouth.
And now it's time to...

266
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,141
Owner's coming. He'll call
my mother again, let's go.

267
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,099
...very own fun-lovin'...

268
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:25,442
Hey!

269
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:26,401
Come on up here, Brenda.

270
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:27,647
What?

271
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:29,086
Brenda will be taking a leave of absence
from the show.

272
00:13:29,086 --> 00:13:30,524
How long you gonna be gone, Brenda?

273
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:32,154
Just nine months.

274
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:34,648
Seems like we'll have an opening
here on the show for a girl...

275
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,908
just as fun-lovin' but maybe
not quite as freewheelin'.

276
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:40,114
Wanna be one-a
the nicest kids in town?

277
00:13:40,114 --> 00:13:43,182
<i>Cut school tomorrow and come down
to station WYZT to audition.</i>

278
00:13:48,264 --> 00:13:49,895
- No.
- But, Ma.

279
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,525
Don't test me, Tracy Turnblad.

280
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:52,963
My diet pill's wearin' off.

281
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:54,689
But come on.

282
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,374
No one is auditioning for
anything in this household.

283
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,388
But why not? Why not?!

284
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:00,922
Because dancing is not your future.

285
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:04,758
One day you're gonna own
Edna's Occidental Laundry.

286
00:14:04,758 --> 00:14:06,676
I don't wanna be a laundress.

287
00:14:06,676 --> 00:14:07,827
I wanna be famous!

288
00:14:07,922 --> 00:14:09,073
Look, if you wanna be famous...

289
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:10,703
learn how to take blood
outta car upholstery.

290
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,717
That's a skill you can take right to the bank.

291
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:15,210
- Hey, hey. What's all this ruckus in here?
- Not a word.

292
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:17,991
Daddy, tomorrow I'm auditioning
to dance on a Tv show.

293
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:19,142
- No, she is not.
- You are?

294
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:20,772
First the hair, now this?

295
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:22,786
But all the kids are battin' up
their hair now, hon.

296
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:23,841
You're no help.

297
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:24,895
It's "ratting," Daddy.

298
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:26,622
And our first lady,
Jacqueline Kennedy, does it.

299
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:27,676
I don't believe that.

300
00:14:27,772 --> 00:14:28,731
What do you mean,
you don't believe that?!

301
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,841
- I don't.
- How else would it look that way?

302
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:32,663
I believe that it is naturally stiff.

303
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,444
She doesn't understand anything.

304
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:38,129
- Dancing on that show is my dream.
- I know.

305
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:41,293
Just because she wouldn't know
a dream if it bit her on the nose.

306
00:14:41,293 --> 00:14:43,115
Well, I have information for you, missy.

307
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,471
I once had a dream that I owned
a coin-operated laundromat...

308
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:49,444
and I came down from that cloud
real quickly, I'll tell you that.

309
00:14:49,444 --> 00:14:50,691
No!

310
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:53,184
- Oh, Wilbur.
- Fine! I'm going to my room!

311
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,910
She thinks I'm bein' mean
but I'm not. Those Tv people...

312
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:59,321
they don't pick people like Tracy,
or girls like us.

313
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:01,239
They're gonna hurt her, Wilbur.

314
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:03,732
I'll talk to her.

315
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:05,170
Ooh.

316
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:07,855
'K. Talk to her.

317
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:10,349
I'll talk to her.

318
00:15:10,349 --> 00:15:11,691
Don't you worry.

319
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:12,746
OK.

320
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:15,335
What?

321
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:21,856
Tracy, this Tv thing.

322
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:23,582
You really want it?

323
00:15:23,678 --> 00:15:24,637
With all my heart.

324
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:26,075
Then you go for it!

325
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:28,472
This is America, babe.

326
00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:30,103
You gotta think big to be big.

327
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:33,171
Big ain't the problem
in this family, Wilbur.

328
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,760
You follow your dream.

329
00:15:35,856 --> 00:15:40,075
Mine came true, and now I have the most
precious thing in the world.

330
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:43,528
The Taj Mahal of joke shops.

331
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:47,267
Heh heh heh heh!

332
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:50,336
Back step, cha-cha-cha.

333
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:51,966
Side step, front step.

334
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:53,884
Back and turn.

335
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:55,610
Front step, cha-cha-cha.

336
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,144
Tammy, sharper.

337
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,966
Side step, front step.

338
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:00,788
Back, again.

339
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:02,802
Oh, my God, Penny, there's Link.

340
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:04,240
Link!

341
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:05,583
Penny, pinch me!

342
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,501
Ow!

343
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:08,747
You told me to.

344
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:10,953
I can't believe I'm really here auditioning.

345
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:12,487
Side step, front step.

346
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:14,213
I can't believe I'm really
here watching you audition.

347
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:16,035
Front step, cha-cha-cha.

348
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:17,857
Back step, cha-cha-cha.

349
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,679
Side step, front step.

350
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:23,707
Back and t-oh, Amber.
Look at this motley crew.

351
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:25,816
Oh! This town sure has gone downhill...

352
00:16:25,912 --> 00:16:27,255
since I was crowned
Miss Baltimore Crabs.

353
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:28,214
Ugh.

354
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:31,474
# Oh, my God,
how times have changed #

355
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:35,022
# These girls must be blind
or completely deranged #

356
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:36,748
# But time seemed to halt #

357
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:39,721
# When I was Miss Baltimore Crabs #

358
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:41,447
Amber, that move is far too dirty.

359
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:43,652
Mother, wake up from
that dream of yours.

360
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:45,570
- This isn't 1930.
- Ha ha ha.

361
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,447
# You can laugh but life's a test #

362
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:50,173
# Don't do this, don't do that #

363
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:51,995
# Remember, Mother knows best #

364
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:53,817
# For the crown's in the vault #

365
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:57,365
# From when I won Miss Baltimore Crabs #

366
00:16:57,461 --> 00:16:58,707
# These steps are perfect ammunition #

367
00:16:58,707 --> 00:17:02,351
# Let me show you how your mommy
dear took out the competition #

368
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:04,653
Girls, go get 'em.

369
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:05,899
Boys, let's rumba.

370
00:17:05,995 --> 00:17:09,352
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

371
00:17:09,352 --> 00:17:12,708
# Those poor runner-ups might
still hold some grudges #

372
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:16,256
# They padded their cups
but I screwed the judges #

373
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,845
# Those broads thought
they'd win if a plate #

374
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:21,050
# They would spin in their dance #

375
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,009
Aah!

376
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:24,886
# Not a chance
Boys, put me down #

377
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:26,804
Oh, good morning, ladies.

378
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:28,146
Let's see what you got.

379
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:31,886
# Twist, twist, twist, twist
mashed potato, mambo #

380
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:33,133
# Ready, begin #

381
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,955
# On my show you'll never find #

382
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:36,585
# A thrusting hip or bump and grind #

383
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:38,311
# What's that?
A dance for fleas and ticks? #

384
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:40,229
# Oh, you should-a seen my bag of tricks #

385
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:43,873
# Oh, I hit the stage batons ablaze #

386
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:46,941
<i># While belting Aida
and preparing soufflés #</i>

387
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,955
# But that triple somersault #

388
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:54,038
# Is how I clinched
Miss Baltimore Crabs #

389
00:18:20,408 --> 00:18:21,559
Proceed.

390
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,997
# Are you scared we're on live? #

391
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:24,723
# No, I'm sure I can cope #

392
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:27,312
# Well, this show isn't broadcast in #

393
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:28,463
# Cinemascope #

394
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:30,189
# I never drank one chocolate malt #

395
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:34,984
# No desserts for Miss Baltimore Crabs #

396
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:36,614
# This one will never get a date #

397
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:38,532
# In those hand-me-down clothes #

398
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:42,367
# Ha! Kid, she'll never get a date
till Daddy buys her a new nose #

399
00:18:42,463 --> 00:18:43,614
<i># I would say "Oy, gevalt" #</i>

400
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,970
# If I wasn't Miss Baltimore Crabs #

401
00:18:48,888 --> 00:18:50,327
# Do you dance like you dress? #

402
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:52,340
# Amber, there's no need to be cruel #

403
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,505
# Would you swim
in an integrated pool? #

404
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:56,560
I sure would.

405
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,998
I'm all for integration.

406
00:18:57,998 --> 00:19:00,012
It's the new frontier!

407
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:01,738
Not in Baltimore, it isn't.

408
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:03,272
And may I be frank?

409
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:05,382
# First impressions can be tough #

410
00:19:05,382 --> 00:19:06,916
# And when I saw you, I knew it #

411
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,354
# If your size weren't enough #

412
00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:10,176
# Your last answer just blew it #

413
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:13,916
# And so, my dear,
so short and stout #

414
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,450
# You'll never be in #

415
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,560
# So we're kicking you out #

416
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,998
# With your form and your face #

417
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:20,820
# Aw, well, it isn't your fault #

418
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,163
# You're just down with a case #

419
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:30,122
# Of Miss Baltimore Crabs #

420
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:32,232
Uh, you may go.

421
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:35,013
Um... Thank you?

422
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:40,574
I think they secretly liked you.

423
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:55,054
Cutting my class, Tracy Turnblad?

424
00:19:55,054 --> 00:19:58,027
I trust it was something really important.

425
00:19:58,027 --> 00:19:59,465
It should've been.

426
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,876
# Gimme a break, yeah.
Right now! #

427
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,370
# Got a brand-new sound,
so scream and shout #

428
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,520
Hey! Hey!

429
00:20:14,616 --> 00:20:16,726
# With a funky rhythm #

430
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:19,794
# It's a brand-new look that you can... #

431
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:21,329
Whoo!

432
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:25,164
# There's a party groovin'
let's get down #

433
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,123
What you lookin' at?

434
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:28,521
Nothing. Not you.

435
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,603
Can I help you?

436
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,041
That move's swish.

437
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,672
Ya got that right.

438
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:38,589
The man can dine me
on a diet of detention...

439
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:40,987
so long as he don't starve
me of my tunes, baby.

440
00:20:40,987 --> 00:20:43,672
- Does that dance have a name?
- Oh, this?

441
00:20:43,672 --> 00:20:45,590
Call it the "Peyton Place After Midnight. "

442
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,138
I use it to attract, uh, the opposite sex.

443
00:20:49,234 --> 00:20:51,247
Wow.

444
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:53,836
That is so groovy.

445
00:20:59,878 --> 00:21:01,316
You're really good.

446
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:02,275
Why, thank you.

447
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:05,823
So would it be kinda like this?

448
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,029
You can't do that dance.

449
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:09,467
Hello, now.

450
00:21:09,563 --> 00:21:10,809
Not bad for a white chick.

451
00:21:12,535 --> 00:21:14,837
- Hey, I know where I've seen you before.
- Where?

452
00:21:14,837 --> 00:21:16,563
On Corny's show on Negro Day.

453
00:21:16,563 --> 00:21:17,618
Negro Day's the best.

454
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:19,344
I wish every day were Negro Day.

455
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,933
At our house, it is.

456
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:26,440
Hey. Show me another one?

457
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:28,454
You wanna see another one.

458
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,139
Well-well, here's a little
something signified to say...

459
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:33,728
Hello, my name is Seaweed...

460
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:34,974
Oh, oh, oh!

461
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:36,605
J...

462
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:38,043
Stubbs.

463
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:39,194
What's yours, baby?

464
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,892
I'm Tra-cy Turn-blad!

465
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:46,769
You're gonna get it, white girl!

466
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:49,167
Well, Tracy, you got it goin' on, girl.

467
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:50,413
You one of us.

468
00:21:50,413 --> 00:21:54,728
You're joinin' this program already
in progress!

469
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:56,263
Well, let's go.

470
00:21:56,263 --> 00:21:58,180
# Whoo! #

471
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,098
# Yeah! #

472
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:02,304
# Got a brand-new sound,
so scream and shout #

473
00:22:03,646 --> 00:22:07,290
# Hey, a funky beat,
now let's be hurrying #

474
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,729
Whoa!

475
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,455
# We can't wait now #

476
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:11,414
# Have some fun #

477
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,674
# This party now has just begun #

478
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:16,496
No, I get who Caesar is.

479
00:22:16,496 --> 00:22:18,318
But what's the "Ideas of March"?

480
00:22:18,318 --> 00:22:21,099
I mean, how can
a month have an idea?

481
00:22:21,195 --> 00:22:22,250
Hold on.

482
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,592
Come on.

483
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:29,154
# Come on and watch me strut my stuff #

484
00:22:30,496 --> 00:22:31,935
# Watch me #

485
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:32,989
# Come on and watch me #

486
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,332
How you likin' detention now?

487
00:22:34,428 --> 00:22:38,168
I'm a bad, bad girl who
needs to be punished.

488
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:44,401
# Ohh #

489
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:46,127
Hey.

490
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:49,963
You know, Corny's hosting
the hop tomorrow.

491
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:52,648
If he saw you dancin' like that...

492
00:22:52,648 --> 00:22:53,798
he'd put you on the show.

493
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:55,332
Mmm...

494
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,675
- See ya.
- Mm.

495
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,401
Ah, whoa. Sorry, little darlin'.

496
00:22:58,497 --> 00:23:00,511
Hope I didn't dent your 'do.

497
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,401
See y'all later.

498
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:07,415
Hey, Trace. I was looking for you.

499
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:08,757
What?

500
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:12,210
# I can hear the bells #

501
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,703
What? What are you talking about?

502
00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:17,963
# Well, don't-cha hear 'em chime? #

503
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,689
Chime's not exactly how I'd put it.

504
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:26,594
# Can't you feel my heartbeat
keeping perfect time? #

505
00:23:26,689 --> 00:23:31,772
# And all because he #

506
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,018
# Touched me #

507
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:35,032
# He looked at me and stared #

508
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:37,142
# Yes, he bumped me #

509
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:39,060
# My heart was unprepared #

510
00:23:39,155 --> 00:23:41,169
# When he tapped me #

511
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,183
# And knocked me off my feet #

512
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:47,210
# One little touch now my life's complete #

513
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:49,416
- # 'Cause when he nudged me #
- Oh!

514
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,430
# Love put me in a fix #

515
00:23:51,526 --> 00:23:53,348
# Yes, it hit me #

516
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,265
# Just like a ton-a bricks #

517
00:23:55,361 --> 00:23:57,759
# Yes, my heart burst #

518
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,772
# Now I know what life's about #

519
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:03,608
# One little touch and
love's knocked me out #

520
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,485
# And I can hear the bells #

521
00:24:06,485 --> 00:24:08,211
# My head is spinning #

522
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:10,129
# I can hear the bells #

523
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:12,718
# Something's beginning #

524
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:16,074
# Everybody says that
a girl who looks like me #

525
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,992
# Can't win his love #

526
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:20,102
# Well, just wait and see #

527
00:24:20,198 --> 00:24:22,883
# 'Cause I can hear the bells #

528
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:24,705
# Just hear them chiming #

529
00:24:24,705 --> 00:24:26,431
# I can hear the bells #

530
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:28,924
# My temperature's climbing #

531
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,650
# I can't contain my joy #

532
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,760
# 'Cause I finally found the boy #

533
00:24:32,855 --> 00:24:34,965
# I've been missin' #

534
00:24:34,965 --> 00:24:41,582
# Listen, I can hear the bells #

535
00:24:41,678 --> 00:24:43,020
# Round one #

536
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,417
# He'll ask me on a date and then #

537
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,239
# Round two #

538
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:49,445
# I'll primp but won't be late because #

539
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:51,075
# Round three #

540
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:53,185
# Is when we kiss inside his car #

541
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:57,788
# Won't go all the way
but I'll go pretty fa-ar #

542
00:24:57,883 --> 00:24:59,418
# Round four #

543
00:24:59,418 --> 00:25:02,007
# He'll ask me for my hand and then #

544
00:25:02,007 --> 00:25:03,829
# Round five #

545
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:06,130
# We'll book the wedding band so by #

546
00:25:06,226 --> 00:25:07,569
# Round six #

547
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:10,158
# Amber, much to your surprise #

548
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:13,993
# This heavyweight
champion takes the prize #

549
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:16,295
# And I can hear the bells #

550
00:25:16,295 --> 00:25:17,925
# My ears are ringing #

551
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:20,035
# I can hear the bells #

552
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:22,432
# The bridesmaids are singing #

553
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,172
# Everybody says that
a guy who's such a gem #

554
00:25:26,172 --> 00:25:27,898
# Won't look my way #

555
00:25:27,898 --> 00:25:30,199
# Well, the laugh's on them #

556
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,501
# 'Cause I can hear the bells #

557
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:34,610
# My father will smile #

558
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,241
# I can hear the bells #

559
00:25:36,336 --> 00:25:38,638
# As he walks me down the aisle #

560
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:40,364
# My mother starts to cry #

561
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:44,775
# But I can't see 'cause Link
and I are French kissin' #

562
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:49,570
# Listen, I can hear the bells #

563
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,227
# Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh #

564
00:25:55,227 --> 00:25:57,241
# I can hear the bells #

565
00:25:57,241 --> 00:25:59,255
# My head is reeling #

566
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:01,173
# I can hear the bells #

567
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:03,378
# I can't stop the pealing #

568
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:07,310
# Everybody warns
that he won't like what he'll see #

569
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,625
# But I know that he'll
look inside of me #

570
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:13,639
# Yeah, I can hear the bells #

571
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:16,036
# Today's just the start 'cause #

572
00:26:16,132 --> 00:26:17,474
# I can hear the bells #

573
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:20,159
# Until death do us part and #

574
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,612
# Even when we die
we'll look down from up above #

575
00:26:23,612 --> 00:26:27,735
# Remembering the night
that we two fell in love #

576
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:29,653
# We both will shed a tear #

577
00:26:29,653 --> 00:26:34,256
# And he'll whisper as we're reminiscin' #

578
00:26:34,352 --> 00:26:37,804
# Listen, I can hear the bells #

579
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,722
# She can hear the bells #

580
00:26:39,722 --> 00:26:42,694
# I can hear the bells #

581
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,475
# She can hear the bells #

582
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:51,037
# I can hear the bells #

583
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:56,503
# Bum, bum, bum #

584
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,804
# Whoa! #

585
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:08,969
# Hey, little girl with the cash to burn #

586
00:27:09,065 --> 00:27:11,941
# Well, I'm sellin' somethin'
you won't return #

587
00:27:13,188 --> 00:27:16,832
# Hey, little girl, take me off the shelf #

588
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:21,147
# 'Cause it's hard havin'
fun playin' with yourself #

589
00:27:21,243 --> 00:27:23,161
# Once you bounce through
the whole selection #

590
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:25,079
# Shake those hips in my direction #

591
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:27,093
# Bringing back gifts
she never did see #

592
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:28,819
# Take me home and then unwrap me #

593
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:31,887
# Shop around but, little darlin',
I've got to be #

594
00:27:31,887 --> 00:27:34,572
# The ladies' choice #

595
00:27:34,668 --> 00:27:36,202
# Ladies' choice #

596
00:27:36,202 --> 00:27:37,928
# The ladies' choice #

597
00:27:39,942 --> 00:27:41,572
Go on. Get out there and show 'em.

598
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:43,107
It's packed pretty tight.

599
00:27:43,107 --> 00:27:44,641
OK. I'll go in front of you and I'll push.

600
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:46,751
# Test drive this American male #

601
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:48,381
Wait.

602
00:27:48,477 --> 00:27:52,408
# It's gonna take cash to fill my tank #

603
00:27:52,408 --> 00:27:54,230
# So let's crack open your piggy bank #

604
00:27:54,326 --> 00:27:55,189
Hey, Seaweed!

605
00:27:55,285 --> 00:27:56,627
Wanna do Peyton Place for Corny?

606
00:27:56,723 --> 00:27:57,970
Are you crazy? You gotta
dance with your crowd...

607
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,025
and I gotta dance with mine.

608
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:00,080
Why?

609
00:28:00,176 --> 00:28:01,422
It's just the way it is, Tracy.

610
00:28:01,422 --> 00:28:02,669
But it's your dance.

611
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,299
Well, how 'bout you go
borrow it for a second.

612
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:06,409
- Really?
- Go get it, girl.

613
00:28:07,847 --> 00:28:09,957
# I'm the ladies' choice #

614
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:13,984
# Ladies' choice #

615
00:28:15,614 --> 00:28:16,861
Whoo!

616
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:23,573
All right! Yeah!

617
00:28:30,957 --> 00:28:32,012
Whoa!

618
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:33,642
# Hey, little girl on a spendin' spree #

619
00:28:33,642 --> 00:28:35,560
# I don't come cheap
but the kisses come free #

620
00:28:35,656 --> 00:28:39,492
# On closer inspection
I'm sure that you'll agree #

621
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:41,601
# Oh, hey, little girl, listen to my plea #

622
00:28:41,697 --> 00:28:43,807
# I come with a lifetime guarantee #

623
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:46,875
# One day maybe we'll find
that baby makes three #

624
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:47,834
Link!

625
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:49,273
# It's the ladies' choice #

626
00:28:50,423 --> 00:28:53,012
# I'm the ladies' choice #

627
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,560
# I'm the ladies' choice #

628
00:28:59,054 --> 00:29:01,067
# I'm the ladies' choice-choice-choice #

629
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:03,177
# I'm the ladies' choice #

630
00:29:03,177 --> 00:29:05,766
Mr. And Mrs. Turnblad!

631
00:29:08,068 --> 00:29:09,218
Hey, look out!

632
00:29:09,218 --> 00:29:10,177
Ah!

633
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,150
Mrs. Turnblad!

634
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:16,123
Mr. Turnblad, come quick!

635
00:29:16,218 --> 00:29:17,465
- Me?
- Come on.

636
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:21,588
Mrs. Turnblad! Come quick!

637
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:22,931
You gotta see this!

638
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:24,082
Oh, I read all about it.

639
00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:25,904
It's a big fake Hollywood set.

640
00:29:25,904 --> 00:29:27,246
No, Mrs. -

641
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:28,972
You think I'm gonna think
that he's really up there?

642
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:30,890
It's not John Glenn, Mrs. Turnblad!

643
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,233
Well, why are we watchin' this?

644
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:33,287
Just watch.

645
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:34,246
- Lou Ann!
- Joey!

646
00:29:34,246 --> 00:29:35,205
Mikey! vicki! Becky!

647
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:36,164
Bix! Jesse! Darla!

648
00:29:36,164 --> 00:29:37,890
- Paulie!
- Noreen!

649
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,849
- Doreen!
- Link!

650
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,096
And I'm Tracy!

651
00:29:40,096 --> 00:29:41,055
Aah!

652
00:29:41,055 --> 00:29:43,068
Oh! Oh, my!

653
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,945
# Oh, yeah! #

654
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:49,014
# And the bass and drums
are poundin' in your head #

655
00:29:49,014 --> 00:29:49,973
Go, Tracy!

656
00:29:49,973 --> 00:29:51,219
- Go, go, Tracy!
- Go, go, Tracy!

657
00:29:51,315 --> 00:29:53,904
# Who cares about sleep when
you can snooze in school? #

658
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,493
# You'll never get to college
but you sure look cool #

659
00:29:56,589 --> 00:29:57,836
# Don't need a cap and a gown #

660
00:29:57,932 --> 00:30:00,329
# When you're the nicest kids in town #

661
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,439
# Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo #

662
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:08,096
# Kids in town, woo! #

663
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:10,110
Yeah! That was the dance of the week...

664
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,124
I don't know what happened, Mr. Spritzer.

665
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:14,809
Corny had some sort
of aneurysm or something...

666
00:30:14,905 --> 00:30:16,727
and... picked her.

667
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:19,412
...by our brand-new Council Member,
Miss Tracy Turnblad.

668
00:30:19,412 --> 00:30:22,576
So, Trace, come on, cozy up to old Corny
and tell us about yourself.

669
00:30:22,576 --> 00:30:24,782
<i>Well, I watch The Corny Collins Show...</i>

670
00:30:24,878 --> 00:30:26,700
and I do absolutely nothing else!

671
00:30:26,796 --> 00:30:28,330
Ooh! I sure like the way you talk.

672
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,439
Oh, Wilbur, to think that
I almost stopped her...

673
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:31,878
from reaching for the stars.

674
00:30:31,974 --> 00:30:34,659
And now here she
is on local daytime TV.

675
00:30:34,755 --> 00:30:36,385
She's gonna be a regular.

676
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:40,508
Imagine, my little girl, regular at last.

677
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:43,481
I also hope to be the first woman president
or a Rockette.

678
00:30:43,577 --> 00:30:45,207
And if you were president, Tracy...

679
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:47,125
what would your first official act be?

680
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,755
Hmm.

681
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:50,960
I'd make every day Negro Day.

682
00:30:52,303 --> 00:30:54,892
I read you like tomorrow's
headlines, Tracy.

683
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:55,947
What do you think, kids?

684
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:57,481
You think we might
have a hot new candidate...

685
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,632
for Miss Teenage Hairspray?

686
00:30:58,632 --> 00:31:00,646
That's only the dream of my life.

687
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:02,372
But Miss Hairspray is mine.

688
00:31:02,372 --> 00:31:03,810
Uh, we're on the air.

689
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,632
And your dream will be
comin' to you, sweetheart...

690
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:08,892
<i>Saturday, June 2nd,
right here on WYZT.</i>

691
00:31:08,892 --> 00:31:11,482
You have to vote for a person, Corny,
not one of the Himalayas.

692
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:12,440
Hi, Penny.

693
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:13,783
Always the charmer, Amber.

694
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:18,769
I want that chubby communist
girl off the show.

695
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:21,167
Well, let me be the first
to toss the harpoon.

696
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:22,413
She's a corrupting influence!

697
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,865
I agree. We don't want our dancers
thrusting like savages!

698
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:27,304
Hey, speak for yourself.

699
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:28,455
Don't get flip with me.

700
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,797
I'm not.

701
00:31:29,797 --> 00:31:31,523
Look, now I got some
new ideas for the show.

702
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:32,866
First, we get rid-a Negro Day.

703
00:31:32,866 --> 00:31:35,071
Finally, some sense outta you.

704
00:31:35,071 --> 00:31:36,701
And we mix those kids in
with the rest-a the Council.

705
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:38,140
Mix those kids?

706
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,195
That's right, I said it.

707
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:40,921
This is not a black-and-tan cocktail!

708
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:42,263
Well, why couldn't it be?

709
00:31:42,263 --> 00:31:44,373
velma, isn't this where
it's all headin' anyway?

710
00:31:44,373 --> 00:31:47,058
Now, you can fight it
or you can rock out to it.

711
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:49,263
Maybe it is time for some fresh ideas...

712
00:31:49,263 --> 00:31:52,140
like-like a nice, fresh new host!

713
00:31:53,195 --> 00:31:54,250
Heh.

714
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,263
Gee, velma,
how do you fire Corny Collins...

715
00:31:56,263 --> 00:31:57,894
<i>from The Corny Collins Show?</i>

716
00:31:59,332 --> 00:32:01,825
<i>They do it all the time on Lassie!</i>

717
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,839
velma, you've let this go too far!

718
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,798
Me?

719
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:05,853
- Fix it!
- What?

720
00:32:05,949 --> 00:32:07,003
Fix it!

721
00:32:08,538 --> 00:32:09,497
Ohh!

722
00:32:10,647 --> 00:32:12,373
# Hey, look out for that movin' van #

723
00:32:12,373 --> 00:32:14,004
# Drivin' down our streets #

724
00:32:14,004 --> 00:32:16,113
# You better lock up your man #

725
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:19,086
# Before he meets the new girl in town #

726
00:32:19,086 --> 00:32:21,100
# Who just came on the scene... #

727
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,826
Tracyface whoopee cushion.

728
00:32:22,826 --> 00:32:23,785
Good choice.

729
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:25,990
We got your Tracy souvenirs for days.

730
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,251
Here, your signed photos.

731
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:30,401
Tracy wigs.

732
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:31,936
# Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa #

733
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:37,114
# We don't know what to do
'bout the new girl in town #

734
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,470
# The new girl in town #

735
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,292
# Seems to dance on air #

736
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:43,634
# The new girl in town #

737
00:32:43,634 --> 00:32:45,936
# She's got the coolest hair #

738
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:50,826
# You better tell the homecoming queen
to hold onto her crown #

739
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:52,936
# Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa #

740
00:32:52,936 --> 00:32:55,621
# Or she's gonna lose it to #

741
00:32:55,621 --> 00:32:57,059
# The new girl in town #

742
00:32:57,155 --> 00:32:59,936
That big little girl is sending
my sales through the roof.

743
00:33:00,032 --> 00:33:03,005
More people are breathing
aerosol than oxygen!

744
00:33:03,005 --> 00:33:04,635
Do you think you could show us
some of those new dance moves?

745
00:33:04,635 --> 00:33:05,594
Yeah, sure.

746
00:33:05,594 --> 00:33:06,553
Ooh, pretty flowers.

747
00:33:06,553 --> 00:33:09,142
Tracy, wait up!

748
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:10,580
# She's hip #

749
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,978
# So cool #

750
00:33:12,978 --> 00:33:16,622
# I'm gonna get her after school #

751
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:19,307
# And yet we'd like to be like her #

752
00:33:19,307 --> 00:33:23,334
# 'Cause she's the kitten
that the cats prefer #

753
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,156
# The new girl in town #

754
00:33:25,156 --> 00:33:26,882
# Has my guy on a string #

755
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,512
# The new girl in town #

756
00:33:28,512 --> 00:33:30,526
# Hey, look, she's wearin' his ring #

757
00:33:30,526 --> 00:33:33,882
# I can't stop cryin' and
so in my own tears #

758
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:35,800
# I'm gonna drown #

759
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,718
# Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa #

760
00:33:37,814 --> 00:33:40,307
# 'Cause he wants to rendezvous #

761
00:33:40,403 --> 00:33:41,554
# With the new girl #

762
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:43,567
# We're kinda sad and blue #

763
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:45,006
# Yes, it's true, girl #

764
00:33:45,102 --> 00:33:47,020
# We'd like to say #

765
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,855
# To the new girl in town #

766
00:33:50,855 --> 00:33:54,020
# The new girl in town #

767
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,623
Hi, I'm here to see Tracy Turnblad.

768
00:33:59,677 --> 00:34:01,020
Where's her write-up?

769
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,513
She doesn't need a detention slip,
she's with me.

770
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,253
Penny, this is Seaweed.

771
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,212
Seaweed, this is Penny.

772
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,801
# Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa #

773
00:34:14,828 --> 00:34:16,075
Huh.

774
00:34:18,952 --> 00:34:22,692
# To the new girl in town #

775
00:34:22,692 --> 00:34:25,856
# The new girl in town #

776
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,678
# Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa #

777
00:34:27,678 --> 00:34:29,404
# From out of the blue, girl #

778
00:34:29,404 --> 00:34:31,322
# Hey, this town's in a stew, girl #

779
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:33,144
# Ohh, what a hullabaloo, girl #

780
00:34:33,144 --> 00:34:34,870
# She ain't just passing through, girl #

781
00:34:34,966 --> 00:34:36,596
# Ohh, she's sticking like glue, girl #

782
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:38,130
# Woo, to the man
I thought I knew, girl #

783
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,761
# Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa #

784
00:34:39,856 --> 00:34:41,678
# Hey, look out for that movin' van #

785
00:34:41,774 --> 00:34:44,555
# Look out, look out,
look out, look out #

786
00:34:44,651 --> 00:34:49,829
# She was the new girl in #

787
00:34:49,925 --> 00:34:52,322
# Town #

788
00:34:57,309 --> 00:34:58,843
That's the way you do it.

789
00:34:58,939 --> 00:35:01,432
And I'm your fabled
Miss Motormouth Maybelle...

790
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,597
<i>your DJ du jour,
pitchin' rhythm your way.</i>

791
00:35:04,597 --> 00:35:07,282
So, hey, better stay
and shimmy and sway.

792
00:35:07,378 --> 00:35:09,775
We'll be right back with more Negro Day.

793
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,501
Brought to you by...

794
00:35:11,597 --> 00:35:14,665
Nap-a-Way, for stubborn hair.

795
00:35:16,104 --> 00:35:19,748
Every kink will be gone in a blink.

796
00:35:20,803 --> 00:35:21,857
We're off.

797
00:35:27,803 --> 00:35:28,858
Girls, that was great.

798
00:35:28,954 --> 00:35:31,926
How dare you pick the same song?

799
00:35:31,926 --> 00:35:33,365
They wrote it.

800
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,611
You watch yourself.

801
00:35:34,707 --> 00:35:37,296
You are one inch from being canceled.

802
00:35:37,296 --> 00:35:39,310
You know what your demographic is?

803
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,420
Cleaning ladies and lawn jockeys.

804
00:35:48,228 --> 00:35:50,338
A foot in the door, that's all it is.

805
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:52,064
One toe at a time.

806
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,571
Eh.

807
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:57,721
Hello?

808
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,310
Is this the Turnblad residence?

809
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,269
Yes.

810
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:03,379
Mr. Pinky speakin'.

811
00:36:03,379 --> 00:36:06,543
Mr. Pinky from-from the dress shop?

812
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:07,790
Uh-huh.

813
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,037
I'd like Tracy
for our spokesgirl.

814
00:36:09,037 --> 00:36:10,475
You want Tracy to do what?

815
00:36:10,571 --> 00:36:11,434
Be our spokesgirl.

816
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,393
Be a spokesgirl?

817
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:15,461
I think she'd be perfect.
I'd like to meet her...

818
00:36:15,557 --> 00:36:16,900
and discuss the details.

819
00:36:16,996 --> 00:36:18,146
As soon as possible.

820
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:21,215
OK, um, well, we'll have send
someone down to meet you.

821
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:22,174
Tonight, if you can.

822
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:25,243
So, um, oh, OK.
Bye-bye, Mr. Pinky.

823
00:36:25,243 --> 00:36:26,201
Bye-bye.

824
00:36:26,201 --> 00:36:27,256
The Mr. Pinky?

825
00:36:27,256 --> 00:36:29,174
From Mr. Pinky's hefty hideaway!

826
00:36:29,174 --> 00:36:30,229
A spokesgirl?!

827
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:33,393
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, tell me I get a free caftan, tell me!

828
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:36,462
Oh, Tracy, I think perks like
caftans have to be negotiated.

829
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:38,476
Maybe we should get you an agent.

830
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:40,394
OK. You be my agent.

831
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,311
What? Tracy Turnblad...

832
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:45,092
has fame gone to your head
and made you wacky?

833
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:46,147
Well, why not?

834
00:36:46,243 --> 00:36:47,106
Who's goin' to look out for me...

835
00:36:47,202 --> 00:36:48,161
better than my mom?

836
00:36:48,161 --> 00:36:50,079
Me, an agent?

837
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,284
You see me hobnobbin'
and drinkin' rum and cokes...

838
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,914
with all those hoi pollois?

839
00:36:53,914 --> 00:36:54,969
And out-negotiating them.

840
00:36:55,065 --> 00:36:56,312
Oh, you're crazy.

841
00:36:57,367 --> 00:37:00,531
Oh, Tracy, I haven't left
this house in-in years.

842
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:01,778
Then isn't it time you did?

843
00:37:01,778 --> 00:37:03,312
Oh, no, Tracy.

844
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:05,326
We'll have your father meet with him.

845
00:37:05,326 --> 00:37:07,819
L- I don't wanna be seen like this.

846
00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:08,778
Why not?

847
00:37:08,778 --> 00:37:10,983
I'll do it after my next diet.

848
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:12,422
That's when I'll do it.

849
00:37:12,422 --> 00:37:14,819
Ya see, the neighbors haven't
seen me since I was a size 10.

850
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:16,257
Don't make me do it, Tracy.

851
00:37:16,257 --> 00:37:19,422
Ma, it's changing out there.

852
00:37:19,518 --> 00:37:20,764
You'll like it.

853
00:37:20,764 --> 00:37:22,395
People who are different.

854
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,600
Their time is coming.

855
00:37:26,518 --> 00:37:29,203
# Hey, Mama, hey, Mama, look around #

856
00:37:29,203 --> 00:37:32,176
# Everybody's groovin'
to a brand-new sound #

857
00:37:32,176 --> 00:37:35,052
# Hey, Mama, hey, Mama follow me #

858
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,737
# I know somethin's in ya
that you wanna set free #

859
00:37:37,737 --> 00:37:40,614
# So let go, go, go of the past now #

860
00:37:40,614 --> 00:37:43,491
# Say hello to the love in your heart #

861
00:37:43,491 --> 00:37:46,272
# Yes, I know that
the world's spinning fast now #

862
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:48,477
# You gotta get yourself
a brand-new start #

863
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:51,162
# Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

864
00:37:51,162 --> 00:37:53,847
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

865
00:37:53,943 --> 00:37:56,820
# Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

866
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,697
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

867
00:37:59,793 --> 00:38:02,574
# Go, Mama, go, go, go #

868
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:05,355
# Welcome to the sixties #

869
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:06,697
# Oh-o-o-o-o oh #

870
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:11,108
# Hey, Mama, yeah, yeah, yeah #

871
00:38:11,204 --> 00:38:12,930
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

872
00:38:13,026 --> 00:38:15,327
# Hey, Mama, hey, Mama, have some fun #

873
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:18,588
# I haven't left this house since 1951 #

874
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,985
# Hey, Mama, hey, Mama, take a chance #

875
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:24,150
# Oh, Tracy, it's been years
since someone asked me to dance #

876
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,739
# So let go, go, go of the past now #

877
00:38:26,835 --> 00:38:29,807
# Say hello to the light in your eyes #

878
00:38:29,903 --> 00:38:32,492
# Yes, I know that the world's
spinning fast now #

879
00:38:32,492 --> 00:38:35,081
# But you gotta run
the race to win the prize #

880
00:38:35,177 --> 00:38:37,383
# Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

881
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:40,260
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

882
00:38:40,355 --> 00:38:43,136
# Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

883
00:38:43,232 --> 00:38:46,109
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

884
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:48,698
# Go, Mama, go, go, go #

885
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:51,575
# Welcome to the sixties #

886
00:38:51,575 --> 00:38:53,013
Ma, you did it!

887
00:38:53,013 --> 00:38:54,835
Oh, Tracy, I'm a little lightheaded.

888
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:57,328
There's so much air out here.

889
00:38:57,424 --> 00:38:59,438
Can't we go someplace that's stuffy?

890
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,356
No, Ma, you're on your way.

891
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:06,438
# Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

892
00:39:06,438 --> 00:39:09,507
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

893
00:39:09,603 --> 00:39:12,288
# Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

894
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:15,260
# Oh-o-o-o-o-o #

895
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,658
# Go, Mama, go, go, go #

896
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:19,863
Oh. They're so glamorous.

897
00:39:19,863 --> 00:39:20,918
Wow.

898
00:39:22,932 --> 00:39:24,562
It kicked.

899
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:25,713
Let's toast to that.

900
00:39:25,713 --> 00:39:26,768
To a boy!

901
00:39:26,768 --> 00:39:28,398
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

902
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:30,699
# Welcome to the rhythm
of a brand-new day #

903
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:32,521
# Take your old-fashioned fears #

904
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:33,959
# And just throw them away #

905
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:36,453
# You should add some color
and a fresh new 'do #

906
00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:38,083
# 'Cause it's time for a star #

907
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:40,672
# Who looks just like you #

908
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:44,891
Ohh.

909
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,193
Ah!

910
00:39:47,193 --> 00:39:48,343
Oh!

911
00:39:51,604 --> 00:39:53,330
I thought we marked these down.

912
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,289
What?

913
00:39:55,344 --> 00:39:56,398
Ohh.

914
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:01,577
Thank you, Nadine.

915
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,947
There's my shining star!

916
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:08,481
Fantastic to meet you!

917
00:40:08,577 --> 00:40:10,015
I'm Mr. Pinky.

918
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:11,262
It's so nice to meet you.

919
00:40:11,262 --> 00:40:15,673
Ha ha! Tracy, is this your older sister?

920
00:40:15,673 --> 00:40:17,495
Oh, my.

921
00:40:17,591 --> 00:40:20,372
Perhaps she'd like some
complimentary couture.

922
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:21,426
Couture?

923
00:40:21,426 --> 00:40:24,111
Now, if you'll just sign here.

924
00:40:24,111 --> 00:40:27,755
Flattery will not distract
Miss Turnblad's agent...

925
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:29,577
from reading the fine print.

926
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:31,303
Her agent?

927
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,317
Tracy, eat your donuts.

928
00:40:33,413 --> 00:40:34,564
Let's talk.

929
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,618
Mm-hmm.

930
00:40:35,618 --> 00:40:37,153
All right, let's see here.

931
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:39,550
All right. Now...

932
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:40,509
Mmm.

933
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:44,249
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No!

934
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:46,550
I want a non-exclusive contract.

935
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,043
Extensions by mutual option.

936
00:40:49,043 --> 00:40:51,345
And I want you to absorb
my 15 percent commission.

937
00:40:51,345 --> 00:40:52,687
Not a dime over 10!

938
00:40:53,646 --> 00:40:54,989
Throw in a bustier?

939
00:40:57,386 --> 00:40:58,345
Hmm.

940
00:40:58,345 --> 00:41:00,742
54 double D?

941
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:02,277
Triple E.

942
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:03,715
I hit the mother lode!

943
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:05,345
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

944
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:07,455
Care for a Baby Ruth?
I got one right here.

945
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:09,852
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

946
00:41:09,852 --> 00:41:12,825
# Oh, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

947
00:41:12,825 --> 00:41:15,893
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

948
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:18,387
# Go, Mama, go, go, go #

949
00:41:20,113 --> 00:41:22,798
# Don't-cha let nobody
try to steal your fun #

950
00:41:22,798 --> 00:41:25,770
# 'Cause a little touch of
lipstick never hurt no one #

951
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:28,551
# The future's got a million
roads for you to choose #

952
00:41:28,551 --> 00:41:31,812
# But you'll walk a little taller
in some high-heeled shoes #

953
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:34,401
# And once you find the style
that makes you feel like you #

954
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:35,839
# Something fresh,
something new #

955
00:41:35,935 --> 00:41:37,086
# Step on out, hear us shout #

956
00:41:37,182 --> 00:41:39,099
# Mama, that's your cue #

957
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:44,565
# Ba da ba da-ba-da #

958
00:41:49,648 --> 00:41:50,798
# Step on out, hear us shout #

959
00:41:50,894 --> 00:41:52,908
# Mama, that's your cue #

960
00:41:52,908 --> 00:41:55,209
# Hey, Tracy, hey, baby, look at me #

961
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:58,757
# I'm the cutest chickie
that you ever did see #

962
00:41:58,757 --> 00:42:01,251
# Hey, Tracy, hey, baby, look at us #

963
00:42:01,347 --> 00:42:04,032
# Where is there a team
that's half as fabulous #

964
00:42:04,127 --> 00:42:06,717
# I let go, go, go of the past now #

965
00:42:06,717 --> 00:42:09,689
# Said hello to this red carpet ride #

966
00:42:09,689 --> 00:42:12,662
# Yes, I know that the world's
spinning fast now #

967
00:42:12,758 --> 00:42:14,963
# Tell Lollobrigida to step aside #

968
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:17,169
# Your Mama's welcoming the sixties #

969
00:42:17,265 --> 00:42:20,142
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

970
00:42:20,142 --> 00:42:23,114
# Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baby #

971
00:42:23,114 --> 00:42:25,991
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

972
00:42:25,991 --> 00:42:29,539
# Go, Mama, go, go, go #

973
00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:33,183
# Welcome to the sixties #

974
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:35,772
# Open the door to the girl who has more #

975
00:42:35,772 --> 00:42:39,320
# She's a star, Tracy, go, go, go #

976
00:42:42,485 --> 00:42:43,923
# Hey, Mama, welcome to the sixties #

977
00:42:43,923 --> 00:42:45,074
# Your mama's hip, your mama's in #

978
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,800
# Hey, Mama #

979
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:49,197
# Your mama's lookin' at herself
and wonderin' "Where you been?" #

980
00:42:49,197 --> 00:42:50,348
# Where you been? #

981
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:52,266
# Your mama's lit, she's all aglow #

982
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:53,896
# Your mama, what she's holdin' back #

983
00:42:53,992 --> 00:42:55,526
# Your mama's gotta let go, go, go #

984
00:42:55,622 --> 00:42:58,019
# Welcome to the "six", to the "O" #

985
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:02,430
# To the apostrophe "s"
hey-yay, baby, yeah #

986
00:43:02,526 --> 00:43:03,581
# Oh-o-o-o-o #

987
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:11,157
# Oh, yeah #

988
00:43:11,157 --> 00:43:13,266
# Go, Mama, go, go, go #

989
00:43:13,266 --> 00:43:16,047
# Oh-o-o-o-o-o,
oh-o-o-o-o-o #

990
00:43:16,143 --> 00:43:20,266
# Oh-o-o-o-o go,
go, Mama, go, go, go! #

991
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,102
Mmm. Mmm.

992
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,499
Wait till Dad sees you.

993
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:27,938
Sees me?

994
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,143
He never notices what I wear.

995
00:43:30,143 --> 00:43:33,691
In 20 years, he's never even said to me,
"nice muumuu" or nothin'.

996
00:43:33,691 --> 00:43:34,938
Now he will.

997
00:43:34,938 --> 00:43:38,294
Well, maybe, if he leaves
that shop for 5 minutes.

998
00:43:38,294 --> 00:43:40,691
I swear, I don't know
what goes on down there.

999
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:42,034
Well.

1000
00:43:42,034 --> 00:43:45,007
Mrs. Turnblad.

1001
00:43:45,103 --> 00:43:47,500
I'd know whose mother
you were anywhere.

1002
00:43:47,596 --> 00:43:49,226
Really?

1003
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,281
Hello, Amber.

1004
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,007
Hello, Tracy.

1005
00:43:52,103 --> 00:43:55,363
Ma, this is Amber and Mrs. von Tussle.

1006
00:43:55,363 --> 00:43:57,952
Mrs. von Tussle is the station's manager.

1007
00:43:57,952 --> 00:44:00,062
Oh, the station manager.

1008
00:44:00,062 --> 00:44:03,514
Oh! Oh, it was so nice-a
you let her on that show.

1009
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:07,446
Well, Tracy certainly has...
redefined our standards. Ha ha!

1010
00:44:07,446 --> 00:44:08,596
That's for sure.

1011
00:44:08,692 --> 00:44:10,322
Let me guess...

1012
00:44:10,418 --> 00:44:12,336
brand-new dress?

1013
00:44:12,336 --> 00:44:13,679
Oh, yes.

1014
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:15,309
Well, you'll stop traffic.

1015
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:16,651
Ha ha ha.

1016
00:44:17,706 --> 00:44:19,528
It was nice meeting you. Tracy.

1017
00:44:23,076 --> 00:44:24,227
Bye, Tracy.

1018
00:44:25,377 --> 00:44:26,624
Ugh.

1019
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:29,693
Ma, don't listen to a word she says!

1020
00:44:29,693 --> 00:44:31,035
I'm takin' this back.

1021
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,090
Don't you dare.

1022
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,104
- I am.
- Don't you dare.

1023
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,638
Don't you know why she hates us?

1024
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:38,323
She's afraid I'll beat Amber
for Miss Teenage Hairspray.

1025
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:40,816
Really?

1026
00:44:40,816 --> 00:44:43,118
They can't put Tracy in special ed.

1027
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:44,172
I won't have it.

1028
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:46,474
I mean, even if I have to tutor her myself...

1029
00:44:46,474 --> 00:44:48,104
they cannot hold my friend back.

1030
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,926
- You're a saint.
- Mm.

1031
00:44:50,022 --> 00:44:53,282
Oh, and it's totally not true about her
and the entire football team.

1032
00:44:53,378 --> 00:44:54,625
I mean, please.

1033
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,502
Anybody can get grass stains
all over their back.

1034
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,899
Amber, stop it.

1035
00:44:59,899 --> 00:45:01,241
I'm sick-a you doin' that.

1036
00:45:01,337 --> 00:45:02,967
Just because she's a good dancer.

1037
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:04,694
Uh! I'm sorry.

1038
00:45:04,789 --> 00:45:06,515
You think that she can dance?

1039
00:45:06,611 --> 00:45:08,625
Well, maybe you'd rather
have her as your partner.

1040
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:10,447
You could get sponsored by Goodyear.

1041
00:45:10,447 --> 00:45:13,803
Excuse me. What is
going on back there?

1042
00:45:16,105 --> 00:45:17,735
Tracy, that's horrible.

1043
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:20,516
Mr. Flak does not have breasts.

1044
00:45:20,612 --> 00:45:23,584
What? No. I would-I would never.

1045
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,119
What... Oh.

1046
00:45:37,489 --> 00:45:40,270
Oh, and Mr. Larkin,
perhaps you'd like to share...

1047
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,722
with the rest of the class Patrick Henry's
immortal last words.

1048
00:45:44,968 --> 00:45:46,311
"Kiss my ass"?

1049
00:45:55,804 --> 00:45:57,530
You didn't have to do that, Link.

1050
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,777
Hey, no prob.

1051
00:45:58,873 --> 00:46:01,654
Besides, looks like
a cool scene down here.

1052
00:46:01,654 --> 00:46:02,900
Right.

1053
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,818
Hey, cool.

1054
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:07,887
Hey, Tracy!

1055
00:46:12,586 --> 00:46:13,640
Not quite, huh?

1056
00:46:14,887 --> 00:46:16,709
Ah, damn. Just when I was gettin' it.

1057
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:19,106
Listen, man,
you ain't gotta stop now.

1058
00:46:19,106 --> 00:46:21,120
My mom's havin' a platter party tonight.

1059
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,367
Y'all wanna come check it out?

1060
00:46:22,367 --> 00:46:23,997
Now?!

1061
00:46:24,093 --> 00:46:26,106
Would you mind if I, too, checked it out?

1062
00:46:26,202 --> 00:46:28,024
I've never been to North Avenue before.

1063
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,559
Uh, well, would it be safe?

1064
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:31,189
You know, for us?

1065
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:33,298
Calm down, cracker boy.

1066
00:46:33,298 --> 00:46:34,257
It's cool.

1067
00:46:34,257 --> 00:46:35,408
Wow.

1068
00:46:35,408 --> 00:46:37,326
Being invited places by colored people!

1069
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:38,956
It feels so hip!

1070
00:46:39,052 --> 00:46:42,792
I'm glad y'all feel that way
'cause, uh, not many people do.

1071
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:44,997
- Y'all know what I'm sayin'?
- Yeah, that's right.

1072
00:46:44,997 --> 00:46:47,299
# Hey! #

1073
00:46:47,299 --> 00:46:49,888
# I can't see why people look at me #

1074
00:46:49,984 --> 00:46:52,669
# And only see the color of my face #

1075
00:46:52,669 --> 00:46:56,121
# Ah, yeah, then there's those that try
to help, God knows #

1076
00:46:56,217 --> 00:46:59,381
# But always have to put me in my place #

1077
00:46:59,381 --> 00:47:02,258
# But I won't ask you to be color-blind #

1078
00:47:02,258 --> 00:47:05,518
# 'Cause if you pick the fruit then, girl,
you're sure to find #

1079
00:47:05,518 --> 00:47:08,779
# The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice #

1080
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:11,751
# I could say it ain't so but, darlin',
what's the use? #

1081
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:14,724
# The darker the chocolate,
the richer the taste #

1082
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,834
# And that's where it's at #

1083
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,135
# Now, baby, run and tell that #

1084
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:20,382
# Now run and tell that #

1085
00:47:20,478 --> 00:47:23,163
# Run and tell that #

1086
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:24,505
# Hey, yeah! #

1087
00:47:24,505 --> 00:47:26,711
# I can't see why people disagree #

1088
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:30,355
# Each time I tell 'em what
I know is true, oh, no #

1089
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,409
# And if you come #

1090
00:47:31,409 --> 00:47:33,231
# And see the world I'm from #

1091
00:47:33,327 --> 00:47:36,683
# I bet your heart is
gonna feel it, too, yeah #

1092
00:47:36,683 --> 00:47:39,464
# I could lie but, baby, let's be bold #

1093
00:47:39,464 --> 00:47:40,807
# vanilla can be nice #

1094
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:42,725
# But if the truth be told #

1095
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:45,314
# Blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice #

1096
00:47:45,314 --> 00:47:48,382
# I could say it ain't so but, darlin',
what's the use? #

1097
00:47:48,478 --> 00:47:51,547
# The darker the chocolate,
the richer the taste #

1098
00:47:51,547 --> 00:47:53,369
# And that's where it's at #

1099
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:55,574
# Oh, baby, baby, run and tell that #

1100
00:47:55,574 --> 00:47:57,205
# Run and tell that #

1101
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,739
# Go run and tell that #

1102
00:47:58,739 --> 00:47:59,985
# Run and tell that #

1103
00:48:00,081 --> 00:48:01,903
# Come on and run and tell that #

1104
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:03,054
# Run and tell that #

1105
00:48:03,054 --> 00:48:04,492
# Hey, run and tell #

1106
00:48:04,492 --> 00:48:05,643
# Go tell #

1107
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:07,849
# Run and tell that #

1108
00:48:10,438 --> 00:48:11,397
Link!

1109
00:48:11,397 --> 00:48:12,931
Link Larkin!

1110
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:16,958
# Hey, yeah! #

1111
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:20,506
# Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah #

1112
00:48:20,506 --> 00:48:21,561
- Whoo!
- Hey!

1113
00:48:21,657 --> 00:48:22,712
Whoo!

1114
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:25,685
# Whoo! #

1115
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:27,219
Come here, girl.

1116
00:48:27,315 --> 00:48:29,137
This is my sister, Little Inez.

1117
00:48:29,137 --> 00:48:30,767
Oh, I know Tracy Turnblad.

1118
00:48:30,767 --> 00:48:32,397
Good for you, girl.
You got on the show.

1119
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:34,123
- Well, you better be next.
- Ya got that right.

1120
00:48:34,123 --> 00:48:36,137
Oh, you know she is.
You better show 'em, girl.

1121
00:48:36,233 --> 00:48:37,767
Yeah!

1122
00:48:37,767 --> 00:48:40,932
# I'm tired of coverin' up all my pride #

1123
00:48:41,028 --> 00:48:43,617
# So give me five on the black hand side #

1124
00:48:43,617 --> 00:48:47,165
# I got a new way of movin'
and I got my own voice #

1125
00:48:47,165 --> 00:48:49,754
# So how can I help but
to shout and rejoice #

1126
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:53,302
# Oh, the people 'round here
can barely pay their rent #

1127
00:48:53,398 --> 00:48:56,274
# They try to make a dollar
outta fifteen cent #

1128
00:48:56,274 --> 00:48:59,247
# But we got a spirit
money just can't buy #

1129
00:48:59,343 --> 00:49:03,658
# It's deep as a river
and soars to the sky, to the sky! #

1130
00:49:03,658 --> 00:49:06,919
# Hey, I can't see the reason it can't be #

1131
00:49:07,014 --> 00:49:08,932
# The kinda world where
we all get our chance #

1132
00:49:09,028 --> 00:49:09,987
# Aw, yeah #

1133
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,330
# The time is now #

1134
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,823
# So we can show 'em how
just turn the music up #

1135
00:49:13,823 --> 00:49:16,124
# And let's all dance, yeah, yeah #

1136
00:49:16,124 --> 00:49:19,289
# 'Cause all things are equal
when it comes to love #

1137
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,261
# Well, that ain't quite true
'cause when push comes to shove #

1138
00:49:22,261 --> 00:49:25,138
# The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice #

1139
00:49:25,138 --> 00:49:28,686
# They say it ain't so but, darlin',
what's the use? #

1140
00:49:28,686 --> 00:49:31,467
# The darker the chocolate,
the richer the taste #

1141
00:49:31,467 --> 00:49:32,905
# And that's where it's at #

1142
00:49:32,905 --> 00:49:35,399
# Now, baby, baby, baby,
run and tell that #

1143
00:49:35,495 --> 00:49:38,467
# Run and tell that #

1144
00:49:38,563 --> 00:49:39,906
# Ah yeah, baby#
# Run and tell that #

1145
00:49:39,906 --> 00:49:41,728
# Go run and tell that #

1146
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:47,769
# G-g-g-g-go home
and run and tell that #

1147
00:49:47,769 --> 00:49:54,577
# Yeah, yeah #

1148
00:49:54,577 --> 00:50:01,577
# Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah #

1149
00:50:01,577 --> 00:50:03,303
# Whoo! #

1150
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:06,084
- Go, baby!
- Whoo!

1151
00:50:07,906 --> 00:50:09,345
It was horrible.

1152
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:11,358
Mom, he just danced on that bus...

1153
00:50:11,454 --> 00:50:12,893
with that great white whale
and those negroes.

1154
00:50:12,989 --> 00:50:14,139
No, honey.

1155
00:50:14,235 --> 00:50:17,016
Reeling him back in is
the easiest thing in the world.

1156
00:50:17,016 --> 00:50:19,318
Remember, I control his career.

1157
00:50:21,331 --> 00:50:22,290
Ohh.

1158
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:23,920
Now, don't worry.

1159
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,838
Mommy will take care of everything.

1160
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:52,305
Are you all hungry
for some good fun?

1161
00:50:54,031 --> 00:50:54,990
# Yeah #

1162
00:50:55,949 --> 00:50:59,305
# Bring on that pecan pie #

1163
00:50:59,305 --> 00:51:04,004
# Pour some sugar on it,
sugar, don't be shy #

1164
00:51:04,004 --> 00:51:08,798
# Scoop me up a mess
of that chocolate swirl #

1165
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:12,442
# Don't be stingy,
I'm a growin' girl #

1166
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:17,716
# I offer big love with no apology #

1167
00:51:17,812 --> 00:51:21,936
# How can I deny
the world the most of me? #

1168
00:51:22,031 --> 00:51:26,538
# I am not afraid
to throw my weight around #

1169
00:51:26,634 --> 00:51:30,086
# Pound by pound by pound #

1170
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:35,648
# Because I'm big,
blonde and beautiful #

1171
00:51:35,648 --> 00:51:40,059
# Face the fact,
it's simply irrefutable #

1172
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:44,279
# No one wants a meal
that only offers the least #

1173
00:51:44,279 --> 00:51:48,018
# When, girl, we're servin'
up the whole damn feast #

1174
00:51:50,128 --> 00:51:53,580
Well, looks like y'all
took a step outta bounds.

1175
00:51:53,676 --> 00:51:54,635
Now, who we got here?

1176
00:51:54,635 --> 00:51:56,553
Mom, I want you to meet my new friends.

1177
00:51:56,553 --> 00:51:59,046
This here is Link. Tracy Turnblad.

1178
00:51:59,046 --> 00:52:02,210
This is just so afro-tastic!

1179
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:03,937
And this young lady right here...

1180
00:52:04,032 --> 00:52:05,854
is Penny Pingleton.

1181
00:52:07,772 --> 00:52:09,786
I'm very pleased
and scared to be here.

1182
00:52:09,786 --> 00:52:14,101
Oh, now, honey. We got more reason
to be scared on your street.

1183
00:52:14,101 --> 00:52:15,923
Latoya, put that record down.

1184
00:52:15,923 --> 00:52:17,074
You gonna scratch it.

1185
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,129
Can't you keep your little girl...

1186
00:52:18,129 --> 00:52:19,088
Shall we dance?

1187
00:52:19,088 --> 00:52:20,238
Come on.

1188
00:52:21,485 --> 00:52:22,923
My name is Mike.

1189
00:52:22,923 --> 00:52:23,978
Mike?

1190
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,704
Yes, Mike.

1191
00:52:25,704 --> 00:52:26,759
Mike who?

1192
00:52:26,759 --> 00:52:27,814
It's Mike.

1193
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,732
Anyway, ahem...

1194
00:52:29,828 --> 00:52:31,650
I'm calling because
I have some information...

1195
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,280
about your daughter's whereabouts.

1196
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,006
- What?
- Right now, as we speak...

1197
00:52:35,006 --> 00:52:38,362
your daughter has entered
a hotbed of moral...

1198
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:40,184
turpentine.

1199
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,581
# Baby don't sleep #

1200
00:52:42,677 --> 00:52:44,691
# Baby don't eat #

1201
00:52:44,691 --> 00:52:49,390
# Baby just like another boink-boink #

1202
00:52:49,486 --> 00:52:52,266
Link, aren't you gonna get
in awful trouble for this?

1203
00:52:52,266 --> 00:52:53,993
I'm not plannin' on tellin' my dad.

1204
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,390
No, I mean in trouble
with someone else.

1205
00:52:56,486 --> 00:52:59,075
Hmm. Maybe.

1206
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,993
Maybe it's worth it.

1207
00:53:00,993 --> 00:53:04,157
I think knowin' you's the start
of a pretty big adventure.

1208
00:53:04,157 --> 00:53:05,116
Ahh!

1209
00:53:06,938 --> 00:53:09,431
Tracy Edna Turnblad!

1210
00:53:10,582 --> 00:53:12,596
Ooh, we get any more
white people in here...

1211
00:53:12,596 --> 00:53:14,034
this gonna be a suburb.

1212
00:53:16,336 --> 00:53:18,158
Do you know what I had to pay a cab...

1213
00:53:18,158 --> 00:53:19,596
just to consider comin' down here?

1214
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,034
Oh, uh, Mom-

1215
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,144
No call. You just disappear.

1216
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,637
And all mashed up against a crooner?

1217
00:53:25,637 --> 00:53:28,898
Um, Edna Turnblad, this is Link.

1218
00:53:30,144 --> 00:53:31,678
Come on, we're goin'.

1219
00:53:31,678 --> 00:53:34,076
And, Penny, go home before
your mother shoots you.

1220
00:53:34,076 --> 00:53:35,226
Miss Edna, is it?

1221
00:53:35,226 --> 00:53:37,432
Hi, I mean, you don't
have to rush off, you know.

1222
00:53:37,432 --> 00:53:39,542
Well, I do. I left my iron on.

1223
00:53:39,542 --> 00:53:41,172
Oh, your iron.

1224
00:53:41,172 --> 00:53:42,514
Well, before you go...

1225
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:44,144
you sure you
wouldn't like to have...

1226
00:53:44,144 --> 00:53:46,734
a little somethin' to eat?

1227
00:53:46,734 --> 00:53:48,843
Mmm-mmm.

1228
00:53:56,419 --> 00:53:58,145
Is that braised?

1229
00:53:58,145 --> 00:54:02,268
# Whoa oh oh oh oh oh #

1230
00:54:02,268 --> 00:54:05,816
# Slice me off a piece
of that hogshead cheese #

1231
00:54:05,912 --> 00:54:06,871
# Whoo! #

1232
00:54:06,871 --> 00:54:08,022
# And take a look inside #

1233
00:54:08,118 --> 00:54:10,803
# My book of recipes #

1234
00:54:10,803 --> 00:54:15,405
# Now, don't-cha sniff around
for somethin' fluffy and light #

1235
00:54:15,405 --> 00:54:19,912
# We need a man who brings
a man-size appetite #

1236
00:54:19,912 --> 00:54:24,803
# We'll use a pinch-a sugar
and a dash-a spice #

1237
00:54:24,899 --> 00:54:29,214
# I'll let you lick the spoon
because it tastes so nice #

1238
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:33,242
# We keep it in the oven
till it's good and hot #

1239
00:54:33,242 --> 00:54:37,365
# Keep on stirrin' till it hits the spot #

1240
00:54:37,461 --> 00:54:42,639
# Because I'm big,
blonde and beautiful #

1241
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:47,146
# There is nothin' 'bout us
that's unsuitable #

1242
00:54:47,146 --> 00:54:50,886
# Why sit in the bleachers
timid and afraid #

1243
00:54:50,982 --> 00:54:55,585
# When, Edna, you look
like the whole parade? #

1244
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,557
# They say that white
has might and thin is in #

1245
00:54:58,557 --> 00:54:59,996
# Well, that's just bull #

1246
00:55:00,092 --> 00:55:01,913
# 'Cause, ladies, big is back #

1247
00:55:01,913 --> 00:55:05,078
# And as for black, it's beautiful #

1248
00:55:05,174 --> 00:55:06,900
# All shapes and sizes follow me #

1249
00:55:06,996 --> 00:55:13,900
# Who wants a twig when
you can climb a whole tree #

1250
00:55:14,092 --> 00:55:15,434
# Yeah, yeah #

1251
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:21,188
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah #

1252
00:55:21,188 --> 00:55:23,585
Groovy, baby. Groovy.

1253
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:33,654
Hello?

1254
00:55:56,956 --> 00:55:58,298
Hello?!

1255
00:56:07,984 --> 00:56:09,326
- Graah!
- Oh, my God!

1256
00:56:09,422 --> 00:56:12,011
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
Ah! You got me.

1257
00:56:12,011 --> 00:56:13,449
Ha ha ha!

1258
00:56:13,545 --> 00:56:16,806
Welcome, mmm,
to the Hardy-Har Hut.

1259
00:56:16,902 --> 00:56:19,682
If we can't put a smile on your face,
your skin's too tight.

1260
00:56:19,778 --> 00:56:21,696
- Oh!
- Bop, bop.

1261
00:56:21,696 --> 00:56:23,710
- Oh.
- I got somethin' for ya. Yeah.

1262
00:56:23,806 --> 00:56:25,052
It's just in.

1263
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:26,299
You're gonna love it.

1264
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,546
Huh?

1265
00:56:27,642 --> 00:56:29,176
Oh.

1266
00:56:29,272 --> 00:56:30,998
Cigarette?

1267
00:56:32,244 --> 00:56:33,779
Ha ha ha.

1268
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:37,519
Tempting but, uh... no, thanks.

1269
00:56:37,614 --> 00:56:38,765
- Ha ha ha!
- Oh.

1270
00:56:38,765 --> 00:56:40,491
Well, eh.

1271
00:56:42,025 --> 00:56:43,560
What can I do you for?

1272
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,710
Something for the mister?

1273
00:56:44,806 --> 00:56:48,642
Sadly, there is no mister at the moment.

1274
00:56:48,642 --> 00:56:50,464
Beautiful woman like yourself?

1275
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,574
My husband...

1276
00:56:55,259 --> 00:56:57,368
...accidentally suffocated.

1277
00:56:57,464 --> 00:56:58,807
You need a fella.

1278
00:56:58,807 --> 00:57:02,547
I do. I do need a fella.

1279
00:57:02,547 --> 00:57:07,149
And the way to a man's heart
is through his funny bone.

1280
00:57:07,149 --> 00:57:09,355
Now here's an icebreaker for ya.

1281
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,150
Oh, Miss Maybelle,
you do throw a lovely party.

1282
00:57:14,245 --> 00:57:16,067
But what are you celebratin'?

1283
00:57:17,026 --> 00:57:18,752
Well, it's kind of an ending.

1284
00:57:18,752 --> 00:57:21,150
But it deserved to go out with a bang.

1285
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:22,876
What ended?

1286
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:25,465
Negro Day.

1287
00:57:25,561 --> 00:57:27,095
What?

1288
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:30,068
All right. Time y'all knew.

1289
00:57:30,164 --> 00:57:33,999
velma von Tussle just told me
we have had our last show.

1290
00:57:34,095 --> 00:57:35,534
No.

1291
00:57:35,534 --> 00:57:37,835
Yeah, it seems our little show
was a nice little placeholder...

1292
00:57:37,835 --> 00:57:39,945
- but it was time to get some ratings.
- Aww!

1293
00:57:39,945 --> 00:57:42,150
I didn't wanna tell y'all up front.

1294
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:44,739
I just wanted to have a little fun tonight.

1295
00:57:44,739 --> 00:57:46,945
But I practiced so hard.

1296
00:57:46,945 --> 00:57:49,438
Now I'll never get a chance
to be on the show.

1297
00:57:49,438 --> 00:57:51,068
Oh, you will be seen, baby.

1298
00:57:51,164 --> 00:57:52,123
I promise.

1299
00:57:52,123 --> 00:57:53,657
You can't have your own show?

1300
00:57:53,753 --> 00:57:55,192
Fine, you'll come dance with us.

1301
00:57:55,192 --> 00:57:56,726
Hmm. Honey.

1302
00:57:56,726 --> 00:57:58,452
You been dozin' off durin' history?

1303
00:57:58,548 --> 00:58:00,562
Yes, always.

1304
00:58:00,562 --> 00:58:03,438
Trace, black and whites ain't never danced
on Tv together.

1305
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,836
Well, if we can't dance...

1306
00:58:05,932 --> 00:58:08,904
maybe we should just march.

1307
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:13,028
Ooh, that'd get some big ol' ratin's.

1308
00:58:13,028 --> 00:58:14,562
Better time slot, too.

1309
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:15,617
Mm-hmm.

1310
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,631
Like on the 11:00 news.

1311
00:58:17,631 --> 00:58:18,589
Ahh!

1312
00:58:18,589 --> 00:58:19,836
What y'all say?

1313
00:58:19,932 --> 00:58:21,370
Should we give this fine woman...

1314
00:58:21,466 --> 00:58:22,617
all the ratings she deserves?

1315
00:58:22,617 --> 00:58:24,343
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1316
00:58:24,343 --> 00:58:25,590
Hey, hey!

1317
00:58:25,686 --> 00:58:27,987
Well, it is a school night...

1318
00:58:27,987 --> 00:58:29,425
and I think we oughta call it a night.

1319
00:58:29,521 --> 00:58:32,302
Tell you what.
We meet up at the church Friday, 4:00...

1320
00:58:32,302 --> 00:58:35,275
<i>and we will march on WYZT.</i>

1321
00:58:35,371 --> 00:58:37,480
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1322
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,439
Yeah!

1323
00:58:38,535 --> 00:58:40,165
Tracy, you can't protest, hon.

1324
00:58:40,261 --> 00:58:42,179
I mean, these are lovely people...

1325
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:43,905
but if you protest, you'll be on lists.

1326
00:58:43,905 --> 00:58:45,439
You'll be on files.

1327
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,549
J. Edgar Hoover'll be still wiretappin'...

1328
00:58:47,549 --> 00:58:49,275
your cold, dead body in the grave.

1329
00:58:49,371 --> 00:58:50,426
Oh, Mother.

1330
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:53,303
Link, we're going with them, right?

1331
00:58:53,303 --> 00:58:55,508
Walk with me.

1332
00:58:55,508 --> 00:58:59,152
You want your Belgian chocolate
animal droppings.

1333
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,275
Dot dot. This store's for you.

1334
00:59:03,275 --> 00:59:07,303
- Oh! What a treasure trove.
- Huh?

1335
00:59:07,303 --> 00:59:09,892
Come here, baby.

1336
00:59:09,892 --> 00:59:11,522
Don't be sad.

1337
00:59:11,618 --> 00:59:13,344
We gonna make it happen, OK?

1338
00:59:13,344 --> 00:59:14,399
Can I go?

1339
00:59:14,495 --> 00:59:15,742
Now, come on, now.

1340
00:59:15,742 --> 00:59:17,084
I can't be worried about you out there.

1341
00:59:18,522 --> 00:59:20,344
Trace...

1342
00:59:20,344 --> 00:59:22,934
I been smilin' and dancin'
on this show for 3 years.

1343
00:59:24,084 --> 00:59:25,235
Mrs. von Tussle just promised...

1344
00:59:25,235 --> 00:59:26,865
I could sing at the Miss Hairspray pageant.

1345
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:29,838
She's-she invited agents.

1346
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:32,043
That's my shot, Trace.

1347
00:59:32,043 --> 00:59:33,673
I can't jeopardize that.

1348
00:59:33,769 --> 00:59:35,879
But it's what's right.

1349
00:59:35,879 --> 00:59:37,605
I'm sorry, Trace.

1350
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:40,386
I just think this adventure's...

1351
00:59:40,386 --> 00:59:41,633
a little...

1352
00:59:41,633 --> 00:59:42,879
too big for me.

1353
00:59:45,564 --> 00:59:47,098
Oh, God. No, no, no.
That's not what I-

1354
00:59:47,194 --> 00:59:49,112
I get it, Link. It's your shot.

1355
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:50,551
No, Trace, that's not what I-

1356
00:59:50,551 --> 00:59:51,510
It's fine.

1357
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,729
Oh, hon.

1358
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:01,195
I should go.

1359
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:02,729
Give him time.

1360
01:00:02,825 --> 01:00:04,743
He'll figure out he's crazy 'bout you.

1361
01:00:04,743 --> 01:00:07,907
You have to say that,
you're my mother.

1362
01:00:07,907 --> 01:00:10,976
Well, I know a little
somethin' about men.

1363
01:00:11,072 --> 01:00:15,099
And, my personal favorite,
x- ray specs.

1364
01:00:15,099 --> 01:00:16,729
You can see through anything.

1365
01:00:16,825 --> 01:00:20,181
Skin, clothes, you name it.

1366
01:00:20,277 --> 01:00:21,524
Now, take your father.

1367
01:00:21,524 --> 01:00:24,305
And he's always downstairs
in that shop workin' late.

1368
01:00:24,305 --> 01:00:26,606
Do I take it personal? No.

1369
01:00:26,606 --> 01:00:29,195
Men always put their career first.

1370
01:00:29,195 --> 01:00:30,346
Remember that.

1371
01:00:30,346 --> 01:00:31,401
OK.

1372
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:33,511
I'm really tired, I'm gonna go to bed.

1373
01:00:33,511 --> 01:00:34,565
All right, hon.

1374
01:00:34,661 --> 01:00:35,620
Night.

1375
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:37,634
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1376
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,648
I think I'm gonna go to bed, too.

1377
01:00:39,648 --> 01:00:41,566
Oh, I'm so tired.

1378
01:00:46,936 --> 01:00:50,100
You don't need those...

1379
01:00:50,196 --> 01:00:53,169
to see what's under these clothes.

1380
01:00:53,169 --> 01:00:55,758
There's a product that really works...

1381
01:00:55,854 --> 01:00:58,347
'cause these are phony
as a three dollar bill.

1382
01:01:02,182 --> 01:01:04,004
Incredible!

1383
01:01:04,004 --> 01:01:05,826
I could do a fan dance with a lettuce leaf...

1384
01:01:05,922 --> 01:01:08,895
and you would remain completely obtuse.

1385
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,854
Obtuse.

1386
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:11,388
Yes, obtuse.

1387
01:01:11,388 --> 01:01:13,114
I flunked geometry.

1388
01:01:13,114 --> 01:01:15,703
Yeah, well-and biology too, no doubt!

1389
01:01:15,703 --> 01:01:17,238
Yeah.

1390
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:20,594
Wait! How 'bout this?

1391
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:22,032
OK.

1392
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,731
# Those lips, those eyes #

1393
01:01:26,731 --> 01:01:28,074
# That food #

1394
01:01:28,074 --> 01:01:30,279
# Well, there ain't nothin' like a spread #

1395
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:32,197
# To get ya in the mood #

1396
01:01:32,197 --> 01:01:36,416
# Wilbur, can't ya feel the
burnin' flame of hot desire #

1397
01:01:36,512 --> 01:01:38,909
# You're gonna need
more than some seltzer #

1398
01:01:38,909 --> 01:01:41,307
# To put out this fire #

1399
01:01:41,307 --> 01:01:44,663
# I'm wailin': "look out, old Balti- #

1400
01:01:44,759 --> 01:01:46,581
# "- more" I'm sellin' somethin' #

1401
01:01:46,677 --> 01:01:49,841
# You can't purchase
at a ten-cent store #

1402
01:01:49,937 --> 01:01:52,238
# Oh, Wilbur, I feel like a princess #

1403
01:01:52,238 --> 01:01:53,869
# Come on and take me to the ball #

1404
01:01:53,869 --> 01:01:56,554
# I bet you're tired of heavy lifting #

1405
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,663
# Get your hands on somethin' small #

1406
01:01:59,718 --> 01:02:01,348
# Because I'm a-big- #

1407
01:02:01,348 --> 01:02:02,499
# -blonde- #

1408
01:02:02,499 --> 01:02:04,513
# -and beautiful #

1409
01:02:04,609 --> 01:02:06,527
# It's time to face the facts #

1410
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:09,020
# It's irrefutable #

1411
01:02:09,116 --> 01:02:10,938
# Why waste one more minute #

1412
01:02:10,938 --> 01:02:13,047
# Now I feel brand spankin' new #

1413
01:02:13,047 --> 01:02:14,582
# Hey, Wilbur, take a look #

1414
01:02:14,582 --> 01:02:15,636
# It's all for #

1415
01:02:15,636 --> 01:02:16,883
You!

1416
01:02:16,883 --> 01:02:19,088
You?!

1417
01:02:19,184 --> 01:02:20,047
Ohh!

1418
01:02:20,143 --> 01:02:21,198
Edna.

1419
01:02:21,198 --> 01:02:24,650
Your wife! You said she was out! Oh!
Wait a minute!

1420
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:25,801
Hi, hon.

1421
01:02:27,431 --> 01:02:30,500
Ma, you don't really believe
that he would do that.

1422
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,897
You are never setting foot
on that show again.

1423
01:02:32,897 --> 01:02:34,431
You hear me?

1424
01:02:34,431 --> 01:02:37,979
I heard you the first 400 times, Ma.

1425
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:01,761
- Hey.
- Huh.

1426
01:03:01,761 --> 01:03:03,007
Oh.

1427
01:03:07,227 --> 01:03:08,186
Daddy.

1428
01:03:09,144 --> 01:03:11,254
It wasn't me.

1429
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:14,035
I had to improvise
a bed out of something.

1430
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:15,473
Whoopee cushions?

1431
01:03:16,624 --> 01:03:18,638
That will play heck with my sciatica.

1432
01:03:19,597 --> 01:03:21,706
Oop. That one was me.

1433
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:23,912
Oh. Oh.

1434
01:03:23,912 --> 01:03:26,117
Daddy, are you OK?

1435
01:03:26,213 --> 01:03:27,844
Ohh.

1436
01:03:27,939 --> 01:03:31,008
Tracy, you know...

1437
01:03:31,008 --> 01:03:35,707
these peepers have never
looked at another woman.

1438
01:03:35,803 --> 01:03:38,967
This heart only beats for size 60.

1439
01:03:39,063 --> 01:03:42,227
Daddy, you know what velma wanted.

1440
01:03:42,323 --> 01:03:44,337
She wanted me off the show.

1441
01:03:44,337 --> 01:03:48,556
And I knew that,
but how could she go that far?

1442
01:03:48,556 --> 01:03:51,721
Come here. Come here, little girl.

1443
01:03:51,721 --> 01:03:53,926
Little girl.

1444
01:03:54,022 --> 01:03:57,474
And then to just cancel
Negro Day like that.

1445
01:03:57,570 --> 01:04:00,255
Just to make sure that
nobody who's different...

1446
01:04:00,351 --> 01:04:02,365
or who's black or Chinese...

1447
01:04:02,461 --> 01:04:04,954
or maybe who needs to lose a few pounds.

1448
01:04:04,954 --> 01:04:06,872
What are you talking? Stop it.

1449
01:04:06,872 --> 01:04:09,461
What are you talking?

1450
01:04:09,461 --> 01:04:11,667
I think I've been in a bubble or something.

1451
01:04:11,667 --> 01:04:15,215
Thinking that fairness
was just going to happen.

1452
01:04:15,215 --> 01:04:16,749
It's not.

1453
01:04:16,749 --> 01:04:19,817
I think people like me
are gonna have to get up...

1454
01:04:19,913 --> 01:04:24,037
off their father's laps and go
out there and fight for it.

1455
01:04:31,229 --> 01:04:33,626
Ahh. Your mother and I...

1456
01:04:33,626 --> 01:04:35,832
We don't see too far
past our front door.

1457
01:04:35,927 --> 01:04:39,284
But you... see all the way to Schenectady.

1458
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:43,023
So, if there's something
you need to stand up for...

1459
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,476
don't ya listen to old dogs like us.

1460
01:04:46,476 --> 01:04:49,640
We need to learn some new tricks...

1461
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:50,983
from you.

1462
01:04:51,078 --> 01:04:53,763
You don't need new tricks, Dad.

1463
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:55,681
You need Mom.

1464
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:03,736
She changed the locks.

1465
01:05:09,202 --> 01:05:10,736
Oh.

1466
01:05:14,764 --> 01:05:16,394
Good night, Daddy.

1467
01:05:24,737 --> 01:05:27,997
Aw, wow.

1468
01:05:28,093 --> 01:05:29,819
Come on, baby.

1469
01:05:34,038 --> 01:05:35,669
Honey, took me 5 years...

1470
01:05:35,764 --> 01:05:37,778
to figure out you were flirting.

1471
01:05:37,874 --> 01:05:40,080
How could I ever?

1472
01:05:41,614 --> 01:05:43,915
Well, she is very glamorous.

1473
01:05:43,915 --> 01:05:46,217
Edna.

1474
01:05:50,052 --> 01:05:53,121
She just makes me feel old.

1475
01:05:53,217 --> 01:05:54,559
Nonsense.

1476
01:05:54,655 --> 01:05:56,381
Doll!

1477
01:05:56,477 --> 01:05:58,299
You're spry as a Slinky.

1478
01:06:00,313 --> 01:06:02,519
I'm not talkin' to you.

1479
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:06,738
# Styles keep a-changin',
the world's rearrangin' #

1480
01:06:06,738 --> 01:06:10,765
# But, Edna,
you're timeless to me #

1481
01:06:10,765 --> 01:06:14,217
# Hemlines are shorter,
a beer costs a quarter #

1482
01:06:14,313 --> 01:06:19,204
# But time cannot take what comes free #

1483
01:06:19,204 --> 01:06:22,368
# You're like a stinky old cheese, babe #

1484
01:06:22,464 --> 01:06:26,875
# Just gettin' riper with age #

1485
01:06:26,971 --> 01:06:29,273
# You're like a fatal disease, babe #

1486
01:06:29,369 --> 01:06:30,519
What?

1487
01:06:30,615 --> 01:06:34,259
# But there's no cure,
so let this fever rage #

1488
01:06:34,259 --> 01:06:38,095
# Some folks can't stand it,
say time is a bandit #

1489
01:06:38,191 --> 01:06:41,739
# But I take the opposite view #

1490
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:44,328
# 'Cause when I need a lift #

1491
01:06:44,328 --> 01:06:46,054
# Time brings a gift #

1492
01:06:46,054 --> 01:06:49,985
# Another day with you #

1493
01:06:49,985 --> 01:06:51,712
# A twist or a waltz #

1494
01:06:51,712 --> 01:06:53,725
# It's all the same schmaltz #

1495
01:06:53,821 --> 01:06:57,273
# With just a change in the scenery #

1496
01:06:57,369 --> 01:06:59,575
# You'll never be old hat #

1497
01:06:59,575 --> 01:07:00,534
# That's that #

1498
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:03,410
# You're timeless to me #

1499
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,726
# Fads keep a-fadin' #

1500
01:07:07,726 --> 01:07:09,835
# Castro's invadin' #

1501
01:07:09,835 --> 01:07:13,575
# But, Wilbur,
you're timeless to me #

1502
01:07:13,575 --> 01:07:15,205
# Hairdos are higher #

1503
01:07:15,205 --> 01:07:17,315
# Mine feels like barbed wire #

1504
01:07:17,315 --> 01:07:21,342
# But you say I'm chic as can be #

1505
01:07:21,342 --> 01:07:24,315
# You're like a rare vintage ripple #

1506
01:07:24,411 --> 01:07:25,370
Thank you.

1507
01:07:25,466 --> 01:07:29,301
# A vintage they'll never forget #

1508
01:07:29,301 --> 01:07:32,754
# So pour me a teeny-weeny triple #

1509
01:07:32,754 --> 01:07:34,192
Any time!

1510
01:07:34,288 --> 01:07:36,493
# And we can toast the fact
we ain't dead yet #

1511
01:07:36,493 --> 01:07:37,452
What?

1512
01:07:37,452 --> 01:07:39,083
# I can't stop eating #

1513
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:40,713
# Your hairline's receding #

1514
01:07:40,713 --> 01:07:41,863
Hey.

1515
01:07:41,863 --> 01:07:43,877
# And soon
you'll have nothing at all #

1516
01:07:43,877 --> 01:07:45,124
Never.

1517
01:07:45,124 --> 01:07:47,233
# So you'll wear a wig #

1518
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:48,768
# While I roast a pig #

1519
01:07:48,768 --> 01:07:51,549
# Hey! Pass that Geritol #

1520
01:07:51,549 --> 01:07:52,795
I love pig.

1521
01:07:52,795 --> 01:07:54,809
# Glenn Miller had brass #

1522
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:56,823
# That Chubby Checker's a gas #

1523
01:07:56,823 --> 01:08:00,275
# But they all pass eventually #

1524
01:08:00,371 --> 01:08:03,535
# You'll never be passé, hip-hooray #

1525
01:08:03,535 --> 01:08:06,604
# You're timeless to me #

1526
01:08:17,536 --> 01:08:19,549
Heh heh heh!

1527
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:28,851
Grrr!

1528
01:08:56,084 --> 01:08:59,345
# You're like a broken-down Chevy #

1529
01:08:59,345 --> 01:09:03,180
# All I need is a fresh coat of paint #

1530
01:09:03,276 --> 01:09:07,496
# And, Edna, ya got me
goin' hot and heavy #

1531
01:09:07,496 --> 01:09:09,222
# You're fat and old #

1532
01:09:09,318 --> 01:09:11,811
- What?
- # But, baby, boring you ain't #

1533
01:09:11,907 --> 01:09:13,633
# Some folks don't get it #

1534
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:15,647
# But we never fret it #

1535
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:19,003
# 'Cause we know
that time is our friend #

1536
01:09:19,099 --> 01:09:21,304
# Yeah, it's plain to see #

1537
01:09:21,304 --> 01:09:23,414
# That you're stuck with me #

1538
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:27,250
# Until the bitter end #

1539
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,989
# And we got a kid who's blowin' the lid #

1540
01:09:31,085 --> 01:09:34,346
# Off the Turnblad family tree #

1541

# You'll always hit the spot #

1542
01:09:36,743 --> 01:09:38,277
# Big shot #

1543
01:09:38,373 --> 01:09:40,866
# You're timeless to me #

01:10:27,087 --> 01:10:28,333
Oh, Wilbur.

1552
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:35,142
Tracy.

1553
01:10:35,142 --> 01:10:36,484
Wake up, hon.

1554
01:10:36,484 --> 01:10:39,840
Wake up. Everything's good again.

1555
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:43,676
Wilbur! Wilbur!

1556
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:44,827
Uhh!

1557
01:10:46,073 --> 01:10:49,430
Seaweed, help pass
those signs out.

1558
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:50,868
Give her one.

1559
01:10:50,868 --> 01:10:52,594
Hey, Jackie, we're over here.

1560
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:55,183
Aw, you
lookin' good, Gertrude.

1561
01:10:55,279 --> 01:10:57,101
C'mon, y'all.
Here we go now.

1562
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:00,841
Tracy!

1563
01:11:02,567 --> 01:11:04,581
You're gonna pay a heavy price.

1564
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:05,923
I know.

1565
01:11:05,923 --> 01:11:07,745
You'll never dance on Tv again.

1566
01:11:07,841 --> 01:11:10,047
If I can't dance
with Seaweed and Little Inez...

1567
01:11:10,047 --> 01:11:12,444
then I don't wanna dance on Tv at all.

1568
01:11:12,444 --> 01:11:15,608
I just want tomorrow to be better.

1569
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:18,965
# There's a light #

1570
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:23,567

01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:30,759
# Though the night
is black as my skin #

1572

1574

# But I know where I've been #

1579
01:12:03,555 --> 01:12:07,007
# There's a cry askin' why #

1580
01:12:07,007 --> 01:12:11,226
# I pray the answer's up ahead #

1581
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:18,802
# 'Cause I know where I've been #

# We been travelin' #

1584
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:35,008

1585
01:12:35,008 --> 01:12:37,597
# On the way #

1586
01:12:39,227 --> 01:12:46,611

1587
01:12:46,611 --> 01:12:49,104

# The price we had to pay #

1589

- # In the future #
- # Ooh-ooh #

1591
01:13:02,529 --> 01:13:05,022
# There's a struggle #

1592
01:13:05,022 --> 01:13:09,049
# That we have yet to win #

1593
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:14,515
# And there's pride in my heart #

1594
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:19,022
# 'Cause I know where I'm goin' #

1595
01:13:19,022 --> 01:13:20,940
# Yes, I do #

1596
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:25,831
# And I know where I've been #

1597
01:13:25,927 --> 01:13:26,885
# Yeah #

1598
01:13:26,885 --> 01:13:30,338
# There's a road #

1599
01:13:30,338 --> 01:13:34,557
# We must travel #

1600
01:13:34,557 --> 01:13:36,571
# There's a promise #

1601
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:38,872
# There is a promise #

1602
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:40,215
# We must make #

1603
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:42,324
# That we must make #

1604
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,242
# But the riches #

1605
01:13:44,338 --> 01:13:46,448
# Oh, but the riches #

1606
01:13:46,448 --> 01:13:47,502
# Will be plenty #

1607
01:13:47,502 --> 01:13:50,379
# The riches will be plenty, yeah #

1608
01:13:50,379 --> 01:13:52,393
# Worth the risk #

1609
01:13:52,489 --> 01:13:54,503
# And the chances that we take #

1610
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:58,338
# And the chances we take #

1611
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,023
# There's a dream #

1612
01:14:01,023 --> 01:14:06,681
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, in the future #

1613
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:07,928
# There's a struggle #

1614
01:14:08,023 --> 01:14:08,887
# Struggle #

1615
01:14:08,982 --> 01:14:11,571
# That we have yet to win #

1616
01:14:11,571 --> 01:14:14,161
# We have yet to win #

1617
01:14:14,256 --> 01:14:15,983
# Use that pride #

1618
01:14:15,983 --> 01:14:16,941
# Pride #

1619
01:14:16,941 --> 01:14:18,859
# In our hearts #

1620
01:14:18,859 --> 01:14:19,818
# To lift us up #

1621
01:14:19,818 --> 01:14:20,777
# Lift us up #

1622
01:14:20,777 --> 01:14:22,791
# Until tomorrow #

1623
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,942
# Oooh #

1624
01:14:23,942 --> 01:14:29,312
# 'Cause just to sit
still would be a sin #

1625
01:14:29,408 --> 01:14:32,956
# I know it, I know it,
I know where I'm goin' #

1626
01:14:32,956 --> 01:14:40,723
# Lord knows I know #

1627
01:14:40,819 --> 01:14:44,942
# Where I've been #

1628
01:14:44,942 --> 01:14:46,860
# Oh, when we win #

1629
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:50,312
# Yeah, I'll give thanks to my God #

1630
01:14:50,408 --> 01:14:55,011
# 'Cause I know where I've been #

1631
01:14:55,011 --> 01:14:59,901
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

1632
01:14:59,997 --> 01:15:02,203
Oh, yeah, amen!

1633
01:15:02,203 --> 01:15:03,162
Amen, amen!

1634
01:15:03,162 --> 01:15:04,313
That's right.

1635
01:15:04,408 --> 01:15:07,189
Tracy, hon, you don't
know what you're doing.

1636
01:15:07,285 --> 01:15:08,724
Yes, I do, Ma.

1637
01:15:08,724 --> 01:15:09,682
Hello, Miss Maybelle.

1638
01:15:09,682 --> 01:15:10,641
Well, good evening, Miss Edna.

1639
01:15:10,737 --> 01:15:11,696
Nice-a you to join us.

1640
01:15:11,792 --> 01:15:12,943
She's got a lovely turnout.

1641
01:15:12,943 --> 01:15:14,573
Now I really think they
don't need you anymore.

1642
01:15:14,573 --> 01:15:15,724
You come home with me.

1643
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:18,217
Oh.

1644
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:20,422
No, we are not sending a camera crew.

1645
01:15:20,422 --> 01:15:23,683
They're protesting
our own station, dimwit.

1646
01:15:24,738 --> 01:15:26,368
Why is Channel Five there?

1647
01:15:27,614 --> 01:15:30,012
Well, of course they're all Negroes.

1648
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:31,450
And why would-?

1649
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:34,519
Ahh! Ohh.

1650
01:15:34,519 --> 01:15:35,861
I know who would.

1651
01:15:35,861 --> 01:15:37,875
Oh, I know exactly who would.

1652
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:39,793
2, 4, 6, 8!

1653
01:15:39,793 --> 01:15:41,807
Tv's got to integrate!

1654
01:15:41,807 --> 01:15:45,450
2, 4, 6, 8! Tv's got to integrate!

1655
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:46,409
2, 4, 6, 8!

1656
01:15:46,409 --> 01:15:47,752
Oh, my God, no!

1657
01:15:47,848 --> 01:15:48,903
Tv's got to integrate!

1658
01:15:48,903 --> 01:15:49,957
- No!
- Ma, come on.

1659
01:15:50,053 --> 01:15:51,108
The sound's not working.

1660
01:15:51,108 --> 01:15:52,259
You knew there'd be police.

1661
01:15:52,355 --> 01:15:54,848
- But I didn't know there'd be cameras.
- So?

1662
01:15:54,848 --> 01:15:57,245
Oh, I cannot be seen on television
at this present weight.

1663
01:15:57,245 --> 01:15:58,684
2, 4, 6, 8!

1664
01:15:58,684 --> 01:16:00,506
Tv's got to integrate!

1665
01:16:00,602 --> 01:16:02,328
2, 4, 6, 8!

1666
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:04,341
Tv's got to integrate!

1667
01:16:04,437 --> 01:16:06,163
2, 4, 6, 8!

1668
01:16:06,163 --> 01:16:07,122
Tv's got to integrate!

1669
01:16:07,122 --> 01:16:08,273
Excuse me.

1670
01:16:08,369 --> 01:16:10,383
Is there some reason
we can't pass by peacefully?

1671
01:16:10,478 --> 01:16:12,684
I strongly suggest you
and your little friends...

1672
01:16:12,684 --> 01:16:15,369
head back to where you come from.

1673
01:16:15,369 --> 01:16:16,424
Hey, you don't have to be so rude.

1674
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,479
Tracy!

1675
01:16:17,575 --> 01:16:19,492
It's all right, Tracy.
I can handle this.

1676
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,410
'Scuse me. She was talking to you.

1677
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,136
- Oh, Tracy!
- Oh!

1678
01:16:23,136 --> 01:16:24,862
Tracy, no.

1679
01:16:24,958 --> 01:16:26,780
You just assaulted a police officer, miss.

1680
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,794
- No!
- I what?!

1681
01:16:28,794 --> 01:16:29,753
Assaulted?!

1682
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:32,246
Enough! Hey!

1683
01:16:33,876 --> 01:16:35,411
All right, boys.

1684
01:16:35,506 --> 01:16:37,520
Let's take the whole lot in.

1685
01:16:37,616 --> 01:16:39,438
- No!
- Run, Tracy! Run!

1686
01:16:39,534 --> 01:16:42,986
2, 4, 6, 8! Tv's got to integrate!

1687
01:16:42,986 --> 01:16:46,055
2, 4, 6, 8!
Tv's got to integrate!

1688
01:16:46,055 --> 01:16:49,027
2, 4, 6, 8! Tv's got to integrate!

1689
01:16:49,123 --> 01:16:52,000
2, 4, 6, 8!
Tv's got to integrate!

1690
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,397
And our cameras also
caught Tracy Turnblad...

1691
01:16:54,397 --> 01:16:57,370
the teenage Tv personality
and rabble-rouser.

1692
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:59,096
Miss Turnblad brutally
attacked a sergeant...

1693
01:16:59,192 --> 01:17:00,630
with a blunt instrument
before fleeing the scene...

1694
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:03,315
You see? You see?

1695
01:17:03,315 --> 01:17:05,329
If I let you leave the house...

1696
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,726
right now you'd be in prison
fighting whores for cigarettes.

1697
01:17:07,822 --> 01:17:10,028
That Tracy Turnblad always
was a bad influence.

1698
01:17:10,028 --> 01:17:13,288
Well, you are never, ever gonna see that
beehived harlot again.

1699
01:17:13,384 --> 01:17:15,206
OK, Mother. Excuse me.

1700
01:17:15,206 --> 01:17:16,261
Penny?

1701
01:17:16,261 --> 01:17:17,987
Pray for her.

1702
01:17:17,987 --> 01:17:20,480
She's gonna need it.

1703
01:17:21,823 --> 01:17:23,549
Tracy! Tracy!

1704
01:17:23,549 --> 01:17:26,330
She's not here, I told you.

1705
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:27,960
Hon, she knows...

1706
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,302
if the cops are lookin' for her...

1707
01:17:29,398 --> 01:17:31,604
this is the first place they'll come.

1708
01:17:34,001 --> 01:17:36,878
What this must-a put you through, Wilbur.

1709
01:17:36,974 --> 01:17:38,316
I'm so sorry.

1710
01:17:38,316 --> 01:17:39,275
I'm not.

1711
01:17:39,371 --> 01:17:40,234
You're not?

1712
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:41,193
I'm proud-a you.

1713
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:42,344
You are?

1714
01:17:42,344 --> 01:17:44,933
Baby, somebody had to do somethin'.

1715
01:17:44,933 --> 01:17:48,769
'Course, we may be eating beans
for the next 10 years.

1716
01:17:49,919 --> 01:17:51,454
Bail for 20's kind of pricey.

1717
01:17:51,549 --> 01:17:53,371
You bailed all those people out?

1718
01:17:53,371 --> 01:17:54,810
Ya upset with me?

1719
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:55,961
I'm sorry.

1720
01:17:55,961 --> 01:17:58,645
Hon, it just seemed like the right thing.

1721
01:17:58,645 --> 01:18:01,618
Oh, Wilbur, it was the right thing.

1722
01:18:02,673 --> 01:18:06,413
Knights in armor
don't come any shinier than you.

1723
01:18:06,413 --> 01:18:08,331
But where's our little girl?

1724
01:18:11,016 --> 01:18:12,262
Are you OK, Trace?

1725
01:18:12,262 --> 01:18:14,084
Oh, you have no idea.

1726
01:18:15,235 --> 01:18:16,194
Come on.

1727
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:17,249
Thank you so much.

1728
01:18:17,249 --> 01:18:18,975
You're such a great friend.

1729
01:18:18,975 --> 01:18:20,701
Thanks.

1730
01:18:20,797 --> 01:18:23,098
Penny, the cops are looking for me
everywhere.

1731
01:18:23,194 --> 01:18:25,016
You could go to jail for helping me.

1732
01:18:25,016 --> 01:18:27,605
Tracy, I'm already in jail. Come on.

1733
01:18:30,194 --> 01:18:31,153
Oh, no.

1734
01:18:31,153 --> 01:18:32,592
- What?
- Your hair deflated.

1735
01:18:32,592 --> 01:18:33,838
Oh, let it.

1736
01:18:33,838 --> 01:18:36,427
It was just a symbol
of my conformity to the man.

1737
01:18:36,427 --> 01:18:37,578
You are so tough.

1738
01:18:37,578 --> 01:18:39,496
So, what do ya think?

1739
01:18:39,496 --> 01:18:40,934
Maybe you could live down here.

1740
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:43,044
I don't even know why we
have this room down here...

1741
01:18:43,044 --> 01:18:44,578
but there's food, water...

1742
01:18:44,674 --> 01:18:48,222
first aid kit, gas mask,
Russian-language books.

1743
01:18:48,222 --> 01:18:49,660
It's very well-insulated.

1744
01:18:49,756 --> 01:18:51,387
It won't be where you're going.

1745
01:18:51,387 --> 01:18:52,921
The police are on their way.

1746
01:18:52,921 --> 01:18:54,647
Mom, please don't send my best friend
to the big house.

1747
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:55,893
Penny, hush.

1748
01:18:55,989 --> 01:18:57,811
You haven't heard the last
of me, Mrs. Pingleton.

1749
01:18:57,811 --> 01:18:58,962
Things need to change...

1750
01:18:58,962 --> 01:19:00,880
and I won't stop tryin' to change them.

1751
01:19:00,976 --> 01:19:02,318
I don't care how long it takes.

1752
01:19:02,318 --> 01:19:04,236
Good, you'll be waiting 20 to life.

1753
01:19:04,236 --> 01:19:05,387
Get the jump rope, Penny.

1754
01:19:05,387 --> 01:19:06,633
Mom, not the jump rope!

1755
01:19:06,633 --> 01:19:08,072
Don't you touch my canned tuna.

1756
01:19:09,223 --> 01:19:11,620
You wait till your father
gets out of prison.

1757
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:13,921
You'll see more than a jump rope, missy!

1758
01:19:14,017 --> 01:19:17,182
A massive manhunt is
underway for Miss Turnblad...

1759
01:19:17,182 --> 01:19:20,058
who bludgeoned sergeant and
decorated Korean war veteran...

1760
01:19:20,154 --> 01:19:22,648
Mike Morris with a crowbar,
shattering his jaw...

1761
01:19:22,648 --> 01:19:24,278
That is a lie.

1762
01:19:24,278 --> 01:19:26,867
They're talkin' about our baby, Wilbur.

1763
01:19:26,963 --> 01:19:28,113
They're tellin' lies.

1764
01:19:28,113 --> 01:19:29,360
Sergeant Morris is in critical condition.

1765
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,798
This is such a Midol moment.

1766
01:19:31,757 --> 01:19:34,346
Wilbur, that-Oh! Maybe that's her.
Oh, that's her.

1767
01:19:34,346 --> 01:19:36,744
Is that you, Tracy?

1768
01:19:37,894 --> 01:19:40,100
Oh, Link. I thought you'd be Tracy.

1769
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,018
Uh, no. L-I was just at home, uh...

1770
01:19:42,018 --> 01:19:43,744
practicing my new twist on the twist...

1771
01:19:43,744 --> 01:19:45,662
and I overheard it on the news.

1772
01:19:45,758 --> 01:19:48,826
I can't believe Tracy savagely bludgeoned
an Eagle Scout.

1773
01:19:48,922 --> 01:19:50,456
That's just not like her.

1774
01:19:50,456 --> 01:19:51,607
Well, it's not true, I was there.

1775
01:19:51,607 --> 01:19:52,854
He didn't even bleed.

1776
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:54,196
I shoulda been there...

1777
01:19:54,196 --> 01:19:55,922
beside her.

1778
01:19:55,922 --> 01:19:57,936
I can't sleep, I can't eat.

1779
01:19:58,032 --> 01:19:59,087
You can't eat?

1780
01:19:59,087 --> 01:20:01,196
Well, come on in and worry with us.

1781
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:02,731
I'll make you some pork.

1782
01:20:02,827 --> 01:20:05,799
Penny Lou Pingleton, you are absolutely...

1783
01:20:05,799 --> 01:20:08,101
positively, permanently punished.

1784
01:20:08,197 --> 01:20:11,457
You will live on a diet
of saltines and Tang...

1785
01:20:11,553 --> 01:20:14,909
and you will never leave
this room again.

1786
01:20:17,594 --> 01:20:19,896
Devil child! Devil child!

1787
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:29,772
Seaweed. Shh, don't let her hear you.

1788
01:20:29,772 --> 01:20:31,307
Penny, what happened to you?

1789
01:20:31,403 --> 01:20:33,033
She's punishing me
for harboring a fugitive...

1790
01:20:33,129 --> 01:20:34,088
without her permission.

1791
01:20:34,088 --> 01:20:35,622
What are you doing?

1792
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:38,307
I'm here to rescue the fair maiden, baby.

1793
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:45,499
Oh, Seaweed, you do care.

1794
01:20:45,595 --> 01:20:48,472
I was afraid the colors of
our skin would keep us apart.

1795
01:20:48,567 --> 01:20:50,773
No. These knots might.

1796
01:20:50,869 --> 01:20:52,883
W- Was your mom in the navy?

1797
01:20:57,485 --> 01:21:02,088
# Once I was a selfish fool
who never understood #

1798
01:21:02,088 --> 01:21:04,198
# Never looked inside myself #

1799
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:06,979
# Though on the outside, I looked good #

1800
01:21:06,979 --> 01:21:11,582
# Then we met and you made me
the man I am today #

1801
01:21:11,678 --> 01:21:15,801
# Tracy, I'm in love with you,
no matter what you weigh #

1802
01:21:15,801 --> 01:21:17,335
# 'Cause without love #

1803
01:21:17,431 --> 01:21:20,596
# Life is like the seasons
with no summer #

1804
01:21:20,596 --> 01:21:22,322
# Without love #

1805
01:21:22,322 --> 01:21:25,294
# Life is rock 'n' roll without a drummer #

1806
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:27,596
# Tracy, I'll be yours forever #

1807
01:21:27,596 --> 01:21:29,897
# 'Cause I never wanna be #

1808
01:21:29,897 --> 01:21:33,637
# Without love #

1809
01:21:33,637 --> 01:21:35,459
# Tracy, never set me free #

1810
01:21:36,801 --> 01:21:38,815
# No, I ain't lyin' #

1811
01:21:38,815 --> 01:21:40,254
# Never set me free #

1812
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:43,130
# Tracy, no, no, no #

1813
01:21:44,569 --> 01:21:48,980
# Livin' in the ghetto,
black is everywhere ya go #

1814
01:21:49,076 --> 01:21:51,377
# Who'd've thought I'd love a girl #

1815
01:21:51,377 --> 01:21:54,158
# Whose skin was white
as winter snow? #

1816
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:55,788
# In my ivory tower #

1817
01:21:55,788 --> 01:21:58,377
# Life was just a hostess snack #

1818
01:21:58,473 --> 01:22:00,391
# But now I've tasted chocolate #

1819
01:22:00,391 --> 01:22:02,597
# And I'm never going back #

1820
01:22:02,693 --> 01:22:04,419
# 'Cause without love #

1821
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:07,775
# Life is like a beat
that you can't follow #

1822
01:22:07,775 --> 01:22:09,405
# Without love #

1823
01:22:09,405 --> 01:22:12,474
# Life is Doris Day at the Apollo #

1824
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:14,679
# Darling, I'll be yours forever #

1825
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:16,981
# 'Cause I never wanna be #

1826
01:22:16,981 --> 01:22:20,241
# Without love #

1827
01:22:20,241 --> 01:22:23,693
# So, darling, never set me free, no #

1828
01:22:23,789 --> 01:22:27,912
# I'm yours forever,
never set me free #

1829
01:22:28,008 --> 01:22:30,310
# No, no, no #

1830
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:36,159
# If I'm left without my baby doll #

1831
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,940
# I don't know what I'll do #

1832
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:40,474
# Link, I've got to break out #

1833
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:43,543
# So that I can get my hands on you #

1834
01:22:43,543 --> 01:22:47,858
# Girl, if I can't touch you,
then I'm gonna lose control #

1835
01:22:47,858 --> 01:22:50,351
# Seaweed, you're
my black white knight #

1836
01:22:50,351 --> 01:22:52,269
# I've found my blue-eyed soul #

1837
01:22:52,365 --> 01:22:54,954
# Sweet freedom is our goal #

1838
01:22:54,954 --> 01:22:57,255
# Trace, I wanna kiss ya! #

1839
01:22:57,351 --> 01:22:59,365
# Let me out at the next toll! #

1840
01:22:59,365 --> 01:23:01,091
# Without love #

1841
01:23:01,091 --> 01:23:03,968
# Life is like a prom that won't invite us #

1842
01:23:03,968 --> 01:23:05,215
# Without love #

1843
01:23:05,215 --> 01:23:08,859
# It's like getting my big break
and laryngitis #

1844
01:23:08,954 --> 01:23:10,297
# Without love #

1845
01:23:10,297 --> 01:23:13,461
# Life's a 45 when you can't buy it #

1846
01:23:13,461 --> 01:23:14,996
# Without love #

1847
01:23:14,996 --> 01:23:18,160
# Life is like my mother on a diet #

1848
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,462
# Like a week that's only Mondays #

1849
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:22,763
# Only ice cream, never sundaes #

1850
01:23:22,763 --> 01:23:25,256
# Like a circle with no center #

1851
01:23:25,352 --> 01:23:27,270
# Like a door marked "do not enter" #

1852
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:30,051
# Darling, I'll be yours forever #

1853
01:23:30,051 --> 01:23:32,065
# 'Cause I never wanna be #

1854
01:23:32,065 --> 01:23:35,613
# Without love #

1855
01:23:35,613 --> 01:23:37,243
# Yes, now you've captured me #

1856
01:23:37,243 --> 01:23:39,928
# Without love #

1857
01:23:39,928 --> 01:23:42,133
# I surrender happily #

1858
01:23:42,133 --> 01:23:44,722
# Without love #

1859
01:23:44,722 --> 01:23:47,120
# Oh, Seaweed, never set me free #

1860
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,270
# No, no, no #

1861
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:49,996
# I ain't lyin' #

1862
01:23:49,996 --> 01:23:52,681
# Never set me free #

1863
01:23:52,681 --> 01:23:54,503
# No, no, no #

1864
01:23:54,503 --> 01:23:56,134
# No, I don't wanna live without #

1865
01:23:56,134 --> 01:23:58,435
# Love, love, love #

1866
01:23:58,435 --> 01:24:00,065
# Pretty Penny little #

1867
01:24:00,065 --> 01:24:03,134
# Darling, you had best believe me #

1868
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:06,778
# Never leave me without love #

1869
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:08,696
Link.

1870
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:10,134
Your pork is ready.

1871
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:11,093
Uh, Mama, I-

1872
01:24:11,189 --> 01:24:12,435
You tryin' to hide her here?

1873
01:24:12,435 --> 01:24:14,353
Uh.

1874
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,326
Why you ain't think-a that before?

1875
01:24:17,422 --> 01:24:18,668
Everything she done for us.

1876
01:24:18,668 --> 01:24:19,723
Where your manners at, boy?

1877
01:24:19,819 --> 01:24:20,874
Ow! Well, I don't know.

1878
01:24:22,504 --> 01:24:24,038
And what about this one?

1879
01:24:24,038 --> 01:24:26,340
Seaweed's got a girlfriend.

1880
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:27,395
Inez, shut up.

1881
01:24:27,491 --> 01:24:28,833
- You.
- Oh.

1882
01:24:28,929 --> 01:24:31,134
So this is love.

1883
01:24:31,134 --> 01:24:32,956
Well, love is a gift.

1884
01:24:32,956 --> 01:24:34,683
Lotta people don't remember that.

1885
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:37,080
So you two better brace yourselves...

1886
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,998
for a whole lotta ugly comin' at you...

1887
01:24:39,094 --> 01:24:41,011
from a never-ending parade of stupid.

1888
01:24:41,107 --> 01:24:42,642
So you met my mom?

1889
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:47,340
Hello?

1890
01:24:47,436 --> 01:24:49,066
- Mom?
- Tracy, are you OK?

1891
01:24:49,066 --> 01:24:50,313
- Yes, I'm safe.
- Oh, my God.

1892
01:24:50,313 --> 01:24:51,368
- Mom, listen.
- Where are you?

1893
01:24:51,464 --> 01:24:52,614
- I need your help.
- What?

1894
01:24:52,614 --> 01:24:54,820
Tomorrow's the Miss
Teenage Hairspray pageant.

1895
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:55,779
Tracy, you-

1896
01:24:55,779 --> 01:24:57,026
I need you to come down to the station.

1897
01:24:57,026 --> 01:24:57,984
Well-well, Tracy-

1898
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,135
- Dress nice.
- What?

1899
01:24:59,135 --> 01:25:00,094
Penny will meet you out front.

1900
01:25:00,094 --> 01:25:01,149
Now let me talk to Dad.

1901
01:25:01,149 --> 01:25:02,875
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1902
01:25:02,875 --> 01:25:04,505
Turn your face this way.

1903
01:25:04,601 --> 01:25:05,752
The other way. Go.

1904
01:25:05,848 --> 01:25:08,245
Everybody,
please take your seats.

1905
01:25:08,245 --> 01:25:11,505
The Miss Teenage Hairspray
pageant is about to begin.

1906
01:25:16,588 --> 01:25:18,985
Oh, you've come on a very exciting day.

1907
01:25:18,985 --> 01:25:21,766
It's our first live show.

1908
01:25:21,766 --> 01:25:23,108
<i>Oh! Bye Bye, Birdie.</i>

1909
01:25:23,108 --> 01:25:25,314
Oh, my Amber is perfect for that.

1910
01:25:25,314 --> 01:25:27,711
She's the pretty little blonde. Ha ha!

1911
01:25:28,862 --> 01:25:34,711
And we're live in 5, 4, 3...

1912
01:25:37,396 --> 01:25:40,848
And now, broadcast live
in front of a live studio audience...

1913
01:25:40,944 --> 01:25:43,054
for the first time from the certified...

1914
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:45,164
<i>up-to-code WYZT studio...</i>

1915
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:48,712
<i>it's the Corny Collins Miss Hairspray
spectacular.</i>

1916
01:25:48,712 --> 01:25:50,534
- He's Corny.
- He's Corny.

1917
01:25:50,534 --> 01:25:53,794
Brought to you by Ultra Clutch hairspray.

1918
01:25:53,794 --> 01:25:56,767
# What gives a girl power and punch #

1919
01:25:56,767 --> 01:25:58,301
# Is it charm, is it poise #

1920
01:25:58,301 --> 01:26:00,123
# No, it's hairspray #

1921
01:26:00,219 --> 01:26:03,383
# What gets a gal asked out to lunch #

1922
01:26:03,479 --> 01:26:07,315
# Is it brains, is it dough
No, it's hairspray #

1923
01:26:07,315 --> 01:26:09,904
# If you take a ride with
no can at your side... #

1924
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,685
"and preserve our family
through our father. " Hmm.

1925
01:26:12,685 --> 01:26:15,466
"Let us make our father drink
wine, and let us lie with him. "

1926
01:26:15,466 --> 01:26:17,384
# You can take off in a rocket #

1927
01:26:17,384 --> 01:26:20,356
# And in outer space each
hair will be in place... #

1928
01:26:20,452 --> 01:26:21,986
Link, the agents are here. Look.

1929
01:26:21,986 --> 01:26:24,096
# Why take a chance when
you get up and dance? #

1930
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,726
# If you twist, I insist #

1931
01:26:25,822 --> 01:26:28,603
# You use hairspray
and tell your mother... #

1932
01:26:28,603 --> 01:26:30,137
Maybe they'll sign us together.

1933
01:26:30,233 --> 01:26:31,288
# Her head she should smother #

1934
01:26:31,288 --> 01:26:34,069
# With Ultra Clutch faithfully #

1935
01:26:34,069 --> 01:26:35,220
Well?

1936
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:38,384
There's no sign of her.
We're on every door. She's not inside.

1937
01:26:38,384 --> 01:26:40,494
Doesn't mean she won't try.

1938
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:42,699
velma, I seriously doubt
this girl's gonna risk...

1939
01:26:42,699 --> 01:26:44,425
incarceration to win a pageant.

1940
01:26:44,425 --> 01:26:45,480
# That's me! #

1941
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,302
I risked communicable diseases.

1942
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:49,699
She'll certainly risk jail.

1943
01:26:49,699 --> 01:26:52,384
# Better than hairspray #

1944
01:26:52,384 --> 01:26:55,357
# That's me #

1945
01:26:55,453 --> 01:27:00,535
# Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh,
ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh #

1946
01:27:00,631 --> 01:27:03,796
# Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh #

1947
01:27:03,796 --> 01:27:06,864
# What makes a man
reach out and touch? #

1948
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,590
# Ultra Clutch #

1949
01:27:10,316 --> 01:27:13,960
# So if you're a redhead,
a blonde, or brunette #

1950
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,207
Whoo!

1951
01:27:15,303 --> 01:27:18,851
# Just take my advice
and you might just get #

1952
01:27:18,851 --> 01:27:22,591
# The only thing better
than hairspray #

1953
01:27:22,591 --> 01:27:25,276
# That's me #

1954
01:27:25,372 --> 01:27:26,235
Ah!

1955
01:27:26,331 --> 01:27:27,385
# He's Corny Collins #

1956
01:27:27,385 --> 01:27:30,837
# The only thing better
than hairspray #

1957
01:27:30,933 --> 01:27:32,659
- # Hairspray #
- Wow!

1958
01:27:32,659 --> 01:27:35,344
# That's me #

1959
01:27:37,934 --> 01:27:40,331
Hey, baby, you look like
you could use a stiff one.

1960
01:27:42,249 --> 01:27:46,852
# Whoo-ooo #

1961
01:27:46,947 --> 01:27:49,153
And we are out.

1962
01:27:50,304 --> 01:27:51,838
Link, you sprayed it right in my face!

1963
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:53,564
What'd I tell you about that?

1964
01:27:53,564 --> 01:27:55,578
Stop! You guys.

1965
01:27:55,578 --> 01:27:56,537
Uh, powder.

1966
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:57,687
And we're back.

1967
01:27:57,687 --> 01:27:59,222
5, 4.

1968
01:27:59,222 --> 01:28:00,181
Here?

1969
01:28:00,181 --> 01:28:01,331
3.

1970
01:28:03,057 --> 01:28:05,359
And now for the talent
portion of our competition...

1971
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:06,605
our Councilettes...

1972
01:28:06,605 --> 01:28:09,290
in their Miss Teenage Hairspray
official dance-off.

1973
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:10,249
Uh!

1974
01:28:13,606 --> 01:28:17,633
First off, we have the sunny
pride of Highlandtown, Darla.

1975
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:24,346
Hello, Darla.

1976
01:28:24,442 --> 01:28:25,880
Miss Teenage Hairspray.

1977
01:28:25,976 --> 01:28:27,510
Your vote is for?

1978
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:29,140
This little girl could power...

1979
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:30,675
all of greater downtown Baltimore...

1980
01:28:30,675 --> 01:28:33,168
with her energy-Lou Ann.

1981
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:38,538
Who are you voting for?
Lou Ann?

1982
01:28:38,634 --> 01:28:40,456
very good, thank you.

1983
01:28:43,045 --> 01:28:45,634
All right.

1984
01:28:45,634 --> 01:28:49,182
Ladies and gentlemen,
the almost too happy Tammy.

1985
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:02,031
And thank you, Tammy.

1986
01:29:09,032 --> 01:29:10,374
Confirmed sighting.

1987
01:29:10,374 --> 01:29:11,333
What?

1988
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:13,155
You three: Outside, now.

1989
01:29:13,155 --> 01:29:14,114
We can't go out th-

1990
01:29:14,114 --> 01:29:15,073
No, no. No buts. Out, out!

1991
01:29:15,073 --> 01:29:16,032
Out! Out, out, out, out!

1992
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,566
Whatever you say, Mrs. von Tussle.

1993
01:29:17,662 --> 01:29:19,100
Whoo!

1994
01:29:22,648 --> 01:29:25,046
Aw, she's too cute, isn't she?

1995
01:29:25,142 --> 01:29:26,484
Hold it right there, Tracy.

1996
01:29:27,443 --> 01:29:28,881
Looking for someone?

1997
01:29:28,977 --> 01:29:31,087
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

1998
01:29:31,087 --> 01:29:33,005
- Ha.
- A what?

1999
01:29:33,005 --> 01:29:34,251
It was a diversion.

2000
01:29:34,251 --> 01:29:36,169
Oh, please, these people are
not capable of a diversion.

2001
01:29:36,169 --> 01:29:37,799
It's beyond their mental capacity.

2002
01:29:37,895 --> 01:29:38,950
I wouldn't be so sure, velma.

2003
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:40,005
Oh, my God.

2004
01:29:40,005 --> 01:29:41,156
What if she's already in the building?

2005
01:29:41,156 --> 01:29:43,074
What if she's been here for hours...

2006
01:29:43,074 --> 01:29:44,512
and you've locked yourselves out?

2007
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:45,567
What?

2008
01:29:45,663 --> 01:29:47,197
- Check the doors!
- Let's go!

2009
01:29:47,197 --> 01:29:48,827
It's locked!

2010
01:29:48,827 --> 01:29:49,978
They're all locked!

2011
01:29:49,978 --> 01:29:52,855
And now a fast girl
who loves to slow dance...

2012
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:55,348
our own smooth-as-silk Shelley.

2013
01:29:56,690 --> 01:29:57,745
Ohh!

2014
01:29:57,841 --> 01:30:00,047
Keep goin'. Keep goin'. That's it.

2015
01:30:00,047 --> 01:30:01,197
Come on.

2016
01:30:01,197 --> 01:30:02,252
Put your backs into it, men.

2017
01:30:02,252 --> 01:30:03,499
Put your backs into it this time.

2018
01:30:05,129 --> 01:30:07,334
Come on, one more time.
One more time.

2019
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:09,924
Come on, come on, come on.

2020
01:30:16,636 --> 01:30:18,746
Here's our little dynamic
duo from Conkling Street.

2021
01:30:20,184 --> 01:30:22,102
Double your fun
with Noreen and Doreen.

2022
01:30:22,102 --> 01:30:23,253
What is with you people?

2023
01:30:23,253 --> 01:30:24,979
I mean, how hard is it
to beat down a door?

2024
01:30:24,979 --> 01:30:27,184
That hairspray battering ram was heavy.

2025
01:30:27,184 --> 01:30:28,335
Heavy?

2026
01:30:28,335 --> 01:30:30,828
How could they be heavy, they're...

2027
01:30:30,828 --> 01:30:31,883
hollow.

2028
01:30:33,801 --> 01:30:35,047
Move it.

2029
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:36,486
Let's get 'em. Let's go.

2030
01:30:54,993 --> 01:30:56,240
And, of course...

2031
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:58,637
our three-time
Miss Hairspray champion...

2032
01:30:58,733 --> 01:31:01,514
the ever-charming, Amber.

2033
01:31:03,048 --> 01:31:04,007
Oh, my God.

2034
01:31:04,007 --> 01:31:06,596
You carried her in!

2035
01:31:06,596 --> 01:31:07,843
Go!

2036
01:31:16,185 --> 01:31:17,816
Ow!

2037
01:31:17,816 --> 01:31:18,870
It's locked.

2038
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:19,829
Open it!

2039
01:31:21,172 --> 01:31:22,227
Let's give
a final round of applause...

2040
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:24,720
to our Miss Teenage
Hairspray contestants.

2041
01:31:29,514 --> 01:31:30,473
Hey.

2042
01:31:37,953 --> 01:31:39,296
All right, all right.

2043
01:31:41,405 --> 01:31:43,707
We are so close to announcing...

2044
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:45,145
the new Miss Teenage Hairspray.

2045
01:31:45,145 --> 01:31:46,200
Look at that board.

2046
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,077
What a nail-biter this one is turning into.

2047
01:31:50,419 --> 01:31:52,241
Ladies and gentlemen, the final tally.

2048
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:03,173
It is my...

2049
01:32:03,269 --> 01:32:04,419
obligation...

2050
01:32:05,474 --> 01:32:07,488
to announce that Amber von Tussle...

2051
01:32:07,488 --> 01:32:09,406
Is about to get out-danced.

2052
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:12,762
Tracy Turnblad!

2053
01:32:17,749 --> 01:32:18,899
What!?

2054
01:32:20,146 --> 01:32:22,735
# You can't stop an avalanche #

2055
01:32:22,735 --> 01:32:25,228
# As it races down the hill #

2056
01:32:25,324 --> 01:32:28,009
# You can try to stop the seasons, girl #

2057
01:32:28,009 --> 01:32:30,598
# But 'cha know you never will #

2058
01:32:30,598 --> 01:32:33,379
# And you can try
to stop my dancin' feet #

2059
01:32:33,379 --> 01:32:36,448
# But I just cannot stand still #

2060
01:32:36,544 --> 01:32:39,229
# 'Cause the world keeps
spinnin' round and round #

2061
01:32:39,229 --> 01:32:41,530
# And my heart's keepin' time
to the speed of sound #

2062
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:43,640
# I was lost till I heard the drums #

2063
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:45,941
- # Then I found my way #
- No.

2064
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:47,667
- # 'Cause you can't stop the beat #
- Link!

2065
01:32:47,667 --> 01:32:49,681
# Ever since this old world began #

2066
01:32:49,681 --> 01:32:51,215
# A woman found out if she shook it #

2067
01:32:51,215 --> 01:32:52,462
# She could shake up a man #

2068
01:32:52,462 --> 01:32:53,421
# And so I'm gonna
shake and shimmy it #

2069
01:32:53,421 --> 01:32:54,667
This throne is mine!

2070
01:32:54,763 --> 01:32:56,489
# The best that I can today #

2071
01:32:56,489 --> 01:32:58,215
# 'Cause you can't stop #

2072
01:32:58,215 --> 01:32:59,366
Aah! Let me down!

2073
01:32:59,462 --> 01:33:00,613
# The motion of the ocean
or the sun in the sky #

2074
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:03,202
# You can wonder if you wanna
but I never ask why #

2075
01:33:03,202 --> 01:33:04,736
# And if you try to hold me down #

2076
01:33:04,832 --> 01:33:05,983
# I'm gonna spit in your eye #

2077
01:33:05,983 --> 01:33:07,517
# And say #

2078
01:33:07,613 --> 01:33:10,585
# That you can't stop the beat #

2079
01:33:14,038 --> 01:33:15,284
They love you, Link.

2080
01:33:19,216 --> 01:33:20,175
Yeah?

2081
01:33:20,271 --> 01:33:21,325
Not for long.

2082
01:33:22,572 --> 01:33:24,682
Inez, come on!

2083
01:33:26,312 --> 01:33:27,463
Let's dance.

2084
01:33:31,682 --> 01:33:33,791
Little Miss Inez Stubbs!

2085
01:33:33,791 --> 01:33:35,038
Ladies and gentlemen.

2086
01:33:35,038 --> 01:33:36,285
Look at my baby go.

2087
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:45,394
- Inez.
- Inez?

2088
01:33:51,244 --> 01:33:52,778
- Mm.
- Come on.

2089
01:33:58,436 --> 01:33:59,874
Oh! There you go!

2090
01:33:59,874 --> 01:34:00,833
Give her a hand, folks!

2091
01:34:00,833 --> 01:34:02,655
Little Miss Inez Stubbs!

2092
01:34:02,655 --> 01:34:04,669
Ladies and gentlemen.

2093
01:34:08,696 --> 01:34:14,066
# You can't stop a river
as it rushes to the sea #

2094
01:34:14,162 --> 01:34:16,847
# You can try to stop
the hands of time #

2095
01:34:16,847 --> 01:34:19,436
# But 'cha know it just can't be #

2096
01:34:19,436 --> 01:34:22,121
# And if they try to stop us, Seaweed #

2097
01:34:22,217 --> 01:34:24,902
# We'll call the N-double-A-C-P #

2098
01:34:24,902 --> 01:34:27,683
# 'Cause the world keeps
spinnin' round and round #

2099
01:34:27,683 --> 01:34:30,368
# And my heart's keepin' time
to the speed of sound #

2100
01:34:30,368 --> 01:34:32,478
# I was lost till I heard the drums #

2101
01:34:32,478 --> 01:34:34,779
# Then I found my way #

2102
01:34:34,779 --> 01:34:36,218
# 'Cause you can't stop the beat #

2103
01:34:36,314 --> 01:34:38,423
# Ever since we first saw the light #

2104
01:34:38,519 --> 01:34:40,053
# A man and woman liked to shake it #

2105
01:34:40,053 --> 01:34:41,396
# On a Saturday night #

2106
01:34:41,396 --> 01:34:42,930
# And so I'm gonna
shake and shimmy it #

2107
01:34:43,026 --> 01:34:44,081
- # With all of my might #
- Mother!

2108
01:34:44,177 --> 01:34:45,711
# Today #

2109
01:34:45,711 --> 01:34:48,108
# 'Cause you can't stop
the motion of the ocean #

2110
01:34:48,108 --> 01:34:49,355
# Or the rain from above #

2111
01:34:49,451 --> 01:34:50,697
# They can try to stop the paradise #

2112
01:34:50,793 --> 01:34:51,944
Hello?! Hello?!

2113
01:34:51,944 --> 01:34:53,287
# We're dreamin' of
but you cannot stop #

2114
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:54,629
# The rhythm of two hearts in love #

2115
01:34:54,629 --> 01:34:56,259
# To stay #

2116
01:34:56,355 --> 01:34:57,602
# 'Cause you can't stop the beat #

2117
01:34:57,698 --> 01:34:59,520
Aah! Aah!

2118
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,054
Ahh!

2119
01:35:01,150 --> 01:35:02,109
Amen.

2120
01:35:02,205 --> 01:35:04,698
I am now a checkerboard chick.

2121
01:35:05,753 --> 01:35:06,903
Penny!

2122
01:35:06,903 --> 01:35:08,150
No!

2123
01:35:11,506 --> 01:35:12,561
Aah!

2124
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:14,479
Mommy.

2125
01:35:18,027 --> 01:35:19,178
Ow.

2126
01:35:23,685 --> 01:35:26,274
Live television: There's nothin' like it.

2127
01:35:26,274 --> 01:35:27,808
Penny!

2128
01:35:34,616 --> 01:35:37,014
And now, it's the moment
you've all been craving for.

2129
01:35:37,014 --> 01:35:38,740
We have to wait till
they go to commercial.

2130
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:40,753
As you know, we've kept the lines open up
to the last minute.

2131
01:35:40,753 --> 01:35:42,959
And those lines have been
burnin' up our switchboard.

2132
01:35:43,055 --> 01:35:44,301
Never in the history of this pageant...

2133
01:35:44,301 --> 01:35:46,795
has there been such a surge of late voting.

2134
01:35:48,329 --> 01:35:49,767
Baltimore, you've picked a winner.

2135
01:35:50,918 --> 01:35:54,658
And the new Miss Hairspray is...

2136
01:35:54,754 --> 01:35:56,288
- Inez Stubbs!
- What?!

2137
01:35:56,288 --> 01:35:58,973
Inez, you done it! You did it!

2138
01:35:58,973 --> 01:36:00,603
How about that?

2139
01:36:00,603 --> 01:36:01,850
Yes!

2140
01:36:01,946 --> 01:36:03,288
Come on over here, Little Inez.

2141
01:36:03,288 --> 01:36:05,014
Go, babe!

2142
01:36:05,014 --> 01:36:06,261
Oh! Inez!

2143
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:07,220
Oh, my God!

2144
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:09,521
Ohh!

2145
01:36:09,617 --> 01:36:10,864
That's my baby!

2146
01:36:10,864 --> 01:36:12,302
That's my baby girl!

2147
01:36:17,576 --> 01:36:19,494
But... She's...

2148
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:20,933
she's not even a candidate.

2149
01:36:21,028 --> 01:36:23,522
She just got a tidal wave
of calls, velma.

2150
01:36:23,522 --> 01:36:25,439
But this is invalid.
This is impossible.

2151
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:27,166
Well, anyone who dances
for it is eligible.

2152
01:36:27,261 --> 01:36:30,138
Rule 30, paragraph 5, asterisk,
down at the bottom. OK.

2153
01:36:30,234 --> 01:36:33,399
<i>Well, this also makes you the lead dancer
on The Corny Collins Show.</i>

2154
01:36:35,316 --> 01:36:36,947
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
The Corny Collins Show...</i>

2155
01:36:36,947 --> 01:36:39,344
is now and forever officially integrated!

2156
01:36:43,276 --> 01:36:44,906
Oh, oh! Oh!

2157
01:36:48,454 --> 01:36:50,180
All right. Yeah.

2158
01:36:52,769 --> 01:36:57,947
<i>Interracial dancing has broken out
at the WYZT stage.</i>

2159
01:36:57,947 --> 01:37:00,440
Just look at the crowd's reaction.

2160
01:37:00,536 --> 01:37:02,166
Back to you, Steve.

2161
01:37:02,166 --> 01:37:03,413
# I was lost till I heard the drums #

2162
01:37:03,413 --> 01:37:05,619
# Then I found my way #

2163
01:37:05,619 --> 01:37:08,112
# 'Cause you can't stop the beat #

2164
01:37:09,071 --> 01:37:11,084
Amber, stop it!

2165
01:37:13,674 --> 01:37:15,783
I lost, Mom.
Let's just deal with it.

2166
01:37:15,783 --> 01:37:16,934
No, you did not lose.

2167
01:37:16,934 --> 01:37:18,852
You cannot have lost...

2168
01:37:18,852 --> 01:37:20,961
because I switched the damn tallies.

2169
01:37:20,961 --> 01:37:22,304
Smile, Miss Crabmeat.

2170
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,509
<i>You're on Candid Camera.</i>

2171
01:37:26,235 --> 01:37:28,153
That was a good shot, don't you think?

2172
01:37:28,153 --> 01:37:29,112
Not bad.

2173
01:37:30,838 --> 01:37:33,427
Ha ha ha! What are you doing?

2174
01:37:33,523 --> 01:37:35,633
Get that away from me!

2175
01:37:35,729 --> 01:37:37,263
Go to commercial!

2176
01:37:37,263 --> 01:37:38,989
Go!

2177
01:37:38,989 --> 01:37:40,044
velma!

2178
01:37:47,524 --> 01:37:49,058
Pack your desk.

2179
01:37:49,154 --> 01:37:50,784
You've tainted the name of Ultra Clutch.

2180
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,318
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2181
01:37:52,318 --> 01:37:55,291
How can you taint a cancerous
can-a chemicals?

2182
01:37:55,387 --> 01:37:56,729
You're fired!

2183
01:37:56,729 --> 01:37:58,839
I ca-I can't be fired.

2184
01:37:58,839 --> 01:37:59,990
Oh, yeah?

2185
01:38:02,579 --> 01:38:04,593
Last chance
to join the dance, folks.

2186
01:38:04,593 --> 01:38:06,031
Everyone is welcome!

2187
01:38:06,127 --> 01:38:07,853
Wilbur.

2188
01:38:07,853 --> 01:38:11,209
Do it now, or forever wish you had.

2189
01:38:11,209 --> 01:38:12,264
Really?

2190
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:13,798
Show 'em, baby.

2191
01:38:16,963 --> 01:38:18,881
Nobody can dance like you.

2192
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:28,662
# You can't stop my happiness #

2193
01:38:28,662 --> 01:38:31,155
# 'Cause I like the way I am #

2194
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:33,936
# And ya just can't stop
my knife and fork #

2195
01:38:33,936 --> 01:38:36,813
# When I see a Christmas ham #

2196
01:38:36,813 --> 01:38:39,498
# So if you don't like the way I look #

2197
01:38:39,498 --> 01:38:42,278
# Well, I just don't give a damn #

2198
01:38:42,374 --> 01:38:44,772
# 'Cause the world keeps spinnin'
round and round #

# And my heart's keepin' time

# I was lost till I heard the drums #

2201
01:38:49,566 --> 01:38:52,059
# Then I found my way #

01:38:52,155 --> 01:38:53,498
# 'Cause you can't stop the beat #

2203
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:55,512
# Ever since this old world began #

2204
01:38:55,512 --> 01:38:57,046
# A woman found out if she shook it #

2205
01:38:57,142 --> 01:38:58,197
# She could shake up a man #

2206
01:38:58,292 --> 01:39:00,019
# And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it #

2207
01:39:00,019 --> 01:39:02,704
# The best that I can today #

2208
01:39:02,799 --> 01:39:04,046
# 'Cause you can't stop #

2209
01:39:04,142 --> 01:39:06,443
# The motion of the ocean
or the sun in the sky #

2210

# You can wonder if you wanna
but I'll never ask why #

2211
01:39:09,224 --> 01:39:10,663
# And if you try to hold me down #

2212
01:39:10,663 --> 01:39:11,909
# I'm gonna spit in your eye #

2213
01:39:12,005 --> 01:39:13,635
# And say #

2214
01:39:13,731 --> 01:39:15,745
# That you can't stop the beat #

2215
01:39:24,471 --> 01:39:25,718
Whoa!

2216
01:39:44,321 --> 01:39:45,568
Oh! I love you!

2217
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:49,307
You did great!

2218
01:39:51,225 --> 01:39:53,047
Corny, do something.

2219
01:39:53,143 --> 01:39:55,157
The show is turning to gumbo.

2220
01:39:55,157 --> 01:39:56,787
Not a chance, velma.

2221
01:39:57,938 --> 01:39:59,376
This is the future.

2222
01:40:01,198 --> 01:40:03,308
Maybelle, let's go.

2223
01:40:03,404 --> 01:40:05,034
This is your time.

2224
01:40:10,212 --> 01:40:11,555
Yeah.

2225
01:40:11,555 --> 01:40:12,801
All right, Miss buttercup.

2226
01:40:12,801 --> 01:40:14,815
It's time to wrap this mutha up.

2227
01:40:14,815 --> 01:40:16,062
# Oh, oh, oh #

2228
01:40:16,062 --> 01:40:17,596
- # You can't stop today #
- No!

2229
01:40:17,596 --> 01:40:20,664
# As it comes speedin' down the tracks #

2230
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,719
# Ooh, child, yes #

2231
01:40:21,719 --> 01:40:23,253
# Child, yesterday is history #

2232
01:40:23,349 --> 01:40:24,308
Be gone!

2233
01:40:24,308 --> 01:40:25,938
# And it's never comin' back #

2234
01:40:25,938 --> 01:40:26,993
# Look ahead! #

2235
01:40:26,993 --> 01:40:29,103
# 'Cause tomorrow is a brand-new day #

2236
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:31,308
# And it don't know white from black #

2237
01:40:31,308 --> 01:40:32,747
Yeah!

2238
01:40:32,843 --> 01:40:34,665
# 'Cause the world keeps
spinnin' round and round #

2239
01:40:34,761 --> 01:40:37,350
# And my heart's keepin'
time to the speed of sound #

2240
01:40:37,446 --> 01:40:39,459
# I was lost till I heard the drums #

2241
01:40:39,459 --> 01:40:41,665
# Then I found my way #

2242
01:40:41,665 --> 01:40:43,391
# 'Cause you can't stop the beat #

2243
01:40:43,391 --> 01:40:45,309
# Ever since we first saw the light #

2244
01:40:45,309 --> 01:40:46,939
# A man and woman
liked to shake it #

2245
01:40:46,939 --> 01:40:48,281
# On a Saturday night #

2246
01:40:48,281 --> 01:40:49,816
# And so I'm gonna
shake and shimmy it #

2247
01:40:49,912 --> 01:40:50,871
# With all of my might #

2248
01:40:50,966 --> 01:40:52,693
# Today #

2249
01:40:52,788 --> 01:40:55,090
# 'Cause you can't stop
the motion of the ocean #

2250
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:56,432
# Or the rain from above #

2251
01:40:56,432 --> 01:40:58,063
# They can try to stop the paradise #

2252
01:40:58,158 --> 01:40:59,117
# We're dreamin' of #

2253
01:40:59,117 --> 01:41:00,172
# But you cannot stop #

2254
01:41:00,172 --> 01:41:01,898
# The rhythm of two hearts in love #

2255
01:41:01,898 --> 01:41:03,337
# To stay #

2256
01:41:03,337 --> 01:41:05,734
# 'Cause you can't stop the beat #

2257
01:41:05,734 --> 01:41:12,830
# Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa #

2258
01:41:12,926 --> 01:41:15,515
# Ever since we first saw the sun #

2259
01:41:15,515 --> 01:41:18,200
# A man and woman liked to shake it
when the day is done #

2260
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:19,734
# And so we're gonna shake
and shimmy it #

2261
01:41:19,734 --> 01:41:22,419
# And have some fun today #

2262
01:41:22,419 --> 01:41:23,858
# 'Cause you can't stop #

2263
01:41:23,858 --> 01:41:26,159
# The motion of the ocean
or the rain from above #

2264

# They can try to stop the
paradise we're dreamin' of #

2265
01:41:28,748 --> 01:41:30,187
# But you'll never stop the rhythm #

2266
01:41:30,282 --> 01:41:32,872
# Of two hearts in love to stay #

2267
01:41:32,967 --> 01:41:34,789
# 'Cause you can't stop the beat #

2268
01:41:34,789 --> 01:41:45,625
# You can't stop the beat #

2269
01:42:03,174 --> 01:42:05,571
# Ooh, ooh #

2270
01:42:08,927 --> 01:42:11,037
# Hey, old friend, let's look back #

2271
01:42:11,133 --> 01:42:14,393
# On the crazy clothes we wore #

2272
01:42:14,393 --> 01:42:16,886
# Ain't it fun to look back #

2273
01:42:16,982 --> 01:42:20,243
# To see it's all been done before #

2274
01:42:20,338 --> 01:42:22,640
# All those nights together #

2275
01:42:22,736 --> 01:42:25,229
# Are a special memory #

2276
01:42:25,229 --> 01:42:28,010
# And I can't wait for tomorrow #

2277
01:42:28,010 --> 01:42:30,983
# Just as long as you're
dancin' next to me #

2278
01:42:30,983 --> 01:42:33,668
# 'Cause it's so clear, every year #

2279
01:42:33,763 --> 01:42:35,202
# We get stronger #

2280
01:42:35,298 --> 01:42:36,640
# Stronger #

2281
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:39,421
# 'Cause what's gone is gone,
the past is the past #

2282
01:42:39,517 --> 01:42:40,764
# Turn the radio up #

2283
01:42:40,764 --> 01:42:42,010
# And then hit the gas #

2284
01:42:42,106 --> 01:42:44,887
# 'Cause I know we've come so far #

2285
01:42:44,887 --> 01:42:48,147
# But we've got so far to go #

2286
01:42:48,147 --> 01:42:50,545
# I know the road seems long #

2287
01:42:50,545 --> 01:42:53,134
# But it won't be long
till it's time to go #

2288
01:42:53,134 --> 01:42:55,915
# So, most days, we'll take it fast #

2289
01:42:55,915 --> 01:42:59,463
# And some nights, we'll take it slow #

2290

2291

# But, baby, baby,
we've got so far to go #

2292
01:43:07,038 --> 01:43:09,052
# Oh, yeah #

2293
01:43:09,052 --> 01:43:10,394
# Baby #

2294
01:43:10,394 --> 01:43:12,216
# Hey, old friend, together #

2295
01:43:12,312 --> 01:43:15,764
# Side by side and year by year #

2296
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:18,162
# The road was filled
with twists and turns #

2297
01:43:18,258 --> 01:43:21,230
# Oh, but that's the road
that got us here #

2298
01:43:21,230 --> 01:43:23,915
# Let's move past the bad times #

2299
01:43:23,915 --> 01:43:27,176
# But before those memories fade #

2300
01:43:27,176 --> 01:43:29,477
# Let's forgive but not forget #

2301
01:43:29,477 --> 01:43:32,258
# And learn from all
the mistakes we made #

2302
01:43:32,258 --> 01:43:34,847
# 'Cause it's so clear, every year #

2303
01:43:34,847 --> 01:43:36,669
# We get stronger #

2304
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:37,820
# Stronger #

2305
01:43:37,916 --> 01:43:40,601
# So don't give up and don't say when #

2306
01:43:40,601 --> 01:43:43,094
# And just get back
on the road again #

2307
01:43:43,094 --> 01:43:45,875
# 'Cause I know we've come so far #

2308
01:43:45,971 --> 01:43:49,519
# But we've got so far to go #

2309
01:43:49,615 --> 01:43:51,532
# I know the road seems long #

2310
01:43:51,532 --> 01:43:54,217
# But it won't be long
till it's time to go #

2311
01:43:54,313 --> 01:43:57,190
# So, most days, we'll take it fast #

2312
01:43:57,286 --> 01:44:00,642

2313

2314
01:44:02,656 --> 01:44:07,642

we've got so far to go #

2315
01:44:07,738 --> 01:44:08,697

2316
01:44:08,793 --> 01:44:10,040

2317
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:11,478

2318
01:44:11,478 --> 01:44:14,067
# Hey, old friend, come
along for the ride #

2319
01:44:14,163 --> 01:44:16,656
# There's plenty of room so jump inside #

2320
01:44:16,752 --> 01:44:19,437
# The highway's bumpy
every now and then #

2321
01:44:19,533 --> 01:44:22,314
# But it's so much better
than where I've been #

2322
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:25,191
# Just keep moving at your own speed #

2323
01:44:25,191 --> 01:44:27,588
# Your heart is all the compass
you'll ever need #

2324

# Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on #

2325
01:44:30,753 --> 01:44:32,958
# 'Cause the rearview mirror
only shows what's #

2326

01:47:10,030 --> 01:47:13,291
# Could barely walk and talk
so much as dance and sing #

2384
01:47:13,291 --> 01:47:16,551
# But let me hit that stage,
I wanna take my bow #

2385
01:47:16,551 --> 01:47:18,757
# 'Cause, Mama, I'm a big girl now #

2386
01:47:18,853 --> 01:47:20,195
# Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh #

2387
01:47:20,291 --> 01:47:23,168
# Once upon a time
I used to dress up Ken #

2388
01:47:23,168 --> 01:47:26,332
# But now that I'm a woman,
I like bigger men #

2389
01:47:26,332 --> 01:47:29,688
# And I don't need a Barbie doll
to show me how #

2390
01:47:29,688 --> 01:47:31,798
# 'Cause, Mama, I'm a big girl now #

2391
01:47:31,894 --> 01:47:33,332
# Ooh, ooh, ah #

2392
01:47:33,332 --> 01:47:36,017
# Ma, you always taught me
what was right from wrong #

2393
01:47:36,017 --> 01:47:39,565
# And now I just wanna give it a try #

2394
01:47:39,661 --> 01:47:42,538
# Mama, I've been in the nest
for far too long #

2395
01:47:42,538 --> 01:47:46,470
# So please give a push
and, Mama, watch me fly #

2396
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:48,771
# Watch me fly #

2397
01:47:48,771 --> 01:47:49,826
Show off.

2398
01:47:49,922 --> 01:47:52,894
# Someday I will meet
a man you won't condemn #

2399
01:47:52,894 --> 01:47:55,867
# And we will have some kids
and you can torture them #

2400
01:47:55,867 --> 01:47:58,936
# But let me be a star
before I take that vow #

2401
01:47:59,032 --> 01:48:01,141
# 'Cause, Mama, I'm a big girl now #

2402
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:02,580

2404

# Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! #

2405

# Mama, I'm a big girl #

2406
01:48:09,004 --> 01:48:11,114
Ooh, such a big, big girl!

2407
01:48:11,210 --> 01:48:14,374
# I'm a big girl now #

# Whoa-oh-oh, whoaaaa! #

2409
01:48:21,375 --> 01:48:24,251
# Please, Mama, I'm a big girl now #

2410
01:48:26,457 --> 01:48:29,526
# They came from way
far out in outer space #

2411
01:48:29,526 --> 01:48:32,978
# She's hard to miss
and so they landed on her face #

2412
01:48:33,074 --> 01:48:34,991
# She's got cooties! #

2413

2417

# Long tailed, sharp nailed #

2418

a walking show-and-tell #
