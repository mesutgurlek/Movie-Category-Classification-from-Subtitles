00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:23,990
- Hmm, no.
- [Pooka Barking]

321
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:28,227
- [Gasps] Yes! Yes!
- [Dimitri] A dog.

322
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:30,671
- Are you Dimitri?
- Cute.

323
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:34,097
Perhaps. That all depends
on who's looking for him. [Chuckles]

324
00:21:34,187 --> 00:21:37,271
My name is Anya. I need travel papers.

325
00:21:37,355 --> 00:21:41,223
They say you're the man to see,
even though I can't tell you who said that.

326
00:21:41,318 --> 00:21:43,525
- Hmm. Hmm. - Hey, and wha...
Hey, why are you circling me?

327
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:46,844
- What, were you a vulture in another life?
- I'm sorry, "Enya."

328
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:48,508
- It's-It's  Anya.
- Anya.

329
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,507
- Anya. It's just that-
- Anya.

330
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,072
It's just that you look
an awful lot like- [Chucles]

331
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:58,375
Uh, never mind. Um, now, you...
said something about travel papers.

332
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,995
- Uh, yes. I'd like to go to Paris.
- [Vlad Laughing]

333
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:04,303
- You'd like to go to Paris?
- Mm-hmm.

334
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,293
- Who is this here? Oh! Oh, look!
- [Whimpering]

335
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,043
- Oh, he likes me!
- Nice dog. Uh-

336
00:22:09,055 --> 00:22:12,804
Now, let me ask you something...
Anya, was it?

337
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:17,139
- There's a last name that goes with that?
- Well, actually...

338
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,847
This is gonna sound crazy.
I don't know my last name.

339
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:24,642
I was found wandering around
when I was eight years old.

340
00:22:24,737 --> 00:22:27,110
And before that? Before you were eight?

341
00:22:27,198 --> 00:22:31,611
I know it's strange, but I don't remember.
I have very few memories of my past.

342
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:34,408
Hm. That's perfect.

343
00:22:34,497 --> 00:22:37,118
I do have one clue, however.
And that is Paris.

344
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,702
Paris?

345
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:41,366
Right. So, can- So,
can you two help me or not?

346
00:22:42,254 --> 00:22:43,963
Hmm. Vlad, Vlad, tickets.
Huh?

347
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:49,126
Sure would like to. In fact, oddly enough,
we're going to Paris ourselves.

348
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:51,365
[Gasps] Uh, and I've got three-

349
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:54,474
Well, this one is-
But I've got three tickets here.

350
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,132
- Unfortunately, the third one is for her,
- Oh! Oh!

351
00:22:57,228 --> 00:22:59,720
Anastasia.

352
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,340
- Oh.
- We are going to reunite

353
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,860
the Grand Duchess Anastasia
with her grandmother.

354
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:08,194
- You do kind of resemble her.
- The same blue eyes.

355
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:10,818
- The Romanov eyes.
- Nicholas' smile.

356
00:23:10,908 --> 00:23:13,066
- Alexandra's chin.
- Oh, look.

357
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,031
She even has the grandmother's hands.

358
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:18,494
She's the same age, the same physical type.

359
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,702
Are you trying to tell me
you think that I am Anastasia?

360
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:24,795
I've seen thousands of girls
all over the country.

361
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,250
Not one of them looks as much like
the Grand Duchess as you.

362
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:30,916
- Look at the portrait.
- I knew you were crazy.

363
00:23:31,012 --> 00:23:33,633
- But now I think you are both mad.
- Why?

364
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:37,258
- You don't remember what happened to you.
- No one knows what happened to her.

365
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:39,475
You're looking for family, in Paris.

366
00:23:39,562 --> 00:23:42,018
And her only family is in Paris.

367
00:23:42,106 --> 00:23:44,347
Have you ever thought about the possibility?

368
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:46,518
That I could be royalty?

369
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,857
- [Dimitri, Vlad] Mm-hmm.
- [Whimpers]

370
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:52,441
Well, it's kind of hard
to think of yourself as a duchess

371
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:54,941
- when you're sleeping on a damp floor.
- [Growling, Barks]

372
00:23:55,035 --> 00:23:58,535
But, sure, every lonely girl
would hope she's a princess.

373
00:23:58,622 --> 00:24:02,573
- And, somewhere, one little girl is.
- Hmm.

374
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:09,170
After all, the name "Anastasia"
means "she will rise again". [Scoffs]

375
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:13,672
Wish we could help, but the third ticket
is for the Grand Duchess Anastasia.

376
00:24:14,137 --> 00:24:16,214
[Sighs] Good luck.

377
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:21,722
Why didn't you tell her
about our brilliant plan?

378
00:24:21,813 --> 00:24:26,558
All she wants to do is go to Paris.
Why give away a third of the reward money?

379
00:24:26,651 --> 00:24:28,893
I tell you, we're walking away too soon.

380
00:24:28,987 --> 00:24:31,774
Not to worry. I got it all under control.

381
00:24:32,323 --> 00:24:34,695
All right, walk a little slower.

382
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,012
Hmm.

383
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,402
- Hmm.
- [Whimpers]

384
00:24:46,295 --> 00:24:49,795
Three, two, one...

385
00:24:49,882 --> 00:24:51,706
- [Anya] Dimitri!
- Ah!

386
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,046
Right in the palm of our hand.

387
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:57,007
- Dimitri, wait!
- D-Did you call me?

388
00:24:57,097 --> 00:24:59,716
If I don't remember who I am,
then who's to say I'm not

389
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,056
a princess or a duchess,
or whatever she is, right?

390
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:05,350
- Mm-hmm. Go on.
- Yeah, and if I'm not Anastasia,

391
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,104
the Empress will know right away.

392
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,026
- So it's just an honest mistake.
- [Dimitri] Sounds plausible.

393
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:13,446
But, if you are the princess,

394
00:25:13,531 --> 00:25:17,825
then you'll finally know who you are
and have your family back.

395
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,986
You know- You know, he's right.

396
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,785
- Either way, it gets you to Paris.
- Right!

397
00:25:23,261 --> 00:25:24,451
Ow!

398
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,356
[Groans]

399
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:29,500
[Dimitri] May I present
Her Royal Highness,

400
00:25:29,586 --> 00:25:31,960
the Grand Duchess Anastasia.

401
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:35,290
- [Anastasia] Pooka, we are going to Paris.
- [Pooka Barks]

402
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,080
- [Dimitri] No, the dog stays. - What are
you talking about? The dog goes.

403
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,398
- No, the dog does not go.
- [Anastasia] I say he's going.

404
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,888
I'm allergic to dogs.

405
00:25:42,643 --> 00:25:44,295
Anastasia?

406
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:48,065
You have just one problem there,
fellah. Anastasia's dead.

407
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:51,150
All the Romanovs are dead. They're dead.

408
00:25:51,235 --> 00:25:53,312
Dead, dead, dead.

409
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:56,691
Am I right, my friend?
I mean, how could that be Ana- [Hisses]

410
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,436
[Screams, Whimpers]

411
00:26:02,163 --> 00:26:03,375
Oh, come on.

412
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,406
Am I supposed to believe
that thing woke up after all these years

413
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:10,668
just because some guy
claims she's a Romanov? [Hissing]

414
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:14,219
Okay, Okay, I get the message.

415
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,803
Enough already with the glowing
and the smoke people.

416
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,464
[Signs]

417
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:27,344
If that thing's come back to life,
it must mean Anastasia's alive.

418
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:29,728
- [Dimitri] Just leave the dog.
- I am not leaving the dog.

419
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:32,306
- And that's her.
- [Vlad] We've got a train to catch.

420
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:34,074
Wow! Oh!
[Groans]

421
00:26:35,488 --> 00:26:37,445
Mayday! Mayday!
Hey!

422
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,028
[Screaming]
Ooh! Yech!

423
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,454
[Groans] Ooh!
[Screams]

424
00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:52,873
Ooh! Ooh!Ooh!
Hot It's hot!

425
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:54,314
[Groans]

426
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,004
Whoa, oh!

[Thud]
[Groans]

428
00:27:00,514 --> 00:27:02,506
Oh, boy.

429
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:05,802
Ow! I tell you what... Ow!

430
00:27:06,644 --> 00:27:09,182
Who dares intrude on my solitude?

431
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,548
Get out!

432
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,058
Get out!
[Groans]

433
00:27:15,236 --> 00:27:18,071
Bartok? Is that you?

434
00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:20,861
[Groans]

435
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:24,989
Master? You're alive?

436
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:27,748
Yes. In a manner of speaking.

437
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:31,210
Whoa, that fell right out there, sir.

438
00:27:31,962 --> 00:27:34,631
- Something's happened?
- Yeah.

439
00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:37,832
- Whoopsie.
- I knew it.

440
00:27:37,926 --> 00:27:41,544
I could feel the dark forces stirring.

441
00:27:41,637 --> 00:27:44,841
I'm not surprised, because I saw her.
Anastasia.

442
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:47,340
Anastasia? Alive?

443
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:50,053
Uh, sir, your lips-
They're uh-

444
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:52,816
That Romanov brat!

445
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:54,403
Yeah, ain't that the kick in the head?

446
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,944
I guess a curse
just ain't what it used to be, huh, sir?

447
00:27:57,027 --> 00:28:00,361
That's why I was stuck here in limbo.

448
00:28:00,448 --> 00:28:02,939
My curse is unfulfilled.
[Groans]

Look at me.

452
00:28:12,877 --> 00:28:14,953
I am falling apart. [Sobs]

453
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:19,498
I'm a wreck!

454
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:21,847
Actually, considering how long
you've been dead,

455
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,587
- You look pretty good.
- Bah. [Sobbing]

456
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:28,303
- Sir, you do. You do.
- Really?

457
00:28:28,393 --> 00:28:31,560
Sir, is this the face of a bat
who would lie to you?

458
00:28:32,229 --> 00:28:35,729
Come on! For a minute there,
you had your old spark back.

459
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:40,644
If only I hadn't lost the gift
from the dark forces-

460
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:43,950
The key to my powers.

461
00:28:44,034 --> 00:28:46,739
What? You mean this reliquary?

462
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:50,493
- [Gasps] Where did you get that?
- Oh, I found it.

463
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:53,748
- Give it to me!
- All right, all right. Don't get so grabby.

464
00:28:53,835 --> 00:28:56,326
My old friend.

465
00:28:56,421 --> 00:28:58,165
Together again.

Now my dark purpose will be fulfilled.
