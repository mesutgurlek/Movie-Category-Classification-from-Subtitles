Let me be your only love

1114
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:43,934
Let me take you far beyond the stars

1115
01:23:45,645 --> 01:23:50,190
Let me be your wings

1116
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:54,653
Let me lift you high above

1117
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:58,073
Everything we're dreaming of
Everything we're dreaming of

1118
01:23:58,241 --> 01:24:02,536
Will soon be ours
Will soon be ours

1119
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:07,458
Anything that you desire

1120
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:11,754
Anything at all

1121
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:15,924
Every day I'll take you higher

1122
01:24:16,092 --> 01:24:20,429
And I'll never let you fall

1123
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:24,808
Let me be your wings

1124
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:29,646
Leave behind the world you know

1125
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:33,984
For another world of wondrous things

1126
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:37,988
Wondrous things are sure to happen

1127
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:41,784
We'll see the universe

1128
01:24:41,951 --> 01:24:46,622
And dance on Saturn's rings

1129
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:50,667
Fly with me and I will be
Fly with me and I will be

1130
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:55,589
Your wings
Oh, your wings

1131
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:15,067
Oh, anything that you desire

1132
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:19,446
Anything at all

1133
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:23,700
Every day I'll take you higher

1134
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:29,039
And I'll never let you fall

1135
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:33,544
Let me be your wings
Let me be your wings

1136
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:40,384
Let me be your only love
Get ready for another world

1137
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:46,056
Of wondrous things
Wondrous things

1138
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:49,935
We'll see the universe

1139
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:54,731
And dance on Saturn's rings

1140
01:25:54,899 --> 01:25:59,111
Heaven isn't too far

1141
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:03,407
Heaven is where you are

1142
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:08,412
Stay with me and let me
Let me

1143
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:14,793
Be your wings
Be your wings
