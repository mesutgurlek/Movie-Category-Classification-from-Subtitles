1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:04,764
<i>- Here's what happened last week.
Quinn told Finn...
- I'm pregnant.</i>

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,898
<i>- But she didn't tell him
that he's not the father... Puck is.
- What's up, MILF?</i>

3
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,771
<i>- Can you believe that?
- Wow.
- That's not the only baby drama.</i>

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,710
<i>Terri says she's pregnant, but really she's faking
and Mr. Schuester doesn't know.</i>

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,474
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,913
<i>Rachel quit the Glee Club because Sue
got Sandy to come back to direct a musical.</i>

7
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:19,816
<i>And that's what you missed on Glee.</i>

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,894
<i>¶¶ A singer in a smoky room ¶¶</i>

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,265
¶¶ A smell of wine
and cheap perfume ¶¶

10
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:40,431
¶¶ For a smile they can share the night ¶¶

11
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,772
¶¶ It goes on and on and on and on ¶¶¶¶

12
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,442
Quinn, you okay?

13
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,246
I think she just had
a bad breakfast burrito.

14
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:56,084
<i>- Can we please talk about
the giant elephant in the room?
- Your sexuality?</i>

15
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,182
- Rachel. We can't do it without her.
- That's not true.

16
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,195
We may have to layer Santana or Mercedes
over Quinn's solo...

17
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,493
but... we'll be fine.

18
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,624
Maybe for the invitationals,
but not for the sectionals.

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,100
<i>- Certainly not the regionals.
- The wheelchair kid's right.</i>

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,798
<i>Rachel makes me wanna light myself on fire,
but she can sing.</i>

21
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:15,932
Rachel left, guys. She's gone.

22
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,672
Now, if we're gonna make this thing work,
we can't look back.

23
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,106
Take five, guys.

24
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,479
<i>Um, Mr. Schue?</i>

25
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,523
I don't wanna tell you
how to do your job...

26
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,788
but with all the dancing around that Quinn's
doing, I'm kinda worried about the baby.

27
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,422
Yeah. Yeah, I get it. Um...

28
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,634
How about I give Tina
a few of her verses? Okay?

29
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:46,729
- Okay.
- You think you might wanna tell
your mom what's going on?

30
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,741
I think I'd rather
handle it myself right now.

31
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,107
My mom's got enough to worry about.

32
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,755
How come you haven't had
any morning sickness?

33
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:07,349
Quinn Fabray's been upchucking
every 15 minutes.

34
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,260
Really?
That's a really good sign.

35
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,265
That means the baby's not a mongoloid.

36
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,268
- Well, is it bad that you haven't been sick then?
- Oh, no, honey...

37
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,430
No, no, you should ask Howard Bamboo
about my Linda Blair impersonations...

38
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,201
every half hour at work.

39
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,606
Mmm.

40
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:27,077
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about this whole Rachel thing.

41
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,911
- Would you like anything else?
- Another piece of grasshopper pie.

42
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,850
- What, are you going for the record?
- I'm with child.

43
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,513
Did you go to McKinley High?
I think I had you in my Spanish class.

44
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,557
Yeah, like, five years ago.
I go to Carmel now.

45
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,092
How is that possible?

46
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,560
- You must be 22.
- Twenty-four.

47
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,258
I'm a six-year senior. They keep failing me
so I can stay in Vocal Adrenaline.

48
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,425
- They fail you on purpose?
- Yeah.

49
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,231
- Is that legal?
- I'm the only one who can do the triple flip.

50
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,397
Yeah. Hey, how about
that other piece of pie?

51
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,963
How about it?

52
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,770
<i>Honey, are you all right?</i>

53
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,146
Yeah.

54
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,208
Fine.

55
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,726
So, have I done something wrong?

56
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,729
Oh, no. No, no. Absolutely not.

57
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:21,233
No, um, actually, I've just, um...

58
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,235
taken a special interest in you.

59
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:26,966
Look, I know sometimes that life
can come at you pretty fast...

60
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,669
and you reach a point where
you might just need a little, um...

61
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,574
special guidance.

62
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,808
Has someone told you something
about my personal life?

63
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,644
- Nope. Mm-mmm.
- Can you keep a secret?

64
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,589
But, you know, there are very few students
that ever get athletic scholarships.

65
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:50,254
Okay? But there are a lot of schools that
give full rides to students who excel in music.

66
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,854
Students like yourself.

67
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:55,196
Maybe if you were able to go to college...

68
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,726
you wouldn't, say, end up stuck in this town
in a dead-end job...

69
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,297
living hand-to-mouth with a wife and a kid
you never intended to have.

70
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,969
That's just something
off the top of my head.

71
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,241
You think if I stuck with Glee
that I could get a scholarship?

72
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,838
It's definitely a possibility.

73
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,852
If you did well at regionals,
maybe you could generate some interest.

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,447
- But we lost Rachel.
You think we can do it without her?
- Sure!

75
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,515
Do you think we can win regionals
without Rachel?

76
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,959
Remember the Jamaican bobsled team?

77
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,122
Big long-shots.

78
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,634
Definitely.

79
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,396
But if you're concerned about your future...

80
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,736
and those who may be
a part of your future soon...

81
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:39,039
maybe you could just give Rachel a talk,
see if you can get her to come back.

82
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:46,517
How does it feel to be just a sophomore
and get the lead in the school musical?

83
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,554
It's an honor.

84
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,555
Frankly, one I feel I've earned.

85
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,753
If there's anything I've learned in my 16 years
on the stage it's that stars are rare...

86
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,762
and when they're found
you have to let them shine.

87
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,525
Show me your bra.

88
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,193
- You mean, the one I'm wearing?
- Quid pro quo, Rachel.

89
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,203
If you want a good review, show me
your over-the-shoulder boulder holder.

90
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,205
No way! You can't do that!

91
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,867
My performance will stand on its own.
Besides, no one reads the school paper anyway.

92
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,706
Oh, but I'll post
my scathing review online.

93
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,576
You'll be finished
on the high school stage.

94
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,777
Now get those sweater puppies
out of their cashmere cage.

95
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,945
Sorry I'm late. My Vespa had a flat.

96
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,717
Give me a minute
and I will be ready for my interview.

97
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,591
We're actually not gonna need any quotes
from you for the article, Mr. Ryerson.

98
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,222
Do the right thing.
All the great actresses take their clothes off.

99
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,062
<i>Well, I have no problem with nudity.</i>

100
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:38,729
<i>Let me tell you about
my planned production of Equus.</i>

101
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,898
Have you ever hung out at a stable?

102
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,736
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

103
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,412
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Uh, nothing!

104
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,813
<i>Just... getting the star treatment
I didn't get in Glee.</i>

105
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:55,547
- Totally.
- It's times like these
I know I've chosen the right path.

106
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,079
I'm never going back to Glee.
It's clear my talent is too big for an ensemble.

107
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,594
- Not gonna get an argument from me.
- I'm not?

108
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,256
No. You're, like,
the most talented person I know.

109
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:09,233
Even more than that guy at the mall
who can juggle chain saws.

110
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,829
I just wanted to let you know that
if you need someone to run lines with...

111
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,839
I'm available.

112
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,569
There is a lot of dialogue.

113
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:25,811
I figured we could go somewhere quiet,
maybe with low lighting and...

114
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,182
Let me know.

115
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,162
I could get fired for this.

116
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,692
She was a student 15 years ago.
No one is gonna care.

117
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,708
See? I-I knew it!

118
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,475
She never graduated.
She quit with, like, three credits to go.

119
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:59,644
I, um, saw her picture
in the folder. Pretty.

120
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,448
- Pretty?
- Mmm.

121
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,716
April Rhodes was a goddess.

122
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,282
The most talented performer
in McKinley Glee Club history.

123
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,523
When she sang, it was mesmerizing.

124
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,792
She was my first crush.
I was a freshman, she was a senior.

125
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:19,634
Wait, hold on... 'Cause I thought you said
your wife was your first crush.

126
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,730
That's because April
didn't even look at me.

127
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,673
Oh, crap. There's no forwarding address.

128
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,201
So then you've had feelings
for someone other than your wife.

129
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,044
<i>I'd love to play This Is Your Life,
but Lord Google demands my attention.</i>

130
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,483
Okay, just wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

131
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,078
Reaching back into your past
is a dangerous business. Okay?

132
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:39,181
People can change.
They can, um, disappoint you.

133
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,989
- I think I can handle it.
- I thought I could too. Just hear me out.

134
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,190
A few years ago I started
an online flirtation...

135
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,199
with a high school flame, Andy.

136
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,963
Things got weird, and I called it off.

137
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,028
And two months later...

138
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,401
Versace was dead.

139
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,836
Dead.

140
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,177
Okay. April Rhodes, Lima, Ohio.

141
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,217
Oh! She has a MySpace page.

142
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,717
Oh, God.

143
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:10,187
Oh, and here's a link to
her own personal Web site.

144
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,918
She's online.

145
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,222
<i>Hi, April.</i>

146
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:19,788
Not sure if you remember me,
but my name is Will Schuester.

147
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:24,496
"35 Bontempo Road, between 2:00 and 3:00.

148
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,731
Bring buffalo wings."

149
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:34,506
<i>¶¶ Seemed like the real thing only to find ¶¶</i>

150
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,207
<i>¶¶ Much mistrust ¶¶</i>

151
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,876
<i>¶¶ Love gone behind ¶¶</i>

152
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,885
April.

153
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,046
Hello. Are you Will?

154
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,646
Y-You remember me?

155
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,818
Mmm. No. But I don't remember breakfast.

156
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,055
Come on in.

157
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,098
<i>¶¶ Seemed like the real thing
but I was so blind ¶¶¶¶</i>

158
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,599
<i>Mmm. So...</i>

159
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,636
did I sleep with you?

160
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,332
l-l-l-I was a freshman
when you were a senior.

161
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,807
So, did I sleep with you?

162
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,639
No.

163
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,941
Can I get you a drink?

164
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,006
<i>I just cracked open a fresh box of wine.</i>

165
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,046
This is a great place you have.

166
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,090
Looks like you're doing well for yourself.

167
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:22,025
<i>I get five or six appointments on a good day,
from my World Wide Web page...</i>

168
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,824
so I do okay for myself.

169
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,991
Why don't you have a seat,
take off that jacket...

170
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,934
<i>and I'm gonna slip into something
a little more comfortable.</i>

171
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,964
Uh...

172
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:39,171
<i>So, this is a beautiful five-bedroom
with wood-burning fireplace and...</i>

173
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,679
You!

174
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,181
This is the third time this week!

175
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,514
- Who are you?
- I'm Sandra with Oakcrest Realty.

176
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:51,888
She is a squatter. This is a bank-owned property.
The owners foreclosed six months ago.

177
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,791
Let me just get my vino
and I'll be out of your hair.

178
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,328
- Hold that. Just...
- Oh. Okay.

179
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,993
Nice place.

180
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,733
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

181
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,000
What happened to you, April?

182
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,099
In high school you were
really going places.

183
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:13,373
You had a voice like a dream.
Everyone loved you.

184
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,405
Oh, I hitched my star to the wrong wagon.

185
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:22,113
Me and my high school sweetheart Vinnie
were convinced we were going to be stars...

186
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:26,522
so we dropped out of school
and hitchhiked our way to the Broadway.

187
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:31,393
We ended up in Cleveland slinging hash
at Ralph's Bait Shop and Waffle House.

188
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,058
Then Ralph had an affair with Vinnie.

189
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,727
I had a set of mixed-race twins.

190
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,135
And those were the good times.

191
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,142
April...

192
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,906
I think your struggle is really moving...

193
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,914
and I wanna help you
get back on your feet.

194
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,746
I happen to know that you're only
three credits shy of your diploma.

195
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,877
I can put you in my Spanish class.

196
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:58,014
And I know you're an amazing singer.

197
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,490
I want you to be in the Glee Club.

198
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,723
We'll get you sobered up,
find you some underwear.

199
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,396
It's not too late for you, April.

200
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,994
What do you say?

201
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:24,112
Guys, I'd like to introduce you
to someone very special.

202
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,651
This is April Rhodes.

203
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,778
She's our newest member.

204
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,789
Wait, so old people
can join Glee Club now?

205
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:36,123
Old, huh? You guys look like
the world's worst Benetton ad.

206
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,924
<i>Mr. Schuester,
this seems like a terrible idea.</i>

207
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,264
April is a great singer.

208
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,235
<i>And she never graduated.</i>

209
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,637
We appreciate what you're trying to do,
but she's no Rachel.

210
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,336
- Who's Rachel?
- Sh-Sh-She's kind of our star.

211
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,275
Your star, eh?

212
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,404
- Well, where is she?
- She left.

213
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,609
<i>To be the lead in Cabaret.</i>

214
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:02,347
Hey, Tinkles,
gimme "Maybe This Time" in B-flat.

215
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,889
<i>And don't let me catch you snoozin' .</i>

216
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,205

257
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,536
Stick that in your pipe and smoke it.

258
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:17,539
<i>So, if I were to say,
"I'm going to Mexico for the day"...</i>

259
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:20,380
<i>would I use "por" or "para"?</i>

260
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,852
<i>- April.
- Para.</i>

261
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,914
<i>- Por.
- Oh.</i>

262
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:29,324
<i>I guess I'd better
pour myself another cran-tini.</i>

263
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,522
I'm just kiddin' .

264
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,565
It's hot chocolate.

265
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:37,363
All right, remember, guys,
oral reports Wednesday.

266
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,870
April, can I talk to you for a second?

267
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:44,035
I'm sorry, Will. The old noodle
just ain't what she used to be.

268
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,634
I huffed a lot of
upholstery cleaner in the '90s.

269
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,646
Look, April...

270
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,978
I've been talking to the Glee kids...

271
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,043
and, um, I think they're still not so sure
about having you around.

272
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,380
You draw a lot of attention to yourself...

273
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,392
and they're
embarrassed enough as it is.

274
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,157
So do you think you could maybe take
some time and try to win them over?

275
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,768
Yeah.

276
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,770
Mmm. Smells like my aunt Mildred.

277
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,829
Just drink it.

278
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,705
Sweet, with a bit of an afterburny taste.

279
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,212
Oh, good Chablis should
always have a little bite.

280
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,717
<i>A few swigs of that every day before school
and you'll have all the courage you need...</i>

281
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,718
to be yourself.

282
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,720
- Really?
- Oh, yeah!

283
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,915
That's fantastic.

284
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,392
So is my primo collection
of vintage muscle magazines. Want 'em?

285
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,123
Mr. Schuester, I changed my mind.

286
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,791
April should stay. I worship her.

287
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,430
<i>¶¶ You make my dreams come true ¶¶</i>

288
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,632
Oh, no. You gotta be more natural.

289
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,402
I c-c-can't do this.

290
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,410
I don't understand why we're
doing this in the first place.

291
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:56,141
Your lack of imagination astounds me.
This is only the beginning.

292
00:16:56,215 --> 00:17:00,743
<i>If you can master this, you can sneak anything
out of a store between your knees.</i>

293
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,014
Shoes, prom dresses.

294
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:07,047
I once got a cake out of a kid's
birthday party with the candles still lit!

295
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,152
- Are you sure?
- She can stay.

296
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,754
T-T-Totally.

297
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,001
<i>¶¶ You make my dreams come true ¶¶</i>

298
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,662
<i>¶¶ Ooh-ooh ¶¶¶¶</i>

299
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:23,469
Don't tickle me!

00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,842
¶¶ What good is sitting ¶¶

301
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,815

302
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:36,014

303

305
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,589

- Boring!

306
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,027
¶¶ Come to the cabaret ¶¶¶¶

307
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,655
No, no, no, no, no!

308
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,496
I don't know what you want.

309
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,868
Well, I know what I don't want,
and it is all of this.

310
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:57,272
When I gave you this part I thought you
could handle it, but clearly you can't.

311
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:03,212
What this show needs is a star
with a little bit more maturity.

312
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,877
<i>I know what you're trying to do. You're trying
to get me to quit so you can be the star.</i>

313
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:11,048
Well, it won't work.
I'm not going anywhere.

314
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,518
I'll say.

315
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,190
I'm sleeping with him.

316
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,825
So am I.

317
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,229
- This play's weird.
- That's Mr. Ryerson's favorite line.

318
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,241
You're a really good actor, Finn.

319
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,971
Maybe you should consider
joining the musical.

320
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,913
Um, I'm pretty devoted to Glee.
I don't think I could just walk away from it.

321
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:40,008
I know how hard it was for you.

322
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,680
But I could justify doing both
if you came back.

323
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,553
<i>But we both know that's not gonna happen.</i>

324
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,752
- Do you know what we should do?
- Elope?

325
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,261
- What?
- Nothing.

326
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,230
We should go bowling.

327
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,357
You're always so stressed out
about the play.

328
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,028
You just need to loosen up.

329
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:02,233
I always go bowling whenever I'm worked up
about a big game or something.

330
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,733
- Just us?
- Yeah.

331
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,113
Yeah, th-th-that would be great.

332
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,672
I-I am really stressed out.

333
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,344
But that's the price you pay for being a star.

334
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,353
<i>Don't I know it.</i>

335
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,447
Hey, Rachel. April Rhodes, Rachel Berry.

336
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,859
<i>Can you give us the room? We need to teach
April the cues for "Don't Stop Believin'."</i>

337
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,692
Wait. She's singing the female lead?

338
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,789
Wait. She's in the Glee Club?

339
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,299
She's... ancient.

340
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,431
Talent doesn't age, sweetheart.

341
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,063
That's Rachel's part, Mr. Schue.

342
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,904
Well, Rachel's not
in the Glee Club anymore.

343
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,137
Thanks, Finn.

344
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,146
Rachel.

345
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,842
We're all really excited to see the play.

346
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,551
Make sure you save us
a seat in the front row.

347
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,094
¶¶ Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi ¶¶

348
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,790
¶¶ You, you, you, you, you, you, you ¶¶

349
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,643
Kurt?

350
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,076
Hi.

351
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,604
I'm a girl who knows her solvents,
and your breath smells like rubbing alcohol.

352
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:24,250
Oh, Bambi, I cried so hard
when those hunters shot your mommy.

353
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,797
Hey, Em. Just trying to figure out
the set list for Saturday.

354
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,860
I just got back from the emergency room.

355
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,270
Had them give me
four decontamination showers.

356
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,275
They call that the full Silkwood.

357
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:48,677
- What happened?
- Kurt was drunk and he ralphed on me.

358
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,682
Not really fessing up to
how he got the booze just yet...

359
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,686
but I'm pretty sure it's not a fake I.D. because
he looks like an 11 -year-old milkmaid.

360
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,813
Will, I think it was April.

361
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,120
<i>Her backpack's
always clinkin' with empties.</i>

362
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,026
I'm so sorry. I-I will... I'll talk to him.

363
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,859
Okay.

364
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,694
I'm, um...

365
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,791
I'm a little bit worried...

366
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,802
about the Glee Club.

367
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,804
So am I.

368
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:18,309
I mean, if we don't place
at regionals, it's all over.

369
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:23,180
We have obligations as teachers, Will...

370
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,546
to give kids opportunities for growth...

371
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,517
and enrichment.

372
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:32,250
With April in Glee, you're taking away
a kid's chance to grow...

373
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,657
and you're giving it to someone
whose brain is soaked in corn booze.

374
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,159
April's not finished, Emma...

375
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,496
and if Glee's gonna win
I need to give her a second chance.

376
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:45,331
She is a talented performer...

377
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,999
and I really think the kids are gonna learn
a lot of valuable technique from her.

378
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:52,066
Okay.

379
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,545
But I think you need to think
about why you're doing this...

380
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,606
and what you're
willing to sacrifice to get it.

381
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,432
You...

382
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,804
suck!

383
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,554
Oh.

384
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,556
Rough day at the office, cookie?

385
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,422
I just got a lot on my plate.

386
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,553
It's not easy being in the spotlight.

387
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:47,962
It's the difficult road I've chosen.

388
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,627
Yeah. I know that song, sister.

389
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:54,160
Um, do you have any NyQuil?
I could use a little pick-me-up.

390
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,135
No.

391
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,839
These high school boys
are a lot hotter than they used to be.

392
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,007
<i>That Finn Hudson is one cutie pie
I gots my eye on.</i>

393
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:09,452
- Finn's taken, April.
- Yeah? Well, some guys
like a little somethin' on the side.

394
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,819
I think your behavior
is totally inappropriate...

395
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,450
and your presence in this school
is a complete travesty.

396
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,359
What you choose to do with your life
is your own business...

397
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,364
but don't go around
screwing up everyone else's.

398
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,162
I'm not afraid of you, sweetie.

399
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,796
There was a time when I was
the biggest star around here.

400
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,340
And now that I've got that back...

401
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,933
I'm never lettin' it go.

402
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,296
Do I have to put my fingers in the holes?

403
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,496
Couldn't there be diseases in there?

404
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,005
Oh, no. Ball sharing
is all part of the fun.

405
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,305
Here, use the pink one.

406
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,504
<i>Pink's your favorite color, right?</i>

407
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,077
- Now what?
- Follow my lead. Come on.

408
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:18,584
Okay, so, just look at the pins.

409
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,648
Nice and straight.

410
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,401
You sure this is your first time?

411
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,529
<i>¶¶ One that won't make me nervous ¶¶</i>

412
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,835
<i>¶¶ Wonderin' what to do ¶¶</i>

413
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:41,004
<i>¶¶ One that makes me feel like
I feel when I'm with you ¶¶</i>

414
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,446
<i>- ¶¶ When I'm alone with you ¶¶¶¶
- Oh-ho-ho! April!</i>

415
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,178
- Whoo-hoo!
- You see what you can accomplish
when you're sober?

416
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:50,187
Sober? I'm rollin' on a fistful
of horse tranquilizers.

417
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,553
I can't feel my lips.

418
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,559
Oh! You know...

419
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,824
I think I'm gonna keep these shoes.

420
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:03,857
April, I... I brought you here
because I needed to talk to you.

421
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,630
Okay.

422
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:09,697
I'm concerned that
you're a bad influence on the Glee Club.

423
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:16,246
I can't have you around if you're gonna
encourage them to make bad choices.

424
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,221
You're right, Will.

425
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,282
As of right now, I'm back on the wagon.

426
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,156
Really?

427
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,333
That's great.

428
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,370
I have to tell you something.

429
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,236
I was in awe of you in high school.

430
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,539
I mean, of all the roads
I never traveled in my life...

431
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,171
the one I regret the most was never...

432
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,442
getting the chance to sing with you.

433
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,643
Really?

434
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,982
Yeah. That's how you get better...

435
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,147
singing with people
who are better than you.

436
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,215
You really thought that much of me?

437
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,093
April...

438
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,154
you are the reason I joined Glee Club.

439
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,764
No.

440
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,633
Um...

441
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,003
so your dream was always
to sing with me, huh?

442
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,171
Yeah.

443
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,543
Well, then come on. Come on!

444
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:32,118
Hey, April, karaoke's on Wednesdays.
Tonight's bingo.

445
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,387
<i>- Shut your gravy hole, Barry!
- Hey, guys.</i>

446
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,985
Uh, happy gambling. Here we go.

447

451

¶¶ And the night goes by
so very slow ¶¶

452
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:11,353
¶¶ Oh, I hope that it won't end though ¶¶

453
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,263

¶¶ How do I get you alone ¶¶

461

464
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,253
This is really good pizza.

465
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,155
Yeah, I think they import
the pepperoni from Michigan or something.

466
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,318
How's Glee?

467
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,919
Oh, well, everybody misses you.

468
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,591
Mmm, they miss my talent.

469
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,998
No. No. We're your friends.

470
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,503
We just miss having you around.

471
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,842
I love Glee. I just don't see the point in wasting
my energies someplace I'm not appreciated.

472
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,779
I appreciate you.

473
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,415
It's your last ball.

474
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,584
Just like the first time.

475
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,653
<i>But better.</i>

476
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,342
<i>¶¶ And it feels like love ¶¶</i>

477

478
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:13,210
<i>¶¶ And it feels like love ¶¶</i>

479
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,115
Come back to Glee.

480
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,121
<i>- ¶¶ It's all that we've got ¶¶
- What about Quinn?</i>

481
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:22,319
I don't know what's gonna happen in the future.
I just wanna spend more time with you now.

482
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,658
I'll have to quit the play.

483
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,061
I'll do it.

484
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:37,203
<i>¶¶ There's a heartbreak beat ¶¶</i>

485

<i>¶¶ And it feels like love ¶¶¶¶</i>

486
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,714
Maybe Quinn is lactose intolerant.

487
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,220
<i>That doesn't explain all the crying.</i>

488
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,917
<i>- M- Maybe she just doesn't like the group.
- Are you all that stupid?</i>

489
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,723
Seriously. I bet you thought
Bert and Ernie were just roommates.

490
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,922
Maybe Quinn's got one in the oven.

491
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,567
- Who's the baby's daddy?
- Who do you think?

492
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,843
Finn.

493
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:18,682
Yes, you've heard right.
I am returning to Glee Club.

494
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,342
In lieu of flowers...

495
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,216
please send all donations to a socially
conscious charity of your choice.

496
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,121
- This is a hot-damn mess.
- Oh, my God.

497
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:30,958
Uh, I'm sorry. I thought I'd be welcomed
back with a tad more enthusiasm.

498
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:34,863
Sorry. Glee Club has just been
rocked with its first scandal.

499
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,400
Quinn's knocked up.

500
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:41,097
And the baby daddy? Finn.

501
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:50,773
I just wanted to drop off the
application for that scholarship
you were telling me about.

502
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,216
I got Rachel to come back to Glee,
so I figure we have a real shot at it.

503
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:58,278
I'm so proud of you. See what you can
accomplish when you set your mind to it?

504
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,387
<i>Finn.</i>

505
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:08,762
You're a liar.
Why didn't you tell me Quinn was pregnant?

506
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,767
- Who told you?
- Everyone knows but me.

507
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:14,430
I'm the only fool who let you kiss me,
thinking you actually had feelings for me.

508
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,269
But I... I do.

509
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,743
Yeah, I haven't been totally honest with you,
but that's different than lying.

510
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,576
Maybe it's not that much different, but...

511
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,641
But look, I-I need to get a music
scholarship so I can go to college...

512
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:31,211
so I can get a good job,
so I can take care of my kid.

513
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:35,521
I can't do that if you don't come back to Glee Club.
You should take it as a compliment.

514
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,153
You could've just been honest with me.

515
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,465
Look, I know what I did was wrong.

516
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:45,434
I get that, but... that kiss was real.

517
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:49,234
Whatever it was, it ruined any chance
of me ever coming back to Glee.

518
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:52,743
Have fun playing house with Quinn
while you languish in your little ensemble.

519
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,779
My dreams are bigger than that,
and they're bigger than you.

520
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:03,286
Ms. Sylvester, we need to talk.

521
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,845
If you'd like me to return to the musical,
changes need to be made.

522
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,824
Rachel, I couldn't agree with you more.

523
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:12,352
When I heard Sandy wanted to write himself
into a scene as Queen Cleopatra...

524
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,661
I was aroused, then furious.

525
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:20,295
I hereby grant you
complete artistic control.

526
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,134
Congratulations, kiddo.

527
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:26,233
You now have everything
you could possibly want.

528
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,302
Isn't it a great feeling?

529
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:39,089
¶¶ Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
meow, meow, meow, meow ¶¶

530

meow, meow, meow, meow ¶¶

531
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,595
The house is packed.
You guys are gonna kick butt tonight.

532
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:48,427
Your first performance
in front of a real audience. I can't wait!

533
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:51,263
You guys are gonna love it.
W-Where's April?

534
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:55,932
Yee-haw!
Right on cue as usual!

535
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:59,204
Hey, roller boy. Handsome.
Oh, I like that color.

536
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:03,077
<i>Have you been working on the moves we ta...
You've got something right on...</i>

537
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,741
Oh!

538
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,377
Honk!

539
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,047
- There's my boy!
- Are you drunk?

540
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:14,683
- You promised me you'd sober up for this.
- When? Last night?

541
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,694
Well, I was drunk.
You can't hold me to that.

542
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,528
Hit it, Knuckles.

543
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,767
April Rhodes almost ran me over
in the parking lot just now.

544
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,368
You can't let her go on in her condition.

545
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,778
There is an auditorium full of people
waiting to see us perform...

546
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,942
and if she doesn't go on
none of the kids can.

547
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,954
Wow. It's really great
how committed you are to these kids.

548
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:54,361
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,

I need to talk to you.

581
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,744
Sorry, baby. Had to tinkle.
Come on. Act two.

582
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,912
No, I can't let you go back out there.

583
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:33,320
You broke a promise.

584
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,989
You're right.

585
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:40,553
It's a great moment for me, but...

586
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,565
it didn't feel right.

587
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:45,864
I don't belong up there.

588

But everybody deserves their moment
in the spotlight, you know, to shine.

589
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:55,678
Oh, I got that standing ovation, Will...

590
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,306
and it felt amazing...

591
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:02,443
like every bad decision
I'd ever made just went away.

592
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,579
I was back in the game.

593
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,852
But then I look over
and I see these sweet faces of these kids...

594
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,485
and I think...

595
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,859
I'm hoggin' their sunshine.

596
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,456
It's their turn now, not yours.

597
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,371
They're so lucky
to have you, Will, because...

598
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:25,637
you won't let what happened to me ever...

599
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,304
happen to any of them.

600
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,446
So, where are you gonna go?

601
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,507
I'll, um...

602
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:38,878
I'm gonna straighten up.

603
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,186
Maybe try to find a new dream.

604
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,218
I always loved Broadway.

Do you think there's a part out there...

607
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,358
for a washed-up has-been like me?

608

And hey, there's always Branson.

610
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,044
Will, Will, Will.

611
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,211
- Thank you.
- Oh.

612

No, no, no.

613
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,946
Thank you.

614
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,217
Branson, eh?

615
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,338
<i>They loved us! We're a hit!</i>

616
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,700
W-W-Where's April?

617
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:36,440
<i>You were right, Mr. Schue.
She'd massacre Mariah in a diva-off.</i>

618
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,709
April is amazing.

619
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,176
But she's not in the Glee Club anymore.

620
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,413
I...

621
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:49,550
I, uh... I screwed up bringing her here.

622
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:52,892
It was about me, and Glee Club
is supposed to be about you guys.

623
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,397
You don't need her to be great.

624
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,559
But we need her for the second act.

625
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,263
I'll just tell them
we had to cut the show short.

626
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,902
Hey, guys, you were great!

627
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,736
Don't worry.

628
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,779
There will be other performances.

629
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,371
Excuse me.

630
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,940
I think I might have a solution.

631
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,749
In show business, when a star can't perform
her understudy steps in.

632
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,623
I'd be happy to go on for April,
if you'd let me.

633
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,092
Since when are you willing
to be an understudy?

634
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:27,392
- Since I quit the play.
- Really? Why?

635
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:33,501
I realized being a star didn't make me
feel as special as being your friend.

636
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:40,910
If I'd let you down when you needed me
the most, I'd never forgive myself.

637
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,342
I know all the words to the song.

638
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,940
You don't know the choreography.

639
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,287
Then we're gonna have
to give her a lot of help out there.

640
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,792
Go get in your costume.

641
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,767
Excuse me.

00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,942
