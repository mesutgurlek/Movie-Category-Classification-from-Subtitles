4
00:00:05,358 --> 00:00:06,875
they want their big time Broadway
dreams to come true.

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,047
<i>Puck has big-time pool-cleaning
business dreams,</i>

6
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:10,399
<i>but first he has to graduate.</i>

7
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:11,767
<i>Roz Washington's been trying
to steal</i>

<i>the Cheerios! from Sue
the same way</i>

9
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:14,853
<i>Beiste stole
Cooter the football recruiter</i>

<i>and got married
after a romantic taco dinner.</i>

00:00:16,856 --> 00:00:18,547

on Glee.</i>

<i>RACHEL: Deep in space there are
giant interstellar clouds.</i>

14
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,116
<i>Most of them just float
through the universe,</i>

15
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:31,253
<i>content to be balls
of gas and space dust,</i>

16
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:32,754
<i>but there are special ones.</i>

17
00:00:32,839 --> 00:00:34,423
<i>Maybe they collide
with a supernova</i>

18
00:00:34,507 --> 00:00:37,042
<i>or are just made up
of something extra amazing,</i>

19
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:40,462

big for the nebulas they're in</i>

20
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:42,097
<i>and with the sheer
gravitational force</i>

21
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:45,967
<i>of their awesomeness,
they become a star.</i>

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,638
I am that amazing cloud.

23
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:51,573
My whole life has led
to this moment.

<i>My NYADA audition is this week.</i>

<i>My fiancé couldn't be
more excited or supportive.</i>

30
00:01:03,953 --> 00:01:07,572
Happy. Sad. Surprised.
Thoughtful. Presidential.

31
00:01:08,774 --> 00:01:10,125
Hmm.

32
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:11,460
<i>RACHEL:
I have some simple rules</i>

33
00:01:11,544 --> 00:01:12,911
<i>when I'm getting ready
for a big performance.</i>

34
00:01:12,962 --> 00:01:15,163
<i>First, no milk--
makes you too phlegmy.</i>

35
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:18,633
<i>Second, no doorknobs--
they spread infections.</i>

36
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:20,218
<i>So do kisses.</i>

37
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:21,837
<i>So what if I have
some superstitions, too?</i>

38
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:24,456
<i>I never step on cracks
and sometimes I walk bacards,</i>

39
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:25,891
<i>and everyone I see becomes
a metaphor</i>

40
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,642
<i>for the things
that could stop me.</i>

41
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,515
<i>I just give each one
my gold star death stare.</i>

42
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,183
<i>None of them stand a chance.</i>

43
00:01:35,268 --> 00:01:39,521
You are a star, Rachel Berry,
and in just two days from now

44
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:41,806
you are going to shine
so bright on that stage

45
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:45,277
that the sun is going
to cry with envy.

46
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:48,764
You know when your time is,
and it's now.

47
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:53,818
(bell ringing)

48
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:57,289
Hey, listen, man...

49
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,375
I overheard you talking to
that sophomore girl yesterday.

50
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,160
Whoa, back off, dude,
you've got a fiancée.

51
00:02:02,211 --> 00:02:03,595
Plus, I called dibs
on all the chicks

52
00:02:03,662 --> 00:02:04,846
whose boobs aren't
done growing yet.

53
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:06,465
Not that, okay?

54
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:08,433
You guys were talking
about graduation.

55
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:10,168
Yeah, I might not graduate,

56
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:12,804
but it's okay 'cause
gowns are for ladies

57
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:14,272
and tassels are for strippers.

58
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:18,343
Dude, hear me out.

59
00:02:18,394 --> 00:02:20,145
I know you got
your pool-cleaning business

60
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:22,481
and everything, but even if
college isn't your thing,

61
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:24,116
it's still important
to graduate.

62
00:02:24,183 --> 00:02:25,400
You gotta think ahead.

63
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:27,402
Who knows, maybe one day
you're gonna want

64
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:29,404
to clean the White House pool
or something.

65
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:31,523
I appreciate the brovention,
but I just told her that

66
00:02:31,574 --> 00:02:33,358
so I can get a sympathy
pants massage.

67
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:35,193
I'll be getting my diploma
right next you.

68
00:02:35,244 --> 00:02:37,913
I'm doing good in auto,
metal and wood shop.

69
00:02:37,997 --> 00:02:40,749
So, all I gotta do is pass Mrs. Doosenberry's
European Geography test

70
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,000
and I can graduate.

71
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:44,136
Yeah, but how are you
going to do that?

72
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:45,587
I got a plan.

73
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:48,757
Okay, class, what can you tell
me about the Danube River?

74
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:50,041
Mr. Puckerman?

75
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:51,560
It's wet.

76
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:52,844
Real wet.

77
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:56,681
I may not be too good
at world geography,

78
00:02:56,732 --> 00:02:58,850
but I'm real good
at female geography.

79
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:01,019
I'm gonna give
Doosenberry a little P-U-C-K

80
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,904
so I don't get an "F."

81
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,574
(bell ringing)
Hmm.

82
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:09,394
You guys, I just went to my
first student council meeting,

83
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:12,030
and I found out that we have
another prom this year.

84
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:13,748
So, as president, I need
to come up with a theme.

85
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,334
And I'm thinking,
if we do alien abductions,

86
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:18,920
we could set up cornfields
and probing booths.

87
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:20,956
Great. Yeah. All right.

88
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,407
SANTANA: Aw, hell.

89
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,343
Looks like Mr. Beiste went
all Chris Brown on Mrs. Beiste--

90
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:27,462
What happened, Coach, Cooter
put the smack-down on you

91
00:03:27,547 --> 00:03:29,464
'cause you wouldn't
let him be on top?

92
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:31,516
(laughter)
What did you just say?

93
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:33,084
Nothing.
It was a joke.

94
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:35,720
So, men hitting women
is funny to you?

95
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:37,105
Oh, please.
We obviously don't think

96
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,356
Beiste was hit by anybody.

97
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:39,608
I mean, look at her,
she's a wall.

98
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:40,809
Let me tell you something.

99
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:42,561
I'm Coach Roz Washington.

100
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:44,896
I'm an Olympic Champion,
and I do not suffer fools!

101
00:03:44,947 --> 00:03:48,483
Especially fools who think
domestic violence is funny.

102
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:49,551
I want your names.

103
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:51,453
Shannon!

104
00:03:51,537 --> 00:03:53,405
Write these names
down as placeholders.

105
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:54,406
Hatrack.

106
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:55,740
Asian Horror Movie.

107
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:56,541
Li'l Oprah.

108
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,276
Rojo Caliente.

109
00:03:58,327 --> 00:04:00,629
Salsa Caliente.

110
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:02,380
You're on my list now, girls.

111
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:05,500
You just watch
what happens next.

112
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,457
(bell ringing)
Black Sue,

113
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:14,059
it's no secret I despise you.

114
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:17,429
I spent the weekend sending
your photo to ivory poachers

115
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,231
who could make an
absolute fortune

116
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,317
selling your enormous white
teeth on the black market.

117
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:25,303
Yet it sounds like you and I finally
have something to agree on.

118
00:04:25,354 --> 00:04:27,305
Look, I understand
kids making jokes

119
00:04:27,356 --> 00:04:29,024
about things they find
uncomfortable,

120
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:31,610
like how there's a cheerleading
coach at their school

121
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:34,279
who's old as dirt and still
trying to have a baby,

122
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,998
who they know is gonna come out
looking weird with rabies

123
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,584
and wings, and it's gonna
fly out of your head box

124
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:41,486
and straight back into hell.

125
00:04:41,537 --> 00:04:43,622
But domestic violence?

126
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:46,091
That's nothing to joke about.
I couldn't agree with you more.

127
00:04:46,158 --> 00:04:47,876
WILL:
Hey! Mind if we join you ladies?

128
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,495
What are you guys talking about?
Your shiner.

129
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:52,097
William, your teenage minions

130
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:53,765
have taken this opportunity

131
00:04:53,832 --> 00:04:55,833
to start making jokes
about violence against women.

132
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:57,769
Are you serious?

133
00:04:57,836 --> 00:04:58,836
BEISTE: Wait a second.

134
00:04:58,888 --> 00:05:00,355
They think I got hit?

135
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,524
I was at the gym
hitting the speedbag,

136
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:05,560
but my timing was off,
and it came back and clocked me.

137
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:06,844
I can't believe any of my kids

138
00:05:06,896 --> 00:05:08,196
would make a joke about
something that serious.

139
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:10,315
Well, you better believe it,
whatever your name is.

140
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:12,067
I heard 'em
with my own two ears.

141
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:14,202
Yeah, you've got a problem
on your hands, William.

142
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:16,288
But not to worry.

00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:34,934
What if I sequin my cape?

158
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:36,435
Or if sing it in German?

159
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:38,037
Or if I did it in the nude?

160
00:06:38,104 --> 00:06:39,539
What?
I'm serious.

161
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:41,106
I've always been ahead
of the curve,

162
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:42,959
and my audition
needs to show that.

163
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:45,778
And right now it-it's too safe,
it's too predictable,

164
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:47,780
it's boring-- I'm bored!

165
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:48,965
I think you're overthinking it.

166
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:51,167
Excuse me, my foot fall asleep.

167
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:52,218
I can't feel it at all.

168
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:53,169
Can I go walk it off?

169
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:54,921
Yeah, sure, just don't go far.

170
00:06:54,972 --> 00:06:56,138
And thanks.

171
00:06:56,223 --> 00:06:57,723
Okay.

172
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,291
I'm starting from scratch.

173
00:06:59,343 --> 00:07:01,177
I need something fresh.

174
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:06,148
I need something edgy, something
completely unpredictable.

175
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,434
Or maybe I just
need more candles.

176
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:09,635
Oh, God, no.

177
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:10,653
No more candles.

178
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:13,823
(bell ringing)

179
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:19,829
Noah, why are you
closing the door?

180
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:21,364
So the chemistry
doesn't get out.

181
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:24,450
I brought you some illegal
fireworks I got in Tennessee

182
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:28,588
to remind you of us--
all explosive and taboo.

183
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:30,957
There is no "us," Mr. Puckerman.

184
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:34,844
Eleanor-- can I call you that?
No.

185
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,679
I've wanted you
since ninth grade

186
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:39,131
ever since I saw you
at that Canned Food Drive

187
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:40,132
for depressed Hawaiians.

188
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:41,667
Displaced Haitians.

189
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:44,654
Mmm... Your brain
turns me on.

190
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:50,109
(moaning)

191
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:51,176
Oh...

192
00:07:51,228 --> 00:07:52,311
Oh, oh, oh!

193
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:55,531
I...
I might be recently divorced

194
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:58,017
and excruciatily lonely,
but I can't be bought.

195
00:07:58,068 --> 00:07:59,402
I not buying you!

196
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:01,570
Just give me a D-minus,
and I'll tickle your thighs.

197
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:03,322
All right, we're done
here, Mr. Puckerman.

198
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:05,992
Look, lady, if you don't
pass me, I'll flunk out.

199
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:07,860
Oh, well, maybe, oh, just maybe,

200
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:10,329
you could crack open a book
and study like everyone else.

201
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,631
I can't!
I'm too stupid.

202
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:13,365
You're not stupid, Noah.

203
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:14,533
You're just lazy.

204
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:16,869
Screw you.
And screw McKinley.

205
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,870
I'm out of here! Forever!

206
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:19,555

Now I realize this room is
America's number one destination

230
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:32,310
for cheap, sappy moralizing,

231
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:33,710
but your insensitive behavior

232
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:37,745
is about to subject you to a
whole new level of preachiness.

233
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:40,033
Is this about the comment that
I made in the hallway earlier?

234
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:41,546
You bet your perfectly
round ass it is.

235
00:10:41,646 --> 00:10:44,148
Coach Sylvester, I hardly
think you're one to preach

236
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:46,183
on what we can
and cannot joke about.

237
00:10:46,268 --> 00:10:47,985
Yeah. You make fun of us
all the time.

238
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,021
Sandbags, I admit
I can be a bit abrasive.

239
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:52,106
And yes, I've fantasized
about slapping each and every

240
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:55,142
one of you square across the
face with a sturdy, wet fish.

241
00:10:55,193 --> 00:10:56,944
But that doesn't mean
you deserve it.

242
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:58,543
No one deserves to get hit.

243
00:10:58,663 --> 00:11:00,181
Coach Sylvester,
we already know that.

244
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:02,519
Yeah, and none of our guys would
ever do anything like that.

245
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:04,483
And if they did,
we'd just get the hell out.

246
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:06,104
I don't think
the gravity of this

247
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:07,572
is landing with you girls.

248
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,158
I think that not one
of you understand

249
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:12,206
what violence in a home
really feels like.

250
00:11:12,456 --> 00:11:15,497
When I was growing up,
my aunt married a man

251
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:17,082
that was nice to everybody.

252
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:19,451
Used to bring us presents
when he came to visit

253
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:22,504
and never had an unkind
word to say to anybody.

254
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:25,924
But at home, he had a temper.

255
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:28,043
And that man
started beating her.

256
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,662
She'd lie, she'd make
a joke out of it.

257
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,714
She said she'd done
this or that wrong.

258
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:34,015
She'd tell my momma

259
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,992
he was a good man
and she had it coming.

260
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:41,172
It took my aunt five years

261
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:43,942
and a trip to ICU

262
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:48,936
to stop making excuses for
that man and get a divorce.

263
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:52,200
Ladies, the American songbook
is chock-full of songs

264
00:11:52,284 --> 00:11:54,185
making light of men
hitting women.

265
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:55,487
And since the only way to

266
00:11:55,538 --> 00:11:57,038
get anything into
your thick, dopey heads

267
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:59,707
is to force you to sing about
it, for this week's assignment,

268
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:03,795
I want you to turn those songs
into songs of empowerment

269
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:07,532
that say, "You lay a hand on me,
it's over."

270
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:11,803
(school bell ringing)

271
00:12:13,672 --> 00:12:15,840
Blaine, I need some help.

272
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:17,926
Tina wants me to slick
my hair back for prom,

273
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,562
and I've never used gel, so I
have no idea what I'm doing.

274
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:22,213
Biggest tip I can give you:

275
00:12:22,264 --> 00:12:24,549
never brush after you gel.
Disaster.

276
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,018
Second tip: feel free
to use a little sweat

277
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:29,437
or a little splash of water
to reactivate the gel

278
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:31,222
or give it a complete new look.

279
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:32,390
See that?

280
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:34,692
It's a whole new 'do,
my friend.

281
00:12:34,743 --> 00:12:36,494
Hey.

282
00:12:36,562 --> 00:12:38,746
I hear you guys talking a lot,

283
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:40,665
but is anybody gonna
mention what's missing,

284
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:41,666
what's different here?

285
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,034
(snaps fingers)

286
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:44,869
You finally shook the last
five pounds. Dude, congrats!

287
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,371
(murmuring, cheering)
Big deal, big deal.

288
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:48,590
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

289
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:49,591
It's Puck.

290
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:52,043
He's not here.

291
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:53,878
Dropped completely off the grid.

292
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:54,963
Anybody notice that?

293
00:12:56,015 --> 00:12:57,098
Doesn't even log on

294
00:12:57,183 --> 00:12:58,349
to Call of Duty tourneys
anymore.

295
00:12:58,417 --> 00:12:59,601
Oh, no.

296
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:00,602
I'm going into
full-blown prayer mode.

297
00:13:00,686 --> 00:13:01,970
Look, we need to go

298
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:03,721
<i>all Black Hawk Down here.</i>

299
00:13:03,772 --> 00:13:05,306
All he needs to pass
is that one test.

300
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:07,525
Either we all graduate together

301
00:13:07,593 --> 00:13:08,893
or what was the point
of all this?

302
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:11,229
No man gets left behind.

303
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,982
We will get him to pass.

304
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:15,433
By any means necessary.

305
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:17,235
Right!

306
00:13:17,286 --> 00:13:18,269
(school bell ringing)

307
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,205
Excuse me.
Um, this is insanity.

308
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:21,739
Wait, why are you
talking to me?

309
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,274
I thought you were saving
your voice for your audition.

310
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:24,742
No, I vowed
not to speak with you

311
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:26,077
unless William and Kate
got pregnant,

312
00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:27,378
Liza passed or unless one of us
was in grave danger.

313
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:29,831
Tell me Liza's okay.
She's fine, but you're not.

314
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:31,416
Okay, I just talked to Blaine
and he told me

315
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:32,717
about "Not The Boy Next Door."

316
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:34,636
You cannot sing that
for your NYADA your audition.

317
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,639
I need to be excited about this,
and this is the first time

318
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:39,290
I've been inspired in
this whole process.

319
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:41,459
No, no,
it's too controversial, okay?

320
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,595
You can't wear Peter Allen's
gold lamé pants.

321
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:45,463
It was too
controversial in 1962.

322
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:46,598
(sighs)

323
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:48,316
Look, the play, and that song,

324
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,601
won Hugh Jackman the Tony.
I know.

325
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:51,802
And NYADA is a Broadway school.

326
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:53,104
Yes, but you haven't
rehearsed it enough, okay?

327
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:55,023
I'm not singing "Don't Rain
on my Parade" because

328
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:57,242
it's my go-to song and
because it's impossible for me

329
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:59,611
not to cry when I sing it,
but because I have been

330
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:01,913
belting out that song
since I was two years old.

331
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,865
All right, this is,
this is the biggest,

332
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:05,617
biggest moment
of our lives here.

333
00:14:05,668 --> 00:14:07,585
We cannot be taking risks.

334
00:14:07,653 --> 00:14:10,004
Isn't that the exact
moment to take a risk?

335
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:13,508
Kurt, can I be honest with you?

336
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:15,260
I think this is
self-sabotage.

337
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:17,512
All right, you're scared
you're not going to get in,

338
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:18,796
so you're using
something to blame

339
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:21,165
just in case this all
doesn't work out.

340
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:27,605
Do you really think
I'm doing that?

341
00:14:27,673 --> 00:14:29,724
I think you think
you're not good enough.

342
00:14:29,808 --> 00:14:31,008
But you are good enough.

343
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,694
Okay, you don't
have to go and do

344
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:34,562
some big, flamboyant number,
all right?

345
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:37,865
"Music of the Night" is
your "Don't Rain on My Parade."

346
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,784
I'm torn.

347
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:41,236
Uh, I have been
practicing Phantom

348
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,537
for the last three months. Yes!

349
00:14:42,621 --> 00:14:46,207
And-and I believe in you,
and I believe that song.

350
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,243
So much that I will be
your Christine.

351
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:49,877
You will?
I will.

352
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:52,029
Okay, let's do it!

353
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:53,665
"Music of the Night" it is.
Good! All right, good.

354
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:55,667
Tina won't mind being recast.
No, she won't, so...

355
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:57,034
Oh, that's great! Okay. Okay.

356
00:14:57,086 --> 00:14:58,670
NYADA's not gonna know what hit them.
Uh-uh.

357
00:14:58,721 --> 00:14:59,504
Trust me.
Okay.

358
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:00,972
And now,

359
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,092
the six merry murderesses
of the Cook County Jail

360
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:07,562

"The Cell Block Tango."

You know how people have these
little habits that get you down?

374
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:43,881
Like Bernie.

375
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:46,417
Bernie-- he liked to chew gum.

376
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:49,470
No, not chew, pop.

377
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:52,557
So I came home this one day,
and I'm really irritated,

378
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:54,559
and I'm looking for
a little bit of sympathy.

379
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,278
And there's Bernie
lying on the couch,

380
00:15:57,363 --> 00:15:59,397
drinking a beer and chewing--

381
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:01,949
no, not chewing, popping!

382
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:03,985
So, I said to him, I said,

383
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:07,205
"You pop that gum
one more time..."

384
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:08,272
(sighs)

385
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:09,741
And he did.

386
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,209
So I took the shotgun
off the wall

387
00:16:11,276 --> 00:16:15,546
and I fired two warning shots.

388
00:16:15,614 --> 00:16:19,717
Into his head.

399
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:44,042
In storms my husband Wilbur
in a jealous rage.

400
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:45,910
"You been doing the milkman,"
he says.

401
00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:48,646
He was crazy,
and he kept on screaming,

402
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:50,782
"You been doing the milkman."

403
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,149
And then he ran into my knife.

404
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:55,036
He ran into my knife ten times.

416
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:31,873
Well, you completely butchered
one of my all-time favorite

417
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,208
Kander and Ebb tunes, while
completely missing the point

00:17:34,293 --> 00:17:36,527
of absolutely everything.

419
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:38,546
You girls are cray-cray.

420
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:39,881
You were supposed
to pick a song

421
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:42,350
that gave women the
self-esteem and courage

422
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,802
to get the hell out of
an abusive situation.

423
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,870
But, oh, no.

424
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:48,139
You pick a song about
crazy women

425
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:50,508
in their panties killing
their men for chewing gum.

426
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,876
How is that supposed to help?

427
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:55,430
(school bell ringing)

428
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:57,214
How dare you stand up and leave?

429
00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:58,850
We all wanted out of that room.

430
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:00,067
I'm sorry.

431
00:18:00,152 --> 00:18:01,436
I was sitting there
listening to that song,

432
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,220
and I couldn't handle it.

433
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:04,572
I was too embarrassed.

434
00:18:04,656 --> 00:18:06,073
Why would you be embarrassed?

435
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:08,359
Those girls were the ones
stinking up that auditorium.

436
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,244
He hit me.

437
00:18:10,312 --> 00:18:12,447
I didn't get hurt

438
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:14,615
boxing at the gym.

439
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,900
Cooter hit me.

440
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:19,036
He'd been bugging me all weekend

441
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:21,539
to do the dishes,
and I-I promised him I would,

442
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,740
but I forgot.

443
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,091
And then when he
came home from work,

444
00:18:24,176 --> 00:18:26,260
I could tell he had
had a few drinks.

445
00:18:26,345 --> 00:18:28,546
And he started yelling, and
I tried to calm him down,

446
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:29,881
and then he hit me.

447
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:31,182
But as soon as it happened,

448
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:33,851
I mean, right away,
he was so sorry.

449
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,521
And he started crying and
begging me to forgive him.

450
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:40,057
Sweetheart, you're as big
as a house.

451
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,310
Why didn't you just turn around
and kick his ass?

452
00:18:42,394 --> 00:18:44,061
I'm not a violent person.

453
00:18:44,112 --> 00:18:45,947
Shannon, you have to get
out of that house right now.

454
00:18:46,031 --> 00:18:47,315
Can't.

455
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:48,566
I can't leave him.

456
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:49,450
Why the hell not?

457
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:54,705
(sobbing softly)

458
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:58,493
Because I don't think anybody
else is ever going to love me.

459
00:18:58,577 --> 00:19:00,545
Shannon,

460
00:19:00,612 --> 00:19:02,497
listen.

461
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:04,966
You're gonna stay
with me tonight, okay?

462
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,051
If you don't have
a change of clothes,

463
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:08,970
I have a tent you can wear.

464
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:19,096
Looking good, Noah.

465
00:19:19,147 --> 00:19:21,131
Hey, the kids are
at the neighbors.

466
00:19:21,183 --> 00:19:23,651
You want to go for a quickie
in the pool house?

467
00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:25,236
Not this time, Mrs. Collins.

468
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:27,355
I'm gonna keep it legit
'cause today's my last day.

469
00:19:28,574 --> 00:19:29,690
Final cleaning's on the house--

470
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:30,741
a good-bye gift.

471
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:31,943
Last day?
Where are you going?

472
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:33,744
Isn't graduation coming up?

473
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:36,030
I'm done with school.
Don't need it.

474
00:19:36,114 --> 00:19:39,200
I'm gonna blow town and get a
head start to the West Coast.

475
00:19:39,284 --> 00:19:40,251
Huh.

476
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:41,919
Too bad.

477
00:19:41,987 --> 00:19:43,838
I'll miss those abs.

478
00:19:54,332 --> 00:19:56,166
Dad?

479
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:58,620
All right, everyone,
listen carefully.

480
00:19:58,688 --> 00:20:00,355
Puck's scheduled to arrive
at the Schneider's pool

481
00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:03,622
at 2:00 p.m., which means
he should be there at 3:30.

482
00:20:03,742 --> 00:20:04,792
Sam, you're the driver,

483
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:06,243
so stay in the car.

484
00:20:06,294 --> 00:20:07,545
Well, can I play
with the radio?

485
00:20:07,596 --> 00:20:08,679
Rory, you're on lookout here.

486
00:20:08,747 --> 00:20:09,964
Who am I looking out for?

487
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:11,716
I mean, besides Puck?

488
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:14,552
Blaine, Mike and myself
will triangulate

489
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:16,554
a very carefully planned
attack on Puck

490
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:18,689
here, here and here.

491
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:21,025
Is that a bear I'm hiding behind?
No, no, it's a bush.

492
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:22,443
Looks like a bear.
It's not a bear.

493
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:23,761
Maybe a shrub.

494
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:25,730
What's the difference
between a shrub and a bush?

495
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:27,097
What do I do?

496
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:28,366
Oh, that's the best part.

497
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:29,933
You're going to be the bait.

498
00:20:29,985 --> 00:20:32,820
So, when Puck comes in the gate,
you just roll your wheelchair

499
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,438
into the pool, and
all of a sudden, we...

500
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:38,459
Are you all right, dude?

501
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:41,295
Yeah, look like you saw
a ghost, man. What's up?

502
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,581
Just saw my dad.

503
00:20:43,632 --> 00:20:46,250
I haven't seen him
in five years.

504
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:47,718
I brought us a little refresher.

505
00:20:47,786 --> 00:20:51,338
The last six-pack from
my micro-brewery--

506
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:54,892
Puckerman's Special Sauce.

507
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:56,761
I'm good.
Oh, come on.

508
00:20:56,812 --> 00:20:59,480
A dad likes to share a beer
with his son. Be fine.

509
00:20:59,564 --> 00:21:01,098
All right.

510
00:21:04,903 --> 00:21:07,271
So what are you doing here?

511
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:11,492
I hate to do this, but, uh, I'm
kind of at the end of my rope.

512
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:13,244
I need to borrow some money.

513
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:14,995
From me? For what?
Mm-hmm.

514
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,831
Rent.

515
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:21,669
Hardest thing for a man
to do... is ask for help.

516
00:21:23,338 --> 00:21:24,622
What did you do?

517
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:27,591
I gave it to him.

518
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:28,826
500 bucks.

519
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:32,296
That's most of
my seed money for L.A.

520
00:21:32,347 --> 00:21:34,498
I don't get it. Why?

521
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:36,350
'Cause I knew
if I gave it to him,

522
00:21:36,435 --> 00:21:38,436
I'd never have to see him again.

523
00:21:38,503 --> 00:21:40,688
You know he dropped
out of high school, too?

524
00:21:40,772 --> 00:21:43,474
Just kept seeing myself
sitting where he was sitting,

525
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:44,842
across from Beth--

526
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:47,194
no dignity, no future--

527
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,446
begging her for rent money.

528
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:50,481
I cannot let that happen to me.

529
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:51,982
I have to graduate.

530
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:54,068
And to do that,

531
00:21:54,152 --> 00:21:56,019
I have to pass this damn
European Geography test.

532
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:59,457
Will you help me?

533
00:21:59,524 --> 00:22:01,125
PUCK:
Please?

534
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:03,194
Never leave a man behind.

535
00:22:06,414 --> 00:22:07,865
Thanks, bro.

536
00:22:11,386 --> 00:22:12,636
Want some Throat Coat?
Oh.

537
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:14,204
Just to avoid
last-minute irritation.

538
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:15,473
Hit me.
Okay.

539
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,308
So, um, Kurt,
you know how they say

540
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,676
that knowledge is power? Mm-hmm.

541
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,344
Okay, well, I got
some last-minute intel

542
00:22:20,395 --> 00:22:21,879
about our NYADA
adjudicator, and...

543
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,347
well, I don't want to make you

544
00:22:23,398 --> 00:22:24,849
any more nervous
than you already are.

545
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,066
Okay, now you have to tell me.

546
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:29,403
It's Carmen Tibideaux.

547
00:22:36,194 --> 00:22:37,077
My God.
What?

548
00:22:37,162 --> 00:22:38,329
Carmen Tibideaux?

549
00:22:38,396 --> 00:22:39,580
She's one of NYADA's
most famous--

550
00:22:39,664 --> 00:22:40,948
and infamous-- alums.

551
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:42,783
<i>She's played Broadway.
She's performed</i>

552
00:22:42,868 --> 00:22:44,084
the most demanding roles

553
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:45,336
in the greatest opera
houses in the world.

554
00:22:45,403 --> 00:22:46,737
I think I'm going to throw up.

555
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:48,756
Look, my-my dads have been
trolling the NYADA chat rooms,

556
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,407
and they said that she's
been appointed dean

557
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:51,842
of Vocal Performance
and Song Interpretation,

558
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,744
and now she's going
across the country

559
00:22:53,795 --> 00:22:55,412
to pick out her own
inaugural class.

560
00:22:55,463 --> 00:22:56,747
<i>All right.
KURT: Oh, Rachel,</i>

561
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:58,349
<i>you know the stories
of her wrath</i>

562
00:22:58,416 --> 00:22:59,800
as well as I do.

563
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:01,785
<i>Once, "La Tibideaux"
stopped a performance of Medea</i>

564
00:23:01,853 --> 00:23:04,221
<i>at the Met because someone
glanced at their watch</i>

565
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:06,857
while she was doing one of her
"I'm killing my babies" arias.

566
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:08,859
<i>She destroyed him.
Do you think she's</i>

567
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:10,060
going to have any qualms about

568
00:23:10,111 --> 00:23:11,195
cutting us off if
we displease her?

569
00:23:11,262 --> 00:23:12,229
Kurt Hummel.

570
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,315
You're going to be amazing.

571
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:16,617
All right, I-I believe
in you, and no one

572
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:18,736
can sing this song
better than you can.

573
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:21,238
Even Michael Crawford?

574
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:22,623
(patting on back)

575
00:23:22,707 --> 00:23:24,491
Go... go get 'em.

576
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,216
Hello.

577
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:33,500
I'm Kurt Hummel,

578
00:23:33,585 --> 00:23:35,502
and I'll be performing
"Music of the Night"

579
00:23:35,587 --> 00:23:36,637
<i>from the seminal
Phantom of the Opera</i>

580
00:23:36,721 --> 00:23:38,222
by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber.

581
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:39,290
(sighs)

582
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:43,928
Which I bet you hear a lot of.

583
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:45,295
That song.

584
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:49,149
<i>That, "The Impossible Dream"
from La Mancha</i>

585
00:23:49,234 --> 00:23:51,268
<i>and "Being Alive"
from Company, yes.</i>

586
00:23:52,437 --> 00:23:54,137
It's a safe and standard choice.

587
00:23:56,641 --> 00:23:59,493
Which is why I've decided
to change things up a bit.

588
00:24:01,663 --> 00:24:03,948
Here, in the 11th hour,

589
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:06,000
I've decided to go
in a different direction.

590
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:08,535
Something that's
a little more out there,

591
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,371
but much more me.

592
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,507
"Not the Boy Next Door,"

593
00:24:13,592 --> 00:24:15,542
<i>from the Peter Allen
bio-musical, The Boy from Oz.</i>

595
00:24:25,053 --> 00:24:26,687

You know, Hugh Jackman
won a Tony Award

632
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,324
for playing Peter Allen.

633
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:46,910
Hugh trained with me
the summer I was in residence

634
00:26:46,978 --> 00:26:49,863
at the Sydney Opera House,
and I'm certain

635
00:26:49,948 --> 00:26:52,649
that he would have been...

636
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,987
as impressed with what you did
with that song as I am.

637
00:26:57,038 --> 00:26:59,006
A bold choice, young man.

638
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,341
I congratulate you
for taking such a risk today.

639
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:04,211
Thank you.

640
00:27:04,295 --> 00:27:05,629
(excited mumbling)

641
00:27:16,503 --> 00:27:18,882
Millions of moments
have led up to this moment.

642
00:27:18,976 --> 00:27:21,628
All you have to do
is just be yourself

643
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,480
because you're a star.

644
00:27:23,547 --> 00:27:25,889
FINN:
I'll second that.

645
00:27:27,802 --> 00:27:29,386
Thank you.

646
00:27:32,106 --> 00:27:33,473
You nervous?

647
00:27:33,524 --> 00:27:35,809
Oddly enough, not at all.

648
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,852
No, I'm... I'm ready.

649
00:27:37,972 --> 00:27:40,013
CARMEN (over speaker):
Rachel Berry.

650
00:27:48,656 --> 00:27:50,040
Hi. I'm Rachel Berry,

651
00:27:50,124 --> 00:27:51,470
and I'll be singing
"Don't Rain on My Parade"

652
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,458
<i>from my favorite musical,
Funny Girl.</i>

653
00:27:56,247 --> 00:27:58,632
(Barbra Streisand's "Don't Rain
on My Parade" begins)

654
00:28:01,469 --> 00:28:03,637

00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:22,889
(music stops)

663
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,441
I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so, so sorry.

664
00:28:24,525 --> 00:28:25,909
Please, let me just start over
one more time.

665
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:27,560
I'm sorry.

666
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:29,779
Please just start over again
one more time.

667
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:33,750

672
00:28:45,012 --> 00:28:46,046
This isn't happening.

673
00:28:46,097 --> 00:28:47,881
(stammers)

674
00:28:47,932 --> 00:28:50,650
I'm... I'm so sorry.
I don't know...

675
00:28:50,718 --> 00:28:51,651
I know this song backwards.

676
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:52,719
I know this...

677
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,920
(sighs) Okay.

678
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:55,308
Please, let me just do it
one more time.

679
00:28:55,428 --> 00:28:57,590
I can start it over one more time.
No.

680
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,094
Excuse me?

681
00:29:01,145 --> 00:29:02,479
You get eight bars.

682
00:29:02,563 --> 00:29:03,947
I gave you 16.

683
00:29:04,031 --> 00:29:05,398
Do you know what happens

684
00:29:05,449 --> 00:29:07,494
when you forget the words
on Broadway?

685
00:29:07,614 --> 00:29:09,819
They give the job
to your understudy.

686
00:29:09,904 --> 00:29:11,905
I'm very sorry,
but this audition is over.

687
00:29:11,956 --> 00:29:14,290
No, please...
please, please, please.

688
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,792
You have to believe me.
You just have to...

689
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:18,378
please just give me
one more chance, please.

690
00:29:18,445 --> 00:29:19,829
Please.

691
00:29:19,914 --> 00:29:21,831
Please.

692
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,290
What's the biggest city
in Ireland?

693
00:29:31,342 --> 00:29:32,087
Blarneycock.

694
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:33,825
Dude, he's pointing
right at it. Come on.

695
00:29:33,945 --> 00:29:35,013
My brain is fried.

696
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:36,930
It's freaking 3:00
in the morning.

697
00:29:36,981 --> 00:29:38,314
That's awesome--
we've still got

698
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,933
nine hours to cram
before your test.

699
00:29:39,984 --> 00:29:41,401
(Puck groaning)

700
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,988
How's Rachel?

701
00:29:45,072 --> 00:29:47,524
Uh... upset.

702
00:29:47,608 --> 00:29:49,475
Devastated.
Wants to be alone.

703
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:52,645
Her dads are doing something
called sitting shivah.

704
00:29:52,696 --> 00:29:55,815
I mean... I just don't get it.

705
00:29:55,866 --> 00:29:58,451
It was a total choke.

706
00:29:58,502 --> 00:30:00,036
Okay. (sighs)

707
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:03,006
So, let's hop on back
to sunny Spain.

708
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,758
Hey, look, here's a fun fact:

709
00:30:04,825 --> 00:30:07,127
Spain is considered
a mostly mountainous country,

710
00:30:07,178 --> 00:30:09,379
interspersed
with picturesque plateaus

711
00:30:09,463 --> 00:30:10,880
and arid valleys.
That's fascinating.

712
00:30:10,965 --> 00:30:12,682
No, it's not.
Who the hell cares?

713
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,768
Not even Einstein
uses this crap.

714
00:30:14,835 --> 00:30:17,437
So wipe it from your memory
tomorrow, after your test.

715
00:30:17,504 --> 00:30:19,055
FINN:
Now, for the bonus round.

716
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,441
Which region of Spain
receives the most rainfall?

717
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:23,276
I don't know. You do.
Just think about it, dude.

718
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:25,678
The rain in Spain
falls mainly...

719
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:27,280
Whatever. In the flatlands.

720
00:30:27,347 --> 00:30:29,515
The plains.
What was that?

721
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:32,235
The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain.

722
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,820

Moving on.

751
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:00,540
What rhymes with "preindustrial
European deforestation"?

752
00:32:00,607 --> 00:32:01,741
(sighs)
Anybody?

753
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,502
Shannon,
I'm very upset with you.

754
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,838
You promised to stay
the night at my house.

755
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,706
I made up my sofa bed for you.

756
00:32:13,826 --> 00:32:16,026
I ruined my tent fashioning
a neck hole in it.

757
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,010
And what am I supposed
to do with those

758
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,512
nine whole chickens
in my fridge?

759
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,197
I'm sorry, Sue.
I forgot to call you.

760
00:32:21,282 --> 00:32:22,515
But I'm okay.

761
00:32:23,868 --> 00:32:25,368
I spent all last night

762
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:27,287
moving in with my sister,
Denise.

763
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:29,155
Your sister's name
is Denise Beiste?

764
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:32,792
Well, Coach, I'm glad to hear
that you're okay.

765
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,878
And I hope that whatever bridge

766
00:32:34,962 --> 00:32:36,379
Denise Beiste lives under
is nice and cozy.

767
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,419
Beiste, I really admire
what you're doing.

768
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:45,138
I know how difficult it must be.

769
00:32:46,474 --> 00:32:49,309
Not as difficult
as what I'm about to do.

770
00:32:49,376 --> 00:32:52,044
(school bell ringing)

771
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:56,149
BEISTE: Girls, I have
a confession to make.

772
00:32:57,435 --> 00:32:59,686
It's a really hard thing
to talk about,

773
00:32:59,737 --> 00:33:02,739
but I feel like
I owe it to you.

774
00:33:02,823 --> 00:33:05,492
I didn't get hit
by a punching bag.

775
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,360
I got hit by my husband.

776
00:33:07,411 --> 00:33:09,228
Are you serious?

777
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,030
Did he break his hand?

778
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:12,832
I'm sorry I lied
to you about it.

779
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:16,619
But nobody tells you
what you're supposed to do

780
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:17,670
when something
like this happens.

781
00:33:17,738 --> 00:33:19,923
I was shocked,

782
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:22,008
I was... ashamed.

783
00:33:22,075 --> 00:33:24,344
So I made excuses for myself,

784
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:26,713
to make it okay.

785
00:33:26,764 --> 00:33:28,314
And I heard you girls say that

786
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:29,766
you thought your boyfriends
would never

787
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:32,202
do anything to you like that.

788
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:35,021
And a week ago, I would've said

789
00:33:35,088 --> 00:33:36,389
exactly the same thing.

790
00:33:37,758 --> 00:33:38,775
And I was wrong.

791
00:33:40,344 --> 00:33:44,614
But Cooter always seemed
like such a nice guy.

792
00:33:44,698 --> 00:33:46,950
Yeah, I always just thought he
was a big, smiley doofus.

793
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:49,702
He is. Most of the time.

794
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,739
But nobody knows what
goes on behind closed doors.

795
00:33:52,807 --> 00:33:54,757
Are you considering
pressing charges?

796
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,659
Yeah.

797
00:33:58,212 --> 00:34:00,380
And more than that,
I got out of there,

798
00:34:00,447 --> 00:34:01,881
and I moved in with my sister,

799
00:34:01,949 --> 00:34:04,617
and that feels really good.

800
00:34:05,786 --> 00:34:07,637
But you girls?

801
00:34:09,223 --> 00:34:12,725
You not only opened
my eyes to this...

802
00:34:12,793 --> 00:34:14,627
you maybe even saved my life.

803
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:19,599
Thank you.

804
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,687

805
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:40,487

How do you think you did?

822
00:35:32,153 --> 00:35:33,487
My best.

823
00:35:33,571 --> 00:35:35,638

It's usually a good sign.

826
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,896
You know, it's weird,
but... I think I did.

827
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,597
Thanks to you guys.

828
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,567
So thank you.
All of you.

829
00:35:45,651 --> 00:35:47,903
You know, it's hard
growing up without a dad,

830
00:35:47,987 --> 00:35:50,105
because you don't have
any dude role models,

831
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,940
except NFL players and
video game characters.

832
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:55,026
But I lucked out because
instead of one dad,

833
00:35:55,078 --> 00:35:56,962
I got a whole gang of them.

834
00:35:57,082 --> 00:35:59,274
You guys showed me what
it means to be a man.

835
00:35:59,394 --> 00:36:02,751
Not just last night,
but for four years.

836
00:36:02,835 --> 00:36:04,086
Even you, Blaine.

837
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,288
Thanks?
Let's hug it out.

838
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,423
Aw, yeah.
Bring it in, guys.

839
00:36:08,508 --> 00:36:09,624
On hand.
All the time.

840
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:17,857
You girls wanted to see me?

841
00:36:18,706 --> 00:36:20,781
We wanted the chance to say
that we're sorry,

842
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:22,031
and we had no idea.

843
00:36:22,154 --> 00:36:24,272
No idea that this
was really happening

844
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:26,191
to someone we care
so much about.

845
00:36:26,242 --> 00:36:27,525
And we're really proud of you

(school bell ringing)

926
00:39:39,685 --> 00:39:41,436
Can I just say, for the record,

927
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,446
that Carmen Tibideaux
is a total bitch.

928
00:39:44,566 --> 00:39:46,941
I mean, she should've let
you start over. She did.

929
00:39:47,026 --> 00:39:49,894
I mean, a second time.

930
00:39:49,945 --> 00:39:51,562
You killed the beginning
of that song.

931
00:39:51,613 --> 00:39:53,698
I-I wouldn't be surprised if
you got accepted just from that.

932
00:39:53,765 --> 00:39:56,103
Kurt, I really appreciate what
you're trying to do, but...

933
00:39:57,703 --> 00:39:59,437
we both know what happened.

934
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,290
All right? I had my chance,
and I choked.

935
00:40:02,374 --> 00:40:04,909
I choked on a song that I've
been singing my entire life.

936
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,378
And now it's over, and there's
no one to blame but me.

937
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:12,283
You were amazing, though.

938
00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:15,169
You were. I mean,
you went with your gut,

939
00:40:15,254 --> 00:40:18,289
and-and you were better
than you've ever been.

940
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,591
You and Finn are gonna be
great in New York together.

941
00:40:20,642 --> 00:40:22,176
Well, you're coming, too.

942
00:40:22,261 --> 00:40:24,128
Of course you're coming.

943
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:26,180
Even if it doesn't work out
with NYADA, you'll find...

944
00:40:26,265 --> 00:40:28,683
Could we just not talk about
this anymore, please?

945
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:29,967
It's just... I haven't...

946
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:31,635
I haven't slept
in like two days,

947
00:40:31,687 --> 00:40:33,688
and I just am tired really tired
