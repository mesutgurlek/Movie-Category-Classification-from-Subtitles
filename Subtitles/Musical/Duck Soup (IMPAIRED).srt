00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
 THIS IS THE LAND
  OF THE FREE 

149
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,500
  THE LAST MAN NEARLY RUINED
  THIS PLACE, HE DIDN'T   KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT 

150
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,400
  IF YOU THINK THIS COUNTRY'S
  BAD OFF NOW JUST WAIT   'TIL I GET THROUGH WITH IT 

151
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,500


152
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,300
  THE COUNTRY'S TAXES
  MUST BE FIXED AND   I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT 

153
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,100
  IF YOU THINK YOU'RE PAYING
  TOO MUCH NOW JUST WAIT   'TIL I GET THROUGH WITH IT 

154
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,300


155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,400
 I WILL NOT STAND FOR ANYTHING
  THAT'S CROOKED OR UNFAIR 

156
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,800
 I'M STRICTLY ON THE UP AND UP
  SO EVERYONE BEWARE 

157
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,900
  IF ANYONE'S CAUGHT
  TAKING GRAFT AND I   DON'T GET MY SHARE 

158
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,200
  WE STAND 'EM UP
  AGAINST THE WALL   AND POP GOES THE WEASEL 

159
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,500
 SO EVERYONE BEWARE
  WHO'S CROOKED OR UNFAIR 

160
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,700
  NO ONE MUST TAKE
  A BIT OF GRAFT UNLESS   HE GETS HIS SHARE 

161
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,200
 IF ANY MAN SHOULD COME BETWEEN
  A HUSBAND AND HIS BRIDE 

162
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,000
  WE FIND OUT
  WHICH ONE SHE PREFERS   BY LETTING HER DECIDE 

163
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,100
 IF SHE PREFERS THE OTHER MAN
  THE HUSBAND STEPS OUTSIDE 

164
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,200
  WE STAND THEM UP
  AGAINST THE WALL AND   POP GOES THE WEASEL 

165
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,100
  THE HUSBAND STEPS OUTSIDE   RELINQUISHES HIS BRIDE 
 AAAA 

166
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,200
 THEY STAND HIM UP AGAINST THE
 WALL AND TAKE AWAY HIS BRIDE 

167
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,500
YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
AT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

168
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,900
 GOOD HEAVENS !
YOU CAN'T GO WITH YOUR TROUSERS UP !

169
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,000
 I CAN'T, EH ?
THEY'LL NEVER CATCH ME ANY OTHER WAY.

170
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,500
MY CAR !
HIS EXCELLENCY'S CAR !

171
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,100
- HIS EXCELLENCY'S CAR.
-  [ Fanfare ]

172
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
- HIS EXCELLENCY'S CAR.
-  [ Fanfare ]

173
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,900
 I'M IN A HURRY.
IF YOU RUN OUT OF GAS, GET ETHYL.

174
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
IF ETHYL RUNS OUT, GET MABEL.
NOW STEP ON IT.

175
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,900
IT CERTAINLY FEELS GOOD
TO BE BACK AGAIN.

176
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,200
  I HAVE FAILED,  AMBASSADOR.
I KNOW IT, YOU IDIOT !

177
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,700
 I'M SORRY.
YOU HAVE MUDDLED EVERYTHING.

178
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
IF YOU'D STARTED THE REVOLUTION
AS I PLANNED...

179
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,600
 I COULD'VE STEPPED IN
AND PLACED FREEDONIA UNDER THE SYLVANIAN FLAG.

180
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,800
BUT FIREFLY BLOCKED US !

181
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,300
  YOU HAVE NO IDEA  HOW POPULAR HE IS.
I'VE KNOWN OF THAT TOO.

182
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TWO SPIES
SHADOWING HIM.

183
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
I WANT TO FIND OUT SOMETHING
TO DISGRACE HIM.

184
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
TO DISCREDIT HIM
WITH THE PEOPLE.

185
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,700
AMBASSADOR, CHICOLINI
AND PINKY ARE HERE.

186
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,500
 THESE ARE MY SPIES.
SHOW THEM IN. WAIT OUTSIDE.

187
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,600
WE FOOL YOU GOOD,
EH ?

188
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,000

GENTLEMEN,

192
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,900
 SHH ! THIS IS SPY STUFF.

193
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,400
[ Ringing ]

194
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,900
 TELEGRAM FOR YOU, SIR.
OH.

195
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,700
 HE GETS MAD BECAUSE HE CAN'T READ.
OH, I SEE.

196
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,700
GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE
SERIOUS MATTERS TO DISCUSS.

197
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,000
 PLEASE BE SEATED.
 ROCK-A-BYE 

198
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,300
GENTLEMEN, ABOUT
THAT INFORMATION --

199
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,500
WAIT, HERE, HAVE A CIGAR.
THAT'S A GOOD QUARTER CIGAR.

200
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,200
 I SMOKED THE OTHER THREE QUARTERS MYSELF.
NO, THANK YOU.

201
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,700
HERE, TRY
ONE OF THESE.

202
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,300
HERE,
THAT'S-A NO GOOD.

203
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,400
THAT'S-A GOOD !
 THAT'S-A FINE.

204
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,800
THAT'S-A GOOD.

205
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,900
LET'S CONCENTRATE.

206
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,300
HAVE YOU BEEN
TRAILING FIREFLY ?

207
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,900
 HA-HA !
HAVE WE BEEN TRAILING FIREFLY !

208
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,200
 MY PARTNER HERE'S GOT A NOSE JUST LIKE A BLOODHOUND.
REALLY ?

209
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,500
AND THE REST OF HIS FACE
DON'T LOOK SO GOOD EITHER.

210
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,100
WE FIND OUT ALL ABOUT
THIS FIREFLY.

211
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,100
 LOOK AT THIS.
AH, VERY GOOD !

212
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,400
WAIT.  WE MUST NOT
BE DISTURBED.

213
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,800
 YES, SIR ?
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONFERENCE.

214
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
 I DO NOT WISH TO BE INTERRUPTED.
YES, SIR.

215
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,400
[ Chicolini ]
UH-UH, UH-UH !

216
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,300
GENTLEMEN, WE ARE NOT
GETTING ANYWHERE.

217
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,200
YOU'RE OUT !

218
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,500
AH-AH-AH-AH-AH !
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE !

219
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,800
WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU
FOUND OUT ABOUT FIREFLY ?

220
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,500
 REMEMBER YOU GAVE US A PICTURE AND SAID "FOLLOW HIM" ?
OH YES.

221
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,200
WE GET ON THE JOB
RIGHT AWAY.

222
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
 IN ONE HOUR, LESS THAN ONE HOUR,
YES ?

223
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,600
WE LOSE-A THE PICTCH.
THAT'S-A PRETTY QUICK WORK.

224
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,300
 I ASKED YOU TO DIG UP
SOMETHING I CAN USE AGAINST FIREFLY.

225
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,600
DID YOU BRING ME
HIS RECORD ?

226
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,700
NO, NO !

227
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,600
 [ Gunshot ]

228
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,100
AND THE BOY
GETS-A CIGAR.

229
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,500
 CHICOLINI, I WANT
A DETAILED REPORT OF YOUR INVESTIGATION.

230
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,700
 MONDAY, WE WATCH
FIREFLY'S HOUSE, BUT HE NO COME OUT.

231
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,000
HE WASN'T HOME.

232
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,300
 TUESDAY, WE GO TO THE BALL GAME,
BUT HE FOOL US. HE NO SHOW UP.

233
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,700
 WEDNESDAY, HE GO TO THE
BALL GAME, BUT WE FOOL HIM ! WE NO SHOW UP.

234
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,200
THURSDAY WAS A DOUBLEHEADER,
NOBODY SHOW UP.

235
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,800
 FRIDAY, IT RAINED ALL DAY.
THERE WAS NO BALL GAME. WE LISTENED OVER THE RADIO.

236
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,800
 YOU DIDN'T SHADOW FIREFLY !
WE SHADOW HIM ALL DAY.

237
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,500
 WHAT DAY WAS THAT ?
"SHADDERDAY" !

238
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,800
THAT'S-A SOME JOKE,
HUH, BOSS ?

239
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,600
 WILL YOU TELL ME, WHAT HAPPENED SATURDAY ?
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED ME.

240
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,700
WE FOLLOW THIS MAN
TO A ROAD HOUSE.

241
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,100
 HE MEET A MARRIED LADY.
A MARRIED LADY ?

242
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,300
 YEAH, I THINK IT WAS HIS WIFE.
FIREFLY HAS NO WIFE !

243
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,700
 NO ?
NO !

244
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,000
 YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ?
I THINK WE FOLLOWED THE WRONG MAN.

245
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,800
OH, GENTLEMEN,
I AM DISAPPOINTED.

246
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,700
 I ENTRUSTED YOU WITH A
MISSION OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AND YOU FAILED.

247
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,100
HOWEVER, I AM GOING TO
GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE.

248
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,200
 I HAVE CREDENTIALS
THAT WILL GET YOU INTO ANY PLACE IN FREEDONIA.

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,800
IF I CAN ONLY --
AH, HERE WE ARE.

250
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,800
ARE YOU SURE THAT
YOU CAN TRAP FIREFLY ?

251
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,400
REMEMBER,
THIS TIME I EXPECT RESULTS.

252
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
 GOOD-BYE AND GOOD LUCK.
OKAY, CAP.

253
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,500
  COME ON, PINKY.
GOOD-BYE.

254
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,900
ALL RIGHT, THE
MEETING'S CALLED TO ORDER.

255
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,700
 YOUR EXCELLENCY,
HERE'S THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT'S REPORT.

256
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,900
I HOPE YOU'LL
FIND IT CLEAR.

257
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,300
 CLEAR ?  WHY A
FOUR-YEAR-OLD CHILD COULD UNDERSTAND THIS REPORT.

258
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,200
 FIND ME A FOUR-YEAR-OLD
CHILD.  I CAN'T MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OUT OF IT.

259
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,800
MEMBERS OF THE CABINET,
WE'LL TAKE UP OLD BUSINESS.

260
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,100
 I WISH TO DISCUSS THE TARIFF.
SIT DOWN, THAT'S NEW BUSINESS.

261
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,300
 NO OLD BUSINESS ?
VERY WELL, WE'LL TAKE UP NEW BUSINESS.

262
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,400
 ABOUT THAT TARIFF.
TOO LATE ! THAT'S OLD BUSINESS ALREADY.

263
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
 AS YOUR SECRETARY OF WAR --
OUT OF ORDER !

264
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,300
 WHICH REMINDS ME,
SO IS THE PLUMBING. MAKE A NOTE OF THAT.

265
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,600
NEVER MIND,
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

266
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
WISHES TO REPORT...

267
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,600
THAT THE WORKERS OF FREEDONIA
ARE DEMANDING SHORTER HOURS.

268
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,600
 WE'LL GIVE THEM SHORTER
HOURS BY CUTTING THEIR LUNCH HOUR TO 20 MINUTES.

269
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,500
 GENTLEMEN, WE'VE
GOT TO START LOOKING FOR A NEW TREASURER.

270
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,800
 YOU APPOINTED ONE LAST WEEK !
THAT'S THE ONE I'M LOOKING FOR.

271
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,900
 GENTLEMEN, ENOUGH.
HOW ABOUT TAKING UP THE TAX ?

272
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,800
-HOW ABOUT TAKING UP THE CARPET?
-WE MUST TAKE UP THE TAX !

273
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,300
 YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE UP
THE TAX BEFORE YOU CAN TAKE UP THE CARPET.

274
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
I GIVE MY TIME TO MY DUTIES
AND WHAT DO I GET ?

275
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,900
- YOU GET AWFULLY TIRESOME.
- SIR, YOU TRY MY PATIENCE.

276
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,700
YOU MUST COME OVER
AND TRY MINE SOME TIME.

277
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,300
 THAT'S THE LAST STRAW !
I RESIGN.  I WASH MY HANDS OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS.

278
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,900
YOU CAN WASH
YOUR NECK TOO.

279
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,700
PEANUTS !

280
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,100
HEY, COME HERE !

281
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,500
JUST THE GUY
I WANNA SEE.

282
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,200
WHAT DO YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT FIREFLY ?

283
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,800
YOU FIND OUT-A SOMETHING ?
 YOU NO FIND OUT-A SOMETHING ?

284
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,100
YOU SPY ON HIM ?
 YOU NO SPY ON HIM ?

285
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,600
 WHAT'S-A MATTER ?
ALL THE TIME I TALK, YOU NO SAY-A NOTHING.

286
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,100
WHAT'S-A MATTER
YOU NO SPEAK ?

287
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,700
STOP-A THIS !

288
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,800
THAT'S-A NO GOOD !

289
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
HEY, COME HERE.
WHAT YOU MAKE A FACE FOR ?

290
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,100
COME ON,

291
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,700
COME ON,

00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,500
YOUR EXCELLENCY, I REALLY
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

439

 I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
IF I WAS IN YOUR PLACE. MAYBE YOU CAN SUGGEST SOMETHING.

WHAT ?

 I'M SORRY I SAID THAT.
IT ISN'T FAIR TO THE REST OF THE BABOONS.

IS INEXCUSABLE !

I DID NOT COME HERE TO BE INSULTED.

 YOU SWINE !
COME AGAIN ?

CALL A FIREFLY AN UPSTART.

OF FIREFLYS... AND A FEW HORSEFLIES TOO.

NOT IF HIS EXCELLENCY WILL LISTEN TO REASON.

MY PRIDE AND FORGET THE MATTER... IF HE IS.

 THAT'S WONDERFUL BUT
I'M AFRAID HIS EXCELLENCY WON'T HEAR OF IT.

LISTEN TO YOU !

I CAN'T TELL IT TO YOU OVER THE PHONE.

MARRIED THE ARMSTRONGS AND THAT'S WHY DARKIES WERE BORN.
