1
00:00:00,188 --> 00:00:01,568
So here's what you missed
on <i>Glee</i>...

2
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:03,185
<i>Mr. Shue's in Washington,</i>

3
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:04,854
<i>so now Finn's in charge</i>
<i>of the glee club, and they have</i>

4
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:06,285
<i>to win Sectionals,</i>
<i>which is just a week away.</i>

5
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:08,576
<i>Blaine cheated on Kurt, and</i>
<i>he's super broken up about it,</i>

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,977
<i>and Kurt's the whole reason</i>
<i>Blaine came to McKinley,</i>

7
00:00:09,995 --> 00:00:11,412
<i>and now he's gone</i>
<i>and Blaine's all alone.</i>

8
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:13,364
<i>Jake saw Ryder and Marley kiss,</i>
<i>and even though</i>

9
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:15,199
<i>she's super skinny</i>
<i>and super beautiful,</i>

10
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,951
<i>Kitty's got Marley convinced</i>
<i>that she's gaining weight.</i>

11
00:00:16,985 --> 00:00:18,953
The stage always adds
at least ten pounds.

12
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:20,337
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

13
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:26,326
The Secret Society
of Superheroes Club

14
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:27,661
is now in session.

15
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,597
It is the purpose of this club
to fight injustice,

16
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:30,998
to right
all that which is wrong,

17
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:32,666
and to preserve truth,
justice and peace

18
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:34,001
in the halls of McKinley High.

19
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,669
First order of business...
roll call.

20
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:36,670
Go.

21
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:38,005
Asian Persuasion here.

22
00:00:38,023 --> 00:00:40,941
My superpower is being
the mistress of manipulation.

23
00:00:40,976 --> 00:00:42,175
(à la George W. Bush):
Blond Chameleon here.

24
00:00:42,194 --> 00:00:43,677
My superpower is
I can impersonate anybody.

25
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:45,679
George W. Bush, heh.

26
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:46,814
Tarantula Head here.

27
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,348
My superpower is lashing you
with my dreads.

28
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:49,349
(whip cracks)

29
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:51,184
Sweet 'n' Spicy, here.

30
00:00:51,203 --> 00:00:53,320
My superpower is money.

31
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:54,655
Second order of business...

32
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,790
inducting new members
into our ever-swelling ranks.

33
00:00:56,825 --> 00:00:59,359
Candidates, come forth.

34
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:00,794
Excited to be here, Blaine.

35
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,463
First of all, there are no

36
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:04,798
civilian identities
in here, okay?

37
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,501
I am Nightbird
the Nocturnal Avenger.

38
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:09,036
And second of all, I really
hope you're not trying

39
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:10,971
to pass yourself off
as a certain telepathic leader

40
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:12,372
of a certain group
of superhuman mutants

41
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,341
because that would be
a copyright violation.

42
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,927
Uh, I'm Dr. Y

43
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:20,213
and my superpower is wheelies?

44
00:01:20,232 --> 00:01:22,049
Welcome, Dr. Y.
Next.

45
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:25,385
I'm Queen Bee
and I can sting like a bitch.

46
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:26,386
(buzzes)

47
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:28,188
Welcome, Queen Bee.
Next.

48
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:29,406
I'm the Human Brain.

49
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,326
Welcome, Human Brain.

50
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,444
(phone chimes)

51
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:34,561
What's this?

52
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:36,330
A text just came through
on my NightPhone.

53
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:38,165
"Have you talked to Kurt?"

54
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,700
I already told you,

55
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:41,335
Asian Persuasion,

56
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,403
this account is only supposed
to be for emergencies,

57
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:45,039
and you cannot use
your powers of manipulation

58
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:46,073
to coax me into getting

59
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:48,408
back with my ex, so stop trying.

60
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,512
What is it, Chai Tea?

61
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:53,013
Emergency in the choir room.

62
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:54,098
To the choir room.

63
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:09,146
Someone took
your Nationals trophy

64
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:11,264
and left that laptop
in its place.

65
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:12,399
ARTIE:
Who leaves a laptop?

66
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,267
Someone rich,

67
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:15,936
someone who wanted
to send us a message.

68
00:02:15,954 --> 00:02:17,738
I got this.

69
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:23,260
(distorted):
Greetings, New Directions!

70
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:27,781
You have been living as national
champions on borrowed time,

71
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,617
and that ends now.

72
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,419
We have your trophy.

73
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:33,754
Soon we'll have your title

74
00:02:33,788 --> 00:02:34,788
as well.

75
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:37,057
The great reckoning is at hand...

76
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:38,892
Sectionals.

77
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:40,961
Your move.

78
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,497
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>

79
00:02:45,617 --> 00:02:47,134
(school bell ringing)

80
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:54,108
So, are you jumping
on this superhero bandwagon?

81
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:57,361
A club where you have
to wear full-body spandex?

82
00:02:57,412 --> 00:02:58,946
Not really my thing.

83
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,147
Good, that means you'll be free

84
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:03,450
to hang out Friday night...
you and me.

85
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:04,651
What do you say?

86
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:06,754
Um... I...

87
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:07,755
RYDER:
Marley's got

88
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:09,089
plans on Friday, dude.

89
00:03:09,124 --> 00:03:11,324
The football team's
got an away game

90
00:03:11,343 --> 00:03:13,127
at Lawrence, and I asked her
if she'd come cheer us on.

91
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:14,628
See, Jake, it's funny.

92
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,096
Girls don't like it
when you make it seem

93
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:17,598
like you're really into them

94
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,632
and then totally blow them off.

95
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,334
You know what, dude?

96
00:03:21,353 --> 00:03:23,170
I don't remember asking
for your opinion.

97
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:24,838
Guys, don't do this.
Whoa.

98
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:26,106
Whoa, you're
really intimidating.

99
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,441
Let me ask you
a question... what kind

100
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:28,842
of a name is Ryder Lynn
anyway? 'Cause it sounds

101
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,010
like your parents named you
after a cowgirl doll

102
00:03:30,028 --> 00:03:32,345
who comes with her own pony.

103
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:34,314
Look, man, I don't
want any trouble.

104
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,150
I know you're a badass.
You want to know how I know

105
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:38,351
you're such a badass? Because
you ride a Razor scooter.

106
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,688
Nothing says "I'm a badass"
like a Razor scooter.

107
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:43,624
Guys, please, don't do this.

108
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:46,026
It... this is...
this is stupid. Stop.

109
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:47,828
Hey, hey, cut it out.

110
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:49,196
Stop. Come on, stop, stop it.

111
00:03:49,214 --> 00:03:50,530
Stop. Cut it out.
Come on.

112
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:53,133
I persuade you
to stop fighting immediately.

113
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:54,534
Freeze, bitches.

114
00:03:54,552 --> 00:03:55,535
FINN:
Thanks, Becky,

115
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:57,537
both you guys.

116
00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:59,372
Glee Club, 20 minutes.

117
00:03:59,391 --> 00:04:01,374
(school bell ringing)

118
00:04:01,393 --> 00:04:03,394
(indistinct chatter)

119
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:08,849
(laughter)

120
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:11,384
Okay, guys, sit down. We got
a lot of work to do today.

121
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:12,686
(indistinct chatter)

122
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,405
No, seriously, come on,
I mean it, sit down.

123
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,725
Okay, so the first
order of business today

124
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:20,661
is to welcome the newest members
to the glee club...

125
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:23,163
Ryder and Kitty.
(cheering and applause)

126
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:25,532
Wait, don't we all get
to vote on her or something?

127
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,068
Well, Tina,
Kitty was fantastic in <i>Grease.</i>

128
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:29,569
In spite of my god-awful part.

129
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:31,171
Besides, we're under the gun.

130
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:32,673
We... we have to go
to Sectionals next week

131
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:34,541
and we need 12 members
to compete.

132
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:35,909
Oh, well, then,
just call Santana back

133
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:37,845
from Kentucky again
'cause apparently she's better

134
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,179
than anyone who's actually
enrolled here.

135
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:40,413
Look, Tina, not now.

136
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:41,748
Uh, look, where was I?

137
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:43,583
Sectionals, yes.

138
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,102
Here's the game plan.

139
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:49,089
Broke the marker.

140
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:51,775
Where does Mr. Shue keep
the other markers?

141
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:54,695
Uh...

142
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,899
Screw it. Uh...

143
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:04,371
The theme is "Foreigner."

144
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:08,041
We're gonna sing songs by
Foreigner in foreign languages,

145
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:10,711
wearing all the costumes
of the world's nations.

146
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:15,582
Wait, seriously,
that's your idea?

147
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:16,583
Yeah.

148
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,418
Kiki, what do you think?

149
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,254
FEMALE VOICE: I think I'm
alive and you're the machine.

150
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:22,455
BLAINE:
Finn, times have changed.

151
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:24,057
We're national champions
now, which means

152
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:26,393
we have to exceed all
expectations, so if that's

153
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:30,964
your best idea, I... I don't
think we stand a chance.

154
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:32,799
Wait, where are you going?

155
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:36,303
I'm going to get our trophy back
from the Warblers...

156
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:38,638
the one you haven't even noticed
is missing.

157
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,442
Crap, uh...

158
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:45,412
<i>So, who exactly</i>
<i>are you supposed to be?</i>

159
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,447
I'm the Beiste Master.

160
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,481
Blaine said

161
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,983
I couldn't be faculty advisor

162
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,318
unless I dressed up once a week,

163
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:53,486
so I'm from
the planet Testostergen,

164
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:54,755
I can digest any
known substance

165
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:57,124
and cry at the drop of a hat,

166
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:58,792
and, hey, I'm not kidding
about that last part.

167
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,428
Last night I teared up
at an Activia commercial.

168
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:02,429
(chuckles)

169
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:03,997
This is just all so ridiculous.

170
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:06,266
Oh, come on, pumpkin,
this is fun.

171
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:07,634
Yeah, it's no wonder
superheroes

172
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:08,969
are all the rage.

173
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:10,888
Putting on a mask
is like getting up onstage.

174
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,339
It gives you the freedom to be

175
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:14,674
the person
you secretly aspire to be,

176
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:17,978
and if you ask me, the world
could use a few more heroes.

177
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:19,530
(school bell ringing)
So, what's bugging you, kiddo?

178
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:20,697
You seem blue.

179
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:22,349
It was my first lesson
in Glee Club today,

180
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:23,617
and it was a total disaster.

181
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:25,852
What happened?
I don't know.

182
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,020
I mean, the lesson
that I planned

183
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:28,021
was awesome.

184
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:29,323
I... I think
it's just that the...

185
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:31,358
the glee club doesn't see me
as an adult.

186
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:33,994
(groans)

187
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:35,462
God, is that
what coffee tastes like?

188
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:36,863
How do people drink that?

189
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:38,081
I'm just spitballing here,

190
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,033
but maybe you should invest
in a pair of tights.

191
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:42,002
You know, Clark Kent
was an awesome guy,

192
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:45,372
but it was Superman
who inspired everyone.

193
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,474
Be their hero, Finn.

194
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,509
I'm just saying.

195
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:54,698
(bell clanging)

196
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,819
Sebastian.

197
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,220
Of course it was you.

198
00:07:00,238 --> 00:07:02,689
No, it wasn't, I swear.

199
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,942
I turned over a new leaf,
remember?

200
00:07:04,993 --> 00:07:08,028
No more bullying, blackmail
or assault this year.

201
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:09,830
That must be boring for you.

202
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:13,083
Yeah, it is;
Being nice sucks.

203
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:16,569
He's waiting for you
in the library.

204
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:18,071
Who is?

205
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,374
The guy you're here to see.

206
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:21,574
Captain of the Warblers.

207
00:07:21,593 --> 00:07:24,678
I thought you were captain
of the Warblers.

208
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:35,088
I knew they'd send you.

209
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:38,091
Allow me to answer
the obvious questions.

210
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:41,862
I'm Hunter Clarington, I am
the new captain of the Warblers,

211
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,697
and I'm not even
remotely bi-curious.

212
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,065
How are you captain
of the Warblers when...?

213
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:46,933
When you've never
seen me before?

214
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:49,486
Simple.

215
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:51,204
Dalton just gave me
a full scholarship

216
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:53,106
to move here
from Colorado Springs,

217
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,192
where I led
my military academy choir

218
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:56,776
to a Regionals victory

219
00:07:56,794 --> 00:07:58,996
with presidential honors.

220
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:01,882
Now I'm here to kick it up a
notch, and that starts with you.

221
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,083
That's very intimidating.

222
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:04,451
Where's the trophy, Hunter?

223
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,336
(chuckles)

224
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:07,971
Don't worry, it's safe.

225
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,059
It was just bait after all.

226
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:13,560
See, you're kind of

227
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,728
a legend here.

228
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:15,896
I like that.

229
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,230
So here's my offer:

230
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:18,682
Your little diversity club

231
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,934
can have its
Nationals trophy back

232
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,402
when you rejoin the Warblers.

233
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:25,272
And why would
I ever leave McKinley?

234
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:26,406
Why would you stay?

235
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:28,275
I heard you only went there
to be with Kurt,

236
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:29,409
right?

237
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:30,444
In fact,

238
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,948
I hear they even call you
Blaine Warbler.

239
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,950
They know you don't
belong there,

240
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,802
so why don't you?
SEBASTIAN: We all know

241
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:41,254
the real Blaine, Blaine...

242
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:44,157
ambitious, driven.

243
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:45,492
You're a Dalton boy.

244
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,660
Present the blazer.

245
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:52,099
That's not going to work on me.
Then why be afraid

246
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,350
to try it on?

247
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:05,678
Here's the thing, Blaine.

248
00:09:05,697 --> 00:09:08,315
You know that Nationals
trophy was a fluke,

249
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:12,319
just like you know we're
going to win at Sectionals.

250
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:16,123
Now, I don't want to see
a Dalton legend like you

251
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:19,025
sidelined in his senior year.

252
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,996
I want you on the winning side,

253
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,082
here with us.

254
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:27,968
You know what goes great
with a new Dalton blazer?

255
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,702
An impromptu song.

256
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:32,305
What? No, no. Oh, come on, one
song for your old buddies.

257
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,207
Guys, I didn't come here
to sing a song.

258
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:36,893

SEBASTIAN:
What'd I tell you?

301
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:57,484
Flawless.

302
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,454
Keep it.

303
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:03,290
It's already yours.

304
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:05,959
Don't you think it's time you
came back where you belong...

305
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,377
Blaine Warbler?

306
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:14,638
(school bell rings)

307
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:16,307
Okay.

308
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:18,809
Oh, dear God.

309
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:21,312
So, I-I get it...
my first idea was pretty bad.

310
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,147
Worse than funk. Worse
than "Night of Neglect."

311
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:26,317
So... I decided to try
something new... "Dynamic..."

312
00:12:26,335 --> 00:12:27,484
Duets."

313
00:12:27,502 --> 00:12:29,437
This is gonna be
a lot more fun,

314
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:31,956
and it focuses on something
you guys actually like:

315
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,657
Superheroes. MARLEY:
Oh, so wait...

316
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:35,452
are we all gonna
have to wear costumes?

317
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:37,971
ARTIE: And who exactly
are you supposed to be?

318
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:39,306
The Bulge, who makes
gym socks disappear?

319
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,308
BRITTANY: Please don't melt us
with your bulge.

320
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:43,744
Well, I am...
the almighty Treble Clef,

321
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,279
Uniter of Glee Clubs.

322
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:47,581
KITTY: Jesus is the only
real almighty superhero.

323
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:49,149
Amen.
Nobody asked you.

324
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,484
Come on, guys,

325
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:51,919
let's hear him out.
Thanks.

326
00:12:51,953 --> 00:12:53,487
(Finn sighs)

327
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:54,955
Look at the Avengers.

328
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:57,491
Individually, they all have
amazing powers, but...

329
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,326
as a team,
they cannot be stopped.

330
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:00,795
Right now, we're a
bunch of individuals

331
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:03,997
with great powers and talents,
but... we're not a team.

332
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:05,266
Some of you even have

333
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,834
mortal enemies
in this very room,

334
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,836
allowing the Dark Side

335
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,437
to turn us against
each other, when we

336
00:13:10,472 --> 00:13:11,605
should be focused
on the Warblers.

337
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,340
Nightbird is handling
the missing trophy.

338
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:15,142
Great. Thank you, Nightbird.

339
00:13:15,176 --> 00:13:17,144
Jake will pair up with Ryder,

340
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:19,480
Marley will join Kitty
to perform the duets.

341
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:20,481
The rest of you,

342
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:22,015
start preparing to fight

343
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:24,985
an epic battle against the
forces of evil at Sectionals.

344
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,955
(cheering, whooping)

345
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:29,523
That idea was slightly better.

346
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,958
Still could be horrible.

347
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:32,693
(fanfare plays)

348
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,329
(school bell rings)

349
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:37,197
Here's the only thing you need to study.
Isn't part

350
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:39,466
of the assignment that we
have to pick a song together?

351
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:40,835
The assignment is
"Dynamic Duets."

352
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:42,002
I took the liberty of choosing

353
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:44,138
a song to show off
my vocal bombasity while

354
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:46,173
at the same time highlighting
your mousy softness.

355
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:47,758
Well, can we at least talk about

356
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:49,042
which superheroes
we're gonna be?

357
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,811
You can talk all you want,
but I already decided.

358
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:54,148
I'm Femme Fatale... 'cause in
French, that means: "Kill Women."

359
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:55,316
No, it doesn't.
Which is what

360
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,568
I'm going to do
when we perform.

361
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:01,722
Okay.

362
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,357
Let's be honest,
I don't like you,

363
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:04,892
you don't like me,
and dressing up

364
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,861
in a cape and tights...
not gonna change that.

365
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:09,663
Fine. Don't do it, and get
booted out of Glee Club.

366
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:11,532
Mega Stud won't complain.

367
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:13,667
Hold-hold on.
Did you seriously

368
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:15,669
just call yourself "Mega Stud"?

369
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:18,873
It's my alter ego. So your
superhero choice is to be me?

370
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:21,742
There can be only one.

371
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,677
♪

372
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:30,083

00:15:22,237 --> 00:15:24,638

FINN: Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing! Hey!

400
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:44,825
Stop it!

401
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,628
(screaming, shouting)

402
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:48,495
Finn, do something!

403
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:51,665
FINN:
Uh... Hey! Hey!

404
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:54,802
Hey, hey, what's wrong
with you guys?

405
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:57,471
SAM:
Full nelson, full nelson.

406
00:15:57,505 --> 00:15:59,506
You're not too
tough now, are you?

407
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:01,508
My goal was
to bring you two together,

408
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:03,444
not to have you dress up and...

409
00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:05,312
karate-chop each other
in the face!

410
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:07,014
It was a lame exercise.

411
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,650
No, you know what's lame?
Not winning at Sectionals.

412
00:16:09,684 --> 00:16:12,619
And if we don't get our act
together, we're gonna lose,

413
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:13,821
and then that's gonna be it.

414
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:15,355
I need you two to get along.

415
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:17,458
I heard you, Finn,
but I don't like this guy.

416
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:19,460
He's working his way through
every girl at this school,

417
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:21,028
and I think Marley deserves better.
You have

418
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,362
no idea what Marley wants,

419
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,630
or deserves. FINN: Enough!

420
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:25,165
Okay? Enough.
Clearly, you did not

421
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,533
take anything
from my last assignment,

422
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:28,302
so I'm gonna give you a new one.

423
00:16:28,336 --> 00:16:29,386
Will it also be lame?

424
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,972
Ignoring you. It's
a "Kryptonite Lesson."

425
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:33,474
You two think
you hate each other.

426
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:35,175
I think you don't
understand each other.

427
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:36,643
So I want you to sit

428
00:16:36,678 --> 00:16:38,879
in a room and tell each other
your deepest fears.

429
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,047
Only by

430
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,214
admitting your weaknesses

431
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:42,716
can you realize your strengths.

432
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:44,318
You sound like Yoda, dude.

433
00:16:44,352 --> 00:16:46,219
Deal do we have?

434
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:50,724
(fanfare plays)

435
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,576
(school bell rings)

436
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,732
Hey. You got a minute?
Yeah.

437
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,035
Dude, I was just gonna text you.
How is Operation:

438
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:02,569
Rescue/Recovery going?
Well, when

439
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:04,505
I went back to Dalton,
all those blazers

440
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:05,906
and singing with
the Warblers again...

441
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,742
Wait, wait, what, you
sang with the Warblers?

442
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,178
It just sort of happened.
But they embraced me

443
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:12,846
like I was a long-lost brother.

444
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:14,081
It was like

445
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,749
in <i>X-Men 2,</i>
when Pyro left the X-Men

446
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:16,884
to join Magneto's Brotherhood.

447
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:18,852
It-it just felt right,

448
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:20,437
like maybe...

449
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:23,223
...I belong with the Warblers.
Dude,

450
00:17:23,257 --> 00:17:27,394
no, no, you belong
here, with us, okay?

451
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:29,262
Does this have to do with Kurt?

452
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,565
Everything in this room
reminds me of him.

453
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,867
We were...
a dynamic duo in here.

454
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:35,769
Kurt was my anchor, Finn,

455
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:37,270
and now that he's
gone, I just...

456
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:39,439
I feel like I'm floating.

457
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:41,041
And you, you need a team

458
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:42,910
that's gonna gel.
Yes. Absolutely.

459
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:45,212
We need a team
with a lot of gel.

460
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:48,048
And... you're, like,
the biggest part of that.

461
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,618
I'm sorry, Finn, but the
Warblers are my birthright...

462
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:53,554
and my destiny.

463
00:18:00,968 --> 00:18:04,540
(school bell rings)

464
00:18:04,574 --> 00:18:06,659
I can't do a duet with you.
Because my singing voice

465
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:08,294
is crystal-clear
and you sort of sound like

466
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:10,713
you've got a snot bubble stuck
in the back of your throat?

467
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:12,531
What? No.

468
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,199
I don't think that... that's just
what everyone's saying.

469
00:18:14,217 --> 00:18:17,219
Look... the reason
I can't do the duet

470
00:18:17,254 --> 00:18:19,037
is because of the costume.

471
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:20,872
I can't wear a
head-to-toe body suit

472
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,174
made out of clingy fabric.

473
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,392
I'm too self-conscious.

474
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:24,876
I'm gonna ask you a question,

475
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,062
and I want you
to answer me honestly.

476
00:18:27,097 --> 00:18:30,716
Are you still driving
the bus to Puketown?

477
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,234
What?
You know.

478
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:33,903
Are you still giving yourself

479
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:37,239
self-inflicted
barf-wounds to the uvula?

480
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:38,908
I've done it
every day this week.

481
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:40,859
You know, you and I
are a lot alike.

482
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:43,862
I think that's why I was so
mean to you when we first met.

483
00:18:43,896 --> 00:18:46,081
I've had body-image issues,
too, but my good friends,

484
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:48,417
the finger sisters,
Pointy and Birdie,

485
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:51,587
helped me keep the trim figure
I retain to this day.

486
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:53,255
Sweetie...

487
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,374
you have to trust me
on this... we'll try on

488
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:57,259
our costumes, and I swear,
if you look fat

489
00:18:57,294 --> 00:18:58,594
even a little bit,
I'll be honest,

490
00:18:58,628 --> 00:19:00,095
and we'll cancel
the performance, okay?

491
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,247
Okay.

492
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:04,717
Promise?
Promise.

493
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:11,440
(fanfare plays)

494
00:19:11,474 --> 00:19:16,762
When Gotham is ashes, then
you have my permission to die.

495
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,614
Good to know, Bane.
Is that a jockstrap?

496
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:20,449
Let the games begin!

497
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:29,941
What's this? What Finn
wanted us to talk about.

498
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,294
My Kryptonite.

499
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:35,914
Don't just hand me some
lame note... be a man,

500
00:19:35,948 --> 00:19:38,283
tell me face-to-face.

501
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:41,754
My whole life,
I've never felt like I fit in.

502
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:43,455
Not anywhere.

503
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,623
Why?

504
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,792
I'm half white,
half black, half Jewish.

505
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,926
And just in case

506
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,094
I forget...

507
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:51,480
someone always reminds me.

508
00:19:51,514 --> 00:19:53,965
Brah, I got
a really good black joke,

509
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,485
and since you're half black,
you can half listen.

510
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,987
(laughing)

511
00:19:58,021 --> 00:20:00,489
Hey! Baruch Obamastein!

512
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:02,825
What are you exactly?
You a Oreo,

513
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:05,494
or a lightly toasted cracker?

514
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:06,829
Shalom!

515
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:09,198
So, what's <i>your</i> Kryptonite?

516
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,651
You know what, forget it.

517
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,170
This whole thing was stupid.

518
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:17,289
JAKE:
Dude, you just told me to be

519
00:20:17,323 --> 00:20:19,124
a man, so are you
gonna be a man,

520
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:21,493
or are you just
gonna walk away?

521
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:26,131
I made you tell me
what your note said,

522
00:20:26,165 --> 00:20:28,333
'cause I couldn't read it.

523
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:34,189
(school bell rings)

524
00:20:34,224 --> 00:20:37,643
Meow. Well, I don't know
about you, but this kitty cat's

525
00:20:37,677 --> 00:20:39,478
feeling so much yummier
now that she's

526
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:42,865
slipped into her tightest outfit
as Femme Fatale.

527
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:44,850
I'm waiting.

528
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,286
MARLEY:
I can't. I look ridiculous.

529
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,072
I'm sure that's not true.
Come on, I won't judge.

530
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:55,711
Uncross your arms.

531
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:59,531
I don't get it. What's WF? It's
supposed to be Wallflower.

532
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,133
Wallflower?
Your alter ego's

533
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,218
supposed to reflect how you
feel about yourself, right?

534
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:04,369
When I looked in the mirror,

535
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:05,721
this is what I saw.

536
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:07,556
Well, get over here,
so Femme Fatale

537
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,374
can tell you what <i>she</i> sees.

538
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:11,209
Stand up straight.
Shoulders back.

539
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:13,312
You look H-O-T-T, hot.

540
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:14,880
I do?
Now,

541
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,565
your clothes...
your mom made this, right,

542
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,383
like she does
most of your stuff?

543
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:20,069
Uh-huh. Well, bless her clogged,

544
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:22,488
overworked heart, but from now
on, I'm buying your clothes,

545
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:24,656
and they're gonna show off
your bitchin' bod.

546
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:26,075
But first things first.

547
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:29,060
Marley Rose, you are
Wallflower no more.

548
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,395
You are Woman Fierce,

549
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:33,999
and we are going
to kill this song.

550
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:35,734

FINN:
That was incredible.

583
00:23:23,726 --> 00:23:25,527
You worked so well together.

584
00:23:25,562 --> 00:23:27,529
Teamwork! Yeah!

585
00:23:27,564 --> 00:23:29,815
You guys, I don't smell
raspberry hair gel.

586
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:31,533
Does anybody know
where Blaine Warbler is?

587
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:34,019
Uh, well, as some of
you guys might know,

588
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,654
uh, recently, Blaine has been

589
00:23:35,688 --> 00:23:37,155
going through a bit
of a rough time...

590
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:39,524
Oh, boo-hoo. Get over it.
It's like a bad Lifetime movie.

591
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:43,378
...and he's decided to finish
the rest of his senior year

592
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:45,030
at Dalton Academy.

593
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,552
He's been taken
by the Dark Side.

(school bell ringing)

595
00:23:57,131 --> 00:23:57,844
Finn?

596
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,807
There's something
I need to tell you about Ryder.

597
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:05,005
(school bell ringing)

598
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:11,266
What's going on here?

599
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,401
I'm Mrs. Penkala.

600
00:24:12,435 --> 00:24:14,736
I'm the district
special education director.

601
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,955
And Finn brought you here
so I can help you, Ryder.

602
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,940
I don't need any help.

603
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,543
I've made it this far on my own.

604
00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:23,245
Jake should've
kept his mouth shut.

605
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,215
Dude, just-just
relax, okay?

606
00:24:26,249 --> 00:24:28,634
Don't you want to figure
out why you keep studying

607
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:30,135
but you don't do any better?

608
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,170
Just have a seat.

609
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:39,811
Well, I read your file.

610
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:41,480
And you'd be surprised
how often

611
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:44,299
bright kids like you
who are struggling don't have

612
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,484
any testing done.

613
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:47,019
Even with conscientious parents.

614
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:49,988
Don't be nervous.

615
00:24:50,023 --> 00:24:51,773
The great thing
about this test is

616
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:53,825
there are no right
or wrong answers.

617
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,745
I want you to say the numbers
in numerical order

618
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:58,480
and the letters
in alphabetical order.

619
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,332
Nine, one, T.

620
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,984
Seven, two, F, K.

621

Father.

622
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:09,174

623
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,959
Pretty.

624
00:25:10,993 --> 00:25:12,678
(timer ticking)

625
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:14,496
School.

626
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,298
Then.

627
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:18,467
Flowers.

628
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:20,335
I don't know what that says.

629
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:21,670
Try sounding it out.

630
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,055
I can't.

631
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,558
Fly.

632
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,534
I-I can't read that.

633
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:40,405
Uh, brown.

634
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:42,541
Is that even a word?

635
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:46,044
(timer continues ticking)

636
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,379
(bell dings)

637
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,381
Time's up.

638
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:55,203
I don't know why this
stuff is so hard for me.

639
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,222
Am I stupid?
No.

640
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:58,707
You're actually very smart.

641
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:01,593
(school bell ringing)

642
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:08,717
It's not a brain tumor, is it?
No.

643
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,104
Uh, I'm dyslexic.

644
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:16,391
You know, do you
know what it's like

645
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,226
to have a real secret identity?

646
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:21,246
Not like Clark Kent
or Peter Parker,

647
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,916
but to know inside you're not
who everyone thinks you are.

648
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:30,905
My whole life, it's been, "Ryder
just needs to apply himself."

649
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,708
"Ryder's smart; he just
needs to work harder,

650
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:35,744
focus, get it
together, man up."

651
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,600
But inside, man, I knew
they were all wrong.

652
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,935
It didn't matter
how hard I focused

653
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,104
or how hard I worked;
I was stupid.

654
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:49,474
And if anyone ever found that
out, if they knew the real me...

655
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,098
I was... I was sure it
would've killed my parents.

656
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,034
Man, and my dad's
a freaking PhD.

657
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:01,703
How is he gonna feel about
having an idiot for a son?

658
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:03,288
I'm sure your dad
loves you no matter what.

659
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:07,292
Dude, you learn to
read when you're six.

660
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,378
When you're six;
That's first grade.

661
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:10,945
Then they separate you
into these levels.

662
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,881
They don't tell you
that's what they're doing,

663
00:27:12,915 --> 00:27:14,616
but everyone knows
who's in the smart group

664
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,635
and who's in the dumb one.

665
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:20,288
You think a
six-year-old knows

666
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:23,308
his dad's gonna love
him no matter what?

667
00:27:26,962 --> 00:27:28,930
I've been carrying...

668
00:27:28,964 --> 00:27:30,399
I've been carrying
this secret around

669
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:31,933
my whole life, man,
all this time.

670
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:35,270
Now you can put it down.

671
00:27:35,304 --> 00:27:36,772
Okay?

672
00:27:36,806 --> 00:27:39,941
'Cause the only secret
is that your brain works

673
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:41,993
a little differently than
everyone else's, that's it.

674
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,829
Okay?

675
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:45,330
They're gonna start

676
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,949
an individualized
education program for me.

677
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:49,668
I'll start working
with a special teacher

678
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,703
every day next week.

679
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,425
Yeah, thank you.

680
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:58,460
Thank you for helping me, Finn.

681
00:27:58,494 --> 00:27:59,795
I owe you.

682
00:27:59,829 --> 00:28:02,831
Actually, you owe Jake.

683
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:08,989
(school bell ringing)

684
00:28:09,007 --> 00:28:10,591
Hey, Mrs. Rose.

685
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,126
Hey.

686
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,827
There is something
different about you.

687
00:28:14,256 --> 00:28:15,373
Is that a new hairnet?

688
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:18,009
(laughing):
No, it's the same one.

689
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:21,746
You know, tell you the truth,
I did lose a little weight.

690
00:28:21,764 --> 00:28:23,047
Six pounds this month.

691
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:25,416
Well, I knew it was something.

692
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:26,751
You look great.

693
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:28,186
Thanks, Jake.

694
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,054
Oh.

695
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:32,423
Marley would kill me
for telling you this,

696
00:28:32,441 --> 00:28:34,893
but she talks about
you all the time.

697
00:28:34,927 --> 00:28:38,696
You know, I had my chance...

698
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:40,365
and I blew it.

699
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,367
Well, it's never too late
to change. Look at me.

700
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:43,701
BOBBY:
Hey, Dump Truck,

701
00:28:43,736 --> 00:28:44,702
get back to work.

702
00:28:44,737 --> 00:28:46,604
What did you say to her?

703
00:28:46,622 --> 00:28:49,490
I believe he called her
a broken-down,

704
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:51,042
ten-ton crap-filled dump truck.

705
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:52,994
Oh, and your new name

706
00:28:53,045 --> 00:28:55,663
is officially Kosher Cappuccino.

707
00:28:55,714 --> 00:28:57,081
(laughs)

708
00:28:57,115 --> 00:28:59,450
You make this so easy when
there's only two of you.

709
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:01,753
Why don't you count
again, sweetheart.

710
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:02,921
It's payback time.

711
00:29:02,955 --> 00:29:04,055
RYDER:
Hey!

712
00:29:06,141 --> 00:29:07,225
Jake's my boy.

713
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:08,393
From now on, you mess with him,

714
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:09,594
you mess with me.

715
00:29:10,646 --> 00:29:11,963
And me.

716
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:13,982
And me.
And me, too.

717
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:20,738
Whatever.

718
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:22,273
Better stuff to do anyway.

719
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,530
What'd you do that for?

720
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:32,149
You had my back.

721
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:34,252
Now I've got yours.

722
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:51,269
Excuse me. Uh, which superhero
are you supposed to be?

723
00:29:51,303 --> 00:29:52,387
Kidding me? I'm the Puckerman!

724
00:29:52,438 --> 00:29:53,471
Can we take photo, please?

725
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:54,505
That'll be ten bucks.

726
00:29:54,523 --> 00:29:55,640
For 20, I'll clean your pool,

727
00:29:55,674 --> 00:29:57,275
and if you give me 100,
I'll give you

728
00:29:57,309 --> 00:29:58,943
the greatest night of your life.

729
00:29:58,978 --> 00:30:00,344
(both speaking French)

730
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:02,397
<i>Un, deux, trois.</i>

731
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:03,398
(camera clicks)

732
00:30:03,449 --> 00:30:05,233
<i>Voila!</i>
<i>Merci.</i>

733
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:06,234
<i>Merci,</i> suckers.

734
00:30:06,285 --> 00:30:07,735
<i>Au revoir.</i>
All right.

735
00:30:07,786 --> 00:30:09,287
(cell phone vibrating)

736
00:30:11,023 --> 00:30:13,574
What's up,
half bro with the afro?

737
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:14,993
Hey, man.

738
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:16,861
Uh, where are you?
It sounds really loud.

739
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:19,130
I'm just making some scratch
out on Hollywood Boulevard,

740
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:21,966
aka the enormous skid mark
Los Angeles found in its undies.

741
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:23,868
What's going on?
I need some brotherly advice.

742
00:30:23,886 --> 00:30:25,136
I'm all ears.

743
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,005
Okay, what are you
supposed to do when you really

744
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,306
like a girl, but you didn't
know it at first,

745
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,474
then you sort of blew
your shot with her,

746
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:31,676
and now this other dude's
really into her

747
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,511
who you used to think
was a total poser,

748
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:35,263
but turns out he's actually
a really cool guy

749
00:30:35,314 --> 00:30:37,548
who totally has your back,
and you know you'll be

750
00:30:37,566 --> 00:30:40,217
a world-class D-bag if you jump
in now and try to break them up?

751
00:30:40,235 --> 00:30:41,319
Whoa, whoa, whoa, back it up.

752
00:30:41,353 --> 00:30:43,237
Question: is she hot?

753
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:47,658
Yeah.

754
00:30:47,693 --> 00:30:49,060
Uh, dude, you could say that.

755
00:30:49,078 --> 00:30:50,394
Got it.
All right, well, listen up.

756
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:52,229
Play it cool.

757
00:30:52,247 --> 00:30:53,481
Unlike the rest
of those Lima losers,

758
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:55,616
you have superior
Puckerman testosterone

759
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,335
that's pumping those hallways
full of premium.

760
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:58,736
Puckerman-brand pheromones.

761
00:30:58,754 --> 00:31:00,071
Just let her catch a whiff.

762
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:01,873
Then you can sit back
and play nice.

763
00:31:01,907 --> 00:31:03,240
And in a couple weeks,

764
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:04,959
I guarantee she'll be
begging for it.

765
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,911
You really think
that's gonna work?

766
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:08,629
Trust me. That's how
I bagged Teri Hatcher.

767
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,247
Let me tell you,
she's not complaining.

768
00:31:10,265 --> 00:31:11,716
Listen, man, I got to go.

769
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,634
Homeless guy just threw up
on Barbra Streisand's star.

770
00:31:13,685 --> 00:31:14,635
I got to snap a pic.

771
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:16,220
But remember my advice:

772
00:31:16,254 --> 00:31:17,021
Don't be a dick...

773
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:18,422
But don't give up.

774
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,440
Thanks, bro.

775
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:26,064
(school bell ringing)

776
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:33,437
Dude, this is part of
some master plan, right?

777
00:31:33,455 --> 00:31:34,939
You're going back to the
Warblers to gather intel for us

778
00:31:34,957 --> 00:31:36,040
so we can kick their ass
at Sectionals.

779
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:37,041
Sam, don't.

780
00:31:37,076 --> 00:31:38,209
I feel awful enough as it is.

781
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:39,410
Stop, okay?
You've been beating yourself up

782
00:31:39,444 --> 00:31:41,245
for, like, weeks
since you and Kurt broke up.

783
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,713
But going back to Dalton?

784
00:31:42,748 --> 00:31:44,715
You told Finn it was 'cause
you feel more at home there.

785
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,117
If you ask me, it's just
another way to punish yourself.

786
00:31:46,135 --> 00:31:49,220
And for what?
What did you do, exactly?

787
00:31:49,254 --> 00:31:51,255
(panting)

788
00:31:57,146 --> 00:31:59,130
You okay?

789
00:31:59,148 --> 00:32:01,465
No.

790
00:32:01,483 --> 00:32:05,636
Is it because I don't look at
all like my profile picture?

791
00:32:05,654 --> 00:32:08,439
I'm sorry, I-I have to go.

792
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:11,776
It was a guy that
friended me on Facebook.

793
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,796
I went over to his place

794
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,365
because it felt like Kurt
was moving on with his life

795
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:19,617
and I wasn't a part of it.

796
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:22,954
And I got to
thinking that maybe

797
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:24,755
Kurt and I weren't
meant for each other.

798
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,124
That we weren't
supposed to spend

799
00:32:26,158 --> 00:32:27,458
the rest of our lives together.

800
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:30,828
But the horrible thing is,

801
00:32:30,846 --> 00:32:32,847
right after I did it...

802
00:32:35,184 --> 00:32:38,669
...I knew that we were.

803
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:40,271
Dude, you got to
tell Kurt that.

804
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:41,338
What, you think I
haven't told him that?

805
00:32:41,356 --> 00:32:42,339
You think I haven't tried?

806
00:32:42,357 --> 00:32:43,558
Calm down. It's okay.

807
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:45,009
No, it's not okay, Sam,

808
00:32:45,027 --> 00:32:47,562
'cause I cheated
on the one person

809
00:32:47,613 --> 00:32:49,780
that I love more than
anything in this world.

810
00:32:49,815 --> 00:32:52,150
I hurt him, so of course
he's not gonna trust me.

811
00:32:52,184 --> 00:32:53,350
He's never gonna forgive me.

812
00:32:53,368 --> 00:32:55,186
Even if he doesn't,
you got to forgive yourself.

813
00:32:55,204 --> 00:32:57,521
You got to stop...

814
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,491
What's-what's the word when
you make someone into a villain?

815
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:01,859
Uh...

816
00:33:01,877 --> 00:33:03,694
Villainize?

817
00:33:03,712 --> 00:33:05,362
Yeah, you got to stop
villainizing yourself.

818
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,632
Yeah, you hurt Kurt;
That wasn't cool.

819
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,967
So you're trying
to make it right.

820
00:33:10,002 --> 00:33:13,204
But exiling yourself to Dalton
won't fix anything.

821
00:33:13,222 --> 00:33:17,541
I just want to
stop feeling like

822
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,143
I'm a bad person.

823
00:33:19,178 --> 00:33:20,311
You're not.

824
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:21,512
You're one of the good guys.

825
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:23,881
And I got a whole glee club
that agrees with me.

826
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:25,266
Give me a day.

827
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:27,652
One day
before you pack it all up.

828
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:31,388
One day... to be the hero
we all know you are.

829
00:33:31,406 --> 00:33:34,058
And then, you know, you can...

830
00:33:34,076 --> 00:33:36,244
decide where you really belong.

Hey.

866

Listen, I hate
to do this, but...

867
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:49,553
I have to reschedule
our date on Friday.

868
00:36:49,604 --> 00:36:51,171
What?

869
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:52,506
Wh-Why?

870
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:53,474
I have to study.

871
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,561
(clears throat) And, uh...

872
00:36:57,612 --> 00:36:59,980
I have my first appointment
with a dyslexia specialist

873
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:02,566
on Saturday, and he's, like,
the best in Ohio, so he could

874
00:37:02,617 --> 00:37:03,901
only squeeze me in
at 7:00 a.m.,

875
00:37:03,952 --> 00:37:05,686
which means I have to go
straight home after the game.

876
00:37:06,705 --> 00:37:08,188
Well...

877
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:10,157
I was really looking forward
to hanging out.

878
00:37:10,191 --> 00:37:11,742
Me, too. I-I just...

879
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:13,627
It's really important.

880
00:37:13,662 --> 00:37:15,362
I want this to be
the first semester

881
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,531
I hand my mom a report card
with an "A" on it.

882
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,533
How about next Friday?

883
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:20,584
Can we go out then?

884
00:37:20,635 --> 00:37:22,536
Sure.

885
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:24,722
Awesome. Thanks.

886
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:28,709
Ouch. That sounded like
the beginning of the end.

887
00:37:28,727 --> 00:37:31,378
What do you mean? "I can't go
out because I have to study"?

888
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:35,048
Sounded an awful lot like "I'm
not that into you." Well,

889
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:36,717
he has to get up early
to see a doctor.

890
00:37:36,735 --> 00:37:38,051
Is that what
it is? Or is it

891
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:39,553
maybe all the yogurt-covered
raisins?

892
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:41,221
Don't listen to what
everybody else is saying...

893
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,523
I don't think
you look bloated at all.

894
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:44,057
But if you want to
win his attention,

895
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:45,859
you should really
hit the elliptical.

896
00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:47,061
Stat.

897
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,896
You know what?

898
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:51,215
The old Marley would
have sat home alone

899
00:37:51,249 --> 00:37:53,117
on a Friday night, but the new

900
00:37:53,168 --> 00:37:56,704
superheroine Marley's
not gonna wait around.

901
00:38:01,576 --> 00:38:02,743
Hi.

902
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:04,077
What are you doing
Friday night?

903
00:38:04,095 --> 00:38:06,046
Uh...

904
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,548
going on a date with you.

905
00:38:07,582 --> 00:38:09,099

Guys, it was epic.

908
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,926
Dalton was like Death Star

909
00:38:19,944 --> 00:38:22,062
meets Mordor meets
Temple of Doom.

910
00:38:22,096 --> 00:38:24,431
I mean, I might be
exaggerating, but probably not.

911
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:26,233
I owe all of you an apology

912
00:38:26,267 --> 00:38:28,235
for ever doubting
McKinley's my home.

913
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:29,603
You guys are my home.

916
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:34,241
but I am not worried at all.

917
00:38:34,275 --> 00:38:35,442
Because we've got the team,

918
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,744
we've got the talent, and...

919
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:38,111
we have,

920
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:39,446
most importantly,

921
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:41,749

all right, all right,
all right.

929
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,350
Let's start with some warm-ups,

930
00:39:00,402 --> 00:39:02,269
and then we can... Uh, Finn, wait.
Can I say something?

931
00:39:03,738 --> 00:39:06,106
This is for you,

know what to say.
