- Road.

Oh, of course. Why would you be
looking for a yellow brick wall?

That's silly, at the very least.

384
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:06,361
There's the high road, and then there's the
low road. I know every square acre of Oz.

385
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,906
But why would you want me to come with
you? I'm a miserable traveling companion.

- I talk incessantly.
- Yes, I...

387
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,995
I require frequent rest stops at which, I
should warn you, I will also talk incessantly.

It's a terrible habit, I know.
But habits are hard to break.

If we could break them,
they wouldn't be habits.

390
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:24,212
That's okay. I was hoping maybe
you could... fly me there.

00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,964
- In what?
- (CHUCKLES)

392

Oh. Oh, you mean me?

Only... I can't fly.

00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,685
Maybe you could just point the way.

397
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,896
Ah. Actually,
it's in this direction.

398
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,649
I know a shortcut
through Candy County.

399
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:49,237
But I must warn you, if we're to travel
through Candy County, there's one rule.

400
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,906
- What is that?
- You must obey the signs.

401
