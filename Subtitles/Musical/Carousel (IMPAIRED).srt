156
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,649
Big talker, ain't you, Mr. Bigelow?

157
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,319
I suppose you think I can't
throw you out too if I want to?

158
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,820
You're such a good barker,

159
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,115
I can't run my business
without you, is that it? (SCOFFS)

160
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,327
Well, just for that,
you're discharged.

161
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:29,328
Your services are no longer required.
You're bounced. See?

162
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,000
Very well, Mrs. Mullin. Very well.

163
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:36,880
(CHUCKLES) Well, now, you know,
I could bounce you if I felt like it.

164
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,550
Well, you felt like it just now.
So I'm bounced, bounced.

165
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,346
Well, now, you don't have to pick up
every word I say. I only said that I...

166
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,391
Said that my services
were no longer required.

167
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,971
Very good, Mrs. Mullin.
We'll let it go at that.

168
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,064
All right, you devil.
We'll let it go at that.

169
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,650
- Mr. Bigelow, if she said she's...
- You keep out of this.

170
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,570
But I don't want this
to happen on account of me.

171
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,029
- Apologize to her.
- Aha!

172
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:08,620

For giving my carousel a bad name?

173

A ba... (LAUGHING)

174
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,046
The day you bought the carousel,
Mrs. Mullin, it got a bad name.

175
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,126
After all I've done for
you, that's what...

176
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,302
- Now I am through with you.
- Go on.

177
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,012
- And it's for good, do you hear?
- Go on.

Get!

179

Through for good.

180
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,275
And I won't take you back
like I done before.

181
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,444
What will you do now, Mr. Bigelow?

182
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:45,449
Well, first of all, I'll go get
myself a glass of beer.

183
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,702
Whenever anything bothers me,
I always drink a glass of beer.

184
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,912
Then you are bothered
about losing your job.

185
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:55,084
No, only about how
I'm gonna pay for the beer.

186
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,329
Will you pay for it?

187
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,666
You?

188
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,926
- How much money you got?
- Forty-three cents.

189
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,424
And you?

190
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,807
- I asked you how much money you got?
- (CRYING)

191
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,687
Oh.

192
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,438
You don't need to cry about it.

193
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,985
If you ain't got it,
you ain't got it.

00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,905

(STOPS)

197
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,325
Well, that's better.

198
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,332
I'm going over to the carousel
and get my things.

199
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,707
Hey, you know that
bench down the road?

200
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:43,671
The one by the... By the water,
the last one, by the tree.

201
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,426
I'll meet you there.

202
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,631
And then we'll go see about
having that drink.

203
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:57,518
It's all right. Keep your money.
This time, I'll pay.

You have?

The reason I didn't care
to tell you before was...

209

Well, 'cause you didn't
have a fella of your own.

308
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,271
I know, Mr. Bigelow.

309
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,815
All the girls are crazy for you.

310
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,365
Well, that's more like it.

311
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,077
You know what you remind me of?

312
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,121
A girl I knew at Coney Island.

313
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,620
Tell you how I met her.

314
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,835
We was just putting out
the lights one night when...

315
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,038
(MAN) Is that you, Miss Jordan?

316
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,086
Yes, Mr. Bascombe.

317
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,763
- Whatever are you doing out at this hour?
- Well, I...

318
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,933
You couldn't be home in time
now if you ran all the way.

319
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,059
No, sir.

320
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,227
And what's it your business?

321
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,938
Mr. Bigelow, this is Mr. Bascombe.
He owns the mill.

322
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,065
I don't care what he owns.

323
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,110
If you ask me, he owns a lot of nerve.
What right's he got coming here...

324
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,862
What's going on here?

325
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,948
- (BASCOMBE) Oh, good evening, Timmany.
- Evening, Mr. Bascombe.

326
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,741
- Are you having trouble?
- Well...

327
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,195
Him having trouble? Ask me.

328
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,914
I was just setting here with my
lady friend not bothering nobody.

329
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,249
And old sideburns here...

330
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,585
Hear now, Bigelow. Don't be
calling Mr. Bascombe names

331
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,421
unless you're fixing
to get yourself in trouble.

332
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,299
- You know this fellow, Timmany?
- Yes, Mr. Bascombe.

333
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,968
We have a report on him from
the chief of police of Bangor.

334
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:10,805
He's a pretty fly gazabo.
Works on carousels.

335
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,308
Makes a specialty out of
pretty young ones like this.

336
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,767
Gets 'em all moony eyed,

337
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,811
promises to marry 'em
then takes their money.

338
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,980
I haven't got any money.

339
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,317
- That's right. She ain't.
- Oh, you found that out already.

340
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:25,820
Julie, you are a young
and inexperienced child.

341
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,489
And I've decided to give you
one more chance.

342
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,452
I'll take you back to the house myself
and explain everything to the matron.

343
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,078
Come, my child.

344
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,665
Well, don't stand there like
you didn't have good sense.

345
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,868
Do I have to go with you?

346
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,546
Well, no, you don't have to.

347
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:47,175
- Then I'll stay.
- After I warned you.

348
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:51,222
You see, Timmany? There are
some you just can't help.

349
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:55,224
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Bascombe.

350
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,269
You. I ought to throw you in jail.

351
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,940
- What for?
- Don't know. Wish I did.

352
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,776
Well, and then what?

353
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,277
Huh?

354
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:14,403
You were telling me a story. You were
just putting out the lights when...

355
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,994
Oh, yeah.

356
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:24,295
Well, just as the lights went out,
someone come along.

357
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,749
It was this little girl,
the one with the...

358
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,094
Tell me something. Ain't
you scared of me?

359
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:35,345
I mean, after what that cop said
about me taking money from girls.

360
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,430
I ain't scared.

361
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,439
You're a funny kid.

362
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,403
Well, you wanna go
into town and dance?

363
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:51,115
Oh, no. I have to be careful.

364
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,155
- Of what?
- My character.

365
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,954
See, I'm never gonna marry.

366
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,330
Huh?

367
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,536
Well, a girl who don't marry has
gotta be much more particular.

368
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,421
About what? Who she's seen with?

369
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,250
Oh, no. No.

370
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,302
About not letting other people
get the wrong impression.

371
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,973
See, if... if I was gonna marry,

372
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,056
it wouldn't make so
much difference.

373
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,887
Oh.

374
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,319
Suppose I was to say to you
that I'd marry you.

375
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,404
You?

376
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:35,033
That scares you, don't it? You're
thinking about what that cop said.

377
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:39,159
No. Why, I never paid
no mind to what he said.

378
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,839
Well, you wouldn't marry a fella
like me anyway, would you?

379
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,008
Yes, I would...

380
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,836
If I loved you.

381
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:58,011
Why, it wouldn't make
any difference what you...

382
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,594
Even if I died for it.

383
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,022
Nah.

384
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,025
How do you know what you'd do
if you loved me,

385
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,354
how you'd feel or anything?

386
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,445
I don't know how I'd know.

387
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,077

00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,055
Even if a girl was foolish enough
to want me to, I wouldn't.

466
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,435
Don't worry about it, Billy.

467
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,613
Who's worried?

468
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,700
You're right about
there being no wind.

469
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:04,706
The blossoms are just
coming down by theirselves.

470
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,335
It's just their time to, I reckon.

471
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:57,261
Well, you being Julie's only kinfolk,
I thought you'd want to know.

472
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,389
Ain't seen that barker
from the carousel neither.

473
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,765
He got bounced too.

474
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:06,020
- If you ain't got any better than them...
- Oh, I got better. I got better.

475
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:10,190
It could be accidental, them both
disappearing at the same time.

476
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,027
All the same, it does
look a might peculiar.

477
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:16,697
Nobody in our family ever did anything
to be ashamed of, Clem Hoops.

478
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,907
Now, you just find me a couple
of good, big lobsters or get!

479
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,485
Cousin Nettie!

480
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,414
Julie, Julie.

481
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:29,082
Julie. Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

482
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:33,589
- I was wondering where you been.
- I been getting married, Cousin Nettie.

483
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,884
This is my husband, Billy Bigelow.

484
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,262
- Your husband?
- It's a fact, Nettie.

485
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,131
Look.

486
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,557
- It's pretty.
- Solid gold plated.

487
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,941
I'm pleased to know
you, Mr. Bigelow.

488
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,531
And I wish you both
all the happiness in the world.

489
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,201
I'd have said it sooner,
but it's kind of a surprise.

490
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,154
It takes a little getting used to.

491
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,707
Me, I never got used to it.

492
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,960
I just couldn't get
the hang of being married.

493
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,129
Was that Julie's fault?

494
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,424
I didn't say that.

495
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,094
But maybe it wasn't
my fault either.

496
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,889
There was only one
carousel in town.

497
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,888
I couldn't go back there.

498
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,972
- I didn't have a job.
- What did you live on?

499
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,981
Her cousin Nettie.

500
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:42,025
- To be perfectly honest with you, I tried...
- I would be if I were you.

501
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,661
Me, I never got used to it.

502
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,786
I didn't mind living
off her cousin Nettie.

503
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:53,249
It was... It was just having
nothing to do that drove me crazy.

504
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:59,884
Well, a couple of months went by.

505
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,295
Then it was June.

506
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:07,138
Everybody was getting ready for
the first clambake of the season.

507
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,103
Excepting Julie and me,

508
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:14,524
everybody was having
themselves a whale of a time.

Hello there on the Nancy B.

573
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,232
Hello there on the Nancy B.

574
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:23,405
- Lookin' for somebody, miss?
- My husband.

575
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:26,032
They told me he was with one
of your hands, Jigger Craigin.

576
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,828
Could be, ma'am, but I ain't seen him.
The whole crew's gone ashore.

577
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:34,291
They was, uh, figurin'
on goin' on that clambake.

578
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,043
Maybe you can catch
up with them there.

579
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,336
Thank you, sir.

580
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,222
- She gone?
- Yeah.

581
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:52,427
Billy, is that true?
ls there a clambake today?

582
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:56,480
- Yeah. First one of the year.
- Yeah.

583
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,399
Why don't we go?

584
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,653
- What for?
- We'd come back rich. That's what for.

585
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,489
Rich? From a clambake?
You'd be the first one.

586
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,700
Jigger's been the first
one lots of times.

587
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:11,161
What you need is a glass of beer.
Come on, I'm buying.

588
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,956
That clambake's just
what I've been waitin' for.

589
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,584
You couldn't find him, could you?

590
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,294
- No.
- Hello, Julie.

591
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,088
Hello, Carrie.

592
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,437
Julie, is Billy working yet?

593
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,439
No.

594
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:48,984
Mr. Snow says a man that can't find
work these days is just bone lazy.

595
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:54,406
Billy don't know any trade. He's
only good at what he used to do.

596
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:57,415
So now he just don't do anything.

597
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,751
You know something else, Carrie?

598
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:02,629
- Last Monday, he hit her.
- Nettie.

599
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,923
- Did you hit him back?
- Oh, no.

600
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,634
Well, I would have. I'd leave him.

601
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,928
You don't understand, Carrie.

602
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:12,806
You see, he's unhappy
'cause he ain't working.

603
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,724
That's why he hit me Monday.

604
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:19,146
Fine reason for hitting you. Beats
his wife 'cause he ain't working.

605
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,023
Is this before the
clambake, after or what?

606
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,526
It's while the clambake's going on.

607
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:27,320
Now, once we're out there,
suppose me and you get in a boat

608
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,323
and come back in and
did whatever we had to do.

609
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,450
Then we got back.
There's your alibi.

610
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:36,079
We could just say, "We were on the
island all the time. We got lost."

611
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,832
All right. What do we have to do?

612
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,917
I mean me, what do I gotta do?

613
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:44,003
Well, first, you go up
to old sideburns and you say,

614
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,504
"Excuse me, sir.
Could you tell me the time?"

615
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:53,180
I say, "Excuse me, sir.
Could you tell me the time?"

616
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,806
Then what?

617
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:57,517
Then by that time, I got
my knife in his ribs.

618
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:00,062
- Then you take your knife...
- Me?

619
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,106
I ain't got a knife.

620
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,525
Well, you can get one, can't you?

621
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:08,069
- Does he have to be killed?
- No, he don't have to be.

622
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,406
But these New Englanders are
funny. They'd rather be killed.

623
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,109
Well? Hmm?

624
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:16,077
I ain't gonna do it. It's dirty.

625
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,288
- What's dirty about it?
- Killing.

626
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:19,539
What's the matter with you?

627
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,374
We ain't gonna kill him.
We're just gonna scare him.

628
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,919
That's what the knives
are for, to scare him.

629
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,089
I ain't gonna do it, Jigger.

630
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,552
Of course, if you've got
all the money you want...

631
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,551
I ain't got a cent.

632
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,099
Money thinks I'm dead.

633
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,354
Julie?

634
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,982
I got some good news to tell you.

635
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,109
'Bout you and Mr. Snow?

636
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,062
(LAUGHING)

637
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,531
Carrie and me are bein'
cried in church on Sunday.

638
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:57,282
- Mr. Snow, you startled me!
- (CHUCKLES)

639
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,960
Well, this is him.

640
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,831
- Carrie told me a lot about you.
- Oh.

641
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,634
I told you a lot about
Julie, didn't I?

642
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,590
(SNOW LAUGHS)

643
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,181
Enoch's nice-lookin', ain't he?

644
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,475
Oh, come, Carrie.

645
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,678
- Steady and reliable too.
- (SNOW LAUGHS)

646
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:27,145
(CARRIE) Well, ain't you
gonna wish us good luck?

647
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,943
Course I wish you luck, Carrie.

648
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:39,911
You can kiss Enoch too,
us bein' such good friends

649
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,490
and me bein' right here
lookin' on at you.

650
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,088
(SOBS)

651
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,792
Why are you cryin', Mrs. Bigelow?

652
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,803
It's because she has
such a good heart.

653
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,390
We thank you for your
heartfelt sympathy.

654
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,719
We thank you, Mrs. Bigelow.

655
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:08,941
Billy! Billy.

656
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:19,659
You know Carrie, and...
This is her intended, Mr. Snow.

657
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,828
- Mr. Snow?
- Mr. Bigelow?

658
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:22,954
(LAUGHS)

659
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:25,123
I feel like I know you.

660
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:29,086
Oh, yes. The man who
owns the herring boat.

661
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,214
You smell it over there, Jigger?

662
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,634
Nope. Wind's in the
wrong direction.

663
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:40,847
- It's a good, honest smell!
- It's a powerful, honest smell.

664
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,891
Carrie. You still want
me to offer him a job?

665
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:44,976
What job?

666
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:47,937
Mr. Snow here is thinkin'
of puttin' on another boat

667
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,732
and I was gonna ask him to offer
you a job on it, but now I...

668
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,026
Me? Work on a herring boat?

669
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:56,195
(SCOFFS) No, thanks.

670
00:51:56,196 --> 00:52:00,526
Enoch, come along before you lose
your temper and do something violent.

671
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:07,249
Well? Go ahead. Say it.

672
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:11,002
I insulted your friends,
stayed out all night.

673
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:14,172
I ain't workin'. I'm livin'
off your cousin Nettie.

674
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:18,051
- I didn't say anything.
- No, but it was on the tip of your tongue.

675
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:21,179
I was only gonna ask if... If you
wanted to go to the clambake.

676
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:25,016
It's a good idea, Billy. You've been
actin' kind of nervous and edgy.

677
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:27,477
Who knows? Maybe you
might find the treasure.

678
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,976
No! Ain't goin' to no clambake.

679
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:37,570
Well, you got anything else to say?

680
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,530
Like what, Billy?

681
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:42,530
Well, like whether
I'm hungry or not.

682
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:47,205
I didn't have to ask that, Billy.
I knowed you was hungry.

683
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:50,535
You go and sit down,
and I'll bring you your dinner.

684
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,591
Do you wanna see somebody?

685
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:02,387
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, Billy.

686
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:05,098
- That is, if he's home yet.
- He's home.

687
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,558
Would it be asking too much
to know where he is?

688
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,434
My husband is around the other
side, waitin' for his dinner.

689
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,474
Thanks.

690
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,321
Hello, Billy.

691
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,953
Well, what'd you come for?

692
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:30,456
Well, I see you're still hangin'
around your jailbird friend.

693
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,458
What's it to you who
I hang around with?

694
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:36,129
One thing I can't abide is
a common type woman.

695
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:40,800
Everybody that gets mixed up with him
finishes up in the jailhouse or the grave.

696
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,548
Common woman.

697
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:47,891
Put on a new coat of paint. You're
startin' to peel, old pleasure boat.

698
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,056
(CHUCKLES)

699
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,681
Well. What are you doin' here?

700
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,225
You got a new barker, ain't you?

701
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:59,360
Why don't you stay home
and sleep at night?

702
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,570
- You look awful.
- Ah.

703
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,156
Here, come on. Put your hair
back off your forehead.

704
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:05,280
Oh, leave my hair be.

705
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,662
I, uh, hear you been beatin' her.

706
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,414
Now if you're sick of her,
why don't you leave her?

707
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:14,333
- There's no use beatin' the poor thing.
- Who beat her?

708
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,128
What's all this darn fool talk
about a beatin'? I hit her once.

709
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:18,212
Oh.

710
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,506
Now the whole town is talkin'...

711
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,633
Next one I hear say "beat,"
I'm gonna smash...

712
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:26,637
All right. All right, all right, all right.
All right. I take it back.

713
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,515
Look, I don't wanna
get mixed up in this.

714
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,515
"Beat her." As if I'd beat her.

715
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,644
(MULLIN CHUCKLING)

716
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,897
What's the odds one
way or the other?

717
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:40,444
Why don't you look at the thing straight?
You're sick of bein' married.

718
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,529
(BILLY) Carousel ain't
crowded without me, is it?

719
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,074
Oh, Billy. You see? You belong
out there and you know it.

720
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,410
You wasn't cut out
for a respectable, married man.

721
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:52,740
You're the... You're...
You're the artist type.

722
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,368
You belong among artists.

723
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,246
Tell you what, Billy.

724
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,840
You come back...

725
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:06,671
And I'll give you that ruby
ring my husband left me.

726
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,347
(BILLY) I don't know. I...

727
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,760
Yeah.

728
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,895
I might go back.

729
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:19,398
Yeah. Yeah, I could still
live here with Julie, and...

730
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:22,026
- Holy Moses!
- Well, what's wrong?

731
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,111
Well, can you imagine?
The girls would love that,

732
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,405
a barker who runs home
to his wife every night.

733
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,575
Why, people would
laugh theirselves sick.

734
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,450
- Well, I... I know I would. (LAUGHS)
- (LAUGHS)

735
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,202
Yeah. I can hear you laughin'.

736
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:38,456
- Don't be so stuck on yourself.
- (TRAY CLATTERS)

737
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,122
- You want anything?
- Brought you your dinner.

738
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,725
Billy? I...

739
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,682
I got somethin' to tell you.

740
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,973
All right.

741
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,399
I've... Been wantin' to tell you.

742
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,652
- In fact, I was goin' to yesterday...
- Go ahead.

743
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:07,823
I can't. We gotta be alone.

744
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,992
Can't you see I'm busy here?
I'm talkin' business.

745
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:13,786
- It'll only take a minute.
- Get out of here.

746
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,372
- I tell you. It'll only take a minute.
- Will you get out of here?

747
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,332
- No!
- What did you say?

748
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:21,707
Ah, let her alone. She's
got somethin' to tell you.

749
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:26,042
And you... You've got
somethin' to tell her.

750
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,585
I'll be back in a minute.

751
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:35,933
- Well?
- Don't look at me like that.

752
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,102
I ain't afraid of you.
I ain't afraid of anyone.

753
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:43,062
Go ahead and tell me
what it is. Make it quick.

754
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:47,855
Well, I... I can't
tell you so quick.

755
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,702
Why don't you drink your coffee?

756
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:57,246
Is that what you come to tell me?

757
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:01,202
No, but... But by the time you
drink it, I'll have told you.

758
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,832
Well?

759
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,465
Well...

760
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:13,804
Yesterday my head ached,
and you asked me if...

761
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,222
Yes?

762
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,970
Well, you see, that's what it is.

763
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,390
I'm gonna have a baby.

764
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,490
Julie. Julie!

765
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:34,910
You ain't mad, Billy, are you?

766
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,828
Should you be walkin'
up them stairs?

767
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,790
- Sure, Billy.

Why, just to see your lovely smile,

1075
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:35,728
I'd swim through beer
with my mouth closed.

Oh!

1077
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:41,314
Oh. Hello, Enoch.

1078
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:45,071
This is the way
firemen carry people.

1079
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:46,615
Where's the fire?

1080
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:53,037
He... He was just showin'
me how to defend myself.

1081
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,415
It didn't look like you'd learned
very much by the time I came.

1082
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:57,542
That's 'cause you came too early.

1083
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:00,920
In my opinion, sir, you are
as scurvy a hunk of scum

1084

the woman I'm engaged to

1087
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,888
bein' carried out of the
woods like a fallen deer.

1088

Oh, no, Enoch. He wasn't
carryin' me out of the woods.

1089
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,518
He was carryin' me into the woods.

free, loose and lollygaggin'.

01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,733

never marry one.

Aw, let him go, Carrie.

She's 15 years old.

1380
01:41:13,568 --> 01:41:15,735
And she ain't happy, huh?

1381
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:17,445
No, she ain't, Billy. She's...

1382
01:41:17,446 --> 01:41:19,739
You know, she's a lot like you.

1383
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:22,826
That's why I think
maybe you could help her.

1384
01:41:22,827 --> 01:41:25,701
Do you... Do you wanna
take a look at her?

1385
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:29,082
Could I... Could I
see her from here?

1386
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,536
Sure, you can, if you want to.

1387
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:38,091
Nah. If she ain't happy,
I don't wanna look.

1388
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:42,012
Well, right now, she appears
to be having a fine time.

1389
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:45,473
Yes, sir. There she is
running along the beach there,

1390
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:48,018
got her shoes and stockings off.

1391
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:52,223
- Like I used to do, huh?
- Yeah.

1392
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:56,318
Don't you think you
better take a look?

1393
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:01,699
Well, what do I have
to do to see her?

1394
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:04,952
Just look and wait.

1395
01:42:05,828 --> 01:42:08,872
And the power to see
her will come to you.

1396
01:42:21,594 --> 01:42:23,553
Is that her?

1397
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:25,472
Pretty, ain't she?

All right, Billy.

- Look, can she see me?
- Only if you want her to.

good about him?

1528
02:00:58,334 --> 02:01:01,879
There was a strange man
here, and he hit me hard.

02:01:05,592 --> 02:01:09,387
But it didn't hurt. It
didn't hurt at all.

1531
02:01:10,805 --> 02:01:13,053
It was just as if
he kissed my hand.

1532
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:16,678
Go into the house, Louise.

1533
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:21,648
What's happened, Mother?
Don't you believe me?

1534
02:01:21,649 --> 02:01:23,351
I believe you.

1535
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:27,860
Then why don't you tell me
why you're acting so funny?

1536
02:01:28,948 --> 02:01:31,033
Oh, it's nothing, darling.

1537
02:01:31,034 --> 02:01:35,537
But is it possible, Mother? For
someone to hit you hard like that,

1538
02:01:35,538 --> 02:01:37,411
real loud and hard,

1539
02:01:38,333 --> 02:01:40,501
and not hurt you at all?

1540
02:01:40,835 --> 02:01:43,037
It is possible, dear,

1541
02:01:43,838 --> 02:01:47,463
for someone to hit
you, hit you hard,

1542
02:01:48,718 --> 02:01:50,761
and it not hurt at all.

1543
02:02:04,734 --> 02:02:05,901
Julie.

1544
02:02:16,913 --> 02:02:18,535

Seems like she knew I was here.

1557
02:03:56,346 --> 02:03:58,548
Julie would always know.

1558
02:03:59,557 --> 02:04:03,011
- She never changes.
- Nope, Julie never changes.

1559
02:04:04,062 --> 02:04:06,730
But my little girl, my Louise...

1560
02:04:06,731 --> 02:04:09,650
- I gotta do something for her.
- So far, you ain't done much.

1561
02:04:09,651 --> 02:04:12,194
- I know, I know.
- Time's running out.

1562
02:04:12,195 --> 02:04:14,363
But it ain't over yet.

1563
02:04:14,364 --> 02:04:17,067
Look. I want an extension.

1564
02:04:19,535 --> 02:04:22,784

Miss Louise Bigelow.

1569
02:04:49,983 --> 02:04:53,652
Our speaker this year
is the most popular,

1570
02:04:53,653 --> 02:04:56,405
best beloved man in our town,

1571
02:04:56,406 --> 02:04:57,949
Dr. Seldon.

1572
02:04:58,074 --> 02:05:00,197
- (APPLAUSE)
- (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

1573
02:05:05,123 --> 02:05:07,916
He reminds me of that fella
up there, that star keeper.

1574
02:05:07,917 --> 02:05:12,170
Yep. A lot of these country doctors
and preachers remind you of him.

1575
02:05:12,171 --> 02:05:15,295
(SELDON) It's the custom
at these graduations

1576
02:05:15,633 --> 02:05:20,179
to pick out some old duck like
me to preach at the kids.

1577
02:05:22,557 --> 02:05:24,725
Well, I can't preach at you.

1578
02:05:24,726 --> 02:05:26,935
I know you all too well.

1579
02:05:26,936 --> 02:05:29,730
I brought most of
you into the world,

1580
02:05:29,731 --> 02:05:32,190
rubbed liniment on your backs,

1581
02:05:32,191 --> 02:05:34,439
poured castor oil
down your throats.

1582
02:05:36,362 --> 02:05:38,947
I only hope that now
I got you this far,

1583
02:05:38,948 --> 02:05:43,073
you'll turn out to be worth all
the trouble I took with you.

1584
02:05:44,454 --> 02:05:46,076
I...

1585
02:05:46,956 --> 02:05:51,206
I can't tell you any
sure way to happiness.

1586
02:05:51,627 --> 02:05:56,503
I only know that you've gotta go
out and find it for yourselves.

1587
02:05:57,633 --> 02:06:00,302
You can't lean on
the success of your parents.

1588
02:06:00,803 --> 02:06:02,721
That's their success.

1589
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:07,809
- And don't be held back by their failures.
- Listen to him. Believe him.

1590
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:11,354
It makes no difference
what they did or didn't do.

1591
02:06:11,355 --> 02:06:14,229
You just stand on
your own two feet.

1592
02:06:15,693 --> 02:06:21,525
The world belongs to you
as much as to the next fella.

1593
02:06:21,699 --> 02:06:23,697
So don't give it up.

1594
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:27,990
And try not to be scared
of people not liking you.

1595
02:06:28,498 --> 02:06:30,996
Just you try liking them.

1596
02:06:31,918 --> 02:06:36,043
And just keep your
faith and your courage

1597
02:06:36,839 --> 02:06:39,383
and you'll turn out all right.

1598
02:06:40,259 --> 02:06:44,054
It's like what we used to sing every
morning when I was a boy at school.

1599
02:06:44,055 --> 02:06:46,257
Maybe you still sing it.
