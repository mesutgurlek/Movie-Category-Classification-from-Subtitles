1
00:00:02,258 --> 00:00:03,725
<i>So here's whad
on Glee:</i>

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:05,693
<i>Jesse left Vocal Adrenaline...
JESSE: I'm a star.</i>

3
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:07,629
<i>You can learn from me.
...so he could date Rachel, so now he's</i>

4
00:00:07,696 --> 00:00:09,397
<i>part of the glee club.
Great to have you here.</i>

5
00:00:09,465 --> 00:00:10,865
<i>And they're
the new power couple.</i>

6
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:12,300
<i>Previous power couples:
Rachel and Finn...</i>

7
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:14,335
I made us his and her
relationship calendars.

8
00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:15,670
<i>Oh.
...also, Rachel and Puck.</i>

9
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:17,238
Want to make out?
Sure.

10
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:20,108
<i>Will still
has a crush on Emma...</i>

11
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:22,677
I could just lean over and kiss
you if I want to. And I want to.

12
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:24,846
<i>But he hasn't divorced
Terri yet, and he made out</i>

13
00:00:24,913 --> 00:00:26,314
<i>with the coach
of Vocal Adrenaline.</i>

14
00:00:26,382 --> 00:00:28,683
Most of the show choir directors
I make out with are gay.

15
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:31,719
<i>And Sue?
Sloppy freak
show babies!</i>

16
00:00:31,787 --> 00:00:33,288
<i>Still just kind of
angry about everything.</i>

17
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:33,521
SUE:
Who wants a piece of it? Huh?

18
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:37,959
<i>And that's what
you missed on Glee.</i>

19
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:40,628
{laughter}

20
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:41,829
{"Physical" by
Olivia Newton-John playing}

21
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,667
What's so funny?

22
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:47,702
You guys aren't watching
the video of me falling

23
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,837
off stage at my first TinyTots
beauty pageant, are you?

24
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:51,005
That was Carrot Top funny

25
00:00:51,073 --> 00:00:52,507
compared to this comedic
tour de force.

26
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:55,076
JESSIE: That's Olivia
Newton-John's "Physical."

27
00:00:55,144 --> 00:00:57,612
It was pretty groundbreaking
subject matter at the time,

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,214
considering it's depiction
of fluid sexuality.

29
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:01,182
MERCEDES:
Oh, my good...
{laughter}

30
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,451
Wait, wait.

31
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:04,786
That's not Olivia Newton-John.

32
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:07,088
That's, that's
Sue Sylvester.

33
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:08,623
Where did you get this?

34
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:10,258
I can tell you
that I certainly did not

35
00:01:10,326 --> 00:01:11,726
steal it from her locked
file cabinet yesterday

36
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:13,161
when she sent me
back to her office

37
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:15,430
to get her hormone
replacement injection

38
00:01:15,497 --> 00:01:17,298
during Cheerios!
practice.

39
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:18,599
{laughter}

40
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:20,134
Wait,

41
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:21,436
did she just do
the Cabbage Patch?

42
00:01:21,503 --> 00:01:23,071
{laughter}

43
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:24,372
I'm posting this
on YouTube.

44
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
RACHEL:
No, no, wait, wait.

45
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:26,407
Do you think
that's a good idea?

46
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:28,309
She might kill us.

47
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:30,211
Oh, let her get a
taste of some of

48
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:31,913
the humiliation
she put us through.

49
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,448
JESSIE:
I'm with Finn.

50
00:01:33,515 --> 00:01:36,184
You guys need to stop being such
asses and start being bad-asses.

51
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:38,186
{laughter}

52
00:01:38,253 --> 00:01:41,622
Ten bucks it goes
viral by lunch.

53
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,959
¶¶ Let's get animal, animal... ¶¶

54
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:47,662
Hey, Ms. Sylvester.

55
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,030
Let's get physical.

56
00:01:49,098 --> 00:01:51,666
Not really my type,
but I like that attitude.

57
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:52,934
Hey, Sue!

58
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:54,869
Let's get animal!

59
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,775
{school bell ringing}

60
00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:04,679
That glee club stole my private
property and posted it online.

61
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:06,080
And as soon as I figure out

62
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:07,148
the difference between
slander and libel,

63
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:08,316
I'm filing a lawsuit.

64
00:02:08,384 --> 00:02:09,550
WILL:
Sue, don't you think

65
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:10,985
you might be
overstating this a little?

66
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:13,154
Will, I may buy
a small diaper for your chin,

67
00:02:13,222 --> 00:02:14,922
because it looks like
a baby's ass.

68
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,393
That video has received
over 170,000 comments.

69
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,562
I took the liberty of
printing out a few.

70
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,498
"The man in this video
looks like

71
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:25,867
the champion cheerleading coach
Sue Sylvester."

72
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:27,668
That was particularly hurtful.

73
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:29,670
{clears throat}
You know, Sue, there are a lot

74
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:31,439
of people at this school
who dislike you.

75
00:02:31,507 --> 00:02:32,640
My kids don't do
stuff like this.

76
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:33,808
Is that so?

77
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:36,544
Exhibit B.

78
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:39,447
What's a "Glist"?

79
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:41,048
It's the "Glee List" William.

80
00:02:41,116 --> 00:02:43,017
It's a weekly ranking
of your glee club,

81
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:44,819
based on a hotness quotient
of sexual promiscuity.

82
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:47,388
It was posted all over
the school an hour ago.

83
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:48,556
Apparently, you get a point

84
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:50,691
for each act of
perpetuated depravity.

85
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:53,761
What makes you think
my kids did this?

86
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,430
This Glist was made
on a library computer

87
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:57,932
using the pass code "gleeclub."

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,002
Your glee club is
a petri dish of
sexual depravity.

89
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:02,470
Sue's right, Will.

90
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:04,405
Why, only last year,
a list was posted

91
00:03:04,473 --> 00:03:07,074
ranking McKinley's
ten ugliest Gingers.

92
00:03:07,142 --> 00:03:08,443
And the perpetrator
would have

93
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,911
been expelled
had it not turned out

94
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:11,579
to be a member of the faculty!

95
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:13,014
I stand by that list.

96
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:14,649
William, this is serious.

97
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:17,452
I cannot have an environment
that sexualizes children

98
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,287
and damages their self-esteem!

99
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:25,960
You know, a week ago,
had I fod a list

100
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:27,929
that so degraded the glee club,
I would've been embarrassed

101
00:03:27,996 --> 00:03:29,230
I was beaten to the punch.

102
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:30,731
But now I know the
white-hot shame

103
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,468
of public rebuke-- that
pain is indescribable.

104
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:36,103
William, last year,
at West Dayton High,

105
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:37,572
a photo circulated of

106
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,440
school superintendent...
And what was
he wearing?

107
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:41,409
Women's lingerie.
And what was
he riding?

108
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:43,211
Pony!
And who was
expelled?

109
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:44,445
The entire school!

110
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:45,913
The entire school
was expelled, will!

111
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:47,648
What does that
have to do with me?

112
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:49,817
You must find out
who made the Glist

113
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:51,586
and suspend them before
they post another one,

114
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:53,955
or I'm holding the entire
glee club responsible!

115
00:03:54,022 --> 00:03:55,223
Are you serious?

116
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,891
Deadly serious!

117
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,026
I cannot have these
shenanigans at this school!

118
00:03:59,094 --> 00:04:01,462
<i>He cannot have these
shenanigans at this school!</i>

119
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,705
Who did it?

120
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,074
This is serious.

121
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,243
Principal Figgins is threatening
to disband the club.

122
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,811
Why are we playing this game?

123
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,279
We all know it was Puck.

124
00:04:18,347 --> 00:04:19,981
Back off.
I didn't do squat.

125
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,883
Then why is your girlfriend
first on the Glist?

126
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,384
And why am I last?

127
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:25,720
Aside from the fact that I
refused to put out for you.

128
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:29,290
Okay, enough! No one is
accusing anyone of anything.

129
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:30,625
Puck, seriously,
did you do it?

130
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:31,692
I said no.

131
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,160
I'm a delinquent, sure.

132
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:34,362
I like setting
stuff on fire

133
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:35,796
and ating up
people I don't know.

134
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:37,665
I own at.
But I'm not a liar.

135
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,734
All right, here's
the important point.

136
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:42,103
Between this and posting
Coach Sylvester's

137
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,539
personal video on YouTube,
you guys are getting

138
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:45,973
a pretty bad
reputation.

139
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,708
Why is that a bad thing?

140
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:49,243
Maybe if we seem more dangerous,

141
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:51,646
people would stop flushing
my glasses down the toilet.

142
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:53,781
Look, things are
hard right now.

143
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:55,182
I get it.
You're under a lot

144
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,417
of pressure
with regionals coming up.

145
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:58,452
And I know that winning
sectionals hasn't had

146
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,620
the positive effect
on your popularity

147
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:01,188
that a lot of you
thought it would.

148
00:05:01,256 --> 00:05:05,126
But becoming what you despise
is not the answer.

149
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:06,961
Man, this song is wack.

150
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:08,062
No, it's not.

151
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,130
It's a terrific song

152
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:10,765
on a long list
of top hits that,

153
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:13,067
because of time or some
bad press, has become a joke.

154
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:14,902
And, like you guys,
it's time to start

155
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,138
rehabilitating
its bad reputation.

156
00:05:17,205 --> 00:05:18,472
The assignment
for the week

157
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,776
is for all of you
to find songs like this,

158
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:23,678
mine them for what works

159
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:25,146
and make them great again.

160
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:26,747
And then, hopefully,

161
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:28,883
can apply this musical lesson
to your own lives.

162
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:31,452
This song should be arrested
for the crime of sucking.

163
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,386
{laughter}
Mm-hmm.

164
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:33,921
You want to bet?

165
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:35,990
{oohing, murmuring}
Oh, no, he didn't.

166
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:37,291
Hit it.

167
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:39,694
{"Ice Ice Baby" playing}

¶¶ Ice is back
with a brand-new invention ¶¶

¶¶ Something grabs
ahold of me tightly ¶¶

¶¶ Flow like a harpoon
daily and nightly ¶¶

¶¶ Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know ¶¶

177
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:58,379
¶¶ Turn off the lights, huh ¶¶

178

in case you didn't know it ¶¶

¶¶ My town that created all th
bass sound, enough to shake ¶¶

197
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:35,750
¶¶ And kick holes in the ground
'cause my style's ¶¶

¶¶ Feasible rhymes
you can vision and feel ¶¶

00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:19,760

{cheering}

224
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:24,899
Right, Jessie?

225
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:26,333
You got me?

226
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:27,702
{bell ringing}

227
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,339

228
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:36,310
<i>SUE:
This is not happening.</i>

229
00:07:36,378 --> 00:07:39,914
<i>The cruel slow-motion laughter
is just your imagination.</i>

230
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:42,717
<i>You're Sue Sylvester-- legend.</i>

231
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:44,285
<i>They're not laughing at you</i>

232
00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:46,787
<i>because of
your "Physical" video.</i>

233
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:51,292
<i>Just calmly pour yourself
a cup of joe and focus.</i>

234
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,527
<i>Wait, what's that smell?</i>

235
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:55,963
<i>Dear God, that's coffee.</i>

236
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:58,065
<i>It's usually masked
by the smell of fear.</i>

237
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:01,302
<i>Sweet merciful Lord,
this is happening!</i>

238
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:04,105
<i>You're being laughed at
in slow motion</i>

239
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:06,707
<i>by a roomful of inferiors
whom you used to terrify.</i>

240
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:11,245
The name is Brenda.

241
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:12,646
Brenda Castle.

242
00:08:12,714 --> 00:08:15,449
I just transferred
from Fort Wayne.

243
00:08:15,517 --> 00:08:17,718
I can't teach in
Indiana anymore

244
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:20,020
'cause I have some
"drug problems"

245
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:22,890
that ended up involving
some of my "shoot-ins."

246
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:26,293
{laughing}:
I saw your video.

247
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,431
And you, my friend,
are an embarrassment.

248
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:33,701
And that's me talking!

249
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:36,237
{laughter echoes}

250
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:41,108
{bell ringing}

251
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:43,110
I need to enlist the
services of the A/V Club.

252
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:44,645
What did you
have in mind?

253
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:47,314
My shame at appearing so low on
the Glist has made me reevaluate

254
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:49,416
my image at this school
and beyond.

255
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:51,051
I've now realized
that in today's culture

256
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,454
of bad boy athletes
and celebrity sex tapes,

257
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:55,956
a good reputation
is no good at all.

258
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:58,058
Artie, you know how our
Glee Club assignment was

259
00:08:58,126 --> 00:09:00,694
to find a song with
a bad reputation
and rehabilitate it?

260
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:02,296
Well, mine is going to afford me

261
00:09:02,364 --> 00:09:04,532
the worst reputation
in this school.

262
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:07,401
Rachel Berry is going to get
a little down and dirty.

263
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:08,536
I'm going to stop you.

264
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:09,737
You had me at "sex tape."

265
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:11,472
How can I help?

266
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,474
Hold onto your hat,

267
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:15,976
because Rachel Berry
is going to become

268
00:09:16,044 --> 00:09:18,940
{whispers}:
musically promiscuous.

269
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:28,786
because our free-falling reps
have reached terminal velocity.

270
00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:30,188
We are at Defcon One.

271
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:31,789
We're such zeros they
didn't even bother

272
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:33,224
putting us on
the Glist.

273
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,826
What does a C-lister do
when their tiny star

274
00:09:35,894 --> 00:09:37,995
is about to fall off Perez
Hilton's radar screen?

275
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:40,965
They cause a
scandal so extreme

276
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:42,733
they can no longer
be ignored.

277
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:44,335
Um, excuse me.

278
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:45,670
Why is she here?

279
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:49,373
I've been here
since first period.

280
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:51,709
I had a cold, and I
took all my antibiotics

281
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:55,680
at the same time, and now
I can't remember how to leave.

282
00:09:55,747 --> 00:09:57,915
But I also don't know why
I've only made fourth

283
00:09:57,983 --> 00:09:59,350
on the Glist.

284
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:01,919
I've made out with, like,
everyone in this school.

285
00:10:01,987 --> 00:10:04,188
Girls, boys,
Mr. Kidney the janitor.

286
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:05,823
I need to do

287
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:07,525
something to get into
the top three.

288
00:10:07,593 --> 00:10:09,493
Fine, you're in.
In what?

289
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:11,195
We don't even
have a plan.

290
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:14,165
What is the worst thing
a student can do at this school?

291
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:15,433
Eat in the cafeteria?

292
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,567
{snickering}

293
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:18,703
No, be a disruption
in the library.

294
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,971
And I'm not
talking about

295
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:22,139
trying to check out
a reference book.

296
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:23,541
Mm-mm.

297
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:26,244
I'm talking about
full-on chaos--

298
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:28,212
including getting
your Glee on in the stacks.

299
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:31,215
Genius.

300
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:35,953
I never really understood
how hard it is to be laughed at.

301
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:37,388
Particularly in slow motion.

302
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:39,290
I try to make it seem

303
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:40,958
like nothing
can touch me, but...

304
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:42,927
Boy...

305
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:45,329
Jean, I'm so sorry you
ever felt that way.

306
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:47,565
I'm sorry I didn't
protect you more.

307
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:49,600
Remember what we used
to do, Sue?

308
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:51,669
Whenever I got sad,

309
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:53,771
we'd help at the animal shelter,

310
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,740
to give back.

311
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:58,609
Because there's always someone
who's got it worse than you do.

312
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:04,649
{bell ringing}
I'm a little confused.

313
00:11:04,716 --> 00:11:06,217
I understand.

314
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:09,887
You're probably wondering, what
exactly does Sue Sylvester mean

315
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:11,989
when she says,
"I'm your new therapist"?

316
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:14,125
Well, let me explain.

317
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:16,961
As you may or may not know, I
star in a little music video

318
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:18,929
that's been circulating
around the Web.

319
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:20,398
A video that has
a tendency to induce

320
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:21,766
cruel, slow-motion laughter.

321
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,234
No, no, didn't-didn't
know about that.

322
00:11:23,302 --> 00:11:24,669
Well, this video

323
00:11:24,736 --> 00:11:27,672
has inspired Sue Sylvester
to start giving back.

324
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:29,607
I happen to have my Masters
in counseling,

325
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:31,976
and when I heard that
our school district's

326
00:11:32,044 --> 00:11:35,079
one and only psychologist
had committed suicide,

327
00:11:35,147 --> 00:11:38,015
well, I decided to volunteer
my services.

328
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,383
And they gave
me your name.

329
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:40,918
I'd really like to help.

330
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:43,587
I don't know how I'm supposed
to feel about this.

331
00:11:43,655 --> 00:11:45,289
Ella, you're crippled
by mental illness.

332
00:11:45,357 --> 00:11:47,058
Your compulsions
have estranged you

333
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,793
from your own feelings.

334
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,929
You nearly married a gym teacher
who's more gravy than man.

335
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:55,199
And you're content
to be repeatedly lied to

336
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:57,468
by the man
you purport to love.
I'm sorry?

337
00:11:57,536 --> 00:11:59,337
I bribed
Will Schuester's landlord

338
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:00,738
to slip baby monitors
under his couch,

339
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:02,206
and under his bed.

340
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:03,808
Turns out he's been having
make out sessions

341
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,644
with the coach from
Vocal Adrenaline,

342
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:09,447
and sleepovers with that
world-class banana magnet

343
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:10,681
April Rhodes.
Oh, my God.

344
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:12,083
You need to make a bold move.

345
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,587
You suck.

346
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:17,855
Excuse me?

347
00:12:17,923 --> 00:12:19,857
You take weird little strides
when you walk,

348
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:21,692
as if you were raised
in imperial Japan

349
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,927
and someone bound your feet.

350
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:24,929
You make a valid point.

351
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:26,697
Grow a pair.
I'm insulting you.

352
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:29,633
You refuse to stand up
for yourself,

353
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:31,268
you're so afraid
of confrontation.

354
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:32,436
You're right.

355
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:33,738
If you want to get better,

356
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:36,006
you need to start communicating
your feelings.

357
00:12:36,074 --> 00:12:39,176
You need to let
Will Schuester know
how he's made you feel,

358
00:12:39,244 --> 00:12:41,412
and in a public setting,
so he can'escape,

359
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,813
and he won't
manipulate you.

360
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,048
Trust me--

361
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:46,584
you need to let him have it.

362
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:49,587
<i>RACHEL:
Do you know that when we dated,
the rest of the school</i>

363
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:50,855
gave us a nickname?

364
00:12:50,922 --> 00:12:52,523
Puckleberry.

365
00:12:52,591 --> 00:12:53,791
That's humiliating.

366
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:56,861
The fact is that
slumming it with me

367
00:12:56,928 --> 00:12:58,362
actually improved
your reputation.

368
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,432
It gave you a sense of humanity.

369
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,467
Wait-- do you want
to date again?

370
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:05,403
I was wondering why
you invited me here.

371
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,104
As you know, I'm taken.

372
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:09,039
But I can be of
some assistance.

373
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:11,308
Help me with my song for
Glee Club. I might be

374
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:13,411
the last chance
you have to salvage

375
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:15,713
what's left of
your reputation,
and stay in Glee.

376
00:13:15,781 --> 00:13:17,081
Besides, you need a song

377
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:19,016
that going to help you
express your inner pain.

378
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:20,918
So what song do you want to do
for your assignment?

379
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:23,754
I've chosen David Geddes'
fantastically terrible

380
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:25,823
'70s top ten hit--
"Run Joey Run."

381
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:27,958
It's a story song.

382
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:29,427
So we get to play parts.

383
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:31,395
I'm going to play the role
of the tragic heroine

384
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:32,663
who dies in the end,

385
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:34,131
<i>ÃƒÂ¡ la Nicole Kidman
in Moulin Rouge.</i>

386
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,000
And you can be the
hunky, heroic male lead.

387
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,334
Do I get to kill you?

388
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:39,870
Actually, my dad shoots
me with a shotgun.

389
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:41,739
{sighs}

390
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:45,009
Do you think I made
that Glist? Honestly.

391
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:47,578
Well, it does sound like
something that you would do.

392
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:49,647
God, I'm so tired of people
judging me

393
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:51,148
for a few mistakes I've made.

394
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:52,917
I try to be
a good guy.

395
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:56,253
I go to school and I say,
"Be cool, Puck. Be nice."

396
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,689
But by second period, I've got
a fire extinguisher in my hands

397
00:13:58,757 --> 00:14:00,291
and I'm spraying
some dweeb with it

398
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:02,493
and I don't know
how I got there.

399
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:04,829
I understand. Yeah.

400
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:08,199
I sit in Glee Club
and I watch

401
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:10,501
a couple of imperfect
performances

402
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:14,271
and a litany of criticisms
just start building up
inside of me like a volcano

403
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,207
and I keep telling myself
to hold it in

404
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:17,975
and then it just
comes bursting out.

405
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:20,277
Granted, generally
I'm right,

406
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:22,613
but doesn't do much
for my reputation.

407
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:24,415
It does suck when you do that.

408
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:34,525
So, uh, how do you think
we can get people to
see us differently?

409
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:37,161
I don't know.

410
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:42,933
I can't-- I can't do this.

411
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:45,736
You know, whoever made
ÃƒÂ£ that Glist is going to
put you at number one

412
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:49,173
when they find out you cheated
on that Jessie kid with me.

413
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:52,710
Besides, Jessie will never
fully understand what it
means to be a Jew.

414
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,648
Noah...

415
00:14:57,716 --> 00:14:59,984
I'm ironically turned on
by your bad boy image,

416
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:01,986
but I think we should
just keep this professional.

417
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:03,821
All right, I'm out.

418
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:06,390
Why should I stay if there's
no chance of us making out?

419
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:10,861
Noah, please come and sit down
and let's work on the project.

420
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:12,897
Okay, it'll help us both.

421
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:14,899
I promise.

422
00:15:18,263 --> 00:15:19,763
- {bell rings}
- I don't think I can do this.

423
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:21,131
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

424
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,800
Stop thinking about him
and do it for yourself.

425
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:26,003
Okay, let's do this.

426
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:27,938
Nah, can't go in
the teacher's lounge.

427
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:30,341
Lots of cruel, slow-motion
laughter going on in there.

428
00:15:30,408 --> 00:15:32,643
Well, look who it is.

429
00:15:32,711 --> 00:15:34,645
I thought I smelled
a laughingstock.

430
00:15:34,713 --> 00:15:37,381
Don't start with me
Castle, or I will kick
you square in the taco.

431
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:38,949
It's a date.

432
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:42,353
That's just a typical
Saturday night in
the Castle condo.

433
00:15:47,592 --> 00:15:49,860
I think it's mornings...
Yeah.

434
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:50,928
Go get 'em.

435
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:53,797
Some days you...

436
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,500
That's okay.

437
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,037
Excuse me.

438
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:04,174
Oh, hey, Em, can you
just give us a sec?

439
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:05,376
Actually no.

440
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:07,745
Will, I can't give you a sec.

441
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:09,279
You're just going
to have to reschedul

442
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:10,881
your heavy petting session with
Mrs. Carlisle for a later time.

443
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,116
Emma!

444
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:14,551
I beg your pardon?

445
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:16,020
I was just telling
Mr. Schuester

446
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:19,456
about how my husband
recently died.

447
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:21,025
Wow.

448
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:23,861
Getting them fresh off the
rebound now, aren't you?

449
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:26,930
Amazing. Nobody's safe.
Nobody is safe.

450
00:16:26,998 --> 00:16:29,233
Emma, can I talk
to you in private?
No, you can't.

451
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,335
Will, we're going to talk
about this here and now,

452
00:16:31,403 --> 00:16:32,770
because I have absolutely
nothing to hide.

453
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:35,272
Actually, did you know
I was seeing a therapist?

454
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,141
Do you know that? Did you
know I've been trying

455
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,909
to work through my OCD
so I could be with you?

456
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,844
Will, do you think
that's fun for me?

457
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:42,413
It's not fun; it's
absolutely humiliating.

458
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,649
And come to find out
you've been fooling around

459
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:46,683
with some woman
named Shelby,

460
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:47,918
and you slept
with April Rhodes.

461
00:16:47,986 --> 00:16:50,254
How did you find out
about that?

462
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:51,555
You're not denying it.

463
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:52,956
Wow, okay.

464
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:54,625
See, I thought we were trying
to work through this.

465
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:56,593
I thought when you said you
were trying to figure out things

466
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:58,929
on your own, I thought
you meant that.

467
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:01,131
I'm not going to stand
for this anymore.

468
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,633
I'm not. I'm putting
my foot down,

469
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,701
and I am finally
sticking up for myself.

470
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,137
You're a slut, Will.

471
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:09,440
You're a slut.

472
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:11,708
You're a slut, you're a slut,
you're a slut.

473
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:13,444
Everybody should know that.

474
00:17:13,511 --> 00:17:15,779
And you should know that
I'm through with you.

475
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,350
I'm very sorry for your loss.

476
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:27,524
{bell ringing}

477
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:39,336
Looks like we got
a full house, y'all.

478
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:41,071
I'm kind of getting
cold feet here.

479
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:42,206
Can you even
feel your feet?

480
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:43,107
Shh!

481
00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:45,809
Team, listen up.

482
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:48,212
If we pull this off, we will be
legends at this school.

483
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,680
We'll rocket
up the Glist.

484
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:51,081
We will be top-five, easy.

485
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:52,649
Artie, pump up the jam.

486
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:54,651
It's about to go down.

487
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,824
You can't touch this.

488
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:06,063
¶¶ My, my, my music hits me
so hard ¶¶
¶¶ Can't touch this ¶¶

489
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:07,698
¶¶ Makes me say, oh, my Lord ¶¶

490
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:09,133
¶¶ Thank you for blessing me ¶¶

491
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,502
¶¶ With a mind to rhyme
and two hype feet ¶¶

492
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:13,270
¶¶ It feels good,
when you know you're down ¶¶

493
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:14,938
¶¶ A super dope homeboy
from the Oaktown ¶¶

494
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:16,640
¶¶ And I'm known as such ¶¶

495
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,076
¶¶ And this is a beat,
uh, you can't touch ¶¶

496
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:21,111
¶¶ I told you, homeboy ¶¶

497
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,147
¶¶ Can't touch this ¶¶

498
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:25,983
¶¶ Yo, let me bust
this funky lyric ¶¶
¶¶ Can't touch this ¶¶

499
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,018
¶¶ Fresh new kicks advance,
you gotta like that ¶¶

500
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:29,720
¶¶ Now you know you wanna dance ¶¶

501
00:18:29,787 --> 00:18:31,255
¶¶ So move, outta your seat ¶¶

502
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:33,323
¶¶ And get a fly girl
and catch this beat ¶¶

503
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:35,025
¶¶ While it's rolling,
hold on ¶¶

504
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,494
¶¶ Pump a little bit and let
'em know it's going on ¶¶

505
00:18:37,562 --> 00:18:38,829
¶¶ Like that, like that ¶¶

506
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:40,531
¶¶ Cold on a mission
so fall them back ¶¶

507
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:42,266
¶¶ Let 'em know
that you're too much ¶¶

508
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,234
¶¶ And this is a beat, uh,
you can't touch ¶¶

509
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:46,570
<i>¶¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶¶</i>

510
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:50,340
<i>¶¶ Yo, I told you,
can't touch this ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶¶</i>

511
00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:52,910
<i>¶¶ You can't touch this ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, oh, oh ¶¶</i>

512
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:56,346
<i>¶¶ Damn, you can't touch this ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, oh, oh ¶¶</i>

513
00:18:56,414 --> 00:19:00,918
<i>¶¶ I told you, can't touch this ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶¶</i>

514
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:04,221
<i>¶¶ Too high,
you can't touch this ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, oh, oh ¶¶</i>

515
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:07,024
¶¶ Yo, we out of here,
can't touch this. ¶¶

516
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:08,325
{gasping}

517
00:19:10,595 --> 00:19:11,595
Here it comes.

518
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:16,333
That was very cute.

519
00:19:16,401 --> 00:19:17,801
I'm gonna talk to my pastor

520
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:21,838
and see if I can't get
you kids to perform that

521
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:23,941
for our Sunday service.

522
00:19:28,694 --> 00:19:30,828
, I don't like doing this
any more than you do,

523
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:32,463
but if I don't find out
who made that Glist

524
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:33,631
and stop another one
from being published,

525
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:34,665
the whole Glee Club's
going down.

526
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:36,167
And I can't
let that happen.

527
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:38,403
Look, I know I've been
kind of angry lately,

528
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,872
and sometimes I kick over
chairs and stuff,
but I didn't do it.

529
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:43,307
All the pieces fit, Finn.
You have a very big axe to grind

530
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,809
with several people
on that Glist.

531
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:47,512
Quinn broke your heart, Puck
betrayed your friendship,

532
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:49,247
you're dealing with Kurt's
dad dating your mom,

533
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,915
and I happen to know you've
had your ups and downs

534
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,316
with Santana and Brittany...

535
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:54,185
I have nothing against Santana,
and I like Brittany.

536
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:55,953
Quinn's the one who has
a beef with them.

537
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:58,556
Well, there are an awful lot
of Cheerios! on that Glist.

538
00:19:58,624 --> 00:19:59,624
Isn't it true
that you still feel like

539
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:00,992
an outcast in that group?

540
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,893
I don't know what
you're talking about.

541
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,494
I like being a Cheerio.

542
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:05,797
And why does everyone just
assume I'm angry all the time?

543
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:08,366
It's called being sassy,
Mr. Shue.

544
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:10,168
It's simple math,
Mr. Shue.

545
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:12,203
The Glists are posted at a
height of five and a half feet,

546
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:13,938
comfortably out of my reach.
It could not have been me.

547
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,573
And I have it on
good word that...

548
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:18,076
I saw Puckutting up the Glist
in the hallway.
I was moving it!

549
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:20,244
Somebody put it up on
Rachel's locker, so I moved it.

550
00:20:20,312 --> 00:20:22,113
I was being a man,
doing the right thing.

551
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:24,148
Puck, at some point,
the lies are going to stop,

552
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:25,550
and you're going to start
to sing.

553
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:27,185
If I did it, why would
I put myself at number three?

554
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:29,087
As far as bad-asses go,
I'm number wha.

555
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:30,788
I'll say it again,
I didn't do it!

556
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,623
I don't know
how to turn on a computer.

557
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:33,724
Rachel did it.

558
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,126
Think about it:
I stole the guy

559
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,295
she's in love with,
then I stole the guy she dated

560
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,896
to get over the guy
she's in love with.

561
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:41,365
And I'm kind of a bitch to her.
Just doesn't seem like Rachel.

562
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,634
She's gone behind
your back before.

563
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:46,370
And I mean, who's to say that
there's only one culprit?

564
00:20:46,438 --> 00:20:48,072
Look, I know you know something!

565
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,108
So we're not leaving here
until I get some answers.

566
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:53,010
Mr. Schuester, may I be blunt?

567
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:55,613
{sighs}

568
00:20:55,681 --> 00:20:57,715
Shoot.

569
00:20:57,783 --> 00:20:59,650
Ever since you separated
from your wife,

570
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,319
you've spent a lot
of late nights

571
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:03,988
<i>watching reruns of
Law and Order, haven't you?</i>

572
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:07,091
Hmm. Thought so.

573
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:09,060
And no, I didn't make the Glist.

574
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:10,561
{sighs}

575
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:11,996
Right.

576
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:16,234
{bell ringing}

577
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:17,735
We're as menacing
as Muppet Babies.

578
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:19,470
Which means our
squeaky-clean reputations

579
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:21,506
are still very much intact.

580
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,241
We have to do
what we've been dreading,

581
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:25,543
something more terrifying
than Rachel's personality--

582
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:28,546
We have to go to Sylvester

583
00:21:28,614 --> 00:21:29,747
<i>and admit that we
posted the Physical video.</i>

584
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:31,482
But we'll get suspended.

585
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,917
And it will be worth it.

586
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:34,051
Finally the entire
student body

587
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,454
will see us as bad-asses.

588
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:44,228
<i>Dear Journal, I don't know
how much longer</i>

589
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:46,631
<i>I can take the humiliation.</i>

590
00:21:46,698 --> 00:21:49,967
<i>The video has just surpassed
three million hits.</i>

591
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:53,104
<i>Is my misery some kind
of karmic retribution</i>

592
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:54,772
<i>for the way
I've treated people?</i>

593
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,806
{phone ringing}

594
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:02,313
You're go for Sue.

595
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:04,115
Hello? Sue?

596
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:06,784
<i>It's Olivia Newton-John,
star of Grease--</i>

597
00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:09,187
the most successful movie
musical of all time.

598
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:12,823
Nice try.
And that's a ridiculous accent.

599
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:14,392
Uh...

600
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,562
<i>Journal, I've learned
my lesson.</i>

601
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:21,566
<i>Sue Sylvester's gotta start
playing nice full-time.</i>

602
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,034
{phone rings}

603
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:32,476
Hi! Uh, we must have
been cut off.

604
00:22:32,544 --> 00:22:33,978
It's Olivia Newton-John.

605
00:22:34,046 --> 00:22:35,947
I released a record
seven-consecutive

606
00:22:36,014 --> 00:22:36,981
number one singles.

607
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:38,516
Sing something.

608
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:40,985
¶¶ Let's get physical ¶¶

609
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:42,253
¶¶ Physical... ¶¶

610
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,755
That song was the best-selling

611
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,190
record of the '80s.

612
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:48,326
Listen, Sue, I'm headed
for a ribbon-cutting ceremony

613
00:22:48,393 --> 00:22:51,195
at a sanctuary
for orphaned koalas,

614
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:53,564
but I heard my daughter Chloe
laughing at something

615
00:22:53,632 --> 00:22:55,166
on the Internet the other day,

616
00:22:55,234 --> 00:22:57,068
and I saw your video.

617
00:22:57,135 --> 00:22:59,136
And I just have to ask,

618
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:00,838
whatever would possess a person

619
00:23:00,906 --> 00:23:02,073
to do something like that?

620
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,908
Well, I gotta tell you, Olivia,

621
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:06,644
that video was never meant
for public consumption.

622
00:23:06,712 --> 00:23:08,779
Some people enjoy videotaping
themselves

623
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:10,581
being intimate with a partner.

624
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:12,850
I happen to enjoy revisiting
the impeccable form

625
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:15,152
of my various jazzercise
routines.

626
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,754
Well, it got me thinking.

627
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:19,056
You know, that song was
the biggest hit of my career.

628
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:21,192
"Physical" spent ten weeks
at number one.

629
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,360
It's a classic.

630
00:23:22,427 --> 00:23:23,694
I agree.

631
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:26,530
Unfortunately, I botched
the video, which,

632
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:29,433
by the way, was one of the first
music videos ever.

633
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:31,902
But I filled it with obese guys
in spandex,

634
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,739
and it went over the top,
and the song went with it.

635
00:23:34,806 --> 00:23:36,907
But I saw
your YouTube video, Sue,

636
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:38,676
and I realized that now
is the time

637
00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:40,278
to save it--
and possibly you.

638
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:42,613
I'll be in Ohio tomorrow
chairing

639
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:44,682
a benefit for Save the
Rainforests at King's Island.

640
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,852
I don't understand.

642
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:55,826

00:23:57,329 --> 00:23:58,562
Will Schuester?
Yeah.

644
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,464
I'm Brenda Castle.

645
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:02,800
I'm the new astronomy teacher
and badminton coach.

646
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:04,669
I also happen
to be an alcoholic,

647
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:07,004
and... I like pills.

648
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,739
I hear that's
just your type.

649
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:10,441
Let's go in this classroom
and pork!

650
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:11,709
No.

651
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,613
I am praying
for you, William.

652
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:18,215
We've all heard
about your gallivanting!

653
00:24:18,283 --> 00:24:20,318
But nothing happened!

654
00:24:20,385 --> 00:24:22,086
Maybe that's not
what matters, Will.

655
00:24:22,154 --> 00:24:23,921
You broke the heart
of somebody

656
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:25,589
who doesn't let people
get close to her.

657
00:24:25,657 --> 00:24:26,924
I didn't mean
to hurt anybody.

658
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:28,693
You probably didn't mean
to hurt me, either,

659
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,062
but lately I've been feeding
my feelings to the tune

660

Slut.

663
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:44,799
Remember-- if Sylvester
hits you in the fbce

664
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:46,334
after you cop
to posting the video,

665
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:47,702
don't scream like a woman.

666
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,470
You're so brave
for doing this, Kurt.

667
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:51,673
I know. Thank you.

668
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,374
Oh, my God...

669
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:03,718
Coach Sylvester, can I have just
a minute of your time?

670
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:05,119
What do you want, ladyface?

671
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,922
You're aware a tape was leaked

672
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,657
onto the Internet,
causing you to become

673
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:11,159
a national laughingstock?

674
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:13,161
We stole the tape from your
syringe-and-pill drawer.

675
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:14,629
We posted it online.

676
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:16,497
We'll accept whatever punishment
you see fit.

677
00:25:16,565 --> 00:25:18,266
So it was you.

678
00:25:19,535 --> 00:25:21,903
I can't thank you enough.

She wasn't angry at all.</i>

It was weird.

681
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:31,612
Maybe the comments
online have gotten

682
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,015
so mean, people have started
to feel sorry for her.

683
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,249
She's finally getting
some sympathy,

684
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:37,318
so she's in a
forgiving mood.

685
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:38,553
Wait a second.

686
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,154

I'd like to say
a few words first.

that a motion picture

00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,654
¶¶ He's got a gun,
so run, Joey!" ¶¶

778
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,557
¶¶ Joey, run! ¶¶

779
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:12,526
¶¶ Daddy, please don't ¶¶

780
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:16,731
¶¶ It wasn't his fault,
he means so much to me ¶¶

781
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:18,499
¶¶ Daddy, please don't ¶¶

782
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,668
¶¶ We're gonna get married ¶¶

783
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,037
¶¶ Just you wait and see ¶¶

784
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,908
JESSIE:
¶¶ Got in my car and drove
like mad ¶¶

785
00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:30,511
¶¶ Till I reached Julie's place ¶¶

786
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:34,548
¶¶ She ran to me,
with tear-filled eyes ¶¶

787
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:37,418
¶¶ And bruises on her face ¶¶

788
00:30:37,486 --> 00:30:41,022
¶¶ All at once, I saw him there ¶¶

789
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,324
¶¶ Sneaking up behind me ¶¶

790
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:44,759
¶¶ Watch out! ¶¶

791
00:30:44,826 --> 00:30:47,295
¶¶ Then Julie yelled,
"He's got a gun!" ¶¶

792
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:49,964
¶¶ And she stepped
in front of me ¶¶

793
00:30:50,032 --> 00:30:54,268
¶¶ Then, suddenly,
a shot rang out ¶¶

794
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:57,004
¶¶ And I saw Julie falling ¶¶

795
00:30:57,072 --> 00:31:00,841
¶¶ I ran to her,
I held her close ¶¶

796
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:03,911
¶¶ When I looked down,
my hands were red ¶¶

797
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:06,647
¶¶ And here's the last words ¶¶

798
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:09,016
¶¶ Julie said... ¶¶

799
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:13,587
¶¶ Daddy, please don't,
it wasn't his fault ¶¶

800
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:15,990
¶¶ He means so much to me ¶¶

801
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:18,793
¶¶ Daddy, please don't ¶¶

802
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,562
¶¶ We're gonna get married... ¶¶

803
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:26,434
{angelic chorus vocalizing}

804
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,310
¶¶ Run, Joey, run, Joey, run ¶¶

805
00:31:36,378 --> 00:31:39,747
¶¶ Joey, run, Joey, run ¶¶

806
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:47,455
¶¶ Joey, run, Joey, run! ¶¶

807
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:49,056
{song ends}

808
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:03,437
Well, why don't we just, um,
take a moment

809
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,606
to really absorb
what we've just watched.

810
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:06,974
This is garbage!
Finn!

811
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:09,176
No, he's right.
First of all, I need to trust

812
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:10,711
my instincts more
because I had a feeling

813
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:12,279
when we were shooting that, that
it was not going to be good.

814
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,315
Why didn't you tell me
they were in this, too?

815
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:15,850
I thought you
and I were going out.

816
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:17,017
Being triple-cast
with two other guys

817
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:18,786
to play opposite
your girlfriend?

818
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:19,887
It's mortifying.

819
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:21,489
It was an artistic statement.

820
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:22,923
FINN:
No. it wasn't!
It was you

821
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:24,125
trying to look like

822
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,826
you had a bunch of guys fighting
over you

823
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:27,328
so you could stop looking like
some kind

824
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:28,696
of outcast and be seen

825
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:31,265
as some hot slutty girl singer!

826
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:33,667
How could you do this to me;

827
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:35,169
to all us guys?

828
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:36,504
Is your stupid reputation
more important

829
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:37,505
than your relationships?

830
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,143
Jessie, wait!

831
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:54,296
JEAN:
I saw your video, Sue!
You were fabulous!

832
00:32:54,364 --> 00:32:55,264
You know, I have

833
00:32:55,331 --> 00:32:56,532
to thank you, Jean.

834
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,467
You always know exactly
what to say to me

835
00:32:58,535 --> 00:32:59,902
when I lose my way.

836
00:32:59,969 --> 00:33:02,571
Turns out all I needed
was an attitude change.

837
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:05,240
I forgot how good
it feels to give back.

838
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:07,142
I've spent
so much time worrying

839
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,877
about what other people
thought about me,

840
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,846
when there's really
only one person in the world

841
00:33:10,914 --> 00:33:12,014
I want to impress.

842
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:13,048
Who?

843
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,816
Who? You, silly.

844
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:16,185
So, yesterday,
I walked

845
00:33:16,252 --> 00:33:18,420
back into that teachers' lounge,

846
00:33:18,488 --> 00:33:22,024
and I calmly informed them
of my unlikely skyrocket

847
00:33:22,091 --> 00:33:24,059
to showbiz fame,
and very gently

848
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:28,030
told them all I just didn't care
what they thought about me.

849
00:33:28,097 --> 00:33:30,299
What's that? Oh, look.

850
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:33,402
Sue Sylvester is a top 700
recording artist, people!

851
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,637
Who's laughing now, huh?

852
00:33:35,705 --> 00:33:37,272
Now, since Olivia is giving

853
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,042
her cut of the proceeds
to injured manatees,

854
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:41,543
I've decided to give

855
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:43,779
all of my profits
to this nursing home.

856
00:33:43,846 --> 00:33:45,414
It's not going to be much.

857
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,182
Olivia totally screwed me
in negotiations.

858
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,450
I won't be working

859
00:33:48,518 --> 00:33:50,185
with her again, but
it should be enough

860
00:33:50,253 --> 00:33:52,487
for a couple of benches out back
for the summer.

861
00:33:52,555 --> 00:33:54,957
Maybe a little vegetable garden
for you to putter ound in.

862
00:33:55,024 --> 00:33:56,792
That'd be nice.

863
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:58,327
Yeah.

864
00:33:58,394 --> 00:34:00,329
Now, after all these years,
how is it

865
00:34:00,396 --> 00:34:03,031
that you still know so much more
about everything than I do?

866
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:04,399
I'm the smart one.

867
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:05,534
{chuckles}

868
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:06,668
You got the looks, too.

869
00:34:06,736 --> 00:34:07,803
How is that fair?

870
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,271
Ah, thank you.

871
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,673
{laughs} Let's say we
crack open a book, huh?

872
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:13,141
Okay.

873
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:14,376
See that-- the
two little bears?

874
00:34:14,444 --> 00:34:15,744
That's you and I.
That's right.

875
00:34:15,812 --> 00:34:17,746
I'm the big one, right?
And I'm the small one.

876
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:18,780
Yeah, you're the tiny one.

877
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:19,915
And what does that say?

878
00:34:19,983 --> 00:34:21,450
"I always love you."

879
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,885
"And I will always
love you."

880
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,889
{bell ringing}

881
00:34:32,228 --> 00:34:33,595
{knocks gently}
Hey.

882
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,066
Uh, these are for you.

883
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,238
They're lovely.

884
00:34:43,306 --> 00:34:44,473
Thank you.

885
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:47,943
{clears throat}

886
00:34:48,011 --> 00:34:51,580
Um... I-I messed up, Emma.

887
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:53,315
I think,
in all of this

888
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,851
{inhales deeply}
"discovering who I am" business,

889
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,420
I took a couple of wrong turns.

890
00:34:58,488 --> 00:35:00,822
And I get how those detours

891
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,125
might have hurt you.

892
00:35:03,192 --> 00:35:06,662
But now I know
that that's not who I am

893
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,064
or who I want to be.

894
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,567
I know what's supposed
to happen now.

895
00:35:12,635 --> 00:35:14,202
I'm supposed to smile

896
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,638
and be impressed by how in touch
you are with your feelings

897
00:35:16,706 --> 00:35:19,074
and moon over the fact
that you care about me so much,

898
00:35:19,142 --> 00:35:22,511
but, um...

899
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,146
I can't.

900
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,383
But, Emily, th-this is...
this is killing me.

901
00:35:28,451 --> 00:35:29,918
I just...

902
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,688
{sighs}

903
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,923
I want you to look at me
the way you used to.

904
00:35:38,027 --> 00:35:39,928
I can't.
{clears throat}

905
00:35:42,165 --> 00:35:43,899
But you know what,
that's a good thing.

906
00:35:43,966 --> 00:35:45,801
Really, if this relationship
is ever going to work

907
00:35:45,868 --> 00:35:47,703
between the two of us,
we have to start

908
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,705
seeing each other
for who we really are.

909
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:55,010
Thank you for the flowers.

910
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,068
I know you're behind the Glist.

911
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,903
You have no proof.
I can't believe

912
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,272
that you're going to pin this
on me. I'll be expelled.

913
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,907
I mean, it makes sense.

914
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,709
Everything else
has been taken from me--

915
00:36:27,777 --> 00:36:30,245
my popularity, my body.

916
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,647
Might as well throw away
my education.

917
00:36:32,715 --> 00:36:34,082
You know when I realized
that you did it?

918
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:36,918
The moment I felt
what it was like

919
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,453
to walk in your shoes.

920
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:40,822
I mean, it takes years
to build a good reputation,

921
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,257
but only seconds to destroy it.

922
00:36:43,693 --> 00:36:45,994
Couple bad choices,
and you go from the top

923
00:36:46,062 --> 00:36:47,229
to the bottom.

924
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,835
You have lost so much, Quinn.

925
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,706
Which means you had the most
to gain from the Glist.

926
00:37:00,576 --> 00:37:02,611
I never meant to hurt anybody.

927
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,215
I... I was captain
of the cheerleading squad,

928
00:37:07,283 --> 00:37:09,217
president of the Celibacy Club.

929
00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:10,819
I had Finn.

930
00:37:10,887 --> 00:37:14,022
People would part
like the Red Sea when I walked

931
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,557
down the hallway.

932
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,125
Now I'm invisible.

933
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,861
And you think being seen
as a cheap tramp is better?

934
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:22,898
A bad reputation is better
than no reputation at all.

935
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:25,534
Look, I know
that high school feels

936
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:26,902
like your whole life right now,

937
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:28,303
but it's going to end.

938
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,505
You're going to give
that baby to a family

939
00:37:30,573 --> 00:37:32,741
who really wants it,
who's going to love it,

940
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:35,911
and then you are going to go on
to do amazing things, Quinn.

941
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:40,148
You really think that I
can get it all back one day?

942
00:37:41,818 --> 00:37:43,351
{sighs}

943
00:37:45,588 --> 00:37:46,788
No.

944
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,226
I think you can get
something even better.

945
00:37:51,294 --> 00:37:53,261
I mean, come on.
You're Quinn Fabray, right?

946
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:54,362
I mean, those
people didn't part

947
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,697
when you walked down the halls;

948
00:37:55,765 --> 00:37:57,499
you moved them
with your attitude.

949
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:00,202
Thanks, Mr. Shue.

950
00:38:01,671 --> 00:38:02,971
You're a really good teacher--

951
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,507
even if everybody
is calling you a man-whore.

952

FIGGINS:
You wanted to see me,
William?

953
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:08,610
I trust you
have come up

954
00:38:08,678 --> 00:38:11,313
with the perpetrators
of the Glist.

955
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,681
I, um... I grilled

956
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,583
every single one
of my students,

957
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,119
and, uh... no one.

958
00:38:18,187 --> 00:38:19,721
No one copped
to making the Glist.

959
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:22,791
They all closed ranks
and wouldn't rat out who did it.

960
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:24,493
That's poppycock, Will.

961
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,128
I will not let this school
be held hostage

962
00:38:27,196 --> 00:38:28,630
by juvenile shenanigans.

963
00:38:28,698 --> 00:38:31,466
I know, but... I mean,
your point has been made.

964
00:38:31,534 --> 00:38:32,968
The Glists have stopped.

965
00:38:33,035 --> 00:38:34,569
I think we should just

966
00:38:34,637 --> 00:38:36,004
call this a victory
and move on.

967
00:38:40,843 --> 00:38:42,511
Fine.

968
00:38:42,578 --> 00:38:44,713
I'm still praying for you, Will.

969
00:38:51,988 --> 00:38:53,421
Thank you.

{bell ringing}

971
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:04,366
Hi.

972
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:06,067
Are you still mad at me?

973
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,536
You know,
before I transferred here

974
00:39:07,603 --> 00:39:09,204
to make you my girlfriend,
I asked around about you,

975
00:39:09,272 --> 00:39:11,039
found out your rep,
what kind of girl you were.

976
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:12,374
What did they say?
Most of them

977
00:39:12,441 --> 00:39:13,542
had no idea who you were.

978
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:15,010
The ones that did
said you

979
00:39:15,077 --> 00:39:16,845
were kind of sneaky hot,
but that that quality

980
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:18,813
was canceled out
by a compulsive need to be right

981
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:20,148
and a strange affinity

982
00:39:20,216 --> 00:39:21,449
for sweaters
with animals on them.

983
00:39:21,517 --> 00:39:22,851
The most
interesting part was...

984
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:25,120
that, even though no one
particularly liked you,

985
00:39:25,187 --> 00:39:27,455
they all said you were a person
who could be trusted.

986
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:28,890
I still am.

987
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:32,260
I have this pathological need
to be popular, okay?

988
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,864
I... I just want people to think
I'm cool so bad sometimes

989
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:37,699
that it just clouds
my judgment. Okay?

990
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,334
As a fellow star
in the making, I'm...

991
00:39:39,402 --> 00:39:40,502
I'm sure you
can understand that.

992
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:41,937
On that level, sure.

993
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,972
But as the guy
who gave up everything

994
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,942
to be your one and only,
I just can't see past this.

995
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,510
I should have been enough
for you, Rachel.

996
00:39:51,147 --> 00:39:52,847
I knew you'd break my heart.

997
00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:58,353
Well, that's the funny thing
about reputations.

998
00:39:58,421 --> 00:40:00,655
Everyone thinks
I'm the big heartbreaker,

999
00:40:00,723 --> 00:40:03,124
but the fact of the matter is...

1000
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,260
you broke mine first.

1001
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:10,165
Do me a favor.

1002
00:40:10,232 --> 00:40:12,167
If we end up next to each other

1003
00:40:12,234 --> 00:40:13,835
on the bar
at Ballet Club this week,

1004
00:40:13,903 --> 00:40:15,704
just do your arabesques
and piquÃƒÂ©s in silence.

1005
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:17,005
Don't talk to me.
