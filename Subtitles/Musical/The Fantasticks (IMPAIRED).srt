(MUSIC PLAYING)

3
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,727
Luisa.

4
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,498
Luisa, are you
coming down soon?

5
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,548
"Kiss number 60."

6
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:37,751
"The kiss upon the eyes."

7
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,987
"The eyelid kiss
is said to produce"

8
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,757
"A unique sensation
of an unworldly nature,"

9
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,960
"Running from
the base of the spine
to the knees."

10
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,507
BELLOMY: Luisa.

11
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,746
What you been
doing up there, dear?

12
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:06,980
Studying.

13
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,749
Well, that's good.

14
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,620
What's that for?

15
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,288
Number 26.

16
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:15,589
Kissing a parent.

17
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,627
Where are you going?

18
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,829
Town.

19
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,731
Before you go,
would you do
your dad a favor

20
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,266
And come over here a second,
let me see how this fits?

21
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:31,472
I always look
like a sick turkey.

22
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:32,706
Ah.

23
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,841
(GROANS)
The neckline is too high.

24
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:34,975
Be careful...

25
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,379
Where did you get that?

26
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,481
That's your
mother's necklace.

27
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,916
I found it in a box of
old letters.

28
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:46,687
You gave it to her,
didn't you?

29
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,393
I can't believe you were
ever that romantic.

30
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,027
Ha!

31
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,696
Did you stand
outside her window

32
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,598
And serenade her
with love songs too?

33
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,867
Mmm.

34
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,068
(GARGLING)

35
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,373
I guess not.

36
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:06,840
There are other things
in the world

37
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,609
As important as
love songs, you know.

38
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,843
Like what?

39
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,112
Like work songs,
that's like what.

40
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,416
Like hymns, anthems, marches.

41
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,317
Dirges.

42
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:19,787
Never mind.

43

(SIGHS)

44
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,060
Papa, I've got to take wing.

45
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,762
Be careful,
it's duck season.

46
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:33,701
I don't suppose your wings

47
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,036
Are going to
carry you anywhere
near that carnival, are they?

48
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,605
What carnival?

49
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:41,842
Luisa.

50
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,547
You look nice in the necklace.

51
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:51,752
(HAMMERING)

52
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,388
Hi, Mr. Hucklebee.

53
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,460
(MOUTHING WORDS)

54
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:01,595
Luisa?

55
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,433
How many times,
since they moved in,

56
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:08,836
Have I told you not to talk
to that idiot next door?

57
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,237
Couple of hundred.

58
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,407
A couple of
hundred times you told me
not to talk to his son either.

59
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:15,443
Good for me.

60
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:16,810
And no carnival.

61
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:28,989
* I'd like to swim
In a clear blue stream

62
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:32,960
* Where the water is icy cold

63
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:37,465
* Then go to town
In a golden gown

64
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:41,001
* And have my fortune told

65
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:45,072
* Just once, just once

66
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:49,176
* Just once before I am old

67
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,846
* I'd like to be not evil

68
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,751
* But a little worldly wise

69
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:01,622
* To be the kind of
girl designed

70
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:06,627
* To be kissed upon the eyes

71
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:11,632
* I'd like to dance till 2:00

72
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:15,035
* Or sometimes dance till dawn

73
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,506
* Or if the band
could stand it

74
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:22,743
* Just go on and on and on

75
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,647
* Just once, just once

76
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,218
* Before the chance is gone

77
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:37,257
* I'd like to waste
a week or two

78
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,495
* And never do a chore

79
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:44,932
* To wear my hair unfastened

80
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:52,873
* So it billows to the floor

81
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:59,780
* To do the things
I've dreamed about

82
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,150
* But never done before

83
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:07,220
* Perhaps I'm bad
or wild or mad

84
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:10,858
* With lots of grief in store

85
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:14,962
* But I want much more
Than keepin' house

86
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:21,869
* Much more, much more,

87
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:30,878
* Much more!

88
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,697
Where you going?

89
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,065
Uh, got to make sure
the hogs get fed.

90
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:55,903
You're all dressed up.
Got a date with one of them?

91
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,538
I just got to go
the store first
to get the feed.

92
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,843
All right, and pick me up
some of that cough syrup

93
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,845
That puts me right
to sleep, will you?

94
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,148
I got to get back to work.

95
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,058
(EXCLAIMS)
That's one hammer
I'll never see again.

96
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,960
BELLOMY: Oh, yes, you will.

97
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,599
Keep your crud
on your own side!

98
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:29,302
You keep your face
and your damn bricks
out of my side!

99
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,204
Or you'll be
wearing brick earmuffs.

100
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,006
Thief!

101
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,174
Murderer!

102
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,275
Lunkhead!

103
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,945
Fuzz bucket!

104
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,351
He's out of his
mind with love,
that son of mine.

105
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:48,055
Nothing sets
the heart a flutter,
like a good old fashion feud.

106
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,825
What do you think will happen
when they meet on that
road to the carnival?

107
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,662
I don't know.

108
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,664
But they'll never
suspect we planned it.

109
00:09:56,697 --> 00:10:00,067
That son of mine,
he's fantastic.

110
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,936
My daughter is fantastic too.

111
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,773
Just think if they knew
that we wanted them wed.

112
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,340
A pre-arranged marriage?

113
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,242
They'd rather be dead.

114
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,814
Children.

115
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,015
Lovers.

116
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,183
Fantasticks.

117
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,119
Geese.

118
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,188
How cruel ever we are.

119
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,756
How crafty to know

120
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,292
To manipulate children,
you merely say

121
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,828
No.
No.

122
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,197
* Oh!

123
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,101
* Dog's got to bark,
a mule's got to bray

124
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:38,138
* Soldiers must fight
and preachers must pray

125
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:42,309
* And children, I guess,
must get their own way

126
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:45,178
* The minute that you say no

127
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:50,951
* Why did the kids
pour jam on the cat?

128
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:55,088
* Raspberry jam
all over the cat?

129
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:58,992
* Why should the kids
do something like that

130
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,962
* When all that
we said was no?

131
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,955
* Why did the kids
put beans in their ears?

132
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:32,025
* No one can hear
with beans in their ears

133
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:35,763
* After a while
the reason appears

134
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,365
* They did it
'cause we said no

135
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,902
* Your daughter
brings a young man in

136
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,171
* Says "Do you like him, Pa?"

137
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,174
* Just tell her,
"He's a fool"

138
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:51,311
* And then,
you've got a son-in-law

139
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:57,885
* You've got a son-in-law!

140
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:01,221
* Sure as the June
comes right after May!

141
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:05,458
* Sure as the night
comes right after day!

142
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:09,129
* You can be sure
the devil's to pay

143
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:13,200
* The minute that you say no

144
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,168
* No!

145
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:18,005
* Make sure you never say...

146
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:23,210
* No!

147
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,184
Kids.

148
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,886
Won't it be nice,
when our kids are married

149
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,023
So they can drive
each other crazy,
instead of us?

150
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,959
Right. They're nearly there.

151
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:43,330
There just one thing missing
for our hero and heroine,
a climax.

152
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,099
You watch what you say,
you are talking
about my daughter.

153
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,801
And speaking in
theatrical terms

154
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,502
We have to find some way
to end the feud

155
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:52,205
Without them knowing
we made the whole thing up.

156
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,845
Well, how do you
propose we do that?

157
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,479
That's the problem.

158
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,983
Wait a minute.

159
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:06,987
You see?

160
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,155
Whenever you got a problem

161
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,257
The United States
Postal Service
comes to the rescue.

162
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,424
Yeah, they run
a tight shift.

163
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,861
Let's go, Bellomy.
Let's have a talk
with this fellow...

164
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,296
Are you crazy?
We can't go to the carnival,
the kids will see us,

165
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,265
They'll think
we're looking for them.

166
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,867
Instant heat.

167
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,869
I seem to remember
that's good for
romance. Isn't it?

168
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,270
Uh-huh. Uh-ah!

169
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,138
Fuel to the fire.

What light through
yonder window breaks?

178
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:29,169
It is the east,
and Juliet is the sun.

179

Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon.

180
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,342
What if someone sees us?

181
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,177
Come on.

Our fathers.

183
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,646
I don't care
about our fathers.

184

I don't care
about the wall.

* Anyone who would come
between us

* Would have to deal with me

191

* I'd stand and face them all

It's my father.

Must be this one.

MATT: My father too.

237
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,742
They're not
supposed to be here.

238
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,244
Neither are we.

239
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,249
We'll meet tonight,
by the big tree.

240
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,417
In the moonlight.

241
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,551
In moonlight.

242
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,823
It's a century
till moonlight.

243
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,461
I'll never wash
this hand again.

00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:49,302
What the devil...

245
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:50,337
At your service.

246
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,243
Wait, you the famous
El Gallo?

247
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,344
El Gallo.

248
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:00,847
Oh, yeah. See, we got your
advertisement in the mail

249
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,583
And we got ourselves
a little problem.

250
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,385
A love problem.

251
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,554
You two have a love problem?

252
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,790
And you seek sympathy
from our little
band of outcasts.

253
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,859
What would you two be willing
to do in front of an audience?

254
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,163
No, wait a minute...

255
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,464
We are not
talking about us.

256
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,366
We're talking
about our kids.

257
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,100
Who happen to be
a boy and a girl.

258
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,470
Less challenging.
Follow me.

259
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,907
Although we are not
yet fully prepared

260
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,343
The official opening
of the entire carnival,

261
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:32,312
I think we can proceed
with our business here.

262
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:35,348
One moment,
I'll check my files.

263
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,284
I'm sorry,
what did you say
your names were?

264
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,252
Hucklebee.
Bellomy.

265
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:42,455
I do beg your pardon,
this is "N" through "Z."

266
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,191
Yes, there we are,
"A" through "M."
Oh!

267
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,292
How did you do that?

268
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,194
It wasn't easy
it took months to
set up these files.

269
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:48,261
Oh my...

270
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,330
(WHISPERING) Quiet.
I'm beginning to
get a picture.

271
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,866
You said you had
a daughter?

272
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,403
Yes.
I see a girl.

273
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,604
Is her name Luisa?

274
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,805
Is that your
daughter's name.

275
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:01,408
Yes.
That's her. Oh, look.

276
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:05,412
She is standing
next to a young man
who must be, who must be...

277
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,414
Quick, before
the image fades.

278
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,416
Matt.
That's it.

279
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,351
You're amazing.

280
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,353
They seem to be
happy enough.

281
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:14,421
What about the feud?

282
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,423
Of course that's there,
I said "seem."

283
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,691
Obviously your children
are feeling
a great deal of torment.

284
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:19,726
Uncanny.

285
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,262
And you've come to me
for some kind of magic, eh?

286
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,163
You're in luck.

287
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,535
Ooh!

288
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:32,305
Frankly, we came to you
to find out
how to end this feud.

289
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,641
Many paths lead
to the summit.
Follow me.

290
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,846
You know,
we kind of thought
it'd be a good idea

291
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:43,650
If my mild-mannered son
was turned into
a rip-roaring hero.

292
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,252
Really?
Well, yes, that would be

293
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,719
The first thought of
a common rural mind.

294
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,788
And by an amazing coincidence,
it's also mine.

295
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,623
Ah! Boy, are we lucky.

296
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:54,894
Of course to have a hero,
you must first have a villain.

297
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,265
That makes sense. But who?

298
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:02,469
Let's think, the young lady
knows both of you,
so that wouldn't work.

299
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,673
What about you?
Me?

300
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:10,443
Oh, I couldn't
do it, for free.

301
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:12,712
But for a small donation
to my favorite charity...

302
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,814
Yeah.

303
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,587
Yeah.

304
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,823
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

305
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,559
Would $60 be
an insult?

306
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,928
Yes, but I'm used to abuse.

307
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,998
Oh, yes. I see it,
I start to
kidnap his daughter,

308
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,301
Your son runs in to save her.
Then a battle.

309
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,436
I allow the boy to defeat me,
your son becomes a hero,

310
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,005
The parents relent,
the feud is over forever.

311
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,774
She melts into his arms.

312
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,445
How much for such a drama?

313
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,447
That, senor, depends.

314
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,449
Depends on what?
On what else.

315
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:50,917
The quality of the rape.

316
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,989
Rape? No!
No rape!

317
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,791
Oh, very well then,
the abduction.

318
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:01,394
The rape, the chase,
the kidnapping.

319
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,564
Call it what you will,
from the Latin rapere.

320
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,865
Meaning "to seize."

321
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,405
* Abductions, abductions,
Theatrical abductions

322

And fabulous productions

323
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,514

00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,917
* Two lovers are meeting
Their happiness is fleeting

325
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,888
* All at once a bandit man
Is standing there repeating!

326
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,623
* Surrender and so forth

327
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,592
* Give us the girl!
And so forth

328
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,862
* In short they are surrounded
by a gang of angry men

329
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:39,932
* I see it, I see it
A gang of angry men

330
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:45,638
* Heaven
I can assure you
this is heaven

331
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:49,576
* For six,
young love is out of seven

332
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,411
* This is a dream of ecstasy

333
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:54,614
* How can we deny them
such a dream of ecstasy?

334
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,850
* Sounds a bit expensive
I would like to know the fee

335
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:01,621
* The people are cheering,
I'm standing center leering

336
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:05,458
* I wear a cape
and steer a snare
That's really quite endearing

337
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,995
* I enter and so forth
I grab the girl and so forth

338
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:12,665
* I ravish her and start to
carry her into the night

339
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:16,436
* The hero, he sees her,
he grabs the girl
and frees her

340
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,371
* He tries to tweak me
by the nose

341
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,839
* Which certainly
should please her

342
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:23,810
* We argue and so forth
We draw our
swords and so forth

343
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:27,547
* We shout "En garde!"
And fight until
I stagger and I die

344
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,983
* They're fighting, exciting,
El Gallo starts to die

345
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,654
* The parents relenting,
resolve the scene presenting

346
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:38,391
* A prefect picture of content
With both of them consenting

347
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:41,961
* To marriage and so forth
To end the feud and so forth

348
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:45,665
* They swear to
tear the world apart
And live in harmony

349
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:49,168
* The lovers are kissing
The parents reminiscing

350
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,070
* The scene is
one of utter bliss

351
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,005
* With not a cliche missing

352
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,841
* There's laughter
and so forth

353
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,409
* A happy dance and so forth

354
00:22:56,443 --> 00:23:00,447
* Then all at once
A harpist and
a piano start to play

355
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,148
* I hear it
* He hears it

356
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,150
* How beautifully they play

357
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:05,552
* Drama

358
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:06,686
* A stormy night

359
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,721
* What he's offering is drama

360
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:09,956
* A bloody fight

361
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,725
* In my life's faded cyclorama

362
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:13,760
* What a sight

363
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,027
* He tries to shed
a little light

364
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:18,731
* It's so exciting when
you shed a little light

365
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:19,932
* Really

366
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,033
* The lovers kiss

367
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,770
* I must admit
that this is thrilling

368
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:24,871
* Oh, such happiness

369
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,106
* And it can happen
if I'm willing

370
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,107
* How can it miss?

371
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,609
* Just make sure
the price is right

372
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:33,613
* So why be pikers?
Just make sure
the price is right

373
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:34,914
* Why should we be pikers?

374
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,883
* Just make sure
the price is right

375
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,620
* Abductions, abductions
Theatrical abductions

376
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:44,156
* Complete with
maidens in distress
And fabulous productions

377
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,660
* With moonlight, and so forth
A happy end and so forth

378
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:53,500
* And it all depends on one

379
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,502
* It all depends

380
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:56,903
* It all...

381
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:00,907
* Depends on what you pay

382
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,775
* Pay!

383
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:05,177
* Pay!

384
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:06,679
* Olay!

385
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:12,051
First class it is.
Now, let's see.

386
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:14,086
What else should we use?

387
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:18,090
Do you want Jo-Jo
the Chicken Lady?

388
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,727
I don't think so.

389
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,529
I know, the Bavarian baby.

390
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:25,131
I've got one who
is very talented,
he can swallow a sword.

391
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,634
If you throw in $4 extra
he cleans up after himself.

392
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:28,835
What about that act?

393
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:30,002
Which?

394
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:33,272
"Shakespearian company,
direct from London."

395
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,275
"Theatre Royal, Drury Lane."

396
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,144
No. No, you don't want that.

397
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:39,579
Now, instead...

398
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:41,013
I think Shakespeare
is a great idea.

399
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:43,015
After all, my son
thinks he is Romeo.

400
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,817
My daughter would be
a perfect Juliet.

401
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:48,955
Really, gentlemen,
I assure you
it's not a good idea.

402
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,190
Now, for a first
class abduction...

403
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,659
Let me see.

404
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,927
BELLOMY: But Shakespeare,
that's real class.

405
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,629
I was in a Shakespeare
play once.

406
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,731
HUCKLEBEE: Really?
Uh-huh.

407
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:00,166
My daughter would
like Shakespeare.

408
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:04,837
So would my son.
Likes that
I am the Pantomim whatever.

409
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:08,507
And with Shakespeare,
it's sure to be
done in good taste.

410
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:16,783
Sir, the players have arrived.

411
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:19,719
Thank you.
But your services
will not be necessary.

412
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,021
Now or ever.
Back in the trunk.

413
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,256
These men are from London?

414
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,693
Straight from
Theatre Royal, Drury Lane?

415
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,895
Absolutely, one long,
straight ride.

416
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:30,597
Down.

417
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,900
Don't see us as we are.
Gentlemen, please.

418
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:38,137
Remove ten pounds of
road dust from these
aged wrinkled cheeks.

419
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,173
See make-up caked in
glowing powder pink.

420
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:45,277
Imagine a beard, full-blown
and glowing like
the whiskers of a bear.

421
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:48,881
Imagine hair in a box,
I have all colors.

422
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:51,784
Please, I beg of you,
imagine hair.

423
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,093
And not these clothes,
dear God, no, no.

424
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:04,764
Not rags like
every beggar has.

425
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,899
But see me in a doublet.

426
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:09,035
Mortimer, fetch the doublet.

427
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,039
Thank you.

428
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,910
EL GALLO: Gentlemen,
if you insist
on Shakespeare,

429
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,679
My advice is,
don't over-rehearse.

430
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:22,949
Say a cue, you'll see,
I'll know it. Go on, try me.

431
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,918
Friends, Romans,
countrymen.

432
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,019
Is what?

433
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:30,056
Friends, Romans, countrymen.

434
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,257
No, no, no.

435
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,293
Don't tell me,
I'll get it.
You'll see.

436
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:40,332
Oh, yes, of course, of course.
Why, that's easy.

437
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:42,201
Why didn't you pick
a hard one?

438
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,170
Now, here, watch this.

439
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:51,077
Friends, Romans, countrymen.

440
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,882
Screw your courage

441
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:57,884
To that sticking place.

442
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,386
And be not sick.

443
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,056
And pale with reef.

444
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,426
For thou are handmaidens.

445
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,863
But far more fair than she.

446
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:13,199
Is.

447
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:18,705
How was that?

448
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:20,539
Do you think
he can do it?

449
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,875
The chicken lady is cheaper
and you get to keep the eggs.

450
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:25,845
I got faith in the bard,
let's sign him on.

451
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,914
Thank you. Thank you.

452
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,119
Thank you.

453
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,255
Allow me to
introduce myself.

454
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,858
I am Henry Albertson.

455
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,059
BELLOMY: And who is that?

456
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,861
HENRY: That's Mortimer.

457
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,396
He has been with me
all his life.
He does death scenes.

458
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,833
Would you like to see one?
He's an expert.

459
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:49,168
Mortimer,
die for the gentlemen.

460
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,340
(CHOKING)

461
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:04,683
(GROANS)

462
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,361
And that's the short version.

463
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,997
The Indian is
out of the question.

464
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,431
Besides,
I think he is dead.

465
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:22,301
Oh. Too bad, 'cause
they're a team.
Inseparable.

466
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,369
So what could we
use instead?

467
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:26,238
How about Siamese twins.
Two for the price of one.

468
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,440
Nah, we're gonna
stick with Shakespeare.

469
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:31,778
Yeah. It'll be
a lifelong memory
for the children.

470
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:34,313
Lifelong memory it is.

471
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,215
Still not sure about
the Indian.

472
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:39,886
Gentlemen, we must hurry.
We have an abduction to stage.

473
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,088
This very night.

474
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:51,931
Here, you two had
better go home
and rehearse your parts.

475
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:54,200
Parts? We're not actors.

476
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,402
This is too much
to memorize.

477
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:02,809
Not actors, you say.
Very well then.

478
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,744
We'll do the abridged version.

479
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:13,085
* Abductions, abductions
Theatrical abductions

480

It kills the germs.

648
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:39,370
This plum is
too ripe.

649
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:41,506
Sorry.

650
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:47,378
Please don't watch me
while I'm eating.

651
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:49,014
Sorry.

652
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:59,390
* Take away
the golden moonbeam

653
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:03,328
* Take away the tinsel sky

654
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:07,298

oh so scenic

655
00:46:07,332 --> 00:46:10,768

oh so scenic

659
00:46:23,481 --> 00:46:26,417

660
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:31,456
* Take away the sense of drama

661
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:34,359
* Take away the puppet play

662

ALL:
* So take it away
and paint it up right!

669
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:14,299
* So take it away
and decorate it!

670
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:18,436
* So take it away,
that sun is too bright!

671
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:23,374
* I say that
it really is a pity
It used to be so pretty

672

the golden moonbeam

673

* By and by

685
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:09,955
This plum is too ripe!

686
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:11,122
ALL:
* Sorry

687
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:17,328
Tell you one thing,

688
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:20,531
Staying up all night
isn't what it's
cracked up to be.

689
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,067
Well, it might've been
if you hadn't

690
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,601
Sat around yawning
the whole time.

691
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,372
Sorry.

692
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,607
But I had an exhausting
battle, remember?

693
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,010
And what about me?
What did I have?

694
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:38,649
You're not the only ones
who didn't get any
sleep around here.

695
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:41,987
Damn swing creaking all night,
and you two bickering.

696
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,655
Why don't you put
some oil in that thing?

697
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,260
Why don't ya
paint your house?

698
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:51,196
What? What'd he say?

699
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:53,531
It's an eyesore.
Ruins the whole
neighborhood.

700
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:56,267
Neighborhood?
There ain't no
neighborhood around here!

701
00:48:56,301 --> 00:48:58,203
Slopping the pigs
right in front of the house.

702
00:48:58,236 --> 00:49:00,171
While we're at it,
I just assumed everybody

703
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:02,307
Didn't walk through
my corn field singing.

704
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,675
What are you two
fighting about?
This is our argument.

705
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:06,044
What? What'd she say?

706
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:07,712
She said,
"This is our argument!"

707
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:10,015
Well, knock it off,
for crying out loud.

708
00:49:10,048 --> 00:49:13,684
If we thought you
were gonna act like this,
we never would've...

709
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:17,288
I just think that
maybe a "thank you"
might have been in order.

710
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:20,025
Never would've what?

711
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:21,059
(EXHALES)

712
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,064
We never would've let
you stay out all night!

713
00:49:26,097 --> 00:49:29,167
Your father and I,
we treat you like adults.

714
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,170
And you turn around
and you act like
a couple of spoilt kids.

715
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:34,572
Now, I want you two
to kiss and make up.

716
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:36,341
This should be
a beautiful moment.

717
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:37,642
An act of heroism
took place last night.

718
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:39,110
Come on.

719
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:40,245
No expense was spared.

720
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:46,151
Bellomy.

721
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:56,027
Nice going, Bellomy.

722
00:49:56,061 --> 00:50:00,131
Two hundred and fifty
smackers down the drain.

723
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,768
This is just great.

724
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:05,270
MATT: Wait a minute.

725
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:07,105
You two paid for us?

726
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,442
All my heroics
were make believe?

727
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,486
What would you call
a man who would stoop

728
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,521
As low as to do
something like this?

729
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:25,490
A father.

730
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,530
Matt, where are you going?

731
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:34,132
I got a score to settle.

732
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:36,101
Wait, I'm coming with you.

733
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:37,202
Luisa.

734
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:38,803
Luisa.

735
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:43,574
Matt, wait,
I'm coming with you.

736
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:56,554
No refunds.
Even with a receipt.

737
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:02,193
Somebody
get me a sword.

738
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:17,708
(GROANS)

739
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:24,415
En garde!

740
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:35,726
Up a bit with the wrists.

741
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:38,696
A foot back more.

742
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:41,166
Never take your eyes
from your opponent!

743
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,535
Quickly!

744
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:46,704
Aim for the entrails.

745
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,139
Good. Encore.

746
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:53,844
You have great enthusiasm,

747
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:56,447
But as in all things,
experience counts
for everything.

748
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:09,394
(GRUNTING)

749
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:12,463
It's impolite
to attack a man

750
00:52:12,497 --> 00:52:13,831
Once he's in his
space of shaving.

751
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,702
Oh, I forgot.
You don't shave.

752
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:22,139
(GRUNTING)

753
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,478
I'm available for lessons.

754
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:51,836
Matt!

755
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:54,939
This isn't much fun
when you're not being paid.

756
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:58,809
Matt?

757
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:10,588
You... You...

758
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:11,656
Villain.

759
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:14,825
Don't do that.

760
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:18,796
You'll hurt your hand.

761
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:31,409
Nice boy.

762
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,947
Wait.

763
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:38,249
What?

764
00:53:38,283 --> 00:53:40,485
What did you say?

765
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:42,387
I didn't say anything.

766
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,489
Then what
were you thinking?

767
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:46,624
I wasn't
thinking anything.

768
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:50,428
Yes you were. Well,
what are you thinking now?

769
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:53,298
Well...
Go on say it.

770
00:53:53,331 --> 00:53:55,700
I just wanted to tell you,
I think you were right.

771
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:58,703
Right?

772
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,771
Not to pick up
the sword again.

773
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:01,972
Not to fight with him.

774
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:05,543
What I mean is...

775
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,478
Maybe you're not ready yet.

776
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:09,847
To be a hero.

777
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:11,516
No?

778
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:14,352
Well, maybe
I can be the villain.

779
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:16,687
He seems to have
all the good scenes.

780
00:54:16,721 --> 00:54:18,389
With you anyway.

781

"You'll hurt your hand."

782
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:23,894
(SCOFFS) What a line.

783
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,333
I don't need you.

784
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:29,700
I don't need any of this.

785
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:31,736
I'm gonna go out
into the big world

786
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:34,939
And make a pile of money
and surround myself
with beautiful women

787
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,707
Who appreciate me.

788
00:54:37,908 --> 00:54:39,510
See if I care.

All the visions I can see

810
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:19,036
* May be waiting
just for me to say

811
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:20,505
* I can see it!

812
00:57:20,538 --> 00:57:21,739
* Say

813
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,908
* Shining somewhere!
* Say!

814
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,511
* Take me there and
make me a part of it!

815
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:27,945
* Make

816
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:31,782
* Make me see
those shining
sights inside of me!

817
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:34,519
* Make him feel it!

818
00:57:34,552 --> 00:57:37,187
* Make me feel
those lights inside

819
00:57:37,221 --> 00:57:42,727
* I know it's so
I know that it really may be!

820
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,995
* Just what
I always waited for!

821
00:57:45,029 --> 00:57:47,732
* This is what
my life's created for!

822
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:53,971
* Let me learn!

823
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,081
Hello, big boy.

824
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:07,484
Welcome to the Casbah.

825
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:17,595
Getting kinda dizzy.
That perfume!

826
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:19,564
It's Alexia de L'Amour.

827
00:58:20,264 --> 00:58:21,866
Drink that.

828
00:58:37,281 --> 00:58:38,716
What is it?

829
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:40,685
A little something
from the Caliph.

830
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:44,889
Two parts rhino horn,
one part mandrake,
one part ginseng.

831
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:48,258
Absinthe and a little
sprinkling of cojonas.

832
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:50,227
What's that?

833
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,261
Don't ask.

834
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:29,900
* I'd like to swim
in a clear blue stream

835
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:34,905
* Where the water is icy cold

836
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:40,645
* Then go to town
In a golden gown

837
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:45,683
* And have my fortune told

838
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:48,953
Just once.
Just once before you're old.

839
00:59:48,986 --> 00:59:50,187
It's my bandit.

840
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,388
Your bandit, yes.

841
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,223
What are you doing
up there in that tree?

842
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:54,659
Growing ripe.

843
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:55,993
Don't grow too
ripe or you'll fall.

844
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:57,127
Very wise.

845
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:01,331
What do you see from up there?

846
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:02,667
Everything.

847
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,801
Do you see Matt?

848
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:04,869
Do you care?

849
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:06,036
No, I just wondered.

850
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:10,174
Can I climb up
there beside you?

851
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:11,709
You can if you can.

852
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,914
You know,
there's always my way.

853
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:20,317
Put a ladder in the back.

854
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:49,780
Is it fun to be a bandit?

855
01:00:49,814 --> 01:00:51,816
It has its moments, yes.

856
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:53,751
I think it must be fun.

857
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:55,753
So...

858
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:59,289
How do you do it?

859
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:01,992
Do you ride into town
pretending to be a carnival

860
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:04,261
And then steal things
when people aren't looking?

861
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:05,930
That's one way to go.

862
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:07,297
And what do you steal?

863
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:10,200
Whatever's most valuable.
Whatever's treasured most.

864
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:13,070
That's more like it.

865
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:19,744
You see this ribbon?

866
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:24,181
That's where you
gave me a bruise.

867
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:38,462
Take me with you.

868
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:44,034
Show me your world.

869
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:50,941
What is it that you want?

870
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:54,945
That's just it.

871
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:57,948
I don't know what I want.

872
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,152
I want things
I've only heard about

873
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,721
Or dreamed.

874
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:09,860
I want to see places
I've never seen before.

875
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:12,729
I want to do things
I've never ever done.

876
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:15,432
You and I.

877
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:17,835
Us. Together.

878
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,837
Yes.

879
01:02:20,938 --> 01:02:23,107
Dancing forever and forever.

880
01:02:25,009 --> 01:02:28,512
* Round and round,
'Neath a magic spell

881
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:32,249
* Velvet gown, pink lapel

882
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:35,853
* Life is a colorful carousel

883
01:02:35,886 --> 01:02:37,822
* Reckless and terribly gay!

884
01:02:37,855 --> 01:02:40,791
* I'm ready anytime

885
01:02:40,825 --> 01:02:44,862
* If you'll take me,
I'm ready to go!

886
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:47,932
* So show the way to me

887
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:50,100
* I will try to be

888
01:02:50,134 --> 01:02:51,869
* Ready to go

889
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:10,554
* I seem to see Venice
We're on a lagoon

890
01:03:10,587 --> 01:03:14,124
* A gondolier's crooning
a gondola tune

891
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:17,361
* The air makes your hair
Billow blue in the moon!

892
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:20,064
* I could swoon!

893
01:03:20,097 --> 01:03:22,132
* You're so blue
in the moon! *

894
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,136
Oh, look.
Carnival in Venice.

895
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,372
Something I've
always wanted to see.

896
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:30,941
What's this?
A mask.

897
01:03:30,975 --> 01:03:32,076
But it doesn't
have any expression.

898
01:03:32,109 --> 01:03:33,443
Exactly.

899
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:36,313
As long as you wear this mask
your feelings will
never betray you.

900
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:39,149
No matter what happens,
with the mask,
you'll be able to laugh

901
01:03:39,183 --> 01:03:41,285
And dance through it all.

902
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:42,419
That boy looks familiar.

903
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:43,420
Of course.

904
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:46,023
He's a country bumpkin,
they all look the same.

905
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:48,258
And they all wind up
the same way.

906
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:49,559
They're stealing his wallet.

907
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:52,296
Put on the mask,
then it's amusing.

908
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:55,265
Oh, yes, I see,
they're just having fun.

909
01:03:56,133 --> 01:03:57,935
Bene! Bene!

910
01:03:59,003 --> 01:04:00,270
(GRUNTS)

911
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:01,405
EL GALLO: Mustn't
cover the necklace.

912
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:03,007
Luisa.

913
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:06,310
It's much too beautiful.

914
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:11,381
* We'll just dance!

915
01:04:11,415 --> 01:04:18,388
* We'll kick up our heels
to music and dance!

916
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:21,325
* Until my head
reels with music

917
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:24,661
* Just like
a lovely real romance
Luisa!

918
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:29,099
* All we'll do is daily dance

919
01:04:29,133 --> 01:04:32,469
* All we'll do is just dance

920
01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:35,605
* All we'll do is just dance

921
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:37,908
* All we'll do is just...
Luisa!

922
01:04:37,942 --> 01:04:40,177
Really? I'm exhausted.

923
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,679
You can't be.
The evening's just started.

924
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:46,383
* I seem to see Athens,
it's terribly chic

925
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:50,087
* Atop the Acropolis,
it's terribly Greek

926
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,457
* There's Venus,
Adonis, and us
Cheek to cheek

927
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,692
* Oh, how chic!

928
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,062
* To be Greek
cheek to cheek! *

929
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:01,131
(COUGHS)

930
01:05:03,167 --> 01:05:04,434
Oh, look.

931
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:07,337
A Greek temple.

932
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:10,207
And they're having
some sort of contest.

933
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,976
Maybe it's the Olympics!

934
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,945
Yes! It's Greek wrestling.

935
01:05:14,979 --> 01:05:16,480
Yes.

936
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:19,249
That boy...
They're gonna kill him.

937
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:21,485
Now remember,
if it is unpleasant.

938
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:24,021
Yes, of course, the mask.

939
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:28,525
Oh, I see, It's a game.

940
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:31,128
I just love classic sports.

941
01:05:32,129 --> 01:05:34,731
You look lovely.

942
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:39,703
* We'll just dance!

943
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:46,510
* We'll kick up our heels
to music and dance!

944
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:49,213
* Until my head
reels with music

945
01:05:49,246 --> 01:05:52,749
* Just like
a lovely real romance
Luisa!

946
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:56,486
* All we'll do is daily dance

947
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,089
* All we'll do is just dance

948
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:00,957
Luisa.

949
01:06:00,991 --> 01:06:04,428
* All we'll do is just dance
All we'll do is just... *

950
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:05,562
Phew!

951
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:07,297
Couldn't we just
sit this one out?

952
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:10,000
Ridiculous.
When there's music
to be danced to?

953
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,236
Play, gypsies.

954
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:18,108
* We'll be in Benghazi
or maybe Bombay

955
01:06:18,142 --> 01:06:21,478
* I understand
India is terribly gay

956
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:24,648
* The natives assemble
on feast day and play

957
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:27,184
* With their snakes?

958
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:29,353
* What a racket it makes!

959
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:33,490
(HISSING)

960
01:06:33,523 --> 01:06:36,260
I think
I'm going to love India.

961
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:39,229
Such a big population,
and I adore crowds.

962
01:06:40,097 --> 01:06:42,066
Oh, look, there's a fakir.

963
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:43,367
Hi, fakir.

964
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:46,336
See, he's there
with his assistants.

965
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:49,606
They all know Yogi
and they're just
all loads of fun.

966
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:50,707
(GROANING)

967
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,676
There's a young one.

968
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:54,744
They're putting him
down on some nails.

969
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:57,614
If he fails, he'll be
cut to bits by those nails.

970
01:06:57,647 --> 01:06:59,616

I don't want to see this.

You're probably right,
it may be someone you know.

I see, he's just faking.

974
01:07:08,092 --> 01:07:09,659
He's a fake fakir.

975
01:07:11,228 --> 01:07:12,262
Fake.

980
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:28,478
* Until my head
reels with music

981
01:07:28,512 --> 01:07:30,414
* Just like
a lovely real romance

(THUNDER CRACKING)

991
01:08:15,459 --> 01:08:16,560
I'm suddenly afraid.

992
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,228
Of what?

993
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:19,629
I don't know.

994
01:08:20,464 --> 01:08:21,831
Something.

995
01:08:21,865 --> 01:08:23,267
Maybe you should go home.

996
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:28,572
All my life I've waited
for something
magical to happen.

997
01:08:30,174 --> 01:08:32,276
Now at last,
with you, it will.

998
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:34,711
Or what if it's
all just illusions?

999
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,614
Sleight of hand.

1000
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:40,317
This for example.

Smoke

And mirrors.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

1008
01:09:19,556 --> 01:09:20,857
Well, what do you think now?

1009
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,395
I think you're wonderful.

1010
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:30,767
But don't you understand
it was only a trick?

1011
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,236
And when you're
dealing with tricks,

1012
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:35,305
What you see isn't
always what you get.

1013
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:51,221
I'm warning you to be careful.

1014
01:09:53,323 --> 01:09:54,758
I know you are.

1015
01:09:56,426 --> 01:09:57,894
But I trust you.

I know that you'll
make it all right.

Oh, very well then.

1018
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:10,474
You better go pack
some things so that
we can run away together.

1019
01:10:10,507 --> 01:10:13,410
After all, you can't
run away and stay at home
at the same time.

1020
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:16,413
Well, who cares
if we never see this
one goat town again.

1021
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:17,814
We can drop by
in five or six years

1022
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:19,316
To see if your father
is still alive.

01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,468
Never mind.

All right, go.

Get ready.

1030
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:47,877
See if you can borrow
a little money
while you're about it.

1031
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,452
Kiss me first.

1032
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:23,747
No matter what happens,
I'll never,
ever forget that kiss.

1033
01:11:26,049 --> 01:11:28,084
A unique sensation
of an unworldly nature

1034
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,387
Running from the base of
the spine to the knees.

Wait.

1037
01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:48,405
Give me a trinket
to pledge that
you'll come back.

1038
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:50,607
That necklace.

1039
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:52,842
It was my mother's.

1040
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:55,412
Good. It will
service your pledge.

1041
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:08,658
I will leave you
my mother's necklace

01:12:08,692 --> 01:12:10,494
Because it is
my favorite thing.

Guard it.

1044

And I'll go pack.

1045

I won't be long.

You're really
taking me with you?

1047

Would I lie?

1048
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,861
I won't be long.

1049
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:53,737
You will be here?

01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,139
I promise.

1051

Allow me to say,
you look much wiser
but less well groomed.

Leave me alone.

Fine, I'm in a bit of
a rush, anyway.

Oh, this?

It's Luisa's.

You stole it.

1062
01:14:17,554 --> 01:14:19,055
Please, she gave it to me.

1063
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:20,790
Not that it's any
business of yours.

EL GALLO:
There is a curious paradox
that no one can explain.

1073
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:28,758
Who understands the secret
of the reaping of the grain.

1074
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:33,196
Who understands
why spring is born
out of winter's laboring pain.

1075
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:36,633
Or why we all must die a bit
before we grow again.

01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:43,106
Matt.

1077

What happened?

1078
01:15:49,913 --> 01:15:51,915
You look awful.

1079
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:54,784
It isn't worth tears,
Luisa, please.

1080
01:15:58,855 --> 01:16:01,925
Did you find the money
and the beautiful women.

1081
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:04,761
I can't remember, I...

1082
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:07,664
I was drugged
or hypnotized
or something.

1083

There was this
funny light and mirrors.

And there was this music.

Wearing masks.

But no one came
to help you.

No, I...

It's all right.

1094
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:44,067
I deserved it.

1095
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,835
I've been foolish.

1096
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:48,237
I have, too.

1134
01:19:54,991 --> 01:19:56,359
Take my coat.

1135
01:19:57,426 --> 01:19:59,395
Both.

1136
01:19:59,428 --> 01:20:01,564
There's room there
for both.

1137
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:15,144
* Love! You are love!

1138
01:20:15,178 --> 01:20:16,880
* You are love!

1139
01:20:16,913 --> 01:20:23,252
* Better far than a metaphor
can ever, ever be

1140
01:20:24,387 --> 01:20:26,990
* Love!
* You are love!

1141
01:20:27,023 --> 01:20:28,457
* You are love!

1142
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:31,060
* You are love!

1143
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,964
* My mystery

1144
01:20:34,998 --> 01:20:38,167
* My mystery

1145
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:42,939
* Of Love!

1146
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:44,373
BELLOMY:
Look, they've come back.

1147
01:20:44,407 --> 01:20:46,042
HUCKLEBEE:
It's a miracle.

1148
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:47,476
They're home.

1149
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:50,346
Matt!

1150
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:53,883
Luisa.

1151
01:20:55,919 --> 01:21:02,091
EL GALLO:
* Try to remember
the kind of September

1152
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:08,597
* When life was slow
and oh, so mellow

1153
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:15,071
* Try to remember
the kind of September

1154
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:21,610
* When grass was green
and grain was yellow

1155
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:27,984
* Try to remember
the kind of September

1156
01:21:28,017 --> 01:21:34,623
* When you were
a tender and callow fellow

1157
01:21:34,657 --> 01:21:40,663
* Try to remember,
and if you remember

1158
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:42,298
* Then follow

1159
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:53,409
* Deep in December,
it's nice to remember

1160
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:59,648
* Although you know
the snow will follow

1161
01:21:59,682 --> 01:22:05,388
* Deep in December,
it's nice to remember

1162
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:11,594
* Without a hurt
the heart is hollow

1163
01:22:11,627 --> 01:22:17,466
* Deep in December,
it's nice to remember

1164
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:23,039
* The fire of September
that made us mellow

1165
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:31,514
* Deep in December,
our hearts should remember

1166
01:22:33,382 --> 01:22:35,318
* And follow
