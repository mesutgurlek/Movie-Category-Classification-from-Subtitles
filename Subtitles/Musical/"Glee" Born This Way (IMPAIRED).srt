1
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:02,622
<i>So here's what you missed
on Glee:</i>

2
00:00:02,706 --> 00:00:04,207
<i>The glee club's
getting ready for Nationals,</i>

3
00:00:04,258 --> 00:00:05,792
<i>and Quinn's getting ready
to be prom queen.</i>

4
00:00:05,876 --> 00:00:07,627
We need to get elected
for prom king and queen.

5
00:00:07,695 --> 00:00:08,594
It's the ultimate
status symbol.

6
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:09,912
<i>Kurt had to leave McKinley</i>

7
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:10,963
<i>because Karofsky
threatened him...</i>

8
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:12,081
I can't expel a kid
for shoving.

9
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:13,099
He'll just say, "I didn't mean

10
00:00:13,183 --> 00:00:14,500
to shove that kid.
I tripped."

11
00:00:14,568 --> 00:00:16,052
Excuse works like a charm.
I use it all the time.

12
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:17,520
<i>But at least he's got
Blaine and the Warblers,</i>

13
00:00:17,587 --> 00:00:19,588
<i>who just lost at Regionals
to the New Directions!</i>

14
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,107
We got each other
out of all this.

15
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:23,192
That beats a lousy trophy,
don't you think?

16
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,760
<i>Santana's got it bad
for Brittany...</i>

17
00:00:24,812 --> 00:00:26,062
This relationship
is really confusing for me.

18
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:27,697
Breakfast is confusing for you.

19
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:30,066
Well, sometimes it's sweet
and sometimes it's salty.

20
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:32,735
Like, what if I have eggs
for dinner, then what is it?

21
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:34,237
<i>Will's sort of always
had it bad for Emma,</i>

22
00:00:34,288 --> 00:00:35,538
<i>but lately she's gotten
super crazy</i>

23
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:36,739
<i>with the cleaning fruit
and stuff.</i>

24
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,458
<i>I'm not following.
Like, seriously crazy.</i>

25
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:41,828
One day, you're going to find
a way to beat this thing.

26
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:44,030
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

27
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:46,799
All right, guys.

28
00:00:46,884 --> 00:00:48,468
Nationals are just
a few weeks away,

29
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:50,136
and it's time to bear down.

30
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,055
Now, your singing at Regionals
was amazing, but your dancing...

31
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:56,342
It's booty camp time.

32
00:00:56,427 --> 00:00:57,510
Booty!
So let's get it going.

33
00:00:57,594 --> 00:00:59,011
Five, six, seven, eight.

34
00:00:59,096 --> 00:01:00,730
(piano plays "Loser Like Me")

35
00:01:00,797 --> 00:01:02,231
Push yourselves, guys.

36
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:03,466
Vocal Adrenaline
takes no prisoners.

37
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:06,635
Oh! I'm so sorry.

38
00:01:06,687 --> 00:01:07,937
Are you okay?

39
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:09,071
I'm bleeding.

40
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:10,773
Let's get you to a doctor.

41
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:14,694
My dad's will be here
in 15 minutes.

42
00:01:14,778 --> 00:01:16,162
You don't have to stay, Finn.

43
00:01:16,246 --> 00:01:18,814
No, I want to wait
and hear what the doctor says.

44
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:20,366
I feel terrible.

45
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:23,419
Won't Quinn be mad at you
sitting vigil at my bedside?

46
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:24,837
Well, I'm standing,

47
00:01:24,922 --> 00:01:27,707
and-and she'd understand
how awful I feel

48
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:29,008
even if it's not broken.

49
00:01:29,092 --> 00:01:30,009
It's broken.

50
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:33,596
Well, I knew
I was a bad dancer,

51
00:01:33,663 --> 00:01:35,264
but I never thought
my dancing was dangerous.

52
00:01:35,332 --> 00:01:37,666
It's a clean break, so
I-I won't have to set it.

53
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:39,835
Considering your
deviated septum,

54
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:42,004
I'd consider this a
terrific opportunity

55
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:43,656
for a little vanity adjustment.

56
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:45,892
Are you suggesting
that I get a nose job?

57
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:47,193
You're 16, right?

58
00:01:47,277 --> 00:01:49,178
That's when I gave
my daughters theirs.

59
00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:50,980
It's like a right of
passage for Jewish girls.

60
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:54,150
First of all, I like how I look.

61
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,352
She your girlfriend?

62
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,686
No.

63
00:01:57,738 --> 00:01:59,522
What does your
girlfriend look like?

64
00:01:59,573 --> 00:02:02,375
Okay, and second of all,
I don't want to do anything

65
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,759
that's going to affect my voice.

66
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:04,961
My Broadway career
depends on it.

67
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:06,546
Yeah, we got a big show choir

68
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,630
competition coming up,
and Rachel's

69
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:08,697
kind of our best singer.

70
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:09,749
Doesn't impact the voice.

71
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,917
That's just a myth.

72
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,835
The fact is, opening
up that septum

73
00:02:12,886 --> 00:02:15,538
might allow you to take
in more air per breath,

74
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:17,423
which means bigger
belts on you high notes.

75
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:19,708
But Barbra...

76
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,728
Is great.
She's also one in a million.

77
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:27,383
The fact is, if you really
want to be an actress,

78
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:29,218
you might want to consider
looking and sounding

79
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:30,736
the best that you can.

80
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:33,272
I got an appointment
open next week.

81
00:02:33,357 --> 00:02:35,525
Can I sign you up?

82
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:39,144
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

83
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:41,747
Oh my God,
you're getting a nose job.

84
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:44,283
I'm considering having
a minor procedure

85
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:45,501
to repair my deviated septum.

86
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:47,219
So, a nose job.

87
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:50,172
Look, I'm... I'm happy
with the way that I look, okay?

88
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,790
And I've embraced my nose.

89
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:55,911
But let's say I wanted to have
a slightly more demure nose.

90
00:02:55,962 --> 00:02:58,097
Like Quinn's, for example.

91
00:02:58,181 --> 00:03:01,100
I-I would never change
my appearance for vanity,

92
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:03,302
but, I mean, the doctor said

93
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:05,320
that it could possibly
improve my talent,

94
00:03:05,388 --> 00:03:07,689
which would help us
all for Nationals.

95
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:10,258
Possibly?
What about the risks?

96
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,194
Your voice is amazing
as is, Rachel.

97
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:13,445
Hold up.

98
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,280
Could we all just
get real here for a second?

99
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:17,766
I hear that Rachel's got
a bit of a schnoz.

100
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:19,985
I mean, I wouldn't know
because, like Medusa, I try

101
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,353
to avoid eye contact with her.

102
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:22,771
But can we all just stop

103
00:03:22,822 --> 00:03:24,490
lying about how
there aren't things

104
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:25,958
that we wouldn't change
about ourselves?

105
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:29,128
I mean, I'm sure that Sam's been
at the doctor's office

106
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:31,080
and rifled through pamphlets
on mouth reduction.

107
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:32,798
I'll bet Artie's thought
about getting his legs removed

108
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:34,083
since he's not really
using them anyways.

109
00:03:34,134 --> 00:03:36,418
And I'm definitely sure
that Tina's looked

110
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:37,786
into getting an eye de-slanting.

111
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:38,804
That's extraordinarily racist.

112
00:03:38,888 --> 00:03:40,122
I'm keepin' it real.

113
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:41,974
TINA: Sorry, Santana.
I'm a beautiful person.

114
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:44,626
I'm in love with myself, and I
would never change a thing.

115
00:03:44,677 --> 00:03:47,179
Is that why you're wearing
blue contacts today, Tina?

116
00:03:47,263 --> 00:03:49,565
Self-hating Asian.

117
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,799
Not many Asian sex symbols,
Mike.

118
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,434
I'm just trying to be in fashion

119
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:54,269
and mirror what I see
in the magazines.

120
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,988
FINN: My dancing
kind of bothers me.

121
00:03:56,072 --> 00:04:00,025
Uh, it almost killed Rachel,
but I like the way I look.

122
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,443
Oh, please.

123
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:03,662
You have weird, puffy
pyramid nipples.

124
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:05,247
They look like they're
filled with custard,

125
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:06,698
or you could dust them

126
00:04:06,783 --> 00:04:08,200
with powdered sugar
and they could pass

127
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:10,702
for some sort of dessert.

128
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:13,705
Look, maybe Rachel's fine
with having an enormous beak.

129
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,208
Maybe she needs it to crack
hard seeds. All I'm saying

130
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:17,793
is that if you look
in the mirror

131
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:19,928
and you don't like what you see,
you should change it.

132
00:04:19,996 --> 00:04:21,430
Whoa, guys.

133
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:23,265
I'm really shocked
at what I'm hearing here.

134
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:25,317
It goes against everything
the glee club stands for.

135
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:28,437
I'm telling you, the thing
you would most like to change

136
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:31,023
about yourself is the most
interesting part of you.

137
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:32,975
Well, maybe,
but at this school,

138
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:34,726
the thing
that makes you different

139
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:36,512
is the thing people use
to crush your spirit.

140
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:43,986
(school bell ringing)

141
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:45,821
<i>WILL:
Rachel's a beautiful girl.</i>

142
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:47,522
She doesn't need a nose job.

143
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:50,358
Saying that she's doing it
to enrich her talent is just

144
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,161
a convenient excuse
to deal with the fact

145
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:53,862
that she's insecure
about how she looks.

146
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:56,198
Most of the adults we know
have trouble embracing

147
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:58,133
their eccentricities, so
how can we expect kids to?

148
00:04:58,201 --> 00:05:00,385
Well, then, it should be
our job to help them.

149
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,703
I don't want my legacy
as a teacher

150
00:05:01,754 --> 00:05:05,057
to be conjugated verbs
and Glee Club trophies.

151
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:06,875
I want to help them
love themselves

152
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:09,311
for who they are,
warts and all--

153
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:11,013
Especially warts.

154
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:12,681
How long do we have
to do this for?

155
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:14,149
Until they're all clean.

156
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:16,885
I mean, I'm really enjoying
helping you with your OCD.

157
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:19,188
Do you know what? I really
don't like that term, really.

158
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,939
It sounds way too
scientific and serious.

159
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:23,225
I really prefer "neat
freak" or "cleanybug."

160
00:05:23,276 --> 00:05:25,110
But, Will, I really
have to tell you,

161
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:28,247
I'm so appreciative
of all your help.

162
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:29,915
Really, I have so
much more free time

163
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:32,084
now that there are four hands
polishing all of my fruit.

164
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:34,119
I'm really glad...

165
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:35,370
but shouldn't we
be figuring out

166
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:36,505
some techniques you can use

167
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:38,406
to eat your food
without scrubbing it?

168
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,575
You mean with germs and
pesticides all over it?

169
00:05:40,627 --> 00:05:44,463
No, I mean, really deal
with your issues on this stuff.

170
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:47,182
Will, I've tried, you know,

171
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,417
and I... I may not have
been born this way,

172
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:51,586
but this is my lot in life.

173
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:54,189
There's nothing I
can do about it.

174
00:05:54,257 --> 00:05:56,642
Thank you.

175
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:58,560
What for?

176
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:00,696
I know how I'm going
to get the kids

177
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:02,731
to accept what
their differences are--

178
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:04,983
By using their two
favorite teachers:

179
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:08,237
Me and Gaga...

180
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:10,205
but I'm going
to need your help.

181
00:06:10,273 --> 00:06:11,456
(school bell ringing)

182
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,994
<i>SANTANA: I should be prom queen
at this school.</i>

183
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,579
<i>If I were prom queen,</i>

184
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,381
<i>I could get Brittany to drop
the four-eyed loser</i>

185
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:21,550
<i>and go for the real queen.</i>

186
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:23,001
<i>She's so gullible,
I could convince her</i>

187
00:06:23,086 --> 00:06:25,337
<i>that by royal decree,
I'd made her being with me</i>

188
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:27,806
<i>the law of the land.</i>

189
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,124
<i>That's never going to happen.</i>

190
00:06:29,175 --> 00:06:30,642
<i>I don't have the votes.</i>

191
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:32,261
<i>Unless I could get
the jock block.</i>

192
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:34,229
(á la Sean Connery):
Jack Ryan, you've just boarded

193
00:06:34,297 --> 00:06:35,297
<i>the Red October.</i>

194
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:37,316
Sean Connery.

195
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:40,569
<i>And God knows Sam doesn't have</i>

196
00:06:40,636 --> 00:06:42,187
<i>the heat at this school yet.</i>

197
00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:44,139
<i>Hold on, there's someone
at this school</i>

198
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,474
<i>who just might have
the juice...</i>

199
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:47,576
<i>Dave Karofsky.</i>

200
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,813
<i>Holy crap.</i>

201
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:56,335
<i>I'm a closet lesbian
and a judgmental bitch,</i>

202
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:59,288
<i>which means one thing:
I have awesome gaydar.</i>

203
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:01,006
(school bell ringing)

204
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,658
You haven't asked us anything
about our New York trip.

205
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,427
TINA: Is it because
it's too painful?

206
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:06,828
Yes, as a matter of fact,

207
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,929
but while the New Directions!

208
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:09,831
Are preparing
to perform at Nationals,

209
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:12,334
the Warblers are preparing
to perform at a nursing home

210
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:14,186
in a strip mall
next to a National Bank.

211
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:16,938
But I'm so proud of you guys.

212
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:18,506
We miss you so much.

213
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:20,859
Isn't there any way you
could come back to McKinley?

214
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:23,779
I told him, I would be all for
it if it wasn't for Karofsky.

215
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:26,481
Wait, what did you just say?

216
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:27,899
Kurt needs to be safe.

217
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,684
Okay, can we please
change subject?

218
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:31,320
<i>BLAINE: I'm just saying...
SANTANA: That's it.</i>

219
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:34,456
<i>Kurt's the trick to winning
prom queen and getting Britt,</i>

220
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:37,209
<i>not to mention totally boosting
our chances at Nationals.</i>

221
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:40,295
<i>If I could get Kurt back,
I'd be a hero.</i>

222
00:07:40,363 --> 00:07:41,830
<i>Even Quinn and Finn
would vote for me.</i>

223
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:43,332
<i>And the key?</i>

224
00:07:43,383 --> 00:07:44,249
<i>Karofsky.</i>

225
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:45,717
(sighs)

226
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:47,102
I've got to gay-- Go.

227
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,203
Go-- I've got to go.

228
00:07:49,722 --> 00:07:52,224
(school bell ringing)

229
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:55,377
Um, why is Ms. Pillsbury here?

230
00:07:55,428 --> 00:07:57,062
She's helping us out
with this week's assignment.

231
00:07:57,146 --> 00:07:58,397
Now, this is the only club

232
00:07:58,464 --> 00:07:59,598
at school that is represented

233
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:02,217
by just about every race,
religion,

234
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:04,386
sexual orientation and clique,

235
00:08:04,437 --> 00:08:06,855
but many of you are still having
a hard time with acceptance.

236
00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:08,874
That's crazy, Mr. Shue.
We love each other.

237
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:10,659
No, I won't deny that
you accept each other,

238
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:12,911
but you don't
accept yourselves.

239
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:14,663
This week's assignment
has two parts.

240
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,449
I want all of you to sing
songs about accepting yourself

241
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:21,286
for who you are-- The
best and the worst parts.

242
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:23,255
What's the second part?
Well,

243
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,790
we're going to do
a group number

244
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:26,842
by the queen
of self-love--

245
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:28,243
Gaga.

246
00:08:28,294 --> 00:08:30,128
(cheering and applause)
We're going to perform

247
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:32,631
her anthem to acceptance--
"Born This Way."

248
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:35,016
Yes!

249
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:38,720
Wait, wait, I still don't know
why Ms. Pillsbury is here.

250
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:41,073
I'm here to help you with your
costumes for the big number.

251
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,891
Each of you will be issued
a beautifully fitted

252
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:44,592
white T-shirt.

253
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:47,762
We will then use
this letter press...

254
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:49,264
to write a word or a phrase

255
00:08:49,332 --> 00:08:50,899
that best describes
the thing about you

256
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,150
that you're the most ashamed of

257
00:08:52,235 --> 00:08:54,069
or you'd like to
change but you can't

258
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,604
because you were born that way,
which is super terrific. I want you

259
00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:58,606
to love those parts of you,
you know, embrace them,

260
00:08:58,658 --> 00:08:59,908
wear them on your
chest with pride.

261
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,993
Can you give an example?

262
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:03,578
Yeah.

263
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:04,996
It's the big moment.

264
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:05,997
(chuckles)

265
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:06,932
(clears throat)

266
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:12,104
Wow, Emma, I thought
the whole purpose

267
00:09:12,171 --> 00:09:13,422
of you doing this
was to write...

268
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:16,892
Being a ginger has plagued me
my entire life.

269
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,593
People say
that I smell like copper,

270
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:20,762
I can get a sunburn
indoors at night,

271
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:23,131
and according to recent legend,
I have no soul,

272
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,266
but I'm here to say
that this very curse

273
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:26,268
is what makes me unique.

274
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:28,186
Children,

275
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:30,739
I claim my gingerhood
before you today.

276
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:34,659
I was born this way.

277
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:35,977
Hooray.

278
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:37,279
Hooray!
(school bell ringing)

279
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,530
Hooray!

280
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,708
(school bell ringing)

281
00:09:54,152 --> 00:09:56,069
Those crowns are a crock.

282
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:57,321
You know what I found out?

283
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,322
Not real jewels.

284
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,990
A crown hasn't rested on my head

285
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,811
since I won
Miss Tiara Toddler Allen County.

286
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:05,028
Are you serious?

287
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:07,397
Yeah, three years in a row.

288
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:09,199
I dominated
in Western Wear and Runway,

289
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,919
but my real talent
was baby pull-ups.

290
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:14,588
AUDIENCE:
31!

291
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:17,207
32! 33!

292
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:24,014
I was on my way
to becoming Miss Ohio.

293
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,432
That is, until the shoddy
Zizes thyroid kicked in

294
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:26,884
as well as a love of chips,

295
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:28,018
and suddenly I was denied entry

296
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,636
into the pageant circuit.

297
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:31,889
They said I no longer
looked the part.

298
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,856
My dreams were dashed.

299
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,362
There's our future queen...

300
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,764
a size-two
teenage dream.

301
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:42,533
You know what?

302
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,151
We're going to change that.

303
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:45,986
LAUREN:
How?

304
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,454
PUCK:
Baby,

305
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:50,290
you're going to get that crown,
and I'm gonna be your king.

306
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,209
(school bell ringing)

307
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,915
Thanks for doing this.

308
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:59,449
I'm surprised
more girls haven't asked me.

309
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:00,801
My nose is awesome.

310
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:03,119
I can totally count
on your vote,

311
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:05,873
right?
Yeah. To... totally.

312
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,299
So, what's it like?

313
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,268
Looking like you look?

314
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:20,204
I pretty much have
a warped sense of the world.

315
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:22,656
Being a hot 17-year-old,

316
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,275
you can get away with
or do anything you want,

317
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:26,977
so I kind of always assume

318
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:29,246
that people are always nice
and accommodating.

319
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,280
(knocking)

320
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:32,332
Okay. So,

321
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:34,418
we, uh,
ready to pull the trigger?

322
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,820
No, not... not quite yet.
Um, I was kind of hoping

323
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:39,289
that I could get an idea
of what I might look like

324
00:11:39,357 --> 00:11:40,424
after the procedure.

325
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,544
Um, this is my friend Quinn.

326
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:45,161
Nice nose.

327
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:47,047
Thank you.
Very nice.

328
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:49,266
Yeah, well, Rachel wants it.

329
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,717
No problem.

330
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:52,886
So I'll click some pics,
make up some photo composites.

331
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:54,170
We'll be ready
to rock and roll.

332
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,675
(exhales)

333

(cheers and applause)

381
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,867
WILL:
Beautiful job, ladies.

382
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,921
(school bell ringing)

383
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,173
She's got my vote.

384
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:27,674
She's such an inspiration.

385
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,427
It's nice to see someone like me
on a poster for a change.

386
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,167
What are you doing?

387
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:38,635
Oh, hey.
I'm running for prom queen.

388
00:14:38,686 --> 00:14:40,003
As a joke, right?

389
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:41,805
Does it look like I'm joking?

390
00:14:41,856 --> 00:14:43,273
Well, when your name appears
on that ballot,

391
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,858
the whole school's going
to think it's a laugh riot,

392
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:46,276
and you may just
get enough votes to win.

393
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,311
That's sort of the idea.

394
00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:49,780
And as everybody snickers
as they try

395
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,281
to squeeze that tiara
onto your head,

396
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,866
somebody's going
to spill pig's blood on you,

397
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,350
or something like that,
and you'll become

398
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:55,986
more of an outcast
than you already are.

399
00:14:56,037 --> 00:14:59,573
Okay. I don't know exactly
what your problem is,

400
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:00,791
but you best bring it, Fabray.

401
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,459
Because I'm hot as hell,

402
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,494
I keep it real, and the
people at this school

403
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:05,746
want a prom queen
who's like them.

404
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,997
No, they want a prom queen

405
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:08,298
who's somebody
they'd like to be.

406
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,666
Look.

407
00:15:09,717 --> 00:15:11,468
Not everybody can be
born pretty like you.

408
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,503
But just so you know,
who you are inside

409
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:15,338
and who you pretend to be
to the rest of the world--

410
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:16,539
They're two different people.

411
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:17,974
You don't know anything
about me, Lauren.

412
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,393
Anything.
But you know what?

413
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:22,429
You're about to.

414
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:23,663
Because it just got personal.

415
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:27,617
(school bell ringing)

416
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,671
I knew you'd
ask me out eventually.

417
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,340
I'm kind of Duke Stud
at McKinley.

418
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:35,242
Give it up. I know.

419
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,426
Know what?

420
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:37,511
That you're gay.

421
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:39,679
What? Who told you that?

422
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:41,214
No one had to tell me.

423
00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:43,350
First of all, I saw you checking
out Sam's ass the other day.

424
00:15:43,434 --> 00:15:45,135
You know, you really need

425
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:46,920
to be more careful
with your leering.

426
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,189
I didn't. I was just seeing
what jeans he was wearing.

427
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:50,507
Like that's any less gay.

428
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,642
Second of all, I know
about you and Kurt.

429
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:54,861
Remember last week
before the benefit?

430
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:58,281
About you being worried about
"the truth" getting out.

431
00:15:58,349 --> 00:15:59,783
Guess what. It's out.

432
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,235
Whatever they told you
is a lie to mess with me.

433
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,237
I'm going to kick their asses.

434
00:16:04,322 --> 00:16:06,206
Okay, you know what? Why
don't you just settle down

435
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,025
and let Auntie Tana here
tell you a little story.

436
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:10,693
It's about you.

437
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:12,579
You're what we call
a "late in life gay."

438
00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:14,581
You're going to
stay in the closet,

439
00:16:14,665 --> 00:16:17,000
get married, get drunk to have
relations with your wife,

440
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:18,869
have a couple kids,
maybe become

441
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,471
a state senator or a deacon,

442
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:23,390
and then get caught in the
men's room tapping your foot

443
00:16:23,474 --> 00:16:25,308
with some page,
and you know what?

444
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:27,093
I accept that about you.

445
00:16:27,178 --> 00:16:29,346
Why are you doing this?

446
00:16:29,397 --> 00:16:31,431
Because I need you,

447
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:34,401
and you need me.

448
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:36,586
We play on the same team.

449
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:39,656
You're...

450
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:40,890
Look, I'm not ready

451
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:42,359
to start eating jicama

452
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,693
or get a flat top yet, either.

453
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:45,028
Maybe in junior college.

454
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:46,079
This is garbage.

455
00:16:46,163 --> 00:16:47,330
I'm not gay.

456
00:16:47,398 --> 00:16:49,416
I'm trying to
help you out here.

457
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,068
Have you ever heard
of the term "beards?"

458
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,587
It's when a gay man and woman

459
00:16:53,671 --> 00:16:55,705
date each other to hide
the fact that they're gay.

460
00:16:55,756 --> 00:16:57,290
Like the Roosevelts.

461
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,409
So you and I are going to
be each other's beards,

462
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,794
and then we're going to win

463
00:17:00,878 --> 00:17:02,579
prom king and queen
and rule the school.

464
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,847
And what if I say no?

465
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:05,282
Then I'm going to tell
everyone about you,

466
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,517
and your life will be over.

467
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:09,519
The only straight I am
is straight-up bitch.

468
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:11,221
You in or not?

469
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:17,908
(school bell ringing) What
you're doing is terrible.

470
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,243
I have a nice nose.

471
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:21,212
Rachel asked me for help,
and I'm giving it to her.

472
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:22,547
And once again, we are
fighting about Rachel.

473
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:23,931
I'm your girlfriend.

474
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:26,167
Look, this isn't about
who's my girlfriend.

475
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:27,418
Mr. Shue is
trying to get us

476
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:28,803
to accept ourselves
for who we are,

477
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:30,254
and you're helping Rachel
do the exact opposite.

478
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:31,723
That's not cool.
Yeah, well, maybe

479
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:33,591
I'm not down
with this week's lesson.

480
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:40,281
I love this lesson.

(cheers and applause)

517
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:55,533
All right, Finn!

518
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:56,918
Perfect! See, guys,
someone who's not afraid

519
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:58,619
to point out something
they're really bad at.

520
00:19:58,704 --> 00:20:01,389
But I'm getting better, right?

521
00:20:02,624 --> 00:20:04,742
RACHEL:
Mr. Schuester?

522
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:05,960
May I have the floor, please?

523
00:20:06,044 --> 00:20:08,296
It's yours.

524
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,215
So, as all of you know,
I've had a few consultations

525
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:13,083
with a doctor who specializes
in rhinoplasty.

526
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:14,685
TINA:
Yes, we know.

527
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:17,021
That's all any of us
have been talking about.

528
00:20:17,088 --> 00:20:19,307
And we think it's
a terrible idea.

529
00:20:19,374 --> 00:20:21,609
Okay. Blue eyes,
you're such a hypocrite.

530
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:23,928
I admit, yes, I don't like
my eyes sometimes--

531
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:25,413
The shape, the color--

532
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,032
But your self-hatred, Rachel,
has helped me see the light.

533
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:29,867
I love myself.

534
00:20:29,935 --> 00:20:31,285
Not enough, clearly.

535
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,237
When you get a nose job,
when you change your eyes,

536
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:34,789
when you bleach your freckles,

537
00:20:34,873 --> 00:20:36,073
you're just announcing
to the world,

538
00:20:36,124 --> 00:20:37,775
"I don't like myself very much."

539
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:39,560
The drams of this week

540
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:41,111
have made me realize,

541
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:43,831
if I don't have many Asian
sex symbols to look up to,

542
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,133
I have an obligation
to maybe become one myself.

543
00:20:46,218 --> 00:20:47,602
My new mantra is

544
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:50,287
"Be the change you want
to see in the world."

545
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:52,173
I love you so much right now.

546
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:58,729
RACHEL: Uh... okay, uh...
Okay, okay, okay.

547
00:20:58,797 --> 00:21:01,732
Besides Tina's abrupt
personal transformation,

548
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,601
the compositions came back
from the doctor,

549
00:21:03,652 --> 00:21:06,020
showing what my nose would
look like slightly altered,

550
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:08,823
and I have to say, I'm really
happy with the results.

551
00:21:08,907 --> 00:21:12,410
They're less Hebraic,
and more Fabrayic.

552
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:20,484
That doesn't really
look like you.

553
00:21:20,535 --> 00:21:22,253
PUCK: Every year, girls
show up to my temple

554
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,487
after their 16th birthday,

555
00:21:23,538 --> 00:21:25,790
looking suddenly
slightly different.

556
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:27,157
And you know what?

557
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:28,926
Even though it's easier
to make out with them

558
00:21:28,994 --> 00:21:30,628
without getting constantly
stabbed in the eye,

559
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:32,046
they're not as hot.

560
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,998
Well, this isn't
about being hot.

561
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:35,833
It's about conquering
your destiny,

562
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:38,519
and finding something in
yourself that you want to change

563
00:21:38,587 --> 00:21:40,104
and change it.

564
00:21:40,171 --> 00:21:44,008
Plus, they said that it
could improve my voice, so...

565
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:46,527
Look, if you guys aren't willing
to support my decision,

566
00:21:46,612 --> 00:21:49,614
then I'm pretty accustomed
to making it on my own.

567
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:50,815
Rachel, please don't do this.

568
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:54,318
You're beautiful.

569
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,661
This isn't a discussion.

570
00:22:03,712 --> 00:22:06,297
I have made up my mind.

571
00:22:06,364 --> 00:22:08,299
Rachel Berry
is getting a nose job.

572
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:13,806
(school bell ringing)

573
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,224
Hey.
Hey.

574
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,176
How's the assignment going?

575
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,761
Well, I actually wanted
to talk to you about that.

576
00:22:18,812 --> 00:22:19,978
Oh.

577
00:22:20,063 --> 00:22:21,513
The word you put
on your T-shirt.

578
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:23,649
Ginger?

579
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:25,467
Right.

580
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:27,236
I was a little disappointed.

581
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:30,689
You and I both know
you should have put OCD on it.

582
00:22:30,774 --> 00:22:32,658
Well, I don't think
it's appropriate

583
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:35,077
to talk about
such personal things with them.

584
00:22:35,144 --> 00:22:37,196
Really, those kids
have to trust me.

585
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,197
I'm supposed to
be a role model.

586
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:40,699
And you're not being one.

587
00:22:40,784 --> 00:22:42,968
We're trying to teach these kids
to... to accept themselves,

588
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:44,420
and you refuse to.

589
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:46,588
Will, you know
I wasn't born this way.

590
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,791
It all started when I was five.

591
00:22:48,842 --> 00:22:50,259
And you never had
any anxiety before that?

592
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:52,378
I understand I was
a very colicky baby.

593
00:22:52,462 --> 00:22:54,012
I mean, I remember getting
kicked out of preschool

594
00:22:54,097 --> 00:22:56,548
because I was having
panic attacks when they made us

595
00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:57,783
use manila paper, but...

596
00:22:57,851 --> 00:22:59,835
You have a severe
anxiety disorder, Emma.

597
00:22:59,886 --> 00:23:02,388
All of us just humor it
because you function so well,

598
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:03,856
and you're so cute about it,

599
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,058
but it's really keeping you
from enjoying your life.

600
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:07,226
Okay, fine.
Do you know what?

601
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,111
If you want me to wear a shirt

602
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:10,979
that says "Batty"
or "Loon" on it, I will.

603
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:12,514
Totally fine.

604
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:14,032
So what if I like my fruit
free of contaminants?

605
00:23:14,117 --> 00:23:15,317
Isn't that healthy?

606
00:23:15,368 --> 00:23:17,703
You know what I want?

607
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:20,789
I want you
to have lunch with me.

608
00:23:22,158 --> 00:23:23,459
Is that unwashed fruit?

609
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:25,961
Yep. Here.

610
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:27,579
Have a blueberry.

611
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:28,881
Ugh!

612
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:30,499
Come on.
Uh-uh.

613
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,367
No. Stop. This isn't funny.

614
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:33,969
I'm just trying
to help you get better.

615
00:23:34,036 --> 00:23:36,388
I think accepting the fact
that you have a problem

616
00:23:36,473 --> 00:23:37,706
is the first step.

617
00:23:37,757 --> 00:23:39,141
Okay, what?
And you think torturing me

618
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,059
with unwashed fruit's
going to make me take that step?

619
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:45,547
You know what I think, Emma?

620
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:47,850
I think you are an expert
at deflection.

621
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,251
Is that a new shirt?

622
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,086
And I think you work so hard

623
00:23:51,154 --> 00:23:52,688
at helping other people--
Counseling them--

624
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:55,707
So that you can avoid doing the
hard, painful work on yourself.

625
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:04,666
(school bell ringing)

626
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,535
Okay, listen, I'm all...
That's all I'm asking for.

627
00:24:06,586 --> 00:24:08,120
Let me finish.
Excuse me.

628
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:09,788
Quiet!
No.

629
00:24:09,873 --> 00:24:11,907
Quiet, okay?
We don't care what he has to say.

630
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,676
Shh. Now, I know David has
had some issues in the past,

631
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,663
but I have great respect
for what he's doing right now,

632
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,765
and I ask you to hear him out.

633
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:20,933
Thank you.
How about we punch his face?

634
00:24:21,017 --> 00:24:22,184
Right.
Okay, that's enough, guys.

635
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:23,318
FIGGINS: Excuse me.
Everyone listen up.

636
00:24:23,386 --> 00:24:26,138
First, I just want
to say how sorry I am

637
00:24:26,222 --> 00:24:28,423
for what I did to Kurt

638
00:24:28,491 --> 00:24:31,693
and for what I've done
to a lot of you.

639
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:35,230
I think I've slushied
every one of you.

640
00:24:43,122 --> 00:24:45,290
I treated Kurt the worst,

641
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:47,960
and I'm really ashamed

642
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:49,995
of who I am

643
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:52,881
and what I did.

644
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,166
Why should we believe you?

645
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,717
You don't have to.

646
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,970
I know I'll need
to earn your trust.

647
00:24:58,054 --> 00:25:01,139
All I can say is that Santana
has really helped me

648
00:25:01,224 --> 00:25:02,925
to see the light.

649
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,811
She showed me all these stories
online about kids

650
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,680
jumping off of bridges
and hanging themselves

651
00:25:08,765 --> 00:25:11,617
because they were
being bullied so bad.

652
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:13,235
I couldn't believe

653
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:16,238
someone could make
another person feel that awful,

654
00:25:16,305 --> 00:25:18,407
but she helped me accept

655
00:25:18,474 --> 00:25:20,492
that I was one
of those bad people,

656
00:25:20,577 --> 00:25:23,946
and I don't want to be anymore.

657
00:25:23,997 --> 00:25:26,448
Wait. Santana?

658
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:30,151
This Glee Club is not complete.

659
00:25:30,203 --> 00:25:32,671
Not without Kurt.

660
00:25:32,755 --> 00:25:36,008
So I've taken it upon myself
to try to rehabilitate Dave

661
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:38,493
to see if maybe Kurt would

662
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:41,547
consider coming back
and help us win nationals.

663
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:43,682
I did this for us,

664
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:47,002
and then
something funny happened.

665
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,506
Something... called love.

666
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:53,959
TINA:
I'm going to barf.

667
00:25:54,027 --> 00:25:55,978
KAROFSKY:
I want Kurt to feel safe

668
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:58,530
to come back, which is why

669
00:25:58,615 --> 00:26:01,400
Santana and I have
started a new club--

670
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:03,184
The Bully Whips.

671
00:26:03,236 --> 00:26:05,070
The name was my idea.

672
00:26:05,154 --> 00:26:06,705
We're going to be like
guardian angels.

673
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:09,491
FIGGINS: I have deputized
David and Santana

674
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:11,994
and the rest of their club
to roam the halls,

675
00:26:12,045 --> 00:26:14,713
identifying bullying
and stopping it in its tracks.

676
00:26:14,797 --> 00:26:16,999
I'm saying
I want the pants, okay?

677
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,501
The ones you have on right now.

678
00:26:19,552 --> 00:26:21,587
Then, what will I wear
for the rest of the day?

679
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:24,172
That's a YP-- Your problem,
not an MP-- My problem.

680
00:26:24,223 --> 00:26:26,475
Hey, Z, back off.
Say what?

681
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:27,759
What is this? Berets?

682
00:26:27,844 --> 00:26:29,377
Everyone deserves a safe

683
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:31,013
school environment.
Don't pick on this kid.

684
00:26:31,064 --> 00:26:33,565
It's not cool,
and we won't allow it anymore.

685
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,934
I'm planning on reaching
out to Kurt personally,

686
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:37,385
through Principal Figgins,

687
00:26:37,437 --> 00:26:39,905
to try to make amends.

688
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:41,990
This is a chance
to really change this place.

689
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,825
I hope you can support us.

690
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,445
(school bell ringing)

691
00:26:50,021 --> 00:26:53,023
You know, you talk a great game,
but all I'm hearing is talk,

692
00:26:53,107 --> 00:26:55,008
and talk isn't going
to keep Kurt safe.

693
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:57,227
But the anti-bullying club
that David started will.

694
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:58,845
The fact is,

695
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:00,981
since the club began enforcing
the no-bullying rule,

696
00:27:01,032 --> 00:27:02,365
we haven't had one incident.

697
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,351
Yeah, and if I took
all the water out of the ocean,

698
00:27:05,403 --> 00:27:07,821
it wouldn't be wet anymore.

699
00:27:07,872 --> 00:27:12,208
The bullying stopped because
your top offender stopped.

700
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:14,160
Mr. Hummel.
Can I call you Burt?

701
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:15,128
Of course.

702
00:27:15,195 --> 00:27:16,463
You remember how understanding

703
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,531
I was about this
when it all began.

704
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:19,883
I didn't come
to David's defense.

705
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:21,351
I believed your son.

706
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,703
That's because the David
I was seeing was not

707
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:25,522
the young man I knew.

708
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:27,707
The boy I raised
was a Cub Scout.

709
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:29,509
He was kind,
he was a good citizen.

710
00:27:29,577 --> 00:27:31,210
I still don't know
what was going through

711
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:32,712
his mind when all
this bullying stared,

712
00:27:32,763 --> 00:27:35,015
but I can tell you
that the David I'm seeing now

713
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:36,716
is my son, back again.

714
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:38,768
This... this is real.

715
00:27:38,853 --> 00:27:41,321
Do you have any idea
how much stress

716
00:27:41,388 --> 00:27:43,773
this has caused my family?

717
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:46,059
My son having
to leave his friends.

718
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,861
My wife and I spending money

719
00:27:47,912 --> 00:27:50,280
we don't have on private school
'cause of your son.

720
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:53,666
Burt, were you always
so accepting of homosexuals?

721
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:55,335
We're the same age.

722
00:27:55,402 --> 00:27:56,953
I remember what we used to say

723
00:27:57,038 --> 00:27:58,371
about the gays
when we were younger.

724
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,672
Now, it's taken us

725
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,458
a long time
to figure out what's right.

726
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:03,576
Why can't you just allow David
the couple months

727
00:28:03,627 --> 00:28:05,512
that it's taken him
to figure it out?

728
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:07,797
Because he said
he's going to kill my son!

729
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:09,049
I never actually
meant that, though.

730
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,183
It's just a figure of speech.

731
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,018
How's he supposed to know what?

732
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:13,553
Your words still matter, David.

733
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:14,971
I know.

734
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:17,357
You have to believe
how awful I feel about them.

735
00:28:17,424 --> 00:28:20,060
Those ones, especially.

736
00:28:20,111 --> 00:28:21,694
That's not me.
Not anymore.

737
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,280
What do you think, Kurt?

738
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:29,152
I believe he realizes
what he did was wrong.

739
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,987
You're only saying
that because you want

740
00:28:31,072 --> 00:28:32,372
to be back in this
school so bad.

741
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:36,810
Can Dave and I speak
for a moment alone?

742
00:28:38,045 --> 00:28:40,580
You can wait
right outside in the hall.

743
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,916
Let's go.

744
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:44,834
Yeah.

745
00:28:46,804 --> 00:28:49,255
(crowd chatter)

746
00:28:50,975 --> 00:28:53,309
What's your angle here?

747
00:28:53,394 --> 00:28:55,595
I'm just trying
to make things right.

748
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:57,797
David, I know, remember?

749
00:28:57,848 --> 00:28:58,965
And I haven't told anyone.

750
00:28:59,016 --> 00:29:01,468
Why? It would have made
your life

751
00:29:01,535 --> 00:29:02,652
a lot easier.

752
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:04,687
I don't believe
in denying who you are,

753
00:29:04,772 --> 00:29:07,407
but I don't believe
in outing, either.

754
00:29:07,474 --> 00:29:08,808
But still, you owe me

755
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:10,810
the truth.

756
00:29:10,878 --> 00:29:12,695
What's going on here?

757
00:29:15,032 --> 00:29:16,583
(sighs)

758
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,701
It was Santana's idea.

759
00:29:18,786 --> 00:29:20,153
She wants to be prom queen,

760
00:29:20,204 --> 00:29:22,122
so she figures,
if we can get you back,

761
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:23,656
we'll get everyone
to vote for us.

762
00:29:23,724 --> 00:29:27,894
I'm both repulsed and impressed
by her Lady Macbethian ways.

763
00:29:27,962 --> 00:29:31,047
Hmm. A Latina Eve Harrington.

764
00:29:31,132 --> 00:29:32,265
Okay, if you're
going to be gay,

765
00:29:32,332 --> 00:29:34,050
you simply must know
who that is.

766
00:29:34,135 --> 00:29:35,935
Look, I don't know
for sure I am gay, okay?

767
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:37,821
Stop being such
a broken record.

768
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,442
Okay, I have
several options here.

769
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:45,311
I could tell everyone
the truth about you...

770
00:29:45,362 --> 00:29:47,346
Dude, I said I'm sorry.
You said you wouldn't do that!

771
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:49,149
Hold on.

772
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,685
Or I can return here
and marvel with pride

773
00:29:52,736 --> 00:29:54,154
at your new
anti-bullying movement,

774
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:56,156
which I fully believe in,

775
00:29:56,207 --> 00:29:58,291
and further demand
that you and I start a chapter

776
00:29:58,358 --> 00:30:00,660
of PFLAG here
at William McKinley.

777
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:03,213
Parents, Family and Friends
of Lesbians and Gays.

778
00:30:04,865 --> 00:30:07,700
You need to be educated, David.

779
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:11,171
You may not have to come out,
but you need to be educated.

780
00:30:11,238 --> 00:30:14,474
Oh, man, just kill me now.

781
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:17,043
Just keep an eye
on your brother.

782
00:30:17,094 --> 00:30:18,945
One step ahead of you.

783
00:30:21,565 --> 00:30:23,233
(school bell ringing)

784
00:30:34,712 --> 00:30:36,562
(toilet flushing)

785
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,734
You can't be in here, Noah.

786
00:30:41,785 --> 00:30:43,253
It's cool. I checked through
the peep hole I drilled

787
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:44,570
last year
to make sure no one was going.

788
00:30:44,622 --> 00:30:46,739
What can I help you with today?

789
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,342
I just want to talk to you,
one hot Jew to another.

790
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:50,877
Oh, God.
Look, it's my nose, okay?

791
00:30:50,928 --> 00:30:52,378
I am tired of the lectures.

792
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:54,764
Hear me out. Why are you
getting Quinn's nose?

793
00:30:54,848 --> 00:30:56,182
If you want to breathe better,

794
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,784
why don't you have him give you
Karl Malden's nose?

795
00:30:57,851 --> 00:30:59,385
Your nose has been passed down

796
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:01,137
from generation
to generation as a birthright.

797
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:03,422
It's a sign of the survival
of our people.

798
00:31:03,474 --> 00:31:05,808
This has nothing to do
with our religion.

799
00:31:05,893 --> 00:31:08,444
I need one hour of your time
tomorrow. Just one hour.

800
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:10,280
Give me that,
and I'll never bug you again.

801
00:31:12,082 --> 00:31:14,117
(school bell ringing)

802
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:15,818
What the hell is going on?

803
00:31:15,903 --> 00:31:18,871
Well, my fellow Glee Clubbers,

804
00:31:18,939 --> 00:31:22,208
it's noon, which means...
it's official.

805
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:23,276
What's official?

806
00:31:23,327 --> 00:31:24,777
My transfer!

807
00:31:24,828 --> 00:31:26,829
Kurt Hummel's back at McKinley!

808
00:31:26,914 --> 00:31:29,916
(applause and cheering)

809
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:33,002
Hi.

810
00:31:33,087 --> 00:31:35,004
Let me breathe!
Let me breathe!

811
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:36,389
Let's get ready for Nationals.

812
00:31:36,456 --> 00:31:38,091
Not yet.

813
00:31:38,142 --> 00:31:40,293
See, there's a reason
we're meeting here today.

814
00:31:40,344 --> 00:31:42,628
There's some people that wanted
to say good-bye to you, Kurt.

815
00:31:45,983 --> 00:31:47,817
Kurt,

816
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:49,602
Dalton's going to miss you.

817
00:31:49,653 --> 00:31:51,854
You were a great addition
to the Warblers,

818
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:55,275
and you made us a better team.

819
00:31:55,326 --> 00:31:56,993
I'm sad to see you
go, but we all know

820
00:31:57,077 --> 00:31:59,612
this is something
that you really want.

821
00:31:59,663 --> 00:32:02,365
And I'll still have you after
school and on the weekends,

822
00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:05,285
but these guys won't,
so they wanted to say good-bye.

823
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:06,703
And thank you, Kurt.

926

Hey, Lucy.

927
00:39:35,035 --> 00:39:37,019
What did you just call me?

928
00:39:37,071 --> 00:39:39,822
Well, that certainly got
your attention.

929
00:39:39,873 --> 00:39:42,625
Can we speak privately?

930
00:39:45,713 --> 00:39:47,547
Well, you may want
to have a seat.

931
00:39:48,749 --> 00:39:51,250
Yeah.

932
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:56,673
My dad's college roommate
was G. Gordon Liddy...

933
00:39:58,392 --> 00:40:00,059
and he taught my pop
a valuable lesson.

934
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:02,111
<i>He said the key to any campaign
is digging up dirt</i>

935
00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:04,097
on your opponent,
so I did a little digging.

936
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:09,068
PUCK: Dude, my permanent
record has three volumes.

937
00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:11,554
I don't remember
doing half this stuff.

938
00:40:13,557 --> 00:40:15,341
Jackpot.

939
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:17,443
You moved to Lima
after eighth grade, right?

940
00:40:17,528 --> 00:40:19,479
QUINN: I transferred from Fairbrook.
That's not a secret.

941
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:22,081
Well, you must have had
a pretty lousy attendance record

942
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:22,949
<i>because I called Fairbrook
Middle School</i>

943
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:23,916
and they didn't have

944
00:40:23,984 --> 00:40:26,269
a record of anyone named Fabray,

945
00:40:26,337 --> 00:40:27,370
which makes sense,

946
00:40:27,421 --> 00:40:28,588
<i>as you actually lived</i>

947
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,123
<i>in an unincorporated part</i>

948
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,458
of Fairbrook Township,
which would have meant

949
00:40:32,543 --> 00:40:34,010
<i>you would have gone
to Belleville Middle School,</i>

950
00:40:34,077 --> 00:40:35,294
not Fairbrook.

951
00:40:35,362 --> 00:40:37,113
(whispering):
So I took a little field trip.

952
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:38,781
You didn't.
I did.

953
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:40,133
And you know what?
They didn't have

954
00:40:40,217 --> 00:40:42,352
a record of anyone
named Quinn Fabray, either.

955
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:44,387
<i>They did, however, have someone
named Lucy Fabray--</i>

956
00:40:44,438 --> 00:40:46,806
Lucy Q. Fabray,

957
00:40:46,874 --> 00:40:48,391
to be exact,

958
00:40:48,442 --> 00:40:50,026
and she looked like this.

959
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:52,111
You can kind of see
the resemblance

960
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:55,314
if you look past the nose job
and subtract, eh, 70 pounds.

961
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:56,599
Stop, okay?

962
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,970
That's me.

963
00:41:02,272 --> 00:41:04,240
My middle name is Quinn.

964
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:07,943
I stopped going by Lucy because
kids made up a mean nickname.

965
00:41:09,129 --> 00:41:10,279
Juicy Lucy?

966
00:41:10,347 --> 00:41:13,082
Lucy Caboosey.

967
00:41:14,668 --> 00:41:16,502
I hated the way I looked.

968
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:21,908
I had zits. I was chubby.

969
00:41:21,975 --> 00:41:24,060
I felt terrible about myself.

970
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:27,213
I didn't have friends.

971
00:41:27,281 --> 00:41:30,032
Nobody would talk to me.

972
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,303
I was the only kid at school who
had to dissect their own frog

973
00:41:34,354 --> 00:41:35,822
because nobody would
be my lab partner.

974
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:40,460
And then I joined ballet,

975
00:41:40,527 --> 00:41:43,579
lost a little bit of weight,

976
00:41:43,647 --> 00:41:46,249
found out I was athletic,
joined gymnastics,

977
00:41:46,316 --> 00:41:48,818
then cheerleading.

978
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:50,536
Went on Proactiv for my acne.

979
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:53,005
And when my dad got transferred

980
00:41:53,073 --> 00:41:56,809
and got a raise, I asked him
if I could get a nose job.

981
00:41:56,877 --> 00:42:00,863
And he said yes.

982
00:42:00,931 --> 00:42:03,850
Then I asked them
to call me Quinn.

983
00:42:05,436 --> 00:42:06,886
So you hate yourself.

984
00:42:06,954 --> 00:42:08,554
No, I love myself.

985
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,089
And that's why I did
all those things.

986
00:42:10,157 --> 00:42:11,724
(sniffles)

987
00:42:11,792 --> 00:42:15,528
I've been that girl,
and I'm never going back.

988
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:18,397
I was a miserable little girl.

989
00:42:18,482 --> 00:42:20,700
And now I'm going
to be prom queen.

990
00:42:20,784 --> 00:42:23,936
Yeah. See, I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

991
00:42:24,004 --> 00:42:26,155
You think everyone's going
to vote for you

992
00:42:26,206 --> 00:42:28,274
because they want
to be like you.

993
00:42:28,342 --> 00:42:30,993
Well, I don't know if they're
going to want to be like you

994
00:42:31,044 --> 00:42:33,296
when they find out
that you're a complete fraud.

995
00:42:33,363 --> 00:42:35,047
What are you going to do?

996
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:37,133
If I were you,
I'd check the bulletin boards.

997
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,034
(alarms blaring)

998
00:42:55,769 --> 00:42:57,603
(gasping, sobbing)

999
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:02,241
(school bell ringing)

1000
00:43:02,326 --> 00:43:04,494
Why did you bring me here?

1001
00:43:04,561 --> 00:43:05,895
Is there a sale at Claire's?

1002
00:43:05,946 --> 00:43:08,080
I brought you here to
knock some sense into you.

1003
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:10,199
You won't listen to me,
you won't listen to Finn.

1004
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,868
But you will listen
to Barbra Streisand.

1005
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,587
Thanks, Puck. I'll
take it from here.

1006
00:43:14,671 --> 00:43:15,922
Nice effort.

1007
00:43:16,006 --> 00:43:17,373
But only I can lead
this Barbravention.

1008
00:43:17,424 --> 00:43:19,742
Is she here?
No. This is a mall in Ohio.

1009
00:43:19,793 --> 00:43:21,093
Look, Rachel, here's the deal.

1010
00:43:21,178 --> 00:43:22,411
Do you want to disappoint her?

1011
00:43:22,462 --> 00:43:24,246
Who?
Barbra.

1012
00:43:24,298 --> 00:43:26,582
Of course not, Kurt.
She's my idol. Okay, if you get

1013
00:43:26,633 --> 00:43:28,134
a nose job, then you
will be spitting

1014
00:43:28,218 --> 00:43:30,419
on her legacy.
Barbra refused

1015
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,254
to believe that beauty
could only be defined

1016
00:43:32,306 --> 00:43:34,223
by the blonde, chiseled faces
of Hitchcock's beauties,

1017
00:43:34,274 --> 00:43:36,475
so she redefined
what beauty was

1018
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,361
and became the biggest
female star in the world.

1019
00:43:38,428 --> 00:43:39,979
But what if
I can't be like her?

1020
00:43:40,063 --> 00:43:41,430
Isn't she one in a billion?

1021
00:43:41,481 --> 00:43:43,299
So are you, Rachel.

1022
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:46,068
And if you let one
misguided societal pressure

1023
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:47,453
make you change
the way you look,

1024
00:43:47,538 --> 00:43:49,155
then you won't just
be letting Barbra down,

1025
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:50,573
you'll be letting down
all the little girls

1026
00:43:50,624 --> 00:43:52,124
who are going to look at
your beautiful face one day

1027
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:53,543
and see themselves.

1028
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:56,078
You'll be taking away
their inspiration, too.

1029
00:43:56,129 --> 00:43:57,613
I thought you'd be hesitant,

1030
00:43:57,664 --> 00:43:59,332
which is why I
brought you here.

1031
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,717
Perhaps, if my words don't
inspire you, song will.

1032
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,971
Go.

1033
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,058
(Duck Soup's
"Barbra Streisand" plays)

1034
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,626
(laughing):

(song ends)
(cheering, applause)

1048
00:46:41,281 --> 00:46:42,648
(rubbing continues)

1049
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:45,318
(smacks lips) Okay.

1050
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:46,569
So...

1051
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,621
(panting):
Nice and clean.

1052
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:51,574
(clears throat softly) I'm
afraid we're out of time.

1053
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,609
What do you mean?
I just sat down.

1054
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,395
Well, the therapeutic
hour is 50 minutes,

1055
00:46:56,463 --> 00:46:59,015
and you just spent 48 of
them disinfecting the chair.

1056
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:02,668
It's clear you have a...

1057
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:06,439
a fairly severe case of
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

1058
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:08,925
Really?

1059
00:47:08,976 --> 00:47:10,843
OCD's very treatable.

1060
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:13,796
A combination of medication
and behavioral therapy

1061
00:47:13,847 --> 00:47:16,816
will give you some relief
from those feelings of...

1062
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,885
of panic that you might feel

1063
00:47:18,952 --> 00:47:21,754
if, say, you think you forgot
to unplug the curling iron or...

1064
00:47:21,822 --> 00:47:24,640
Oh, God, I think I forgot
to unplug the curling iron.

1065
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:27,827
There's a stigma in this country

1066
00:47:27,895 --> 00:47:29,612
about mental illness.

1067
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,684
I mean, depression,
anxiety, OCD, bipolar,

1068
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:37,019
they're hard to diagnose, so...

1069
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,956
people don't always appreciate
that they're serious problems,

1070
00:47:40,007 --> 00:47:41,040
but they are.

1071
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,378
Yeah, um...

1072
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:46,946
I don't know.

1073
00:47:47,014 --> 00:47:49,799
You know, I'm not sure
I want to lay on a couch

1074
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:51,934
and tell some stranger
all of my secrets.

1075
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,352
And...

1076
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:54,971
I don't want
to start popping pills

1077
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:58,007
just so I can turn into someone
that other people want me to be.

1078
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:02,011
This is how I am.

1079
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,564
This is who I'm supposed to be.

1080
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:08,434
Your illness is not
who you're supposed to be.

1081
00:48:08,502 --> 00:48:12,355
It's keeping you from who
you're supposed to be.

1082
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:17,210
Look, you're
a guidance counselor, right?

1083
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:21,614
So if a student came to you
and said they had diabetes,

1084
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:24,634
would you give them insulin

1085
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:28,588
or would you say, "Hey, that's
just who you're supposed to be."

1086
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:31,591
I... (chuckles nervously)

1087
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:35,144
I just feel, um...

1088
00:48:35,211 --> 00:48:37,346
I feel so ashamed.

1089
00:48:37,397 --> 00:48:39,232
(muffled sob)

1090
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,117
Right.

1091
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:42,852
Well, you're not alone.

1092
00:48:44,438 --> 00:48:47,607
After my daughter was born,
I had a severe case

1093
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,725
of postpartum depression.

1094
00:48:49,776 --> 00:48:52,394
I would look down

1095
00:48:52,446 --> 00:48:54,396
at this beautiful baby girl

1096
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:56,799
like she wasn't even mine.

1097
00:48:56,867 --> 00:49:00,386
Like all the color
just came out of the world.

1098
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:04,239
But you know when the moment was

1099
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:06,208
that I started to feel
just a little bit better?

1100
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:10,713
When I admitted
that I needed some help.

1101
00:49:10,764 --> 00:49:12,915
Well...

1102
00:49:12,966 --> 00:49:14,267
that's what I'm here for.

1103
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,185
Can I tell you something, Emma?

1104
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:19,171
You're going to feel better.

1105
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:22,358
I promise.

1106
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:24,527
I'm going to give you an SSRI.

1107
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:27,196
Start with a low dosage,

1108
00:49:27,263 --> 00:49:29,482
and that'll help you
hold on to the serotonin

1109
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:31,033
that your brain
naturally makes anyway.

1110
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,402
And I'd like to see
you in about a week.

1111
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,324
(school bell ringing)

1112
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:41,877
Hey.

1113
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,379
Well, it's over.

1114
00:49:43,446 --> 00:49:44,497
What?

1115
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,132
My campaign.

1116
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:48,217
I'll never get elected
prom queen now.

1117
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:50,970
Can I show you something?

1118
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,759
It's my girlfriend.

1119
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,296
I used to have another photo,
but... I like this one better.

1120
00:50:02,482 --> 00:50:04,100
Why?

1121
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:07,119
She looks terrible.
You think so?

1122
00:50:07,187 --> 00:50:09,388
Mm-hmm.
'Cause I think it's the first one

1123
00:50:09,456 --> 00:50:12,074
where you can really see her.

1124
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:23,252
(whispers):
Thank you.

1125
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:25,504
I'll see you in
Glee rehearsal, okay?

1126
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,656
She's, like, an inspiration.

1127
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:30,259
One of us.
One who overcame.

1128
00:50:30,326 --> 00:50:32,995
I always thought she was just
some kind of stuck-up bitch,

1129
00:50:33,046 --> 00:50:34,630
but she's really
one of the people.

1130
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:35,715
Yeah, totally.

1131
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,216
Yeah.

1132
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,718
Holy crap, it's her.

1133
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:39,769
Totally.

1134
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,303
You have our votes, Lucy.

1135
00:50:41,355 --> 00:50:42,388
Totally.

1136
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:43,639
Thanks.

1137
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,025
(quietly): I'll try
not to let you down.

1138
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:47,843
This just in:
Jacob Ben Israel's

1139
00:50:47,894 --> 00:50:51,147
queen poll has you up by 40%.

1140
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:55,651
I... suppose I...

1141
00:50:55,702 --> 00:50:57,703
had that result coming.

1142
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,789
It's not cool...

1143
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:02,491
what I did to you,
and I apologize.

1144
00:51:04,378 --> 00:51:06,295
I respect you.

1145
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:11,167
I had to get a nose job
and go on a crazy diet

1146
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:13,169
to walk around this
school like I owned it.

1147
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,687
And you just do it.

1148
00:51:18,225 --> 00:51:21,093
Well, I have to admit...

1149
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:22,812
I have considered.
Going blonde.

1150
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,380
I'm not so sure.

1151
00:51:25,432 --> 00:51:26,482
Red, maybe.

1152
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:30,052
Ooh, that's a great idea.

1153
00:51:30,103 --> 00:51:31,053
Red.
(school bell ringing)

1154
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:33,656
Hey.

1155
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:37,559
Do you like my shirt
for Glee Club?

1156
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:39,495
It's perfect.
I know.

1157
00:51:39,562 --> 00:51:41,947
Check out mine.

1158
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:44,200
What? This is perfect.

1159
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:45,868
Legend has it that when
I came out of my mother,

1160
00:51:45,919 --> 00:51:47,369
I told the nurse she was fat.

1161
00:51:47,421 --> 00:51:49,588
Well...

1162
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:51,406
I made a different one for you.

1163
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,094
I'm Hispanic.

1164
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:58,013
Wait, was that supposed
to be "Lesbian"?

1165
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:59,581
Yeah, isn't that what it says?

1166
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:01,267
When you told me all
that stuff the other week,

1167
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:02,384
it meant so much to me.

1168
00:52:02,436 --> 00:52:04,253
To see you be so honest.

1169
00:52:04,304 --> 00:52:06,305
Especially 'cause I
know how bad it hurt.

1170
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,023
I was so proud of you.

1171
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:10,276
Yeah, well,
don't get used to it.

1172
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,644
And certainly don't even think
about telling anyone.

1173
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:13,612
Why not?

1174
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,397
You're like the most awesomest
girl at this school.

1175
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:17,116
Why would you try to hide any of that?
I'm dating Karofsky now.

1176
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,784
It's gross.

1177
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,453
You don't get a say
in who I date anymore.

1178
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,204
Why not,
because I'm dating somebody?

1179
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,490
Because you're Lebanese
and I think I'm bi-curious?

1180
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:28,577
No. Because I said
I love you.

1181
00:52:28,628 --> 00:52:29,995
You didn't say
you love me back.

1182
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,214
I do love you. Clearly
you don't love you

1183
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:33,632
as much as I do or
you'd put the shirt on

1184
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:35,551
and you would dance with me.

1185
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,121
(school bell ringing)

1186
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:03,412
(school bell ringing)

1187
00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:06,481
(talking and laughing)

1188
00:53:06,533 --> 00:53:07,983
All right, guys.

1189
00:53:08,034 --> 00:53:09,118
Listen up.

1190
00:53:09,169 --> 00:53:11,253
You all did really good
this week.

1191
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,789
It was tough, but I think
we came closer as a team

1192
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,157
and I'm proud of you.

1193
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:17,960
And now, I'd like to be
the first one to show off

1194
00:53:18,011 --> 00:53:20,262
my custom T-shirt,
revealing something

1195
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,348
I was self-conscious about
in the past,

1196
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:25,467
something I was born with,

1197
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:28,220
something I've come to accept
about myself this past week.

1198
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,472
So, drumroll, Finn.

1199
00:53:30,524 --> 00:53:33,726
(drumroll)

1200
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,644
(laughter)

1201
00:53:35,695 --> 00:53:37,613
I like your chin,
Mr. Shue.

1202
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,198
Yeah, I would've went
with "Tears up a lot."

1203
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:40,449
Uh, is everyone here?

1204
00:53:40,516 --> 00:53:42,067
RACHEL:
Not everybody.

1205
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,686
I wanted to thank you guys
for my Barbravention.

1206
00:53:44,738 --> 00:53:46,739
And I have
an announcement to make.

1207
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,374
I went to my doctor

1208
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,075
and...

1209
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,077
I canceled my appointment.

1210
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:54,880
And then I went home

1211
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,216
and I made this.

1212
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,300
WILL:
Whoa.

1213
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,719
(laughter)

1214
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:02,888
So, unfortunately I can't join
in on today's dance number.

1215
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,807
My doctor said I have to stay
away from vigorous choreography

1216
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,175
while my nose heals.

1217
00:54:06,226 --> 00:54:07,977
So thanks for being patient.

1218
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,396
And, Finn, next time,

1219
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,314
watch out for the schnoz.
(rimshot)

1220
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,049
Where's Santana?

1221
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,569
Probably off somewhere
making out with Karofsky.

1222
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:19,071
Yeah, he can have her.

1223
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:20,522
