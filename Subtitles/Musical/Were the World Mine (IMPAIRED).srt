00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,979
Let's see...

165
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:18,615
With your coloring,
I would say maybe...

166
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,319
Lilac Delight.
Yes!

167
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:31,032
Strong women wear lipstick.

168
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,308
Too strong.

169
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:42,009
"I see their knavery.

170
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,481
This is to make
an ass of me.

171
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,917

173
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,289
You are dismissed.

174
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,288
Just so you know,
I'm growing out a goatee.

175
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,698
Oh?

176
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:13,606
Delightful!

177
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,176
Time's up!

178
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:23,449
We have ten minutes more.

179
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:25,854
What a team.
Your time is up!

180
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,451
Your little warriors
may enter in ten minutes.

181
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:31,690
Until then, the stage is ours.

182
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,358
That stage made
for better storage.

183
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,062
Where were we?

184
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,366
I was about to make
a fool of myself.

185
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,838
My dear, do not limit yourself.

186
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:47,970
Nora Fay can take you

187
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,208
to the edge of your imagination
and beyond.

188
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:51,772
Is this you?

189
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,943
Was.

190
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,748
- You a singer?
- Was.

191
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:56,253
Was this your husband?

192
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,085
Is.

193
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,057
Really?
In front of Morgan Hill?

194
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,559
Enough questions...

195
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,220
My kid just started there.

196
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,592
Did yours go there?

197
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:07,291
Oh, God, no!
I bore no children.

198
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:10,324
I thank the Lord above
for the grace he gave me

199
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,996
just to spawn Nora Fay.

200
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,163
Come, dear.

201
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:19,504
"And the youth, mistook by me,
Pleading for a lover's fee."

202
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:21,603
I don't even know
what I'm saying.

203
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,637
That will come.

"Shall we their

206
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,613
Agreed, indeed!

207
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,516
Let's sing.

208
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:39,694

230
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:08,767
I'm not shaving.

231
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,365
At least you're not
the jackass.

232
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:12,876
At least the jackass
doesn't have to wear a dress!

233
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,747
What is Thisby?

00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:18,578
Is that a chick?

Congratulations, gentlemen.

Awaken and empower
what's within!

237
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,898
Nice pipes.

238
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:39,633
I heard your audition.

239
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,175
I saw the list.

240
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,946
Good afternoon.

241
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:55,714
It's going to be superb.

242
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,346
So many fascinating...

243
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:01,792
I thought I told you my boys
don't got time for those parts.

244
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:04,556
Must I remind you that
Morgan Hill philosophy

245
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:08,464
clearly states that academics
transcends athletics?

246
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,663
Larry'll side with me
on this one.

247
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,842
I'll note you in my
book of memory.

248
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:22,637
Puck!

249
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,012
He's Puck in the play.

250
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,142
- What play?
- The senior play.

251
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,674
He's the main fairy.

252
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,414
- A fairy?
- It's a great part.

253
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,923
A fairy?!

254
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:34,515
A kick-ass fairy.

255
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,493
You have lines to memorize.

256
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,857
We need a plan of attack.

257
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,057
This is great.

258
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:46,097
Sick, aren't they?

259
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,469
Sick.

260
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,881
"I jest to Oberon
and make him smile

261
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,386
When I a fat and
bean-fed horse beguile,

262
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,615
Neighing in likeness
of a filly foal:

263
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,523
And sometime lurk I
in a gossip's bowl,

264
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,221
In very likeness
of a roasted crab,

265
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:12,593
And when she drinks,
against her lips I bob"

266

This is for Helena.

I've not forgotten
about your frock.

271
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,314
These are for the
Pyramus and Thisby finale,

272
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:42,053
which I have reinvented
as an incredibly hip song.

I'm honored.

This year's varsity rugby team
is one of the best

296
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:12,249
in the history
of our institution.

297
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:18,051
So, this has nothing to
do with time requirements?

298
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:20,956
We are concerned
about the tradition -

00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,756
members of the rugby team
portraying females?

Truth be told!

301
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,024
It's bad for morale.
You're embarrassing them!

302
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,796
Only because you've
trained them

303

to cast judgement
upon each other.

304
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:38,672
The Academy is concerned that we
are sending the wrong message.

305
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,304
The Academy has been
staging Shakespeare

306
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,814
in this fashion
for 56 years.

307
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:45,475
We live in a different time.

308
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,883
Your ignorance of the history
of this Academy

309
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,649
and the history of the
theater is offensive.

310
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:55,925
Women were prohibited by law
to act on the Elizabethan stage!

311
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,723
Men filled the void.

312
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:01,425
If this confabulation is about
your insecurities with sexuality

313
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,900
or the sexuality of
your warriors...

314
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:07,302
I don't have issues
with my sexuality!

A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM

Thank you, gentlemen.

I think my star quality
is rubbing off.

Why don't you rub up
on Max a little bit?

322
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,628
Maxie...
It's never gonna happen.

Mom!

330
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,150
Mom?!

331
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,527
Hey, Ms. Tebbit needs
a band for the play.

332
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:05,961
Really?

333
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,191
Hey!

334
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,408
Where we going?

335
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,470
It's wet out here.
You'll catch cold.

336
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,747
You look beautiful.

337
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:31,777
Right.

338
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,761
Training was good?

339
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:40,355
Apparently, I've got a lot
of learning to do.

340
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:41,387
She said that?

341
00:26:41,432 --> 00:26:43,059
I know I could sell the shit

342
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,092
if she'd just let me
out the door with it.

343
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,071
I miss your daddy.

344
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:57,846
- Dad's an asshole.
- We were better off.

345
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,880
What?

346
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,887
- You didn't even try.
- He kicked me out.

347
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:05,479
You left!

348
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:08,549
You can have him.
I'm fine.

349
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:09,992
So, you'd rather live
with Frankie again?

350
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,120
She a better mother?

351
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,187
You're my mother!
Like it or not.

352
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,802
Why are you gay?

353
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,671
What did I do?

354
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:29,244
You didn't make me queer.

355
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,440
Don't use that word, Timothy!

356
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:32,312
Nobody did.
I'm just queer.

357
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,114
- So deal with it.
- Go to hell!

358
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,316
I do deal with it, Timothy.
Every day I deal with it.

359
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:41,519
You're not the only one
who has it rough around here.

360
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,550
Every single day I come out
of the closet just like you.

361
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:46,028
This is not just your problem.

362
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:49,056

He said that?

371

Isn't he like super jock?

372
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,177
Come on, keep going.

373
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,583
Demetrius says,
"Yea, art thou there?"

374
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:59,523
"Follow my voice:
Will try no manhood here."

You'll need that manhood
for your jock boy!

That's not what it means.

It fell upon a little

The juice of it on
sleeping eye-lids laid

393

Will make or man

"The next thing then
she waking looks upon...

We'd love to have you

- It's a potluck!

403
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,651
No, for my son.
He's a fairy.

404
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,817
- A fairy?
- In a play.

405
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,918
Well, in real life, too.

406
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,929
He's gay.

407
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:42,364
My son is gay...

408
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,402
Or queer.

Now, with the soul of love

00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:11,057
I ask of you the memorization
of act three tonight.

Timothy.

415

How is your text coming?

416
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,607
I'm trying, but I don't
understand half of it.

417
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,611
Unite rhythm with words

418
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:31,012
and they will unlock
to empower you -

419

a lot of shit today!

No! Just stay there.

544
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:30,788
You need to go home
and think about Frankie.

545
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,867
Don't tell a soul about this.

546
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,637
About us?

547
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,541
My lips are sealed to quench
your sweet desire.

548
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,310
Max, goodbye.

549

550
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:54,914
What now?

551
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:03,017

someone love you, would you?

552
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:04,856

He really likes you.

557
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,703
Is that in danger of
changing by tomorrow morning?

558
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:19,709
He wanted you to know.

559
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:21,506
OK.

560
00:46:23,246 --> 00:46:25,737
There was an accident.

What is wrong with you?

I have got to say,

I vacillated after
that first meeting,

622

but you surprise me daily.

623
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,435
First impressions
aren't my thing.

They must be.

it was true love.

627
00:53:06,749 --> 00:53:07,681
Was it?

628
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:10,277
There are no limitations.

00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,847
I have none and you, too,
can rise above.

Remember, what you believe,
you will achieve.

That's my mom.

635
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:38,871
I'm Jonathon.

636
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:41,008
You have a brilliant son.

637
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:42,642
Oh, shit!

638
00:53:42,685 --> 00:53:43,674
Sorry.

639
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,449
We just had our nails done.

640
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:46,682
Nora Fay!

641
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,486
Mom, we've got to go.

642
00:53:48,524 --> 00:53:51,015
We've got a lot of...
practicing to do.

643
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:55,328
Timothy...
pleasure to finally meet.

644
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:59,495
And Jonathon Cordon!

645
00:53:59,535 --> 00:54:02,800
You look quite luminous.

646
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:04,170
I'm in love.

647
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:05,902
Yes.

648
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:09,641
This is exactly what I meant
by rising above, Donna.

649
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,112
Your son,

650
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:15,914
compatriots with
Morgan Hill's star rugby player!

651
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,113
We're not compatriots.
We're boyfriends!

652
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,681
I'm sorry.

653
00:54:22,825 --> 00:54:24,759
We have got to go!

654
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,631
<i>Johnny!</i>

655
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:37,465
Your son is a homosexual?

656
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,668
Ummm...

657
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,370
Yes, he is.

658
00:54:46,649 --> 00:54:48,344
Has your coach
lost his mind?

659
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:50,045
I've outgrown you.

660
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:53,122
Is this a joke?

661
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:55,249
Don't mock my love.

662
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:59,125
Who would not change
a raven for a dove?

663
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,720
What?

664
00:55:00,763 --> 00:55:01,923
Fly away.

665
00:55:01,964 --> 00:55:03,454
<i>How could he not</i>
<i>desire a woman?</i>

666
00:55:03,499 --> 00:55:04,864
It's unnatural!

667
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:06,459
Let's go!

668
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,030
Wait here.

669
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:12,666
You better pick me
up at seven!

670
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,345
You can take your
ugly makeup

671
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,972
and shove it up
your unlimited ass!

672
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,018
May God bless you
and show you the light!

673
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:28,546
I got your back, Mom.

674
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,183
Both of you!

675
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,326
Get out of my way!

676
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,956
Timothy! What the hell is that?

677
00:55:35,998 --> 00:55:38,523
Ohhhh! My mascara!

678
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,961
Let her walk in one
of my shoes a while.

679
00:55:42,004 --> 00:55:45,098
My eyes are tingling!

680
00:55:52,281 --> 00:55:54,306
Donna...

681
00:55:54,350 --> 00:56:00,653
Donna, Donna, Donna,
Donna, Donna...

682
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:07,321
Be not so bashful,
darling rare divine,

683
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:12,801
these luscious kissing
cherry lips are mine.

684
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,049
I'd like to welcome everyone

685
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:30,575
to the 56th Annual Morgan Hill
Spring Festival!

686
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,986
We are honored to have
several special guests

687
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,718
to help us ring in
this weekend's festivities.

688
00:56:35,758 --> 00:56:38,955
First and foremost,
the honorable Mayor Robbins!

689
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,261
We were also hoping
to have a representative

690
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:46,859
from one of our sponsors -

691
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,895
my beautiful wife,
Nora Bellinger -

692
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,874
but she is most likely
still out soliciting

693
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,503
some lucky townsperson.

694
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,818
Let's not go.

695
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:04,649
Why?

696
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:07,383
You're different now.

697
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,591
What about
Cotton Candy Mountain?

698
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:12,856
I'm don't think
you're ready for this.

699
00:57:12,895 --> 00:57:14,988
I cross my heart.

700
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,328
Seriously.

701
00:57:16,365 --> 00:57:18,356
I was beaten up
for being queer

702
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,130
before I even knew
what that was.

703
00:57:20,169 --> 00:57:22,228
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

704
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:24,603
I don't need someone
to protect me.

705
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,938
You didn't even
like me yesterday, remember?

706
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,876
Sure, I did.

707
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:31,675
But I fell in love
with you today.

708
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,648
- Come on.
- Stop.

709
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,020
- You are perfection.
- That's the pansy talking.

710
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,546
Come on!

711
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,050
It'll be fun.

712
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:45,560
There's a kissing booth.

713
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:50,924
<i>And last, but not least,</i>
<i>our very own, Coach Driskill!</i>

714
00:57:56,205 --> 00:57:58,230
I love this man!

715
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:05,238
If he's here with that fag,
I'll kill him!

716
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:07,215
You are completely
prettier than him.

717
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:09,349
<i>I love this school.</i>

718
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:13,716
Our love for one another

719
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:19,319
shines brighter than
the lights on this midway!

720
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:37,042
I hate this town.

721
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:39,047
I can't wait to graduate

722
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:40,878
and get the hell out
of this place forever.

723
00:58:42,084 --> 00:58:43,642
It's not that bad.

724
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,018
Try looking at it
through my eyes.

725
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,390
What about your family?

726
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,586
You mean my mom?

727
00:58:51,627 --> 00:58:52,924
Everyone.

728
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:55,931
It's just my mom...
on a good day.

729
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:03,998
- I don't want to go back.
- To what?

730
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,302
Real life.

731
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:06,706
This is real.

732
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:11,879
But so, so far from where
I woke up this morning.

733
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,752
People were staring at us.

734
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,518
Stare back.

735
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:27,524
People are just jealous...

736
00:59:27,563 --> 00:59:29,622
'cause I'm with
the best fellow in town.

737
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,579
People can change.

738
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,856
If they experienced that,
they might.

739
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,528
<i>Look.</i>

740
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:11,269
How many people
are in this town?

741
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:13,673
Ten-thousand, maybe.

742
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:18,473
Let's go.

743
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:21,142
- Why?
- I've got people to change.

744
01:00:30,626 --> 01:00:31,752
Game's over, sport!

745
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:32,783
What?

746
01:00:32,828 --> 01:00:33,954
I missed you.

747
01:00:33,996 --> 01:00:35,827
Get the hell off of him!

748
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,065
Leave him alone!

749
01:00:40,102 --> 01:00:41,296
He's just messin'
with your head.

750
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:42,395
He's mine!

751
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:44,030
Stop teasing him and go
back to your cheerleader!

752
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:46,598
Any love I had
for her is gone, I swear.

753
01:00:46,642 --> 01:00:48,974
Max, you love Frankie!
You know I know.

754
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:50,535
Yes! Thank you.

755
01:00:52,214 --> 01:00:53,909
I love you.

756
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,411
When I vow, I weep.

757
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:58,443
My tears do tell the truth.

758
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:02,249
I am going insane, officially!

759
01:01:04,226 --> 01:01:06,217
Found the fags!

760
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:10,161
You asshole!

761
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:13,400
Stop it!

762
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:16,067
He's mine!

763
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,572
No! No!

764
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,776
Can you please
let me in on this!

765
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,475
Who is this goddess?

766
01:01:26,515 --> 01:01:27,573
Nymph!

767
01:01:27,616 --> 01:01:29,846
- Perfect!
- Divine!

768
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:38,492
Timothy, I love you.

769
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:41,452
I swear on my life I do.

770
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:42,828
I love you more
than he ever could.

771
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,264
Prove it!

772
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,597
You want to fight?

773
01:01:45,634 --> 01:01:46,931
You're on, jock boy!

775
01:01:50,005 --> 01:01:51,632
- You comin'?
- Let loose!

776
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:55,969
Be certain.
I don't love you anymore.

777
01:01:56,011 --> 01:01:58,002
Follow, if you dare.

778
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:04,549
Get off me!

822
01:09:04,339 --> 01:09:06,170
<i>And this morning</i>
<i>we looked at each other</i>

823
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:10,440
<i>and we just knew</i>
<i>this was the right thing.</i>

824

<i>We have a new</i>
<i>perspective on life.</i>

825

<i>What about family values?</i>

826
01:09:14,449 --> 01:09:16,007
<i>What about 'em?</i>

827
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:18,417
<i>We have families.</i>
<i>We have values.</i>

828
01:09:19,888 --> 01:09:23,483
Come on, Frankie,
answer the damn phone.

829
01:09:40,008 --> 01:09:41,475
Over there, look!

830
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:45,708
Gay... gay...
gay and gay!

831
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:50,947
We'll find him.

832
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:08,296
Driskill!

833
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:09,964
Why the hell
are you still here?

834
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:11,836
I missed you.

835
01:10:11,873 --> 01:10:14,000
What the hell's
gotten in to you?

836
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:16,203
That speech last night,
the dancing at practice...

837
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:18,042
We were refining
the essentials needed

838
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,139
to play a skillful game.

839
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:25,448
My wife wouldn't let me
in the house last night.

840
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:30,322
That makes two of us -
unlucky in love this morning.

841
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:32,452
She said,
"The course of true love...

842
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:34,860
never did run smooth."

843
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:39,225
<i>[knocking on door]</i>

844

Oh, Lawrence!

845

Dr. Bellinger!
Open up!

846
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,999
Dr. Bellinger, my family
was eating dinner last night

847
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,204
and Cole said,
"I love Cooper!

848
01:10:50,245 --> 01:10:52,304
And I want everyone
to know it."

849
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:55,843
This is not my little Cole!

850
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:57,351
There's been something
odd about him

851
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:58,910
ever since he
started that play.

852
01:10:58,954 --> 01:10:59,716
And now...

853
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:01,882
Has it ever occurred to you
that I have problems too?!

854
01:11:01,923 --> 01:11:03,857
You need to fix this!

855
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,223
Dr. Bellinger!

856
01:11:14,936 --> 01:11:16,233
Look!

857
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:17,599

<i>[horn beeping]</i>

Donna, darling!

861
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:29,476
Oh, shit.

<i>Donna!</i>

I found her!

Oh, Donna, look at you!

866
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:43,159
How fresh and lovely
you look this morning.

867
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:43,892
Go!

868
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:07,151
He hasn't been here.

869
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:07,382
He'll turn up.

870
01:12:07,422 --> 01:12:09,890
Yeah, in a ditch somewhere
with a hole in his head!

871

<i>[knocking on door]</i>

Don't get it.

873
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:17,361
- What if it's him?
- What if it's not?

874
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:21,058
Good morning.

875
01:12:21,703 --> 01:12:23,967
Frankie! How's your song?

876
01:12:24,005 --> 01:12:25,302
Where's Timothy?

877
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,932
He didn't come
home last night.

878
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:29,170
Where is my son?

879
01:12:29,211 --> 01:12:31,338
There's a meeting
at Morgan Hill.

880
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,472
Is he in trouble?

881
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:33,640
You should come with me.

882
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,172
What about the play?

883
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:36,775
The play will go on...

884
01:12:36,818 --> 01:12:39,048
just don't you
forget your guitar.

885
01:12:42,457 --> 01:12:45,915
I am not leaving my son
in this place one day longer!

886
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:47,519
Please stay calm, sir.

887
01:12:47,562 --> 01:12:49,587
No one needs
to remove their child

888
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:51,292
from this institution!

889
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:52,925
Where is Ms. Tebbit?

890
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:55,230
This is my son.

891
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,897
I found him
this morning in bed

892
01:12:56,938 --> 01:12:58,906
with his best friend Russ.

893
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:00,965
They were holding
each other and kissing.

894
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:04,001
Believe me, I taught them
both a lesson.

895
01:13:04,045 --> 01:13:06,070
"The course of true love
never did run smooth."

896
01:13:06,114 --> 01:13:07,581
What did you say?

897
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:09,948
My son said the same thing!

898
01:13:10,118 --> 01:13:11,745
Ladies and gentlemen,

899
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:15,416
what we have here is
a kind of coercive persuasion.

900
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:18,153
- I'm in love!
- No, you're not!

901
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:21,294
Has everyone gone insane?

902
01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:23,422
He's in love!

903
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:24,762
Love!

904
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,098
The Bible states
that homosexuality

905
01:13:27,135 --> 01:13:29,865
is contagious -
in all sorts of ways.

906
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,702
It's that alternative
teacher and her Shakespeare!

907
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,571
Shakespeare was queer, too!

908
01:13:33,608 --> 01:13:35,508
- It's wicked!
- Do something!

909
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,314
Ladies and Gentlemen,

910
01:13:41,349 --> 01:13:43,044
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
is hereby cancelled.

911
01:13:43,084 --> 01:13:44,381
No!

912
01:13:44,419 --> 01:13:47,217
That is entirely
unfair to the boys!

913
01:13:47,255 --> 01:13:49,018
They've been
working so hard...

914
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:52,254
And I am putting Ms. Tebbit
under a full investigation.

915
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,625
Firstly...

916
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:03,137
Mr. William Shakespeare
has never been proven

917
01:14:03,171 --> 01:14:05,901
to be a homosexual.

918
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:09,274
Bisexual, perhaps.

919
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:13,270
Regardless, if you will all
kindly return this evening

920
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:18,617
for the play, I'm sure we
will all make amends.

921
01:14:18,653 --> 01:14:21,451
- My son's not coming!
- No!

922
01:14:22,924 --> 01:14:26,121
The play must go on!

923
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:31,098
Your concerns will fade
like a nightmare,

924
01:14:31,132 --> 01:14:36,934
or with any luck,
a clandestine dream come true.

925
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:52,147
I must locate your son.

926
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:55,623
My words will appease
them only momentarily.

927
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,249
We looked everywhere.

928
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:59,021

1117
01:29:54,922 --> 01:29:56,753
See you on Monday, Coach?

1118
01:29:58,626 --> 01:30:00,651

You were
unbelievable tonight.

01:30:22,983 --> 01:30:25,850
Don't you feel...

1122
01:30:25,886 --> 01:30:27,854
I feel like myself.

1123
01:30:27,888 --> 01:30:31,517
"It's not enough to speak,
but to speak true."

1124
01:30:33,627 --> 01:30:36,562
Dude, awesome job!

1125
01:30:38,232 --> 01:30:40,723
You two love birds
better be at my party.

1126
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,759
It's gonna be beyond!

1127
01:31:10,664 --> 01:31:12,757
Who's next?
