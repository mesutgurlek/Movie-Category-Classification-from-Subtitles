I... I... I followed
this dog.

- Yeah?

I-I just wanted some of the sausage
I helped him get.

255

that's him! O-Over there.

Hello. Oh, lovely evening.

295
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:28,725
I was just saying this
to your two lovely,

296
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,763
- purebred Dobermans.
- The money, Fagin.

297
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:33,486
Actually, I've got something
much better than money.

298
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:38,402
Some luxury items that should make
a considerable dent in my debt to you.

299
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:41,923
Oh, my!
You waxed your car, didn't you?

Did they use the buffer on it,
because I can see myself.

301
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:48,200
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

302
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:53,244
I don't want
your garbage, Fagin!

303
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:55,602
Oh, please, Sykes.
Oh, please. Oh, please.

304
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:58,565
I don't think you grasp...

305
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:00,842
the severity
of the situation.

306
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,726
Oh, no!
Oh, no, I did grasp it.

307
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:07,879
This is how I grasp. Look.
[Screams, Stammering]

308
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:09,798
Accident.

309
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:12,196
Accident!
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

310
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:15,085
- Mr Fagin!
- Sorry.

311
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:19,206
Now, I lent you money
and I don't see it.

312
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:23,565
Do you know what happens when
I don't see my money, Fagin?

313
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:25,603
- [Wheezing]
- People get hurt.

314
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,955
- People like you get hurt.
- [Gasps]

315
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:35,405
- Do I make myself clear?
- [Coughs]

316

[Squeaking]
Clear! Perfectly clear!

317
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:40,444
Ya know, Rita,
I can't figure out...

318
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:42,757
why you'd rather hang around
a dump like this...

319
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:46,681
when you could be living uptown
with a class act like myself.

320
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:51,887
Isn't it rather dangerous to use one's
entire vocabulary in a single sentence?

321
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:55,403
[Laughing] Hey, Frankie, get down,
brother. You bad, man.

322
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:58,763
- Hey, you got something
to say to me, fat boy?
- [Stammering]

323
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,315
Come on, you guys don't scare me.
I'll kill you both.

324

- Come on, let me at 'em! [Growling]
- [Doberman Chuckles]

Go ahead. Let him go.

326
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:09,559
Why don't you pick
on someone your own size?

327
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:12,036
- Like you, old man?
- [Dodger] Hey, Roscoe.

328
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,881
Roscoe, is this us
losing our sense of humour?

329
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:19,721
Nah. I ain't lost
my sense of humour.

Please.
Oh, please!

Three sunrises.
Three sunsets.

Three days, Fagin.

Three sunrises.
Three sunsets.

337
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,675
Three days.
Three, three, three. That's nine.

338
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:47,440
- Nine?
- No, Fagin.

339
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:49,438
- Three.
- Three!

340
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:51,518
Oh, you mean,
just three days?

Oh, my goodness!

00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:06,560
Hey, hey, Roscoe.
Look what I found.

346
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:09,286
Forget it, DeSoto.
We gotta go.

347
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,518
I like cats.
I like to eat 'em.

Get out of my way,
Dodger.

00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:24,998
That's enough, Roscoe.

- [Horn Honking]

Come on, DeSoto.

356
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:45,163
We ain't finished, Dodger.
You guys are gonna pay for this,

357
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:48,045
starting with that cat.

358
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:51,836
Oh, yeah? You guys don't scare me!
Come on and say it to my face!

359
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:54,760
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

Yeah, those creeps'll think twice
before hassling us, man. [Chuckles]

All right, kid.
What'd I tell you guys?

362

OI' Dodge can
really pick 'em, huh?

How am I ever gonna come up
with all that money? [Crying]

368

What's the use? I'll never get out
from under that maniac.

Thanks, guys.

[Laughing]
That reminds me.

374
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:11,920
I saw DeSoto's nose.
Who did that?

375
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,522
You? You.

376
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:20,680

tonight.

Umm, let's see.
[Muttering]

Here we are. Here we are.
Chapter seven. [Clears Throat]

387
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:04,005
"Sparky stopped and he rolled in
a field of wildflowers.

388
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:06,396
The dandelions tickled
his nose...

389
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:10,036
- 'til he laughed out loud.
- [Heavy Panting]

390
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:12,687
And then
something caught his eye.

391
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,637
It was Bumper the rabbit.

392
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:18,558
Sparky jumped to his feet...

393
00:24:18,647 --> 00:24:21,923
and ran toward Bumper
barking loudly. "

[Weakly]
Woof. Woof.

Well, you try it
sometime.

[Clears Throat]
Ruff! R-Ruff!

397
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:33,077
Well, that's because
you're a dog.

398
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:37,001
"Sparky knew that Bumper would run and
that he could chase him over the field.

399
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:39,999
But Sparky would never catch him
or hurt him...

400
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,362
because Sparky
was not that kind of a dog."

your cat again."

Oh, no.

756
00:48:13,886 --> 00:48:17,879
Georgette,
something terrible has happened.

757
00:48:17,966 --> 00:48:21,003
- They've kidnapped Oliver.

Oh, Georgette,
you loved him too.

We're going to get him back.

[Fagin] This is an airtight plan,
Sykes. Sweet and simple.

762
00:48:35,926 --> 00:48:40,477
I ransom the kitty, and you
get paid in full tomorrow.

763
00:48:40,566 --> 00:48:44,241
I'll even toss in a little extra
for your patience. [Guffawing]

764
00:48:44,326 --> 00:48:48,638
Whaddya say? It's my final offer.
Take it or leave it.

768
00:49:04,726 --> 00:49:07,923
[Nervous Chuckling]
Oh! Good question.

769
00:49:08,006 --> 00:49:13,285
But listen... if you're busy,
we can drop by some other time.

770

You start with the knuckles.

Huh? Yeah.

780
00:49:47,446 --> 00:49:51,803
And then, what's-what's the last thing
you do? You put on the cement shoes.

781
00:49:51,886 --> 00:49:57,358

- So, Fagin.

783

and wrinkly to make me happy?
- Sykes,

784

I've got an airtight k-kitty...

Oh, Georgette,
I can't read this.

807

Well, there was
a few smudges on it, okay.

814
00:51:47,446 --> 00:51:50,882
I went outside the line with
the green crayon... but not that much.

815

- Oh, Dodge.
- Fagin] A child could read that map.

Hey, Rita,
they never laid a paw on me.

Ooh, wait. What if he comes
and he's huge and mean?

- Excuse me, sir.
- [Yelping] It's the F.B.I.!

What're you doin'
down here anyway?

829
00:52:31,926 --> 00:52:34,281
I came to find my kitty.

00:52:34,366 --> 00:52:37,244
- Your kitty?
- Somebody stole 'im.

But-But, uh,
are you sure?

832
00:52:40,006 --> 00:52:41,997
- Maybe you made a m-m-mistake.

- That's all I have.
- That's awful.

838
00:52:57,406 --> 00:53:01,797
I know. And what kind of a person
would steal a poor, little kitty?

839
00:53:01,886 --> 00:53:04,923
But I...
I mean, maybe he...

840
00:53:05,006 --> 00:53:08,635
Maybe he was up against the wall;
at the end of his rope.

841

[Sobbing]

842
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:14,002
He must have been
a poor, desperate man.

It's still wrong!

844
