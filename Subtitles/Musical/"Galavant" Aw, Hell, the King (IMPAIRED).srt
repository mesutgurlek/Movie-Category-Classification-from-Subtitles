00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:54,305
Sweetheart...

162
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:57,608
As you know, we're very sorry
about Galavant ditching you.

163
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:59,743
He dropped you like a plague rat.

164
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:01,378
But it's been several days,

165
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:04,615
and that biological sundial
of yours continues to grow long

166
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:06,450
- if you know what I mean.
- You're 25!

167
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:09,186
My mother was a great-grandmother by then!

168
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:10,588
And while we're happy you agreed

169
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,223
to be forced to marry your cousin,

170
00:06:12,224 --> 00:06:14,992
maybe it's time to start
making some decisions, hmm?

171
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:16,527
At least meet the wedding planner.

172
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:18,128
He's very excited to meet you.

173
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,763
I don't care about any of it

174
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:21,665
if I'm not marrying someone I love.

175
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,500
[Laughing] Oh, sweetheart! [Laughs]

176
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:25,502

Oh...My...God.

186
00:06:56,134 --> 00:06:58,369
Those curtains used to be my sheets.

187
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,204
I know because I had the R's embroidered

with the plucked hairs of
all the kingdom's redheads!

189
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:04,041
You'll find we've turned
everything from the castle

00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,408
into something for the common good.

191
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:09,313
Are you sure you're not planning
some big surprise

192
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:11,315
where you're gonna wheel away
some huge wagon

193

to reveal you've rebuilt
my castle but only better, huh?

Oh, great. That's what it is now.

It's not "My King" or "Your

It's "buddy."

God!

201
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:32,102
I have a question.

202
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:33,504
Do you still have an army?

203
00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:35,873
A citizen's army, yeah.

204
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:38,275
Good. I'd like to use it
to invade Hortensia.

Absolutely not.

Really?

207
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:43,180
Well, hang on.
I thought this was a democracy.

208
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:45,149
Aren't you supposed
to let the people decide?

Oh, yeah.

- Okay.

Now, I can't imagine
a free people ever voting

to send an army into an
open-ended foreign conflict

215
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,164
which profits only the few.

Well, when I was younger,
I had a recurring nightmare.

237
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:45,218
But then my mom helped me
figure out what it meant,

238
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:46,286
and it went away.

239
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:49,022
No, this is more complicated than that.

240
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:50,424
It's more of a riddle.

I'm always holding king Richard's crown!

How about "die for the guy
who wants his gal"?

on your name, and it rhymes.

482
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:15,584
Aah!

483
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:16,985
[Blows]

484
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:18,554
You did this to me!

485
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,756
- Aah!
- [Door opens]

486
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:23,158
Shh! Are you trying to get me killed?!

487
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:25,694
I saw his head! It was right there!

488
00:18:25,695 --> 00:18:27,329
And it was giving me that look.

489
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,266
My King, I think I know what's going on.

490
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:32,968
Richard was your friend.

491
00:18:32,969 --> 00:18:36,839
And, yes, you took his throne
and his queen and his kingdom

492
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,640
and his favorite shirts
and his weekly bridge game...

493
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:39,842
Oh, get on with it!

494
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:43,979
But the fact you feel bad
about it is a good thing.

495
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,916
It means you're actually,
surprisingly, human.

496
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:50,218
Maybe I do feel guilty.

497
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,256
I do miss the old bastard.

498
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:57,393
Look, there was one other thing

499
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:58,993
my mother used to do for my dreams.

500
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:05,200

506
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:26,321
There's one more in there.

507
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:28,022
Oh.

508
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:37,199
So, what now?

509
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,802
I'm off to Hortensia to rescue Isabella,

510
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,070
recruit some soldiers along the way,

511
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:45,073
and after that, march to
Valencia to reclaim her kingdom.

512
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:47,743
Well, I have a surprise.

513
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:50,379
Your old pal Rick's gonna join you!

514
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,080
What? No. No, no, no, no.

515
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:54,550
You said you were gonna stay
here and figure out who you are.

516
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:56,518
And I did. I realized I'm the guy

517
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,020
who's going to help you rescue Isabella.

518
00:19:58,021 --> 00:19:59,655
Even though, technically,

519
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,390
I'm the guy who started the whole disaster.

520
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:03,025
So, what do you say?

521
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,660
Why not?

522
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,995
Awesome! You, me, Roberta.

523
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:08,330
Oh, this is Roberta, by the way.

524
00:20:08,331 --> 00:20:10,332
Do you remember her
from... from the election?

525
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,667
She stood up, pledged to join me.

526
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,901
Watch this.

527
00:20:12,902 --> 00:20:15,103
Oh, Roberta?

528
00:20:15,104 --> 00:20:16,872
Yes, My King?

529
00:20:16,873 --> 00:20:18,173
She calls me "king."

530
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:19,174
Oh, my God.

531
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:21,009
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun!

532
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:21,944
No, it's not.

533
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:23,378
Well, we should probably go.

534
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:25,581
I stole these horses and just
set fire to the Rec Center.

535
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:28,049
Dismantle my castle, will you?

536
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:30,952
[Cheers and applause]

537
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,892
Princess Isabella,

538
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:39,795
isn't there something
you might want to say?

539
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:42,331
[Sighs] Good news, everyone!

540
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:44,299
I've set a date for my wedding.

541
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,470
It's in six weeks, and you're all invited!

[Fanfare]

544
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:55,711
Does something seem different
about Princess Isabella?

545
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:59,248
Who cares? She's getting married!

546
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:00,716
Boom! Boom!

547
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,518
[Cheers and applause continue]
