you were an entirely different scale.

Yeah. And I think
that there is a perfect part.

Do you really believe you're ready
for such a monumental step?

94
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,935
Daddy, the main reason
I buy such expensive shoes

95
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,937
is to take monumental steps.

96
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,148
Sweetheart, when you graduated
from high school almost a year ago,

97
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,232
do you remember what you said to me?

00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,152
"How come no one makes
a cap and gown in hot pink?"

No.

"How come you get a car and driver
and I don't?"

101
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,281
- No.
- "Good luck finding anyone

"to fill the talent-less void
of boring and unattractive

- "once I graduate"?
- No.

105
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,416
Yes, but you also said
that you needed a year to find yourself,

106
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,376
to figure out what came next in your life.

107
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,128
That year's almost up,
and you haven't found anything.

108
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:42,090
It's a small town. I mean,
there's only so many places to look.

109
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,385
Besides, I did find something.
A show I wanna be in.

110
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,887
This is more than just a show.

111
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,431
You're talking about going it alone
in the big city.

112
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,684
Right! To star on Broadway
with Amber Lee Adams.

113
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,187
Could you really deny the world
that opportunity?

114
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,647
I'm sorry, princess.
But nothing you've shown me

115
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,816
convinces me
you're ready for something like this.

116

Okay, ladies. Team Sharpay.

So, what does that mean?

You pout, throw a tantrum,

and he buys you a new Burberry bag
to make you feel better?

00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,124
That's good, but no.

122
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,794
It means we show him I'm determined.

123
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,421
And when I make up my mind...
And no one is better with make-up.

Constance, who tweeted Bethany,

who has an ex-friend
who she caught with her boyfriend,

130
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,185
who she then dumped,
so now Kara's her friend again,

131
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:39,398
who knows of a New York apartment
available in a luxury townhouse.

132
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,900
That is, like, the best house you can get
in terms of towns.

133
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,694
- Sounds perfect.
- It gets better.

134
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,321
- It can't.
- But it does.

from both Chanel and wicked.

New York is calling.

And this is one call
that is not going to voice-mail.

So, by way of review,
this is my shoe closet,

that is my bedroom,

158

these are my new clothes
and where I'll wear them,

00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,022
(SIGHING)
I'm just not totally convinced.

161
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,982
Daddy, you said
I haven't shown you anything

162
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,066
to let you know I'm ready for this.

163
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,195
But, look, I took matters
into my own hands,

164
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,280
and without even
chipping my manicure.

165
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,700
Sweetheart, it's not as easy
as putting pictures on boards.

166
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,994
But I've worked everything out!

167
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,455
And used this pointer.

168
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,541
- I don't know...
- Please, Daddy.

169
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,544
Alone, in New York?

170
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,634
My dear college friend, Michelle,
has a son that goes to NYU.

171
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,469
I've met him. He's a very nice boy.

172
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,555
I could ask her to make sure
that he keeps his eye on you.

173
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,351
Are you sure
you're ready to take this on?

174
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,685
SHARPAY: I know I can do this.

175
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,521
I know it like I know
purple washes me out

176
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,566
and that my eyes are the exact same
distance apart to be a supermodel.

177
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,818
What I don't know
is whether you believe in me.

178
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,073
Mom seems to.

179
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,747
(SIGHING HEAVILY)

180
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,501
Okay, you have my blessing.

181
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,086
(SQUEALING) Thank you, Daddy!

182
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,548
I'll call my friend Michelle
and have her talk to her son.

183
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,550
Thanks, Mom.

184
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,928
There's just one condition.

185
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,055
Fine. I love a good conditioner.

186
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,390
You have one month.

187
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,642
I'll fly you to New York,
I'll pay for your penthouse,

188
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,435
but you have to
get yourself in that show

189
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,813
and prove to me
you can take care of yourself.

190
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,939
One month.

191
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,899
- Deal?
- So deal!

192
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,443
But if it doesn't work out,
you come back here and work for me.

193
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,988
At the country club.

194
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,781
(STAMMERING)

195
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,199
- Work?
- A job.

196
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,201
That's the deal.

197
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,787
Prove yourself, or come back
in a month and work for me.

198
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,623
Fine. Prove myself it is!

199
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,178
- Look!
- (BOI BARKS)

200
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,931
Look, Boi, look!

201
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,662
- Sharpay?
- In the flesh and pastels!

202
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,206
- We've been awaiting your arrival.
- Then the wait's over!

203
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,291
We spoke on the phone.

204
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,418
I'm Marjorie Grande,
the manager for the building.

205
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,586
My pleasure.

206
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,254
Please, follow me to the penthouse.

207
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,380
SHARPAY: Ooh!

208
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,441
(SIGHS HAPPILY)

209
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,537
I hope this is to your liking.

210
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,333
No. It's to my loving!
Boi, you've gotta see this.

211
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,050
- That's a dog.
- Try to get him to believe that.

212
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,386
I'm sorry.
There are no dogs in the building.

213
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,930
Sure there are. See?

214
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,933
The members of the co-op board
have a strict no-dog policy.

215
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,560
Well...

216
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,647
My father heads
our country club board,

217
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,191
so I'm sure that gives me
some kind of board immunity.

218
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,152
Miss Sharpay, this building
is pleased to have you.

219
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,987
This dog...

220
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,572
Not so pleased.

221
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:45,578
Miss Grande, Ma'am. If he goes, I go.

222
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,888
What are you doing?

223
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,350
PEYTON: Filming you.
Just keep doing what you're doing.

224
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,519
Do you always just film
totally stunning people on the street

225
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,104
that you don't know?

226
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,065
Only when I think the subject
is interesting.

227
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:19,779
And you look baffled and scared
and really pink.

228
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,907
So, yeah, interesting.

229
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,203
Are you paparazzi?

230
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,457
I'm a film student at NYU,
working on a short film.

231
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,919
The assignment is to capture
one unique New York story.

232
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,254
Maybe you're it.

233
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,965
So, you decided to film me
without my permission,

234
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,425
just for a school assignment?

235
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,178
- Yep.
- How dare you!

236
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,054
And my left side is better for close-ups.

237
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,389
(LAUGHS)

238
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,433
I'm Peyton.

239
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,983
Sharpay Evans. Actress, heiress,
soon to be Broadway legend.

240
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,611
- Wait!
- About 105,

241
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,988
- but it's really not polite to ask.
- No...

242
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,073
I should know my own weight, okay?

243
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:08,244
No, I'm Peyton Leverett.
Our moms went to college together.

244
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,998
This is crazy!
I was on my way up to your apartment

245
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,000
to make sure you were okay.
And here you are.

246
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:17,420
Right, they told me to expect you.
Well, glad we could finally meet.

247
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,256
- Oh, and this is Boi.
- Well, nice to meet you, Boi.

248
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,341
(BARKS)

249
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,011
So, why are you out here?
Is everything okay?

250
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,805
Not really.

251
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,600
When I rented this apartment online,
it never said they don't allow dogs.

252
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,020
And now they won't let us live here.
Yeah, well, it's their loss!

253
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:39,150
- Do you have someplace else to go?
- Okay, it's my loss and their loss!

254
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,903
(SIGHING) Actually, the only place
I have to go is home.

255
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,655
And trust me, that is not an option!

256
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,575
Listen, there's an empty studio
in my building, if you're interested.

257
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,203
I'm friends with the building manager.
I'm sure I can make a call.

258
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,413
And...

259
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,833
Well, I'm sure I can make a call
and arrange something.

260
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,376
Maybe get you to see it.

261
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,169
(SIGHS)

262
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:02,048
Well, since I don't seem to have
any other options.

263
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,552
Bellman!

264
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,227
Oh, yeah, right. (LAUGHS)

265
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,108
Seriously?

266
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,536
Careful with those!
This is all I have to get by on

267
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,830
until the truck arrives
with the bulk of my things.

268
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,594
(SCREAMING)

269
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:48,970
Oh! That's good.

270
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,347
Okay, now, go outside,
and then come back in

271
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,684
and give me even more of that
it's-the-end-of-the-world look. Okay?

272
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,023
GIRL 1: Hey, Peyton.
GIRL 2: Hey, Peyton!

273
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,941
- What's up?
- Off to acting class.

274
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,402
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT)
"Maggie, the cat is alive. I'm alive!"

275
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,654
Singing lesson.

276
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,490
(VOCALIZING IN HIGH VOICE)

277
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,369
Cool, guys. Okay.
Hey, this is Sharpay and Boi.

278
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,331
Hi, Sharpay. Hi, Boi!

279
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,916
Anyways, gotta go. See ya, Peyton.

280
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,501
GIRL 2: Nice meeting you, Sharpay.
PEYTON: Later, guys.

281
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:25,131
Okay. Really, you're going to love
this place. Okay? Up you go.

282
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,347
Sorry. It's a pre-war building.

283
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,725
And during the war,
they didn't fight for an elevator?

284
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,227
Listen, the building has two things
going for it.

285
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,314
It's got something available,
and I live here.

286
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,650
(SCOFFS)

287
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:52,325
(SIGHING) Fine. But if I break a heel,
or a sweat, you're responsible.

288
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,868
Get my bags.

289
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,708
(PANTING)

290
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,755
See? That wasn't so bad.

291
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,716
Yeah. Down the hall.

292
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,260
The one with the police tape
and chalk outline.

293
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,804
Really?

294
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,180
Kidding.

295
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,117
- You said this was a studio.
- It is.

296
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:38,037
No way! MGM was a studio! This?

297
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,456
This is a roach motel
with no room service.

298
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,666
Yeah, a studio apartment.

299
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,210
Sure, from certain angles,
it's a bit small.

300
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,379
A two-karat engagement ring
is a bit small!

301
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,756
This is a doll house!

302
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,134
- So what do you think?
- Forget it!

303
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,137
I'd need an entirely separate apartment
just for my lipsticks.

304
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,180
And where am I supposed to sleep?

305
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,400
- What is that?
- It's your bed.

306
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,403
That is not a bed.
It's a closet with a tongue.

307
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,071
You can't be serious!

308
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,658
- There is one really good thing about it.
- Yeah, sure.

309
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,877
See? This is my place!
Looking better, huh?

310
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,172
Am I missing something? Oh, right.

311
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,883
Space! Luxury! Maid service!

312
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,260
Let me guess.
You're used to being spoiled.

313
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,180
I'm not used to it. I just expect it.

314
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,640
You know, half this building
is filled with performers

315
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,351
who came here
with the same ambitions you did.

316
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,978
What makes you
so much better than them?

317
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,483
Money, breeding, talent, great hair,
perfect jaw line, chic taste.

318
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,901
How much time do you have?

319
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,111
All right, fine.

320
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,780
I tried to help you out
like my mom asked,

321
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,531
but whatever.
I'll find someone else to film.

322
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,202
The only problem is if I call my father

323
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,579
and tell him how I messed up
on the other apartment

324
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,208
and how I have nowhere to go but here,
and I ask for his help,

325
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,793
he'll make me come home and...

326
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,294
(STAMMERING)

327
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,629
Work!

328
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,507
- So?
- So? Then I'll never get my big break.

329
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,176
Oh, and promise you won't call
your mother and tell her about this,

330
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,345
because then she'll call my mom
who will tell my dad,

331
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,764
and I don't think he really believes
I can make this happen.

332
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,182
He only gave me one month to prove it.

333
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,392
Well, then you've got one month
to prove him wrong.

334
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,852
(GROANS)

335
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,854
Why did I do this?

336
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,316
I want my canopy bed
and my housekeeper.

337
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,652
And a shower that doesn't share a room
with a kitchen.

338
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,406
- Come on.
- Where to?

339
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,201
- Do you trust me?
- You suggested this place.

340
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,285
Yeah. Point taken. Come anyway.
Come on.

341
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,250
SHARPAY: I hope you're taking me
to a better apartment

342
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,376
than what you just showed me.

343
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,255
Because let me tell you, if that's it?
No way! Absolutely no!

344
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,674
Just come on.
Just don't ask any questions.

345
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,385
I need luxury! Are you kidding me?

346
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,180
That was like a green, dark hole
that I never wanna be in ever again.

347
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,849
All right, here you go.

348
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,684
Butchy!

349
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,479
- Come on...
- Where are you taking me?

350
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,107
- You'll see. Come on.
- Why are we here?

351
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,276
All right, all right. Now, you're gonna
have to close your eyes.

352
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,944
- Close my eyes?
- Yeah, just close your eyes.

353
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,238
- Why?
- Because! Just do it.

354
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,282
All right, now. Keep them closed.

355
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,827
- Well, what if I hit into something?
- You won't. I got you.

356
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:27,081
All right, all right. Keep them closed.
All right.

- All right, you got them closed?
- Yes, I do.

358
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,711
All right, all right. Perfect. All right.
Now, stay here, keep them closed.

All right. Open them. Hit it, Butchy!

362
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,564
Wow.

363
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,407
I know.

364
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:06,329
When I left Indiana to go to school here,
I didn't know a soul either,

365
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,998
and I was just as overwhelmed as you.

366
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,084
But I had two things,
my dream and my camera.

367
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,754
And look at me now.

368
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,507
You still only have your dream
and your camera.

369
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:22,428
Yes, but I met you, didn't I?
So, something's working out.

370
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,514
Well, whenever people meet me,
things get better.

(LAUGHS)

372
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:31,270
Look, you just have to adapt
to your surroundings.

373
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,899
And remember that for now
this is all just temporary.

374
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,987
Right. Like prom dresses
and first boyfriends.

375
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:46,494
Look, anything you have to do
will be worth it to get your dream.

376
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,248
Okay.

377
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,376
I'm gonna meet with
that casting director, get the part,

378
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,420
- be a star and have a palace!
- There you go.

That's the self-indulgent, self-entitled,
optimistic pink hurricane

And I like how perceptive you are.

382
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,973
Okay, New York. Bring it on.

That you came to a very special city

00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,584
which you are.

Oh, I'm not so special.
I'm just like everyone else.

Maybe a little better.

you can't give up. Okay?

And, anyway,
you're officially the star of my film.

- How are we gonna decide?
- Wait.

632
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,114
How about we work with both dogs
during rehearsals?

633
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:03,201
Wait! How about we work with
both dogs during rehearsals!

634
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,705
That way I could see
which one I work best with.

635
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,666
- That sounds like a solution.
- We have a solution, people!

636
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,256
Can I just say
how totally great I think you are?

637
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,175
You do,
and I'll never wash my ears again.

638
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,843
You know what I think?
Well, of course you don't

639
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,220
because I just thought of it,
but I think they loved you!

640
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,471
I like the way you think!

641
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,599
And you're such a good singer.
And I would know.

642
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,143
- My album went triple platinum.
- Well, I've done quite a bit of theater.

643
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,811
It totally shows.

644
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,564
Listen, I'm gonna have my assistant
give you my phone number.

645
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,025
If there's anything that you need,
you just let me know, okay?

646
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,736
We girls gotta stick together, right?

647
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,946
- Here.
- Wow.

648
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,990
I mean, this is actually your number!

649
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,618
It looks like any ordinary number,
but it's not. It's yours!

650
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:48,580
- Oh, and, hey, may the best dog win!
- Thanks!

651
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,250
(SQUEALING SOFTLY)

652
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,169
Yes! Yes! Yes!

653
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,339
Can you believe it?

654
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,883
PEYTON: You were great!
Boi was great.

655
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,968
This new strategy just might work.

656
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,347
- Amber Lee really likes you, too.
- Is she awesome or what?

657
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,974
She inspires me. There. I said it.

658
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,061
Quelle inspired.
We are so gonna get that part.

659
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,813
- How do you know?
- Easy. I don't do rejection.

660
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,567
Sharpay!
I just wanted to wish you both luck.

661
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,236
Oh! That's so nice of you.

662
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,197
And suggest that you give up now,
while you still have your dignity.

663
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:25,075
Distant though it already might be.

664
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,160
Sorry, which Smurf are you again?

665
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,037
True, you have talent.

666
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,539
But you lack both the experience
and the finesse

667
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,125
to ever achieve
the Holy Grail of possibility.

668
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,420
- Yeah, but Boi is cuter.
- Countess is a theatrical ninja.

669
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,880
(SNORING)

670
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,883
I'm sorry. For a minute there
you just bored me to death.

671
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,136
I have a foolproof strategy
of getting what I want.

672
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,265
See it, want it, have a fit, get it.

673
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,810
- Yeah, well, this playdate's over.
- I hope you enjoy rejection.

674
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,229
- We're gonna get that part.
- We're gonna destroy you.

675
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,064
- Bring it on.
- Oh, it's brought.

676
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,167
All right, Boi. This foot. That foot.

677
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,546
Good boy! Yeah!

678
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,882
Okay, let's try our next one. Stay.

679
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,177
Catch your tail. Catch your tail!

680
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,931
Good! Yeah, good.

681
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,850
Sit. Stay.

682
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,102
We are so going to take them on.

683
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,105
I'm not gonna let some hobbit
get in my way.

684
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,442
And, look.

685
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,695
All Boi can do is think about how
horrible that other little mangy dog was.

686
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,532
(WHIMPERING)

687
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,790
If you want success so badly,
then you will get it.

688
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,334
All you need is one shot
to make it happen.

689
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,794
Yeah, and this is my shot.

690
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:03,006
It's like my grandmother says.
"God only got one book published,

691
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,215
"and look how well it did for him."

692
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,054
Doing this is
all I've ever dreamed about,

693
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,181
especially since
I already have everything else.

694
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,683
Well, there's still humility.

695
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,560
What's wrong with being confident?

696
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,604
Confidence is
when you know you're good.

697
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,148
Arrogance is when you think
others know you're good.

698
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:23,068
Well, I want everyone to know I'm as
good as I think everyone thinks I am

699
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,569
without them knowing
I know they think it.

700
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:31,076
- And do you have to film everything?
- Yep, 'cause this is my shot.

701
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,162
If my professor loves my film,
he talks about it.

702
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,748
Then there's a buzz,
then it gets in a festival,

703
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,334
then it gets distribution,
then I'm signing a studio deal,

704
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,418
then I'm getting an Oscar.

705
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:41,920
(SIGHS)

706
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,546
I always knew I wanted to be an actress

707
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,758
the first time I produced and performed
the entire production of Snow white.

708
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,719
Full dance, musical numbers,
handmade costumes.

709
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,514
I made my brother play all the dwarfs.

710
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,307
Everyone in that pre-school
worshipped me.

711
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,433
(LAUGHS)

712
00:39:56,852 --> 00:40:00,063
I just want to wake up every morning
and be onstage.

713
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,942
GILL: Good morning!
Good morning, everyone.

714
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:07,529
- And welcome to the first rehearsal...
- Of the new Broadway musical.

715
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,197
A Girl's Best Friend!

716
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,537
And you are all amazing.

717
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,455
- No, you are!
- Him or me?

718
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,915
- You!
- No, you!

719
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,125
Me? Okay!

720
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,377
And heading our superb cast,

721
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,922
we are thrilled to welcome
one of the biggest stars around,

722
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,715
Amber Lee Adams!

723
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,801
Oh, stop!

724
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,803
NEAL: Yes!
AMBER LEE: Guys, come on.

725
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:35,723
Can I just say that this,

726
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:39,727
this is the opportunity of a lifetime
for me.

727
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:43,898
Broadway's not like film or television,

728
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:48,319
because with Broadway, people can see
if you write your lines on your hands!

729
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,238
(ALL LAUGHING)

730
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,657
All right. Let's rehearse.

731
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,534
I want everybody downstairs with piano,

732
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,744
rehearsing the music
for the opening number.

733
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,954
Amber Lee and Judith,

734
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,206
I want you onstage
so we can block that first scene.

735
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,666
- Let's go!
- Let's go, people!

736
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,168
All right. Let's start with Boi.

737
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,170
Let's go!

738
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,122
AMBER LEE:
What a perfect goodbye party.

739
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,499
Thank you, Mom!

740
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,375
JUDITH: I can't believe my little girl

741
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,793
is going out into the world on her own

742
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,170
for the first time.

743
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:51,758
I have to, Mom. And who knows,
maybe I'll find fame and fortune!

744
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,426
Actually, reverse that.

745
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,512
(LAUGHING)

746
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,806
- Why is that funny?
- Well...

747
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,308
Because you'd rather have the...

748
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,729
I'll explain later. Just keep going.

749
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:09,275
There's only one thing
that breaks my heart.

750
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,528
Leaving Shelby behind.

751
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:16,074
Pick it up! Go, go!
A star is about to be born!

752
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,952
Shelby!

753
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,161
Oh!

754
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,498
What's in this envelope?
This very wet envelope.

755
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,500
(LAUGHING)

756
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,503
- Again, I don't get that.
- Keep going.

757
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,047
Gasp!

758
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:34,467
Actually, that's a stage direction.

759
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,010
You gasp, you don't say "gasp."

760
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,263
GILL: Simple mistake. Keep going.

761
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,181
(GASPS)

762
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,684
Shelby! Trying to run away
with my boarding pass

763
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:45,979
won't change the fact
that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.

764
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,106
6:00 a.m.

765
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,316

766
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,945
(BARKS)

767
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,282
Oh, Shelby.
This is the first time we'll be apart.

768
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,159
I wish I could just pack you up
in a widdle doggie bag.

769
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,369
(CHUCKLING)

770
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:05,707
Okay. Let's get Countess in there
and continue.

771
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,292
Don't worry, sweetheart.

772
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,919
Shelby and I will both be here
when you get back.

773
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,843
You're killing me.

774
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,597
AMBER LEE: Oh!

775
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,432
NEAL: That is adorable!

776
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,852
AMBER LEE: You're right, Shelby!
Why not go with me?

777
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,938
Any place that doesn't want you,
I don't wanna be.

778
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,026
Let's see what New York
has in store for us together!

779
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,279
Good.

780
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,366
Let's talk about the scene a bit,
and we'll do it again.

781
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,577
And both dogs, great work!

782
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,652
Shelby! Trying to run away
with my boarding pass

783
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,946
won't change the fact
that I'm leaving at 8:00 a.m.

6:00 a.m.

00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,209
What's going on? The dog.
What is this?

786

from across town,

just one second to get these stitches.

I just saw your assistant leave in tears.

894

She's not my assistant. She quit.

895
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,655
No wonder she was crying.

896
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,283
Yeah, I don't think
she even really cared.

897
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,578
Next time I should probably
just hire a best friend instead.

898
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,623
Wait!

899
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,834
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

900
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,419
What are you thinking
that I should be thinking?

901
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,504
I could help you out
until you replace her.

902
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,590
That is what I was thinking
about thinking.

903
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,842
Of course this can't, in any way,
affect your decision

How about dinner?

908
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,023
- That sounds awesome!
- Right?

909
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:12,526
Get me a reservation for two
at someplace fantastic.

910
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,779
Then call my agent, have her meet me.

911
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,698
Right. Sure.

912
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:24,747
Oh. I won't forget this. And I promise,

913
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,540
it won't be because you're helping me

914
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:30,127
if I happen to take a little extra liking
to Girl.

915
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,214
- Boi.
- You changed it.

916
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,216
I like that even better.

917
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,259
Oh, and can you take my mic down
to the sound guy

918
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,554
- and tell him the wire hurts my scalp.
- Okay.

919
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,473
You're the best.

920
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,187
Amber Lee says
the wire is hurting her scalp.

921
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,939
Personally,
I think she's using the wrong shampoo,

922
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,899
but she's the star, and you know,
I don't wanna say anything.

923
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,067
You're hot.

924
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,486
Excuse me?

925
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,363
You're hot.

926
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,784
Okay. Even though theater lighting
highlights my natural skin tones,

927
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,411
thank you for noticing,
that's a little rude, don't you think?

928
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,372
No. Your mic's hot.

929
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,083
It means it's on.

930
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,710
You see that little switch.
When it's flipped over like that,

931
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,714
it means it's on
and it's going through the entire theater.

932
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,009
Well, you could have led
with that part, thank you.

933
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,928
Amber Lee's got a great scalp!

934
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,602
(LAUGHS) You're hot.

935
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:31,522
Then she asked me to help her out
after her assistant quit.

936
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,649
And after I suggested it.

937
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,151
Are you sure this is wise?

938
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,320
I'm sorry. Let me re-phrase that.
This isn't wise.

939
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:42,199
It's perfect. Amber Lee will see
that she and I are exactly alike,

940

to help me finish my film.

It's not that complicated.

1098
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:05,363
Amber Lee is using you,
and you're letting her.

1099
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,782
You don't know
what you're talking about.

- I don't?
- No!

1101
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:11,244
Where's the Sharpay that was
determined not to go back home

1102
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:12,996
because she didn't want to work
for anyone?

1103
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,664
Why don't you tell me?

1104
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,249
Working for someone, that's where.

1105
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:19,252
- So at least be honest as to why.
- I know what I'm doing.

1106
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,505
You've sold your soul
to get Boi in that show,

1107
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,632
rather than trust in the dog
that you raised.

1108
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,759
Even worse, you've stopped trusting
that your own talents

would get you where you need to go.

on my way up with a new famous friend,

1111
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:34,142
and you're just a student making a film
about someone else's life

1112
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,685

whirlwind of confidence and ambition

1118

that first day you got here?

1119

I mean, that girl knew she was special.

That girl knew she didn't have to do
any of this to succeed.

01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:41,064
See, this is exactly why I didn't want to
do a show with dogs!

1248
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:45,234
I'm the star, not them! Stage people?

1249
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:49,906
Could somebody please put these rats
with rabies out of my misery? Anyone!

1250
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:51,866
Finally, you idiot! What took so long?

1251
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:54,327
Now, hurry up and get these flea-bitten
fur bags out of here!

1252
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:57,330
- There are people waiting to see me!
- Okay, go now.

1253
01:12:57,414 --> 01:13:00,208
You think all those boring freaks
with no lives

1254
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:02,001
came to worship two no-name mutts?

1255
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:07,465
I don't think so! I'm the one they love!
Me! They came to see...

1256
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,307
(ALL BOOING)

1257
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:25,233
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1258
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:27,193
I knew I forgot to tell you something.

1259
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,445
Careful, your mic's on.

1260
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:34,200
You did this to me. You ruined me!

1261
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:36,160
News flash! You ruined you!

1262
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,079
Oh, what do you know?
You're a nobody!

1263
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:41,582
The only reason you even wanted to be
my friend is so I'd choose your dog!

1264
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:45,086
No, no. At first, I idolized you,

1265
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,255
even more than myself,
which isn't easy.

1266
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:49,257
But you're not at all
what I thought you were.

1267
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:50,383
(SCOFFS)

1268
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:55,096
You and I are exactly alike.

1269
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,432
Except I don't enjoy
letting people down.

1270
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,600
I don't use people to feel better
about myself.

1271
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,395
And I definitely don't wear yellow
and orange in the same week,

1272
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,397
let alone the same outfit, okay?

1273
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:08,818
Maybe I did think you and I were alike,
but not anymore.

1274
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:13,948
In fact, I'd be embarrassed
if someone thought I was like you.

1275
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,037
Well, I quit!

1276
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,250
And without me, there's no show.

1277
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:25,960
Now neither one
of your furry little friends

1278
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:28,796
will have their shot and neither will you.

1279
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,841
Blame her!

1280
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,310
I'm sorry. Someone had to say it.

1281
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:45,688
I'll go talk some sense into her.

1282
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:51,486
You, out of this theater right now.

1283
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:01,954
Wait, Sharpay.
If you go, then I'll go, too.

1284
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:07,251
No. You wanted this as badly as I did.
This mess was my idea.

1285
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:09,504
You win.

1286
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,216
That's not what it feels like.

1287
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:25,186
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

1288
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,691
- Hey. Can I come in?
- Sure.

1289
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:38,282
- So, you're really leaving, huh?
- Yeah.

1290
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,701
I'm packing my carry-on stuff first.

1291
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:46,666
- I wish you weren't going.
- Me, too.

1292
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,548
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do now?

1293
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:56,842
Move home where there's enough room
for my pores to open,

1294
01:15:56,927 --> 01:16:00,846
spend months in the spa getting
this layer of New York grime off my skin,

1295
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:02,098
and mostly...

1296
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,850
...miss you.

1297
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:08,854
Look, I know exactly how to help that.
Don't go.

1298
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:12,191
I already talked to my dad.

1299
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:15,528
I guess I'm gonna start...
(STAMMERING)

1300
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:18,739
- You don't have to say it.
- Thank you.

1301
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,578
What about your dream of being a star?

1302
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,580
It's still there.

1303
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,583
It's just a little bit more of a dream
than a reality.

1304
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,921
- You know what today is?
- What?

1305
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:39,427
I got here exactly one month ago.
My time was up tonight anyway.

1306
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,973
Well, so then you still have eight hours.

1307
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,815
This isn't how
my movie's supposed to end.

1308
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,152
I guess it is.

1309
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:58,321
(PHONE RINGING)

1310
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,075
This is Sharpay.

1311
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:04,910
Uh-huh.

1312
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,246
Sure. No, no. I'll be there.

1313
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:09,790
(SIGHS)

1314
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,459
That was the stage manager.

1315
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:14,545
They want me to come to the theater
and clear out Boi's things.

1316
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,839
I can go with you if you want.

1317
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:19,634
I want.

1318
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:24,764
GILL: And, so, Amber Lee has quit.

1319
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:26,307
- Gone.
- Kaput.

1320
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:30,686
NEAL: The producers feel,
without a star, we can't open.

1321
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:34,148
The time it would take to find someone
who could learn the role and do it well

1322
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:38,361
might take weeks, and it would cost
too much to keep the production going.

1323
01:17:38,862 --> 01:17:43,699
But we want you all to know,
it was great almost working with you.

1324
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:55,211
- I'm gonna meet you outside.
- All right.

1325
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:06,764
GILL: Thank you for your hard work.

1326
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:09,517
We are so, so sorry, people.

1327
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,735
Wait! Wait, it's not over. It's not over.

1328
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:22,446
Look, it doesn't have to be.

1329
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,741
Look, there is someone who knows
the part by heart and who is amazing.

1330
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:29,120
All right, maybe she's not a star yet,
but she will be.

1331
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:32,123
This show will make her one.
Just watch.

1332
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:40,172
SHARPAY: Boi, keep your voice down.
Peyton, start shooting the rehearsal.

1333
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:43,968
Boi, go mark. Go mark. Good!

1334
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,512
Okay, stay. Stay.

1335
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:50,683
I love when you use that accent, but...
(SHUSHING)

1336
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:52,143
We're not supposed to be in here.

1337
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:54,228
Okay, now let's do the scene
where the character Lenore

1338
01:18:54,312 --> 01:18:55,396
thinks she's lost everything

1339
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,357
and you come over to console her.
Come on.

1340
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:03,279
Shelby, what is going on?
I feel invisible here.

1341
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:06,282
Nothing is working out the way
I planned it.

1342
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:11,036
(SINGING) I got something inside ofme

1343
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:14,665
Something that needs to be heard

1344
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:20,796
Deep down a voice is guiding me

1345
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:25,468
Hidden emotions have stirred

1346
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:33,225
Why have I let others lead the way

1347
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:39,607
When all along I know what it is
I want to say

1348
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:43,903
Whatever it is
I'll do it

1349
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:47,031
I'm the answer to your prayers

1350
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:49,950
Whatever you want
Stop looking

1351
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:53,037
Nobody else compares

1352
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,915
Whatever you've seen before

1353
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:59,418
I'll give you so much more

1354
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:01,962
You'll be totally impressed

1355
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,716
I'm New York's best kept secret

1356
01:20:18,855 --> 01:20:22,399
I thought I had a perfect plan

1357
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:26,278
Where I would wind up on top

1358
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:35,204
One day I'm thinking, "Yes I can"

1359
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:38,290
Next thing you know, I'm a flop

1360
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:46,465
Why did I ever play this silly game?

1361
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:50,511
I got to shake up the rules

1362
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:52,972
And stake my claim

1363
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:55,850
Whatever it is
I'll do it

1364
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:59,144
I'm the answer to your prayers

1365
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:01,897
Whatever you want
Stop looking

1366
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:05,067
Nobody else compares

1367
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:08,153
Whatever you've seen before

1368
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:11,156
I'll give you so much more

1369
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:14,159
You'll be totally impressed

1370
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:17,162
I'm New York's best kept secret

1371
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,915
What if I missed my window?

1372
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,877
What if I blew my shot?

1373
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:26,630
What if the only chance
I was going to get

1374
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:28,799
I already got?

1375
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,969
I'm not ready to turn the page

1376
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:35,097
Until I'm on stage in a show

1377
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:39,059
No, nobody move
I've got something to prove

1378
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:44,023
Don't you know?

1379
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:47,192
Whatever it is
I'll do it

1380
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:49,945
I'm the answer to your prayers

1381
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,907

01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:55,868
Nobody else compares

Whatever you've seen before

1384
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:05,753
I'll give you so much more

1385
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:10,883
You'll be totally impressed

1386
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:16,430
I'm New York's best kept secret

1387

(HUMMING)

1388
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:40,204
PEYTON: Well, did I tell you?

1389
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:42,122
(LAUGHING)

1390
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,918
- Amazing!
- Amazing! You're amahzing!

1391
01:22:46,002 --> 01:22:48,420
You have more depth, range and tone
in one note

1392
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:51,006
than Amber Lee had in her
entire surgically reshaped body.

1393
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:53,217
We'll promote you as
"The girl who we're promoting."

1394
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:54,385
The producers will love it.

1395
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:56,095
Wait, wait. What are you saying?

1396
01:22:56,179 --> 01:22:58,430
We need you to save the show.

1397
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:02,768
- Seriously?
- We know it's a risk.

1398
01:23:02,852 --> 01:23:05,104
- A gamble.
- A risk. Did I do "risk" already?

1399
01:23:05,188 --> 01:23:07,314
You did. And, true, we did fire you.

1400
