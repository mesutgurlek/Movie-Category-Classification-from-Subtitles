What if some freckles may vex you

464
00:39:15,414 --> 00:39:19,407
Just spend some shekels
and freckles will

465
00:39:19,485 --> 00:39:21,453
Never perplex you

466

What if some freckles may vex you

469
00:39:58,691 --> 00:40:01,125
Just spend some shekels

470
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:07,291
And freckles will never perplex you

Girl

476
00:40:33,893 --> 00:40:36,361
Mademoiselle,
permit me to tell you...

477
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:39,921
how much I am enchanted that
you're coming to Paris under my management.

478
00:40:39,999 --> 00:40:43,332
- Thank you.
- Here are the contracts and the tickets.

479
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,996
You have the best suite
on the <i>Mauretania.</i>

480
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:49,006
Oh, thank you, Monsieur Philippe.
We're almost all packed.

481
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:52,771
Good night, Monsieur Philippe,
and thank you for liking us so much.

482
00:40:52,845 --> 00:40:55,780
Mademoiselle.

483
00:40:55,848 --> 00:40:58,282
- Au revoir. [Speaking French]
- Thank you.

484
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:02,514
And now, monsieur, how would you like
a little snack with me?

485
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:04,886
- What?
- A little snack.

486
00:41:04,957 --> 00:41:10,020
Snack? I- I don't know,
but if you show me just once, I can play it.

487
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:14,031
- I mean something to eat.
- To eat? I am not a bit hungry.

488
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:18,559
But maybe a little steak with some
potatoes and- and a bite of pudding, please.

489
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:22,937
A suite on the <i>Mauretania.</i>
That isn't the way we came over.

490
00:41:23,008 --> 00:41:25,101
I'll say it isn't.

491
00:41:28,981 --> 00:41:31,643
Is Harry still
on the road?

492
00:41:31,717 --> 00:41:35,050
I don't know.
I just can't understand him.

493
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,556
He used to write me every day
no matter where he was playing.

494
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:42,890
I guess he's met someone else
and hasn't the nerve to tell me.

495
00:41:42,962 --> 00:41:47,296
Could be. Well, I'm gonna go
tell Flo about Paris.

496
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:53,230
Oh, don't forget we have a date with her tonight
at Ronnie Warburton's.

497
00:42:09,054 --> 00:42:12,023
- Jenny.
- Harry!

498
00:42:12,091 --> 00:42:14,082
Oh!

499
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:16,389
- It's really you.
- Uh-huh.

500
00:42:20,266 --> 00:42:23,292
- Oh!
- Darling, darling.

501
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:25,667
Here, let me look at you.

502
00:42:25,738 --> 00:42:30,004
Yep. You're exactly like
I dream about you.

503
00:42:30,075 --> 00:42:34,171
- Do you know you always smile
with your eyes first?
- Do I?

504
00:42:34,246 --> 00:42:36,806
- Yes.
- Oh, darling.

505
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:40,442
Oh.

506
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,114
Oh, Harry, why didn't you
let me know you were coming?

507
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:46,350
Well, I couldn't.

508
00:42:46,425 --> 00:42:50,521
I just happened to be in town, and I got
a sudden impulse to drop by and say hello.

509
00:42:50,596 --> 00:42:53,087
You know me-
Always obey that impulse.

510
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,292
Oh.

511
00:42:56,368 --> 00:43:00,361
Well, Rosie and I have obeyed one too.
We're sailing day after tomorrow.

512
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:02,999
We've signed with Philippe
for a show in Paris.

513
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,608
Paris? Well, gee,
that-that's great.

514
00:43:10,749 --> 00:43:12,876
You're really glad.

515
00:43:12,952 --> 00:43:14,977
Well-Well, of course.

516
00:43:15,054 --> 00:43:18,023
It's- It's what you want,
isn't it?

517
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,081
Of course.

518
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:22,320
That's what you want too,
isn't it?

519
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:26,990
Or maybe Paris isn't far enough.
Maybe you'd like it if I went to China.

520
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:32,936
- Oh, Harry, be honest with me.
What's happened to us?
- Nothing.

521
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:37,908
- Is- Is there someone else?
- You know it isn't that.

522
00:43:37,977 --> 00:43:42,175
Well, then it must be something.
It- It can't just be the separation.

523
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:44,306
Then what?

524
00:43:46,085 --> 00:43:50,579
Oh, Harry, it isn't because
I landed on top first, is it?

525
00:43:50,656 --> 00:43:53,921
Oh, you fool.
You darling fool.

526
00:43:53,993 --> 00:43:56,086
How can that
make any difference?

527
00:43:56,161 --> 00:44:00,598
But it does, Jenny.
And it's not just a matter of pride.

528
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:04,124
But you love me, don't you?
And I love you.

529
00:44:04,203 --> 00:44:06,467
That's all that counts.
Everything else is nonsense.

530
00:44:06,538 --> 00:44:08,597
No, it isn't nonsense,
Jenny.

531
00:44:08,674 --> 00:44:11,905
I've seen other people try it,
dozens of them.

532
00:44:11,977 --> 00:44:14,605
Oh, it's not just
the money or the fame.

533
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,208
It's a lot of other little things
all added up. It just won't work.

534
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:22,276
Oh, it's all right as long as the stardust
is still there...

535
00:44:22,354 --> 00:44:27,519
but then the stardust blows away
and a kind of poison sets in.

536
00:44:29,161 --> 00:44:33,120
In- In other words, you-
you don't want to marry me.

537
00:44:33,198 --> 00:44:35,962
- More than anything else in the world.
- Oh.

538
00:44:36,035 --> 00:44:39,129
But I can't.
Not till I get someplace.

539
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:43,337
Not even if I ditch
the Paris engagement?

540
00:44:44,871 --> 00:44:47,135
I can't let you
do that, Jenny.

541
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:50,803
Oh, I see.

542
00:44:50,877 --> 00:44:53,937
Well, there's no use
dragging things out, is there?

543
00:44:54,014 --> 00:44:57,848
I mean, we-we might as well
make a clean break and say good-bye.

544
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,245
Yeah, I guess so.

545
00:45:02,322 --> 00:45:06,156
- Good-bye then.
- Good-bye, Jenny.

546
00:45:06,226 --> 00:45:11,755
Uh, no more letters.
Not that you've been writing much lately.

547
00:45:11,832 --> 00:45:14,027
No. No more letters.

548
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:17,093
But- But we'll
always be friends?

549
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,229
Sure, sure.

550
00:45:20,841 --> 00:45:23,105
Good-bye, Jenny.

551
00:45:24,745 --> 00:45:26,838
Good-bye.

552
00:45:29,549 --> 00:45:31,414
Good-bye.

553
00:45:36,123 --> 00:45:38,250
Buy you a cup of coffee?

554
00:45:39,626 --> 00:45:42,925
It's no use, Harry.
Just go, will you?

555
00:45:58,812 --> 00:46:03,272
That Daly woman. She had to dope out
tomorrow's horses at New Orleans.

556
00:46:08,622 --> 00:46:11,989
- Come on. We're late.
- All right.

557
00:46:13,827 --> 00:46:16,694
- I can't. I'm going home.
- But you promised.

558
00:46:16,763 --> 00:46:18,822
That's what I said.

559
00:46:33,613 --> 00:46:35,672

560
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,033

Oh, thank you. Oh!

563
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:14,614
- Oh, I was looking for a taxi.
- So I see.

564
00:47:14,688 --> 00:47:17,987
I'll get you one, but it'll take time.
You better take me up on that coffee first.

565
00:47:18,058 --> 00:47:20,754
- No, thanks very much, but I-
- Now see here. You're drenched.

566
00:47:20,827 --> 00:47:23,057
Do you want to get
to Paris with pneumonia?

567
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:26,656
- Well, I guess not.
- All right, then. Come on.

568
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:34,730
Here you are, Miss Dolly.
That will warm you up.

Uh, what are you doing
about your songs?

580
00:48:25,592 --> 00:48:29,358
Oh, nothing much.
Except "Rainbows." Remember it?

581
00:48:29,429 --> 00:48:32,023
Oh, yes. I liked it.

00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:50,046
Darling, nobody can turn down
an offer like that.

614
00:52:50,123 --> 00:52:52,614
Nobody, darling?

615
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:10,864
[Doorbell Rings]

616
00:53:14,545 --> 00:53:18,106
<i>Excuse me, Mrs. Fox, for buttin' in like this.</i>
<i>I'm Morrie Keno- Keno and Kraus.</i>

617
00:53:18,182 --> 00:53:20,810
- Hello.
- We played on the bill with you
and Rosie in Atlanta once.

618
00:53:20,884 --> 00:53:23,682
You wouldn't remember our act.
[Chuckling] We were on too early.

619
00:53:23,754 --> 00:53:27,246
Anyway, when war was declared, my partner
enlisted right away. Me, I couldn't make it myself.

620
00:53:27,324 --> 00:53:29,417
I'm putting on shows here
to sell Liberty bonds.

621
00:53:29,493 --> 00:53:32,758
There's one tonight at the hotel.
I'd like to have you and your sister go on for us.

622
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:35,161
People love you, and you'll
sell bonds like wildfire.

623
00:53:35,232 --> 00:53:38,326
Try and bring Mr. Fox along, but I know
he's singin' at recruiting rallies all the time.

624
00:53:38,402 --> 00:53:41,394
Sure made a big hit at the Palace.
Had it comin' to him. Swell fella.

625
00:53:41,471 --> 00:53:43,996
Thanks for comin' tonight.
I'll announce you myself.

626
00:53:44,074 --> 00:53:46,133
- That's about all I can do to help.
- Why-

627
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,337
My partner enlisted right away.
I couldn't make it.

628
00:53:48,412 --> 00:53:51,176
Nice hearing your voice again,
Mrs. Fox. See ya tonight. Ahem.

629
00:53:51,248 --> 00:53:54,581
- Thanks a million.
- We'll be there, and thanks,
Mr. Keno, for dropping in.

630
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:57,518
It's all right.

631
00:53:57,588 --> 00:53:59,419
Whew!

632
00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:06,158
- Kathi, do you think it's ready yet?
- Just about.

633
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:08,755
Oh! Here, let me
take it out myself.

634
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:13,496
- Ooh!
- Better you should use these, Miss Jenny.

635
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:16,596
- Ah.
- <i>Jenny, don't tell me you did that all by yourself?</i>

636
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:19,836
Mm-hmm. Well, Kathi
helped me a little bit.

637
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:22,572
<i>[Latsie]</i>
<i>Jenny, we have news for you.</i>

638
00:54:22,646 --> 00:54:26,514
Where's Harry? I thought you were
picking him up at the Friars.
