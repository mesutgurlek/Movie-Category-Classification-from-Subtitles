I'm sorry,

I don't know.

I avoided the spell by
disappearing, but you...

gotten ourselves into?

There were two...
No, no, 20 men. Uh... Soldiers.

Lashing swords
everywhere.

686

I finished off
scores of them.

Yes, I do.

Something almost
magical about them.

Wait! The sign
shows a bridge.

out long ago.

so much faster.

We're doing fine.

carry on, Ian?

00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:16,360
What do you
think, Melody?

823
00:43:16,434 --> 00:43:20,427
You know, the Muses sing songs
about legends and destiny.

824
00:43:20,504 --> 00:43:22,597
This really
could be yours.

825
00:43:22,673 --> 00:43:24,436
So, if
it's ours...

826
00:43:24,508 --> 00:43:26,271
Do you think we can eat something?

827
00:43:26,777 --> 00:43:28,608
Yes. Go, eat.

828
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,947
(BARKS)

829
00:43:35,653 --> 00:43:38,019
Oh, of course you get your share.

830
00:43:42,927 --> 00:43:45,919
(LAUGHS) You don't have to
do tricks for your supper.

831
00:43:45,996 --> 00:43:47,964
What's mine is yours.

832
00:43:53,537 --> 00:43:54,697
Oh!

833
00:43:54,772 --> 00:43:56,535
They're
beautiful.

834
00:43:57,341 --> 00:43:58,808
Try one on.

835
00:44:03,648 --> 00:44:05,513
I look like
a princess.

836
00:44:06,251 --> 00:44:08,879
Oh, Liana,
it's a perfect home for us.

837
00:44:08,954 --> 00:44:10,819
More food than we could ever eat,

838
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:13,357
a beautiful
dress every day

839
00:44:13,425 --> 00:44:15,552
and a gorgeous
garden.

840
00:44:15,627 --> 00:44:17,652
But we can't stay.

841
00:44:17,729 --> 00:44:19,663
Why not?
It's ours.

842
00:44:19,731 --> 00:44:21,426
We're finally having
some good luck,

843
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,195
why can't
we enjoy it?

844
00:44:23,268 --> 00:44:26,999
Maybe we can come back after we
take Melody to the Diamond Castle.

845
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:28,539
If we come back.

846
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,034
What do you mean?

847
00:44:30,108 --> 00:44:32,633
Trolls, serpents,
evil magic.

848
00:44:33,178 --> 00:44:34,702
We may not live
to come back.

849
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,873
We promised Melody
we'd help her.

850
00:44:36,948 --> 00:44:39,940
And we did.
We've taken her this far.

851
00:44:40,018 --> 00:44:42,646
I can't go
any farther.

852
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:43,745
I can't.

853
00:44:43,822 --> 00:44:45,050
But, we promised.

854
00:44:45,123 --> 00:44:46,283
You gave your word.

855
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:48,223
Let Ian and
Jeremy do it.

856
00:44:48,293 --> 00:44:50,056
I'm staying here.

857
00:44:50,295 --> 00:44:51,762
You don't mean that.

858
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,354
Yes, I do.

859
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:56,457
Please, don't argue.
You've done enough.

860
00:44:56,968 --> 00:44:59,436
See, even
Melody thinks so.

861
00:44:59,504 --> 00:45:00,971
Stay with me.

862
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:05,534
If we don't stop Lydia,
we'll all be living under a dark cloud.

863
00:45:05,645 --> 00:45:09,081
No laughter, no music,
just sadness everywhere.

864
00:45:09,148 --> 00:45:11,309
Why us?
Why can't somebody else do it?

865
00:45:11,384 --> 00:45:13,147
Because Melody
is our friend.

866
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:15,653
You're choosing
Melody over me.

867
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,781
No, it's
not like that.

868
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:21,622
If you were really my friend,
you'd understand.

869
00:45:22,528 --> 00:45:23,859
You're right,

870
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,761
I don't understand.

871
00:45:25,832 --> 00:45:27,595
Come on,
Sparkles.

872
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:29,895
Ready, Melody?

873
00:45:29,969 --> 00:45:32,028
We are going to
the Seven Stones.

874
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,073
(WHIMPERING)

875
00:45:58,197 --> 00:45:59,687
No, Lily.

876
00:45:59,832 --> 00:46:01,629
I can't believe
she did that.

877
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:10,201
Liana?

878
00:46:15,249 --> 00:46:16,511
(LAUGHS)

879
00:46:31,198 --> 00:46:33,166
Liked the manor,
did you?

880
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:35,861
So terribly
tempting.

881
00:46:35,936 --> 00:46:37,198
How did you know?

882
00:46:37,304 --> 00:46:39,101
Because I was
there first.

883
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:41,936
Did the servants tell
you about a legend?

884
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:43,909
Yes, they said
that two...

885
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:47,006
They were under
your power.

886
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,513
Mmm-hmm.

887
00:46:48,582 --> 00:46:51,050
Now, give me
the mirror.

888
00:46:51,618 --> 00:46:53,552
I don't
have it.

889
00:46:57,491 --> 00:46:58,856
(CHUCKLES)

890
00:47:00,394 --> 00:47:01,759
(EXCLAIMS)

891
00:47:07,734 --> 00:47:09,100
You hurt her.

892
00:47:11,472 --> 00:47:13,235
No mirror,
mistress.

893
00:47:13,308 --> 00:47:15,640
So, the other
girl has it.

894
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:16,904
Where is
your friend,

895
00:47:16,978 --> 00:47:19,572
or should I say
ex-friend?

896
00:47:19,647 --> 00:47:22,241
I don't know.

897
00:47:24,686 --> 00:47:26,677
That doesn't
work on me.

898
00:47:26,754 --> 00:47:29,814
Bold words for a girl who
no longer wears her necklace.

899
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:33,850
As long as you and your friend wore
your guardian stones, you were protected.

900
00:47:33,928 --> 00:47:35,725
But now...

901
00:47:46,107 --> 00:47:47,540
Where is she?

902
00:47:47,608 --> 00:47:51,100
Going to the
Seven Stones.

903
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:53,374
Slyder, get the
girl and the mirror.

904
00:47:53,448 --> 00:47:55,473
And this time,
do it right.

905
00:47:56,217 --> 00:47:57,741
Yes, mistress.

906
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:12,963
This must be it,
right?

907
00:48:13,702 --> 00:48:15,829
MELODY: The Seven Stones!
We're here!

908
00:48:15,904 --> 00:48:18,168
We're really here.
You did it.

909
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,267
Just down there is the misty
glade and the Diamond Castle.

910
00:48:26,215 --> 00:48:27,910
I wish Alexa
were with us.

911
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:30,884
Yes, well, she
made her choice.

912
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:33,720
Liana, I know
you miss her.

913
00:48:34,256 --> 00:48:36,850
Miss her?
Why would I miss her?

914
00:48:36,925 --> 00:48:39,655
We've only been friends for
as long as I can remember.

915
00:48:39,728 --> 00:48:42,026
She's been with me through the
best and worst times of my life.

916
00:48:42,097 --> 00:48:43,086
(BARKS)

917
00:48:43,165 --> 00:48:46,760
She knows me better than anyone
else in the entire universe.

918
00:48:47,603 --> 00:48:49,935
I feel like a part
of me is gone.

919
00:48:50,272 --> 00:48:52,103
(BARKING)

920
00:48:52,174 --> 00:48:53,664
What is it?

921
00:48:56,812 --> 00:48:58,871
LIANA: (GRUNTS)
Put me down.

922
00:48:58,947 --> 00:49:01,814
SLYDER: Mistress Lydia
will be glad to see you.

923
00:49:01,884 --> 00:49:03,078
(WHOOPING)

924
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:12,316
Welcome, darling.

925
00:49:12,861 --> 00:49:14,887
I have nothing
to say to you.

926
00:49:15,031 --> 00:49:16,020
Aw!

927
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:18,465
That must be because
you're lonely.

928
00:49:18,535 --> 00:49:21,698
Alexa, won't
you join us?

929
00:49:24,307 --> 00:49:26,798
Alexa!
Alexa!

930
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:31,938
She told me where to find you.

931
00:49:32,015 --> 00:49:35,473
Friends are highly
overrated, don't you think?

932
00:49:37,854 --> 00:49:39,754
And here it is.

933
00:49:39,856 --> 00:49:43,849
Ah! So much trouble
for such a little apprentice.

934
00:49:45,128 --> 00:49:47,995
Melody, I know
you can hear me.

935
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:51,696
Melody,
come out now.

936
00:49:52,035 --> 00:49:53,900
Oh,
stubborn girl.

937
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:56,564
Walk, Alexa, walk.

938
00:50:02,479 --> 00:50:05,812
Alexa, no!
Stop, stop!

939
00:50:05,882 --> 00:50:07,042
(TUTTING)

940
00:50:07,117 --> 00:50:09,142
She only
listens to me.

941
00:50:09,552 --> 00:50:13,352
And I'll only stop her
if Melody asks me to.

942
00:50:14,557 --> 00:50:17,493
Anything to say,
Melly Belly?

943
00:50:37,214 --> 00:50:38,545
Stop her, Lydia.

944
00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:40,415
Girl, wait.

945
00:50:45,523 --> 00:50:47,957
I want the key to
the Diamond Castle.

946
00:50:48,025 --> 00:50:50,255
Let my friends go.

947
00:50:50,327 --> 00:50:51,919
Ha! The key first,

948
00:50:51,996 --> 00:50:53,554
and show me
where the castle is,

949
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:55,121
then I'll release them.

950
00:50:57,601 --> 00:50:59,228
(WHIMPERING)

951
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:01,265
Okay.

952
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:03,636
But we come right
back to let them go.

Oh, there's
a good girl.

Meet me
outside, Slyder.

No sign of them.

968

without us.

a bad feeling?

That's Alexa's

it's okay.

00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:25,079
Please let
this work.

987
00:53:25,852 --> 00:53:31,119
Best friends, today,
tomorrow and always.

988
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,468
Liana,

989
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,336
where are we?

990
00:53:52,179 --> 00:53:55,342
In trouble, but then,
what else is new?

991
00:53:56,516 --> 00:53:57,710
What happened?

992
00:53:57,784 --> 00:53:59,376
Lydia has Melody.

993
00:53:59,453 --> 00:54:00,545
No!

994
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,747
They're on their way
to the Diamond Castle.

995
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,917
We have to stop
them, but how?

996
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,451
We're going
to climb up,

997
00:54:08,528 --> 00:54:09,790
together.

998
00:54:22,075 --> 00:54:25,533
If you want me to believe
the Diamond Castle is here,

999
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:27,079
give me the key.

1000
00:54:27,147 --> 00:54:28,274
The key...

1001
00:54:28,983 --> 00:54:31,315
Now, or I throw
you in the pond

1002
00:54:31,386 --> 00:54:33,684
and your friends never
come out of the cave.

1003
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:36,418
The key...

1004
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,491
Is to place diamonds

1005
00:54:42,063 --> 00:54:43,360
in the diamond.

1006
00:54:43,431 --> 00:54:44,989
And that is...

1007
00:54:45,066 --> 00:54:46,055
The boulder.

1008
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:50,766
Ah, I see it.

1009
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,403
Now what?

1010
00:54:52,473 --> 00:54:54,634
Each slot
holds a diamond.

1011
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:56,404
Placed in
the proper order,

1012
00:54:56,477 --> 00:54:58,707
the castle will
then be revealed.

1013
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,748
Where do I begin?

1014
00:55:02,283 --> 00:55:05,252
I'm so sorry, Liana,
about everything I said.

1015
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,419
Me, too.
Me, too.

1016
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,856

1017
00:55:13,928 --> 00:55:15,190

1018
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:24,233
Lily, come back.

1019
00:55:30,678 --> 00:55:32,579
Whoa!

1020
00:55:36,985 --> 00:55:38,077
LIANA: Jeremy.

1021
00:55:38,153 --> 00:55:39,415
Liana.

1022
00:55:39,555 --> 00:55:41,921
I see you'll
follow us anywhere.

1023
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:44,891
Look at that. Again you show
up just when we need you.

1024
00:55:45,494 --> 00:55:47,689
Timing is
everything.

1025
00:55:54,102 --> 00:55:55,091
LYDIA: Here.

1026
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,262
Mmm-hmm.

1027
00:55:56,338 --> 00:55:58,636
And then to the
right, two spaces.

1028
00:55:58,707 --> 00:56:00,265
LYDIA: Ooh, the last one.

1029
00:56:00,642 --> 00:56:02,633
So horribly exciting.

1030
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:26,123
Where's
the castle?

1031
00:56:26,802 --> 00:56:29,896
You see, there are
a few more steps.

1032
00:56:33,408 --> 00:56:36,003
JEREMY: You actually think
this mad plan will work?

1033
00:56:36,212 --> 00:56:37,304
LIANA: It has to.

1034
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,781
Once Lydia finds the castle and
destroys the musical instruments,

1035
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:43,148
nobody will ever
be able to stop her.

1036
00:56:44,687 --> 00:56:46,177
What you think,
Ian?

1037
00:56:46,256 --> 00:56:49,350
Doom, disaster,
catastrophe.

1038
00:56:49,425 --> 00:56:51,359
So, we're in then?

1039
00:56:51,427 --> 00:56:52,894
Definitely.

1040
00:56:58,034 --> 00:56:59,126

You've been
playing with me.

1042
00:57:01,504 --> 00:57:02,493
I just...

1043
00:57:02,572 --> 00:57:04,199
Diamonds aren't
the key at all.

1044
00:57:04,274 --> 00:57:06,868
You think your friends
will come rescue you.

1045
00:57:06,943 --> 00:57:08,706
(LAUGHS) You fool.

1046
00:57:08,778 --> 00:57:12,680
You can't be the only
Muse, Lydia, it isn't right.

1047
00:57:12,749 --> 00:57:15,309
The Diamond Castle's
meant for everybody.

1048
00:57:15,385 --> 00:57:18,115
Great singers don't need a chorus.

1049

What?

1056
00:58:09,306 --> 00:58:10,295
So far...

1057
00:58:10,374 --> 00:58:11,534
So good.

1058
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:14,710
Oh, I knew
they'd come.

1059
00:58:14,778 --> 00:58:16,678
A waste of a trip.

1060

(GASPS)

1061
00:58:28,359 --> 00:58:29,883
Come to me.

1062
00:58:30,127 --> 00:58:32,721
No, don't
listen to her.

1063
00:58:42,073 --> 00:58:44,007
Back off,
beastie.

1064
00:58:51,983 --> 00:58:53,951
I liked
that guitar.

No! Liana,

Do you believe
in magic?

1072

or I break the mirror,

gets out, never.

LYDIA: The flute.

Don't do it.
Don't let her have it.

wants to stay in there forever.

No, but I will
to stop you.

to me.

you hear us?

all right?

but so is
Melody.

But we don't have the key
to the Diamond Castle.

my old home back.
