But think of the thrill
Of a bullfight in Seville

When the bull is uncontrolled

00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,505
We don't marry, is that it?

330
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,678
Marriage is not forbidden to us.

331
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,514
But instead of getting married at once...

332
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,643
...it sometimes happens
we get married at last.

333
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,692
Enough. We must finish lunch
and get on with your lessons.

334
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,611
Now, go on. Go on, go on!

[BONES CRUNCH]

336
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,914
Without knowledge of jewelry,
my dear Gigi...

337
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,916
...a woman is lost.

338
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,584
Do you remember Madame Dunard...

339
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,461
-...who was here the other day?
-Yes.

340
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,547
Did you notice that rope of black pearls
around her throat?

341
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,341
Yes! It was beautiful.

342
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,884
Dipped.

343
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,136
-Dipped?
-Dipped.

344
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,138
Given to her by the man she loves...

345
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,849
...whose love is obviously
beginning to cool...

346
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,851
...and the poor thing doesn't know it.

347
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,979
It's just a matter of time now.

348
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:17,984
Now, let us see what you remember.

349
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,903
What is this?

350
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,614
A marquise diamond.

351
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,450
A marquise-shaped diamond.

352
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,662
This?

353
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,455
This is...

354
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,625
...a topaz?

355
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,001
A topaz?

Among my jewels? Are you mad?

357
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,675
It's a yellow diamond
of the first quality.

358
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,220
You'll have to go a long way
to see one like it.

359
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,682
-This?
-An emerald.

360
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,183
How beautiful.

361
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,768
Do you see that blue flame...

362
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,521
...darting about in the depths
of the green light?

363
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,606
Only the most beautiful emeralds...

364
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:00,151
...contain that miracle
of elusive blue.

365
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,821
-Who gave it to you, aunt?
-A king.

366
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,031
-A great king?
-No, a little one.

367
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,450
Great kings do not give
very large stones.

368
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:08,660
Why not?

369
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,913
In my opinion, it's because
they don't feel they have to.

370
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,249
Who does give the valuable jewels?

371
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:18,044
Who? Oh, the shy, the proud...

372
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,423
...and the social climbers.
They think it's a sign of culture.

373
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,925
But it doesn't matter who gives them...

374
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:27,262
...as long as you never
wear anything second-rate.

375
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,016
Wait for the first-class jewels, Gigi.

Hold on to your ideals.

Come over here to the light, Gigi.

378

Open your mouth.

With teeth like that...

...I could have devoured
all Paris and most of Europe.

381

But I can't complain.
I had a good bite of it.

382
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,833
Tell your Grandmama
to get you some astringent lotion.

-Grandmama won't let me.
-I should hope not.

385
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,674
You have an impossible nose,
a nondescript mouth.

386
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,260
Your cheekbones are too high.

Of course you don't smoke cigars.

Everything I teach you...

Love, my dear Gigi...

...is a thing of beauty,
like a work of art.

400
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,091
And like a work of art,
it is created by artists.

401
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:50,178
The greater the artist,
the greater the art.

402
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,307
And what makes an artist?

403

Never.

from more serious matters.

She never listens to me much.

Which reminds me, she mustn't know
I was here with you.

00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,207
And why not?
What's wrong with being with me?

00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,875
It isn't you. It's here.

489
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,711
I told you. This isn't serious matters.

I don't remember it all by heart.

One mustn't read novels,

Don't wear powder,

Common?

00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,795
How do you mean "common"?
Ordinary common or coarse common?

Ordinary.

He's an excellent teacher.
I made amazing progress.

But he's so conceited.
So superior in an inferior way.

00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:35,568
Alfred de Musset, Victor Hugo, Napoleon.

That's enough, Manuel.
You've made your point.

621

Here, put this in your mouth.

622
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:24,325

...from her painted toenails
to the top of her bleached head.

We're going to Honfleur, naturally.

Are you mad?
I never want to see her again.

Of course you don't.

634

But you're not going to
let a woman have the last word.

I'll write her a note.

641
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,171
There is no way of writing it
without it reeking of wounded pride.

642
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,215
Victor Hugo couldn't pull it off.

643
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,884
Then I'll telephone her.

644
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,636
And what will you say?

00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:29,890
"Liane, you deceived me

I never want to see you again."

You'll sound like a jealous schoolboy.

01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:22,134
-How good to see you.
-Mamita.

1137
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:24,094
I have a present for--

1138
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,514
What's the matter with her?

1139
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:28,974
-Everything.
-Oh.

1140
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:32,144
Don't you look well!

1141
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,855
Did you have a nice trip?

1142
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:38,400
How was Monte Carlo this year?

1143
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:41,862
Well, the sea is blue.
The palm trees are green.

1144
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:45,073
The sun is yellow.
It all makes a lovely postcard.

1145
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:47,200
Just as it should be.

1146
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:48,827
Actually, it's a bore.

1147
01:10:49,037 --> 01:10:53,415
One has to be as rich as you
to be bored at Monte Carlo.

1148
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:56,668
I brought Gigi some caramels.

1149
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,588
Really, Gaston, you spoil her too much.

1150
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:02,341
Would you like a cup of chamomile tea?

1151
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,217
Please. Please, Mamita.

1152
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:14,770
[GIGI CLEARS THROAT]

1153
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:16,855
Look, Gaston.

1154
01:11:17,065 --> 01:11:19,358
Four yards of material in the skirt.

1155
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,865
Well, don't I look great ladyish?

1156
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:29,618
You look like
an organ grinder's monkey!

1157
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:33,789
An organ grinder's monkey?

1158
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,707
What happened to your
little Scotch dress?

1159
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:38,377
And that ridiculous collar!

1160
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,671
And what's wrong with that collar?

1161
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:43,799
It makes you look like
a giraffe with a goiter.

1162
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,888
With all the talk
there is about you, Gaston...

1163
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,891
...I've never heard it said
you had any taste in clothes.

1164
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,936
Have you gone mad? How dare you
speak to Gaston like that?

1165
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:58,188
Apologize. Apologize at once!

1166
01:11:58,398 --> 01:12:00,983
I certainly will not.
This is a beautiful dress.

1167
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:02,234
Gaston, please.

1168
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:04,569
I beg of you, wait. She'll apologize.

1169
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:07,823
Is this the education she gets
from you and your sister?

1170
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,283
My congratulations to you both.

1171
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:12,703
Gigi!

1172
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:14,079
What have you done?

1173
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:17,416
Why did he fly off the handle?
He knew I'd answer him back.

1174
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,084
You ungrateful little thing.

1175
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:22,254
How can you be rude to Gaston
when he's been so good to us?

1176
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:24,923
And just when we were trying so hard...

1177
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,801
...to make an elegant
young lady out of you.

1178
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:30,637
To show you off
to your best advantage.

1179
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:34,182
You must admit, one doesn't have to
turn oneself inside out...

1180
01:12:34,434 --> 01:12:36,476
...for an old friend like Gaston.

1181
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:38,103
It's silly.

1182
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:40,313
It's absolutely silly.

1183
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:16,224
I've decided your new dress
may not be as bad as all that.

1184
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:20,020
I didn't see it properly,
and perhaps I was a bit cruel.

1185
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,606
To prove it, I'll take you for a drive...

1186
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,233
...for tea at the Reservoirs
in Versailles.

1187
01:13:25,485 --> 01:13:27,486
-Would you like that?
-I'd love it!

1188
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:31,615
Grandmama! Gaston wants to take me
to tea at the Reservoirs.

1189
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:35,702
You've come back, Gaston.
How tolerant you are.

1190
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:37,079
I hadn't really gone.

1191
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,664
We're going to tea at the Reservoirs.

1192
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:41,041
No, you're not.

1193
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,793
I'm sorry, Gaston.

1194
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:44,836
What do you mean?

1195
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:46,046
Grandmama, please.

1196
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:48,340
Gigi, go to your room for a moment.

1197
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:51,301
I have to talk to Gaston
about something.

1198
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:52,594
No, Grandmama.

1199
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:54,930
Gigi, do as you're told.

1200
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,521
GASTON:
Mamita, what does this mean?

1201
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:05,023
Something has changed here lately.

1202
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:06,525
I can feel it.

1203
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:09,069
Sit down, Gaston.

1204
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,163
Please.

1205
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:28,713
Gaston, you know my friendship for you.

1206
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:31,341
My friendship and my gratitude.

1207
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,177
But I must not forget my duty.

1208
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:39,224
Gigi's mother has neither the time
nor the mind to take care of her.

1209
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,811
And Gigi isn't just another girl.
She's special.

1210
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:44,563
Of course.

1211
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,482
For years, you've been giving her
candies and trinkets...

1212
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:48,942
...and she adores you.

1213
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:53,780
Now you want to take her in your
automobile to the Reservoirs for tea.

1214
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:57,242
If it were just you and I, I would say:

1215
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:00,912
"Take Gigi wherever you want."
I would trust her with you anywhere.

1216
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:04,749
But there are others, Gaston.
You are known everywhere.

1217
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:07,586
For a woman to go out
with you alone now...

1218
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:10,255
...with the eyes of Paris on you....

1219
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,757
Are you trying to make me believe...

1220
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:16,011
...that if Gigi goes out with me,
she'll be compromised?

1221
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,680
Let us say she would be labeled.

1222
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:22,976
A young girl who goes out with you
is no longer an ordinary young girl.

1223
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,270
Not even a respectable young girl.

1224
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,522
Mamita, this is absurd.

1225
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:31,526
As far as you are concerned,
it would be just another news item.

1226
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:34,821
But in this case, I would not
have the heart to laugh...

1227
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,781
...when I read it in the newspapers.

1228
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:39,284
This is too ridiculous
to discuss any further.

1229
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:43,288
I don't want to contradict you,
and I don't want to argue about it.

1230
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:47,751
If you feel you are protecting Gigi
from some cruel fate, that's your affair.

1231
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:51,421
I understand responsibility to Gigi
better than you.

1232
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:56,468
I'll do all I can to entrust her
only to a man who'll be able to say:

1233
01:15:56,761 --> 01:16:00,513
"I'll take care of her.
I'll answer for her future."

1234
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:09,648
Now, can I get you
your chamomile tea, Gaston?

1235
01:16:09,941 --> 01:16:12,442
No, thank you. I have an appointment...

1236
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:14,486
...and I'm late already.

1237
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:17,864
But forgive me if I wonder, madame...

1238
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:21,493
...whom you are keeping her for?
Some underpaid bank clerk...

1239
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:25,163
...who'll marry her and give her
four children in three years?

1240
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:26,498
You're upset. Please--

1241
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:30,835
To see her married in white in
a dingy little church to a plumber...

1242
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,213
...who'll only give her
a worthless name...

1243
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:35,674
...and the squalor of good intentions?

1244
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:37,842
Very well, madame. Very well!

1245
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,344
If that's your ambition...

1246
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:42,931
...inflict your misery
in the name of respectability.

1247
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:45,850
I pity you! I pity you all!

1248
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:52,732
Upset!

1249
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:54,693
What utter rubbish!

1250
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:17,507
Pierre...

1251
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,884
...do I look upset?

1252
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:21,845
Yes, monsieur, you do.

1253
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:24,764
Upset!

1254
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:32,230
Upset indeed!

1255
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,107
She's a babe

1256
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:35,900
Just a babe

1257
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,610
Still cavorting in her crib

1258
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:39,487
Eating breakfast with a bib

1259
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:42,240
With her baby teeth
And all her baby curls

1260
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,034
She's a tot

1261
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:45,744
Just a tot

1262
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:49,622
Good for bouncing on your knee
I am positive that she

1263
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:52,125
Doesn't even know
That boys aren't girls

1264
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:54,085
She's a snip

1265
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:55,795
Just a snip

1266
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:59,758
Making dreadful baby noise
Having fun with all her toys

1267
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,344
Just a chickadee
Who needs a mother hen

1268
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:06,264
She's a cub, a papoose
You could never turn her loose

1269
01:18:06,474 --> 01:18:09,267
She's too infantile
To take her from her pen

1270
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:16,358
Of course, that weekend in Trouville

1271
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:19,194
In spite of all her youthful zeal

1272
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,696
She was exceedingly polite

1273
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:24,699
And on the whole, a sheer delight

1274
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,327
And if it wasn't joy galore

1275
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:30,288
At least not once was she a bore

1276
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:32,665
That I recall

1277
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:35,293
No, not at all

1278
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:37,796
She's a child

1279
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:39,214
A silly child

1280
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,134
Adolescent to her toes
And good heaven, how it shows

1281
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:46,137
Sticky thumbs are all the fingers
She has got

1282
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:47,430
She's a child

1283
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,015
A clumsy child

1284
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,811
She's as swollen as a grape
And she doesn't have a shape

1285
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:55,397
Where her figure ought to be
It is not!

1286
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,190
Just a child

1287
01:18:57,608 --> 01:18:58,858
A growing child

1288
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:02,529
But so backward for her years
If a boy her age appears

1289
01:19:02,822 --> 01:19:05,031
I am certain
He will never call again

1290
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:09,035
She's a scamp and a brat
Doesn't know where she is at

Of course, I must in truth confess

1293
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:21,464
That in her brand-new little dress

1294
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:24,342
She looked surprisingly mature

1295
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:27,220
And had a definite allure

1296
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:30,348
It was a shock, in fact, to me

1297
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:33,268
A most amazing shock to see

1298
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:35,562
The way it clung

She's a girl

A little girl

Getting older, it is true
Which is what they always do

When they blossom like a flower

Oh, no.

Or have I merely been too blind

-Mamita, are you alone?
-Yes.

Good. I have an important
business matter to discuss with you.

1362
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,864
Now, let us recapitulate.

1363
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:59,951
To begin with, he said she would
be spoiled as no other--

1364
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:04,247
He said she would be spoiled
as no other woman has been before.

1365
01:24:04,498 --> 01:24:08,334
It's all right, but it's vague.
I like everything spelled out.

1366
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:10,378
Did he say precisely
where she would live?

1367
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:13,005
He said a suitable house
on the Avenue du Bois.

1368
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:14,632
-You're sure?
-Of course.

Well, very good.
Servants?

1370
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:18,761
Yes, he mentioned servants.

1371
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:20,430
What about an automobile?

1372
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:22,807
I think so. I'm not quite sure.

1373
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:25,393
She must have an automobile
and a chauffeur.

1374
01:24:25,853 --> 01:24:28,938
I'm sure he didn't mean
to be evasive or ungenerous.

1375
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:31,858
He suggested that you and I
and our lawyer...

1376
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:35,445
...meet at his lawyer tomorrow
and draw it up in detail.

1377
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:39,240
You call him and tell him to
bring his lawyer to our lawyer.

-How could she?

1381
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:50,168
He just left. But he wants to
have dinner with her this evening.

1382
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:53,171
When you speak to Gigi,
be sure and stress...

1383

...the difficulties of the situation
rather than the delights.

1384

The role she will have to play.

1385
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:00,261
She's a naive, thoughtless girl.

1386
01:25:00,471 --> 01:25:02,764
You must warn her not to
ask for the moon.

I know what I told your grandmother.
We don't have to repeat it.

To take care of me beautifully
means I shall go away with you...

But I know more than she told me.
To take care of me...

...means that I shall have
my photograph in the papers.

That I shall go to the Riviera.
To the races at Deauville.

Yes, Gaston.

1436

Until it begins again.

1437
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:31,681
It's not your fault
you're world-famous.

1438
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:35,393
It's just that I haven't got
a world-famous sort of nature.

1439
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:41,273
When it's over, Gaston Lachaille
goes off with another lady.

1440

And I have only to go into

And I think I should have
something to say about it.

01:54:42,251 --> 01:54:46,462
One day will flash and send you
Crashing through the ceiling

1768
01:54:47,673 --> 01:54:50,841
Thank heaven for little girls

1769
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:56,722
Thank heaven for them all
No matter where, no matter who

1770
01:54:57,641 --> 01:55:01,143
Without them
What would little boys do?

1771
01:55:03,146 --> 01:55:04,480
Thank heaven

1772
01:55:05,857 --> 01:55:07,400
Thank heaven

1773
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:10,653
Thank heaven

1774
01:55:10,904 --> 01:55:13,239
For little girls
