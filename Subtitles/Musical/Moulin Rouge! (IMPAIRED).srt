1743
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:37,300
And then one
not so very special day,

1744
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,900
I went to my typewriter,

1745
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,200
I sat down...

1746
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:44,200
and I wrote our story.

1747
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:49,100
A story about a time,

1748
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:52,400
a story about a place,

1749
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:55,700
a story about the people.

1750
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:58,500
But above all things,

1751
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:02,000
a story about love.

1752
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,100
A love...

1753
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:07,100
that will live...

1754
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:09,100
forever.

1755
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:13,800
The...

1756
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:15,800
end.

1757
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:23,600
[Christian]
The greatest thing

1758
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,900
You'll ever learn

1759
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:35,600
Is just to love

1760
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,200
And be loved

1761
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:47,900
In return
