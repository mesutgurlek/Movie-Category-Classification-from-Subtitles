Would the countess like anything to eat?

800
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,268
No, thanks

801
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,530
We've dined

802
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,745
The countess has lost
one of her buckles

803
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,742
Must have lost it
when we were dancing

804
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,326
But the countess
wanted to play tonight

805
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:29,396
Oh, yes
That's what we wanted to do

806
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:34,436
But Duke Otto was there, so, of course,
that made it impossible for us to stay

807
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:36,664
Well, we had to do something

808
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:40,238
So, we went out and

809
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:42,311
looked around

810
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:48,642
Bertha, you've no idea
how beautiful Monte Carlo is

811
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,083
The park- simply divine

812
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:54,122
And the promenade -
like a walk in the clouds

813
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:58,489
And as far as you could see,
not a soul

814
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:02,190
And so we sat down close

815
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:04,266
Very close

816
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,461
Uh, you see, I felt so cold

817
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:12,098
Yes, there's a very strong
sea breeze tonight

818
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,108
Yes Quite right Quite right

819
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,144
A very strong sea breeze

820
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:19,305
And when the countess felt so cold?

821
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:23,408
Well, uh, finally I became so -

822
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,578
I became so chilly

823
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,781
I didn't want to take any chances

824
