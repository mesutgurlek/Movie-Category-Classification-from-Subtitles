MARLEY: <i>When I was seven years</i>
<i>old, I had a dream.</i>

49
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:14,145
<i>It's the first one</i>
<i>I actually remember.</i>

50
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:17,398
<i>I was alone... on a stage</i>

51
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:19,734
<i>wearing a beautiful dress.</i>

52
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:21,286
<i>I couldn't see the audience,</i>

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,405
<i>but I could feel</i>
<i>the full house.</i>

54
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:30,745
<i>They had all come for one</i>
<i>reason: to hear me sing.</i>

55
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:34,833
<i>And now, thanks to Glee Club,</i>
<i>with sectionals this week,</i>

56
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:36,718
<i>that dream is about</i>
<i>to come true.</i>

57
00:03:36,752 --> 00:03:38,920
<i>Well, except the part where</i>
<i>Skeet Ulrich gave me</i>

58
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:40,388
<i>a bouquet of kittens</i>
<i>at the end.</i>

59
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:42,423
<i>My dreams are weird.</i>

60
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:44,509
<i>Mom's doing great</i>
<i>with her diet.</i>

61
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:46,060
<i>She's lost 12 pounds!</i>

62
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,229
<i>I haven't lost quite as much,</i>

63
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:50,648
<i>but I'm pretty sure I can see</i>
<i>a difference.</i>

64
00:03:50,683 --> 00:03:53,067
<i>I'm not letting up</i>
<i>until after sectionals, though.</i>

65
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:57,438
<i>I've got to look my best</i>
<i>up there.</i>

66
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,191
<i>I just want to be great</i>
<i>for all of them.</i>

67
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:02,861
<i>I can feel how much</i>
<i>they're depending on me.</i>

68
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:04,445
<i>I can't let them down.</i>

69
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:06,364
<i>Especially them.</i>

70
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:09,584
<i>The pressure is on,</i>
<i>Marley Rose,</i>

71
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:11,502
<i>and it's like Mom always</i>
<i>says...</i>

72
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:13,288
Don't blow it.

73
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:16,207
PUCK: So I said, "You girls are
gonna need another cup."

(laughter)

75
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:21,346
Yeah, but, guys, I'd like
to propose a toast:

76
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,014
To almost all of us keeping
our promise

77
00:04:23,048 --> 00:04:24,182
to come home for Thanksgiving.

78
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:25,633
Cheers!
Cheers!

79
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:26,584
Here's to us.

80
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:29,854
Has anybody heard
from Rachel or Kurt?

81
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:31,306
No. I know Blaine's been

82
00:04:31,357 --> 00:04:33,858
texting him, but
Kurt won't text back.

83
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:35,310
Well, Rachel e-mailed me.
She said she's not really sure

84
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:37,478
what she's doing
for the holidays yet.

85
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,614
I'm sorry about what went down
with the two of you.

86
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:42,450
No, it's cool.
It's for the best.

87
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:43,484
Well, I think that it's sweet

88
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:45,987
that you and Rachel
keep in touch, Quinn.

89
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:47,622
Well, she basically e-mails me
every other week

90
00:04:47,656 --> 00:04:49,290
to remind me that I still
haven't used

91
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:50,708
the train ticket
that she gave me.

92
00:04:50,743 --> 00:04:52,627
I'm just, I'm trying
to keep straight A's.

93
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:53,795
And I just got tapped to be in

94
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:56,331
the only female secret society
at Yale.

95
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:59,000
Former members: Hillary Clinton,
Jennifer Beals.

96
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:02,337
You go, girl.
(all chuckle)

97
00:05:02,388 --> 00:05:03,638
Well, I, for one, would love

98
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:05,590
to talk about everybody
that <i>is</i> here.

99
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:07,809
I have a favor to ask.

100
00:05:07,843 --> 00:05:09,310
(bell ringing)

101
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:13,147
All right, do you realize,
standing before you are legends?

102
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:15,483
(cheers and applause)

103
00:05:15,517 --> 00:05:17,602
Any single one of these guys
could be.

104
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:19,687
President of the United States
one day.

105
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:21,689
I don't know about that.
And lucky for us,

106
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,191
they've agreed to help us...

107
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:25,360
Hang with the new chumps
and see if some of

108
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:27,578
our sheer awesomeness
doesn't rub off on you.

109
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:29,347
It will.

110
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:31,082
When you hear your name,
pair up.

111
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:32,316
Puck, you're with your brother.

112
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:36,754
Mike, you're with Ryder.

113
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:39,607
Marley, you're with Santana.

114
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:41,009
Kitty, you're with Quinn.

115
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:43,177
Oh!
Wade, Mercedes.

116
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:45,430
Sashay.
<i>Enchanté.</i>

117
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:47,215
I knew it.
Mercedes was cloned.

118
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:51,135
Now, your mentors are here to
help you with whatever you need:

119
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:52,353
Singing, dancing...

120
00:05:52,388 --> 00:05:53,471
Birth control.

121
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:55,857
You're so funny and
self-deprecating!

122
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:57,392
We're so much alike!

123
00:05:57,443 --> 00:05:58,476
Wanky.

124
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,944
The worst mistake
that we can make

125
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,129
is to underestimate
our competition.

126
00:06:01,163 --> 00:06:02,947
The Warblers are ruthless
this year.

127
00:06:02,982 --> 00:06:04,615
Don't forget about
the Rosedale Mennonites.

128
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,368
Any show choir that can
raise a barn in five minutes

129
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:08,953
deserves mad respect.

130
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:11,406
Marley and Blaine will handle
our duet,

131
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:15,126
and for the showstopper
we're doing "Gangnam Style."

132
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,577
Okay, lumps,
let me just say out loud

133
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:18,079
what everyone here is thinking:

134
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,548
You finally got an okay haircut,
you're not doing

135
00:06:20,582 --> 00:06:23,801
that annoying half smirk
as much as you used to,

136
00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:26,220
but you're still a idiot.
No one in this room

137
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:28,923
can tackle a massive dance
number except for Brit.

138
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,925
That includes your little
"Hand-Jive"

139
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:33,061
that, to me, looked more
like a hand...

140
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:35,179
Is there any way Mr. Shue
can come back for this?

141
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:38,149
Listen to me, we have never lost
sectionals before,

142
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:40,651
and there's no way we're
gonna do it under my watch.

143
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:43,154
We can and we will succeed!

144
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:46,657
We need an ambitious number
with a strong dance element.

145
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:48,910
That's the Warbler's calling
card, and we need to blow them

146
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:50,862
out of the water. And Mike said
he could easily show

147
00:06:50,896 --> 00:06:53,031
one of our guys how to do
the dance number. I did?

148
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:56,117
Crap. I, uh, I kind of forgot
to ask you about that.

149
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:58,086
But one of our guys
is gonna have

150
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,422
to take the lead with Brit.
So who's it gonna be?

151
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:02,874
Hello? White Chocolate.

152
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:05,009
(beatboxing)

153
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:08,513
MERCEDES:
Oh, no, no, no. Um...

154
00:07:08,547 --> 00:07:09,714
(bell ringing)

155
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:11,599
Hey, I can't believe
that we have to dance

156
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:12,850
for this guy who's
getting trained

157
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:14,018
at the Joffrey Ballet School.

158
00:07:14,053 --> 00:07:15,303
He's gonna think
I'm special needs.

159
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:16,637
Listen, man, I need to talk

160
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:17,805
to you about something else.

161
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:20,892
Last Friday...

162
00:07:20,926 --> 00:07:22,777
I kind of went out with Marley.

163
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:24,145
Kind of?

164
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:25,897
I mean, we didn't
actually go anywhere.

165
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:28,316
We just kind of hung out
and played SongPop

166
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:29,317
and Bad Piggies all night.

167
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:31,369
So this is like a thing?

168
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:33,905
Not if it's gonna make us
mortal enemies again.

169
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:36,791
I'll end it if you want me to,
but for the record,

170
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:39,660
I wasn't just gonna
hump her and dump her.

171
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:42,230
Marley's different,
she's special.

172
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,251
No, don't break it off
because of me.

173
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:50,388
Yeah?

174
00:07:50,422 --> 00:07:52,090
Yeah, but you better not snake

175
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:54,308
the dance lead from me,
all right?

176
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:57,011
You don't get to have
everything at this school.

177
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:58,396
That's all yours, dude.

178
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,682
I don't have any end
zone moves anyway.

179
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,602
RACHEL: So I found out that I
didn't get cast in <i>Glass Menagerie,</i>

180
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:06,687
KURT: Oh! But the NYADA
Showcase is this week,

181
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:08,689
so I'm gonna spend the whole,
long holiday weekend

182
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,409
just really prepping for it to
make sure that I get it. Good.

183
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:12,860
Did you put in
your application?

184
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:15,696
Yes, and I put it on Vogue.com
stationery so it'd stand out.

185
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:17,415
I'm really feeling good
about us staying home

186
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:18,616
for the weekend, don't you?

187
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,201
Yeah, yeah. Yeah-yeah-
yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah.

188
00:08:20,252 --> 00:08:22,870
We don't have to go home
just because there's a show

189
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:24,622
or because it's
a long weekend, right?

190
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:25,873
Right, no.
I mean,

191
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:26,958
even though it's Thanksgiving,

192
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:29,794
and sectionals, and
all our friends are there,

193
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:31,212
and I miss my dad.

194
00:08:31,263 --> 00:08:34,465
I miss my dads, too,
but I just feel like every time

195
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:36,384
we go home,
it just makes me feel sad

196
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:38,102
and like we're not like
moving forward, you know?

197
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:39,854
And even though we don't have
our boyfriends,

198
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:41,472
we still have our dreams
and our ambition.

199
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:42,557
And each other.

200
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:44,559
Yes. You are the only
significant other I need

201
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,710
in my life.
Oh...

202
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:47,445
I have to just, you know,
forget about Finn

203
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,696
and forget about Brody.

204
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,314
Forget about Blaine.

205
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:53,034
Yeah, forget any guy who's broke
an girl or guy's heart, okay?

206
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,702
We are on the verge of becoming

207
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:56,737
the best versions of ourselves.
Can't you feel it?

208
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:58,072
For the first time,
probably because

209
00:08:58,123 --> 00:08:59,574
it's easier just
to drink your Kool-Aid,

210
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,243
than go against you.
I know what you mean.

211
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:03,995
Look. Look at our life.

212
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:05,463
Look at this city!
Yeah.

213
00:09:05,497 --> 00:09:08,216
I know that it can be a little
sad and lonely sometimes,

214
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,884
but I promise you,

215
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:14,088
we are gonna have the
best Thanksgiving ever.

216
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:15,640
Pinkie promise?

217
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:17,425

Okay, fellas,

220

Korean boy bands have
been tearing up the music scene,

221
00:09:29,923 --> 00:09:31,924
and there's a lot
we can learn from them.

222
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,843

00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:26,679
are National Showchoir

Santana, Brittany and I
knew each other so well

00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:36,772
that I could tell by
the slightest quiver

252
00:10:36,824 --> 00:10:39,242
in Santana's upper lip which way
we were gonna move.

Whether our hips
are gonna shake or shimmy.

No. You girls have to be
tight up there, okay?

255
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:46,165
The judges love the
feminine quality,

and the Warblers
just don't have it.

257
00:10:47,868 --> 00:10:49,502
It's about being individuals.

You know, we're all different.

259

But it's also about
synchronicity.

00:13:10,477 --> 00:13:11,677
Hey, are you...
are you feeling okay?

317
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:12,845
You look like you're gonna hurl.

318
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,064
Um, I think
I'm just really tired

319
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:16,265
from all the rehearsing.

320
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:19,018
(bell ringing)

321
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:21,821
KITTY: <i>Now that we're alone,
can I tell you a secret?</i>

322
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:23,406
Of course.

323
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,857
If Finn
hadn't paired us together,

324
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:26,575
I would've thrown such a hissy.

325
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,943
Why is that?

326
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:30,780
Because you're Quinn Fabray,
and I idolize you.

327
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:32,531
You're Cheerios royalty.

328
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:34,417
Can I show you something?
Sure.

329
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:37,086
Every day, I ask myself,

330
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,287
"What would Quinn Fabray do?"

331
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,591
It's really nice to know
that people still remember me.

332
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:43,759
Remember you?

333
00:13:43,794 --> 00:13:45,928
Oh, no, we aspire to
be you, me especially.

334
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:47,380
What's with Marley?

335
00:13:47,414 --> 00:13:49,432
She seemed a little out of it
during rehearsal.

336
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:50,966
Oh, that one?

337
00:13:51,018 --> 00:13:52,134
She's sweet as pie,

338
00:13:52,185 --> 00:13:53,853
and I've tried to be
a good friend to her,

339
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:56,022
but ever since she started
dating Jake Puckerman,

340
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:57,807
I fear she's on the wrong path.

341
00:13:57,858 --> 00:14:01,143
Word is he's pressuring her
to swipe her V-card.

342
00:14:01,194 --> 00:14:02,311
If that were to happen,

343
00:14:02,362 --> 00:14:04,313
well, no one knows the
dangers of a good girl

344
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:07,033
mixing with a Puckerman
better than you.

345
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,652
I can't believe that you're
not dancing with Brittany.

346
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:11,120
I've seen you.

347
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:12,988
You're incredible.

348
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,707
You told me that you love it.

349
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:16,208
You take lessons.

350
00:14:16,243 --> 00:14:18,327
It's kind of an honor amongst
bro thing with Ryder.

351
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:20,129
Look, he's being really cool
about you and me,

352
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,297
and he wants the solo,

353
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:23,165
so I'm just trying
to do him a solid.

354
00:14:23,216 --> 00:14:24,917
Even if that means
we lose sectionals?

355
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,585
(sighs)

356
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:27,837
Ryder's gonna be great.

357
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:29,505
I promise.

358
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:30,673
I will make sure he's great.

359
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:32,141
Now can I walk you
to lunch please?

360
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:33,509
You've been skipping out
on me all week.

361
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,760
Can't. I have to rehearse.

362
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:37,263
Because I'm not gonna be the one

363
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:39,065
who lets the team down.

364
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:42,935
(bell ringing)

365
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:45,688
Uh, guys, listen up.

366
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:47,940
Ms. July said that
she does not want to teach today

367
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:50,192
because she can't stand
to be in the same room

368
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:52,278
as your mediocrity again.

369
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:54,530
If you ask me,
she just sounds super hung over.

370
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:56,949
Either way, I will be
teaching Dance 101 today.

371
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:03,756
Is there a problem?

372
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,125
Well, you know, everyone here
pays like, $30,000 a year

373
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,127
to be taught by a professional
and not a T.A.

374
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:10,379
I'm sorry, are you angry at me
about something?

375
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,182
You mean, besides the fact
that you slept with Cassie?

376
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:15,017
And why do you care
who I sleep with?

377
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:16,569
Do I really need to answer that?

378
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:18,354
Hey, I'm the one
who came on to you,

379
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:20,222
remember? You broke
off our date

380
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:22,374
to see another guy.
Yeah, well, that's over now.

381
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:24,527
And what, so I'm supposed
to have retroactively known

382
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:26,979
that that was gonna happen
and not slept with Cassie?

383
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,647
All right, guys,

384
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:31,400
let's, uh, let's pair up and
start with a basic fox-trot.

385
00:15:31,451 --> 00:15:33,452
(music begins)

386
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:37,406
We're not in high
school anymore, okay?

387
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:39,325
We're adults

388
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,993
making adult choices.

389
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,578
You made yourself unavailable.

390
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:44,497
Don't be that crazy girl

391
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:46,081
who expects people
to read her mind.

392
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:49,001
Well, I'm sorry, but you don't
have to be a mind reader to know

393
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,219
that she is my mortal enemy.

394
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,004
Did it at least suck?
Are you kidding?

395
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:54,089
It was amazing. Have
you seen her ass?

396
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:57,426
Look, but I know
that we're friends

397
00:15:57,477 --> 00:16:00,596
and I don't want
to hurt you, so...

398
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:02,881
it won't happen again, okay?

399
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:06,435
Okay.

400
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:07,937
What are you doing
for Thanksgiving?

401
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:09,605
Going back to Ohio?

402
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:10,940
No, Kurt and I are doing

403
00:16:10,991 --> 00:16:14,109
our little private
orphan Thanksgiving here.

404
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:15,861
Wow, that sounds awful
and depressing,

405
00:16:15,895 --> 00:16:17,613
especially since I've tasted
your cooking.

406
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:19,114
(chuckles)
All right, guys, come on.

407
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,583
Let's take it from the top.

408
00:16:20,617 --> 00:16:23,369
And this time,
can we actually try?

409
00:16:25,121 --> 00:16:27,173
So I can't afford
to go home this year.

410
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:30,876
How about I come over
and cook for you guys?

411
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:35,297
Yeah, that would be great.

412
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:36,799
Do you mind if I bring Cassie?
Oh, shut up.

413
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,601
Just dance with me.
Okay.

414
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:41,303
PUCK: That's a real solid you're
doing for that Ryder dude.

415
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:43,556
"Bros before hos" was always
my mantra in high school.

416
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,475
Well, it was after I knocked up
my best friend's girlfriend.

417
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:48,310
Oh, speak of the devil
I knocked up.

418
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:49,478
Back off of Marley.

419
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:50,613
Excuse me?

420
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:51,647
I got this, little bro.

421
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:53,148
See that furrowed brow,
lips pursed,

422
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,650
hand on her hip,
this is what I like

423
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:55,784
to call "Loopy Quinn."

424
00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:56,952
It's an irrational state

425
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:58,737
that she apparently only
reserves for Puckermans.

426
00:16:58,771 --> 00:17:00,322
He's messing with her head.

427
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:01,657
He's pressuring her
to have sex th him.

428
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,459
Who told you that?
I don't need somebody to tell me

429
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:05,160
that the biggest womanizer
in school

430
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:07,046
is trying to take advantage
of the naive girl

431
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,998
who just wants to
fit in and be loved,

432
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:11,417
especially if the womanizer's
last name is Puckerman.

433
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:13,219
You don't know me.
I'm a lot of thing he's not,

434
00:17:13,253 --> 00:17:14,503
and I would never do that
to Marley.

435
00:17:14,554 --> 00:17:16,505
I don't believe you.

436
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:19,508
Quinn, I think you're being
a little out of line here.

437
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,311
The only way
you're gonna win sectionals

438
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:24,230
is if Marley's at her best.

439
00:17:24,264 --> 00:17:25,681
And if you keep distracting her,

440
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:27,966
she's not going to be.

441
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:39,744
Hey.
Oh!

442
00:17:39,778 --> 00:17:41,362
Oh, Isabelle, I am so sorry.

443
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:42,663
I thought I was
the last one here.

444
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:43,998
Its okay. Actually,
I'm almost done.

445
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:46,167
I'm just, um, proofing
the filmmaker roundtable.

446
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:47,818
Oh, I love that article.

447
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,236
Oh, good.
I love Christmas movies.

448
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:50,871
Be honest, which one

449
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:52,156
are you looking forward to
the most,

450
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,574
<i>Les Miz</i> or <i>The Hobbit?</i>

451
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,326
Oh, wow.

452
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,660
I love Peter Jackson,

453
00:17:56,694 --> 00:17:59,330
but I'm obsessed
with the French Revolution,

454
00:17:59,364 --> 00:18:01,749
so, uh, I suppose it would have

455
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,752
to be... a double feature.
A double feature?

456
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:06,504
(chuckles)

457
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:09,757
So, uh, do you have any
fantabulous Thanksgiving plans?

458
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:11,759
For the last five years,
I always went to Gore Vidal's

459
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,427
for dinner and Pictionary.

460
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:16,263
But you know,
Gore passed away this year,

461
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:17,731
so I don't know.

462
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:19,266
I'll probably just get
some turkey pizza

463
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:20,901
from Two Boots and, uh,

464
00:18:20,936 --> 00:18:22,269
recreate my first Thanksgiving

465
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,437
in New York.

466
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:25,739
Well, if you're interested,

467
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:28,342
my roommate and I are hosting
a bit of an orphan's dinner

468
00:18:28,376 --> 00:18:29,527
out in Bushwick.

469
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:31,195
Bushwick? Ooh.

470
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:33,113
A rustic Thanksgiving.

471
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:34,532
(chuckles)

472
00:18:34,566 --> 00:18:35,866
Can I bring some friends?
Of course.

473
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,618
We'll have as many orphans

474
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:39,420
as Mr. Bumble's workhouse,
right?

475
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:41,121
Gruel for everyone.

476
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:43,207
You seem in a better mood.

477
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:44,291
You and your ex

478
00:18:44,342 --> 00:18:45,459
have a <i>rapprochement?</i>

479
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,127
<i>Au contraire.</i>

480
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:48,295
No, I'm closing the book

481
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:50,464
to that sad saga.
I'm just...

482
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:51,966
I'm done.
I'm done thinking about it.

483
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:54,218
I'm done thinking if we're
gonna get back together,

484
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:56,604
wondering if we should
get back together.

485
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:57,972
No, it's over.

486
00:18:58,023 --> 00:18:59,690
I sent him a text.

487
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:02,476
Said, "Please, stop calling me
to say you're sorry."

488
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,777
What's done is done."

489
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:05,062
You know.
Well, listen,

490
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:08,482
nothing is better than being
single in New York City,

491
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:11,068
but you know, if he's
been reaching out to you...

492
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:12,319
Assuage his guilt?

493
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,654
No, sorry, cheater.

494
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:14,989
This petal needs to move on.

495
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,790
In my experience,

496
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,826
it's always easier
for me to move on

497
00:19:18,877 --> 00:19:20,794
if I've either
had my apology accepted,

498
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:26,000
or in your case,
accepted an apology.

499
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:27,635
You know,

500
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:30,471
sometimes it's the not forgiving
that holds us back.

501
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:32,339
(sighs)

502
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,008
(bell rings)

503
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:35,175
QUINN:
Try to make eye contact

504
00:19:35,227 --> 00:19:37,478
with the judges,
and don't be afraid

505
00:19:37,512 --> 00:19:38,596
to give them
a flirty little smile

506
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,980
or maybe even a wink.

507
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:41,682
You're really doing them
a favor.

508
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:43,267
You're reminding them
of their youth

509
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:44,685
and what might have been.

510
00:19:44,736 --> 00:19:45,853
I'm gonna write that down.

511
00:19:45,904 --> 00:19:48,305
You're the best mentor ever.

512
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:51,859
Seriously, the best.

513
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:54,478
<i>Hola.</i>

514
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,698
That bitch is pure evil.

515
00:19:57,749 --> 00:19:59,533
I think she's sweet.
Really?

516
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:01,535
Well, then why is she giving
my girl laxatives?

517
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:03,037
Why are you going
through my bag?

518
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:04,505
It's all part
of being a mentor.

519
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,206
What is this, huh?

520
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:07,541
And don't tell me

521
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:09,793
it's 'cause the cafeteria food
binds you up.

522
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:11,211
Those are like, from months ago.

523
00:20:11,263 --> 00:20:12,880
I forgot
they were even in there.

524
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:14,381
Your pretty little liar
gave them to her.

525
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:17,017
I can sense it thanks to my
psychic Mexican third eye.

526
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:19,853
See, this is what my psych
professor calls projecting.

527
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:22,056
You're projecting Kitty
onto me.

528
00:20:22,107 --> 00:20:24,191
Santana, we've graduated.
It's really time

529
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:25,559
to get over this.
Get over what?

530
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,144
You being jealous of me.

531
00:20:27,178 --> 00:20:30,147
And why would I
be jealous of you?

532
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:31,532
And please don't tell me

533
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:34,068
its because you're in some lame
secret Nazi sorority.

534
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,619
Look, Homecoming weekend,

535
00:20:35,654 --> 00:20:37,321
I went
to Jodie Foster's clambake,

536
00:20:37,355 --> 00:20:38,405
and that professor

537
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:39,740
that I was talking about,

538
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,575
well, he's 35,

539
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:43,243
smokes a pipe.

540
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:44,878
Well, he's divorcing his wife

541
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:47,331
who hasn't touched him
for three years.

542
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:48,716
I'm dating him.

543
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,084
Wow, Twitter update!

544
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:51,585
Quinn is

545
00:20:51,636 --> 00:20:54,755
all excited about another guy
defining her life.

546
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:56,173
And what are you excited about?

547
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:57,725
Shaking pom-poms in Kentucky?

548
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,893
I mean, you want everybody to
think that you're such a badass,

549
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:01,878
but really you're just
a scared little girl

550
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:03,314
with low self-esteem

551
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:05,566
who's too frightened
to chase her dreams.

552
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,101
Did Professor Patches
teach you that one

553
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:09,403
in between quickies
on his office couch?

554
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:11,388
Does he get so turned on

555
00:21:11,406 --> 00:21:13,824
by teen moms who barely
visit their kid?

556
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:15,025
(gasps)

557
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:16,994
What are you guys doing?

558
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:20,998
Nothing.

559
00:21:24,953 --> 00:21:26,337
Quinn always was
a genius slapper.

560
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:27,738

00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,509
(muttering lyrics)

563
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,801
Are you dancing

564
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:42,686
or impersonating
a horny epileptic?

565
00:21:42,721 --> 00:21:44,438
Dude, I can't concentrate
on the moves

566
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:46,423
until I memorize the words.

567
00:21:46,441 --> 00:21:48,442
(panting)

568
00:21:50,528 --> 00:21:52,429
<i>Najeneun...</i>

569
00:21:52,447 --> 00:21:54,615
<i>Najeneun ttasaroun...</i>

570
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,099
I mean, seriously?

571
00:21:56,117 --> 00:21:57,434
Dude, it's Korean.

572
00:21:57,452 --> 00:21:58,902
Just sing gibberish. Who cares?

573
00:21:58,936 --> 00:22:00,120
And if you're concentrating

574
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:01,772
on the dance moves,
you're doing it wrong.

575
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,907
(sighs) Well, that's how
I work through everything.

576
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:05,909
I learn the basics, practice
them over and over again,

577
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:07,077
and eventually I get it.

578
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:08,612
So, did you do an apple pie

579
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,280
500 times before you had sex?

580
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:12,115
(laughs)

581
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:14,635
It's exactly what I did,
but I wore a condom

582
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:16,253
so I didn't make
any apple fritters.

583
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:17,621
(laughs) Look.

584
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:20,624
Some things you can't
overthink, okay?

585
00:22:20,642 --> 00:22:22,292
You just got to let
it come natural.

586
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,927
"Gangnam Style" isn't
about technique.

587
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:25,962
It's about just
letting yourself go.

588
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,631
Okay?

592
00:22:36,307 --> 00:22:37,941
I thought you said
you didn't have any moves.

593
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:39,810
(music stops) You asked
me not to take everything

594
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:41,111
from you and I respect that.

595
00:22:41,145 --> 00:22:43,113
Plus, it's kind of embarrassing

596
00:22:43,147 --> 00:22:44,147
that I'm trained in ballet.

597
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:46,417
(laughs)

598
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:48,702
Like, seriously?

599
00:22:48,753 --> 00:22:49,820
Like tutu and everything?

600
00:22:49,838 --> 00:22:51,872
It doesn't leave this room.

601
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:54,208
Dude, you're obviously
better than me.

you should do it.

How about

604
00:22:57,161 --> 00:22:58,829
I just help you get better?

605
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:01,965
Okay.

606
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:03,634
But if at any point
you want to bail,

607
00:23:03,668 --> 00:23:06,670
or get food,
or go get me food...

608
00:23:06,688 --> 00:23:09,523
Let's start by watching
this video one more time.

609
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:13,644
Maybe we'll be
viewer 500 million.

610
00:23:13,678 --> 00:23:15,529
(music plays)

611
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:17,064
There he goes.

612
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:23,920
A bag?

613
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:25,922
Yeah, I'm telling you, you put it
in the bag and it self-bastes.

614
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:27,256
Tommy the turkey

615
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,492
is not gonna go dry.

616
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,210
Ina Garten would never cook
a turkey in a bag.

617
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:33,096
Well, when Ina comes to cook
you Thanksgiving dinner,

618
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,764
she can do as she pleases.

619
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:35,998
But our bird

620
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:37,717
is getting bagged.
Mmm.

621
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:38,885
Guys, this is so great.

622
00:23:38,936 --> 00:23:40,603
Yeah, it's like
our own <i>Big Chill.</i>

623
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:43,389
Yeah, but no one breaks
out into song. What?

624
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,774
Now, Rachel, get over here

625
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:46,008
and help me butter up Tommy.

626
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:47,443
Okay, well, I'm a vegetarian

627
00:23:47,478 --> 00:23:49,896
so I can't eat it but
I guess I can touch it.

628
00:23:49,947 --> 00:23:52,515
Yeah. Okay, Mr. Tur...
I'm very sorry.

629
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:53,516
Like that?

630
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:55,401
You got to get it in there.

631
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:57,520
Really show him
that you love him.

632
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:59,622
You know?
Just like that.

633
00:23:59,656 --> 00:24:02,375
Is that good?
Yeah, like that.

634
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,129
When you two are done
using that turkey

635
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:08,131
as a courtship device,
would you put it in the oven?

636
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:09,749
'Cause it's almost 5:00.

637
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,251
Oh, my God, it's almost time
for sectionals to start.

638
00:24:12,302 --> 00:24:13,469
Why are they having it
on Thanksgiving anyway?

639
00:24:13,504 --> 00:24:14,754
I'm sure they figured
with everyone

640
00:24:14,805 --> 00:24:16,372
home for the holiday,
they would sell more tickets.

641
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,591
Most high schools have football
games for Thanksgiving.

642
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:19,842
I remember my first sectionals.

643
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,310
I was so nervous.

644
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:23,262
I gave myself this pep
talk in the mirror,

645
00:24:23,313 --> 00:24:26,983
and I just began my soulful
monologue by saying...

646
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:28,651
MARLEY:
<i>You are ready for this.</i>

647
00:24:28,685 --> 00:24:31,654
<i>You look really good,</i>
<i>your voice is strong.</i>

648
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:36,225
<i>It's time to make a little</i>
<i>girl's dream come true.</i>

649
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:39,662
<i>I'm so hungry...</i>
<i>but at least</i>

650
00:24:39,696 --> 00:24:42,365
<i>my dress fits.</i>

651
00:24:47,838 --> 00:24:49,738
Wade... I mean,
Unique, you're back!

652
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:52,842
Yes, in all her glory.

653
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:55,511
And as you can see, Miss Marley,
she is ready for her close-up.

654
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:57,346
I thought your parents didn't
want you wearing...

655
00:24:57,381 --> 00:24:58,631
They don't.

656
00:24:58,682 --> 00:25:00,016
They're trying to protect me.

657
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,300
But what they need to understand

658
00:25:01,351 --> 00:25:03,186
is if I'm not being
true to myself at least

659
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,188
when I'm performing,
then there won't be

660
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:07,590
anything left inside
me to protect.

661
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:09,809
So they can keep talking
about sending me to a camp

662
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,644
for little boys who
like to wear dresses,

663
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:14,597
but I will not and I cannot
be ashamed of who I am

664
00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:16,098
or how I look.

665
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:17,366
You look beautiful.

666
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:19,101
I think it's inspiring

667
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,903
how brave and proud you are.

668
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,321
I wish I was more like that.

669
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:23,873
Stop.

670
00:25:23,907 --> 00:25:25,158
Hustle up, you two.

671
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:26,659
You're gonna miss show circle.

672
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,944
And welcome back, girl.

673
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,613
What's show circle?
Come on.

674
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:32,548
It's a tradition
before every competition.

675
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:33,916
It's something Mr. Shue made up.

676
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,885
And today I want to add to it.

677
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,387
Joe, how about
you lead us in prayer?

678
00:25:38,422 --> 00:25:39,455
PUCK:
Whoa, dude, Old Testament.

679
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:41,057
There's Hebrews here.
Yeah, okay.

680
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:43,509
This is one of my favorite
Bible verses from Isaiah.

681
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,228
Considering that the
Warblers are so good,

682
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:47,513
and that it's the first
competition for a lot of you,

683
00:25:47,564 --> 00:25:48,731
I think it's appropriate.

684
00:25:48,765 --> 00:25:52,518
"So do not fear
because I am with you.

685
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:53,686
"Do not be dismayed.

686
00:25:53,737 --> 00:25:55,855
"I will strengthen you,

687
00:25:55,906 --> 00:25:57,857
I will uphold you
with my righteous hand."

688
00:25:57,908 --> 00:26:00,409
And our righteous dance moves, amen.
All right!

689
00:26:00,444 --> 00:26:03,196
(indistinct chatter, applause)

690
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:05,748
Ugh! Man, I-I remember
our first sectionals

691
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:07,366
like it was yesterday.

692
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:10,419
We came together as a
team because we had to.

693
00:26:10,454 --> 00:26:12,705
Because no one
outside our circle

694
00:26:12,756 --> 00:26:14,257
knew how much we'd been through,

695
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:17,293
and how much
it meant to us to win it.

696
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,994
This is our house.

697
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:22,331
Look into the faces
of these graduates.

698
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:24,217
They've been to
the mountaintop.

699
00:26:24,268 --> 00:26:26,802
This is just the first step in
your climb to meet them there.

700
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,004
On three?

701
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,307
ALL:
One, two, three!

702
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:34,810
A... mazing!

703
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:36,445
MAN (over P.A.):
A reminder that

704
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,014
the American Legion Turkey Shoot
begins at 6:00 p.m.

705
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:40,650
So, please, drive carefully.

706
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:41,984
Now, put your hands together

707

panel of judges!

00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:45,738

709
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:47,957
Lima News Obituary Editor,
Stan Cook!

710
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:50,025

711
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:52,128

Locomotive Museum,

715
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:59,868
Defiance County Catfish Queen,

716
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:02,138
(drumroll)

717
00:27:02,172 --> 00:27:05,675
(cheering, whistling)

718
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:11,714
(whispering):
Break a leg.

719
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:14,850
I'm Hunter Clarington, and we're
the Dalton Academy Warblers.

720
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:16,319
Hope you enjoy the show.

KURT:
You okay?

835
00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:53,507
Mm. Yeah. I was having a moment.

836
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:55,459
You know, every year, over,

837
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,128
like, an assortment of pies,
my dads and I would sing

838
00:31:58,179 --> 00:31:59,680
these holiday medleys
by the piano.

839
00:31:59,714 --> 00:32:02,549
And, I don't know, I'm just
starting to feel like maybe

840
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:04,518
that part of my life is over.

841
00:32:04,552 --> 00:32:07,187
Oh, sweetie, as long
as we're in each other's lives,

842
00:32:07,222 --> 00:32:09,022
holiday medleys
will never be over.

843
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:11,058
(whispers):
Promise me?

844
00:32:11,092 --> 00:32:12,693
Okay.
(gasps) How's it going?

845
00:32:12,727 --> 00:32:14,061
Oh, this bird is done. Oh.

846
00:32:14,095 --> 00:32:15,729
Yeah.
(knocking)

847
00:32:15,763 --> 00:32:17,531
All right, Kurt,
do you want to do the honors?

848
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:19,066
No, thanks. I'm not even
having turkey after

849
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,317
the way you guys manhandled it.

850
00:32:21,936 --> 00:32:24,321
Can I help you?

851
00:32:24,372 --> 00:32:26,990
Isabelle Wright invited us
to an Orphan Party here?

852
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:29,209
Oh, right. Uh, yeah, apparently,
we're having a party.

853
00:32:29,244 --> 00:32:31,662
Oh. Okay. Welcome.
Come on in.

854
00:32:31,713 --> 00:32:32,913
KURT:
By the way,

855
00:32:32,947 --> 00:32:34,498
have any of you heard
from Isabelle?

856
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:37,000
I tried calling her earlier,
but I got her voice mail.

857
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:39,419
She was stopping at some new
club opening next to Pyramid

858
00:32:39,453 --> 00:32:40,971
over in the East Village.
(phone buzzing)

859
00:32:41,005 --> 00:32:42,172
Oh, wait. This is her now.

860
00:32:42,223 --> 00:32:44,341
Uh, hello?

861
00:32:44,392 --> 00:32:46,009
Hey, I'm calling you back.

862
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,011
Ooh, she's been a bitch tonight.

863
00:32:48,062 --> 00:32:49,429
(car horn honking)

864
00:32:49,463 --> 00:32:51,231
And by bitch, I mean this rain.

865
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:53,484
No cabs nowhere.

866
00:32:53,518 --> 00:32:57,988
So I had to put on the wig
and the heels and the lashes

867
00:32:58,022 --> 00:33:00,824
and the ear, and take a train

868
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:02,609
to the club.

869
00:33:02,643 --> 00:33:03,944
So I hope you're up, girl,

870
00:33:03,978 --> 00:33:05,863
'cause we are all coming over.

871
00:33:05,914 --> 00:33:08,365
Lock the door, lower the blinds,

872
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:10,701
light up the smoke machine,
and put on your heels,

I love you guys.
Good job.

967
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:41,411
(whispering):
Mr. Shue is here.

968
00:36:41,462 --> 00:36:42,412
(cell phone buzzing) What?

969
00:36:42,463 --> 00:36:44,464
What?
Yes.

970
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:50,921
Hello?

971
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:53,590
Hey.

972
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:55,675
Can you hear me?
It's kind of loud out here.

973
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:58,512
Um, yeah, yeah, I can hear you.

974
00:36:58,546 --> 00:37:00,547
Have you guys performed yet?

975
00:37:01,516 --> 00:37:03,049
Uh, no, not yet.

976
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:06,069
Kurt, I just want you
to know that

977
00:37:06,104 --> 00:37:07,521
no matter...

978
00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:09,172
Just let me talk for a second.

979
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:13,577
Look, you've... you've said
you're sorry a million times.

980
00:37:13,611 --> 00:37:15,412
And...

981
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:16,947
I believe you.

982
00:37:16,998 --> 00:37:20,367
And I'm trying
to forgive you, but...

983
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:23,453
...I'm just not there yet.

984
00:37:23,504 --> 00:37:26,523
But...

985
00:37:26,557 --> 00:37:30,427
it's Thanksgiving,
and it's sectionals, and...

986
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:31,878
I miss you like crazy.

987
00:37:31,912 --> 00:37:35,999
And... I can't stand
not talking to you,

988
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:38,034
even though I'm mad at you.

989
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:40,370
'Cause you're still
my best friend.

990
00:37:41,422 --> 00:37:42,989
You're mine, too.

991
00:37:48,196 --> 00:37:51,148
At Christmas, we... we need to
have a mature heart-to-heart.

992
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,033
And maybe if it's cold enough,

993
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:54,618
we can go ice skating
on the Auglaize River,

994
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:55,952
and get hot chocolate

995
00:37:55,987 --> 00:37:57,287
anywhere but the Lima Bean,

996
00:37:57,321 --> 00:37:58,955
because when I was
working there I saw a mouse.

997
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,740
(laughs)

998
00:38:00,774 --> 00:38:03,477
So, uh, we're really gonna
see each other at Christmas?

999
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:05,445
Yeah.

1000
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:13,587
Well, don't let any of those
hideous Warblers win.

1001
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:15,422
All right?

1002
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:16,640
Break a leg.

1003
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:18,675
Happy Thanksgiving.

1004
00:38:21,062 --> 00:38:22,679
H-happy Thanksgiving.

1005
00:38:24,365 --> 00:38:26,032
Kurt, I love you so much.

1006
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:30,020
I love you, too.

1007
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:32,272
(sniffles, phone beeps)

1008

1009
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:55,762
(music fades)

1010
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:32,337
You okay?

1011
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:33,621
Yeah.

1012
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:35,673
You don't look okay.

1013
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,427
Okay, fine, I'm not okay.

1014
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,463
Look, look...

1015
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,632
It's just nerves.

1016
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:45,717
It's a good thing.
You can use it.

1017
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,769
I don't know how
it's a good thing

1018
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,104
when I haven't slept in days,

1019
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:51,055
and I'm sweating

1020
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,774
when it's not even hot,

1021
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:54,943
and I feel like
if we don't win,

1022
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:56,728
it's going to be all my fault.

1023
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:59,481
I'm going to let
all you guys down.

1024
00:39:59,532 --> 00:40:00,949
Finn, the graduates,
and my mom.

1025
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,150
Jake, you got a second?

1026
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:04,652
Not now. Can it wait?

1027
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:07,739
Not really. I need you
to take the dance lead.

1028
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:09,908
I think I sprained
my ankle during warm-ups.

1029
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:11,826
You're not limping.
What's going on?

1030
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:17,165
Look, it was really cool
what you did,

1031
00:40:17,216 --> 00:40:19,000
but a few days
of rehearsal and practice

1032
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:20,468
doesn't make me as good as you.

1033
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:21,669
And you don't put in

1034
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,304
second-string QB
just to be nice.

1035
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:24,672
Because it's not
nice... the whole team

1036
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:26,758
suffers, and we <i>have</i>
to win this.

1037
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:33,982
Just do it, okay?

1038
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:35,817
(sighs) Yeah.
