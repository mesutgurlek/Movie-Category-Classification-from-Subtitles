Oh, Roger, you haven't
forgotten about the party?

5
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:56,988
No, but I'm afraid I can't make it.

6
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,055
- But you've got to come. You promised.
- The whole crowd's going to be there.

7
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,125
And besides, I've saved
all my Waltzes for you.

8
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,343
We'll make them up next time.

9

It's going to be the
best party of the year.

- Sorry. Good night.
- (women) Good night.

11
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,330
I've gotta run, Aunt Sophie.
Can you get home all right?

12
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,175
Yes, but I did want you
to go to that lovely party.

13
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,181
Good night, dear.
I'll see you first thing in the morning.

14
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,649
- Good night, Professor Heinrich.
- You did very well, my boy.

15
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,655
But your pizzicato -
we still have to work on it.

16
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,624
Remember, as more you press,
as less comes out.

17
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,717
I'll take care of it first
thing in the morning.

Don't overdo yourself, dear.

19
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,095
Why did you have to say that?
His pizzicatos were perfect.

20
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,764
Perhaps, but these young people today,
we have to keep after them all the time.

If he's going to be a great musician...

22

If he's going to be a great musician?
A boy with his talent?

23
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:49,872
Why, do you know where he's gone now?
To work. In the Excelsior bakery.

24
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:54,612
Slaving away half the night in order to
have more time to practice in the daytime.

Well... here I am.

- I don't play, I sing.

Well, if you're so good,
why ain't you up there now?

Well, Lefty got fresh and I quit.
But I know I'll be safe here.

Sure. You'll be safe here.

Sure. Just as safe
as in the crater of a volcano.

- I've got something here that's dynamite.

- The music.

- It's gone!

90
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,741
- But you had it.
- I must have left it on the streetcar.

- What are we gonna do?

- No.

you, you've got another guess coming.

Gee, look at what you've done.
Everything's going along swell

Wait a minute. Let's be reasonable.

00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,290
Reasonable? Say, what do you think
I am? A half-wit or something?

145
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,122
Don't pay attention to him. He didn't mean
it. He was just shooting off his mouth.

146
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,856
Come on back. Let's pretend
it didn't happen. We all need the job.

147
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:22,024
Oh, say, I wouldn't go back there
if it was the last job on earth.

- Let go of me.

Opening tonight, Alexander's Ragtime
Band! The hottest music on the coast!

152
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,316
And the queen of ragtime, Stella Kirby!

153
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,549
With the finest fish dinner in town!

154

You call this an opening?

161
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,337
You should have seen the outfit I was with
the night we opened at the Crystal Palace.

162
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,469
That was an opening.

163
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,846
Hello, Martha? It's Roger.
Listen, I've got to talk to Aunt Sophie.

164
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,385
I'll try. Will you hold the phone, please?

165
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,454
It's Roger again.

166
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,018
I have nothing to say to him.

167

<i>I'm very sorry, Roger.
She won't talk to you.</i>

168
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:10,137
All right. Thank you, Martha.
Good night.

- You, Alexander!
- Yes?

171
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,950
Thank you. Professor Heinrich!

172
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,616
- So your name's Alexander now?
- Yes, that's right.

173
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,184
Uh, won't you come in and...
sit down and have a glass of beer?

174
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,491
Not tonight.

175
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:37,932
I just want to know
if you're really serious about all this.

176
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,867
Oh, yes. Very.

177
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:45,102
But Roger, you spent your whole life
preparing yourself for something fine.

178
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:49,544
How can you throw it all away on this...
this ragtime?

179
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,049
But I like ragtime. I believe in it.

180
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,416
And besides, I have
what I've always wanted: a band.

181
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,319
Won't you stay and listen?
See for yourself.

182
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:03,417
No. You know your own mind.
You always have.

183
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,521
- Good night.
- Good night, Professor.

184
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,258
Hey, come on, come on!
Let's have a little life around here.

185
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,133
- Bring on that girl.
- Right away.

186
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,269
- (Stella) Who is it?
- It's me.

187
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,811
- What do you want?
- I want to see how you look.

188
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,279
Oh, I look swell.

189
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:28,250
- Do you mind if I see for myself?
- No, come on in. What do I care?

190
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,814
It cost me my last dime.

191
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:40,363
- Very nice.
- Oh, thanks, Mr. Astorbilt.

192
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,526
But you know, you shouldn't try to cover
up your lovely throat with those feathers.

193
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,266
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Oh, and look at those flowers.

194
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,332
You don't really need those.
That's just gilding the lily.

195
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,206
Oh-oh.

196
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,872
And look at those ruffles. Now, that might
be all right for some skinny little girl,

197
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,610
but not for a girl
with a gorgeous figure like yours.

198
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,516
- There. Now, see what I mean?
- Hey, wait a minute!

199
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:07,183
Oh, and the very idea
of trying to cover up that beautiful hair!

200
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,352
- There, now.
- Why, you two-by-four snob!

201
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,226
Look what you've done.
You've ruined my dress.

202
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:17,062
Now, listen to me. You're not
dressing for your sailor friends now.

203
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,658
This isn't Dirty Eddie's.

204
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:22,433
I'm trying to build a band with class and
distinction, and I'm beginning right now.

205
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:26,601
Oh, so you're a know-it-all
about women's clothes too?

206
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,440
Well, let me tell you something.

207
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,505
I know how to dress myself and you or
nobody else is gonna tell me what to wear.

208
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:33,743
Understand?!

209
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,686
You're not going up there looking like
a comic valentine. And stop shouting!

210
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,984
I'll go out the way I want to
or I won't go out at all!

211
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,424
- All right! That suits me too.
- Well, it's good enough for me.

212
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,655
Pickleface is throwing a fit out there.
We'd better hop to it.

213
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,789
- Are you ready, Stella?
- I'm not going.

214
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,890
- Oh, now, Stella...
- Oh, let her go, and good riddance.

215
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,992
I don't want a woman with the band
anyway. Come on, Charlie.

216
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,869
Oh, what a sap I was to let you
talk me into this thing in the first place.

217
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,238
Oh, I knew how it would end
with that conceited...

218
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:02,245
Well, I'm surprised at you, letting him get
your goat. He didn't mean anything by it.

219
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,009
He was just a little excited tonight-
new place, a couple of new boys.

220
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,177
- You can't let us down now.
- There you go, sticking up for him again.

221
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,620
Why, look where he threw my flowers.
I should have slapped his ears down.

222
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,851
You can do that tomorrow.
You've gotta sing now.

223
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,258
Pulling out my feathers,
and giving me all that baloney

224
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,796
about my neck and my figure and my hair.

225
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,698
- Why, I'll see him dead first.
- You're absolutely right.

226
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,362
Don't sing for him. Sing for me.

227
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,305
Why, you dirty dog. Taking advantage
of my sweet nature, huh?

228
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,138
(chuckles) That's a girl, Stella.

229
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,269
Just remember the Three Musketeers.
All for one..

230
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,766
Yeah, and that one a pain in the neck.

231

Yeah, and that one a pain in the neck.

- Stop being a stubborn, ornery female.

You and the maestro

And no back talk.

243

Get in there, the both of you.
Take those chips off your shoulders.

244
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:20,975
You're both all right if you don't
expect too much. And remember,

245
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:23,813
I'm staying right outside the door here,
and if I hear any yelling or screaming,

00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:27,617
I'm coming back in here

Well?

248

You and I have
entirely different points of view, Stella.

249
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:49,172
But we are grown-up.

250
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:52,543
I don't see why, with a little
common sense, we can't work together.

251
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:54,445
A simple business arrangement.

252
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:57,417
Listen. You're out to
set the world on fire.

253
00:17:57,474 --> 00:17:59,977
You're all hopped up with the idea
that you've got something to give

254
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:02,023
and you're gonna do it or bust.

255
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:06,720
Well, that's your business. All I want
is a job, and one job's as good as another.

256
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:10,458
As long as I can pay my own way,
and you leave me alone.

257
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,127
You have a great voice.
And a great future too.

258
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,433
If you'd only realize your possibilities
and try to make something of them.

259
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:20,373
Say, I'm doin' all right.
I am what I am,

260
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:25,880
and I'm not gonna let you make me over
into something else just to fit your plans.

261
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:31,978
I guess I have been unreasonable,
only seeing my side of it.

262
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:34,352
But all this means so much to me.

263
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:37,017
This music, having my own band.

264
00:18:38,114 --> 00:18:40,890
Whether we like it or not, we're together.

265
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:43,989
We couldn't have gotten
this job without you,

266
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:46,591
and you probably couldn't have
gotten it without us.

267
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:52,004
So doesn't it seem sensible that we should
try to meet each other halfway?

268
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:54,474
Well, it's all right with me.

Well, now! You see how easy it is.

What do you mean, "changed"?

298
00:22:33,616 --> 00:22:37,223
Just a little hit tune
I've been working on.

- Like it?

- Why, it's great! It's got everything.
- Oh, take it easy.

No, on the level.
Imagine you having that in you.

Why, it'll make you famous.

Oh, it's nothing. Probably won't

I'm afraid I even forgot to take a bow.

Do you suppose we've been in love

Me? In love with that awful person with

- Like Pygmalion.
- Like who?

361
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:23,086
Oh, just a Greek who took a hunk of marble

362
00:30:23,152 --> 00:30:26,133
and molded it and polished it
into a beautiful woman.

363
00:30:26,188 --> 00:30:28,099
Then fell in love with her.

- Hello, Charlie.
- Don't apologize, don't explain.

374
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:09,103
I know all about it.
I was there when it happened.

375
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:11,166
I pour out my heart
in a song to some dame.

376
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:14,077
She takes the song
and pours out her heart to the boss.

377
00:31:14,136 --> 00:31:16,343
Well, I told you it was a good song.
If you hadn't written it,

378
00:31:16,405 --> 00:31:19,011
the little lady and I would have probably
gone on through life slugging each other.

379
00:31:19,074 --> 00:31:21,054
- Well, when's the wedding?
- Don't be so practical.

380

He's just started courting me.

381
00:31:22,912 --> 00:31:26,860
There, go buy me some flowers. The
long-stemmed ones that cost $20 a dozen.

382
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:29,192
- The kind I've never had.
- I will not.

383

Next you'll be wanting a Kodak, and then
a leopard coat, and then a tin Lizzie.

- You'll get ham and eggs, and like it!
- Ham and eggs and champagne.

385
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:38,371
- Champagne for breakfast?
- Certainly. This is a champagne breakfast.

386
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:40,168
- Good morning. Three?
- Please.

387

This way, please.

388
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,614
And while we're guzzling it,
we'll have to do a little figuring.

00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:56,486

- No, who?

This is Mr. Dillingham's secretary.
Who's calling, please?

00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,504
I'm sorry. Mr. Dillingham is busy.

396
00:32:17,566 --> 00:32:19,568
No, he's not granting any interviews.

397
00:32:19,635 --> 00:32:21,706
But this is a very important matter.

398
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,478
My name is Alexander.
I have a very fine band,

399
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,918
and I'm sure Mr. Dillingham
would be interested in...

400
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:28,284
Hello?

401
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:30,679
Hello?

402
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:34,150
Well, that doesn't seem
to be the proper approach.

403
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:36,822
Why don't we go down to the hotel,
grease a few palms?

404
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:39,229
Get everybody talking about
Alexander's Ragtime Band:

405
00:32:39,288 --> 00:32:43,532
the elevator boy, the chambermaid,
the barber. Din it in his ears.

406
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:45,731
Oh, but that would
only make him suspicious.

407
00:32:45,794 --> 00:32:49,435
I'm gonna get him to the Cliff House
if I have to drag him.

You know, those big guys all like to eat.

Stella, you're marvelous.
Uh, Evergreen 2435.

411
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:02,846
I was reading an interview
of his in The Post last week.

412
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:05,824
Uh, hello.
Uh... Mr. Dillingham's suite, please.

413
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:07,881
But you won't be able to
get through the secretary.

414
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:13,730
I got an idea. (French accent) Hello,
may I speak to Mr. Dillingham, please.

415
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:16,793
Well, then, will you
tell him this is Henri?

416
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:19,499
Henri!

417
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:23,304
I was for many years
the chef at the Astor House.

I read he's in town and I would like to fix
for him some baby lobsters a la Henri.

420
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:35,248
- Baby lobsters?
- What's that?

421
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,154
Oh, a chef named Henri wants to
cook some baby lobsters for you.

422
00:33:38,213 --> 00:33:39,123
He was formerly at the Astor.

423
00:33:39,181 --> 00:33:41,923
Baby lobsters in August?

424
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:45,022
Must be first of the season.
Splendid. Find out where he is.

425
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:49,035
Where am I? Where would I be?
Chef at the Cliff House, of course.

426
00:33:50,025 --> 00:33:52,505
Then I can expect him tonight?

- What are you doing here?
- Listen, Ruby. Quick, lend me ten bucks.

448
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:35,562
What did you do with that ten
I gave you last night?

449
00:36:35,624 --> 00:36:38,798
Oh, hurry up, hurry up.
Come on. I'll pay you back.

450
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,672
I'd think you'd be ashamed, taking my
hard-earned money to lose in a crap game.

451
00:36:42,731 --> 00:36:44,870
Say, you oughta be glad
to lend me ten bucks!

452

Suppose war is declared and I gotta
go to the front and get killed in action?

453
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,779
You'd be very happy
to know that you were the one

454
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:51,715
who lent me ten bucks
when I needed it most.

455

Stop. You're breaking my heart.

- Oh.

- Good evening, Mr. Dillingham.
- Good evening.

- Thank you.

- Oh, I know I will.

Henri, your chef, is a

Oh, no, thank you. Thank you.

Mm! Superb. My compliments to Henri.

Take over for me, Charlie.

- He wants me to go to New York!

Oh, darling, isn't that the most wonderful

- Everything you've wanted for me.
- What about the band?

505
00:40:23,452 --> 00:40:27,366
He says he can't use the band right now but
I know he'll find a place for you later.

00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,177
Of course.
This is the biggest chance I'll ever get.

510
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:40,372
Oh, that's swell for you, Stella.

511
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:43,006
She might at least
have talked to me about it first.

512
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:45,847
Not just go and say yes
without even thinking about us.

513
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:49,047
Oh, but Alex, this isn't going to
make any difference with us.

514
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,557
We can still be together.
You can come on to New York with me

515
00:40:52,614 --> 00:40:55,857
and I know Dillingham
will find a place for you before long.

516
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:57,988
Oh, yeah. That'd just be great.

517
00:40:58,053 --> 00:41:02,468
But you told me over and over again that I
could make something of myself if I tried.

518
00:41:02,524 --> 00:41:05,368
And now that it's happened,
you're all burned up.

519
00:41:05,427 --> 00:41:07,600
I should have known better
than to expect anything from you.

520
00:41:07,662 --> 00:41:10,142
Oh, Alec!

521
00:41:10,198 --> 00:41:13,441
Well, of all the selfish
little tinhorn sports.

522
00:41:13,502 --> 00:41:15,914
You're jealous
because he wants me and not you.

523
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:17,382
- Now, Stella...
- Well, just remember,

524
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:20,010
I didn't want to go
with your band in the first place.

525
00:41:20,075 --> 00:41:22,817
And all that polishing and molding -
you weren't doing that for me.

526
00:41:22,878 --> 00:41:24,585
You were doing that for yourself,

527
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:26,648
just because you thought
it would help you get ahead.

528
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:29,195
And now that it's backfired and helped me,
you're yelling murder.

529
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:31,390
- All right. Go on. Get out!
- Alex...

530
00:41:31,453 --> 00:41:35,026
- Go to New York! Go with him!
- Don't think you wouldn't do the same...

531
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,330
Stella!

532
00:41:36,391 --> 00:41:38,098
Alec!

533
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:40,230
Don't leave her like that.

534
00:41:40,295 --> 00:41:42,969
Go back and tell her you're wrong
before it's too late.

535
00:41:43,064 --> 00:41:46,341
Siding in with her again, hey?
I'm wrong and she's right.

536
00:41:46,434 --> 00:41:50,280
Sure. You don't own Stella.
You can't order her around.

537
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:52,818
She has a right to decide for herself.

538
00:41:52,874 --> 00:41:54,979
She doesn't owe this band a thing.

539
00:41:55,043 --> 00:41:57,785
We're liable to be stuck here
for the rest of our lives.

540
00:41:57,846 --> 00:42:00,190
- Is that the way you feel about it?
- Exactly.

541
00:42:00,248 --> 00:42:04,253
Well, then what are you sticking around
for? Why don't you clear out, too?

- Get Captain Davis.
- Yes, sir.

611
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:48,456
Oh, but I've got to see him.
I tell you, it's terribly important.

612
00:49:48,516 --> 00:49:52,987
Well, I'll tell him you're here.
Will you wait out there?

613
00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:04,573
Sergeant, there's a Miss Kirby
at the stage door to see you.

614
00:50:04,632 --> 00:50:06,839
- Who?
- Miss Stella Kirby.

615
00:50:13,741 --> 00:50:15,152
Tell her I'm busy.

616
00:50:15,209 --> 00:50:17,416
- Sergeant Alexander!
- Yes, sir?

617
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:22,088
Assemble your entire company
on stage immediately.

618
00:50:22,149 --> 00:50:25,130
- Yes, sir. Corporal! Everybody on stage.
- Everybody on stage!

619
00:50:25,186 --> 00:50:28,190
Everybody on stage!
Everybody on stage!

- We're not in this act.

You think you ain't.
You're in the Army now.

622
00:50:32,377 --> 00:50:34,425
I said everybody on
stage, and right now.

623

- Everybody on stage, tout de suite.
- Aw, get out. We got 15 minutes.

I wonder what this is all about?

627
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:51,250
Men, we cut the first and second scenes
out of the last act.

628
00:50:51,312 --> 00:50:55,158
Go right into the finale.
Now, there's a change of business, too.

629
00:50:55,216 --> 00:50:58,163
Instead of going down the side aisles
and coming back to center,

630
00:50:58,219 --> 00:51:01,132
boarding the transport on the stage
as we rehearsed it,

631

at the beginning of the second verse,

632
00:51:03,491 --> 00:51:06,472
we march down the center aisle
in a column of twos.

to the docks.

- Overseas?

639
00:51:23,044 --> 00:51:26,651
I can't go now.
I'm coming up for exemption next week.

640
00:51:26,714 --> 00:51:30,628
Well, you just write a nice, long letter
to Uncle Sam and tell him all about it.

641

Oh, shut up.

642
00:51:33,354 --> 00:51:36,597
- This is certainly along intermission.
- Yes, I wonder what's delaying the show?

643
00:51:36,657 --> 00:51:38,500
Program says eight minutes.
More like half an hour.

644
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,732
- Attention!
- Maybe that's it now.

645
00:51:40,795 --> 00:51:42,365
- So long, boys. I'll see you later.
- So long.

646
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,706

Clear the stage. Everybody
except Miss Kirby, clear the stage.

All right, boys.
You can get your picture now.

656
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:34,272
Please give the boys a picture.

657
00:54:34,334 --> 00:54:37,144
How about leaning against the piano,
Miss Kirby?

658
00:54:37,204 --> 00:54:39,514
All right boys, set 'em up.

- You're welcome.

662

- Has anyone a cigarette?
- (man) Will you try one of mine?

663

- Hello, Stella.

664
00:54:58,558 --> 00:55:01,061
- Well, where in the world...
- I saw your name out front.

665
00:55:01,127 --> 00:55:03,903
Thought I'd just drop in and say hello.

666
00:55:03,964 --> 00:55:06,069
When did you get back?

667
00:55:06,132 --> 00:55:08,476
Oh, a couple of days ago.

668
00:55:08,535 --> 00:55:11,778
- Are you all right?
- Sure, sure.

669
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:15,251
- Did you get up to the front?
- Oh, off and on.

670
00:55:15,308 --> 00:55:19,154
But you... you didn't get hit?

671
00:55:19,212 --> 00:55:23,319
Oh, this? No, no.
Just a fad I picked up on the other side.

672
00:55:23,383 --> 00:55:28,389
Without my stick, I'd feel completely
undressed. No, no. I didn't get a scratch.

673
00:55:28,455 --> 00:55:31,231
Oh, it was all so horrible
and useless, wasn't it?

674
00:55:31,925 --> 00:55:35,202
Not altogether. It did me a lot of good.

675
00:55:35,262 --> 00:55:37,503
Made me see what a stupid ass I've been.

676
00:55:37,564 --> 00:55:41,410
Kicked my silly little world
right out from under me.

677
00:55:42,302 --> 00:55:46,079
- Will you forgive me, Stella?
- Why, of course, Alec.

678
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:49,710
- I've never stopped loving you.
- Alec.

Come on. Let's get out of here.
I can't just stand here talking to you.

I've gotta put my arms around you.

Alex, please.

682

You don't know what it's been like,
wanting you every second.

You've never been out of my mind, ever.

684

I don't care what's happened before,

- Know what?

Well, Charlie and I have been married

Say, you fellas put on
a great show over there.

Yeah, that's what the Kaiser thinks.

699
00:56:44,497 --> 00:56:48,206
I got as far as Hoboken
and they called the whole thing off.

700
00:56:48,268 --> 00:56:52,683
Yeah. I see you've done the songs
for Stella's new show.

- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks, but... blame it on Stella.

702
00:56:56,776 --> 00:56:59,120
She cracked the whip.

- No, sorry. I, uh...

out front for me.

other jobs. Then where'll we be?

01:00:25,685 --> 01:00:27,323
That's right.

748
01:00:27,387 --> 01:00:31,631
Well, anyway, it's swell music. It sure has
changed, though. It's got a new rhythm.

749
01:00:31,691 --> 01:00:34,331
- Nice and slow.
- Yeah, like syrup.

750
01:00:34,394 --> 01:00:38,035
- And it's sweet and sticky.
- What do you do with a guy like that?

751
01:00:38,097 --> 01:00:40,509
Oh, just relax
and put your mind on your drinking.

752
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:43,446
Stop trying to maneuver him
into talking business.

753
01:00:43,503 --> 01:00:45,346
Business? What's that?

754
01:00:45,405 --> 01:00:48,818
You know, the thing you do
to take your mind off your drinking.

755
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:52,379
- Come on, Alex. Doesn't that adjust you?
- Sorry.

756
01:00:52,445 --> 01:00:54,686
- Would a dance adjust you?
- Sorry.

757
01:00:54,747 --> 01:00:56,749
Don't mention it.

758
01:00:56,816 --> 01:00:58,256
<i>(♪ "A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody')</i>

759
01:01:45,965 --> 01:01:48,775
<i>Good evening, Mr. Buyer. Mrs. Buyer.</i>

760
01:01:57,844 --> 01:02:00,518
- Isn't that Bill?
- Looks like him.

761
01:02:01,781 --> 01:02:04,057
<i>- (Charlie) Bill!
- (Stella) Bill!</i>

762
01:02:04,117 --> 01:02:08,725
- (Stella) My goodness! And he's a father!
- What do you know about this!

763
01:02:08,788 --> 01:02:10,859
Say, what are you doing in New York?

764
01:02:10,924 --> 01:02:14,337
- And outwith a baby this time of night.
- Oh, nothing.

765
01:02:14,394 --> 01:02:18,171
Say, how are you folks getting along?
You look fine.

766
01:02:18,231 --> 01:02:21,075
Well, the same to you, Bill.
Let's have a look at him.

767
01:02:21,134 --> 01:02:23,136
- Might be a her.
- Oh, not Bill.

768
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:26,615
- He wouldn't have any feminine offspring.
- I don't think it's much to look at.

769
01:02:26,673 --> 01:02:29,654
"It"?
Why, I bet she looks just like her...

770
01:02:33,313 --> 01:02:37,193
Oh, why, Bill, it's the image of you!

771
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:40,424
- How old is it?
- Well, there ain't no way of telling that.

772
01:02:40,486 --> 01:02:42,727
- Imported?
- Yeah. All the way from Hoboken.

773
01:02:42,789 --> 01:02:46,293
Right off the boat. Probably scraped off.

774
01:02:48,895 --> 01:02:51,398
You folks have sure been doing fine,
haven't you?

775
01:02:51,464 --> 01:02:53,466
I caught your show, Stella.

776
01:02:53,533 --> 01:02:56,173
You've come a long way.
Right up on top.

777
01:02:56,235 --> 01:02:58,909
- And your music's all right, too.
- Thanks, Bill.

778
01:02:58,972 --> 01:03:03,114
Don't forget, Bill. You had a hand
in all this, way back in the beginning.

779
01:03:03,176 --> 01:03:06,385
Say, it's funny, ain't it.
You and Charlie over on Broadway

780
01:03:06,446 --> 01:03:08,926
and me and Alec
down in Greenwich Village.

781
01:03:08,982 --> 01:03:11,019
- Alec in the Village?
- Sure! Him and Davey.

782
01:03:11,084 --> 01:03:12,791
They got a swell band down at Scarbi's.

783
01:03:12,852 --> 01:03:15,389
I got 'em the job. Run across them
once when they was broke.

784
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:19,631
Come on down sometime when you think about
it. Ask for me. I'm there every night.

785
01:03:20,093 --> 01:03:22,039
"Bill Mulligan, interior decorator."

786
01:03:22,095 --> 01:03:23,972
<i>(laughter)</i>

787
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:26,840
- My <i>nom de plume.</i>
<i>- (laughter)</i>

788
01:03:26,899 --> 01:03:31,041
Anytime you feel like you'd like
to play with the baby, just give me a call.

789
01:03:31,104 --> 01:03:34,051
- I can be over in about 15 minutes.
- All right, Bill.

790
01:03:34,107 --> 01:03:37,088
- We certainly will. Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

791
01:03:37,143 --> 01:03:39,248
- Been grand seeing you, Bill.
- Likewise.

792
01:03:39,312 --> 01:03:41,690
Take care of yourself. Goodbye.

793
01:03:50,356 --> 01:03:53,098
Imagine Bill in New York.

794
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:55,139
And bootlegging.

795
01:03:55,194 --> 01:03:58,801
He's probably making plenty of money at it.

796
01:03:58,931 --> 01:04:01,468
It's kinda funny at that.

797
01:04:01,534 --> 01:04:06,279
Him and Alec and Davey together again,
down in the Village.

798
01:04:07,173 --> 01:04:09,483
I thought they were
going back to San Francisco.

799
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:11,544
So did I.

800
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:17,086
<i>(♪ Plays several chords)</i>

801
01:04:21,754 --> 01:04:27,261
What do you say we drop down and see
them sometime, just for old times' sake?

802
01:04:27,326 --> 01:04:29,328
Oh, I'd rather not.

803
01:04:29,996 --> 01:04:33,773
Those old times are over and... there's
no use trying to rake them up again.

804
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,710
It never works.

805
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,712
Would you like a highball?

806
01:04:43,776 --> 01:04:45,722
No, just some milk.

807
01:04:46,579 --> 01:04:48,923
All right, I'll get it.

808
01:05:18,811 --> 01:05:20,848
Here you are.

809
01:05:20,913 --> 01:05:24,451
Oh, this is fine.
Make me sleep like a baby.

810
01:05:24,517 --> 01:05:26,963
So will this, if you drink enough of it.

811
01:05:31,224 --> 01:05:33,226
Tired?

812
01:05:34,227 --> 01:05:38,607
- I'm all right.
- Come on, Charlie. What is it?

813
01:05:40,633 --> 01:05:45,173
Well... I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately.

814
01:05:45,238 --> 01:05:49,380
Making up a lot of pretty speeches
about marriage, life and fate.

815
01:05:49,442 --> 01:05:51,649
Very profound stuff.

816
01:05:51,711 --> 01:05:57,684
But it all seems kinda silly now that
I'm sitting here talking to you like this.

817
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:02,597
Somehow doesn't go with you.
You're too honest and direct.

818
01:06:03,489 --> 01:06:05,435
Come on. Out with it.

819
01:06:08,127 --> 01:06:10,129
All right.

820
01:06:12,698 --> 01:06:14,700
Here goes.

821
01:06:16,536 --> 01:06:19,949
What do you say we call this marriage off?

822
01:06:23,342 --> 01:06:27,188
- Charlie!
- Mark it up as... experience.

823
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,323
A grand adventure while it lasted.

824
01:06:31,384 --> 01:06:37,357
But let's not spoil it by beginning to
pretend a lot of things we don't feel.

825
01:06:40,526 --> 01:06:43,996
You're still in love with Alec, aren't you?

826
01:06:45,097 --> 01:06:47,099
Oh, I suppose so.

827
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:50,245
I thought I was over it, but...

828
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:54,374
Oh, I don't know. I guess you
can't turn those things off and on.

829
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,442
No. Course not.

830
01:06:58,344 --> 01:07:00,346
That's what I'm getting at.

831
01:07:00,413 --> 01:07:03,451
- Oh, but Charlie...
- No buts about it.

832
01:07:03,516 --> 01:07:06,690
I'm a lucky guy
to have had you as long as I have.

833
01:07:06,752 --> 01:07:09,824
I'm grateful for every minute of it.

834
01:07:09,889 --> 01:07:11,891
But I want you to be happy.

835
01:07:16,062 --> 01:07:18,064
Now, now, now, now.

836
01:07:21,567 --> 01:07:24,571
Don't go feminine all of a sudden.

837
01:07:24,637 --> 01:07:27,049
Just keep your mind clear.

838
01:07:27,106 --> 01:07:30,019
Go get a nice, quick, cheap divorce.

839
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:34,091
I'll make the alimony light on you.

840
01:07:34,146 --> 01:07:37,855
And if you need any witnesses,
I can arrange that, too.

841
01:07:37,917 --> 01:07:41,956
And you two hotheads
can pick up where you left off.

842
01:07:47,994 --> 01:07:50,770
You haven't left me with a word to say.

843
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:54,835
That's good.
People talk too much anyhow.

844
01:07:55,868 --> 01:07:59,611
Now will you change your mind
about that highball?

845
01:07:59,672 --> 01:08:01,618
Yes, I will.

846
01:08:03,709 --> 01:08:05,950
And a great, big one.

847
01:08:24,429 --> 01:08:26,431
<i>(♪ Swing)</i>

- Hey, Stella!
- Bill!

849
01:08:30,902 --> 01:08:33,348
What do you know about this?
I've been wishing you would show up.

850
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:35,112
This makes it unanimous.

851
01:08:35,173 --> 01:08:39,087
- Hey, you look positively handsome.
- I'm dressed up for the party.

852
01:08:39,144 --> 01:08:41,988
- Party?
- Sure. Come on!

853
01:08:46,752 --> 01:08:49,289
- Stella!
- Davey!

854

Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

855
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:55,397
Boy, are you terrific! You look like
you were born on Fifth Avenue.

856
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:58,498
You look pretty swell yourself.
How've you been, anyhow?

857
01:08:58,563 --> 01:09:01,373
Never better. And where's
that old son of a gun Charlie?

858
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:04,414
- I ain't seen him in years and years.
- He's out of town.

859
01:09:04,469 --> 01:09:07,882
Oh, that's a shame. He's the only one
of the old gang that's not here.

860
01:09:07,939 --> 01:09:10,920
Well, come on! This calls for a drink.

861
01:09:11,576 --> 01:09:14,056
Attention, everybody!

862
01:09:14,112 --> 01:09:17,093
Our own personal gift to Broadway,
Stella Kirby.

863
01:09:17,149 --> 01:09:19,390
It's like old home week, isn't it, maestro?

864
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:22,193
Just in time for the celebration.
Won't you sit down?

865
01:09:22,254 --> 01:09:24,359
- Uh, Miss Allen, Mrs. Dwyer.
- How do you do?

866
01:09:24,423 --> 01:09:26,369
- How's Charlie, Stella?
- Oh, fine, thanks.

867
01:09:26,425 --> 01:09:27,426
That's good.

868
01:09:27,492 --> 01:09:29,768
- Stella Kirby!
- Hello, Stella.

869
01:09:29,828 --> 01:09:33,332
- Oh, don't you look elegant!
- Oh, thanks, Ruby.

870
01:09:33,398 --> 01:09:35,241
Yeah, Stell, she hooked me at last.

871
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:39,715
I like that! After the way you ran after me
begging me to marry you!

872
01:09:39,771 --> 01:09:41,808
- You two are married?
- Uh-huh!

873
01:09:41,873 --> 01:09:45,514
Ah, that's what the celebration was for!
Oh, congratulations.

874
01:09:45,577 --> 01:09:47,823
That's not the only thing
we're celebrating.

875
01:09:47,848 --> 01:09:49,743
We're all leaving
for Europe tonight.

876
01:09:49,781 --> 01:09:52,557
We're going to Paris and London
and everywhere.

877
01:09:52,617 --> 01:09:55,996
Yeah, we're just getting ready
to get poured on the boat.

878
01:09:56,054 --> 01:09:58,056
- You're leaving for Europe?
- Yep.

879
01:09:58,123 --> 01:10:00,729
One of those horseshoes finally hit us
and we landed a contract.

880
01:10:00,792 --> 01:10:03,671
Oh, that's wonderful.
But it's rather sudden, isn't it?

881
01:10:03,729 --> 01:10:07,040
Well, they needed an American jazz band
in a hurry, and we were just lucky.

882
01:10:07,099 --> 01:10:11,138
Oh, lucky nothing!
Why, he's got the hottest band in town.

883
01:10:11,203 --> 01:10:13,205
And you should hear her sing.

884
01:10:13,872 --> 01:10:16,148
- You're with the band?
- Yes, I am.

885
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:19,849
- She took your place. Didn't she, Alec?
- Oh, Jerry's great. One of the best.

886
01:10:19,911 --> 01:10:22,949
Yeah, we wanted to make it
a double wedding yesterday,

887
01:10:23,014 --> 01:10:27,156
but Alec was too busy seeing about
passports. (hiccups) Weren't you, Alec?

888
01:10:27,652 --> 01:10:30,997
We almost called the trip off after
we got a look at our passport pictures.

889
01:10:31,056 --> 01:10:33,730
The boys look like gangsters
and I look like a washed-out moll.

890
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:36,898
Say, a couple of friends of mine from
the press want you to give 'em a story

891
01:10:36,962 --> 01:10:39,033
about Alexander's Ragtime Band.

892
01:10:39,097 --> 01:10:41,771
Oh, it'll only take you a minute.
They're just sitting right over there

893
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:44,245
and it'll be good publicity for the speak.

894
01:10:44,302 --> 01:10:45,576
Sure. All right.

895
01:10:45,637 --> 01:10:47,583
Will you excuse me?

896
01:10:47,639 --> 01:10:50,643
You better hurry and get your drinking
done. We got less than an hour.

897
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:53,383
Yeah, hurry up, everybody.

898
01:10:54,279 --> 01:10:56,623
- Sorry I missed hearing you sing.
- Thank you.

899
01:10:56,681 --> 01:10:58,854
I enjoyed your show very much.

900
01:10:58,917 --> 01:11:01,625
- How long have you been with the band?
- Ever since they started.

901
01:11:01,686 --> 01:11:03,688
In fact, I was one of the charter members.

902
01:11:03,755 --> 01:11:06,668
Then you must have met Alex
soon after he came back from the war.

903
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:09,729
Yes. He was still in
somewhat of a daze from it.

904
01:11:09,795 --> 01:11:12,332
I stepped in
and sort of helped him snap out of it.

905
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:15,469
- That was very fortunate for him.
- Yeah, and for me too.

906
01:11:15,534 --> 01:11:19,539
Let me tell you something, Stella.
There's one swell girl.

907
01:11:19,604 --> 01:11:22,312
Why, everything Alec is now,
he owes to her.

908
01:11:22,374 --> 01:11:25,821
You know how Alec is. Moody and funny.

909
01:11:25,877 --> 01:11:28,824
And when he found out
that you and Charlie were married,

910
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,884
well, after all,
that was kind of a sock on the nose.

911
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:36,365
Why, if it hadn't been for Jerry, he might
have turned into a no-good tramp.

912
01:11:36,421 --> 01:11:38,458
But she caught him just in time.

913
01:11:38,523 --> 01:11:40,696
And now look at him!
On his way to Paris!

914
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:42,568
Compliments of the party
over in the corner.

915
01:11:42,627 --> 01:11:44,868
They wanna know
if you'll sing a little song for them.

916
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:48,742
- You know that one you did Sunday night?
- I'm on a vacation.

917
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,474
They're big spenders.
They're sure gonna be disappointed.

918
01:11:51,536 --> 01:11:56,417
- Sorry. Not tonight.
- Oh, please do. I'd love to hear you.

919
01:11:56,474 --> 01:11:58,920
- All right, Bill.
- Thanks.

920
01:12:00,278 --> 01:12:03,623
All right, hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
Get "Blue Skies" ready.

921
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:06,823
Ladies and gentlemen!

922
01:12:06,885 --> 01:12:10,765
This little lady, before leaving
for Paris, France and abroad tonight,

923
01:12:10,822 --> 01:12:13,098
is going to favor us
with a beautiful ballad

924
01:12:13,158 --> 01:12:15,502
one that I know that
you'll all enjoy as much as I have.

925
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,665
And that's saying a lot
'cause I've heard 'em all.

926
01:12:17,829 --> 01:12:23,404
So here goes, folks! The one and only,
the tops, Miss Jerry Allen!

927
01:12:28,607 --> 01:12:30,484
<i>(♪ "Blue Skies")</i>

928
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:38,517
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a great celebrity with us here tonight.

929
01:13:38,576 --> 01:13:40,283
I want you all to meet her.

930
01:13:40,345 --> 01:13:42,586
Miss Stella Kirby!

931
01:13:42,647 --> 01:13:45,150
(man) Sing!
Come on, Stella, sing!

932
01:13:48,086 --> 01:13:50,589
- Come on, Stella.
- (♪ reprise)

933
01:13:50,655 --> 01:13:53,192
Come on, come on!

934
01:14:04,135 --> 01:14:06,137
<i>(♪ "Blue Skies")</i>

935
01:14:23,621 --> 01:14:26,363
Come on, everybody sing!

936
01:15:25,316 --> 01:15:28,320

<i>(knock at door)</i>

939
01:16:57,942 --> 01:16:59,683
Sorry to keep you waiting, Stella.

940
01:16:59,744 --> 01:17:02,918
Mac, I'm leaving the show.

941
01:17:02,981 --> 01:17:06,485
- You're what?
- I can't continue on.

942
01:17:09,554 --> 01:17:12,194
You're tired.
You've been on the road for ten weeks.

943
01:17:12,257 --> 01:17:15,033
But you're in Chicago now.
We should have along run.

944
01:17:15,093 --> 01:17:17,164
In another week,
you'll feel like a new person.

945
01:17:17,228 --> 01:17:19,230
Oh, no. It's more than that.

946
01:17:19,297 --> 01:17:22,767
I'm only messing things up
and ruining the show.

947
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:25,280
I just can't stay on, I tell you.

948
01:17:25,336 --> 01:17:27,873
But Mr. Dillingham
has great plans for you, Stella.

949
01:17:27,939 --> 01:17:30,476
You can't throw opportunities
away like this.

950
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:33,580
I'm an old hand at throwing things away.

951
01:17:33,645 --> 01:17:37,183
Stella, this is something
that I can't decide.

952
01:17:37,248 --> 01:17:41,196
Mr. Dillingham will have to do that.
You wait here.

953
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:44,289
I'm going to get him.

954
01:17:45,256 --> 01:17:47,532
<i>(chorus outside sings "My Walking Stick")</i>

955
01:18:56,527 --> 01:18:59,064
<i>(♪ women scat)</i>

01:20:10,267 --> 01:20:12,406
<i>(♪ "Remember")?</i>

957
01:21:19,069 --> 01:21:21,174
<i>(♪ "Everybody Step")</i>

958
01:23:16,486 --> 01:23:18,466
Gesundheit. I'm gonna take you home,

959
01:23:18,522 --> 01:23:21,867
put your feet in mustard water
and give you a good dose of castor oil.

960
01:23:21,925 --> 01:23:23,029
Over my dead body.

961
01:23:23,093 --> 01:23:25,403
I knew you were crazy
wanting to walk in this rain.

962
01:23:25,462 --> 01:23:29,774
Come on, get out of the wet.
There'll be a taxi along in a minute.

963
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:32,643
Someday I'm gonna
take a good sock at you.

964
01:23:32,702 --> 01:23:35,114
Go ahead. Right on the button.

965
01:23:38,074 --> 01:23:40,111
Jerry.

966
01:23:40,177 --> 01:23:42,248
Let's get married.

967
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:45,751
Have you got a fever?
You sound delirious.

968
01:23:45,815 --> 01:23:48,955
No, I mean it. Now, tonight.

969
01:23:49,019 --> 01:23:52,728
Oh, no, thanks.
You really don't wanna marry me.

970
01:23:52,789 --> 01:23:56,464
You're just trying to
avoid the bachelor tax.

971
01:23:59,963 --> 01:24:03,968
- Don't you think we'd hit it off together?
- Course. We always have.

972
01:24:04,034 --> 01:24:07,379
- Then why not?
- Because you're not in love with me, Alex.

973
01:24:07,437 --> 01:24:09,974
I used to think you might be, someday.

974
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,646
But I was wrong.

975
01:24:12,709 --> 01:24:16,213
- You mean an awful lot to me, Jerry.
- I know I do.

976
01:24:16,279 --> 01:24:19,192
But that's not enough to marry on.

977
01:24:19,249 --> 01:24:22,059
Oh, I'm not complaining
and I'm not asking for a thing.

978
01:24:22,118 --> 01:24:24,189
When this is over, it'll be over.

979
01:24:24,254 --> 01:24:28,293
There'll be no weeping at the bar,
as far as I'm concerned.

980
01:24:28,358 --> 01:24:30,360
Just remember that.

981
01:24:31,628 --> 01:24:33,904
You think much too straight for me, Jerry.

982
01:24:33,964 --> 01:24:36,103
Like the rest of you modern, clever women.

983
01:24:36,166 --> 01:24:40,046
Come on, here comes a cab. You can't talk
yourself out of taking that castor oil.

984
01:24:49,579 --> 01:24:52,992
Oh, Mr. Alexander!
May I have your autograph?

985
01:24:53,049 --> 01:24:55,051
Certainly.

986
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:59,525
It's a shame to bother you like this.

987
01:24:59,589 --> 01:25:01,899
It'd bother me a lot more if you didn't.

988
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:04,632
- Mine too, please.
- Thank you.

989
01:25:08,331 --> 01:25:12,177
Pardon me, Mr. Alexander, but we're ready
when you are for the audition in room B.

990
01:25:12,235 --> 01:25:13,976
Thank you. I'll be right along.

991
01:25:14,037 --> 01:25:16,039
- Whose is this?
- Mine.

992
01:25:18,575 --> 01:25:21,556
<i>(sings comedic tune)</i>

993
01:25:29,786 --> 01:25:31,561
That's swell. Good comedy, boys.

994
01:25:31,621 --> 01:25:34,625
- But I want a ballad for Miss Allen.
- We've got a million of them.

995
01:25:34,691 --> 01:25:37,365
We'll be back tomorrow with a ballad
that'll tear your heart out.

996
01:25:37,427 --> 01:25:39,429
- Thanks very much, boys. So long.
- Thank you.

997
01:25:39,496 --> 01:25:40,839
Thank you. Goodbye.

998
01:25:42,666 --> 01:25:44,839
Will you come in, please?

999
01:25:49,806 --> 01:25:53,276
Well, Charlie. You old son of a gun.

1000
01:25:53,343 --> 01:25:57,553
- Hello, Alec.
- Say, this is great. How are you, anyhow?

1001
01:25:57,614 --> 01:26:00,823
- Fine. Fine. And you?
- Swell.

1002
01:26:00,884 --> 01:26:02,886
Come on. Sit down.

1003
01:26:04,087 --> 01:26:07,432
Gosh, I've been reading plenty about you.

1004
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:09,561
You must have had all Europe
for a press agent.

1005
01:26:09,626 --> 01:26:12,436
Oh, they just happen to like
American music over there.

1006
01:26:12,495 --> 01:26:16,033
Don't try to kid me.
I've heard you on the radio.

1007
01:26:16,099 --> 01:26:18,636
Good old Charlie.
How are they going, anyway?

1008
01:26:18,702 --> 01:26:21,444
Oh, fine. Still pounding them out.

1009
01:26:21,504 --> 01:26:24,451
As long as "moon" rhymes with "June,"
I'm OK.

1010
01:26:24,507 --> 01:26:26,851
- I guess we're both pretty lucky.
- Yeah.

1011
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:30,483
At least we didn't have to go back
to Dirty Eddie's.

1012
01:26:30,547 --> 01:26:34,586
Say, remember the night you played the
concert on Nob Hill and I lost the music?

1013
01:26:34,651 --> 01:26:37,962
That was a great night.
Will you wait a few minutes?

1014
01:26:38,021 --> 01:26:41,730
I wanna talk to you but I got some people
waitin' outside for audition.

1015
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:43,793
- You're auditioning?
- Yeah.

1016
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:47,467
Then I guess you're the fella I'm supposed
to see. I'm one of that few that's waiting.

1017
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:49,635
- Next on the list, too.
- You?

1018
01:26:49,699 --> 01:26:53,340
Sure. I got a couple of ballads.
One of 'em's pretty good.

1019
01:26:53,403 --> 01:26:55,713
- Oh, great. Let's hear 'em.
- OK.

1020
01:26:58,308 --> 01:27:00,686
Ah, gee, I'm glad to see you, Charlie.

1021
01:27:00,744 --> 01:27:03,486
Don't think I'm not glad to see you.

1022
01:27:04,347 --> 01:27:07,556
- How's Stella?
- I don't know.

1023
01:27:07,617 --> 01:27:12,157
- What?
- I haven't heard from her in a long time.

1024
01:27:12,222 --> 01:27:15,431
She left town right after our divorce.

1025
01:27:15,492 --> 01:27:18,996
Divorce? You and Stella divorced?

1026
01:27:20,697 --> 01:27:22,608
Well, sure.

1027
01:27:22,665 --> 01:27:25,407
It just didn't... didn't pan out.

1028
01:27:27,404 --> 01:27:30,510
I... I knew she wasn't
in show business anymore, but...

1029
01:27:30,573 --> 01:27:35,488
I thought maybe you and she were leading a
quiet life somewhere and raising a family.

1030
01:27:35,545 --> 01:27:37,650
No. Not Stella.

1031
01:27:39,249 --> 01:27:41,286
You know how selfish she is.

1032
01:27:41,351 --> 01:27:45,959
How unreasonable. What
a double-crossing two-timer she can be.

1033
01:27:46,022 --> 01:27:47,399
Now, wait a minute!

1034
01:27:47,457 --> 01:27:50,529
Stella's the swellest girl I ever knew.
She never two-timed anybody.

1035
01:27:50,593 --> 01:27:53,733
- So you're still in love with her, huh?
- Well, what of it?

1036
01:27:53,797 --> 01:27:55,799
That's all I wanted to know.

1037
01:27:55,865 --> 01:27:58,846
Because she's still in love with you.

1038
01:28:08,611 --> 01:28:10,613
Same old Charlie.

1039
01:28:12,482 --> 01:28:14,587
And you're the same old hothead.

1040
01:28:14,651 --> 01:28:17,530
You were gonna sock me, weren't you?

1041
01:28:17,587 --> 01:28:20,431
You don't know how close you came
to having your ears slapped down.

1042
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:23,664
Seems to me I've heard those words
before somewhere.

1043
01:28:23,726 --> 01:28:27,674
Well, what are we standing here
waiting for? Let's go find her.

1044
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:29,732
I'm sorry I can't help you.

1045
01:28:29,799 --> 01:28:34,544
Miss Kirby left the show in Chicago
and I haven't heard anything of her since.

1046
01:28:34,604 --> 01:28:37,448
- Thanks. Thanks very much.
- Why don't you try Equity?

1047
01:28:37,507 --> 01:28:40,511
- They'll know where she is.
- Thanks very much.

1048
01:28:40,577 --> 01:28:43,251
Mr. Alexander,
Mr. Dillingham would like to talk to you.

1049
01:28:43,313 --> 01:28:45,315
He has a place for you in his new show.

1050
01:28:45,381 --> 01:28:49,420
I'm sorry. I haven't any open time
right now. Perhaps later. Goodbye.

1051
01:29:05,668 --> 01:29:08,114
Tickets, please.

1052
01:29:08,171 --> 01:29:10,447
Have your tickets ready, please.

1053
01:29:35,331 --> 01:29:37,971
- Yes, Miss?
- Does Bill work here anymore?

1054
01:29:38,034 --> 01:29:43,211
- Bill? Bill who?
- Bill. Used to be sort of a manager.

1055
01:29:43,273 --> 01:29:45,014
- Oh, you mean Bill Mulligan?
- Yes.

1056
01:29:45,074 --> 01:29:48,055
- Why, he owns the place.
- He does?

1057
01:29:48,111 --> 01:29:53,117
- Could I see him, please?
- Just wait over there. I'll call him.

1058

Bill.

1060
01:30:09,465 --> 01:30:12,275
Oh, you look positively handsome.

1061
01:30:12,902 --> 01:30:16,577
- Where have you been?
- Oh. Around.

1062
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:19,279
I've been seeing the country.

1063
01:30:19,342 --> 01:30:21,549
And a very big country it is, too.

1064
01:30:21,611 --> 01:30:24,421
- What have you been doing?
- Singing.

1065
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,757
Cabarets and cafés. Anyplace.

1066
01:30:27,817 --> 01:30:30,423
You, Stella Kirby, singing in cabarets?

1067
01:30:30,486 --> 01:30:35,299
No. Lilly Lamont.
I changed my name to fit the personality.

1068
01:30:35,358 --> 01:30:39,602
When I see some of these phonies
making good today and think of you...

1069
01:30:39,662 --> 01:30:42,643
Joe, bring us a bottle of champagne.

1070
01:30:42,699 --> 01:30:45,025
No, thanks. I feel
more at home with beer.

1071
01:30:45,050 --> 01:30:46,671
Just for old times' sake.

1072
01:30:46,703 --> 01:30:49,616
- Seen Alec?
- No, I haven't.

1073
01:30:49,672 --> 01:30:52,744
- But you're going to his concert?
- I don't think so.

1074
01:30:52,809 --> 01:30:56,256
He'd be the happiest man in the world if
he thought you was out in that audience.

1075
01:30:56,312 --> 01:30:58,849
He's looked everywhere for you.

1076
01:30:58,915 --> 01:31:02,158
- Just let him think of me as I was.
- Oh, that's silly.

1077
01:31:02,218 --> 01:31:04,755
You're going to that concert with me.
I got a box.

1078
01:31:04,821 --> 01:31:08,826
No, I'm just killing time
until my train leaves tonight.

1079
01:31:08,891 --> 01:31:10,700
- Will you have dinner with me?
- Sure.

1080
01:31:10,827 --> 01:31:13,239
Good. I got something to do,
it'll take me about 20 minutes.

1081
01:31:13,296 --> 01:31:16,675
I'll come back, and you and I will listen
to the concert here, on the radio.

1082
01:31:16,733 --> 01:31:19,509
- All right, Bill.
- Save mine.

1083
01:31:23,239 --> 01:31:27,016
- Wish me luck, Aunt Sophie.
- Roger, there's nothing to be afraid of.

1084
01:31:27,076 --> 01:31:29,147
This is something
you've been doing all your life.

1085
01:31:29,212 --> 01:31:30,714
Something you believe in.

1086
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:35,354
Just think how proud Professor Heinrich
and I are of you, darling.

1087
01:31:35,418 --> 01:31:37,420
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

- He'll be here in a minute.

1090
01:31:45,895 --> 01:31:47,772
- Here he is.
- Well, here we are.

1091
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:52,301
- It's just like Dirty Eddie's.
- Except the customers have clean collars.

1092
01:31:52,368 --> 01:31:55,178
- Well, maestro. It's your night.
- Our night.

1093
01:31:55,238 --> 01:31:56,842
The Three Musketeers.

1094
01:31:56,906 --> 01:32:01,582
We fellas better get out there.
And don't forget to be good.

- Ruby! Stella's back!
- Stella? Where?

1098
01:33:29,665 --> 01:33:31,406
- She's over at my place.
- Well, why didn't you bring her?

1099
01:33:31,467 --> 01:33:33,276
Don't argue! Now, listen.

1100
01:33:33,336 --> 01:33:36,681
When this concert's over, get a hold of Alec
and tell him to beat it down to my place.

1101
01:33:36,739 --> 01:33:39,307
- I'll hold her there.
- All right.

1102
01:33:39,308 --> 01:33:39,342
- I'll hold her there.
- All right.

1103

When Bill... I mean Mr. Mulligan comes
back, would you tell him I couldn't wait?

1104
01:33:44,579 --> 01:33:47,150
Why, uh... Yes, I'll tell him.

I guess so.

01:34:16,645 --> 01:34:19,353
- Where to?
- Anyplace.

1110
01:34:20,515 --> 01:34:23,985
- Just wanna go riding, eh?
- That's right.

1111
01:34:26,054 --> 01:34:29,467
- How about the park?
- Doesn't matter.

1112
01:34:32,127 --> 01:34:34,767
Would you like some music?

1113

(♪ "Cheek to Cheek')

1114
01:34:40,502 --> 01:34:43,381
- Where's that coming from?
- Carnegie Hall.

01:34:43,438 --> 01:34:45,975
Alexander's Ragtime Band.

1116
01:34:46,174 --> 01:34:48,484
Sure can swing it, can't he?

1117
01:34:50,379 --> 01:34:52,484
You want me to turn it off?

1118
01:34:52,547 --> 01:34:54,549
Oh, no!

1123
01:36:44,392 --> 01:36:46,599
Sort of springlike.

- Are we still in the park?
- We're just turning into 59th Street.

Nice just cruising around.

You take most fares, always in a hurry,
always wanna get someplace.

- No.

Swell music.

1130
01:37:16,591 --> 01:37:19,834
That's where it comes from.
That's Carnegie Hall right there.

1131
01:37:19,895 --> 01:37:22,000
But I didn't ask to go to Carnegie Hall!

1132
01:37:22,063 --> 01:37:26,534
I know, but we gotta get out of the park
some way and this is where we landed.

1133

(Stella) Driver, stop here.
I think I'll get out and walk.

You bet. Nice night for walking.

1135
01:37:45,086 --> 01:37:47,088
How much?

1136
01:37:47,822 --> 01:37:50,302
- One dollar.
- Is that all? Haven't we...

1137
01:37:50,358 --> 01:37:53,430
One dollar even. No more, no less.

- Thank you.
- Night.

1139

- One, please. In the balcony.
- Sorry, miss. The house is sold out.

1140
01:38:16,618 --> 01:38:20,065
- Then I'll stand.
- No standing room left either.

- Who's gone?

1143
01:38:29,898 --> 01:38:31,878
Stella. When I got back
to the place, she'd beat it.

1144
01:38:31,933 --> 01:38:34,413
- Well, didn't you leave anyone with her?
- Yeah, the taxi driver and he's gone, too.

1145
01:38:34,469 --> 01:38:35,914
Well, of all the stupid,
clumsy things to do...

Grand Central Station.
That's our only hope.

1147
01:38:38,506 --> 01:38:42,579
You couldn't find her if you stumbled
over her. I'll attend to this myself.

1148

(driver) Come on. Hop in.

1149

You shouldn't have done that.
I could have gotten out.

I don't feel like driving anyway.

we're going to play "Alexander's
Ragtime Band" for two reasons.

1172
01:42:29,504 --> 01:42:34,010
One, because I consider it the first,
and best, of all swing songs.

1173
01:42:34,075 --> 01:42:39,024
And second, because it means more
to me than any other piece of music.

1176
01:42:44,452 --> 01:42:47,899
And so, if you'll forgive me,
I'd like to play this song

1177
01:42:47,956 --> 01:42:51,563
not only for you and for the people
with whom you may associate it,
