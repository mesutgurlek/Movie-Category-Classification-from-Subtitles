Whoa, whoa, whoa.
There must be a mistake.

00:00:39,777 --> 00:00:41,478
This is Fanny Brice.
I'm supposed

16
00:00:41,512 --> 00:00:43,079
to be meeting Rachel Berry.

17
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:44,714
Hi, Mr. Rivkin.

18
00:00:44,748 --> 00:00:46,950
Rachel...

19
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:50,253
we at Innovative Creative
Artists are so excited

20
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:52,055
(gasps) to go to work for you.

21
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:54,257
We want to be
in the Rachel Berry business.

22
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,025
And I'm not just talking
about me.

23
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,560
I'm talking
about your whole team.

24
00:00:57,595 --> 00:01:01,631
You got Mark and Matt
and Sheila and Joe.

25
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:03,733
Although they're not
to be trusted, okay?

26
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:05,568
I just...
I'm your point person.

27
00:01:05,603 --> 00:01:07,537
- I just want you to deal with me, okay?
- Oh. Okay.

28
00:01:07,571 --> 00:01:08,905
Okay, okay,
great. So,

29
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,907
let's talk about your future!

30
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:13,576
- Yeah.
- What does Rachel Berry want? Because...

31
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:14,644
she can have it.

32
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:16,413
Well, um, I guess
I want to have

33
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:18,014
a good run with the show,

34
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:21,684
I-I don't know, maybe parlay
this into a movie career,

35
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,086
or get onto a big hit

36
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,422
- TV show, so...
- Uh-huh, great, great, great. Rachel,

37
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:27,357
those are not for you.

38
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:28,892
What?

39
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:31,861
Have you ever heard the term,
"a face for radio"?

40
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:33,163
Rachel, you're a rare breed.

41
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:35,398
I mean, you got talent
coming out of your ears.

42
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:38,268
But you got to remember
something... this is TV, okay?

43
00:01:38,302 --> 00:01:39,969
TV, the cameras,

44
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:41,738
they're this close, okay?
They see everything.

45
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:43,573
- Yeah.
- And movies, the same thing.

46
00:01:43,574 --> 00:01:44,741
It's this close,

47
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:46,276
except this time...

48
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,344
your face is
on a gigantic screen,

49
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:51,081
so that, for example... and this
is just a for-instance...

50
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:53,983
your nose is gonna be
40 feet tall.

51
00:01:54,018 --> 00:01:57,220
You got to ask yourself...
is this gonna work?

52
00:01:57,254 --> 00:01:59,322
And I think the answer is...

53
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:02,125
no... it won't.

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,793
Here's what I see for you.

55
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:05,462
If we play our cards right,

56
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:06,763
you could make a killing.

57
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:08,231
You could be doing Fanny Brice

58
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:10,967
for five, ten,
I don't know, 15 years.

59
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:13,103
Look at Topol. I mean,
he's been doing Tevye

60
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:14,971
for what, I don't know,
what, forever?

61
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:16,873
Okay? And we're all
in agreement on this...

62
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:19,376
Matt and Mike and
Sheila and Joe. Rachel,

63
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,078
for you... the sky is the limit.

64
00:02:22,113 --> 00:02:24,180
But I don't want you
talking to them, okay?

65
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:26,483
I just want you
to deal with me, all right?

June Dolloway!
She's not an actress.

80
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:57,493
She's just, like, the coolest
socialite in the world.

81
00:02:57,515 --> 00:03:00,216
She's the widow of Lester
Dolloway, the mineral baron.

82
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:02,185
Her picture's been taken
by Helmut Newton.

83
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,622
And she took peyote
with Joe Kennedy... allegedly.

84
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:06,990
- Impressive.
- Yeah,

85
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:08,425
and she's pretty much the patron

86

behind every artistic endeavor
in Manhattan.

87
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:12,962
Well, we got to make sure you're picked
as one of the performers. I already was!

88
00:03:12,997 --> 00:03:15,425
My God, Kurt, that's amazing.
I'm so happy for you.

89
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:18,214
Yeah, I really want to do "Story
of My Life" from One Direction.

90
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:20,904
That's a good song, but that's
sung by five different people.

91
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:23,840
How are you gonna sing all those
layers as just one person?

92
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:24,941
Well, you'll be singing with me.

it happens
to the other one, too.

00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:33,083
Oh, I love you.
Thank you.

98
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:35,518
Let's go rehearse.

99
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:38,864
SANTANA: What are you
doing home so early?

100
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:41,090
I thought that you'd be in
the recording studio all day.

101
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:43,560
Yeah, well, my producer
just listened to the final cut

102
00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:46,896
of my album, and in his words:
"Didn't hear a single."

103
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:49,399
Now he's worried

104
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:51,334
that the label won't give it
a release date.

105
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:53,203
Wait. What?

106
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:56,006
And you're just gonna
listen to these morons?

107
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,440
You know, if I don't get backed
by the label, that means that

108
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:01,144
I won't get any promotion, which
means I don't get any airplay,

109
00:04:01,178 --> 00:04:03,046
which means I'm just
another no-hit wonder.

110
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,048
(sighs): Well, you would,
uh, still be doing

111
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:07,017
a hell of a lot better than me.

112
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:09,285
I would kill to
be you right now,

113
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,787
thinking about creating

114
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:14,224
the perfect single to
save my record deal.

115
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:16,059
You know, maybe you can.

116
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:17,961
What are you talking about?

117
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:19,696
No, no, Santana, I'm serious.

118
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,565
Remember back in high school,
every time we sang together,

119
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,967
it was always magic.

120
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:25,402
So...

121
00:04:25,436 --> 00:04:28,071
maybe you can help me find
some of that again.

(knocking)
Great job tonight, Rachel.

164
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:01,791
Thank you, Barclay.
Remember to rest your voice.

165
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,559
- We've got two shows tomorrow.
- All right.

166
00:07:03,593 --> 00:07:05,661
46 down, 5,000 more to go.

Oh, knock on wood!

168

- Have a great night.
- Thank you.

169
00:07:11,172 --> 00:07:14,413
(knocking) Barclay, could I just
have five minutes to myself, please?

170
00:07:14,438 --> 00:07:15,871
Oh. I'm so sorry.

171
00:07:15,906 --> 00:07:18,607
(chuckles): Hi, Rachel.
So sorry to bother you.

172
00:07:18,642 --> 00:07:20,343
You were absolutely
radiant tonight.

173
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:21,811
I am such a fan.

174
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:23,412
Thank you so much.

175
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:24,981
Oh. Uh, Lee Paulblatt.

176
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:26,336
- Hello. (chuckles)
- Yes, I have been

177
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,918
in love with<i> Funny Girl</i>
since I was, like, seven.

178
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:30,686
A-Are you a friend of Paolo's?

179
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:32,188
No, no, no, no.
Well, I mean, yes.

180
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:34,056
We did a pilot with him
a few years back.

181
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:35,791
It was a train wreck.
It's not Paolo's fault,

182
00:07:35,826 --> 00:07:36,959
but... Actually, it is.

183
00:07:36,994 --> 00:07:40,196
But no, I actually
came here to see you.

184
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:44,734
I'm, uh, Lee Paulblatt.

185
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:47,336
I'm from Fox, the
television company.

186
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:48,704
- Oh.
- Yeah.

187
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:50,973
- Oh, okay.
- (laughs): Oh, okay. Yeah.

188
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:53,409
Yeah, I'm just in New York for the
up-fronts, and this is<i> the</i> show

189
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:55,077
- that I wanted to see.
- Oh...

190
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:57,213
Actually, I wanted to see the Rachel
Weisz-Daniel Craig<i> Betrayal...</i>

191
00:07:57,247 --> 00:08:00,149
but that's an impossible ticket to get...
and there was this woman in this show

192
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:03,152
that was just eating candy the entire time...
I wanted to punch her in the face...

193
00:08:03,186 --> 00:08:05,288
<i>but</i> I enjoyed it, and
you were wonderful.

194
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:06,722
Rachel...

195
00:08:06,757 --> 00:08:09,258
I have got a pilot that I think
you would be fantastic for.

196
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:10,726
It's called<i> Song of Solomon.</i>

197
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:12,228
I would love

198
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:14,363
for you to come in
to test for it.

199
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:15,798
I think you would be
perfect for it.

200
00:08:15,832 --> 00:08:17,033
I mean, I close
my eyes, Rachel,

201
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,968
and all I see is you in it.

202
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:21,938
That's how powerful of an image
that you created for me tonight

203
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:23,205
upon that stage.

204
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,320
God, I wish I had
a singing voice. I don't.

205
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:27,276
I'm not allowed to sing...
my mother said that...

206
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:29,679
because I have this...
I digress.

207
00:08:29,713 --> 00:08:32,348
Does this sound like something
that you would be interested in?

208
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:34,617
- Yes. Of course!
- Well, great.

209
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:36,892
Well, we're gonna want you
to read with our Solomon,

210
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,422
but, uh, he is in the middle
of shooting a feature.

211
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:40,590
It's a terrible feature.

212
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:42,458
I don't know why
he's chosen to do it.

213
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:44,126
<i>But</i> I am not his agent.

214
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:47,163
So, we would need to do it
next Tuesday in L.A.

215
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:48,864
Does that work for you?

216
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,299
Um... no...

217
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:52,201
Well, Tuesday
I have a show, so...

218
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:54,870
Uh, actually, your understudy
has a show on Tuesday.

219
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:58,407
Ah, just fly out for Tuesday,
and do the test, and then you

220
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:00,443
can hop on the next flight back.
Does that work for you?

221
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:02,345
You know what? I'm gonna leave
before you can say no.

222
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:03,679
That's how I work. Bye.

223
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,122
Hey. This is for you.

224
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:11,857
Oh, my God, it looks so good.

225
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:12,824
So, we're a hit?

226
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:14,092
Oh, come on.

227
00:09:14,127 --> 00:09:17,696
You are so amazing up there!
Amazing! (laughs)

228
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,264
We're gonna run forever.

229
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:21,466
Thank you, Sidney, and I really...
I want to make you proud,

230
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:24,136
it's just, um... I just, I
think I'm feeling, you know,

231
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,138
the wear and tear of
the eight shows a week,

232
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:28,140
and, I mean, I wouldn't
want to get sick

233
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:30,042
- and miss a performance...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no,

234
00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:32,477
no, no, no.
You're not gonna...

235
00:09:32,512 --> 00:09:34,513
(sputters) Put that...
put that out of your head.

236
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:36,615
You're not gonna get sick.
Tell you what.

237
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,417
I'm gonna call
Dr. Sugarman,

238
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:40,953
the best ENT in New York.

239
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:45,057
He's gonna give you,
um, a B12 drip, and also,

240
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,892
um, shoot steroids
down your throat.

241
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:49,161
(groans) Um, I mean,
wouldn't it be easier

242
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:51,864
for me to just, you
know, take a show off?

243
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:55,167
No, no, no, no. I mean, your
understudy is beautiful, she is.

00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:57,536
You know, maybe
if you, you know,

245
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,772
if your head came off, or there was a...
some kind of invasion

Manhattan,<i> maybe, maybe.</i>

to get that sound in the studio.

Oh, no, no. We're gonna
record your last song

329
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:21,006
down here in this dungeon.

330
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,408
I mean, it's ballsy,
but it's got

331
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:24,643
that unique thing we
were talking about.

332
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:26,812
Mercedes Jones,
you got yourself an album.

333
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:27,813
(gasps)

334
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:29,047
(shrieks)

335
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:30,549
RACHEL:
Kurt, this TV show

336
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,151
is a huge opportunity.

337
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:33,852
All you've been
talking about for years

338
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:35,854
is getting on Broadway.
Well, now you have.

339
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,589
You've made it. You're
that one-in-a-million girl

340
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:38,824
who actually did it.

341
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:40,692
Look, every single person
that works on Broadway

342
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:43,662
wants to make it in TV or film.
And if you think about it,

343
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:46,031
some of Hollywood's greats
were plucked from the stage.

344
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:47,933
Hugh Jackman, Diane Keaton,

345
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:49,735
Meryl Streep. Meryl.

346
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,236
And how many of them
quit their shows

347
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:52,504
less than a month
after opening night?

348
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:53,939
I'm not quitting. No w...

349
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:55,908
(scoffs)
I am not quitting, okay?

350
00:13:55,942 --> 00:13:58,444
It is, like, just an audition.
I'm actually doing something

351
00:13:58,478 --> 00:13:59,878
really nice for my understudy.
I'm just gonna,

352
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:01,213
like, take a sick day.

353
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:03,248
- You mean lie?
- Look,

354
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:05,517
if someone came to you
at NYADA right now

355
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:07,386
and asked you to audition
for this TV show,

356
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,754
tell me you would say no.

357
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,891
Fine. Go for it.

358
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:16,228
But just don't lie
to Sidney Greene.

359
00:14:16,262 --> 00:14:18,363
You'd just be asking
for more trouble.

360
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:20,099
Yes, hello,
this is Rachel Berry.

361
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:22,267
Uh, Berry. With a B.

362
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:25,137
Yes, hi, uh,
I would just like to, uh,

363
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:26,605
confirm my audition, please.

364
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,041
Good evening. Tonight,

365
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:31,810
please welcome
to our newly christened

366
00:14:31,845 --> 00:14:35,447
Dolloway Dance Lab,
our guest of honor,

367

(applause)

370
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:44,790
Oh, she's stunning.

371
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:47,259
Modern American royalty,
look at her.

372
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:59,104
Two of our finest

373
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,107
have been selected
to perform for you.

374

Thank you.
I love your youthful energy.

- (whispers): Oh, thank you.
- You know,

423
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,614
I have a very discerning
and tasteful eye

424
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:57,016
for the extraordinary.

425
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,486

until it sparkles.

427

I have a good feeling
about you.

428
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,595
Would you be so kind
as to escort me to the

429
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:12,798
SoHo Center for
Outsider Art next week?

430
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:14,400
And then we can

431
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:16,302
discuss your future

432
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:19,838

(stammers) Oh, my good...

434
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:24,443
A-Absolutely. I would love to.
I-I am your lump of coal.

435
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:26,478
Mm. Not you, dear.

436
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:29,148
You.

437
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:32,184
Sorry.

438
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:37,270
I tried to sneak you an extra ticket,

439
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,668
I just didn't have
the 25 grand it would cost.

440
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,003
I don't know, maybe I should
just stay home with you

441
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,204
and watch<i> Scandal.</i>

442
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,606
Would you stop it?

443
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,142
I'm a little jealous,
but I'm not resentful.

444
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:49,710
All right? I-I'm
genuinely happy for you.

445
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:52,146
I just feel like
being one of June's projects

446
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,881
is gonna take up a lot of time.

447
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:55,482
I especially don't want
a friend that's gonna

448
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:56,550
keep me away from you.

449
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:58,419
Well, June isn't
exactly a friend.

450
00:18:58,453 --> 00:18:59,954
Yeah, you're probably right.

451
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:00,955
How do I look?

452
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:02,590
Like Montgomery Clift.

453
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:03,924
What?

454
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:04,959
Before the accident.

455
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:06,527
Oh, thank you.

456
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:08,961
Try to have fun tonight, all
right? And don't worry about me.

457
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:10,531
Remember, whatever door
June opens for you,

458
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:12,733
I'll be right there next to you
walking through it with you.

459
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,834
You're taking one for the team.

460
00:19:13,868 --> 00:19:15,869
I love you.

461
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:24,345
BLAINE:
Who are all of these people?

462
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:27,248
DOLLOWAY: This is the one
percent of one percent.

463
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:30,417
Never have so many boring
and rich people

464
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:38,452
found themselves grouped
together in such a space.

465
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:42,070
He thinks someone like you is
too fabulous to have friends.

466
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:45,807
No, I... My friends are why
I'm fabulous. Andrew.

467
00:19:45,842 --> 00:19:47,275
This is Blaine.

468
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,077
Hi. Pleasure.

469
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:50,412
No, friends are everything.

470
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:53,048
You are the company you keep.

471
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:55,851
That is why, Blaine,
if I'm gonna launch your career

472
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:58,787
and make the world know who you
are, we have to be friends.

473
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:02,157
I have to know you, spend time
with you, know what you like.

474
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:04,793
It's the only way I can
really serve you, you see.

475
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:06,661
What-What is the take?

476
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,540
Holding steady at two million.

477
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:10,665
Two million?

478
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,300
(mouths silently)
Has anybody told them

479
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:13,869
the recession is over?

480
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:15,670
I can't force them
to give, June.

481
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:17,439
(laughing):
No.

482
00:20:17,473 --> 00:20:19,574
Okay. We have to inspire them.

483
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,410
Um, where... where
are you going?

484
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:23,345
I'm gonna go earn our supper.

485
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,485
Okay, everybody.
Now, settle down.

486
00:20:31,854 --> 00:20:34,523
Now, you know that
I've been to all of your events

487
00:20:34,557 --> 00:20:37,893
and I've written some pretty
fat checks myself, correct?

488
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:40,829
So tonight is your opportunity
to return the favor.

489
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:42,697
And when I say fat,

490
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:45,000
I mean "Fatty Arbuckle fat."

491
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:46,668
(soft laughter)
I-I don't mean

492
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:48,970
fat as in your
chubby first wife.

493
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:52,674
Now, you're gonna get
something for the money.

494
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,543
Believe me.
I have something special.

495
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:56,078
Blaine, come up, please.

496
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:58,814
I want to introduce you. Blaine Anderson.
(applause)

497
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:10,125
Blaine... Blaine here
is my new discovery.

498
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,862
And, as you all know,
I'm never wrong. So...

499
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:15,976

(cheering and applause)

541
00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:36,071
Look, they just want a
great song from me, okay?

542
00:23:36,105 --> 00:23:38,206
They don't care how
I give it to 'em. Just trust me.

543
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:39,408
D'SHON: Hey.

544
00:23:39,442 --> 00:23:41,276
Did I get the days mixed up?

545
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:43,545
- I was expecting you tomorrow.
- Well,

546
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:46,214
Santana and I were talking,
and we were thinking...

547
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:48,417
that that song we're
looking for is a duet.

548
00:23:48,451 --> 00:23:50,419
And don't just say no,

549
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:51,586
because we sounded great.

550
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:53,255
On a Lauryn Hill song, yeah.

551
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:55,023
But I liked the song we had.

552
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,759
We just needed a new take
on it, which is what we got.

553
00:23:57,794 --> 00:24:01,630
You, pure, raw, underground.

554
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:03,765
Yeah, but the take that<i> I</i> want

555
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,868
is a duet with me and my girl.

556
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,770
Uh...

557
00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:11,139
look, Mercedes,
I know this is your friend...

558
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:13,041
and you got something...

559
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,877
but this is your calling card.

560
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,713
This is going to be your story.

561
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,548
Introducing another voice,

562
00:24:19,582 --> 00:24:20,782
how do we sell that?

563
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:22,517
Think Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.

564
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,455
Mercedes, I think
that we should go.

565
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:28,357
I'm just trying to protect you.

566
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:30,325
- But it's my album.
- Okay, look,

567
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,327
if you're really
into doing a duet,

568
00:24:32,362 --> 00:24:35,097
let me make some phone calls,
let me call in some favors,

569
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:37,566
let me get you with Katy,
let me get you with Carly,

570
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,968
let me get you with Alicia.
Let me get you with someone

571
00:24:40,003 --> 00:24:41,903
more famous than you
that can actually help you,

572
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,373
and Santana can sing backup.

573
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:46,375
And if everything goes
like it's supposed to,

574
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:47,943
then we revisit this

575
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:49,544
on your follow-up album.

576
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:50,879
SANTANA:
Yeah, you know what?

577
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:51,947
I think that he's right.

578
00:24:51,981 --> 00:24:53,782
This is your big chance,

579
00:24:53,816 --> 00:24:55,450
and it should be
all about you, you know?

580
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:58,053
And I really appreciate what
you tried to do for me here,

581
00:24:58,087 --> 00:25:00,589
but I know what I would do
if I was in your position.

582
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:02,124
I'm just not worth it.

583
00:25:02,926 --> 00:25:03,859
Santana...

584
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,364
(coughing)

585
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:11,300
(hoarsely):
Sidney... (groans)

586
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:14,102
I know I said I would
never miss a show, but...

587
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:17,806
(coughs) I just saw my doctor,
and he said that I have the flu.

588
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,310
- The flu? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- I know... I was starting to feel run-down.

589
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:24,179
Why does this always, always
happen to me?

590
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:27,115
I'm sorry. Do you think
my understudy Wendy can do it?

591
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,320
(panting) Well, if I
have to, uh, I have to.

592
00:25:31,354 --> 00:25:33,855
But, uh, nobody can replace you,
Rachala.

593
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,857
You're my... you're my star,
you're my show.

594
00:25:35,892 --> 00:25:38,126
I-I'm gargling
with a magical mouthwash,

595
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,730
and-and I'm-I'm gonna dry up
my sinuses with a humidifier,

596
00:25:41,764 --> 00:25:44,733
and I will do my absolute best
to be better in 24 hours.

597
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:46,034
(coughing)

598
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,647
PAULBLATT:

00:25:54,672 --> 00:25:56,306
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Rachel Berry,

Excuse me?

642
00:28:29,694 --> 00:28:30,694
Yes.

643
00:28:30,728 --> 00:28:32,229
- Uh, that was beautiful,
- Thank you.

644
00:28:32,263 --> 00:28:34,097
um, but we-we really don't

645
00:28:34,132 --> 00:28:35,032
need you to sing.

646
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:36,400
- Oh?
- Yeah,

647
00:28:36,434 --> 00:28:38,235
this show is not a musical.

648
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:40,270
Did you not read

649
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:41,872
the script?

650
00:28:41,906 --> 00:28:44,107
I'm-I'm sorry. I-I didn't...
I didn't get a script.

651
00:28:44,108 --> 00:28:46,877
- I just saw the title, <i>The
Song of Solomon.</i> - Oh, Rachel,

652
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:49,680
that's my bad. I'm going
to fire my assistant.

653
00:28:49,714 --> 00:28:50,747
<i>Song of Solomon</i>

654
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:52,749
is a sci-fi space opera.

655
00:28:52,784 --> 00:28:54,851
- Oh. Okay.
- Andrew here plays

656
00:28:54,886 --> 00:28:57,220
Captain Dax Anderss,
uh, who pilots his ship,

657
00:28:57,255 --> 00:28:59,823
the<i> Solomon,</i>
across the Andromeda Galaxy

658
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:02,259
with, uh, Galadriel
the Starmorian... that's you...

659
00:29:02,293 --> 00:29:04,094
- Okay.
- ... searching for the Drax Flute,

660
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,562
- Right.
- ... which he needs to use

661
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:07,698
to play a song implanted
in his head by his father

662
00:29:07,732 --> 00:29:10,233
that he believes
will open a wormhole

663
00:29:10,268 --> 00:29:11,702
back to his home planet.

664
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:13,403
- Okay! Yeah.
- Okay.

665
00:29:13,438 --> 00:29:15,405
It's sort of like
<i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>

666
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,040
meets<i> Game of Thrones.</i>

667
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:18,041
- Okay.
- With a strong

668
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:20,711
<i>Grey's Anatomy</i> element.

669
00:29:20,745 --> 00:29:23,714
Yeah. That's what mostly...
really excited about that.

670
00:29:23,748 --> 00:29:25,282
Great. Love that show.

671
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:26,450
Andrew, let's take it
from, uh...

672
00:29:26,484 --> 00:29:27,584
Let's just try the first scene

673
00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:29,052
in the engine room, okay?

674
00:29:29,087 --> 00:29:31,388
Great.
(chuckles) Okay.

675
00:29:31,422 --> 00:29:34,458
(mimicking spaceship sounds)

676
00:29:34,492 --> 00:29:36,660
You gonna just stand there,
or are you gonna pass me

677
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:39,262
the warp-core?

678
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:45,168
- Would you care to explain
what went on back there?
- Oh, don't

679
00:29:45,203 --> 00:29:46,770
play coy, Galadriel.

680
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:48,905
You Starmorians may like to beat
around the bush,

681
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,241
but I always prefer
a straight shooter.

682
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:53,410
Then let me be perfectly clear.

683
00:29:53,444 --> 00:29:56,546
I am not just some space trash

684
00:29:56,581 --> 00:30:00,117
you picked up
in the Triangulum Sector.

685
00:30:00,151 --> 00:30:03,253
I am a princess
of the royal house of...

686
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:05,922
I'm sorry, Antrya...

687
00:30:05,957 --> 00:30:08,091
- Antyrexx, but make it your own. Stay in it.
- Antyrexx. I'm just gonna

688
00:30:08,126 --> 00:30:10,160
- pass by it. We'll talk about it later.
- Okay.

689
00:30:10,194 --> 00:30:13,630
I am not the last...
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

690
00:30:13,665 --> 00:30:17,167
I-I<i> am</i> the last Starmorian,

691
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:19,269
and I will not risk my life

692
00:30:19,304 --> 00:30:21,538
and the future of my people

693
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:24,141
because of some dream
locked in your head

694
00:30:24,175 --> 00:30:25,809
and a flute...

695
00:30:25,843 --> 00:30:28,345
and a flute
that will never avenge

696
00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:32,249
the destruction of my planet.

697
00:30:34,018 --> 00:30:37,287
Lately, I've only dreamt
of one thing.

698
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:39,823
And that's doing this.

699
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:42,859
Mmm.

700
00:30:45,296 --> 00:30:46,263
Mmm.

701
00:30:46,297 --> 00:30:48,031
(Rachel chuckles)

702
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:49,599
Okay, uh...

703
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:52,169
- next scene?
- No, thank you so much, Rachel.

704
00:30:52,203 --> 00:30:53,670
So, so great.

705
00:30:53,705 --> 00:30:55,505
I think, uh... yeah,

706
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,574
I think that we've seen
all we need to see.

707
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:59,710
Great. Thank you.

708
00:30:59,744 --> 00:31:01,745
Okay.
(chuckles)

709
00:31:03,214 --> 00:31:05,349
I can't believe it.

710
00:31:05,383 --> 00:31:07,851
That was seriously
the worst audition ever.

711
00:31:07,885 --> 00:31:09,720
(sighs)

712
00:31:09,754 --> 00:31:11,188
What?

713
00:31:11,222 --> 00:31:13,023
(line ringing)

714
00:31:13,057 --> 00:31:14,558
- Rachel.
- Hi, Sidney.

715
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:17,027
Look, before you say anything,
I just... I felt really bad

716
00:31:17,061 --> 00:31:19,296
after our last conversation,
and, you know,

717
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,832
I want to reiterate to you
my commitment to Broadway

718
00:31:21,866 --> 00:31:23,900
and to the show,
and-and I wanted to tell you

719
00:31:23,935 --> 00:31:26,303
what-what an honor
it is working for you

720
00:31:26,337 --> 00:31:28,572
and-and being in<i> Funny Girl.</i>
And, you know, I was thinking

721
00:31:28,606 --> 00:31:30,774
about playing Fanny night
after night after night,

722
00:31:30,808 --> 00:31:34,278
and I honestly... I just...
it made me feel so much better.

723
00:31:34,312 --> 00:31:37,915
Oh, I'm so relieved. I'm so
relieved to hear that, Rachel.

724
00:31:37,949 --> 00:31:41,385
Listen, um, your understudy
today during rehearsal

725
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:43,899
fell off the lip of the stage.

726
00:31:44,455 --> 00:31:47,024
- You fell off the lip of the stage.
- (crying): Oh, no...

727
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:49,059
Now, look,
hydrate yourself, okay?

728
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:51,595
And then come
to the theater, 7:30.

729
00:31:53,097 --> 00:31:54,932
Oh, my God.

730
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:56,400
Oh, my God.

731
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:58,068
Oh, no. Taxi?

732
00:31:58,102 --> 00:31:59,569
Taxi!

733
00:31:59,604 --> 00:32:01,305
Taxi!

734
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:02,940
Take me to the airport!

735
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:08,279
So I said to Prince Faisal,

736
00:32:08,313 --> 00:32:11,849
"What do you think this is,
a quarter horse convention?"

737
00:32:11,883 --> 00:32:14,084
I want to be you when I grow up.

738
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,619
Why? What do you find
so attractive?

739
00:32:15,654 --> 00:32:17,688
Tell me. Is it the fame?

740
00:32:17,722 --> 00:32:18,823
Is it the power?

741
00:32:18,857 --> 00:32:20,157
Is it the money? What is it?

742
00:32:20,192 --> 00:32:21,826
No, it's-it's the life.

743
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,361
I mean, how did you manage
to find yourself

744
00:32:24,396 --> 00:32:26,397
in the center of all of it?

745
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:28,732
You attract in what you put out.

746
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:31,602
So if you put out charisma

747
00:32:31,636 --> 00:32:33,337
to every person you meet,

748
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:36,107
the universe will see to it
that it comes back to you.

749
00:32:36,141 --> 00:32:38,642
Because like attracts like.

750
00:32:38,677 --> 00:32:41,846
That's why I'm so in like
with you.

751
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,681
Oh, my God. I just...

752
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:45,755
I can't believe
that you see me that way.

753
00:32:45,784 --> 00:32:47,618
Okay, so we're going
to do a show,

754
00:32:47,652 --> 00:32:49,120
showcase your talent.

755
00:32:49,154 --> 00:32:50,855
It'll be the biggest event
the whole year.

756
00:32:50,889 --> 00:32:52,857
Thank you. Thank you so much.

757
00:32:52,891 --> 00:32:55,092
That-that's huge.

758
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:57,828
I just want to shine a light
on what the world should see.

759
00:32:57,863 --> 00:32:59,497
Well, I-I would just have
one request.

760
00:32:59,531 --> 00:33:01,999
I would love it
if we could have Kurt

761
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:04,902
in the show, too. We really
want to do everything together,

762
00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:06,570
and I think that the world
really needs

763
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:08,539
to see his talent, too.

764
00:33:08,573 --> 00:33:12,009
No, I don't think
the world needs to see that.

765
00:33:12,043 --> 00:33:15,079
Well, then I-I don't think
I could do it.

766
00:33:15,113 --> 00:33:16,480
Stop.

767
00:33:16,515 --> 00:33:18,516
Blaine, I've been in
and out of love

768
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,518
more times
than you've had breakfast.

769
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:22,820
I know you're not
asking me this,

770
00:33:22,854 --> 00:33:24,655
but I am telling you.

771
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:26,357
You should break off
that engagement.

772
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:28,993
I love Kurt.

773
00:33:29,027 --> 00:33:30,161
Well, of course you do.

774
00:33:30,195 --> 00:33:31,695
I loved Richard Burton
and Howard Hughes.

775
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,863
(laughs)

776
00:33:32,898 --> 00:33:35,032
So what?
That's what we humans do.

777
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:36,734
We fall in and out of love.

778
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,102
We break each other's hearts.

779
00:33:38,136 --> 00:33:41,272
The first time, you always think
it's the most important,

780
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:42,740
but that isn't true.

781
00:33:42,774 --> 00:33:44,842
It's the test.

782
00:33:44,876 --> 00:33:46,944
So you have to make a decision.

783
00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:48,713
Are you gonna settle,

784
00:33:48,747 --> 00:33:51,248
or are you going
to venture out into the unknown

785
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:55,219
like a samurai,
and realize your full, full

786
00:33:55,253 --> 00:33:57,822
potential?

787
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:03,694
Excuse me, sir.
Why is there a traffic jam?

788
00:34:03,729 --> 00:34:05,329
Because there's always
a traffic jam.

789
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:06,731
Interesting story.

790
00:34:06,765 --> 00:34:09,367
In 1950s, all the
hot-shot automakers

791
00:34:09,401 --> 00:34:12,970
allegedly banded together and
got rid of the trolley cars.

792
00:34:13,004 --> 00:34:14,438
And that's what inspired
<i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</i>

793
00:34:14,473 --> 00:34:15,606
- Uh, I'm sorry.
- Remember that?

794
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,874
(mutters) Excuse me.

795
00:34:16,908 --> 00:34:18,743
I have to make a flight
at the airport,

796
00:34:18,777 --> 00:34:19,910
10:00 a.m. to New York.

797
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:21,712
I have to make it.
I'm in a Broadway show.

798
00:34:21,747 --> 00:34:22,880
I have to get there.

799
00:34:22,914 --> 00:34:24,048
Yeah, not gonna happen.

800
00:34:24,082 --> 00:34:25,683
Hey, I'm an actor, too.

801
00:34:25,717 --> 00:34:27,618
I played a john
on<i> The Client List.</i>

802
00:34:27,652 --> 00:34:29,020
This seat belt is stuck.

803
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:31,756
Hey, girl. How's it going?

804
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,558
Oh, my God, Kurt, I am dead.
I am so dead right now.

805
00:34:34,593 --> 00:34:36,160
Okay, Sidney is expecting
me at the theater,

806
00:34:36,194 --> 00:34:37,328
and my understudy
cannot get on,

807
00:34:37,362 --> 00:34:38,629
and-and I'm not
gonna make it

808
00:34:38,663 --> 00:34:40,097
until after the curtain goes up.

809
00:34:40,132 --> 00:34:41,532
Well, this is a disaster!

810
00:34:41,566 --> 00:34:44,168
You have to call Sidney right
now and tell him the truth!

811
00:34:44,202 --> 00:34:47,104
What? No! And-and ruin my TV and
my Broadway career all at once?

812
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:49,019
Kurt, you have
to help me! Please!

813
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:54,578
(clears her throat)

814
00:34:56,014 --> 00:34:57,415
What is that?

815
00:34:57,449 --> 00:35:00,785
It's a contract,
and you need to sign it

816
00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:03,654
so that we can get to work
on our duet.

817
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:05,690
Okay, you know what?
You are literally insane.

818
00:35:05,724 --> 00:35:07,825
You need to take this
contract, rip it up,

819
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:10,961
apologize to D'Shon and
do that song by yourself.

820
00:35:10,996 --> 00:35:13,497
Listen, I want my album
to be the best,

821
00:35:13,532 --> 00:35:15,866
and, Santana,
you make me better.

822
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:18,469
Rachel... she's great,
but we both know

823
00:35:18,503 --> 00:35:20,371
who the top bitches
of that glee club were.

824
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:22,106
Point taken.

825
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,808
And I want to help you.

826
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:26,243
Yeah, but, see, um,
I think that I've proven

827
00:35:26,278 --> 00:35:27,945
that I'm not
the world's best friend.

828
00:35:27,979 --> 00:35:29,914
You might be
a work in progress,

829
00:35:29,948 --> 00:35:32,083
but I think
you're worth the wait.

830
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,988
You know, this is
the nicest thing

831
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:38,589
that anyone has ever
done for me.

832
00:35:38,623 --> 00:35:40,157
I know. I'm awesome, huh?

833
00:35:40,192 --> 00:35:42,293
Do either of you

834
00:35:42,327 --> 00:35:43,361
look at your phone?

835
00:35:43,395 --> 00:35:45,196
Rachel is stuck in L.A., okay?

836
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,365
We have to delay tonight's
performance until she gets back.

837
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:49,000
Okay, I'm thinking maybe
like a bomb threat,

838
00:35:49,034 --> 00:35:51,369
or maybe like
a bed bug scare, or...

839
00:35:51,403 --> 00:35:53,037
or maybe I run out
in the lobby, and I'm, like,

840
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:55,006
"Hey, Barbra's in the park, and
she's doing a concert for free!"

841
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,041
Please stop. Just stop.
All of your ideas are horrible.

842
00:35:57,075 --> 00:35:58,542
Well, do you have a better one?
Because, I mean,

843
00:35:58,577 --> 00:36:00,897
if Rachel doesn't get back
in time, she could get fired!

844
00:36:04,016 --> 00:36:05,983
No one is gonna get fired.

845
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:08,386
And yes, I actually
do have a better idea.

846
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,065
BARCLAY:
Ooh! What a night, right?

847
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,157
Hold that. Um,

848
00:36:13,191 --> 00:36:14,325
I didn't want to alarm you,

849
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:15,559
but I didn't know
who else to call.

850
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:16,727
How is this possible?

851
00:36:16,762 --> 00:36:19,130
Um, she's right in there.

852
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,901
What the hell
are you doing here?

853
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:25,503
I'm going on as Fanny.

854
00:36:25,537 --> 00:36:27,672
I thought you quit.

855
00:36:27,706 --> 00:36:29,573
I guess I could quit again
if you want

856
00:36:29,608 --> 00:36:31,742
to spend the next couple
of hours handing out refunds.

857
00:36:31,777 --> 00:36:32,877
Where's Rachel?

858
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:34,912
She's not here, but...

859
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:38,649
I am, and trust me,
Sidney, I've got this.

860
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,434
So, I figured I'd kill two birds
with one stone

861
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,302
by thanking you for keeping me
from getting fired

862
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:48,313
and humiliated by making sure
the show wasn't canceled.

863
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:50,375
I cannot believe they
didn't can you anyway.

864
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,676
Yeah, well, they still might.

865
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:53,011
I e-mailed Rupert and Sidney

866
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,713
and explained
the whole situation to them,

867
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:56,648
and all I got back
was an e-mail saying

868
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:59,084
that I had to come in for
a mandatory meeting tomorrow.

869
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:00,485
You're so screwed.

870
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,753
Yeah. Well, I mean,
I don't know.

871
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:03,455
At least I'm not going to be,
like, sued or anything

872
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:05,056
for all of the tickets
that they would have had

873
00:37:05,091 --> 00:37:06,358
to refund if the show
had been canceled.

874
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:07,953
Don't sweat it.
I had a blast, actually.

875
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,227
I mean,
that Broadway stuff is fun

876
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:10,829
if you only have to do it once.

877
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:13,865
So, what's the,
uh, second bird?

878
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,635
Well, I mean, I wanted to see
what you wanted in return.

879
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:19,237
Is that the kind of friend
that you think that I am?

880
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,375
Yeah. Okay.
Look, I get it.

881
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,944
I get how
I could come off that way,

882
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:28,914
but let's just use this
as an example

883
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:31,249
of the kind of friend
that I'm trying to be now.

884
00:37:31,284 --> 00:37:33,251
Okay.

885
00:37:33,286 --> 00:37:36,288
Well, why the sudden thawing
of your icy heart?

886
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:38,557
Well, because I realized

887
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:41,059
that the world is even colder
than I am.

888
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:43,395
You know, and the only thing
that you can do

889
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,063
to keep from freezing
to death is

890
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,165
have good friends around you
to keep you warm.

891
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,701
So, I decided
that I want to use

892
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:53,105
my bitch powers to protect
the people that I care about.

893
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:56,241
And I guess that means
that I care about you.

894
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:58,243
Don't tell anyone.

895
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,911
I won't.

896
00:37:59,946 --> 00:38:02,114
- Okay.
- I made it in time

897
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:04,883
for the second act,
and you were really good.

898
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:07,152
Thanks.

899
00:38:07,186 --> 00:38:09,588
(sighs)

900
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:12,057
I just can't believe
I screwed it all up.

901
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:15,627
I mean, I had everything, and

902
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:18,964
all my dreams had come true,

903
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:21,600
and I threw it away.

904
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:23,602
And for what?

905
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:25,203
Nothing.

906
00:38:25,238 --> 00:38:28,373
Listen, I don't know what Sidney
is going to do to you tomorrow.

907
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,242
Maybe he'll fire you.

908
00:38:30,276 --> 00:38:32,244
I know I would.

909
00:38:32,278 --> 00:38:35,380
But I also know
that you are the type of person

910
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:37,883
that can't be held down.

911
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:39,284
You're this huge talent.

912
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:42,254
It's like Russell Crowe
and Johnny Carson.

913
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:43,855
No matter how awful you are,

914
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,010
people are always gonna want
to work with you.

915
00:38:47,226 --> 00:38:49,294
That was kind of nice,
I think, but...

916
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:54,766
You're a really good friend,
Santana.

917
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:01,673
Oh, I'm gonna take this
all for myself.

918
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:03,341
(laughter)

919
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:07,145
Finally, I get some alone time
with you on the couch.

920
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,647
I feel like
I haven't seen you in days.

921
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:10,882
Well, you keep telling me
never to say no to June.

922
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:12,818
Well, you never know
who she might introduce you to

923
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:14,186
who could help us
in our careers.

924
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,921
I mean, literally, all
her friends are rich and famous.

925
00:39:15,955 --> 00:39:17,789
By the way, I'm upset with you.

926
00:39:17,824 --> 00:39:20,192
- Why?
- Because

927
00:39:20,226 --> 00:39:21,827
you haven't filled me in
on any of the gossip.

928
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:23,862
You spend six hours
a day with her,

929
00:39:23,896 --> 00:39:25,864
and I have yet
to receive one text being, like,

930
00:39:25,898 --> 00:39:28,700
"Hey, I'm talking poverty
with Bono," or-or tales

931
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:31,303
of lunch at Balthazar with
Karl Lagerfeld or Condi Rice.

932
00:39:31,337 --> 00:39:32,971
It's not like that at all.

933
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:34,773
It's-it's just me and June.

934
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,208
Well, is-is she being
inappropriate?

935
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:37,476
Because I draw a line.

936
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,979
What? No. Gross.
Not at all.

937
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:42,047
Then what is it?

938
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:49,788
Um, well, we're, um,
planning a... a show.

939
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:52,124
It's just like
a one-night-only showcase.

940
00:39:52,158 --> 00:39:53,525
Oh, my God, that's amazing!

941
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,327
Why didn't you tell me?

942
00:39:55,361 --> 00:40:00,365
I just wanted to make sure that
your part was more fleshed out.

943
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,000
I get to be in it?!

944
00:40:02,034 --> 00:40:03,502
But I-I thought she hated me.

945
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:05,570
Well, she doesn't hate you.

946
00:40:05,605 --> 00:40:06,972
You're such a sweetheart!

947
00:40:07,006 --> 00:40:08,473
Oh, like, okay, okay.

948
00:40:08,508 --> 00:40:11,376
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to ruin the surprise.

949
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,312
Oh, okay, I'm not gonna
ask you anything else, but

950
00:40:14,347 --> 00:40:15,714
I am... I am dying to know

951
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:16,848
what I'll be doing.

952
00:40:16,883 --> 00:40:19,084
Oh, I love you so much.
Oh.

953
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,721
(knocks)

954
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:25,757
Rachel, have a seat.

955
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:33,198
Mr. Greene, I just...
I really wanted to apologize

956
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:34,966
for how everything turned out.

957
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:36,668
Oh, please. It's okay.

958
00:40:36,702 --> 00:40:41,106
As you young people say,
"I totally understand."

959
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,541
- Really?
- Yeah.

960
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:44,543
I mean, you wanted out
of a performance,

961
00:40:44,577 --> 00:40:47,612
and I told you "no"
in no uncertain terms.

962
00:40:47,647 --> 00:40:49,781
(sighs)
Mr. Greene...

963
00:40:49,816 --> 00:40:51,850
Let me finish.

964
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:54,219
You lied to me.

965
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:56,855
You know, I'm disappointed.

966
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,356
Now, I personally
feel betrayed.

967
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:00,292
But I'm not going to fire you.

968
00:41:00,326 --> 00:41:02,461
- Oh. Really?
- No.

969
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:05,730
I wanted to fire you.

970
00:41:05,765 --> 00:41:08,133
I spent all day
<i>trying</i> to fire you.

971
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:11,670
I spoke to Rupert,
the other investors,

972
00:41:11,704 --> 00:41:13,405
and they all agreed

973
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:16,475
that you're an ambitious,
irresponsible child.

974
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:18,176
What can we do?

975
00:41:18,211 --> 00:41:21,146
You're our star.
We need you.

976
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:25,016
Well, Mr. Greene, I...
I know I made a mistake,

977
00:41:25,051 --> 00:41:27,018
but I had an opportunity
come my way,

978
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:28,553
and I just... I thought...

979
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:33,658
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, mm-hmm, you thought.

980
00:41:33,693 --> 00:41:35,794
I've seen this all the time,

981
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:37,963
and let me tell you
something, Miss Berry.

982
00:41:37,997 --> 00:41:40,732
You aren't some Broadway legend.

983
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:43,835
If you ever

984
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,004
pull something like this again,

985
00:41:46,038 --> 00:41:48,140
I will not only fire you;

986
00:41:48,174 --> 00:41:50,509
I will sue you back
to the stone age

987
00:41:50,543 --> 00:41:52,511
for breach of contract.

988
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:57,649
And you'll never be able
to work on Broadway again.

989
00:41:57,683 --> 00:41:59,451
Your reputation...

990
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:01,486
will not exist.

991
00:42:04,057 --> 00:42:06,758
Get the hell out of my office.

992
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:15,367
(crying)

993
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:17,169
(sighs, phone buzzing)

994
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:18,603
(sniffles)

995
00:42:18,638 --> 00:42:20,605
Hello?

996
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,375
Hi, Rachel. Lee Paulblatt.

997
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:25,911
Yeah, I've got some bad news.

998
00:42:25,945 --> 00:42:28,413
As you're aware, that, uh,
was not a great audition.

999
00:42:28,448 --> 00:42:30,408
There were some girls
who just came in

1000
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:32,250
and knocked it
out of the park, so,

1001
00:42:32,285 --> 00:42:33,418
the bottom line is that,

1002
00:42:33,453 --> 00:42:34,619
unfortunately,
you did not get the part.

1003
00:42:34,654 --> 00:42:36,254
I know, Mr. Paulblatt.

1004
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:38,023
Thank you for the opportunity.

1005
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:40,358
But I've also got
some good news.

1006
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:41,760
Rachel, I mean, clearly,

1007
00:42:41,794 --> 00:42:43,829
<i>Song of Solomon</i> was not
the right project for you.

1008
00:42:43,863 --> 00:42:45,397
But when I said that you were

1009
00:42:45,431 --> 00:42:47,265
a once-in-a-generation talent,
I meant it,

1010
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,569
which is why I want
to give you a development deal.

1011
00:42:50,603 --> 00:42:51,970
Are you serious?

1012
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:54,406
I don't... I don't even know
what that means.

1013
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,042
We want to create a TV show
around you, Rachel.

1014
00:42:57,076 --> 00:42:58,577
We don't know what it is,

1015
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:00,612
but, uh, oh,
we'll figure that out.

1016
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:01,980
Are you serious?

1017
00:43:02,014 --> 00:43:03,348
Yes, Rachel, I am serious.

1018
00:43:03,382 --> 00:43:05,917
I've got a writer in mind
I want to pair you with.

1019
00:43:05,952 --> 00:43:07,586
You don't even have
to leave New York.

1020
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,920
We're sending her to you.

1021
00:43:08,955 --> 00:43:12,457
Mr. Paulblatt, I... I..
I-I don't even know what to say.

1022
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:13,792
Just say thank you.
Congrats, Rachel.

1023
00:43:13,826 --> 00:43:17,014
Celebrate with your friends.
We'll be in touch.

1024
00:43:17,045 --> 00:43:22,081
