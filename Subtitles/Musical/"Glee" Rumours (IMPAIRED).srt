<i>Here's what you missed on</i> Glee:
Kurt Hummel's back at McKinley!

2
00:00:03,224 --> 00:00:05,685
<i>Kurt's back at McKinley,</i>
<i>but he's still dating Blaine.</i>

00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:07,513
<i>Sam used to date Quinn,</i>
<i>but she's back with Finn,</i>

00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:08,738

5
00:00:08,748 --> 00:00:10,699
<i>who's still sort of in love</i>
<i>with him-- Finn, that is.</i>

6
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,083
<i>Santana's in love</i>
<i>with Brittany,</i>

7
00:00:12,168 --> 00:00:13,401
<i>but she's too scared</i>
<i>to say it out loud--</i>

8
00:00:13,452 --> 00:00:14,569
But you told me
you were in love with me.

9
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,903
I honestly don't know
what I was thinking.

10
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:17,238
<i>And Britt's back</i>
<i>with Artie, anyways.</i>

11
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:19,340
<i>Kids these days.</i>
I have a question.

12
00:00:19,408 --> 00:00:21,209
<i>Sue's bent on destroying the</i>
<i>Glee Club before Nationals.</i>

13
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,627
Destroy the Glee Club!

14
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,596
<i>She even formed an evil league</i>
<i>with nicknames.</i>

15
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,414
The League of Doom.
I don't think I was listening

16
00:00:26,465 --> 00:00:28,508
when you said what our name was.
Is it League or Legion?

17
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:30,031
Worst henchmen ever.

Hi, I'm Brittany S. Pierce,

23
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,137
and this is my new Internet
talk show, <i>Fondue for Two,</i>

24
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:48,956
which combines the two things
I like most:

25
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,342
hot cheese
and talking to people.

26
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:55,346
My first two guests are
the school's biggest gossips,

27
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:58,349
Mercedes Jones and
Ms. Tina Cohen-Chang.

28
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,068
Shouldn't it be
<i>Fondue for Three?</i>

29
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:03,988
Oh, my God, that is hot!

30
00:01:04,073 --> 00:01:06,157
Okay, so let's get down
to some hot dish.

31
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:09,193
Um, I heard a rumor that
Mr. Kidney the janitor walks

32
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,995
around school drinking vodka
out of a teapot.

33
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:12,146
Is this really what they were

34
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,247
doing in the '70s?

35
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:14,999
Hot mess Mr. Kidney
aside, I want

36
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:18,836
to talk about the rumor
about Asian men: not true.

37
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:20,088
I mean, it's not even good.

38
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:21,589
It tastes the way
a baby's diaper smells.

39
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:23,491
I heard a rumor that Santana
plays for the other team,

40
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,460
and I can confirm that rumor:
It's 100% true.

41
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:27,495
Wait. What?

42
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,180
Brittany, are you serious?

43
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:30,848
Yes.
(cat meows)

44
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:32,667
BRITTANY:
Look, it's Lord Tubbington.

45
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,102
Hi!

46
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:36,187
Hi. (smooches)

47
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:37,438
This is Lord Tubbington.

48
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:39,107
(baby talk):
Say hi to the camera.

49
00:01:39,174 --> 00:01:41,175
You want some cheese?

50
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,343
That's disgusting.

51
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,028
That's my baby.

52
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:46,864
So, you're just gonna
gonna let him do that?

53
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:49,990
Lord Tubbington's allowed to eat
cheese because he's on Atkins.

54
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:52,734
Okay, well, that's all we have
time for today.

55

Tune in next week

Hey.

60
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:07,624
Why are you talking to me?
Can't I say hello?

61
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:09,009
I guess. It's just Santana

62
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:10,427
told me never
to speak alone with you

63
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:12,379
because you would try
to steal all of my gold.

64
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,183
Okay, uh... anyway,
I got you this.

65
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,469
I know everyone's always
making fun of your lips,

66
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:20,471
but I think they're cute
and worth weatherproofing.

67
00:02:20,538 --> 00:02:23,057
So, considering that
we're both single

68
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:24,725
and I think your lips are cute,

69
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:27,895
I was wondering if you would
go to to prom with me?

70
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:29,146
As in your date?
Yeah.

71
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:32,366
No.
No... "No, No" as in...?

72
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:34,051
As in no prom.
Oh.

73
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,435
I don't think I'm going.

74
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:37,738
Are you worried
that Finn will be jealous?

75
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:42,159
Look, you're just
not my type, okay, Rachel?

76
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:45,245
So thanks for the lip chap.

77
00:02:47,677 --> 00:02:50,628
I feel like my life
finally has purpose.

78
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,682
It's so nice to be a part of a
cause that's bigger than myself.

79
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:56,151
Honey Badger, I am so thrilled,

80
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:57,936
Can I ask why you're dressed
like David Bowie?

81
00:02:58,004 --> 00:02:59,187
I'm incognito.

82
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:00,822
We're going deep
behind enemy lines.

83
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:02,741
People are starting
to sense my weakness.

84
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,743
They think I've
totally lost my grip.

85
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,161
Can I help you?
Oh, yes.

86
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:09,164
Can I have a hot tea, please?

87
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:11,449
I'd just like a large cup
of mocha powder.

88
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,951
David Bowie's incredibly
eccentric.

89
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:14,753
Um, we don't take euros.

90
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,756
So, Honey Badger, last week,
I had a revelation.

91
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,424
Now, as you may
or may not know,

92
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,658
the Middle East is in chaos.

93
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,043
You know what started it all?

94
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:23,828
No. A little Web site
called Wikileaks.

95
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,213
You ever hear of them?

96
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:27,515
Well, they let loose
with a couple of rumors.

97
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,117
So I told Figgins

98
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:31,219
I wanted to resuscitate
<i>The Muckraker.</i>

99
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:33,288
But the school newspaper was
discontinued two years ago,

100
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:35,506
due to lack of interest.

101
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:37,559
The newspaper is making
a comeback at this school,

102
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:38,860
and like print
newspapers everywhere,

103
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:40,228
we're leaner
and meaner--

104
00:03:40,313 --> 00:03:43,281
no longer concerned
with facts, fact-checking,

105
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,849
integrity or facts.

106
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,985
<i>The Muckraker</i> motto?

107
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:50,538
"If I heard it, it's probably
true or something."

108
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:52,824
Sorry, but did you just
change disguises?

109
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,026
I'm pretty sure that
barista's onto me.

110
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:56,828
Now I'm Ann Coulter.

111
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,048
As you may have noticed,
I'm coming slightly unhinged.

112
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:01,699
Ohio loves you, Ann Coulter!

113
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:04,702
That's better.
(sighs with relief)

114
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:07,222
Can I make an observation?

115
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:10,258
You're always trying to destroy
Will from inside the Glee Club.

116
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:14,212
But I would like to try getting
him <i>out</i> of the Glee Club.

117
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:18,733
Now, I was trolling the Internet
last night and I had an idea.

118
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:20,518
I'll drink to that.

119
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:26,891
(school bell ringing)

120
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:28,827
Excuse me.

121
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,413
Do you know
where a gal can find

122
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,164
a pipin' hot cup of
Will Schuester?

123
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:36,904
Oh, my God! April!

124
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:38,606
What are you doing here?

125
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:40,190
I thought you were on Broadway!

126
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:44,311
I was! My all-white production of
<i>The Wiz</i> was a disaster.

127
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:45,613
- Oh, April, I'm so sorry.
- Don't be!

128
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:48,415
Being publicly humiliated
by the <i>New York Times</i>

129
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:49,867
gets me to thinking--

130
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:52,836
why am I weighing myself down
with the "Broadway classics"?

131
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:54,175
I should just tell my own story.

132
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:55,460
So I wrote the libretto

133
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,425
to <i>Crossrhodes!</i>
<i>The April Rhodes Story.</i>

134
00:04:58,493 --> 00:04:59,627
You're writing a musical?

135
00:04:59,678 --> 00:05:01,629
Yep. That's why I'm here.

136
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,965
So, Will, remember how
I bought you your auditorium?

137
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:05,966
Oh, yeah.

138
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:09,491
Well, I'm gonna need to borrow it
cause I'm running a little low on funds.

139
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:12,222
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

140
00:05:12,307 --> 00:05:14,341
Get your <i>Muckraker</i> here.

141
00:05:14,392 --> 00:05:15,943
Extra! Extra!
Get your <i>Muckracker</i> here!

142
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,678
Hey. I think we should talk
about Nationals.

143
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:19,279
We need to do a duet.

144
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:20,702
I don't think that's a good idea.

145
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:22,182
Why are you so concerned

146
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,517
with Quinn's feelings

147
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:25,290
when she obviously has
no interest in yours?

148
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,537
What are you talking about?

149
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:28,188
Haven't you read <i>The Muckraker?</i>

150
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:29,573
It's our school's newspaper.

151
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:33,043
Look at the "Blind Items" column.

152
00:05:33,073 --> 00:05:34,432
"What prom queen candidate is spending

153
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:35,967
a lot of time in her closet?"

154
00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:37,669
Now that's garbage.
Quinn's claustrophobic.

155
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:39,852
No, that's Santana. Read the next one.

156
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:45,306
What the hell is this, dude?

157
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:48,947
"What blondie former cheerleader is having
"a secret Moonlight Motel rendezvous

158
00:05:48,977 --> 00:05:51,232
- with another big-lipped blondie?"
- Where does it say that?

159
00:05:51,262 --> 00:05:52,734
Right on the front page
of the school newspaper!

160
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:54,402
You don't seriously
believe this, do you?

161
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:57,238
Well, why shouldn't I? Why wouldn't he
do the same thing that I did to him?

162
00:05:57,268 --> 00:05:58,123
Because it's gossip, Finn.

163
00:05:58,153 --> 00:05:59,820
This is your fault!

164
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:01,739
You told everyone that I played

165
00:06:01,823 --> 00:06:04,758
for another team on your
ridiculous melted cheese show.

166
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:06,531
Wait. Are you mad?
You <i>do</i> play for another team.

167
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:09,417
You were on the Cheerios! And now
you're only in the New Directions.

168
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,586
And you couldn't have thought
of any other way to say that?

169
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:13,705
I swear I'm going to
punch your face off!

170
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:15,873
Hey, you got a lot of nerve
accusing me of cheating

171
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:18,209
when you're the one who
snuck in and stole my girl!

172
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:20,061
Hey! Hey, Finn, where are you going?

173
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:22,026
Hey, we got rehearsal! Not today!

174
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:31,051
Dinner is served.

175
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:32,970
(giggles)

176
00:06:33,054 --> 00:06:35,193
I thought you volunteered
to make dinner.

177
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:37,524
Well, Mama drinks her dinner these days!

178
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:38,842
Honk!

179
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:41,895
Uh... (chuckles) can I be
blunt with you, April?

180
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:43,084
(Glasses clink)

181
00:06:43,114 --> 00:06:47,501
I think any show about April Rhodes

182
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:49,765
should be about your emotional journey.

183
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:52,939
Oh.

184
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:54,796
Hadn't really thought of that.

185
00:06:57,128 --> 00:06:59,267
I forget what a good
teacher you are, Will.

186
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:02,716
Thanks.

187
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:04,719
And lately, I don't feel like it.

188
00:07:04,753 --> 00:07:06,808
I mean, there's just so much drama in

189
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:08,860
the Glee Club right
now-- more than usual.

190
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,095
A lot of whispering and
backstabbing and love triangles

191
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,761
and questions of sexuality--

192
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:16,100
Sounds like your club's
got a touch of the Mac.

193
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,898
The what? Fleetwood Mac?

194
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:19,320
They fought all the time!

195
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,635
There was affairs and divorces

196
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:23,687
and whispers and gossip.

197
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:26,110
All the stuff that made
good bands break up.

198
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,464
But they put all that drama
to good use and wrote great music.

199
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:32,979
You know, I think I might have
<i>Rumours</i> on LP somewhere.

200
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:34,915
Oh, everybody does.

201
00:07:34,982 --> 00:07:36,888
I mean, I don't. I sold mine for drugs.

202
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:38,502
Kidding! Ha! Nope.

203
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:40,003
I actually did that.

204
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:41,505
Here we go.

205
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:44,675
You know, I've wanted to
do a whole lesson devoted

206
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,295
to a single album for a long time.

207
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:51,431
You know, this is a
really good idea, April.

208
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:53,801
And I'm here to help.

209

<i>Rumours--</i> a classic
record by Fleetwood Mac.

234
00:09:54,896 --> 00:09:56,751
One of the greatest albums of all time.

235
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:59,108
Written as the band
was breaking apart...

236
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:00,698
to keep it together.

237
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:04,538
Now, this week, we are done with
the backstabbing and the gossip,

238
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:07,760
and we're channeling all that
energy into working together.

239
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:11,361
So, pick a song from the album,
put your own spin on it.

240
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:12,863
Simple as that.

241
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:23,151
What's going on with you and Santana?

242
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:24,369
Nothing.

243
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:27,372
It doesn't sound like nothing.
It sounds like something,

244
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:28,811
which is almost always
more than nothing.

245
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:30,479
(Chuckles) I'm down, Artie.

246
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:31,843
Are you cheating on me with her?

247
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:34,691
No, of course not. I mean...
I can't. She's a girl.

248
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,560
Fooling around with her isn't cheating.

249
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,301
It's just friends talking with
their tongues super close.

250
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:39,849
- Who told you that?
- Santana.

251
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,911
Don't you see that
she's manipulating you?

252
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,448
That's not cheating either.
She told me that.

253
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:45,373
Do you see what's going on here?

254
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:46,929
You're the hottest girl in this school,

255
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:49,586
and I wear saddle shoes
on legs that don't work.

256
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:52,353
This shouldn't be happening.

257
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:53,985
Not because I'm in a wheelchair

258
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:55,576
but because I'm obsessed
with Angry Birds

259
00:10:55,628 --> 00:10:56,878
and my mom cuts my hair.

260
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:57,998
I like your haircut.

261
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,307
It's hard enough for me to
believe that this is real.

262
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,799
If I know that you spend even

263
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,845
a little time sharing
yourself with someone else...

264
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,679
that there's one other person in
your life that can provide

265
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,879
for you the things that
I'm supposed to provide,

266
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:14,382
it's just too much
for me to take.

267
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:16,830
And Santana knows that.

268
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,117
She's taking advantage of it
to break us up.

269
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:21,736
No. Everybody thinks she's
a bad person, but she's not.

270
00:11:21,787 --> 00:11:23,404
God, Brittany,
why are you so stupid?!

271
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,064
You were the only person at this school
that never called me that!

So exciting.

287
00:13:41,811 --> 00:13:43,512
It's like an episode
of <i>Hart to Hart.</i>

288
00:13:43,563 --> 00:13:45,514
No, this is not fun or cool.

289
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:47,715
Then why did you agree
to do it?

290
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:50,685
Because Quinn cheated
on me with Puck,

291
00:13:50,753 --> 00:13:52,571
and then she cheated
on Sam with me.

292
00:13:52,655 --> 00:13:54,940
I just want to be sure.

293
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:57,526
I never understood why
you got back with her.

294
00:13:57,577 --> 00:14:00,228
I mean, if you can't
even trust her.

295
00:14:02,031 --> 00:14:05,383
I don't know.

296
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:07,369
I do.

297
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,254
Because you forgive
your first love anything.

298
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:15,410
Do you believe in that
thing called karma?

299
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:16,711
Uh, yeah.

300
00:14:18,197 --> 00:14:19,981
Can you explain it to me?

301
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:23,135
Uh, well, it's the law
of physics

302
00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:24,603
whereby, for example,

303
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:26,138
if you do something
to hurt someone,

304
00:14:26,222 --> 00:14:28,273
well, then the laws
of the universe will work

305
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:29,641
against you until you get hurt.

306
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:30,942
While we're here,
have you given

307
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:32,561
any thought to my duet ideas?

308
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:44,673
I can't believe Kurt
would do that to Blaine.

309
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,418
What do we know
about Sam anyway?

310
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:57,588
I mean, what town is he from?
What state?

311
00:14:58,084 --> 00:14:59,255
What's his old school like?

312
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:01,390
Maybe he's a serial killer.
You guys,

313
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,759
I'm telling you,
Kurt wouldn't cheat on Blaine.

314
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,344
It's just like
the <i>Rumours</i> album.

315
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:07,813
I mean, being apart or on the
road is hard for two artists.

316
00:15:07,898 --> 00:15:09,732
Performers have this "love the
one you're with" mentality.

317
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,350
I mean, look at all of us.

318
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:13,069
Look at all the different
combinations that we've had.

319
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,654
Finnchel, Puckleberry.

320
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:16,853
McTina Cohen Chang-Chang.
Artittany.

321
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:17,973
Pizes.

322
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:21,494
Guys, we're sitting here
squabbling over what? A rumor.

323
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:23,440
Finn's right.
We need more information.

324
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,613
I don't want to get into it,

325
00:15:25,113 --> 00:15:27,773
but all I'm gonna say...
Sam's not gay.

326
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:37,525
God, I'm so sad.

327
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:40,520
Like a sad little panda.

328
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:42,576
Well, that's why
I brought you here...

329
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:45,166
to cheer you up.

330
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:47,034
I've been going through
that <i>Rumours</i> album

331
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:48,682
and I found the best song
that really goes

332
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,588
one step past "Landslide"

333
00:15:50,673 --> 00:15:52,974
in expressing my
feelings for you.

334
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,377
My... private feelings.

335
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:58,179
What about him?

336
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,951
He's just furniture.

337
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:01,940
Sorry. No offense.

338
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,184
Hit it.

339
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:05,937

Okay, so why couldn't you

362
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:11,610
sing that to me
in front of everyone

363
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:13,195
now that Artie and I
aren't together?

364
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,790
No, not-not yet.

365
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:18,450
I'm not ready for that type
of public announcement.

366
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:20,619
Ever since
that <i>Muckraker</i> thing,

367
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,288
people have already started
treating me differently.

368
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,307
I got asked
to join the golf team.

369
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:27,426
Well, what if I went first?

370
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:30,252
Come on <i>Fondue for Two.</i>

371
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:32,230
I'll ask you out to prom

372
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,299
and I'll tell you how I feel,

373
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:36,919
and all you have
to do is say yes.

374
00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:39,545
Okay.

375
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:41,059
Yeah.

376
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:58,146
Stop it.

377
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,980
Stop what?

378
00:18:59,064 --> 00:19:00,531
I am begging you. Sam is cute,

379
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,932
but he's not worth losing
Blaine over.

380
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:03,568
Oh, how I've missed
your insanity.

381
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:05,153
He's wearing your jacket, Kurt.

382
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:07,572
I remember that jacket.
You wore it April of last year.

383
00:19:07,623 --> 00:19:09,240
You said it was
your Earth Day jacket

384
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,042
because it was made out
of recycled hemp.

385
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,543
I know how these things work.

386
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:14,162
I remember when Finn
and I used to date.

387
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:15,946
Sometimes he would leave his
letterman jacket at my house,

388
00:19:15,998 --> 00:19:17,632
and I'd wear it to
school the next day.

389
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:20,284
Okay, you need to bone up on
your Fleetwood Macology.

390
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:21,469
When they made <i>Rumours,</i>

391
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:22,753
they weren't speaking
to each other.

392
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:25,089
Not even "Pass the
nondairy creamer."

393
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,008
They only spoke
about the music.

394
00:19:27,092 --> 00:19:28,593
And it was that focus
that allowed them

395
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:29,793
to make their masterpiece.

396
00:19:29,845 --> 00:19:31,062
You're deflecting.

397
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,231
No, I'm being a team player,
and any minute spent

398
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,349
on this vicious, hurtful
and hateful gossip

399
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:38,319
is a minute taken away
from preparing for Nationals.

400
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:47,862
Why would she say that thing
about Sam not being gay?

401
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,664
She was so sure about it.

402
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,682
Well, they did date.

403
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,001
Yeah, but the way
she said it--

404
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:55,620
there was something
else going on.

405
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:59,790
The problem with dating Quinn,
besides the mood swings,

406
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:01,676
is that she's so...

407
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,911
protective about her feelings.

408
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:06,364
You never quite know where
you stand with her.

409
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:08,216
Girls like that do that
to keep their power.

410
00:20:08,283 --> 00:20:09,617
You never did that.

411
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:11,602
I always knew what
you were thinking.

412
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,723

418

Mr. Shue, thank you
for being

419
00:20:36,143 --> 00:20:37,276
my first interview

420
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:38,494
for <i>The Muckraker.</i>
To be honest,

421
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:40,346
I had no idea you were
the journalist type.

422
00:20:40,414 --> 00:20:42,314
Yeah, I have a talk show on
the Internet,

423
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,250
and the comments say that
my questions are too gossipy.

424
00:20:44,318 --> 00:20:46,035
So I joined

425
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,537
the school newspaper to learn

426
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,705
to ask the more hard-hitting
questions.

427
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,089
That's fantastic, Brittany.

428
00:20:50,157 --> 00:20:53,009
So, question one:
boxers or briefs?

429
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:56,429
Uh, boxers.

430
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:57,797
Cool.

431
00:20:57,848 --> 00:20:59,999
Okay, question two:
pantyhose or lace panties?

432
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,018
I just said boxers.

433
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:03,553
Yeah, well, that wasn't
one of the choices,

434
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,288
so I'll just write that you
refused to answer the question.

435
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:07,774
Brittany, these questions <i>are</i>
sort of gossipy.

436
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:10,009
Okay, what age did you start
waxing your back?

437
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,362
Brittany, I don't think these
questions are very appropriate.

438
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:14,013
Well, hard-hitting journalism is
about asking the questions

439
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,415
that people really want to know.

440
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,784
Um, we need to address
some rumors.

441
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:20,403
How many students
have you had affairs with?

442
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,322
Wait...
There's a rumor about that?

443
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:24,574
There probably will be now

444
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,375
since you didn't really
answer the question.

445
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:26,659
None!

446
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,261
Is it the truth
or are you lying? Like when

447
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,880
you didn't give me a straight
answer about the lacy panties.

448
00:21:30,964 --> 00:21:33,299
Brittany, I'm sorry, but I need
to work on some songs.

449
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:35,418
Are they songs for April Rhodes'
one-woman show?

450
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,536
Yes. Is it because you're
leaving the New Directions?

451
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,372
What?! Because there's a rumor
that you'd rather be on Broadway

452
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,674
than coaching the Glee Club.

453
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:43,676
Brittany, who gave you
these questions to ask me?

454
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:45,728
Coach Sylvester said I'm
not at liberty to say.

455
00:21:45,796 --> 00:21:47,764
She told me this before she
finished writing these questions.

456
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,182
I thought so.

457
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:52,985
All right, Muckrakers, the rumor
mill is up and running.

458
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:54,153
On to lesson two.

459
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,372
Making... stuff... up.

460
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,392
Jacob, I want you to squeeze
this toothpaste into your hand.

461
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,328
Now put it back in.

462
00:22:02,395 --> 00:22:03,863
Um, I can't.

463
00:22:03,914 --> 00:22:05,498
Exactly.

464
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:08,618
Oh, no, I didn't! Oh!

465
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,236
SUE:
Fantastic, Azimio.

466
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,422
Now my point, ladies
and gentlemen, is that

467
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:14,540
once a story is out,
it's out forever.

468
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:16,542
You can't put it back in.

469
00:22:16,593 --> 00:22:19,212
All right, Muckrakers,
we have a deadline.

470
00:22:19,263 --> 00:22:20,179
(bell ringing) All right,
get out of my classroom.

471
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:21,214
Get out of here!

472
00:22:21,265 --> 00:22:24,050
Brett.
Sue, what are you doing?

473
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:25,968
Why are you spreading rumors
that I'm leaving McKinley?

474
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,104
Well, William, I'm sure
you don't dispute

475
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:30,723
that legendary bratwurst
gobbler April Rhodes is in town

476
00:22:30,774 --> 00:22:33,059
and you're helping her
get back to Broadway.

477
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,610
Am I right?
Of course.

478
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:35,762
But it doesn't mean
I'm leaving the school.

479
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:39,098
Let me ask you
something, Will: Why?

480
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,718
You know what they say,
"Those who can't, teach."

481
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:45,621
Turns out
maybe you actually can.

482
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:48,624
Think about that next time you
prop your butt chin up on

483
00:22:48,692 --> 00:22:50,276
one of those
tiny little face toilets.

484
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,295
Look at it this way, Will.

485
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:53,779
You'd finally be rid of me.

486
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:00,395
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!

487
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,230
Get you <i>Muckraker</i> here!

488
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,314
I vote for Quinn.

489
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:05,516
Bite me, Fabray.

490
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:12,918
Finn.

491
00:23:13,496 --> 00:23:14,880
Wait, why are you storming?

492
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:16,999
I'm the one
who should be storming.

493
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,851
Really? Because the way
I see it, I'm the stormer

494
00:23:18,936 --> 00:23:20,169
and you should be the stormee.

495
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,171
According to today's paper,
"Finn and Rachel

496
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:25,107
were seen sitting closely, laughing, talking
intimately." We were on a stakeout.

497
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:27,176
What were you doing
with him in that motel?

498
00:23:27,227 --> 00:23:28,644
I'm not cheating on you.

499
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:30,279
This time around,
I haven't and I won't.

500
00:23:30,347 --> 00:23:32,014
You have to learn to trust me.

501
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:33,566
I can't trust you
if you won't tell me the truth.

502
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,984
Well, what were you and Rachel
doing together, huh?

503
00:23:35,035 --> 00:23:37,370
Staking out. That's what
you do on a stakeout.

504
00:23:37,454 --> 00:23:39,238
What were you talking about?
Glee Club, okay?

505
00:23:39,323 --> 00:23:41,377
She wants to do
a duet with me. That's all. Trust me.

506
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,297
Well, then I guess we both have
to learn to trust each other.

507
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:46,297
- I guess so. - And I guess I know what song
we'll be singing this week in Glee Club

532
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:23,768
Okay! Terrific job, guys.

533
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,203
Um, might want to try to smile

534
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:27,122
a little bit more
next time, though.

535
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,990
Yeah. It was lovely,
but I prefer

536
00:25:29,075 --> 00:25:31,059
Quinn's duet performance
of "Lucky" with Sam better.

537
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:33,712
Since you and Sam have become
a lot closer lately, maybe

538
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:34,779
you guys should do duets
together more often.

539
00:25:34,831 --> 00:25:35,881
Where is Sam?

540
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:37,616
Quinn and Kurt
are both here today,

541
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:38,800
so we know he's not
doing the dirty.

542
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:40,585
I know what you're doing.

543
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:41,837
You want Finn and I
to stop singing together

544
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:43,722
so that you can sing
with him again.

545
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:45,640
Frankly, yes. Finn and I have
amazing proven harmonies.

546
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:46,892
And when it comes to Nationals,

547
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,226
I think it makes more sense

548
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:49,344
for him to be paired with me.

549
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:50,979
Well, it's not happening.

550
00:25:51,063 --> 00:25:52,597
Not as long as Finn wants
to be with me.

551
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:55,150
Wait, I thought you said this
relationship was about trust.

552
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:58,487
Oh, I trust you.
I just don't trust her.

553
00:25:58,571 --> 00:25:59,821
Quinn, I don't think
you can mandate

554
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:01,523
who pairs up for
Nationals, all right?

555

Vocal Adrenaline doesn't need
any help from us.

I love being here,
and I want to win,

557
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,979
but my relationship
comes first.

558
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:09,698
I'm sorry, but Finn,

559
00:26:09,782 --> 00:26:12,584
if you want to be with me,
no more songs with her.

560
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:14,085

I mean, it was emotional,
it was funny, it was...

It's you.

Oh, do this with me, Will.

Help me take this
show to Broadway.

I'm flattered, but I have
to take the kids to Nationals.

Yes.
Will, that's their dream.

00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:36,117
Yes, at one point,
it was yours and mine,

but look where that got us.

Hi. I'm Brittany.

00:28:00,893 --> 00:28:03,361
Welcome to <i>Fondue for Two.</i>

598
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:06,565
My guest today was supposed
to be Santana,

599
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:08,483
but she texted
about an hour ago,

600
00:28:08,568 --> 00:28:10,118
and it just said, "I can't."

601
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:12,571
So, show must go on.

602
00:28:12,622 --> 00:28:15,373
Um, I will be interviewing
Lord Tubbington.

603
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:17,075
Question one:

604
00:28:17,143 --> 00:28:19,327
Do you think <i>The Aristocats</i>
is an accurate portrayal

605
00:28:19,412 --> 00:28:21,379
of the feline relationship?

(purring)

607
00:28:22,615 --> 00:28:24,132
You know, just because

608
00:28:24,216 --> 00:28:25,901
we're doing this interview
doesn't mean

609
00:28:25,968 --> 00:28:28,136
I'm still not mad at you.

610
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:30,255
'Cause I know
you started smoking again.

(school bell ringing)

613
00:28:43,773 --> 00:28:45,931
Emma, did you wash those grapes
at home?

614
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:47,045
I just rinsed them.

615
00:28:47,055 --> 00:28:48,172
Yeah, I put the whole bunch

616
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,623
in a colander,

617
00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:51,558
and I just let the cold water
run right over them.

618
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:53,627
For a half hour or so.

619
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:55,896
Still, Emma, that's amazing.

620
00:28:55,963 --> 00:28:57,181
I've been, um,

621
00:28:57,265 --> 00:28:58,932
taking my medication
for a couple of weeks.

622
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:03,387
I'm so proud of you, Emma.

623
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:04,805
You inspired me, Will--

624
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:06,156
to make a change,

625
00:29:06,224 --> 00:29:09,142
to take charge
of my own destiny.

626
00:29:09,194 --> 00:29:11,945
And now I want the
same thing for you.

627
00:29:11,996 --> 00:29:14,815
Um, I don't understand.

628
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:16,950
I snuck in and saw you and April
singing the other day.

629
00:29:17,001 --> 00:29:19,086
You're good, Will.

630
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:21,955
Really, you have
a gift, you know,

631
00:29:22,023 --> 00:29:24,130
and if April is offering you

632
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,208
the opportunity to use that gift

633
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:29,812
on the big stage, you have to say yes.

634
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:32,485
I-I can't see April's show
lighting the town on fire.

635
00:29:32,515 --> 00:29:35,768
Well, but it's a chance,
on a real Broadway stage.

636
00:29:36,563 --> 00:29:38,124
And who knows who's
gonna come and see it,

637
00:29:38,154 --> 00:29:39,659
what great notices you might get.

638
00:29:40,837 --> 00:29:42,741
You deserve to at least try this, Will.

639
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,580
Yeah. I...

640
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:52,368
I can't do that to the kids.

641
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,921
Not now. We...

642
00:29:57,217 --> 00:29:59,875
We've all worked so hard,
and we're so close.

643
00:30:01,261 --> 00:30:02,378
(laughing)

644
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:03,595
Ah.

645
00:30:03,663 --> 00:30:04,880
(sighs)

646
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:07,619
Why are you crying?

647
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,054
The kids.

648
00:30:15,217 --> 00:30:16,091
You.

649
00:30:17,511 --> 00:30:18,911
You all saved my life.

650
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:22,431
Got me out
of a terrible marriage.

651
00:30:22,482 --> 00:30:24,633
You helped me find
my passion again.

652
00:30:26,769 --> 00:30:28,620
I just don't want to lose you.

653
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,970
But, Emma...

654
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:38,747
...I want to go so badly.

655
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:41,967
(quiet laugh)

656
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:44,336
(school bell rings)

657
00:30:44,421 --> 00:30:46,634
All right, guys.

658
00:30:46,664 --> 00:30:47,456
Who is up first today?

659
00:30:47,507 --> 00:30:50,113
RACHEL: Signor Schuester,
if it's all right with you,

660
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:53,099
I'd like to do my own reinterpretation
of my favorite Fleetwood Mac song.

661
00:30:53,129 --> 00:30:54,480
Great, Rachel. Which one?

662
00:30:54,564 --> 00:30:55,797
"Go Your Own Way."

663
00:30:55,827 --> 00:30:57,153
It's the song about the painful breakup

664
00:30:57,183 --> 00:30:59,735
between Lindsay Buckingham
and Stevie Nicks.

665
00:30:59,802 --> 00:31:01,908
Traditionally, it's sung
by a man, but today,

666
00:31:01,938 --> 00:31:05,044
Rachel Berry's gonna put her own
feminine twist on it. Hit it.

667
00:31:05,074 --> 00:31:06,966

Brilliant! Good job, guys.

697
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,739
QUINN: Don't you think
it's maybe a little inappropriate that

698
00:33:16,824 --> 00:33:19,158
you chose to sing a love song to my guy?

699
00:33:19,226 --> 00:33:20,276
You're such a hypocrite!

700
00:33:20,306 --> 00:33:21,799
You Little Miss Perfect Prom Queen!

701
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:23,702
You're a cheater who cheats
in cheap motels with Sam.

702
00:33:23,732 --> 00:33:26,132
Nothing is going on between Sam and I.

703
00:33:26,162 --> 00:33:28,743
Enough, guys. You know,
I blame Sam for all of this.

704
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,258
And Rachel, too, I blame her.
What did <i>I</i> do?

705
00:33:31,288 --> 00:33:32,640
I'm sure you did something.
See, I'm with Santana.

706
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,729
I mean, why doesn't Sam have anything
to say about this? MIKE: Guilt.

707
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:36,889
Seriously, dude,
what you're doing is not cool.

708
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:39,549
- They both have boyfriends.
- Shut up! Look,

709
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:42,205
I'm not messing around with Quinn
or Kurt or any one of those guys.

710
00:33:42,235 --> 00:33:44,303
- They're just helping me.
- Oh, is <i>that</i> what we're calling it now?

711
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:47,419
Hold on. How were they helping you out?

712
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:51,224
Kurt was bringing me
some clothes, and Quinn

713
00:33:51,254 --> 00:33:53,434
was helping me baby-sit my
little brother and sister.

714
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,066
Then why were you in that motel?

715
00:33:55,096 --> 00:33:56,427
Because that's where I live now.

716
00:33:57,311 --> 00:33:59,935
My dad lost his job a few months ago,
then we lost our house, so now we live

717
00:33:59,965 --> 00:34:01,765
in that motel in one room.

718
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:04,886
Are you all happy?

719
00:34:08,762 --> 00:34:10,612
The truth's finally out.

720
00:34:13,195 --> 00:34:14,529
(school bell rings)

721
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:24,590
Thanks for the invite, ladies.

722
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:27,080
You know what I call an afternoon
where I'm getting drunk?

723
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,697
An afternoon. (Chuckling)

724
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:31,067
Is there protein powder
in this margarita?

725
00:34:31,097 --> 00:34:33,366
And a wee bit of placenta.

726
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:36,173
Well, I'd like to propose
a toast to Terri Shuester,

727
00:34:36,203 --> 00:34:37,436
who still cares

728
00:34:37,487 --> 00:34:39,956
about her ex-husband
enough to call me up

729
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,245
and encourage me to
ask him for his help.

730
00:34:42,275 --> 00:34:45,244
Mm. It put a hm-mm
in my behind.

731
00:34:45,295 --> 00:34:48,084
But I don't think Will'll
be joining me on the tour.

732
00:34:48,114 --> 00:34:50,270
What? Why? Aw,
he can't leave those kids.

733
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,421
Doesn't know how to break it to 'em.

734
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:53,123
Blowsy Loads, you leave that to me.

735
00:34:53,153 --> 00:34:54,775
Tomorrow's <i>Muckraker</i> will include

736
00:34:54,805 --> 00:34:57,473
the ultimate blind-item
rumor that Will Shuester

737
00:34:57,557 --> 00:34:59,730
is leaving McKinley to
join you on Broadway.

738
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,010
That's not true.

739
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,449
It will be. That's the whole point

740
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:05,297
of yellow journalism--
turning rumor into fact.

741
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:06,649
And the hard part--

742
00:35:06,717 --> 00:35:08,822
breaking the news to the
kids-- will be over.

743
00:35:08,852 --> 00:35:10,490
He'll be free to follow his heart

744
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,009
and the stench of your alcohol sweat

745
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,522
to New York City

746
00:35:13,607 --> 00:35:15,111
and out of my life forever.

747
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:17,193
I don't know. Seems awfully shady.

748
00:35:17,277 --> 00:35:19,278
And I once became an Avon lady

749
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:21,168
just so I could rob demented seniors.

750
00:35:21,198 --> 00:35:23,599
Let's look at this way-- we all agree

751
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:26,590
Will Shuester has no business
teaching in a high school.

752
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,309
You believe he's too talented,
and I just hate him.

753
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:31,345
And I just want our old apartment back.

754
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:32,529
I'm living in an efficiency

755
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,064
with a raccoon in the wall.

756
00:35:34,094 --> 00:35:35,182
More placenta, anyone?

757
00:35:35,212 --> 00:35:37,263
(knocking)

758
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,104
Um, I'm trying to get
my sister to sleep.

759
00:35:41,134 --> 00:35:43,019
Dude, please, please.

760
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:44,637
Just let us in.

761
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:45,971
Hi. I'm Stacy.

762
00:35:46,023 --> 00:35:47,640
Hi, Stacy.

763
00:35:47,691 --> 00:35:49,058
I-I'm Rachel.

764
00:35:49,142 --> 00:35:50,476
This is Finn.
Hi.

765
00:35:50,527 --> 00:35:52,144
Well, she-she's up now.

766
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,987
It beats a cardboard box
underneath an underpass, right?

767
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:01,308
We keep the rest of our
stuff in my dad's car.

768
00:36:01,656 --> 00:36:05,200
- This is everything you own?
- We sold everything else.

769
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,475
- Can we go watch TV?
- Yeah, sure.

770
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:11,664
Keep it low, though. Signor Jensen,
next-door, is on the night shift again.

771
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:13,816
- You want a snack?
- All right.

772
00:36:13,846 --> 00:36:15,237
You, too. Get over there.

773
00:36:19,156 --> 00:36:20,204
I...

774
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:22,299
I don't understand. What happened?

775
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:26,459
We moved up here from Tennessee,
you know, 'cause my dad got a great...

776
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:28,223
job offer, and...

777
00:36:29,213 --> 00:36:32,655
the economy went to hell,
and it's last ones in, first ones out.

778
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:36,799
You know, we spent all our savings on the
move and the down payment on the house.

779
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:41,966
You know, when the bank takes your house,
they literally... take it.

780
00:36:41,996 --> 00:36:43,691
They come by one morning

781
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:45,846
and kick you out of your own house,

782
00:36:46,034 --> 00:36:47,329
just lock you out.

783
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,749
Why didn't you tell
us what was going on?

784
00:36:49,803 --> 00:36:52,217
You see how information flies
around that school, right?

785
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:55,129
You think everyone would've just treated
me the same, after they found out?

786
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:57,327
I'd be even more of a freak.

787
00:36:57,441 --> 00:36:59,331
Kurt only found out because...

788
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:01,351
I got a job delivering pizzas at night

789
00:37:01,408 --> 00:37:03,598
- and happened to bring one to Dalton.
- Yeah...

790
00:37:03,674 --> 00:37:04,760
He told us.

791
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:06,703
Look, I brought these for you.

792
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,516
I know Kurt was trying
to help you out, bringing...

793
00:37:10,707 --> 00:37:15,121
some of his old clothes, but I don't really
think that sequined riding pants are for you.

794
00:37:15,182 --> 00:37:17,601
So, uh, it's some of my old stuff.

795
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:18,833
Thanks.

796
00:37:19,214 --> 00:37:20,376
So...

797
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:22,299
what about...

798
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,576
Quinn?

799
00:37:23,937 --> 00:37:25,652
We go to the same church.

800
00:37:25,804 --> 00:37:29,330
Couldn't really hide it from her, and I kind of like
having her around to do some girl stuff with Stacy.

801
00:37:30,285 --> 00:37:33,798
Mom and Dad are out all day pounding
the pavement looking for work, but...

802
00:37:33,828 --> 00:37:34,875
Nothing.

803
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:37,451
I'm not sure if I'm gonna be
able to keep on the Glee Club.

804
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:39,291
What? N-No, you can't do that.

805
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:41,475
Yeah, we-we've come so far,

806
00:37:41,513 --> 00:37:44,927
and I-I know that it's a rough time
right now, but you can't quit.

807
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:47,345
You guys don't understand.

808
00:37:48,126 --> 00:37:49,174
Yes, we do.

809
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:06,949
Quinn told us you hocked your guitar.

810
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:15,258
Did you guys buy this back for me?

811
00:38:15,907 --> 00:38:17,651
The whole Glee Club did.

812
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,699
Look, Sam, we'll do
whatever we can to help,

813
00:38:20,737 --> 00:38:24,324
anything to keep you in the Glee Club
until you get back on your feet.

814
00:38:39,997 --> 00:38:41,788
First time I've cried.

815
00:38:45,178 --> 00:38:47,654
Don't cry, Sammy.

816
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,295
We need you, Sam.

817
00:38:51,114 --> 00:38:52,923
Ok? And you need the music.

818
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:58,531
Any comment on the vicious rumor
left on the <i>Muckraker</i> website

819
00:38:58,561 --> 00:39:01,788
about you and Karofsky
doing it in the backseat

820
00:39:01,818 --> 00:39:03,752
of a parked car in the
Holier Than Thou Cemetery?

821
00:39:03,895 --> 00:39:05,038
No comment.

822
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:09,417
Any comment on the fact when I looked up the I.
P. address of the person who posted the rumor

823
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,208
I found out it was you?

824
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:13,875
My computer was stolen.

825
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:17,080
Look, all I can say is that
Dave and I are going strong,

826
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:20,942
and we're very excited about our
Prom King and Queen campaign.

827
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,784
- Vote Santofsky.
- So you two are in love?

828
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,633
Soul mates, so to speak?

829
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:29,880
Yeah.

830
00:39:32,395 --> 00:39:33,918
I'd say that was accurate.

831
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,175
All right, <i>clase.</i>

832
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:44,446
Mr. Shue, is this true?

833
00:39:44,514 --> 00:39:47,417
Yeah, the <i>Muckraker</i> says you're
bailing on us to do April Rhodes' big show.

834
00:39:47,447 --> 00:39:48,476
Guys...

835
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:52,417
if there's anything we've learned from this week's assignment,
it's that you can't believe every rumor you hear.

836
00:39:52,447 --> 00:39:54,904
But isn't it your dream
to sing on Broadway?

837
00:39:55,114 --> 00:39:56,466
I have a lot of dreams.

838
00:39:56,581 --> 00:39:58,080
My top one...

839
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,004
being taking you guys
to Nationals.

840
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:03,193
- So you're gonna stay?
- Look, we are going to Nationals, together,

841
00:40:03,223 --> 00:40:04,633
and we are going to win.

842
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,843
Hey, everybody.

843
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:09,109
Kind of wanted to get these guys out of the motel for
a little while-- I hope it's ok if I brought them.

844
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:12,243
- Of course, of course. Yeah, come on in.
- I was also hoping that maybe...

845
00:40:12,472 --> 00:40:14,129
they could help out with a number today.

846
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:16,242
I have the perfect song
I want to sing to them,

847
00:40:16,272 --> 00:40:18,400
and don't worry, it's good
for the assignment, Mr. Shue.

848
00:40:19,048 --> 00:40:20,508
The more the merrier.

849
00:40:21,765 --> 00:40:23,879
