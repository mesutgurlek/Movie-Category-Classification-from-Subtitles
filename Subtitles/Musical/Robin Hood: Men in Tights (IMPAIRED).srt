Uh- No.

Sorry,
but a toll is a toll,

510
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,724
and a roll is a roll,

511
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:42,186
and if we don't get no tolls,
then we don't eat no rolls.

00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:51,151
Careful, Robin.
You go too far.
I've only just begun.

638
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:54,988
I've come to warn you
that if you do not stop
levying these evil taxes,

639
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:59,368
I shall lead
the good people of England
in a revolt against you.

640
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,454
And why should the people
listen to you?

641
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:06,166
Because, unlike
some other Robin Hoods,

642
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:09,711
I can speak
with an English accent.

Worry not, Your Highness.

of this feathered upstart.

put it on my bill.

wasn't your mole...

What is it?

00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:47,867
It's what we've named

We've been working on it
secretly for months.

798
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:55,667
It can hurl one
of these heavy boulders,
undetected,

799
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:59,629
over a hundred yards,
completely destroying
anything it hits.

800
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,548
Wow!
How does it work?
It's quite simple.

801
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,718
You just take one of these
heavy rocks, put it here
where I'm sitting,

802
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:07,679
and then pull
on that lever.

803
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,931
You mean, like this?
[Screaming]

804
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,934
[Screaming Continues]

805
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,228
Oh, Dear Lord,

806
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:19,315
if you see fit to send me
my one true love—

807
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,318
[Shouts, Grunts]

808
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:24,529
Thank you!

809
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:29,325
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

810
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,537
Oh, my God!
Here! Let me work
my magic on you!

811
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,581
[Whimpering]
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

812
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:38,292
No, no!
I've got a headache.
I've got a headache.

813
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:41,587
Where are you going?
Oh, bugger!

814
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,631
[Sighs]

815
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:45,675
I was that close.

816
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:49,637
I touched it.

817
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:59,105
I don't like the way
you're walking.

818
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,108
You've been into
the sacramental wine again.

819
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,193
You're farshnoshket!

820
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,779
You drunken mule, you.

821
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,911
Whoa, Morris, whoa.

822
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,913
Halt there, friend.

823
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:19,000
You’ve just entered
the territory of Robin Hood
and his Merry Men.

824
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,383
- Faigelehs?
- [All] No!

825
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:30,678
No, no, no, no.
We're straight,
just merry.

826
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:33,264
Azoy?
And who might you be,

827
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,850
with the exceptionally long
feather in your hat?

828
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:39,270
I am Robin of Loxley.
Robin of Loxley?

829
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,647
I've just come
from Maid Marian,

830
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:46,152
the lady whose heart you stole,
you prince of thieves, you.

831
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:52,325
I knew her mother and father
before they were taken
in the plague.

832
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,577
Lord and Lady Bagelle.

833
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,330
You were meant
for each other,
you and Maid Marian.

834
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,751
What a combination!
Loxley and Bagelle.
You can't miss.

835
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,754
And who are you, sir?

836
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,006
I am Rabbi Tuckman,

837
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:09,509
purveyor
of sacramental wine...

838
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:12,053
and mohel extraordinaire.

839
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:16,307
- Hello, Rabbi.
- Hello, boys.

840
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,185
Mohel. Don't believe
I've ever heard
of that profession.

841
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:23,940
Mohel?
He's a very important guy.
He makes circumcisions.

842
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:27,401
What, pray tell, sir,
is a circumcision?

843
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:31,489
Oh, it's the latest rage.
The ladies love it.
[Will] I want one!

844
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,991
I'll take two.
Put me down too.
I'm getting one.

845
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:37,370
I'm game.
How's it done?
It's a snap.

846
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,039
I take my little machine.

847
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,043
I take your
little thing, see?

848
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:46,546
I put it into
this little hole here,

849
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,173
and... nip the tip!

850
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:51,008
[Groaning]
Ow!

851
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:54,804
- Who's first?
- I changed me mind.

852
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:58,057
I forgot, man.
I already got one.
Christian.

853
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,560
I gotta work with
a much younger crowd.

854
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,855
Rabbi, you seem to be
on the side of good.

855
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:06,858
Will you join us
and share with us
some of your wisdom,

856
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:10,528
some of your counsel,
and, uh, perhaps...
some of your wine?

857
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,613
[Laughing]

858
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:14,907
Wisdom and counsel,
that's easy.

859
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:19,871
But this is sacramental wine.
It's only used to bless things.

860
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:22,915
[All Agreeing]

861
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,793
Wait a minute!

862
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:28,421
There's things here-
there's trees,
there's rocks,

863
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,715
there's birds,
there's squirrels.

864
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,218
Come on!
We'll bless them all
until we get farshnoshket!

865
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:37,096
- Join me!
- [Cheering]

866
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,724
Let's hear it
for the rabbi!

867
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:41,726
[Cheering]

868
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,863
Good evening,
Don Giovanni.
Yeah.

869
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:58,367
Buona sera.
Buona sera.

870
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:01,162
Yes. It was, uh,
very good of you to come
at such short notice.

871
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:04,582
Well.
And all the way
from Jersey.

872
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,168
Well, it is
quite a drive.

873
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:12,506
Yes, but you do realize that
Prince John expressly commanded
this to be a secret meeting?

874
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:15,259
I mean,
who are these men?

875
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:17,803
These are
my trusted associates.

876
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,223
On my right,
Dirty Ezio.

877
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:27,313
On my left,
Filthy Luca.

878
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:31,692
Now.
We thank you
for inviting us...

879
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:35,613
on the day
of your daughter's wedding.
No, no.

880
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:39,242
I hope her first child
is a masculine child.

881
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,911
Shut up. We didn't
even have our meeting yet.

882
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:44,538
Oh, yeah.
[Don Giovanni]
Oh, yeah.

883
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,041
[Groans]

884
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,043
All right.

885
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:52,630
I understand that you have
been bothered by this fruit,
Robin Hood.

886
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:55,716
That you want Robin
rubbed out,

887
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:58,594
eliminated,
maybe even killed.

888
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:01,389
Yes.
You put it succinctly.

889
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:05,434
Suck what?
Succinctly.
It means perfectly.

890
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:07,436
Oh, yeah.
Well, I knew that.

891
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:10,439
[Nuts Cracking]

892
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,276
Excuse me, Don Giovanni.

893
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,778
Your lizard seems limp.

894
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,907
At my age, you know,
sometimes-

895
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:22,285
Oh, oh, my lizard.
Oh! No.

896
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,787
Nah, he’s just sleeping.
Charlie.

897
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,956
Charlie. Oh, Charlie.

898
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,711
Charlie, I could've been
somebody. I could have been
a contender.

899
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:34,588
You know, Charlie's—
Charlie's got bad breath.

900
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:36,173
[Lizard Urinating]

901
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:39,969
Oh! He got excited,
you know.

902
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,471
Come over here, Ezio.

903
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:46,100
Uh— Mmm, no.

904
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:50,021
Now, normally
I would be so happy
to be of service to you,

905
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:53,607
but there is something
that weighs very heavily
on my heart.

906
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:57,445
In the years
that we have been friends,
England and Jersey,

907
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:01,615
never once have you
invited me to your home
for coffee and cake...

908
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:05,286
or ganool, something,
you know.
A "guh-what"?

909
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,913
A ganool.
It's a pastry
with stuffing.

910
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,374
And it's got sprinkles
on it. Mmm.

911
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:14,128
Excuse me.
I don't understand
a word you're saying.

912
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:18,382
I just came back
from the dentist,

913
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:22,720
and they left in
the cotton balls.

914
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:26,265
I will take these cotton balls
from you with my hand...

915
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:29,769
and put them in my pocket.

916
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:35,191
Yeah. Whatever.

917
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,443
You know, your other associate
says very little.

918
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:39,779
Well, my other associate
says nothing.
Why is that?

919
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:43,199
Because my enemy
cut out his tongue.

920
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:45,743
Good grief!
Why?

921
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:49,497
Well, 'cause he went
like this.
[Loud Blubbering]

922
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:52,875
And he didn't like it,
so he cut out his tongue.

923
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,002
Come over here.
Go like this.

924
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:57,004
[Tongue Clicks]

925
01:01:57,089 --> 01:02:00,299
[Laughs]
He can't do it.

926
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:04,261
I love to tease him!
[Laughs]

927
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:07,765
Tell me, Don Giovanni.
Yeah, that's me.
What?

928
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,767
What do you intend to do
about Robin Hood?

929
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,769
Listen to this.
I got an idea.

930
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:15,773
Tomorrow— Tomorrow you're
gonna have your medieval
fun and games.

931
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:18,901
You'll make
the most important event
the archery contest.

932
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:22,530
Robin will not be able
to resist.
Why is that?

933
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:25,491
We'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.

934
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,786
I was just gonna say that.

935
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,788
That's brilliant!
Thank you.

936
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,832
But-
What?

937
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:36,043
You do realize that Robin
is the finest archer
in the land?

938
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:38,295
Oh, no.
Don't you understand?

939
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,173
Luca is good,
better, best.

940
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:44,093
Show him
your archery medals.

941
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,095
Ta-da!

942
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:48,514
Wowee!

943
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,267
See? I couldn't
have said it better myself.

944
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:55,104
Now, Luca beats Robin
at the archery contest,

945
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:59,942
and then Dirty Ezio
makes Robin no more.

946
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:05,948
No more?
All right, you want
plain English?

947
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,576
Robin is gonna be dead.

948
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:12,288
D-E-D. Dead.

949
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:17,042
