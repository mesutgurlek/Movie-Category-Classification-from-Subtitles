I've been feelin' this life's a circus

2024
01:51:32,085 --> 01:51:34,485
Hangin' on without a fear

2025
01:51:34,621 --> 01:51:36,452
Yeah

2026
01:51:36,589 --> 01:51:39,183
Livin' on a high wire
Runnin' through a wildfire

2027
01:51:39,325 --> 01:51:42,055
You can't shake me
I'm not goin' nowhere

2028
01:51:42,195 --> 01:51:45,130
Walkin' on a tightrope
No net, high hopes

2029
01:51:45,265 --> 01:51:48,166
Step back. I'm gonna make it over

2030
01:51:48,301 --> 01:51:51,793
Na, na, na-na-na, na, na. Na, na

2031
01:51:51,938 --> 01:51:53,838
Livin' on a high wire

2032
01:51:53,973 --> 01:51:57,409
Na, na, na-na-na, na, na. Na, na

2033
01:51:57,544 --> 01:52:00,012
- Livin' on the high wire
- WEN: Gettin' used to the beat

2034
01:52:00,146 --> 01:52:01,738
Seein' that the heads are movin'

2035
01:52:01,881 --> 01:52:04,475
Move off your seat
Achievin's what we really doin'

2036
01:52:04,617 --> 01:52:06,949
Freedom of speech
I'm in it just to win it

2037
01:52:07,087 --> 01:52:08,714
I'm sprintin'. And I can see it in me

2038
01:52:08,855 --> 01:52:10,015
And that you can be it

2039
01:52:10,156 --> 01:52:13,023
'Cause it's patience, statements
Famous, greatness

2040
01:52:13,159 --> 01:52:16,185
Move until you make it through
And, baby, you can make it too

2041
01:52:16,329 --> 01:52:18,354
Livin' on a high wire

2042
01:52:18,998 --> 01:52:21,558
You can't shake me
I'm not goin' nowhere

2043
01:52:21,701 --> 01:52:24,602
Walkin' on a tightrope
No net, high hopes

2044
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:28,105
Step back, I'm gonna make it over

2045
01:52:28,241 --> 01:52:31,608
Na, na, na-na-na, na, na. Na, na

2046
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:33,178
Livin' on a high wire

2047
01:52:33,313 --> 01:52:34,541
Na, na, na-na-na, na, na. Na, na

2048
01:52:34,681 --> 01:52:37,115
WEN: Top story. Top story

2049
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:40,413
Livin' on a high wire

2050
01:52:40,887 --> 01:52:43,048
Yeah, yeah

2051
01:52:43,189 --> 01:52:44,520
Livin' on a high wire

2052
01:52:44,657 --> 01:52:46,420
Na, na, na-na-na, na, na. Na, na

2053
01:52:46,559 --> 01:52:48,288
We lookin'. We lookin' down now

2054
01:52:48,428 --> 01:52:51,625
Livin' on a high wire

2055
01:52:52,499 --> 01:52:54,592
Ladies and gentlemen, once again,

2056
01:52:54,734 --> 01:52:58,727
give it up for Lemonade Mouth.
This is why they're number one.

2057
01:52:58,872 --> 01:53:01,466
Thank you. Thank you so much
for coming on the show.

2058
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:03,667
Wow. Wow.

2059
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:05,801
Bye.
