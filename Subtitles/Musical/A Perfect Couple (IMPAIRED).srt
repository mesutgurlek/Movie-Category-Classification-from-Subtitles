Hey, you got a phone book in here?
Somebody tore all the goddamn pages out of mine.

You know, you better think about gettin' some
sleep. You got a lot of singin' to do tomorrow.

I can't sleep in there
with those guys.

I don't give a goddamn where you sleep.
Just go to sleep.

1052
01:34:10,787 --> 01:34:14,518
- Sydney, move over.
- Hey, Bobbi, what are you doing?

1053
01:34:14,592 --> 01:34:19,757
You cannot sleep in this bed. There's not enough
room. Anyway, she might get sick. Come on!

It was her heart, Alex.
You knew about her heart.

Your father considers

Lousa and you.

You are no longer alive to him, Alex.

You no longer exist
as a member of our family to anyone.

Under the circumstances...

it would be better to make things less painful
for everyone and just leave quietly.
