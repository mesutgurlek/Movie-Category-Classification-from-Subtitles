So, gentlemen, I urge you
to deliberate most carefully...

7
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,874
before reaching a decision
on so vital and momentous a question.

8
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,967
- Yes. Yes, of course.
- Mr. President.

9
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,707
I agree with our eminent professor
of metaphysics...

10
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,740
and I suggest that we postpone
further consideration of this-

11
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,412
- No, no! Definitely no!
- I object!

12
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,479
I must remind Professor Pillsbury...

13
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,717
that we cannot procrastinate further.

14
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,727
The press and public

15
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,729
We must act today.

- Now!
- Right. Right, right, right.

Mr. President.
Mr. President.

18
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,837
After careful
and scientific analysis...

19
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:22,397
it is the opinion
of the department of mathematics...

20
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:26,935
that Yale University
can beat the pants off Michigan.

21

- [Chuckling]
- I disagree.

22
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,573
Look at what Michigan's team
did to Northwestern.

23
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,279
- Ah!
- You still owe me 50 cents from that game.

24
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,345
- I do not, sir! I paid you.
- [Chuckling]

25
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,754
- You never paid me that 50 cents.
- I distinctly remember-

Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.

27
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,228

comes on Armistice Day...

just one week
before we play Harvard...

29
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,196
and we dare not risk facing
as strong a team as Michigan.

30
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,262
We must find a more
desirable opponent.

31
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,830
May I suggest Arkansas Normal?

32
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,571
I'm afraid not.
This game is for charity.

33
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,376
We cannot select too weak an opponent,
or no one will come to see it.

34
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,474
- [All Chattering]
- Then how about Nebraska?

35
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,020
- Oh, no!
- Definitely not.

- Texas?
- Yes.

38
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,959
Will you see that an invitation is sent
and that the newspapers are notified?

39
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,027
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

I'll say. They think a forward pass
is something a girl shouldn't make at a boy.

Maybe. Tell you when she gets in.
Aimin' to go someplace?

62
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,552
No. We're meeting the new football coach.
He's coming all the way from New York.

63
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,619
Boy, we're gonna have
a team this year.

We're gonna put T.S.U. on the map!

- Seen anything of Biff Bentley?
- No.

68
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,607
Fine thing if the captain
of the team isn't here.

69
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,544
We won't have much of a captain
if Sally Saxon doesn't let him alone.

70
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,946
Oh, here's Biff now!

71
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,451
Our captain's tackling
awfully high this season.

72
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,686

- Hiya, fellows. Sorry I'm late.

it was your engine knocking, darling.

- Hey, you two will have to cut that out.
- Jealous, Chippy dear?

77
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,306
Remember, Biff's in training.

78
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,070
Biff doesn't need any training.
He's perfect now.

79
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,771
You'll all have to toe the mark this season
with the new coach.

80
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,440
- Suits me. As long as he can teach us football.
- He will.

81

luring him away from Flushing.

- Sorry?

Not half as sorry as you're going to be for
dragging me out here to this forsaken desert!

Don't you go trying to teach him
how to play football.

- Enroll him? Holy smoke.

I crashed a brick through
