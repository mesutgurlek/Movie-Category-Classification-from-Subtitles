00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:46,943
("Deck the halls" playing)

484
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:53,859
- Happy holidays! 
- Happy holidays!

485
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:56,359
Baby bartenders. Cool.

486
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:58,011
The drinks are virgin. We watched, like,

487
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,030
17 YouTube videos on how to make them.

488
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:01,498
The kids think it's so cool

489
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,248
that their big brother works at a bar.

490
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:05,752
(Chuckles) You know,
romanticizing the working class

491
00:19:05,754 --> 00:19:08,930
perpetuates economic disparity. Right?

492
00:19:09,124 --> 00:19:10,428
I don't know.

493
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:12,486
I don't think that's what
your mother meant, Greg.

494
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:15,208
Yeah, there's nothing
wrong with working at a bar.

495
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:18,534
Though, if you don't want to and
you wanted to go back to school,

496
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:20,435
- Stew and I would be happy to contribute. 
- Yeah.

497
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:23,053
Again, I'm not taking
any money from you guys.

498
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,812
I'm not a freeloader. Like Mason and Lily.

499
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,316
That's not what I meant.

500
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:30,925
And-and Mason and Lily are children.

501
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,729
Are they?

502
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:35,315
(Video game sounds)

503
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:41,628
So, your fake tree looks so real.

504
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:42,652
It is real.

505
00:19:42,677 --> 00:19:44,343
Unlike some people's boobs.

506
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:47,285
Greg, my boobs are real.

507
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,940
Real expensive. (Laughs)

508
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:51,550

What? She's hilarious.

("We Wish you a Merry Christmas" playing)

512
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:03,927
Um, excuse me.

513
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,805
Are-are you Josh Chan?

514
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,496
Like, the Josh Chan?

515
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,517
- I guess so. 
- I knew it.

516
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,269
You were the captain of my high school's

517
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:14,604
'06 national championship
hip-hop team, right?

518
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:17,240
(Chuckles) I mean, I pass by
that trophy in the hallway,

519
00:20:17,242 --> 00:20:18,441
like, every single day.

520
00:20:18,443 --> 00:20:21,167
Wait, didn't you create the swoop bye-bye?

521
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:23,042
What, you mean this?
Ooh, pah-kah-kah-kah.

522
00:20:23,165 --> 00:20:24,915
(Whoops) Look,

523
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,783
um, I don't want to bother you,

524
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:28,752
but we're doing a show
for winter wonderland.

525
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:31,121
Would you want to come and
check it out? I mean, we still

526
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:32,873
do that number that you choreographed in

527
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,208
your senior year. Maybe you
could come a little early

528
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,309
and give us some tips.

529
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:37,834
Me? Give you tips?

530
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:40,034
I don't know if I'm qualified.

531
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:41,965

Swoop hello!

533
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:44,467
So you'll be there?

534
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:46,970
(Chuckles) I-I have work that day.

535
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:48,887
Double shift at Aloha Tech.

536
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:51,162
Man, adult stuff sucks.

537
00:20:51,443 --> 00:20:53,894
Yeah. Yeah. You'll see. (Chuckles)

538
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:56,863
Well, it was nice to meet you. Uh...

539
00:20:56,865 --> 00:20:58,859
So, uh, yeah, good luck with the show.

540
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,948
- Oh, thanks, Mr. Chan. 
- Oh, it's...

541
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:02,556
It's-it's just Josh.

542
00:21:02,581 --> 00:21:04,614
Okay, Mr. Josh.

543
00:21:07,793 --> 00:21:09,209
Rebecca: Um, so I know these

544
00:21:09,211 --> 00:21:11,461
latkes are frozen and, like, oblong,

545
00:21:11,463 --> 00:21:12,996
but they're pretty good.

546
00:21:12,998 --> 00:21:14,047
(Muffled): It's good.

547
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:15,916
- Mm-hmm. 
- You know, I went on a diet

548
00:21:15,918 --> 00:21:18,301
where I didn't eat
carbohydrates for months. Mm.

549
00:21:18,303 --> 00:21:19,920
And I looked fabulous,

550
00:21:19,922 --> 00:21:21,304
but I passed out at Bloomingdale's.

551
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:22,589
In the petite department.

552
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:24,007
(Both laugh)

Ooh.

Paula, I think

my mom is about to give
me the Garfinkel ring.

562
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:52,252
It's been passed down in
my family for generations,

usually every girl gets
it on her 18th birthday,

but I think I'm about to get it!

Oh, that stupid ring that your family

holds onto like a bunch of hobbits?

Do you really think that bitch
is finally gonna hand it over?

Dude, okay, she's not a bitch.

We're actually getting along.

571

I really think we've turned a corner

in our relationship somehow.

573
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:12,973
Oh, and that ring would be
the last seal of approval.

574
00:22:12,975 --> 00:22:16,893
It's that... that final
drop of mother's milk.

Oh! Wait, I have something for you.

580
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,822
Saw this at the mall, oh.

581
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:31,124
And I thought: Pretty and elegant,

582
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:32,909
just like my mom.

583
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:34,833
Thank you.

It's crystal.

- Rectal thermometer? 
- What?

587
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:46,723
(Laughs): No. No, no.
You put your rings on it.

588
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:48,758
Why would you put your rings
on a rectal thermometer?

589
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,093
Again, it's not... it's
not a rectal thermometer.

590
00:22:50,095 --> 00:22:51,094
Okay, never mind, never mind.

591
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:52,595
At least it looks expensive,

592
00:22:52,597 --> 00:22:55,265
and, uh, I'm going to, uh,

593
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:56,735
I'm gonna keep it.

594
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,342
And, uh...

595
00:22:58,546 --> 00:23:00,346
Now I've got a gift for you.

596
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:01,570
You do?

597
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:02,644
Ready?

598
00:23:02,657 --> 00:23:04,050
Uh-huh. Uh, yes.

599
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,286
- Oh. (Laughs) 
- Open it.

Okay.

601

Big.

602
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:20,123
Oh... I ran out this morning.

603
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,958
Now you have your own vase.

604
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,793
I need it. Wonderful.

605
00:23:23,795 --> 00:23:25,295
Thank you.

606
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:26,465
And...

607
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:30,266
I brought something else for you, too.

608
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:31,518
Really?

609
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,719
I brought it from home.

610
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:33,636
Yeah?

611
00:23:33,638 --> 00:23:34,746
But, um...

612
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:37,107
Maybe later.

613
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:38,191
Well, we can do it now.

614
00:23:38,193 --> 00:23:39,275
Right? We can do it...

615
00:23:39,277 --> 00:23:40,443
(Phone ringing) When...

616
00:23:40,445 --> 00:23:41,728
Later.

617
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,271
Uh, hold on. Hold on.

618
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:50,002
Uh... oh.

619
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,322
Who's that?

620
00:23:52,324 --> 00:23:53,823
He's easy on the eyes.

621
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:55,992
He's just a client.

622
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:57,994
But it's the holidays.
I don't have to answer.

623
00:23:57,996 --> 00:23:59,662
Let's go back to that ring.

624
00:23:59,664 --> 00:24:00,663
- I mean...
- (Stammering)

625
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:02,832
What? Client?

626
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:04,217
I mean, that's work. That's important.

627
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:05,502
No, no, please, go ahead.

628
00:24:05,504 --> 00:24:06,131
Okay.

629
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:08,740
I'll... I'll be just one second.

630
00:24:09,307 --> 00:24:10,306
Hi, Calvin.

631
00:24:10,308 --> 00:24:11,224
What's up?

632
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,175
I see.

633
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:14,015
You know, I'm... I'm with my mom right now,

634
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,073
so I can't.

635
00:24:15,268 --> 00:24:16,767
Okay. Bye.

636
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,375
That doesn't sound like a work thing.

637
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:20,258
That sounds like secret lover language.

638
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:21,359
It... no.

639
00:24:21,384 --> 00:24:22,715
So, he's a client,

640
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,897
and he had, um, an urgent
matter with a permit,

641
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,671
and he wanted to meet with me tonight,

642
00:24:27,696 --> 00:24:28,996
but I can't.

643
00:24:29,021 --> 00:24:30,220
During the holidays?

644
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:32,045
Doesn't he have a wife or anything?

645
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,185
He's actually a recent widower.

646
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,209
But I told him no,

647
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:35,650
so let's get back to you and me.

648
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,749
No, no, no, no, no, no.

649
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:37,834
You should go.

650
00:24:37,836 --> 00:24:39,335
What could be more important than work?

651
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:43,540
I mean, I feel like some
people would say... family?

652
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:44,841
You should go.

653
00:24:45,128 --> 00:24:46,127
I'll come with you!

654
00:24:46,955 --> 00:24:48,044
Okay.

655
00:24:48,046 --> 00:24:48,766
Great, great, great.

656
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:49,853
So what should I wear?

657
00:24:49,878 --> 00:24:51,577
Is he a boob man or a butt man?

658
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:57,504
(indistinct chatter)

659
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:00,483
I would love another glass of wine.

660
00:25:00,485 --> 00:25:01,700
Okay.

661
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:03,652
Mom, um, that'll be your second.

662
00:25:03,654 --> 00:25:04,820
Let's pace ourselves.

663
00:25:04,822 --> 00:25:07,573
Anyway, let's get back to my story.

664
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:11,160
So that is when I told my little Becca

665
00:25:11,473 --> 00:25:13,045
to close her legs

666
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:15,214
and stop getting to know

667
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:18,476
the whole Ivy league a Capella circuit.

668
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:19,617
(Laughs) ‭wh...

669
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:20,808
She's not great with metaphors.

670
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,216
When she says "getting to know""

671
00:25:22,241 --> 00:25:24,825
she means I was writing an
article on them for the crimson.

672
00:25:24,862 --> 00:25:26,445
So that baritone from Cornell

673
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,887
gave you HPV during an interview?

674
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,013
Mm-hmm. (Sighs)

675
00:25:31,015 --> 00:25:32,181
(Chuckling)

676
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:33,849
What a wonderful anecdote.

677
00:25:34,343 --> 00:25:36,018
Rebecca, I need to talk to you

678
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,187
about the zoning for the
property near the L.A. river.

679
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:40,523
We need to get that proposal
in before the new year.

680
00:25:40,525 --> 00:25:42,024
I totally agree, Cal...

681
00:25:42,026 --> 00:25:43,859
And that sounds pretty, um, dangerous.

682
00:25:44,613 --> 00:25:46,862
What happens after the end of the year?

683
00:25:47,027 --> 00:25:48,497
Interest rates go up.

684
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:50,533
Ooh... Interesting.

685
00:25:50,535 --> 00:25:53,168
(Both laughing)

686
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,591
("We Wish You a Merry Christmas" playing)

687
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:00,009
Yes. Yes.

688
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:01,510
Outside the box. Whoa.

689
00:26:01,512 --> 00:26:02,511
What are you doing?

690
00:26:02,513 --> 00:26:05,798
I wanted a witness, not a turncoat.

691
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,216
Gingerbread houses are fun.

692
00:26:07,218 --> 00:26:09,218
And I could never have
one when I was little,

693
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,270
'cause I get so hyper from sugar.

694
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:13,055
Look how hyper I am.

695
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:14,139
It's not that.

696
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:16,725
The cozying up to my family and Shauna.

697
00:26:16,727 --> 00:26:18,277
Yeah, why don't you call her "mom"?

698
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:21,063
The whole "Shauna" thing
is, like, creeping me out.

699
00:26:21,065 --> 00:26:22,731
See, you're taking her side.

700
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:24,617
You know, the whole reason that I came here

701
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:26,368
is 'cause I thought that you were cute

702
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,070
and that they were going to be terrible.

703
00:26:28,072 --> 00:26:30,873
But you're terrible and they're cute.

704
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:33,208
- Did you say... 
- Who wants a nog refill?

705
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,577
Okay, what is that supposed to mean?

706
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:36,836
See? You're doing it. Stop.

707
00:26:36,998 --> 00:26:39,748
Sorry, poopsy over here
hasn't had his nap yet.

708
00:26:41,012 --> 00:26:42,251
Is something burning?

709
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:43,335
Oh, ooh!

710
00:26:43,337 --> 00:26:45,254
I think I left cookies in the oven.

711
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:46,505
Oh, you left something?

712
00:26:46,507 --> 00:26:47,506
Shocker.

713
00:26:47,752 --> 00:26:48,757
Excuse me?

714
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,142
Nothing.

715
00:26:50,144 --> 00:26:51,477
Greg, I think you should tell us

716
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,428
what you meant by that.

717
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,596
Oh, no, don't get him started.

718
00:26:53,598 --> 00:26:55,848
He's just never gotten
over you leaving him.

719
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,900
Anyways, I know it's early,

720
00:26:57,902 --> 00:26:59,935
but can I make a to-go plate?

721
00:27:01,424 --> 00:27:02,938
Um, what kind of material is this?

722
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,023
Oh, it's just a coat.

723
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:06,158
Harris tweed? Uh, some kind of wool.

724
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,242
It's really nice.

725
00:27:07,244 --> 00:27:09,111
Hey, mom. How about I
get you another drink?

726
00:27:09,113 --> 00:27:11,614
Huh? How about some, uh,
some water? On the rocks?

727
00:27:11,616 --> 00:27:12,948
I'm not drunk, dear.

728
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,451
I'm just having this...
This wonderful time.

729
00:27:15,453 --> 00:27:16,702
I know.

730
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:18,454
But, you know, I'm finished
working with Calvin,

731
00:27:18,456 --> 00:27:20,789
and I just... I hope
we're not holding him up.

732
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:21,757
(Phone ringing)

733
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,042
Oh. Excuse me.

734
00:27:23,044 --> 00:27:25,044
I need to take this, ladies.

735
00:27:25,046 --> 00:27:26,712
Uh, hello.

736
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:27,796
Yeah.

737
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:28,797
Mmm...

738
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,765
I think it's time to go.

739
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:32,017
- Agreed. 
- Not us. You.

740
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:33,352
Honey...

741
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:35,304
You have no idea what it is like

742
00:27:35,306 --> 00:27:37,389
for a single woman of
my age in Westchester.

743
00:27:37,391 --> 00:27:38,807
Everyone is so boring

744
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:41,324
or married or cancer...

745
00:27:42,006 --> 00:27:43,145
That sounds hard.

746
00:27:43,147 --> 00:27:45,564
And he's practically
throwing himself at me,

747
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:46,865
don't you think?

748
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,984
He's absolutely coming on to you.

749
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:49,985
Okay.

750
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:51,036
Then go to Calvin

751
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:52,321
and say I'm good to go.

752
00:27:53,824 --> 00:27:55,207
Are... are you serious?

753
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:58,744
Becca... I thought you and
I were getting along so well.

754
00:27:59,015 --> 00:28:00,314
Having fun.

755
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,118
You don't want me to
have fun while I'm here?

756
00:28:04,585 --> 00:28:05,834
Okay.

757
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:07,302
I did not leave you, Greg.

758
00:28:07,304 --> 00:28:09,171
Really? Because I remember bags packed,

759
00:28:09,173 --> 00:28:11,473
carried down the stairs,
and a car pulling away.

760
00:28:11,475 --> 00:28:12,925
Are those staying activities?

761
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:14,476
I wanted you to live with me,

762
00:28:14,904 --> 00:28:17,179
but you insisted on staying in West Covina.

763
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:18,597
You just wanted me to leave dad?

764
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,682
After you did?

765
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:21,567
You're just like your father.

766
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,746
You want things black and white.

767
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:24,987
You're right.

768
00:28:25,316 --> 00:28:26,238
I made a mistake.

769
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,906
But it wasn't leaving your father.

770
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:29,449
We were both unhappy.

771
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,276
My mistake was that

772
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:33,412
I should have insisted on shared custody.

773
00:28:34,158 --> 00:28:35,164
I didn't want to force it.

774
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:36,999
I didn't want you to hate me.

775
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:39,542
Obviously, that didn't work.

776
00:28:42,711 --> 00:28:44,878
Greg, you are always welcome here.

777
00:28:44,937 --> 00:28:46,804
We all love you.

778
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:49,908
This is your home, too.

779
00:28:52,155 --> 00:28:54,550
You know, I usually
don't say this to people,

780
00:28:54,552 --> 00:28:57,720
'cause it's a bit too on the nose for me,

781
00:28:57,722 --> 00:29:00,389
but you need to get over
yourself and grow up.

782
00:29:01,012 --> 00:29:03,475
And now, 'cause I'm hungry.

783
00:29:03,477 --> 00:29:04,357
Wait.

784
00:29:04,895 --> 00:29:06,729
You're the only person here
not involved in this situation,

785
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:08,397
and you think I'm the one out of line?

786
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,699
Um, yeah.

787
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:12,701
Because she's cool and you're a dick.

788
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,563
- Mason! 
- That was...

789
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:19,041
warranted.

790
00:29:19,598 --> 00:29:21,410
Good call, Mason.

791
00:29:22,405 --> 00:29:23,796
I'm sorry.

792
00:29:28,631 --> 00:29:30,247
I'm sorry, mom.

793
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,227
Thanks, Greg.

794
00:29:35,926 --> 00:29:37,509
Mm-hmm. Okay.

795
00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:39,561
- Good-bye. 
- Hey, Cal.

796
00:29:39,563 --> 00:29:41,563
So I'm gonna head home.

797
00:29:41,565 --> 00:29:42,598
Have a wonderful holiday,

798
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,516
and I need you to sleep with my mom. Bye.

799
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:46,267
Excuse me?

800
00:29:50,841 --> 00:29:52,891
Okay, so... I need you to sleep

801
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,080
with my mom, just a little bit.

802
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:55,104
Doesn't have to be all the way.

803
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:56,595
It could be anything of your choosing.

804
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,986
Hand stuff, an erotic massage...

805
00:29:58,011 --> 00:30:00,011
(Laughing)

806
00:30:00,263 --> 00:30:01,239
Oh.

807
00:30:01,598 --> 00:30:02,647
You're serious.

808
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:03,814
Come on.

809
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:05,933
Look, I bet she is a
real spitfire in the sack,

810
00:30:05,935 --> 00:30:07,101
if she's anything like her daughter.

811
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:08,402
Right? You look confused.

812
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:09,698
Let me lay this out for you.

813
00:30:09,723 --> 00:30:10,756
There is a ring,

814
00:30:11,282 --> 00:30:13,499
and it's been in my family for generations,

815
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:16,619
and I am so close to getting that ring.

816
00:30:16,621 --> 00:30:18,454
But if you turn down my mother tonight,

817
00:30:18,456 --> 00:30:20,122
that ring goes bye-bye.

818
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:21,707
(Sighs)

819
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,428
Please?

820
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,179
Please, please, please, please, please.

821
00:30:27,181 --> 00:30:29,364
Okay. I-i get it.

822
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,300
I'm a mom pleaser myself.

823
00:30:31,302 --> 00:30:33,018
Exactly. So you understand the burden.

824
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,101
So you'll do it.

825
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:34,982
No.

826
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,988
So, I spoke to him,

827
00:30:49,442 --> 00:30:53,205
and he really wants to take
you up to his hotel room.

828

He does?

829

Yeah.

830
00:30:56,377 --> 00:30:58,244
But I had to tell him no.

831
00:31:00,498 --> 00:31:01,346
What?

832
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,803
It's too close to home.

833
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:04,577
He's my biggest client,
and I couldn't risk it.

Where is he?

837
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:09,087
I sent him away.

00:36:18,188 --> 00:36:19,771
That's a term for stupid people.

977
00:36:19,773 --> 00:36:21,105
I want you to survive.

978
00:36:21,107 --> 00:36:22,357
Our people are not about happy.

979
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:23,995
We're about survival.

980
00:36:24,444 --> 00:36:26,828
And that is why I'm glad
that you stood up to me.

981
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,867
Because that means, when the Cossacks come,

982
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:30,865
you can fight back.

983
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:32,367
You can survive.

984
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:34,535
I love you.

985
00:36:34,748 --> 00:36:36,004
Of course I love you.

986
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:36,971
I am your mother.

987
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:39,841
(Crying): Mommy, of course I love you, too.

988
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:42,710
Get over here, you get over here.

989
00:36:44,322 --> 00:36:45,605
It's okay, Becca.

990
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:46,965
(Phone chimes)

991
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:51,603
Your Uber's here. You should go.

992
00:36:51,605 --> 00:36:53,087
- You should go. 
- Okay, okay, okay!

993
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:54,606
I'll go, I'll go.

994
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:56,758
But you're coming home for passover, right?

995
00:36:58,023 --> 00:36:59,323
- Becca?
- You know what?

996
00:36:59,348 --> 00:37:01,047
No, I'm not coming home for pa...

997
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:05,033
Okay, I'll come home for Passover.

998
00:37:05,035 --> 00:37:06,452
Good girl.

999
00:37:09,034 --> 00:37:10,567
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

1000
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:12,148
You got it.

1001
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,067
- Bye.
- Bye.

1002
00:37:15,997 --> 00:37:18,519
So, I found a gift for my mom.

1003
00:37:18,848 --> 00:37:20,748
Is it that you finally
went through puberty?

1004
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,901
(Laughs) No.

1005
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,719
I got her a candle.

1006
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:27,032
It smells like, um, pine.

1007
00:37:27,057 --> 00:37:29,424
That's good. That's a good first step.

1008
00:37:29,698 --> 00:37:32,510
You know, your lack of social
decorum saved the holiday.

1009
00:37:32,512 --> 00:37:33,739
It was a Christmas miracle.

1010
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,480
I get that a lot.

1011
00:37:35,482 --> 00:37:37,065
I had the best time.

1012
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:38,066
Really?

1013
00:37:38,068 --> 00:37:39,130
You kind of hated me.

1014
00:37:39,436 --> 00:37:40,935
Yeah, in a good way.

1015
00:37:40,937 --> 00:37:42,270
I thought it was cute.

1016
00:37:42,496 --> 00:37:43,521
In what way?

1017
00:37:43,523 --> 00:37:45,857
Cute like a hamster playing the piano

1018
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:49,215
or cute like a man who's
handsome and not cute?

1019
00:37:49,362 --> 00:37:51,424
I don't know. We'll see.

1020
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,031
Oh, bummer.

1021
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:54,749
I have to go back to work now.

1022
00:37:54,774 --> 00:37:56,679
No, I want to keep hanging out.

1023
00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:57,838
All right, I'll quit.

1024
00:37:58,412 --> 00:37:59,337
What?

1025
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:00,955
I quit!

1026
00:38:00,957 --> 00:38:04,165
Hey, can you give these to the toy kiosk?

1027
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,948
- (Laughs) 
- Thanks.

1028
00:38:06,296 --> 00:38:07,795
Awesome!

1029
00:38:08,936 --> 00:38:11,186
Dude, weak.

1030
00:38:19,165 --> 00:38:20,475
Hey, Becks!

1031
00:38:20,477 --> 00:38:21,688
Haven't seen you all week.

1032
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:23,348
- Hi. 
- How was your holiday?

1033
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,026
(Laughs) It was interesting.

1034
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,427
I finally now feel what it's like

1035
00:38:29,452 --> 00:38:30,952
to be a grown-up at Christmas.

1036
00:38:30,954 --> 00:38:32,787
Dude... me, too!

1037
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:33,988
(Gasps) Emotional jinx!

1038
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,156
You owe me a coke.

1039
00:38:35,158 --> 00:38:36,657
(Both laugh)

1040
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:38,611

1041
00:38:38,962 --> 00:38:40,995
