MAN: oh, aye.
15 men went ashore that day,

42
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:02,296
and only Flint, his own self, returned.

43
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:06,434
Oh, aye,
and then old Flinty up and died

44
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:12,070
Afore they could get back to that
cursed island and dig up the treasure.

45
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:17,049
No one knows to this day
who has old Flint's map.

46
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:20,951
ALL: Isn't that a story
worth the hearing?

47
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:23,546
It was the first dozen times.

48
00:04:23,612 --> 00:04:26,058
I'll drink to that.

49
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:33,259
But who has the map now, huh? Some
black-hearted, squid-sucking buccaneer?

50
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:37,133
Or maybe it's our very own Jim Hawkins.

51
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:38,933
Eh, Jimmy?

52
00:04:38,994 --> 00:04:42,237
If I had it,
my friends and I wouldn't be here.

53
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:45,397
We'd be searching for
that treasure, sailing

54
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:48,111
the seven seas on a
five-year mission,

55
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,744
boldly going where no man
has gone before. That's catchy.

56
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:57,917
Not me. If I had that treasure map,
I'd trade it for a decent meal.

57
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,253
Think he'll eat this?

58
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:05,060
Aye! Beware the one-legged man.
He's the one to fear.

59
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,327
We'll watch for him.
Yeah.

60
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:11,030
I'll watch for him,
if he's delivering a pizza.

61
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,266
Even old Flinty feared him.

62
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:18,641
If he comes round here, run for me quick.
If we see him we'll tell you.

63
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,204
One leg, three heads,
couple dozen noses...

64
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:28,551
lt'll be nay joking matter, hose nose.
The one-legged man brings death.

65
00:05:28,977 --> 00:05:32,948
Time, gentlemen!
lt's closing time.

66
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:36,461
You pays your bills then shove off.
Out you go.

Look at the state of this place.

70

How comes it gets
to be such a pigsty?

72
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:52,309
No offense meant, gentlemen.

73
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:56,782
Here's to you, boys.
I'm away to my room.

74
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:58,545
RIZZO: Thank you, Bill.

75
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:02,783
Come back tomorrow for
our lunchtime special, roast suckling...

76
00:06:02,844 --> 00:06:04,949
Huh?
...potatoes.

77
00:06:05,013 --> 00:06:06,856
PIG: Oh. All right.

00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:09,521

Boys, when you're finished here,
clean up in the kitchen.

81
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:20,064
I left some table scraps for your supper.

82
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:22,665
Oh, yes. And, boys...

83
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:25,805
last night you forgot
to put out the lantern.

84
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:30,441
Forget again and there'll be
no table scraps for a week.

85
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,716
GONZO: You're standing on my ear.
Easy. Easy, Rizzo.

86
00:06:36,778 --> 00:06:38,416
RIZZO: Whoa!

87
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,188
That's it. Steady.
I hate my life.

88
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,492
I hate your life too.
If I had a life, I'd hate it.

89
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:46,863
I should run off to sea
like my father.

90
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:50,665
He was my age when he sailed to China.
He wound up a first mate.

91
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:53,171
Run off to sea
and leave everybody?

92
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:55,538
I'm an orphan.
I have no family.

93
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:58,976
You got us.
Yeah. We're family.

94
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:00,536
Got it.
ALL: Whoa!

95
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:02,445
Ow!

96
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,549
Some family we are.
We don't exactly look alike.

97
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,821
So I'm a rat and you're a human being
and Gonzo's a...

98
00:07:13,882 --> 00:07:17,056
Whatever.
We're still family.

99
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:21,396
But I wish my life were more
like one of Captain Bones' adventures.

100
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:24,164
Searching for buried treasure.

101
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:28,299
Discovering lost islands
and weird civilizations.

102
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:31,674
Navigating with my father's old compass.

103
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:34,441
Off to Zanzibar
to meet the Zanzibarbarians.

104
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:37,608
Here they go again.
To the southwest, pirate galleons.

To the southeast, multi-armed Zanzibanian
shark-women and their exploding wigs.

Beaker, stop fooling around.
We've got company.

315
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:56,613
Everyone, this is Dr. Livesey
and his assistant, Beaker.

316
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:58,947
They do research and development.

317
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:00,451
Hello.
Mee-oh.

318
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:05,082
We hoped to meet with your father.
We need a ship for an ocean voyage.

319
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:08,525
Ocean? Ocean? Ocean?

320
00:21:08,582 --> 00:21:12,553
You know, the ocean -
the big, blue, wet thing.

321
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:16,329
Oh! The big, blue, wet thing.

322
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,370
Yes!

323
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:20,804
I know what's happening.

324
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:25,503
You are planning to sail to this island
to dig up this treasure.

325
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:28,604
Yes, but there are
pirates looking for this map.

326
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:32,583
And they want to kill us for it.
Isn't that exciting?

327
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,087
Pirates, eh?
Well, that settles it.

328
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:42,219
We'll use one of my daddy's boats
and I will finance the voyage myself.

329
00:21:42,283 --> 00:21:44,388
You'll do that?
Certainly.

330
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:47,524
What are rich half-wit sons for?

331
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:58,339
Here's the dock.
We're on a dock? No wonder I'm seasick.

332
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:01,039
TRELAWNEY: Ahoy!
Morning, Squire.

333
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:02,638
Welcome.

334
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:07,413

RIZZO: Let's go!

338
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:26,771
"Take a cruise," you said.

339
00:22:26,827 --> 00:22:29,774
"See the world," you said.

340
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,778
Now here we are
stuck on the front of this stupid ship.

341
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:37,247
It could be worse.
We could be stuck in the audience.

342
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:39,284
(THEY LAUGH)

343
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,413
Mr. Bimbo, the ship is provisioned,
the crew is in place,

344
00:22:43,477 --> 00:22:48,551
and the captain should be on board
within the hour. You have been busy.

345
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:49,959
Yuch!

346
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:53,021
Look there goes Jim.
Yeah.

347
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:57,060
Look it's the boat-steering thing.

348
00:22:57,124 --> 00:22:59,161
This is called the helm.

349
00:22:59,226 --> 00:23:03,675
Hey, how does it feel,
Captain Hawkins?

350
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:09,147
It feels like we're really doing it.
Like we're finally having an adventure.

351
00:23:09,203 --> 00:23:12,184
I'm starving.
Where's the kitchen?

We're just cabin boys, Mr. Silver.

00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,303
Long John to his friends.

379
00:24:43,364 --> 00:24:49,645
And believe me, a friend you can trust
is worth his weight in gold.

had talking parrots.

Tell us where the map is,
or we'll tear you limb from limb!

625
00:41:27,467 --> 00:41:30,073
My friend and I will never tell.

626
00:41:30,136 --> 00:41:35,176
RIZZO: There could be
extenuating circumstances. I mean...

627
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:37,118
Maybe they'll ask nice.

628
00:41:37,176 --> 00:41:39,178
In your dreams.
Do it, Monty.

629
00:41:39,245 --> 00:41:41,452
Yeah! Do it to me.

630
00:41:43,116 --> 00:41:45,653
Whoa! Oh!

631
00:41:45,718 --> 00:41:47,698
Yes!

632
00:41:47,754 --> 00:41:50,826
No. I can't look.
Look at this!

633
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,268
I'm taller! This is so cool.

634

I may even have a future with the NBA!

This won't work. He likes it.
Let's torture the rat.

636
00:41:59,966 --> 00:42:02,913
Huh? No!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

637
00:42:02,969 --> 00:42:05,074
Oh, no, no!
Yes!

638
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:08,415
No! No. Please, no!
I hate basketball.

639
00:42:08,474 --> 00:42:12,081
I got a lovely recipe for blackened rat.

648
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:38,607
Mr. Arrow, lock them up
for the remainder of the voyage.

649
00:42:38,671 --> 00:42:42,346
Yes, sir.
You can't hold us. Stop crying.

00:42:42,408 --> 00:42:45,321
Move along.
Move along.

651
00:42:47,613 --> 00:42:50,856
Master Hawkins,
may I see you in my cabin?

652
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:52,988
Yes, sir.

653
00:42:54,387 --> 00:42:56,867

Ready.

Oh, great! Wow!

00:43:11,571 --> 00:43:13,744
Argh! Whoo!

659
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:18,822
Whoo-hoo! That was so cool!

I'd rather not, sir.

665
00:43:35,828 --> 00:43:42,837

Aye aye, Captain.

RIZZO: WHAT'S WRONG?

780
00:52:09,975 --> 00:52:12,012
It just feels so weird.

781
00:52:12,077 --> 00:52:15,058
That Mr. Arrow's dead?
That.

782
00:52:15,114 --> 00:52:18,493

Come on. Share an apple.
Come on.

787
00:52:33,866 --> 00:52:38,110
Here's the plan.
We should kill that captain now.

Can we make a rug out of him?

I'm a easy man.

792
00:52:52,518 --> 00:52:56,660
But it makes me sick
to sail with the likes of you.

Now, get this straight.

794
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:03,163
If anyone mutinies before I says so,

795
00:53:03,228 --> 00:53:07,142
I'll throw you overboard
like I did Mr. Arrow.

796
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:12,273
I says let the captain
steer us closer to the island.

797
00:53:12,338 --> 00:53:16,718
I have the treasure map.
When the time is ripe, well kill 'em all.

that it is.

Gather the officers
and meet me in my quarters. Quickly.

819

This is lucky,
Captain letting us go ashore.

There's room in the boat for one more.
Come along.

826

What a shame.

are ashore, we sail and return in a year.
