1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,467
<i>Here's what you missed last week.</i>

2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:06,061
<i>Quinn's pregnant, and Puck's the father,
but Quinn's decided...</i>

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,664
<i>to give the baby to Terri,
who's not pregnant, just pretending to be.</i>

4
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:11,643
<i>- It was her sister Kendra's idea.
- We're gonna have to get you a baby.</i>

5
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,770
<i>- Also, Ken proposed to Emma, and she said...
- Yes.</i>

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,941
<i>Oh, and Sue got Figgins
to make her co director of the Glee Club.</i>

7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,416
<i>- Hey, kids.
- And that's what you missed on...</i>

8
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,817
<i>¶¶ Glee ¶¶</i>

9
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:31,392
<i>How did this happen?
I look like a crazy person.</i>

10
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:34,024
<i>That's not me. Wow.</i>

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,830
<i>I didn't know the vein on my neck
could stick out like that.</i>

12
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,666
<i>We've been going at it for a week...</i>

13
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:42,265
<i>since the decongestant incident where Figgins
brought Sue in to co-run the Glee Club.</i>

14
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,743
<i>I'm so ashamed of myself.
She's turned me into her.</i>

15
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,149
<i>Look at me.</i>

16
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:55,517
<i>Even in the heat of battle, I'm so elegant...</i>

17
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,078
<i>regal.</i>

18
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:00,558
<i>I am Ajax, mighty Greek warrior.</i>

19
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:04,461
<i>God, it feels good to finally pop that zit
known as Will Schuester.</i>

20
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,465
<i>Shut up, Sue.</i>

21
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,502
<i>Look at us.
We're even fighting in our voice-overs.</i>

22
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,470
<i>I guess things really
started to fall apart a couple days ago...</i>

23
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,167
<i>right after Figgins
called us into his office for a sit-down.</i>

24
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,505
Sue, Schue, I called you here...

25
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,841
to get the temperature of the Glee Club.

26
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,404
- Great.
- I wanted to get a progress report...

27
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,474
on how you're working together
as co directors.

28
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,281
- Well, I think...
- In my opinion... No, go ahead.

29
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:28,581
- No, you.
- Okay.

30
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,122
- Please.
- Principal Figgins.

31
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,217
- Uh, things couldn't be going more smoothly.
- I couldn't agree more.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,930
I don't want to hear any reports...

33
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,800
of either of you trying to curry favor
from the children.

34
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,534
<i>- Am I clear?
- Oh, absolutely!</i>

35
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,066
As we head into sectionals,
I wanna get some feedback.

36
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,637
Like, what kind of stuff
you guys would like to be doing.

37
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,206
Is there anything... any music in particular...
that you guys wanna do?

38
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:02,084
Can we maybe try something a little more black?

39
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,487
<i>I agree. We do an awful lot of show tunes.</i>

40
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,616
It's Glee Club, not Crunk Club.

41
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,684
Don't make me take you to the carpet.

42
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:12,253
Fantastic! Thank you, Mercedes, Kurt.

43
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,493
Duly noted. Anything else?

44
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,762
I can pop and lock.

45
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,430
Not really what we're goin' for, Mike...

46
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,270
but... noted, noted, yes.

47
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,539
- And no pitting the kids against one another.
- Never.

48
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,274
I wanna pit these kids against one another.
Am I clear?

49
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,213
<i>Quinn, update. Go.</i>

50
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,878
The minority students
don't feel like they're being heard.

51
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:37,047
Ah. Chink in the armor, huh?

52
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:41,423
I am going to create an environment
that is so toxic...

53
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,724
no one will want to be a part of that club.

54
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,959
Like the time I sold my house
to a nice, young couple...

55
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,695
and I salted the earth in the backyard...

56
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,761
so that nothing living could grow there
for a hundred years.

57
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,534
<i>You know why I did that?</i>

58
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,872
Because they tried to get me
to pay their closing costs.

59
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,072
Sectionals is coming up.

60
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,138
What are your co director plans?

61
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,379
Uh, we were actually...
Uh, we're each gonna direct our own number.

62
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,852
And we'll be flipping a coin
to see who goes first.

63
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:12,221
- It'll be very civilized, very sportsmanlike, so...
- Mmm. Yes.

64
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,484
This arrangement is pleasing to all.

65
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,961
- Isn't it?
- It's great.

66
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,328
Now, let's hug it out.

67
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,163
- I'd rather not do that.
- I really don't see that happening.

68
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,433
This meeting doesn't end
until I see your bodies touching.

69
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,772
<i>It's a technique I learned last week
at my leadership seminar.</i>

70
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,311
I will destroy you.

71
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,616
I'm about to vomit down your back.

72
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,122
It's on.

73
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:55,128
- I'm freaking out.
- Everything's gonna be fine.

74
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:58,329
Relax. At your age, there's very little chance
of anything being wrong.

75
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,201
Awesome.

76
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,764
It is gonna be a little cool to the touch.

77
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,936
Can you just be careful with my uniform?

78
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,536
All right.

79
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,946
Speaking of your ages,
have you two given any thought...

80
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,678
to what you're gonna do after the baby is born?

81
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,585
Whatever Quinn wants is fine.

82
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,783
Well, if it makes a difference, it's a girl.

83
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,535
<i>- Hmm. Hey.
- Hey.</i>

84
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,841
The baby's fine. Uh, no mutations or anything.

85
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,815
Not even any cool ones.

86
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:48,820
Thanks for taking us today.
I was too freaked out to drive.

87
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,220
Yeah. No problem.

88
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,194
Hey. You doing all right?

89
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,390
Um, no.

90
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,197
I mean, how am I supposed to
take care of a real person?

91
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,670
My mom won't even let me have fish.

92
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,674
I thought Quinn wanted
to give the baby up for adoption.

93
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:13,075
For now, but we both know that's not my call.

94
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,075
This sucks.

95
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,449
Get all the stress and the worry
and none of the control.

96
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,223
It's cool, Mr. Schue.

97
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,283
You wouldn't understand.

98
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,670
The independent polling company
in my Dockers...

99
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,573
has determined you're the hottest girl
in this school.

100
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,305
- Ew.
- Have you been reading my blog?

101
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,370
Of course not. You're a gossip monger...

102
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,383
and your blog is nothing but trash and lies,
many of them about me.

103
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,784
You'll be happy to know the one I'm working on
right now has nothing to do with you...

104
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,118
or your rumored lust for Jew-fros.

105
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,124
It's about Quinn Fabray.

106
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,524
Word on the street is that she's in trouble.

107
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,892
- Where did you hear that?
- Are you denying it?

108
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,124
Yes.

109
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,690
Because the same birdie
told me you're heartbroken...

110
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,931
Finn Hudson didn't choose you
to carry his litter.

111
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,979
- What is it gonna take for you to not run the story?
- Well...

112
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,676
Ladies' choice. Heads.

113
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,811
Tricksters Trick Store? This is Sue Sylvester.
You got any of those double-headed coins?

114
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,418
Heads.

115
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,652
Awesome. All right.

116
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,717
Following students have been selected...

117
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,491
for a special elite Glee Club called Sue's Kids.

118
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:42,091
- Hold on. We agreed not to split up the group.
- Aw, come on, Will.

119
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,466
Give me a chance to do things Sue Sylvester's way.

120
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,937
Maybe with my proven leadership abilities...

121
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,600
I can help this pathetic group
of mouth breathers place at sectionals.

122
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,872
<i>We can't even compete in sectionals
if we divide up the club, Sue.</i>

123
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:56,005
- It's against the rules.
- Really? You need to crack open a book, William.

124
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,347
<i>Here. I have.
Show Choir Rule Book. Page 24.</i>

125
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,887
Provision 14. Second addendum.

126
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,213
<i>"Twelve members must perform for each team.</i>

127
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,658
<i>However, not all members
must perform every song."</i>

128
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:17,202
Fine. Hey, just go ahead,
take all the football players and your Cheerios.

129
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,034
All right, everybody. Listen up.

130
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,872
When you hear your name called,
cross over to my side of this black, shiny thing.

131
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,673
- That's called a piano, Sue.
- Santana!

132
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:30,011
Wheels! Gay kid! Come on! Move it!

133
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,176
Asian! Other Asian.

134
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:38,519
Aretha. And Shaft.

135
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:42,152
I don't want to participate in a group
that ignores the needs of minority students.

136
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,493
- You have got to be kidding me!
- I wouldn't kid about this.

137
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,556
And maybe that's your problem.

138
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,897
Bigotry is no laughing matter.

139
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,369
And that's how Sue sees it.

140
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,702
Outstanding.

141
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,570
I wanted to remind you to tell that Quinn girl...

142
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,878
not to vaccinate in the hospital.

143
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,852
I'm pretty sure those shots
made my kids stupid.

144
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,912
Oh. I guess I could use
the vaccination money...

145
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,151
to buy the organic crib mattress.

146
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,389
I mean, what are the chances
of the baby getting polio, right?

147
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,089
Bye, Kendra.

148
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,133
- I hate you, Will!
- That was rude!

149
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,361
Don't take the stress of your workday
out on me.

150
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,370
I don't wanna take it out on you, Terri.

151
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,532
I just don't wanna feel as powerless
in my own home as I do at school.

152
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:32,772
I have to come home and listen to you making
major decisions about our son with your sister.

153
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,836
I haven't even felt the baby kick yet...

154
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,075
and the only time
I've ever been to an OB/GYN office...

155
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,208
was when I took Quinn and Finn
for the 10-week ultrasound.

156
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,448
You did? How's the baby?

157
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,116
Fine. It's a girl. That's not the point.

158
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,421
Well, what is the point, Will?

159
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:51,327
My point is that I am the father of that baby.

160
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,734
And I'm coming with you
to your next doctor's appointment.

161
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,641
So what did you have to do to get him to stop?

162
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,683
Let's just say I feel sorry for my dads...

163
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,312
'cause they're probably gonna have to dip into
my college fund to pay for intensive therapy.

164
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,754
- Whoa! Hard core.
- I don't mind.

165
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,451
- I did it to protect you.
- And Quinn.

166
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,187
- Of course.
- Yeah.

167
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,991
- We're all teammates.
- Hey, I gotta tell you.

168
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,158
You really are awesome.

169
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,532
I'm gonna make it up to you someday, I swear.

170
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,442
I need another pair.

171
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,705
- What's wrong with the ones I already gave you?
- Look.

172
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,271
- Uh, they still had the tag on them.
- Put those away!

173
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,284
I want Rachel Berry panties.

174
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,343
Okay. I expect delivery by tomorrow morning...

175
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,118
or the story of Quinn Fabray
and the stork goes wide.

176
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,682
I feel an urge to kiss you right now.
I'm just gonna go for it.

177
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,228
You stop it!

178
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,230
Okay. Sorry.

179
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,595
- I'm k-k-kind of nervous.
- I debated not even showing up.

180
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:10,472
I think it's gonna be great.
Did you catch Sue's Corner last night?

181
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,479
<i>Sometimes people ask me, "Sue,
how come you're so sensitive to minorities?"</i>

182
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,515
I'll tell you why.

183
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:21,042
Because I know firsthand how hard it is
to struggle as a minority in America today.

184
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,588
I'm 1/16th Comanche Indian.

185
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,988
In fact, I like minorities so much...

186
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,549
I'm thinkin' of movin' to California
to become one.

187
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:32,557
<i>Hey, kids. Brought some
of my brass buddies with me.</i>

188
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,998
<i>Thought maybe they could
help us out a little bit. Okay.</i>

189
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:38,127
So I selected a song that I think
will speak to the frustration you've felt...

190
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,332
under the failed leadership of Will Schuester.

191
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,936
"Hate on Me," an R & B song!

192
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,104
You like that? Yeah.

193
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:51,616
Changster, I wanna see some of that
pop and lock groove you're so famous for.

194
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,744
You go to town. And you, Mercedes.

195
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,913
<i>- I want to see some Mariah hands.
- I can do that.</i>

196
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,618
- Yeah!
- I think we g-got this one, Miss Sylvester.

197
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,184
All right. Well, we'll see. Hit it!

Sue. Hey, Sylvester, I'm talking to you.

241
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,316
Oh, hey, buddy. I thought I smelled failure.

242
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,016
Why'd you take the piano
when it was my time up with the kids?

243
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,582
A properly steam-cleaned piano
is the key to any successful music group.

244
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,651
You are undermining me
in front of these students.

245
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,323
Your delusions of persecution
are a telltale sign...

246
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,491
of early-stage paranoid schizophrenia.

247
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,558
Sue, I am not done talking to you.

248
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,968
What about all my sheet music?
My kids need that music.

249
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,700
Well, Will, the last thing your kids need
is chronic sinusitis...

250
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,504
from the mildew I feared
was infesting that old, moldy paper.

251
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,068
- So, what, you sent it away for some testing?
- Nah. Burned it.

252
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,343
That is it, Sue! This ends right here!

253
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,782
A cockfight. Fantastic.

254
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:44,346
We are here for these students.
Whatever problems we have,
we're gonna get 'em out in the open!

255
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,358
You wanna get real? You're right, Will.

256
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,987
I have been trying to destroy your club
with a conviction I can only call religious.

257
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,624
And you wanna know why?
Because I don't trust a man with curly hair.

258
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,194
I can't help picturing small birds
laying sulfurous eggs in there...

259
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,205
and I find it disgusting.

260
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,434
Oh, you are a terrible influence on these kids.

261
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,275
- You're dangerous. I think you
teach them the wrong lessons!
- I don't care what you think.

262
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,975
I have a legacy to protect, William,
and Glee Club is a part of that legacy.

263
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,984
And I will win.

264
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,954
If it means I have to
get you fired to do it, so be it.

265
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,456
<i>Those drinks are crap!</i>

266
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,467
Oh! Thanks, honey.

267
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,670
I wanna finish grading these papers first.

268
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,078
What, you think the kids weren't drunk
when they wrote 'em, hmm?

269
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,411
Listen, honey.

270
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,612
I've been a really crummy wife lately.

271
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,952
Uh, Terri, you're carrying my baby.

272
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,322
I have no right to expect anything
more than that from you.

273
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,191
No, that is my sister's marriage,
and I don't want it.

274
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,458
Anyway, listen.

275
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,465
Okay.

276
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,764
I think that I might be able to help you
with your problems at school.

277
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:08,898
Uh, thanks, Terri, but the last time
you helped out at school...

278
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,965
it didn't go over very well.

279
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,739
Eh...

280
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,975
Besides, this is serious.

281
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,041
I mean, Sue said she wouldn't rest
until she saw me fired.

282
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:24,180
All the more reason.
You gotta do whatever it takes, honey.

283
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,522
You gotta get down in the gutter
if you wanna win this.

284
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,020
<i>Sue, a lot of our readers
at Cheerleading Today...</i>

285
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,589
- I'm cutting you off. Is this a cover story?
- Yes.

286
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,501
Okay. This is all your readers need to know.
I'm all about empowerment.

287
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,061
I empower my Cheerios
to live in a state of constant fear...

288
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,200
by creating an environment
of irrational, random terror.

289
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,268
Speaking of which... Q! Here, now!

290
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:53,079
<i>- Where are my Cheerios?
- Coach Sylvester, they're not academically eligible.</i>

291
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,746
Mr. Schuester flunked them.

292
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:05,724
<i>This is a travesty
of international proportions.</i>

293
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,961
You are jeopardizing my Cheerios' role
as goodwill ambassadors...

294
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,059
and I have a call in to the president.

295
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:15,129
<i>I have a Spanish quiz in which one
of your cheerleaders misspelled her name...</i>

296
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,573
<i>and answered every question
with a drawing of a sombrero.</i>

297
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,874
<i>You can't stand it. You can't stand
to see a woman in a position of power.</i>

298
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,006
<i>- That has nothing...
- Your psychosexual derangement
would be fascinating, Will...</i>

299
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,381
<i>if it weren't so terrifying!</i>

300
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,182
Sue, Will did a little research.

301
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:32,382
According to our test records, most of
your cheerleaders are functionally illiterate!

302
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,451
- Oh, so what?
- And why, only last Friday, at the football game...

303
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:40,589
they tried to spell out "Go, team,"
and they spelled out "To game."

304
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,568
<i>"To game."Since 1992, 95% of your Cheerios...</i>

305
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,627
should have flunked Spanish...

306
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,299
and I, for one, am not gonna
be a part of it anymore.

307
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,742
Oh, Will, we all know about your devotion
to that dying language!

308
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,939
<i>- Dying language?
- Let me break this down for you, okay?</i>

309
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,506
I empower my Cheerios to be champions.

310
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,178
Do they go on to college?
I don't know. I don't care.

311
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,187
- See...
- Should they learn Spanish?

312
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,416
Sure, if they wanna become
dishwashers and gardeners.

313
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:10,394
<i>But if they wanna be bankers
and lawyers and captains of industry...</i>

314
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,522
the most important lesson
they could possibly learn...

315
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,159
is how to do a round off.

316
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:20,069
<i>She is deranged.
You know, this all happened on your watch!</i>

317
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:23,267
You have allowed this to go on for years.

318
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,469
Say something!

319
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,980
Oh, plea... Okay!
Sue, Will is correct. You're wrong.

320
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,516
- What?
- From now on, no free passes.

321
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,575
That's it! There.

322
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,111
- See you in Glee Club, Sue.
- Don't... touch me.

323
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,092
That is a lawsuit, mister!

324
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,754
<i>I will sue your ass!</i>

325
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,922
What happened to our little agreement, huh?

326
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,993
Will I be uploading a certain video
to YouTube this afternoon?

327
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,130
<i>Anti-embolism stockings can be purchased...</i>

328
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:58,336
<i>Oh, Sue. I put it on YouTube myself,
and it only got two hits!</i>

329
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,870
- Damn!
- Let me break it down for you. Nobody cares!

330
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,359
No! Not the children!

331
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,691
Move! Move! Move!

332
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,129
- Mmm.
- What is this?

333
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,196
Check it out.

334
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,003
I came up with a name
that I think would be good for the kid.

335
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,203
Eyes on your own test, Finn.

336
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,739
What's up now, Ronnie?

337
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,510
Anyway, then I read that Gwyneth Paltrow
named her kid Apple...

338
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:45,546
and I think that's so cool
'cause you know how much I love apples, right?

339
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:49,924
So I figured we should name our kid
something more original and poetic.

340
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,089
Then I came up with
the best baby name of all time.

341
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,563
- Drizzle!
- Drizzle?

342
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,899
Yeah. Yeah.
'Cause you know how awesome it is...

343
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,462
when it's just drizzling outside,
but it's not really raining...

344
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,441
so it smells like rain,
but you don't need an umbrella to go outside.

345
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,375
- Are you a moron?
- What?

346
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,846
We're not naming our baby Drizzle.
We're not naming our baby anything.

347
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,340
Finish your test, Finn.

348
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,648
Will you give me my test back?

349
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,451
- I just don't understand anything.
- That's not my problem.

350
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,754
You are so insensitive!

351
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,193
Bringing up baby names to me
when you know I don't want to keep it.

352
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:27,926
- I can't keep it.
- I know, but I don't get what
you expect me to do about it.

353
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,560
- Not have an opinion?
- Hey, this is happening to me too!

354
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,627
No, it's not!

355
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:37,038
You're not the one whose parents
will burn her like a witch if they find out.

356
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,010
Sometimes I wish you were
a little more like Rachel.

357
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,877
- Really?
- Yeah. She cares about my feelings.

358
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,942
She sticks up for me.
She sticks up for both of us.

359
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,420
She gave that Jacob kid
a pair of her underpants...

360
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,981
just to keep him from posting on his blog
about you being pregnant.

361
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,619
You think she did that for me?

362
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,624
- Just to be a good teammate?
- That's what she told me.

363
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:05,261
I know some guys cheat on their wives
or pregnant girlfriends.

364
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,897
Just don't do it with her.

365
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,804
Whoo! Hey! Ho!

366
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,006
Hey! Ho!

367

387

Whoo! Yeah.

388
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,527
I miss us all being together.

389
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,403
I hope we don't get in trouble
for our covert jam session.

390
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,966
If Sue catches us mingling, we're cooked.

391
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:23,037
She told me if I even talked to one of
Mr. Schue's kids, she would shave my head.

392
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,174
And I just can't rock that look.

393
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,185
Even Justin Timberlake is growing his fro back.

394
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,244
<i>- Well, we gotta go, you guys.
- No!</i>

395
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,155
Miss Sylvester is expecting us
in 10 minutes in the dance studio.

396
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,159
- Oh, man!
- Bye!

397
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,717
- Bye.
- Bye.

398
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,990
- Bye, white people.
- Sorry. Bye.

399
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,998
Hey! What are you guys doing here?

400
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,261
Just s-s-stopping by to say hello.

401
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,269
- Ah, it's great to see you guys.
- Bye!

402
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,669
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye, guys.

403
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,900
All right. Great news, guys.

404
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,103
Brought the band with me, and I think
that we have our number for sectionals.

405
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,169
Mr. Schue?

406
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,408
We don't like what this has become.

407
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,940
Don't you guys see?
That is how Sue wants you to feel.

408
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,010
Giving up doesn't help anyone but her.

409
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:06,080
<i>Look, if it were up to me,
we would all perform together at sectionals.</i>

410
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,353
But it's not up to me anymore, okay?

411
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:11,692
Sue's gonna do her song,
and we are gonna do ours.

412
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:16,097
Sue's Kids are singing about hate... literally.

413
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:20,798
So, I thought we would try a kinder approach.

414
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:24,740
All right. Finn and Rachel, come up here.
You're gonna take the leads.

415
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,608
Oh, I love this song. Okay. Follow my lead.

416
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,943
Don't wait for me.

417
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,381
So much for togetherness.

418
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,646
Guys, you guys really need
to practice this, all right?

419
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,746
Night and day, between classes.
It has to be letter-perfect.

420
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,291
- Okay?
- You got it, Mr. S. Hit it.

421
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,760
¶¶ Tell me how I'm supposed

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,364
¶¶ No air ¶¶

445
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,570
¶¶ Baby, no air ¶¶

446
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,636
¶¶ No ¶¶

447
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,809
¶¶ Hard for me to breathe ¶¶

448
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,010
<i>- ¶¶ How ¶¶
- ¶¶ Tell, tell me how I'm supposed to breathe ¶¶</i>

449
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,019
- ¶¶ With no air ¶¶
- ¶¶ No air ¶¶

450
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,578
<i>- ¶¶ Can't live, can't live without air ¶¶
- ¶¶ No, no ¶¶</i>

451
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,023
¶¶ It's how I feel
when I know you ain't there ¶¶

452
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:24,528
<i>- ¶¶ You're not there ¶¶
- ¶¶ There's no air, no air ¶¶</i>

453
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:27,588
¶¶ You got me out here
in the water so deep ¶¶

454
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,157
¶¶ Tell me how you gonna be without me ¶¶

455
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,762
¶¶ If you ain't here
I just can't breathe ¶¶

456
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,101
¶¶ It's no air ¶¶

457
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,336
¶¶ No air ¶¶¶¶

458
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,608
Amazing, guys. Bull's-eye.

459
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,116
Excuse me. What about us?

460
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:49,051
You expect us
to just sway back here like props?

461
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,054
Say it for me again, word for word.

462
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:55,183
"What about us? You expect us
to just sway back here like props?"

463
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,558
Perfect. Then turn to the other two and say...

464
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,654
<i>I think Sue is right about him.</i>

465
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,995
He clearly doesn't like minorities.

466
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,998
Can you imagine in this day and age
being discriminated against?

467
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:13,044
My goodness. The pain you must be feeling.

468
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,102
So your last name's Puckerman, huh?

469
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,648
- Shalom.
- Who knew?

470
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,809
And poor, sweet Brittany.

471
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,754
Oh, I know the Dutch are famous
for being a cold people...

472
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,757
but that's no excuse for treating you...

473
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:30,659
like some half-price hooker
in Amsterdam's famous Red Light District.

474
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,960
Well, all I can say is,
if you're serious about leaving Schuester...

475
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,364
Sue Sylvester's rainbow tent...

476
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:40,427
will gladly protect you
from his storm of racism.

477
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,947
<i>Hey, babe, you home?</i>

478
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,309
<i>- Hey, what's for dinner?
- Oh!</i>

479
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:59,346
- Why don't you get something
from takeout, sweetie.
- Hey, listen.

480
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,358
I don't expect you to start cooking...

481
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:04,657
but on nights when you're home first, I think
it's appropriate for you to take care of dinner.

482
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,665
Wow, you're so forceful.
What's gotten into you?

483
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,724
You.

484
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,793
You were right. I stood up to Sue...

485
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,738
and now she's begging me for mercy.

486
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:19,265
Oh, I feel great!

487
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,744
And I have you to thank for it.

488
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,678
I have my moments, huh?

489
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,978
You're gonna have another one
this Friday at 4:00.

490
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,849
I made an appointment for us with Dr. Woo.

491
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,953
- My obstetrician.
- Yep.

492
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:37,290
- Oh.
- I'm finally gonna get a look at my little boy.

493
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,565
Hey. Pick whatever you want for dinner.

494
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,869
Just not Chinese again.

495
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,579
Who do you think you are?

496
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,676
Well, now you know how it felt for me
to have my Cheerios snatched away.

497
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,516
I can't do a song with three kids.

498
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,148
Not with that attitude.

499
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,818
Look, I'm prepared to cut you a deal.

500
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,827
You pass my Cheerios...

501
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,329
and I'll give you back
your team of losers and snot faucets.

502
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,669
Sue Sylvester...

503
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:23,174
you're gonna have to pry those F's
from my cold, dead hands.

504
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,505
Can't wait, pal!

505
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:31,141
My job is very stressful.

506
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:34,344
After dentists, obstetricians
have the highest rate of suicide...

507
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,717
among medical professionals.

508
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,757
Caring for my bonsai relaxes me.

509
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:43,783
- I had a huge crush on the Karate Kid
when I was a teenager.
- Can we cut the crap?

510
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:47,093
I guess I'm a little curious
as to what you ladies want from me.

511
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,362
- Neither of you are pregnant.
- Well, Woo...

512
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,403
you delivered all three of my kids.

513
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,770
Each one is dumber than the last.
Plus, they all have A.D.D.

514
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,867
And, although my husband nor I have red hair...

515
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,878
they are all creepy ginger kids.

516
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:05,780
- It's caused by a recessive gene.
- That's one theory. Do you wanna hear mine?

517
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,683
You gave me too much Pitocin
when I was in labor...

518
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,744
and it screwed up their DNA.

519
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,052
That's not a theory. You just made that up.

520
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:16,651
<i>Mrs. Schuester, is your sister on some kind
of new psychotropic medication?</i>

521
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,753
- Not that I know of.
- That's offensive.

522
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,261
- Are you all right?
- Shh. Here's the deal, Woo.

523
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,597
<i>My husband does the taxes...</i>

524
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:28,127
for some very powerful
mid size law firms in this town.

525
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,403
And I'm sure somebody would be more
than happy to take on my lawsuit.

526
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,671
- You'll never win.
- I don't have to win.

527
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,009
There's only two OBs in this town.

528
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,208
You get even the slightest stink on you...

529
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,342
and you can bet that a bunch
of your patients...

530
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,409
will just close on up their legs...

531
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,580
and walk on over to Dr. Chin.

532
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,954
Okay, this is outrageous.

533
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,585
What do you want?

534
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,661
Listen here, treasure trail.
We're about to have a smack-down.

535
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,761
I don't want to have a confrontation.

536
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,864
Don't play stupid with me, stubbles.

537
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:07,344
I'm having Finn's baby,
and you need to back off.

538
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,381
I'm asking you as nicely as I possibly can.

539
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,814
Leave him alone.

540
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,546
You're right. I-I've helped you not
because it's the right thing to do...

541
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:21,524
but because I had romantic ulterior motives.

542
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,859
But just so we're clear,
you're the one who's cheating.

543
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,865
- Excuse me?
- I have on good authority
that you're Sue Sylvester's mole...

544
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,333
and you can deny it all you want,
but I know it's true.

545
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,336
I have no idea what you're talking about.

546
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,237
Sue is not on your side, Quinn.
She's not on anyone's side but her own.

547
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,140
Can you imagine what she's gonna do
when she finds out about your situation?

548
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,906
She'll probably try to rip off your uniform
with her bare hands.

549
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,175
All right.
Every time you whisper in her ear...

550
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,649
you empower her to do
more damage to the Glee Club.

551
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,744
And right now, Glee Club is all you have.

552
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,915
And if I were you,
I'd recognize who my true friends are.

553
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,925
And I'd practice a little bit more...

554
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,860
because you obviously have
a lot you need to express.

555
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:02,389
Oh, you have no idea.

556
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,698

All right, everybody, take five.

587
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,451
We would just like to say
that although we find ourselves...

588
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,895
on opposite sides,
we hope you enjoy our number...

589
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:16,729
- and we look forward to seeing yours as well.
- Get on with it!

590
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,031
<i>Enough with the jibber-jabber.
Sing something!</i>

591
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,196
Sue, you can't talk to kids that way.

592
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:30,313
¶¶ Tell me how I'm supposed
to breathe with no air ¶¶

593
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,973
<i>- ¶¶ Air, air ¶¶
- All right, that's it. Come on.</i>

594
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,416
<i>She had her chance.
Everybody up. We're leaving.</i>

595
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,817
I'm sorry. Is there a fire?

596
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,482
No, and that's the point. There is no fire.

597
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:43,323
<i>You know, it's sad enough
that my Sue's Kids are living in squalor...</i>

598
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,363
- and probably on food stamps...
- My dad's a dentist.

599
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,059
<i>But for you to drag 'em in here
and bore 'em to death? I won't stand for it.</i>

600
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:52,034
Come on, kids. Out.
We're goin' for Coneys. My treat.

601
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,537
- All right, that's it!
- Really?

602
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,699
You know what, Sue? You've been pretty honest
about your feelings for me...

603
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,868
so let me return the favor.

604
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:04,381
You're rude, Sue. You have no class,
and you are a terrible teacher!

605
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,748
- I'll have you know I have my Ph.D.
- You got it online, Sue!

606
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,014
You are a failed performer, Will.

607
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,352
You weren't good enough
to make it in the real world.

608
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:16,519
You're not even good enough to run
this stupid little club that nobody cares about.

609
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:19,222
<i>Time after time, Will, you fail!</i>

610
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,322
<i>You spend every waking moment of your life...</i>

611
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,924
figuring out ways to terrify children
to try to make you...

612
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,936
<i>feel better about yourself and the fact...</i>

613
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,131
that you're probably gonna spend
the rest of your life alone!

614
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,572
- How dare you talk to me like that!
- Don't you even...

615
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,633
<i>Don't you point your...</i>

616
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,213
Enough!

617
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,216
I'm sorry, Mr. Schue...

618
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,684
Miss Sylvester, but if we wanted
to hear Mom and Dad fight...

619
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:45,552
those of us who still have two parents
would just stay home on payday.

620
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,285
I agree. Glee Club is supposed to be fun.

621
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,953
<i>And furthermore,
I don't like this minority business.</i>

622
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,465
I may be a strong, proud black woman,
but I'm a lot more than that.

623
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,796
- I'm out.
- M-Me too.

624
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,893
Fellow Glee Clubbers, it would be an honor...

625
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,302
to show you how a real storm-out is done.

626
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,636
I encourage you to follow my lead.

627
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,259
Is that necessary?
It's nothing I haven't seen before.

628
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,427
I mean, I am the one who knocked her up.

629
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,961
Just standard operating procedure.

630
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,838
You okay, Mr. Schuester? You seem upset.

631
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,107
Just-Just a little stressed. Bad day at work.

632
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,148
Will, you're about to see your child
for the first time.

633
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,479
Can you forget about those
dancing delinquents for one minute?

634
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:50,009
You're right. I'm sorry.

635
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,554
Oh, my parents are gonna kill me
if I don't come home with a DVD.

636
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:06,065
Got it right here.

637
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,798
All right.

638
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,531
Juno.

639
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,236
Oh.

640
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,074
<i>- You okay?
- Oh, that must be cold.</i>

641
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,171
<i>- Sorry about that.
- It's really... Yeah, it's a little cold.</i>

642
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,157
Wow!

643
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,989
That's him!

644
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,189
Oh, hold on a sec.

645
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,724
What? I-Is something wrong with him?

646
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,771
Well, not exactly.

647
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:44,865
This is really embarrassing,
but it appears as if your boy is a girl.

648
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,036
Oh, my God. Did something happen to his...

649
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,046
No, he never had one. He's a she.

650
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:52,241
Must have misread the first sonogram.
Sorry about that.

651
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,225
Honey, I...

652
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,788
I didn't know that having a boy
was so important to you.

653
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,800
It isn't.

654
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:17,066
I don't care what she is.

655
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,200
She's all ours.

656
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:24,542
I'm just so happy.

657
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,211
No matter what happens...

658
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,915
I want you to remember at this moment...

659
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,923
that we love each other.

660
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,083
Okay?

661
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:50,333
Hey, Sue.

662
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:53,434
William. Close the door.

663
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,740
I, uh, wanted to talk to you
about the auditorium.

664
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:02,047
Good. I wanted to come to you, too,
but I have no idea where your office is.

665
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,679
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Sure.

666
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,819
So I decided to step down as co-head of Glee.

667
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:13,256
- Really?
- Yeah, it's not for me. It's too fruity.

668
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:17,700
<i>I can't stand the sight of kids getting emotional
unless it's from physical exhaustion.</i>

669
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,236
- Yeah. It did get pretty bad in there.
- Yeah.

670
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,238
I'd still like to stay on as consigliere.

671
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,537
You know, maybe you could show me
your set lists before competitions.

672
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,636
- Just so I feel like I'm contributing.
- Cool.

673
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:32,581
You know, I was a VJ for a couple of years.
Not MTV, but still.

674
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,711
Why do I feel like I'm about to fall
through a trapdoor into a pit of fire?

675
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,349
- Because you don't trust me.
- Mmm.

676
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:45,054
I know my methods are extreme,
and I know I'm not like the rest of you hippies...

677
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,496
caring about the kids' feelings
as if they're real.

678
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,434
<i>But I do care about teaching.</i>

679
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:56,030
And when I coach them, and they win, I win.

680
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,566
And you know how I feel about winning.

681
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:02,135
I do.

682
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:05,512
Look. Who's to say everything I do
is a hundred percent on the ball?

683
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,608
No one would say that.

684
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:12,019
Probably right, but, um, in hindsight...

685
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:16,185
you were right to shine the spotlight
on the fact that those kids are minorities.

686
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,093
<i>Because you're all minorities.</i>

687
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:22,530
You're in the Glee Club.
Now, there are only 12 of you.

688
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,592
And all you have is each other.

689
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,696
<i>So it doesn't matter that Rachel is Jewish...</i>

690
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,174
<i>- or that Finn is...
- Unable to tell my rights from my lefts.</i>

691
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,335
<i>Sure.</i>

692
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,675
Or that Santana is Latina...

693
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,044
<i>- or that Quinn is...
- Is pregnant.</i>

694
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,755
Sorry, Q. It'll be all over
the blogosphere by this afternoon.

695
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,815
Now everybody knows... including me.

696
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,644
How could you do that?

697
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,237
Do you have any idea how much pain
you caused by running that story?

698
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,248
Sue made me do it.

699
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:15,649
This was a particularly interesting find...

700
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,654
from today's round of locker checks.

701
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:20,418
Are these your droopy,
white granny panties, Jacob?

702
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,392
Are you an Eve who was born a Steve?

703
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:27,295
Because if you are, I think there's a special
school that would better address your needs.

704
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,390
And I think that school is in Thailand.

705
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,129
Rachel gave them to me
so I wouldn't run the Quinn story.

706
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,068
What Quinn story?

707
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,072
Quinn Fabray is pregnant.

708
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,307
Not a chance.

709
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,646
If my head cheerleader was pregnant,
jeopardizing the very future of my Cheerios...

710
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,414
and thus my teaching tenure,
I think she would have come to me.

711
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:53,321
Quinn Fabray respects me
and would never lie to me. Never.

712
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,018
I have three sources confirming.

713
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,730
Please don't expel me.

714
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,927
I'll kill the story.

715
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,032
No. Run it.

716
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,666
I'm sorry, Rachel.

717
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,770
<i>It's okay.</i>

718
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,440
It's okay.

719
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,609
It's okay.

720
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,743
It's okay.

721
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,887
Everything's gonna be okay.
