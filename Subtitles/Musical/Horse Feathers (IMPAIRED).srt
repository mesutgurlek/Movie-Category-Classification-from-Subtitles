in retiring as president

it is indeed a painful task

Never mind that.

throw your cigar away.

might just as well

I thought my razor was dull
until I heard his speech.

of a story that's so dirty,

to think of it myself.

why this college

shoulders to the wheel,

I came into this college
to get my son out of it.

he left to come here,

No wonder you can't

I went to three colleges in
12 years and fooled around
with three college widows.

139
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,928
When I was your age,
I went to bed
right after supper.

Sometimes I went to bed
before supper.

Sometimes I went
without my supper and
didn't go to bed at all.

something in those days.

In fact,
she stood for plenty.

There's nothing wrong
between me and
the college widow.

There isn't, huh?
Then you're crazy to
fool around with her.

I don't wanna talk to you
about this again, you snob.

00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,123
So that's what they
taught you in college.

153
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,125
Just when I tell you
to go, you leave me.

Now, I like education
as well as the
next fellow...

158
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,638
Well, move over
and I'll talk to
the next fellow.

159
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,974
But a college needs
something else
besides education.

160
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,310
What this college needs
is a good football team.

161
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,312
And you can't have
a good football team

162
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,647
unless you have good
football players.

163
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,192
My boy,
I think you've got
something there,

164
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,277
and I'll wait outside
until you clean it up.

165
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,821
I know it's dangerous,
but I'm gonna ask you
one more question.

166
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,406
Where do you get
good football players?

167
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,617
Well, in the
speakeasy down...
In a speakeasy?

168
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,912
Isn't that against the law?
Selling football players
in a speakeasy?

169
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,080
Dad, two of the greatest
football players
in the country

170
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,790
hang out in the
speakeasy downtown.

171
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,959
Are you suggesting
that I, the president
of Huxley College,

172
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,545
go into a speakeasy
without even giving
me the address?

173
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,882
It's at 42 Elm Street,
but you can't go there.
It's unethical.

174
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,051
It isn't right for a college
to buy football players.

175
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,677
It isn't, eh? Well,
I'll nip that in the bud.

176
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,180
How about coming along
and having a nip yourself?

177
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,390
Or better still,
you wait here.

178
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,018
Anything further, Father?
"Anything further, Father?"

179
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,313
That can't be right. Isn't it,
"Anything, Father, further?"

180
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:25,773
The idea.

181
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,192
I married your mother
because I wanted children.

182
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,945
Imagine my disappointment
when you arrived.

183

since I first commenced it

185
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,868
I'm against it

186
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,382
Well, that's
my proposition, boys.
How about it?

187
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,426
Well, it's
okay with us,
Mr. Jennings,

188
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,552
but how are you
gonna fix it?

189
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,554
Don't worry about that.
It's fixed already.

190
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,556
You boys will be
entered as regular
Darwin students

191
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,976
and play in the
Thanksgiving Day
game against Huxley.

192
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,852
Yeah, but how
about the dough?

193
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,272
Well, here's a little
chicken feed to start with.

194
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,399
You'll get the balance
right after the game.

195
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,193
With you boys
playing for Darwin,
Huxley can't win.

196
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,903
(CHUCKLES)
You said it.

197
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,322
Well, here's to
dear old Darwin.

198
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,784
All right, boys.
Let's go.

199
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,330
Bye, Ed.
So long.

Hello.

Yes, lady, this is Baravelli
the iceman speaking.
What do you want?

205
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,891
Ah, one quart of Scotch,

206
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,519
one quart of rye.

207
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,480
Wait a minute. Hold on.
I see if I got 'em.

208
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,608
One quart of Scotch,

one quart of rye.

210
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,031
Okay, lady,
I send 'em right over.

EDGAR: Hey, Baravelli.

213
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,177
What do you want?
Watch the door
for few minutes.

214
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,013
And don't let
anyone in without
the password.

215
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,307
All right.
What is it?
"Swordfish" is the password.

216
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,184
Do you understand?
Okay, I got it.

217
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,144
Well, what is it?
Password.

218
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,562
Swordfish!
Swordfish!

Who are you?
I'm fine, thanks.
Who are you?

223
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,033
I'm fine too, but
you can't come in unless
you give the password.

224
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,078
Well, what is the
password?
Oh, no.
You gotta tell me.

225
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,664
I tell you what I do.
I give you three guesses.

226
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,417
It's the name
of a fish.

227
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,919
Is it Mary?

228
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,004
(LAUGHS)
That's no fish.

229
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,006
She isn't?
Well, she drinks
like one.

230
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,675
Let me see.
Is it sturgeon?

231
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,010
Eh, you crazy.

232
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,471
Sturgeon is a doctor
who cuts you open
when you sick.

233
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,348
Now, I give you
one more chance.

234
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,891
I got it,
haddock.

235
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,601
That's funny.
I got a haddock
too.

236
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,312
What do you take
for a haddock?
Well, sometimes
I take aspirin.

237
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,022
Sometimes
I take a calomel.

238
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,857
I'd walk a mile
for a calomel.

239
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,694
You mean chocolate
calomel. I like that too,
but you no guess it.

240
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,407
What's the matter?
You don't understand
English?

241
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,700
You can't come in here
unless you say "swordfish."

242
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,953
Now, I give you
one more guess.

243
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:29,289
Swordfish, swordfish.
I think I got it.

244
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,501
Is it swordfish?
That's it.
You guess it.

245

Fine. You guess it.

I wanna come in.

Oh, you no fool me.
Swordfish.

No, I got tired of that.
I changed it.

249
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,977
What's the password now?

250
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,063
I forgot it. I'd better
come outside with you.

to business.

I'm looking for

who always hang around here.

around here, but...
That's all I wanted to know.

I'm Professor Wagstaff

anything to me either.

at the other college
very long.

a breakdown. Why don't
you pull yourself to pieces.

with my partner.

we've got a football.

would you be interested?

a hasty answer.
Just sleep on it.

I can sleep

this is, a picnic?

Well, this ain't
gonna be any picnic.

I'm gonna do to you?

And I say to you,
gentlemen, that this
college is a failure.

332
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,008
The trouble is
we're neglecting
football for education.

333
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,844
BOTH: Exactly.
The Professor is right.

334
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,096
I'm right, am I?
Well, I'm not right.
I'm wrong.

335
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,473
I just said that
to test you.

336
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:07,724
Now I know where I'm at.

337
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,893
I'm dealing with
a couple of snakes.

338
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,104
What I meant to say was that
there's too much football
and not enough education.

339
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,856
BOTH: That's what I think.

340
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,900
Oh, you do, do you?
Well, you're wrong again.

341
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,152
If there was a snake here,
I'd apologize.

342
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,488
Where would this college
be without football?

343
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,156
Have we got a stadium?
BOTH: Yes.

344
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,699
Have we got a college?
BOTH: Yes.

345
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,410
We can't support both.
Tomorrow we start
tearing down the college.

346
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,996
BOTH: But, Professor,
where will the students sleep?

347
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,248
Where they always sleep.
In the classroom.

348
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,336
Oh, Professor, the Dean of
Science wants to know
how soon you can see him.

349
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,463
He says he's tired
of cooling his heels
out here.

350
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,299
Tell him I'm cooling
a couple of heels in here.

351

Where were we?
Oh, yes.

352
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,306
How much am I
paying you fellows?

353
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,142
5,000, a year.
But we've
never been paid.

354
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,937
Well, in that case,
I'll raise you to 8,000,
and a bonus.

355
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,106
Bring your dog around,
I'll give him a bonus too.

356
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,276
The dean is furious.
He's waxing wrath.

357
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,989
Is Roth out there too?
Tell Roth to wax
the dean for a while.

358
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,032
Guess that's bad, huh?

359
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:09,035
One more thing,
Professor.
It's about your son.

360
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,707
I'm afraid he's paying
too little attention
to his studies

361
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,626
and too much
to Connie Bailey,
the college widow.

362
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,754
He is, eh?
I'll put a stop to that.
I'll call her up right now.

00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,048
Have either of you weasels
got her phone number?

I've got it.

Get me Maine 49970
and reverse the charges.

I wanna speak
to Miss Bailey.

00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,275
Is this Miss Bailey?

371
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,735
Mmm-hmm.

372
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,988
Why, of course
I know your son.

373
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:49,534
Why, that's silly.
We're just very
good friends.

374
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,663
But, Professor,
I don't understand.

375
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,958
You don't, eh?
Well, I wanna see you.
Come right over to my office.

376
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,418
You can't?
You're in bed?

377
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,420
Well, in that case,
I'll come over
to your office.

378
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,397
That's a fine way
to carry ice.
Where are your tongs?

379
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,982
Looks like a tong war.

380
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,320
Well, that's the last time
we deliver ice unless
you pay the bill.

381
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,572
How much
do we owe you?
$2,000.

382
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,074
$2,000, for ice?

383
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,826
I can get an Eskimo
for $200 and
make my own ice.

384
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,380
I can do for you,
I make you proposition.

385
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,717
You owe us $200.
We take 2,000
and call it square.

386
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,929
That's not a bad idea.
I'll tell you.
I'll consult my lawyer,

387
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,264
and if he advises
me to do it,
I'll get a new lawyer.

388
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,766
Why don't you
forget about the money.

389
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,019
Go to college, meet
all the beautiful girls.
Get yourself a co-ed.

390
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,646
Ha! I got a co-ed.

391
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,649
Last week for $18
I got a co-ed with
two pair of pants.

392
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:06,569
Since when has a co-ed
got two pair of pants?
Since I joined the college.

393
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,072
Baravelli, you've got
the brain of a
four-year-old boy,

394
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,740
and I bet he was glad
to get rid of it.

395
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,827
Well, now that
you're a college boy,
here's your hat.

396
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,746
Here's your pennant.
Here's your coat.

397
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,338
Alright, report
for football practice
in the morning.

398
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,090
Now, I want you to
sign this agreement.

399
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,591
Hey, there's nothing
on this paper.

400
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,176
That's all right.
We'll fill in
something later.

401
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:34,139
Put your name
on there, huh?

402
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,183
Gee, I didn't know
you could write.

403
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,435
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
This isn't legal.

404
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,229
There's no seal on it.
Where's the seal?

405
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,856
Where's the seal?
Where's the seal?

406
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,274
Where's the seal?
Where's the seal?

407

(BARKING)

409
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:55,451
And thus we see that
the function of the
respiratory system

410
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:58,371
is to transmit oxygen
into the bloodstream.

which is called osmosis...

a woman in half yet?

Oh, Mr. President,
this is indeed a pleasure.

414
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,339
What brings you here?

415
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,383
A bicycle,
but I left it
out in the hall.

416
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,469
Have you got two empty
dunce chairs? I brought
you two empty dunces.

417
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,723
Come in, dunces.
Here they are.
Ten cents a dunce.

418
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,812
Well, all you
need now is
a bowl of cherries.

419
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,231
Find yourselves
a couple of seats.

420
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,410
Now, let us go on
with our lecture.

421
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,205
I wish you'd go on
without your lecture.

422

of that slide?

Well, I think
he was safe at second,
but it was very close.

424

Now let us examine
the circulatory system.

425
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,591
Here is the liver.

426

What, no bacon?
I'd send that back
if I were you.

"The liver,
if neglected, invariably
leads to cirrhosis."

00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,935
Of course, you are
all familiar with
the symptoms of cirrhosis.

429
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,269
Sure.

it up as you go along?

tired from this walk.

can be found in the simplest

I'm sure my students
will bear me out.

You've got some nerve.
Leave me alone.

Let us follow
a corpuscle
on its journey.

Oh, my mistake.
I thought I was a corpuscle.

As you know, there is
constant warfare between
the red and white corpuscles.

Now, then, baboons,
what is a corpuscle?

00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,939
BARAVELLI: That's easy.

453
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:33,860
First it's a captain,
then it's a lieutenant,
then it's a corpuscle.

454
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:38,031
That's fine. Why don't you
bore a hole in yourself
and let the sap run out?

455
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,285
We now find ourselves
among the Alps.

456
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,955
The Alps are a very simple
people living on a diet of
rice and old shoes.

457
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,707
Beyond the Alps
lies more Alps.

458
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,293
And the Lord Alps those
that Alps themselves.

459
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,961
We then come
to the bloodstream.

460
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,172
The blood rushes
from the head
down to the feet,

461
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,632
gets a look at those feet
and rushes back
to the head again.

462
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,052
This is known
as Auction Pinochle.

463
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,347
WAGSTAFF: Now, in studying
your basic metabolism,

464
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,848
we first listen
to your hearts beat.

465
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,975
If your hearts beat
anything but
diamonds and clubs,

466
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,728
it's because your partner
is cheating or your wife.

467
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,522
Now, take this point,
for instance.

468
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,902
That reminds me.
I haven't seen
my son all day.

469
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,905
Well, the human body
takes many strange forms.

470
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,283
Now, here is
a most unusual organ.

471
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:26,037
The organ will play
a solo immediately after
the feature picture.

472
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,207
WAGSTAFF: Scientists
make these deductions
by examining a rat

473
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,792
or your landlord
who won't cut the rent.

474
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,960
And what do they find?
Asparagus.

475
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,254
Now, on closer examination...

476
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,925
Hmm. This needs
closer examination.

477
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:41,177
In fact,
it needs a nightgown.

478
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,347
Baravelli,
who's responsible for this?
Is this your picture?

479
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,516
I don't think so.
It doesn't look like me.

480
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,394
Well, take it out
of here immediately and
hang it up in my bedroom.

481
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,479
Now then, out with it.
Who did it?

482
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,857
WAGSTAFF:
Oh, so you're the culprit.

483
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:58,027
Young man, as you grow older,
you'll find you can't burn
the candle at both ends.

484
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,115
Well, I was wrong.

485
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,783
I knew there was
something you couldn't
burn at both ends,

486
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,034
I thought it was
a candle.

487
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,536
However,
you must be punished.

488
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,121
Just for that,
you stay after school.

489
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,581
But, Professor,
I didn't do anything.

490
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,209
I know, but there's no fun
in keeping him after school.

491
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:17,088
Now, we'll have
no more interruptions.

492
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,716
According to Von Sternmetz,
the eminent physiologist,

493
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,261
"There is ever present
a group of white
phagocytes..."

494
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,477
According to Von Sternmetz,
the eminent physiologist,

495
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,689
"There is present a group
of white phagocytes..."

496
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,361
According to Von...

497
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,072
According
to Von Sternmetz...

498
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,078
According to Von Sternmetz,
the eminent physiologist,

499
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:51,414
"There is present a group
of white phagocytes..."

500
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,334
They are ever present
and they are essential...

501
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,879
They are essential
to prolonging life.

502
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,342
My left wing has been turned.
My rear end has been cut off.

503
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:06,846
But I'll fight it out
on these lines if it
takes all summer.

504
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,514
They got me.

505
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,517
(PHONE RINGING)

506
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,857
Hello.

507
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,026
Oh, it's you, Frank.

508
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,989
Why, of course.
I'd love to have
you come over.

509
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,992
All right. I'll be
expecting you, then.

510
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,203
Good-bye, darling.

511
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,830
Who were you
calling "darling?"

512
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,541
Oh. Frank Wagstaff,
the professor's son.

513
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,710
Say, I didn't tell you
to fall for him.

514
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,296
I just told you
to find out all you
could about his team.

515
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,798
Well, he said
it was a cinch
for Huxley to win.

516
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:47,094
Listen, I've got
my bankroll bet on Darwin
and I'm taking no chances.

517
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:50,139
Before the game starts,
I'll have the Huxley signals.

518
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:52,934
Now, here's down
the hatch and on my way.

519
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,190
See you later.

520
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,901
Good-bye, dear.

521
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:20,419
Are you still here?
I just came in.

522
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,966
What do you mean,
am I still here?
(GIGGLES)

523
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,593
Oh, I mean,
are you here already?

524
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,428
You know, I really
shouldn't be here.

525
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,056
The old man gave me
a terrible bawling
out for seeing you.

526
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,935
Oh, let's not worry
about him. He'll never
know you were here.

527
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,854
How about
a little drink?
All right.

528
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,898
I'll get you one.
Please.

529
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,083
Are you Miss Bailey?

530
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,335
Come, come. One of us
is Miss Bailey, and I'm not.

531
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,129
I'm Miss Bailey
and who are you?

532
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,131
I'm Professor Wagstaff.
Who are you?

533
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,633
Miss Bailey.
Ah, then you are
Miss Bailey.

534
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,969
Thought you could
slip one over on me,
didn't you?

535
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,679
Listen, madam, you've
gotta give my son up.

536
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,723
Give him up?
You can't
take him from me.

537
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,641
He's all I've got
in the world,
except a picture

538
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,435
of George Washington
crossing the Delaware.

539
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,562
But, Professor, I...
Whatever you say
is a lie.

540
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,356
He's only a shell
of his former self,
which nobody can deny.

541
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,441
Whoopee!
(SCOFFS)

542
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,651
I tell you, you're
ruining that boy.
You're ruining him.

543
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,237
Did my son tell you,
you had beautiful eyes?

544
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:29,322
Why, yes.

545
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,949
He told me that too.
He tells that to
everyone he meets.

546
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,784
Oh, I love sitting
on your lap.

547
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:37,163
I could sit here all day
if you didn't stand up.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

Quick! Hurry!
Get out of here.

549
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,508
I don't want any ice.

Who was that?
The iceman.

553
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,902
Is that so? Well, you can't
pull the wool over my ice.
Oh!

554
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:10,780
That iceman stuff
leaves me cold.

555
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:11,947
Here you are...

556
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:15,451
So I caught you at last.
You are fooling around
with this woman.

557
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,119
Oh, the shame of it.

558
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,955
That I should live to see
a son of mine try to take
a dame away from his father.

559
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:21,874
Dad, I can...
Enough of this.
You leave here immediately,

560
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,793
and I'll stay here
and settle
with this woman.

561
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,795
As soon as we're
settled, we'll have
you over for dinner.

562
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,255
On second thought,
I'll go with you.
Come. Follow me.

Oh, yes.
I was on your lap

565
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,648
and doing pretty well
as I recall it.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

566

Quick. Hurry.
Get out. Hurry.

And remember,
stay undercover.

568
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,490
You've got more students
than the college.

Here, lady,
you dropped your ice.

00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:02,415
But I don't
want any ice.
Neither do I.

know what it is.

I'm gonna tell him
he's crazy.

What are you doing here?

Nothing right now, but
I was doing all right
till you came in.

Oh! So you know

Sure. He put me
in business. He got me
on the football team.

Now all I gotta do
is get him off the couch.

I give her singing lessons.

taking singing lessons?

602
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,660
You sing high, huh?

603
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,370
Yes, I have
a falsetto voice.

604
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,704
That's funny.
My last pupil,

605
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,248
she got a
false set of teeth.

606
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,667
Maybe for the first
lesson, it's better
if you don't sing.

607
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,837
And if you don't sing,
I think it's much
better yet. I'll sing.

608

Everyone says I love you

The great, big mosquito
when he sting you

610
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,803
The fly when he get stuck
on the flypaper too

611
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,305
Says I love you

612
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,725
Every time
the cow says moo

613
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,978
She makin' the bull
feel very happy too

614
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,814
And the rooster
when he holler
cock-a-doodle-doodle-do

615
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,899
Says I love you

Christopher Colombo
he write the queen of Spain
a very nice, little note

617
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:43,158
And he write
I love you, baby!

618
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,244
And then he get himself
a great, big boat

619
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,328
He's a wise guy

620
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,664
What do you think
Colombo do

621
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,667
When he come here
in 1492

622
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,169
He say to Pocahontas
Hacha, facha, cacha coo!

623
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:58,007
That means, you little
son of a gun, I love you!

624
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,259
Maybe it's better if
I don't sing too, huh?
Yes.

625
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,011
All right.
I'll play.

I love good music.

628

So do I. Let's get
out of here.
Sit down.

629
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:11,312
I've got to stay here,
but there's no reason

630
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:14,982
why you folks shouldn't
go out into the lobby
till this thing blows over.

631
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,719
Well, that's all
for the first lesson.

632
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,763
I come back next week
and teach you
how to breathe.

633
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,391
And don't breathe
until I see you again.

634
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:34,395
If this is
a singing lesson,
I'm a ring-tailed monkey.

635
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,064
This is a singing lesson,
and keep your family
out of it. Baravelli!

636
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,816
What do you want?
Are you going
my way?

637
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,734
Sure.
Well, you go my way,
and I'll stay here.

638
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,111
No, you don't.
You're leaving together.

639
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,654
And if I find you
guys here again,

640
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,364
it'll be curtains.
Now, on your way.

641
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,786
If my son comes back,
tell him to take the lamp
out of the window.

642
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,590
Dad, you've got
the wrong football
players.

643
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:06,802
You mean the whole team?
No. Baravelli
and the dogcatcher.

644
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,262
They're not
football players
at all.

645
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,556
They must be.
I got 'em out
of a speakeasy.

646
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,765
But you got
the wrong ones.

647
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,184
The two fellows
I told you about are
playing for Darwin.

648
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,894
Send for Baravelli.

649

Scour the grounds.
Don't leave a single
stone unturned.

Don't say nothing.

Come on out.

656
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:45,007
What do you want?
Baravelli, you can fix it
for our team to win.

657
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,925
Oh, no.
I wanna play.

658
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,636
All right. You can play.
There's two football players
on the Darwin team

659
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,055
I want kidnapped.

660
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:53,849
Have you ever had any
experience as a kidnapper?
You bet.

661
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,851
You know what I do
when I kidnap somebody?

662
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:59,146
First I call 'em up
on the telephone, then
I send 'em my chauffeur.

663
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,439
Oh, have you got
a chauffeur?
Yeah.

664
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,648
What kind of a car
have you got?

665
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,401
I no got a car.
I just got a chauffeur.

666
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,487
Maybe I'm crazy,
but when you have
a chauffeur,

667
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,030
aren't you supposed
to have a car?

668
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,114
Well, I had one.

669
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,700
But it cost too much
money to keep a car
and a chauffeur,

670
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:13,285
so I sold the car.

671
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,037
Well, that shows you
how little I know.

672
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:18,040
I would have kept the car
and sold the chauffeur.
That's no good.

673
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,793
I gotta have a chauffeur
to take me to work
in the morning.

674
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:23,170
If you've got no car,
how can he take you
to work?

675
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,714
He don't have
to take me to work.
I no got a job.

676
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,466
Baravelli,
this is the finish.

to stand at the wrong end
of a shooting gallery?

happened yesterday.

I didn't come here
to fight.

681
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,395
You've got to fight.
I've already taken
my coat off.

682
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,231
I wanna talk to
Baravelli.

683
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,483
Now, you wouldn't mind
stepping out, would you?

684
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47,319
I'd love to step out,
but I'd have to
see the girl first.

685
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,238
Baravelli, I've got
a proposition for you.

686
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,366
Watch yourself, Baravelli.
He's almost as crooked
as you are.

Let's go in here.

688

Baravelli, I want you
to do something for me.
I'm busy.

we gotta kidnap a couple
of football players

Is that so?

691
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,591
You don't mean
MacHardie and Mullen?

692
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:13,762
That sounds something like it,
but the fellows I mean
are Mullen and MacHardie.

693
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,430
I'll give you a tip.

live at 39 Hanley Street.

That's fine, thanks.
Now, I want you to
do something for me.

Hey, wait a minute.
These are the
wrong signals.

701
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:41,165
These are Darwin's signals.
Do you think I'd give you
$500 for Darwin's signals?

702
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:44,251
They cost me 200.
I guess I gotta make
a little profit.

here before the game.

747
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,335
Let 'em go.
Luckily, I've got
a duplicate set in my pocket.

748
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,128
I always carry
two of everything.

749
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,923
This is the first time
I've ever been out with
only one woman.

750
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:08,009
Oh, you mean you
take two girls out
every time?

751
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:11,805
Particularly in an automobile.
I hate to see a girl
walk home alone.

752
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:15,850
Do you know, Professor,
I've never seen
football signals.

753
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:19,813
Do you think
a little girl like me
could understand them?

754
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,607
I think a little girl
like you would understand
practically anything.

Is great, big, strong man
gonna tell little icky baby

756
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:29,781
all about the bad
football signals?

757
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,658
Was that you
or the duck?

758
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,578
'Cause if it was you,
I'm gonna finish this
ride with the duck.

759
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,998
If icky baby don't learn
about the football signals,

760
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,333
icky baby gonna cry.

761
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,711

If icky girl keep on
talking that way,

kick all her teeth
right down her throat.

Naughty man
is only fooling.

764
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,095
Just for that
I'm coming
right over there

765
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,014
and smother naughty
man with kisses.

766
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:56,891
You couldn't make
that onions instead,
could you?

767
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:02,272
Oh, so that's your game.
That's your game, is it?

Professor Wagstaff.
Professor Wagstaff.

770
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,447
Oh, just call me Quincy.

771
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:12,907
After you get to
know me better,
you can call me Quince.

772
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:16,453
Oh, throw me
the lifesaver.
The lifesaver.

773
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:21,458
Oh, Professor Wagstaff.
Please hurry, Professor.
Oh, Professor.

Hello. Yeah,
this is MacHardie.

777
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:43,355
(CHUCKLES)
So they're coming
right over, eh?

778
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,733
Okay, Mr. Jennings.
We'll take care of 'em.

779
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:47,859
Can you beat it?

780
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:50,111
Jennings says
Baravelli and
the dogcatcher

781
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:53,073
are coming over here
to kidnap us, to keep
us out of the game.

(BOTH LAUGH)

783
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:01,998
This is the place.
Now, how are we
gonna catch 'em?

784
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,292
Oh, that's for
catching flies.

785
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:07,629
Baseball players catch flies.
We look for football players.

786
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,882
You bring the tools?
You got the shovel,
the ax and the pick?

787
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,634
Where's the pick?

788
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:16,554
No, that's no pick.
That's a hog.

789
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,224
A hog. Don't you know
what a hog is?

790
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:23,228
Oh, come on. Let's get busy.
We gotta kidnap a couple
of football players.

791
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,775
We're looking
for Mullen and MacHardie.

792
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:32,153
That's us.
What can we do for you?
You got a brother?

793
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,239
No.
You got a sister?

794
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,991
Yeah.
Well, your sister,
she's a very sick man.

795
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,618
You'd better
come with us.

796
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:41,079
Yeah?
What happened
to her?

797
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,123
She had an accident
in her automobile.

798
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:44,708
She has
no automobile.

799
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,835
Well, maybe she fall
off her horse.
I don't look very close.

800
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,461
Come on.
We take you in our car.

801
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:51,339
You will, eh?
Well, I have
no sister.

802
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:54,175
That's all right.
We no got a car.
Come on.

803
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:58,096
So you think
you're gonna take us
for a ride, eh?

804
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:00,765

take a long time.

Now you're
getting someplace.

813
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:49,773
Hey, Pinky, you'd better
think of something else.

814
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:56,613
I'm exhausted too.
I can't think of anything.

Maybe you fellas
got an idea.

816
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,951
I'll say we got an idea.
Where's that rope, Ed?

That's fine.

tie on the bed.

going to do?
