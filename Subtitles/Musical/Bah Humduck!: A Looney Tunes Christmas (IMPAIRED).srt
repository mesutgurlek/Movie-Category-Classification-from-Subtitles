Listen, Mr. Ghost, I'm not sure
exactly what you're after...

480
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,165
You!

481
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,291
I don't know what they're paying
you down at the ghost company,

482
00:35:45,316 --> 00:35:47,881
but whatever it is,
I'll triple it!

486
00:36:05,514 --> 00:36:08,842
Try that again
and this time, enunciate.

Christmas future!

489
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,911
Well, I don't mean to tell you
your business, mumbles,

490
00:36:20,936 --> 00:36:23,177
but I think you've got
the wrong holiday.

491
00:36:23,202 --> 00:36:26,617
This place has a distinctly
Halloweeny vibe to it.

492
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,325
Who's the stiff
taking a dirt nap?

493
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,667
PORKY: (STUTTERING) Mr. Daffy
Duck never had a family,

494
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,599
or friends for that matter.

495
00:36:45,624 --> 00:36:48,748
But maybe now he'll finally
get what he always wanted.

496
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:52,342
To be alone
with his money, forever.

497
00:36:53,186 --> 00:36:55,722
Surely I did
some good for others.

498
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:59,383
I know, I provided them
with gainful employment.

499
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,453
Daffy tried to leave his store
to himself in his will,

500
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,288
which, of course, is illegal.

501
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:09,021
As a result, Lucky Duck has been
closed and we're all out of jobs.

502
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:12,238
But for the first time in years,

503
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:15,275
we can all spend Christmas
with our families.

504
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:19,212
Good-bye, Mr. Duck.

505
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,006
Or as you liked
to say, bah, humduck.

506
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,659
Please! Do something!

507
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:39,899
I don't wanna end up
lonely and alone.

508
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,674
(BURPING)

509
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:44,871
Now, that was just plain rude.

510
00:37:46,107 --> 00:37:49,836
Mr. Daffy? I know
everybody hated you.

511
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:51,945
But I never hated you.

512
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,070
Because I know as much
as anyone how sad and angry

513
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:59,591
it can make a person to be
without family at the holidays.

514
00:38:00,936 --> 00:38:03,490
So, if you're up there watching,

515
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:06,232
or down there, in your case,
I want you to know that

516
00:38:06,257 --> 00:38:09,763
you don't have to be
one anymore.

517
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:13,505
'Cause from now on, every
Christmas, I'll come visit you.

518
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:18,138
In case you don't know, it's the one day
of the year when everyone is family.

519
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:20,836
I made you
some Christmas cookies.

520
00:38:20,861 --> 00:38:23,325
Merry Christmas, Mr. Duck.

521

I said I was sorry before.

But now I really am.

00:38:42,384 --> 00:38:44,931
Can I please have second chance?

527
00:38:46,963 --> 00:38:48,997
Go!

528
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,940
I'm alive! I'm okay!

529
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:05,952
More importantly,
I'm a changed duck,

530
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:08,478

of giving!

Then I haven't missed it.

00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:29,366
I'm giving you a raise and a

you should make it by yesterday!
