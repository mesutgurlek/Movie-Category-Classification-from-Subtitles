Come on! Follow me!

00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:34,332
Oh, boy!

Hee hee!

00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:32,858
Yeee!

Hee hee!

00:34:52,253 --> 00:34:53,880
Aah!

"Worse than death"?

"Slow and painful"?

522
00:34:59,561 --> 00:35:03,895
Does that look
like misery to you?

523
00:35:03,965 --> 00:35:07,230
Tell me. Does that
look terrible to you?

524
00:35:07,302 --> 00:35:09,497
It looks nice,
very nice.

525
00:35:09,571 --> 00:35:12,506
Don't you think so,
snooksie-poo?

526
00:35:12,574 --> 00:35:15,008
Yes, I think so.

527
00:35:15,076 --> 00:35:19,274
That's precisely
what's wrong...

528

you moron!

529
00:35:21,082 --> 00:35:23,516
Punishment isn't
supposed to be nice.

530
00:35:23,585 --> 00:35:26,679
It's supposed to
be punishing.

531
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:33,026
I should have
turned him to stone

532

Iike I wanted to
in the first place!

533
00:35:35,463 --> 00:35:39,024
Perhaps you're
overreacting, love lumps.

534
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,466
It can't be as bad as--

535
00:35:41,536 --> 00:35:43,470
as good as all that.

536
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:45,597
I know that place.
It's very-- Ooh!

537
00:35:45,673 --> 00:35:48,437
Very-- Look!

538
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,445
What's happening to it?

539
00:35:51,513 --> 00:35:54,243
Oh, well,
you have to wait.

540
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:56,545
Wait for you to wreck it
even more?

541
00:35:56,618 --> 00:35:58,984
It looks stupid!

542
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:05,087
Oh! He's more troll-like
than Stanley!

543
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,990
He's rude!
He's smart-mouthed!

544
00:36:07,061 --> 00:36:09,222
Ha ha ha!

545
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:12,425
Ha ha ha!

546
00:36:14,068 --> 00:36:17,094
I adore him!

547
00:36:17,171 --> 00:36:19,503
And I'm going to send him
a little something

548
00:36:19,574 --> 00:36:24,944
that will finish our Stanley
for now and forever!

Ooh!

00:36:27,515 --> 00:36:31,007
Ha ha ha ha!

551
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:35,522
The boy will cry
a sea of tears.

552
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:39,026
The wind
will blow them well.

553
00:36:39,093 --> 00:36:42,529
A thunderbolt
to shake their hearts

554
00:36:42,597 --> 00:36:47,034
and drown them
in the spell!

Oh, come on.

It's Gnorga!

a curse on you!

you could stop now, huh?

How'd that happen?

586
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:57,456
Why, I believe

587
00:38:57,531 --> 00:39:00,466
you believed in saving
your sister so much

588
00:39:00,534 --> 00:39:03,469
that for just
a moment there,

589
00:39:03,537 --> 00:39:05,767
your--

590
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,172

than Gnorga's.

Yeah. Oh, sure!
That was a good deed.

593
00:39:13,814 --> 00:39:16,009
I believe there's no end
to what you can do

if you set
your mind to it.

I keep thinking when I find
my patch of green,

596
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:25,286
I'll invite every good troll
to come live with me.

and they'll have green thumbs.

Oh, sure.
You have to.

602

Anything that's real
starts with a dream.

show you how it works.

in my dreams.

You got to
have a dream.

I haven't got
any dreams of my own.

[Alan ] I felt terrible
about having to run out.

He was so upset.

she hardly knew
they were here.

Well, we both have been

Maybe he's feeling
a little insecure.

Well... what
about today, huh?

You know,
your mother and I

1042
01:06:07,557 --> 01:06:10,993
thought of a few fun
things we could do.

today maybe
