1
00:00:01,665 --> 00:00:02,932
<i>'t know why anyone would miss
an episode of Glee,</i>

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,367
<i>but here's what's been
happening in case you did:</i>

3
00:00:04,435 --> 00:00:06,035
<i>Quinn's parents found out
she's pregnant</i>

4
00:00:06,103 --> 00:00:08,204
<i>so they kicked her out.
I needed my mom.</i>

5
00:00:08,272 --> 00:00:09,239
<i>MERCEDES: So it's decided.</i>

6
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:10,406
You move in with me.

7
00:00:10,474 --> 00:00:12,408
<i>Jessie dropped Rachel and McKinley</i>

8
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:13,977
<i>and the New Directions and he's
back on Vocal Adrenaline</i>

9
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:16,212
<i>which freaked everybody out and
convinced them they can't</i>

10
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,547
<i>beat them at Regionals and if they
don't place at Regionals,</i>

11
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:18,781
<i>the club is over,
which would be awful.</i>

12
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:20,517
<i>And that's what you missed on Glee.</i>

13
00:00:29,527 --> 00:00:31,761
Hey, buddy, see you on Saturday.

14
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:33,162
Wait. What?

15
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,464
At Regionals. Didn't you hear?

16
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:35,765
I'm one of the judges.

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,004
You cannot allow this to happen!

18
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:42,405
It's out of my hands, William.

19
00:00:42,473 --> 00:00:43,806
I have no control over what

20
00:00:43,874 --> 00:00:45,675
the Show Choir Governing Board
says or does.

21
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:47,577
Let me break it down for you, Will.

22
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:49,345
It's been decided that
this year's Regionals

23
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:50,747
will be judged by celebrities.

24
00:00:50,814 --> 00:00:51,748
And I'm a celebrity

25
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:52,916
now, William.

26
00:00:52,983 --> 00:00:54,183
Now I realize my cultural

27
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:55,752
ascendance only serves

28
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:57,053
to illuminate your own banality,

29
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:58,154
but face it.

30
00:00:58,222 --> 00:01:00,223
I'm a legend. It's happened.

31
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:03,359
Do you have any idea how hard
my kids have been working, Sue?

32
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:04,928
I have to be honest, Will.

33
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:07,597
I'm having a really
difficult time hearing

34
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:09,666
anything you have
to say today because

35
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:11,200
your hair looks like
a briar patch.

36
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:12,702
I keep expecting racist

37
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,771
animated Disney characters to pop up

38
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:17,707
and start singing songs
about living on the bayou.

39
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:19,175
Principal Figgins, I am begging you.

40
00:01:19,243 --> 00:01:21,344
Do not let her do this to those kids.

41
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:23,046
William, I resent the implication

42
00:01:23,113 --> 00:01:24,881
that I don't play by the rules.

43
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:26,849
You leaked our set list at Sectionals, Sue.

44
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:28,017
I have no memory of that.

45
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:29,452
I will not let you do this.

46
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,921
We have worked ourselves to
the bone to get where we are.

47
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:33,990
I'm sorry, Will, but our arrangement stands.

48
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:35,825
You must win or place at Regionals,

49
00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:37,126
or I'm disbanding the club.

50
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:38,761
If I were you, I would spend

51
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:41,130
less time complaining to me and more time

52
00:01:41,198 --> 00:01:43,232
convincing Judge Sylvester
here that your New Directions

53
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,500
have got the goods!

54
00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:46,302
Good luck with that, Will.

55
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:01,517
I can't do this.

56
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:02,986
Yes, you can.

57
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:04,587
Have another wine cooler.

58
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:06,322
I'm president of the Celibacy Club.

59
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,991
I took a vow.

60
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:10,393
So did Santana and Brittany, and I did them.

61
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:11,594
What about Finn?

62
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:12,795
He's your best friend.

63
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:14,130
Come on. We're in high school.

64
00:02:14,198 --> 00:02:16,699
You think either one of
us is going to give a damn

65
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,234
about Finn in three years?

66
00:02:18,302 --> 00:02:21,004
Life's just a bunch of
experiences, you know?

67
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:24,107
You don't get a medal at the
finish line for being good.

68
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:26,576
You just get dead.

69
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:28,144
Okay, but you can't tell anybody.

70
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:30,246
I can't lose my rep.

71
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:32,849
Our secret, baby.

72
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,117
What about protection?

73
00:02:34,184 --> 00:02:36,219
I got it, trust me.

74
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:40,423
This isn't just another hookup for me.

75
00:02:46,964 --> 00:02:48,297
Tell me one more time.

76
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:50,433
You're not fat.

77
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:51,701
<i>WILL: Quinn?</i>

78
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:52,835
Quinn?

79
00:02:53,704 --> 00:02:54,937
Are you all right?

80
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:59,042
It's been a long year.

81
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:01,110
Yeah.

82
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:03,179
Oh, you need some help with those plates?

83
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:05,248
I'm not due for a month.

84
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:07,583
Think I can handle a stack of plates.

85
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:09,952
Right. I'm...

86
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,988
Yeah.

87
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,228
No one wants any pizza?

88
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:22,965
All right, well, uh, let's get started.

89
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:25,001
Thank you for coming to the first

90
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,903
annual New Directions' Regionals'

91
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,304
set list nominations party.

92
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:30,506
What's the point, Mr. Shue?

93
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:32,475
Coach Sylvester's one of the judges.

94
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:34,043
She's gonna crush us.

95
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:35,044
Artie, you don't know that.

96
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:36,946
Yes, we do.

97
00:03:37,014 --> 00:03:38,915
She told us at Cheerios practice.

98
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:41,117
Yeah, she said,
"I'm going to crush Glee Club."

99
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:42,852
PUCK: A whole freaking year.

100
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,620
All that hard work for nothing.

101
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:49,559
I'm sorry.

102
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:53,629
I just really love you guys.

103
00:03:53,697 --> 00:03:55,732
You know how many Facebook friends I had

104
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,166
before I joined Glee Club?

105
00:03:57,234 --> 00:04:00,103
Two. My parents.

106
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,971
Rachel was right.

107
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,708
Being a part of something special--

108
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:07,677
it made me special.

109
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:09,512
I just can't

110
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,280
believe it's going to be over in a week.

111
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,518
Wait. Who says it's going to be over?

112
00:04:15,586 --> 00:04:17,587
Please. You think Puck and Santana

113
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:19,021
are going to even acknowledge

114
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:21,057
my existence once we're not

115
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,525
in Glee Club together anymore?

116
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:24,393
She has a point.

117
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:25,628
Mr. Schuester?

118
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,599
Do you think instead of nominating songs,

119
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,368
we can just... all go around the room

120
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:34,437
and talk about things that we loved about

121
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:36,639
Glee Club this year?

122
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:39,442
<i>WILL: It took everything I had not to
cry.</i>

123
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,345
It's like they've all
walked a thousand miles

124
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:44,313
just to get punched in the stomach.

125
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:47,650
What exactly are you
looking for from me here?

126
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,754
Some guidance.

127
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:55,124
Do you remember when you were going

128
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:57,493
to quit teaching and become an accountant,

129
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:00,596
and I showed you that video of
yourself singing at Nationals,

130
00:05:00,664 --> 00:05:04,600
and you said that that was the
happiest moment of your life?

131
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:08,070
Do you remember why?

132
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:11,774
Because I loved what I was doing.

133
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:13,609
And isn't that what you've been drilling

134
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:15,478
into their heads all year?

135
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:18,214
That that feeling is way more important

136
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:19,649
than winning or losing?

137
00:05:24,388 --> 00:05:25,955
I miss you.

138
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:29,792
I'm seeing someone.

139
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:32,662
What?

140
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:33,930
His-his name's Carl.

141
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:36,465
Carl... Howell.

142
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:38,000
He's my dentist.

143
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:40,303
He's always been very impressed
with my oral hygiene,

144
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,139
and the last time I was there,
he was showing me

145
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:45,374
the machines that they use
to sterilize their tools,

146
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:46,943
and he asked me out.

147
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,346
We've been going out
every night since then.

148
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:51,647
You two haven't...?

149
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:53,883
Sorry. I'm-I'm sorry.

150
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:55,351
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, that's... No.

151
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,053
It's fine. That's fine.

152
00:06:00,224 --> 00:06:02,291
I just feel like you and
I had our shot, Will.

153
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,460
Thanks for the help.

154
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:10,266
Um, no, by the way.

155
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:11,968
We haven't.

156
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:31,754
¶¶  Up and down the boulevard ¶¶

157
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:34,423

¶¶  In the night. ¶¶

163
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:02,485
Hey! We need to talk.

164
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:07,890
We had a chance of keeping it together

165
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,992
at Mr. Shue's until you decided to bail.

166
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,795
You're our leader, Rachel.

167
00:07:12,863 --> 00:07:15,097
The way you're on everyone
all the time is annoying, but

168
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:16,532
it's also what keeps the club motivated.

169
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,167
You and I are going to fix this.

170
00:07:18,235 --> 00:07:21,037
We're going to Regionals,
and we're going to win this thing.

171
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,553
RACHEL: Mr. Schuester, Finn and I

172
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:39,021
have something we want to say to you.

173
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:40,890
Me first. Have a seat.

174
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:48,497
Nine months ago,
there were five of you in here.

175
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,100
And we sucked.

176
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:53,102
I mean, we really sucked.

177
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,471
Bad.

178
00:07:57,574 --> 00:08:01,744
One day,
all of you are going to be gone.

179
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:03,913
And all of this, all of us

180
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:06,415
will be nothing but a hazy memory.

181
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:09,185
It will take you a second
to remember everyone's name.

182
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:11,387
Someone will have to remind you

183
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:13,289
of the songs we sung, the solos

184
00:08:13,357 --> 00:08:15,992
you got or didn't get.

185
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:18,461
Life only

186
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:20,796
really has one beginning

187
00:08:20,864 --> 00:08:24,100
and one end, and the rest is just

188
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,168
a whole lot of middle.

189
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:29,672
And I love you guys too much

190
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,841
to let you not make the most of it.

191
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:34,477
Now, I was going to quit once,

192
00:08:34,544 --> 00:08:37,480
but you guys brought me back with "
Don't Stop Believing."

193
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:39,148
It was a nine,

194
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:41,317
but we are going to make it a ten.

195
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:43,019
We're doing "Don't Stop" at Regionals?

196
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:43,919
And then some.

197
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:46,522
We are doing a Journey medley.

198
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,524
Because who cares what
happens when we get there

199
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:51,560
when the getting there has been so much fun?

200
00:08:54,498 --> 00:08:56,165
Rachel?

201
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:58,300
You had something you wanted to say?

202
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,772
Just that we're all really glad
you didn't become an accountant.

203
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:04,673
Regionals,

204
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:07,449
here we come!

205
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,552
<i>And now, our panel of judges.</i>

206

a platinum recording artist 20 times over,

208
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:38,926
the inimitable Mr. Josh Groban!

209
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:43,731
She's a four-time Grammy winner

210
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,266
who starred in the highest-grossing

211
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,169
movie musical of all time, Ms.
Olivia Newton-John!

212
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:51,339
He's a two-time local

213
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:53,107
Emmy winner and broadcasting icon,

214
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,510
WOHN news anchor Rod Remington!

215
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:00,348
She is fresh off her fifth consecutive

216
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:01,582
National Cheerleading Title

217
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,184
and author of the soo
n-to-be-published memoir,

218
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:04,719
<i>I'm A Winner and You're Fat,</i>

219
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:06,320
Ohio's home-grown iconoclast,

220
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:08,322
Coach Sue Sylvester!

221
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:20,067
And now, our first
performance of the evening,

222
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:23,504
from Westvale High in
scenic Fort Wayne, Indiana,

223
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:25,907
Aural Intensity!

224
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:29,443
: ¶¶  You raise me up... ¶¶

225
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:31,145
¶¶  You have to believe we are magic... ¶¶

226
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,114
A mash up of Olivia Newto
n-John and Josh Groban.

227
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:34,882
Are you kidding me?!

228
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,218
Somebody tipped them off about
the judges. Guys, we can't

229
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:39,020
get distracted by what the
other teams are doing.

230
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:41,889
We just got to keep our
heads in the game and focus.

231
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:43,424
Even though we know we can't win?

232
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:44,959
Yes.

233
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:49,463
If this is only about winning for you guys,

234
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:52,800
then I owe you all an apology,
because I've failed you.

235
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:54,635
And we should just all go home,

236
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:56,137
because it means we've already lost.

237
00:10:56,205 --> 00:10:58,272
Besides,

238
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,142
we have got something that
the other groups don't.

239
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,310
ARTIE: What?

240
00:11:02,377 --> 00:11:03,511
Finn's dancing.

241
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,712
Right? Come on.

242
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,948
Now let's get out there. We got two minutes.

243
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:07,982
Aural Intensity's almost finished.

244
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,750
Bring it in. Come on. Come on.

245
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:12,353
Let's go, go, go, go, go and...

246
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,388
ALL: Whoa!

247
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:26,901
Break a leg.

248
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:29,070
I love you.

249
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:31,372

00:24:50,043 --> 00:24:51,610
But we beat you today.

472
00:24:51,678 --> 00:24:54,646
Jessie's a good singer, but

473
00:24:54,714 --> 00:24:56,648
you and I both know he
doesn't have much heart.

474
00:24:56,716 --> 00:24:59,451
Vocal Adrenaline's best days are behind it.

475
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:01,520
So I have a proposition for you.

476
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:04,390
Come teach at McKinley.

477
00:25:04,457 --> 00:25:05,557
Excuse me?

478
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:08,494
You and-and Mr. Schuester
could be co-directors.

479
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:10,562
We'd be unstoppable.

480
00:25:12,132 --> 00:25:14,700
There's so much that you can teach me.

481
00:25:16,236 --> 00:25:18,804
<i>So much only you can teach me.</i>

482
00:25:18,872 --> 00:25:22,641
Oh, Rachel, I can't do this anymore.

483
00:25:22,709 --> 00:25:24,543
I'm tired of coaching glee club.

484
00:25:24,611 --> 00:25:25,911
I want a life.

485
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:27,913
It took meeting you to realize

486
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:30,349
all the stuff that I missed out on.

487
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:32,217
I need some balance, you know?

488
00:25:32,285 --> 00:25:35,387
I need a house and a garden

489
00:25:35,455 --> 00:25:37,222
and a dog, a f...

490
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,625
family.

491
00:25:42,028 --> 00:25:44,763
I missed out on my chance with you,

492
00:25:44,831 --> 00:25:46,632
and it kills me.

493
00:25:46,699 --> 00:25:48,133
And I can't let that happen again.

494
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:56,408
Where's the rest of your team?

495
00:25:56,476 --> 00:25:58,777
They're, uh... they're at the hospital.

496
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:00,946
Quinn had her baby. Is she okay?

497
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:02,414
Yeah, she's fine.

498
00:26:02,482 --> 00:26:04,149
It was, um...

499
00:26:04,217 --> 00:26:06,952
It's a beautiful baby girl.

500
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:12,691
Newton-John? You're dead to me.

501
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:15,227
Remington, Horsey,
have a seat and listen up.

502
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:16,395
I don't care who comes in first,

503
00:26:16,463 --> 00:26:18,797
I don't care who places send, but I have

504
00:26:18,865 --> 00:26:20,833
a very strong opinion
about who comes in third.

505
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,000
Sue, if I may.

506
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:24,303
That "Bohemian Rhapsody"

507
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:28,507
had me a-movin' and a-shakin',
and I'm talking old school.

508
00:26:28,575 --> 00:26:30,642
<i>You know, I partied with Freddy
Mercury back in the '70s,</i>

509
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:34,246
and I partied... hard,
if you know what I mean.

510
00:26:34,314 --> 00:26:37,249
Back then, people weren't
so obsessed with labels.

511
00:26:37,317 --> 00:26:38,617
I, for one, was offended

512
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:41,086
that only one of the groups
chose to honor me in song.

513
00:26:41,154 --> 00:26:43,088
I think Aural Intensity should win.

514
00:26:43,156 --> 00:26:44,723
Yes.

515
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:47,659
Two questions. One: Are you single?

516
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:51,296
And two: How about those New Directions?

517
00:26:51,364 --> 00:26:54,566
I liked them. I thought
they had a lot of... heart.

518
00:26:54,634 --> 00:26:56,702
Heart? Oh, please.

519
00:26:56,769 --> 00:26:58,971
Talk about blatant tokenism.

520
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,641
That whole "We're inspiring, we're a ragtag

521
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:05,177
bunch of misfits" thing is so 2009.

522
00:27:05,245 --> 00:27:07,513
I couldn't agree more. Let's vote.

523
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,181
The production values simply weren't there.

524
00:27:09,249 --> 00:27:11,250
Couldn't they afford better costumes?

525
00:27:11,317 --> 00:27:13,252
Are they a poor person school?

526
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:15,254
GROBAN: I thought that
brunette had an amazing voice.

527
00:27:15,321 --> 00:27:16,822
Brunettes have no place

528
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,890
in show business.

529
00:27:17,957 --> 00:27:20,158
Oh, come on. They're just kids.

530
00:27:20,226 --> 00:27:22,227
That's no excuse. By the time I was 14,

531
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:23,695
I'd already formed a band.

532
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:25,430
When Josh Groban was their age,

533
00:27:25,498 --> 00:27:27,766
<i>he was already in The Mickey Mouse Club or
something.</i>

534
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:30,202
As the only educator here, let me point out

535
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,670
that not all kids are afforded

536
00:27:31,738 --> 00:27:33,372
the same opportunities as others.

537
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:35,674
Is that what you tell yourself
to get to sleep at night?

538
00:27:35,742 --> 00:27:40,212
Some people just simply don't have talent.

539
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,648
You think you're a celebrity. You're not.

540
00:27:42,715 --> 00:27:45,484
You just try hard. That's about it.

541
00:27:45,552 --> 00:27:48,020
Olivia Newton-John has a valid point here.

542
00:27:48,087 --> 00:27:49,621
You have a lot in common

543
00:27:49,689 --> 00:27:51,723
with those kids at your school, Sue.

544
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:55,227
Underachievers with delusions of grandeur.

545
00:27:55,295 --> 00:27:57,195
Dagnabbit!

546
00:27:57,263 --> 00:27:59,598
Now even I have to admit,
I'm a little confused

547
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:01,733
as to what Sue is doing in this room.

548
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:03,635
Wasn't the theme tonight
supposed to be celebrity judges?

549
00:28:03,703 --> 00:28:05,137
Kiss my ass, Josh Groban!

550
00:28:05,204 --> 00:28:07,406
I am a internationall
y-ranked cheerleading coach!

551
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:09,741
Who lives in Ohio. When this is done

552
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:13,579
today, Josh and I are flying
back to L.A. first class.

553
00:28:13,646 --> 00:28:15,347
You'll be staying here.

554
00:28:15,415 --> 00:28:17,015
Just like those kids.

555
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,684
I think we've all made up our minds.

556
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:20,452
Let's vote.

557
00:28:45,812 --> 00:28:47,746
Thank you all for coming.

558
00:28:47,814 --> 00:28:49,715
As you all know, glee club

559
00:28:49,782 --> 00:28:51,483
is such an important...

560
00:28:51,551 --> 00:28:53,619
And I honestly can't even
finish that sentence.

561
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:55,053
So let's just get to it.

562
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:05,464
The 2010 Midwest Regional Runners-up

563
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:09,034
from Fort Wayne, Indiana,

564
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:10,769
the not-at-all stupidly-named

565
00:29:10,837 --> 00:29:12,204
Aural Intensity!

566
00:29:26,152 --> 00:29:27,953
SUE: Very good.

567
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:29,988
Mm-hmm.

568
00:29:33,226 --> 00:29:34,493
And now,

569
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:39,364
your 2010 Midwest Regional
Show Choir Champions

570
00:29:49,075 --> 00:29:51,009
Vocal Adrenaline!

571
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:28,046
We didn't even place.

572
00:30:45,614 --> 00:30:47,615
Love. She looks like you.

573
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:51,219
Do you want to keep her?

574
00:30:51,286 --> 00:30:53,221
No.

575
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:55,590
Do you?

576
00:30:57,793 --> 00:31:00,995
Did you love me?

577
00:31:01,964 --> 00:31:03,898
Yes.

578
00:31:03,966 --> 00:31:05,833
Especially now.

579
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,981
Which one is yours?

580
00:31:22,217 --> 00:31:24,151
What are you doing here?

581
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:26,888
I see her now.

582
00:31:28,123 --> 00:31:30,124
She looks like you.

583
00:31:32,494 --> 00:31:33,961
Does she have a name?

584
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:35,863
No.

585
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:37,098
Beth.

586
00:31:37,165 --> 00:31:39,166
Pretty.

587
00:31:40,168 --> 00:31:41,736
I like that name.

588
00:31:43,272 --> 00:31:44,639
How do you even call yourself a principal?

589
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:46,274
Okay, this is... this is it. This is not...

590
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:55,983
Emma?

591
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:58,419
Emma?! What was that about? It's so unfair.

592
00:31:58,487 --> 00:32:00,855
Will, your kids have
worked so hard for this.

593
00:32:00,923 --> 00:32:03,691
Did you know he's already given
your choir room to the Mock UN?

594
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,427
A deal's a deal. We lost, Emma.

595
00:32:06,495 --> 00:32:07,595
Because Sue cheated!

596
00:32:07,663 --> 00:32:09,664
She cheated, Will, and where do you think

597
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:11,432
all that money's going? It's going right

598
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,767
into her pockets. We just...

599
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:14,335
We can't let her win this one!

600
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:17,004
How can you just stand there
and be so calm about this?

601
00:32:17,072 --> 00:32:18,773
How can you just give up so easily?

602
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,241
I've tried, Emma,

603
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:21,475
okay? It...

604
00:32:21,543 --> 00:32:22,576
It-It's over.

605
00:32:22,644 --> 00:32:23,811
No. No, it's never over.

606
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:25,379
I don't care what anybody says.

607
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:26,914
Some things are worth fighting for.

608
00:32:26,982 --> 00:32:28,349
You mean like the kids? Yes, of course.

609
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:30,051
Anything else? No.

610
00:32:30,118 --> 00:32:32,353
No. This is about the glee club.
This is not about us.

611
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:34,522
The hell it is.

612
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:35,790
I love you, Emma.

613
00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:39,660
There, I finally said it.

614
00:32:39,728 --> 00:32:41,195
And you love me, and dentist or no,

615
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:43,164
this thing isn't over between us.

616
00:32:50,706 --> 00:32:52,306
RACHEL: Mr. Schuester?

617
00:32:52,374 --> 00:32:53,674
Yeah.

618
00:32:53,742 --> 00:32:56,444
Can you please come to the auditorium?

619
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:57,745
Sure.

620
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:06,420
So we have something we need to say to you.

621
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,924
In the beginning of this year,

622
00:33:09,992 --> 00:33:12,393
I was just another football player.

623
00:33:14,396 --> 00:33:15,329
I had a stutter.

624
00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:17,565
I was a closeted diva.

625
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:19,400
I used to be captain of the Cheerios.

626
00:33:19,468 --> 00:33:21,369
I was afraid to dance outside my room.

627
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:23,037
I hated everyone in this club.

628
00:33:23,105 --> 00:33:24,205
So did I.

629
00:33:24,272 --> 00:33:26,540
I wasn't honest about who I was.

630
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:29,310
I was tossing kids into Dumpsters.

631
00:33:29,378 --> 00:33:31,846
I had never kissed a girl before.

632
00:33:31,913 --> 00:33:33,914
And I was getting slushied.

633
00:33:36,018 --> 00:33:38,919
I didn't-I didn't have a father.

634
00:33:40,455 --> 00:33:43,357
Someone I could look up to.

635
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:45,426
Model myself after.

636
00:33:47,763 --> 00:33:51,098
Someone who could show me what
it really meant to be a man.

637
00:33:53,101 --> 00:33:56,771
We don't care what the judges say.

638
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:59,040
We won.

639
00:33:59,107 --> 00:34:00,708
Because we had you as a teacher.

640
00:34:00,776 --> 00:34:03,077
MERCEDES: And Glee Club will never end,

641
00:34:03,145 --> 00:34:06,714
Mr. Shue, because...

642
00:34:06,782 --> 00:34:09,116
you are Glee Club.

643
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:13,254
And you're in all of us now.

644
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:30,771
¶¶  Those schoolgirl days ¶¶

645
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:33,207
¶¶  Of telling tales ¶¶

646
00:34:33,275 --> 00:34:37,912
¶¶  And biting nails are gone ¶¶

647
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:45,186
¶¶  But in my mind ¶¶

648
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:49,090
¶¶  I know they will ¶¶

649
00:34:49,157 --> 00:34:54,628
¶¶  Still live on and on ¶¶

650
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:58,032
¶¶  But how do you thank someone ¶¶

651
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:03,571
¶¶  Who has taken you from
crayons to perfume? ¶¶

652
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:07,208
¶¶  Oh, it isn't easy ¶¶

653
00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:12,713
¶¶  But I'll try ¶¶

654
00:35:12,781 --> 00:35:17,518
¶¶  If you wanted the sky,
I would write across the sky ¶¶

655
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:21,288
¶¶  In letters that would soar ¶¶

656
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:24,892
¶¶  A thousand feet high ¶¶

657
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,565
¶¶  To Sir, with love ¶¶

658
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:38,172
¶¶  The time has come ¶¶

659
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,608
¶¶  For closing books ¶¶

660
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:45,846
¶¶  And long last looks must end ¶¶

661
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:52,119
¶¶  And as I leave ¶¶

662
00:35:52,187 --> 00:35:56,257
¶¶  I know that I am leaving ¶¶

663
00:35:56,324 --> 00:36:00,161
¶¶  My best friend ¶¶

664
00:36:02,164 --> 00:36:05,599
¶¶  A friend who taught me right from wrong ¶¶

665
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:09,637
¶¶  And weak from strong,
that's a lot to learn ¶¶

666
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:17,878
¶¶  What can I give you in return? ¶¶

667
00:36:17,946 --> 00:36:21,582
¶¶  Oh, if you wanted the moon ¶¶

668
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,885
¶¶  I would try to make a start ¶¶

669
00:36:24,953 --> 00:36:28,422
¶¶  But I would rather ¶¶

670
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:32,126
¶¶  You let me give my heart ¶¶

671
00:36:32,194 --> 00:36:39,133
¶¶  To Sir, with love. ¶¶

672
00:37:02,275 --> 00:37:04,176
It's as barren as me in here, Will.

673
00:37:06,379 --> 00:37:07,746
Moving on to greener pastures?

674
00:37:07,814 --> 00:37:09,815
Did you just come to gloat, Sue?

675
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:10,983
Mostly.

676
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:13,953
Well... congratulations.

677
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,322
You got what you wanted.

678
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:18,057
I should shake your hand.

679
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,625
Not unless you got some hand sanitizer.

680
00:37:19,693 --> 00:37:22,294
I've seen that car you drive;
I don't want to catch poor.

681
00:37:22,362 --> 00:37:24,363
Explain something to me.

682
00:37:24,431 --> 00:37:27,366
Maybe we weren't good enough yet
to beat Vocal Adrenaline-- fine.

683
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:30,069
But we were so much better
than Aural Intensity.

684
00:37:30,137 --> 00:37:32,771
Oh, William, I can't reveal
how the voting went down.

685
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:35,040
That would betray my sacred
oath as judge or something.

686
00:37:35,108 --> 00:37:36,642
The results simply show

687
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,377
the other clubs to be more deserving.

688
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:42,081
<i>All I can say is casting my vote was
easy.</i>

689
00:37:42,149 --> 00:37:44,450
<i>It reflected exactly how
I felt in my heart</i>

690
00:37:44,518 --> 00:37:46,485
<i>about which team should win.</i>

691
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,859
Well, Sue, congratulations.

692
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:56,929
You win.

693
00:37:56,997 --> 00:37:57,997
I lose.

694
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,602
The kids lose.

695
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,871
I know you think I'm heartless, Will,

696
00:38:05,939 --> 00:38:07,306
and you may have a point.

697
00:38:07,374 --> 00:38:08,974
I spend large segments of each day

698
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:10,342
picturing you choking on food.

699
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,777
And I recently contacted

700
00:38:11,845 --> 00:38:13,546
an exotic animal dealer because I had

701
00:38:13,613 --> 00:38:14,947
a very satisfying dream

702
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:17,516
that the two of us went to a zoo,
and I shoved your face

703
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:19,285
into one of those pink inflamed monkey butts

704
00:38:19,352 --> 00:38:20,686
that weeps lymph.

705
00:38:20,754 --> 00:38:23,622
And I know that you think I'm a bad person

706
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:27,026
because I remain unmoved by your
nattering of trite platitudes

707
00:38:27,093 --> 00:38:28,360
to your ill-shapen students

708
00:38:28,428 --> 00:38:30,362
about how the human
condition can be improved

709
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,531
by, yes, singing about it.

710
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:36,035
And I've proven that I can
wipe you and your Glee Club

711
00:38:36,102 --> 00:38:39,205
off the face of this earth.

712
00:38:39,272 --> 00:38:42,575
But what kind of a world
would that be, Will?

713
00:38:42,642 --> 00:38:44,877
A world where I couldn't
constantly ridicule your hair.

714
00:38:44,945 --> 00:38:48,080
World where I couldn't make
fun of you for tearing up

715
00:38:48,148 --> 00:38:50,316
more than Michael Landon
in a sweeps week's episode

716
00:38:50,383 --> 00:38:51,550
<i>of Little House on the Prairie.</i>

717
00:38:51,618 --> 00:38:53,452
And you know what, Will?

718
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,454
Sue Sylvester's not sure

719
00:38:55,522 --> 00:38:58,424
she wants to live in that kind of world.

720
00:38:58,491 --> 00:39:00,259
So I had a little talk with Figgins.

721
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:03,462
Glee Club gets another year.

722
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,164
I get what I want.

723
00:39:05,232 --> 00:39:06,298
Do you really not understand

724
00:39:06,366 --> 00:39:07,666
how this sexual blackmail thing works?

725
00:39:07,734 --> 00:39:09,301
Enough, Sue!

726
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:11,837
I will not be blackmailed by you anymore!

727
00:39:11,905 --> 00:39:14,473
I will tell my wife of our
heated sexual congress

728
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:16,308
before I will be bullied by you again!

729
00:39:16,376 --> 00:39:19,612
One last chit, Figgy.

730
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:22,715
Give the glee club another year,
and I won't mention us

731
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:24,383
making the beast with two backs again.

732
00:39:24,451 --> 00:39:25,818
Huh?

733
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:28,554
We have another year?

734
00:39:28,622 --> 00:39:29,855
You're a good teacher, Will.

735
00:39:29,923 --> 00:39:31,390
Now, I don't like you so much.

736
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:32,992
But I admire you

737
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:34,660
and the work you're doing with your kids.

738
00:39:34,728 --> 00:39:36,128
I really do.

739
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:40,599
<i>Bon chance, William.</i>

740
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:43,068
I relish the thought of another full year

741
00:39:43,136 --> 00:39:44,670
of constantly besting you.

742
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:50,242
You know, Sue, inside...

743
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,877
you're a really good person.

744
00:39:51,945 --> 00:39:52,878
You have a heart.

745
00:39:52,946 --> 00:39:54,780
Okay, let go of my hand.

746
00:39:54,848 --> 00:39:56,782
Hey...

747
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:00,352
I appreciate what you're
doing for these kids.

748
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,954
I won't forget it.

749
00:40:02,022 --> 00:40:04,890
And I'm seriously going
to puke in your mouth.

750
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,543
We've got another year.

751
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:26,445
What?

752
00:40:26,513 --> 00:40:29,315
Come on, we got another year!

753
00:40:30,383 --> 00:40:31,550
What?! Oh, my God!

754
00:40:34,587 --> 00:40:36,388
Yeah!

755
00:40:36,456 --> 00:40:37,923
Are you serious?!

756
00:40:39,726 --> 00:40:40,826
: Whoa!

757
00:40:44,397 --> 00:40:47,366
Okay, you guys, I think this is
the perfect opportunity for us

758
00:40:47,434 --> 00:40:49,201
to start rehearsing for
next year's Sectionals

759
00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:50,502
immediately...

760
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,704
Guys, you've all worked
really hard this year,

761
00:40:51,771 --> 00:40:53,172
and you deserve a break. But I have ideas.

762
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,340
Take the summer off.

763
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:55,908
Have some fun.

764
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:59,244
Oh, but before you go,
I have something for you.

765
00:41:00,413 --> 00:41:01,714
You all sang for me the other day,

766
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:04,383
so today I'd like to return the favor.

767
00:41:04,451 --> 00:41:05,684
Puck, if you're ready.

768
00:41:11,124 --> 00:41:13,092
¶¶  Ooh, ooh, ooh ¶¶

769
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:15,961
¶¶  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ¶¶

770
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:19,531
¶¶  Ooh, ooh, ooh ¶¶

771
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,000
¶¶  Somewhere ¶¶

772
00:41:22,068 --> 00:41:26,638
¶¶  Over the rainbow ¶¶

773
00:41:26,706 --> 00:41:30,442
¶¶  Way up high ¶¶

774
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:36,515
¶¶  There's a land that I dreamed of ¶¶

775
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:44,623
¶¶  Once in a lullaby... ¶¶

776
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:47,960
¶¶  Oh, somewhere ¶¶

777
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:52,698
¶¶  Over the rainbow ¶¶

778
00:41:52,766 --> 00:41:55,234
¶¶  Skies are blue ¶¶

779
00:41:57,337 --> 00:42:03,375
¶¶  And the dreams that you dare to dream ¶¶

780
00:42:03,443 --> 00:42:12,551
¶¶  Really do come true... ¶¶

781
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:15,587
All the adoption papers seem to be in order.

782
00:42:15,655 --> 00:42:19,158
But there's no name on the
birth certificate yet.

783
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:20,826
It's Beth.

784
00:42:20,894 --> 00:42:24,797
¶¶  Oh, someday I'll wish upon a star ¶¶

785
00:42:24,864 --> 00:42:27,800
¶¶  And wake up where the clouds are far ¶¶

786
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:32,905
¶¶  Behind me ¶¶

787
00:42:32,972 --> 00:42:36,175
¶¶  Where troubles melt like lemon drops ¶¶

788
00:42:36,242 --> 00:42:38,844
¶¶  High above the chimney tops ¶¶

789
00:42:38,912 --> 00:42:41,847
¶¶  That's where ¶¶

790
00:42:41,915 --> 00:42:44,082
¶¶  You'll find me ¶¶

791
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:48,153
¶¶  Oh, somewhere ¶¶

792
00:42:48,221 --> 00:42:52,191
¶¶  Over the rainbow ¶¶

793
00:42:52,258 --> 00:42:56,728
¶¶  Bluebirds fly ¶¶

794
00:42:56,796 --> 00:43:02,434
¶¶  Birds fly over the rainbow ¶¶
