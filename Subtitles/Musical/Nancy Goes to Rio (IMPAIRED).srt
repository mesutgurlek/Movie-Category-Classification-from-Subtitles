doffed my hat and took a bow.

Not a word to anyone yet.

ARTHUR:
Well, Ricardo...

168
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:58,264
Is anything wrong?

169
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:03,140
- Well, I thought she was much younger.
- Well, she was.

170
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:06,247
- On the stage, she looks superb.
- Granted.

171
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:10,613
But the part of Emily was intended
for an 18-year-old to play.

172
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:13,277
ARTHUR: Frances is a great actress.
- Oh, there you are.

173
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:16,687
Arthur, I hope you're nice and relaxed
because I need a skyscraper.

174
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:18,087
Oh. So you need a skyscraper?

175

- We haven't a thing up there in the way...
- Just a minute.

176

This is Miss Elliot's daughter,
Nancy Barklay.

- Glad to know you.

We have to have a skyscraper
for our second act.

179

I don't seem to have one on me.
You wouldn't settle for a small building?

180
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,940
You told me you had a storeroom
full of backdrops.

181

Oh, that kind of skyscraper.
Well, I think we can manage it.

182
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:40,008
- How you going to get it up?
- One of the boys has a truck.

When are you coming to Connecticut?

184

I'm afraid that's going to be impossible.

185
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:47,250
Impossible? But, Arthur, you promised.
You said you'd direct it.

186
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:49,857
I know I did,
but Mr. Domingos arrived in town and...

187
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,617
Oh, we were...

188
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:53,786

- Yes.

190
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,358
Oh, I am glad to know you.
Would you write a play for me?

191
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:02,367
Well, I've already written a play.

192
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:05,063
Oh, you have?
Will there be a part in it for me?

193
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:07,971
The only small part
is a 60-year-old governess.

194
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,338
I could look 60 years old.

195
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:12,140
- Everyone says I'm older than I really am.
- No, no, no.

196
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:16,080
No? Well, I think you're making
a big mistake.

197
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:19,244
After all, a young governess
is much more interesting.

198
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:23,324
Well, come to think of it, there is the part
of an invalid's offstage cough.

- Yes, I am.

in the country.

- Stock company?
- Mm. They do plays in barns.

- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

204
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,336
We do plays in barns.

205
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,806
There are kids and grownups
working their hearts out year after year...

206

...putting on plays all over the country.

207
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:47,015
They don't need big,
elaborate theaters and stars.

208
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,482
All they need is a room,
a curtain and a few chairs.

209
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:55,488
Maybe it's in a church
or in a clubhouse or in a barn...

210
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:57,956
...but they're satisfied.
And do you know why?

211
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:00,823
Because it's the theater and it's theirs.

212

You're wrong, Arthur.

213
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:09,766
They're not just people
putting on plays in barns...

...they're the future of the theater,
tomorrow's Oliviers and Bernhardts.

215

They're offering their time
and their talent and their dreams.

216
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,076
All they ask is that someone see them
and hear them and give them a chance.

217

But instead of helping them,
you're too busy being successful.

1063
01:02:47,178 --> 01:02:50,045
- Yes, Mother, I know.
- And you've always told me everything.

1064
01:02:50,215 --> 01:02:54,413
That's the basis for any honest relationship
between two people who love each other.

1065
01:02:54,586 --> 01:02:58,545
Yes, Mother. I know, only...

1066
01:02:58,723 --> 01:02:59,951
Only what?

1067
01:03:01,826 --> 01:03:03,293
Well...

1068
01:03:04,596 --> 01:03:08,430
There's some things
you can't tell anyone.

1069
01:03:09,401 --> 01:03:12,302
I'd do anything in the world
not to hurt you, Mother...

1070
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:18,170
...but sometimes things happen that,
well, you have no control over them.

1071
01:03:18,643 --> 01:03:20,838
Oh, aren't they cute?

1072
01:03:21,012 --> 01:03:23,207
- Oh, Nancy.
- I wonder why...?

1073
01:03:23,381 --> 01:03:26,612
Mother, is there anything wrong?
Maybe you'd better lie down.

1074
01:03:26,785 --> 01:03:29,015
No, no, I'm quite all right.

1075
01:03:30,121 --> 01:03:33,056
- Maybe it's just the heat.
- Yes, it's just the heat.

1076
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:35,024
No.

1077
01:03:35,193 --> 01:03:36,956
Let me do it.

1078
01:03:38,663 --> 01:03:40,221
Nancy...

1079
01:03:40,732 --> 01:03:44,099
...we're going to have a nice long talk
about what's bothering you.

1080
01:03:44,269 --> 01:03:46,100
I can't talk about it, Mother.

1081
01:03:46,271 --> 01:03:48,398
It's too late to do anything about it,
anyway.

1082
01:03:48,573 --> 01:03:51,440
Oh, my poor baby.

1083
01:03:54,446 --> 01:03:57,609
- This boy you were telling me about...
- He's not a boy, he's a man.

1084
01:03:57,782 --> 01:04:00,444
A man? Well, how old is he?

1085
01:04:00,618 --> 01:04:04,452
Oh, I guess he's about 40.

1086
01:04:04,622 --> 01:04:06,886
- Forty?
- Oh, but he's a young 40.

1087
01:04:07,058 --> 01:04:11,722
He's tall, good-looking, charming.
A sophisticated man of the world.

1088
01:04:11,896 --> 01:04:13,557
And you say he proposed to you?

1089
01:04:13,732 --> 01:04:19,068
Yes, but he wants to wait
until I'm a little bit older.

1090
01:04:19,938 --> 01:04:22,270
I think I'm gonna be ill.

1091
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,932
NANCY: Is there anything I can do?
- I think you've done quite enough.

1092
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,443
What's the name
of this man of the world?

1093
01:04:28,613 --> 01:04:32,071
Berten. Paul Berten.

1094
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:35,617
- He's the head of a big coffee firm.
- Berten.

1095
01:04:36,855 --> 01:04:40,791
I want you to lie down and rest
this afternoon. I'll send a tray of food up.

1096
01:04:42,861 --> 01:04:45,489
Is there anything special you'd like?

1097
01:04:46,164 --> 01:04:48,257
No, thank you, Mother.

1098
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,801
[PHONE RINGING]

1099
01:05:03,815 --> 01:05:06,682
PAUL:
All right, all right. I'm coming.

1100
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:09,416
Take it easy.

1101
01:05:10,555 --> 01:05:12,648
- Hello?
FRANCES: Mr. Paul Berten?

1102
01:05:12,824 --> 01:05:15,793
- Yes?
- This is Nancy's mother.

1103
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,225
- Whose mother?
- Nancy's. Nancy Barklay's.

1104
01:05:19,397 --> 01:05:21,058
You remember her, don't you?

1105
01:05:21,232 --> 01:05:24,827
Oh, that Nancy. How's she feeling?

1106
01:05:25,003 --> 01:05:27,403
Fine, no thanks to you.

1107
01:05:27,572 --> 01:05:30,040
I'm very fond of Nancy.

1108
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:32,672
He says he's very fond of Nancy.

1109
01:05:32,844 --> 01:05:35,540
- Look here, I'd better talk to him...
- No.

1110
01:05:35,713 --> 01:05:38,705
Mr. Berten, it's imperative
that I see you tonight.

1111
01:05:38,883 --> 01:05:42,011
Well, that's very nice,
but I have a sort of an engagement.

1112
01:05:42,187 --> 01:05:46,089
Well, if you'll forgive my saying so,
I think Nancy's welfare's more important.

1113
01:05:46,257 --> 01:05:49,124
I'm trying to be as calm
and as civilized about this as I can.

1114
01:05:49,294 --> 01:05:50,318
Naturally.

1115
01:05:50,495 --> 01:05:53,157
It would help if we could get together
and talk this over.

1116
01:05:53,331 --> 01:05:54,593
Well, hell, I...

1117
01:05:54,766 --> 01:05:56,996
I don't know very much
about these things.

1118
01:05:58,103 --> 01:06:01,231
- But if I can be of any help...
- Well, you certainly could.

1119
01:06:01,406 --> 01:06:03,931
Well, I have a table at the Samba Club.

1120
01:06:04,109 --> 01:06:08,569
How about meeting me there?
Say, 8:00?

1121
01:06:08,746 --> 01:06:10,270
- The Samba Club?
- Yeah.

1122
01:06:10,448 --> 01:06:12,746
Fine, I'll be there.

1123
01:06:13,485 --> 01:06:15,953
He sounded
as if he were doing me a favor.

1124
01:06:16,121 --> 01:06:19,215
- Don't you want me to go with you?
- I prefer to handle this alone.

1125
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:22,655
- You don't really know him.
- We'll all have years to get acquainted.

1126
01:06:22,827 --> 01:06:24,818
- At least he wants to marry her.
- Look here.

1127
01:06:24,996 --> 01:06:27,931
If he seems a decent sort,
if he isn't a criminal or insane...

1128
01:06:28,099 --> 01:06:29,862
...or something, it's all we can do.

1129
01:06:30,034 --> 01:06:32,195
- Look here...
- I'm putting in a call to Arthur.

1130
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:35,066
- What's he got to do with it?
- I can't leave Nancy now.

1131
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,640
Not when she needs me.
I'm not going to do the show.

1132
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:40,175
I wish I could get my hands
on this Berten fella.

1133
01:06:40,345 --> 01:06:44,076
Careful, Pappy.
You're talking about your future grandson.

1134
01:07:00,365 --> 01:07:03,960
George, I've got a problem.
A lady's joining me.

1135
01:07:04,135 --> 01:07:07,002
No. She's the mother of a friend of mine.

1136
01:07:07,172 --> 01:07:09,663
I've never met her,
but I want you to break it up...

1137
01:07:09,841 --> 01:07:12,036
...as soon as possible after she gets here.

1138
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:13,234
I understand.

1139
01:07:13,411 --> 01:07:16,676
- You leave everything to me, huh?
- Good boy.

1140
01:07:18,449 --> 01:07:23,580
- Good evening, madam. May I help you?
- I was to meet a Mr. Paul Berten here.

1141
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:27,649
- Madam?
- Mr. Berten's table.

1142
01:07:27,825 --> 01:07:29,793
Mr. Berten.

1143
01:07:30,361 --> 01:07:33,524
- Mr. Berten?
- Yes.

1144
01:07:34,866 --> 01:07:37,027
Right this way, please.

1145
01:07:47,045 --> 01:07:49,946
- Mr. Berten, your guest is here.
- Oh, yes. Excuse me.

1146
01:07:50,582 --> 01:07:51,981
How do you do? I'm...

1147
01:07:53,885 --> 01:07:56,649
Why, you... You're Frances Elliott.

1148
01:07:57,689 --> 01:07:58,986
- Yes.
- Well...

1149
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:02,851
- Won't you sit down, please?
- Madam.

1150
01:08:04,195 --> 01:08:06,060
This is a surprise.

1151
01:08:06,231 --> 01:08:07,892
I was expecting Nancy's mother.

1152
01:08:08,066 --> 01:08:10,534
In my spare time,
I'm also Nancy's mother.

1153
01:08:10,702 --> 01:08:13,830
- You? You're...?
- Yes.

1154
01:08:15,473 --> 01:08:19,204
- But I thought her name was Barklay.
- That was her father's name.

1155
01:08:19,377 --> 01:08:21,038
This is wonderful.

1156
01:08:21,212 --> 01:08:24,147
- May I order something for you?
- If you like.

1157
01:08:24,315 --> 01:08:27,011
- Two champagne cocktails, George.
- Two champagne cocktails.

1158
01:08:27,185 --> 01:08:29,380
And an occasion like this calls for caviar.

1159
01:08:29,554 --> 01:08:31,215
- Some caviar too.
- Some caviar.

1160
01:08:31,923 --> 01:08:34,323
I thought you said pea soup
and hamburger steak.

1161
01:08:34,492 --> 01:08:38,553
No. Caviar and a bottle of champagne.
You know my favorite brand, George.

1162
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:40,721
Very well, sir.

1163
01:08:43,701 --> 01:08:46,966
I can't tell you how anxious
I've been to meet you.

1164
01:08:47,138 --> 01:08:49,629
- I'm a great fan of yours, you know.
- Mr. Berten.

1165
01:08:49,807 --> 01:08:53,470
- I came here to discuss my daughter.
- If I'd known you were Nancy's mother...

1166
01:08:53,645 --> 01:08:55,840
...I'd have paid a lot more attention
to her.

1167
01:08:56,014 --> 01:08:57,174
Would you?

1168
01:08:57,348 --> 01:09:00,249
Nancy's just a child, you know.
She's only 17.

1169
01:09:00,418 --> 01:09:03,216
Seventeen? She told me she was 19.

1170
01:09:03,388 --> 01:09:05,481
And I suppose
that made everything all right?

1171
01:09:05,657 --> 01:09:07,488
Well, I shouldn't be too hard on her.

1172
01:09:07,659 --> 01:09:09,923
It's easy for a girl her age
to get carried away.

1173
01:09:10,094 --> 01:09:12,324
Are you implying
this is all Nancy's fault?

1174
01:09:12,497 --> 01:09:14,761
We should give her
the benefit of the doubt.

1175
01:09:14,932 --> 01:09:17,332
Well, that's very generous of you.

1176
01:09:19,437 --> 01:09:22,702
- Tell me, is this your first trip down here?
- Yes.

1177
01:09:22,874 --> 01:09:25,069
Good. You've got to let me show you Rio.

1178
01:09:25,243 --> 01:09:27,507
It's the most wonderful city
in the entire world.

1179
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,806
- We were discussing Nancy.
- Oh, yes.

1180
01:09:29,981 --> 01:09:33,348
Mr. Berten, I would like
to come right to the point.

1181
01:09:33,518 --> 01:09:37,079
Nancy's told me a little about you,
but I'd like to know a great deal more.

1182
01:09:37,255 --> 01:09:38,950
That's a wonderful idea.

1183
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:43,048
I would like to know something
about your background, your family.

1184
01:09:43,227 --> 01:09:47,288
Well, there isn't much to tell, really.
I have the usual number of parents.

1185
01:09:47,465 --> 01:09:51,765
Then I suppose you're well qualified
to take care of a wife and child?

1186
01:09:51,936 --> 01:09:55,167
To tell the truth,
I haven't given it much thought lately.

1187
01:09:56,374 --> 01:09:59,241
Well, don't you think
it's about time you did?

1188
01:10:00,978 --> 01:10:03,845
You know, I've never met anyone
quite like you.

1189
01:10:04,015 --> 01:10:05,880
You're so frank.

1190
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:09,315
Well, I see no reason why two people
can't be adult about things.

1191
01:10:09,487 --> 01:10:12,615
You're absolutely right.
I can't wait to show you around.

1192
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:15,782
There's a place called Little Paquet Island.
In the moonlight...

1193
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,326
The hospital just phoned.
They want you right away.

1194
01:10:18,496 --> 01:10:21,158
Your friend, Mr. Rogers,
has been in a terrible accident.

1195
01:10:21,332 --> 01:10:23,493
- He has a broken neck.
- Oh, how awful.

1196
01:10:23,668 --> 01:10:25,727
Tell him to forget it.

1197
01:10:25,903 --> 01:10:29,600
I mean, it's probably
not a very serious broken neck.

1198
01:10:30,308 --> 01:10:32,105
Thank you, George.

1199
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:35,345
FRANCES: Aren't you going to him?
- Believe me, it's nothing.

1200
01:10:35,513 --> 01:10:39,005
He's always breaking his neck.
Now, where were we?

1201
01:10:39,183 --> 01:10:40,741
We were discussing Nancy.

1202
01:10:40,918 --> 01:10:44,319
Oh, yes. You know that Nancy has
the most wonderful mother in the world?

1203
01:10:44,489 --> 01:10:45,513
Mr. Berten.

1204
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:48,591
I'll never stop being grateful to her
for bringing us together.

1205
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,729
- Do you know what you're saying?
- If it hadn't been for Nancy...

1206
01:10:51,896 --> 01:10:53,227
...we might never have met.

1207
01:10:53,398 --> 01:10:54,695
Let's drink a toast.

1208
01:10:54,866 --> 01:10:57,494
To the three of us,
happy times ahead.

Happy times ahe...? Well, I've never...
Really, I've never...

1210
01:11:01,606 --> 01:11:04,131
Mr. Berten, come quickly.
Your house is burning.

1211
01:11:04,308 --> 01:11:06,367
- Thank you, George.
- Hadn't you better go?

1212
01:11:06,544 --> 01:11:09,342
- It's a very small house.
- But it's burning big.

1213
01:11:09,514 --> 01:11:11,778
I'm sorry about all this.
Excuse me just a minute.

1214
01:11:11,949 --> 01:11:13,940
- The house was an inspiration, no?
- No.

1215
01:11:14,118 --> 01:11:15,142
- No?
- No.

1216
01:11:15,319 --> 01:11:17,150
Here. Maybe this will put out the fire.

1217
01:11:17,321 --> 01:11:19,289
Now, George, please,
no more interruptions.

1218
01:11:19,457 --> 01:11:22,790
- I wanna be alone.
- I think you have got your wish.

Father, what on earth are you doing?

1221
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:51,948
I was just getting in some practice
in case I run into that Berten fella.

1222
01:11:52,123 --> 01:11:55,183
- That will be all, Alfredo.
- If you pardon the expression, sir...

1223
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:59,455
- ... you are a sucker for a right cross.
- Oh, really? Well, I...

1224

Well, good night.
You'd better get to bed.

Thank you, sir. Good night, madam.

- Good night, Alfredo.
- Good night.

1227

- Aren't you being a little melodramatic?
- Well, I'm not taking any chances. I...

1228
01:12:11,642 --> 01:12:14,736
- Well, how'd it go?
- We didn't settle anything.

1229
01:12:14,912 --> 01:12:16,971
You were right,
you should've come with me.

1230

- What's this fella like?
- He's wonderful.

1231
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:21,648
- What?
- I mean, he's terrible.

1232
01:12:21,819 --> 01:12:24,014
Dangerously attractive and full of charm.

1233
01:12:24,188 --> 01:12:27,680
No wonder the child lost her head,
any woman could fall in love with him.

- You don't say?
- Yes. How is Nancy feeling?

1235
01:12:31,896 --> 01:12:35,332
Oh, under the circumstances,
she's feeling fine.

1236
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,967
It's very strange.

I never would've thought

Oh, Paul, are you all right?

- Yeah, fine.
- How could you?

1250
01:13:25,783 --> 01:13:27,944
- Who is that?
- My grandfather.

Should they be letting him
run around loose?

1252

You have no right to do this.
I'm not a child anymore.

- I'm a grown-up woman.

Say, tell me something, will you?

Is there any insanity in this family?

Up until last week,
I was a peaceful, happy citizen.

Then I met Nancy and I seem
to have become a punching bag.

Last week, on the boat.

- It's a very strange thing, but...
- Wait minute. Now, she...

- You never knew her before?
- Who?

- Nancy.
- Of course not.

- Well, now, I...

that she was going to have a...?

Well, she didn't exactly tell me.

01:15:00,678 --> 01:15:03,647
She was talking to herself
on the boat deck.

What did she say?

1280

running away...

That's why her mother wanted to see me.
No wonder she ran out on me.

There's another mystery I got to solve.

- But Nancy practically admitted it.

She admitted nothing of the kind.

01:33:21,277 --> 01:33:24,872
Why, I could be your father.

1503
01:33:25,048 --> 01:33:28,176
Oh, my father. You silly boy.

1504
01:33:28,351 --> 01:33:30,046
Nancy.

1505
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:31,585
Paul is right.

1506
01:33:31,755 --> 01:33:35,213
He doesn't want to hurt you, dear,
and you mustn't hurt yourself.

1507
01:33:35,391 --> 01:33:38,292
What you feel now
is something every girl goes through.

1508
01:33:38,461 --> 01:33:40,452
It's part of growing up.

1509
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:43,064
Why, when I was 15,
I was crazy about an acrobat.

1510
01:33:43,233 --> 01:33:45,497
When I was 16,
I wanted to marry a deep-sea diver.

1511
01:33:45,668 --> 01:33:48,762
And when you were 17,
you married father.

1512
01:33:48,938 --> 01:33:51,304
Yes, I know. But that was different.

1513
01:33:51,474 --> 01:33:54,841
Your father
was only two years older than I.

1514
01:33:55,011 --> 01:33:58,503
I know how you feel about Paul now,
darling, but it isn't really love.

1515
01:33:58,681 --> 01:34:02,708
That's still ahead of you.
And someday you'll laugh about all this.

1516
01:34:02,886 --> 01:34:05,821
But when you find your Paul,
someone your own age...

1517
01:34:05,989 --> 01:34:08,150
...you'll be the happiest girl in the world.

1518
01:34:08,324 --> 01:34:10,656
So that's it. You've taken him from me.

1519
01:34:10,827 --> 01:34:12,920
- Nancy.
- How could you?

1520
01:34:13,096 --> 01:34:16,998
The two people I love most
betraying me behind my back.

1521
01:34:17,167 --> 01:34:20,034
I offered you the heart of a woman...

1522
01:34:20,203 --> 01:34:23,832
...and you treated it like a plaything.

1523
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:29,478
You took a beautiful dream,
made of starlight and evening song...

1524
01:34:29,646 --> 01:34:32,171
...and turned it into a shabby, sordid...

1525
01:34:32,348 --> 01:34:34,543
- Escapade.
- Escapade.

1526
01:34:34,717 --> 01:34:36,480
Well, I won't hold you.

1527
01:34:36,653 --> 01:34:39,451
You're free to go, free to forget me.

1528
01:34:39,622 --> 01:34:43,922
All I ask is the warm,
merciful cloak of solitude.

1529
01:34:44,093 --> 01:34:47,221
I'm through with men
and all their hypocrisy.

1530
01:34:47,397 --> 01:34:50,924
This is farewell. Farewell to you both.

1531
01:34:52,836 --> 01:34:56,135
- Wasn't she wonderful?
- Wonderful? You'd better go after her.

1532
01:34:56,306 --> 01:34:59,173
Why, that's the big scene
from the third act.

1533
01:35:00,276 --> 01:35:04,372
Paul, she'd be wonderful as Emily.
I'll cable Barrett right away.

1534
01:35:13,823 --> 01:35:16,121
Miss Elliott... I mean, Mrs. Berten,
you're late.

1535
01:35:16,292 --> 01:35:18,385
Yes, I know. Come on, darling.

1536
01:35:18,561 --> 01:35:21,155
I'm sorry we're late,
but we had car trouble and we...

1537
01:35:21,331 --> 01:35:23,356
There's a show on, you know. The finale.

1538
01:35:23,533 --> 01:35:25,194
Yes, come on.

[SINGING]
Love is like this

01:35:42,385 --> 01:35:46,378
Strange as it seems

1541
01:35:46,556 --> 01:35:49,957
The moment you kiss

Your maker of dreams

1543
01:35:55,164 --> 01:35:59,931
A beautiful world of love will unfold

1544
01:36:00,103 --> 01:36:03,402
The moonlight of old will turn into gold

1545
01:36:03,573 --> 01:36:06,804
With one little kiss

1546
01:36:06,976 --> 01:36:09,968
For love is like this

1547
01:36:10,146 --> 01:36:13,673
You float away

1548
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:20,847
On the light of a magic lantern sky

1549
01:36:21,791 --> 01:36:23,952
A way

1550
01:36:24,127 --> 01:36:27,392
Where you certainly will

1551
01:36:27,563 --> 01:36:30,794
Reach the top of a thrill

1552
01:36:30,967 --> 01:36:37,964
On the wings of a sigh

1553

All of your schemes

Lost in the blue

1555
01:36:48,051 --> 01:36:51,316
Will turn into dreams

The kind that come true

1557
01:36:55,124 --> 01:36:59,993
And when you feel the glorious glow
In someone's hello

01:37:00,163 --> 01:37:05,430
Then your heart will know
The meaning of bliss
