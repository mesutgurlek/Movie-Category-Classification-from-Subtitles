more time with the lyrics!

801
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,797
You know what I need?

802
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:25,815
I need to stop
sleeping with men

803
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,885
who are complete
narcissistic pricks!

804
00:40:30,888 --> 00:40:33,673
Oh, and you're
not <i>that</i> good-looking!

805
00:40:33,724 --> 00:40:36,927
And you're
not that good in bed either!

806
00:40:40,765 --> 00:40:43,751
It's just a side effect
from the steroids.

807
00:40:47,021 --> 00:40:50,524
[Crying]

808
00:40:57,949 --> 00:41:00,083
[Exhales sharply]

809
00:41:00,117 --> 00:41:02,285
You all right?

810
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,371
Yeah, I will be.

811
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:10,961
[Both laughing]

812
00:41:16,384 --> 00:41:19,686
Well, that was quite a bit
of unscripted drama today.

813
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,137
I probably
shouldn't say anything,

814
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:22,556
but I rather enjoyed it.

815
00:41:22,607 --> 00:41:24,274
Ralph!
There you are!

816
00:41:24,308 --> 00:41:27,394
You found the Bushwhack!

817
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:28,979
This is Ellis and Zach.

818
00:41:29,013 --> 00:41:32,365
Ralph Masius, my favorite
Broadway producer.

819
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,618
- Hi.
- Hey.

820
00:41:34,652 --> 00:41:35,869
Hello.
Could we, uh, have four

821
00:41:35,903 --> 00:41:37,787
of your delicious Martinis,
please?

822
00:41:37,822 --> 00:41:39,406
Done.

823
00:41:39,457 --> 00:41:40,957
Best drink
in town, I swear.

824
00:41:40,992 --> 00:41:42,993
- I'm not fancy.
- I am.

825
00:41:43,027 --> 00:41:44,544
The Nederlanders
are coming.

826
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,546
David stone,
Jeffrey finn...

827
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:48,632
The list is incredibly
impressive.

828
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:50,133
- Show him the list, Ellis.
- No need.

829
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:52,752
- Put me on it.
- Put him on the list, Ellis.

830
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:54,754
Is that the reason
why we're celebrating?

831
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:56,923
Well, that and a couple
of other things.

832
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:59,566
I just landed a beautiful, luxury,

833
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:01,294
two-bedroom apartment...

834
00:42:01,295 --> 00:42:03,597
Top floor at a basement price.

835
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:05,432
- Awesome!
- What neighborhood?

836
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:07,100
The Lower East Side, boys.

837
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:10,654
I, um, have a nephew
who has a nice building.

838
00:42:10,688 --> 00:42:12,572
[Laughs]

839
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,190
Cheers, everybody!

840
00:42:14,224 --> 00:42:16,610
- Here's to change!
- I'm down with that.

841
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:19,446
- Mmm!
- Not bad.

842
00:42:19,497 --> 00:42:22,248
How's your
<i>big buck hunter,</i>Ralph?

843
00:42:22,283 --> 00:42:24,367
Buck what-er?
[Laughter]

844
00:42:24,401 --> 00:42:28,755
Come on, follow me.
I'm taking you all on.

845
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:31,875
Oh, we'd like
four more Martinis, please.

846
00:42:31,909 --> 00:42:34,995
Five...

847
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:37,964
One for you.

848
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:40,818
[Coins rattling]

849
00:42:42,053 --> 00:42:43,803
Watch out, now.

850
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:46,255
It's my turn.

851
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:50,419
