(Coughing)

3
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:21,768
Fire! Fire in the hole.

4
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:24,146
(Distant voice) Fire in the hole!

5
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,735
(Explosion)

6
00:01:30,162 --> 00:01:33,448
Let's get it, boys.
Always loads easy on payday.

7
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:37,869
(Steam train puffing)

8
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:13,238
(Klaxon)

9
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:21,246
Hi, Daddy. Look at your knee.
Why don't you wear your knee pad?

10
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:24,881
Loretty, that old shaft's so low,

11
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:27,843
you wear your knee pads,
you skin your back.

12
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:30,722
If you don't wear 'em,
you skin your knees.

13
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:34,015
I'll wear 'em tomorrow
and give my back a turn.

14
00:02:35,352 --> 00:02:38,437
Boys, there ain't no place
this thing can't take me.

15
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,099
There ain't a creek she can't ford
or a hill she can't climb.

16
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:46,279
I know a thing she can't climb.
That heap of red dog.

17
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:49,406
I can climb that
in a by-God New York minute.

18
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,027
- Shit!
- Hey!

19
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:54,695
You boys watch your language
in front of these kids.

20
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:01,953
All right, does anybody wanna bet me
I can't climb that mess there?

21
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:04,875
- (Man) That pile up there?
- Hell yes! I can...

22
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:07,593
Oh, I'm sorry, little girl. Excuse me.

23
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:09,841
(2nd man) It can't be done.

24
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:13,587
I got me $25 that says I can do it.
Does anybody wanna bet me?

25
00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:18,052
- (Murmuring)
- (Soldier) I'll take all of it.

26
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:20,725
Come on, kids. Let's get to the store.

27
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:23,809
(Both) Give the company
their money back.

28
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:27,478
Loretta, come on, honey.

29
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:30,733
(Men shouting out bets)

30
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:34,948
- Hi, Ted.
- Hey, Colin.

31
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:40,617
Who's that soldier boy
strutting around like a bantam rooster?

32
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:43,455
It's old man Red Lynn's boy. Doolittle.

33
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:47,632
Come back from the army
acting like a wild heathen.

34
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:51,838
He'll calm down a soon as they slap
a coal shovel in his hand.

35
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,630
- That Sears Roebuck order come in yet?
- I'll get it for you.

36
00:03:56,684 --> 00:03:59,554
- (Engine revs)
- (Doolittle) All right.

37
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:02,889
Loretty, get you and Herman
a jar of Viennas.

38
00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:18,283
(Crowd jeering)

39
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,000
(Miner) Get your mule, son.

40
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:27,129
Hey, Cousin Ted, come on in here
and get in on this bet, a sure thing.

41
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:30,707
Doolittle will never get up there
without rolling over.

42
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:49,150
(Engine straining)

43
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:56,152
(Gears grinding)

44
00:05:07,588 --> 00:05:10,589
(Crowd booing)

45
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:14,844
Lord, that son of a gun Doolittle
don't know what quit means.

46
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:19,845
He sure went to a lot of trouble
to get on top of a pile of junk.

47
00:05:19,892 --> 00:05:21,968
(Ted) Come on, Herman.

48
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:25,929
(Young boy) Mommy, Daddy's home!

49
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:28,104
(2nd boy) What's in that box?

50
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,148
(Ted) Something special.
Don't open it till we get inside.

51
00:05:33,906 --> 00:05:36,029
(Children shouting excitedly)

52
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:43,070
(Woman) Y'all get washed up
before you come in.

53
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:46,373
Y'all hear your Momma?
Everybody go wash now.

54
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,088
(Gun being cocked)

55
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:57,424
Lee Dollarhide.

56
00:05:58,597 --> 00:06:02,298
Come on in here, Doo.
I was just about to blast you one.

57
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:11,731
Old boy down at the store
said you wanted to see me.

58
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:13,935
Here, take you a sip.

59
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:18,280
OK, fellas.

60
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,445
- Donald Ray.
- Thanks, Daddy.

61
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,616
Jack. Hand that to brother Jack.

62
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:29,454
- Thank you.
- (Mother) Take the baby, Jack.

63
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:31,579
(Ted) How do they feel, gang?

64
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,872
Daddy, Peggy got two right feet.

65
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:36,130
- (Ted) What?
- Two right shoes.

66
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:39,711
(Ted) I'll be darned. Don't worry.
We'll get 'em changed.

67
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:42,433
- (Mother) How they feel?
- Loretta.

68
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:47,928
(Jack) Get your hands off.
Leave him alone, Donald Ray.

69
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,396
- (Baby crying)
- Daddy.

70
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:55,570
Hey, how come she gets
something extra?

71
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:59,231
Jack, Loretta's getting to be a woman.
Going on 14.

72
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:01,738
Women s'posed to have pretty things.

73
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:05,830
She ain't no woman.
She ain't nothing but a dadburned kid.

74
00:07:05,873 --> 00:07:07,949
What are you, Herman?

75
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:12,162
(Kids laughing, door slams)

76
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,009
Remember when
you used to work for me,

77
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:29,519
- sell my goods at the mines?
- You paid a nickel for every jug I sold.

78
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:33,892
- How'd you like to work for me again?
- Not for no nickel a jug!

79
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:38,477
I'm talking about real money, Doo.

80
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,398
Business is good. I'm selling
more whiskey than I can make.

81
00:07:42,451 --> 00:07:46,318
I heard you'd been stealing some
from the boys in Greasy Creek.

82
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:48,447
Just when I run shy of my own.

83
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:55,202
I'm fixing to make me another run
on Greasy Creek.

84
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:57,580
You got that Jeep.

85
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:00,717
You know how to use a gun
and you can use you a job.

86
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,760
I'll go fifty-fifty with you.

87
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,928
Doo, if you're born in the mountains,
you got three choices -

88
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,266
coal mine, moonshine

89
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:17,725
or moving on down the line.

90
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:33,661
- (Song turns to static)
- Get your feet off!

91
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,459
Turn the radio off.
We can't afford no new batteries.

92
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:44,217
You got one of
your bad headaches again, Daddy?

93
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:46,469
Do you want me to mix
up some medicine?

94
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:48,840
It don't do no good. It'll pass.

95
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:53,470
- What you see in them grounds?
- (Ted) Loretty, take the baby.

96
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:57,520
I see a woman crying.
Looks to me like a man crying, too.

97
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:59,644
- Who are they?
- (Mouthing)

98
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:03,776
Loretty.

99
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:08,699
- What are they crying about, Mommy?
- Take the baby out and rock her.

100
00:09:10,122 --> 00:09:12,031
Bad times is a-coming.

101
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:15,581
Well, we don't need no fortune-teller
to know that.

Good thing you wasn't working for him.
You'd be by his side.

114
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:27,573
I know that, Daddy.

115

been working somewhere.

118

(Woman) You're out.
That's all right, you did fine.

Get up and dance!

121
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:45,228
Preacher Banks was supposed
to be here to auction off these pies.

122
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:49,903
- He's sick and I...
- I can't take no time to auction no pies.

123
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:55,287
If these girls want to eat pies with a boy,
they'll do it if there's an auction or not.

124
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:58,861
I'll auction off them pies for you.

125
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:00,825
- You will?
- I sure will.

126
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:04,708
Six bits? Got six bits there.
Who's gonna bid a dollar?

127
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:06,996
- (Boy) I will!
- We got a dollar here.

128
00:12:07,048 --> 00:12:10,749
It's a dollar one time.
Boys, that's a dollar twice.

129
00:12:10,802 --> 00:12:13,340
That's sold right there for a dollar.

130
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,806
- Give me that dollar right there.
- Thank you.

131
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:28,526
All right, we got one pie left.
It's a chocolate pie belonging to...

132
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,479
Loretta Webb.

133
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:34,146
Who's gonna bid first?

134
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:37,285
- I bid two bits.
- Buddy, that's an insult!

135
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:41,623
Who's gonna start it off for a dollar?
Who'll give me a dollar, now?

136
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:47,254
I guess I get it, then.

137
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:51,710
- Heck, I'll bid a dollar, buddy.
- You ain't supposed to bid.

138
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,547
- A dollar once, a dollar twice...
- A dollar and a dime.

139
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:58,463
- Three dollars.
- That ain't fair, he's cheating!

140
00:12:58,517 --> 00:13:01,553
- Three dollars once, twice...
- Three and a dime.

141
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:05,553
- Three seventy-five.
- Three seventy... seven.

(Laughter)

143
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,480

sold to Mr. Doolittle for five dollars.

Play in the house

And when that pretty girl turns to me

147
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:31,210
Swing her high and swing her low

148
00:13:32,384 --> 00:13:34,460
Swing your partner, do-si-do

149

Takes that lamb

150

Takes that pretty girl
round the world...

151
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:56,698
- Make a lot of chocolate pies?
- Not too many, except this one.

152

(Coughs)

153
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,329
How much salt did that recipe call for?

154
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:11,291
You don't put no salt in chocolate pie.
Just sugar and...

155
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:15,131
You must have got 'em mixed up.

156
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:19,386
Makes sense, though.
Salt and sugar both white.

157
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:28,182
(Square dance caller continues)

158
00:14:31,943 --> 00:14:35,727
There ain't no sense in walking
when you can ride. Come on!

159
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,992
- I ain't gettin' in that.
- You ain't never rode in a car before?

160
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:43,653
That ain't no car.
It looks like something from Mars.

161
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:48,201
Mars? Gal, what the hell do you know
about Mars anyway?

162
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:52,878
I bet you ain't never been past
the mouth of this hollow.

163
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:57,798
- Come on, get in this thing.
- I said I ain't gettin' in it and I ain't!

164
00:14:57,844 --> 00:15:00,845
If you like me so much,
you can walk me home.

165
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:06,225
Oh, Lord, them pies ain't the only thing
salty about you.

166
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:08,392
Wait! We'll walk it, then.

167
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:10,514
(Machinery hums)

168
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:17,650
The first time I ever seen you I said
me and that gal's gonna get together.

169
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:21,446
I saw you, too. In that little soldier suit.

170
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:24,696
I thought you looked just like
a toy soldier.

171
00:15:24,746 --> 00:15:28,197
I went ashore on D-day plus four and
I stayed until the damn thing was over.

172
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:32,081
I wasn't no little old toy soldier.

173
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:36,872
You know what D-day is, don't you?

174
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:41,759
- What?
- Never mind.

175
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,935
Tell you one thing
that army showed me -

176
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:51,683
there's a whole big world out yonder.

177
00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:59,235
Showed me I ain't about to spend my life
buried in no coal mine, neither.

178
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,655
There ain't no damn future in it and
that's what I'm interested in - the future.

179
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:06,944
You got any plans for the future?

180
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:11,706
- Huh?
- Not that I know of.

181
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:15,375
- You sure cuss a lot.
- Yeah, I do.

182
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:17,794
Cuss, drink, chase wild women.

183
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,798
What? What are you doing?

184
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:24,255
I'm gonna kiss you good night.
Ain't you ever been kissed before?

185
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,273
Hey, Loretta?

186
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:45,277
I'm gonna bring my Jeep here
and take you for a ride.

187
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:47,449
You ain't gonna get that up here.

188
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:50,165
There ain't nothing I can't do, once I...

189
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:53,041
(Pigs squealing, dog barking)

190
00:16:55,754 --> 00:16:59,538
(Mother) Loretty, honey,
take Peggy Sue in and feed her.

191
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:06,295
(Car approaching)

192
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,973
Stranger coming! Stranger coming!

193
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:13,728
Stranger coming!

194
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:18,607
Stranger coming!

195
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:21,987
(Mother) What is it?

196
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:31,404
I told you I'd get this thing up here.
You gotta take a ride with me now.

197
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:48,053
(Toots horn)

198
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:12,820
- Hey, Bill.
- Hey, Doo.

199
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:17,203
(Truck and Jeep blast horns in turn)

200
00:18:28,513 --> 00:18:30,387
(Tyres squealing)

201
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:53,411
I can't breathe. I feel like I'm gonna faint.

202
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:56,455
- That's because you're in love.
- It is?

203
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:58,373
Yep.

204
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:06,131
(Dog barking outside)

205
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:12,466
(Jeep screeches to halt outside)

206
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,550
(Jeep engine revs)

207
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:22,641
Where have you been?

208
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:27,279
- Doolittle took me riding.
- What?

209
00:19:27,322 --> 00:19:30,691
- Doolittle took me riding.
- Took you riding?

210
00:19:30,742 --> 00:19:34,360
You just run off.
Didn't ask nobody or nothing.

211
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:37,413
Run off and worry everybody to death.

212
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:50,752
Y'all get to bed. Go on.

213
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:12,950
He'd rather cut off his arm
than have to whip you like that.

214
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:16,952
What you want
running off with that wild boy?

215
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:19,072
I love him, Mommy.

216
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,574
You do no such a thing.

217
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:27,621
Stay away from Doolittle or I'll give you
worse than what your Daddy did.

218
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:30,839
Get some salve for your legs.

219
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:15,386
Loretty, you know
I don't like to boss you

220
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,303
but I got to now, honey.

221
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:19,970
- Daddy...
- Just let me talk.

222
00:21:20,018 --> 00:21:23,268
Doolittle's been up the house
every day this week.

223
00:21:23,313 --> 00:21:25,804
- I don't want him hanging around.
- Why?

224
00:21:25,857 --> 00:21:29,689
Cos you ain't got no business
hanging around with him.

225
00:21:29,736 --> 00:21:32,939
You're just a little girl,
he's a grown-up man,

226
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:35,658
wild as the devil.

227
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,989
I love him, Daddy.

228
00:21:38,036 --> 00:21:40,953
And he's a-wanting me to marry him.

229
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,078
You ain't even 14 yet.

230
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,498
- Y'all ain't knowed each other a month.
- I know.

231
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:53,625
But I love him.

232
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:57,010
Lord, Lord, don't do it, Loretty.

233
00:21:58,097 --> 00:22:01,513
Don't throw all them young years away.

234
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,928
You're my pride, girl. My shining pride.

235
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:10,517
I just can't help it.

236
00:22:11,611 --> 00:22:14,184
I can't.

237
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:21,952

240
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:37,968
Get up, Mommy. Do your squaw dance.

241
00:22:38,012 --> 00:22:41,428
See if we can't get a smile
out of old sourpuss here.

242
00:22:41,474 --> 00:22:45,139
- Yeah, come on, Momma.
- Come on, Clary.

My gosh, Doo.

262

- Where'd you get all that?
- Paychecks. I've been saving.

263
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:25,861
You know what tomorrow is?
It's our anniversary.

264
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:28,663
Get a little closer.

Herman, I'm gonna kill you!

- What were you saying, Doo?
- Tomorrow is our anniversary.

267
00:24:39,008 --> 00:24:42,294
I figured it'd be a good day
for us to get married,

268
00:24:42,345 --> 00:24:45,014
especially since I got all that money.

Go ask Daddy.

271

Mr. Webb, me and Loretta is fixing
to get married if it's all right with you.

272
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:13,871
Tomorrow.

273
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,003
Go ask Clary.

274
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:40,310
Mrs. Webb, erm, me...

275
00:25:41,988 --> 00:25:45,487
me and Loretty was thinking about
getting married...

276

277
00:25:50,496 --> 00:25:52,572
Go ask Ted.

278
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:07,504
(Herman) Where's lover boy?

279
00:26:09,682 --> 00:26:11,758
Doolittle, what are you doing?

280
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,474
Ted said to ask Clary
and Clary said to ask Ted and...

281
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:18,392
- I don't know.
- Come on and sit down.

282
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:23,984
Wait'll they go to bed,
then you can catch them together

283
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,402
else they'll run you about all night.

284
00:26:28,117 --> 00:26:29,991
Mr. and Mrs. Webb?

285
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:37,618
I know everything's happened real fast.

286
00:26:37,668 --> 00:26:41,203
I know she's young,
I know how much y'all love her

287
00:26:41,255 --> 00:26:44,339
but the deal is...

288
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:46,755
I love her too.

289
00:26:46,802 --> 00:26:48,878
Just as much as you do.

290
00:26:50,514 --> 00:26:54,215
I growed up real fast,
I seen a lot of the world.

291
00:26:54,268 --> 00:26:59,808
First time I seen that girl I said
that's all I'm ever gonna want out of life.

292
00:26:59,857 --> 00:27:01,600
And I promise you

293
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:06,821
I'm gonna break my back
working to make her happy.

294
00:27:07,907 --> 00:27:11,323
I reckon y'all set on it
no matter what we say.

295
00:27:12,578 --> 00:27:16,790
I don't wanna go against y'all
but yes'm, we're set on it.

296
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:23,539
Two things I want you
to promise me, boy.

297
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:25,665
Don't you never hit her

298
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:30,252
and don't take her off
far away from home.

299
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:32,048
Yes, sir.

300
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:34,174
I promise you that.

301
00:28:02,878 --> 00:28:04,954
Wilt thou love her, comfort her,

302
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:07,710
honour and keep her
in sickness and in health

303
00:28:07,758 --> 00:28:11,803
and keep thee only unto her
so long as you both shall live?

304
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:13,388
I will.

305
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:16,634
Loretta, wilt thou have this man
to be thy wedded husband,

306
00:28:16,684 --> 00:28:19,471
to live together
in the holy estate of matrimony?

307
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,513
Wilt thy love him, comfort him,

308
00:28:21,564 --> 00:28:24,600
honour and keep him
in sickness and in health

309
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,185
and keep thee only unto him
so long as you both shall live?

310
00:28:28,237 --> 00:28:30,194
Mm-hm, yeah, I will.

311
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:33,573
Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?

312
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,158
I do.

313
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:40,281
Please join right hands.

314
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:47,921
The wedding ring is a visible sign
of an inward and spiritual grace

315
00:28:47,965 --> 00:28:52,793
signifying the uniting of
this man and woman in holy matrimony.

316
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:55,217
Do you two have rings?

317
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:57,257
I ain't got no ring, Judge.

318
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:17,159
She'll warm up here in just a minute.

319
00:29:17,203 --> 00:29:19,528
I got a present for you from Momma.

320
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:23,947
(Doo unzips trousers and urinates)

321
00:29:30,508 --> 00:29:32,381
(Toilet flushes)

322
00:29:49,944 --> 00:29:52,861
Go on and get ready for bed,
baby, come on.

323
00:30:17,721 --> 00:30:19,963
(Lorries passing outside)

324
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:30,809
You don't wear a nightgown
over your clothes.

325
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,267
I'm freezing, Doo.

326
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,481
(Laughs) Get on in there and take off
everything but your nightgown.

327
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:40,776
Go on, Loretty.

328
00:30:40,828 --> 00:30:42,655
Go on!

329
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:44,781
Go. Go on, now.

330
00:31:31,253 --> 00:31:33,542
(Loretta) Don't do that. Don't!

331
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:37,669
- Doo, no!
- It's just a little rough the first time.

332
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:41,467
- Don't worry. Come on, baby.
- (Loretta crying out)

333
00:31:41,513 --> 00:31:44,265
Hush, Loretty.

334
00:31:44,308 --> 00:31:47,807
(Gasping and sobbing) No! No.

335
00:32:18,842 --> 00:32:20,586
This stuff's cold.

336
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,679
It froze between here and the restaurant.

337
00:32:24,723 --> 00:32:26,965
You want a hot breakfast, go with me.

338
00:32:27,017 --> 00:32:32,806
I ain't having all them people looking
at me knowing what we've been doing.

339
00:32:32,856 --> 00:32:37,933
Do you think this is something the rest
of the world ain't caught on to yet?

340
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,444
- It's a little rough the first time.
- Didn't seem too rough on you.

341
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:46,818
Get used to it cos a marriage...

342
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:51,331
I ain't gonna get used to you
getting on me and sweating like a pig!

343
00:32:55,212 --> 00:32:59,210
You told Daddy you wouldn't hit me
and look at you already.

344
00:32:59,258 --> 00:33:01,963
I'm sorry, Loretta, but you drove me to it!

345
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,848
(Train horn)

346
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,316
(Dog barking)

347
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:35,785
Hi, hon.

348
00:33:42,968 --> 00:33:46,717
Look here at this.
These radios are on sale real cheap.

349
00:33:46,764 --> 00:33:50,014
- You reckon we could get us one?
- (Doo groans)

350
00:33:56,815 --> 00:34:00,730
Here, you read that.
Then we'll talk radios.

351
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,115
My gosh, Doo, this has got pictures in it.

352
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:13,989
(Muttering)

353
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:21,710
- (Whistles) Here, dog.
- (Dog barking)

354
00:34:33,352 --> 00:34:36,851
Oh, Loretty, that there book...

355
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:42,860
That thing's helped
millions of people the world over.

356
00:34:42,903 --> 00:34:45,476
I thought it might do us a little good.

357
00:34:45,531 --> 00:34:48,781
I can't read this.
It's got big old words in it.

358
00:34:49,827 --> 00:34:52,318
Look at this one. Look.

359
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:55,288
That dadgum word is a foot long.

360
00:34:55,332 --> 00:34:58,701
What's a foot-long word
supposed to mean?

361
00:35:01,255 --> 00:35:03,331
(Doo groaning)

362
00:35:06,593 --> 00:35:09,511
I don't need no book
to tell me what's wrong.

363
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:14,430
You just need to be more patient
and gentle with me, honey, that's all.

364
00:35:15,686 --> 00:35:17,974
I just need a little more time.

365
00:35:19,148 --> 00:35:21,473
Give you a little more time.

366
00:35:21,525 --> 00:35:25,190
Let me add up all these things
I have to give you more time on.

367
00:35:25,237 --> 00:35:28,487
You need a little more time
to learn how to cook.

368
00:35:28,532 --> 00:35:32,861
You need a little more time
to learn how to clean the damn house.

369
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:36,411
Plus you need more time
to learn how to love your man.

370
00:35:36,456 --> 00:35:39,790
Is there anything
you know how to do right now?

371
00:35:42,254 --> 00:35:45,837
- When you gonna get me that ring?
- (Doo groans)

372
00:35:45,883 --> 00:35:50,212
Stop making that noise.
You sound like an old bear growling.

373
00:35:51,638 --> 00:35:55,090
Where are you going?
Doo, are you leaving?

374
00:36:02,274 --> 00:36:05,441
No, I ain't leaving.

375
00:36:08,488 --> 00:36:11,940
(Peggy Sue)
Mommy, look who's here! Loretta!

376
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,028
(Loretta) Hi. Hi, Peggy.

377
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,950
- Hi.
- Look who's here, Dad!

378
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:21,075
Look who's here, Dad!

379
00:36:22,169 --> 00:36:25,123
Hi, Mommy. Doo's throwed me out.

380
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:29,964
Thank the Lord. Maybe it ain't too late
to save you from ruining your life.

381
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,466
- Loretty, you home!
- Hi, Daddy.

382
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:36,682
I believe married life's making you fat.

383
00:36:38,477 --> 00:36:40,434
Oh, no.

384
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:43,480
(Girl) F, O, D...

385
00:36:43,523 --> 00:36:45,397
Ready, Loretta?

386
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:51,896
The last time I seen you
was for a shot for the measles.

387
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:54,819
Now you're married.
How do you like it?

388
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:56,612
Fine.

389
00:36:59,122 --> 00:37:02,076
Except me and Doo is separated.

390
00:37:03,168 --> 00:37:07,118
Things happen pretty fast
between you and Doo, don't they?

391
00:37:25,732 --> 00:37:28,402
(Toots horn)

392
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,980
Hey!

393
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:35,865
(Doo) Hold up there.

394
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:38,531
(Woman) Hey, Doolittle, how are you?

395
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:41,532
- Good day, isn't it?
- It sure is.

396
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:45,330
- (Woman) What have you been doing?
- Working too damn hard.

397
00:37:45,377 --> 00:37:48,212
- What about you?
- Hey, Doolittle Lynn.

398
00:37:49,298 --> 00:37:51,789
Who's that sow wallowing in your Jeep?

399
00:37:51,842 --> 00:37:55,709
- What did you call me?
- A sow. That's a woman pig.

400
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:06,346
Hi, Loretta, I just...

401
00:38:06,398 --> 00:38:08,474
Hey, Loretta!

402
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:18,527
- I was fixing to come see you.
- Was you gonna bring your girlfriend?

403
00:38:18,577 --> 00:38:21,946
She don't mean nothing.
I got something to tell you.

404
00:38:21,997 --> 00:38:24,203
I got something to tell you too.

405
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:28,331
Loretta, I am leaving Kentucky.

406
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:32,791
I'm going to Washington
to get me a job on a ranch.

407
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:35,759
That damned coal mine's
got me buried alive.

408
00:38:35,802 --> 00:38:39,847
- Was you just gonna leave me?
- Just till I get the money to send for you.

409
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:43,259
- What makes you think I'd come?
- You're my wife.

410
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:47,142
I'm your wife! You better think
of a better reason than that.

411
00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:50,973
There ain't nothing for me
in Kentucky, Loretta.

412
00:38:51,026 --> 00:38:54,644
Except a chest full of coal dust
and being an old man time I'm 40.

413
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:58,154
You ask your daddy.

414
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,651
'Sides that, you got to come with me,
I love you.

415
00:39:02,704 --> 00:39:05,789
You promised Daddy
you wouldn't take me off far.

416
00:39:05,832 --> 00:39:10,790
You just have to decide
whether you're his daughter or my wife.

417
00:39:14,341 --> 00:39:17,425
Get in. I'll take you back to the house.

418
00:39:19,388 --> 00:39:21,629
What are you doing in the bottom?

419
00:39:21,681 --> 00:39:24,089
I come to see Doc Turner.

420
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:26,051
You sick?

421
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:28,475
Yeah, I'm gonna have a baby.

422
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:33,601
(Chuckles) Oh, Lord, Loretta.

423
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:39,321
Darlin', you might have found something
that you know how to do.

424
00:39:39,366 --> 00:39:42,035
Stop! Don't go so fast!

425
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:52,244
(Chatting, indistinct)

426
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:08,389
It's from Doo! He sent me the money
to come to Washington.

427
00:40:21,908 --> 00:40:26,617
She's late. Reckon she might have
jumped the tracks.

428
00:40:26,663 --> 00:40:29,747
Oh, Daddy, them things don't do that.

429
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:34,666
- Do they?
- They've been known to.

430
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:39,045
Get up here. Let's see what you weigh.

431
00:40:46,224 --> 00:40:49,142
117!

432
00:40:49,186 --> 00:40:52,186
Boy, this baby's gonna be a big one.

433
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,433
- You weigh now.
- It wouldn't do no good.

434
00:40:55,484 --> 00:40:59,944
I wouldn't know how much was me
and how much was all that coal dust.

435
00:40:59,988 --> 00:41:02,064
(Train whistle)

436
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:11,245
I ain't never gonna see you again.

437
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:14,410
Yes, you will, Daddy.

438
00:41:15,504 --> 00:41:19,418
Maybe. But I ain't never gonna see
my little girl again.

439
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:24,625

00:43:19,878 --> 00:43:22,665
And then I come home.

462
00:43:22,714 --> 00:43:24,457
Eat, boy.

463
00:43:24,507 --> 00:43:28,671
Betty Sue, you are not leaving this table
till you finish that.

464
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,255
- Sit up. Come here.
- Then I come home and cooked supper.

465
00:43:32,307 --> 00:43:35,391
- And I'm about ready to die.
- (Kids chattering)

466
00:43:35,435 --> 00:43:38,471
- How was your day?
- Wet.

467
00:43:42,942 --> 00:43:45,398
- Hey, Mooney!
- Yo!

468
00:43:45,445 --> 00:43:49,110
Your momma called long distance
from Kentucky today,

469
00:43:49,157 --> 00:43:53,653
said happy anniversary
and why don't you call her more often.

470
00:43:53,703 --> 00:43:55,826
Much obliged.

471
00:43:55,872 --> 00:43:59,407
Why don't you have a phone put in
sometime, Mooney?

472
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:01,748
We don't like telephones.

484

(Whispering) I was thinking,
we got an anniversary coming up,

485
00:44:53,596 --> 00:44:56,847
I was wondering
what kind of present you wanted.

486
00:45:00,103 --> 00:45:02,428
I ain't got no wedding ring yet.

487
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,639
Wedding ring?

488
00:45:04,691 --> 00:45:06,648
Bullshit.

489
00:45:06,693 --> 00:45:10,987
- Oh, bullshit!
- Doo! Jack Benny!

490
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,818
Now, go to sleep. You too, Jack Benny.

491
00:45:25,462 --> 00:45:27,917
(Sighs)

492
00:45:34,304 --> 00:45:36,380
Happy anniversary, darlin'.

493
00:45:38,308 --> 00:45:40,550
It looks like you had a happy one.

494
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,518
You know, most couples spend
their anniversary together.

495
00:45:46,566 --> 00:45:49,318
- (Strums guitar with foot)
- What's that?

496
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,776
Your anniversary present.
Happy anniversary.

497
00:45:52,822 --> 00:45:55,396
My anniversary present?

498
00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:00,076
Sometimes I think you got a washer
missing in your brain. I can't play that.

499
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:03,870
Most people can't
without they learn how first.

500
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:06,918
You're not too ignorant to learn,
are you?

501
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:10,046
If you don't want it, I'll give it to the kids

502
00:46:10,089 --> 00:46:13,090
or I'll put it in the kindling box.

503
00:46:13,134 --> 00:46:15,210
Give me that.

504
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:28,524
- What you get me a guitar for?
- Cos I like the way you sing.

505
00:46:32,737 --> 00:46:35,062
You really think I sing good?

506
00:46:35,114 --> 00:46:37,191
Baby, I know you do.

507
00:46:39,536 --> 00:46:41,493

go honky-tonkin'?

523
00:48:00,575 --> 00:48:03,113
- You mean together?
- Yeah, together.

524
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:04,620
OK.

525

plus one Coca-Cola.

531
00:48:46,663 --> 00:48:50,826
- How about a dance, darling?
- I can't. I'm married.

532
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:54,209
Must not be too married,
you ain't wearing no ring.

533
00:48:56,464 --> 00:49:00,877
- I bet I know what this is all about.
- Oh, dang, you guessed it.

534
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,465
Wait right here, I'll be right back.

535
00:49:13,106 --> 00:49:16,023
I got something sitting
right on back there...

536
00:49:21,155 --> 00:49:25,070
Come here, darling.
Come here, honey.

537
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:31,823
I'll be right with you.

538
00:49:40,675 --> 00:49:42,751
Loretta!

539
00:49:44,178 --> 00:49:47,013
What the hell are you doing running off?

540
00:49:47,056 --> 00:49:50,508
Don't make me get up and sing.
Please, I'm sick.

541
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,142
- Oh, hell, the old boy wouldn't allow it.
- Thank the Lord.

542
00:49:54,188 --> 00:49:58,482
- You have to audition tomorrow.
- I can't sing for no strangers.

543
00:49:58,526 --> 00:50:01,977
- Yes. I fixed it up already.
- You didn't ask me!

544
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:05,944
How can I ask you if you're hiding
like a stupid hillbilly?

545
00:50:05,992 --> 00:50:09,824
Don't call me that.
I may be ignorant but I ain't stupid.

546
00:50:09,871 --> 00:50:14,782
- Why do you want me to sing anyway?
- I'm proud of you when you sing.

547
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:21,123
I'm glad I make you proud, honey,
but I can't sing in front of people.

548
00:50:21,174 --> 00:50:24,009
- I just can't.
- Yes, you can, baby.

549
00:50:24,052 --> 00:50:27,717
You gonna sing for these old boys
in here in the morning

550
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:31,382
and next week you're gonna be
on that stage singing

551
00:50:31,434 --> 00:50:36,428

hillbilly ass every step of the way!

Your Momma's a dadgum songwriter.

(Doo) You can sing in every honky tonk
in the country -

596
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:27,741
there's thousands doing it
and they ain't getting nowhere.

597
00:54:27,795 --> 00:54:29,254
You need a record.

598
00:54:29,297 --> 00:54:34,124
The next step's even more important
and that's getting people to play it

599
00:54:34,176 --> 00:54:37,628
but right now
what you and me have to worry about

600
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,591
is you making the best doggone record
you can, it all depends on that.

601
00:54:43,602 --> 00:54:46,556
You know so much
about the music business.

602
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:50,306
I don't.
I'm just figuring it out as I go along.

603
00:54:51,527 --> 00:54:53,603
It's just got three chords.

Honey, what are you gonna sing for us?

605
00:55:01,871 --> 00:55:05,915
She's gonna do a song she wrote herself
called Honky Tonk Girl.

606
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:08,414
Right. Honey, what key's it in?

607
00:55:08,461 --> 00:55:12,161
Y'all just play, she'll follow you just fine.

608
00:55:13,299 --> 00:55:16,300
- Go ahead and y'all just play.
- She does talk?

609
00:55:16,344 --> 00:55:19,179
Generally people
that can sing can talk.

610
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:22,139
She'll talk up a storm
if she feels like it.

611
00:55:22,183 --> 00:55:26,097
Y'all settle down, now.
Come over here and sit on my knee.

612
00:55:27,063 --> 00:55:31,440
You'll have a lot better view.

let's go for it. Take one.

614
00:55:35,196 --> 00:55:36,987
Three, four, one.

615
00:55:44,705 --> 00:55:47,790

616
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,625
(Engineer chuckling)

617
00:55:49,668 --> 00:55:53,120
That's all right, don't worry.
We got a lot of tape.

618
00:55:53,172 --> 00:55:56,043
All right, y'all get ready for take two.

619
00:55:56,092 --> 00:55:58,665
- Could you give us a minute?
- Sure.

620
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,795
Kids, come with me.

621
00:56:01,472 --> 00:56:03,928
I guess we're leaving now, so...

622
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:06,133
Put that thing back on.

623
00:56:06,185 --> 00:56:08,261
What are you doing in here?

624
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,852
Doo, what are you doing?

625
00:56:11,899 --> 00:56:14,853
Darling, I want you to sing to
these babies.

626
00:56:14,902 --> 00:56:17,737
- Sing to the babies?
- Just like at home.

627
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,856
Y'all sit in that green chair.

628
00:56:21,575 --> 00:56:23,782
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

629
00:56:26,122 --> 00:56:30,119
- Three, four, one.

Just hang on a minute.

633
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:54,977
Let's take a break and see if
I can find a few more pickers.

634
00:56:55,025 --> 00:56:57,184
I can't afford no more pickers.

635

Let's do this thing, darlin',
we ain't got all day.

641
00:57:31,353 --> 00:57:34,189
I ain't got all these doodads
sewed on yet.

642
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:36,603
I got to get to work. Come on, now.

643
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:39,651
It's just gonna be
your head and shoulders.

644

Get in front of the backdrop.

- That bedspread?
- Yeah.

646
00:57:43,824 --> 00:57:46,232
Wait! I have to put on some lipstick.

647
00:57:46,285 --> 00:57:49,286
I like you better natural.
Forget the lipstick.

648
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:52,746
- This zip's all rotten.
- Sit down there.

- On the back of the chair.

Oh, that's gonna be purty.

651
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:09,176
I don't want you ever wearing
no make-up or none of that junk.

652
00:58:09,225 --> 00:58:11,098
It ain't right.

653
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:14,594
- Here we go.
- Where should I look?

654
00:58:14,647 --> 00:58:16,723
Look at heaven, baby.

655
00:58:16,774 --> 00:58:20,772
Get out of there. I'm trying to take
your momma's picture.

656
00:58:22,196 --> 00:58:24,105
Thank you, baby.

Aw, beautiful.
That's just beautiful. That's it.

659

Put the backdrop back on the bed.

660
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:36,831
Are you and Daddy going out again?

661
00:58:36,877 --> 00:58:39,249
Yes, I've got to sing over in Lynden.

662
00:58:39,296 --> 00:58:43,460
- Can I go with you?
- Oh, no, that's a rough old honky tonk.

665
00:59:18,377 --> 00:59:20,583
I'll get me a nap later on.

666
00:59:20,629 --> 00:59:24,294
- Let me fix you some breakfast.
- I'll get a bite later.

667
00:59:24,341 --> 00:59:27,591
Be ready when I get home.
We gotta drive to Spokane.

leaving here.

Anyhow, it's over and done now,
I reckon.

691

No, it ain't, Doc,

we sent records and pictures to

708

are in this part of the country.

709

If we're really gonna do this thing,

710
01:03:47,604 --> 01:03:51,436
we gotta go see 'em
and make sure they play that record.

711

I talked to your momma
and she said she'd watch the kids for us.

We gotta move right now,
you understand?

you do nothing you don't wanna do.

- What?

Hi, Bobby. My name's Loretta Lynn

751
01:06:32,602 --> 01:06:37,514
and I sent you a picture
and my newest record on the Zero label.

No kidding, you can't be in here.

called Honky Tonk Girl.

Tell them all about it, Hutch.

You played it? You ain't even took it
out of the wrapper.

I don't have time to play all of them.

Why did you lie to us?

Trying to sober up to do his show.

918
01:17:08,905 --> 01:17:10,981
Turn the radio up, will you?

919
01:17:11,032 --> 01:17:14,199
Listen, I'm trying to hear the radio.
Turn it up!

He's got a wife on the Opry.

Oh, is that right?
Hell, you got it made, man!

All you gotta do is count it

Mad?

978
01:21:25,328 --> 01:21:27,404
Sit down.

979
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:35,662
I'm scared because people might think
you sing it better than I do.

about my life. I made this for you.

- Darlin', thank you, I love it.
- You look tired, you OK?

(Man) She cut it. Let's get on the bus.

That sounds like your momma.

Come on.

1238

Hop in that Jeep,
let's say hello to Momma. There she is!

1239
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:39,096
Get in there, baby.

1240
01:40:45,987 --> 01:40:48,560
- Howdy, Jim.
- Hi, Mooney.

1241
01:40:48,615 --> 01:40:51,948
- How you doing, baby?
- I'm fine.

1242

Come here, twin, and give me a hug.

My name ain't Twin!

1244
01:40:57,582 --> 01:41:00,916
Get out of that Jeep
and say hello to your momma.

1245
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,665
When am I gonna be able
tell y'all apart?

1246
01:41:03,713 --> 01:41:07,414
- Probably never.
- Mind your manners around here.

1247
01:41:07,467 --> 01:41:11,167
Get on over there and help unload
your momma's stuff.

1248
01:41:14,682 --> 01:41:17,553
My Lord, Doo, what happened?

1249
01:41:17,602 --> 01:41:21,185
Jack Benny done that.
Him and Ernest Ray had a race.

1250
01:41:21,231 --> 01:41:24,765
- Did they get hurt?
- No, they've gone to get another one.

1251
01:41:25,985 --> 01:41:30,612
- Did you do something to your hair?
- Yeah, this fan cut it for me.

1252
01:41:32,033 --> 01:41:34,109
Looks real good.

1253
01:41:37,622 --> 01:41:39,615
- Doo?
- Huh?

1254
01:41:39,666 --> 01:41:43,200
I'm gonna ask you
to do something for me, honey.

1255
01:41:46,673 --> 01:41:50,207
I've been having
them bad headaches again.

1256
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:53,794
The doctor gave you them pills,
you taking them?

1257
01:41:55,515 --> 01:41:59,465
I'm taking them
but they ain't doing no good.

1258
01:42:00,812 --> 01:42:02,970
Nothing does.

1259
01:42:03,022 --> 01:42:04,932
Maybe you ought to slow down.

1260
01:42:06,025 --> 01:42:08,563
If you slow down,
they forget about you.

1261
01:42:10,488 --> 01:42:14,438
When I go back on the road
I want you to go with me.

1262
01:42:14,492 --> 01:42:16,983
I'm getting run to death out there.

1263
01:42:17,912 --> 01:42:21,613
I need somebody to take care of me
a little bit.

1264
01:42:21,666 --> 01:42:25,533
You got people fighting each other
to care of you.

1265
01:42:27,922 --> 01:42:29,796
I need you, Doo.

1266
01:42:30,884 --> 01:42:33,553
I need somebody that cares about me.

1267
01:42:34,637 --> 01:42:36,713

Don't worry.

It's one o'clock in the morning,
what the hell do you want?

1273
01:43:24,771 --> 01:43:28,934
Loretta's on the road, lady.
How the hell did you get this number?

1274
01:43:31,569 --> 01:43:33,645
Quit that crying, lady.

1275
01:43:36,324 --> 01:43:39,360
Quit it and I'll give Loretta your message.

1276

Yeah.

1277
01:43:42,830 --> 01:43:46,282
All right, you liked her last album a lot.

1278
01:43:48,878 --> 01:43:50,954
She loves you too.

1279
01:43:52,882 --> 01:43:54,958
She'll pray for you too.

1280
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:00,878
Lady, you're gonna have to quit
that crying.

1281
01:44:00,932 --> 01:44:04,550
Get yourself some sleep,
gonna be better in the morning,

I guarantee it.

1283

No. You didn't wake me up.

Whoa, babies.

1369
01:55:06,430 --> 01:55:08,304
Hey.

1370
01:55:08,349 --> 01:55:11,468
- I got something I wanna show you.
- What?

1371
01:55:16,106 --> 01:55:17,980
(Tyres squealing)

1372
01:55:18,025 --> 01:55:20,101
Slow down, Doo!

1373
01:55:33,082 --> 01:55:36,201
- What do you think?
- About what?

1374
01:55:37,461 --> 01:55:40,166
What are you up to, Doo?

1375
01:55:40,214 --> 01:55:43,547
I'm gonna build us a house right here.

1376
01:55:45,761 --> 01:55:48,003
That's a hell of a view, ain't it?

1377
01:55:48,055 --> 01:55:52,302
I picked this particular spot
on account of from right in there

1378
01:55:52,351 --> 01:55:55,518
it looks a bit like Kentucky used to be.

1379
01:55:56,981 --> 01:56:00,812
Thought I'd put the bedroom
at the front of the house

1380
01:56:01,902 --> 01:56:06,694
so we can wake up and look out
and watch the sun come up.

1381
01:56:08,075 --> 01:56:12,452
Thought back here would be
a good place for a breakfast nook...

1382
01:56:12,496 --> 01:56:14,987
Dadgummit, Doo.

1383
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:18,207
You never asked me nothing
about no new house.

1384
01:56:18,252 --> 01:56:20,375
I wanted to surprise you, baby.

1385
01:56:20,421 --> 01:56:23,256
Well, stop surprising me.

1386
01:56:23,298 --> 01:56:26,252
You never ask me about nothing.

1387
01:56:27,928 --> 01:56:30,419
Hell, I thought you'd want a new house.

1388
01:56:31,515 --> 01:56:33,721
For the privacy if not for nothing else.

1389
01:56:33,767 --> 01:56:37,635
I ain't said I don't want no new house.

1390
01:56:37,688 --> 01:56:42,480
I just said you ain't asked me
nothing about it. You never do.

1391
01:56:42,526 --> 01:56:46,191
You just say, "Here's the deal,
take it or leave it!"

1392
01:56:46,238 --> 01:56:47,981
It's driving me crazy.

1393
01:56:48,032 --> 01:56:53,571
Hell, let's call the lawyers and get
a divorce. I'm tired of this bullshit.

1394
01:56:56,707 --> 01:57:01,333
I don't want no divorce,
I just want the bedroom in the back!

1395
01:57:03,797 --> 01:57:06,549
You put the dadgum bedroom
in the front

1396
01:57:06,592 --> 01:57:11,052
and the sun comes in every morning
at five o'clock and shines in my eyes.

1397
01:57:11,096 --> 01:57:13,172
How am I supposed to sleep?

1398
01:57:13,265 --> 01:57:18,260
You're not too ignorant to get up
and pull the blinds down, are you?

1399
01:57:18,312 --> 01:57:20,518
No, and I'm not too ignorant to know

1400
01:57:20,564 --> 01:57:24,609
that the bedroom don't belong
where the living room ought to be.

1401
01:57:24,651 --> 01:57:26,774
(Doo growls, Loretta mimics him)

1402
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:30,770
Stop growling, you sound like
an old bear or something.

1403
01:57:33,285 --> 01:57:37,449
All right, we'll put the bedroom
in the back of the house.

1404
01:57:40,417 --> 01:57:44,545
Let's not be too hasty, maybe we oughta
leave the bedroom in the front,

1405
01:57:44,588 --> 01:57:47,708
it's always been there
and it's purty here.

1406
01:57:47,758 --> 01:57:52,669
It's beautiful. We'll put a bedroom
in the back and one in the front too.

1407
01:57:52,721 --> 01:57:56,422
Great. Then we'll both have
our own bedroom.

1408
01:57:56,475 --> 01:58:00,686
No, I'm gonna be living in a tree house
up the hill there.

1409
01:58:04,733 --> 01:58:07,900
