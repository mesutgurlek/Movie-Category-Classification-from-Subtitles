NARRATOR: <i>Long, long ago,</i>
<i>in the Land Before Time,</i>

5
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,694
<i>great beasts ruled</i>
<i>the world.</i>

6
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:57,597
<i>These mighty beasts</i>
<i>were the dinosaurs.</i>

7
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,871
<i>Yes, it was</i>
<i>a place of wonder,</i>

8
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,314
<i>but also filled</i>
<i>with danger...</i>

9
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:10,373
(ROARS)

10
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:12,449
<i>...where survival</i>
<i>was uncertain</i>

11
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:16,151
<i>and families were sometimes</i>
<i>torn apart.</i>

12
00:01:22,662 --> 00:01:23,651
(CROAKS)

13
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,365
<i>Which is how the young</i>
<i>Longneck named Littlefoot</i>

14
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:34,602
<i>came to live with</i>
<i>his grandmother,</i>
<i>grandfather,</i>

15
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:37,676
<i>and his close friends</i>

16
00:01:37,744 --> 00:01:40,838
<i>in the beautiful</i>
<i>Great Valley.</i>

17
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:54,224
<i>The perils of the world had</i>
<i>claimed his mother and</i>
<i>separated him from his father.</i>

18
00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:59,955
<i>Then,</i>
<i>a miraculous day came.</i>

19
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,459
<i>Littlefoot and his father,</i>
<i>Bron, were reunited.</i>

20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,138
<i>During the time</i>
<i>they were apart,</i>

21
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,509
<i>Bron had become</i>
<i>the leader of a large</i>
<i>migrating herd.</i>

22
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:17,876
<i>This meant he couldn't</i>
<i>stay with Littlefoot in</i>
<i>the Great Valley.</i>

23
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:22,321
<i>Bron wanted his son</i>
<i>to join him,</i>

24
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:25,622
<i>and Littlefoot wanted</i>
<i>to be with his father,</i>

25
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:28,392
<i>but he also didn't want</i>
<i>to leave his home.</i>

26
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:37,267
<i>So Littlefoot made the</i>
<i>tough decision to stay</i>
<i>with his grandfather,</i>

27
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,634
<i>grandmother</i>
<i>and friends.</i>

<i>Now each year,</i>

29
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,906
<i>when the Season of New Growth</i>
<i>follows the Cold Time,</i>

30
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:53,349
<i>and the warm sunshine</i>
<i>falls softly</i>
<i>on the Great Valley,</i>

31
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:58,416
<i>Littlefoot looks forward</i>
<i>to a visit from his father,</i>

32
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:02,718
<i>leading the great herd</i>
<i>on their yearly migration.</i>

33
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:10,130
<i>It's a reunion he dreams</i>
<i>about all year long.</i>

34
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:20,371
<i>And it will be</i>

I, uh... Well, everybody
calls me Wild Arms,

160
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,974
though I never really
figured out why.

161
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:40,810
Oh. (LAUGHS)
That makes so much
sense now!

162
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:43,420
What happened,
Wild Arms?

163
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:45,724
Aw, I mean
what didn't happen?

164
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:48,022
The earth shook
and spit liquid fire.

165
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:50,858
And the heat...
Like you've never
seen before!

166
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,158
But, it's too upsetting
to talk about.

167
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:58,532
But if you must know,
it all started
with a horrible boom!

168
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:01,935
<i>The Fire Mountain</i>
<i>exploded.</i>

169
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:05,739
<i>It just blew its top.</i>
<i>Fire everywhere</i>
<i>you looked.</i>

170
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,411
<i>There was no escape.</i>

171
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:14,285
<i>And the Longnecks, oh,</i>
<i>they were hit the hardest.</i>

172
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:19,681
<i>Let me tell you,</i>
<i>their leader was brave.</i>

173
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:22,621
<i>He wouldn't leave</i>
<i>any of us behind,</i>

174
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:25,061
<i>even though</i>
<i>he was in danger.</i>

175
00:11:26,232 --> 00:11:30,293
<i>I only escaped thanks</i>
<i>to my superior</i>
<i>grace and agility.</i>

176
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:35,337
The leader is
my dad.

177
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:36,802
Who?

178
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:38,203
Bron.

179
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:41,209
Oh, yes, yes,
that's him!

180
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,713
Bron!

181
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:44,945
What a brave Longneck
he was.

182
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:46,007
Ooh.

183
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:49,418
Er... Is.
Uh, is!

184
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:52,424
'Cause he's still is...
He still is... I'm sure.

185
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:54,320
What happened
to him?

186
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:57,862
I don't know.
I lost sight of him
at the Fire Mountain.

187
00:11:58,164 --> 00:11:59,597
He's in trouble?

188
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:02,293
Grandpa, we have
to help him.

189
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:04,129
Littlefoot...

190
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:06,962
Will you take us
back there?

191
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,371
You know the way.

192
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:12,769
So, you want me
to take you

193
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,005
across the earthbreak,

194
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,605
through the Land of the
Feather-Head Sharptooth,

195
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:18,274
along the moving water

196
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:21,809
back to the same
Fire Mountain that I just
escaped from?

197
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:25,657
How foolish
do you think I look?

198
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:32,792
Let me put it
another way.

199
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:35,163
The answer is no!

200
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:39,994
Please. That's my dad.
He needs our help.

201
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:43,634
He's right, Littlefoot.
We can't do it.

202
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:45,601
But...

203
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:47,611
You'll go, won't you?

204
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:59,749
I'm sorry, Littlefoot.
It's too dangerous now.

205
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:04,029
We must wait for the mountain
to stop spitting rocks.

206
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,596
Bron wouldn't want us
to get hurt.

207
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,163
But my dad needs us now!

208
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:13,363
Your father is very
strong and wise.

209
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:15,669
He's lived through
many earthshakes.

210
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:19,377
I'm sure he's on his way
here right now.

211
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,392
Where are you, Dad?

212
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:44,694
CERA: There you are.

213
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:47,132
We couldn't
find you anywhere.

214
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:49,197
We all worry about you.

215
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,775
We are sorry
about your father.

216
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:54,278
Yes, we are.

217
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:56,608
Yes, we sorry.

218
00:13:57,283 --> 00:13:58,614
Thanks.

219
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:01,414
I think he's in trouble.
He needs me.

220
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:03,185
What can you do?

221
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:05,486
I'm going
to the Fire Mountain.

222
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:07,890
I'm going to help him.

223
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:11,486

Oh, that funny,

224
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:14,931
Petrie thought you say
you going to Fire Mountain.

225
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:17,265
I... I did say that.
I'm going.

226
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:21,064
No seem funny now.

227
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:23,402

228
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,501
You don't even know
how to get there.

229
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:27,970

230
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:31,505
Across the earthbreak,

we're going to the
Fire Mountain...

00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,158
I don't.
He's my father.

No.

We don't have
to go across!

261
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:16,213
We can follow it
to the Long Valley.
(WIND HOWLING)
