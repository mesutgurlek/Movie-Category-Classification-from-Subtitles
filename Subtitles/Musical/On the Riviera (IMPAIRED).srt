Uh, Antibes. Hmm.

607
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:54,012
I thought you would.
I'll see you later, darling?

608
00:45:54,082 --> 00:45:56,175
Yes, Louise.

609
00:45:56,251 --> 00:45:58,515
Henri, what happened at Antibes?

610
00:45:58,587 --> 00:46:01,784
Lili, would you believe me
if I told you I didn't remember?

611
00:46:01,857 --> 00:46:03,916
Yes, indeed, I would.

612
00:46:03,992 --> 00:46:07,951
Oh, the Peritons.
Madeleine, I'm so glad you could come.

613
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:11,158
- I'm very happy to be here, Lili.
- You are beautiful as always.

614
00:46:11,233 --> 00:46:13,326
- Henri.
- Good evening.

615
00:46:13,402 --> 00:46:15,495
- Henri.
- How are you, uh, Felix?

616
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,663
- Delighted to see you.
- Thank you.

617
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:20,469
- And surprised. I rather
thought you'd be in London.
- London?

618
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:23,272
What could I do in London
that I cannot do here?

619
00:46:23,345 --> 00:46:26,143
- You could be seeing Sir Hubert Canon.
- Shh!

620
00:46:26,214 --> 00:46:28,307
Oh, yes, Sir Hubert.

621
00:46:28,383 --> 00:46:31,944
He's a charming fellow,
but hardly worth a trip to London.

622
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,456
Lili, why don't we invite Sir Hubert down
for a weekend soon?

623
00:46:35,524 --> 00:46:38,652
- Oh, but, Henri, he's so dull.
- Oh, no, not really.

624
00:46:38,727 --> 00:46:41,321
It's only the way he talks.

- Yes.

- Henri, perhaps you could
spare me a few moments.
- Yes?

630
00:46:56,078 --> 00:46:59,309
That little business matter-
I'd like to discuss it with you.

631
00:46:59,381 --> 00:47:02,578
- Business matter?
- Yes. You know what I mean, of course.

632
00:47:02,651 --> 00:47:05,518
- Uh, hmm.
- [ Philippe ] Henri!

633
00:47:05,587 --> 00:47:08,647
Pardon. You must come at once-
the telephone.

634
00:47:08,724 --> 00:47:10,817
- The air ministry.
- Air ministry?

635
00:47:10,892 --> 00:47:13,360
- About the planes.
- Oh, good, good.

636
00:47:13,428 --> 00:47:17,194
- The planes?
- Yes. Will you excuse us, Felix?

637
00:47:17,265 --> 00:47:19,199
I'll take it in there.

638
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:25,965
- What did he want?
- Something about business.

639
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:28,566
- He wants to see me alone.
- Do not! Whatever you do-

640
00:47:28,643 --> 00:47:31,168
- Do not let him see you alone.
- Suppose he corners me.

641
00:47:31,246 --> 00:47:33,339
- What do I do?
- Radiate confidence.

642
00:47:33,415 --> 00:47:35,747
- Be very sure of yourself.
- But do not say a word.

643
00:47:35,817 --> 00:47:37,910
And another thing,
with Madame Duran-

644
00:47:37,986 --> 00:47:40,079
- You are being much too attentive.
- What?

645
00:47:40,155 --> 00:47:42,248
- Everyone will know-
- That you are not Henri.

646
00:47:42,324 --> 00:47:45,521
- You may pay attention to all
the other women at the party.
- But not Lili.

647
00:47:45,594 --> 00:47:49,189
Look, I thought I was giving an inspired
performance. If you want a run-of-the-mill-

648
00:47:49,264 --> 00:47:51,129
- You understand. It is dangerous-
- [ Knocking ]

Pardon me, Capitaine.
Could I speak with you for a moment?

650
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,863
- Certainly, Antoine.
- In private.

651
00:47:56,938 --> 00:47:58,997
Oh. Excuse me, gentlemen.

652
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:04,706
- What is it?
- There's a young lady to see you, Capitaine.

653
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,944
- I showed her into the library.
- Uh- Well, do I know her?

654
00:48:09,017 --> 00:48:12,976
I do my best to keep track, Capitaine,
but this is one I have never seen before.

655
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,218
Uh, it's a little difficult
for me to see her now.

656
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:19,624
- Why don't you send her away?
- I'm afraid that's easier said than done, Capitaine.

657
00:48:19,694 --> 00:48:23,130
She's quite persistent
and might make a most unpleasant scene.

658
00:48:23,198 --> 00:48:26,326
- Ah!
- If I might suggest, you are
most adept in such matters.

659
00:48:26,401 --> 00:48:28,995
I am? Oh, yes, of course I am, but-

660

I have never been in the service
of any gentleman who could handle them as well...

I- Good evening, mademoiselle.

666
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:57,262
Capitaine Duran,
are you surprised to see me?

667
00:48:57,332 --> 00:49:00,665
Surprised?
I am delighted, astonished.

668
00:49:00,735 --> 00:49:03,829
But you invited me.
Or did I misunderstand you?

669
00:49:03,905 --> 00:49:05,930
No. No.

670
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:09,704
It's just that I thought you had given
your heart to that young American.

671
00:49:09,778 --> 00:49:14,112
- Martin?
- Yes, he is such a handsome, such a gifted, such a-

672
00:49:14,182 --> 00:49:16,275
Such a big, ugly pig!

673
00:49:16,351 --> 00:49:20,515
But, mademoiselle,
I have always found him charming.

674
00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:23,717
- You don't know him.
- Ah, you are angry.

675
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:27,319
That is why you have come to see me-
because you are angry with him.

676
00:49:27,395 --> 00:49:29,989
Why do you keep talking about him?

677
00:49:30,065 --> 00:49:34,229
I have a very good reason.
You see, my wife and he-

678
00:49:34,302 --> 00:49:36,634
- No!
- Yes.

679
00:49:36,705 --> 00:49:38,798
She is very attracted to him.

680
00:49:38,874 --> 00:49:40,899
- She is?
- Yes.

681
00:49:40,976 --> 00:49:43,911
And he's attracted to her? Yes?

682
00:49:43,979 --> 00:49:46,072
I'm afraid so.

683
00:49:46,148 --> 00:49:49,914
- There's only one thing we can do, mademoiselle.
- What?

684
00:49:49,985 --> 00:49:52,920
We must, uh, console each other.

685
00:49:55,423 --> 00:49:58,415
- This is our vengeance.
- Please, Capitaine.

686
00:49:58,493 --> 00:50:02,361
Uh-huh. I was right.
You do belong to Martin.

687
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,523
I belong to no one but myself.

688
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:07,466
It's just that you-

689
00:50:07,536 --> 00:50:10,061
you go too quickly.

690
00:50:10,138 --> 00:50:13,073
Very well, my dear.
I will not frighten you.

691

We have the whole night before us.

00:50:15,377 --> 00:50:17,937
What a beautiful home
you have, Capitaine.

693
00:50:18,013 --> 00:50:21,039
- What lovely pictures.
- I'm glad you like them.

694
00:50:21,116 --> 00:50:23,516
This one- those little dogs,
they are adorable.

695
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:29,980
Yes. I raised those puppies myself.

696
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:34,459
I can hardly believe it, Capitaine.

697
00:50:34,528 --> 00:50:37,793
With all these lovely women,
do you really care for me?

698

My angel, I cannot tell you
what you do to me.

699

Just looking at you is like a tonic.

Yes, Capitaine Duran. You and I.

- Our vengeance will really be sweet.
- Darling.

- What was that for?
- You pig! I knew it was you all the time.

703
00:50:53,881 --> 00:50:56,441
You did, huh? You did not.
You thought I was Duran.

704
00:50:56,517 --> 00:50:58,849
And you thought they were puppies.
Well, take a look.

705
00:50:58,919 --> 00:51:00,910
They are horses.
Horses as big as a house.

You thought you were going places.
You came here to throw yourself into his arms.

707
00:51:03,991 --> 00:51:06,391
What are you doing here?
You came here because of that woman.

708

- She doesn't even know who I am.
- You don't fool me.

- You don't care about me anymore.
- Stop screaming and listen to me!

710

They're paying me a half
a million francs for this.

And who am I gonna spend it on? You.

- Half of a million francs?
- Yes.

Oh, baby, I'm sorry. Television.

- [ Gasps ] Jack, the television.
- What television?

715
00:51:27,581 --> 00:51:30,345
Gapeaux made arrangements for you
to be on television tonight and you're not there.

716
00:51:30,418 --> 00:51:33,751
- Why didn't he tell me?
- It all happened today.
He has been looking for you.

717
00:51:33,821 --> 00:51:37,382
Jack, he's furious. He said if you're not there,
you'll never work again.

Oh, it was the chance
of a lifetime too.

- I'll make it.
- But how?

I'll get there somehow.
You go back to the theater.

Tell Gapeaux I'll be there,
not to cancel the show.

722

- If necessary, you go on first.
You better go out this way.
- All right, baby, but hurry.

- I will. I'll get there as quick as I can.
- Kiss me.

if we could step into the library...

we might have our

01:05:40,601 --> 01:05:43,001
I would certainly like
to see such a telegram.

903
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:46,164
I'll be very happy to get it
and show it to you.

904
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:19,200
- Oh, Capitaine.
- Yes, Antoine?

905
01:06:19,273 --> 01:06:23,300
- That young lady you told to wait on the terrace-
- What? Oh, yes.

906
01:06:23,377 --> 01:06:25,641
No, sir. She's no longer there.

907
01:06:25,712 --> 01:06:30,911
She became quite impatient, so I put her
in the upstairs sitting room. She is furious.

908
01:06:30,984 --> 01:06:33,976
Ah. Well, uh, you speak to her.

909
01:06:34,054 --> 01:06:36,079
I'm afraid that would
do no good, Capitaine.

910
01:06:36,156 --> 01:06:38,386
If I may say so,
once they have met you...

911
01:06:38,458 --> 01:06:40,449
it seems to spoil them
for anyone else.

912
01:06:40,527 --> 01:06:42,791
[ Sighs ]
I suppose that is true.

913
01:06:42,863 --> 01:06:45,559
- Very well, I will see her.
- Thank you, Capitaine.

914
01:06:49,202 --> 01:06:52,137
Oh, Henri.
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

915
01:06:52,205 --> 01:06:54,230
We will forget about the telegram.

916
01:06:54,308 --> 01:06:57,277
- And we will talk things over like friends.
- Yes, but, uh-

917
01:06:57,344 --> 01:06:59,835
I know, I know.
I perhaps did say that in the telegram.

918
01:06:59,913 --> 01:07:03,644
But it is of no consequence at all.

919
01:07:08,889 --> 01:07:11,187
Henri, you do not understand me.

920
01:07:11,258 --> 01:07:14,489
- And I do not understand you.
- What could be fairer than that?

921
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:18,657
But you are acting so strangely.
I'm beginning to think you do not care.

922
01:07:23,103 --> 01:07:25,594
- There is no need to worry.
- Henri will be-

923
01:07:27,341 --> 01:07:30,777
Look, that actor. He's back.

924
01:07:30,844 --> 01:07:33,540
- Oh, if Periton sees him-
- It will spoil everything.

925
01:07:33,613 --> 01:07:35,706
We've got to get him out of here.

926
01:07:38,885 --> 01:07:40,978
- What are you doing? Go away.
- Far away.

927
01:07:41,054 --> 01:07:43,784
- What is the matter with you?
- We do not need you any longer.

928
01:07:43,857 --> 01:07:46,451
- Duran is back.
- Duran, Duran. I am Duran.

929
01:07:46,526 --> 01:07:50,485
- You're-
- Certainly. I do not know how,
but Martin is in there.

930
01:07:50,564 --> 01:07:53,658
- Martin? But he's at the theater.
- I tell you he is in there.

931
01:07:53,734 --> 01:07:55,725
Then you cannot stay here, Henri.

932
01:07:55,802 --> 01:07:58,532
Where shall I go,
to his nightclub and do his act?

933
01:07:58,605 --> 01:08:01,369
It will be all right
if you two go into the office.

934
01:08:01,441 --> 01:08:05,309
- "It will be all right."
- Do not worry. He has been told
not to commit himself.

935
01:08:05,379 --> 01:08:08,746
I will wait out here.

936
01:08:08,815 --> 01:08:12,046
- Hmm.
- Will you please stop doing that?

937
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:15,520
It is driving me mad. Say something.

938
01:08:15,589 --> 01:08:18,149
- Felix.
- Yes?

939
01:08:18,225 --> 01:08:21,683
Have a cigar.

940
01:08:21,762 --> 01:08:25,528
Bonbons. I never know where anything is
in this house anymore.

941
01:08:25,599 --> 01:08:29,330
Oh, please, Henri. Let's come down to business.
What about the telephone?

942
01:08:29,403 --> 01:08:31,701
- Telephone?
- Yes, the telephone.

943
01:08:31,772 --> 01:08:34,707
- Felix, I have a confession to make.
- Ah.

944
01:08:34,775 --> 01:08:37,835
I do not know where
the telephone is either.

945
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:40,709
Always redecorating.
Always something new.

946
01:08:40,781 --> 01:08:42,772
I go around the world in two days.

947
01:08:42,849 --> 01:08:46,080
I arrive back, Lili
has changed everything.

948
01:08:46,153 --> 01:08:50,556
Henri, something has happened to you.
Your trip- you should take a vacation.

949
01:08:50,624 --> 01:08:53,787
Really, Felix? Where do you think
I should go at this time of year?

950
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:57,057
Well, at this time of year,
I think a cruise on your boat would be-

951
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:59,121
How did we come to talk about this?

952
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:03,465
How did we come
to talk about this? Let me see.

953
01:09:03,537 --> 01:09:06,973
I was doing this and you said
I should stop because it was driving you crazy.

954
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,770
Then I offered you a cigar,
but it turned out to be bonbons.

955
01:09:09,843 --> 01:09:12,243
I said, "I never know where anything
is in this house anymore."

956
01:09:12,312 --> 01:09:14,280
You said, "What about the telephone?"
I said, "I do not know"-

957
01:09:14,347 --> 01:09:18,249
All right, Henri. I see your game.
You're fencing for time.

958
01:09:18,318 --> 01:09:21,151
- So?
- You do not wish to make a deal tonight...

959
01:09:21,221 --> 01:09:25,385
because tomorrow, you will make a better deal
with the air ministry, is that not true?

960
01:09:25,459 --> 01:09:28,223
Hmm.

961
01:09:28,295 --> 01:09:30,286
I wish I knew
what you are thinking.

962
01:09:30,363 --> 01:09:33,730
But I cannot afford to take a chance.
Air Europa must have those planes.

963
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,997
My first and last offer,
20 billion francs.

964
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:39,095
- 20 billion-
- Shh.

965
01:09:39,172 --> 01:09:42,938
- 20 billion francs.
- Hmm.

966
01:09:43,009 --> 01:09:46,570
Very well, then. 25 billion.

967
01:09:46,646 --> 01:09:48,944
Hmm.

968
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:53,244
- What has happened?
- I do not know. They are still in there.

969
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,345
Stay inside. I will let you know.

970
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:09,165
I have to find my wife.

971
01:10:15,742 --> 01:10:18,267
- What did he say?
- He said he had to find his wife.

972
01:10:18,345 --> 01:10:21,678
- No. What did he say in there?
- I don't know. I think that guy is wacky.

973
01:10:21,748 --> 01:10:23,773
And I'm not so sure
about you either.

974
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:26,648
- You must go away from here
at once. Duran has returned.
- He has?

975
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,211
Yes. Here's the rest of your money.
Go out through the library.

976
01:10:29,289 --> 01:10:31,314
Wait a minute.
What about my clothes upstairs?

977
01:10:31,391 --> 01:10:35,122
You can get everything tomorrow,
but go, please, and quick.

978
01:10:42,869 --> 01:10:46,635
- Our friend has finally gone.
- Good. What has happened?

979
01:10:46,706 --> 01:10:51,370
- I don't know nothing. I think this Martin is wacky.
- At least he is gone.

980
01:10:51,444 --> 01:10:54,174
If I only knew what I said in there,
I'd be much happier.

981
01:10:54,247 --> 01:10:56,477
[ Sighs ]

982
01:10:57,918 --> 01:11:00,614
Mimi, I'm delighted-

983
01:11:04,424 --> 01:11:06,722
Oh, this Martin.

984
01:11:06,793 --> 01:11:09,819
Mimi has never slapped anybody before.
[ Chuckles ]

985
01:11:09,896 --> 01:11:12,956
Perhaps he should have
paid us for tonight's work.

986
01:11:14,935 --> 01:11:17,529
- Good night, Henri.
- Good night, Madeleine.

987
01:11:17,604 --> 01:11:19,595
- Lovely evening.
- Thank you. Felix.

988
01:11:19,673 --> 01:11:21,698
I meant every word I said, Henri.

989
01:11:21,775 --> 01:11:24,710
And when I see you tomorrow,
I will prove it to you. Good night.

990
01:11:24,778 --> 01:11:27,246
- Good night, Felix.
- Good night, gentlemen.

991
01:11:27,314 --> 01:11:29,874
Good night.

992
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:32,282
See me tomorrow?
What did he mean by that?

993
01:11:32,352 --> 01:11:34,377
- Just what he said.
- He will see you tomorrow.

994
01:11:34,454 --> 01:11:36,718
Ah, no. There was
something underneath it.

995
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:38,883
Do you think that Martin
gave the whole thing away?

996
01:11:38,959 --> 01:11:41,189
How could he?
He did not know anything.

997
01:11:41,261 --> 01:11:44,788
- He knew how to fascinate Lili.
- He certainly did.

998
01:11:44,864 --> 01:11:47,230
You, uh, have not
told Lili I am back?

999
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:50,201
No, you are still in London
as far as she's concerned.

1000
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:53,603
Then I am still in London
as far as you are concerned.

1001
01:11:53,673 --> 01:11:56,767
I think I will be Monsieur Martin till
the party is over...

1002
01:11:56,843 --> 01:11:59,539
and even afterwards perhaps.

1003
01:12:14,961 --> 01:12:19,489
- It must be very bad.
- Asking us to rush out to the boat like this.

1004
01:12:23,503 --> 01:12:25,994
- [ Knock On Door ]
- Yes?

1005
01:12:27,306 --> 01:12:29,797
- Bad news?
- From Periton?

1006
01:12:29,876 --> 01:12:32,310
- Something far more tragic.
- More tragic?

1007
01:12:32,378 --> 01:12:35,142
- Good heavens. What?
- I have lost everything.

1008
01:12:35,214 --> 01:12:39,241
- Tell us, Henri. Tell us.
- It's Lili. She has betrayed me.

1009
01:12:39,318 --> 01:12:42,446
- Last night she was in the arms of another man.
- Oh, I don't believe it.

1010
01:12:42,522 --> 01:12:46,117
- How do you know?
- How do I know? I was there.

1011
01:12:46,192 --> 01:12:49,753
- You mean you actually-
- Yes. I wish I could say no.

1012
01:12:49,829 --> 01:12:54,425
- Poor Henri. Who was the man?
- I was.

1013
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:58,197
- Perhaps we did not understand.
- Of course not. How could you understand?

1014
01:12:58,271 --> 01:13:00,762
You cannot imagine
such an experience.

1015
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,831
Last night I went to her room.

1016
01:13:02,909 --> 01:13:05,844
I took her in my arms
and kissed her tenderly...

1017
01:13:05,912 --> 01:13:08,312
hoping against hope
she would rebuff me.

1018
01:13:08,381 --> 01:13:13,785
But she did not. She kissed me eagerly,
fiercely. It was horrible.

1019
01:13:13,853 --> 01:13:16,378
- What's horrible about a wife kissing-
- Her own husband?

1020
01:13:16,455 --> 01:13:20,721
She was not kissing her husband. She thought
I was Martin. She thought she was kissing him.

1021
01:13:20,793 --> 01:13:23,159
But she wasn't kissing him.
She was kissing you.

1022
01:13:23,229 --> 01:13:26,665
- So she was the one who was fooled.
- That is not the point.

1023
01:13:26,732 --> 01:13:29,633
Last night, with him- with me-

1024
01:13:29,702 --> 01:13:33,729
she was a completely different woman
than she ever was with me.

1025
01:13:33,806 --> 01:13:36,798
I've been such a fool.

1026
01:13:36,876 --> 01:13:40,141
I never realized how
wonderful she is until now.

1027
01:13:40,213 --> 01:13:43,478
Now it is too late.
She's in love with that actor.

1028
01:13:43,549 --> 01:13:46,177
There's nothing I can do about it.

1029
01:13:46,252 --> 01:13:49,881
I cannot even blame Martin for what
he did, because he did not do it.

1030
01:13:49,956 --> 01:13:51,981
I did it myself.

1031
01:13:52,058 --> 01:13:55,186
You have certainly placed yourself
in an embarrassing position.

1032
01:13:55,261 --> 01:13:58,253
It's horrible.
That's why I sent for you.

1033
01:13:58,331 --> 01:14:04,167
I cannot go back to the villa.
I-I could not face her. I'm sailing in an hour.

1034
01:14:04,237 --> 01:14:06,728
- But what about our company?
- What about Periton?

1035
01:14:06,806 --> 01:14:12,005
That is your affair.
I am no longer interested in anything.

1036
01:14:12,078 --> 01:14:15,536
Oh, Henri. It is impossible.
I do not believe Lili would do such a thing.

1037
01:14:15,615 --> 01:14:19,244
- Why not?
- Every man in France has tried to
make love to Lili and failed.

1038
01:14:19,318 --> 01:14:21,513
There was never any other
man for Lili but you.

1039
01:14:21,587 --> 01:14:23,782
She knew it was you last night.
All the time.

1040
01:14:23,856 --> 01:14:26,757
Of course she did.
She just wanted to teach you a lesson.

1041
01:14:26,826 --> 01:14:28,851
You think so?

1042
01:14:28,928 --> 01:14:31,590
- Knowing Lili, it is obvious.
- Think about it.

1043
01:14:34,166 --> 01:14:36,191
I wonder.

1044
01:14:36,269 --> 01:14:38,794
She did act rather
strangely last night.

1045
01:14:38,871 --> 01:14:43,240
At first, uh, she was quite angry.
Then suddenly, she changed.

1046
01:14:43,309 --> 01:14:46,437
- That was the moment she discovered it was you.
- Definitely.

1047
01:14:46,512 --> 01:14:49,242
Right now, she's probably
laughing her head off.

- And I have been worrying about nothing.
- Of course.

1049
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,146
Then perhaps it is time
I gave her something to worry about.

1050
01:14:57,223 --> 01:15:00,750
- Come, my friends. I will telephone to shore.
- What for?

1051
01:15:00,893 --> 01:15:03,885
First I shall call
the airport, then my wife.

- Come in.

1053
01:15:20,212 --> 01:15:24,444
- Good morning, madame.
- Good morning, Antoine. Isn't it a lovely day?

1054
01:15:24,517 --> 01:15:27,247
Yes, madame. The capitaine would like
to speak with you.

1055
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:30,187
- Why doesn't he come in?
- He's on the telephone, madame.

1056

The telephone?
Here. Take this, Antoine.

1057

Hello, Henri.

1058
01:15:38,497 --> 01:15:41,955
You might at least have come in
and said good morning to me before you left.

1059
01:15:42,034 --> 01:15:45,993
- Where are you anyway?
- I'm here at the airport, my dear.

1060
01:15:46,072 --> 01:15:48,870
I'm sorry I could not get home
for the reception last night...

1061
01:15:48,941 --> 01:15:51,808
but, uh, we ran into bad weather
and we were forced down.

1062
01:15:51,877 --> 01:15:56,109
You mean you've just arrived?
You weren't at home last night?

1063
01:15:56,182 --> 01:15:59,982
No, of course not, my dear.
Why? Did something happen?

1064
01:16:00,052 --> 01:16:04,614
Oh, no, Henri.
No, nothing happened, nothing at all.

1065
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:06,681
Didn't you sleep well?

1066

Oh, yes, I- I didn't
even take a pill. Oh, my.

You sound upset, my dear.

Oh, no, Henri. It's nothing.

Good. I'm glad to hear that.

I will be home in a little while.

Yes, madame.

Hello, this is Madame Duran.

1079
01:17:18,264 --> 01:17:20,892
Would you please tell me
what time Capitaine Duran's plane landed?

1080
01:17:20,966 --> 01:17:24,800
Just a minute, madame.
It's Duran's wife. She's checking up on him.

1081
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:30,137
- What will I tell her?
- Duran told us to say his plane
got in this morning at 11:28.

1082
01:17:30,209 --> 01:17:32,404
Where do you suppose
he spent the night?

1083
01:17:32,478 --> 01:17:34,605
Hello, madame?

1084
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:38,241
According to our records, Capitaine Duran's
plane landed at 11:28 this morning.

1085
01:17:38,317 --> 01:17:42,276
This morning? Are you sure?

1086
01:17:44,356 --> 01:17:48,622
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

1087
01:17:50,963 --> 01:17:55,923
- Madame wishes to see me?
- Yes, Antoine. Did you see
Capitaine Duran this morning?

1088
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:58,094
Of course, madame.
I laid out his clothes, as usual.

1089
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:00,798
Did you notice anything-
anything different about him?

1090
01:18:00,873 --> 01:18:03,103
I mean, did he act
strangely in any way?

1091
01:18:03,175 --> 01:18:05,405
If you please, madame.
I would rather not discuss it.

1092
01:18:05,478 --> 01:18:08,777
- Oh, but you must. What happened?
- Very well, madame.

1093
01:18:08,848 --> 01:18:10,839
I've been in service for many years.

1094
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:12,975
Now, I don't look down
upon my position.

1095
01:18:13,052 --> 01:18:15,520
I consider it an honorable
and dignified calling.

1096
01:18:15,588 --> 01:18:18,421
If more people took their jobs
as seriously as I do...

1097
01:18:18,491 --> 01:18:21,460
the world wouldn't be
in the hideous mess it's in today.

1098
01:18:21,527 --> 01:18:24,291
Yes, yes, Antoine.
What did the capitaine do?

1099
01:18:24,363 --> 01:18:26,695
He was extraordinarily rude to me.

1100
01:18:26,765 --> 01:18:29,700
He didn't shower. He didn't shave.
He didn't eat his breakfast.

1101
01:18:29,768 --> 01:18:32,862
And to top it all, he completely
disregarded my selection...

1102
01:18:32,938 --> 01:18:36,032
and left wearing a blue suit
with a green tie.

1103
01:18:36,108 --> 01:18:38,542
Why, I shall be
the laughingstock of the Riviera.

1104
01:18:38,611 --> 01:18:41,444
I've never known the capitaine
to behave in this fashion before.

1105
01:18:41,514 --> 01:18:46,315
- Oh.
- It was almost as if he were another man.

1106
01:18:46,385 --> 01:18:49,013
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, Antoine.

1107
01:18:49,088 --> 01:18:52,785
So am I, madame. But it's a situation
for which there's no solution.

1108
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:55,793
If he apologizes, it will destroy our
relationship completely.

1109
01:18:55,861 --> 01:18:58,659
Then I would have to leave.
Will that be all, madame?

1110
01:18:58,731 --> 01:19:00,722
Yes, yes, Antoine. Thank you.

By now, she has
telephoned the airport.

1113
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:11,476
- I will give her five minutes more.
- But Periton.

1114
01:19:11,544 --> 01:19:16,038
They have verified my story, and the
horrible truth is beginning to dawn on her.

1115

Don't you think we ought to find out
what Periton is going to do?

1116
01:19:19,118 --> 01:19:21,143
She has called in
Michele and Antoine...

1117

and they have confirmed
her worst fears.

There's no longer
room for any doubt.

She can barely face the realization
of what she has done.

- But, Henri-
- It will take me about half an hour to get ashore...

I'm glad I found all three of you together.
I've been looking for you all morning.

- They told me at the club
you had come out here.

1126
01:19:46,111 --> 01:19:48,102
I was afraid you'd sail
without my seeing you.

1127
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:50,205
Perhaps that would
have been just as well.

1128

One would almost think
you did not want to see me.

- Well, did we?
- Didn't you tell them?

1130
01:19:55,754 --> 01:19:59,451
- What was there to tell?
- About our conference last night, of course.

1131
01:19:59,525 --> 01:20:02,221
Oh, yes, of course I told them.

1132

- And you told them the terms?
- Mmm, yes, in a general way.

1133

- Then why are they acting so gloomy?
- Why, indeed?

1134

- You do not act very cheerful yourself.
- Cheerful? Why should I?

I, uh- I am surprised
that you got it so quickly.

1139
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:31,918
I'm a man of my word. I told you last night
I would bring you the check this morning.

- And there it is.
- Yes, there it is.

business mind in Europe, Henri.

- You give me too much credit, Felix.

and you played it like a master.

Oh, don't worry. Nobody saw me.

- Why not?

1156

What you did last night was utterly contemptible.
You knew I thought you were my husband.

- Sure, I did. We had a lot of fun, didn't we?
- Fun?

Yeah. You know, I wasn't
too keen about it at first.

But when I realized the situation,
you know, with the captain gone...

01:22:06,251 --> 01:22:08,412
- and how desperate you were.
- Really?

- Oh, I'm not saying I can't use the money.
- Oh.

- And I was wondering if I could ask you a favor.
- What kind of a favor?

1163
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:19,019
Well, if it isn't too much trouble,
I'd like a letter of recommendation.

- Recommendation? After what you did?
- Yeah.

Didn't you like my performance?

- Wait a minute.

If you weren't satisfied,
why didn't you tell me before this?

1169

Because your performance
was too good.

1170
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,711
I don't mind saying you gave a pretty good
performance yourself.

Will you get out of here,
you conceited-

1172

And I'm proud of it. That's all.

1173

I just thought you might know some other homes
where I could do the same thing.

But if the captain's ever away again,
I'll be very happy to oblige.

01:23:32,903 --> 01:23:35,167
I'm delighted
you came back this morning.

1190
01:23:35,239 --> 01:23:37,730
I don't get it. You certainly haven't
been acting that way.

1191
01:23:37,808 --> 01:23:42,108
Oh, I am sorry. I'm afraid I was confused.
But I'm not anymore.

1192
01:23:42,179 --> 01:23:44,841
It's all very clear to me now.

1193
01:23:44,915 --> 01:23:48,612
Jack, I wonder, would you
do me an enormous favor?

1194
01:23:48,686 --> 01:23:52,315
- Sure, anything.
- But we must act quickly,
before my husband gets here.

1195
01:23:52,389 --> 01:23:54,380
- Okay.
- Now-

1196
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,001
Well, Monsieur Martin.

1197
01:24:12,076 --> 01:24:14,510
Uh, good morning, Captain.

1198
01:24:14,578 --> 01:24:19,379
Good morning.
I'm, uh- I'm delighted to find you here.

1199
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:21,475
- You are?
- Yes.

1200
01:24:21,552 --> 01:24:24,282
I want to thank you
for what you did for me last night.

1201
01:24:24,354 --> 01:24:27,983
I'm sending you a check in the morning
which will express my gratitude more fully.

1202
01:24:28,058 --> 01:24:31,892
Well, thanks, Captain.
I sure can use it. By the way, what did I do?

1203
01:24:31,962 --> 01:24:35,989
You made a great financial deal for me.
What did you say to Periton?

1204
01:24:36,066 --> 01:24:39,126
Oh. I said, uh, "Hmm."

1205
01:24:39,203 --> 01:24:41,831
- Oh, that.
- Yeah.

1206
01:24:41,905 --> 01:24:46,399
- I was told you always use it.
- But never with such success.

1207
01:24:46,477 --> 01:24:50,038
Look, Captain. I don't know how to say this.
It's really none of my business.

1208
01:24:50,114 --> 01:24:52,241
But you're making a great mistake.

1209
01:24:52,316 --> 01:24:56,082
- I am? How?
- Your wife. She's wonderful.

1210
01:24:56,153 --> 01:25:00,556
Believe me, she's got everything,
everything a man could ask for.

1211
01:25:00,624 --> 01:25:03,684
- I found that out.
- You know, she's so crazy about you...

1212
01:25:03,761 --> 01:25:06,252
she just tried to talk me
into making you jealous.

1213
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:10,027
- You were supposed to come up
and find her in my arms.
- Oh?

1214
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:14,002
Why don't you quit playing the field and
concentrate on her?

1215
01:25:14,071 --> 01:25:17,097
- You're right, my friend.
- Now will you go up? She's waiting for you.

1216
01:25:17,174 --> 01:25:20,075
Monsieur Martin...

1217
01:25:20,144 --> 01:25:23,045
will you and your charming Colette
have dinner with us tonight?

1218
01:25:23,113 --> 01:25:26,913
We will come to the show and afterward,
the four of us will have a big celebration.

1219
01:25:26,984 --> 01:25:30,852
- I wish we could, but, uh,
I don't know where Colette is.
- No?

1220
01:25:30,921 --> 01:25:34,550
No, she walked out on me.
She didn't understand about last night.

1221
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:39,028
- Oh, I am very sorry.
- So am I.

1222
01:25:39,096 --> 01:25:42,623
- Is there anything I can do?
- No. No, I'm afraid not.

1223
01:25:42,699 --> 01:25:46,601
- Wait a minute. You could do me one favor.
- Anything.

1224
01:25:46,670 --> 01:25:50,197
- Tell me, Captain. What's your secret?
- Secret?

1225
01:25:50,274 --> 01:25:54,074
Yeah. Let's face it. We do resemble each other.
We proved that last night.

1226
01:25:54,144 --> 01:25:57,136
But when women
look at you, they- Well, you know.

1227
01:25:57,214 --> 01:26:00,308
And when they look at me,
they run for the nearest exit.

1228
01:26:00,384 --> 01:26:02,443
What's your secret?

- Yes?

1233

Make sure she knows it's you this time.
I don't wanna get in any more trouble.

Have no fear. She will know.
