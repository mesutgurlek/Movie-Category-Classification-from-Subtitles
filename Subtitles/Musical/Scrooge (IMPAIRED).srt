01:50:54,380 --> 01:50:58,133
And if I had a flag
I'd hang me flag out

1575
01:50:58,342 --> 01:51:04,180
To add a sort of final victory touch

1576
01:51:04,348 --> 01:51:07,725
But since I left me flag at home

1577
01:51:08,436 --> 01:51:10,937
I'll simply have to say

Hello.

1587
01:52:10,748 --> 01:52:14,459
I don't know whether you can hear me,
old Jacob Marley.

1588
01:52:14,627 --> 01:52:19,214
And I don't know whether or not
I imagined the things I saw.

1589
01:52:19,381 --> 01:52:21,799
But between the pair of us we...

1590
01:52:21,967 --> 01:52:26,471
We finally made a Merry Christmas,
didn't we?

1591
01:52:27,890 --> 01:52:29,891
I have to leave you now.

1592
01:52:30,059 --> 01:52:32,310
Must go and get ready.

1593
01:52:32,478 --> 01:52:37,190
I'm going to have Christmas dinner
with my family.
