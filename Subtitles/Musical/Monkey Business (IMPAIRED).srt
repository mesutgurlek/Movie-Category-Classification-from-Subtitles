- Sorry to have to report...

00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,586
there are four stowaways
in the forward hatch.

00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:12,963
Stowaways? How do you know
there are four of them?

They were singing Sweet Adeline.

Get them out of there, you hear?

But we can't find them.

And besides,
they've been writing insulting notes.

Find them if you have
to clear out that whole hatch!

What's the matter?
Couldn't the nurse take care of herself?

135
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,678
You bet she could,
but I found it out too late. Enough of this.

Let's get back to Columbus.

137

- I'd rather get back to the nurse.
- So would I.

138
00:09:22,598 --> 00:09:24,892
But Columbus was sailing along
on his vessel.

139
00:09:24,975 --> 00:09:27,555
- On his what?
- Not on his what. On his vessel.

140
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:30,683

of yesteryear is the stowaway of today.

Well, you look exactly like them.

157
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:45,457
What do they look like?

158
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,413
One of them goes around
with a black moustache.

159
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:52,131
So do I. If I had my choice,
I'd go around with a little blonde.

160
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:55,632
I said one goes around
with a black moustache.

161
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:58,714
You couldn't expect a moustache
to go around by itself.

162
00:10:58,797 --> 00:11:01,383
Don't you think a moustache
ever gets lonely, Captain?

CHICO: Sure, it gets lonely.

164
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:06,423
When my grandfather's beard gets here,
I'd like it to meet your moustache.

165
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:09,176
I'll think it over.
I'll talk it over with my moustache.

166
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,178
Has your grandfather's beard
got any money?

167
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:14,473
- Money? Why, it fell hair to a fortune.
- Now, listen!

and I think it's you, Captain.

- Now, we can eat in peace.
- All right. Here's a piece for you.

- You sure?
- I'm positive.

- Is this yours?
- Yes, it is.

188

As I was saying, there's some
mighty beautiful country around here.

Madam, you're making history.
In fact, you're making me.

314
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:28,374
And I wish you'd keep my hands to yourself.

315
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:31,883
You know what I want.
I want life, I want laughter, I want gaiety.

[Groucho playing upbeat music]

318

Madam, before I get through with you,
you will have a clear case for divorce...

319
00:22:43,054 --> 00:22:44,138
and so will my wife.

320
00:22:44,222 --> 00:22:46,884
The first thing to do is
to arrange for a settlement.

321
00:22:46,968 --> 00:22:49,428
You take the children,
your husband takes the house.

you take the insurance and I take you.

That's the trouble with this country.
You haven't any children.

325
00:22:58,556 --> 00:23:02,810
And as for me, I'm going back in the closet
where men are empty overcoats.

326

[Upbeat instrumental music]

329
00:23:58,073 --> 00:24:01,618
Sir, this is an outrage,
breaking into a man's home.

330
00:24:01,702 --> 00:24:05,824
There'll be a letter about this in
the Times tomorrow morning.

331
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:07,033
Yeah?

332
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:12,545
But you won't read it,
'cause I'm gonna lay you out pretty.

333
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,422
You're gonna lay me out pretty?

334
00:24:14,505 --> 00:24:17,084
That's the thanks I get
for freeing an innocent girl...

who, although she is hiding
at the moment...

336
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:21,630
has promised to become
the mother of her children.

337
00:24:21,714 --> 00:24:25,214
And with that, sir, I bid you a fond farewell.
Good day, sir.

Good day.

Come out of there. I want to talk to you.

340

I'm sorry, but we're using
the old-fashioned iceman...

341
00:24:36,047 --> 00:24:39,050
and we find him very satisfactory
for keeping the house warm.

342
00:24:43,638 --> 00:24:47,177
Just as I thought, you're yellow,
grabbing at a woman's skirts.

What's the capital of Nebraska?

What's the capital
of the Chase National Bank? Give up?

346
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:57,513
Now, I'll try you on an easy one.
How many Frenchmen can't be wrong?

347
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,974
- I know...
- You were warm and so was she.

348
00:25:00,057 --> 00:25:03,144
Don't be discouraged.
With a little study you'll go a long way.

349
00:25:03,227 --> 00:25:06,265
- And I'd wish you'd start now.
- Do you see this gat?

350
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:10,019
Cute, isn't it? Santa Claus bring it
for Christmas? I got a fire engine.

351
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:12,730
Listen, mug. Do you know who I am?

Don't tell me.
Are you animal or vegetable? Animal.

Fancy meeting you here
after all these drinks.

- Wait a minute.
- Sorry, I can't stay.

356

The captain's waiting to chase me.

You can stay, all right,
until I finish with you.

Alky, darling, please!

Don't "darling" me.
Get in that next room and stay there!

I'm not good enough for her, am I?

before I drill you?

- Yes, I'd like to ask you one question.
- Go ahead.

364
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,209
Do you think that girls think less of a boy
if he lets himself be kissed?

365
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:05,333
Don't you think that although
girls go out with boys like me...

366
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,415
they always marry the other kind?

367

If you're gonna kill me, hurry up.
I have to take my tonic at 2:00.

I can use a guy with your nerve.

369

I think we could get along well together.

370
00:26:18,252 --> 00:26:21,214
Of course, the first year we might have
our little squabbles.

371

But, then, that's inevitable, don't you think?

- All right, Mr. Bozo. And you can help me.

and I want to get a guy on this boat.

until this blows over.

And I'll take care of picking up
a couple of dames.

919
01:08:55,795 --> 01:08:57,755
Women? This is no time for women.

GROUCHO: On to the barn!

921
01:09:02,176 --> 01:09:03,968
Gee, I wish I had a horse.

01:09:17,225 --> 01:09:20,186
Let me go!

925
01:09:20,269 --> 01:09:23,481
No use yelling, kid.
Nobody will hear you in here.

926
01:09:23,564 --> 01:09:25,684
You wait till my father hears about this!

927
01:09:25,768 --> 01:09:28,854
He's gonna hear about it
because I'm gonna tell him myself.

You're not going anyplace.
Don't get all excited. Come on.

You take your hands off of me!

Listen, kid. Nobody's gonna hurt you.

932

You'll be out in an hour
if your dad comes through.

I telephone Joe. Come on, you guys.

Now, make yourself at home, but shut up!

937

938

GROUCHO: Give me $1. I'll keep the change.

939
01:10:18,202 --> 01:10:19,829
That's a half a dollar I owe you.

940
01:10:28,372 --> 01:10:30,874
You call this a barn?
This looks like a stable.

941
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:33,585
It looks like a barn but smells like a stable.

942
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:35,914
Well, let's just look at it.

Get out of here!

944

Have you got a girl in that hayloft?

BUTCH: No!

946

You're a bigger fool than I thought.

01:10:43,255 --> 01:10:44,836
Beat it, I tell you!

948
01:10:44,961 --> 01:10:47,794
- What'd you say?
- I said beat it!

GROUCHO: Pardon me. What did you say?
BUTCH: I said beat it!

He said beat it.

Gee, I wish I'd said that.
Everybody's repeating it.

952
01:10:58,262 --> 01:11:00,931
I'm coming down there and get you!

953

Don't bother. We'll come right up.

[Cow mooing]

957
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,479
Here we are at the old barn,
all set for a nice picnic lunch.

958
01:11:21,563 --> 01:11:24,770
Gosh, the picnic is off,
we haven't got any red ants.

959
01:11:24,854 --> 01:11:27,562
I know an Indian who's got
a couple of Red aunts.

960
01:11:27,729 --> 01:11:30,023
Don't you think we'd better
go look for the girl?

961
01:11:30,106 --> 01:11:32,900
Let's wait till we eat,
there's hardly enough lunch for two.

I don't see why she couldn't get
kidnapped near a restaurant.

963
01:11:36,981 --> 01:11:41,360
Some dark night, I think I'll come and
lay for you if the hens don't get sore.

964
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:43,903
Here.

965
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:48,152
Go over to that filling station
and get some milk. Grade-A.

966
01:11:50,738 --> 01:11:52,823
Well, come on. Where's the milk?

967

There's a customer ahead of me.

- What are you doing here?
- What are we doing?

970
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,655
What about you, kidnapping a girl?
Old-fashioned piece of melodrama...

971
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:08,908
kidnapping a girl!
You've been reading too many dime novels.

Keep out of this loft!

01:12:14,245 --> 01:12:17,744
It's better to have loft and lost
than never to have loft at all.

- Nice work.
- Beat it, or I'll throw you out!

the only game in the stable.
