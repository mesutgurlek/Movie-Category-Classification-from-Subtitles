What a wonderful coincidence.

331
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:55,511
All right, boys, who's gonna train me?

332
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:56,378
Oh.

333
00:12:57,748 --> 00:12:59,048
Oh! Watch the face!

334
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:00,483
What's wrong with you?

335
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:02,652
Good Lord.

336
00:13:02,653 --> 00:13:04,587
You know, there was a time
when I would've paid

337
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:05,621
good money to see this.

338
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:07,290
It's nice that he's good with kids, though.

339

Come here, come here!

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

342
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,397
Galavant, I'm starting to worry
that Richard won't be ready

343
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:15,531
when the real battle comes.

344
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:18,000
Careful, Roberta.

345
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:20,536
You're starting to sound like
someone who cares for the guy.

346
00:13:20,537 --> 00:13:23,772
In love with him? Me? [Scoffs] What?

347
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:27,643
I'm not in love with him.

348
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:29,078
What's wrong with you people?!

349
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:31,146
At all.

350
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,451
Sir Galavant, tell us what it was like

351
00:13:35,452 --> 00:13:37,053
to grow up with your awesome dad.

352
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:38,788
- Yeah, tell us!
- You're so lucky!

353
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:40,156

right in front of my face.

359

And then he passed out on the dog.

360
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:54,737
And it was Christmas, and the dog died.

361

You look terrible.

409

Because you threw us in the dungeon.

00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:34,959
I know. And I'm so sorry.

411

Isabella, we owe you an apology.

And now it's over, forever,

00:16:01,986 --> 00:16:04,922
And I'm ready to become my own person.

Let's do this.

426

Let us begin.

427
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:13,597
Typically, and by kingdom charter,

428
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,266
when a princess breaks off
her engagement with the prince,

429
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,535
- it requires one simple action.
- Great.

430
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:20,671
He demands your bra.

431
00:16:20,672 --> 00:16:22,639
My... my bra?

432
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,741
Your bra... To show to my friends.

433
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:26,543
Absolutely not!

I am a liberated woman.

435
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:29,113
I am a warrior princess,

436
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:32,316
and I will not be giving
an 11-year-old my bra.

437
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:33,951
Then death it is.

440
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,289

441
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,591
