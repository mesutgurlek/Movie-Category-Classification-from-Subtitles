Look down, look down
Sweet Jesus doesn't care

I know she'll wait
I know that she'll be true

They've all forgotten you

You won't see me

You know what that means...

21

Yes! It means I'm free!

22

No! It means you get

-I stole a loaf of bread

-You robbed a house
-I broke a window pane

25
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,988
My sister's child was close to death
And we were starving

26

You will starve again
Unless you learn the meaning of the law

27
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,955
I know the meaning of those 19 years

28
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,474
A slave of the law

29
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,396

Nor forgive them for what they've done

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,356
They are the guilty, every one!

47

The day begins
and now let's see

48
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,036
What this new world
will do for me!

49
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,555
You'll have to go!
I'll pay you off for the day

50
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,234
Collect your bits and pieces there
and be on your way

51
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,316
You have given me half
what the other men get

52
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,876
This handful of tin
wouldn't buy my sweat!

53
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,836
You broke the law!
It's there for people to see

54
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,993
Why should you get the same
as honest men like me?

55
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,558
And now I know how freedom feels
The jailer always at your heels!

56
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,278
It is the law!

57
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,399
This piece of paper in my hand
It makes me cursed throughout the land

58
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,913
It is the law!

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,516
Like a cur
I walk the street

61
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,194
Come in, sir, for you are weary

62
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,594
And the night is cold out there

63
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,389
Though our lives are very humble

64
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,669
What we have, we have to share

65
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,154
There is wine here to revive you

66
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,268
There is bread to make you strong

67
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,114
There's a bed to rest till morning

68
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,951
Rest from pain, and rest from wrong

69
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,830
He let me eat my fill
I had the lion's share

70
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,196
The silver in my hand
cost twice what I had earned

71
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,909
In all those 19 years
A lifetime of despair!

72
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,829
And yet he trusted me

73
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,037
The old fool trusted me
He'd done his bit of good

74
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,029
I played the grateful serf
and thanked him like I should

75
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,597
But when the house was still
I got up in the night

76
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,509
Took the silver

77
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,716
Took my

78
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,433
flight!

79
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,473
-Tell his reverence your story!
-Let us see if he's impressed!

80
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,473
-You were lodging here last night
-You were the honest bishop's guest

81
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,519
And then, out of Christian goodness
when he learned about your plight

82
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,876
You maintain he made a present
of this silver

83
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,712
That is right!

84
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,875
But my friend, you left so early!
Surely something slipped your mind

85
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,798
You forgot I gave these also
Would you leave the best behind?

86
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,873
So, messieurs, you may release him

87
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,679
for this man has spoken true

88
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,435
I commend you for your duty

89
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,156
Now God's blessing go with you

90
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,320
But remember this, my brother

91
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,996
See in this some higher plan

92
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,989
You must use this precious silver

93
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,235
to become an honest man

94
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,189
By the witness of the martyrs

95
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,149
By the passion and the blood

96
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,518
God has raised you out of darkness

97
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,639
I have bought your soul

98
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,512
for God!

99
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,997
What have I done?
Sweet Jesus, what have I done?

100
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,315
Become a thief in the night!
Become a dog on the run!

101
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,914
And have I fallen so far
And is the hour so late

102
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,150
That nothing remains
but the cries of my hate?

103
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,629
The cries in the dark that nobody hears!

104
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,792
Here where I stand
at the turning of the years?

105
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,712
If there's another way to go
I missed it 20 long years ago

106
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,035
My life was a war that could never be won

107
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,236
They gave me a number
and murdered Valjean

108
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,155
When they chained me and left me for dead
Just for stealing a mouthful of bread!

109
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,635
Yet why did I allow this man

110
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,188
to touch my soul and teach me love?

111
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,271
He treated me like any other

112
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,751
He gave me his trust
He called me brother

113
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,593
My life he claims for God above

114
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,111
Can such things be?

115
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,120
For I had come to hate the world

116
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,792
This world that always hated me!

117
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,353
Take an eye for an eye!

118
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,997
Turn your heart into stone!

119
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,832
This is all I have lived for!

120
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,352
This is all I have known!

121
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,597
One word from him and I'd be back

122
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,036
beneath the lash, upon the rack

123
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,192
Instead he offers me my freedom!

124
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,352
I feel my shame inside me like a knife

125
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,192
He told me that I have a soul

126
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,516
How does he know?

127
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,433
What spirit comes to move my life?

128
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,830
Is there another way to go?

129
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,397
I am reaching, but I fall

130

and the night is closing in

132
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,515
to the whirlpool of my sin

133
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,956
I'll escape now from that world

From the world of Jean Valjean

135
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,237
Jean Valjean is nothing now!

Come on, Fantine, let's have all the news!

174
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,718
Dear Fantine, you must send us more money

175
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,633
Your child needs a doctor
There's no time to lose

176
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,917
Give that letter to me
It is none of your business

177
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,030
With a husband at home
and a bit on the side!

178
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,429
Is there anyone here
who can swear before God

179
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,671
She has nothing to fear?
She has nothing to hide?

180
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,750
What is this fighting all about?
Will someone tear these two apart?

181
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,917
This is a factory, not a circus

182
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,389
Now, come on, ladies, settle down!

183
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,875
I run a business of repute
I am the mayor of this town

184
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,036
I look to you to sort this out
and be as patient as you can

185
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,038
Now someone say how this began!

186
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,274
At the end of the day
she's the one who began it!

187
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,789
There's a kid that she's hiding
in some little town

188
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,554
There's a man she has to pay
You can guess how she picks up the extra

189
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,758
You can bet she's earning her keep
sleeping around!

190
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,876
And the boss wouldn't like it!

191
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,469
Yes, it's true there's a child
and the child is my daughter

192
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,593
And her father abandoned us
leaving us flat

193
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,557
Now she lives
with an innkeeper man and his wife

194
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,155
And I pay for the child
What's the matter with that?

195
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,789
At the end of the day
she'll be nothing but trouble

196
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,952
And there's trouble for all
when there's trouble for one!

197
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,635
While we're earning our daily bread
she's the one with her hands in the butter

198
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,235
You must send the slut away
or we're all gonna end in the gutter

199
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,472
And it's us who'll have to pay
At the end of the day!

200
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,189
I might have known the bitch could bite!
I might have known the cat had claws!

201
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,874
I might have guessed your little secret!

202
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,838
Ah, yes! The virtuous Fantine
Who keeps herself so pure and clean

203
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,993
You'd be the cause, I had no doubt
of any trouble hereabout

204
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,550
You play a virgin in the light
but need no urging in the night!

205
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,392
She's been laughing at you
while she's having her men!

206
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,152
She'll be nothing but trouble
again and again!

207
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,279
-You must sack her today!
-Sack the girl today!

208
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,398
Right, my girl

209
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,798
On your way!

210
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,439
There was a time when men were kind

211
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,876
When their voices were soft

212
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,191
and their words inviting

213
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,239
There was a time when love was blind

214
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,357
and the world was a song

215
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,830
and the song was exciting!

216
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,275
There was a time

217
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,237
Then it all went wrong

218
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:25,998
I dreamed a dream in time gone by

219
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,193
when hope was high and life worth living

220
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:41,038
I dreamed that love would never die

221
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,909
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

222
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,709
Then I was young and unafraid

223
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,836
And dreams were made and used
and wasted

224
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,878
There was no ransom to be paid

225
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,239
No song unsung, no wine untasted

226
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,717
But the tigers come at night

227
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,634
with their voices soft as thunder

228
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,750
As they tear your hope apart

229
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,189
As they turn your dream

230
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,992
to shame

231
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,831
He slept a summer by my side

232
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,870
He filled my days with endless wonder

233
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,433
He took my childhood in his stride

234
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,675
But he was gone when autumn came

235
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,995
And still I dream he'll come to me!

236
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,757
That we will live the years together

237
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,349
But there are dreams that cannot be

238
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,470
And there are storms we cannot weather

239
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,028
I had a dream my life would be

240
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,273
so different from this hell I'm living

241
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:03,198
So different now from what it seemed!

242
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:12,029
Now life has killed the dream

243
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:20,832
I dreamed

244
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,669
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

245
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,638
(SINGING) I smell women!
Smell 'em in the air!

246
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,518
Think I'll drop me anchor
in that harbor over there!

247
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,433
Lovely ladies!
Smell 'em through the smoke!

248
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,478
Seven months at sea
can make you hungry for a poke

249
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,393
Even stokers need a little stoke!

250
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,392
Lovely ladies waiting for a bite!

251
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,392
Waiting for the customers
who only come at night

252
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,392
Lovely ladies ready for a call

253
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,472
Standing up or lying down or any way at all

254
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,632
Bargain prices up against the wall!

255
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,393
Come here, my dear
Let's see this trinket you wear

256
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,037
This bagatelle

257
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,315
Madame, I'll sell it to you!

258
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,754
-I'll give you four
-That wouldn't pay for the chain

259
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,356
I'll give you five, you're far too eager to sell
It's up to you

260
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,556
-It's all I have!
-That's not my fault

261
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,200
-Please, make it 10!
-No more than five

262
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,029
My dear, we all must stay alive!

263
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,313
Lovely ladies waiting in the dark

264
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,278
Ready for a thick one
or a quick one in the park

265
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,397
Long time, short time, anytime, my dear!

266
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,313
Cost a little extra
if you want to take all year

267
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,551
Quick and cheap is underneath the pier!

268
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,837
What pretty hair!
What pretty locks you've got there

269
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,393
What luck you've got
It's worth a centime, my dear!

270
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,959
-I'll take the lot!
-Don't touch me! Leave me alone!

271
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,635
Let's make a price
I'll give you all of 10 francs

272
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,915
-Just think of that!
-It pays a debt

273
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,959
-Just think of that
-What can I do? It pays a debt

274
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,397
Ten francs may save my poor Cosette

275
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,113
Gimme the dirt
Who's that bit over there?

276
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,998
A bit of skirt
She's the one sold her hair

277
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,913
She's got a kid
Sends her all that she can

278
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,560
I might've known
there is always some man

279
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,359
Lovely lady, come along and join us!

280
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,635
Lovely lady!

281
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,512
Come on, dearie, why all the fuss?

282
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,237
You're no grander than the rest of us

283
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,399
Life has dropped you
at the bottom of the heap

284
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,439
Join your sisters
Make money in your sleep!

285
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,115
WHORE 1 : That's right, dearie
Let 'im have the lot

286
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,835
WHORE 2: That's right, dearie

287
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,516
Show 'im what you've got

288
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,478
Old men, young men, take 'em as they come!

289
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,472
Harbor rats and alley cats
and every kind of scum!

290
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,472
Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land

291
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,472
See them with their trousers off
They're never quite as grand!

292
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,757
All it takes is money in your hand!

293
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,356
Lovely ladies going for a song

294
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,231
Got a lot of callers
but they never stay for long

295
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,911
Come on, Captain, you can wear your shoes

296
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,152
Don't it make a change
to have a girl who can't refuse?

297
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,719
Easy money
Lying on a bed

298
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,871
Just as well they never see
the hate that's in your head!

299
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,316
Don't they know they're making love

300
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,997
to one already dead?

301
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,272
Here's something new

302
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,716
I think I'll give it a try

303
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,831
Come closer, you!

304
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,590
I like to see what I buy

305
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,517
The usual price

306
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,198
for just one slice of your pie

307
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,753
I don't want you!
No! No, monsieur, let me go!

308
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,671
Is this a trick? I won't pay more!

309
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,988
No, not at all

310
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,196
You've got some nerve, you ugly slut!

311
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,316
You've got some gall!

312
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,717
It's the same with a tart
as it is with a grocer

313
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,590
The customer sees what he gets in advance

314
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,951
It's not for the whore
to say yes sir or no sir

315
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,837
It's not for the harlot
to pick or to choose

316
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,035
Or to lead me a dance

317
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,392
I'll kill you, you bastard, try any of that!

318
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,917
Even a whore who has gone to the bad
won't be had by a rat!

319
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,111
By Christ, you'll pay for what you've done!
This rat will make you bleed, you'll see!

320
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,998
I guarantee, I'll make you suffer!

321
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,038
For this disturbance of the peace

322
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,714
For this insult to life and property!

323
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,237
I beg you, don't report me, sir
I'll do whatever you may want

324
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,596
Make your excuse to the police!

325
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,473
Tell me quickly what's the story
Who saw what, and why, and where?

326
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,394
Let him give a full description
Let him answer to Javert!

327
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,268
In this nest of whores and vipers
Let one speak who saw it all

328
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,558
Who laid hands on this good man here?
What's the substance of this brawl?

329
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,799
Javert, would you believe it?
I was crossing from the park

330
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,192
When this prostitute attacked me
You can see she left her mark!

331
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,713
She will answer for her actions
When you make a full report

332
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,078
You may rest assured, monsieur
That she will answer to the court

333
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:38,109
There's a child who sorely needs me
Please, monsieur, she's but that high

334
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:45,038
Holy God, is there no mercy?
If I go to jail she'll die!

335
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,910
I have heard such protestations
every day for 20 years

336
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,755
Let's have no more explanations
Save your breath and save your tears

337
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:00,676
Honest work, just reward
That's the way to please the Lord

338
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,632
A moment of your time, Javert
I do believe this woman's tale

339
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,790
But, Monsieur Mayor

340
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,758
You've done your duty, let her be
She needs a doctor not a jail

341
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,196
-But, Monsieur Mayor
-Can this be?

342
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:22,469
Where will she end
This child without a friend?

343
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,633
I've seen your face before

344
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,635
Show me some way to help you

345
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,595
How have you come to grief

346
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,673
In such a place as this

347
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,397
Monsieur, don't mock me now, I pray

348
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,110
It's hard enough I've lost my pride

349
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,553
You let your foreman send me away

350
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,394
Yes, you were there and turned aside

351
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,512
I never did no wrong

352
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,875
Is it true, what I've done...

353
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,316
My daughter's close to dying

354
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,789
... to an innocent soul?

355
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,556
-If there's a God above...
-Had I only known then

356
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:38,193
...he'd let me die instead

357
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,432
In his name my task has just begun

358
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,872
I will see it done

359
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,949
But, Monsieur Mayor!

360
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,632
Take her to the hospital

361
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,153
But, Monsieur Mayor!

362
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,277
I will see it done!

363
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,237
Can this be true?

364
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,709
I don't believe what I see!

365
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,915
A man your age
To be as strong as you are!

366
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,511
A memory stirs

367
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,068
You make me think of a man

368
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,952
from years ago

369
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,395
A man who broke his parole

370
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,993
He disappeared

371
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,198
Forgive me, sir!
I would not dare

372
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,514
Say what you must
Don't leave it there

373
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,311
I have only known one other
who can do what you have done

374
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,871
He's a convict from the chain gang
He's been 10 years on the run

375
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,511
But he couldn't run forever
We have found his hideaway

376
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,355
And he's just been re-arrested
And he comes to court today

377
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,911
Well, of course, he now denies it
You'd expect that of a con

378
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,599
But he couldn't run forever
No, not even Jean Valjean!

379
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,393
You say this man denies it all

380
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,995
And gives no sign of understanding
or repentance

381
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,433
You say this man is going to trial

382
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,671
And that he's sure to be returned
to serve his sentence

383
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,515
Come to that, can you be sure

384
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,751
that I am not your man?

385
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,835
I have known the thief for ages
Tracked him down through thick and thin

386
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,755
And to make the matter certain
There's the brand upon his skin

387
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,434
He will bend
He will break

388
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,751
This time there is no mistake!

389
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,076
He thought that man was me
without a second glance

390
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,789
This stranger he has found
This man could be my chance

391
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,873
Why should I save his hide?
Why should I right this wrong?

392
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,599
When I have come so far
and struggled for so long?

393
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,598
If I speak, I am condemned

394
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,994
If I stay silent

395
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,950
I am damned!

396
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,113
I am the master of hundreds of workers
They all look to me

397
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,715
Can I abandon them?

398
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,837
How will they live
If I am not free?

399
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,234
If I speak, they are condemned

400
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,277
If I stay silent, I am damned

401
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,157
Who am I?

402
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,674
Can I condemn this man to slavery?

403
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,559
Pretend I do not feel his agony?

404
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,869
This innocent who wears my face
Who goes to judgement in my place

405
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,313
Who am I?

406
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,274
Can I conceal myself for evermore?

407
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,717
Pretend I'm not the man I was before?

408
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,635
And must my name until I die
Be no more than an alibi?

409
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,759
Must I lie?
How can I ever face my fellow men?

410
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,197
How can I ever face myself again?

411
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,998
My soul belongs to God, I know
I made that bargain long ago

412
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,789
He gave me hope when hope was gone

413
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,079
He gave me strength to journey on

414
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,991
Who am I?

415
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,679
Who am I?

416
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,548
I'm Jean Valjean!

417
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,309
And so, Javert, you see it's true

418
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,999
This man bears no more guilt than you

419
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,869
Who am I?

420
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,838

Cosette, it's past your bed time

424
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,199
You've played the day away

And soon it will be night

Cosette, the light is fading

Don't you hear the winter wind is crying?

429
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,598
There's a darkness
which comes without a warning

430
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,632
But I will sing you lullabies
and wake you in the morning

Oh, Fantine, our time is running out

432
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,477
But, Fantine, I swear this on my life

433
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:37,078
Look, monsieur, where all the children play!

434
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,991
Be at peace!

435
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,873
Be at peace ever more

-Shall live in my protection

-Take her now!
-Your child will want for nothing

Good monsieur
You come from God in heaven

00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,995
And none will ever harm Cosette
as long as I am living

Then I will keep you warm

Take my child

444
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,396
I give her to your keeping

445
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,392
Take shelter from the storm

446
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:33,874
For God's sake
please stay till I am sleeping

447
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,077
And tell Cosette I love her

448
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,998
and I'll see her when I wake

Valjean, at last
We see each other plain!

Monsieur Ie Mayor
You'll wear a different chain!

451
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,230
Before you say another word, Javert
Before you chain me up like a slave again

452
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,551
Listen to me! There is something I must do

453
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,870
This woman leaves behind a suffering child

454
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,554
There is none but me who can intercede

455
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,076
In mercy's name, three days are all I need

456
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,355
Then I'll return, I pledge my word
Then I'll return

457
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,672
You must think me mad!
I've hunted you across the years

-No, 24601!

-Dare you talk to me of crime

-And the price you had to pay

512
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,875
(ANGRILY) Enough of that

513
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,758
(SOFTLY) or I'll forget to be nice!

514
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,193
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

515
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,398
You heard me ask for something
And I never ask twice

516
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,434
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

517
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,079
My band of soaks
My den of dissolutes

518
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,470
My dirty jokes
My always pissed as newts

519
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:44,196
My sons of whores
Spend their lives in my inn

520
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,397
Homing pigeons homing in

521
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,110
They fly through my doors

522
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,435
And their money's as good as yours

523
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,150
Welcome, monsieur!
Sit yourself down

524
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,630
And meet the best innkeeper in town

525
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,277
As for the rest
All of them crooks

526
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,716
Rooking the guests
and cooking the books

527
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,909
Seldom do you see

528
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,320
Honest men like me!

529
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,960
A gent of good intent

530
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,277
Who's content to be

531
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,518
Master of the House!
Doling out the charm

532
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,398
Ready with a handshake
and an open palm

533
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,313
Tells a saucy tale
Creates a little stir

534
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,039
Customers appreciate a bon-viveur

535
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,958
Glad to do a friend a favor!

536
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,679
Doesn't cost me to be nice

537
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,550
But nothing gets you nothing
Everything has got a little price!

538
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,358
Master of the House!
Keeper of the zoo!

539
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,318
Ready to relieve them
of a sou or two

540
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,153
Watering the wine
Making up the weight

541
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,038
Picking up their knick-knacks
When they can't see straight

542
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,513
Everybody loves a landlord
Everybody's bosom friend!

543
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,990
I do whatever pleases
Jesus! Won't I bleed 'em in the end!

544
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,069
(LAUGHS)

545
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,879
Master of the House!
Quick to catch yer eye!

546
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,633
Never wants a passer-by
to pass him by!

547
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,359
Servant to the poor
Butler to the great

548
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,273
Comforter, philosopher and life-long mate!

549
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,952
Everybody's boon companion!
Everybody's chaperone!

550
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:33,993
But lock up your valises
Jesus! Won't I skin you to the bone!

551
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,677
Enter, monsieur
Lay down yer load

552
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,752
Unlace yer boots
Rest from the road

553
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,790
This weighs a ton!
Travel's a curse

554
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,555
But here we strive
to lighten your purse

555
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,271
Here the goose is cooked!

556
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,874
Here the fat is fried!

557
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,398
And nothing's overlooked till I'm satisfied

558
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,951
Food beyond compare!
Food beyond belief!

559
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,474
Mix it in a mincer and pretend it's beef

560
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,639
Kidney of a horse
Liver of a cat

561
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,188
Filling up the sausages with this and that!

562
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,278
Residents are more than welcome!

563
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,999
Bridal suite is occupied!

564
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,636
Reasonable charges
Plus some little extras on the side!

565
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,829
Here we go

566
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,718
Charge them for the lice
Extra for the mice

567
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,598
Two percent for looking
in the mirror twice

568
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,433
Here a little slice
There a little cut

569
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,318
Three per cent for sleeping
with the window shut!

570
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,520
When it comes to fixing prices
There are lots of tricks he knows!

571
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,993
How it all increases!
All them bits and pieces!

572
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,918
Jesus! It's amazing how it grows!

573
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,798
Master of the House!
Quick to catch yer eye!

574
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,633
Never wants a passer-by
to pass him by!

575
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,439
Servant to the poor
Butler to the great

576
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,353
Comforter, philosopher and life-long mate!

577

Everybody's boon companion
Gives them everything he's got

578
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,994
Dirty bunch of geezers
Jesus! What a sorry little lot!

579
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,551
I used to dream
that I would meet a prince

580
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,753
But, God almighty, have you seen
what's happened since?

581
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,592
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

582
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,553
"Master of the House"
isn't worth my spit!

583
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,878
Comforter, philosopher, and life-long shit!

584
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,073
Cunning little brain
Regular Voltaire!

585
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,312
Thinks he's quite a lover
But there's not much there

586
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,794
What a cruel trick of nature
Landed me with such a louse!

587
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,158
God knows how I've lasted
living with this bastard in the house!

588
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,073
-Master of the House!
-Master and a half!

589
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,998
-Comforter, philosopher!
-Don't make me laugh!

00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,674
Servant to the poor
Butler to the great

591
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,638
Hypocrite, and toady, and inebriate

592
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,158
Everybody bless the landlord!
Everybody bless his spouse!

593
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,272
Everybody raise a glass!

595
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,152
Raise it up the master's arse!

(ALL LAUGH)

597
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,035
Everybody raise a glass
to the Master of the House!

(CHEERING)

600
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,394
(SINGING)
I found her wandering in the woods

601
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,515
This is her child

602
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,353
I found her trembling in the shadows

603
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,839
And I am here to help Cosette

604
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,793
And I will settle any debt
you may think proper

605
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,715
I will pay what I must pay

606
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,873
to take Cosette away

607
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,039
What to do?
What to say?

608
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,669
Shall you carry our treasure away?

609
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,833
What a gem!
What a pearl!

610
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,310
Beyond rubies is our little girl!

611
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,439
How can we speak of debt?

612
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,115
Let's not haggle for darling Colette!

613
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,395
-(SOFTLY) Cosette!
-Cosette!

614
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,598
Dear Fantine, gone to rest

615
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,275
Have we done for her child what is best?

616
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:05,353
Shared our bread, haven't we?
Shared each bone

617
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:12,073
We treated her like she's one of our own!
Like our own, monsieur!

618
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,554
Your feelings do you credit, sir
I will ease the parting blow

619
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:23,189
Let us not talk of bargains
or bones or greed

620
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,199
Now, may I say we are agreed?

621
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,637
That would quite fit the bill

622
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,548
if she hadn't so often been ill

623
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,155
Little dear, cost us dear!

624
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:43,199
Medicines are expensive, monsieur

625
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,034
Not that we'd begrudge a sou

626
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:52,114
It's no more than we Christians must do!

627
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,993
One thing more
One small doubt!

628
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,595
There are treacherous people about!

629
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,431
No offense!
Please reflect

630
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:11,073
Your intentions may not be correct

631
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,516
No more words!
Here's your price

632
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,036
1, 500 for your sacrifice

633
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,631
Come, Cosette, say goodbye!

634
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,556
Let us seek out some friendlier sky

635
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,555
Thank you both for Cosette

636
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,509
It won't take you too long to forget

(INDISTINCT)

638
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:03,840
Look down and see the beggars at your feet!

639
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,199
Look down and show
some mercy if you can!

640
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,513
Look down and see
the sweepings of the street!

641
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:20,118
Look down, look down
upon your fellow man!

642
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,668
How do you do?
My name's Gavroche!

643
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,320
These are my people
Here's my patch

644
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,834
Not much to look at
Nothing posh

645
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,673
Nothing that you'd call up to scratch

646
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,354
This is my school, my high society!

647
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,034
Here in the slums of Saint Michel

648
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,759
We live on crumbs of humble piety

649
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,400
Tough on the teeth, but what the hell!

650
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,153
Think you're poor?
Think you're free?

651
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,390
Follow me! Follow me!

652
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,793
Look down and show
some mercy if you can!

653
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:57,477
Look down, look down
upon your fellow man!

654
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,120
What you think yer at?
Hanging round me pitch

655
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,714
If you're new around here, girl
You've got a lot to learn

656
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,314
Listen, you old bat
Crazy bloody witch

657
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,914
Least I give my customers
some pleasure in return

658
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,514
I know what you give
You give them all the pox

659
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,160
You spread around your poison
till they end up in a box

660
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,879
Leave the poor old cow
Move it, Madeleine

661
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,599
She used to be no better
till the clap got to her brain

662
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,274
When's it gonna end?
When we gonna live?

663
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,590
-Something's gotta happen now
-MAN: Or something's gonna give

664
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,753
It'll come, it'll come, it'll come
It'll come, it'll come, it'll come

665
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:33,153
Where are the leaders of the land?
Where are the swells who run this show?

666
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:38,394
Only one man, and that's Lamarque
speaks for these people here below

667
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,074
See our children fed!
Help us in our shame!

668
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,355
Something for a crust of bread
in holy Jesus' name!

669
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,432
In the Lord's holy name
In his name, in his name, in his name

670
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:51,753
Lamarque is ill and fading fast
Won't last a week out, so they say

671
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,874
With all the anger in the land
How long before the judgement day?

672
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,750
Before we cut the fat ones down to size?

673
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:09,078
Before the barricades arise?

674
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,028
Watch out for old Thénardier!
All of his family's on the make

675
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:21,319
Once ran a hash-house down the way
Bit of a swine and no mistake

676
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,960
He's got a gang
The bleeding layabout

677
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,508
Even his daughter does her share

678
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:31,799
That's Éponine, she knows her way about
Only a kid, but hard to scare!

679
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,474
Do we care?
Not a cuss!

680
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,915
Long live us!
Long live us!

681
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,154
Look down and show
some mercy if you can!

682
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,473
Look down, look down
upon your fellow man!

683
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:54,314
Here's the old boy!
Stay on the job and watch out for the law!

684
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,789
-Stay out of this!
-But, Éponine...

685
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:01,550
You'll be in trouble here!
It's not your concern, you'll be in the clear

686
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,114
-Who is that man?
-Leave me alone!

687
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,395
Why is he here?
Hey, Éponine!

688
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,550
I didn't see you there, forgive me

689
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:28,192
Please, monsieur, come this way

690
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,239
Here's a child what ain't eaten today

691
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:36,154
Save a life
Spare a sou!

692
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,755
God rewards all the good that you do

693
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,836
Wait a bit!
Know that face!

694
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,956
Ain't the world a remarkable place?

695
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,953
Men like me don't forget

696
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,396
You're the bastard who borrowed Cosette!

697
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,472
What is this?
Are you mad?

698
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,710
No, monsieur, you don't know what you do!

699
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,712
You know me, you know me!
I'm a con, just like you

700
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,314
It's the police! Disappear!
Run for it!

701
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:12,157
It's Javert!

702
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,673
Another brawl in the square!
Another stink in the air!

703
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,228
Was there a witness to this?
Well, let him speak to Javert!

704
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,788
Monsieur, the streets are not safe
But let these vermin beware

705
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,632
We'll see that justice is done!

706
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,349
Look upon this fine collection
crawled from underneath a stone

707
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:36,595
This swarm of worms and maggots
could have picked you to the bone!

708
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,353
I know this man over here
I know his name and his trade

709
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,352
And on your witness, monsieur
I'll see him suitably paid

710
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,874
But where's the gentleman gone?
And why on earth did he run?

711
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,995
You will have a job to catch him!
He's the one you should arrest!

712
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:58,430
No more bourgeois when you scratch him
than that brand upon his chest!

713
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:03,674
Could it be he's some old jailbird
that the tide now washes in?

714
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,880
Heard my name and started running
Had the brand upon his skin

715
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:14,114
And the girl who stood beside him
When I turned they both had gone

716
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:19,558
Could he be the man I've hunted?
Could it be he's Jean Valjean?

717

(CLEARS THROAT)

In the absence of a victim

719
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,958
Dear Inspector, may I go?

720
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,190
And remember when you've nicked him

721
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:39,832
It was me wot told you so!

722
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,316
Let the old man keep on running

723
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:51,509
I will run him off his feet!

724
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,951
Everyone about your business
Clear this garbage off the street!

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

726
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:22,156
There, out in the darkness

727
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,072
A fugitive running

728
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,792
Fallen from God

729
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,239
Fallen from grace

730
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,197
God, be my witness!

731
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:43,037
I never shall yield
till we come face to face

732
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,834
Till we come face to face

00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,952
He knows his way in the dark

734
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,589
Mine is the way of the Lord

735
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,195
Those who follow the path
of the righteous

736
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,273
shall have their reward

737
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,273
And if they fall, as Lucifer fell

738

The sword!

Scarce to be counted

Filling the darkness

742
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,073
With order and light

743
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,549
You are the sentinels

Keeping watch in the night

746
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,637
You know your place in the sky
You hold your course and your aim!

747
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,793
And each in your season
returns and returns

748
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,634
And is always the same

749
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,679
And if you fall, as Lucifer fell

750
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,311
You fall in flames!

01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:10,474

On the doorway to Paradise

753
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:17,628
That those who falter and those who fall

754
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:22,589
Must pay the price!

755
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,155
Lord, let me find him

that I may see him safe behind bars!

But it's me who runs this town!

Students, workers, everyone!
There's a river on the run!

769

Like the flowing of the tide
Paris coming to our side!

770
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,836
The time is near

771
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,595
So near it's stirring the blood in their veins

772

And yet beware!

Don't let the wine go to your brains

For the army we fight is a dangerous foe

With the men and the arms
that we never can match

776
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,912
It is easy to sit here and swat them like flies

777
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,197
But the National Guard
will be harder to catch

778
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:43,829
We need a sign to rally the people

To bring them in line

Some wine, and say what's going on!

to a night at the opera now?

Have you asked of yourselves
what's the price you might pay?

Will you give all you can give
so that our banner may advance?

851
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:38,555
Some will fall and some will live
Will you stand up and take your chance?

852
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,636
The blood of the martyrs
will water the meadows of France!

853
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:48,953
Do you hear the people sing?
Singing the song of angry men?

854
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:54,194
It is the music of a people
who will not be slaves again!

855
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:59,434
When the beating of your heart
echoes the beating of the drums

856
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:05,390
There is a life about to start
when tomorrow comes

857
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,471
(MEN SHOUTING)

858
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:39,715
How strange, this feeling
that my life's begun at last

859
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:46,310
This change!
Can people really fall in love so fast?

860
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:51,312
What's the matter with you, Cosette?

861
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,153
Have you been too much on your own?

862
01:09:54,240 --> 01:10:01,157
So many things unclear
So many things unknown

863
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,033
In my life

864
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:12,195
There are so many questions and answers
that somehow seem wrong

865
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,759
In my life

866
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:19,517
There are times when I catch in the silence
the sigh of a far away song

867
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:24,230
And it sings of a world that I long to see

868
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:30,839
Out of reach, just a whisper away
Waiting for me!

869
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,232
Does he know I'm alive?
Do I know if he's real?

870
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:40,792
Did he see what I see?
Does he feel what I feel?

871
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,553
In my life

872
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:49,875
I'm no longer alone
now the love in my life is so near

873
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,916
Find me now!

874
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,152
Find me here!

875
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:03,474
Dear Cosette
You're such a lonely child

876
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:07,678
How pensive
How sad you seem to me

877
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:14,393
Believe me, were it within my power
I'd fill each passing hour

878
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:18,758
How quiet it must be, I can see

879
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,913
With only me for company

880
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,668
There's so little I know
that I'm longing to know

881
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,639
Of the child that I was
in a time long ago

882
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,672
There's so little you say
of the life you have known

883
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,116
Why you keep to yourself
Why we're always alone

884
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:40,749
So dark, so dark and deep

885
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:45,277
The secrets that you keep

886
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,234
In my life

887
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:54,395
I'm no longer a child
and I yearn for the truth that you know

888
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:59,952
Of the years, years ago!

889
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,156
You will learn!

890
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:08,759
Truth is given by God to us all
in our time, in our turn!

891
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,715
In my life

892
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:26,477
She has burst like the music of angels
The light of the sun!

893
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,348
And my life seems to stop
as if something is over

894
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:33,352
And something has scarcely begun!

895
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,319
Éponine, you're the friend
who has brought me here

896
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:42,793
Thanks to you, I am one with the Gods
and heaven is near!

897
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,433
And I soar through a world
that is new, that is free!

898
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:52,036
Every word that he says is a dagger in me!

899
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,238
In my life

900
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,471
There's been no one like him anywhere

901
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,917
Anywhere, where he is

902
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,155
If he asked, I'd be his!

903
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,993
In my life

904
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,834
There is someone who touches my life

905
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,514
Waiting near!

906
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:24,072
Waiting here!

907
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:36,553
A heart full of love!

908
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:41,150
A heart full of song!

909
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:44,312
I'm doing everything all wrong!

910
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,595
Oh, God, for shame!

911
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:50,036
I do not even know your name

912
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:53,271
Dear mademoiselle

913
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:58,150
Won't you say?
Will you tell?

914
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:03,400
A heart full of love!

915
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,559
No fear, no regret!

916
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:10,996
My name is Marius Pontmercy

917
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,310
And mine's Cosette

918
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,278
Cosette! I don't know what to say

919
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,436
Then make no sound

920
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,637
I am lost!

921
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,312
I am found!

922
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:30,269
A heart full of light!

923
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:34,478
A night bright as day!

924
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,518
And you must never go away

925
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,955
Cosette, Cosette!

926
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:44,556
This is a chain we'll never break

927
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,590
Do I dream?

928
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:56,313
-I'm awake
-A heart full of love!

929
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:02,276
-He was never mine to lose
-A heart full of you!

930
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:06,239
-Why regret what could not be?
-A single look and then I knew!

931
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:12,953
-I knew it, too!
-These are words he'll never say

932
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,751
-Not to me
-From today...

933
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,116
Not to me! Not for me

934
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,633
Every day

935
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:29,159
-For it isn't a dream
-ÉPONINE: His heart full of love

936
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:34,795
-Not a dream
-He will never

937
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:41,797
-After all!
-Feel this way

938
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,631
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

939
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,675
(SINGING) This is his lair!
I've seen the old fox around

940
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,035
He keeps himself to himself
He's staying close to the ground

941
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,998
I smell profit here!

942
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,275
Ten years ago
He came and paid for Cosette

943
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,874
I let her go for a song
It's time we settled the debt

944
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,030
This'll cost him dear!

945
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:22,319
What do I care who you should rob?
Gimme my share! Finish the job!

946
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,834
You shut your mouth!
You'll get what's yours!

947
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,353
CLAQUESOUS: What have we here?

948
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,919
Who is this hussy?

949
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,798
It's your brat Éponine!
Don't you know your own kid?

950
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,350
Why's she hanging about you?

951
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:37,079
Éponine, get on home!
You're not needed in this

952
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,390
We're enough here without you

953
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:45,680
I know this house, I tell you!
There's nothing here for you!

954
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,911
Just the old man and the girl

955
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,471
They live ordinary lives

956
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,073
Don't interfere! You've got some gall!

957
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,674
Take care, young miss
You've got a lot to say!

958
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,591
-She's going soft!
-Happens to all!

959
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,752
Go home, 'Ponine!
Go home, you're in the way!

960
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,910
I'm gonna scream
I'm gonna warn them here!

961
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,197
One little scream
and you'll regret it for a year!

962
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,469
(SCREAMING)

963
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:16,475
Make for the sewers! Get underground!
Leave her to me! Don't wait around!

964
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,915
You wait my girl! You'll rue this night!

965
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,594
I'll make you scream!
You'll scream alright!

966
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,955
It was your cry sent them away

967
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,395
Once more 'Ponine, saving the day!

968
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,914
Dearest Cosette
My friend 'Ponine

969
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,355
Brought me to you
Showed me the way!

970
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,908
Someone is near!
Let's not be seen!

971
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:37,077
Somebody's here!

972
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:43,958
My God, Cosette!
I heard a cry in the dark

973
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:47,032
I heard the shout of angry voices
in the street

974
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,510
That was my cry you heard, Papa

975
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,637
I was afraid of what they'd do

976
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:57,235
They ran away when they heard my cry

977
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,791
Cosette, my child
What will become of you?

978
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,311
Three men I saw beyond the wall

979
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,916
Three men in shadow moving fast!

980
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,152
This is a warning to us all!

981
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:20,314
These are the shadows of the past!

982
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,637
Must be Javert
He's found my cover at last

983
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,792
I've got to get Cosette away
before they return!

984
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,957
We must get away from
shadows that will never let us be

985
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:35,350
Tomorrow to Calais
And then a ship across the sea

986
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,430
Hurry, Cosette!
Prepare to leave and say no more

987
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,795
Tomorrow we'll away!

988
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,950
Hurry, Cosette!
It's time to close another door

989
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,474
And live another day!

990
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,395
One day more!

991
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,754
Another day, another destiny

992
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,717
This never-ending road to Calvary

993
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,828
These men who seem to know my crime
will surely come a second time

994
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:30,916
-One day more!
-I did not live until today

995
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:37,514
How can I live when we are parted?

996
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,953
One day more!

997
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:45,434
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away

998
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:50,992
And yet with you my world has started!

999
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:55,716
One more day all on my own

1000
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:58,837
Will we ever meet again?

1001
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,753
One more day with him not caring

1002
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,877
I was born to be with you!

1003
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,077
What a life I might have known

1004
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:11,197
And I swear I will be true!

1005
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:18,072
But he never saw me there!

1006
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,833
One more day before the storm!

1007
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,718
Do I follow where she goes?

1008
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,400
At the barricades of freedom!

1009
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,835
MARIUS: Shall I join my brothers there?

1010
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,718
ENJOLRAS: When our ranks begin to form

1011
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,439
Do I stay, and do I dare?

1012
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:39,751
Will you take your place with me?

1013
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:45,949
ALL: The time is now! The day is here!

1014
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,439
One day more!

1015
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:52,674
One more day to revolution
We will nip it in the bud

1016
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:56,799
We'll be ready for these schoolboys
They will wet themselves with blood!

1017
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,995
One day more!

1018
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,469
Watch 'em run amuck
Catch 'em as they fall

1019
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,120
Never know your luck
when there's a free-for-all

1020
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,589
Here a little dip
There a little touch

1021
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:08,478
Most of them are goners
So they won't miss much!

1022
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:13,714
One day to a new beginning!
Raise the flag of freedom high!

1023
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:18,874
Every man will be a king!
Every man will be a king!

1024
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:24,239
There's a new world for the winning!
There's a new world to be won!

1025
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,232
Do you hear the people sing?

1026
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:34,237
My place is here! I fight with you!

1027
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,629
One day more!

1028
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:39,553
I did not live until today

1029
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,359
-I will follow where they go
-One more day on my own

1030
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:46,353
I will learn their little secrets
I will know the things they know

1031
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,634
One day more!

1032
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:50,188
-One more day to revolution
-Tomorrow you'll be worlds away

1033
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,840
Never know your luck
When there's a free-for-all

1034
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,911
We'll be ready for these schoolboys

1035
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,310
Tomorrow we'll be far away
Tomorrow is the judgement day

1036
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:05,317
Tomorrow we'll discover
what our God in heaven has in store

1037
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,994
One more dawn!

1038
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,992
One more day!

1039
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:17,997
One day more!

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

1044
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:11,352
(SINGING) Here upon these stones
we will build our barricade

1045
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,432
In the heart of the city
we claim as our own

1046
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,750
Each man to his duty
and don't be afraid!

1047
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:20,276
Wait! I will need a report
on the strength of the foe

1048
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,751
I can find out the truth!
I know their ways

1049
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:28,879
Fought their wars
Served my time

1050
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,748
In the days of my youth

1051
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:37,112
Hey, little boy, what's this I see?
God, Éponine, the things you do!

1052
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:42,035
I know this is no place for me
Still I would rather be with you!

1053
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,598
Get out before the trouble starts!
Get out, 'Ponine, you might get shot!

1054
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:51,800
I got you worried now, I have!
That shows you like me quite a lot

1055
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:56,112
There is a way that you can help
You are the answer to a prayer!

1056
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:00,079
Please take this letter to Cosette
and pray to God that she's still there!

1057
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:05,029
Little you know!

1058
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:10,069
Little you care!

1059
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:31,630
I have a letter, monsieur
It's addressed to your daughter Cosette

1060
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:37,479
It's from a boy at the barricade, sir
In the Rue de Valette

1061
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,115
Give me that letter here, my boy

1062
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:45,438
He said to give it to Cosette

1063
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,670
You have my word that
my daughter will know

1064
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,955
what this letter contains

1065
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,554
Tell the young man
she will read it tomorrow

1066
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,631
and here's for your pains

1067
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,278
Go careful now
Stay out of sight

1068
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,439
There's danger in the streets tonight

1069
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,594
Dearest Cosette

1070
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:21,559
You have entered my soul
and soon you will be gone

1071
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:25,713
Can it be only a day since we met
and the world was reborn?

1072
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:30,358
If I should fall in the battle to come
let this be my goodbye

1073
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,671
Now that I know that
you love me as well

1074
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,149
it is harder to die

1075
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:41,674
I pray that God will bring me home
to be with you

1076
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,917
Pray for your Marius

1077
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,152
He prays for you

1078
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:09,270
And now I'm all alone again
Nowhere to turn, no one to go to

1079
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:14,115
Without a home, without a friend
Without a face to say hello to

1080
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,714
And now the night is near

1081
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:22,113
Now I can make believe he's here

1082
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:29,589
Sometimes I walk alone at night
when everybody else is sleeping

1083
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:35,152
I think of him and then I'm happy
with the company I'm keeping

1084
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:38,835
The city goes to bed

1085
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:43,232
and I can live inside

1086
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:48,149
my head!

1087
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,873
On my own

1088
01:27:55,960 --> 01:28:00,431
Pretending he's beside me

1089
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:08,197
All alone I walk with him till morning

1090
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:16,349
Without him, I feel his arms around me

1091
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:19,671
And when I lose my way
I close my eyes

1092
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,558
and he has found me

1093
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:25,878
In the rain

1094
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:30,556
the pavement shines like silver

1095
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:37,468
All the lights are misty in the river

1096
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:44,869
In the darkness
the trees are full of starlight

1097
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:51,149
And all I see is him and me
forever and forever!

1098
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:57,679
And I know it's only in my mind

1099
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:03,551
That I'm talking to myself
and not to him

1100
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:09,909
And although I know that he is blind

1101
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:16,519
Still I say there's a way for us

1102
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:21,833
I love him, but when the night is over

1103
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:27,040
He is gone
The river's just a river

1104
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:33,349
Without him
the world around me changes

1105
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:39,595
The trees are bare and everywhere
the streets are full of strangers

1106
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:46,028
I love him, but every day I'm learning

1107
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:53,071
All my life, I've only been pretending

1108
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:58,638
Without me, his world will go on turning

1109
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:05,671
A world that's full of happiness
that I have never known

1110
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:14,077
I love him

1111
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,312
I love him

1112
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:23,359
I love him

1113
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:27,558
But only

1114
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:35,917
on my own

1115
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,071
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1116
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,636
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

1117
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,673
ALL: (SINGING) Now we pledge ourselves
to hold this barricade!

1118
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,594
Let them come in their legions
and they will be met

1119
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:56,396
Have faith in yourselves
and do not be afraid

1120
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,835
Let's give 'em a screwing
they'll never forget!

1121
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,596
This is where it begins

1122
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:05,236
And if I should die in the fight to be free

1123
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:08,630
Where the fighting is hardest
there will I be

1124
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:11,996
Let them come if they dare

1125
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:17,757
We'll be there!

1126
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,034
He's back!

1127
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,235
Listen, my friends
I have done as I said

1128
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,959
I have been to their lines
I have counted each man

1129
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:31,237
I will tell what I can

1130
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,030
Better be warned
They have armies to spare

1131
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,348
and our danger is real

1132
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:42,036
We will need all our cunning
to bring them to heel!

1133
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,718
Have faith!

1134
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,997
If you know what their movements are
we'll spoil their game

1135
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,469
There are ways that our people can fight

1136
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:56,475
We shall overcome their power!

1137
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:00,269
I overheard their plans
There will be no attack tonight

1138
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:04,194
They intend to starve us out
before they start a proper fight

1139
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:08,478
Concentrate their force
Hit us from the right

1140
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,198
Liar!

1141
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:14,752
(SINGING) Good evening, dear Inspector
Lovely evening, my dear!

1142
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:18,711
I know this man, my friends
His name's Inspector Javert!

1143
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:25,076
So don't believe a word he says
'cause none of it's true

1144
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:28,789
This only goes to show
what little people can do!

1145
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,594
Bravo, little Gavroche!
You're the top of the class!

1146
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:34,592
So what are we going to do
with this snake in the grass?

1147
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:37,314
Tie this man
and take him to the tavern in there!

1148
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,834
The people will decide your fate
Inspector Javert!

1149
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:44,550
Shoot me now or shoot me later
Every schoolboy to his sport!

1150
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:48,633
Death to each and every traitor!
I renounce your people's court!

1151
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,155
Take this man
Bring him through

1152
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,879
There is work we have to do

1153
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,916
There's a boy climbing the barricade!

1154
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:05,476
Good God! What are you doing?
'Ponine! Have you no fear?

1155
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:09,838
Have you seen my beloved?
Why have you come back here?

1156
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,835
Took the letter, like you said
I met her father at the door

1157
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:19,710
He said he would give it
I don't think I can stand any more

1158
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:24,875
Éponine, what's wrong?
There's something wet upon your hair

1159
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,520
Éponine, you're hurt!
You need some help!

1160
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,990
Oh, God, it's everywhere!

1161
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:37,833
Don't you fret, Monsieur Marius

1162
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:41,356
I don't feel any pain

1163
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:45,430
A little fall of rain

1164
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:50,312
can hardly hurt me now

1165
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:56,118
You're here
That's all I need to know

1166
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,917
And you will keep me safe

1167
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,475
And you will keep me close

1168
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:11,713
And rain will make the flowers grow

1169
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:18,391
But you will live 'Ponine
Dear God above!

1170
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:24,950
If I could close your wounds
with words of love

1171
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:30,078
Just hold me now, and let it be

1172
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:35,314
Shelter me
Comfort me

1173
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:43,554
You will live 100 years
if I could show you how

1174
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:47,629
I won't desert you now

1175
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,515
The rain can't hurt me now

1176
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:56,879
This rain will wash away what's past

1177
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,356
And you will keep me safe

1178
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:04,035
And you will keep me close

1179
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:10,355
I'll sleep in your embrace at last

1180
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:17,751
The rain that brings you here
is heaven blessed!

1181
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:25,031
The skies begin to clear
and I'm at rest

1182
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:29,998
A breath away from where you are

1183
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:34,392
I've come home from so far

1184
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,754
-So don't you fret, Monsieur Marius
-Hush-a-bye, dear Éponine

1185
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:46,356
-I don't feel any pain
-You won't feel any pain

1186
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:50,194
-A little fall of rain
-A little fall of rain

1187

He's standing in his grave!

1362
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:43,752
Take him, Valjean

1363
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:46,152
Before I change my mind!

1364
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:52,112
I will be waiting, 24601!

1365
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:04,631
Who is this man?
What sort of devil is he?

1366
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:07,188
To have me caught in a trap
and choose to let me go free?

1367
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:09,794
It was his hour at last
to put a seal on my fate!

1368
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:12,474
Wipe out the past
and wash me clean off the slate!

1369
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:14,835
All it would take
was a flick of his knife!

1370
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:19,755
Vengeance was his
and he gave me back my life!

1371
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:22,035
Damned if I live in the debt of a thief!

1372
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:24,475
Damned if I yield
at the end of the chase!

1373
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:28,838
I am the law, and the law is not mocked!
I'll spit his pity right back in his face!

1374
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:31,195
There is nothing on earth that we share!

1375
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:34,670
It is either Valjean or Javert!

1376
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,719
How can I now allow this man

1377
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:51,678
to hold dominion over me?

1378
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:55,797
This desperate man whom I have hunted

1379
01:58:56,200 --> 01:59:00,512
He gave me my life!
He gave me freedom!

1380
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:04,912
I should have perished by his hand

1381
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,874
It was his right

1382
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:10,749
It was my right to die as well

1383
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:17,275
Instead, I live, but live in hell

1384
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:21,317
And my thoughts fly apart

1385
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:24,711
Can this man be believed?

1386
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:28,755
Shall his sins be forgiven?

1387
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:33,470
Shall his crimes be reprieved?

1388
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:45,437
And must I now begin to doubt
who never doubted all these years?

1389
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:48,950
My heart is stone and still it trembles

1390
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:53,238
The world I have known
is lost in shadow

1391
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:59,793
Is he from heaven or from hell?
And does he know

1392
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:03,433
that, granting me my life today

1393
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:10,436
this man has killed me even so?

1394
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:16,273
I am reaching, but I fall

1395
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:22,276
And the stars are black and cold

1396
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:29,958
As I stare into the void
of a world that cannot hold

1397
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:36,997
I'll escape now from that world
From the world of Jean Valjean

1398
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:40,397
There is nowhere I can turn

1399
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:46,237
There is no way to go on

1400
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:57,391
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1401
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:30,835
(SINGING) Did you see them
going off to fight?

1402
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:36,040
Children of the barricade
that didn't last the night?

1403
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:41,194
They were school boys
Never held a gun

1404
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:45,796
Fighting for a new world
that would rise up like the sun

1405
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:53,272
Where's that new world
now the fighting's done?

1406
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:59,392
-Who will wake them?
-No one ever will

1407
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:05,591
No one ever told them
that a summer day can kill

1408
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:11,755
Same old story
What's the use of tears?

1409
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:17,631
What's the use of praying
if there's nobody who hears?

1410
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:20,632
Turning, turning

1411
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:27,671
Turning, turning, turning
through the years

1412
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:37,756
Turning, turning, turning
through the years

1413
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:42,470
Minutes into hours
and the hours into years

1414
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:47,236
Nothing changes, nothing ever can

1415
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:52,440
Rounding round the roundabout
and back where you began

1416
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:58,390
Round and round
and back where you began!

1417
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:14,511
There's a grief that can't be spoken

1418
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:19,712
There's a pain goes on and on

1419
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:24,515
Empty chairs at empty tables

1420
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:31,115
Now my friends are dead and gone

1421
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:36,272
Here they talked of revolution

1422
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:42,515
Here it was they lit the flame

1423
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:46,475
Here they sang about tomorrow

1424
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:52,716
And tomorrow never came

1425
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,630
From the table in the corner

1426
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:04,277
They could see a world reborn

1427
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:09,231
And they rose with voices ringing

1428
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:13,792
And I can hear them now!

1429
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:18,994
The very words that they had sung

1430
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:25,197
became their last communion

1431
02:04:27,600 --> 02:04:34,551
On the lonely barricade at dawn

1432
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:39,873
Oh, my friends, my friends, forgive me

1433
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:46,110
That I live and you are gone

1434
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:50,308
There's a grief that can't be spoken

1435
02:04:50,440 --> 02:04:56,231
There's a pain goes on and on

1436
02:04:56,360 --> 02:05:00,717
Phantom faces at the window!

1437
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:05,192
Phantom shadows on the floor!

1438
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:09,316
Empty chairs at empty tables

1439
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:15,555
Where my friends will meet no more

1440
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:21,871
Oh, my friends, my friends, don't ask me

1441
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:27,951
What your sacrifice was for

1442
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:33,198
Empty chairs at empty tables

1443
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:38,999
Where my friends will meet

1444
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:44,436
no more

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1446
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:26,430
(SINGING) Every day, you walk
with stronger step

1447
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:29,830
You walk with longer step
The worst is over

1448
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:32,275
Every day, I wonder, every day

1449
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:35,511
who it was brought me here
from the barricade

1450
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:37,397
Don't think about it, Marius!

1451
02:06:37,480 --> 02:06:40,995
With all the years ahead of us
I will never go away

1452
02:06:41,080 --> 02:06:45,392
and we will be together every day

1453
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:51,558
Every day

1454
02:06:52,240 --> 02:06:54,231
we'll remember that night

1455
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:58,673
and the vow that we made

1456
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:04,155
A heart full of love

1457
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:06,196
She was never mine to keep

1458
02:07:06,280 --> 02:07:09,989
A night full of you

1459
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:14,153
-She is youthful, she is free
-The words are old, but always true

1460
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:16,196
Cosette, Cosette!

1461
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:20,633
-Love is the garden of the young
-I saw you waiting and I knew

1462
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:23,188
Waiting for you

1463
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:26,033
-Let it be!
-At your feet!

1464
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:29,112
-Let it be!
-At your call!

1465
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:37,631
-And it wasn't a dream
-A heart full of love

1466
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:44,109
-Not a dream...
-This I give you...

1467
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:50,230
-...after all
-... this day

1468

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1469
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,833
(SINGING) Monsieur, this is a day
I never can forget

1470
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:15,953
Is gratitude enough
for giving me Cosette?

1471
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:20,152
Your home shall be with us
and not a day shall pass

1472
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:23,960
But we will prove our love
to you, whom we shall call

1473
02:08:24,040 --> 02:08:27,316
a father to us both
a father to us all

1474
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:33,075
Not another word, my son!

1475
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:38,393
There's something now that must be done

1476
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:52,590
There lived a man
whose name was Jean Valjean

1477
02:08:55,960 --> 02:09:00,112
He stole some bread
to save his sister's son

1478
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:06,709
For 19 winters served his time

1479
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:13,359
In sweat he washed away his crime!

1480
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:16,715
Years ago

1481
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:19,998
he broke parole
and lived a life apart

1482
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:23,638
How could he tell Cosette
and break her heart?

1483
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:28,509
It's for Cosette this must be faced
If he is caught, she is disgraced

1484
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:31,998
The time has come to journey on

1485
02:09:32,120 --> 02:09:37,274
and from this day he must be gone!

1486
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:40,269
Who am I?

1487
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:43,393
Who am I?

1488
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:47,553
You're Jean Valjean!

1489
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:53,188
What can I do to turn you from this?
Monsieur, you cannot leave

1490
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:56,750
Whatever I tell my beloved Cosette
she will never believe

1491
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:01,309
Make her believe
I have gone on a journey a long way away

1492
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:06,349
Tell her my heart was too full for farewells
It is better this way

1493
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:09,438
Promise me, monsieur
Cosette will never know

1494
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:11,392
I give my word

1495
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:15,075
What I have spoken, why I must go!

1496
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:21,436
For the sake of Cosette, it must be so

upon this day of days!

May all the angels
of the Lord above

1499
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:07,438
In jubilation sing their songs of praise

1500
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:13,556
And crown this blessed time
with peace and love!

wish to pay their respects to the groom!

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1503
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:45,319
I forget where we met

1504
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:48,159
Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge?

1505
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:52,190
Where the Duke did that puke

1506
02:11:52,280 --> 02:11:55,795
down the Duchess's decolletage?

1507
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:59,031
No, Baron de Thénard

1508
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:02,999
The circles I move in are humbler by far

1509
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:06,557
Go away, Thénardier

1510
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:10,197
Do you think I don't know who you are?

1511
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:14,389
He's not fooled!
Told you so!

1512
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:17,916
Show monsieur
what you've come here to show

1513
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,436
Tell the boy what you know!

1514
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:25,752
Pity to disturb you at a feast like this

1515
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:30,470
But 500 francs
surely wouldn't come amiss

1516
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:32,949
In God's name, say what you have to say!

1517
02:12:33,160 --> 02:12:35,833
But first you pay!

1518
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:45,399
What I saw, clear as light

1519
02:12:45,480 --> 02:12:48,790
Jean Valjean in the sewers that night

1520
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:55,838
Had this corpse on his back
hanging there like a bloody great sack

1521
02:12:56,120 --> 02:12:59,954
I was there, never fear!

1522
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:03,789
Even found me this fine souvenir!

1523
02:13:03,880 --> 02:13:07,236
I know this! This was mine!

1524
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:10,756
This is surely some heavenly sign!

1525
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:14,436
One thing more, mark this well

1526
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:18,030
It was the night that the barricade fell!

1527
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:21,677
Then it's true! Then I'm right!

1528
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:25,912
Jean Valjean was my savior that night!

1529
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,470
As for you, take this, too!

1530
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:32,677
God forgive us the things that we do!

1531
02:13:33,160 --> 02:13:36,789
Come, my love, come, Cosette

1532
02:13:36,920 --> 02:13:41,072
This day's blessings are not over yet!

1533
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:44,114
(LAUGHING)

1534
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:50,435
Ain't it a laugh?
Ain't it a treat?

1535
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:53,876
Hob-nobbin' here
among the elite?

1536
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:55,799
(VOCALIZING)

1537
02:13:56,240 --> 02:14:00,028
Here comes a prince
There goes a Jew

1538
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:03,635
This one's a queer
But what can you do?

1539
02:14:07,480 --> 02:14:10,836
Paris at my feet!

1540
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:14,239
Paris in the dust!

1541
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:20,429
And here's me, breaking bread
with the upper crust

1542
02:14:21,400 --> 02:14:23,960
Beggar at the feast!
Master of the dance!

1543
02:14:24,040 --> 02:14:26,713
Life is easy pickings
if you grab your chance

1544
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:29,598
Everywhere you go
law-abiding folk

1545
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:32,319
doing what is decent
but they're mostly broke!

1546
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:37,639
Singing to the Lord on Sundays
praying for the gifts he'll send

1547
02:14:37,720 --> 02:14:42,714
But we're the ones who take it
We're the ones who make it in the end!

1548
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:46,353
Watch the buggers dance!
Watch them till they drop!

1549
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:49,034
Keep your wits about you
And you stand on top!

1550
02:14:49,160 --> 02:14:52,038
Masters of the land!
Always get our share!

1551
02:14:52,120 --> 02:14:54,554
Clear away the barricades
and we're still there!

1552
02:14:54,840 --> 02:15:00,198
We know where the wind is blowing
Money is the stuff we smell

1553
02:15:00,280 --> 02:15:04,193
And when we're rich as Croesus
Jesus! Won't we see you all in hell?

1554
02:15:04,280 --> 02:15:05,838
(BOTH LAUGHING)

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1556
02:15:58,120 --> 02:16:01,908
(SINGING) Alone I wait in the shadows

1557
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,834
I count the hours till I can sleep

1558
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:09,629
I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by

1559
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:15,829
It made her weep to know I die

1560
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:21,834
Alone at the end of the day

1561
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:25,993
Upon this wedding night I pray

1562
02:16:26,080 --> 02:16:31,518
Take these children, my Lord
to thy embrace

1563
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:35,953
And show them grace

1564
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:51,598
God on high

1565
02:16:53,840 --> 02:17:00,188
Hear my prayer

1566
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:07,119
Take me now

1567
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:11,828
to thy care

1568
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:20,992
Where you are

1569
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:28,031
Let me be

1570
02:17:28,640 --> 02:17:35,113
Take me now!

1571
02:17:36,320 --> 02:17:41,997
Take me there!

1572
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:48,274
Bring me home!

1573
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:55,716
Bring me home!

1574
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:02,878
Monsieur, I bless your name

1575
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:05,428
I am ready, Fantine

1576
02:18:05,520 --> 02:18:09,559
Monsieur, lay down your burden

1577
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:12,399
At the end of my days

1578
02:18:12,480 --> 02:18:17,554
-You raised my child in love
-She's the best of my life

1579
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:22,839
And you will be with God

1580
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:31,879
Papa, papa, I do not understand!

1581
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,356
Are you alright?
They said you'd gone away!

1582
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:39,874
Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven now?

1583
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:43,032
Thank God, thank God
I lived to see this day!

1584
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:45,395
It's you who must forgive
a thoughtless fool!

1585
02:18:45,800 --> 02:18:49,509
It's you who must forgive
a thankless man!

1586
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:53,796
It's thanks to you that I am living

1587
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:57,391
and again I lay down my life
at your feet

1588
02:18:57,800 --> 02:19:00,758
Cosette, your father is a saint!

1589
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:06,435
When they wounded me
he took me from the barricade

1590
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:13,677
Carried like a babe
and brought me home to you!

1591
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:28,356
Now you are here

1592
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:36,038
again beside me

1593
02:19:39,080 --> 02:19:43,392
Now I can die in peace

1594
02:19:43,480 --> 02:19:49,510
for now my life is blessed

1595
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:55,317
You will live, papa, you're going to live!

1596
02:19:55,680 --> 02:20:01,118
It's too soon
too soon to say goodbye!

1597
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:06,430
Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die!

1598
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:10,631
I'll obey

1599
02:20:12,520 --> 02:20:14,192
I will try

1600
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:24,077
On this page
I write my last confession

1601
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:32,437
Read it well
when I, at last, am sleeping

1602
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:41,115
It's the story
of those who always loved you

1603
02:20:41,320 --> 02:20:46,599
Your mother gave her life for you
then gave you to my keeping

1604
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:51,273
Come with me

1605
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:56,394
where chains will never bind you

1606
02:20:57,240 --> 02:21:04,112
All your grief
at last, at last, behind you

1607
02:21:05,240 --> 02:21:08,232
Lord in heaven

1608
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:12,836
Look down on him in mercy

1609
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:18,040
Forgive me all my trespasses
and take me to your glory!

1610
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:23,117
Take my hand

1611
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:28,832
I lead you to salvation

1612
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:32,032
Take my love

1613
02:21:32,120 --> 02:21:37,433
For love is everlasting

1614
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:41,159
And remember

1615
02:21:41,240 --> 02:21:45,791
the truth that once was spoken

1616
02:21:45,960 --> 02:21:52,911
To love another person
is to see the face of God

1617
02:21:57,080 --> 02:22:02,950
CHOIR: Do you hear the people sing
lost in the valley of the night?

1618
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:09,189
It is the music of a people
who are climbing to the light

1619
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:15,435
For the wretched of the earth
there is a flame that never dies

1620
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:21,356
Even the darkest night will end
and the sun will rise

1621
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:27,834
They will live again in freedom
in the garden of the Lord

1622
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:33,677
They will walk behind the plough-share
They will put away the sword

1623
02:22:33,800 --> 02:22:38,590
The chain will be broken
and all men will have their reward

1624
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:44,751
Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?

1625
02:22:44,880 --> 02:22:50,557
Somewhere beyond the barricade
is there a world you long to see?

1626
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:56,158
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?

1627
02:22:56,240 --> 02:23:01,758
It is the future that they bring
when tomorrow comes!

1628
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:07,392
Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?

02:34:57,200 --> 02:35:00,078
Most of them are goners
So they won't miss much!

1707
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:05,359
One day to a new beginning!
Raise the flag of freedom high!

1708
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:10,798
Every man will be a king!
Every man will be a king!

1709
02:35:10,880 --> 02:35:15,954
There's a new world for the winning!
There's a new world to be won!

1710
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:18,628
Do you hear the people sing?

1711
02:35:19,160 --> 02:35:26,077
My place is here! I fight with you!

1712
02:35:26,400 --> 02:35:28,436
One day more!

1713
02:35:28,760 --> 02:35:31,399
I did not live until today

1714
02:35:31,480 --> 02:35:34,358
One more day on my own

1715
02:35:34,440 --> 02:35:37,398
How can I live when we are parted?

1716
02:35:37,960 --> 02:35:39,552
One day more!

1717
02:35:39,640 --> 02:35:42,518
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away!

1718
02:35:42,600 --> 02:35:44,716
Never know your luck
When there's a free-for-all

1719
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:47,030
And yet with you my world has started

1720
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:50,556
Tomorrow we'll be far away
Tomorrow is the judgement day

1721
02:35:50,680 --> 02:35:57,233
Tomorrow we'll discover
what our God in heaven has in store

1722
02:35:57,480 --> 02:36:00,313
One more dawn!

1723
02:36:00,400 --> 02:36:02,709
One more day!

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1726
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:19,950
Well, Les Miserables is 25 years young!

1727
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:26,029
What a remarkable evening.

1728
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:29,271
This is going to be one of
the greatest nights of my life.

1729
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:36,553
We are all very lucky to be here in front of
such an incredible, stellar, amazing cast.

1730
02:37:37,480 --> 02:37:39,277
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1731
02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:44,836
I realized, over the last few days,

1732
02:37:45,160 --> 02:37:47,310
seeing the original cast here,

1733
02:37:47,400 --> 02:37:50,073
the two wonderful London
companies at the moment,

1734
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:53,038
and our extraordinary cast tonight,

1735
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:55,190
that I've not only shared
Les Miserables with them,

1736
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:57,953
I've shared most of
my professional life with them.

1737
02:37:58,040 --> 02:38:02,192
And everyone, including the choir,
the ensemble, everyone,

1738
02:38:02,440 --> 02:38:05,273
they're all the stars of the West End

1739
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:09,835
that have kept the British
musical theatre thriving.

1740
02:38:16,440 --> 02:38:20,956
And they're here
for the same reason I'm here

1741
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:22,758
and the same reason you're here.

1742
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:27,152
We love Les Miserables. There's something
extraordinary about this musical.

1743
02:38:28,320 --> 02:38:32,029
And ever since it opened,
25 years ago, at the Barbican

1744
02:38:32,120 --> 02:38:35,908
it is you, the public, that have grasped it

1745
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:39,436
and embraced it in the most personal way.
And that's how we all feel.

1746
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:42,239
I watched the second act backstage.

1747
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:45,517
It was as electrifying
as it was for you outside,

1748
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:48,637
just because the embrace between us,

1749
02:38:48,720 --> 02:38:53,271
and seeing everybody
just love this material so much,

1750
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:55,476
and love their fellow performers,

1751
02:38:55,560 --> 02:38:58,313
is something I have never
encountered in the theatre,

1752
02:38:58,400 --> 02:39:00,550
and I never will for the rest of my life.

1753
02:39:02,760 --> 02:39:07,993
The inspiration, of course,
belongs to Victor Hugo,

1754
02:39:08,400 --> 02:39:14,236
and Victor Hugo inspired two Frenchmen,
they had to be French, of course,

1755
02:39:14,320 --> 02:39:17,630
Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg,
to write the show,

1756
02:39:17,720 --> 02:39:20,598
with the wonderful, uplifting words
of Herbert Kretzmer.

1757
02:39:20,680 --> 02:39:23,638
Ladies and gentlemen,
the authors of Les Miserables.

1758

(ALL CHEERING)

1759
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:06,953
Just a few words
on such an emotional evening,

1760
02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:11,153
in front of such a huge and warm crowd.

1761
02:40:11,800 --> 02:40:17,238
I must remember that 32 years ago
I was asking myself one question.

1762
02:40:17,640 --> 02:40:21,474
Would Les Miserables make
a good subject for a musical?

1763
02:40:21,560 --> 02:40:23,278
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1764
02:40:23,480 --> 02:40:27,075
And I was unconscious enough
to think it was,

1765
02:40:27,160 --> 02:40:31,233
and Claude-Michel
crazy enough to agree with me.

1766
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:35,950
So tonight is a celebration of
obviously the genius of Victor Hugo,

1767
02:40:36,040 --> 02:40:40,556
of nearly 40 years of collaboration and
friendship between Claude-Michel and me,

1768

(ALL APPLAUDING)

1769
02:40:51,160 --> 02:40:55,950
and 27 years of collaboration and
friendship with Cameron Mackintosh.

1770
02:41:02,560 --> 02:41:08,351
It's also the celebration of incredible talents
that we met through Cameron.

1771
02:41:08,440 --> 02:41:13,753
Namely they are the people
who have helped him to reshape our work.

1772
02:41:13,840 --> 02:41:19,392
They are James Fenton,
Trevor Nunn, John Caird,

1773
02:41:19,480 --> 02:41:23,075
and master lyricist Herbert Kretzmer.

02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:42,431
Well, it's an evening...
It's hard to speak, but...

1776
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:46,792
An evening which I will remember
for all my life, obviously.

1777
02:41:46,880 --> 02:41:51,590
Seeing this company of companies
perform this night, this incredible evening,

1778
02:41:51,680 --> 02:41:57,949
and the 1985 evening, with whom
we share so many fond memories,

1779
02:41:58,040 --> 02:42:02,158
is something that we'II carry with us
for the rest of our lives.

1780
02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:05,710
I want to thank you, Cameron,
again, for making us

1781
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:09,196
such an incredible and overwhelming
birthday present.

1782
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:11,838
(ALL APPLAUDING)

1783
02:42:21,800 --> 02:42:23,631
It's an incredible evening for us.

1784
02:42:23,720 --> 02:42:28,271
We are privileged to attend such a concert.

1785
02:42:28,360 --> 02:42:31,079
But I am wondering
what we are doing here, really,

1786
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:35,039
because, generally, when you have
a tribute for a show like that

1787
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:38,556
it means that the authors,
they are dead for a long time.

1788
02:42:38,760 --> 02:42:40,273
(ALL LAUGHING)

1789
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:43,235
And we are still here.

1790
02:42:43,320 --> 02:42:45,834
And they are not very happy
every day, those two gents

1791
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:48,354
and Laurence, the director of the show,
that we are here

1792
02:42:48,440 --> 02:42:53,116
because we are always looking
what they are doing with our baby.

1793
02:42:53,200 --> 02:42:55,350
But anyway, as Alain said,

1794
02:42:56,280 --> 02:43:00,432
it's 40 years of brothership
between me and Alain,

1795
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:05,874
27 years of friendship
and collaboration with Cameron.

1796
02:43:05,960 --> 02:43:09,430
Sometimes it's easy,
sometimes it's very tough,

1797
02:43:09,520 --> 02:43:11,954
but it's always a lot of fun.

1798
02:43:12,120 --> 02:43:15,669
And I wish that it will last a very long time.

1799

that I'II be nearly 90 for the
50th anniversary. What shall I do?

(ALL LAUGHING)

1805
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:46,114
Now, in 2002,
it was Victor Hugo's bicentennial,

1806
02:43:46,360 --> 02:43:50,194
and we decided that
we would do a school's edition,

1807
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:53,272
so that under-19-year-olds
could perform the show.

1808
02:43:53,760 --> 02:43:56,035
They've been extraordinary doing it.

1809
02:43:56,120 --> 02:43:58,395
Hundreds and thousands of students

1810
02:43:58,480 --> 02:44:00,994
and tens of thousands
of productions have done it.

1811
02:44:01,560 --> 02:44:04,313
And now, here, just a few of them
are going to be here

1812
02:44:04,400 --> 02:44:07,790
to take part in our celebration
as we come to an end tonight.

1813

(SINGING) Do you hear the people sing
lost in the valley of the night?

02:44:28,160 --> 02:44:34,190
It is the music of a people
who are climbing to the light

1817

For the wretched of the earth
there is a flame that never dies

1818

Even the darkest night will end
and the sun will rise

1819

They will live again in freedom
in the garden of the Lord

1820
02:44:52,600 --> 02:44:58,311
They will walk behind the plough-share
They will put away the sword

1821
02:44:58,400 --> 02:45:03,315
The chain will be broken
and all men will have their reward
