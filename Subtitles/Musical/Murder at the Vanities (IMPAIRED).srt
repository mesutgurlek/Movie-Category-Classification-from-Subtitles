00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,606
Pardon me.

3
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,112
They call up at the last
minute and want tickets.
How can they do this?

4
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,780
Telegram, Mr. Ellery.
Give me.

5
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,948
I gotta take care of
the back of the stage.

6
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,973
Hello.

7
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,550
Telephone, Mr. Ellery,
Atlantic City.

8
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,886
The boss may be sick,
but he's not too sick
to keep us on the jump.

9
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,855
I got it. I got it. Hello,
hello. Yes, Mr. Carroll.

10
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,556
Yes, everything's all right.

11
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,291
Listen, will you
stop worrying?

12
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,495
Listen, Mr. Carroll,
your health is
worth more than that.

13
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,396
Well, listen, Mr. Carroll,
will you do me a favor?

14
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,764
Will you take your
arteries and go to bed

15
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,066
and forget about
the whole thing?

16
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,367
Yeah, yeah.
Goodbye. Goodbye.

17
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,393
Here. Put that...

18
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,637
They want you backstage,
Mr. Ellery.

19
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,938
Lander and Ware
haven't shown up yet.

20
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,107
Lander and Ware
haven't shown up. What am
I supposed to do here?

21
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,208
Go on and give
their performances?

22
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,943
Long distance,
Atlantic City calling.
You cut them off.

23
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,045
Listen, tell them I've died.
I can't be disturbed.

27
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,821
Lieutenant Murdock,
of the Homicide Squad.

28
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,789
MAN: Well, what's the matter?
MURDOCK: I want my tickets.

29
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,325
I'm sorry, Commissioner.
There's nothing for you.

30
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,520
What?
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,323
Where's Jack Ellery?

32
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,289
He's just gone backstage.

33
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,660
MURDOCK: Hey!

34
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,603
Hey, you.

35
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,207
Where're those tickets
you were going
to leave for me?

36
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,909
Gee, Bill,
I forgot all about them.

37
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,577
Yeah?
Well, remember them now.

38
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,445
I'm going to hustle
over to the Astor
to pick up Ethel.

39
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,948
Oh, listen, I couldn't
get a couple of tickets
for the White House.

40
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,849
Would you like to stand?
What?

41
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,286
With me all laid
out like a funeral
and a dame on my hands?

42
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,688
What are you beefing about?
I got a show on my hands.

43
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,359
Say, that's nothing.
I got Ethel on mine.
I promised her.

44
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,061
Well, unpromise her.
Judas H. Priest!

45
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,963
Here you're bellyaching
about a couple of tickets

46
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,265
and I got a star
and leading lady here
that haven't shown up yet.

47
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,394
You can't get
away with this.
I promised Ethel.

48
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,803
Well, tell her
you can't show up.

49
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,505
What's the matter,
you afraid of that fluff?

50
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,240
What? Me?
Me afraid of a dame?

51
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,742
Hey, I'll tell a dame
anything I want to

52
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,212
and push her in the mush
if she lets out a peep!

53
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,808
(SCOFFS) Well, what
do you want from me?
Go ahead and...

54
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,713
Hey, a swell pal
you've turned out to be.

55
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,053
When you were
a cheap reporter

56
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,287
butting in around the
Police Headquarters,

57
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,622
did I ever give you
the runaround?

58
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,425
Oh, go away, will you?
You bother me.
I'm a busy man here.

59
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,553
All right.
That washes us up.

60
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,762
Just try and ask me
for a favor sometime.

61
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,531
Go away.
You're breaking my heart.

62
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,796
Out! Out! Out! Out!
Out, you!

63
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,568
Take it on the lam.
You take it.

64
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,005
Out! Get out, you big
mallet-head! Outside!

65
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,742
What kind of a place is this?
Opening night.

66
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,277
Get in there and
get your clothes off.

67
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,778
Oh, people are
so inconsiderate.

68
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,303
Oh, Mr. Ellery.

69
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,180
Not now, not now.

70
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,241
(GIGGLES)

71
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,211
That was grand.
I love the way
you sing that, Eric.

72
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,579
Thank you, dear.
But let's rush, darling.

73
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,680
We've got to get
to the theater.

74
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,082
No, no, not yet, Ann darling.
You must play it once more.

75
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,218
I must try my new
lyrics once more.

76
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,287
Come, just once.
Come on. Be a good girl.

77
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,516
There.

78
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,356
(SINGING)
In some secluded rendezvous

79
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:01,733
That overlooks the avenue

80
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:06,499
With someone sharing
a delightful chat

81
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:07,970
Of this and that

82
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,473
(MOUTHING)

83
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:13,341
And cocktails for two

84
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:17,906
As we enjoy a cigarette

85
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:23,477
To some exquisite chansonette

86
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:27,484
Two hands are
sure to slyly meet

87
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,051
Beneath a serviette

88
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,655
With cocktails for two

89
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,901
Oh, I adore
you, darling.

90
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,670
And I adore you, too,
but you'd better be careful.

91
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,806
You'll sing it
to me some night
like that onstage.

92
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,638
Well, I wouldn't care.

93
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:47,208
(SINGING)
With intoxicating kisses

94
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,945
For the principal ingredient

95
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:58,380
Most any afternoon at five

96
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:04,194
We'll be so glad
we're both alive

97
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,726
Then maybe fortune
will complete her plan

98
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:16,331
That all began with
cocktails for two

99
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,432
There you are.

100
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,635
(BOTH LAUGH)

101
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,734
(CLOCK CHIMING)

102
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,176
There's the clock.

103
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:22,975
We must go to the theater.

104
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,145
Come along, dear.

105
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,719
This is the happiest
night of my life, Eric,

106
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,688
and nothing,
nothing can spoil it.

107
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,055
Nothing, Ann dear,
nothing.

108
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,425
But there's one thing
I must tell you.

109
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,727
No, no, no, there's only
one thing you can tell
me tonight, darling.

110
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,888
Come along.

111
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,122
(CAR APPROACHING)

112
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,969
Oh, Judas H. Priest.

113
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,172
Listen, this is opening night.
Will you get inside here?

114
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,074
You're in here making
taxicab hocus-pocus.

115
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,210
Oh, this isn't hocus-pocus.
This is orange blossoms.

116
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,979
You mean you're
going to get married
and all that stuff?

117
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,949
We're going over
to Jersey and wake up
a minister after the show.

118
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,850
Oh, gee, ain't
that marvelous.

119
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,287
Can you imagine
buying all that
from a minister for $10?

120
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,190
And what a break
for the show.
Crooners make it real.

121
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,725
Say, listen, I'll have it
on the front page

122
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,060
of every morning
newspaper in the city.

123
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,195
Oh, but say, listen,
in the meantime,

124
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,831
would you mind coming
inside and getting busy,
please, just for me?

125
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,299
Shall we?
Let's.

126
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,925
Oh, grand.

127
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,370
Hey, listen, Lona,
have you got
a date for tonight?

128
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,362
LONA: I don't know yet.

129
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,941
Hey, listen,
you two can't get
married tonight.

130
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,576
Why not?
Well, wait till Sunday night.

131
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,411
We'll get a better
break in the Monday
morning newspapers.

132
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,047
ERIC: I'm sorry, Jack,
but we don't wait.

133
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,916
We take off tonight
and I bet we find you

134
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,717
crawling out of the
minister's nightshirt

135
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,016
with a couple of
newsreel cameramen.

136
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,288
They want you
out front, Mr. Ellery.

137
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,139
Oh, that Carroll's
blood pressure's going
up by long distance.

138
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,227
Good evening, Norma.
Hello, Norma.

139
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,820
Oh, Mr. Lander.

140
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:49,065
I hope you're a wonderful
success tonight
and that nothing...

141
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,534
I mean that everything...

142
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,436
Thanks, Norma,
I hope you like me.

143
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:02,313
Like you. Gosh.

144
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,216
I beg your pardon.

145
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,376
Oh!

146
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,426
Well, how long did it take you
to get a bottle of champagne?

147
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,122
Or maybe I'm wrong

148
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,197
and you're
the star of this opera
and I'm the hired girl.

149
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,325
I'm sorry, Miss Rita.

150
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,493
I stopped to
hear some gossip.

151
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,627
Gossip.

152
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:26,728
Dirt? Spill it.

153
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:30,297
Mr. Lander and Miss Ware
are gonna get married.

154
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,578
Married? Why, he can't...

155
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,048
Why not? He's gotta
get married sometime.

156

He can't always
play around.

And to that little...

158
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,424
After what I've been to him.

159
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,483
Oh, yeah?

160
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,827
Well, after what
I've done for him.

161
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,095
Why, I brought him
into this show.

162
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,831
You brought him in?
You and who else?
Just me.

163
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,534
Carroll saw me
in an act with him
and brought him along.

164
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,837
Listen, baby, blues
singers like you are
thicker on Broadway

165
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,567
than brunettes in Africa.

166
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,938
It was Lander
Carroll wanted.

167
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,206
He just brought you along
to hold his hat for him.

168
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,126
Is that the truth
you're telling me,
you broken-down clown,

169
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,627
or are you trying to ride me?

170
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,120
I wouldn't joke about a
thing like that, Miss Rita.

171

beautiful and
romantic?

with you sitting on there?

She's got dirt.

175

All Carroll's
children got dirt.

176

Dish it. Dirt's
no good cold.

is she burning.

a ring and what not?

Eric, Rita Ross,
she is very angry.

Now, don't worry, darling.

Oh, but this means so much,
this Broadway opening.

197
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,229
Wouldn't it be wise perhaps
to make up with her
just for a little while?

Oh, I know Rita.

She'll put on an act, perhaps
throw a tantrum or two,

Nobody's going
to hurt her.

Rita could pull the
theater down on us,

out and go over to

What makes you doubt it?

Oh, I was just
looking through some

and apparently she's written

No.

picked it up and
brought it along.

those tiny ears of
yours out of here.

out of my apartment.

looking through some stuff.

You weren't keeping it
under cover, were you?

410
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,999
What did you take it for?

411
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,973
It just seemed to be
a good idea at the time.

412

The dame in that photograph
must have been quite a bother

to the boys in
Vienna 30 years ago.

414

Why did you take it?

and in grand opera, too.

Nothing will come of that
if you don't get out of step.

that Helene Smith,

was Elsie Singer.

And she killed
a guy in Vienna.

He was a dirty rotten...

426

But he was a big shot

that killed him,

years of drudgery
and sacrifice

that story to anybody

you never tell anybody
anything again!

471
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,424
Get on the stage.
Not now, dear.

472
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,020
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

473
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,962
Eric. Eric, come here.

474
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,505
Why don't you smile
for the customers?

475
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,639
Say, you ought to be
grinning from ear to ear.

476
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:57,840
You're marrying
this beautiful girl.

477
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,076
Say, I'm going to have
every newspaper man in
town at the wedding.

478
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,310
I'm afraid not, Jack.
What?

479
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:02,300
What?

480
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,614
We'll have to
postpone the wedding
for a few days.

481
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,015
Why?
Oh, there's your cue.

482
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:10,166
Come on, get on the stage.
Watch out for that piano.
Get up there.

483
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:28,405
(SINGING) Today was so
depressing and so long

484
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:34,604
You were gone,
I was blue

485
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:41,311
Tonight I feel like
bursting into song

486
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:48,086
A song for you

487
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,557
Night winds are sighing

488
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:54,426
There's music in the sea

489
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,296
The whole world has joined

490
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:00,336
In a lover's rhapsody

491
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:05,637
What are the wild
waves saying to me?

492
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:10,806
Live and love tonight

493
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:16,251
Ripples of moonlight
illuminate the shore

494
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:22,018
Like beacons of romance
I never saw before

495
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:27,530
What are they all
conveying to me?

496
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,763
Live and love tonight

497
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:37,273
Sweetheart,
I've lived this moment

498
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,935
In all my dreams

499
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,343
All my life

500
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:48,146
I've waited for this moment

501
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:51,249
And now if we delay

502
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:56,691
Our moment may slip away

503
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,558
In my embraces

504
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,497
You haven't said a word

505
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,535
But I listened closely

506
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:08,400
And this is what I heard

507
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,134
Your heart beats cry

508
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:14,200
In rhythm with mine

509
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:20,740
Live and love tonight

510
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,531
Did you really mean
that we're not going
to be married tonight?

511
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,533
Yes, dear.
Something has come up.

512
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,399
Don't ask questions now.

513
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,437
Everything's going
to work out fine.

514
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,464
But if there's any trouble,
shouldn't I know?

515
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:31,146
(SINGING) Sweetheart,
I've lived this moment

516
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:36,982
In all my dreams,
all my life

517
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:41,648
(SINGING) I've waited
for this moment

518
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:45,892
And now,
if we delay, our moment...

519
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,063
Mr. Ellery.
What?

520
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,198
There's some
comedians out
there with flat feet.

521
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,034
They say they're cops
and that you sent for them.

522
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,203
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah,
couple of friends of mine.

523
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,271
I couldn't get them tickets,

524
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:59,972
so I'm going to let them
see the show from here.
It's okay. Send them in.

525
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:07,544
(BOTH SINGING)
Your heart beats cry
in rhythm with mine

526
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:13,556
Live and love tonight

527
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,455
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

528
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,490
Oh, old crockhead,
so it's you.

529
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,360
Yeah, me.

530
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,633
I send to the Police
Station for a copper
and look what I get.

531
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:58,768
I thought this was
your night off.

532
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,719
So it is,
but I'd give up anything
to do an old pal a favor,

533
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,074
especially after all
the trouble you went to
about those tickets.

534
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,809
Oh, now listen, Bill.
You know I...

535
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,607
You can't square yourself!

536
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:12,248
What are we here
for, somebody
disturbing your peace?

537
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,899
Not mine,
somebody else's.

538
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,419
It seems that
somebody around here's
dropping sand bags

539
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:20,089
on the leading lady's dome
and trying to cut her up
with broken glass.

540
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,718
Say, boy, go back
to your bootleg.

541
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,126
This legal stuff ain't
agreeing with you.

542
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,228
Listen, mallet-head,
we got comedians
in this show

543
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,929
that get paid
to be funny.

544
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:31,661
Hey,
what do you want me to do,
make a pinch for false...

545
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:42,178
Judas H. Priest,
30,000 cops in New York,

546
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,980
and I've got to pick out
a big flat-footed
Romeo like you.

547
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,415
Why don't you take
your lamps off those dames

548
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,817
and do
a little police work?

549
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,376
This is police work.

550
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,587
Them babies look like
they got clues or something.

551
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,888
Oh, be serious,
will you, Bill?

552
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,591
Somebody around here's
committing merry mayhem,
maybe murder.

553
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,126
Why don't you kind
of peek around, huh?

554
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,856
Sure, I'll peek around.

555
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,629
Now, there's
a baby over there

556
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:03,480
that looks suspicious
and ought to be followed.

557
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,903
(LAUGHS) Don't get too
close to her or she'll
mistake you for King Kong.

558
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,303
Oh, Mr. Ellery.

559
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,974
Oh, not now.
Go away. Not now.

560
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,442
Oh, but...

561
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:19,537
(GIGGLES)

562
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:36,425
(SINGING)
Soothe me with your caress

563
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:42,770
Sweet Marijuana, Marijuana

564
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:49,139
Help me in my distress

565
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:55,349
Sweet Marijuana, please do

566
00:35:56,454 --> 00:36:02,085
You alone can bring
my lover back to me

567
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,395
Even though I know
it's all a fantasy

568
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:14,294
And then, put me to sleep

569
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:19,809
Sweet Marijuana, Marijuana

570
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:38,226
You alone can bring
my lover back to me

571
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:44,466
Even though I know
it's all a fantasy

572
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:51,202
And then put me to sleep

573
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:58,271
Sweet Marijuana, Marijuana

574
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,838
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

575
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,984
Get back here.
Come on, you big mallet-head!

576
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,519
First thing you know,
you'll be out
in the audience.

577
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,714
(SCREAMS)

578
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:05,944
What's that?

579
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,319
Don't you know?

580
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,157
Blood.

581
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,596
JACK: Hey, what's
the matter up there?

582
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:14,655
It's blood.

583
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,961
You're crazy.
That's paint.

584
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,534
WOMAN: There's
a woman up there!

585
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:19,768
MAN: There's nobody up there.
There is!

586
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,604
Quiet. Quiet.
There's a show
going on out front!

587
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,906
Hey, cork this place up.
And, Ben, you stay with me.

588
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,931
Okay, Boss.

589
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,209
How do you get up there,
or would you know?

590
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,541
Yeah, I know.

591
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,546
Probably some dame up there
got dizzy and fainted.

592
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,814
It's all right.
Come on with me, Bill.

593
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,282
JACK: Come on, come on!
Get this show going,
will you?

594
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,450
Get out on the stage.

595
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:38,201
If you guys want $5
short in your pay envelope,
just keep...

596
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,886
MAN: Mildred LaRue!

597
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,139
This is a great
spot for a girl

598
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,707
to pick out to
sleep out a drunk.

599
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,358
What is this?
What is it?

600
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,645
Listen, they got good cops
over there in Jersey.

601
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,670
What's her act?

602
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,014
What's her act?
You don't know?

603
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,448
Maybe she's one of
the Flying Ginsbergs.

604
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,083
Well, come on,
pick her up.

605
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,718
Are you going to
stay down there
and get married to her?

606
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,209
Yeah, she is dead.

607
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,756
What? Judas H. Priest!

608
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:14,949
Who is she, Jack?

609
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,092
Well, I can't see her face.
Wait a minute.

610
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:20,093
Mustn't touch
until the medical
officer says so.

611
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,377
MURDOCK: Now, who is she?

612
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,046
JACK: I never saw her before.

613
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,481
What do you mean?
Don't you know
everybody in your show?

614
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,417
Yeah,
I know everybody in the show
and that's the answer.

615
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,352
She ain't in the show.

616
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,051
Uh-oh.

617
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,156
No mouth burns.

618
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,163
Funny place to
pick for a bump off.

619
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,495
Yeah.

620
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,900
A million buildings
here in New York.

621
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,698
365 nights in a year,

622
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,303
but this dame's got
to pick this night

623
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,339
and this building
to commit suicide.

624
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,241
It isn't suicide.
It's murder.

625
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,799
What?

626
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,278
You mean somebody
chased her up here

627
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,612
and shoved that
stuff down her throat?

628
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:15,516
No, somebody pushed
this into her heart.

629
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,856
Well, I've finished.
You can take her away now.

630
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,189
MAN: Yes, sir.

631
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,899
Murder,
and my opening night!

632
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,334
What do you do in
a case like this,

633
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,428
give the people
their money back?

634
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,840
Oh, hey, Bill,
you're not gonna
close the show?

635
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,675
Oh, no, I'm going
to parade the body

636
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,477
and give 10 cents
a head to see it.

637
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,480
Listen, Bill, you
can't do that.
Don't you understand?

638
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:47,282
The boss is sick
in Atlantic City
and this is my big chance.

639
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:49,084
Asking me for
a favor now,
aren't you?

640
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:50,819
Yes, Bill, I am asking
you for a favor.

641
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,755
Listen. Please don't
close the show.

642
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,656
Nothing doing.
Pull your show.

643
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,426
Listen, if it wasn't for
me, you'd still be
pounding those pavements.

644
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,794
Wasn't it my paper
that went to bat for you

645
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,429
when the commissioner
broke Drake and McGinley?

646
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:03,558
Yeah, and tonight
you penciled me
out of my dame.

647
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,300
Go and make
your announcement.
The party's over.

648
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,070
Oh, listen,
I'll get you 50 dames,
but don't break me, will you?

649
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,371
Who owns this doodad?

650
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,489
I wouldn't know.

651
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,202
Sure, you wouldn't know.

652
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:13,675
Know anybody
around here who would?

653
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,043
Well, the wardrobe
woman might.

654
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,578
Well, let's go and
see the wardrobe woman.

655
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,274
Okay.

656
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:20,816
But first call off your show.

657
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,084
What are you going to do?

658
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,153
Go down there and
make an announcement,
I suppose?

659
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,088
"Will the killer
please step forward?"

660
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,091
Listen, Bill, let
the killer think, see,
that nobody's wise

661
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,826
and then you can
stand down there
and watch who's who.

662
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:31,927
MURDOCK: Nothing doing.

663
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,962
Can you imagine if
you went down below,

664
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:36,465
there see,
with the report in one hand
and the killer in the other?

665
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,734
Why, you'd come out
of the Police
Station a captain.

666
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,736
Just imagine that,
Captain Murdock.

667
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,704
Don't that just
roll off your tongue?

668
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:43,933
Captain Murdock.

669
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,809
Why, say, those two
words go together
like bacon and eggs.

670
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,107
Sure.

671
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:51,046
Maybe I'll
investigate this murder
to music for awhile.

672
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,147
Now you're talking, Bill.

673
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,715
Come on down here,
you can watch
everything from here.

674
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,705
Come on.

675
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,883
Why, what's wrong?

676
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:07,410
It's all right, darling,
I think she's just fainted!

677
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,955
You run along upstairs.
Run along.

678
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,869
JACK: Now, come on, come on,
get back everybody, will you?

679
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,997
Go on, get back,
will you?

680
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,673
Listen, boys and girls,
will you listen to me?

681
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,208
There's nothing
wrong here.

682
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,510
This lady just went
upstairs and got dizzy
and fainted. See?

683
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,745
So now, make your changes
for the second act.

684
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,180
And if you don't,
I'm going to rehearse you

685
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:26,548
all day Sunday
and then fire you.

686
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,278
Now go on,
move along now.

687
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,447
(CHATTERING)

688
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,088
MAN: Eight minutes.

689
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,681
Eight minutes change.

690
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,128
Come on, you only have
eight minutes for your change.

691
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,357
Down the stairs!

692
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,631
Come on,
down to the dressing room.

693
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,532
(CHATTERING)

694
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:54,376
You can't come in here.
There are girls.

695
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,775
We can go anywhere.

696
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,245
You the wardrobe woman?

697
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,372
Yes.

698
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,279
Well, do you recognize that?

699
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,576
Yes.

700
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,278
Who's been wearing it?

701
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,785
Rita Ross.

702
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,085
That's all.

703
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,965
Well, Venus, where
have you been?

704
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,735
That...

705
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:27,609
There was a girl fainted.

706
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,278
Well, what of it?
Are you working for her?

707
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,712
I'm sorry.

708
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:32,145
Oh, go away!

709
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,415
Say, Rita, come here
a minute, will you?

710
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,584
There's a fellow out
here that used to go
to school with you.

711
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,352
There's a catch
in it somewhere.
I never went to school.

712
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,503
MAN: Come on, girls,
snap into it!

713
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:45,141
Rita,
this is Lieutenant Murdock
from Police Headquarters.

714
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,461
What have I done,
parked in front
of a fire plug?

715
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,501
You ever seen this before?

716
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,503
I wouldn't be surprised.

717
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,768
Yours?

718
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:00,873
Could be.

719
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:03,011
I don't care if it
could or it couldn't.
Is it?

720
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,347
I usually wear one like
that with this costume.

721
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,337
So what?

722
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,380
So, this.

723
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,658
Is she dead?

724
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:17,886
Yes.

725
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,629
Somebody pushed this
pin through her heart.

726
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,029
Oh, how horrible.

727
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:23,398
Do you know this dame?

728
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,559
No.

729
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:27,660
No. Pardon me for asking.
Of course you don't.

730
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,304
There's a hundred people
back of the stage here

731
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,455
and nobody's ever
seen her before.

732
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,268
I saw her.

733
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,643
Well, why didn't you say so?

734
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,111
You asked me
if I knew her.
I don't.

735
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,912
I see a thousand people
a day I don't know!

736
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,845
Go on, go on.
Where did you see her?

737
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,925
About a half an hour ago,
coming out of
the wardrobe room.

738
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,622
Wardrobe. Wardrobe.
Wardrobe. Oh, Ben.

739
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:55,263
Get the wardrobe woman.

740
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,390
Right.

741
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,793
And?

742
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:01,103
Mrs. Smith and that girl
had some kind of a row.

743
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,554
Oh, they did, did they?

744
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,095
Yes.

745
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,937
Mrs. Smith has
a duplicate of that pin.

746
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,777
Or did.

747
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,510
Where's your pin?

748
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:18,347
Right here.

749
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,282
Okay.

750
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,984
Here's the wardrobe
woman, Bill.

751
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:28,758
Mrs. Smith, have you
any more of these toys?

752
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,600
Things like that are always
carried in duplicate.

753
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:32,795
Well, turn it up.

754
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,995
It's gone.

755
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,833
Oh, it's gone, eh?

756
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,673
Yes, I looked,
after you asked for it.

757
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,609
Yeah, I had an idea.

758
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:44,079
A little birdie peeped
that you might
not find it there.

759
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,480
OFFICER: Hey, you
can't go in there.

760
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:46,815
HOMER: Take your hands
off of me, menial!

761
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:49,818
Who are you, and why
are you addressing this
lady like that?

762
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,947
I'm Police,
Lieutenant Murdock.
And who are you?

763
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,072
Mr. Boothby.
He's with the show.

764
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,993
The man with the
flying trapeze?

765
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:02,488
Sir, I have played with
Modjeska and Mantell!

766
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,567
Ah! That's their
grudge, not mine.
Now, keep out of here.

767
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,661
I don't care who you are.

768
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,538
I demand that you
cease the absurdity

769
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,473
of questioning
this fine woman.

770
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,709
Listen, Hamlet,
ever hear of a little thing

771
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,735
like interfering
with justice?

772
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,074
Justice?

773
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:22,778
"Oh, Justice, what stupidities
are committed in thy name!"

774
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,953
Scram out of here or
I'll have you committed.

775
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,588
Please, Homer.
Come on, Romeo.

776
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,290
I'm quite all right.
HOMER: Take your hands off me!

777
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,986
I'm quite all right.

778
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,959
HOMER: I was never so
insulted in all my life!

779
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:34,991
(SIGHS) Now, then.

780
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,303
Why did you kill that dame?

781
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,737
I didn't.

782
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:46,932
I never saw her before.

783
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,306

940
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:56,681
Once again, my love, my love

941
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,818
Fare thee well

942
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:06,232
And may the angels guide you
until then, my love

943
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,269
Get Dr. Saunders, quick!

944
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,437
I'll get him, boss!

945
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,303
Step aside there, girls!

946
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:24,685
Now listen.
Now wait a minute!

947
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:25,820
Now listen to me, everybody!

948
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:26,988
We've had a little
trouble here, see,

949
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,222
but everything's
gonna be all right.

950
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:30,291
So take it in your
stride like real
troupers, will you?

951
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,726
There's over 2,000
people out front

952
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,661
that've paid a lot of money
to come and see this show,

953
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,062
and they're entitled
to everything

954
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:36,397
we can give 'em,
don't you understand?

955
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,366
So kind of settle down
and give 'em the works,
will you?

956
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:39,500
Make your changes now.

957
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:40,991
(PERFORMERS CHATTERING)

958
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,493
Yes, she's dead all right.

959
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,620
Dead!

960
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:10,297
Yeah, she was going
to blow the lid off,
and now she's dead.

961
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:11,732
Does that add up
anything?

962
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:13,334
Listen, it might
add up to making

963
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,902
you look ridiculous
if you're not careful.

964
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,598
Yeah? Well, it's simple.

965
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,372
Mrs. Smith or Lander did it.

966
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,207
Lander wouldn't
do that, I know!

967
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:22,176
Yeah, you know!
She had to be shut up,

968
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,111
and somebody
shut her up pretty.

969
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,313
And it was your
wardrobe woman
or your tenor.

970
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:27,508
Wait a minute.

971
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:28,816
It could have been
the machine gun.

972
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:29,884
Did you ever stop to figure

973
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:32,453
that somebody could
have stuck a bullet
in there with those blanks?

974
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:33,716
Listen, sap!

975
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,950
How could one
bullet out of 300

976
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,225
hit a certain dame
just where it'd croak her?

977
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:39,659
No, no, no.

978
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:42,378
It was Mrs. Smith or
Lander did the trick!

979
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,081
Ben, get that Mrs. Smith.

980
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,666
And where did
that guy Lander go?

981
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:48,295
He went upstairs
about a minute ago.

982
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,709
Oh! Yes!
Mr. Lander! Lander!

983
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:08,122
Hey, Brownie, go get
Rita Ross' understudy
right away.

984
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:09,724
What's wrong with her?
She can't finish the show.

985
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,159
Go and get her,
will you? Go on!

986
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,320
I'm sorry, Mr. Ellery!

987
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,347
Haven't I got enough worries
without... Go away!

988
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:26,436
It's... It's you.

989
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,293
Are you looking for
something, Mr. Lander?

990
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,719
Are you looking
for someone?

991
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:39,970
Yes, where's Lander?

992
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,546
I don't know.

993
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:49,029
Are you sure there's nothing
I can do for you, Mr. Lander?

994
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:51,260
Something maybe
you'd like to know?

995
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,400
ERIC: That's nice of you,
Norma, but...

996
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:55,369
Something maybe
about Vienna?

997
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,302
Norma! Do you know?

998
01:02:57,373 --> 01:02:59,203
Yeah, I know.

999
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,108
You know the letter
she got from
the Viennese police?

1000
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,974
Yeah.
Then tell me!

1001
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:04,512
Did she answer that letter?

1002
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:07,063
Yeah, tonight, after
she'd talked to you.

1003
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:14,278
Then it's...
Then it's all too late!

1004
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,221
No, it isn't.

1005
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,850
She thinks
it's in the mail.

1006
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:30,135
Norma! I owe you
everything for that!

1007
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:43,551
MAID: What's the
matter with you, man?

1008
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,452
Don't you know
enough to knock before

1009
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:47,753
you come busting
into a lady's room?

1010
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:01,528
What's going on here?

1011
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,161
Why, nothing.

1012
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:04,839
What's this you're burning?

1013
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,832
That? A note I was
going to leave for Rita,

1014
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:10,104
but she'll be
here in a moment.

1015
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,406
She will, will she?

1016
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,538
Yes, she's got to change.

1017
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,416
Well, she ain't
going to be here,

1018
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:18,580
and her next change
will be in a wooden kimono.

1019
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:19,847
What do you mean?

1020
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:21,789
You're putting on
a good act, Lander.

1021
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:22,984
She's dead!

1022
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,218
Dead?

1023
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:26,590
Yeah, and you know it.

1024
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:29,289
But how should I know it?

1025
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:30,464
You don't think I...

1026
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:34,299
I did think,
but since catching you here,
I'm past thinking.

1027
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:36,869
Come on.

1028
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,782
I'm sorry, Mr. Ellery.

1029
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:51,100
I've been looking
all over for you.

1030
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,454
Where'd you find that?

1031
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:56,456
I found it back of that flat.

1032
01:04:57,126 --> 01:05:00,661
Somebody threw it there.
Lander was standing there.
He could have tossed it.

1033
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:02,960
Mrs. Smith.
Maybe Boothby.

1034
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:08,202
Listen, don't say anything
to anybody about this, hear?

1035
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:10,103
But won't I get
into trouble?

1036
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:11,505
Don't say a word.
Shut up!

1037
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,701
Oh! Mr. Ellery!

1038
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:16,972
What do you...
Not now, not now!

1039
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:18,034
Oh!

1040
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:22,976
(GIGGLES)

1041
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,221
But ain't you
going to turn that over
to the copper, Mr. Ellery?

1042
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,189
Not till I find out
who it belongs to.

1043
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:30,424
It's a cinch
it ain't Lander's.

1044
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,826
It might be Mrs. Smith's,
it might be Boothby's.

1045
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:35,396
But anyway,
I ain't going to give it
to that big flatfoot until...

1046
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:36,797
Until the show's
over, anyway.

1047
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:37,998
But do you think I'll...

1048
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,449
Listen, go away.
You bother me!
Please!

1049
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,057
You sent for me?
Yeah.

1050
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,493
You know, I thought
you killed Rita Ross,

1051
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:08,223
but I know now he did it.

1052
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:12,758
He killed Rita Ross?
Is she dead?

1053
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:14,233
Very.

1054
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,803
You don't seem to be
upset much, do you?

1055
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,639
She deserved to be killed,
but he didn't do it.

1056
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,336
Uh-oh.
She deserved
to be killed?

1057
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,344
It's stupid to think
that Eric... Mr. Lander...

1058
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:25,279
Eric? Eric?

1059
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:27,047
Say, what is it
between you two?

1060
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:28,606
Why, not a thing.

1061
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:30,981
Why, she just
mothers everybody.

1062
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:34,886
Yeah, maybe she's
been mothering
the private detective.

1063
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:37,057
It's a crime to get
a sweet old lady

1064
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:39,126
all muddled up
the way you're doing!

1065
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:41,862
Yeah, but it was the
blade from that sweet
old lady's scissors

1066
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:44,696
that missed that
Ross dame's head.

1067
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:48,133
And you, Mr. Lander,
was in the room with me.

1068
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:50,504
And you, you sweet old lady,
just where were you

1069
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,039
when the blade
from those scissors
was thrown?

1070
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:54,441
Why, anybody could have thrown
that scissors blade.

1071
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:57,344
Sure, anybody could
have thrown 'em.
Now, look here.

1072
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,681
You had a row with
the private detective,
and Ross overheard you.

1073
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,649
The blade from your scissors
was thrown at the dame.

1074
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:03,884
I don't think she did it.

1075
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:05,477
Now shut up, will you?

1076
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,922
Now, the Ross dame
said she would spill
something about you

1077
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:10,624
that would send
you to the chair,

1078
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,459
and then the Ross
dame gets killed.

1079
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:16,055
Why don't you
take me downtown
and leave her alone?

1080
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:18,465
No, laddie, I ain't
gonna take you downtown,

1081
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:20,734
but you've been
a great help to me.

1082
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:23,135
Now go on, go out
and roll your hoop.

1083
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,705
Right now this
old lady's my meat.

1084
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:25,798
Oh, you!

1085
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,239
Please, Eric, go!

1086
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:31,209
Ben! Take this
Prince Charming outside,
will you?

1087
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,146
Come on, come on, get out!

1088
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:40,516
I'll have plenty
to say to you later!

1089
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,515
Mr. Lander, your
number is on right away.

1090
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:46,218
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1091
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,609
Say, Eric! I want to
see you a minute alone.

1092
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:03,907
ANN: What's up?

1093
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:05,279
Go on, Ann, exit.
This doesn't affect you.

1094
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:07,014
It affects me if
it affects Eric.

1095
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:09,850
Go on, Jack, she knows
everything now. What is it?

1096
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:11,585
Well, listen, about Rita.
Did you...

1097
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,213
Of course he didn't.

1098
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,922
Did you bring
a gun in here tonight?

1099
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,050
A gun? Certainly not.

1100
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:18,459
Are you telling me
the truth?

1101
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:19,760
Well, of course I am, Jack.

1102
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,228
Okay. Then we'll
find out who did it.

1103
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:24,998
In the meantime, get on
there and do your number.
Go ahead, kid.

1104
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,091
Hurry, darling.

1105
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:28,117
I'll be in time.
Don't worry!

1106
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,000
(SINGING) Oh, what delight
to be given the right

1107
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:39,775
To be carefree
and gay once again

1108
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:45,047
No longer slinking,
respectable drinking

1109
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:49,113
Like civilized ladies and men

1110
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:55,222
No longer need we miss

1111
01:08:56,265 --> 01:09:00,530
A charming scene like this

1112
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:13,109
In some secluded rendezvous

1113
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:18,576
That overlooks the avenue

1114
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:25,025
With someone sharing
a delightful chat

1115
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:27,857
Of this and that

1116
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:32,229
And cocktails for two

1117
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:38,466
As we enjoy a cigarette

1118
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:44,809
To some exquisite chansonette

1119
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,610
Two hands are
sure to slyly meet

1120
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:52,676
Beneath a serviette

1121
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:56,952
With cocktails for two

1122
01:09:57,026 --> 01:10:01,257
My head may go reeling

1123
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:05,891
But my heart will be obedient

1124
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:09,061
With intoxicating kisses

1125
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:15,337
As the principal ingredient

1126
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:21,508
Most any afternoon at 5.; oo

1127
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:27,180
We'll be so glad
we're both alive

1128
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:33,991
Then maybe fortune
will complete her plan

1129
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:37,225
That all began

1130
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:42,065
With cocktails for two!

1131
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:40,122
Find out anything yet, Doc?

1132
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,427
Shot in the back.

1133
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:53,163
It looks like a
small caliber gun.

1134
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:57,169
A small caliber gun?

1135
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:05,218
Why are you so anxious
to keep Lander out of this?

1136
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,653
Had he anything
to do with this

1137
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,055
mysterious business
you killed Rita for?

1138
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:10,290
Judas H. Priest!
Now I suppose she did it!

1139
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:12,426
It's a good thing
General Grant's got
an alibi.

1140
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:14,127
Yes, and I suppose
you knew she didn't?

1141
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:16,028
Sure, I know.
You know!

1142
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:17,464
Why, she just confessed!

1143
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:18,727
Confessed?

1144
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:21,435
Yeah, why, sure,
I knew she or Lander did it,

1145
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:24,132
so I played 'em up
against each other.

1146
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:25,669
Yeah.

1147
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,401
You killed Rita?

1148
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:32,273
MURDOCK: You knew!
Smart Broadway guy!

1149
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,814
Well, how'd you kill her?

1150
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:35,248
Well, what does it matter?

1151
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,580
It doesn't.

1152
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:38,752
Look, and we've no
time for you now, Jack.

1153
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:41,881
Listen, do one thing.
Tell me something.

1154
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:45,025
You stabbed Rita with one
half of that scissors blade,
didn't you?

1155
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,027
Is that what Dr.
Saunders says?
Quiet, quiet!

1156
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:48,620
Well, that cinches it!

1157
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,493
Answer me, Mrs. Smith.

1158
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:53,333
You killed Rita with
that scissors blade,
didn't you? Didn't you?

1159
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:54,767
Yes.

1160
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,403
Yeah. What does
that add up to?

1161
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:58,638
Well, it just adds up to
a washout, mallet-head!

1162
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,663
Yeah!

1163
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:02,442
Dr. Saunders in there
has just found
that Rita was shot

1164
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:05,935
with a small
caliber revolver.

1165
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:07,714
Yeah! Yeah!
Are you kidding?

1166
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:08,882
Why should I kid you?

1167
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:11,051
And I suppose you're going
to lock up Mrs. Smith here,

1168
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:14,818
because she stabbed
Rita with a.32 revolver
at 16 paces!

1169
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:21,487
Hey, go and rivet some panties
on your cuties out there.

1170
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,430
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

1171
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:26,898
Wise guy!

1172
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:29,703
You always thinking
Smith and Lander did it.

1173
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:30,904
What about this
guy Boothby out here?

1174
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:31,963
No, no!

1175
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,874
Anybody with half
an eye could see...
No, no!

1176
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:35,442
...that he's in
love with the old dame.
Yes, yes.

1177
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:36,943
He was handling
that phony machine gun!

1178
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:38,712
All right. He might
have been handling

1179
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:41,181
something else at
the same time, huh?

1180
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,448
Ben!

1181
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:46,787
Go and bring Boothby here.

1182
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:48,085
Okay.

1183
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:51,917
You're killing me!
Say,

1184
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:54,961
I found
something out there

1185
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:57,063
that might interest a good,
smart detective.

1186
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:58,765
Of course, there's no use
my taking it up with you.

1187
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:00,256
What is it?

1188
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:03,634
Well, here, mallet-head.
I picked it up on the stage.

1189
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:07,140
Can you make it out?

1190
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:11,410
Uh-huh.

1191
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:16,239
Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
Yeah, thanks.

1192
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:18,752
It's Lander's gun.
What?

1193
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:20,187
That's what the Bureau says.

1194
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:23,657
Permit issued to
Eric Lander, actor,
54 West 54th Street.

1195
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:25,785
I knew it! Come on, Ben!

1196
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:37,762
Where's Lander?

1197
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,534
He's up making a change.

1198
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:43,405
How can I help when
I don't know a thing?

1199
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,512
Every man for himself.
So that's it?

1200
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,547
I'm sorry, Jack,
but there it is.

1201
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:49,816
Oh! Gee, Eric, won't
you listen a moment?

1202
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:51,051
Say, what are you doing here?

1203
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:52,519
Nothing.

1204
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:54,954
Hey, where's
that gun of yours?

1205
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,157
I don't know anything
about that gun!

1206
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,319
Yes, you do!
No, I don't.

1207
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:01,194
Somebody stole it
out of my apartment.

1208
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:03,390
Why don't you try
something new?

1209
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:05,232
Didn't you steal it
yourself and bring it
down here

1210
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:06,600
to bump off Rita Ross?

1211
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:08,568
It was stolen.
That's all I know.

1212
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:09,934
You got him.

1213
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,733
Yeah. Give me that paper!

1214
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:15,037
Whose handwriting is this?

1215
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:19,246
It's no use, Bill.
I... I've been trying.

1216
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:21,014
He... He won't talk
till after the show.

1217
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,448
All right, Mr. Ellery.

1218
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,367
He won't talk,
but you will!

1219
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:26,786
Now come on, kick in.
You know something.

1220
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:28,688
It'd mostly be
over your head!

1221
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,191
Quit your stalling.
Now where's that gun?

1222
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:33,894
Did he tell you where it was,
or have you got it?

1223
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:35,021
Search me!

1224
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:37,346
Well, that's an idea.
Come on, Ben.

1225
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:40,357
Take it easy, will you?

1226
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:49,132
I got you!

1227
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:51,677
I thought I recognized
your handwriting!

1228
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:56,544
So my old pal holds
out murder evidence!

1229
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:59,417
Sorry, Jack, but this
puts the finger on you.

1230
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:01,478
Now where's that gun?

1231
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:02,722
Gonna be tough,
are you?

1232
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,991
No, I ain't going to be tough,
and I'll play ball with you.

1233
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:06,560
This show's got eight
minutes to run, see?

1234
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,495
Now if you want that gun,
you're gonna let
me finish my show,

1235
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:09,629
or don't you wanna do that?

1236
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:11,231
I don't do no trading
in murder cases.

1237
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,399
Yeah? Maybe you
won't have a case

1238
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,533
if you take Lander
along with you.

1239
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:15,201
If you haven't got that gun,
well, you got no evidence,

1240
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:16,303
don't you understand that?

1241
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:19,105
And that'll just leave
you a copper with a
remarkable dumbness!

1242
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:22,633
Hey, you got a big house
here, Jack, tonight,

1243
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:24,210
but there's a bigger
house up the river.

1244
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:26,513
Yeah, I know that,
and if I flop with this show,

1245
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:28,415
I just as well go on
up there and stay there,

1246
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,583
you understand,
for the rest of my life.

1247
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:30,684
And let me tell
you something!

1248
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:32,485
If you want that gun,
you're gonna wait
eight minutes, see,

1249
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:34,545
and that's flat and final!

1250
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:38,858
All right, I'll let
you finish the show.

1251
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:40,121
Now you're talking!

1252
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:43,095
Wait a minute.
Stick 'em out.

1253
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:44,698
Bill, you can't do that!

1254
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,394
Come on, stick 'em out!

1255
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:48,535
In case you try
to make a getaway.

1256
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:50,070
That's a lovely dirty trick!

1257
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:52,138
Yeah, you did me
a dirty trick, too.

1258
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,541
And you'll be lucky
if you don't go down
for a long stretch

1259
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:56,576
while your boyfriend's
sitting it out on
the hot seat.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

1261
01:16:57,746 --> 01:16:58,845
MAN: Mr. Lander,
the finale's on.

1262
01:16:58,847 --> 01:16:59,913
But how can I sing?

1263
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:01,214
JACK: Come on,
do the best you can.

1264
01:17:01,216 --> 01:17:02,842
Do it for me, will you?

1265
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:05,552
Roy, can't you
find Mr. Lander?

1266
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:07,248
ROY: I'll try, Miss Ware.

1267
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:21,368
ANN: Hurry, darling.
The number's half over!

1268
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,203
I'm sorry, dear,
but I can't help it.

1269
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,001
Eric, what is it?

1270
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:26,906
Nothing, dear,
nothing at all.

1271
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:29,842
Put your hands over, please.
That's us.

1272
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:37,775
(SINGING) Sweetheart,
I've lived this moment

1273
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:42,949
In all my dreams,
all my life

1274
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:47,518
(SINGING)
I've waited for this moment

1275
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:54,524
And now if we delay
our moment may slip away

1276
01:17:55,237 --> 01:18:00,139
In my embraces,
you haven't said a word

1277
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:05,338
But I listened closely
and this is what I heard

1278
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:10,441
(BOTH SINGING)
Your heart beats cry
in rhythm with mine

1279
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:14,045
Live and love tonight

1280
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:17,524
Well, old mallet-head,
this is the finale!

1281
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,192
Looks like my show's
a big success.

1282
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,751
Yeah.

1283
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:22,829
Sorry you stuck your
nose in it, fellow,

1284
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:24,764
but I gotta do
my duty, you know.

1285
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,858
That's okay, pal.

1286
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:28,935
Being's you been
such a nice boy,

1287
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:31,686
well, I'm going to
give you that gun. Here.

1288
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:33,734
Hey!

1289
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:36,576
Where'd you have it parked?

1290
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:38,477
(SHUSHING)
Don't tell nobody.

1291
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:43,276
No!

1292
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:45,944
(CHUCKLES)
You'd never've found it!

1293
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:48,521
Well, it's a break for you,
you found it again yourself!

1294
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:49,648
Yeah?
Yeah!

1295
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:53,592
(ALL SINGING)
In some secluded rendezvous

1296

That overlooks the avenue

With someone
sharing a delightful chat

1298

Of this and that

1299
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:05,270
And cocktails for two

1300
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:09,070
As we enjoy a cigarette

1301
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:12,943
To some exquisite chansonette

1302

Two hands are
sure to slyly meet

Beneath a serviette

With cocktails for two

1305
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:24,789
My head may go reeling

1306
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,727
But my heart will be obedient

1307
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:31,697
With intoxicating kisses

We'll be so glad
we're both alive

1311
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:48,004
Then maybe fortune
will complete her plan

1312
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:50,277
That all began

to be carefree

I'll go up and

Scram, lady, scram!

and juries before in my life!

I tell you
he didn't kill her!

1331

Kill her! Which her?

1332
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:55,315
Why, he killed two
of them and played

a part in the Vanities
in the same night.

Now, go on, scram,
lady, scram!

1336
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:02,755
I'm gonna take him to
a place where he can
get a bit of rest.

1337
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:04,519
I saw it done!

1338

You saw what done?

01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:08,719
Nothing.

1340
01:21:09,798 --> 01:21:12,493
I mean, Rita Ross.

1341
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:15,165
She's been furious all week,

1342
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:18,304
account of Miss Ware
getting the lead in the show.

1343
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:20,573
And when she heard
Mr. Lander was going
to marry Miss Ware,

1344
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:22,667
she just went wild!

1345
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:25,343
I saw her sneak out
of her dressing room.

1346
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:31,047
(MIRROR SHATTERING)

1347
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:39,286
At first I thought
she only wanted

1348
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,693
to queer Miss Ware's
performance.

1349
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:42,395
And then I saw her
go upstairs,

1350
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:44,097
and then I heard
the lamp crash,

1351
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:45,548
and I knew she did it.

1352
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:48,268
I'm asking you what you saw,
not what you know!

1353
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,760
I suppose you saw her
cut the sandbag?

1354
01:21:50,839 --> 01:21:53,033
No, I didn't
know about that.

1355
01:21:53,108 --> 01:21:55,708
But she was away
from her dressing room
a long time,

1356
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:57,643
and when she came back...

1357
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:05,375
It was a bottle of acid.

1358
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:19,729
I couldn't think what
she'd be doing with it,
so I followed her.

1359
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:33,780
There was another woman
following her, too,

1360
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:36,181
a woman I'd
never seen before.

1361
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:43,913
Down on the stage,
Miss Ware was singing
with Mr. Lander.

1362
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:47,286
Rita took out the acid,

1363
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:51,011
and that woman saw
she was going to throw it
down on 'em.

1364
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:59,163
Suddenly Rita's arm flew up.

1365
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,240
I couldn't see
just what happened.

1366
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:03,106
And then the woman fell.

1367
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:24,295
So you can't arrest
Mr. Lander for that!

1368
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:25,832
Sounds straight.

1369
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,265
Nobody knew anything
about the acid.

1370
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:30,870
But why didn't you tell me
Rita Ross murdered her?

1371
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:32,896
I didn't know it then.

1372
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:36,275
I saw the cops carrying
her into the stage
manager's office,

1373
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:38,870
and Mr. Ellery said
she'd fainted.

1374
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:41,278
I'd have told, all right.

1375
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:43,448
Rita deserved to
go to the chair.

1376
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,576
She was rotten
to everybody.

1377
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:47,210
I'm glad she's dead!

1378
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:51,189
Yeah. So you stabbed
her with the other
half of the scissors?

1379
01:23:51,259 --> 01:23:52,623
That?

1380
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:55,328
She threw that at herself
just to make trouble
for Mrs. Smith.

1381
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:56,819
She hated Mrs. Smith.

1382
01:23:56,898 --> 01:23:58,364
Yeah, so what?

1383
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:01,601
Your story sounded on
the square, but now
you're all mixed up.

1384
01:24:01,603 --> 01:24:03,202
It sounds phony.
Come on, Lander,

1385
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:04,771
I'll pick you out
a nice airy cell.

1386
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:07,002
No, you can't take him!

1387
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:08,598
I thought so!

1388
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:11,271
You saw Rita Ross murdered.

1389
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:12,642
You were there.

1390
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:14,247
No, I...
You know who shot her!

1391
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:16,910
Yes. Yes, I was there.

1392
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:18,448
I'll tell.

1393
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:20,253
But Mr. Lander didn't do it.

1394
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:21,812
He was good to her.

1395
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:26,018
Why, he got her into
this show, and he
was fine to me.

1396
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:29,495
Why, he wouldn't let her
fire me lots of times,

1397
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:31,864
and he stood up for me
when she beat me,

1398
01:24:31,866 --> 01:24:35,323
and made her stop it,
like he did tonight.

1399
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:38,860
She hit me,
right in front of everybody.

1400
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:45,305
I hated her
like I never hated
a human being before!

1401
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:50,077
I got her gun.
I knew where she had it.

1402
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:53,276
I wasn't going to kill her.

1403
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:55,054
I was just going
to make her keep her
hands off me

1404
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:57,546
if she'd come at me again.

1405
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,552
I watched her
dancing and smiling,

1406
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:06,326
and I thought
how black and mean
she was inside.

1407
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:08,968
And then the music got wilder.

1408
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:11,286
Everything was
whirling on the stage.

1409
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:15,605
She was herself then,
just a she-devil
without a heart or a soul!

1410
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:18,711
She had no right to live!
She deserved to be killed!

1411
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:21,214
And then I saw
Mr. Boothby grab
the machine gun

1412
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:22,782
and spray
the dancers with it.

1413
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:25,318
I could feel every
shot crashing into
my brain

1414
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,453
till I didn't know
what I was doing!

1415
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:29,754
I prayed for him
to turn it on her,

1416
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:32,348
with the bullets
tearing her to pieces.

1417
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:36,423
And then I let her have it.

1418
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:39,391
I killed her!

1419
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:43,098
But you shot her
with Lander's revolver!

1420
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:45,331
Mr. Lander's? Oh, no!

1421
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:49,272
No! It was Rita's.

1422
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:52,044
I saw it at her house.
I saw it at the theater.

1423
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:56,607
Why, she must have stolen
Mr. Lander's revolver!

1424
01:25:57,552 --> 01:26:00,453
Tell me,
what was she going
to spill about him?

1425
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:01,978
Why, she...

1426
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:06,756
I never could find out.

1427
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:08,828
She'd faked up
something or other.

1428
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,979
Anything to break
off his marriage.

1429
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:14,467
But it isn't going
to be broken off now,
is it, Mr. Lander?

1430
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:17,960
No, Norma, thanks to you.

1431
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:25,545
So it was the gun
you were trying to
get back, Lander?

1432
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:29,115
You hadn't the nerve
to tell that new
sweetheart of yours

1433
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:31,784
that Rita Ross
was running loose
in your flat.

1434
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:35,277
Well, I hope
you don't have too
much explaining to do.

1435
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:38,524
All right, Ben,
he's in the clear.

1436
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:43,876
And you came clean,
old girl, and if I can
give you a break, I will.

1437
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:47,667
And as soon as I've
changed my clothes,

1438
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:50,236
I'm going out to find
the best attorney
in New York.

1439
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:52,171
We're coming with him,
and all you have to do

1440
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:53,940
is tell him
what you told us.

1441
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:55,074
Thank you very much.

1442
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:56,064
Bless you!

1443
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:58,202
All right, Ben.
Come on.

1444
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:02,982
You go ahead, honey.

1445
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:06,214
Everything's going
to be all right.
Don't worry.

1446
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:10,890
Well, do you
want me now, Bill?

1447
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:12,191
What do I want you for?

1448
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:14,694
All right, forget about it.
I'm sorry we tangled.

1449
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:16,495
Forget about it, fellow,
forget about it!

1450
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:17,997
Say, Bill,
tell me something.

1451
01:27:17,999 --> 01:27:19,432
How'd you like the show?

1452
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:20,499
Hey, do you want
my honest opinion?

1453
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:21,933
Yeah.

1454
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:23,736
You big mallet-headed
lamebrain,

1455
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:24,971
what do you know
about a show?

1456
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:26,305
You've been hanging out
in that Police Station...

1457
01:27:26,307 --> 01:27:28,206
Mr. Ellery.

1458
01:27:28,943 --> 01:27:30,739
Oh, dear. All right, Nancy.

1459
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:32,678
Now, what have you
been trying to tell me?

1460
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:36,342
Mr. Ellery, what I
wanted to tell you was

1461
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:39,579
that Rita Ross has
been stealing things.

1462
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:40,745
What?

1463
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:41,845
Yes, Mr. Ellery.

1464
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:46,757
I saw her sneak
into the wardrobe
and steal a hat pin.

1465
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:49,227
Judas H... Something.
There you are!

1466
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:50,796
Why didn't you
listen to her?

1467
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:52,231
Why didn't you listen
to her, mallet-head?

1468
01:27:52,233 --> 01:27:54,400
She wasn't talking to me.
She was talking
to you, brainless.

1469
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:56,335
What a smart dick you are!
Why, take one look at a girl

1470
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:58,204
and you can tell she's
got a clue or something!

1471
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:00,765
Mr. Ellery!
What is it that I had?

1472
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,873
Never mind, honey.
You still have it.

1473
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:08,403
Say, how about
a little supper,
you and me?

1474
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:09,676
Wait a minute.

1475
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:12,014
Nancy's coming
with me tonight.

1476
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:13,211
What?
Yeah.

1477
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:15,521
And you promised me 50 dames
if I let the show run!

1478
01:28:15,523 --> 01:28:19,322
Yeah, I promised you 50 dames,
but she's 51 on the team.

1479
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:20,655
You scum, you!

1480
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:21,827
You wash me up with Ethel

1481
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:24,230
and now you bust up
my night off, and well...

1482
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:26,465
Well, just try
and ask me for
a favor sometime.

1483
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:27,900
Yes, I'll ask you
for a favor!

1484
01:28:27,902 --> 01:28:29,869
I'll ask you for
a favor right now!
Shut up! Shut up!

1485
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:31,804
Get out of the building,
you're bothering me!

1486
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:35,308
Take that big
mallet-head of yours
and get out of here, please!

1487
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:39,006
Cops hanging around a theater
give it a bad name. Go away!

1488
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,514
You are beginning
to smell up the place!

1489
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:42,504
(LAUGHS)

1490
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:47,350
Well, Nancy,
what shall we do?

1491
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:49,246
Oh! Mr. Ellery!

1492
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:51,853
Uh-oh. Come on,
let's do it.
