causing such complete paralysis.

1214
02:13:04,150 --> 02:13:08,519
Mind your own business.
You buy that man some pants.

1215
02:13:08,688 --> 02:13:10,815
Just set her down here
on the couch, please.

1216
02:13:10,990 --> 02:13:13,254
On my side, please.

1217
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:15,450
Thank you. Now everyone out.

1218
02:13:15,628 --> 02:13:17,858
-Yes, everybody out. Everybody.
-You too, Papa.

1219
02:13:18,030 --> 02:13:20,362
Me too; Okay, all right.

1220
02:13:22,702 --> 02:13:26,570
-Hurry, Mama.
-Oh, Patti, honey.

1221
02:13:26,973 --> 02:13:32,036
Darling, a surgical corset!

1222
02:13:32,211 --> 02:13:35,112
Your father ought to have
his head examined.

1223
02:13:35,281 --> 02:13:37,476
-There.
-Oh!

1224
02:13:37,650 --> 02:13:40,517
Oh, Mama, how would he know;

1225
02:13:40,686 --> 02:13:43,587
ln other words,
l should have picked it out.

1226
02:13:43,756 --> 02:13:45,951
You're a woman, Mother.

1227
02:13:48,861 --> 02:13:52,627
KATHERlNE:
And so are you, my baby.

1228
02:13:54,166 --> 02:13:56,726
Tomorrow we'll get you
a La Belle Mode corset.

1229
02:13:56,903 --> 02:13:57,927
We will;

1230
02:13:58,104 --> 02:14:00,572
Unless you'd rather have
a whalebone wasp waist.

1231
02:14:00,740 --> 02:14:03,208
-Oh, Mother.
-But as for my new dress....

1232
02:14:03,376 --> 02:14:05,708
Oh, l didn't hurt it, honest.

1233
02:14:05,878 --> 02:14:09,405
You wear it much better than l ever did.
l think you better keep it.

1234
02:14:09,582 --> 02:14:12,483
Besides, don't tell Papa,
but l can't get into it anymore.

1235
02:14:12,652 --> 02:14:14,586
Oh, Mama.

1236
02:14:16,022 --> 02:14:19,480
l'd like permission to call on your daughter
when we get back to the city.

1237
02:14:19,659 --> 02:14:20,683
What for;

1238
02:14:20,860 --> 02:14:24,387
-Well, to get to know her better.
-Seems to me you know her well enough.

1239
02:14:24,563 --> 02:14:25,825
All this kissing, bending.

1240
02:14:25,998 --> 02:14:29,161
lt is customary in my country
to ask permission to call...

1241
02:14:29,335 --> 02:14:31,166
...when a man's intentions are serious.

1242
02:14:31,337 --> 02:14:33,828
You may call, Demi.
We'll be very happy to see you.

1243
02:14:34,006 --> 02:14:35,598
-Look, this man's trying--
-l know.

1244
02:14:35,775 --> 02:14:38,266
-But this is my daughter.
-Papa.

1245
02:14:38,444 --> 02:14:42,005
Don't you think it's about time
you two stopped acting like children ;

1246
02:14:42,181 --> 02:14:45,878
Why, the way you're behaving,
the kids aren't getting any sleep.

1247
02:14:51,757 --> 02:14:53,588
KATHERlNE:
Patti.

1248
02:14:56,862 --> 02:14:59,057
Oh, Mama.

1249
02:15:05,338 --> 02:15:08,136
Well, look at that.
l walked the floor with her...

1250
02:15:08,307 --> 02:15:11,470
...brought her through sickness,
helped her with her homework...

1251
02:15:11,644 --> 02:15:14,704
...and worried and worried
about her happiness.

1252
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:16,541
And now what do l do;

1253
02:15:16,716 --> 02:15:19,048
l walk into a church,
and when the preacher asks:

1254
02:15:19,218 --> 02:15:21,880
''Who gives this woman to this man ;''

1255
02:15:22,054 --> 02:15:26,286
l stand up like a fool and say, ''l do.''

1256
02:15:26,459 --> 02:15:31,055
Papa, my father was no fool.

1257
02:16:01,027 --> 02:16:03,018
