<i>Previously on "Vikings"...</i>

2
00:00:01,936 --> 00:00:04,452
KING HORIK: Earl Ragnar,
you seem to forget I am king.

3
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:06,654
JARL BORG:
Ragnar Lothbrok wants to be king.

4
00:00:06,755 --> 00:00:09,323
His fame eclipses even yours.

5
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:13,160
SIGGY: I'm supposed to be eternally
grateful to my husband's killer.

6
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:16,130
Everything that I was
has been stripped away from me.

7
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:18,332
I want my old position back.

8
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:21,669
I helped Ragnar rise
and now he is earl.

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,970
Earl Ragnar.

10
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:27,308
And our little world waits upon him
and eats from his hand.

11
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:31,312
King Horik understands the gods
better than Ragnar.

12
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:33,114
There is something about him.

13
00:00:33,215 --> 00:00:35,049
RAGNAR:
You talk about trust. You!

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,284
FLOKI:
I am a trustworthy person.

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,422
KING HORIK: We know the things
we like and those we hate.

16
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:43,691
I have a proposition to put to you.

We have a child, Helga.

42

Yes, we have a child.

- FLOKI: A girl!

You did not come,
so I brought her to see you.

A girl!

46
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:49,149
- I don't want to drop her.
- You won't drop her.

47
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:52,453
(Baby coos quietly,
geese honk nearby)

48
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,457
A girl...

49
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,063
A beautiful, beautiful girl.

50
00:03:03,164 --> 00:03:05,466
How is it possible?

51
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:08,569
(Baby fusses)

52
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:13,941

Angrboda.

- The name of Loki's first wife?
- Yes, yes.

58
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:34,194
But she's...

59
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:36,864
What's wrong with that?

60
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:40,301
They thought she was evil.
They had monstrous offspring.

61
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:45,139
She was a great giantess, Helga!

62

Will you come back with us?

63
00:03:51,746 --> 00:03:54,882
Will you get to know your daughter?

64
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:59,486
No. I have to stay in Kattegat.

65
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:03,257
But you, you must go home.

66

Can't I stay awhile...

67
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:09,229
You don't understand, Helga!
You have to leave!

Are you well?

85

GUNNHILD:
Yes, all of us are well now.

86

KING HORIK: Come! Come, family!
I want you to meet Ragnar. Huh?

87

and all your family gathered,

94
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:56,369
let me properly present to you
my wife, Gunnhild,

95
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,537
and my children.

96
00:05:57,638 --> 00:05:59,439
(Cheering and applause)

97
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,508
KING HORIK: Ragnar,
you and I have formed an alliance

98
00:06:01,609 --> 00:06:04,511
on which the future of our country

99
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:06,379
and its people depends.

100
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:07,948
In this endeavor,

101
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:11,418
I see you more than ever as an equal.

102
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,286
(Murmurs of agreement)

103
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:16,623
Between us...
and, of course Earl Ingstad...

104
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:19,526
we have already accomplished so much.

105
00:06:19,627 --> 00:06:21,895
We have land and opportunity
in Wessex...

106
00:06:21,996 --> 00:06:23,530
(Cheers erupt)

107
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,866
But that is only the beginning.

108
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,869
We know already there are
many other worlds to discover,

109
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,004
and we shall do so together,

110
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:36,009
united even more
by the bonds of family...

111
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,844
for you have many sons

112
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:40,480
and, as you can see,
I have many daughters.

113
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:43,583
(Laughter erupts)

114
00:06:43,684 --> 00:06:46,353
It is our custom to celebrate
such an alliance

115
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:50,657
as the gods celebrated theirs...
with feasting and with pledges.

116
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:53,593
- TOWNSFOLK: (Cheers erupt)
- TORSTEIN: Yeah!

117

(Hall buzzes with chatter and music)

118
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:05,639
GUNNHILD: You must be the famous
shield-maiden Lagertha.

119
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,841
LAGERTHA:
Oh, you are more famous, Gunnhild.

120
00:07:08,242 --> 00:07:09,609
The poets talk of your exploits.

121
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,078
They tell how you killed
Swein Forkbeard

122
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:13,546
when he invaded Gotaland.

123
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:16,883
GUNNHILD: And they say that you are
now an earl in your own right!

124
00:07:16,984 --> 00:07:19,118
How did it happen?

125
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,689
LAGERTHA: I killed my husband
when he invaded me.

126
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,959
GUNNHILD AND LAGERTHA:
(Laugh)

127

128
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:45,245
- KING HORIK: What is it?
- FLOKI: Don't you remember?

129
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:48,548
You were going to put
a proposition for me?

130
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:50,650
KING HORIK:
Was I?

131
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:54,187
FLOKI:
Yes! And I am still waiting!

132
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:56,289
HORIK:
The thing is, Floki,

133
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,728
I'm not entirely sure I can trust you.

134
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,665
WOMAN: Over here!
I have something for you!

135
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:06,866
MAN:
Bring it with you!

136
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:09,035
(Angry grunt)

137
00:08:12,773 --> 00:08:15,975
(Celebratory cheers, bells jingle)

138
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:19,245
BJORN:
Porunn,

139
00:08:19,346 --> 00:08:22,148
you are a free woman now.

140
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:24,083
What will you do with your freedom?

141
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:28,221
I will use it to choose.

142
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:32,025
- BJORN: To choose what?
- PORUNN: You don't understand.

143
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:35,228
When I was a slave, I loved you.

144
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:39,832
You were the first to treat me
as if I was not a slave.

145
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:43,303
But now, I have choices.

146
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,575
There are plenty of other women here.

147
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:52,578
That is your first mistake.

148
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,684
(Low hum of chatter,
retreating footsteps)

149
00:09:00,354 --> 00:09:03,156
(Wild cheers fill the hall,
music plays)

150
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:07,260
CROWD:
Hey! Hey! (Laughter)

151
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:16,269
(Boisterous chatter and laughter)

152
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:20,606
FLOKI:
Ah, Torstein...

153
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,209
Up to your usual tricks I see.

154
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,270
TORSTEIN: These two beautiful women
approached me.

155
00:09:25,346 --> 00:09:29,015
They chose you for the size
of your silver pouch

156
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:30,183
and nothing else.

157
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:32,151
TORSTEIN:
I don't think about it too much.

158
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:35,955
If these women don't love me,
(scoffs) what do I care?

159
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:39,158
They will still make me happy.

160
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:42,128
WOMAN:
Here! Have some more!

161
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:44,230
WOMEN:
(Laugh)

162
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:48,768
(Cheering and laughter)

163
00:09:50,304 --> 00:09:51,904
KING HORIK:
Siggy.

164
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:54,807
SIGGY:
I am pleased to see you.

165
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:57,910
I would like to know your plans
while you are here.

166
00:09:58,012 --> 00:10:02,015
KING HORIK: My wife is here,
and my children are here.

167
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:04,017
That's all you need to know.

168
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:07,053
MAN:
You again! You again!

169
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:09,589
(Music plays,
people converse and laugh)

170
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,861
(Celebratory shouts and laughter)

171
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:27,040
Why did you come back, priest?

172
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:29,275
Nobody wants you here.

173
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:33,312
You betrayed the gods!

174
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:36,949
You betrayed all of us.

175
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:40,686
It's your fault Rollo's going to die.

176
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,195
(Nauseous grunts)

177
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:57,203
(Ale pours into cup)

178
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:06,546
KING HORIK:
Forgive me, Floki.

179
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:10,716
I know I should trust you,
but I need proof.

180
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:12,552
- FLOKI: Proof?
- KING HORIK: Yes.

181
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:14,320
Prove to me I can trust you.

182
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:16,556
Prove to me you are on my side.

183
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:18,825
How can I prove it?

184
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:22,161
Kill someone. Someone who matters.

185
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:30,670
(Boisterous laughter and chatter)

186
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:32,071
MAN:
(Laughs heartily)

187
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,874
(Bells jingle)

188
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:41,047
(Boisterous laughter and chatter)

189
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:46,853
(Goblet clatters)

190
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,360
(Boisterous chatter and laughter)

191
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:02,869
(Bells jingle)

192
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:07,974
(Liquid splashes, Aslaug laughs)

193
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:14,324
(Coin clinks,
all groan in disappointment)

194
00:12:14,348 --> 00:12:16,349
BJORN:
Erlendur!

195
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:20,219
(Coin clinks,
all groan in disappointment)

196
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,722
BJORN:
Take your time, Torstein.

197
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:25,558
(Coin clinks,
all groan in disappointment)

198
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:28,694
MAN:
You missed it!

199
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:30,195
- (Coin thumps in bucket)
- FLOKI: Yeah!

200
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:32,265
(Men groan and laugh)

201
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:38,771
(Coin tings and clinks,
surprised shouts and laughter)

202
00:12:38,872 --> 00:12:40,873
(Laughter echoes)

203
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:54,187
(Muted sound of coin clinking)

204
00:12:56,356 --> 00:12:59,025
(Muted sound of coin clinking)

205
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:02,161
(Muted groans and laughter)

206
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:04,797
MAN: (Muted shout)
Floki!

207
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:17,777
(Water laps gently,
footsteps crunch in the sand)

208
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:21,581
KING HORIK:
(Sharp inhale, exhales slowly)

209
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:25,618
Have you made up your mind?

210
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:28,154
Yes.

211
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:33,659
I know who I will kill.

212
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,832
(Ominous music)

213
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,980
(Grunts of effort)

214
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,083
(Woodpecker pecks in the distance)

215
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:57,119
(Seabird cries)

216
00:13:58,221 --> 00:14:00,822
(Grunts)

217
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,858
(Sniffs)

218
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,962
(Leaves and dirt crunch underfoot)

219
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,635
(Slices)

220
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:15,737
(Sniffs)

221
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:23,278
(Leaves and dirt crunch underfoot)

222
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:25,914
BJORN: Next summer,
I say we should return to Wessex,

223
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,283
claim our land from King Ecbert.

224
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:32,888
Those who wish to farm should do so,
and divide the land between them.

225
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:34,890
KING HORIK:
What should the rest of us do, hmm?

226
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:37,826
Those who do not wish to be farmers.

227
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:40,996
BJORN: Those can join King Ecbert
and Princess Kwenthrith

228
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,765
in the battle for Mercia.

229
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,801
I am sure they will be rewarded well.

230
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:47,769
KING HORIK:
I agree with you.

231
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,172
I think we should claim the land,

232
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:53,608
but I do not like the idea
of being Ecbert's handmaiden.

233
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:54,976
I still have a score
to settle with him

234
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:57,913
and unlike Ragnar,
I do not trust him.

235
00:14:58,014 --> 00:15:01,216
ERLENDUR: But isn't it best to test him
to see if he is honest?

236
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,785
ATHELSTAN:
I believe he is telling the truth.

237
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:07,122
LAGERTHA:
Then you are still innocent.

238
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:08,790
KING HORIK:
So you agree with me?

239
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:11,960
LAGERTHA: No. I agree that those
who wish to farm should do so

240
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:17,065
and also ask
for King Ecbert's protection.

241
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,241
But for some of us,
those of us who still want to raid,

242
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,204
we will go elsewhere,

243
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:25,307
explore and discover new places.

244
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,745
(Door creaks open,
goat bleats outside)

245
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:34,182
(Door creaks closed,
footsteps approach)

246
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:38,053
SIGGY:
(Relieved sigh)

247
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:41,156
(Goats bleat outside)

248
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:46,595
FLOKI:
How is he?

249
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,598
SIGGY:
He's alive.

250
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:53,168
Will he ever walk again?

251
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:55,737
Only the gods know.

252
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:58,840
(Fire crackles nearby)

253
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:06,982
(Laboured breath)

254
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:11,853
Do you watch over him
day and night?

255
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:18,860
Listen.
I'll stay with him for a while.

256
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:20,595
- FLOKI: You get some sleep.
- SIGGY: No, I...

257
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:23,698
Go get some sleep, Siggy.

258
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,169
You deserve it. I will watch him.

259
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,239
Thank you.

260
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:53,328
ROLLO:
(Laboured breath)

261
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:59,868
You put me in a bed
like this once, Rollo.

262
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:02,637
Do you remember?

263
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:05,073
(Dog barks in the distance)

264
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:09,911
(Sighs heavily)

265
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:16,017
I brought you something.

266
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:20,222
Look!

267
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:23,992
It's the food of the gods.

268
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:29,764
Eat!

269
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:32,867
ROLLO:
(Struggling grunts)

270
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:39,774
(Gulping and gasping)

271
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,110
(Chewing)

272
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:53,388
(Hard thump, Rollo gasps for breath)

273
00:18:02,865 --> 00:18:06,868
(Hall buzzes with chatter
and laughter)

274
00:18:11,741 --> 00:18:13,608
CHILDREN:
(Playful laughter)

275
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:17,979
- GIRL: Catch me again!
- MAN: I'm warning you!

276
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,081
FLOKI:
Ubbe!

277
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,918
Give this gift to Torstein.

278
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,923
Say that they are
from his good friend Floki.

279
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,526
Oh! And one more thing.

280
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:35,897
You must never tell anyone
that it was me who gave them to him.

281
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:39,567
That must be our secret.
Do you agree?

282
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:43,238
Good. Because if you don't
keep this secret,

283
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:46,541
something terrible will happen to you.

284
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,810
Do you know what will happen?

285
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:50,745
I'll tell you.

286
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:54,616
When the God Loki had done
something terribly bad,

287
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,986
the other gods took him
to a nasty dark cave.

288
00:18:58,087 --> 00:19:02,223
And there they chained him
on three sharp rocks,

289
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:06,227
and above him
they fastened a vile snake

290
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:10,031
so that its poison would
drip, drip, drip

291
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:13,068
forever on Loki's face.

292
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:16,671
Now, you wouldn't want that
to happen to you, would you?

293
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:24,045
Well, go and give my present
to Torstein,

294
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:26,781
but keep the secret.

295
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:30,885
(Boisterous chatter and laughter)

296
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:45,867
(Ominous music plays)

297
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:50,939
(Boisterous chatter and laughter)

298
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:10,024
BJORN:
My friend Torstein has been murdered.

299
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,192
I swear by all the gods,

300
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,028
whoever did this
will pay a heavy price.

301
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,131
(Women weep)

302
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,635
FLOKI:
We'll find the guilty one!

303
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:23,705
And we shall flay the skin
from his body

304
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,008
and use horses to tear him apart!

305
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:28,910
(Sobs)

306
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,082
(Torch fire crackles)

307
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:40,321
(Thunder rumbles, loud thunderclap)

308
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:43,224
KING HORIK:
You did well.

309
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,326
(Floki unsheathes a knife)

310
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:48,430
Now I know I can trust you.

311
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:57,145
FLOKI:
So, what is your plan?

312
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:59,908
I will kill them all.

313
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,143
- FLOKI: All?
- KING HORIK: Yes, all.

314
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:04,579
- FLOKI: Ragnar?
- KING HORIK: Of course Ragnar.

315
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,948
And Lagertha, and Aslaug.

316
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:09,284
All of them.
All their bastard children.

317
00:21:09,385 --> 00:21:12,687
I will wipe his family
from the face of the earth.

318
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:14,522
(Thunder booms and rumbles)

319
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,927
And Bjorn? What of Bjorn?

320
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:23,765
Bjorn Ironside.
He is difficult to kill.

321
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,534
Perhaps the gods are protecting him.

322
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:29,103
You must find a way to kill him.

323
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,772
I have no doubt you will manage.

324
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,208
I know you will manage.

325
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:35,076
(Thunder booms and rumbles)

326
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:36,644
FLOKI:
When?

327
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:38,646
(Thunder rumbles, rain pours down)

328
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:40,748
Tomorrow.

329
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,017
Be prepared, my friend.

330
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:47,121

(Thunder booms and rumbles)

336

The gods are coming.

337
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:28,481
I know.

338
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:31,417
(Thunder rumbles,
wind whips violently)

339
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:35,288
- (Meat sizzles)

340
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:39,559
(Marketplace buzzes with chatter)

341
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:41,561
- VENDOR: Two more?
- MAN: Yeah, two more.

342
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:46,632
(Marketplace buzzes with chatter)

343
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:49,468
VENDOR:
How many do you want?

344
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,838
BJORN:
Porunn.

345
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:54,340
(Sighs)
Forgive me for what I said.

346
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:57,944
I don't want other women.
I want you.

347
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,879
What do you want from me?

348
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,914
PORUNN:
Respect.

349
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:04,884
BJORN: You know I respect you.
I worship you.

350
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:07,220
PORUNN:
I don't want to be worshipped.

351
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:11,090
I spent my life as a slave.
Your words are ridiculous.

352
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,493
BJORN:
What can I do?

353
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:16,829
You can fight me.

354
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:20,166
- Fight you?
- Yes.

355
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:25,938

00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:50,229
Oww!

360
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:54,166
(Seething)
It's no use!

361
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,069
Don't give up.

362
00:23:57,137 --> 00:24:00,139
ROLLO:
(Breathing heavily)

363
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:07,513
What do you care if I give up or not?

364
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,891
Do you want an honest answer?

365
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,860
I don't know.

366
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:25,464
But I think you might
still be useful somehow.

367
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:28,935
To whom?

368
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:32,038
(Fire crackles)

369
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,647

(Marketplace buzzes with chatter)

372
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:53,459
Shouldn't you be with your wife?

373
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,161
Doesn't she have need of you?

374
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:57,263
- KING HORIK: Don't play games.
- SIGGY: There are no more games.

375
00:24:57,364 --> 00:25:01,067
KING HORIK: Yes, there is,
and this is the final one.

376
00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:05,237
You once promised you would
tell me Ragnar's weaknesses.

377
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:07,506
I don't ever remember you
delivering on that promise.

378
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:09,742
SIGGY: Well, you wasted
all your seed on a promise.

379
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,578
KING HORIK:
Tell me now.

380
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:17,984
SIGGY:
Is it not obvious?

381
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:22,288
Ragnar's weakness is his children.

382
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,827
Then this is what you must do.

383
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:30,863
You must go to the Great Hall
at sunset

384
00:25:30,931 --> 00:25:35,201
and you must kill
Ragnar's young sons.

385
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:42,975
What do I get in return?

386
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:45,211
I will marry you.

387
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:48,314
Gunnhild is my only wife
at the moment.

388
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:50,349
I will take a second.

389
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,818
I will make you a queen.

390
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:58,024
You will rule again, as you once did.

391
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:16,375

00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,864
(Foliage rustles underfoot)

395
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,767
- PORUNN: Ungh! Ungh!
- BJORN: Agh!

396
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:43,436
BJORN:
What was that?

397
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:45,337
(Grunts of effort, landing thuds)

398
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:48,441
(Breathing heavily)

399
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,878
(Hard punches, Porunn gasps in pain)

400
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:56,749
BJORN:
Porunn! Please, stop.

401
00:26:56,817 --> 00:26:58,484
PORUNN:
Please what?

402
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:01,520
(Fighting grunts)

403
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:04,990
(Laboured breaths)

404
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:08,094

and heavy landing thuds)

406
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:20,249
- BJORN: (In pain) Agghhh!
- PORUNN: Ungh!

407
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:22,775
PORUNN:
Aggghhhhhhh!

408
00:27:22,876 --> 00:27:25,411
- (Hard blow)
- Ungh!

409
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:30,416
(Running footsteps)

410
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:32,518
Porunn!

411
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,361
Porunn, I'm sorry!

412
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,533
It was an accident!

413
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:51,804
Porunn! Where are you?

414
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:53,105
Porunn!

415
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:56,542

00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:59,338
(Foliage rustles underfoot)

(Dogs bark in the distance)

430
00:30:06,217 --> 00:30:09,086
KING HORIK:
This is the Sword of Kings.

431
00:30:09,187 --> 00:30:11,688
One day, if the gods will it,

432
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:15,225
this sword will belong to you.

433
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:21,331
Today we must do
something extraordinary.

434
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:23,800
We must overcome the magic
of Ragnar Lothbrok,

435
00:30:23,901 --> 00:30:27,237
which threatens our power
and survival.

436
00:30:27,338 --> 00:30:31,541
The gods have spoken,
and I have listened.

437
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:34,378
We must cut and kill in such a frenzy
none can survive.

438
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:38,115
For, believe me, if even one
of that family survives,

439
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:42,352
then the day will come when
he will rise again and destroy us.

440
00:30:45,156 --> 00:30:48,425
Put yourself in the hands
of the gods, do their will.

441
00:30:48,526 --> 00:30:52,429
And then, for certain,
they will grant you this sword,

442
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,531
and a kingdom.

443
00:31:00,738 --> 00:31:02,272

to your God.

448
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:31,802
Will you teach me one of your prayers,

449
00:31:31,903 --> 00:31:33,904
so I can learn?

450

Our Father, who art in Heaven...

451
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:06,269

Hallowed be thy name.

453

and forgive us our trespasses,

459

as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

460

RAGNAR:
And forgive us our trespasses,

461

- (Ivar cries)
- SIGGY: Boys! Come with me!

463

ATHELSTAN:
And lead us not into temptation,

464
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:46,610
but deliver us from Evil.

465
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:49,846
Forever and ever, amen.

466
00:33:00,491 --> 00:33:03,493
Forever and ever...

467
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:12,269

Amen.
