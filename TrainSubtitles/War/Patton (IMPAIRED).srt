00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:29,088
I'm staying here
as an observer,

167
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:31,132
but I report
directly to Ike.

168
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,394
A spy.

169
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:35,936
Get me General Eisenhower's
headquarters.

170
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:40,106
Tell me, Brad, uh...

171
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:41,972
what happened
at Kasserine?

172
00:19:42,043 --> 00:19:43,635
I heard it was
a shamble.

173
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:46,078
Apparently,
everything went wrong.

174
00:19:46,147 --> 00:19:48,809
We'd send over
a 75-millimeter shell,

175
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,817
the Krauts would
return an 88.

176
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:52,318
Their tanks are diesels.

177
00:19:52,387 --> 00:19:54,787
And even when we managed
to hit them,

178
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:56,289
they kept on running.

179
00:19:56,357 --> 00:19:57,949
Our tanks...

180
00:19:58,026 --> 00:20:00,460
the men call them
"Purple Heart boxes."

181
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:03,463
One hot piece of shrapnel
and the gasoline explodes.

182
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:05,965
Hmm. I warned them
about the tank.

183
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:08,969
I talked to a soldier
about the half-tracks.

184
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:11,471
I asked if
the machine gun bullets

185
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:12,972
pierce the armor,

186
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,440
and he said, " No, sir.

187
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:16,943
The bullets just
come through one side

188
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,672
and rattle around
a bit."

189
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:20,374
I understand
we had trouble

190
00:20:20,448 --> 00:20:21,881
coordinating
the air cover.

191
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,884
The trouble was
no air cover.

192
00:20:23,952 --> 00:20:26,318
General Smith
on the line, sir.

193
00:20:26,387 --> 00:20:27,581
Excuse me, Brad.

194

Bill?

195
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:37,732
Listen, I'm calling
about, uh, Bradley

196
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,790
and his job here.

197
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:42,234
Look, I need a good
number-two man.

198
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:45,704
I want to make Brad
my deputy commander.

199
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:48,675
You'll clear it
with Ike?

200
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:49,801
Thanks, Bill.

201
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:52,403
Now you're not spying
for Eisenhower anymore.

202

You're working for me.

- Fine, O.K.

Dick... you've
got those stars?

205
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:03,580
- Yes, sir.
- Let's get them on.

206
00:21:15,503 --> 00:21:17,027
What's the matter, Brad?

207
00:21:17,105 --> 00:21:19,073
I've been nominated
by the president.

208
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,938
I know, but, uh,
it doesn't become official

209
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,001
until it's approved
by the Senate.

210
00:21:24,078 --> 00:21:27,479
Well... they have
their schedule,

George...

if you were named admiral
of the Turkish Navy,

214
00:21:38,693 --> 00:21:40,126
I believe your aides

215
00:21:40,195 --> 00:21:41,753
could dip
into their haversacks

216
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,799
and come up with
the appropriate badge of rank.

217
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:47,027
Anyway, congratulations...

218

premature
congratulations.

You know...

220
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:54,807
I think those stars
would look better

on a green shirt.

222

Did I ever tell you
about the time

223
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,940
I designed a uniform
for tank crewmen?

224
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:06,282
It was, uh, green leather,
had red stripes,

225
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:09,289
and had sort of
a row of brass buttons

226

down across here.

227

And topped off by
a gold football helmet.

228
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:17,955
The army rejected it,
of course.

229
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:19,693
Goddamn, it was beautiful.

George...

233
00:22:58,239 --> 00:22:59,672
there's one other thing

234
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:01,675
I put
in my Kasserine report.

235
00:23:01,743 --> 00:23:05,474
Some of our boys were
just plain scared.

236
00:23:05,546 --> 00:23:07,480
Well, that's
understandable.

237

Even the best foxhound's
gun-shy the first time out.

238
00:23:10,351 --> 00:23:12,444
I can remember...

239
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,454
when nothing
frightened me as much

240
00:23:14,522 --> 00:23:17,457
as the idea of a bullet
coming for my nose.

241
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:18,958
I don't know why,

242
00:23:19,027 --> 00:23:22,224
but the image of a bullet
coming for my nose

243
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:25,027
was more horrible than
any other possibility.

244
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:26,964
Well, I can understand
that, George.

245
00:23:27,035 --> 00:23:28,662
It was such
a handsome nose.

246
00:23:28,736 --> 00:23:30,670
You want to know
why this outfit

247
00:23:30,738 --> 00:23:32,672
got the hell
kicked out of it?

A blind man could
see it in a minute.

They don't look like soldiers,
they don't act like soldiers.

250
00:23:38,246 --> 00:23:40,714
Why should they be expected
to fight like soldiers?

251
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:42,443
You're
absolutely right.

00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:09,408
The soldiers lay
naked in the sun.

328
00:29:11,912 --> 00:29:14,244
2,000 years ago.

329
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:20,619
I was here.

330
00:29:25,893 --> 00:29:28,361
You don't believe me,
do you, Brad?

331
00:29:30,497 --> 00:29:33,523
You know what
the poet said.

332
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,468
"Through the travail
of ages...

333
00:29:37,538 --> 00:29:41,269
amidst the pomp
and toils of war...

334
00:29:41,341 --> 00:29:46,244
have I fought and strove
and perished...

335
00:29:46,313 --> 00:29:48,838
countless times
upon the star.

336
00:29:53,654 --> 00:29:57,556
As if through a glass
and darkly...

337
00:29:57,624 --> 00:30:01,754
the age-old strife
I see...

338
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:06,163
where I fought in many guises,
many names...

339
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:08,167
but always me."

340
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:16,868
You know who
the poet was?

341
00:30:19,613 --> 00:30:21,376
Me.

342
00:32:29,607 --> 00:32:31,438
There's an opportunity
here now,

343
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:32,942
for us to mount
an offensive.

344
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:35,946
We've concentrated on harassing
the enemy's flank,

345
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:37,948
draw strength
away from the British.

346
00:32:38,016 --> 00:32:39,449
However, it appears now,

347
00:32:39,517 --> 00:32:41,951
that we could split
the Afrika Korps

348
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,318
and drive through
Rommel to the sea.

349
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:46,823
Sorry, Mel, but that
territory's been reserved

350
00:32:46,891 --> 00:32:48,825
for General Sir
Bernard Law Montgomery.

351
00:32:48,893 --> 00:32:50,827
We're supposed
to let him win

352
00:32:50,895 --> 00:32:52,920
no matter how long
it takes him.

353
00:32:52,997 --> 00:32:54,931
They're entitled
to have their hero.

354
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:56,933
After all, Montgomery
did push Rommel

355
00:32:57,001 --> 00:32:58,696
clear across
North Africa.

356
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,761
What about
the Americans?

357
00:33:00,838 --> 00:33:03,068
Don't they...
need a hero, too?

358

You have anybody
in mind, George?

Excuse me, sir.

360
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:11,240
Air Vice-Marshal Coningham
is here with General Buford.

361

Excuse me, gentlemen, while
I ask our British friends

362

to our air cover.

363

Uh, George, you know

- Sure.
- Delighted to see you, General.

368

I've heard
so much about you.

369
00:33:38,376 --> 00:33:40,344
Gentlemen,
it appears there's been

370
00:33:40,411 --> 00:33:42,345
some slight
misunderstanding here,

371
00:33:42,413 --> 00:33:45,405
and Ike thought we ought to
get it straightened it out.

372
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:46,950
No. No misunderstanding.

373
00:33:47,018 --> 00:33:49,452
We're supposed to have
Allied air cover,

374
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,454
and we don't get it.

375
00:33:51,522 --> 00:33:53,649
German planes are
strafing my troops.

376
00:33:53,725 --> 00:33:55,659
If I may say so, General,

377
00:33:55,727 --> 00:33:58,457
I'm afraid your operations
reports are inaccurate.

378
00:33:58,529 --> 00:33:59,791
Reports?

379
00:33:59,864 --> 00:34:04,301
The Krauts chased my command car
into a ditch.

380
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:07,133
My staff has assured me
we have complete air supremacy

381
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:09,139
everywhere
in the Mediterranean.

382
00:34:09,207 --> 00:34:11,937
When I complained about
lack of air cover,

383
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:14,341
you said our troops
were not battle-worthy.

384
00:34:14,412 --> 00:34:16,846
You spoke of the, uh,
discredited practice

385
00:34:16,914 --> 00:34:19,348
of using air force
as an alibi

386
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:21,351
for lack of success
on the ground.

387
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:24,183
It's bad enough I have
to wet-nurse Montgomery.

388
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:26,280
I don't have
to stand for that.

389
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:29,383
I sincerely apologize
for that remark...

390

391
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:34,530
and I promise you
one thing, General.

392
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:37,363
You will see
no more German planes.

393
00:34:48,246 --> 00:34:52,706
You were discussing air
supremacy, Sir Arthur?

Get back in here,

We need
a corps commander,

manage to stage that?

in iambic pentameter.

A challenge
in two stanzas

416
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:08,200
to meet me out there,
alone in the desert.

417

I'll deliver it.

418

Rommel in his tank
and me in mine.

419
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,687
We'd stop
about 20 paces.

420
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,383
We'd get out
and shake hands.

421
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:23,392
Then we'd button up
and we'd do battle,

00:54:10,404 --> 00:54:13,237
American G.I. S and Tommies
of the British 8th Army

488
00:54:13,307 --> 00:54:15,241
meet in an Allied
victory celebration

489
00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:17,504
at Wadi Akarit
in North Africa.

490
00:54:17,578 --> 00:54:20,138
For the first time
in this war,

491
00:54:20,214 --> 00:54:22,648
Broadway and Piccadilly
join hands.

492
00:54:25,686 --> 00:54:29,645
Meanwhile, General Montgomery,
hero of El-Alamein,

493
00:54:29,723 --> 00:54:31,156
continues to lead
his veteran

494
00:54:31,225 --> 00:54:33,159
and victorious
British 8th Army

495
00:54:33,227 --> 00:54:34,660
in a relentless drive

496
00:54:34,728 --> 00:54:36,662
against Rommel's
vaunted Afrika Korps.

497
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,954
General Bradley's
done a tremendous job

498
00:56:42,022 --> 00:56:43,455
with 2nd Corps.

499
00:56:43,523 --> 00:56:44,888
He's moved
into Bizerte

500
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:46,721
and taken over
41,000 prisoners.

501
00:56:46,793 --> 00:56:48,317
Good, very good.

502
00:56:48,395 --> 00:56:50,420
You're not surprised,
are you, General?

503
00:56:50,497 --> 00:56:52,931
After all,
you trained that outfit.

504
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:58,603
Uh, excuse me,
General.

505
00:56:58,672 --> 00:56:59,604
Hmm?

506
00:56:59,673 --> 00:57:01,607
Sir,
this is interesting.

507
00:57:01,675 --> 00:57:03,905
We've discovered Rommel
wasn't present at El Guettar.

508
00:57:03,977 --> 00:57:05,410
Who says so?

509
00:57:05,479 --> 00:57:07,413
G-2, sir.

510
00:57:07,481 --> 00:57:10,416
Are they telling me that
when we took on 10th Panzer,

511
00:57:10,484 --> 00:57:12,918
Rommel was in Berlin
with an earache?

512
00:57:12,986 --> 00:57:14,920
Severe nasal
diphtheria, sir.

513
00:57:14,988 --> 00:57:18,651
G-2 also reports that Hitler
probably retained Rommel in Berlin

514
00:57:18,725 --> 00:57:21,319
'cause things were going badly
for the Afrika Korps.

515
00:57:21,395 --> 00:57:23,761
He didn't want his favorite general
to lose face.

516
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:25,764
Well,
I'm my favorite general.

517
00:57:25,832 --> 00:57:28,266
I don't like some second-stringer
being up against me.

518
00:57:28,335 --> 00:57:30,303
Then I lose face.

519
00:57:37,678 --> 00:57:40,010
Who the hell
are you anyway?

520
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,012
General,

521
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:43,015
this is Lieutenant
Colonel Codman,

522
00:57:43,083 --> 00:57:44,516
your new aide.

523
00:57:44,584 --> 00:57:47,553
I pulled your name off the list
because I know your family.

524
00:57:47,621 --> 00:57:49,680
I'm glad you did, sir.

525
00:57:49,756 --> 00:57:51,690
Rommel is the best
the Krauts have.

526
00:57:51,758 --> 00:57:53,692
I kicked the hell
out of him.

527
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,194
Now G-2 tells me
he wasn't even there.

528
00:57:56,263 --> 00:57:57,753
But, General,

529
00:57:57,831 --> 00:58:00,925
he undoubtedly planned
the German battle.

530
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:02,434
If you defeat
Rommel's plan,

531
00:58:02,502 --> 00:58:04,470
you've defeated Rommel.

532
00:58:04,538 --> 00:58:06,301
Isn't that true,
sir?

533
00:58:07,374 --> 00:58:09,706
Codman.

534
00:58:09,776 --> 00:58:12,768
- Have a drink with me tonight.
- Yes, sir.

535
00:58:12,846 --> 00:58:15,747
I have a plan for
the invasion of Sicily.

536
00:58:15,816 --> 00:58:19,183
I want to make sure
I get it approved.

537
00:58:19,252 --> 00:58:20,685
You can help me.

538
00:58:20,754 --> 00:58:23,689
I want to give a dinner
for General Alexander,

539
00:58:23,757 --> 00:58:25,691
get to him before
Montgomery does.

540
00:58:25,759 --> 00:58:28,250
This will be strictly
a formal affair,

541
00:58:28,328 --> 00:58:31,161
but, uh, purely social.

542
00:58:31,231 --> 00:58:33,131
By that, I mean,
um, purely political.

543
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,633
Yes, sir.

544
00:58:34,701 --> 00:58:37,636
I want the finest food,
the best wine available,

545
00:58:37,704 --> 00:58:39,137
everything
comme il faut.

546
00:58:39,206 --> 00:58:40,639
Entendu,
mon Général.

547
00:58:40,707 --> 00:58:42,698
Quelque chose
de vraiment spécial.

548
00:58:42,776 --> 00:58:44,209
A va sans dire.

549
00:58:44,277 --> 00:58:45,642
Qui aimeriez-vous
inviter?

550
00:58:45,712 --> 00:58:47,145
Le Maréchal Alexander

551
00:58:47,214 --> 00:58:50,650
et son Chef D'état-major,
peut-être Taylor.

552
00:58:50,717 --> 00:58:54,813
Pas trop de monde,
plutot intime, d'accord?

553
00:58:54,888 --> 00:58:56,515
D'accord, mon Général.

554
00:59:08,235 --> 00:59:10,430
Oh, thank you.

555
00:59:10,504 --> 00:59:13,098
George, this is
a really splendid wine.

556
00:59:13,173 --> 00:59:15,107
Thank you.

557
00:59:17,511 --> 00:59:20,105
Thank you.

558
00:59:22,149 --> 00:59:24,117
I think it was Alcibiades

559
00:59:24,184 --> 00:59:27,620
in the Peloponnesian War,
415 B.C.,

560
00:59:27,687 --> 00:59:29,621
he said if Siracusa falls,

561
00:59:29,689 --> 00:59:32,123
all Sicily falls,
and then Italy.

562
00:59:32,192 --> 00:59:33,625
He knew, you see,

563
00:59:33,693 --> 00:59:35,627
that Syracuse was
the jugular of the island,

564
00:59:35,695 --> 00:59:37,788
and old Alcibiades always
went for the throat.

565
00:59:37,864 --> 00:59:40,856
I propose to take Sicily
in the same way.

566
00:59:40,934 --> 00:59:44,267
I think the old man
has them in his pocket.

567
00:59:47,441 --> 00:59:49,773
According to my plan,

568
00:59:49,843 --> 00:59:53,836
General Montgomery
will land here.

569
00:59:53,914 --> 00:59:56,576
I'll hit the beaches
here, take Palermo.

570
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:58,584
Monty will drive north,
along the coast road.

571
00:59:58,652 --> 01:00:00,586
I'll come due east,
take Messina,

572
01:00:00,654 --> 01:00:03,422
and cut off
the German escape route.

573
01:00:03,555 --> 01:00:06,183
Yes...
Well, it looks like

574
01:00:06,258 --> 01:00:07,725
an interesting plan,
George.

575
01:00:07,793 --> 01:00:11,422
Well, gentlemen,
to the conquest of Sicily.

576
01:00:11,496 --> 01:00:13,430
To the conquest
of Sicily.

577
01:00:13,498 --> 01:00:15,659
[All]
To Sicily!

578
01:00:15,734 --> 01:00:17,258
George, you'd have made

579
01:00:17,335 --> 01:00:19,269
a great marshal
for Napoleon

580
01:00:19,337 --> 01:00:21,703
if you'd lived
in the eighteenth century.

581
01:00:21,773 --> 01:00:24,003
Oh, but I did,
Sir Harold.

582
01:00:24,075 --> 01:00:25,940
I did.

583
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,014
Morning.
Is General Smith in?

584
01:01:04,082 --> 01:01:06,107
I believe he's
in the lavatory.

585
01:01:06,184 --> 01:01:07,344
Thank you.

586
01:01:14,726 --> 01:01:16,455
Ah. There you are,
Bedell.

587
01:01:16,528 --> 01:01:17,654
Monty.

588
01:01:17,729 --> 01:01:19,060
Bedell...

589
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:21,564
I've been giving
a good bit of thought

590
01:01:21,633 --> 01:01:23,567
to the Sicily operation.

591
01:01:23,635 --> 01:01:25,660
I, uh,
I assume we're alone.

592
01:01:25,737 --> 01:01:27,170
You know,
Georgie Patton's

593
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:29,707
already discussed his plan
with Alexander.

594
01:01:29,774 --> 01:01:32,208
I realize that,
but I have an idea

595
01:01:32,277 --> 01:01:34,677
that his plan may lead
to an absolute disaster.

596
01:01:34,746 --> 01:01:36,543
Oh?

597
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:40,680
Bedell, look.

598
01:01:40,752 --> 01:01:44,153
This is Sicily.

599
01:01:44,222 --> 01:01:45,154
Now, then,

600
01:01:45,223 --> 01:01:47,282
according to
Patton's plan,

601
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,089
I would attack
Syracuse here,

602
01:01:50,161 --> 01:01:52,152
and he would attack
Palermo up here.

603
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:54,164
Obviously, our forces
would be divided.

604
01:01:54,232 --> 01:01:56,097
And, just as obviously,

605
01:01:56,167 --> 01:01:58,101
they could be
chopped up piecemeal.

606
01:01:58,169 --> 01:02:00,160
Now, then,
what I propose...

607
01:02:00,238 --> 01:02:03,173
and what I shall insist on,
by the way...

608
01:02:03,241 --> 01:02:05,368
is this.

609
01:02:05,443 --> 01:02:06,501
[Blowing]

610
01:02:06,578 --> 01:02:09,172
I will land at Syracuse,
as planned.

611
01:02:09,247 --> 01:02:10,407
The Americans...

612
01:02:10,482 --> 01:02:13,144
the Americans
will land here at Gela.

613
01:02:13,218 --> 01:02:15,550
I will advance
north to Messina,

614
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:18,384
the Americans
protecting my flank.

615
01:02:18,456 --> 01:02:21,357
After all,
Messina is the key.

616
01:02:21,426 --> 01:02:25,260
It's the reason
for invading Sicily.

617
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:28,891
I'll discuss your plan
with Ike.

618
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:31,367
I'm sure he'll give it
serious consideration.

619
01:02:35,907 --> 01:02:38,501
- Amusing, isn't it?
- What?

620
01:02:38,577 --> 01:02:40,772
That the final plans
for the invasion of Sicily

621
01:02:40,845 --> 01:02:43,780
should have been put forward
in an Algerian lavatory.

622
01:02:43,882 --> 01:02:47,318
George, I've bad news for you
about your Sicily plan.

623
01:02:47,385 --> 01:02:49,319
Ike has turned it down.

624
01:02:49,387 --> 01:02:51,321
He feels that
since the Italians

625
01:02:51,389 --> 01:02:53,323
will be defending
their native soil

626
01:02:53,391 --> 01:02:55,325
for the first time

627
01:02:55,393 --> 01:02:57,418
and since the German
resistance is stiffening,

628
01:02:57,495 --> 01:02:59,895
our forces
shouldn't be divided.

629
01:02:59,965 --> 01:03:01,899
Where do my people land,
then?

630
01:03:01,967 --> 01:03:03,832
In the Gulf of Gela.

631
01:03:03,902 --> 01:03:05,836
What for? There's
only a beach there.

632
01:03:05,904 --> 01:03:08,304
But it puts you
in a good position

633
01:03:08,373 --> 01:03:10,864
to support Montgomery.

634
01:03:10,942 --> 01:03:12,876
And, uh, where does
Montgomery land?

635
01:03:12,944 --> 01:03:14,878
Well,
he'll land at Syracuse

636
01:03:14,946 --> 01:03:17,380
and drive north to Catania,
possibly even Messina.

637
01:03:17,449 --> 01:03:21,146
And you'll be alongside,
protecting his left.

638
01:03:21,219 --> 01:03:24,211
I see.

639
01:03:24,289 --> 01:03:26,723
In other words,
we get the burden again

640
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:28,952
while good old Monty
gets the glory.

641
01:03:29,027 --> 01:03:31,461
Ike had to consider
all points of view.

642
01:03:31,529 --> 01:03:33,963
He made his decision
not as an American

643
01:03:34,032 --> 01:03:36,193
but as an Ally.

644
01:03:36,267 --> 01:03:38,701
Had it been the
other way around,

645
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:40,931
I assure you,
Monty would protest.

646
01:03:41,006 --> 01:03:45,375
You know, I've... been
in the army 30 years.

647
01:03:45,443 --> 01:03:48,378
When I get an order,
I say, "Yes, sir,"

648
01:03:48,446 --> 01:03:52,246
and I do my damnedest
to carry it out.

649
01:03:52,317 --> 01:03:54,012
But...

650
01:03:54,085 --> 01:03:56,019
this is what happens

651
01:03:56,087 --> 01:03:58,021
when your commander
stops being an American

652
01:03:58,089 --> 01:04:01,183
and starts...
being an Ally.

653
01:05:12,397 --> 01:05:15,332
I haven't made
myself clear, sir.

654
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,836
Montgomery met tough
resistance at Catania.

655
01:05:18,903 --> 01:05:19,835
However...

656
01:05:19,904 --> 01:05:21,838
Perfectly clear.

657
01:05:21,906 --> 01:05:26,843
Old Monty is as stuck
as a bug on flypaper.

658
01:05:26,911 --> 01:05:29,243
But this order
from General Alexander

659
01:05:29,314 --> 01:05:31,748
directs you to give up
the Baucina road

660
01:05:31,816 --> 01:05:32,942
to Montgomery.

661
01:05:33,017 --> 01:05:36,248
[Mocking British Accent]
Then Bradley will have to

662
01:05:36,321 --> 01:05:39,757
slug his way up the center
of the island

663
01:05:39,824 --> 01:05:41,758
over those tough
mountain roads.

664
01:05:41,826 --> 01:05:43,760
Yes, sir.

665
01:05:43,828 --> 01:05:45,762
Messina, Bill.

666
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:47,263
Messina!

667
01:05:47,332 --> 01:05:49,266
That's the heart
of it.

668
01:05:49,334 --> 01:05:51,268
If they followed
my plan,

669
01:05:51,336 --> 01:05:52,769
I'd have cut off
the retreat

670
01:05:52,837 --> 01:05:54,828
of every goddamn German
on this island!

671
01:05:55,807 --> 01:05:57,707
Know what I'll do?

672
01:05:57,776 --> 01:05:59,209
First, go to Palermo,

673
01:05:59,277 --> 01:06:01,438
then beat that limey
son of a bitch

674
01:06:01,513 --> 01:06:03,674
if it's the last
thing I do!

675
01:06:03,748 --> 01:06:06,683
What's all this talk
about taking

676
01:06:06,751 --> 01:06:09,686
the Baucina road
away from 2nd Corps?

677
01:06:11,756 --> 01:06:13,690
General Alexander's
orders.

678
01:06:13,758 --> 01:06:15,692
The road goes
to Montgomery.

679
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,695
That road was
assigned to me.

680
01:06:18,763 --> 01:06:21,197
How can I go north
without it?

681
01:06:21,266 --> 01:06:22,699
I'm sorry, Brad,

682
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:24,701
but Monty's run into
tough opposition,

683
01:06:24,769 --> 01:06:26,202
very tough.

684
01:06:26,271 --> 01:06:28,205
Now, you wouldn't be
taking advantage

685
01:06:28,273 --> 01:06:31,299
of this situation,
would you, George?

686
01:06:31,376 --> 01:06:33,310
What are you
talking about?

687
01:06:33,378 --> 01:06:34,811
Without that road,

688
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:38,815
your whole army
would be out of a job.

689
01:06:38,883 --> 01:06:41,078
Free to enter Palermo.

690
01:06:41,152 --> 01:06:44,087
I didn't say anything
about Palermo.

691
01:06:44,155 --> 01:06:47,124
I can read a map.

692
01:06:47,192 --> 01:06:50,161
Does Alexander know
you've pushed this far?

693
01:06:50,228 --> 01:06:53,163
That's a reconnaissance
in force.

694
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,224
George,

695
01:06:57,302 --> 01:07:01,705
I've got to slug it out
over those mountains

696
01:07:01,773 --> 01:07:04,207
with heavy resistance

697
01:07:04,275 --> 01:07:07,733
just so you can make
a bigger splash than Monty?

698
01:07:07,812 --> 01:07:12,272
General, I just
follow my orders,

699
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:15,808
like the simple
old soldier I am.

700
01:07:15,887 --> 01:07:18,355
General.

701
01:07:18,423 --> 01:07:21,859
Sir, General Alexander's
heard we're moving west.

702
01:07:21,926 --> 01:07:23,894
He says here,
"Stop immediately,

703
01:07:23,962 --> 01:07:26,430
go no farther
than Agrigento.

704
01:07:26,497 --> 01:07:28,931
Repeat,
stop immediately."

705
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,458
That's what you think
it says.

706
01:07:32,537 --> 01:07:35,995
I think it was garbled
in transmission.

707
01:07:36,074 --> 01:07:39,043
Ask them to retransmit
the message.

708
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:42,045
That will take
half a day.

709
01:07:42,113 --> 01:07:44,081
Yes, sir.

710
01:07:46,251 --> 01:07:47,843
Well, Brad...

711
01:07:50,722 --> 01:07:52,952
where were we?

712
01:07:54,225 --> 01:07:58,924
We were talking about
a simple... old soldier.

713
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:30,725
Look at that, gentlemen.

714
01:08:32,328 --> 01:08:34,626
Compared to war,

715
01:08:34,697 --> 01:08:37,131
all other forms
of human endeavor

716
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:39,497
shrink to insignificance.

717
01:08:39,568 --> 01:08:41,593
Let's go, son.
Move out.

718
01:09:30,853 --> 01:09:33,219
Give me that helmet.

719
01:09:35,991 --> 01:09:38,152
Come on. Let's
get out of here.

720
01:09:48,303 --> 01:09:50,237
What silly
son of a bitch

721
01:09:50,305 --> 01:09:52,102
is in charge
of this operation?

722
01:09:52,174 --> 01:09:53,607
I don't know,

723
01:09:53,675 --> 01:09:55,609
but they ought
to hang him.

724
01:10:06,422 --> 01:10:08,356
Good afternoon, Padre.

725
01:10:08,424 --> 01:10:10,358
These gentlemen
are from the States

726
01:10:10,426 --> 01:10:13,862
looking over our program for
the men's spiritual welfare.

727
01:10:13,929 --> 01:10:15,897
We'll take you
into Palermo.

728
01:10:15,964 --> 01:10:18,489
The colonel showed us
around your quarters,

729
01:10:18,567 --> 01:10:20,501
and I saw a Bible
by your bed.

730
01:10:20,569 --> 01:10:23,163
You actually find time
to read it?

731
01:10:23,238 --> 01:10:24,865
I sure do.

732
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:27,738
Every goddamn day.

733
01:10:49,832 --> 01:10:52,801
Sir, Patton's
taken Palermo.

734
01:10:52,868 --> 01:10:54,802
Damn!

735
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:56,735
[Cheering]

736
01:11:12,821 --> 01:11:15,688
Palermo is history's
most conquered city.

737
01:11:15,757 --> 01:11:18,692
First the Phoenicians,
the Romans,

738
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:21,695
the Carthaginians,
Byzantines,

739
01:11:21,763 --> 01:11:26,200
then came the Arabs,
Spaniards, Neapolitans.

740
01:11:26,268 --> 01:11:30,637
Now comes
the American army.

741
01:11:40,282 --> 01:11:43,217
This is from
General Alexander, sir,

742
01:11:43,285 --> 01:11:46,743
reminding you not
to take Palermo.

743
01:11:46,822 --> 01:11:48,756
Send him a message.

744
01:11:48,824 --> 01:11:51,452
Ask if he wants me
to give it back.

745
01:12:37,906 --> 01:12:39,874
Let me ask you
a question.

746
01:12:39,942 --> 01:12:41,967
You've come
from Washington.

747
01:12:42,044 --> 01:12:44,137
How do they feel about
us taking Palermo?

748
01:12:44,213 --> 01:12:46,147
The general impression is

749
01:12:46,215 --> 01:12:48,149
your 7 th Army barreled
through token resistance

750
01:12:48,217 --> 01:12:51,152
while Montgomery faced
the brunt of the fighting.

751
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:54,155
We took on the Hermann
Goering division,

752
01:12:54,223 --> 01:12:56,589
toughest outfit
in the German army.

753
01:12:56,658 --> 01:12:58,626
People are curious

754
01:12:58,694 --> 01:13:00,628
about your pearl-handled
revolvers.

755
01:13:00,696 --> 01:13:02,129
They're ivory.

756
01:13:02,197 --> 01:13:04,631
Only a pimp from a cheap
New Orleans whorehouse

757
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,634
would carry
a pearl-handled pistol.

758
01:13:06,702 --> 01:13:08,636
What about
your language?

759
01:13:08,704 --> 01:13:11,400
It's loud and dirty.
That way they'll remember it.

760
01:13:11,473 --> 01:13:13,907
What do your troops
feel about that?

761
01:13:13,976 --> 01:13:17,207
I want them to fight
for me, not love me.

762
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:20,214
Ernie Pyle says you
have a secret weapon...

763
01:13:20,282 --> 01:13:22,216
General Bradley,
the G.I. General.

764
01:13:22,284 --> 01:13:24,218
That's what
Ernie calls him.

765
01:13:24,286 --> 01:13:27,221
Omar Bradley's no secret.
He's a damn fine commander.

766
01:13:27,289 --> 01:13:29,723
What's your feeling
about Montgomery?

767
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:31,884
He's the best general
the English have,

768
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,895
but he seems more concerned
with not losing than winning.

769
01:13:34,963 --> 01:13:36,897
He's not
aggressive enough,

770
01:13:36,965 --> 01:13:39,729
is that correct?

771
01:13:39,801 --> 01:13:42,235
Boys, I've been getting
into trouble lately.

772
01:13:42,304 --> 01:13:45,239
Yesterday,
the inspector general's office

773
01:13:45,307 --> 01:13:47,798
told me my Italian prisoners
didn't have enough latrines.

774
01:13:47,876 --> 01:13:50,401
Hell, they didn't know
what a damn latrine was

775
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:51,912
till I showed them.

776
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:54,244
If I've said anything
too critical

777
01:13:54,316 --> 01:13:56,250
about my distinguished
British colleague,

778
01:13:56,318 --> 01:13:58,252
let's just forget it.

779
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,686
I'll tell you one thing, though,
off the record.

780
01:14:00,756 --> 01:14:04,351
I'm going to beat that...
gentleman to Messina.

781
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,000
Ah, Freddie.

782
01:14:14,069 --> 01:14:16,503
This madman Patton's saying
he'll save our skins

783
01:14:16,571 --> 01:14:18,505
by taking Messina.

784
01:14:18,573 --> 01:14:21,007
This report might
interest you.

785
01:14:21,076 --> 01:14:23,010
Here I am,
in these bloody marshes,

786
01:14:23,078 --> 01:14:25,410
fighting malaria
as well as the Germans,

787
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:28,347
while he's taking Palermo
and getting all the glory.

788
01:14:28,417 --> 01:14:30,282
Ah. Well.

789
01:14:30,352 --> 01:14:33,651
Now he's up against
three good German divisions,

790
01:14:33,722 --> 01:14:35,656
and he's stuck
for a change.

791
01:14:35,724 --> 01:14:37,919
He's not going
to get Messina.

792
01:14:37,993 --> 01:14:41,861
That's reserved for
the British 8th Army and me.

793
01:14:46,635 --> 01:14:48,569
Time for a move,
Lucian.

794
01:14:48,637 --> 01:14:51,003
Allen's first division's
bogged down east ofTorino.

795
01:14:51,073 --> 01:14:54,338
You're bogged down
on the coast road.

796
01:14:54,409 --> 01:14:57,503
We need another end run
to break things loose.

797
01:14:57,579 --> 01:14:59,945
Ah. Lucian,
how's my fighter?

798
01:15:00,015 --> 01:15:01,380
Fine, George.

799
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:02,883
Come in. Come in.

800
01:15:02,951 --> 01:15:04,714
We need another one

801
01:15:04,786 --> 01:15:07,516
of your amphibious
specialties.

802
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:10,990
Lucian,
I want you to send

803
01:15:11,059 --> 01:15:14,153
a reinforced battalion
by sea

804
01:15:14,229 --> 01:15:16,561
to land at Brolo
behind the Kraut lines.

805
01:15:16,631 --> 01:15:18,064
General Bradley says

806
01:15:18,133 --> 01:15:20,067
you want me
to tie this in

807
01:15:20,135 --> 01:15:21,568
with a land-based
attack.

808
01:15:21,636 --> 01:15:23,900
A coordinated attack
on the 11 th.

809
01:15:23,972 --> 01:15:26,031
I don't think
that's possible.

810
01:15:26,108 --> 01:15:27,541
It's only 15, 20 miles.

811
01:15:27,609 --> 01:15:29,543
General, my boys
have been fighting

812
01:15:29,611 --> 01:15:31,841
and dying for yards.

813
01:15:31,913 --> 01:15:34,643
Well, kick a few butts
if you have to.

814
01:15:34,716 --> 01:15:37,150
Lucian,
I recommended you

815
01:15:37,219 --> 01:15:39,687
for your DSM
on your last promotion.

816
01:15:39,755 --> 01:15:41,689
I know
what you can do

817
01:15:41,757 --> 01:15:43,691
when you put your mind
to it.

818
01:15:43,759 --> 01:15:46,455
Excuse me, sir.

819
01:15:46,528 --> 01:15:50,794
I'm sorry,
but I can't do the impossible.

820
01:15:50,866 --> 01:15:52,800
You're too old an athlete

821
01:15:52,868 --> 01:15:55,132
to think you can postpone
a match already scheduled.

822
01:15:55,203 --> 01:15:58,172
You know yourself matches
sometimes are postponed.

823
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:01,209
If we can't back
them up by land,

824
01:16:01,276 --> 01:16:03,176
it could be
a disaster.

825
01:16:03,245 --> 01:16:06,942
Those men might
get cut to pieces.

826
01:16:07,015 --> 01:16:08,949
What's wrong
with you two?

827
01:16:09,017 --> 01:16:13,113
All we're talking about
is not rushing in until we're ready.

828
01:16:13,188 --> 01:16:16,954
- Give them an extra day.
- Just one more day.

829
01:16:17,058 --> 01:16:18,992
The landing is on.

830
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:20,994
We're going to Messina.

831
01:16:21,062 --> 01:16:24,998
We're going to get there
before Montgomery does.

832
01:16:25,066 --> 01:16:27,500
What's so important
about that?

833
01:16:27,569 --> 01:16:29,503
General Truscott,

834
01:16:29,571 --> 01:16:31,505
if your conscience
will not permit you

835
01:16:31,573 --> 01:16:33,507
to conduct
this operation,

836
01:16:33,575 --> 01:16:35,509
I'll relieve you
and find somebody who can.

837
01:16:35,577 --> 01:16:37,511
General,
it's your privilege

838
01:16:37,579 --> 01:16:41,015
to relieve me
anytime you want to.

839
01:16:41,082 --> 01:16:44,285
Well, this match
will not be postponed.

840
01:16:45,419 --> 01:16:47,353
Do you have any questions?

841
01:16:52,826 --> 01:16:54,316
No, sir.

842
01:16:54,395 --> 01:16:57,193
You're a very good man,
Lucian.

843
01:16:57,264 --> 01:17:00,199
You want to guard against
being too conservative.

844
01:17:00,267 --> 01:17:03,703
Remember what
Frederick the Great said...

845
01:17:03,771 --> 01:17:07,764
"L 'audace, I'audace,
toujours I'audace."

846
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:11,701
Go on. Have a drink.

847
01:17:11,779 --> 01:17:14,714
Excuse me, sir.
I won't be drinking

848
01:17:14,782 --> 01:17:16,750
for the next
couple of days.

849
01:17:20,788 --> 01:17:22,949
If anything happens
to those men,

850
01:17:23,023 --> 01:17:25,719
I'd like to be there
with them.

851
01:17:27,795 --> 01:17:31,231
Well, you're not going,
so forget about it.

852
01:17:31,298 --> 01:17:34,199
You believe
Truscott's right, huh?

853
01:17:34,268 --> 01:17:35,735
No.

854
01:17:35,803 --> 01:17:37,737
But I do know
you're gambling

855
01:17:37,805 --> 01:17:39,739
with the lives
of those boys

856
01:17:39,807 --> 01:17:43,743
just so you can beat
Montgomery into Messina.

857
01:17:43,811 --> 01:17:46,746
If you succeed,
you're a big hero.

858
01:17:46,814 --> 01:17:49,749
But if you don't,
what happens to them...

859
01:17:49,817 --> 01:17:51,751
the ordinary
combat soldier?

860
01:17:51,819 --> 01:17:55,755
He doesn't share in
your dreams of glory.

861
01:17:55,823 --> 01:17:57,688
He's stuck here...

862
01:17:57,758 --> 01:17:59,692
stuck living
day to day,

863
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,594
with death tugging
at his elbow.

864
01:18:06,066 --> 01:18:08,364
There's
one big difference

865
01:18:08,435 --> 01:18:10,699
between you and me,
George.

866
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:12,705
I do this job

867
01:18:12,773 --> 01:18:15,708
because I've been
trained to do it.

868
01:18:15,776 --> 01:18:17,710
You do it because...

869
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:22,681
you love it.

870
01:18:36,797 --> 01:18:39,231
Those men on the beach
are catching hell.

871
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:41,733
Truscott's men
are doing their best,

872
01:18:41,802 --> 01:18:44,236
but we have no
replacements for them.

873
01:18:44,304 --> 01:18:46,738
We can't break through
to the coast.

874
01:18:46,807 --> 01:18:48,866
I'm going down
there myself.

875
01:19:03,557 --> 01:19:05,491
Colonel!

876
01:19:05,559 --> 01:19:08,790
How in the hell did he
get over there?

877
01:19:08,862 --> 01:19:10,796
What are you
waiting for?

878
01:19:10,864 --> 01:19:13,799
Looking for a place
to ford, General.

879
01:19:13,867 --> 01:19:15,801
I sent out a patrol
to reconnoiter.

880
01:19:15,869 --> 01:19:17,803
I've already done that.

881
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:20,305
This sewer's
only 3 feet deep.

882
01:19:20,374 --> 01:19:24,902
Get moving,
or you'll be out of a job.

883
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,614
And put
that helmet on!

884
01:19:28,682 --> 01:19:30,309
Yes, sir!

885
01:19:45,032 --> 01:19:47,330
Move it!
Let's go!

886
01:19:55,909 --> 01:19:58,275
What's holding up
this column?

887
01:19:58,345 --> 01:20:00,006
I don't know, sir.

888
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,274
Planes!

889
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:08,381
Come on!
Move it!

890
01:20:30,677 --> 01:20:33,145
Pull up over there.

891
01:20:38,385 --> 01:20:40,285
[Arguing In Italian]

892
01:20:40,354 --> 01:20:43,016
- What's going on here?
- It's these mules! Jackasses!

893
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:45,752
You let a column get stalled and strafed
because of jackasses?

894
01:20:45,826 --> 01:20:47,817
What the hell's
the matter with you?

895
01:20:50,197 --> 01:20:51,721
[Gunshot]

896
01:20:51,798 --> 01:20:53,993
No. No.

897
01:20:54,067 --> 01:20:56,331
[Gunshots]

898
01:21:00,941 --> 01:21:05,503
Dump them over the side
and clear this bridge!
