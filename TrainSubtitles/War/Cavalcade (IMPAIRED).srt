- What does?

- Why, of course.

Robert's gone to report at the barracks.

157
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,976
He's got leave to travel down to the boat
with me.

158
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,097
Oh.

159
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,351
Oh, then, perhaps you'd like me to stay
and amuse the children till you get back.

160
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,107
- Oh, my dear, do.
- Mmm.

161
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,860
Oh, hello, Margaret.
You're on parade early.

162
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,941
- I just ran in to say good-bye.
- Oh, how kind.

163
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,401
Uh...

164
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,111
What the dickens?

165
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,289
Stand easy.

166
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,540
Now, youngsters, I want you to look
after your mother

167
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,963
very carefully while I'm away.

168
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,540
- Yes, Dad.
- And be very good

169
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,045
and learn your <i>lessons</i> and all that.

170
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,377
Dad, is Bobs a very big soldier?

171
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,714
Lord Roberts, if you please.
He's head of all the soldiers.

172
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,345
- Who's head of all the Boers?
- President Kruger.

173
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,434
And you and Bobs
are going to fight Kruger?

174
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,056
(LAUGHS) That's right.

175
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,481
Are you going to cut Kruger
all in pieces with your sword?

176
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:07,603
- You blood-thirsty little devil!
- Oh, promise you will, Daddy.

177
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,812
All right. Little tiny pieces.

178
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,073
(LAUGHS) There, I told you he would!

180
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:18,573
Oh, El, it won't seem like no time at all
till Mr. Bridges comes home again.

181
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,534
- If he ever does come home again.
- Mother.

182
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,202
Now what have I said?

183
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,961
Well, we'll all have a good laugh
when he does get back.

in the war against the Zulus.

187
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,218
But they never had that laugh

188
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:44,431
'cause he was cut in half
with a assegai the day he landed.

Oh, here, here, here, here.
Now, let's have a bit of life in it.

193
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,787
Here, half a mo, cookie.
Someone's gonna eat that pastry

194
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,456
- you're cryin' into.

Here, Fanny.
You can give your old dad a smile.

198
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,293
Come and have a look at your old dad.
Look at his buttons.

Oh, now, come on, old girl, now.
Cryin' won't do no good.

202
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,228
Fanny, your old dad's goin' to the war.

How many days will they be at sea,
Colonel?

207
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,840
Sixteen. It's 6,000 miles to South Africa.

208
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,295
You see, they land here at Cape Town,

209
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:43,600
then proceed by rail to Kimberley.
Then, by forced march, to Mafeking.

210
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,519
Let's hope they get there in time.

211
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,642
Mafeking's in a very bad way.

212
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,895
It's doubtful they can hold out much longer.

I'm wondering how many of them
will come back alive.

It's come at last, hasn't it, this moment?

- Take care of yourself.

Then lie down flat
on every possible occasion.

220

- I'll try to remember.
- Bridges will look after you.

00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,524
I must go, too.

225
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,109
No, not just for a minute.

226
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,819
I really must go.

227
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,579
I'm going to kiss you,

228
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,124
then I want you to turn away
and go on talking so you won't see.

Mm-hmm.

I'm glad I didn't bring Edward and Joey.

231
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,799
They're too young, really,
and they'd get overexcited.

232
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,507
Besides, Joey has a cold.

233
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,927
Take care of yourself, my darling.

234
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,439
I felt you go when I said
that bit about Joey.

All right, then, I'm defending Mafeking.

We'll get Ronnie James to take us.

614
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,620
Too proud to kiss your old dad, eh?

615
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,330
Come on, now. You'll do as you're told.

616
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,004
Go on. Get inside.

617
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,802
Don't stay out here playing on the streets.

618

619

to have a firm hand over them.

620
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:37,939
Oh, Mother. My, you are late.
Here, put your books down.

621
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:41,644
And go upstairs and put on
your white dress. Go on, hurry!

622
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:44,779
- Hello, Alf.
- Hello.

623
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,982
- Hello, Alf.
- Hello there. Hello, mate.

624
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,944
- Hello, Alf. How 'bout one?
- No, nothing to drink.

625
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,120
Just going to the brewery. Business, see?

626
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,118
Oh, one won't hurt ya.

627
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,657
All right.

628

631

Come here, dear.

632
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,019
I knew you when you were
a little tiny baby.

633
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:21,100
The child's a born dancer, if you ask me.
Highly talented.

634
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,225

635

from morning till night.

636
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:26,445
Have you any children, Annie?

637
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,608
Well, I haven't exactly,
if you know what I mean.

638
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,570
George don't believe in families.
Not in the retail business.

639
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,491
Now, what I mean, you've got
enough to do to look after the shop.

00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,915
JANE: Oh, I see.

641

Can I press you to another cup,
my ladyship?

645
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,881
Oh, no, thank you, really. We've...

646
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,512
- it's getting very late.
- Yes, Mother.

647
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:54,807
And how was Cambridge
when you left it, Master Edward?

648
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:58,303
Oh, awfully nice, I suppose.
I'm at Oxford, you know.

649
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:01,060
Oh, Oxford. I've never been to Oxford.

650
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,725
But my husband has. Haven't you, George?

651
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,235
Yes. Nice place, Oxford.

652
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,608
Very antique, if you know what I mean.

653
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,163
Sir Robert will be so sorry to hear
of Bridges's illness, Ellen.

654
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:20,458
Ill? Alf ill? What's the matter with him?

655
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,085
Before you and Annie come, George...

656
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,581
I was explaining to her ladyship
about poor Alfred's bad leg.

657
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:29,092
- Bad leg?
- Yes, very bad.

658
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,046
He's been in horrible agony since Sunday.

659
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:33,175
(LAUGHS)

660
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,973
You would laugh at someone being hurt.

661
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,176
- Where is he?
- Upstairs in bed.

662
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,853
- I'll pop up and have a look at him.
- No, he mustn't be disturbed.

663
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,938
And how did he come to have the accident?

664
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:47,273
Eh... Cycling, Annie.
He was cycling and he fell off.

665
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,604
I didn't know he had a cycle.

666
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,613
He hasn't anymore.

667
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,989
Well, please tell him how sorry we are.

668
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,786
Come, Edward.
We really must be going now.

669
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,452
Here you are, dear.

670
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:06,542
It was ever so kind of you, milady,
to come all this way to see us

671
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,875
and to give Fanny that lovely doll
and everything.

672
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,959
Say good-bye to her ladyship, Fanny.

673
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,050
- Good-bye, milady.
- Good-bye, dear. Good-bye.

674
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,382
Good-bye, Annie.
I'm so glad you settled down so happily.

675
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,433
Pleased to have made
your acquaintance, I'm sure.

676

Good-bye, Ellen.
Please remember us to Bridges.

677

- We miss you both still.
- We miss you, too, milady.

Well, time changes many things,
but it can't change old friends, can it?

00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,820
No, milady. Oh, no, milady.

680
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,859
Good-bye, Ellen, and good luck.

681

Good-bye, Master Edward,
and thank you for coming. Good-bye.

Oh, so this is why you wanted me
out of the way, eh?

00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,711
Alfred Bridges, behave yourself.

685
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,931
Pleased to see you again, milady, I'm sure.

Welcome to our hovel.

Oh, proud and haughty, are we?

688
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:08,646
- Alfred, stop it! Stop it!
- Ellen. Dear Ellen.

689
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,481
I'm so very, very sorry.

You mind your business, and I'll mind mine.

Look here, old man. You better come up

695

- and have a lay down.
- Leave me alone!

- Oh, Lord.

776
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,714
We have to, dear.
Your father's going to join us there.

777
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,175
Yes, I know, darling. He has strong nerves.

778
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,886
But he doesn't need
a whole deputation of us to meet him.

00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:44,347
Edith and I are going to
the concert on the east pier.

Nobody's asking you, my little man.

You just take your spade and your
bucket and have a nice little paddle.

- EDITH: Oh, Edward.
- Come along, Edith.

You don't mind, Mummy?

785
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,568
Of course not, darling.
Do just what you like.

786
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,615
Are those two children
getting romantic by any chance?

787
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:06,328
- Romantic? They're absolutely pathetic.
- Oh, Joey, behave.

788
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:10,085
Oh, but, Mum, can't you see they've gone
completely dippy about each other?

789
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:15,344
Why, it seems only yesterday they were
quarreling over their toys in the nursery.

790
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,596
I wonder if Joey's right.

- Would you mind?
- Jane, dear, of course not.

792

- Would you?
- My son and your daughter?

793

Darling, you know I'd be delighted.

Oh, milady, fancy you being here.

- How do you do, ma'am?

Oh, you have grown.

801
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,831
I got your letter, milady,
when my Alfred died.

802
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,129
It was kind of you to write, I'm sure.

803
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,456
We were so sorry.

804
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,838
- I hope your business affairs are...
- Oh, quite all right, milady.

I left my manager in charge.

She goes to dancing academy now.

808

She won this prize today for dancing.

00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:11,142
- Oh, it's lovely.
- Not half good enough, if you ask me.

- Dances like Pavaliver, that child.
- Dances like who?

811
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:18,198
Pavaliver, the Russian dancer.
Don't be so ignorant.

812
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,317
Oh, she wants to go on the stage,
I suppose.

- Quite well. Thank you, sir.

- This is my cousin, Mr. Grainger.

- How do you do?
- And his wife.

listening to Mendelssohn's Spring Song

825

or a great beefy contralto
singing Sweet And <i>Low.</i>

826

I adore contraltos.

worship Mendelssohn's Spring Song.

- Perhaps.
- We'll be seasick.

- Hideously.
- Oh, everyone is.

- Seasick hideously.

I rather wish I had sometimes.

892
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,865
Perhaps then I should have learned
some tricks to hold you with

893

when you begin to get tired of me.

Have you ever seen gingerbread
with gilt on it?

- Oh, fool!
- Then the whole argument is disposed of.

a better chance in the beginning.

it's quite fair to say that.

you haven't got any ailments?

- Yes, Robert.

at half past 11:00.

And now don't forget that
you're both dining with me on Tuesday.

if you're going to Paris on Monday?

1444
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:21,593
Oh, but I shall be flying
back in the afternoon.

Robert, don't bother to come down.

- Nonsense. Of course I will.
- No, no, no, I insist.

01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:34,397
- Now, I can easily let myself out.
- Very well.

1450
01:44:35,186 --> 01:44:37,439
And a happy New Year to you.

1451

One more year behind us.

1456

Ah, that's your strength, my dear.

1463
01:45:26,946 --> 01:45:31,497
I believe in the future, too,
but not quite in the same way.

1464

It's been quite an adventure,
our life together.

1465

A great adventure, Robert.

1466
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,719
Anxious sometimes and sad.

1467
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:45,347

- In this very room.
- Yes.

Sometimes I've almost hated it.

1472

- Oh, my dear, of course not.

Oh, so we have. I never noticed.

Let us drink to the spirit
of gallantry and courage

that made a strange heaven
out of unbelievable hell.
