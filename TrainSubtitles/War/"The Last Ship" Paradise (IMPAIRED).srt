My God, Allison. What have you done?

00:38:18,353 --> 00:38:20,453
Mr. President, through
no fault of your own,

657
00:38:20,455 --> 00:38:21,654
you've stepped through the looking glass

658

into the birth of a new America.

The pandemic, the millions of deaths,

660
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,460
the complete collapse of law and order

661
00:38:27,462 --> 00:38:30,163
demands a revolution of governance.

662
