one thing straight.

00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,398
Our dads
got to go to WW II.

329
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,401
This is our chance
to be part of history.

330
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,198
Yeah, just like
our dads.

333
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,042
It could be dangerous
over there.

334
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,010

get yourself killed.

335

Where are you going,

College?

336
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,715
I want to do something
with my life.

337
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,151
I can get a degree in
business administration.

338

You don't need

I don't see them.

349

They're not here

Me... Stevie,

Wendy Daniels?
Wendy Daniels?

359

360
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,501
Well, who are you taking,
Joey, your mother?

361
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,505
Ronnie, who are you going
to take to the prom?

362

You don't know her.

363
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,008
She's a pretty girl
from Ronkonkoma.

Her name

Yeah.

Rosanna Lombardi.

371

She's from
out of town, right?

372
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,991
She going
to get a motel?

373
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,493
'Cause I'd like
to get in on that.

374
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,835
Ronnie, would
you take this
to section three?

375
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,337
Check the stock
for dog food.

376
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,337

377
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,340
Then finish
stacking the potatoes.

Come on. Let's go.

379

How you doing?
How's...

389
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,245
Good.

390
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,754
I heard that you were going
into the marines.

391
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,049
Yeah, yeah.

392
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,557
It's better than
working at A&P.

393
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,058
That's great,
Ronnie.

394
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,219
That's wonderful.

395
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,229
I'm going
to boot camp soon.

396
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,231
I joined

397
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,732
so I go to Vietnam,

398
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,734
probably on
the front line.

399
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:04,894
Really?

400
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,904
I'll see
a lot of action.

401
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,736
Wow.
That's neat.

402
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,242
Heard you got
into that school.

403
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,403

404
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,570
Yeah.

405
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,113
Yeah, Syracuse.

406
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,172
It's going to be
really hard.

407
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,708
Could I... Could I talk
to you in private?

408
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,584
Oh, yeah. Sure.

409
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,960
I've been meaning
to call you.

410
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,495
I was wondering,

411
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,124
are you going with
someone to the prom?

412
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,997
Yeah. I'm going
with Jed.

413
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,502
Oh, yeah?
That's great.

414
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,403
I mean, he's
a nice guy... Jed.

415
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,872
Stevie Boyer told me

416
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,240
that you were
taking some girl
from Lake Ronkonkoma.

417
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,744
Yeah. No, no.

418
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:48,939
No?

419
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,676
No. I don't have time
for that stuff.

420
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,685
There's a lot of things
to take care of

421

in the marines.

422
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,614
I didn't even know
how much stuff.

423

the shock defibs!

813

Stay with me now.

814
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,549
We're going to
jump-start you. Clear!

815
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,888
Where's the priest?
Get me a priest.

816
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,116
Breathe! Breathe!
Breathe!

817
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,557
Breathe!

818
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,894
I took the Packers
at minus 7.

819
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,059
They ain't
got a chance.

820
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,832
How are you?

821
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,943
You tell them
they've got to operate.

822
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,980
There's something
wrong with me.

823
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:11,674
The doctors are real busy.

824
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,683
There's a lot
of wounded here.

825
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,343
There's no time for anything

826
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,182
except trying to stay alive.

827
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,848
You got to try
and stay alive. O.K.?

828
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:21,447
Try and stay alive.

829
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:25,655
I've come to give you
your last rites.

830
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,720
Are you ready?

831
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,729
I'm ready, Father.

832
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:37,239
I am the resurrection
and the life.

833
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:38,899
He that believeth in me,

834
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:41,274
though he were dead,
yet shall he live.

835
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,245
We brought nothing
into this world,

836
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,838
and it's certain
we can take nothing out.

837
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,885
The Lord giveth, and
the Lord taketh away.

838
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:51,443
Blessed be the name
of the Lord.

Eddie, I need
some help in room 13.

844
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,423
Give me
a second, man.

845
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:28,583
His catheter's
plugging up.

846
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:31,093
It's backing up
into his kidney.

847
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:35,257
I said I'd be there.
Give me a break.

848
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,594
Man, what's going up?

849
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:37,599
Nothing, man.

850
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:40,102
You ain't supposed
to be having this.

851
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,262
Oh!

852
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:44,774
Didn't I tell you not
to do that to him

853
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,366
in the a.m.?

854
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,536
Take the needle
out of my arm.

855
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:49,874
Good morning,
Nurse Washington.

856
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,278
How are you today?

857
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,782
You up bright
and early today.

Good morning, gentlemen.

Pea!

862
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,791
Can I have
some aspirin?

863
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,292
I ain't feeling well.

864
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,793
I'd like
some aspirin.

865
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,796
Hmm. I'll get to you.

866
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,298
Leon! How you
doing today?

867
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,799

Mm-hmm!

869
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,234
My catheter's
clogged.

870
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,600
Give it a minute.

871
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,901
They're getting
bigger every day.

872
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,339
You don't bother them,

873
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,239
they ain't going
to bother you.

874

That's why
I'm feeding him.

875
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,247
Keep on feeding him,
and everything'll be fine.

That's good. Let's go.

885
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,093
Let's do it.
Let's go.

886
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,259
Give me a hand over here.

887
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:45,767

888

893

very clear to you, Ron.

00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:18,187
The possibility of your
ever walking is minimal.

954

Almost impossible.

955
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:26,028
You're a T-6, paralyzed
from the midchest down.

956
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,530
Probably you'll be
in a wheelchair

what I'm saying?

Hmm?

961
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:44,213
Will I ever be able
to, uh...

962
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:46,215
to have children?

963
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,717
No.

964
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:51,720
No, but we have
a very good
psychologist here.

I know I'll walk again.

looking like, good?

974
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,143
You're one crazy marine.

975
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,611
So gung ho,

976
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,113
but you don't know shit

977
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,547
about what's going on
in this country.

978
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,209
Fuck you.

979
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:25,220
It ain't about
burning the flag
and Vietnam.

980
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:27,222
Why fight
for rights there?

981
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,724
We ain't got rights
at home.

982
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:31,727
It's about Detroit
and Newark.

983
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,228
It's about racism, man,

984
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:36,231
but you can't get
no job at home.

985
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:39,757
Vietnam's
a white man's war,
a rich man's war.

986
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,269
Where's my money?

987
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,135
You got
to read some books.

988
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,265
There's a revolution
going on.

989
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,776
If you ain't part
of the solution,

990
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:50,074
then you's part
of the problem.

991
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:53,947
Will you just get
my chair for me?

992
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:57,077
You got to watch
for her.

993
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:58,382
Oh, man.

994
00:50:58,455 --> 00:50:59,717
Good stuff.

995
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,382
Take the bra off.

996
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,392
I'll give you
another 10.

997
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,893
Why, sure, sugar.

998
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:10,231
Like this?

999
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,565
Oh, shh! Shh!
Yeah. Yeah.

1000
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:14,729
Suck on my tits.

1001
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:16,238
Honey, anything
you want.

1002
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:17,238
Shh!

1003
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,239
[Sucking]

1004
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:19,240
Oh!

1005
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,503
Oh.

1006
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:25,344
~ I guess you'd say ~

1007
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:29,977
~ What could make me
feel this way ~

1008
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,452
~ My girl ~

1009
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:32,488
~ My girl ~

1010
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:33,488
~ My girl ~

1011
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:36,856
~ Talking 'bout my girl ~

1012
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:37,894
~ My girl ~~

1013
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,560
Good.

1014
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:48,569
Easy now.

1015
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,071
Easy now.

1016
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:52,240
Very good.

1017
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:53,241
Hey, Doc...

1018
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,574
it's really beautiful
up here.

1019
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,738
Ha ha ha!

1020
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:06,588
I'm walking
out of here, guys.

1021
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,089
You'll see.
Right, Willie?

1022
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:09,591
Right.

1023
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:10,591
Easy.

1024
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,356
Oh... I'm all right.
I'm all right.

1025
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,261
O.K. That's enough
for today.

1026
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,600
O.K.
Now, good. Good.

1027
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:21,535
Easy, now.
Easy, now.
Don't go too far.

1028
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,038
Don't do too much.

1029
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:25,404
Looking good today.
Looking good.

1030
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,874
Don't go too far.

1031
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:27,875
All right!

1032
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:30,003
Way to go, Kovic.

1033
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,944
Amazing, huh?

1034
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,948
Nothing from
the chest down.

1035
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:35,951
It can be done.
It can be done.

1036
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,680
<i>Semper fi, </i> motherfucker!

1037
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:38,686
All right!

1038
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,188
All right, Harry, man.

1039
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:42,191
Keep it going. Let's go!

1040
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,056
Let's go. Let's go.

1041
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,219
Let's go.

1042
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:46,557
Aah!

1043
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,562
Oh!

1044
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:48,563
Willie!

1045
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,566
I think I need...

1046
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:52,067
Oh! Oh.

1047
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:53,693
Get him up.
Somebody...

1048
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,761
Something snapped.
It's my neck.

1049
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,828
All right.

1050
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,340
Just my neck.

1051
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:00,137
Harry!

1052
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,643
Hang on. Hang on.

1053
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:02,939
What was that sound?

1054
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:03,945
Oh shit.

1055
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,379
What?

1056
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:06,506
Oh!

1057
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,517
It's fine.
We're doing fine.

1058
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,018
Is that my bone?

1059
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:12,077
Harry, Harry,
get a doc.

1060
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:13,588
Am I O.K.?

1061
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:16,217
It's O.K.
Everybody relax.
Harry! Let's go!

1062
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:17,317
Oh, no.

1063
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,089
Oh, my God.

1064
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,477
Washington!

1065
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:26,288
Washington,
where were you?

1066
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,790
I've been pushing
this call button

1067
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,793
and staring at my vomit
for two hours.

1068
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,295
What's the matter
with you people?

1069
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:36,798
I'm laying
in my own shit.

1070
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:39,300
Why don't you
change the sheets?

1071
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:40,802
This damn place.

1072
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,303
I need a bath.

1073
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:45,307
Don't be raising
your voice to me!

1074
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,808
You watch your mouth.

1075
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:48,810
Why don't you help me?

1076
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:50,812
What's the matter
with you?

1077
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,313
I don't feel right.

1078
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:54,816
I need to see
the doctor now!

1079
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,317
He's not available now.

1080
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:58,320
I want to see him now!

1081
00:55:58,388 --> 00:55:59,821
He's always too busy.

1082
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,322
What's eating
you now?

1083
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,325
You going off
the deep end?

1084
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:04,826
We'll amputate that leg,

1085
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,828
you go on like this.

1086
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:09,262
Don't put
your hands on me.

1087
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:11,766
I want to be treated
like a human being.

1088
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:13,769
I don't want any of this.

1089
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:15,270
Trying to keep me drugged

1090
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:18,273
so I don't know
what's going on.

1091
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:19,774
This is a fucking slum.

1092
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,276
We take that leg,

1093
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:23,278
you're out
in two weeks.

1094
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:24,779
I want my leg.

1095
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,782
Why?
You can't feel it.

1096
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,785
It's my leg.
I want my leg.

1097
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,286
Can't you
understand that?

1098
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:34,289
I want to be treated
like a human being.

1099
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,291
I fought
for my country.

1100
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:37,792
I'm a Vietnam veteran!

1101
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:39,795
I fought
for my country!

1102
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,296
Shut the fuck up!

1103
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:44,299
I should
be treated decent!

1104
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:47,302
Vietnam don't mean
nothing to me, man,

1105
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,498
or any of these
other people.
You got it?

1106
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,803
You can take
your Vietnam

1107
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:55,538
and you can shove it
up your ass, you hear?

1108
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:58,376
No! I don't
need this!

1109
00:56:58,448 --> 00:56:59,881
Hey, you fuck!

1110
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,712
Hey! Hey, goddamn you!

1111
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,388
I am a Vietnam
veteran!

1112

[Sobbing]

1113
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:09,457
This isn't...

1114
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:10,458
Marvin!

1115
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:11,459
Marvin, now!

1116
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:12,460
Marvin!

1117
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:13,962
What's up?
What's up?

1118
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:14,962
Marvin, look!

1119
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,055
Oh, fuck!

1120
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:17,064
It's off.

1121
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:18,566
It ain't
going to work.

1122
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:19,567
Start!

1123
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:21,069
Washington,
get the doctor.

1124
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,570
Wait a minute.

1125
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,073
O.K. Yeah.
All right. I will.

1126
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:26,438
How you doing, Eddie?

1127
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:29,205
Let's see what's
wrong with this.

1128
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,577
If we don't get
this pump working,

1129
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:34,776
they'll cut my leg off.
I want my leg.

1130
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,318
Do we have another pump?

1131
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,547
It's the only one, Eddie.

1132
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,986
Ron. It's Ron Kovic.

1133
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,887
Sorry, man. Ron.

1134
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,290
You... You are a doctor?

1135
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,691
It's the Vietnam War.

1136
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:48,697
The government's
not giving us
the money we need

1137
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,824
to take care
of you guys.

1138
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,835
We're doing our best.
It's really too bad.

1139
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:55,336
It's not fair.

1140
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:58,033
I've tried hard
to keep this leg.

1141
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:01,042
I've been strapped in
this bed for four months

1142
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,544
so I could keep this leg.

1143
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,047
Maybe I can rig up
a substitute.

1144
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:09,983
I'll look in the basement
and see what we got.

1145
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:11,486
You're coming back?

1146
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:12,851
Soon.

1147
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,856
Let go, Ron.
Let go.

1148
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,120
We really did try
to help Mr. Kovic.

[Engine Starts]

1150
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,196

[Horn Honks]

1152
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:06,908
Susanne, he's here.

1153
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:08,409
Ronnie's home.

1154
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:17,118
O.K. Out on 3.

1155
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:18,619
All right, 1...

1156
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:19,620
2...

1157
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:20,621
3.

1158
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,123
Oh, that's great.

1159
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,625
Did you
paint the house, Dad?

1160
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:26,127
Yeah. I painted it.

1161
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:27,628
Yellow. It looks good.

1162
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:29,130
It looks pretty good.

1163
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:31,962
I got that.
That's all right.
Let's go.

1164
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:34,469
The kids have been
talking about you.

1165
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:36,971
They can't wait
to see you.

1166
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,268
It's great to be back
in the neighborhood.

1167
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:42,038
I got it. I got it.

1168
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,545
Everything looks
so different.

Hey, Major.

1172
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:51,019
Major, you know
who this is?

1173
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,054
Yeah.

1174
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:54,055
You know who this is?

1175
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:55,590
He's gotten old, huh?

1176
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:57,592
Just like your old man.

1177
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,888
Hey, Tommy.

1178
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:00,486
Good to see you.

1179
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:01,757
Look at that hair.

1180
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,299
Dad lets you
look like that?

1181
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:05,994
I don't have
much say.

1182
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:07,297
How are you, Jimmy?

1183
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:10,498
Good to have you home.
You're out for good?

1184
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:11,767
I'm out for good.

1185
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:14,139
Patty, gee,
look at you.

That's Jackie.

1188
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:20,081
I wanted to visit you
in the hospital.

1189
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:23,118
How many pull-ups
you do, huh?

1190
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:26,155
You know, I did 23...
23 pull-ups.

1191
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:28,690
23 pull...
I'm O.K. I'm O.K.

1192
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:30,225
I'm all right.

Good to have you home.

1196
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,530
You didn't tell me
she was this beautiful.

1197
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,658
She's a woman, huh?

1198
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,464
I'm sorry.

1199
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:43,061
That's O.K. I can't
feel anything anyway.

1200
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,538
I'm only paralyzed.

1201
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:45,938
You look great.

01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,237
Yeah?

Hey, Mom.

1207
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:57,181
Oh, look at your hair.

1208
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:58,720
It looks great.

It's good to be home.

1213
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,388
It's better
than seeing me

1214
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:10,898
at that hospital, huh?

1215
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:12,400
It's O.K.

1216
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:14,368
I know.

1217
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:15,665
I'm O.K.

1218
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:17,399
I'm O.K.

1219

It's good to
have you home, Ronnie.

1220
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:23,436
Gee, everybody
looks so good.

1221
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,777
Everybody looks so good.

1222
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:29,443
I'm going to go inside
for a minute.

1223
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,952
Mom, wait.

1224
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,180
She'll be O.K.

1225
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:35,520
Ronnie, how are you, man?
You look good.

1226
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,024
Ronnie,
you look good.

1227
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:38,060
Welcome home.

1228
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,595
It's so good
to see you.

1229
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:42,494
Welcome home.
Nice to see you.

1230
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:44,931
Look at Harry.
You look good.

1231
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:46,992
Let's go in
the house and help.

1232
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,933
Come on, Mom.
It's all right.

1233
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,442
Looks good.

1234
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,444
Yeah?

1235
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:58,446
You need some help?

1236
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:00,539
No. I'm O.K., Dad.

1237
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:03,449
Fixed up a bathroom
for you, Ronnie.

1238
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,453
Put a wider doorway in.

1239
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:08,888
I built a shower
for you, too.

1240
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,893
You can get in here
pretty easy.

1241
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,395
Oh, and I
put some handles

1242
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,398
on the toilet
for you.

1243
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:17,899
Ronnie.

1244
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:19,901
Thanks, Dad.

1245
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:48,760
It's really great
to be back in my room.

1246
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:59,941
It's good to have you.

1247
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,945
It's good to have you,
Ronnie.

1248
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,387
Come on, I'll show you...

1249
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,889
[Sniffling]

1250
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:18,393
I'll show you
some new stuff we got

1251
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,395
in the bedroom
over here.

1252
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,532
My Happauge Boyer's grossed
85 grand last six months.

1253
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,535
My competitor's
rushing in to build,
but I was first.

1254
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,800
The people are loyal.

1255
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:33,398
You probably think
it's just a hamburger.

1256
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,411
A patty's
just a piece of meat,

1257
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:37,912
but it can
have character.

1258
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,277
See that doughnut hole?

1259
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:42,647
Gets 18 patties to the pound
instead of 16.

1260
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:45,152
Saves me
about $40,000 a year.

1261
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:46,381
That's serious
money, Ron.

1262
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:47,888
I plug the hole

1263
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:49,891
with lettuce, tomatoes,
onions, spices.

1264
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:52,257
I cover it
with a pickle.

1265
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,262
They'll never
miss a thing.

1266
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,265
Give me a good one
for Ronnie. Thanks.

1267
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,766
Good job. Try this.

1268
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,770
You don't find that
at McDonald's on Sunrise.

1269
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,136
I got a drive-in
window, too.

1270
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,640
It's Long Island's first.

1271
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,642
It's clean,
it's cheap, it's fast.

1272
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,644
Feed the family
for $3.95.

1273
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:11,145
Check out these chicks.

1274
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,977
They're wearing
those new miniskirts.

1275
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:15,483
It's my idea.
It's good for tips.

1276
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:16,984
The customers
always come back.

1277
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:18,486
Massapequa's changed.
Watch yourself.

1278
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:21,489
It's no mom and pop
operation anymore.

1279
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:22,990
This is our town.

1280
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:26,995
You're doing a nice job.
Keep up the good work.

1281
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,155
Good.

1282
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:31,166
Copiague, Ronnie, Jericho,
Bayville, Valley Stream, man.

1283
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:32,667
I want to turn Boyer's

1284
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:35,169
into a whole
Long Island thing.

1285
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:38,002
I want you to come
to work for me.

1286
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:39,507
What can I do?

1287
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:41,941
This is our town now.

1288
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:44,502
You're a war hero,
and you can benefit.

1289
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,013
You should benefit,
Ronnie.

1290
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:47,515
You mean, like partners?

1291
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:49,517
We open a place
together?

1292
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,951
You got to walk
before you run.

1293
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:54,956
I could start you out
as a cashier.

1294
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:57,458
Then you could
learn the business,

1295
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:59,926
work your way up
to be manager,

1296
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:01,827
just like your dad.

1297
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,492
I get 1,700 a month
from the government.

1298
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,000
I'll take my time.

1299
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,263
That's charity money.
This isn't.

1300
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:09,269
Charity?

1301
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:10,362
Here's your cola.

1302
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:13,237
You got to put
the war behind you.

1303
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,243
Forget about
this chair you're in.

1304
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:16,744
Sometimes,
you know, Stevie,

1305
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:18,245
I think people know

1306
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:19,747
you're back
from Vietnam,

1307
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:22,249
and their face changes,
the eyes...

1308
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:25,253
the voice, the way
they look at you.

1309
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,255
I know, but people here,

1310
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:29,757
they don't give a shit
about the war.

1311
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:32,692
It's just a million
miles away. It's bullshit.

1312
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,697
The government sold us
a bill of goods.

1313
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,529
We got the shit
kicked out of us.

1314
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,037
What do you mean "we"?
You were in college.

1315
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:46,207
It was you who bought
that Communist bullshit.

1316
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:49,210
Yeah. They were going
to take over the world.

1317
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,711
Do you remember that?

1318
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,145
Finnelli, you, Walsh.

1319
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:54,148
The whole town
was devastated.

1320
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:55,911
For what?

1321
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:56,974
For lies?

1322
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:07,495
They burn the flag.

1323
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:08,996
They demonstrate
against us

1324
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:11,499
on the cover
of the paper today.

1325
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:13,000
They have no respect.

1326
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:14,502
They have no idea

1327
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,504
what's going on
over there

1328
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:18,870
and the men that are
sacrificing their lives.

1329
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:20,374
Nobody here seems to care.

1330
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:22,911
It's a bunch of goddamn shit.

1331
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:26,881
Don't take the Lord's name
in vain.

1332
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:27,973
I agree with
everything you say.

1333
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,483
I served my country.

1334
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:31,986
They just want
to take from it.

1335
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:33,988
Love it or leave it.

1336
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:35,489
The other side's angry

1337
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:36,991
because
we're not winning.

1338
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:39,118
How can we win?

1339
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:40,628
Tommy,
what's the matter?

1340
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:41,628
Nothing.

1341
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:43,130
Anybody listening here?
Tommy?

1342
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,131
What?

1343
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,065
Tommy's going
to fail English.

1344
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:48,330
He doesn't believe
in the war.

1345
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:51,697
What?

1346
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:55,505
He thinks we're doing
the wrong thing over there.

1347
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:58,775
He thinks
it's all a mistake.

1348
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,510
Mistake? What's this?
Spit it out.

1349
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:03,108
You believe
in demonstrators?

1350
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:04,413
Huh? What?

1351
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:07,183
I just don't agree
with everything
you're saying.

1352
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:09,190
I don't think
you understand.

1353
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:11,192
What does
Tommy know?

1354
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,921
I don't understand?

1355
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:14,929
He's hanging around
with longhairs

1356
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:16,089
who take drugs!

1357
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:17,598
That's not the reason.

1358
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:18,928
Have they ever worked?

1359
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:21,265
You want to
burn the flag?
Huh, Tommy?

1360
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:22,497
What is this?

1361
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:25,039
You want to
bring down this country?

1362
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,473
Love it
or leave it, Tommy.

1363
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,443
All they're
trying to say, Ronnie,

1364
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:31,946
is they don't
want more people

1365
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:33,811
to come back like you.

1366
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,248
That's an easy excuse.

1367
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:38,582
Where were they when
their country needed them?

1368
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,087
You served your country.

1369
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:43,091
What did you
get out of it?

1370
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,990
Look at you.

1371
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,996
Well, look at me.

1372
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,861
Look at you, man.

1373
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:53,026
I got to go. I'll see
you around, all right?

1374
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:54,967
What's wrong
with me, Tommy?

1375
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,800
What's wrong with me?

1376
01:07:56,872 --> 01:07:58,897
Is there something
wrong with me?

1377
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:00,407
I volunteered,
Tommy!

1378
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:03,309
You don't know
what you're
talking about!

1379
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,812
Were you there?

1380
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,316
You can just love it
or leave it, Tommy!

1381
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:09,817
Mom, I can't believe

1382
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:12,149
what Tommy just
said to me.

1383
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:13,313
I can't...

1384
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:16,984
I can't believe what
Tommy just said to me.

1385
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:24,496
Parade time, Ronnie.

1386
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:28,003
You tell them I'll be
right there, all right?

1387
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:32,666
What kind of car is it?

1388
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:34,333
I think it's
a Continental.

1389
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:35,502
Continental?

1390
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:36,670
A convertible?

1391
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:37,677
Yeah.

1392
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:39,509
They said
it would be.

1393
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:41,015

I believe in victory
for America.

1415
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:48,572
Some people are starting
to say the war is wrong,

1416
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:50,407
that we shouldn't be there.

1417

kids who have respect

Doc here, he was
in the first war.

1440

A lot of us here
were in the second.

That's why
we can't give up.

Because Massapequa's
been there before,

Give him a big hand
on his great birthday.

1451
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:28,368
I just want to say
for the guys in Vietnam

1452
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:29,877
that we're doing our best.

1453
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:32,709
It's not an easy situation,

1454
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:38,219
but the boys' morale
over there is real high,

1455
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:40,721
and you can feel
confident that we are...

01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:43,223
We are going to
win that war.

Oh, no.

1529
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:08,228

1530

or something.

1531

Yeah. I'm telling
you the truth.

1533
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:17,567
He goes over to Vietnam,

up there, Ronnie,

anything that...

Me?

1558
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,573
Got shot in the foot.

1559
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,910
I got up like I was...

1560
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,744
back in the woods again,

1561
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,750
like I was
John fuckin' Wayne,

1562
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,514
emptying a mag,
screaming,
"Come on, Charlie!

1563
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:41,522
Motherfucker,
come on out, Charlie!"

1564
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,023
Rat-tat-tat-tat.

1565
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:47,023
I heard this crack
above my right ear,

1566
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:49,529
and I just
felt my body...

1567
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:52,863
drop out from under me.

1568
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:56,199
Christ, I thought
I was dead for sure.

1569
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:57,704
Was the, uh...

1570
01:17:57,773 --> 01:17:59,206
How was
the hospital?

1571
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:00,206
It sucked.

1572
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:01,207
I know.

1573
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:02,208
Really bad.

1574
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,370
I'll tell you
something, Ronnie...

1575
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,710
sometimes at night...

1576
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:09,546

headaches, you know?

1577

1578

And, uh...

1579
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,953
they just kind of
come over me,

1580
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:18,288
and these doctors
don't know shit,
you know.

1581
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,796
They just come,
like I'm going
crazy or something.

1582
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:27,802
I don't feel...
I don't feel like me
anymore, you know?

1583
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,803
I feel like...
When they come,

1584
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,805
I feel like
somebody else.

1585
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,306
What do you do?

1586
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:36,310
Nothing. Not
a thing, you know?

1587
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:40,314
Well... mostly I do
a lot of drugs.

1588
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,815
Do anything
you can, you know?

1589
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:46,478
Y-you get through it
any way you can.

1590
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:50,821
When I was
in the hospital,

1591
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,827
I thought, "Yeah.
yeah, this makes sense."

1592
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:56,826
What makes sense?

1593
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,492
'Cause I failed, Timmy.

1594
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,502
What are you
talking about?

1595
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,340
'Cause I...

1596
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:09,343
'Cause I killed someone...
some people. L...

1597
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,437
I made some terrible...

1598
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:13,606
mistakes.

1599
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:16,879
Ronnie, we all made mistakes.
I mean, you...

1600
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:18,351
you had no choice.

1601
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,853
Those pansy
demonstrators

1602
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,718
will never understand.

1603
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,155
Don't talk about it.

1604
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:25,159
It was insane
over there.

1605
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:27,661
Sometimes I wish...
I wish I'd...

1606
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:31,161
When I got shot
in the foot,

1607
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:32,996
I could have laid down.

1608
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:36,504
Who gives a fuck now
if I was a hero or not?

1609
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:38,937
I was paralyzed,
castrated that day. Why?

1610
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,976
'Cause I was so s...
stupid.

1611
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:48,012
I'd have my dick and my balls
now, and I think...

1612
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:51,883
I think, Timmy,
I'd give everything
I believe in,

1613
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:54,046
everything I got...
all my values

1614
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:56,056
just to have
my body again,

1615
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:58,058
just to be whole again.

1616
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,559
But I'm not whole.

1617
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,892
I never will be,
and that's...

1618
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:04,557
the way it is, isn't it?

1619
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:07,793
For Christ's sake,
Ronnie...

1620
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:09,029
it's your birthday.

1621
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:11,265
You're alive.

1622
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:15,609
You made it.

1623
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,473
Smile.

1624
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:31,221
<i>Syracuse, New York, </i>
<i>our next stop. </i>

1625
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:06,621
~ Oh, where
have you been ~

1626
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:09,289
~ My blue-eyed son ~

1627
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,300
~ Oh, where
have you been ~

1628
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:16,303
~ My darling young one ~

1629
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,340
~ I've walked
and I've crawled ~

1630
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:22,570
~ On six
crooked highways ~

1631
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:25,812
~ I've been
out in front ~

1632
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,645
~ Of a dozen dead oceans ~

1633
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:32,112
~ I've been 10,000 miles ~

1634
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:34,883
~ In the mouth
of a graveyard ~

1635
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:38,184
~ And it's a hard ~

1636
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:40,194
~ It's a hard ~

1637
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:42,196
~ It's a hard ~

1638
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:44,164
~ It's a hard ~

1639
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:47,463
~ It's a hard rain ~

1640
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:49,833
~ That's gonna fall ~

1641
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:54,473
~ Who did you meet ~

1642
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:56,737
~ My blue-eyed son... ~~

1643
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,181
Those long letters
I wrote you

1644
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:05,685
from over there?

1645
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,187
Crazy stuff, huh?

1646
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:08,688
That's all right.

1647
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,019
I had to say everything

1648
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:13,026
I couldn't say
when we were growing up.

1649
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:14,652
They were
beautiful letters.

1650
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:15,661
Yeah?

1651
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:17,163
Yeah.

1652
01:22:17,232 --> 01:22:20,167
I wasn't too sure
about the spelling in them.

1653
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:22,999
Who cares
if you can spell?

1654
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,335
There was...

1655
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:28,843
there was a lot of feeling
in the words.

1656
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:34,439
I'm so sorry for
what happened to you, Ronnie.

1657
01:22:34,516 --> 01:22:38,976
My mom called me
at school and told me.

1658
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:40,885
I was just so shocked.

1659
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:44,448
l... I wanted to...

1660
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:46,494
reach out and help you.

1661
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,154
But...

1662
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:51,994
it was just so frustrating,

1663
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:53,159
I just...

1664
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:57,227
stood in the hallway
of my dorm room shaking.

1665
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:59,273
I couldn't say anything.

1666
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:01,502
Donna.

1667
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:04,170
Uh, they need you
over at Locklin.

1668
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:06,406
I can't right now,
Jeff. Later.

1669
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:08,676
Well, don't forget
about the meeting.

1670
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:09,842
Yeah, 9:00?

1671
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:11,351
Yeah. Thanks.

1672
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:13,686
I'm sorry.

1673
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:15,188
You're real busy, huh?

1674
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:17,850
We've got this Kent State
demonstration tomorrow.

1675
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:19,518
I'm on the organizing
committee.

1676
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:21,858
Kent State.
I heard about that.

1677
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:23,363
It was... terrible.

1678
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:24,398
It's terrible.

1679
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:26,798
When I saw that girl

1680
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:29,803
lying in that pool of blood
at Kent State,

1681
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:32,305
I kept on thinking
of that poster

1682
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:35,070
of the children
that were killed at My Lai.

1683
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:38,579
And I kept on thinking
about you over there...

1684
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:41,080
and all the boys
who've died,

1685
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:45,916
who've sacrificed
their bodies and...

1686
01:23:45,987 --> 01:23:47,420
and their minds.

1687
01:23:48,656 --> 01:23:50,590
The war is
so wrong, Ronnie.

1688
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:52,717
It's so wrong.

1689
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:54,819
I just had to
do something.

1690
01:23:57,665 --> 01:24:02,432
~ We don't need arms ~

1691
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:06,907
~ We need hands to hold ~

1692
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:13,109
~ And we
don't need bombs... ~~

1693
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:15,672
Strike now,
shut it down!

1694
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,514
Strike now,
shut it down!

1695
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:20,520
Strike now,
shut it down!

1696
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:23,853
You know, Ronnie,
I'm not saying
that you are,

1697
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:27,190
but if you
have any feelings
against the war,

1698
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:29,696
you could really help.

1699
01:24:29,764 --> 01:24:31,698
I mean,
you've been there.

1700
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:33,358
You know what it's like.

1701
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:35,699
You could tell people
what's happening,

1702
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:38,204
and they'd really
listen to you.

1703
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:42,800
Remember the prom?

1704
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:44,970
~ Moon river ~

1705
01:24:45,046 --> 01:24:46,809
~ Wider than the sea ~

1706
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:49,145
~ My huckleberry friend... ~

1707
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:50,149
Remember that?

1708
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:51,344
Yeah.

1709
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:52,647
~ Moon river for me ~~

1710
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,755
Boy, was I crazy
that night.

1711
01:24:56,825 --> 01:25:00,659
I just had to
dance with you
before I went in.

1712
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:02,923
It was like I knew.

1713
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:06,990
I made a promise
to myself that
I would come back

1714
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:08,831
and love you forever.

1715
01:25:08,903 --> 01:25:10,598
Donna.
Hey, Donna.

1716
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:11,604
Yeah?

1717
01:25:11,673 --> 01:25:13,834
The reverend
can't make it tomorrow.

1718
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:14,840
What?

1719
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:16,171
He can't make it.

1720
01:25:16,244 --> 01:25:17,176
Oh, Jesus.

1721
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:19,679
What can we do?
Who can we get?

1722
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:22,511
Just let me think.
I'll see you later.

1723
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:23,516
Better hurry.

1724
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:25,018
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1725
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:29,580
Ronnie, I got to...
I got to go inside.

1726
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:31,591
Do you want to come?

1727
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:35,862
No, I don't think so.

1728
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:36,862
O.K.

1729
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,589
O.K.

1730
01:25:41,769 --> 01:25:42,963
Maybe I'll hang around.

1731
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:44,800
Maybe we'll talk later.

1732
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,975
All right.
I'll see you later.

1733
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:12,322
1, 2, 3, 4!

1734
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,799
We don't want
your stinking war!

1735
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:17,065
1, 2, 3, 4!
We don't want
your stinking war!

1736
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:18,833
All right! Wow!

1737
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:23,344
It's great to be at free
Syracuse University!

1738
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:30,013
We're really getting
an education now, aren't we?

1739
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:33,180
Right on, man!
Right on!

1740
01:26:33,254 --> 01:26:34,687
Right fucking on!

1741
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:37,020
Yesterday I was at
Brooklyn College...

1742
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:39,753
NYU. They were both
closed down!

1743
01:26:39,827 --> 01:26:42,455
Over 200 high schools
are closed down.

1744
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:44,862
Over 400 universities
are closed down.

1745
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:47,925
It'll be twice that number
by the time...

1746
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:53,204
This is an unlawful assembly.

1747
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:56,471
If you do not disperse...

1748
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:59,206
The people that killed
the kids at Kent State

1749
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,441
have names like
General Waste-more-land!

1750
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:06,514
Spiro Agnew!

1751
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:09,921
Tricky Dicky Nixon!

1752
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:13,059
<i>Wait for the command. </i>

1753
01:27:14,462 --> 01:27:16,487
And then we go
to Washington,

1754
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:20,125
confront the war makers
in their own house!

1755
01:27:20,201 --> 01:27:21,896
On to Washington!

1756
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:23,528
On to the White House!

1757
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:33,041
I loved this country once.

1758
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:35,048
And all this
I won over there.

1759
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:36,549
Check it out.

1760
01:27:36,618 --> 01:27:40,315
Purple heart,
bronze star,

1761
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:41,821
all the commendation
medals,

1762
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:44,323
all the rest
of that garbage.

1763
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:45,825
It don't mean a thing.

1764
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:49,351
Fuck this shit!

1765
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:54,166
This is war!

1766
01:27:54,235 --> 01:27:56,169
I said this is war!

1767
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:59,536
They just killed two brothers
atJackson State!

1768
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:01,438
Stand by to gas!

1769
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:08,708
Take them down!

1770
01:28:19,727 --> 01:28:22,161
What's going on?

1771
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:25,563
Get out!
Get out of here!

1772
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:27,100
Get out of here!

1773
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:28,294
Get back! Get back!

1774
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:39,437
Donna!

1775
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:49,888
The whole world's
watching!

1776
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:51,288
The whole world's
watching!

1777
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:53,259
The whole world's
watching!

1778
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:55,193
The whole world's
watching!

1779
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:56,423
The whole world's
watching!

1780
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:57,691
The whole world's
watching!

1781
01:28:57,765 --> 01:28:58,959
The whole world's
watching!

1782
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:00,159
Donna!

1783
01:29:08,142 --> 01:29:12,135
~ Now, when I was just
a little boy ~

1784
01:29:12,213 --> 01:29:15,979
~ I stand up
to my daddy's knee ~

1785
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:19,918
~ My papa said, son,
don't let the man get you ~

1786
01:29:19,987 --> 01:29:23,445
~ The way that
he done to me ~

1787
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:26,118
~ 'Cause
he'll get you now... ~

1788
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:27,126
He says...

1789
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,287
~ No, he'll get you... ~

1790
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:29,796
My machine breaks down,

1791
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:32,799
and they're ready
to cut my leg off.

1792
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:34,801
And that's what the guy...

1793
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:37,804
Now, that's what the guy
in the hospital said.

1794
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:39,806
He said, "You can
take your Vietnam,

1795
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:42,308
and you can stuff it
up your ass."

1796
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:45,210
That's what it's
about in Vietnam.

1797
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:47,213
Hey, Mel!
Double shot of rye,

1798
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:48,714
beer chaser,
sweetheart!

1799
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:51,217
They ain't fighting
the war to win, anyway.

1800
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:53,219
They should
just bomb Hanoi

1801
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:56,222
and get the boys
the fuck out of there.

1802
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:57,723
Four corner hard way.

1803
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:00,421
Vietnam.

1804
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:03,196
Vietnam.

1805
01:30:03,264 --> 01:30:05,198
They ought
to write a song

1806
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:07,632
about something
that gets under your skin.

1807
01:30:07,702 --> 01:30:09,135
Remember Del Shannon?

1808
01:30:09,203 --> 01:30:10,397
<i>Runaway? </i>

1809
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:12,564
~ As I walk along ~

1810
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:15,404
~ I wonder
what went wrong ~

1811
01:30:15,476 --> 01:30:17,876
~ To our love ~

1812
01:30:17,945 --> 01:30:20,539
~ A love
that was so strong ~

1813
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:22,048
~ Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa ~

1814
01:30:22,116 --> 01:30:24,050
~ I'll tell you
what went wrong ~

1815
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:27,349
~ It was Vietnam ~~

1816
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,413
It was the wrong war.

1817
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:32,220
Timmy, it was
the wrong war.

1818
01:30:32,293 --> 01:30:34,591
Take a shot, will you?

1819
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:36,596
You can take
your Vietnam,

1820
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:40,657
and you can
shove it up yo ass!

1821
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:43,169
Shove it
up your ass, pal.

1822
01:30:43,237 --> 01:30:45,228
Is everybody
supposed to feel sorry

1823
01:30:45,306 --> 01:30:47,740
because you're in
a fucking wheelchair?

1824
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:49,800
You ain't the only
marine here.

1825
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:51,637
I was on IwoJima.

1826
01:30:51,846 --> 01:30:53,814
We lost 5,000 men
the first day.

1827
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:56,441
Don't cry in your
beer to me.

1828
01:30:56,517 --> 01:30:57,950
Now, you served
and you lost.

1829
01:30:58,019 --> 01:30:59,452
You got to live with it.

1830
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,351
You're a marine, man.

1831
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:02,354
<i>Semper fi. </i>

1832
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:04,857
Picked them.
They didn't pick you.

1833
01:31:04,926 --> 01:31:07,759
Quit your fucking
pissing and moaning.

1834
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:11,230
Timmy, Timmy,
who is this asshole?

1835
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:13,233
I don't know.
Leave it alone.

1836
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:15,792
I think guys...

1837
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:16,802
like you...

1838
01:31:17,905 --> 01:31:20,703
are dumb fucking assholes.

1839
01:31:20,775 --> 01:31:22,208
That's what I think.

1840
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:24,744
I bet you do, you sorry
son of a bitch.

1841
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:26,746
'Cause you know
if they win,

1842
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:28,076
<i>if</i> they win it,

1843
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,083
you'll be the first
against the wall.

1844
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,745
You know you can't trust
a fucking traitor.

1845
01:31:35,423 --> 01:31:36,856
Call me a traitor?

1846
01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:38,892
If you weren't
in that chair...

1847
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,396
I <i>am</i> in this chair!

1848
01:31:42,463 --> 01:31:44,988
Top of the ninth,
Charlie!

1849
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:46,556
You shut up, man!

1850
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:48,431
Come on, Phil,
forget it!

1851
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:51,961
Come on, Ronnie,
he ain't worth it.

1852
01:31:52,039 --> 01:31:53,472
Will you come on?

1853
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:56,169
Hey, what's happening?
What's your name?

1854
01:31:56,244 --> 01:31:57,472
Jenny.

1855
01:31:57,545 --> 01:31:58,910
Penny?

1856
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:00,038
Jenny.

1857
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:03,106
How about going
to Mexico with me?

1858
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:06,119
Mexico?
What do you mean,
Mexico?

1859
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:09,623
I mean,
you're really beautiful.
That's what I mean.

1860
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:10,622
Oh, yeah?

1861
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:12,682
Oh, a really
beautiful place...

1862
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,489
The ocean...

1863
01:32:14,562 --> 01:32:15,995
The sand, sun.

1864
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:17,496
We could leave tonight.

1865
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:20,500
We could take a plane.
Let's go tonight.

1866
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:22,433
I think you're
really crazy.

1867
01:32:31,412 --> 01:32:32,936
Hey, hey, Billy!

Hey, Steve!

01:32:34,015 --> 01:32:34,947
What's going on?

1870
01:32:35,016 --> 01:32:37,644
Same old shit.

1871
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:41,245
~ Well, I can remember
the 4th ofJuly ~

1872
01:32:41,322 --> 01:32:43,256
~ Running through
the backwoods bay ~

1873
01:32:43,324 --> 01:32:44,552
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

1874
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:46,752
I bet you practiced
a lot.

1875
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:49,057
I've got a lifetime
of practice, Jenny.

1876
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:52,531
~ The way that
he done to me ~

1877
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,591
~ 'Cause
he'll get you now ~

1878
01:32:56,537 --> 01:32:58,004
~ Gonna getcha ~

1879
01:32:59,106 --> 01:33:00,164
~ Uhh ~

01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,141
~ Well,
I can remember... ~~

1881
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:03,642
You O.K.?
You all right?

1882
01:33:03,711 --> 01:33:05,144
I don't mean
to laugh.

1883
01:33:05,212 --> 01:33:06,679
Shut up, Jenny.

1884
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:09,011
Look at him.
He's fucking shitfaced.

1885
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:10,015
Ronnie?

1886
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:12,018
Ron?

1887
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:13,383
Ronnie?

1888
01:33:14,956 --> 01:33:16,389
Give him some room.

1889
01:33:16,457 --> 01:33:17,890
Get him out of here.

1890
01:33:17,959 --> 01:33:19,392
Give me my chair.

1891
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:20,893
Give me my chair.

1892
01:33:20,962 --> 01:33:22,896
I just want to dance.

1893
01:33:22,964 --> 01:33:24,898
I just want to dance.

1894
01:33:24,966 --> 01:33:27,025
Give me my chair.

1895
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:28,432
Jenny!

1896
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:29,696
Jenny!

1897
01:33:35,142 --> 01:33:37,576
I got it.
I got it.

1898
01:33:41,515 --> 01:33:42,880
Come on, come on.

1899
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:45,384
Hey, Steve,
let's go. Come on.

1900
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:54,661
Come on.
Steve, come on.

1901
01:33:54,729 --> 01:33:55,855
Let's go.

1902
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,203
What's going on?

1903
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:05,704
Are you drunk again?

1904
01:34:05,773 --> 01:34:06,705
Hey, Mom.

1905
01:34:06,774 --> 01:34:08,207
He's drunk again.

1906
01:34:08,275 --> 01:34:10,209
Eli, we have
a drunk for a son.

1907
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:11,710
You leave that alone.

1908
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:13,644
You can't stay
in this house.

1909
01:34:13,714 --> 01:34:16,148
This is what
you believe in,

1910
01:34:16,217 --> 01:34:17,650
but I don't.

1911
01:34:17,718 --> 01:34:19,652
I don't believe
in him anymore.

1912
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,654
I'll take care of him.

1913
01:34:21,722 --> 01:34:24,657
I wish I were dead
like him.

1914
01:34:24,725 --> 01:34:26,659
You don't know
what you're saying.

1915
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:28,160
That's the problem.
I'm not dead.

1916
01:34:28,229 --> 01:34:29,662
I got to live.

1917
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:31,527
I got to roll around

1918
01:34:31,599 --> 01:34:33,863
and remind them
of Vietnam.

1919
01:34:33,934 --> 01:34:35,868
You don't want to see us.

1920
01:34:35,936 --> 01:34:37,426
You want to hide us

1921
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:39,939
'cause it is a can of shit!

1922
01:34:40,007 --> 01:34:41,440
And I am a fucking dummy!

1923
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:43,443
He won't listen.
He won't change.

1924
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:44,944
Take your mom seriously.

1925
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:46,946
You can't drink
in this house.

1926
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:48,948
I believed everything
they told us.

1927
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:51,246
Go fight! Go kill!

1928
01:34:51,318 --> 01:34:52,751
Sergeant man,
Marine Corps!

1929
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:54,617
Yo, squad!
Left, squad!

1930
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,122
Right, squad, left!

1931
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:57,623
And it's all a lie.

1932
01:34:57,692 --> 01:35:01,389
The whole thing
is a bunch of lies!

1933
01:35:01,462 --> 01:35:03,327
Stop it! Go to bed!

1934
01:35:03,397 --> 01:35:06,696
What did they do to you
in that war?

1935
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:08,632
You need help, Ronnie.

1936
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:09,670
No, you need help,

1937
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:11,170
with all your God

1938
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:13,103
and your bullshit dreams
about me!

Well, uh, why don't you

Yeah, Lance.
He was a nice boy.

02:00:28,788 --> 02:00:30,779
For the life of me,

2315
02:00:30,856 --> 02:00:33,290
I still can't quite
figure that war out.

2316
02:00:33,359 --> 02:00:36,590
Why we had to go
all that dang way
to fight it

2317
02:00:36,662 --> 02:00:40,655
and why's we had to lose
so many young men.

2318
02:00:40,733 --> 02:00:42,598
Can't figure it out.

2319
02:00:44,036 --> 02:00:47,972
But we got a proud tradition
here in this town.

2320
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:51,771
Billy's great-grandfather
was at the first Bull Run.

2321
02:00:51,844 --> 02:00:54,972
My pa was
over in France in '18.

2322

Guadalcanal.

2324
02:01:00,119 --> 02:01:01,450
Is that right?

2325
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:04,455
Yeah. Well, I guess
this family's fought

2326
02:01:04,523 --> 02:01:07,959
in every war that, uh,
this country's ever had.

2327
02:01:08,027 --> 02:01:10,962
I reckon we're ready
to do it again

2328
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:12,554
if'n we have to.

'Course they never did know
what done happened and all.

2330
02:01:20,039 --> 02:01:23,873
There was a letter
from a colonel,

2331
02:01:23,943 --> 02:01:25,433

That's right,
Colonel Moore.

He said there was
a bad ambush one night.

2335
02:01:31,817 --> 02:01:35,913
Said that Billy
distinguished himself
in the fighting.

2336
02:01:35,988 --> 02:01:39,424
He also told us that
Billy died real quick.

2337
02:01:39,492 --> 02:01:42,325
That's good
that he died quick.

2338
02:01:57,043 --> 02:01:58,977
I was his squad leader.

2339
02:01:59,045 --> 02:02:01,479
I didn't know Billy
real well.

2340
02:02:01,547 --> 02:02:03,981
He was new,
kind of quiet.

2341
02:02:04,050 --> 02:02:07,952
We didn't talk much
to new guys.

2342
02:02:08,020 --> 02:02:10,454
He was 19,
is that right?

2343

and you were pregnant?

2348

the day he was killed.

2349
02:02:25,805 --> 02:02:29,764
Uh... it was
a strange day.

2350
02:02:29,842 --> 02:02:33,938
We were out on patrol
near a beach area...

2351
02:02:34,013 --> 02:02:37,244
and, oh,
it was very confusing.

2352
02:02:37,316 --> 02:02:39,978
There was screaming
and firing.

2353
02:02:40,052 --> 02:02:41,144
Uh...

2354
02:02:43,255 --> 02:02:44,745
It was getting late,

2355
02:02:44,824 --> 02:02:50,694
and there were these
children, uh...

2356
02:02:50,763 --> 02:02:53,960
these babies...

2357
02:02:54,033 --> 02:02:56,433
that we killed
by mistake.

2358

How awful.

2359
02:03:01,340 --> 02:03:03,001
And then it...

2360
02:03:03,075 --> 02:03:05,942
got really crazy.

2361
02:03:07,947 --> 02:03:10,211
And we had to pull back

2362
02:03:10,282 --> 02:03:14,616
because the NVA
were coming up on us.

2363
02:03:14,687 --> 02:03:17,656
And we got scattered
in the dunes.

2364
02:03:17,723 --> 02:03:19,247

2418
02:07:32,177 --> 02:07:33,508
Four more years!

2419
02:07:33,579 --> 02:07:35,137
Four more years!

2420
02:07:35,214 --> 02:07:36,238
Four more years!

2421
02:07:36,315 --> 02:07:38,010
Four more years!

2422
02:07:38,083 --> 02:07:39,880
Four more years!

2423
02:07:39,952 --> 02:07:41,749
Four more years!

2424
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:43,685
Four more years!

2425
02:07:43,756 --> 02:07:44,848
Four more years!

2426
02:07:44,923 --> 02:07:46,515
Can I break through
your complacency?

2427
02:07:46,592 --> 02:07:48,025
Do you have compassion

2428
02:07:48,093 --> 02:07:50,653
for the people
suffering in this war?

2429
02:07:50,729 --> 02:07:54,221
I'm telling you
this war is a crime!

2430
02:07:54,299 --> 02:07:58,030
I'm not as bitter
about my wounds...

2431
02:07:58,103 --> 02:08:01,334
Who do you think you are?

2432
02:08:01,407 --> 02:08:03,170
Can I help you, sir?
You can't come through.

2433
02:08:03,242 --> 02:08:04,174
You can't
come through, sir.

2434
02:08:04,243 --> 02:08:06,108
I have a pass.

2435
02:08:13,585 --> 02:08:14,950
Who are these people?

2436
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:17,420
You can't stop us!

2437
02:08:17,489 --> 02:08:19,013
You can't stop me!
You can't stop me!

2438
02:08:19,091 --> 02:08:20,615
Why are you
here tonight?

2439
02:08:20,693 --> 02:08:22,558
What do you
have to say?

2440
02:08:22,628 --> 02:08:25,529
My name's Ron Kovic.

2441
02:08:25,597 --> 02:08:27,030
I'm a Vietnam veteran.

2442
02:08:27,099 --> 02:08:29,966
I'm here to say
this war is wrong,

2443
02:08:30,035 --> 02:08:33,562
that this society lied
to me and my brothers...

2444
02:08:33,639 --> 02:08:34,970
Why don't you
shut up?

2445
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:37,838
<i>It deceived the people</i>
<i>in this country. </i>

2446
02:08:37,910 --> 02:08:41,471
<i>It tricked them</i>
<i>into going 13,000 miles</i>

2447
02:08:41,547 --> 02:08:45,847
<i>to fight a war against</i>
<i>a poor peasant people</i>

2448
02:08:45,918 --> 02:08:48,614
<i>who have a proud history</i>
<i>of resistance, </i>

2449
02:08:48,687 --> 02:08:52,521
<i>who have been struggling</i>
<i>for their own independence</i>

2450
02:08:52,591 --> 02:08:54,957
<i>for 1,000 years... </i>
<i>the Vietnamese people. </i>

2451
02:08:55,027 --> 02:08:58,895
<i>I can't... I can't find</i>
<i>the words to express</i>

2452
02:08:58,964 --> 02:09:01,899
<i>how the leadership</i>
<i>of this government sickens me. </i>

2453
02:09:01,967 --> 02:09:04,492
<i>Now, people say... </i>

2454
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:07,801
<i>people say if you</i>
<i>don't love America, </i>

2455
02:09:07,873 --> 02:09:09,306
<i>then get the hell out. </i>

2456
02:09:09,374 --> 02:09:10,807
<i>Well, I love America, </i>

2457
02:09:10,876 --> 02:09:13,811
<i>but when it comes</i>
<i>to the government, </i>

2458
02:09:13,879 --> 02:09:15,437
<i>it stops right there. </i>

2459
02:09:15,514 --> 02:09:18,176
<i>The government is</i>
<i>a bunch of corrupt thieves. </i>

2460
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:20,241
<i>They are rapists</i>
<i>and robbers. </i>

2461
02:09:20,319 --> 02:09:21,752
<i>We are here to say</i>

2462
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:23,754
<i>we don't</i>
<i>have to take it anymore. </i>

2463
02:09:23,822 --> 02:09:26,518
<i>We are here</i>
<i>to tell the truth. </i>

2464
02:09:26,592 --> 02:09:28,753
<i>They're killing</i>
<i>our brothers in Vietnam. </i>

2465
02:09:28,827 --> 02:09:30,522
<i>We want them</i>
<i>to hear the truth. </i>

2466
02:09:30,596 --> 02:09:31,585
Traitor!

2467
02:09:31,663 --> 02:09:33,893
What are you,
a Communist?

2468
02:09:36,268 --> 02:09:37,701
Is this what we get,

2469
02:09:37,770 --> 02:09:39,601
spit in the face?

2470
02:09:41,273 --> 02:09:42,706
Is this what we get?

2471
02:09:42,775 --> 02:09:44,766
Is this what we get,
spit in the face?

2472
02:09:44,843 --> 02:09:46,811
We're never going
to let the people

2473
02:09:46,879 --> 02:09:48,972
forget that war!

2474
02:09:50,282 --> 02:09:52,375
Four more years!

2475
02:09:52,451 --> 02:09:54,885
You're not sweeping it
under the rug

2476
02:09:54,953 --> 02:09:56,944
because you didn't
like the ratings.

2477
02:09:57,022 --> 02:09:58,182
This wheelchair,

2478
02:09:58,257 --> 02:09:59,189
our wheelchairs,

2479
02:09:59,258 --> 02:10:00,691
this steel, our steel

2480
02:10:00,759 --> 02:10:02,590
is your Memorial Day
on wheels.

2481
02:10:02,661 --> 02:10:05,095
We're your Yankee-Doodle
Dandy come home.

2482
02:10:05,164 --> 02:10:06,722
We're your
Yankee-Doodle Dandy.

2483
02:10:06,799 --> 02:10:08,357
<i>Let's reject any philosophy</i>

2484
02:10:08,433 --> 02:10:11,402
<i>that would make us</i>
<i>a divided people of America. </i>

2485
02:10:11,470 --> 02:10:13,836
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!

2486
02:10:13,906 --> 02:10:15,874
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!

2487
02:10:24,216 --> 02:10:25,979
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!

2488
02:10:26,051 --> 02:10:27,643
Some sort of scuffle

2489
02:10:27,719 --> 02:10:30,279
has broken out
on the convention floor,

2490
02:10:30,355 --> 02:10:32,789
disabled veterans
protesting the Vietnam War.

2491
02:10:32,858 --> 02:10:34,587
We'll try to
get down there.

2492
02:10:34,660 --> 02:10:38,187
Why are they gassing us
in the parking lot?

2493
02:10:38,263 --> 02:10:39,696
Why are they fighting us?

2494
02:10:39,765 --> 02:10:41,198
Because it's a lie.

2495
02:10:41,266 --> 02:10:44,827
The truth is they've killed
a generation of young men.

2496
02:10:44,903 --> 02:10:46,336
They have sacrificed

2497
02:10:46,405 --> 02:10:48,430
a whole generation
of young men.

2498
02:10:48,507 --> 02:10:49,940
Stop the bombing!

2499
02:10:51,009 --> 02:10:52,772
Stop the bombing!

2500
02:10:52,845 --> 02:10:54,312
Communists!

2501
02:10:54,379 --> 02:10:55,812
Communists!

2502
02:11:04,122 --> 02:11:05,214
Stop the bombing!

2503
02:11:05,290 --> 02:11:06,518
Stop the war!

2504
02:11:06,592 --> 02:11:08,253
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!

2505
02:11:08,327 --> 02:11:10,557

Get the car!

02:12:00,112 --> 02:12:01,545
Shut up!

Shut up!

You're a pig?

You should've died

2526

I don't have balance.

How many fingers

We're going to the gate,

2577
02:14:18,316 --> 02:14:20,750
we're taking
the hall back.

2578
02:14:20,819 --> 02:14:22,514
Fall out! Let's move!

2579
02:14:31,897 --> 02:14:33,831
1, 2, 3, 4,

2580
02:14:33,899 --> 02:14:36,163
we don't want
your fucking war!

2581
02:14:36,234 --> 02:14:37,667
1, 2, 3, 4,

2582

your fucking war!

2583

1, 2, 3, 4,

2584
02:14:41,740 --> 02:14:43,674
we don't want
your fucking war!

2585
02:15:07,332 --> 02:15:09,266
<i>Let us reject the notion</i>

2586
02:15:09,334 --> 02:15:11,268
<i>of politics of the few, </i>

2587
02:15:11,336 --> 02:15:13,736

Ransom, the feminist,
she's six minutes over.

2595
02:15:34,092 --> 02:15:36,026
I've got
theJackson people

2596
02:15:36,094 --> 02:15:37,356
breathing down my neck.

2597

Who follows?

2598
02:15:38,597 --> 02:15:39,859
It won't
be a problem.

2599
02:15:39,931 --> 02:15:41,057
You're next.

2600
02:15:41,133 --> 02:15:42,259
Mr. Kovic?

2601
02:15:42,334 --> 02:15:44,165
We're just about
ready for you.

2602
02:15:44,236 --> 02:15:45,601
Can I get you
anything?

2603
02:15:45,670 --> 02:15:47,035
Coke, iced tea?

2604
02:15:47,105 --> 02:15:48,538
Let's do it.

2605
02:15:48,607 --> 02:15:50,666
O.K., Ron.
It's your time.

2606
02:15:50,742 --> 02:15:53,302
It's been a long way
to get here.

2607
02:15:53,378 --> 02:15:55,312
Tell them what
it is, Ron!

2608
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:56,813
Come on, Ronnie!

2609
02:15:56,882 --> 02:15:59,350
Go get them, man.
For Eddie, man.

2610
02:15:59,417 --> 02:16:00,645
Ronnie

2611
02:16:00,719 --> 02:16:01,845
Whoo!
Whoo!

2612
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:04,354
The whole world's
watching. I love you.

2613
02:16:04,422 --> 02:16:05,855
All right, Frankie!

2614
02:16:05,924 --> 02:16:07,357
I feel good.

2615
02:16:07,425 --> 02:16:08,858
Ronnie for president.

2616
02:16:08,927 --> 02:16:10,519
Whoo!

2617
02:16:10,595 --> 02:16:12,256
Congratulations.

2618
02:16:12,330 --> 02:16:15,663
I love what
you're doing.

2619
02:16:15,734 --> 02:16:18,567
Clear a path
for me, please.
Stand back.

2620
02:16:18,637 --> 02:16:19,569
Thank you.

<i>I had a dream, Ronnie. </i>

2622

What will you
say tonight, Mr. Kovic?

2631
02:16:55,774 --> 02:16:57,833
I'm going
to tell the truth.

2632
02:16:57,909 --> 02:16:59,843
Any plans
for the future?

2633
02:16:59,911 --> 02:17:01,936
I guess we'll see.

2634
02:17:02,013 --> 02:17:04,948
Mr. Kovic,
could you please
sign your book?

All right, sweetheart.
Straight on through.

How does it feel

2641

Uh, overwhelming...

2642
02:17:19,130 --> 02:17:20,597
