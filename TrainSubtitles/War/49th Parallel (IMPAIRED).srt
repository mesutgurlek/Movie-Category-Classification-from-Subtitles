You see, we are like bees.

That's what I call a busy girl.

It's nothing.
I make 14 beds every night.

That's a lot of work.

743

00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:32,481
Drowned?

752
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,550
In the sea.

753
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,290
When we left Germany...

754
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,519
we went to England...

755
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:48,757
because we had to wait
until we got a permit to come to Canada.

756
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:53,225
We got our permit
after war was declared.

757
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:55,236
Was your father with you?

758
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:58,330
Wait a minute.
I want to hear about her mother.

759
00:57:58,441 --> 00:57:59,999
Her ship was sunk.

760
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,872
<i>[Kranz]</i>
<i>Torpedoed?</i>

761
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,741
I think so.

762
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,815
Don't you know?

763
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:08,315
- Was there a big explosion?
<i>- [Anna Whimpers]</i>

764
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:11,387
Shut up, you two.
You and your questions.

765
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:15,324
<i>Don't answer them, Anna</i>

766
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,527
Oh, leave that.

767
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:22,598
- Run along now.
- I'll take her home.

768
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:26,458
All right, you take her.

769
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,935
- Good night, Anna.
- Good night.

770
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,943
Chins up.

771
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:38,104
<i>[Hirth]</i>
<i>Remember then, do nothing without orders</i>

772
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:40,114
<i>Discipline is more important</i>
<i>now than ever</i>

773
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:42,275
<i>So far, luck has been with us</i>

774
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:45,286
<i>It's a great stroke of fortune</i>
<i>being here at all</i>

775
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:48,619
- Do you think they are friendly, <i>Herr Leutnant?</i>
- Friendly? Yes.

776
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:51,626
But you saw how their leader
tried to draw us out.

777
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:54,629
"Are you Germans?
Are you ashamed of being Germans?"

778
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:58,132
- That in a country with which we are at war.
- There can only be one answer to that.

779
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,429
Our agents have done their work well.

780
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,937
Yes. This religion may be
nothing but a cover.

781
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,940
I bet they sing the "Horst Wessel" song
better than hymns.

782
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,237
We shall see that tomorrow.
<i>Heil Hitler</i>

783
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:10,244
<i>Heil Hitlerl</i>

784
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,314
Shut the door.

785
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,947
<i>Well, Vogel, who knows?</i>

786
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,356
<i>Rerhaps one day the story of our adventures</i>
<i>will all be written in a book</i>

787
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:28,760
In a few years time, it may be the basis
of compulsory lectures to the Hitler Youth.

788
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:32,858
The ships we sank,
with women and children aboard...

789
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:35,529
the lifeboats we shelled —

790
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:38,539
mmm, we were good at that.

791
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:41,542
What we did to the Eskimos
at the post...

792
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:44,078
the unarmed men
we shot in the back.

793
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,081
You forget, Vogel, we're at war.

794
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:50,084
We can't expect to win
without the methods of total warfare.

795
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:53,952
Men, women and children — they're all
our enemies and must be treated as such.

796
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:57,857
Did you never read what Bismarck said?
"Leave them only their eyes to weep with."

797
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:03,390
"Leave them only their eyes
to weep with."

798
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,399
Did he say that?

799
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,664
<i>Those were his actual words</i>
<i>in the war of 1870</i>

800
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,899
<i>You should study Bismarck</i>
<i>He was a great German</i>

801
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,976
A great German.

802
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:17,235
You know, Vogel,
I'm worried about you.

803
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,713
You're a good fellow,
but you don't discipline yourself.

804
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:24,309
<i>You give way to emotions</i>
<i>That'll land you in trouble one of these days</i>

805
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:28,791

<i>a fine, soldierly fellow</i>

806
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:31,860
You could be just as good a Nazi as he is
if you tried.

807
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,697
- Are you listening, Vogel?
<i>- Yes,</i> Herr Leutnant.

808
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,700
- Then think it over.
<i>- Yes,</i> Herr Leutnant.

809
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:43,260
- And get out of bed and turn out the light.
<i>- Yes,</i> Herr Leutnant.

[Sighs]

811
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:03,692
Vogel, I —

[Snoring]

813
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,999
<i>- Herr Leutnant?</i>
- Either of you seen Vogel?

814
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:20,007
- No, <i>Herr Leutnant</i>
- Well, get dressed at once.

815
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:50,362
- [Woman] Good morning, friend.
- Good morning.

816
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,111
He's asking for you.

817
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,340
Oh? All right.

818
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:04,852
Well? Aren't you going?

819
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:07,855
Well, I can't go
till I've got this lot ready.

820
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:09,857
What shall I tell him?

821
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,086
I'll be along in a minute.

822
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:17,966

Ah.

825
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,036
Now, that's what I call bread.

<i>[David] Trick or no trick,</i>
<i>I could never make bread as good as that</i>

828
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:38,185
Cheer up, David.
It took me seven years.

829
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:42,018
<i>- Why ever did you want to give it up?</i>
- I didn't want to give it up. I had to.

830
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:44,286

Good morning, friend.

833
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:55,001
Mr. Vogel is the best baker
we've had here in 15 years.

836
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:06,306
Congratulations, Vogel.
It was a good idea.

837
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,647
Round the barn!

838
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,906
What's the news in Winnipeg?

839
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,808
The market was good for geese.
People are asking for Hutterite geese.

840
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:12,005
I don't like that, Andreas.

841
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,275
No?

842
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:18,513
For 300 years our brethren
have wandered from place to place...

843
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:21,089
from country to country...

844
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,488
because of the jealousy of others.

845
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,352
This is a good country, Andreas.

846
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:32,093
- I met Frau Habermann.
- Yes? Oh, her trial was on today, wasn't it?

847
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:36,501
Her husband and her eldest son, Eric,
are to be interned. She is free.

848
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,940
Bad luck...

849
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,942
just at harvest time.

850
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,444
It wasn't a good day for the trial.

851
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:49,280
Papers are full of stories about those Germans
who landed from a U-boat down north.

852
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,616
They seem to have acted like wild beasts,
killing and stealing.

853
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,623
- What's Frau Habermann going to do?
- I had a talk with her.

854
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,956
- She needs help on the farm.
- It'll be difficult.

855
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:03,225
We'll talk it over. Tell the others
we'll have a meeting tonight, yes?

856
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:06,233
[Exhales]
Air's heavy.

857
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:09,304
I'm afraid we're going to
have a storm tonight.

858
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,406
Sorry.
Sorry I'm late, Peter.

859
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:15,636
Barbarina, there's an electric storm
playing all around us...

860
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,838
frightening the animals
and your chickens.

861
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:21,110
- Move over, Philip.
<i>- What about you, Anna?</i>

862
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,117
- Andreas.
- Huh?

863
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,120
- One of our guests is speaking.
- Eh? What? Oh! Good!

864
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,190
We're discussing the Habermanns.

865
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,555
I was about to say...

866
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,458
you have one clear choice.

867
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:35,723
Where there is a question of blood...

868
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:39,392
where one is governed
by the deepest of racial instincts...

869
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:42,630
then every other consideration
is swept aside.

870
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:49,208
Men like yourself—
German, or of German ancestry—

871
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:53,248
<i>rise up with all the might and power</i>
<i>of the great German people behind you</i>

872

conscious of the sacred duty
that binds us all together...

873
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:59,153
and in the knowledge that he
who doesn't forget his people...

874
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,723
will not by his people be forgotten.

875
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:05,684
There is a new wind
blowing from the east...

876
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,922
a great storm
coming across the sea...

877
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:13,330
<i>a hurricane which will sweep aside</i>
<i>all the old, outmoded ways oflife</i>

878
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:16,462
<i>and mark the beginning of a new order,</i>
<i>not only for Europe</i>

<i>but for the whole world</i>

01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:23,201
Let those beware who would have
the temerity to stand in its way.

881
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,746
They will go down
before its irresistible impulse...

882
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:29,306
and be crushed out of existence!

883
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:33,616
<i>But for those who accept the new order</i>
<i>or those who perhaps belong to it already</i>

884
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:37,625
why need I use
these parables of speech any longer?

885
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:39,888
I mean, all of you here tonight —

886
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,692
yes, you, brothers —

887
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:45,824
I call you brothers
and proudly acknowledge you as such.

888
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:49,098
You who formed a little stronghold
of our people here in Canada...

889
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:52,106
you will have your share
of the happiness and prosperity...

890
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:56,440
that is waiting for us all
when the storm is over and the sun rises —

891
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:58,513
that mighty sun —

892
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,917
<i>which will give us</i>
<i>everything we need in life</i>

893

What sun are you
talking about, friend?

894
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:08,980
I am talking of
the greatest idea in history—

895
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:12,891
supremacy of the Nordic race,
the German people.

896
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:17,193
I am talking of the being whose name
I am certain lives in every heart...

897
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,995
whose name hangs on all our lips...

898
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:25,062
whether we can shout it to the world
or only whisper it in one another's ears.

01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:35,682
I ask you to join with me
in paying homage to our glorious führer.

902
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,653
<i>Heil Hitlerl</i>

903
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:40,654
[Kranz, Lohrmann]
<i>Heil Hitlerl</i>

904
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:43,725
<i>[Thunder Rumbling]</i>

905
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:07,212
I don't ask where you come from
or what brought you here...

906
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,781
although you've left us
in no doubt as to your beliefs.

907
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:17,455
Someone has given you,
no doubt deliberately...

908
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,926
a completely false impression of us.

909
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:25,263
We are only one amongst
many foreign settlements in Canada.

910
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:28,825
There are thousands of them
in this part of the world.

911
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:34,171
And they have been founded,
some recently, some 80 years ago...

912
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:38,906
by people who left their homes
in Europe because of famine...

913
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:41,107
because of starvation...

914
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:43,685
because of racial
and political persecution...

915
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:47,085
and some, like ourselves,
because of their faith.

916
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:50,647
<i>Some came only to find new land</i>

917
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:53,421
<i>new boundaries, a new world</i>

918
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:57,989
But all have found here in Canada...

919
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,159
the security...

920
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:04,933
the peace and tolerance
and understanding...

921
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,668
which, in Europe...

922
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:12,072
it is your führer's pride
to have stamped out.

923
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:15,610
<i>You call us Germans</i>

924
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:19,176
You call us brothers.

925
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:23,191
Yes. Most of us are Germans.

926
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,692
Our names are German.
Our tongue is German.

927
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:29,594
Our old handwritten books
are in German script.

928
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:34,158
But we are not your brothers.

929
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:38,172
Our Germany is dead.

930
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:43,372
However hard this may be
for some of us older people...

931
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:46,380
it's a blessing for our children.

932
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:50,782
Our children grew up against
new backgrounds, new horizons.

933
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:54,287
And they are free...

934
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:57,826
free to grow up as children...

935
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:02,364
free to run and to laugh
without being forced into uniforms...

936
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:05,524
without being forced to march
up and down the streets...

937
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:08,125
singing battle songs.

938
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:13,372
You talk about a new order in Europe.

939
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:19,870
The new order...

940
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:22,075
where there will not be one corner...

941
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:26,052
not a hole big enough for a mouse...

942
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:29,613
where a decent man can breathe freely.

943
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:35,118
<i>You think we hate you, but we don't</i>

944
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:38,394
It is against our faith to hate.

945
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:42,402
We only hate the power of evil
which is spreading over the world.

946
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:46,838
You and your Hitlerism...

947
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:52,842
are like the microbes
of some filthy disease...

948
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:57,408
filled with a longing
to multiply yourselves...

949
01:10:57,519 --> 01:11:03,014
until you destroy everything
healthy in the world.

950
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,818
No.

951
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:11,764
We are not your brothers.

952
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,881
What do you want?

953
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:31,180
I am come to tell you that
you can make your own beds.

954
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,187
I don't want to work for you.

955
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,553
<i>[Vogel]</i>
<i>That's all right, Anna Run along now</i>

956
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:38,650
You're Nazis, aren't you?

957
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:41,252
Aren't you?

958
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:44,059
We're not allowed to hate anybody.

959
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:47,294
But I hate you.

960
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:50,600
I believed you'd escaped
from an internment camp.

961
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:52,606
I should tell the police about you.

962
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,271
You killed my father...

963
01:11:57,379 --> 01:12:02,339
because he said your führer
was the Antichrist.

964
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:05,249
You drowned my mother.

965
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:07,481
I hate you.

966
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:09,489
I hate you!

967
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:12,617
So you're going to tell
the police about us, are you?

968
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,358
Little girls should be seen
and not heard.

969
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:18,433
- That will do.
- What's the matter with you?

970
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:21,697
<i>- That will dol</i>
- Vogel.

971
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:25,103
Come along, Anna.
I'll take you home.

972
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:28,540
<i>- Herr Leutnant,</i> we can't let them go.
- I'd like to see what you're
going to do about it.

973
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:30,441
- Vogel!
- Yes, <i>Herr Leutnant</i>

974
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:32,605
Have you forgotten who you are?

975
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:35,616
<i>- No,</i> Herr Leutnant.
- Let the girl go and shut the door.

976
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:38,653
I'll take her home, <i>Herr Leutnant</i>

977
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:40,415
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

978
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:57,602
Is that you, Anna?

979
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:00,231
Yes, Peter.

980
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:04,446
I brought Anna home.

981
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,687
She's all right.

982
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:32,700
We're going now,
perhaps in a few minutes.

983
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:36,266
I only wanted to say that
you've been kind and I like it here.

984
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:39,677
You like my bread,
and I like the way you live.

985
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:43,912
Being with you has made me feel
like it used to be at home.

986
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:46,647
I'd almost forgotten
what it was like...

987
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:50,191
baking bread,
doing my real work.

988
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:54,786
That's how it used to be seven years ago
before everything changed.

989
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:59,197
The life I've been living
seems to have no sense in it now.

990
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,394
Well, I'd better go now.

991
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:03,494
Please don't go.

992
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:13,579
- Are they still talking?
- Hush, child. Go to sleep.

993
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:18,642
How can a man like you, Vogel —

994
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:22,417
I mean, you're a simple,
good human being.

995
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:28,156
How can you get mixed up
with such a lot of gangsters?

996
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:30,629
What can you do?

997
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:34,031
When you're a boy,
you like playing soldiers.

998
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:38,072
When you're a young man, you can't
get work unless you belong to them.

999
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:41,108
When you're an old man,
you're anxious not to lose what you've got.

1000
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:44,179
But there are thousands
of men like you, Vogel...

1001
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:46,406
men who don't like
the way things are going.

1002
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:48,415
I suppose so.

1003
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:51,486
I suppose they don't know
themselves. I didn't know.

1004
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:55,921
It's as if a blind man said
he doesn't know the sun shines.

1005
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:59,790
- I suppose so.
- Why don't you stay with us, Vogel?

1006
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:05,696
- Do you mean it?
- Of course I mean it.

1007
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:08,634
Even if you know who I am,
where I come from—

1008
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:12,173
I don't care who you are
or where you come from.

1009
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:15,573
- I know you.
- Thank you, Peter.

1010
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:20,070
- It will mean internment.
- What's it matter?

1011
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,412
I'll come back after the war.

1012

You don't believe

Such a thing couldn't happen

and the six Germans who escaped.

The best thing that's
happened to us is meeting you.
You've put the heart back into us.

There are millions like us in Germany.

Any more of your sort here,

<i>Let's get him</i>

1351
01:44:26,193 --> 01:44:29,856
- Which one of them two is it, Boss?
- I don't know. Did you see, George?

1352
01:44:30,697 --> 01:44:32,426
All right, George?

1353
01:44:34,368 --> 01:44:38,099
I forgot to tell you, Art.
He's got my Colt, too.

1354

See that hole?

1355
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:46,110
That's gonna cost him seven bucks
before I let the Mounties get him.

1356
01:44:46,213 --> 01:44:48,113
That means he's got four shots left.

you ought to take any—
- Let me stay with you, Mr. Scott.

- Yes, the Canadian papers.

The Nazi papers call them heroes.

1361

Two brave Nazis
against 11 million Canadians.

Say, Mr. Scott.

You all right, Boss?

1377
01:46:49,436 --> 01:46:53,372
Well, you can't expect me to capture
an armed Nazi without getting hurt a little.

1378
01:46:53,473 --> 01:46:56,738
- Yet —
- Here. Let me have a look at that.

1379

The boss has knocked him cold.

Well, he had a fair chance.

1381

One armed superman...

But things don't work out

I save a bit of money,

"We want men to fight the Nazis. Join today."

01:55:52,578 --> 01:55:54,603
In two minutes,
I shall be across the border.

1495
01:55:54,714 --> 01:55:57,376
Once there were six of us.
Now I represent them all.

1496
01:55:57,483 --> 01:55:59,383
Field Marshall Göring has said...

1497
01:55:59,485 --> 01:56:03,581
"It doesn't matter as long as we have
only one plane and one man left,

We've beaten these dirty democracies,
these weaklings.

1500
01:56:19,839 --> 01:56:21,739
I tell you, we've something inside us...

1501
01:56:21,841 --> 01:56:25,106
something beyond the dim, muddied
minds of you in the democracies.

the whole democratic system.

You don't like it any more than I do.
You don't like the job they've given you.

- Why, you spoon-fed louse.

1510
01:56:52,705 --> 01:56:57,108
I can grouse about the food and the C.O.
And anything I blame please.

Don't do it. Send him back.
He's an escaping Nazi.

He slugged me.
That's my uniform.

- Hey, this gun is loaded.
- No.

1533
01:58:25,698 --> 01:58:27,666
By your American law,
you must take me to my consul.

1534
01:58:27,767 --> 01:58:29,894
- Is that right?
- I'm afraid it is.

1535
01:58:30,002 --> 01:58:33,267

You've got to send him back.
He's not just an escaping Nazi. He's important.

1538
01:58:39,879 --> 01:58:42,507
The whole German nation is waiting
to see if he can get away with it.

No.

1542

- Same way. Two unlisted items.

1556
01:59:38,237 --> 01:59:40,228
But your law refers to freight,
not to persons.

1557
01:59:40,339 --> 01:59:43,638
This is a freight car,
