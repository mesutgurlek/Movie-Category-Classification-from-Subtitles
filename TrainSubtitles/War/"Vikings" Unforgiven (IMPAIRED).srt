Thorvard: The Saxons treacherously

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,755
The king and his son, Erlendur,
escaped with their lives.

00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:14,999
I know things about Ragnar
Lothbrok you do not know.

8

Lagertha: Bjorn is very happy here.

11
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:25,400
Then you both should stay.

<i>and to kill him with my bare hands.</i>

17

Are you unhappy?

30
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:45,720
Do you think the gods have cheated you?

Siggy: I want my old position back.

Everything I had, everything I possessed,

everything that I was
has been stripped away from me.

35
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:12,880
And my anger is like a stone...

36
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:18,753
A stone that I carry inside me

37
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:22,290
that... Weighs me down.

38
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:26,928

I ask you once more,

46
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:53,789
will the gods ever smile on me again?

47

<i>Seer: The gods will always smile
on brave women,</i>

48
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:01,564
like the Valkyries,

49
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:06,369
those furies who men fear and desire.

<i>Man: Erik!</i>

You'll have to forgive
the poverty of the feast.

57
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:05,861
It has been a hard winter.

58
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,797
We had to burn our own grain stores

59
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:09,699
to rid ourselves of Jarl Borg.

60
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,534
Horik: So I heard.

61
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,671
Ragnar: Tell us, Erlendur,

62
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,541
what happened in England, after we left?

63
00:04:20,744 --> 00:04:24,213
<i>King Horik: Ecbert never meant to
honor his promises to you.</i>

64
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:28,851
We were betrayed, taken by surprise;

65
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,487
<i>Erlendur and I barely
escaped with our lives.</i>

66
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:34,757
What about Athelstan? Where is he now?

67
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:39,395
If he is fortunate, he died in battle.

68
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:42,431
<i>In any case, let's not speak of him.</i>

69
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:47,169
He was a worthless individual.

70
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,705
<i>Bjorn: Poor Athelstan.</i>

71
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:52,608
My sister and I grew to love him
when we were children.

72
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:55,945
<i>Floki: He fooled you, young Bjorn.</i>

73
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:59,281
He never denounced his Christian God!

74
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,551
He was our enemy.

75
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:05,588
We should rejoice at his death.

76
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:12,361
So... What do you intend on doing now?

77
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:15,331
King Horik: What do you think, Ragnar?

78
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,901
I intend on gaining revenge on King Ecbert.

79
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:21,871
We should plan a raid as soon as possible.

80
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:24,673
<i>Rollo: I would be very
happy to take part in it.</i>

81
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:27,209
King Ecbert should certainly be punished.

82
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,180
I agree.

83
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:34,417
We should return to Wessex.

84
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:36,919
<i>But first, Jarl Borg must pay the price</i>

85
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,590
for what he did to my family
and to our people.

86
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:46,529
(Water pours)
Porunn: (Gasps)

87
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,264
Forgive me, master.

88
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:51,500
No, it doesn't matter.

89
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,935
<i>King Horik: I understand, completely,</i>

90
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:54,603
<i>and if I were you,
I would feel the same way.</i>

91
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:57,440
<i>But we must remember our agreement</i>

92
00:05:57,507 --> 00:05:59,742
<i>and what it was for.</i>

93
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:04,447
We would sail west to raid and to colonize.

94
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:09,785
That was your dream, Ragnar,
and I have come to share it.

95
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:13,622
But now we have neither
the men nor the ships

96
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,326
to realize our dreams.

97
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:21,397
- What are you saying?
- I think we should go back to Jarl Borg.

98
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:23,199
He is licking his wounds.

99
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,633
He is no longer as strong as he was.

100
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:28,437
And, yet, we need him.

101
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:31,707
We cannot go west without his ships.

102
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,542
And so, once again,

103
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,612
we should ask him to join our alliance.

104
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:45,554
Aslaug: (Whispers quietly)
Don't listen to him.

105
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:48,190
Rollo: But who should go to Jarl Borg?

106
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:51,327
<i>King Horik: I think it should be you Rollo.</i>

107
00:06:51,428 --> 00:06:55,431
After all, you know him better than anyone.

108
00:06:57,232 --> 00:06:58,532
What do you think?

109
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:06,809
(Wind howls)

110
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,511
Farewell, my love.

111
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:11,714
I will pray to Thor
that he grant you safe passage.

112
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:15,518
<i>Warrior 1: Throw that!</i>

113
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:19,455
King Horik: May you have success, Rollo,
for the sake of all of us.

114
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,892
<i>Warrior 1: Man your stations.
Warrior 2: Stores aboard.</i>

115
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:33,302
Warrior 1: All the men aboard!

116
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,671
Torstein: Rollo.

117
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:37,373
<i>Warrior 2: Try the sail then.</i>

118
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,409
I, too, wish you well.

119
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,745
Those words mean a lot coming from you.

120
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:46,982
They were hard to say. Now they are said.

121
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,490
Cast away!

122
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,193
<i>Warrior 1: Ready the oars!</i>

123

(Fire crackles)

127
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,389
Horik: It has an unusual taste, wine.

128
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,726
But then, you're an unusual woman, Siggy.

129
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:36,899
I hope you do not mind
I brought my son with me?

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,637
I want him to start to understand the game.

131
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:43,172
The game?

132
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,175
The game you and I play.

133
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:50,779
The game Ragnar tries to play.

134
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:53,315
Are you sure it is a game?

135
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:59,922
Why do you invite me to your bed?

136
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:03,959
Why do you tell me things about Ragnar?

137
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:12,234
Everything I do, I do for Rollo.

138
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:16,972
And not for yourself?

139
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:19,173
If Rollo rises, I rise also.

140
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,445
And you need my help!

(Chuckles)

142
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:28,317

00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:32,755
<i>and strangely ignorant
of other things as well.</i>

<i>and they were nothing... Slaves, girls.</i>

146
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:44,266
I want him to enjoy the attentions

147

00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:35,180
We don't really have poets here anymore.

164
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,648
Poets to entertain us!

165
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:41,583
Sing to us!

166
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:44,319
Make us laugh.

167
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:49,392
<i>I remember when this great hall
was always full of laughter.</i>

168
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,928
Laughter and good fellowship.

169
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,732
<i>Woman: You can see it in her eyes.</i>

170
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,468
My wife has returned to me.

171
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:03,338
(Scoffs) That's good.

172
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:05,207
Men: (Chuckling)

173
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,377
She went without my permission.

174
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,346
But, as you can all see, she has come back

175
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:13,782
and I love her for it.

176
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,788
<i>After all, what man wouldn't be pleased</i>

177
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:22,858
at the return of such a wife?

178
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:27,262
Skol!

179
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:29,364
Crowd: Skol!

180
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:35,237
Lagertha: Skol, husband.

181
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,317
Unfortunately, you left my stepson behind.

182
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,187
Man: It's time to leave.

183
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:55,724
(Women quietly withdraw)

184
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:58,060
Woman: Gerta, take my hand. Come. Come.

185
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,133
He's old enough to decide.

186
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:07,135
Is it not enough that I came back?

187
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:11,240
No, it's not enough, my dear wife,

188
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:13,308
<i>it's... It's not enough!</i>

189
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:16,278
Of course it's not enough.
It's an insult to me!

190
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:18,914
What else could I have done?

191
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:21,216
His father is Ragnar Lothbrok.

192
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,986
(Sudden thud, cup clatters)

193
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,692
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?!

194
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:33,695
<i>Nothing but a windbag, an opportunist.</i>

195
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:36,465
A man so bloated with self-importance

196
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:38,934
he pretends to be descended from Odin!

197
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:42,237
<i>(Men laugh)</i>

198
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:44,640
He doesn't need to pretend anything.

199
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:47,809
(Drunken stumble, objects clatter)

200
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:56,251
Now I know for sure
why you went to defend him.

201
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:58,754
Not to repulse a foreign invader,

202
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:01,390
as you lied to me,

203
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:03,892
but because you're still in love with him.

204
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,731
You're still in love with Ragnar Lothbrok,

205
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:15,637
aren't you, wife?

206
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,811
(Drunken stumble, objects clatter)

207
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:25,714
You can sleep alone tonight.

208
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:28,550
I have made other arrangements.

209
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:33,655
<i>(Howling in the distance, owl hoots)</i>

210

(Pained grunts, fighting grunts)

217
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:02,985
Lagertha: Ungh!

218
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:07,222
(Pained grunts)

219
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,561
(Repeated blows, grunts of effort)

220
00:15:21,191 --> 00:15:24,260
Master, can I help you?

221
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:27,530
I was going to ask you the same question.

222
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:29,932
Those buckets look very heavy.

223
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,001
I'm used to it.

224
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:38,541
Bjorn: What is your name?

225
00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:40,643
Porunn: Porunn.

226
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:44,680
Sit a moment.

227
00:15:44,748 --> 00:15:46,682
I have to finish my work.

228
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,619
It is all right.

229
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,621
<i>Man: Please don't insult my ancestors.</i>

230

(Metallic clanking, sheep bleating)

233
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:08,404
Where do you sleep?

234
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:10,139
In that barn

235
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:14,310
with the other servants and animals.

236
00:16:14,378 --> 00:16:19,382
Do you... Have a boyfriend?

237
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,486
Of course!

238
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:28,124
(Sheep bleats)

239
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:31,661
I must finish my work.

240

(Chickens cluck, sheep bleat)

241

<i>Woman: Sven! Sven!</i>

<i>Aslaug: She is remarkably good looking.</i>

243

Ragnar: If you say so.

00:16:57,654 --> 00:17:01,390
Hor decide everything?

245
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:06,963
Can you really forgive Jarl Borg?

246
00:17:09,499 --> 00:17:12,501
Do you know how much I
suffered because of him?

247
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:15,137
How much your sons suffered?

248
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:21,143
Yes, I know.

249
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:24,280
But you do nothing about it!

250
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:26,048
By insulting and humiliating me,

251
00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:30,887
he insulted and humiliated you!

252
00:17:30,954 --> 00:17:33,422
My father never would have
allowed such a thing.

253
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:35,758
He would have been revenged.

254
00:17:38,395 --> 00:17:41,998
Your father cannot do too much now,

255
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:44,333
being dead.

256
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:52,942

(Slow, calming breath)

259
00:18:07,124 --> 00:18:09,558
Jarl Borg: Sit down.

00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:12,628
(Approaching footsteps)

261
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,608
What is that?

262
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:33,049
Jarl Borg: The skull of my first wife.

263
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,619
She continues to advise me.

264
00:18:40,157 --> 00:18:43,960
Is that fair to her?

265
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:48,433
So... Your brother wants me
to come and fight for him?

266
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:53,202
He wants to rebuild the original alliance

267
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,604
between himself, King Horik, and you.

268
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:01,344
He believes that, in our small countries,

269
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:07,917
cooperation is the only way forward.

270
00:19:08,018 --> 00:19:11,487
So he does not want revenge upon me?

271
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:15,124
After all, I invaded his lands.

272
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:18,427
Men like you and I will
always look for revenge.

273
00:19:20,564 --> 00:19:22,331
Ragnar looks beyond.

274
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:27,203
Then he is a most extraordinary man indeed.

275
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,940
As forgiving as a Christian!

276
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:34,977
He is also a practical man.

277
00:19:35,078 --> 00:19:38,881
He and King Horik have lost a lot of men.

278
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:42,284
They need you to help them raid.

279
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,994
<i>Jarl Borg: What do you say, my love?</i>

(Inhales deeply and kisses skull)

281
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:06,475
You think I should go?

282
00:20:10,747 --> 00:20:13,749
She thinks I should go.

283
00:20:16,686 --> 00:20:20,723

<i>(Bell tolls)</i>

You have a great gift, Athelstan.

00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:50,786
I believe it is a... A divine gift.

287
00:20:52,122 --> 00:20:54,290
Athelstan: Thank you, sire.

288
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:58,327
I thought I might have forgotten, but...

289
00:20:58,428 --> 00:21:00,896
I love these materials.

290
00:21:00,964 --> 00:21:05,134
Brushes, the paints, the colors.

291
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:09,438
I had not appreciated
how much I missed my work.

292
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:12,475
The pagans have nothing like it?

293
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:15,211
Athelstan: No. They have no art.

294
00:21:17,347 --> 00:21:18,681
They can neither read nor write,

295
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:21,584
except for their carved runes.

296
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:24,320
King Ecbert: Mm.

297
00:21:24,387 --> 00:21:26,594
And their gods?

298
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:29,895
Uh... Odin and Thor and Freyr.

299
00:21:31,695 --> 00:21:34,697
How strange you must have found them?

300
00:21:38,135 --> 00:21:40,503
Their gods are very old.

301
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:43,539
And sometimes I could not help
noticing some similarities

302
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:46,342
with our own God, and his son.

303
00:21:50,514 --> 00:21:52,515
Come with me.

304
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,156
<i>King Ecbert: Tell me honestly:</i>

305

<i>What do you think of these works?</i>

306
00:22:06,062 --> 00:22:09,064
Athelstan: I find them
indescribably beautiful.

307
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:13,169
King Ecbert: But they are clearly pagan!

308
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,038
(Laughs)

309
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:17,573
You are only a monk, Athelstan,

310
00:22:17,641 --> 00:22:21,677
and yet, somehow, I begin to trust you.

311
00:22:21,778 --> 00:22:26,649
I feel you... You are a kindred spirit.

312
00:22:31,521 --> 00:22:36,659
Who? Who painted the?

313
00:22:36,726 --> 00:22:40,062
What race of man was ever so glorious

314

<i>that they filled our world with such,</i>

315
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:46,001
as you say, indescribable beauty?

316
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:50,973
I have been told, sire,

317
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:54,343
<i>that you served at the court
of the emperor Charlemagne,</i>

318
00:22:54,444 --> 00:22:57,012
<i>which I have also visited.</i>

319
00:22:57,113 --> 00:22:58,480
I cannot imagine, therefore,

320
00:22:58,548 --> 00:23:02,151
that you do not know what I know.

321
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:04,920
<i>That these images were
painted by the Romans.</i>

322
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:07,223
<i>They conquered these lands
a long time ago.</i>

323
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,024
They conquered the whole world.

324
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,663
But they were pagans.
They worshipped false gods.

325
00:23:18,301 --> 00:23:23,072
Never speak of our conversation
to any other man here.

326
00:23:23,173 --> 00:23:25,975
Nobody else would understand it;

327
00:23:26,076 --> 00:23:28,344

328

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,030
we have lost more knowledge
than we ever had!

335

These romans knew things
that we will never know.

Their pagan gods allowed them
to rule the world.

that we can learn from that?

can I say, in all honesty,

00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:29,327
a greater man than I am.

388
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:31,396
I know I don't deserve

389
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:32,831
to raid and work with you,

390
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:36,301
but I swear on my ring,

391
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:38,169
from henceforth, you've no reason

392
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:39,704
to doubt my loyalty,

393
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:43,975
or my commitment to our common cause.

394

If we are being honest,

395
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:49,381
I can tell you that it was King Horik

396
00:29:49,448 --> 00:29:53,985
who argued for a renewal of our alliance.

397
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:57,122
As you can imagine,

398
00:29:57,189 --> 00:30:01,760
I was not, at first, enthusiastic.

399
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:08,166
But then... Then I realized

400
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:11,536
what could be gained by inviting you.

401
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:17,409
We have much to gain if we work together,

402
00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:19,844
and a lot to lose if we don't.

403
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:25,183

Yes, my lord.

Ragnar: Put Jarl Borg's men in the
barn which the servants use.

409
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,201
And treat them with respect.

410

Of course, my lord.

411

I never once for a moment

414
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:02,954
imagined Ragnar would take my advice,

415
00:31:03,055 --> 00:31:06,825

to rejoin our alliance.

Whatever you think he will do,

418

he will always do the opposite.
