1
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,443
We need blood, damn it.
Lots of it and then some.

2
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,849
I had to get rid of every
drop we had in stock.

3
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:03,853
You heard right, Captain.

4
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:06,389
Couple of boys we treated
turned up later with hepatitis.

5
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:09,858
And you don't catch that
sitting in a draft.

6
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:12,589
If you can't do anything,
put me on to someone who can...

7
00:01:12,663 --> 00:01:15,291
someone with
a little authority, Captain!

8
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,667
Who's this?
Sergeant Frankle?

9
00:01:19,737 --> 00:01:22,729
Peachy. Sergeant, I've told
everyone else. I'll tell you.

10
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:27,176
The 4077 th is out of blood.
We're squeezing turnips here.

11
00:01:27,244 --> 00:01:30,008
All my personnel have donated
at least twice.

12
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,311
Dracula couldn't find a quick snack
around these parts.

13
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:36,345
You're either gonna have to get us
some blood or call off the war.

14
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:39,212
- We're doling it out by the corpuscle now.
- Hold on, Pierce.

15
00:01:39,284 --> 00:01:42,185
- I'll wait, Sgt.
- I just gave that Turkish
captain another ten units...

16
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:44,187
bringing his grand total up to 30.

17
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:47,281
- That's a complete oil change in 24 hours.
- I'm trying to order some.

18
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,724
- Tie up your horses.
- I am. We might need 'em as donors.

19
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:51,728
Yes, Sergeant. What?

20
00:01:51,796 --> 00:01:55,459
Which flunky
am I talking to now?

21
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:58,991
Oh, excuse me, Colonel, but I've
been getting the royal runaround.

22
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,597
I appreciate you boys are low down
there, but this is an emergency.

23
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:04,801
I'm not asking.
I'm begging.

24
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:08,835
And I'm threatening! If there aren't
100 units delivered by tonight...

25
00:02:08,913 --> 00:02:12,747
the boys and I are gonna come down there
and alter the pants on all your dress uniforms.

26
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:15,012
You gotta reason with these guys.

27
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:17,316
Hello?

28
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:20,858
- Good job, Pierce. He hung up.
- Did he leave his inseam?

29
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:21,415
- Good job, Pierce. He hung up.
- Did he leave his inseam?

30
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:24,188
<i>[Man On P.A.] Attention, all personnel.</i>
<i>Incoming wounded.</i>

31
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:27,754
- <i>Triage team report to the evac bus.</i>
- That's not what I ordered.

32
00:02:27,832 --> 00:02:32,826
I.V. For him. He's in shock.
Get him right into pre-op.

33
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:36,067
- Just once I'd like to see a few empty seats.
- Or an empty bus.

34
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,541
- Take it easy, fella!
Come on. Take it easy.
- <i>Let me help you there, Doc.</i>

35
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,306
- I could use a wrestler, but you'll do fine.
- Nessen, take it easy.

36
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,907
It's me, Moody. Doc here
is gonna help you, okay?

37
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:50,683
- Where'd you come down from?
- Munsan. About 20 miles north.

38
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:54,521
- It was a town until last night.
- I'd hate to be the guy
who makes the maps here.

39
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,787
You know it.

40
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:59,421
Haven't you been a guest
in this hotel before?

41
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:01,829
Six months ago.

42
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:05,767
Yeah, I remember. You offered
to stuff me in my duffel bag.

43
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:09,102
[Chuckles] Jerris Moody.
How you been, Captain Pierce?

44
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:12,267
Okay. Litter!

45
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:14,675
Start a whole blood I.V.

46
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:19,015
- This one can wait.
- Great.

47
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,416
- Give me a hand with this one.
- I thought you'd be proudly
serving in the stockade by now.

48
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:24,478
First impressions can fool you.

49
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:26,921
Mine was you hated
everybody and everything.

50
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:29,926
Yeah, I guess I did, but lately
I haven't had time to do anything...

51
00:03:29,994 --> 00:03:32,155
except keep myself
and my buddies alive.

52
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,791
- You're a different guy, huh?
- Yeah, I'm a regular Florence Nightingale.

53
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:38,734
For Pete's sake, why are you just standing
around? Can't we get moving here?

54
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:41,169
Sure, Nurse. Would you help us
move this guy into pre-op?

55
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,935
- Nurse! You're talking to a major.
- Oh, sorry.

56
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:47,375
- Would you help us move this
guy into pre-op, Major?
- Litter!

57
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,845
<i>[Pierce] This kid's back is covered</i>
<i>with shrapnel. I feel like a prospector.</i>

58
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:54,043
- Pierce, do you always
have to talk while you work?
- You're right, Frank.

59
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:57,849
Nurse, from now on I'll blink my left eye
for a clamp, my right eye for a sponge...

60
00:03:57,922 --> 00:04:00,686
and when I wiggle my ears, that means
meet me under a jeep in half an hour.

61
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:02,988
Yuck, yuck, yuckety, yuck.

62
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:05,894
- Quiet, Frank. We're working.
- Quiet, all of you!

63
00:04:05,963 --> 00:04:08,761
I've got a bullet near the heart.
I don't need all this hubbub.

64
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,301
Shh!

65
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:18,141
<i>[B.J.]</i>
<i>Get him to post-op.</i>

66
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,009
600,000 units of Procaine
penicillin every six hours.

67
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:26,448
That's the easy part.
Now I gotta tell him I removed his leg.

68
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:29,486
Start it off with,
"Son, you're alive."

69
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:34,281
[B.J.]
Well, break's over.

70
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:39,491
<i>[Potter]</i>
<i>Orderly!</i>

71
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:42,727
Give me some more light there.
Tilt it up.

72
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,501
[Sighs] Clamp.
That's enough! That's enough!

73
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:56,803
Gloves.

74
00:05:04,122 --> 00:05:08,024
Nurse, there are pits
in my orange juice!

75
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:12,426
- Can we get a surgeon
to remove those pits?
- I'll do it. Nurse, strainer!

76
00:05:12,497 --> 00:05:14,692
I've had it with you crumbs.

77
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:18,701
Eighteen hours of slaving over these wrecks.
I got better things to do with my time.

78
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:22,830
- Shut up, Burns! Clamp.
- What's the matter, Pierce?
Cracking up, huh?

79
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:24,875
Sponge. I mean, clamp!

80
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:28,571
Frank, as soon as I patch up this kid's arm,
I'm gonna break one of yours.

81
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:32,582
- I got dibs on the other one.
- I'll pound all your bones into mulch.

82
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,481
I'll pound your mulch
into brains.

83
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:38,454
All right, we've let off enough steam.
Let's holster our mouths.

84
00:05:38,523 --> 00:05:41,424
Nurse, pull down my mask.

85
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:44,484
- Frank?
- Hmm?

86
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:48,627
Thank you.

87
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,724
Colonel, only ten units
of whole blood left.

88
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:53,326
[Sighs]
Thank God we're almost done.

89
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:55,338
You want me to call
Seoul again?

90
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:59,843
No, I'll take another shot at
that idiot colonel. It'll be the
capper of a perfect day. Hypo.

91
00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:04,508
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to our show.

92
00:06:04,582 --> 00:06:09,383
We have a two-bullet minimum
and no flashbulbs, please.

93
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:13,116
- Colonel, any word from Seoul yet?
- Yeah. The word is "wait."

94
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:15,591
You'd think those monkeys
could spare a little blood.

95
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,118
Speaking of monkeys not giving blood,
you haven't donated a drop, Frank.

96
00:06:19,197 --> 00:06:22,030
Strategy. One of us should
always have a full tank.

97
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:26,035
- Why didn't I think of that?
- 'Cause you're not an idiot.

98
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:33,234
It was the weirdest thing.
I was sitting in this foxhole.

99
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:36,872
It seemed like nothing was happening,
so I was reading...

100
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:41,544
one of those Communist leaflets, the ones
that say we're all fighting for Wall Street.

101
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:43,985
Personally, I refuse to read them.

102
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:46,615
And suddenly, I look...

103
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:49,524
and here's this Chinese
G.I. standing over me.

104
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:52,062
How could you let him
sneak up on you like that?

105
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,566
He was my age, no older.

106
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:59,933
We just stared at each other.

107
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,029
I guess he was surprised as I was.

108
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:05,269
Probably the first time
he'd seen an American close up.

109
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,334
- And then he shot you.
- No.

110
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:10,039
He got this scared look.

111
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:12,912
For a second, I thought
he was gonna run away.

112
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:15,953
- And then what happened?
- We both fired.

113
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:20,748
I got hit in the shoulder,
and it knocked me flat on my back.

114
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:23,350
What happened to him?

115
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:26,396
- The medic said I got him.
- Good for you.

116
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:28,398
I guess so.

117
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:31,993
Anything else
I can get for you?

118
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:35,630
I'd like to drop a line to Mom,
tell her I'm okay.

119
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,834
Of course.

120
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,571
- Dear Mother...
- No.

121
00:07:41,646 --> 00:07:45,582
- It's Mom. She hates
when you call her Mother.
- [Chuckles]

122
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,743
Dear Mom.

123
00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:54,015
- Hey, have you got a mirror?
- Settle for a compact?

124
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:57,891
- A what?
- Just don't ask,
"Who's the fairest of them all?"

125
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:03,966
Oh, damn!
Why they have to do that?

126
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:07,801
- I've had a moustache all my life!
- You were born with a moustache?

127
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:09,897
Well, since I was 12.

128
00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:12,238
They had to shave it
to stitch up your face.

129
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,904
They should have
left it alone, man.

130
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:18,244
What's the big deal? So you don't
look like Gilbert Roland for a while.

131
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:23,720
Oh, you don't understand, man. No
moustache, I might as well be wearing a dress.

132
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:28,384
- Watch it, bub.
- All the real men in
Puerto Rico have a moustache.

133
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:32,327
I think you look okay.
You got nice bushy eyebrows.

134
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:35,331
Oh, leave me alone, man.

135
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,765
And take your mirror with you.

136
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:40,429
I got nothing to look at.

137
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:42,972
Nice chatting with you.

138
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,274
We'll be able to ship you back to Tokyo.
You'll be more comfortable there.

139
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:52,612
Thanks. That'll be terrific.

140
00:08:52,683 --> 00:08:57,245
- You're gonna be all right.
- I thought I had it made.

141
00:08:57,321 --> 00:09:00,256
Stay in the rear,
clear out land mines.

142
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:03,589
<i>"It's great, Herb.</i>
<i>No one shoots at ya.</i>

No problems.

146
00:09:13,504 --> 00:09:17,065
- What happened?
- [Sighs]

147
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,145
We lay our mines out
in a pattern...

148
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:24,511
so we know how
to pick 'em up.

149
00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:29,918
But we booby-trap a few, so the enemy
won't sneak in and snip the wires.

150
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,319
I forgot about that.

151
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,522
Next thing I know...

152
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:39,859
I'm lying across the road.

153
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:44,161
My leg's kind of numb.

154
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:48,237
I say to myself, "Herb...

155
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:51,240
you got a problem."

156
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,874
Colonel Potter! Colonel!

157
00:09:56,947 --> 00:09:58,881
Why the ruckus, Major?

158
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:01,509
- Sir, this man's unconscious.
- I can see that.

159
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:05,180
- Well, he shouldn't be.
He's... He's my patient.
- That's a good enough reason.

160
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:08,623
- He's not wounded. I can't
find anything wrong with him.
- What are his signs?

161
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:13,061
- He's shocky, rapid pulse, low
pressure, diminished breathing.
- Strange.

162
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,065
- It's not my fault. I did my job.
- Nurse!

163
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:19,227
You're right.
The nurse is probably to blame.

164
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:22,932
- I'm not blaming anybody.
- I'm as conscientious as they come.

165
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:27,341
Put a cork on it, Burns. Able, has this
patient been unconscious since arrival?

166
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:29,606
Yes, Doctor.

167
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,946
- Beats the wampum out of me.
- I think he's sick.

168
00:10:34,018 --> 00:10:37,545
I never could sleep
on my stomach.

169
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:40,715
Me neither. I could sleep
on anyone else's but mine.

170
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:44,727
- How bad is it?
- Well, I wouldn't go
horseback riding for a while.

171
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:49,827
- This is very embarrassing.
- Why?

172
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,702
'Cause when I go home, people are
gonna be asking me where I got shot.

173
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:58,037
What am I gonna tell 'em?

174
00:10:58,108 --> 00:11:01,305
Just say, uh,
"I got shot in Korea."

175
00:11:01,378 --> 00:11:04,438
What if they ask me
where I got hit?

176
00:11:04,515 --> 00:11:07,609
Look them right in the eye and say
without blinking, "I got hit in the butt."

177
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:11,314
And if they keep bugging you,
drop your pants and show them your scar.

178
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:13,913
Don't make me laugh.

179
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:16,824
Whitney, we're talking about your body.
It's been invaded by a bullet.

180
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:21,388
- There's nothing amusing about that.
- Don't I know it.

181
00:11:21,465 --> 00:11:24,195
On the other hand, you should be proud.

182
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:28,705
You have a very special wound.
It's symbolic of this entire war.

183
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:32,208
This whole thing has been
one gigantic pain in the butt.

184
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:36,076
And when they hand you your Purple Heart,
you can tell them exactly where to pin it.

185
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:39,474
Thanks, Doc.

186
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,745
You're welcome.

187
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:47,192
Why am I always handed
the trouble patients?

188
00:11:47,262 --> 00:11:51,824
- Kellye. I wanna see his latest X rays.
- Yes, Colonel.

189
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,359
- We have an emergency.
- Ask someone else!
He's handling my patient first.

190
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:59,372
The Turkish captain needs a transfusion.
His blood refuses to clot.

191
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,465
- Let me see him.
- That's all right. You can go.

192
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:03,806
- Thank you.
- We don't have the blood to do the job.

193
00:12:03,878 --> 00:12:06,346
Tell me something I don't know.
He needs a refill, quick.

194
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:09,110
- Even if we get donors, it'll be too late.
- Get him to pre-op.

195
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:12,380
- We'll remove his spleen.
That may start some clotting.
- Right away.

196
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:15,684
- Hawkeye, get on the horn
to that colonel in Seoul.
- What'll I tell him?

197
00:12:15,757 --> 00:12:20,490
Tell him I need 100 pints of blood,
and I'm gonna come down there
and take it all from him.

198
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:28,534
Come on. What happened?
Confide in your trainer.

199
00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:32,272
I went into Rosie's Bar
last night.

200
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,106
There were some rear echelon guys in there
who wanted to know if I could tap dance.

201
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:38,805
Ah. Dale Carnegie graduates.

202
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,280
Yeah. Well, I showed 'em
a few steps, all right.

203
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:44,045
I did a buck-and-wing
on their chests.

204
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:46,279
I've always loved "the dance."

205
00:12:46,354 --> 00:12:50,814
Boy, those guys really surprised me with their
garbage. I went off like a firecracker.

206
00:12:50,892 --> 00:12:53,224
I can understand that.

207
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:56,821
Boy. When I was up in the front,
my boys needed me.

208
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:59,696
They always used to scream for
old Moody to come and get 'em.

209
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:02,668
I had the guts to go up there
and drag 'em back to the aid station.

210
00:13:02,737 --> 00:13:06,400
And you come back here,
and a couple of jerks call you names.

211
00:13:06,474 --> 00:13:09,568
When I was a kid, I was fighting all
the time when somebody put me down...

212
00:13:09,644 --> 00:13:11,976
'cause I believed 'em.

213
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:14,981
Those guys surprised me last night.

214
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:17,574
But they're not gonna
get me next time...

215
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:21,144
'cause I got something that
guys like that will never have...

216
00:13:21,222 --> 00:13:23,156
self-respect.

217
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:27,490
There's not one valid reason I can think of
why that soldier should be unconscious.

218
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:29,496
I gave him
the once-over twice.

219
00:13:29,564 --> 00:13:33,864
- If you couldn't find it...
- If I couldn't find it,
it means my brains are clogged.

220
00:13:33,935 --> 00:13:38,963
They discovered that boy in a sleeping bag,
dead to the world or almost anyway.

221
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,201
Doesn't make any sense at all.

222
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:44,267
- Unless he had company in there.
- Colonel, please.

223
00:13:44,345 --> 00:13:47,371
I don't mean human company.
Four-oh silk.

224
00:13:47,448 --> 00:13:51,282
I mean, maybe a snake. Those little poison
ropes are all over these hills.

225
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:54,617
- A good dose of venom
would turn anybody's lights dim.
- For heaven's sake.

226
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,089
- Kellye.
- Yes, Colonel?

227
00:13:57,158 --> 00:13:59,991
Did any of those boys come off
the meat wagon in their bare feet?

228
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:03,622
- A couple of them did, sir.
- Tell Pierce to check
that patient for snake bite.

229
00:14:03,698 --> 00:14:07,964
Especially the feet and ankles. If he finds
a bite, give him some antivenin, pronto.

230
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:11,334
- Brilliant, Colonel.
- If I'm so damn brilliant...

231
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:14,534
how is it I just put
a stitch in my glove?

232
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:18,476
So what if I recover? They'll send me
right out there to do it again.

233
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:21,947
[Frank] Those are the breaks, fella.
Lucky for me, I'm going home soon.

234
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:24,746
Back to Indiana,
the good life. [Chuckles]

235
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:28,084
- Lord knows I deserve it.
- Major, I don't wanna hear about home.

236
00:14:28,156 --> 00:14:30,386
I've been out here
almost since the beginning.

237
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,894
- I haven't seen my wife in all that time.
- That's tough.

238
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:38,523
She's changed too. I'm only getting cookies
a couple of times a month.

239
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:40,692
That's why I'm positive
she's been fooling around.

240
00:14:40,768 --> 00:14:42,759
Sort of a floozy, huh?

241
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:45,829
Watch it, pal.
You're talking about the woman I love.

242
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:48,273
I hired a private dick to follow her.
Trailed her everywhere...

243
00:14:48,342 --> 00:14:51,243
P.T.A. Meetings,
church functions.

244
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:53,803
And he came up with nothing.
[Chuckles]

245
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:55,815
Then I added it all up.

246
00:14:55,883 --> 00:14:58,443
He was one of
her caballeros too.

247
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,580
So I hired another cop to follow him.
And the second guy wanted expenses.

248
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:05,148
<i>They get paid</i>
<i>by the day, you know.</i>

249
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:07,251
Major, I'm very tired.

250
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:11,458
Ha! I'd have had enough money for ten
detectives if my disease had come through.

251
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:15,593
- What's that, Major?
- I didn't tell you about my disease, did I?

252
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,629
No, you didn't.
But never mind. It's okay.

253
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:23,473
A kid came through here with
an unidentified rash. I spotted it first.

254
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:28,481
I called it "Burn's Blight."
Catchiest name since diarrhea.

255
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:32,747
I was all set to make the lecture circuit
and pick up my big fat research grant.

256
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,152
- And, uh...
- Well, what happened?

257
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:38,852
He got well,
the ungrateful simp.

258
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:41,292
That's enough about me.
Now what about you, hmm?

259
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:43,887
Uh, you don't wanna
hear about it, Major.

260
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:46,991
Of course I do. We have orders
to be compassionate.

261
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:51,837
I don't wanna fight anymore.

262
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:54,534
I've seen enough death,
and I wanna go home.

263
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:56,804
Why don't you save that
for the chaplain, chicken?

264
00:15:56,878 --> 00:16:00,871
There's no law that says I have to sit
here and listen to you bleeding hearts.

265
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:06,075
It's very common, son.
You ran across a snake with a foot fetish.

266
00:16:06,153 --> 00:16:10,487
It's a good thing he wasn't a neck man, or
you might have died from a terminal hickey.

267
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:15,153
What do you say after work
we choose up sides for a football game?

268
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:17,754
- Nurses' shower's the end zone?
- Good. I'm playing end.

269
00:16:17,832 --> 00:16:23,464
Uh-uh. Last time you went out for a pass, I
didn't see you again till the fourth quarter.

270
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:27,338
Sergeant Raymond McGill, it's my duty to
inform you that you're doing beautifully.

271
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:30,104
- Spare me the good news, Doc.
- What's the matter with you?

272
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:32,975
They're gonna send me stateside
'cause of this stupid wound.

273
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:34,674
That's the way it usually works.

274
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:37,115
I can't go home.
I have a family to support.

275
00:16:37,184 --> 00:16:40,517
- You got a Korean family?
- No, no, in the States.

276
00:16:40,588 --> 00:16:42,783
Once more, with clarity.

277
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,693
Doc, I'm making a fortune
over here in Korea.

278
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:55,361
- You got the Band-Aid concession?
- I got some enterprises going.

279
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:57,597
Like selling booze, you know.

280
00:16:57,672 --> 00:17:00,197
A fifth costs me a buck
and a quarter in Tokyo.

281
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:03,766
Some friends fly it to me here,
and I let it go for 12 bucks a crack.

282
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:06,904
- Fifty up at the line.
- Right neighborly of ya.

283
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:11,145
That's nothing. I also have the only
Polaroid camera in this whole sector.

284
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:14,710
All the guys want shots, so I put 'em
on film for two bucks a piece.

285
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:17,280
Heaven help the economy
when you go.

286
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:19,724
Maybe I don't have to go, Doc.

287
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:22,558
Put a few good marks on that chart,
you'll be swimming in whiskey.

288
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,225
- I didn't bring my trunks.
- I'll let you borrow the camera.

289
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,929
You can take so many pictures of yourself,
your wife will think you're back home.

290
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:33,235
- Sorry, McGill.
- Come on, Doc. Please!

291
00:17:33,307 --> 00:17:36,276
How am I gonna make
any money in Jersey City?

292
00:17:36,344 --> 00:17:38,812
They say America
is the land of opportunity.

293
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:42,815
Sending me home, huh?
I heard you doctors had no hearts.

294
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:46,847
- Very chic, Klinger.
- I just threw it on.

295
00:17:51,158 --> 00:17:53,820
Hey, Robelo.

296
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:58,092
Stay away from me, man.
I look at you, and I get nightmares.

297
00:17:58,165 --> 00:18:01,293
- I solved your problem.
- What are you talking about?

298
00:18:01,369 --> 00:18:06,102
An unofficial, government-issued,
one each moustache.

299
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:08,437
That ain't funny.

300
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:10,841
Try it on.
I used my own hair.

301
00:18:10,911 --> 00:18:14,472
Hundred percent Lebanese.
It'll probably keep growing.

302
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,124
- How does it look?
- It's you.

303
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:33,433
Hey! Hey, that's not bad.

304
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:36,129
<i>Vaya,</i> man. It's even thicker
than my real one.

305
00:18:36,203 --> 00:18:38,137
<i>Gracias,</i> huh?

306
00:18:38,205 --> 00:18:41,572
Anytime. Give me a couple of weeks
and I can make you one with handlebars.

307
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:43,576
Hey, you're okay, man.

308
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:46,511
I know,
but don't spread it around.

309
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,054
- Nurse?
- Hmm?

310
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:57,613
You have any idea
how beautiful you are?

311
00:18:57,692 --> 00:19:01,219
[Chuckles] Have you any idea
how many times I've heard that line?

312
00:19:01,295 --> 00:19:04,059
- No, I'm not kidding.
On a scale of one to ten...
- I know.

313
00:19:04,131 --> 00:19:07,396
- I'm a nine.
- Would you like to try for ten?

314
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:10,869
- Over your dead body?
- I'm in better shape than I look.

315
00:19:10,938 --> 00:19:15,034
- Aren't we all?
- Listen.

316
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:18,306
- What time do you get off?
- What did you have in mind?

317
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:21,815
Well, I thought maybe when you get through
with your shift, we can do something.

318
00:19:21,882 --> 00:19:25,579
- Like go dancing?
- No, that's how I hurt my foot.

319
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:29,646
I thought maybe we can talk about
all the great times we had together...

320
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:31,783
We haven't had any.

321
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:35,454
Well, we can talk about them tomorrow night.
What are you doin' for dinner?

322
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:37,997
I'm meeting one of my nurses.

323
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:40,966
The guy in the next cot's in a coma.
Maybe we can double-date.

324
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:45,062
- That sounds exciting.
- Listen. You live alone?

325
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:48,438
I happen to have
a fiance in Tokyo.

326
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:52,969
So what? I happen to have
a wife in Philadelphia.

327
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:55,140
Donald is a lieutenant colonel.

328
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:57,548
Sharon's a C.P.A.

329
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:01,647
Don't you think we owe them
a little consideration?

330
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:03,986
You're right.
We're overdoing it.

331
00:20:04,058 --> 00:20:07,050
I happen to take my engagement
very seriously.

332
00:20:07,128 --> 00:20:09,562
Well, you should. What do you think
engagements are for?

333
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,157
It's a test period.
You're supposed to make comparisons.

334
00:20:13,234 --> 00:20:16,101
- I've done enough comparing.
- You have?

335
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,229
Tell me about 'em.

336
00:20:18,305 --> 00:20:22,469
The only conversation
I'm having with you is medical.

337
00:20:22,543 --> 00:20:27,344
Okay, fine. Pull the screen around my
bed and give me a complete physical.

338
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:30,542
- You guys are all alike.
- No, no, no. I'm really in love with you.

339
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:34,918
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you...
starting tonight. What do you say?

340
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:36,820
I say good-bye.

341
00:20:36,891 --> 00:20:38,882
[Sighs]

342
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:44,286
Nurse, do you happen to have
any idea how beautiful you are?

343
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,768
Do you have any idea how many
times I've heard that line?

344
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:52,537
Testing, testing.

345
00:20:52,606 --> 00:20:56,201
Sorry. Attention, everyone.
This is Colonel Potter.

346
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:59,838
I know it hasn't been 48 hours,
but I'm gonna ask you for more blood.

347
00:20:59,914 --> 00:21:02,940
We're as dry as a hump-less camel
in the sunshine.

348
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:05,577
Anyone giving a pint will be
excused from attending...

349
00:21:05,653 --> 00:21:08,178
my hygiene lectures
for the next month.

350
00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:10,223
Please report to the Mess Tent.

351
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,124
And don't knock anybody down
running to volunteer.

352
00:21:13,194 --> 00:21:15,185
Toodle-oo.

353
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:19,537
That'll last us for about 12 hours.

354
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:25,708
- [B.J.] Coming through.
Eager volunteer here.
- It's my blood! It has rights!

355
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:28,768
- We're doing it a favor.
We're taking it away from you.
- It'll only hurt a lot.

356
00:21:28,846 --> 00:21:30,473
- Next.
- No!

357
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:33,346
- When you sit in Santa's lap,
don't spit in his beard.
- I won't go!

358
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,648
- They give balloons.
- Aha. Major Burns at the front of the line.

359
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:39,189
- Good for you.
- Of course!

360
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:42,021
- These two bozos tried to butt in ahead of me.
- He's our leader.

361
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:45,529
- An inspiration to us all.
- Darn right.

362
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:58,771
- [Hawkeye] What's this?
- [B.J.] I think it's a truck.

363
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:04,446
I'm Sergeant Attias
of the Turkish brigade.

364
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:10,044
- We understand the 4077 th MASH
needs blood.
- In big red letters.

365
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:15,218
My men and I want to contribute
for saving the life of our captain.

366
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:18,729
Your table is ready.
Our special tonight is tomato juice.

367
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,856
[Shouts In Turkish]

368
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,065
Thank you very much.

369
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:34,441
It's our pleasure. It's a small thing to do
for such brave people.

370
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:39,472
- You're not touching me,
you vampire! Leave me alone!
- This won't hurt at all.

371
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,849
- What's wrong with him?
- He's one of our brave people.

372
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,320
Right now he wants
his mommy.

373
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:48,085
- Right this way.
- Uh, yes.

374
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,787
- Uh, after you.
- Oh, no, no, no. After you.

375
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:53,227
- No, by your pleasure.
- No, no, no, you have the blood.

376
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:56,391
- Thank you very much.
- [Both] Thank you very much.

377
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,437
How you feeling tonight, son?

378
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,439
A lot better than I was.

379
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,601
You're very lucky. All you got was
a concussion from that grenade.

380
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,907
Could have cracked your coconut.
Where's your home, son?

381
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,177
If I remember right,
I'm from Chicago.

382
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:16,584
Boy, do I know that town. I was a bachelor
stationed at Camp Grant for two years.

383
00:23:16,654 --> 00:23:21,216
- Used to hit Chicago like a tornado.
- I'm from the Near North Side.

384
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:24,090
Then you'll get a kick out of this.
The Dewdrop Inn.

385
00:23:25,563 --> 00:23:30,057
It's a tavern at the southeast corner
of Broadway and Lawrence.

386
00:23:30,134 --> 00:23:33,934
- There's a bank there.
- A bank? When did they put that up?

387
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:36,803
Around 1900, sir.

388
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,468
Well, I used to drink a lot
in those days.

389
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:43,411
Used to hop off the "I" at Diversey and
catch the White Sox at Comiskey Park.

390
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:47,611
Colonel, I think that's
the Cubs at Wrigley Field.

391
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:51,348
Baseball's a wonderful game
no matter who's playing.

392
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:53,117
Hmm, sure is.

393
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,682
My favorite tavern was The Shamrock
at the corner of State and Dearborn.

394
00:23:56,761 --> 00:23:58,592
- Sir?
- Yeah?

395
00:23:58,663 --> 00:24:01,757
- State and Dearborn never meet.
- They don't?

396
00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:05,700
No, sir. They run parallel
to each other.

397
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,068
- Listen. Ever been to Detroit?
- No, Colonel.

398
00:24:08,139 --> 00:24:11,302
Good. We'll talk about Detroit
tomorrow. Meanwhile, rest.

399
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,900
Remember,
you've had a concussion.
