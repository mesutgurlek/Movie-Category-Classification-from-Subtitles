DISTANT BIRDSONG

2
00:00:36,374 --> 00:00:38,054
Is that him?

3
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:41,974
Yes.

4
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:43,694
Oliver!

CHORAL MUSIC PLAYS

6
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:34,214
God be with you, Oliver.

7
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:36,734
And you too, John.
This is Henry Ireton, a good friend.

8
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:39,374
Good day to you, sir. Mr Ireton.

9
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:41,534
I've just been taking
a last look at my land.

10
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,814
We had heard you were leaving.

11
00:01:43,814 --> 00:01:45,374
We came from London directly.

12
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:48,014
You could have saved
yourself the effort, Mr Ireton.

13
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:50,054
If we could discuss it, I'm sure...

14
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:52,334
There is nothing to discuss, John.

15
00:01:52,334 --> 00:01:55,454
Well, come back to my house.
You've got a long journey back.

16
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:33,014
You must forgive the
manner of our table, Mr Pym.

17
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:35,654
Our best crockery is
packed for the voyage.

18
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:38,174
Bridget, fetch the bread.
Yes, Mother.

19
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:42,854
We had hoped to persuade your
husband to change his mind
about going to America, ma'am.

20
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:46,094
I should have thought you would know
Oliver better than that, Mr Pym.

21
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:48,014
It was not an easy decision, John.

22
00:03:48,014 --> 00:03:51,494
This is my country, my land.
God has been good to me here.

23
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:53,294
Then, sir, why are you leaving?

24
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:56,294
I have a family, Mr Ireton.

25
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:58,814
I owe it to my sons to
make a better life for them.

26
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:01,094
England is no longer a
country for a young man.

27
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:05,854
I recall you often spoke out strongly
in Parliament for the rights
and privileges of the common people.

28
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:10,934
Oh, that was a long
time ago, Mr Ireton.

29
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:12,734
I had a vision then.

30
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:14,294
A great nation.

31
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:19,454
Prosperous, God-fearing,
good laws, strong,

32
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:21,854
respected throughout the world.

33
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:24,614
That was the England I dreamed of.

34
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:28,694
Well, sir, you are a squire now,
a man of property.

35
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:31,694
Perhaps you no longer
care for the common people.

36
00:04:31,694 --> 00:04:34,334
Perhaps I've been misinformed, sir.

37
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:37,414
I thought, as a Puritan, you would
see it as your God-given duty to do

38
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:40,094
the Lord's work in this land,
regardless of sacrifice.

39
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:43,694
Mr Ireton,

40
00:04:43,694 --> 00:04:48,254
I was fighting for the liberty
of the common people when
you were in knee-britches.

41
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,294
Then why are you leaving?

42
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:58,094
I am leaving because this country
crawls with greed and corruption.

43
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:02,414
It is governed by adventurers and
profiteers who think more of their
pockets than their principles.

44
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:07,934
I am leaving, sir, because we
have a king who taxes the rich
beyond its means

45
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:12,094
and steals the land from the poor
to maintain his lavish court
and his Catholic wife.

46
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:17,734
And when Parliament objected
against these injustices,
he closed his Parliament down.

47
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,494
And our man dare not speak his
mind for fear of imprisonment.

48
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:23,054
Oh, yes.

49
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:27,134
All my life I believed it was God's
work to fight against such tyranny.

50
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:30,614
But God has turned his
back upon this nation,

51
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:32,774
and we are leaving it.

52
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,014
And what if Parliament should
be recalled, Mr Cromwell?

53
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:42,254
And why should a king do that?
He needs money, Oliver.

54
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:44,174
What? To build another palace?

55
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:45,854
No.

56
00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:47,414
To fight a war.

57
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:53,294
A war, John?

58
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:56,854
A war against whom?

59
00:05:56,854 --> 00:05:59,774
The Scots have assembled
an army on our border.

60
00:05:59,774 --> 00:06:02,054
They may invade us at any moment.

61
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:04,294
The King needs money
to raise an army.

62
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:06,134
Ah.

63
00:06:06,134 --> 00:06:10,094
By the King's own decree, Parliament
has not sat these past 12 years.

64
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:12,254
And now the King needs money.

65
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:17,414
Once Parliament is assembled, it
will lie within our power to change

66
00:06:17,414 --> 00:06:20,894
the whole structure of
government in this country.

67
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:23,614
John, how many times did we sit
in Parliament in the old days,

68
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:27,734
and how many resolutions did
we pass, and how many times
did this king overrule us?

69
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:31,334
Oh, the King can have his war with
Scotland. We will be in America.

70
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:34,574
There will be a war, Mr Cromwell,
but it will not be with Scotland.

71
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:36,574
Henry.

72
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:38,134
With whom, Mr Ireton?

73
00:06:38,134 --> 00:06:41,414
Henry, we have argued this matter
many times. I am convinced of it.

74
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:44,534
A war against whom, Mr Ireton?

75
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:45,974
Against the King, sir.

76
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:50,534
The King?

77
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:53,534
You mean a civil war?

78
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:54,974
In England?

79
00:06:57,494 --> 00:07:00,134
You know not the ways of
this nation, Mr Ireton.

80
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:01,774
Such things do not happen here.

81
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:04,574
And, in my opinion,
it is long overdue.

82
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,614
I will not have
such talk in my house.

83
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:09,494
It is common enough
talk these days, I fear.

84
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:11,854
Then it is treasonable talk!

85
00:07:11,854 --> 00:07:14,254
And I will not have it in my house!

86
00:07:14,254 --> 00:07:17,294
I mark the time when you
were much against the King,
and not afeared to say so.

87
00:07:17,294 --> 00:07:19,294
In truth, there is much in
this king that doth offend me.

88
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:23,894
Yet withal, I would not take up arms
against him, and I would oppose
any move to do so.

89
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:26,174
In such a cause, our swords
would be in God's hands.

90
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:30,094
That's an odd thing, Mr Ireton.
Every man who wages war
believes God is on his side.

91
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:33,574
I warrant God should often wonder
who is on his. Good evening, sir.

92
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:38,054
If I gave you offence,
I beg your pardon.

93
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:42,014
You're a young man, Mr Ireton.
It is fitting a young man
should want to change the world.

94
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:44,534
Not the world, sir. Only England.

95
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,534
With a civil war.

96
00:07:52,454 --> 00:07:54,854
Good evening, Mrs Cromwell.
Good evening, Mr Ireton.

97
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:57,614
I'll get your cloak, Mr Ireton.

98
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:59,774
I hope you'll forgive him.

99
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:01,294
Goodbye, John.

100
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:05,054
God be with you, Oliver.

101
00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:11,774
Come on, get these fences up.
Put your backs into it.

102
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,894
CATTLE LOWING
SHOUTING

103
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:24,694
You've no right to do this.

104
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:27,494
Leave them animals be.
This is the common land.

105
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:35,654
Any man who raises a hand against
the King's men will be arrested.

106
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:38,054
You have no right to do this.
This land is ours.

107
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:40,054
Now it belongs to the
Earl of Manchester.

108
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:42,814
By whose authority?
By the authority of the King.

109
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,374
Then I say the King is a thief!

110
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:47,174
You're under arrest.

111
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:49,574
Take him away! Bastards!

112
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:52,574
Release that man!
Who the devil are you?

113
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:56,174
This man works for me.
Whatever he has done, I will
take full responsibility.

114
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:59,854
He has spoken treason against
the King. Will you take
responsibility for that?

115
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,534
The rights to pasture
belong to the common people.

116
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:06,614
By what authority, Lord
Manchester, do you take that away?

117
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:10,574
By the authority of His Majesty's
commissioners granting me
and my friends

118
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:13,214
full rights to this land
for the purpose of improvement.

119
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:15,374
Such a contract cannot be legal.

120
00:09:15,374 --> 00:09:17,414
It is in violation of
the law of this land.

121
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:21,374
As a magistrate, you should know
the King is the law of this land.

122
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:23,294
On the contrary, my Lord Manchester,

123
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:26,534
it is the King's duty to maintain
the law. This is common land.

124
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:30,814
It belongs to the people. This is
my land and you are trespassing.

125
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:33,974
It's only out of respect for
your rank I don't have you
arrested for obstructing the law.

126
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,734
Captain Lundsford! My lord?

127
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:39,014
See that no unauthorized
person enters this area.

128
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:41,014
Yes, my lord. Remove these people!

129
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:53,654
BELL RINGS

130
00:10:00,494 --> 00:10:03,374
Good morrow to you, squire.
Good morrow, Mrs Cromwell.

131
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:08,414
Squire, have you news of my husband?

132
00:10:08,414 --> 00:10:12,374
It's in God's hands, Mrs Carter.
And in the King's. Aye.

133
00:10:16,214 --> 00:10:18,014
Let us pray.

134
00:10:18,014 --> 00:10:25,814
Almighty God,
look down upon this, thy house,
and we, thy humble servants.

135
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:32,654
Grant us the spirit of thy grace
through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

136
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:35,174
Who has done this?

137
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:37,094
Answer me.

138
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,014
Who has done this?

139
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:44,894
An edict, squire, from the archbishop
himself and by order of the King.

140
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,334
By order of the King?

141
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:51,334
Is the Church of England
not a Protestant church?

142
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:56,534
Would the King turn the house of God
into a Roman temple?

143
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:58,534
Mr Cromwell, I beseech you.

144
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:04,774
Does the King think that
God can be bought with gold,
trinkets and gilded rubbish?

145
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:07,094
I know only that I
have been instructed.

146
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:10,694
Has this king
forgotten the Reformation?

147
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:15,614
Mr Cromwell...
Away with this popish idolatry!

148
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:26,174
Did the Lord not say unto Moses,
"Thou shalt not make unto thyself
any graven image,

149
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:28,454
"Nor bow down to them."?

150
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,934
Has this king forgotten the
Spanish Inquisition?

151
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:36,014
Is the Roman Catholic Church
to have a seat in Westminster?

152
00:11:43,574 --> 00:11:45,494
SHE SCREAMS

153
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:51,734
Oh, my God.

154
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:56,174
My God. Oh, my God!

155
00:12:12,934 --> 00:12:16,214
God damn this king.

156
00:12:17,294 --> 00:12:19,694
CHURCH MUSIC PLAYS

157
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:47,174
King's guard, attention!

158
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:51,854
Here we are, my lord.

159
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,614
That'll do, damn it.
I'm not a damned cripple.

160
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:57,134
Me sticks, where are me sticks?
Come over here, boy.

161
00:12:57,134 --> 00:13:00,694
Here they are, my lord.
Give me the damned things.

162
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:04,694
And who the devil are you?
Edward Hyde. Ah.

163
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:07,214
Let's in to His Majesty.

164
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:10,214
Where is he?
He's at prayers, my lord. Aye.

165
00:13:10,214 --> 00:13:12,254
He might do well to pray, and all.

166
00:13:12,254 --> 00:13:16,574
We're gonna need some help.
First the Irish and now the Scots.

167
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:19,454
You daresn't turn your
back on either of them.

168
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:45,374
Let us give thanks to almighty God,
that he has seen fit to bless this
table with the fruits of his bounty.

169
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:47,734
In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ. Amen.

170
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:48,934
Amen.

171
00:14:04,654 --> 00:14:06,854
I did remark, madam,
with some distress,

172
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:11,294
that His Highness, Prince Charles,
was absent from prayers this morning.

173
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:15,494
He was with me, my lord.
He did pray with you? In your chapel?

174
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:18,974
Yes, my lord. I am most displeased.

175
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:23,414
It is not fitting that a future
king of England should make his
devotions in a Catholic chapel.

176
00:14:23,414 --> 00:14:25,574
Your private beliefs are respected.

177
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:30,134
But this is a Protestant country,
and as head of both church and state,

178
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:33,374
it is my God-given duty
to see that it so remains.

179
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:37,694
His Highness found the
whole business so boring,
my lord, that he fell asleep.

180
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:40,334
Didn't you, Charles? Yes, madam.

181
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:45,254
I believe you will find your
church as solid as ever, my lord.

182
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:49,694
Nevertheless, you will kindly
see that it does not happen again.

183
00:14:49,694 --> 00:14:51,214
Yes, my lord.

184
00:14:52,574 --> 00:14:55,814
Your Majesty? The Earl of
Strafford awaits your pleasure.

185
00:14:55,814 --> 00:14:59,534
My good Lord Strafford,
welcome back to England.

186
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,894
Thank you, my lord.

187
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:03,734
Your Majesty.

188
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:06,614
Your Royal Highness.

189
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,774
Most noble sovereign.

190
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,134
A chair for his lordship.

191
00:15:11,134 --> 00:15:14,294
Thank you, my lord.
I'm sorry to see you in pain.

192
00:15:14,294 --> 00:15:18,374
It is the agues
from the bogs of Ireland, my lord.

193
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:20,174
Godforsaken place.

194
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:23,054
Saving your presence,
my lord bishop.

195
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:27,094
We would not have summoned you, Lord
Strafford, had the situation here
not been of the greatest urgency.

196
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:30,494
You've doubtless heard
that the Scottish rebels
are marching on Newcastle.

197
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:34,574
Aye, my lord. You will whip
these barbarians to their senses.

198
00:15:34,574 --> 00:15:37,214
But what of Ireland, my lord?

199
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:39,974
We'll deal with Ireland in good time.

200
00:15:39,974 --> 00:15:42,134
You'll march an army on Scotland.

201
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:43,894
Army.

202
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:45,734
What army?

203
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:49,574
Most of your army lies rotting
beneath the bogs of Ireland.

204
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:53,014
And what's left of it is
hard-pressed to keep law and order.

205
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:57,614
Then we will raise a second army.

206
00:15:57,614 --> 00:16:01,574
I fear Your Majesty may find
that easier said than done.

207
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:05,654
What? I guarantee I could raise
3,000 men under arms inside a month!

208
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:08,054
But could you guarantee
their loyalty, my lord?

209
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:12,254
Is there an Englishman
living who wouldn't draw a
sword against his king's enemies?

210
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:16,814
There be many Englishmen, my Lord
Stafford, who would more readily
draw swords against the King.

211
00:16:16,814 --> 00:16:22,574
My God, who is this
jackanapes that mouths such
treason in your presence, my lord?

212
00:16:22,574 --> 00:16:27,734
You've been away a long time,
Strafford. Much here has changed.

213
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:29,894
Aye, I can see it has.

214
00:16:29,894 --> 00:16:33,014
I fear Sir Edward
but speaks the truth.

215
00:16:33,014 --> 00:16:37,654
To put an effective army in the
field against the Scots will
cost almost a million pounds.

216
00:16:37,654 --> 00:16:40,214
The Crown does not
have a million pounds.

217
00:16:41,774 --> 00:16:44,174
Are we just going to sit here, then,
and do nothing?

218
00:16:46,454 --> 00:16:51,614
Then I will summon Parliament and
instruct them to provide money.

219
00:16:51,614 --> 00:16:53,534
Parliament?!

220
00:16:54,694 --> 00:17:00,734
The King of England
go cap in hand to the
common people, like a...?

221
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:03,734
A beggar! Aye! A beggar.

222
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:11,894
I have no choice.
I say take the money.

223
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:16,454
You, my lord, are absolved
before God and before man
from any such action.

224
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:21,374
For in extreme necessity,
the King is acquitted
from all rule of government

225
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:25,334
and can do all
that his power permits.

226
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:29,294
Power? Where is the
power of a king without an army?

227
00:17:29,294 --> 00:17:31,934
I'll warrant you,
I'll raise an army.

228
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:36,214
We'll reduce this kingdom
to submission in one summer!

229
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:41,654
Do you mean, sir, that I should
declare war on my own people?

230
00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:43,454
Aye!

231
00:17:44,534 --> 00:17:46,814
Before they declare war on you.

232
00:18:18,254 --> 00:18:20,174
Well, sons,

233
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:22,574
there it is.

234
00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:24,734
Parliament House.

235
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:30,614
Upon that place rests all the
hopes of this nation for a
settlement of its ills in peace.

236
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:33,574
Do you think it could
come to war, Father?

237
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:38,414
Well, Oliver, when men run out of
words, they reach for their swords.

238
00:18:38,414 --> 00:18:41,614
Let's hope we can keep them talking.

239
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:46,934
The King demands money
to raise an army.

240
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:49,214
SHOUTING

241
00:18:49,214 --> 00:18:53,774
This House demands
redress for grievances.

242
00:18:55,814 --> 00:19:01,214
Grievances which the past 12 years
have laid heavy upon the nation.

243
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:03,494
I say that...
SHOUTING

244
00:19:03,494 --> 00:19:08,254
Might I be heard? I say
therefore this House is resolved.

245
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:09,974
Welcome back to Parliament.

246
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:12,014
No money for the King!

247
00:19:12,014 --> 00:19:14,414
SHOUTING

248
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:17,174
Order! Order!

249
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:22,934
Neither will we take up arms against
our Scottish brethren, unless...

250
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:25,414
unless...

251
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:30,694
this Parliament is allowed
to function as the true voice

252
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:33,254
of the people of England.

253
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:37,694
And not as a gathering
of lackeys to the King.

254
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:40,214
SHOUTING

255
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:02,174
Sir Edward Hyde, Your Majesty.

256
00:20:02,174 --> 00:20:07,214
Well, Sir Edward?
Your Majesty, I believe the House
will grant a loan to the Crown.

257
00:20:07,214 --> 00:20:11,054
But only on certain conditions.

258
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:15,134
Conditions?
What do you mean, conditions?

259
00:20:15,134 --> 00:20:18,134
What are these
conditions, Sir Edward?

260
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:22,454
In essence, sire,
that the Crown relinquishes
all authority over Parliament.

261
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:26,894
And who put forward

262
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:29,134
this proposal?

263
00:20:29,134 --> 00:20:33,494
John Pym, Henry Ireton,
John Hampden.

264
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:35,174
The Puritans.

265
00:20:35,174 --> 00:20:37,414
They were well supported, my lord.

266
00:20:37,414 --> 00:20:41,134
And they call themselves Englishmen?

267
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:44,854
My God, it's enough to make
a man deny his birthright.

268
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:47,774
Yet, withal, they
still be Englishmen.

269
00:20:47,774 --> 00:20:50,534
They make a mockery of the Crown!

270
00:20:50,534 --> 00:20:55,574
They abuse the privilege of free
speech with sedition and treason.

271
00:20:55,574 --> 00:21:00,614
You're too loud, Lord Strafford.
It is most unpleasant to the ear.

272
00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:08,294
So it has come to this, my lord,
that you now bargain for your crown.

273
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:10,934
What would you have me do?

274
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:13,814
Arrest every man who opposes me?

275
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:19,574
Hang them? Would you rather make
a gift of the Crown of England
to the rabble in the street?

276
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:25,454
It lies beyond my power to arrest
a citizen without proper charges.

277
00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:28,094
Charges are immaterial.

278
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:32,374
Such an act would subvert
the fundamental laws
of this land, madam.

279
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:37,054
Such an act might save the
Crown of England, my lord.

280
00:21:37,054 --> 00:21:43,174
I've governed this country justly
and fairly these 12 years without
reference to any Parliament.

281
00:21:44,974 --> 00:21:49,934
You may be assured, I do not intend
now to be schooled in my high office

282
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,054
by illiterate farm hands,
cobblers and...

283
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:57,494
..basket weavers.

284
00:21:57,494 --> 00:22:01,814
My Lord Strafford, you will
rid us of these troublemakers.

285
00:22:01,814 --> 00:22:04,454
Pym, Ireton, all of them.

286
00:22:04,454 --> 00:22:08,054
I'll arrest every one of
them, my lord. As you will.

287
00:22:08,054 --> 00:22:11,654
I shall need a warrant.
That is imperative.

288
00:22:11,654 --> 00:22:15,014
And what will the
charges be, my lord?

289
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:17,894
You're an experienced officer
of the Crown, Strafford,

290
00:22:17,894 --> 00:22:21,134
you do not need to
be instructed by me.

291
00:22:23,294 --> 00:22:25,694
SHOUTING
Mr Speaker.

292
00:22:27,854 --> 00:22:30,014
May I have permission
to address the House?

293
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:31,814
By all means, sir.

294
00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:36,254
Gentlemen. A matter has come
to my notice, which is
of deep concern to me,

295
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:41,014
and will, I am sure, be to
every single member of this House.

296
00:22:43,454 --> 00:22:48,494
The Earl of Strafford has, this day,
put his hand to a warrant
for the arrest and impeachment

297
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:55,214
of myself and four other
honourable members of this House
upon a charge of high treason.

298
00:22:55,214 --> 00:22:57,734
SHOUTING

299
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:02,134
Though Strafford's hand
be upon this warrant,

300
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:06,254
I see in this business, not the hand
of Strafford, but that of the King.

301
00:23:09,134 --> 00:23:10,414
My lords!

302
00:23:10,414 --> 00:23:16,294
I beseech you, do not
condemn this king too hastily.

303
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:20,174
For I am persuaded he has been
ill-advised upon this course.

304
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:25,094
Is not a king to be judged by those
from whom he seeketh counsel?
No, he is not!

305
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:30,974
It is not the function of this House
to sit in judgement upon this king.

306
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:35,174
The fault lies with those
very people from whom the
king has sought counsel.

307
00:23:35,174 --> 00:23:36,614
Is the...?

308
00:23:36,614 --> 00:23:38,974
I therefore move...

309
00:23:38,974 --> 00:23:44,854
that this House demands
the arrest and impeachment
of the Earl of Strafford

310
00:23:44,854 --> 00:23:48,254
upon a charge of high treason
against the people of this nation.

311
00:23:48,254 --> 00:23:50,174
SHOUTING

312
00:23:50,174 --> 00:23:51,734
Order!

313
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:54,854
Silence! Order!

314
00:23:54,854 --> 00:23:57,134
The motion has been proposed.

315
00:23:57,134 --> 00:24:00,014
Let it be put now to the question.

316
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:03,494
Is the motion agreed? NO!

317
00:24:03,494 --> 00:24:08,534
In favour of the motion?
AYE! AYE! AYE!

318
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:12,214
The ayes have it.
CHEERING

319
00:24:45,014 --> 00:24:48,254
I think my Lord Strafford's
condition...

320
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:52,094
will soon be far happier than mine.

321
00:25:05,294 --> 00:25:07,654
SHE PRAYS IN FRENCH

322
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:19,214
Do you see, madam?

323
00:25:19,214 --> 00:25:21,734
Do you see now what
you've made me do?

324
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:28,214
SHE CONTINUES PRAYING

325
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:52,574
Gentlemen, His Majesty.

326
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:58,574
Pray, be seated.

327
00:26:04,534 --> 00:26:08,014
Your coming is nothing if not timely.

328
00:26:08,014 --> 00:26:12,374
My Lord Strafford's head
has but barely fallen.

329
00:26:16,934 --> 00:26:19,094
Gentlemen, it is for you to speak.

330
00:26:20,654 --> 00:26:24,734
Your Majesty, you see here the
leaders of all parties of the House.

331
00:26:24,734 --> 00:26:28,574
And though we be divided on many
issues, we are of one accord -

332
00:26:28,574 --> 00:26:33,014
in that we place above all else,
our allegiance and loyalty

333
00:26:33,014 --> 00:26:35,534
to our most gracious sovereign.

334
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:40,334
For which reason we are deeply
anxious for a settlement of
the differences between us.

335
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:42,974
I share your sentiment, Sir Edward.

336
00:26:45,974 --> 00:26:48,374
The issue be this, my lord.

337
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:54,374
Parliament is persuaded that
without the right to govern this
nation by the will of the people

338
00:26:54,374 --> 00:26:57,614
and with God's guidance,

339
00:26:57,614 --> 00:26:59,774
we be not a Parliament at all.

340
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:04,934
And that unless some constitutional
reformation be brought about,

341
00:27:04,934 --> 00:27:08,294
we would as well go back
to our homes and our farms

342
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:13,214
as pursue this mockery
of a government one more day.

343
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:19,094
In short, Mr Pym, you're asking me
to relinquish my sovereign power
over Parliament.

344
00:27:19,094 --> 00:27:21,614
It does amount to that,
Your Majesty.

345
00:27:21,614 --> 00:27:27,134
I do swear that I hold
this England and its laws
dearer to my heart than any here.

346
00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:31,774
But, gentlemen, if you would reduce
me to a figurehead, a puppet king,

347
00:27:31,774 --> 00:27:35,534
manipulated by Parliament,
how then would I serve my country?

348
00:27:35,534 --> 00:27:37,574
What manner of king would I be?

349
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:45,134
I am persuaded, Your Majesty, that
England must move forward to a more
enlightened form of government

350
00:27:45,134 --> 00:27:49,694
based upon a true representation
of a free people.

351
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:53,654
Such an institution
is known as democracy, sir.

352
00:27:53,654 --> 00:27:56,654
Democracy, Mr...?

353
00:27:56,654 --> 00:27:58,654
Cromwell, sir.

354
00:27:58,654 --> 00:28:03,374
Democracy, Mr Cromwell,
was a Greek drollery

355
00:28:03,374 --> 00:28:09,614
based on the foolish notion that
there are extraordinary possibilities
in very ordinary people.

356
00:28:09,614 --> 00:28:15,374
It is ordinary people, my lord, who
would most readily lay down their
lives in defence of your realm.

357
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:23,654
It is simply that being ordinary,
they would prefer to be asked
and not told.

358
00:28:25,214 --> 00:28:29,534
You know, as I do, even as we sit
here, the Scots rebels
are invading this land

359
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:32,174
and not an English sword
is raised against them.

360
00:28:32,174 --> 00:28:39,134
I beg you, therefore, let us
bury our differences in defence
of both our church and kingdom.

361
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:45,494
The Scots invade our land,
and all is urgency and alarm.

362
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:49,054
Yet the past 12 months, our Irish
colonists have been slaughtered,

363
00:28:49,054 --> 00:28:53,494
our churches desecrated,
our clergy persecuted.

364
00:28:53,494 --> 00:28:58,094
The Crown has been
oddly reluctant to defend our church
and our kingdom over there, sir.

365
00:28:58,094 --> 00:29:04,454
By my guard, I would as soon
take up arms against Rome
than against the Scots.

366
00:29:04,454 --> 00:29:09,454
Would you have me declare war on the
entire Catholic world, Mr Cromwell?

367
00:29:09,454 --> 00:29:12,734
It is your duty to
defend our Church, sir.

368
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:17,414
We are speaking now of a matter
of international policy.

369
00:29:20,534 --> 00:29:26,854
Is Your Majesty sure that it's not
a matter of domestic expediency?

370
00:29:26,854 --> 00:29:30,374
Cromwell! I would remind you, sir,
that you are addressing your king.

371
00:29:30,374 --> 00:29:32,494
Mr Cromwell,

372
00:29:32,494 --> 00:29:35,294
you are impertinent.

373
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:39,614
Such issues are beyond
good manners, sir.

374
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:45,734
Catholicism is more than a religion,
it's a political power.

375
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:52,654
Therefore, I'm led to believe there
will be no peace in Ireland until
the Catholic Church is crushed.

376
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:56,894
Your Majesty.

377
00:29:59,854 --> 00:30:03,854
These gentlemen are
from the Parliament.

378
00:30:31,054 --> 00:30:36,854
Your Majesty, Parliament has
drawn up this document in which
are set out our main grievances.

379
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:40,094
It's our belief
that the demands made here

380
00:30:40,094 --> 00:30:46,294
are only those that are just and
lawful and in the best interests
of both crown and kingdom.

381
00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:50,534
I shall examine these proposals
most carefully, Mr Pym.

382
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:54,494
Gentlemen.

383
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,254
It's not too late, my lord.

384
00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:23,614
You have the power still.

385
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:27,494
And with God's help,
the strength to use that power.

386
00:31:32,414 --> 00:31:34,694
Oh, my dearest Charles.

387
00:31:34,694 --> 00:31:39,094
I married you as a king
and as a man.

388
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:43,934
I beseech you, do not
disappoint me in either aspect.

389
00:31:57,614 --> 00:32:04,334
This House has time and again
expressed its wholehearted loyalty
to the Crown.

390
00:32:04,334 --> 00:32:06,374
SHOUTING

391
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:09,494
Let Parliament
await in vain for a gesture...

392
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:13,094
The King is coming to arrest you,
John Hampden, Henry Ireton,

393
00:32:13,094 --> 00:32:17,534
Sir Arthur Haselrig and Oliver
Cromwell for high treason.
I suggest you leave.

394
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:23,654
..That if the issues that
divide the King from his country
be not soon resolved,

395
00:32:23,654 --> 00:32:26,894
then these issues
may soon divide the nation.

396
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:29,254
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

397
00:32:33,014 --> 00:32:39,014
The King is coming with
a warrant for our arrest. What?
We must leave at once.

398
00:32:40,894 --> 00:32:42,854
Oliver, your name is on it.

399
00:32:45,134 --> 00:32:46,654
Come!

400
00:32:54,614 --> 00:32:57,814
My lords! My lords!

401
00:32:57,814 --> 00:33:02,534
Gentlemen! The King comes.
He comes with 100 men at arms.

402
00:33:02,534 --> 00:33:05,774
The doors! The doors! Bolt the doors!

403
00:33:05,774 --> 00:33:07,814
SHOUTING

404
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:15,934
Stand aside, gentlemen,
if you please.

405
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:19,694
Halt! Open in the name of the King!

406
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:37,334
SHOUTING

407
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:16,934
Mr Speaker.

408
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:23,294
Gentlemen, you must pardon this
infringement of your privilege,
but I will not detain you long.

409
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:26,174
Mr Speaker, I must make
bold with your chair.

410
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:42,254
I have here a warrant for the arrest
of five members of this House -

411
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:48,854
John Pym, Henry Ireton,
John Hampden, Oliver Cromwell
and Sir Arthur Haselrig -

412
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:51,814
upon a charge of treason.

413
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:03,374
I see that the birds have flown.

414
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:06,454
Mr Speaker,

415
00:35:06,454 --> 00:35:08,414
where are these gentlemen?

416
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:14,654
May it please Your Majesty,
I've neither eyes to see

417
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:18,254
nor tongue to speak
except as this House gives me leave.

418
00:35:18,254 --> 00:35:22,454
Well, sir, I have eyes.
I see that one of them is here.

419
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,374
Captain.

420
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:25,934
Take him!

421
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:32,134
Any action against any member of
this House is a breach of privilege.

422
00:35:32,134 --> 00:35:36,694
I move this House
declares as public enemies
any who lay hands upon its members.

423
00:35:36,694 --> 00:35:38,774
SHOUTING

424
00:35:38,774 --> 00:35:41,414
And I further move...

425
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:48,134
I further move that any such action
against this House be considered
a crime against the people...

426
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:51,254
and treason against this nation.

427
00:35:51,254 --> 00:35:53,494
SHOUTING

428
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:03,134
So be it.

429
00:36:04,214 --> 00:36:11,174
Mr Speaker, you'll inform the members
of this House that their presence is
no longer required by the nation.

430
00:36:11,174 --> 00:36:15,734
This Parliament is,
by my authority, terminated.

431
00:36:15,734 --> 00:36:17,414
Dissolved.

432
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:27,254
Your Majesty!

433
00:36:29,374 --> 00:36:36,254
Are you aware that by your action in
this House you may have pushed this
nation to the brink of civil war?

434
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:06,494
Now do we see
in what contempt this king
holds this House and this nation?

435
00:37:09,134 --> 00:37:13,334
It be either your king
or your Parliament.

436
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:19,454
Honourable members,
the decision is yours.

437
00:37:21,014 --> 00:37:26,294
But I beseech you, in the name
of God, think well on it.

438
00:37:52,094 --> 00:37:53,534
Fairfax.

439
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:16,054
Gentlemen, I move that this House
demand the control of the militia,

440
00:38:16,054 --> 00:38:20,414
and that this country be put
in an immediate posture of defence.

441
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:22,934
Mr Speaker...

442
00:38:25,934 --> 00:38:28,094
My lords,

443
00:38:28,094 --> 00:38:30,734
honourable members,

444
00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:33,494
this nation is now in
a state of civil war.

445
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:40,774
And let us pray that God
in his mercy will give us strength

446
00:38:40,774 --> 00:38:44,294
in this terrible
and most unhappy hour.

447
00:39:15,974 --> 00:39:18,374
CHEERING

448
00:39:25,414 --> 00:39:28,334
Morning, William. Give you
good day, squire. Why the coffin?

449
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:32,374
If it be God's will that I die,
I'd have a decent Christian burial.

450
00:39:32,374 --> 00:39:36,014
Let's hope it doesn't come to that,
William. I need you at the farm.

451
00:39:41,774 --> 00:39:43,694
Hello, Father. Father. Morning.

452
00:39:43,694 --> 00:39:46,214
Where's your sword, Richard?
I have no sword, father.

453
00:39:46,214 --> 00:39:49,454
You must get one and wear it.
It's a mark of your rank, captain.

454
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:51,614
Yes. God bless thee!

455
00:39:51,614 --> 00:39:54,614
Hallelujah! Hallelujah, brethren!

456
00:39:54,614 --> 00:39:58,214
It is the Lord's work
we do this day!

457
00:39:58,214 --> 00:40:02,254
The Lord's work!
This is no place for you, Hugh,
though you be welcome.

458
00:40:02,254 --> 00:40:05,774
I've consulted God on this matter,
Mr Cromwell.

459
00:40:05,774 --> 00:40:09,254
I asked him,
"Lord, whose side are you on?"

460
00:40:09,254 --> 00:40:14,294
And he answered me, saying,
"On the side of truth and justice."

461
00:40:14,294 --> 00:40:16,574
So here I am.

462

Greetings, Uncle.

00:41:20,534 --> 00:41:24,254
'Tis a fair day for a fight.
Where be the enemy?

474
00:41:24,254 --> 00:41:29,174
My lords, I present my nephew,
His Highness, Prince Rupert,
Count Palatine of the Rhine.

475
00:41:29,174 --> 00:41:31,414
My lords, I give you greetings.
Your Highness.

476
00:41:31,414 --> 00:41:34,574
And good Cousin Charles,
most noble Prince of Wales.

477
00:41:34,574 --> 00:41:37,574
How fare you, young sir?
I am well, thank you, cousin.

478
00:41:37,574 --> 00:41:40,534
So, let us to action.

479
00:41:40,534 --> 00:41:46,774
For I do swear by this sword
within a week we'll have severed
every Roundhead from its shoulders!

480
00:41:46,774 --> 00:41:49,334
Well, said, Your Highness.
Let the standard be raised.

Halt!

488
00:43:29,134 --> 00:43:32,414
Where the devil are we?
Edgehill, my lord, over there.

489
00:43:35,534 --> 00:43:38,174
Morning, Robert. Morning, Edward.

490
00:43:38,174 --> 00:43:41,774
Damn me, they've got
a lot of fellows over there.
Where's Cromwell?

491
00:43:41,774 --> 00:43:44,174
Approaching now, my lord.

492
00:43:56,054 --> 00:43:57,974
Morning, Cromwell. Morning, my lord.

493
00:43:57,974 --> 00:44:01,214
Your men fit, colonel?
My men are ready, my lord.

494
00:44:01,214 --> 00:44:04,214
You seem damned eager to get into
this business, Cromwell?

495
00:44:04,214 --> 00:44:09,134
We all enter this reluctantly,
but the die is cast.
Is that not so, Lord Essex?

496
00:44:09,134 --> 00:44:11,534
You are right.

497
00:44:11,534 --> 00:44:14,894
Well, to your position. Let no
man move except upon my signal.

498
00:44:14,894 --> 00:44:18,934
And may God look kindly
upon us this day. Amen to that.

499
00:44:18,934 --> 00:44:22,694
Missed my breakfast.
Damned tricky things, stomachs.

500
00:44:29,774 --> 00:44:32,294
God be with you, men.
God bless you. Thank you, sir.

501
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:36,974
God be with you.
Take care of yourself, William.
The Lord'll take care of me.

502
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,254
Have faith, John. I have, squire.

503
00:44:39,254 --> 00:44:42,014
Come on, lads, have your muskets
at the ready. Come on, now.

504
00:44:44,054 --> 00:44:47,734
Father.
May God take care of you, Richard.

505
00:44:47,734 --> 00:44:49,814
And be with you, Oliver.

506
00:44:49,814 --> 00:44:52,094
And with you too, Father.

507
00:44:55,534 --> 00:45:00,094
O Lord, defend our cause
against the face of the enemy.

508
00:45:00,094 --> 00:45:03,574
Save us from the violence
of the enemy.

509
00:45:03,574 --> 00:45:08,174
O Lord of hope, fight for us
that we may glorify thee.

510
00:45:08,174 --> 00:45:11,014
O Lord, God of mercy,

511
00:45:11,014 --> 00:45:14,534
put thy strength in
our hands this day.

512
00:45:14,534 --> 00:45:18,734
Give not the battle to the
strong, but to the righteous.

513
00:45:18,734 --> 00:45:23,894
And be thou, O merciful God,
our saviour and mighty deliverer...

514
00:45:23,894 --> 00:45:26,894
Defend me from them
that rise up against me.

515
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:29,894
In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

516
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,814
AMEN!

517
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:33,854
Amen. Amen.

518
00:45:33,854 --> 00:45:36,454
Father, look. It's Lord Essex.

519
00:45:48,614 --> 00:45:50,654
Come, cousin.

520
00:45:50,654 --> 00:45:54,254
Let's take a good look
at these Roundheads.

521
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:56,054
Your Majesty?

522
00:46:07,574 --> 00:46:12,494
God's teeth, have we not
parleyed enough these past months?

523
00:46:12,494 --> 00:46:16,214
Well, Essex, are you prepared?
We are. Shall we begin at ten?

524
00:46:16,214 --> 00:46:18,854
Make it nine, my lord.
I'm positively starving.

525
00:46:18,854 --> 00:46:22,694
Then in God's name, let's to it.
It's agreed then - 9 o'clock.

526
00:46:22,694 --> 00:46:26,054
And by my faith, which I have not,
I swear that within the hour,

527
00:46:26,054 --> 00:46:28,534
this field will be strewn
with English dead.

528
00:46:28,534 --> 00:46:32,734
If this be so, they will have
been killed BY Englishmen,

529
00:46:32,734 --> 00:46:36,854
for we have not seen fit to import
foreign mercenaries into OUR ranks.

530
00:46:39,494 --> 00:46:44,414
I will mark you well for that
insult, sir. Be on your guard!

531
00:46:51,854 --> 00:46:56,174
Colours to the rear!
Colours to the rear!

532
00:47:01,094 --> 00:47:03,014
The Lord is our strength.

533
00:47:04,094 --> 00:47:06,254
Praise the Lord!

534
00:47:18,614 --> 00:47:22,094
What in the name of God
are we waiting for?

535
00:47:22,094 --> 00:47:24,854
Ireton!

536
00:47:24,854 --> 00:47:27,374
I thought we came here to do battle.

537
00:47:27,374 --> 00:47:29,654
We're waiting for the appointed time.

538
00:47:29,654 --> 00:47:31,694
The appointed time?

539
00:47:39,854 --> 00:47:42,494

Fire!

544
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:11,174
O Lord, thou knowest how busy
I must be this day.

545
00:48:12,254 --> 00:48:16,654
If I forget thee,
do not thou forget me.

546
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,494
Fire!

547
00:48:29,654 --> 00:48:31,654
Fire!

548
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:39,494
You'd better send Fairfax in.

549
00:48:40,574 --> 00:48:42,854
Bugler, sound the charge.

My lord! Why in the name of
Christ did you sound the retreat?

577
00:52:06,614 --> 00:52:09,494
You've countermanded
my orders once today.

578
00:52:09,494 --> 00:52:11,294
You'll do as you're told, sir!

579
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:30,494
Hold your ground, in the name of God!

580
00:52:30,494 --> 00:52:32,534
Hold your ground!

581
00:53:00,734 --> 00:53:05,174
Well, Uncle, did you ever see a
quarry so swiftly put to flight?

582
00:53:05,174 --> 00:53:11,894
The King will for ever keep this
field and this day's service
in grateful remembrance.

HORSES WHINNY

Come nightfall, we
shall bury our dead.

586
00:53:52,094 --> 00:53:55,214
And then, by God,
we shall bury this army.

587
00:53:55,214 --> 00:53:59,414
With such pitiful men in
our ranks, it were better
this war were never fought.

588
00:53:59,414 --> 00:54:01,774
Not a drop of English blood
soil this land.

589
00:54:01,774 --> 00:54:04,934
It's a bad officer who
blames his men, Cromwell.

590
00:54:04,934 --> 00:54:08,414
I blame them not, my lord,
for they are simple men.

591
00:54:08,414 --> 00:54:11,534
But what match are farmers'
boys against gentlemen's sons?

592
00:54:11,534 --> 00:54:13,814
The battle is not yet lost, Cromwell.

593
00:54:13,814 --> 00:54:16,574
This battle were lost
before it ever began, my lord.

594
00:54:16,574 --> 00:54:18,974
And in like manner,
so will this war.

595
00:54:18,974 --> 00:54:21,254
In the morning,
I'm returning to Cambridge.

596
00:54:21,254 --> 00:54:24,254
lf you desert the field,
I'll have you arrested.

597
00:54:24,254 --> 00:54:30,374
This war will not be won with
untrained ploughmen, apprentices,
old, decaying serving men!

598
00:54:30,374 --> 00:54:35,174
We need men
with fire in their bowels who
fear the Lord, but not the enemy!

599
00:54:35,174 --> 00:54:38,894
As God is my witness, I am resolved
that this battle will be won.

600
00:54:38,894 --> 00:54:41,894
Therefore, it is my intention
to return to Cambridge

601
00:54:41,894 --> 00:54:46,454
and raise an army of handpicked men,
the like of which
this nation has never seen!

602
00:54:46,454 --> 00:54:50,854
With or without your permission,
my Lord Manchester.

603
00:56:09,734 --> 00:56:14,494
# Rejoice in the Lord

604
00:56:15,734 --> 00:56:20,894
# Rejoice in the Lord.

605
00:56:26,974 --> 00:56:30,854
# He girdeth me with strength

606
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:35,294
# And teacheth my hands to fight

607
00:57:09,854 --> 00:57:12,334
Bristol will not be
permitted to fall.

608
00:57:12,334 --> 00:57:16,454
It is our only seaport in the
west, and if General Goring is
incapable of holding it,

609
00:57:16,454 --> 00:57:18,134
I will dispatch someone who can.

610
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:21,254
I've a mind to see Bristol, my lord.
'Tis a fair city, I hear.

611
00:57:21,254 --> 00:57:23,894
Then I shall place Bristol
in your command, nephew.

612
00:57:23,894 --> 00:57:25,934
Now, my lord general...
Your Majesty.

613
00:57:25,934 --> 00:57:28,814
Yes, what is it? News of
Cromwell's army, Your Majesty.

614
00:57:28,814 --> 00:57:33,334
Come forward. At last, Old Ironsides
ventures forth. Well, speak, man.

615
00:57:33,334 --> 00:57:37,054
They're about six miles away,
Your Majesty. Just south of Naseby.

616
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:40,534
By my reckoning, there'd be about
1,000 horse and 2,000 afoot.

617
00:57:40,534 --> 00:57:42,734
And what news of Manchester's army?

618
00:57:42,734 --> 00:57:45,614
I saw no other army, Your Majesty.

619
00:57:45,614 --> 00:57:48,694
Was not Cromwell to join with
Manchester's forces at Naseby?

620
00:57:48,694 --> 00:57:50,774
That was our
intelligence, Your Majesty.

621
00:57:50,774 --> 00:57:54,134
Then Manchester be still in Lincoln.

622
00:57:54,134 --> 00:57:59,054
So Cromwell comes with his army of
3,000 to our 7,000!

623
00:57:59,054 --> 00:58:02,654
By your leave, Uncle. Your Highness!
General Astley, sound the alert!

624
00:58:02,654 --> 00:58:05,054
I want every man in
full battle order at once. Sir!

625
00:58:05,054 --> 00:58:08,894
By God, we have him!

626
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:21,014
Manchester!

627
00:58:21,014 --> 00:58:23,734
Where in the name of Christ is he?

628
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:26,654
Know you not we are at war?!

629
00:58:28,294 --> 00:58:33,454
In God's name I do swear we fight
this war single-handed. Oliver!

630
00:58:48,374 --> 00:58:50,174
What treachery is this?

631
00:58:50,174 --> 00:58:54,614
We came to meet Manchester and
instead we find the King's army!

632
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,294
Well, I shall take on the King.

633
00:58:56,294 --> 00:58:59,894
And after that if needs must,
I'll take on Manchester as well!

634
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:24,494
Before you stands the enemy,
his three to every one of us.

635
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:27,254
And where, in God's name,
is Manchester?

636
00:59:27,254 --> 00:59:31,454
My Lord Manchester will rue the
day he has not joined us here.

637
00:59:31,454 --> 00:59:33,014
And now to your positions.

638
00:59:33,014 --> 00:59:36,574
These tactics we have practised
often enough these past six months.

639
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:38,414
Now let us put them to the test.

640
00:59:38,414 --> 00:59:43,214
For upon this field of Naseby, we'll
turn the tide of this unhappy war.

641
00:59:44,534 --> 00:59:46,334
God be with you all.

642
00:59:54,374 --> 00:59:56,894
Is this wise, Oliver?
We're heavily outnumbered.

643
00:59:58,574 --> 01:00:01,094
Was not Gideon
outnumbered by the Amalekites?

644
01:00:01,094 --> 01:00:05,494
It is not numbers that count,
but speed and surprise.

645
01:00:06,494 --> 01:00:10,814
Let no man move, except upon
the word of his commander!

646
01:00:11,894 --> 01:00:17,774
Though we be outnumbered, we shall
win this battle, I promise you!

647
01:00:19,094 --> 01:00:24,574
So now put your faith in God
and keep your powder dry.

648
01:00:24,574 --> 01:00:26,534
CHEERING

649
01:01:08,054 --> 01:01:09,574
Halt!

650
01:01:43,894 --> 01:01:45,374
Attack order.

651
01:01:45,374 --> 01:01:48,494
Double line abreast. Forward.

652
01:01:48,494 --> 01:01:50,054
Forward!

653
01:02:07,574 --> 01:02:09,974
The man must be mad.

654
01:02:09,974 --> 01:02:11,774
Prepare to attack.

655
01:02:11,774 --> 01:02:13,694
Prepare to attack!

656
01:02:19,334 --> 01:02:21,734
Our swords are in God's hand.

657
01:02:21,734 --> 01:02:24,854
And our faith is in the Lord.

658
01:02:24,854 --> 01:02:26,534
Charge!

659
01:02:29,614 --> 01:02:30,614
Fire!

660
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:38,894
Forward!

661
01:02:38,894 --> 01:02:40,814
CHEERING

662
01:03:06,494 --> 01:03:07,694
Cromwell!

663
01:03:15,614 --> 01:03:18,694
Regroup! Regroup!

664
01:03:21,334 --> 01:03:22,934
After them!

665
01:03:22,934 --> 01:03:24,814
SHOUTING AND CHEERING

666
01:03:40,334 --> 01:03:41,614
Fire!

667
01:03:45,974 --> 01:03:47,054
Advance!

668
01:03:47,054 --> 01:03:49,894
BUGLE SOUNDS

669
01:03:55,334 --> 01:03:56,534
To the rear!

670
01:03:56,534 --> 01:03:59,294
BUGLE SOUNDS

671
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:10,214
Forward!

672
01:04:20,654 --> 01:04:22,454
Come on, lads!

673
01:04:22,454 --> 01:04:24,014
At the gallop!

674
01:04:24,014 --> 01:04:25,694
CHEERING

675
01:04:50,734 --> 01:04:54,734
Your Majesty,
may I suggest that we withdraw? No.

676
01:06:02,854 --> 01:06:04,574
Who goes there?

677
01:06:06,134 --> 01:06:08,774
Captain Cromwell, 3rd Cavalry.

678
01:06:08,774 --> 01:06:11,294
Richard.

679
01:06:11,294 --> 01:06:14,534
Thanks be to God. Where is Oliver?

680
01:07:18,614 --> 01:07:24,494
The outrageous incompetence
and inefficiency of the High Command

681
01:07:24,494 --> 01:07:29,654
have tried my patience and that of
my hard-pressed army long enough.

682
01:07:29,654 --> 01:07:35,174
By my faith, I swear it would be
better that those gallant generals

683
01:07:35,174 --> 01:07:38,774
Essex and Manchester took up
swords with the King.

684
01:07:38,774 --> 01:07:43,454
For then might we be assured
of victory. Hear, hear!

685
01:07:43,454 --> 01:07:48,614
For by their reluctance to pursue
this war with the intensity
it demands,

686
01:07:48,614 --> 01:07:53,054
they have proved themselves
treacherous both to our cause
and to this nation.

687
01:07:53,054 --> 01:07:56,174
Hear, hear!

688
01:07:56,174 --> 01:08:02,174
If we beat the King 99 times,
he will still be our King
and we his subjects.

689
01:08:03,254 --> 01:08:08,294
If he beats us but once,
we shall all be hanged. Hear, hear.

690
01:08:08,294 --> 01:08:12,134
If that is so, then why
in the bowels of Christ

691
01:08:12,134 --> 01:08:15,614
did we take up arms against him
in the first place?

692
01:08:21,254 --> 01:08:22,694
Gentlemen...

693
01:08:26,054 --> 01:08:30,254
..honest men have served
us faithfully.

694
01:08:30,254 --> 01:08:32,854
And many have died,

695
01:08:32,854 --> 01:08:37,214
that this House may sit in freedom
and this nation live in liberty.

696
01:08:38,774 --> 01:08:40,694
In the name of God,

697
01:08:40,694 --> 01:08:42,854
I beseech you,

698
01:08:42,854 --> 01:08:46,694
do not desert them now. Aye.

699
01:08:52,174 --> 01:08:55,934
Unless Parliament
supports this war to the full,

700
01:08:55,934 --> 01:08:59,654
I am bound to say, in all
conscience, that I will lay down
my sword

701
01:08:59,654 --> 01:09:06,334
and let this House
make its peace with the King -
be that peace ever so base.

702
01:09:06,334 --> 01:09:08,894
SHOUTING

703
01:09:12,814 --> 01:09:15,974
Then, it is for
this House to decide.

704
01:09:17,534 --> 01:09:22,334
I move that this House demands the
immediate resignation of the
High Command,

705
01:09:22,334 --> 01:09:27,494
upon the grounds that they be no
longer competent to command
the armed forces of this Parliament.

706
01:09:27,494 --> 01:09:30,014
SHOUTING

707
01:09:32,774 --> 01:09:35,494
Order. Order. The motion has been
proposed.

708
01:09:35,494 --> 01:09:37,454
Let it now be put to the question.

709
01:09:37,454 --> 01:09:40,094
Those against Colonel Cromwell's
motion. No!

710
01:09:40,094 --> 01:09:41,894
Those in favour of the motion.

711
01:09:41,894 --> 01:09:43,454
AYE!!

712
01:09:43,454 --> 01:09:45,854
The ayes have it.
The motion be carried.

713
01:09:45,854 --> 01:09:48,494
CHEERING

714
01:09:48,494 --> 01:09:51,134
I move...

715
01:09:51,134 --> 01:09:56,534
I move that Colonel Cromwell be
appointed Commander in
Chief of the army.

716
01:09:56,894 --> 01:09:59,174
CHEERING

717
01:10:21,974 --> 01:10:25,934
Bristol. We must dispatch
aid to Bristol with
all possible speed,

718
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:29,894
for as long as Rupert
holds Bristol, this war be not lost.

719
01:10:29,894 --> 01:10:35,294
General Digby, if you can detach
your forces in this area and
approach Bristol from the east...

720
01:10:35,294 --> 01:10:39,094
To do that, my lord, would be to
expose this city to immediate attack.

721
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:45,214
Then we move the Marquis
of Huntly's army south...

722
01:10:45,214 --> 01:10:49,934
The Marquis, my lord, surrendered
to Cromwell's forces yesterday.

723
01:10:49,934 --> 01:10:54,494
Cromwell. I hear nothing but
Cromwell, Cromwell.

724
01:10:54,494 --> 01:10:58,654
My lord, it is but a game
we play here, a game with
wooden armies and paper flags!

725
01:11:01,574 --> 01:11:04,054
'Tis but a block of wood
you hold in your hand.

726
01:11:04,054 --> 01:11:06,814
My lords, all I
ask for is a little time.

727
01:11:06,814 --> 01:11:09,254
Time, my lord, costs us heavily.

728
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:19,294
If we can hold on here in Oxford for
six weeks, the Scots have
promised an army of 20,000 men.

729
01:11:19,294 --> 01:11:24,374
Her Majesty is in communication
with my cousin, the King of France.

730
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:29,534
And I have good reason to hope
for support from Ireland.

731
01:11:29,534 --> 01:11:32,294
An army from Ireland, Your Majesty?

732
01:11:32,294 --> 01:11:37,814
Faith, I would as soon join forces
with Cromwell himself,
as take up arms with the Catholics!

733
01:11:37,814 --> 01:11:40,694
I am the King
and defender of my people,

734
01:11:40,694 --> 01:11:44,294
and I maintain the right to seek
relief from no matter what quarter.

735
01:11:44,294 --> 01:11:47,894
As King, my lord, it is your
God-given duty to defend
the faith of this nation.

736
01:11:47,894 --> 01:11:49,814
I do what I think to be right, sir.

737
01:11:49,814 --> 01:11:52,694
Catholics as allies!
It is unthinkable!

738
01:11:52,694 --> 01:11:58,694
My God, if it has come to this, let
us rather sue for an honourable peace
than fight a dishonourable war.

739
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:02,294
I will not countenance defeat.

740
01:12:04,414 --> 01:12:09,974
Rather than abandon my kingdom
to Parliament, I would come to
terms with the devil himself.

741
01:12:12,854 --> 01:12:15,734
Since you came to the
throne, Your Majesty,

742
01:12:15,734 --> 01:12:20,174
your armies have persistently
persecuted our Church in Ireland.

743
01:12:21,734 --> 01:12:25,534
And yet, now that your need is great,
you turn to us for help.

744
01:12:26,534 --> 01:12:33,374
The King's actions in Ireland, Your
Excellency, will seem as nothing
should these Puritans come to power.

745
01:12:33,374 --> 01:12:37,414
It is not only the Crown of England
that is in peril, Excellency -

746
01:12:37,414 --> 01:12:42,254
all institutions of established
order throughout the
countries of Europe are threatened.

747
01:12:42,254 --> 01:12:45,974
An Irish army of 20,000 men,

748
01:12:45,974 --> 01:12:53,014
even 15,000, would forestall such a
threat, and bring this wretched
war to a speedy end.

749
01:12:54,854 --> 01:13:00,614
I am instructed to say that His
Holiness would permit an Irish force

750
01:13:00,614 --> 01:13:03,854
to take up arms in this country.

751
01:13:03,854 --> 01:13:06,014
But there are certain conditions.

752
01:13:07,094 --> 01:13:11,654
First, the Catholic Church in
Ireland must be completely restored,

753
01:13:11,654 --> 01:13:17,054
and permitted to practise freely
without interference or oppression.

754
01:13:17,054 --> 01:13:21,614
Secondly, all Protestant
churches in Ireland must be closed,

755
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:26,894
and all Protestant bishops
and ministers removed from office.

756
01:13:26,894 --> 01:13:32,014
Oh, there are one or two other minor
conditions of little consequence.

757
01:13:32,014 --> 01:13:39,334
What you demand, Excellency,
would be a betrayal of my coronation
oath as head of the English Church.

758
01:13:39,334 --> 01:13:41,854
You have a duty,
Charles, to the Crown.

759
01:13:41,854 --> 01:13:45,454
For without that, you
will be head of nothing!

760
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:49,174
May I tell His Holiness that
you will agree to these conditions?

761
01:13:57,854 --> 01:13:59,894
You have something
to say, Sir Edward?

762
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:03,854
Your Majesty,
His Highness Prince Rupert attends
in the council chamber.

763
01:14:03,854 --> 01:14:08,174
Rupert? Here in Oxford?
Yes, my lord.

764
01:14:08,174 --> 01:14:10,534
I fear Bristol has fallen.

765
01:14:17,534 --> 01:14:21,094
If Your Excellency will excuse me.
Your Majesty.

766
01:14:24,254 --> 01:14:26,294
My lords, His Majesty.

767
01:14:35,174 --> 01:14:38,534
Do you not rise, sir,
when your King approaches?

768
01:14:38,534 --> 01:14:41,654
Rise, sir! Or to your knees
in shame.

769
01:14:47,014 --> 01:14:52,574
You did give me your most solemn
promise that you would hold
Bristol for four months.

770
01:14:52,574 --> 01:14:54,734
Yet you have not held
it for four weeks!

771
01:14:54,734 --> 01:14:59,174
You promise mountains,
yet you perform molehills.

772
01:14:59,174 --> 01:15:01,534
You make a knave of your King!

773
01:15:01,534 --> 01:15:06,494
My lord...
We were besieged on all sides.

774
01:15:06,494 --> 01:15:11,134
Our men are foot weary from battle,
ailing with plague and sickness.

775
01:15:11,134 --> 01:15:14,774
Yet you contrived
to escape with your life.

776
01:15:14,774 --> 01:15:19,334
I have brought you an army, my lord.

777
01:15:19,334 --> 01:15:24,014
An army 2,000-strong, ready and
willing to fight on for their King!

778
01:15:24,014 --> 01:15:27,814
In exchange for all the corn and
stores you held in Bristol
and 200 cannon.

779
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:30,254
That was the price of
your freedom, sir.

780
01:15:30,254 --> 01:15:32,894
I did what I considered to be right!

781
01:15:32,894 --> 01:15:35,534
You deserted your command, sir.

782
01:15:37,174 --> 01:15:39,134
I made a military decision!

783
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:41,894
A decision that
may have cost us this war.

784
01:15:57,734 --> 01:16:03,014
Your action in this matter is of
such affliction to me, sir,

785
01:16:03,014 --> 01:16:07,334
that it is the greatest
trial that has yet befallen me.

786
01:16:10,334 --> 01:16:16,934
My conclusion is...to desire you to
seek subsistence elsewhere,

787
01:16:16,934 --> 01:16:18,574
not in my kingdom.

788
01:16:26,174 --> 01:16:28,574
Most gracious lord,

789
01:16:28,574 --> 01:16:34,934
I do not crave forgiveness, for by
all I hold most dear, I do solemnly
swear that I acted in good faith!

790
01:16:34,934 --> 01:16:37,934
The matter is at an end.
I will hear no more.

791
01:16:37,934 --> 01:16:39,134
My lord!

792
01:16:40,214 --> 01:16:42,014
My lord, I beseech you.

793
01:16:44,054 --> 01:16:47,054
In God's name, allow that
I may die with honour.

794
01:16:47,054 --> 01:16:48,974
Condemn me not to live.

795
01:16:48,974 --> 01:16:50,054
Captain Lunsford.

796
01:16:50,054 --> 01:16:54,134
Do not put upon these shoulders
the terrible shame of exile
and dishonour.

797
01:16:54,134 --> 01:16:58,574
I beg you,
take my life, most noble lord.

798
01:16:58,574 --> 01:17:00,454
Good uncle...

799
01:17:01,454 --> 01:17:04,414
..for pity's sake!

800
01:17:04,414 --> 01:17:10,094
His Highness is to be kept
under close guard until such time
as he is deported.

801
01:17:10,094 --> 01:17:13,094
Very well, Your Majesty.

802
01:18:53,774 --> 01:18:58,694
Father, Mother says I'm to
go with her tonight to France.

803
01:18:58,694 --> 01:19:00,254
Is that your wish, Father?

804
01:19:00,254 --> 01:19:01,214
Yes.

805
01:19:02,414 --> 01:19:06,134
My duty is to stay here with
you and fight beside you.

806
01:19:06,134 --> 01:19:09,254
Your place now is at your
mother's side, Charles.

807
01:19:09,254 --> 01:19:12,334
You will help her raise money,
perhaps an army.

808
01:19:13,894 --> 01:19:18,854
Should I meet my death,
and you are safely in France,

809
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:24,254
then England will still have,
in you, a lawful king.

810
01:19:24,254 --> 01:19:26,294
You will go with your mother.

811
01:19:35,134 --> 01:19:36,614
I love this land.

812
01:19:38,294 --> 01:19:42,014
And when this great
responsibility becomes yours...

813
01:19:43,094 --> 01:19:45,734
..then I pray that with God's help,

814
01:19:47,654 --> 01:19:49,934
you will reign more happily
than I have done.

815
01:19:55,094 --> 01:19:58,814
Now go, with God's speed
and your Father's blessing.

816
01:20:07,534 --> 01:20:09,574
Oh, Charles.

817
01:20:31,814 --> 01:20:33,334
I love you.

818
01:21:23,894 --> 01:21:25,934
Your Majesty,

819
01:21:25,934 --> 01:21:29,054
it is my most solemn duty
to place you under arrest.

820
01:21:30,134 --> 01:21:32,174
By whose command, sir?

821
01:21:32,174 --> 01:21:35,174
By the command of Parliament, sir.

822
01:21:36,374 --> 01:21:40,934
I know of no authority in England
above that of the King.

823
01:21:43,094 --> 01:21:46,534
It is upon that issue that
this war was fought.

824
01:21:49,934 --> 01:21:51,974
Whither am I to be taken?

825
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:53,654
To London, sir.

826
01:21:55,214 --> 01:21:57,094
You must grant me
a little time to...

827
01:21:57,094 --> 01:21:59,494
We leave for London at once.

828
01:21:59,494 --> 01:22:02,054
And my children, what of them?

829
01:22:02,054 --> 01:22:03,934
We will take care of your children.

830
01:22:03,934 --> 01:22:06,254
His Majesty will have
all the time he requires.

831
01:22:07,814 --> 01:22:10,814
As for your children, sir,
you may take them with you.

832
01:22:14,534 --> 01:22:16,334
I thank you, sir.

833
01:22:32,174 --> 01:22:39,254
# Him serve with fear
His praise foretell

834
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:47,294
# Come ye before him and rejoice

835
01:22:47,294 --> 01:22:54,974
# The Lord ye know
Is God indeed

836
01:22:54,974 --> 01:23:02,294
# Without our aid
He did us make

837
01:23:02,294 --> 01:23:04,894
# We are his flock... #

838
01:23:04,894 --> 01:23:06,734
General, John Pym is dead.

839
01:23:06,734 --> 01:23:09,574
# He doth us feed

840
01:23:09,574 --> 01:23:17,294
# And for his sheep
He doth us take... #

841
01:23:18,854 --> 01:23:21,374
When did it happen? This morning.

842
01:23:21,374 --> 01:23:23,054
What is it?

843
01:23:23,054 --> 01:23:25,094
John Pym is dead.

844
01:23:25,094 --> 01:23:28,094
Parliament is discussing
peace terms with the King.

845
01:23:28,094 --> 01:23:29,894
Does the army have no say in this?

846
01:23:29,894 --> 01:23:32,494
The army has been ordered to disband.

847
01:23:32,494 --> 01:23:37,294
In God's name, did we fight this
war that the politicians should
take over behind our backs?

848
01:23:37,294 --> 01:23:42,494
lf Parliament has decided the army
will disband, then the army
will disband.

849
01:23:42,494 --> 01:23:47,414
I say we take the army and march on
Parliament. The sword will not
rule this land.

850
01:23:47,414 --> 01:23:50,174
We fought a war to institute
a parliamentary system

851
01:23:50,174 --> 01:23:53,414
and overthrow the very tyranny
which you now propose.

852
01:23:54,974 --> 01:23:56,654
And who is talking to the King?

853
01:23:56,654 --> 01:23:58,094
Parliament? I doubt it.

854
01:23:58,094 --> 01:24:00,454
I warrant I know who is
doing all the talking.

855
01:24:04,894 --> 01:24:10,334
I have these past three days
been in consultation with
His Majesty the King.

856
01:24:10,334 --> 01:24:14,654
And I am pleased to inform the House
that the King is now prepared

857
01:24:14,654 --> 01:24:19,814
to discuss peace terms,
provided that the army stand down.

858
01:24:19,814 --> 01:24:21,494
SHOUTING

859
01:24:21,494 --> 01:24:27,734
I have given this House's assurance
that his wishes will
be complied with.

860
01:24:27,734 --> 01:24:33,614
Further, in recognition of the very
great debt this House owes its
Commander, General Cromwell,

861
01:24:33,614 --> 01:24:37,414
it is proposed to award him a
pension of £3,000 a year

862
01:24:37,414 --> 01:24:40,574
together with certain estates
in the county of Cambridge.

863
01:24:40,574 --> 01:24:42,614
APPLAUSE

864
01:24:43,814 --> 01:24:48,254
It is further proposed that
the sum of £2,000...

865
01:24:51,214 --> 01:24:57,334
Such low treachery is not worthy
even of you, my Lord Manchester.

866
01:24:58,334 --> 01:25:01,694
Am I to believe my ears?

867
01:25:01,694 --> 01:25:07,814
Did this nation win a bloody civil
war in order that the King should
dictate the terms of peace?

868
01:25:07,814 --> 01:25:11,534
I have discussed the matter at
great length with His Majesty.

869
01:25:11,534 --> 01:25:13,094
YOU have discussed it?

870
01:25:13,094 --> 01:25:16,174
It is a matter for this
House to discuss. Hear, hear!

871
01:25:16,174 --> 01:25:21,254
The King will not come to terms,
sir, until the army stand down.

872
01:25:21,254 --> 01:25:22,934
Hear, hear.

873
01:25:22,934 --> 01:25:28,094
And the army will not stand down
until the King comes to terms.

874
01:25:28,094 --> 01:25:32,774
So if the King will not
talk to this House,
then let the King talk to the army.

875
01:25:33,734 --> 01:25:36,614
Out of the question.
The King would never agree.

876
01:25:36,614 --> 01:25:41,894
Parliament is behind us, sir, and on
this occasion, we have the majority.

877
01:25:41,894 --> 01:25:44,294
CHEERING

878
01:25:47,654 --> 01:25:49,214
Sir Thomas Fairfax.

879
01:26:03,734 --> 01:26:05,294
He's bringing in the army!

880
01:26:05,294 --> 01:26:06,614
SHOUTING

881
01:26:06,614 --> 01:26:08,414
Order! Order!

882
01:26:10,814 --> 01:26:13,814
Order! Silence! Order!

883
01:26:13,814 --> 01:26:16,414
SHOUTING

884
01:26:16,414 --> 01:26:19,814
Silence! Order!

885
01:26:20,894 --> 01:26:25,454
I believe, my Lord Manchester,
that now I have the majority.

886
01:26:25,454 --> 01:26:27,214
This is dictatorship.

887
01:26:27,214 --> 01:26:29,174
It will mean a new civil war. Aye!

888
01:26:30,334 --> 01:26:31,334
Order!

889
01:26:33,334 --> 01:26:35,054
Honourable members.

890
01:26:36,854 --> 01:26:41,294
I swear before my God
that you give me no alternative.

891
01:26:41,294 --> 01:26:48,814
When those liberties for which this
army and this nation have fought so
hard are most solemnly guaranteed,

892
01:26:48,814 --> 01:26:51,494
then this army will stand down.

893
01:26:51,494 --> 01:26:54,974
And upon that, you have my most
sacred promise.

894
01:27:22,814 --> 01:27:24,694
Ah-ha-ha! And who have we here?

895
01:27:24,694 --> 01:27:26,174
It is I, my lord.

896
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:30,014
You are supposed to run, Sir
Edward, not let me catch you.

897
01:27:30,014 --> 01:27:33,814
I'm afraid I'm getting a little
too old for such games, my lord.

898
01:27:33,814 --> 01:27:35,494
Cromwell is here to see you.

899
01:27:36,254 --> 01:27:37,414
Oh.

900
01:27:40,814 --> 01:27:43,334
You must play on your
own now, children.

901
01:27:43,334 --> 01:27:46,054
Your father has other games to play.

902
01:27:47,254 --> 01:27:50,494
Prince Henry, you will be good
enough to give me back my hat.

903
01:27:52,054 --> 01:27:53,534
Sir.

904
01:28:07,094 --> 01:28:09,934
Gentlemen, His Majesty.

905
01:28:18,694 --> 01:28:20,774
We came to present
our terms, my lord.

906
01:28:20,774 --> 01:28:24,254
If Your Majesty will be so kind
as to study these proposals.

907
01:28:24,254 --> 01:28:26,414
Has Parliament approved this treaty?

908
01:28:26,414 --> 01:28:30,614
Parliament no longer truly
represents the people of
this nation, Sir Edward.

909
01:28:30,614 --> 01:28:36,094
And you, Mr Cromwell, do you truly
represent the people of this nation?

910
01:28:36,094 --> 01:28:42,254
I represent the army, sir,
and the army is the heart and
conscience of the people.

911
01:28:42,254 --> 01:28:50,614
So, having failed to come to terms
with Parliament, you would now
negotiate with the King?

912
01:28:50,614 --> 01:28:54,814
I am not bound to
negotiate with anyone.

913
01:28:54,814 --> 01:28:59,734
With 50,000 men under my command
I could impose a government
on this nation overnight.

914
01:29:00,814 --> 01:29:04,694
One is given to wondering,
Mr Cromwell, why you do not do that.

915
01:29:04,694 --> 01:29:08,134
I am deeply convinced, my lord,
it be the duty of Parliament

916
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:11,294
to frame a constitutional
government, and not the army.

917
01:29:11,294 --> 01:29:14,894
Then I do not see that you have
any need of me at all.

918
01:29:14,894 --> 01:29:17,414
On the contrary, sir.

919
01:29:17,414 --> 01:29:21,254
An England without a King
is unthinkable.

920
01:29:21,254 --> 01:29:24,694
But withal,
a King that can command respect,

921
01:29:24,694 --> 01:29:27,454
a monarch
who governs, not from fear,

922
01:29:27,454 --> 01:29:30,254
but by the affection
of a free people.

923
01:29:30,254 --> 01:29:34,934
Such a King could
reunite this great nation of ours

924
01:29:34,934 --> 01:29:40,574
and make the name of England
the noblest in all Christendom.

925
01:29:40,574 --> 01:29:46,214
Should you adorn that inheritance,
my lord, all Englishmen would
be proud to call you King.

926
01:29:47,294 --> 01:29:52,454
Mr Cromwell, I do confess
that I did greatly misjudge you,

927
01:29:52,454 --> 01:29:54,814
for I did mark you
as an ambitious man.

928
01:29:56,054 --> 01:29:59,654
To these ends, my lord,
I am ambitious.

929
01:29:59,654 --> 01:30:02,054
Then you have my respect, sir.

930
01:30:03,614 --> 01:30:05,734
Thank you, my lord.

931
01:30:08,494 --> 01:30:10,814
We shall return in the morning, sir.

932
01:30:10,814 --> 01:30:15,454
I shall require a little longer to
study this document. Perhaps a week.

933
01:30:15,454 --> 01:30:17,294
As Your Majesty pleases.

934
01:30:17,294 --> 01:30:22,814
I sincerely hope that our
future relations may be
equally amiable, sir.

935
01:30:22,814 --> 01:30:25,694
That is my hope also, my lord.

936
01:30:32,014 --> 01:30:33,974
A cunning fellow.

937
01:30:33,974 --> 01:30:37,214
I believe him to be a
sincere man, my lord. Indeed.

938
01:30:37,214 --> 01:30:43,814
lf these proposals be acceptable,
there never was a crown so nearly
lost, so easily recovered.

939
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:47,054
Whatever these
proposals may be, Sir Edward

940
01:30:47,054 --> 01:30:49,694
they are not acceptable to the King.

941
01:30:56,014 --> 01:30:58,654
Cromwell has betrayed us! Aye!

942
01:30:58,654 --> 01:31:03,494
We have given our blood and our lives
in this war to put down this king!

943
01:31:03,494 --> 01:31:07,334
lf Cromwell comes to terms with him
now, what price our freedom then?

944
01:31:08,414 --> 01:31:09,614
Get back, will you?

945
01:31:10,774 --> 01:31:16,174
I have served General Cromwell
faithfully all my life

946
01:31:16,174 --> 01:31:19,934
and I reckoned him to be
a man who feared God

947
01:31:19,934 --> 01:31:21,974
and did honour his word!

948
01:31:21,974 --> 01:31:27,974
But in this business he has shown
himself to be a man of no honour!

949
01:31:29,534 --> 01:31:34,054
We fought this war
to remove this King,

950
01:31:34,054 --> 01:31:37,934
not to put him back on the throne!

951
01:31:37,934 --> 01:31:44,414
I say, let us march on London,
let us take Parliament,

952
01:31:44,414 --> 01:31:47,534
and then let the King
try to negotiate with us!

953
01:31:47,534 --> 01:31:49,534
SHOUTING

954
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:54,734
Make way for Cromwell.

955
01:31:54,734 --> 01:31:56,534
Traitors! Mutineers!

956
01:31:59,174 --> 01:32:03,374
I don't have to tell you,
any of you, you could
all be hanged for this.

957
01:32:03,374 --> 01:32:06,374
We are not serfs, General,
nor mercenaries.

958
01:32:06,374 --> 01:32:10,174
We have fought for the Lord in our
cause, and now we have a right
to speak.

959
01:32:10,174 --> 01:32:13,414
You have no rights
to preach revolt and mutiny.

960
01:32:15,014 --> 01:32:19,454
As for you, John Carter,
I did expect a greater
degree of loyalty from you.

961
01:32:19,454 --> 01:32:21,974
I am still loyal to
what I fought for, sir.

962
01:32:21,974 --> 01:32:23,294
Can the same be said of you?

963
01:32:23,294 --> 01:32:27,974
I have not betrayed my God, country,
Parliament or my conscience.

964
01:32:27,974 --> 01:32:31,814
And where was your
conscience this day,
when you parleyed with the King?

965
01:32:31,814 --> 01:32:39,374
I tell you, all of you,
I do most honestly believe that we
have taught this King a lesson.

966
01:32:39,374 --> 01:32:41,414
And he will prove most honourable.

967
01:32:41,414 --> 01:32:44,294
Upon that I would stake my life.

968
01:32:44,294 --> 01:32:46,814
Traitor! Traitor!

969
01:32:46,814 --> 01:32:50,414
This is a military camp,
sir, not a debating chamber.

970
01:32:50,414 --> 01:32:54,494
Under military law, any man
inciting to mutiny can be hanged.

971
01:32:54,494 --> 01:32:57,854
Colonel Harrison? Yes, General.
These three men will draw lots.

972
01:32:57,854 --> 01:33:01,214
One of them will be hanged. Captain
Lancing, get a length of rope.

973
01:33:01,214 --> 01:33:05,054
Yes, sir. You, man.
Yes, sir. Pick up some straws.

974
01:33:26,654 --> 01:33:30,134
General, there is a Sir
Edward Hyde to see you.

975
01:33:39,014 --> 01:33:42,734
Sir Edward, has the King considered
our terms?

976
01:33:42,734 --> 01:33:45,254
The King, sir, has not
even read your terms.

977
01:33:45,254 --> 01:33:47,894
Nor, will I venture, has he
any intention of so doing.

978
01:33:49,534 --> 01:33:52,814
He has this day drawn up a secret
treaty with Manchester and Essex

979
01:33:52,814 --> 01:33:55,814
to raise a Scottish army against
the Parliamentary forces.

980
01:33:56,894 --> 01:34:01,094
He has already consented to
a Catholic army from Ireland.

981
01:34:01,094 --> 01:34:03,814
While you negotiate a
settlement with him,

982
01:34:03,814 --> 01:34:06,494
he is planning a second civil war.

983
01:34:12,254 --> 01:34:16,214
I do confess that I have these many
years given my allegiance
to a man...

984
01:34:17,774 --> 01:34:20,854
..not worthy of the
title, King of England.

985
01:34:24,494 --> 01:34:26,654
HORSE WHINNIES

986
01:34:26,654 --> 01:34:27,974
Colonel Harrison!

987
01:34:46,094 --> 01:34:53,534
I will have this King's head,
aye, and the crown upon it.

988
01:34:56,774 --> 01:35:00,494
This obstinate King,
this man of blood,

989
01:35:00,494 --> 01:35:05,654
whose heart God has hardened,
can no longer be trusted,

990
01:35:05,654 --> 01:35:10,574
for in prodigious treason, he has
revealed himself to be a traitor.

991
01:35:10,574 --> 01:35:12,974
A man of no honour.

992
01:35:12,974 --> 01:35:17,734
A man unfitted to bear the title,
king of England.

993
01:35:17,734 --> 01:35:18,854
Hear, hear.

994
01:35:20,414 --> 01:35:26,174
I demand, therefore, in the name
of the army and in the name
of the people of this nation

995
01:35:26,174 --> 01:35:33,094
that Charles I, king of England be
brought hence to stand trial
for his life on a charge of treason.

996
01:35:37,334 --> 01:35:41,654
Oh yay, oh yay, oh yay.

997
01:35:41,654 --> 01:35:47,174
All manner of persons having
anything to do with this court come
forward and give your attendance.

998
01:35:47,174 --> 01:35:51,614
Every man to keep silence
upon pain of imprisonment.

999
01:35:51,614 --> 01:35:53,654
God save the King.

1000
01:36:15,614 --> 01:36:17,534
Let the prisoner be brought in.

1001
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:57,734
The clerk of arraigns
will read the charges.

1002
01:37:01,934 --> 01:37:08,054
Charles Stuart, King of England,
you stand before this court
charged with high treason,

1003
01:37:08,054 --> 01:37:11,054
in that being admitted
King of England,

1004
01:37:11,054 --> 01:37:15,014
and therein trusted with power to
govern according to the laws
of the land,

1005
01:37:15,014 --> 01:37:17,054
you did out of wickedness and design

1006
01:37:17,054 --> 01:37:20,894
erect and uphold in yourself an
unlimited and tyrannical power -

1007
01:37:20,894 --> 01:37:25,934
to rule at your will
and to overthrow the rights
and liberties of the people.

1008
01:37:25,934 --> 01:37:29,614
And that you did
traitorously and maliciously

1009
01:37:29,614 --> 01:37:33,454
levy a cruel war
against Parliament and the people.

1010
01:37:33,454 --> 01:37:39,694
And are therefore guilty of all the
treasons, rapings, burnings, spoils,

1011
01:37:39,694 --> 01:37:44,414
desolations, damages and mischiefs to
the nation committed in the said war.

1012
01:37:44,414 --> 01:37:47,534
Thus, on behalf of
the people of England,

1013
01:37:47,534 --> 01:37:55,454
this court impeaches you as a tyrant,
traitor, murderer and public enemy
to the Commonwealth of England.

1014
01:37:55,454 --> 01:37:57,014
God save the King!

1015
01:37:57,014 --> 01:37:58,454
Silence!

1016
01:38:02,294 --> 01:38:07,574
Sir, you have heard
the charges against you.

1017
01:38:07,574 --> 01:38:09,214
The court expects an answer.

1018
01:38:10,294 --> 01:38:15,494
First, I would know by what
authority, I mean lawful authority,

1019
01:38:15,494 --> 01:38:19,334
I am brought here and carried from
place to place, and I know not what.

1020
01:38:19,334 --> 01:38:23,534
And by what authority you
presume to sit in judgement on me.

1021
01:38:23,534 --> 01:38:27,134
Remember, I am your lawful King.

1022
01:38:27,134 --> 01:38:29,654
Think well upon it.

1023
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:34,414
I have a trust committed to me
by God, by old and lawful descent.

1024
01:38:34,414 --> 01:38:38,414
Therefore, let me know by what
authority I am brought here,

1025
01:38:38,414 --> 01:38:39,934
and I shall answer.

1026
01:38:39,934 --> 01:38:42,854
It is not for the prisoner
to question the court.

1027
01:38:45,614 --> 01:38:48,974
I am no ordinary prisoner, sir.

1028
01:38:50,054 --> 01:38:53,414
An answer, sir.
The court demands an answer.

1029
01:38:54,974 --> 01:38:57,134
Then I refuse an answer.

1030
01:38:57,134 --> 01:39:00,254
Sir, you are before
a court of justice.

1031
01:39:01,814 --> 01:39:06,334
Well, sir, I see that
I am before a power.

1032
01:39:08,654 --> 01:39:11,134
The court will keep silent.

1033
01:39:11,134 --> 01:39:14,534
Mr Solicitor General,
are your witnesses prepared?

1034
01:39:14,534 --> 01:39:17,654
They are, my lord.
Then let them be brought forth.

1035
01:39:17,654 --> 01:39:20,774
Call Sir Edward Hyde.

1036
01:39:26,534 --> 01:39:30,734
And you saw the King and his wife

1037
01:39:30,734 --> 01:39:35,654
alone in their chambers with this
Catholic Archbishop Rinuccini?

1038
01:39:36,734 --> 01:39:38,374
I did.

1039
01:39:38,374 --> 01:39:41,774
And what did you assume was the
purpose of this meeting?

1040
01:39:50,774 --> 01:39:52,934
You are obliged to
answer, Sir Edward.

1041
01:39:54,814 --> 01:39:56,894
To raise an Irish army, my lord.

1042
01:39:56,894 --> 01:39:59,854
To fight
against the Parliamentary forces?

1043
01:40:02,054 --> 01:40:04,094
And at this time,

1044
01:40:04,094 --> 01:40:08,414
was the King in communication
with any other foreign power?

1045
01:40:12,134 --> 01:40:15,374
Yes. Yes, with the King of France
and with the Dutch.

1046
01:40:15,374 --> 01:40:17,414
For the same purpose?

1047
01:40:17,414 --> 01:40:18,614
Yes.

1048
01:40:19,774 --> 01:40:23,414
To raise a foreign army
to invade this country...

1049
01:40:26,054 --> 01:40:30,214
..and to perpetuate the war
against the people of this kingdom.

1050
01:40:36,494 --> 01:40:37,454
Sir Edward?

1051
01:40:41,654 --> 01:40:42,734
Yes.

1052
01:40:42,734 --> 01:40:45,134
SHOUTING

1053
01:40:45,134 --> 01:40:46,694
To the blocks with him!

1054
01:41:29,374 --> 01:41:33,014
Sir, throughout the three days
of this hearing,

1055
01:41:33,014 --> 01:41:36,334
this court has patiently awaited
your pleasure,

1056
01:41:36,334 --> 01:41:39,494
to hear what you have to say in
answer to the charges against you.

1057
01:41:39,494 --> 01:41:43,054
Yet you have declined to speak.

1058
01:41:43,054 --> 01:41:47,054
I am most willing, sir,
to answer before Parliament.

1059
01:41:47,054 --> 01:41:53,774
But not before this assembly, whose
authority I refuse to acknowledge.

1060
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:58,454
Sir, what answers you may offer
the Commons can be given here,

1061
01:41:58,454 --> 01:42:01,574
for this court does sit in the
name of the House of Commons.

1062
01:42:01,574 --> 01:42:08,854
Sir, if, as you have said, you do
love the liberty of the subject,
you will grant me, your King,

1063
01:42:08,854 --> 01:42:14,414
a hearing before Parliament, which
is the Lords and Commons assembled.

1064
01:42:15,734 --> 01:42:18,614
Sir, I submit you seek only
to delay the course of justice.

1065
01:42:18,614 --> 01:42:22,574
By your favour, sir,
I seek only those rights which,

1066
01:42:22,574 --> 01:42:26,174
as your King, I would grant
to any one of my subjects.

1067
01:42:26,174 --> 01:42:28,214
SHOUTING

1068
01:42:29,174 --> 01:42:30,854
Silence!

1069
01:42:33,014 --> 01:42:38,174
Sir, this court requires to know if
you have anything to say before
judgment is passed upon you.

1070
01:42:39,734 --> 01:42:42,854
I have nothing to say to you.

1071
01:42:44,494 --> 01:42:47,414
Then this court
will retire to judgment.

1072
01:42:50,894 --> 01:42:53,774
What ails thee? Art thou mad?

1073
01:42:53,774 --> 01:42:56,774
Have we come thus far that
you would betray us now?

1074
01:42:56,774 --> 01:43:01,414
There is nothing in the constitution
of this land that entitles us
to bring a King to trial.

1075
01:43:01,414 --> 01:43:03,734
Is not the King
answerable to his subjects?

1076
01:43:03,734 --> 01:43:05,494
The trial is clearly illegal...

1077
01:43:05,494 --> 01:43:08,734
Is not the King
answerable to his subjects?

1078
01:43:08,734 --> 01:43:11,414
The King, sir, is
answerable only to God.

1079
01:43:11,414 --> 01:43:15,974
Then by God, when he dies, he
shall have much to answer for.
We have gone too far in this matter.

1080
01:43:15,974 --> 01:43:20,654
This commission has no lawful
authority... Our authority lies with
the Parliament, sir.

1081
01:43:20,654 --> 01:43:22,694
Parliament is the law in this land.

1082
01:43:22,694 --> 01:43:29,054
If the charges against this King be
not proven, what terrible retribution
may he not bring down upon our heads?

1083
01:43:29,054 --> 01:43:30,014
Aye! Aye!

1084
01:43:30,014 --> 01:43:33,494
In the name of God! What are we all?

1085
01:43:33,494 --> 01:43:34,694
Men?

1086
01:43:35,774 --> 01:43:40,214
Cowering and quivering
like downtrodden serfs.

1087
01:43:42,134 --> 01:43:47,414
The King is not England,
and England is not the King!

1088
01:43:50,414 --> 01:43:55,534
It is not the survival of the King
that is at issue here.

1089
01:43:57,134 --> 01:44:00,254
It is the survival of England.

1090
01:44:01,814 --> 01:44:06,614
And this King, by his dishonesties,

1091
01:44:06,614 --> 01:44:08,854
by his treasons,

1092
01:44:08,854 --> 01:44:11,894
and by his secret treaties
with foreign powers,

1093
01:44:11,894 --> 01:44:16,814
has shown himself to be ill-fitted
to govern this great nation!

1094
01:44:21,014 --> 01:44:23,414
As God is my witness, Oliver,

1095
01:44:23,414 --> 01:44:26,414
I desire not the King's death,

1096
01:44:26,414 --> 01:44:29,174
but the settlement
of this nation in peace.

1097
01:44:29,174 --> 01:44:32,974
Do you think I don't desire that?

1098
01:44:32,974 --> 01:44:35,174
Go back to my farm and my family?

1099
01:44:45,014 --> 01:44:45,974
Very well.

1100
01:44:47,294 --> 01:44:49,574
Go again to this King.

1101
01:44:49,574 --> 01:44:52,294
Offer him once more our terms.

1102
01:44:52,294 --> 01:44:55,814
Though God knows, he should be
well-acquainted with them by now.

1103
01:44:55,814 --> 01:45:02,174
Tell him he may sit upon his throne,
but that this country will
be governed by Parliament,

1104
01:45:02,174 --> 01:45:05,174
and Parliament will be
elected by the people.

1105
01:45:05,174 --> 01:45:10,814
Now, Sir Thomas, if you can achieve
this, where we have failed,

1106
01:45:10,814 --> 01:45:13,694
this trial will end.

1107
01:45:28,214 --> 01:45:33,374
Here is a warrant demanding the
death of the King upon the charge of
high treason against this nation.

1108
01:45:35,414 --> 01:45:38,294
It will require all your signatures.

1109
01:45:39,734 --> 01:45:40,694
Sir Thomas...

1110
01:45:44,014 --> 01:45:48,374
I have come thus far with you,
Oliver, in our great cause,

1111
01:45:48,374 --> 01:45:50,894
but I will not sign this warrant.

1112
01:46:12,974 --> 01:46:15,734
Sign it. Oliver, I cannot.
Is he guilty or not guilty?

1113
01:46:15,734 --> 01:46:17,534
He is the King! Is he guilty?

1114
01:46:17,534 --> 01:46:18,974
Yes. Sign it.

1115
01:46:50,534 --> 01:46:54,494
Charles Stuart, King of England...

1116
01:46:56,054 --> 01:47:01,214
..you have been found
guilty of high treason against
the good people of this nation,

1117
01:47:01,214 --> 01:47:05,974
represented in Parliament,
by whose authority this court
does sit in judgment upon you.

1118
01:47:07,054 --> 01:47:09,454
And upon this charge,

1119
01:47:09,454 --> 01:47:15,494
it is the sentence of this court
that you be taken hence to an...

1120
01:47:15,494 --> 01:47:17,494
..appointed place...

1121
01:47:19,334 --> 01:47:22,534
..and put to death by the
severing of the head from the body.

1122
01:47:22,534 --> 01:47:25,334
And that is the sentence
of the whole court.

1123
01:47:25,334 --> 01:47:28,214
SOME SHOUTING

1124
01:47:28,214 --> 01:47:30,134
Remove the prisoner. Silence!

1125
01:47:31,694 --> 01:47:33,934
Will you hear me a word, sir?

1126
01:47:33,934 --> 01:47:35,894
No. You're not to
be heard after sentence.

1127
01:47:35,894 --> 01:47:38,614
By your favour, sir.

1128
01:47:38,614 --> 01:47:42,614
I know as much law as any man here.
I have the right to be heard.

1129
01:47:42,614 --> 01:47:45,134
No, sir. Guard,
Remove your prisoner!

1130
01:47:45,134 --> 01:47:47,174
SHOUTING

1131
01:47:48,734 --> 01:47:50,294
I demand to be heard!

1132
01:47:50,294 --> 01:47:53,654
I am your lawful King!

1133
01:47:55,934 --> 01:47:57,854
To the block for the traitor!

1134
01:49:00,494 --> 01:49:01,534
General.

1135
01:49:03,854 --> 01:49:05,134
Sir Thomas.

1136
01:49:09,614 --> 01:49:12,214
I have been this past
night to the commissioners.

1137
01:49:13,814 --> 01:49:16,454
They have instructed
me to lay before you

1138
01:49:16,454 --> 01:49:20,174
this warrant for £40,000

1139
01:49:20,174 --> 01:49:22,334
in return for the King's life.

1140
01:49:32,294 --> 01:49:37,214
How little you know me, that you
think you can buy my principles.

1141
01:49:41,174 --> 01:49:43,574
You insult me with that cheap bribe.

1142
01:49:51,254 --> 01:49:53,654
Will you not think on it?

1143
01:49:53,654 --> 01:49:55,814
I have thought on it.

1144
01:49:57,374 --> 01:49:58,814
And well.

1145
01:50:01,334 --> 01:50:05,654
By my God, I have thought on it.

1146
01:50:08,534 --> 01:50:12,974
"Then the soldiers of the governor
took Jesus into the common hall.

1147
01:50:12,974 --> 01:50:16,214
"And they stripped him and
put on him a scarlet robe.

1148
01:50:16,214 --> 01:50:20,894
"And when they had platted a crown
of thorns, they put it
upon his head.

1149
01:50:20,894 --> 01:50:26,414
"And they bowed before him
and mocked him, saying,
'Hail, King of the Jews!'

1150
01:50:26,414 --> 01:50:29,014
"And they spit..." Your Majesty.

1151
01:50:29,014 --> 01:50:31,934
Is it time? No, Your Majesty.

1152
01:50:31,934 --> 01:50:36,734
Her Royal Highness,
the Princess Elizabeth,
and his Royal Highness, Prince Henry.

1153
01:50:39,254 --> 01:50:41,054
Elizabeth, sweetheart.

1154
01:50:45,974 --> 01:50:48,614
Do not grieve for me. Henry...

1155
01:50:55,094 --> 01:50:57,014
Now, both of you...

1156
01:51:03,374 --> 01:51:04,894
Mark what I say.

1157
01:51:11,894 --> 01:51:15,014
They will cut off thy father's head.

1158
01:51:15,014 --> 01:51:19,454
Sshh. There now. Henry, pay
careful attention to what I say.

1159
01:51:21,254 --> 01:51:24,934
You must not let them make you king.

1160
01:51:24,934 --> 01:51:28,574
Not while your brother Charles is
still alive.

1161
01:51:28,574 --> 01:51:30,974
I would be torn to pieces first.
That's my son.

1162
01:51:33,374 --> 01:51:36,014
Today, your brother will be king.

1163
01:51:38,534 --> 01:51:40,334
Elizabeth, now.

1164
01:51:42,374 --> 01:51:45,374
It's a glorious death to which I go.

1165
01:51:47,894 --> 01:51:49,454
Tell your mother...

1166
01:51:54,574 --> 01:51:57,614
..that my love for her
was the same to the last.

1167
01:52:01,094 --> 01:52:03,854
And remember me in

1168
01:52:03,854 --> 01:52:05,294
your prayers.

1169
01:52:10,454 --> 01:52:12,614
The King's escort, Your Majesty.

1170
01:52:12,614 --> 01:52:14,054
Thank you.

1171
01:52:15,974 --> 01:52:17,654
God bless you both.

1172
01:52:37,214 --> 01:52:39,374
What kind of morning is it, Colonel?

1173
01:52:39,374 --> 01:52:43,454
Indeed it is
somewhat chilly, Your Majesty.

1174
01:52:43,454 --> 01:52:45,854
Then I was wise to
put on a second shirt.

1175
01:52:47,734 --> 01:52:52,094
For if I trembled with the cold, my
enemies would say it was from fear.

1176
01:52:52,094 --> 01:52:55,214
I would not expose myself
to such a reproach.

1177
01:52:58,694 --> 01:53:00,614
Please keep them.

1178
01:53:00,614 --> 01:53:02,414
Oh, Your Majesty!

1179
01:53:03,974 --> 01:53:07,574
I do not fear death, Sir Thomas.

1180
01:53:07,574 --> 01:53:10,094
It is not at all terrible to me.

1181
01:53:13,214 --> 01:53:16,694
I thank my God I
have prepared for it.

1182
01:53:16,694 --> 01:53:20,654
Are we to ride
to Westminster, or walk?

1183
01:53:20,654 --> 01:53:22,894
My orders are that we
walk, Your Majesty.

1184
01:53:22,894 --> 01:53:27,614
Admirable.
The morning air will do me good.

1185
01:53:37,814 --> 01:53:39,494
BELL CHIMES

1186
01:53:39,494 --> 01:53:42,574
The King's coming.

1187
01:53:42,574 --> 01:53:45,494
He's coming now! The King's coming!

1188
01:53:45,494 --> 01:53:47,054
Hey, you. Stop him!

1189
01:53:47,054 --> 01:53:49,174
Gentlemen, the King comes.

1190
01:53:58,214 --> 01:54:00,974
Traitor! Execute him!

1191
01:54:04,454 --> 01:54:06,134
Execute him!

1192
01:54:12,334 --> 01:54:16,334
..and a true, urgent sword in our
hands. God bless, Your Majesty.

1193
01:54:16,334 --> 01:54:18,254
God bless you!

1194
01:54:25,934 --> 01:54:27,614
Escort, halt!

1195
01:55:42,494 --> 01:55:47,774
Well, gentlemen, are you afraid to
kill your King with an open face?

1196
01:56:00,134 --> 01:56:02,774
I will not delay you long,

1197
01:56:02,774 --> 01:56:04,534
but will say only this to you -

1198
01:56:06,134 --> 01:56:10,774
as God is my witness,
I have forgiven those that
have brought me here.

1199
01:56:10,774 --> 01:56:15,854
And pray that my death
be not laid to their charge.

1200
01:56:15,854 --> 01:56:21,974
For I do endeavour even to the last
to maintain the peace

1201
01:56:21,974 --> 01:56:23,654
of MY kingdom.

1202
01:56:25,574 --> 01:56:28,534
I go now, from a corruptible

1203
01:56:30,134 --> 01:56:33,254
to an incorruptible crown.

1204
01:56:34,814 --> 01:56:40,814
To everlasting peace.

1205
01:57:01,694 --> 01:57:03,014
Will that suffice?

1206
01:57:17,614 --> 01:57:22,694
Permit me, sir, that I may pray a
while before the blow is struck.

1207
01:57:22,694 --> 01:57:25,694
Then when I put out my hands so -

1208
01:57:25,694 --> 01:57:28,694
that will be the sign.

1209
01:57:41,254 --> 01:57:44,534
Lord, let us now thy servant depart
in peace according to thy word.

1210
01:57:44,534 --> 01:57:49,054
For mine eyes have seen thy
salvation which thou has prepared
before the face of all people.

1211
01:57:49,054 --> 01:57:51,374
Glory be to the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost.

1212
01:57:51,374 --> 01:57:53,534
As it was in the beginning,
is now and ever shall be.

1213
01:58:07,294 --> 01:58:12,374
Behold! The head of a traitor!

1214
01:58:40,574 --> 01:58:43,294
We did not assassinate.

1215
01:58:43,294 --> 01:58:47,534
Nor was this thing done in a
corner - it was done in the face of
God, and of all men.

1216
01:58:49,094 --> 01:58:52,454
The office of King is now abolished.

1217
01:58:52,454 --> 01:58:55,814
Long live Parliament.
Long live the Republic.

1218
01:58:55,814 --> 01:58:57,614
ALL: Aye, long live the Republic.

1219
01:59:09,494 --> 01:59:12,854
Richard, I want to
go back to Cambridge.

1220
01:59:12,854 --> 01:59:15,374
Will you come with me, son?

1221
01:59:15,374 --> 01:59:16,814
lf you wish, Father.

1222
01:59:18,454 --> 01:59:20,294
It will be peace
and quiet there now.

1223
01:59:21,934 --> 01:59:24,614
God knows,
my soul craves a little peace.

1224
02:00:04,694 --> 02:00:08,174
You must not think on it, Oliver.

1225
02:00:08,174 --> 02:00:10,094
'Tis over now.

1226
02:00:10,094 --> 02:00:12,454
The war, everything.

1227
02:00:14,054 --> 02:00:15,734
'Tis over and done.

1228
02:00:24,134 --> 02:00:28,094
Oliver, you're home now.

1229
02:00:28,094 --> 02:00:30,454
There's nothing more to think on.

1230
02:00:32,054 --> 02:00:35,414
Save that we two may grow
old together in peace.

1231
02:00:43,694 --> 02:00:45,134
Peace.

1232
02:01:17,774 --> 02:01:23,534
Father - Henry Ireton is at the
house with some men from Parliament.

1233
02:01:28,214 --> 02:01:29,654
I'll be along shortly.

1234
02:02:13,334 --> 02:02:14,894
Tom.

1235
02:02:16,654 --> 02:02:18,094
Arthur.

1236
02:02:21,014 --> 02:02:24,494
Henry.

1237
02:02:28,934 --> 02:02:30,734
Well, you all seem solemn enough.

1238
02:02:30,734 --> 02:02:33,494
It is a solemn business
that brings us here, Oliver.

1239
02:02:33,494 --> 02:02:37,574
Well...speak of it.

1240
02:02:39,134 --> 02:02:42,494
The country needs a head of state,
Oliver. It must be governed.

1241
02:02:42,494 --> 02:02:45,014
Is it not governed by Parliament?

1242
02:02:45,014 --> 02:02:46,694
There must be a figurehead.

1243
02:02:46,694 --> 02:02:48,454
It is our tradition.

1244
02:02:48,454 --> 02:02:53,774
The country needs a King, Oliver.
God knows, you've said so
many times yourself.

1245
02:02:59,174 --> 02:03:02,374
The country
will be ruled by Parliament.

1246
02:03:02,374 --> 02:03:06,614
Now, in the name of Christ,
how often must I say that?

1247
02:03:06,614 --> 02:03:08,654
And who will control Parliament?

1248
02:03:08,654 --> 02:03:11,054
The people, the people, the people!

1249
02:03:11,054 --> 02:03:12,854
It's not practical. It won't work.

1250
02:03:12,854 --> 02:03:14,894
It will work

1251
02:03:14,894 --> 02:03:16,694
and it must work.

1252
02:03:16,694 --> 02:03:21,094
We are here, on behalf of Parliament,
to offer you the Crown.

1253
02:03:27,014 --> 02:03:30,014
To offer...

1254
02:03:33,614 --> 02:03:37,654
Me, King of England?

1255
02:04:02,414 --> 02:04:05,294
King Oliver I of England!

1256
02:04:12,574 --> 02:04:17,054
Elizabeth, tell me,
do you see before you a king?

1257
02:04:17,054 --> 02:04:21,614
This tired, sickening man,
this country oaf,

1258
02:04:21,614 --> 02:04:24,734
crude in speech and manner?

1259
02:04:30,374 --> 02:04:32,414
This rough fellow -

1260
02:04:34,334 --> 02:04:38,014
does he display the
bearing of a king?

1261
02:04:42,694 --> 02:04:45,614
You are the one man who
can govern this country.

1262
02:04:45,614 --> 02:04:47,894
In the name of God!

1263
02:04:47,894 --> 02:04:52,694
Did we cut the head off this
king only to steal his crown?

1264
02:04:52,694 --> 02:04:57,494
This hollow golden ring,
this worthless trinket?

1265
02:04:57,494 --> 02:05:00,974
Give it to a whore,
for the price of her bed!

1266
02:05:00,974 --> 02:05:04,694
And if you would find a head to fit
it, let it adorn some court jester

1267
02:05:04,694 --> 02:05:09,494
or some strolling player that
he may play your king, but not I!

1268
02:05:09,494 --> 02:05:12,934
Power must be absolute,
or it be no power at all.

1269
02:05:12,934 --> 02:05:15,494
It was not for
power that we did this thing.

1270
02:05:15,494 --> 02:05:18,734
Have you not understood that yet?

1271
02:05:18,734 --> 02:05:22,454
Now, Ireton,
mark me, and mark me well.

1272
02:05:22,454 --> 02:05:25,214
That you be hard set upon
courses has not escaped me.

1273
02:05:25,214 --> 02:05:28,214
And if you should seek to
use me towards such ends,

1274
02:05:28,214 --> 02:05:31,774
though I love you like a brother,
I swear, I will destroy you.

1275
02:05:43,334 --> 02:05:46,454
Every freeborn Englishman -

1276
02:05:46,454 --> 02:05:52,334
be he the lowest of the lowest -
is entitled to a voice in the
governing of this country.

1277
02:05:53,534 --> 02:05:57,614
There is no vote for the poor,
for the underprivileged - no vote

1278
02:05:57,614 --> 02:06:04,574
for all those who took up arms to put
down the very autocracy that this
Parliament now imposes upon us.

1279
02:06:06,374 --> 02:06:09,254
You did not vote this
Parliament into office!

1280
02:06:09,254 --> 02:06:12,934
This gaggle of
buffoons, these villains!

1281
02:06:13,454 --> 02:06:17,054
Much has been said in this House
about the so called inequity of

1282
02:06:17,054 --> 02:06:21,374
certain members being financially
involved in national projects.

1283
02:06:21,374 --> 02:06:27,374
Members have ascribed to
this state of affairs
dark and sinister motives.

1284
02:06:27,374 --> 02:06:31,934
I say if we in Parliament cannot
gain from ruling the country,

1285
02:06:31,934 --> 02:06:36,014
there's really very little point
in our being here at all.

1286
02:06:37,574 --> 02:06:41,414
No member of this House should be
permitted to profit from his office.

1287
02:06:41,414 --> 02:06:44,294
Hear, hear! lf this
House knew its duty to the nation,

1288
02:06:44,294 --> 02:06:47,494
it would terminate its sitting,
and let a new Parliament be elected.

1289
02:06:47,494 --> 02:06:48,574
Order!

1290
02:06:48,574 --> 02:06:53,174
Gentlemen, I move that this House
be given power to remain in office

1291
02:06:53,174 --> 02:06:56,894
a further three years
without re-election.

1292
02:07:01,454 --> 02:07:04,454
In my opinion, a committee
of inquiry should be set up

1293
02:07:04,454 --> 02:07:08,054
to investigate the financial
involvements of certain members...

1294
02:07:11,774 --> 02:07:13,574
Order!

1295
02:07:22,214 --> 02:07:28,574
Mr Speaker - may I have your
permission to address this assembly?
By all means, sir.

1296
02:07:30,254 --> 02:07:32,254
My lords,

1297
02:07:32,254 --> 02:07:33,734
honourable members -

1298
02:07:36,374 --> 02:07:40,574
I have always desired,
above my life, a free Parliament,

1299
02:07:40,574 --> 02:07:45,254
sitting by the authority
of the good people of this nation.

1300
02:07:45,254 --> 02:07:49,694
A Parliament open and visible,
to be seen by all men.

1301
02:07:51,254 --> 02:07:57,254
It is six years since I handed over
to you this great responsibility,

1302
02:07:57,254 --> 02:08:02,774
in the hope that you would make good
and wholesome laws which the people
of this nation expected of you.

1303
02:08:04,414 --> 02:08:05,974
I must

1304
02:08:05,974 --> 02:08:09,974
confess to some
abatement of my hopes -

1305
02:08:11,894 --> 02:08:13,774
for what has happened in my absence.

1306
02:08:15,734 --> 02:08:18,974
Instead of uniting

1307
02:08:18,974 --> 02:08:21,614
the good people of this nation,

1308
02:08:21,614 --> 02:08:24,494
with righteousness and peace,

1309
02:08:24,494 --> 02:08:28,934
which would have been a glorious and
Christian thing to have done,

1310
02:08:28,934 --> 02:08:30,374
what do I find?

1311
02:08:34,334 --> 02:08:38,494
Anarchy, corruption,

1312
02:08:38,494 --> 02:08:40,094
division

1313
02:08:40,094 --> 02:08:42,014
and dissatisfaction.

1314
02:08:46,574 --> 02:08:51,014
I say that the enemies of
this nation have flourished

1315
02:08:51,014 --> 02:08:52,694
under your protection.

1316
02:08:54,374 --> 02:08:59,894
You were from the beginning
a provisional government, not truly
representative of the people.

1317
02:08:59,894 --> 02:09:03,134
For have the people elected you?

1318
02:09:03,134 --> 02:09:07,894
Has this House gone once to the
people it purports to represent?

1319
02:09:07,894 --> 02:09:09,854
No, it has not!

1320
02:09:09,854 --> 02:09:13,774
And after six years of
misgovernment, what do we find?

1321
02:09:13,774 --> 02:09:18,374
Sir Thomas Fairfax moves a bill to
give this House a further lease of

1322
02:09:18,374 --> 02:09:21,334
its worthless
and dishonourable life!

1323
02:09:22,934 --> 02:09:29,654
Gentlemen,
an immovable Parliament is more
obnoxious than an immovable king!

1324
02:09:33,374 --> 02:09:41,174
Drunkards, tricksters, villains,
whoremasters, godless, self-seeking,
ambitious tricksters.

1325
02:09:42,334 --> 02:09:44,774
You are no more capable
of conducting the affairs

1326
02:09:44,774 --> 02:09:48,014
of this nation
than you are of running a brothel!

1327
02:09:48,014 --> 02:09:50,774
You are...! You are scum, sir.

1328
02:09:50,774 --> 02:09:53,014
And not truly elected scum at that.

1329
02:09:53,014 --> 02:09:55,654
This is no Parliament.

1330
02:09:55,654 --> 02:10:00,374
I shall put an end to your sitting.
I hereby declare this Parliament
dissolved!

1331
02:10:00,374 --> 02:10:03,614
Colonel Harrison! Yes, sir.
Troops forward!

1332
02:10:03,614 --> 02:10:05,374
Rubbish.

1333
02:10:14,174 --> 02:10:15,734
Remove them!

1334
02:10:16,574 --> 02:10:19,934
Come on, get them out.

1335
02:10:21,694 --> 02:10:25,054
This is dictatorship, sir!

1336
02:10:25,054 --> 02:10:28,214
Dictatorship! Dictator!

1337
02:10:28,214 --> 02:10:30,974
Dictatorship!
This is illegal! Come, sir.

1338
02:10:30,974 --> 02:10:34,094
I refuse to quit this chair.
By your leave, sir.

1339
02:10:39,374 --> 02:10:41,134
Away with this bauble!

1340
02:10:51,254 --> 02:10:53,054
I seem to recall

1341
02:10:53,054 --> 02:10:57,134
that we cut off a king's
head...for such as this.

1342
02:11:00,374 --> 02:11:02,134
You are a traitor, sir.

1343
02:11:02,134 --> 02:11:06,494
It is the likes of you who
have turned my hand to this.

1344
02:11:06,494 --> 02:11:10,214
I have sought the Lord's guidance
night and day in this matter.

1345
02:11:10,214 --> 02:11:14,414
It is not idly done, but this
nation will be justly governed.

1346
02:11:30,974 --> 02:11:35,534
I will give this nation back
its self-respect.

1347
02:11:35,534 --> 02:11:40,294
We will walk in this world
with our heads held high.

1348
02:11:40,294 --> 02:11:44,774
I will liberate man's souls
from the darkness of ignorance.

1349
02:11:44,774 --> 02:11:48,494
I will build schools
and universities for all.

1350
02:11:48,494 --> 02:11:52,894
This will become
the golden age of learning.

1351
02:11:52,894 --> 02:11:56,854
I will bring the law within
the reach of every common man.

1352
02:11:56,854 --> 02:12:00,254
There'll be work and bread for all.

1353
02:12:00,254 --> 02:12:05,294
This nation will prosper because it
is a godly nation,

1354
02:12:05,294 --> 02:12:09,254
and because we walk
hand in hand with the Lord!

1355
02:12:24,134 --> 02:12:29,254
I swear by the name of the living
God that I will see this nation

1356
02:12:29,254 --> 02:12:34,454
properly governed,
if I have to do it myself.

1357
02:12:42,254 --> 02:12:45,254
Dear God, give me the strength to

1358
02:12:45,254 --> 02:12:47,534
do it...alone.

1359
02:12:55,574 --> 02:13:00,454
Oliver Cromwell ruled the nation
as Lord Protector for five years.

1360
02:13:00,454 --> 02:13:06,214
In that short time, he raised
England to be a great power, feared
and respected throughout the world.

1361
02:13:06,214 --> 02:13:10,574
Under his hand were laid
the foundations of a
truly democratic nation.

1362
02:13:10,574 --> 02:13:12,494
In 1658, he died.

1363
02:13:12,494 --> 02:13:16,694
Three years later, Charles,
Prince of Wales, was crowned King,

1364
02:13:16,694 --> 02:13:20,054
and a monarch sat once more
upon the throne of England.

1365
02:13:20,054 --> 02:13:22,814
But an England never
to be the same again.

1366
02:13:38,654 --> 02:13:42,974
