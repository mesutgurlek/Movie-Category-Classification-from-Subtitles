Can we have a moment?

488
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:16,072
[Door closes]

489
00:25:16,074 --> 00:25:20,159
I've identified the conserved core sequence

490
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:22,078
in your stabilizers.

491
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,129
You have?

492
00:25:23,164 --> 00:25:25,415
I recognized the same 20-base pair

493
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:26,883
on both sides of the virus.

494
00:25:26,918 --> 00:25:29,919
The odds of that happening
in nature, as we both know,

495
00:25:29,971 --> 00:25:31,721
are next to impossible.

496
00:25:31,756 --> 00:25:36,426
So, I took that as your
brilliant handiwork.

497
00:25:36,428 --> 00:25:38,094
[Chuckles]

498
00:25:38,146 --> 00:25:42,015
Well, you've eliminated a few
trillion possible combinations.

[Chuckles]

500
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,521
Can I ask you something?

501
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:51,324
Yeah.

502
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:55,778
I just think about what you went through,

503
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,780
working to find the cure

504
00:25:57,832 --> 00:26:00,450
and fighting your own infection

505
00:26:00,452 --> 00:26:04,120
and the self-imposed
quarantine on the <i>Vyerni,</i>

506
00:26:04,172 --> 00:26:07,624
literally isolated, with no human contact,

507
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:10,126
in this bubble, and...

508
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:14,881
I guess what I'm asking is...

509
00:26:17,852 --> 00:26:19,552
Do you ever get lonely?

510
00:26:19,604 --> 00:26:22,388
Yeah.

511
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,643
God, I know my situation
isn't nearly as difficult,

512
00:26:26,695 --> 00:26:29,145
but...

513
00:26:29,197 --> 00:26:33,066
There are sometimes on this ship...

514
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:36,536
Well, no one who understands me and this...

515
00:26:36,571 --> 00:26:39,539
Unsolvable puzzle.

516
00:26:39,574 --> 00:26:43,876
And now, being...

517
00:26:43,912 --> 00:26:47,380
So close to the very mind that created it.

518
00:26:55,674 --> 00:26:57,974
Perhaps you were right.

519
00:26:59,678 --> 00:27:04,263
Perhaps my immovable object
is closer than I thought.

[Exhales deeply]

Pardon?

523
00:27:18,913 --> 00:27:21,531
The, um, conserved core element you found,

524
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:24,751
it's the very end of
the stabilizer sequence.

525
00:27:24,786 --> 00:27:28,037
You just go upstream from there,

526
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:31,791
and the entire sequence is yours.

This is it.

537
00:28:19,628 --> 00:28:22,963
So how are you supposed to
signal the bounty hunters?

538
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:32,556
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Come on, I hand this to you,

539
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:34,441
I'm on the next ride back to your ship

540
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:35,976
and you start the party without me.

You can't bench me now.

Watch me!

543
00:28:41,483 --> 00:28:44,234
Now, I don't plan to lose this fight,

but this door opens, and it ain't me,

tell those assholes you shot the flare

and try to collect the bounty.

this war, we need a plan.

653
00:36:08,574 --> 00:36:10,824
First order of business...

654
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:13,660
Show our fellow Americans
that we aren't the bad guys,

655
00:36:13,662 --> 00:36:15,996
despite the lies that
Sean Ramsey's spreading.

656
00:36:15,998 --> 00:36:18,915
Once in New Orleans, we
inoculate the survivors.

657
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:22,252
We make it clear that the
American government is back

658
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:24,221
and that we're on their side.

659
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:30,427
The survivors most likely
are living offshore on boats.

660
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,229
We need an evacuation plan

661
00:36:32,264 --> 00:36:34,648
in case the Ramseys are closing in.

662
00:36:34,683 --> 00:36:38,518
By now, those boats may have
exhausted their fuel supplies,

663
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,356
so I suggest that we stockpile
fuel from local stations...

664
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:46,994
[Helicopter blades whirring in distance]

665
00:36:57,456 --> 00:37:01,925
We got some intel on a
safe zone not far from here.

666
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:08,765
Could be a good place for you
and your people to resettle.

667
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:11,218
Helo's warming up.

668
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,438
I was gonna check it out.

669
00:37:14,473 --> 00:37:16,723
Wanna take a ride?

670
00:37:23,565 --> 00:37:26,233
I knew Cody was amped up to join the fight.

671
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,868
He never would have stayed behind

672
00:37:27,903 --> 00:37:29,903
if I'd gone along like you said.

673
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:35,465
There's an old saying.

674
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:41,915
"Anyone can hold the helm
when the sea is calm."

675
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:47,587
Being a leader is not about being perfect.

676
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:52,843
It's about weathering
the storm and carrying on.

677
00:38:02,438 --> 00:38:05,655
[Voice breaks] I just wanna go home.

678
00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:07,524
I know, son.

679
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,994
[Inhales and exhales deeply]

680
00:38:11,029 --> 00:38:13,780
We all do.

681
00:38:13,782 --> 00:38:16,450
Feel better?

682
00:38:16,452 --> 00:38:18,285
Yes. Thank you.

683
00:38:18,287 --> 00:38:20,120
My arm was really bruising. [Chuckles]

684
00:38:20,122 --> 00:38:23,423
You know, there was much
times on the <i>Vyerni</i>

685
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:26,543
when I thought about a moment like this.

686
00:38:27,963 --> 00:38:29,129
Did you?

687
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,299
Well, I must admit, we're
quite a team, you and I.

688
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,768
A team with cause for celebration.

689
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:37,471
We solved our nebulizing problem.

690
00:38:37,473 --> 00:38:38,772
Yes. Well, I mean,

691
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:41,274
we still need to find a factory somewhere

692
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,276
we can mass-produce the powder.

693
00:38:43,312 --> 00:38:44,978
And we need planes, lots
of planes. [Rats squeaking]

694
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,614
You know, I always wanted
to get my pilot's license.

695
00:38:47,649 --> 00:38:50,734
Actually, we don't have
need for any of that...

696
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,953
No planes,

697
00:38:52,988 --> 00:38:54,154
no factories,

698
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,622
no powder even.

699
00:38:55,657 --> 00:38:56,907
I don't understand.

700
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,625
How do you want to spread the vaccine?

701
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,627
Well, if you think about it,

702
00:39:00,662 --> 00:39:03,046
you were able to kill 5 billion people

703
00:39:03,081 --> 00:39:05,582
- simply by breathing.
- I...

704
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,801
So the key to transmission lies within you.

705
00:39:07,836 --> 00:39:10,587
If I could teach healthy lungs

706
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,973
to hold and reproduce the cure

707
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:16,343
the same way yours do with the
virus, well, then I could...

708
00:39:16,345 --> 00:39:18,829
You could make the cure contagious.

709
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:20,332
Of course, the trick would be

710
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:22,334
understanding just how your body does it,

711
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:24,753
to be able to compare
the D.N.A. sequence change

712
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:26,371
between yours and the primordial.

713
00:39:26,423 --> 00:39:27,673
[Rats squeak]

714
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:29,207
You have my blood samples.

715
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:30,959
I do. [Sets down box]

716
00:39:31,011 --> 00:39:32,794
The problem is, is the virus.

717
00:39:32,846 --> 00:39:36,381
It resides exclusively in
your lungs, as we both know.

718
00:39:36,383 --> 00:39:38,550
That's the reason why it's so contagious.

719
00:39:38,602 --> 00:39:41,053
So, what do we do? You
wanna to take a biopsy?

720
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:42,387
No. No, no. No.

721
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:44,473
See, that wouldn't
work, because it's likely

722
00:39:44,525 --> 00:39:46,692
in the deepest recesses of your lungs,

723
00:39:46,727 --> 00:39:50,395
mixed in with thousands
of other innocuous viruses,

724
00:39:50,447 --> 00:39:52,981
so what I'm gonna need to do is

725
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:55,400
just flush out the poisonous one.

726
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:58,970
- Flush it out? How?
- Well, you remember

727
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:01,422
those brilliant little D.N.A. scissors?

728
00:40:01,474 --> 00:40:04,127
Well, they're not only
capable of adding a gene.

729
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:05,413
They can also remove one.

730
00:40:05,498 --> 00:40:08,332
So I'm gonna undo what you did.

731
00:40:08,368 --> 00:40:10,584
I'm gonna separate your gene

732
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,672
from the virus inside your body.

733
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:17,958
[Laughs] I'm sorry, but
that would never work.

734
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:19,677
[Gloves snap] Well, yes, actually it will,

735
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,713
if they have identical stability
sequences on either side,

736
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:24,932
and...

737
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:26,851
[Sighs deeply]

738
00:40:26,886 --> 00:40:29,970
You gave me yours.

739
00:40:30,023 --> 00:40:33,140
That would kill me.

740
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:34,558
The gene would be liberated,

741
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,894
and the virus would
explode out of your lungs

742
00:40:36,946 --> 00:40:38,696
and into the rest of your body,

743
00:40:38,731 --> 00:40:40,147
and, well...

744
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:42,116
[Chuckles]

745
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:44,869
There's just so much of it.

746
00:40:46,406 --> 00:40:48,572
If you think I would just allow you to...

747
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:51,075
I mean, you are completely insane!

748
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:53,961
I've already done it, Niels.

749
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:57,415
The virus is doing its work as we speak.

750
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,426
[Equipment clatters]

751
00:41:08,428 --> 00:41:09,760
[Niels grunting]

752
00:41:09,762 --> 00:41:11,178
O'Connor: What's going on in there?

753
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,765
The people on this ship
will sleep better tonight,

754
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:17,268
knowing that it died with you.

755
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,769
Miller: Dr. Scott, are you all right?

756
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:20,237
I helped you.

757
00:41:20,273 --> 00:41:21,906
Yes, you did.

758
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:27,445
- Miller: Dr. Scott!
- You're gonna help all of us.
