I just met one of the more recent burials.

321
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,847
Recent burials?
What are you talking about?

322
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:30,177
I'm not going back down there.

323
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:47,422
Rocca, this tunneling is going too slowly.
We've only got three days left.

324
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,935
We'll be inside in time.

325
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:53,739
Well, the margin's too close.
This mission is not going to fail, hear me?

326
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,275
- We'll tunnel around the clock.
- ROCCA: The curfew.

327

If any of us are
discovered out after dark...

328
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:03,478
- Yeah, well, I'll take that risk.
- You'll take it without me.

329
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,010
You'll do what I tell you.

330
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,589
I will work.

331
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:15,193
And Svetlana.

332
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,090
How much longer?

333
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,592
No more.

334
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:49,752
Yes, I will do my share.

335
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,854
I said no more.

336

How gentle you can sometimes be.

They've picked up Petar.

344
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:27,826
- When?
- I saw them in the street,

345
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:29,628
just after I left the cemetery.

346
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:31,163
Can he be trusted?

347
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:32,498
MARKO: He can be trusted.

348
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:35,567
But if he is tortured, who knows?

349
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:38,938
ROCCA: We'll have to suspend
the operation until we're sure.

350
00:35:39,038 --> 00:35:43,301
And if Petar talks,
it will have to be abandoned.

351
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:45,441
Abandoned?

352
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:47,810
Abandoned?

353
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,117
This mission will be abandoned
only when all six of us are dead!

What's driving you, Mace?

357
00:35:57,523 --> 00:35:59,792
This is no mission with you,
it's a personal crusade!

358
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:02,161
Now, you listen to me.
My brother didn't give up his life...

359
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:04,330
- Your brother?
...so some yellow little...

360
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,398
What about your brother?

361
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:12,833
Well, I'll tell you.

362
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:18,177
I was in command
of Balkan Intelligence in 1942.

363
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:21,110
My brother was an officer
under my command.

364
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,817
He was captured
and placed in Dubrovnik Fortress.

365
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,612
What blame to you?

366
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,321
There was certain information
I wanted from inside.

367
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,124
He managed to find a way
to get it out to me.

368
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:33,623
I ask again.

369
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,890
What fault was yours?

370
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,326
I waited too long before getting him out.

371
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:42,201
So we're expected to buy your honor,
your vengeance

372
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:44,737
and your military reputation?

373
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:47,067
Why did they bust you, Major?

374
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:50,965
Yes, it's true.

375
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:53,809
They relieved me of my command.

376
00:36:54,113 --> 00:36:55,603
I couldn't...

377
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:59,646
Couldn't carry on for a while.

378
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:22,307
It's as much our mission as yours now.

379
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,320
I agree that it's urgent.

380
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,514
Petar may want to be loyal,
but not be able to.

381
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,460
Can your people create a diversion for us?

382
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,162
Blow up a gun or a guard post,

383
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:46,665
anything to cover the sound
of an explosion within the tomb?

384
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,996
- It will be done.
- We must get to the tomb at once.

385
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:53,038
Scanlon might be able
to open an entrance to the drain

386
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,940
without attracting attention.

387
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,242
Someone must take explosives to him.

388
00:37:57,342 --> 00:38:00,579
It's almost curfew.
We can't risk the streets.

389
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:03,671
I'll go, with the baby.

390
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:06,817
If I am stopped,
I'll say he was taken ill.

391
