1
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,878
(Big Ben chimes)

2
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,749
Miss Paget, do you want to go back to Malaya?
After what happened there?

3
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,070
<i>It's because of what happened there</i>

4
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,312
What good will it do you?
Won't you be only torturing yourself?

5
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,556
No.

6
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,478
Now I've come into this money,
I've thought of all the things I can do with it.

7
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,790
<i>There's only one thing I really want to do</i>

8
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,836
And I must do it.

9
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,356
I'm going back to the village in Malaya
where they took us in,

10
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,715
where we lived for three years of the war.

11
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,110
Those people risked everything they had
to protect us.

12
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,156
Now at last,

13
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,196
something I can do to pay them back.

14
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,033
No need to go in person.
I could transmit a sum of money to them.

15
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,475
No, I don't want to do it like that.

16
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,277
I want to go back there myself and give them
the one thing I know they really need.

17
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,756
I want to go back to dig a well.

18
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,952
- Jean!
- Oh, Fatima!

19
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,395
Jean, you've come back to us at last.

20
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,956
It works!

21
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,998
Of course it works!
When I dig a well, it always works.

22
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,036
(Speaks Malay)

23
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,196
(Shouts of excitement)

24
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,596
(Laughter)

25
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,116
(Drum beats)

26
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,716
(Other instruments join in)

27
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,156
Jean.

28
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,596
The well-it's finished.

29
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,636
Yes, it's finished.

30
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,676
And now you will leave us again.

31
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,716
What will you do, Jean?

32
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,597
Oh...

33
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,636
I don't know.

34
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,676
Perhaps you will get married.

35
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,716
(Firmly) No.

36
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,836
No.

37
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,876
<i>(Thinks) No I shan't get married</i>

38
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,315
<i>I shall never get married not now</i>

39
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,473
<i>Not after all that's happened
since the day that changed my whole life</i>

40
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,915
<i>That day in Kuala Lumpur in 1942</i>

41
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,872
<i>And if the telephone hadn't rung
If only I hadn't stopped to pick it up</i>

42
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,918
Pay attention, everybody.
I've got something to say.

43
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,037
You've all been told what to do
in a state of emergency.

44
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,476
Well, this is it.
Get on the first train you can to Singapore.

45
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,189
When you get there, report to head office.
Passages have been arranged for England.

46
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,157
(Astonished murmurs)

47
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,597
Please be quiet. The Japanese
are at Tanjung Malim, 50 miles from here.

48
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,638
Special trains have been arranged
for evacuees, so get out quick.

49
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,950
That's all. Goodbye.

50
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,632
You too, Jean.
Just drop everything and get out.

51
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,235
What about Mrs Holland and the children?
I thought the car was in dock.

52
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,073
I'm going to get it.
Get on the first train you can.

53
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,593
Fight your way on if necessary.

54
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,148
See you in Singapore.
Good luck and goodbye.

55
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,196
Goodbye, Mr Holland.

56
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,948
(Rings)

57
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,589
- The phone.
- Don't bother about the phone now. Come on!

58
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,514
(Phone continues ringing)
I'll catch you up.

59
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,156
- Hello. Who's that?
- Oh, come on!

60
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,196
You go on. I won't be a minute.

61
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,430
<i>- Hello? 
- Oh, Mrs Holland. He's just gone.</i>

62
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,318
<i>I've been trying to get the office
for ten minutes Where is he? </i>

63
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,118
He's gone to get the car.

64
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,158
The servants have all gone
and I've got no help at all.

65
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,196
Jane, please go away.

66
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,317
- Mummy, the baby's crying!
- I know. Go and get your things.

67
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,436
I can't manage the children on my own,

68
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,476
and pack at the same time.

69
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,516
(Line goes dead)
What?

70
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,556
Hello?

71
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,596
Hello?

72
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,636
Hello?

73
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,676
(Car engine splutters)

74
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,676
Here, let me have a try.

75
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,716
(Engine fails to start)

76
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,356
Haven't you got a car I could hire?

77
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,396
All cars gone.

78
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,948
- Haven't you got anything at all?
- All gone.

79
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,476
(Aeroplane roars overhead)

80
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,556
I wish he'd come. I wish he'd come!

81
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,356
Can I take my rocking horse?

82
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,079
No, darling,
we can only take what we can carry.

83
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,038
- Take Bunty.
- No, I want my rocking horse.

84
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,196
<i>I don't want Bunty I want my rocking horse</i>

85
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,794
I'll put the baby's things in this suitcase here.

86
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,758
Jean, he couldn't be so long getting the car.

87
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,434
I expect it's difficult
getting repairs done today.

88
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,193
But he's been hours!
Something must have happened.

89
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,508
(Baby cries)

90
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,875
(Gunfire)

91
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,836
(Firing continues)

92
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,595
Did you hear that? It was guns.

93
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,638
They must be blowing up the bridges.

94
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,032
(Car horn hoots)

95
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,796
Daddy!

96
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,836
Are you ready, darling?

97
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,876
What are you doing here, Jean?

98
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,190
I came to give your wife a hand, Mr Holland.

99
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,316
Now you're back, I can go and get the train.

100
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,675
You can't. There's no transport running.

101
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,070
- I'll get a lift somehow.
- No, you're in with us. All set, Eileen?

102
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,470
- I'll be ready in a minute.
- You are ready. Drop everything.

103
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,074
One suitcase each.

104
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,596
Come on, Jane.

105
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,636
- Quick, Jane.
- Come on.

106
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,276
(Engine splutters)

107
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,676
(Engine revives)

108
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,990
Phew!

109
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,991
(Engine rattles)

110
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,036
(Engine cuts out)

111
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,276
That blasted mechanic.

112
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,436
Shall I start it, Dad?

113
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,476
I'll give you the word.

114
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,754
Try her now.

115
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,116
(Engine splutters)

116
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,716
Try her again.

117
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,594
(Engine splutters)

118
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,474
(Distant gunfire)

119
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,516
(Firing continues)

120
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,670
Well, THAT'S not blowing up bridges.

121
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,591
You'd better get out.

122
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,636
Freddie, try her again.

123
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,676
(Engine splutters)

124
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,275
How far have we come?

125
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,954
- About 5 or 6 miles.
- But Panong's 50, isn't it?

126
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,996
Just about.

127
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,554
(Distant vehicle approaches)

128
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,150
In the ditch, quick! Come on, Freddie!

129
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,756
- Daddy...
- Ssh!

130
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,836
(Vehicle passes by)

131
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,876
(Vehicle stops nearby)

132
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,797
(Baby cries)

133
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,440
(Footsteps approach)

134
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,919
Stopped for a picnic?

135
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,718
Our car's broken down.

136
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,392
It's a fine time for that. Come on.

137
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,153
- We're making for Panong.
- You're in luck. Hop in.

138
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,071
Move up inside. There's five more to come.

139
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,390
There's my teacher, Miss Horsefall.

140
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,595
Hello, Freddie.

141
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,717
Come in, Mrs Holland.
Freddie, you'll find Timothy in there.

142
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,395
I'm sorry, sir, the Japs mustn't get your car.
I'll have to burn it.

143
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,436
Driver, pull up 50 yards.

144
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,278
I've got 35 for you, sir.

145
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,032
16 women, 12 men and 7 children.

146
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,953
35?
Well, shove 'em in the accounts office, please.

147
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,158
Driver, take them round the accounts office
and tell them not to wander about.

148
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,916
I can get them away in fishing boats.

149
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,958
What about the launch, the Osprey?
She's due back this evening.

150
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,032
She won't be back here, not now.
It's fishing boats or nothing.

151
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,036
That's the accounts office in there.

152
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,196
Dad, can we go in the garden, please?

153
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,955
You can play with the other children,
but don't make too much noise.

154
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,428
Jean, can I have something
to wipe his face?

155
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,317
- Pass me the suitcase.
- This one?

156
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,510
I suppose you haven't got such a thing
as a cigarette, have you?

157
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,513
Come on, Arthur.
Don't let everyone push you around.

158
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,118
I beg your pardon?

159
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,396
That is not a camp stool.

160
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,278
Old bag.

161

00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,319
Oh, this is to stimulate my appetite.

330
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,437
I'll take this for the children
and come back for mine.

331
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,080
Jean... do something for me.

332
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,232
Speak to Mrs Frith.
She mustn't get away with it.

333
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,194
I know what you want, but I'm a sick woman.
I'm under doctor's orders.

334
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,635
It's a miracle I've got as far as this.

335
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,315
Come on, Mrs Frith,
we must share our medicines.

336
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,996
You can keep your special ones.

337
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,038
- I'll just take the quinine and the codeine.
- May God forgive you.

338
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,678
You'll be all right.

339
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,716
You'll be sorry when I'm dead.

340
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,916
Timothy.

341
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,592
Come here.

342
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,671
You can look after poor Timothy.

343
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,716
Well, I'd like to...

344
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,712
I'm so sorry, I simply haven't the strength.

345
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,595
You can look after each other.

346
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,116
Why you not march?

347
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,957
Very bad thing.

348
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,635
Can we please have a truck to Kuala Lumpur?

349
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,756
You not go Kuala Lumpur. No railroad.

350
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,717
British destroy bridges.

351
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,030
You go Port Swettenham. That way.

352
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,756
Then ship take you Singapore.

353
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,070
But it's nearly 50 miles to Port Swettenham!

354
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,076
How are we going to get there?

355
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,478
- Walk?
- Yes, walk.

356
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,233
One bit each day. You get there very quick.

357
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,276

Jean...

362
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,836
Let me see him.

363
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,676
Robin's really taken to you.

364
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,357
Poor boy.

365
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,396
<i>I had such a bad time with him</i>

366

<i>I've never been strong since</i>

367
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,958
You'll be all right.

370

They're in God's hands now.

371
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,636
And yours.

372
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,630
Why don't you eat your supper, Freddie?

376

No good.

377
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,916
You can have these, too.

378
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,558

379
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,437
- No.
- Cigarettes?

- No.
- Anything else?

381

Nothing.

382
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,920
I must have some milk for the baby.

383
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,230
Tinned milk or powdered milk, anything.

384

- From Kuala Panong.
- Did you hear that, Ben?

That's a pretty rough deal. How do you get on
for tuck if you haven't got a camp?

00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,112
I'll watch 'em from here.

492
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,276
- OK?
- OK.

493
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,876
- You want a fag?
- Oh.

494
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,392
It's a Jappo.

495
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,878
Ta.

496
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,478
(Squealing)

497
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,876
(Squealing continues)

498
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,078
Good night.

499
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,912
(Speaks Japanese)

500
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,429
No, I don't come from Sydney.
I work in the Northern Territory.

501
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,353
A place called Willstown,
to the east of the Alice.

502
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,998
I'm a stockman.

503
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,638
Alice?

504
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,278
Yeah, Alice Springs.

505
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,636
It's a town dead in the centre
between Darwin and Adelaide.

506
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,393
I thought the middle of Australia
was all desert.

507
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,038
My word, no.

508
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,079
No, the Alice is beaut. You get three meals
a day there every day. You'd like it.

509
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,718
Would I.

510
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,756
But your place, is it a sheep farm?

511
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,592
No, it's too hot for sheep.

512
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,432
Cattle. About 18,000 head.

513
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,078
It sounds a big place.

514
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,718
Mm. 2,700.

515
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,358
Acres?

516
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,998
No, square miles.

517
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,310
- On one farm?
- Well, station, you know.

518
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,675
Well, how many men do you take to run it?

519
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,194
Well, about three, and about nine boongs.

520
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,838
What is this boong?

521
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,515
It's an Aussie word, boong.
It means gippo, Abo, black fellow.

522
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:29,071
You can't get white fellows to work there.
It's about 60 miles to the nearest homestead.

523
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,720
- It must be lonely.
- Yes, it is...

524
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,552
...for women.

525
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,036
I suppose you've got to be born to it.

526
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,232
But you'd like the Alice.

527
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,276
It's beaut there. It's...

528
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,518
Well, the... country's all red
and the... mountains are red.

529
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,358
And... in the evening, sometimes,
it all goes kind of purple.

530
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,436
Of course, after the wet, it's green.

531
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,272
It's all right.

532
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,434
I suppose everybody likes their own place,
and the Alice is my place.

533
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,916
Where does he come from, this Joe?

534
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,517
He talked about... a town called Alice.

535
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,792
He made it sound...

536
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,236
...all right.

537
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,472
<i>No ship for you here! 
You go Port Dickson that way</i>

538
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,276
(Thunder crashes)

539
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,035
<i>So sorry No food for persons here</i>

540
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,917
<i>You must go Tampin That way.</i>

541
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,238
(Officers shout in Japanese)

542
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,236
We've got one of these at home.

543
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,878
So have we.

544
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,518
So have we, too.

545
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,798
I found it first!

546
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,075
My dear, I'd already seen it from the corridor.

547
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,196
<i>I got here first and I'm staying here</i>

548
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,838
<i>I'm tired and I'm fed up</i>

549
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,354
<i>MRS DUDLEY FROST: We're all tired</i>

550
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,396
In any case, I'm older.

551
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,436
I wouldn't dispute THAT.

552
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,278
Oh, one of these days!

553
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,918
<i>What is it? </i>

554
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,956
Nothing.

555
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,756
I was just wondering
just how long one can go on, that's all.

556
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,358
<i>EBBEY: Quick quick! </i>

557
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,116
<i>Down the corridor! Come on hurry! 
You'll never believe it! It works! </i>

558
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,156
<i>It's working Come on! </i>

559
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,798
<i>It's working Come on! </i>

560
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,836
<i>Hurry hurry! </i>

561
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,836
I just turned on the tap and it worked.

562
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,876
(Squeals of delight)

563
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,751
Now we can have a bath, girls!

564
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,475
(Laughter)

565
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,118
(Baby cries)

566
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,552
Thank you.

567
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,911
Soap, please.

568
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,231
Now, darling, don't cry. Come on.

569
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,993
There we are. Come on, lie down.

570
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,719
Lie down. There's a good boy.
I'll be back in a minute.

571
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,598
Stop it, Timothy. Stop it!

572
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,596
Wait for me! Wait for me! I'm coming!

573
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,756
(Groans)

574
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,676
(Makes aeroplane noise)

575
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,271
Look, Marzy. Bananas.

576
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,311
(Makes aeroplane noise)

577

Freddie, what is it? What's happened?

00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,518
Freddie, what is it?

586
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,238
What is it? What's the matter?

Come along, dear.

00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,992
We'll go for a walk.

I'm sorry, I can't have you here.

No rations.

Tonight you will stay in school.
Tomorrow you must go elsewhere.

You've got to understand.

01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:05,229
We've been walking for four months.
Four months, this way and that way.

01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,551
Nobody taking any responsibility for us.
Nobody caring.

607
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,596
Four of us have died already.

608
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,272
Now this little boy.

609
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,754
We must get to Singapore, or we shall all die.

Haven't you any ships?

For Singapore?

613

Well, the ships go to Singapore, yes.

614
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,996
Thank God.

615

When can you send us?

616
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,276
Tomorrow?

617
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,192
Can we go tomorrow?

618
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,316
You stay tonight in the schoolhouse.

619
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,118
Tomorrow we see.

620
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,074

01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,389
No, you.

You got very nice baby.

623
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,796
He's not mine. His mother's dead.

624
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,836
I'm taking him to Singapore.

625
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,356
I have order.
No more prisoners to go to Singapore.

626
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,192
Strict order. Very sorry.

627
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,952
What can we do? Can we stay here?

628
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,598
You stay tonight, yes.

629
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,238
But no longer?

630
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,436
Sorry, Malay children need this school.

631
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,272
Can we build our own camp?
We won't ask you for anything.

632
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,918
Except food.

633
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,752
No food here for prisoners.

634
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,796
No, you go to prison camp.

635
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,156
You go to prison camp at Kuantan.

636
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,718
Kuant...

637
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,756
But that's on the east coast.

638
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,150
That's on the other side of Malaya.
Nearly 200 miles!

639
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,958
OK, 200 miles.

640
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,998
But how do we get there? By rail, by truck?

Go on, shoot us! Women and babies!

649

- No.

650
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,672
All right, Captain.

651
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,030
We will walk to Kuantan.

652
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,076
Come here! Come here, please.

653
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,632
200 miles.

654
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,915
Yes, that is very far with a baby.

655
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,638
I make other arrangement.

656
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,358
You could send us by truck?

657
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,398
No, you stay here. I make good arrangement.

658
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,710
You stay good house, English house.

659
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,438
All of us, you mean?

660
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,078
Others walk Kuantan.

661
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,116
<i>You stay</i>

662
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,156
<i>You keep baby if you want</i>

663
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,309
Japanese soldiers very kind to women.

664
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,356
You will be very happy.

665
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,232
Come back! Come back!

666
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,556
You, come here.

667
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,632
Kuantan...

668
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,472
that's 200 miles.

669
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,516
We'll never get over the mountains.

670
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,352
Oh, yes, we will.

671
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,196

674
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,718
I think it's the carb.

675
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,552
BEN: Yeah, it must be.

676
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,876
Thank you.

677
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,678

678
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,318
Jean!

679

<i>Jean! </i>

680
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:35,910
Jean, where have you been? I thought
you were going to Port Swettenham.

681
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,558
<i>Where have you been? </i>

682
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,108
Joe, they keep moving us on,
they won't let us stop.

683
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,430
They say there's no camp for us anywhere.

684
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,397
(Shouts in Japanese)

685

- Joe, go back.
- (Shouts in Japanese)

686
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,509
- Can I get anything for you? For the kids?
- Joe, go back!

687
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,158
BEN: They mean business.

688
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,152
We'll be all right. Please go, you'll be killed!

689
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,193
Where are you bound for?

690
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,350
- Kuantan.
- Our camp's at Kuantan!

691
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,398
We're up and down that road every week!
I'll find you!

692
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,755
(Guards shout)

693
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,278
I... can't...

694
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,918
I... can't...

695
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,558
Ebbey!

696
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,596
Gunso.

697
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,032
Come along, dear.

698
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,678
Come along.

699
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,716
- I can't.
- Try.

700
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,756
Try.

701
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,078
Come along.

702
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,348
Jean, you've been giving Jane quinine.

703
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,112
I want some for Brenda.

704
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,836
You know there's been none for a week.

705
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,273
I saw you giving it to her!

706
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,992
<i>Does she look like it? </i>

707
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,955
We must go on.
We must get out of the swamps.

708
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,751
How is she, Mrs Frost?

709
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,632
She can't go any further.

710
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,112
We'll rest here till daylight.

711
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,037
There, darling. Have a little rest.

712
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,076
Isn't there any drinking water?

713
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,116
Not till we boil some.

714
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,838
Jean.

715
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,912
Poor little Jane.

716
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,276
(Sobs)

717
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,718
MRS RHODES:
* There's a friend for little children

718
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,839
* Above the bright blue sky

719
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,879
* A friend who never changes

720
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,316
* Whose love will never die

721
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,075
* Our earthly friends may fail us

722
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,630
* And change with changing years

723
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,554
* This friend is always worthy

724
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:34,235
* Of that dear name he bears

725
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,992
Hey, look!

726
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,832
Look.

727
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,672
It's them!

728
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,912
How many?

729
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,956
One, two...

730
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,792
three, four, five, six...

731
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,711
BEN: There she is, the one with the baby.

732
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,112
(Horn beeps)

733
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,276
OK for Operation Breakdown?

734
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,956
Yeah.

735
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,318
"Dear Mrs Boong..."

736
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,992
Who's Mrs Boong?

737
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,672
(Distant horn beeps)

738
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,278
What's it like?

739
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,918
- What, Southampton?
- Yeah.

740
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,752
Oh, docks and ships.

741
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,751
The countryside's green and cool.

742
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,756
I've had enough of heat and sun and fever.

743
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,398
You're not kidding!

744
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,040
There's an ice rink there. I used to skate a lot.

745
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,553
I could waltz.

746
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,119
What, on ice?

747
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,758
I'd like to have seen that.

748
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,070
What did you do in Kuala Lumpur?

749
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,310
Oh, just a secretary. Nothing special.

750
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,358
Look...

751
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,510
Your feed tomorrow, what will you get?

752
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,632
We may be lucky tomorrow.

753
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,280
We'll be all right when we get to Kuantan,

754
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,918
to a real prison camp.

755
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,878
- In Kuantan?
- Yes, there's one there, isn't there?

756
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,518
Sure... yes.

757
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,955
I wouldn't know. Yeah, you'll be all right there.

758
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,919
I can get a couple of chickens and
drop 'em off when we come back upcountry.

759
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,956
Joe, I wouldn't like you to do that.

760
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,589
You attend to your business, Mrs Boong,
and I'll attend to mine.

761
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,070
Take everything you can get.
The prisoner's motto... and mine.

762
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,116
Please don't take risks for us.

763
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:50,239
Anybody can run rings round the Japs,
as long as you know how to scrounge.

01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,158
<i>All clear? </i>

765
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,196
Just a minute.

766
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,791
OK.

767
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,398
One other thing.

768
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,232
Mr Boong, did he get away?

769
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,232
There's no Mr Boong, Joe.

770
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,036
Here.

771
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,672
Thanks, mate.

772
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,031
* Wrap me up with my stockwhip and blanket

773
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:38,998
* And bury me deep down below

774

* Where the dingoes and crows
can't molest me

For once I agree with him. Take it easy!

782
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,398
OK, sweetie.

783
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,357
That goes for you too, Colonel.

784
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,636
All right, then. How do we celebrate?

785
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,676
Feed 'em chicken and champagne?

786
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,433
- Just chicken.
- Just chicken... Just chicken?!

787
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,080

No.

* Far over these plains I would fly

* And I'd fly to the arms of my loved one

- One.
- When did he go?

...and we shared a cigarette.

01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:50,752
And the time when he...
talked about a town called Alice.

967
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:13,230
(Jean speaks Malay)

968
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,151
As there is no man to speak for us,

969
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:18,391
forgive me if I ask you
to talk business with a woman.

972
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:32,395
We have walked for many hundreds of miles.

973
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,710
And no Japanese officer will take us in,

974
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,314
or feed us, or look after us when we're sick.

975
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:44,037
So for months we've marched
from town to town.

976
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:46,793
And in that time,
more than half of us have died.

977
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,632
Now our guard is dead.

978
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:55,793
If we go on till we find another
Japanese officer, he won't want us either.

979
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:59,589
He'll send us on again,
and we shall grow ill, and we shall all die.

980

It is written that the angels said,
"Every soul shall taste of death."

"If you be kind towards women,
God is well acquainted with what you do"?

01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,710
To work in the rice field as your women do.

991
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,199
To work...

992
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:36,510
just for our food and somewhere to sleep.

993
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:39,273
White women have never worked
in the rice field.

994
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,999
White women have never marched
till they died.

995
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,032
We have little food,

996
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:46,678
little water.

997
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:50,196
Our young men have been taken
to work for the Japanese.

998
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:53,236
We will grow more food for everyone.

999
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:57,073
If I let you stay here,

1000
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:59,310
the Japanese might be angry.

1001
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,436
They might punish us,

1002
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,476
kill us.

1003
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,836
If you say we must go, we must go.

1004
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,837
We are in your hands.

1005
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:50,908
Oh, this'll be bad for my rheumatism!

1006
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,752
<i>I won't last long like this</i>

1007
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:55,070
You're the toughest of us all, Mrs Frith!

1008
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:58,152
You've lasted this far, you'll last for ever.

1009
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,272
Too much? Too heavy?

1010
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,238
I've told you before,
if a Malay can do it, I can do it.

1011
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,072
Come on, load me up.

1012
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,799
It isn't the first time I've been called horsey.

1013
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,874
(Counts to four in Malay)

1014
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:32,559
* London Bridge is falling down

1015
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:34,915
* Falling down, falling down

1016
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,070
* London Bridge is falling down

1017
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:39,515
* My fair lady

1018
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,591
* Let us build it up again

1019
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:43,830
* Up again, up again

1020
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:46,070
* Let us build it up again

1021
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:48,116
* My fair lady

1022
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,156
(Singing continues)

1023
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:53,438
<i>Hello Robin! </i>

1024
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:57,276
<i>(Thinks) Dear Robin</i>

1025
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:03,236
<i>For three years as the rice was sown and
harvested and sown and harvested again</i>

1026
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:06,555
<i>I looked after you and watched you grow</i>

1027
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:11,516
<i>And when the war ended
and I gave you back to your father</i>

1028
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,556
<i>it was like losing my own child</i>

1029
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:15,596
(Pipes and drums play)

1030
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:26,433
The water's good, Suleiman.
You have done well.

1031
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,476
Good. Now I must go back to my home.

1032
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,630
- Where's that?
- Kuantan

1033
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,718
Kuantan?

1034
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:37,076
<i>Very bad Japanese man in Kuantan
during the war</i>

1035
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:39,230
Captain Sugaya. Many bad things done.

1036
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,992
Many evil things.

1037
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:46,198
Suleiman...

1038
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,838
I was in Kuantan.

1039
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,478
When we were starving...

1040
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:53,312
...a prisoner stole some food for us.

1041
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,072
Captain Sugaya crucified him.

1042
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:59,311
I remember that.
He was a long time in hospital.

1043
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,638
But he died!

1044
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:09,597
How could he be in hospital?

1045
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:11,636
My son shall tell you.

1046
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:16,475
Jacob! The Australian soldier
who was crucified during the war.

1047
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,312
Did he die?

1048
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,277
He went to hospital.

1049
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,679
What?

1050
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:24,512
Jacob, come here.

1051
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,434
Tell Miss Jean if that man...
Did he live or did he die?

1052
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:33,790
Captain Sugaya ordered him
to be taken down that night.

1053
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:36,713
<i>The guards were good
They took him to hospital</i>

1054
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,756
<i>He lived</i>

1055
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:47,712
What is it, Jean?

1056
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,349
Oh, please help me!
Please help me to find him!

1057
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:56,035
I must know if he lived,
if he's alive, if he got home.

1058
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,751
You seem to have everything here.

1059
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:33,877
Sure. We've got a picture theatre
and a swimming pool.

1060
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:36,190
And two hotels, and another one going up.

1061
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:37,918
Alice is a beaut.

1062
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,752
There's your man.

1063
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,311
Hey, mate!

1064
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,072
Hello, Dave.

1065
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:57,718
I want you to meet Miss Paget.

1066
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:01,076
This is Jack Burns, Shell agent.
He's been here for 25 years.

1067
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:04,232
- He knows everybody.
- Hello, Miss Paget. Pleased to meet you.

1068
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,880
- Do you know a Joe...
- You're from England.

1069
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,509
- I've folks in Wolverhampton. Is that near you?
- About 200 miles away.

1070
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:14,354
- You know the Fletchers in Wolverhampton?
- Wolverhampton's a big place.

1071
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:17,193
Yes, I suppose so. What was it you wanted?

1072
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:20,111
Did you ever know a Joe Harman?

1073
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:21,952
Joe? Yeah, I knew him.

1074
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:23,917
Did he come home after the war?

1075
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,357
Sure. He took up his old position
as manager over at Willstown, out in the bush.

1076
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,396
He took his family with him, I suppose?

1077
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,232
I didn't know Joe was married.

1078
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,470
Oh, perhaps I got it wrong. Engaged?

1079
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:37,120
Could be. I never heard of it. You, Dave?

1080
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:38,758
<i>No</i>

1081
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,592
How do I get to Willstown?

1082
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:44,148
Eddie Connellan flies the mail out once a week.

1083
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:45,798
But it's a cow of a place.

1084
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:16,638
G'day, Dave.

1085
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:20,315
Hi, Sam. For Daphne Campbell.
Her shoes will be ready next week.

1086
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:25,030
I'm going across to Miller's now.
I'll be back this evening. I'll bring the beer then.

1087
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:27,998
This is Miss Paget.
She wants to get into Willstown.

1088
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:32,517
That's something new. Most people want
to get out of it. Get inside, Miss Paget.

1089
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:36,832
It don't take a minute to get into Willstown,
get through it and get out of it.

1090
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:53,232
It's all yours.

1091
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,152
Where can I find Joe Harman?

1092
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:01,798
Joe?

1093
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,836
- Yes. Is he around?
- He's not here.

1094
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,478
<i>He's gone off</i>

1095
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,516
<i>- Where to?
- He didn't say</i>

1096
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:09,636
<i>He's left the country I do know that</i>

1097
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:11,756
<i>He's been gone for a couple of months</i>

1098
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,990
Well, when's he due back?

1099
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:17,152
He don't write.
If he thinks as I do about Willstown,

1100
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:18,992
he'll NEVER come back.

1101
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:20,832
It's a fair cow, isn't it?

1102
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:24,270
Yes, it's a fair cow.

1103
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,879
Miss Paget and I don't know each other
very well. We never had much of a chance.

1104
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:34,633
- You know what happened.
- Are you all right now?

1105
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:36,278
I'm fine.

1106
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:39,909
Last time I saw her, she was dressed up
like a native with a sarong.

1107
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,911
<i>I don't remember much about it</i>

1108
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,672
<i>They were beating her up</i>

1109
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:46,472
Mr Harman, I've got some news for you.

1110
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,677
<i>You've come across the world to England
to look for her</i>

1111
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,318
That's right.

1112
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:54,949
Well, she's gone across the world to Australia
to look for you.

1113
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:58,995
Hey!

1114
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,036
(Aeroplane flies overhead)

1115
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:19,995
<i>TANNOY: Announcing the arrival of Trans
Australia Airways flight 571 from Darwin</i>

01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:24,076
(Tyres screech)

1117
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:45,112
(Aeroplane approaches)

1118
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:37,997
G'day, Paul. I'm going on with Eddie Connellan
to Willstown. Any messages for me?

1119
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,638
- No. Sorry, Joe.
- Are you sure?

1120
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:41,676
<i>No nothing</i>

1121
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:45,598
Joe.

1122
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:56,798
Oh, Joe.
