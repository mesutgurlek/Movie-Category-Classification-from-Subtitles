we developed these big brains,

So we got used to being
at the top of the food chain,

but once you step
in that saltwater,

446
00:27:29,637 --> 00:27:32,482
right back to the bottom
of the food chain.

447

we look pathetic to sharks.

everywhere

They only announce
the not-guilty verdicts.

1573

Charlie,
I want you to know,

1579
01:48:35,841 --> 01:48:37,697
I'd rather this
played out differently.

1580
01:48:55,457 --> 01:48:58,141
Hundreds of ships
were sunk during the war,

01:48:58,176 --> 01:49:00,894

court-martial?

Thank you.

naval disaster in history?</i>

1589
01:49:17,632 --> 01:49:20,929

- Is it true you were denied your choice of an attorney?

(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

1591

This would never happen

If the roles were reversed,

1593

you would not be called in

We were there.

1597
01:49:59,649 --> 01:50:02,911
As a commander
in the Imperial Japanese Navy,

1598
01:50:02,946 --> 01:50:05,538
it was my duty to kill you.

1599
01:50:10,144 --> 01:50:11,906
But as a man...

1600
01:50:16,161 --> 01:50:17,922
I have regrets.

1601
01:50:20,961 --> 01:50:24,897
I had a good idea
of what we were carrying.

1602

1606
01:50:46,017 --> 01:50:47,710
I often wonder

you completed your mission.

Perhaps one day...
