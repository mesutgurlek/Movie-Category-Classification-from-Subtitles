00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,915
Miss Barkley, permit
me to present to you

161
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,790
my friend and war brother,
Lieutenant Henry.

162
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,249
He has just returned
back from the front.

163
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,582
How do you do?

164
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,624
And this is Miss Ferguson.

165
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,249
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

166
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,499
- (MAN SINGING OPERA)
- Now he begins again, that fellow.

167
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,657
Quick, let us go into the garden.

168
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,415
Now, you stay here.

169
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:45,999
I will find something for us to drink.
Asti? Grappa? Vermouth?

170
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,874
- Which do you like?
- All of them.

171
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:51,990
- Then you shall have all of them.
- (SINGING CONTINUES)

172
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,115
- Nice out here.
- Hmm, isn't it?

173
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,624
We seem fated to bump into
each other in the dark.

174
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,832
I'm sorry about that.
I mistook you for someone else.

175
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,074
So I gathered.

176
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,949
- I had been drinking.
- I gathered that, too.

177
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,157
- Mad?
- No.

178
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,665
- You're an American, aren't you?
- Yes.

179
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,249
Well, then what are you
doing in the Italian army?

180
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,582
It's not really the army,
it's only the ambulance.

181
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,374
It's very odd, though.
Why did you do it?

182
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,332
I don't know. Why did you?

183
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,749
Oh, I joined up in England.

184
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,657
Besides, the boy I was
engaged to had gone across.

185
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,165
- Where is Miss Ferguson?
- Why don't you go see?

186
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,740
Yes, do bring her out,
Captain Rinaldi.

187
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,032
- FREDERIC: Have some?
- CATHERINE: Thanks.

188
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,207
He's sore.

189
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,582
What for?

190
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,582
Because I'm here with you.

191
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,449
Women prefer him, as a rule.

192
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,782
Shall we take a walk?

193
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,657
Yes, let's.

194
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,040
Where is he now?

195
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,832
- Who?
- The boy you're engaged to.

196
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,249
- He's dead.
- Oh.

197
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,582
He was killed in the Somme.

198
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,249
Were you engaged long?

199
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,707
Eight years. We grew up together.

200
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,707
Why didn't you marry?

201
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:54,157
I didn't know what the
war was like then.

202
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:58,699
If I had it to do over again,
I'd marry him, or anything.

203
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,582
When I joined up,
I remember having this silly idea

204
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,415
that he might come to the
hospital where I was,

205
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,749
with a sabre cut, I suppose,
and a bandage around his head.

206
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,415
Shot through the shoulder.
Something picturesque.

207
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,249
This is a picturesque front.
Not France.

208
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,915
He didn't have a sabre cut.

209
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,490
They blew him to bits.

210
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,290
What are you thinking about now?

211
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,457
About whisky.

212
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,290
What about whisky?

213
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,749
About how nice it is.

214
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,957
And you're nice, too.

215
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,032
(CHUCKLES)

216
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,082
No.

217
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,457
- Why not?
- No, don't.

218
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,782
- Yes.
- No, please!

219
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,415
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?

220
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,874
It's all right.

221
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,782
I'm dreadfully sorry. Really.

222
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,074
I... I just couldn't bear the
nurses'-evening-off aspect of it.

223
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,582
It's quite all right.
I don't mind at all.

224
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,249
Poor man.

225
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,490
You see, I've been leading
a funny sort of life.

226
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,582
Besides, you're so very beautiful.

227
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:07,990
You don't have to talk a lot
of nonsense, I said I'm sorry.

228
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,615
We could get along.

229
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,082
- Couldn't we?
- (LAUGHS)

230
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,540
You're sweet.

231
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,699
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you're a dear.

232
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,199
I'd be very glad to have you
kiss me now, if you don't mind.

233
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,615
(EXPLOSIONS)

234
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,915
You are looking for someone?

235
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,832
- Have you seen Miss Barkley?
- Miss Barkley?

236
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:10,124
- Didn't she go out there with you?
- With me?

237
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,615
- No, no, no.
- But just a little while ago...

238
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,082
I thought I saw her go
out to the garden gate

239
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,207
with the Lieutenant Henry.

240
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,874
She went out with an officer? Alone?

241
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:24,499
Well, perhaps I was mistaken,
you know, it is quite dark out there.

242
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,957
Oh, she wouldn't do that.

243
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,115
No. No, I am sure I was mistaken.

244
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,032
Where is she, then?

245
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,374
You're a grand girl.

246
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,082
I'm a crazy girl.

247
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,582
- Why?
- To stay out here.

248
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,490
It's nice. Isn't that enough?

249
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,749
Hmm, it's nice. I suppose
that has to be enough

250
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,582
for people who are living as we live.

251
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,207
Back home, I'd have courted
you and sent you flowers.

252
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,699
Out here, you crowd
it all into one hour.

253
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:07,074
Isn't that the way it's
got to be, out here?

254
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,199
Look...

255
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,915
Tomorrow morning I've got
to go up to the front again.

256
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:18,282
And if a shell got me and
you never saw me again,

257
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:25,115
then we'd both be sorry that
we've been so formal and waited.

258
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:30,332
Besides, what's there so fine in
putting it off, dragging it out,

259
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,415
- giving me your lips tonight...
- No...

260
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,999
- ...your throat tomorrow...
- No.

261
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,282
No, wait. No, please... No...

262
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,282
Catherine?

263
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,540
- (CLAMOURING)
- Thanks for the lovely concert.

264
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,082
- I...
- I hope you are not worried

265
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,249
about Miss Barkley.

266
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,332
It's not like her to
disappear this way.

267
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,790
Well, perhaps she felt ill
and went home alone.

268
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,874
Perhaps. Good night.

269
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,282
Come, girls, come.

270
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,082
Why didn't you tell me?

271
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,249
It doesn't matter.

272
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,415
If it had to happen,
I'd rather it were like this.

273
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,582
I couldn't know.

274
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,082
In a church or out under the stars.

275
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,915
- Well, why not?
- "Why not"? There's a war on.

276
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,782
And tonight, who cares,
and tomorrow, who knows.

277
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,082
(CHUCKLES)

278
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,749
What did you say your name was?
(LAUGHS)

279
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,865
Stop it.

280
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,874
If you...

281
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:46,699
If you knew how I was back home,
you'd see the funny side of it.

282
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,749
Please, stop it.

283
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,990
(CHUCKLING CONTINUES)

284
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,782
Oh!

285
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,624
We blame everything on
the war, but that's rot.

286
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,490
It's something in ourselves.

287
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,165
(CHUCKLES)

288
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:13,199
The lady sat in the public square
and mourned her lost innocence.

289
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,540
Don't be sorry.

290
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,615
I'm not.

291
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,282
I love you.

292
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,449
Oh, darling.

293
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,749
Did you have a nice, uh, time, baby?
(CHUCKLES)

294
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,749
You made progress with her, eh?

295
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,749
We're friends.
If that's what you mean.

296
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,249
I mean, uh...

297
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,582
Was she nice to you,
practically speaking?

298
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,207
- Shut up!
- I am a man of extreme delicacy,

299
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,582
- but was she...
- Rinaldi!

300
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,415
Will you please shut up?

301
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,582
If you wanna be a
friend of mine, shut up.

302
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,915
I am your best friend
and your war brother.

303
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,115
Then shut up.

304
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:20,699
Miss Barkley prefers you
to me. That is very clear.

305
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:25,240
But Miss Ferguson is very nice, too.

306
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,824
You like her?

307
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,782
No.

308
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,999
FERGY: That you of all people...

309
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,415
A lot of geese, that's what
you are! Silly geese!

310
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:09,749
Stuffed with bunk about
woman's part in the war.

311
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,082
We must bring solace
to the men who fight,

312
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,699
sacrifice ourselves, give ourselves.
(SCOFFS)

313
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:20,457
If you'd known him for a long time,
or been in love with him...

314
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,290
But you only met him tonight.

315
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:27,124
How long must you know a
man before you can love him?

316
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,990
Are you pretending to be
in love with that man?

317
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,949
I think I am, Fergy.

318
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,199
I must be.

319
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,782
Or it couldn't have happened.

320
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,082
You're just another conquest to him.

321
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,790
One in a hundred.

322
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:46,115
You'll probably never see him again.

323
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,915
He said if he'd met me back home,
he'd have courted me,

324
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,290
sent me flowers...

325
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,365
But now...

326
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,865
I suppose I won't ever see him again.

328
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,124
Ciao, baby.

329
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,865
Good luck.

330
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:14,124
- Turn back.
- Back?

331
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,199
Yes, back!

332
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:50,165
- I wanna see Miss Barkley.
- She's on duty.

333
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:52,865
Wait, you can't go in there.

334
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,915
Hey, why have you come
back in here for?

335
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:19,415
The Tenente, he knows
what he's doing. Please.

336
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:21,415
What's wrong, Bonello?
Going to ever get started here?

337
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:22,832
We got plenty of time.

338
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,074
Oh, the...

339
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,207
I thought you started.
What are you doing here?

340
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:31,040
We come back, Signor Capitano.
Tenente forgot something.

341
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:32,782
Oh.

342
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:56,457
Hi. You're all right, aren't you?

343
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,624
Yes, I'm all right.

344
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,415
I came to...

345
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:02,657

346
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,124
You see...

347
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,832
I... I'm going to be
away for a while,

348
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:12,207
and I didn't want you to think
that I'd just gone away.

349
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,915
No, I...

350
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:15,874
What I mean is,

351
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,457
I'd hate to have you feel that...

352
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:22,457
That it wasn't important
to me. About...

353
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,199
About us.

354
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:27,582
Uh, I don't exactly
know how to say it.

355
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:31,199
You've said it very nicely,
dear, thank you.

356
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,407
No, I don't mean...

357
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:37,624
- You mustn't feel...
- Will you be gone long?

358
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,207
No.

359
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:41,790
Only a few days.
There's gonna be a show above...

360
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,915
Up above Plava.
Nothing much, I guess.

361
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:46,915
A show? You'll be careful, won't you?

362
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,282
I won't get hit.

363
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:51,407
Hold this.

364
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:58,740
Here.

365
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,782
It's a Saint Anthony.

366

They say a Saint Anthony is very
useful to guard you from harm.

367
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:14,282
I'll take good care of him.

368
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,282
I wish I could kiss you.

369
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:39,040
He is my friend and a good soldier.

370
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:42,957
I do not like to see him
lose his head over a woman.

371
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,790
Aren't you exaggerating a bit?

372
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:45,999
I think not.

373
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,874
Couldn't we send her
back to the base, Major?

374
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:51,915
Oh, if you could send her away,
it would simplify everything.

375
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:53,915
Could perhaps send her to Milan.

376
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:55,749
Excellent, my dear Major!
Magnificent!

377

No wonder the English
are first in diplomacy.

No, we'll all eat together.

you and never hurt you.

decorated for bravery.

Did you carry somebody on your back?

I couldn't move.

Surely there was something heroic.
Tell me what you did.

It is a bottle of brandy, baby.
Very good brandy.

something more intelligent.

Nobody but you ever realised it.

At first, I thought you

As often as I can.
Do they read your letters?

00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:35,874
Keep her out of this.

790
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:38,790
Sacred subject. Believe me, baby,

791
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:42,365
sacred subjects are not
good for soldiers.

792
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:46,457
(LAUGHS) Why don't you be
like me? All fire and smoke.

793
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:48,790
And nothing inside. (LAUGHS)

794
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:51,124
- Come on, baby.
- You're drunk, stop it.

795
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:52,582
Of course I am drunk!

796
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:54,874
You come with me and you
will be drunk, too.

797
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:56,582
Come on, baby.

798
00:57:56,583 --> 00:58:01,449
Oh, I am sorry. Now you must come.
There is no more ink. (LAUGHS)

799
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:04,615
Get your hands off me and get out!

800
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:09,249
(CHUCKLES)

801
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,790
Poor baby.

802
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:13,915
Tomorrow I will get you drunk
and I will take out your liver

803
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:16,082
and I will put you in
a good Italian liver

804
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:18,457
and make a man of you again.

805
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:20,532
Ciao, baby.

806
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:33,415
MAN:
You're going out, Signor Capitano?

807
00:58:33,416 --> 00:58:36,915
- Yes, why?
- The mail just came, Signor Capitano.

808
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:40,040
- You censor it.
- Signor capitano...

809
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:42,740
The officers' mail, too?

810
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:47,282
Very well.

811
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:00,457
Aren't you gonna open them,
Signor Capitano?

812
00:59:00,458 --> 00:59:01,665
No!

813
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:03,949
I'm in a hurry.

814
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,415
- Send this one back.
- Yes, Signor Capitano.

815
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:26,665
I do not like to see him
lose his head over a woman.

816
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:29,115
Yes, Signor capitano.

817
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:53,790
And today my letters came back.
Every one I'd ever written to her.

818
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:54,915
Came back?

819
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:57,540
Just marked "Return to sender.
Person unknown."

820
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:59,457
Well, that's very strange.

821
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:01,582
Thirty-two letters.
She never got one.

822
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:04,874
- Well, that's why she never wrote you.
- No.

823
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:07,124
She'd have written me anyway.
Something's happened to her.

824
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:10,790
- Have you tried to...
- I can't get any information at all.

825
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:14,207
- I've got to go and find her myself.
- How can you?

826
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:15,749
I'm going to Milan. I'll find her.

827
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,749
But aren't all leaves
of absence forbidden

828
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,665
since that battle in the north began?

829
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:23,115
- I'm going anyway.
- No, that's desertion.

830
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:25,915
- I don't care, I'm going.
- You'll be caught.

831
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:29,249
- You mustn't do this, Frederico.
- Yes, I must.

832
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,082
That's what I wanted
to tell you, Padre.

833
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,957
What does this war
mean to me any more?

834
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:35,749
What does anything mean,
but finding her?

835
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:39,324
- But Frederico, consider the...
- I can depend on you, Padre?

836
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:46,249
Say goodbye to Rinaldi
and the others for me.

837
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:49,124
- When are you leaving?
- Now. While they are at dinner.

838
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:52,115
And by morning, when they miss me,
I'll be halfway to Milan.

839
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:54,874
If they ask me, what will I say? I...

840
01:00:54,875 --> 01:00:57,082
Anything you like.

841
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:58,582
Goodbye, Padre.

842
01:00:58,583 --> 01:01:00,415
Goodbye, Frederico.

843
01:01:00,416 --> 01:01:03,657
May the Lord bless and preserve you.

What are you carabinieri
doing in the yards?

847
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:20,749
- Looking for stragglers.
- What do you do with them?

848
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,915
Send them back to fight invaders.

849
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:25,790
Every foot of Italian
soil must be regained.

Suppose they don't want to go back?

Then we shoot them.

Shh! Where's Catherine?

01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:54,707
- What are you doing back here?
- Where's Catherine?

855
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:55,874
I know.

856
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:58,332
You've run away. You're a deserter.

857

- You can't. She's gone.

- Gone? Where?
- And you'd better get out.

859
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,749
- Has she been transferred?
- If you don't get out of here,

860

I'll scream and bring the
whole hospital down on you.

but I won't tell you.
You've done her enough harm.

01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:21,874
- What do you mean?
- I said you'd get her into trouble.

I hate you. Hate, you understand?
I won't tell you anything.

mixed up in it myself.

You won't. I just want
you to get some things,

01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,874
and put an advertisement
in the newspaper for me.

Uh, two vermouth.

you were dead.

It never occurred to us that you
might have be shell-shocked,

How did you find me?

we arranged everything.

No.

Get that straight.

But you cannot do that!

906
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,624
You cannot just stop and say,
"I'm through with the war."

no one can save you.

- They will shoot you.

Get this through your head,
I'm not going back!

920
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:29,449
I've got to wait here until
I can find Catherine.

And how do you expect to do that?

922

927
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,290
Yes, it would.

928
01:11:53,291 --> 01:11:57,782
It means that I've got to find
her and get her out of Italy.

929
01:11:57,791 --> 01:12:02,282
- Perhaps she's no longer in Italy.
- What makes you say that?

930
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:04,374
She is in Switzerland.

931
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:06,040
Where?

01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:38,740
Yes, madam. Step around here.

937
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,249
No.

938
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:44,824
Just the head, please.

939
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:20,374
Isn't there any mail for me, yet?

940
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:21,999
Ah, madam!

941
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,457
Yes, yes. Today there are letters.

942
01:13:24,458 --> 01:13:27,082
- Many letters.
- Many? Oh!
