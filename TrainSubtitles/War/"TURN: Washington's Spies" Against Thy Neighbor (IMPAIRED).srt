1
00:00:00,357 --> 00:00:02,057
Previously on Turn...

2
00:00:02,621 --> 00:00:04,521
- What's this?
- It's a code dictionary.

3
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:07,122
Makes sure that anything that you
write can't be read by the enemy.

4
00:00:07,468 --> 00:00:09,068
I'm not gonna remember all this.

5
00:00:09,168 --> 00:00:11,768
That's why you keep the book hidden.

6
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:13,912
Our little secret.

7
00:00:14,294 --> 00:00:15,814
I've been charged by Major Hewlett

8
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,749
with ferreting out a conspiracy in town.

9
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:20,353
If it's rebel sympathizers
you're looking for,

10
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:24,365
the petition for the New York
Convention is a good place to start.

11
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,375
You know I'll never stop.

12
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:35,899
You can't possibly understand a word of it.

13
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,327
It's a code key, all
right? The same as ours.

14
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:40,687
Ben will be able to decipher it.

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:47,886
(people chatting)

16
00:00:53,072 --> 00:00:55,172

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,309
<i>(violin playing)</i>

18
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:02,402
How much are these?

19
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,540
(children shouting)

20
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:13,589
(giggling)

21
00:01:57,502 --> 00:02:00,871
<i>Simcoe: These spies are even
more cunning than I thought.</i>

22
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:03,878
<i>They appear to have been
operating for some time</i>

23
00:02:03,912 --> 00:02:06,046
<i>right under our noses.</i>

24
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,684
(whickering)

25
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:11,720
Spies?

26
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:14,790
Now they've been promoted
from conspirators to spies?

27
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:17,062
Well, the distinction is hardly great.

28
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:18,932
And yet still no evidence.

29
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:21,835
No names, just conjecture and gossip.

30
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:24,805
Gossip is how these things start.

31
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:28,209
Scripture tells us that the
tongue is a restless evil

32
00:02:28,243 --> 00:02:30,278
full of deadly poison.

33
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:33,550
And it tells us that "Thou shalt not
bear false witness against thy neighbor."

34
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:35,321
It's been a month, Captain Simcoe.

35
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,859
Where is this mythical Patriot
petition that I was promised?

36
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:42,632
I've yet to uncover it. I fear
it's likely been destroyed.

37
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,736
<i>So then all you have is gossip.</i>

38
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,277
<i>Simcoe: I have a sense the conspirators</i>

39
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,245
<i>know that I'm coming for them.</i>

40
00:03:05,057 --> 00:03:06,390
Calm down, Bucephalus.

41
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:08,260
(breathing heavily)

42
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:09,329

43
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:11,568
Shh, calm down. Calm, boy.

44

54

Someone was in a hurry.

55
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:48,302
Oh, believe me. I wish we had more time.

56
00:03:51,702 --> 00:03:54,972
If I could, I'd leave this
place with you tomorrow.

57
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,175
But you can't.

58
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,411
And neither can I.

59
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:12,149
You've your obligation to your family...

60
00:04:13,784 --> 00:04:17,254
and we both have our roles
to play for Washington...

61
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:19,757
<i>- Mr. Culpepper.
- Mm.</i>

62
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:23,226
- I hate that name.
- (Laughs)

63
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,228
Oh, I don't know.

64
00:04:25,262 --> 00:04:26,695
I quite like it.

65
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:29,198
Oh, really?

66
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:32,338
After all, if I can't be Mrs. Woodhull,

67
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,808
perhaps I can be Mrs. Culpepp...

68
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,176
No, don't say it.

69
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,979

<i>Doctor: You did him a mercy.</i>

89
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,279
His heart was under great stress.

90
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:29,552
And I've little doubt of the cause.

91
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:32,221
Are you suggesting poison?

92
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:35,558
Well, I don't know much
about them, but there's...

93
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:39,495
there's a foreign smell to
this apple, like almonds.

94
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,562
Of course he was poisoned.

95
00:06:41,597 --> 00:06:43,198
What else could it be?

96
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:46,071
He was... he was in perfect health.

97
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,374
Just perfect. Perfect.

98
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,108
This was murder.

99
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:52,944
A senseless murder.

100
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,118
I doubt Bucephalus was
the intended target, Major.

101
00:06:57,153 --> 00:06:59,819
Didn't you often eat the
same apples you fed him?

102
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:05,594
Someone was trying to kill you, sir.

103
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,961
Do you know where this fruit came from?

104
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:11,363
Uh, Brewster... Lucas Brewster.

105
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,399
He has the biggest orchard in town.

106
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:18,100
Brewster is one of the
names at the top of my list.

107
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:19,967
A miscreant in his youth,

108
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:22,835
vocal in his rejection of any authority.

109
00:07:23,873 --> 00:07:27,272
I'll detain him while we search his farm.

110
00:07:27,306 --> 00:07:29,876
<i>Ben: The answer was here all the time.</i>

111
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,745
<i>Sir, we merely needed the key.</i>

112
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,879
The cipher key, from Major
Andre's own code book no less.

113
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,682
Courtesy of our friend in New York.

114
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:40,684
Mr. Culpepper does not shy
away from the bold play.

115
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:42,485
And once Mr. Sackett deciphered it,

116
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,154
we were able to apply it
to the encrypted dispatches

117
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:46,922
that we intercepted last month.

118
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:48,653
"And immediately there fell from his eyes

119
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:50,486
as it had been scales,

120
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:52,356
and he received sight forthwith."

121
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,026
Mr. Sackett, it seems, has
undergone a conversion to faith.

122
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,163
Hmm, perhaps because, for the first time,

123
00:07:58,197 --> 00:08:00,966
we are able to see their
movements as a deity might...

124
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:02,499
from on high.

125
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:06,837
Sir, the enemy will try to
take Philadelphia by sea,

126
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:08,940
by the Delaware Bay.

127
00:08:08,974 --> 00:08:12,446
All of our scouting reports
argue that the attacks

128
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,881
will come by land from the north.

129
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,449
That's what they want you to think.

130
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:18,385
It's a feint, sir. The dispatches indicate

131
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,055
<i>that General Howe has ordered 3,000 men</i>

132
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:24,022
to be withdrawn from Cornwallis's troops

133
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:26,858
and quietly marched to Staten Island,

134
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:29,427
where the Royal Navy has secretly gathered

135
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:32,529
over 100 boats for an expeditionary force.

136
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:35,432
The order reportedly left
Cornwallis in high dudgeon,

137
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:37,464
anxious as he was to personally thank you

138
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:42,200
for disrupting a visit to his
wife with that, uh, Trenton affair.

139
00:08:43,737 --> 00:08:47,338
Major Tallmadge, you
are to ready a detachment

140
00:08:47,373 --> 00:08:50,272
to rendezvous with General
Arnold in Connecticut,

141
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:52,176
dragoons and militia, immediately.

142
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,409
North?

143
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:55,809
But, sir, we've just proven

144
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:57,410
that the attack will be coming from...

145
00:08:57,445 --> 00:09:00,983
From the south, which
is why I will make plans

146
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:04,154
to shore up our defenses on
the Delaware, if you agree.

147
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:06,623
Of course, sir.

148
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:10,562
Good, then unless you think it's
wise to inform the enemy of our plan,

149
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:12,531
perhaps you will join me in convincing them

150
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:15,067
<i>that their plan is working.</i>

151
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:17,670
A counter-feint.

00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:24,441
You have discretion to act as you see fit

153

to advance the mission.

154
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:32,589

00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:39,061
- Oh, no, no. I couldn't ask that.
- It's...

164
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:42,732
I'd do it for Abraham, but he's not here.

165
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:46,835
I can hazard a guess of
where he is, of course.

166
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,606
Or who he's with.

167
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,977
Perhaps I should leave.

168
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:53,544
Why?

169
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:56,345
You're the only one who
really lives here now.

170
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:02,754
Tell me, Mr. Baker...

171
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,126
did your parents marry for love

172
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,563
or did their parents decide for them?

173
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:14,135
I never knew my parents.

174
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:17,039
I was told my father was
a sailor and my mother...

175
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,683
I was raised in an orphanage.

176
00:11:22,718 --> 00:11:25,585
<i>I never had the luxury of
growing up in a home like this,</i>

177
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,954
as your son will.

178
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,658
There is love here, Mrs. Woodhull.

179
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:37,529
I know because I know what
its absence feels like.

180
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,034
(men chattering)

181
00:11:48,843 --> 00:11:50,443
<i>(door opens)</i>

182
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:54,379
- Is the owner here? DeJong?
- No, but I can get him.

183
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:57,782
- Whatever they said I did, it's not true.
- That's enough out of you.

184
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:59,952
Tell him we're taking his
cellar as a temporary jail.

185
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,590
<i>Orders of the major. I need you to open it.</i>

186
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:06,860
<i>Man: Was that Lucas Brewster?</i>

187
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,432
<i>They arrested Lucas Brewster.</i>

188
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:18,707
<i>Richard: I admit the evidence is damning,</i>

189
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:22,547
though I find it hard to imagine
a man afflicted with palsy

190
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:26,686
would have the steady hand to mix poison.

191
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,224
A weak constitution is an
excellent cover for a devious mind.

192
00:12:30,258 --> 00:12:32,891
Abraham?

193
00:12:32,925 --> 00:12:35,793
Forgive the intrusion. I heard
Lucas Brewster's been arrested.

194
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:37,195
Are the charges serious?

195
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:39,563
Very, Captain Simcoe believes that Brewster

196
00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:42,131
<i>killed Major Hewlett's
horse with a poisoned apple</i>

197
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:45,533
intended for the major himself.

198
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:48,035
He died for me.

199
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,137
These are serious charges.

200
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,873
Is there any evidence to support them?

201
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,409
We have the matter well in hand.

202
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:56,744
<i>Thank you, Farmer Woodhull.</i>

203
00:12:56,778 --> 00:13:00,411
Has Brewster in any way confessed?

204
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:02,078
No.

205
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:04,680
But I expect a noose will
make an honest man of him.

206
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:08,783
Perhaps before rushing to that conclusion,

207
00:13:08,818 --> 00:13:12,889
we should send for someone
more expert than Dr. Mabbs.

208
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:17,493
If we are gonna hang a citizen of Setauket,

209
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:20,062
the accusation should be confirmed.

210
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:24,403
Of course, Your Honor.
Every care should be taken.

211
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,604
I'll advise the major.

212
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,015
Oh, damn. Mary borrowed my
coach to visit you with Thomas.

213
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,983
That's all right, I can
give you a ride into town.

214
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,586
- Right.
- Could I accompany you?

215
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,722
Abe: Wouldn't your own horse be faster?

216
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:44,525
Simcoe: I'm in no rush.

217
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,195
And I'd appreciate the
chance to discuss the case

218
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:47,897
against Brewster with Your Honor.

219
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:49,568
I must say, I'm pleased to see you two

220
00:13:49,602 --> 00:13:51,135
have moved past your differences.

221
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,303
Indeed.

222
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,240
I've learned that patience and forbearance

223
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:59,180
are much preferred to
anger and rash action.

224
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,679
I agree, especially when personal grudges

225
00:14:01,714 --> 00:14:03,513
end up affecting those who are innocent.

226
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:05,316
Yes, the innocent must
be protected at all costs.

227
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,550
That must be the foremost
concern of any justice...

228
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:09,016
<i>- (gunshot)
- Ah!</i>

229
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:11,085
Father! Father!

230
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:14,121
Stay down!

231
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:15,956
Oh, Jesus.

232
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,425
It came from over there.

233
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,428
Father, look at me. Look at me!

234
00:14:21,463 --> 00:14:22,763
Help!

235
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:24,764
<i>Soldier: Behind the fence!</i>

236
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,867
Father!

237
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,569
- Now hold him. Hold him down.
- (Grunting)

238
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,236
Look at me, Father. Look at me.

239
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,281
Just breathe. Just breathe.

240
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,618
- Put pressure, pressure.
- Hold him down.

241
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:45,987
Oh, my God.

242
00:14:46,022 --> 00:14:47,922
Please, take him away.

243
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:50,223
What happened?

244
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,158
He has been shot

245
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,661
just outside a few hours ago.

246
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:58,732
Whoever it was has escaped for
the moment, but will be found soon.

247
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:01,635
Abe: Come on, hurry up.

248
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:03,840
I'll be right there.

249
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:09,649
(grunting)

250
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:18,157
That's good. All right, he's done.

251
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:19,525
Praise be to God.

252
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,993
If that ball had punctured his stomach

253
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:23,428
or had shattered on a rib, he'd be gone.

254
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:25,828
(whispers)

255
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:27,630
(pants)

256
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:30,433
Wh...

257
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:32,635
- Is he dead?
- No.

258
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:35,204
<i>He's just overcome.</i>

259
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:38,806
We found the place where he was shot from.

260
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:41,744
A fence rail still spotted with his powder,

261
00:15:41,778 --> 00:15:44,882
and we found this nearby.

262
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,682
Must've used it as wadding for a shot.

263
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:50,216
It appears to be torn from a book.

264
00:15:50,251 --> 00:15:51,719
The wadding survived?

265
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:55,056
It's not any book. A Bible.

266
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:58,061
A verse from Judges.

267
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:00,697
Hmm.

268
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:05,130
An assassin who wraps his
boulette in the word of God.

269
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,467
I want every firearm

270
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:10,773
in this town surrendered tomorrow

271
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:13,139
and anyone who does not comply

272
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,807
must be considered a suspect and arrested.

273
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:18,211
<i>Simcoe: I'll post the order immediately.</i>

274
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,046
I promise you, we'll
find the man who did this

275
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,550
<i>and the rest of this league of assassins.</i>

276
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,762
<i>Hewlett: State your name.</i>

277
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:40,531
Walter Havens.

278
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:43,770
Havens. One blunderbuss.

279
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:46,705
The rebel whaleboats are
ranging further up the coast.

280
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:49,239
Without my shot, they'll take my catch.

281
00:16:49,273 --> 00:16:50,940
Your weapon will be returned to you

282
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:53,576
when I'm reassured the
town is once again safe.

283
00:16:54,877 --> 00:16:57,644
Safe for whom?

284
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:02,852
Make a note... "Less
than fully cooperative."

285
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:05,655
Oh, this is hardly necessary
in your case, Abraham.

286
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:08,459
The law applies to me the
same as anyone else, sir.

287
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,832
Mark him down, "very cooperative."

288
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:16,935
(men murmuring)

289
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,510
State your name.

290
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,946
You know who I am.

291
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,148
State your name.

292
00:17:28,183 --> 00:17:31,019
Nathaniel Tallmadge.

293
00:17:31,053 --> 00:17:34,155
This is my church that
you now call your stables.

294
00:17:34,776 --> 00:17:37,915
I think it suits the town better
as a defensive fortification

295
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:40,317
rather than a pulpit for seditious sermons.

296
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:43,970
A fine fowling piece.

297
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:45,644
If you say so.

298
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,281
But what does a man of
the cloth need weapons for?

299
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:53,006
Are we now practicing the
insurrection that we preached?

300
00:17:53,063 --> 00:17:55,829
I never minded fighting for a just cause.

301
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:59,201
Or speaking against an unjust one.

302
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,507
"For all they that take the
sword shall perish by the sword."

303
00:18:09,877 --> 00:18:12,343
<i>(gun clatters)</i>

304
00:18:12,377 --> 00:18:15,044
(quietly) Everything is set, Captain.

305
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:22,590
Now they've taken our
guns, we're at their mercy.

306
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:24,104
You mean the mercy of the rebels

307
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:25,704
like the one they've
got locked up down below.

308
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,171
Figures that it's a Brewster.

309
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:28,505
I'm married to a Brewster.

310
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,176
Moses?

311
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,811
Moses, do you still have it?

312
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,412
- What?
- You know what I mean.

313
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,985
The petition.

314
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:40,720
You do, don't you?

315
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:43,990
Well, I suggest you put it to
the fire and run while you can.

316
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,860
Run? And just leave everything?

317
00:18:45,894 --> 00:18:47,695
Well, what've you got?

318
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:51,231
You have no family. You can
start over in Connecticut

319
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:53,335
or join the Continentals.

320
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,671
Walter, look at me.

321
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:59,141
Look at me. I just...
I can't just leave...

322
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:02,377
Just meet me at moonrise by my boat.

323
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:04,778
The cove beyond Crane Neck Point.

324

<i>Ludlow: You always were
an empty bottle, Robeson.</i>

325
00:19:09,051 --> 00:19:10,485
If you had as much brains as you have guts,

326
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,354
what a clever fellow you'd be.

327
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:13,922
Guts enough to brain you.

328
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:16,888
(men shouting)

329
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,995
Enough.

330
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:23,798
Whatever our grievances,

331
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:25,733
we have more in common with each other

332
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:28,938
than we do with those men perched
like vultures up on that hill.

333
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:32,809
<i>First, they took our church.</i>

334
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:35,746
Then they took our headstones.

335
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,716
Now the means to defend ourselves?
What will they take next?

336
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,218
<i>- (man pounds on table)
- Hear, hear.</i>

337
00:19:41,252 --> 00:19:45,091
Don't you see who your real enemies are?

338
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:48,061
Spoken like a true rebel.

339
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:52,737
Might we have a word, Reverend Tallmadge?

340
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:08,352
<i>(door closes)</i>

341
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:10,521
<i>Hewlett: Good news. Good news.</i>

342
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:12,324
We have found the man responsible...

343
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:15,129
your father's old nemesis,
Reverend Tallmadge.

344
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:17,330
The reverend?

345
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:19,766
Major, with all due respect,
the reverend would more likely

346
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,602
shoot you than my father.

347
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:25,707
His attitude when he turned in
the weapons was highly combative.

348
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:28,243
Captain Simcoe found that his
musket had recently been fired,

349
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:30,645
so I ordered his house to be searched.

350
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:32,814
I found this on his person.

351
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:36,619
Judges 3, a most appropriate selection.

352
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:41,021
It seems the reverend is an artist
who cannot resist signing his work.

353
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:42,823
A Mr. Moses Paine to see you, sir.

354
00:20:42,857 --> 00:20:44,726
With urgent information, he says.

355
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,729
Very well.

356
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:52,939
Major, Captain.

357
00:20:52,974 --> 00:20:55,076
What have you for us, Mr. Paine?

358
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,378
The petition you've been looking for

359
00:20:57,413 --> 00:21:00,414
<i>backing Selah Strong to
the New York Congress.</i>

360
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:05,219
I confess my name is on it,

361
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:07,789
<i>a foolish mistake in a
moment of drunken weakness.</i>

362
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:11,427
But I suspect there are others who
will prove of more interest to you.

363
00:21:11,461 --> 00:21:14,164
- The petition?
- Yes.

364
00:21:15,632 --> 00:21:17,901
It seems we finally have the means

365
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:20,472
<i>to capture the rest of the cabal.</i>

366
00:21:20,506 --> 00:21:24,675
Arrest every name on this
list if they are still in town.

367
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,450
<i>Order Appleton to start
building gallows for 10.</i>

368
00:21:28,484 --> 00:21:31,552
And arrest Mr. Paine.

369
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:34,353
But I brought you this
information of my own free will.

370
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:36,155
<i>Hewlett: No doubt to save your own skin.</i>

371
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,625
If you'd have brought it earlier,

372
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:39,462
you could've saved another life.

373
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:41,330
<i>Go.</i>

374
00:21:42,397 --> 00:21:44,098
These men will require prosecution.

375
00:21:44,132 --> 00:21:46,002
Yes.

376
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:47,605
We can hardly ask your father

377
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,009
to manage such proceedings
in his condition,

378
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:53,178
even if it is just a formality.

379
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:54,946
I'll do it.

380
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,147
I studied the law at King's College.

381
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:00,817
I have watched my father dispense
justice since I could stand.

382
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:02,953
If he will trust me to act in his stead,

383
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,925
<i>it'll be swifter than to
wait for another magistrate.</i>

384
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:10,729
Richard?

385
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,206
It's time I assumed some of the burden.

386
00:22:31,496 --> 00:22:33,964
(horse whinnies)

387
00:22:46,636 --> 00:22:50,608
<i>Caleb: Hey, look at the boy.</i>

388
00:22:50,642 --> 00:22:52,811
Army life suiting you, Mr. Strong?

389
00:22:52,845 --> 00:22:55,677
Better since you swiped
me a decent pair of boots.

390
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:58,212
- (chuckles)
- How far is the coast?

391
00:22:58,246 --> 00:23:01,548
The coast? Five miles, give or take.

392
00:23:01,582 --> 00:23:03,249
You thinking of home, Selah?

393
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:05,621
Well, with the men we have here,

394
00:23:05,655 --> 00:23:07,491
we outnumber Hewlett's garrison.

395
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:10,394
I say we return there,
take back what's ours.

396
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:12,931
Right, and after we take
it, we can stay there

397
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:15,133
till, oh, at least suppertime

398
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:16,667
before the Navy smokes us out.

399
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:18,534
It'd be a good meal, though.

400
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:21,944
Yeah, I'm with you there. (clicks tongue)

401
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:30,518
Fraternizing with the enlisted men?

402
00:23:30,552 --> 00:23:32,555
Not sure he'd be so full of spunk

403
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:34,860
if he knew his wife thinks him dead.

404
00:23:34,895 --> 00:23:36,662
I coulda sorted this
out if your pal Sackett

405
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:38,597
let me and Culpepper meet
up instead of having him

406
00:23:38,632 --> 00:23:40,566
stash his letters in the
hollow of an old tree.

407
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:43,203
Sackett's procedures are
intended to keep you both safe.

408
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:46,676
But these are our friends
we're lying to, Ben.

409
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:48,847
They're agents. They only
know what they need to know.

410
00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:50,315
<i>Any more could put them in danger.</i>

411
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,982
Right, so Anna doesn't need to know

412
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:54,282
her husband's still alive.

413
00:23:54,317 --> 00:23:57,487
This isn't personal,
Caleb. It's a discipline...

414
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,657
a craft, as Mr. Sackett calls it.

415
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:01,259
The more we stick by the rules,

416
00:24:01,293 --> 00:24:02,995
the better it will be for all of us.

417
00:24:10,675 --> 00:24:13,078
<i>(door opens)</i>

418
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:15,349
<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>

419
00:24:23,624 --> 00:24:25,156
What are you doing here?

420
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:26,990
I heard a rumor I couldn't imagine is true.

421
00:24:27,025 --> 00:24:28,525
Well, just let me explain.

422
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,125
Moses Paine has turned in the petition

423
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,860
that backed Selah for Congress.

424
00:24:32,895 --> 00:24:35,396
They're out looking for
the others who signed it.

425
00:24:35,431 --> 00:24:39,503
So, why in God's name are you
helping Hewlett to swing the axe?

426
00:24:39,537 --> 00:24:41,203
The charges are false.

427
00:24:41,237 --> 00:24:42,837
Simcoe has created the threat.

428
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:45,341
All I have to do is present the case

429
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:48,045
and then just see it fall apart.

430
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,678
You're planning to lose?

431
00:24:49,713 --> 00:24:51,213
Do you have a better idea?

432
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:54,449
Gather those loyal, raid the armory,

433
00:24:54,483 --> 00:24:56,217
storm the church, and
shoot Hewlett and Simcoe...

434
00:24:56,252 --> 00:24:58,619
And then hang the Grand
Union Flag over the church?

435
00:24:58,654 --> 00:25:02,025
- Mm.
- And then what?

436
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:04,395
Then we bring the war here to Setauket?

437
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:07,265
The war is already
here, can't you see that?

438
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,979
I have to study this.

439
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:14,781

00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:54,227
walls himself from friend and neighbor

485
00:27:54,261 --> 00:27:56,093
and he lives a secret life,

486
00:27:56,128 --> 00:28:00,668
pretending to be a part of the
God-fearing community of man,

487
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:04,870
the community of laws and of shared values,

488
00:28:04,904 --> 00:28:08,141
<i>even as he plots its overthrow.</i>

489
00:28:08,176 --> 00:28:10,743
<i>Now, the evidence against
these men is clear.</i>

490
00:28:10,778 --> 00:28:12,678
<i>Of their guilt, there is no doubt.</i>

491
00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:17,050
But it is their salvation
that we are about today.

492
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:21,422
Only by their confession
can they repent their sins

493
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:23,258
<i>and, in return,</i>

494
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:25,762
solicit a measure of our mercy.

495
00:28:27,698 --> 00:28:30,100
Lucas Brewster, stand and face the bench.

496
00:28:40,147 --> 00:28:42,872
Do you swear to tell the truth,

497
00:28:42,876 --> 00:28:44,244
the truth being your only defense

498
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,314
against these charges against you?

499
00:28:46,348 --> 00:28:48,048
All right.

500
00:28:48,082 --> 00:28:51,383
I... I suppose I...

501
00:28:51,418 --> 00:28:54,750
Yes. Yes, I do.

502
00:28:56,619 --> 00:29:01,288
Did you conspire with Nathaniel
Tallmadge and these other men

503
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,495
to assassinate Major Hewlett
and Judge Richard Woodhull?

504
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:06,898
No.

505
00:29:06,932 --> 00:29:09,399
- Of course not.
- (All laugh)

506
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:14,173
And yet this vial of cyanide
poison was found in your house.

507
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:18,210
Those redcoats claim they
found it. It's nothing of mine.

508
00:29:18,245 --> 00:29:21,850
Mr. Brewster, it is
pointless to impugn the words

509
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,620
of these good men. These are officers.

510
00:29:24,654 --> 00:29:27,492
They are sworn to protect us
and they have earned our trust.

511
00:29:27,526 --> 00:29:30,196
Yeah, and what about my word?

512
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:33,032
Your word? The word of a poisoner?

513
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:34,834
The lowest form of assassin?

514
00:29:34,868 --> 00:29:36,870
He who strikes like a
viper from the shadows,

515
00:29:36,904 --> 00:29:39,438
too fearful to face his
enemy? Your word, sir?

516
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:42,207
<i>- These are lies cooked up by them.
- Why would they lie?</i>

517
00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:45,347
<i>- What possible motive would they have?
- Damned if I know.</i>

518
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:48,352
You conspired against the
Crown! You provided aid,

519
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:50,088
- and you provided comfort to the enemy!
- No, no.

520
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:51,657
- You tried to murder these men...
- No, no!

521
00:29:51,692 --> 00:29:53,192
And you tried to kill my father!

522
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,295
Leave the poor man alone!

523
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,630
Can't you see he's sick?

524
00:29:57,664 --> 00:30:00,133
(banging)

525
00:30:00,168 --> 00:30:02,103
Mr. Brewster may be seated.

526
00:30:02,137 --> 00:30:04,570
We will resume when order is restored.

527
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:08,309
(murmuring)

528
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:15,343
An unfortunate turn.

529
00:30:15,377 --> 00:30:18,013
And yet I wonder if it was just bad luck

530
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:20,914
that let you rouse such
sympathy for a killer.

531
00:30:20,948 --> 00:30:22,912
Should I have been gentler with him?

532
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:26,080
This is just a formality, as you said.

533
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,016
You and I are merely players in a comedy

534
00:30:28,051 --> 00:30:29,983
whose ending has already been written.

535
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:36,553
But, by all means,
continue the performance.

536
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:51,565
Sip slowly, Father. I'm not going anywhere.

537
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,065
You should.

538
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:55,199
Your husband may have
need of a friendly face

539
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:57,637
during his first foray as a magistrate.

540
00:30:57,672 --> 00:31:00,605
I'm afraid Abraham does not feel much

541
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,009
like a husband these days, nor I a wife.

542
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:07,413
Mary, whatever distance

543
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:09,948
has grown between you and my son,

544
00:31:09,982 --> 00:31:12,116
perhaps it's time you acknowledge

545
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,118
the part you have played in it.

546
00:31:15,557 --> 00:31:17,124
My part?

547
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:19,692
You convinced me to pardon Selah Strong.

548
00:31:19,726 --> 00:31:21,729
Yes, and that only worsened the problem.

549
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:24,967
Because it was a subterfuge
when you should've been direct.

550
00:31:26,735 --> 00:31:29,538
<i>Do you truly want Abraham?</i>

551
00:31:36,783 --> 00:31:40,787
(sighs) Aberdeen will take care of me.

552
00:31:40,821 --> 00:31:43,158
Go be with him.

553
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,660
<i>Go be with your husband.</i>

554
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:58,363
A page torn from a Bible
to help propel a bullet.

555
00:31:58,397 --> 00:32:01,332
<i>A bullet that nearly
ended my father's life.</i>

556
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:04,668
A page from Judges to help kill a judge.

557
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:06,770
Do you deny it?

558
00:32:06,804 --> 00:32:09,872
Deny a page was torn from
it, no, but not by my hands.

559
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:12,641
If not yours, Mr. Tallmadge, then whose?

560
00:32:12,676 --> 00:32:17,045
That man visited me with one
of his men to ask questions.

561
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,814
I'm guessing when my back was turned...

562
00:32:18,848 --> 00:32:20,550
I suppose you also credit Captain Simcoe

563
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:22,653
with firing the round, despite the fact

564
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:26,222
that he was with myself and my
father at the time of the shooting.

565
00:32:26,256 --> 00:32:29,658
- But where were you?
- In my home.

566
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:32,595
(scoffs) And can any here testify to that?

567
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:34,932
I was alone.

568
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:37,466
Of course.

569
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,868
You were alone.

570
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:45,206
You've been alone for
some time now, haven't you?

571
00:32:45,241 --> 00:32:48,111
Because of the choices that you've made,

572
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:51,651
preaching rebellion until
your congregation walked away.

573
00:32:51,685 --> 00:32:54,121
Your father walked away.
The rest followed like sheep.

574
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:56,390
<i>Abe: Because their shepherd went astray!</i>

575
00:32:56,424 --> 00:32:58,860
And where did that leave you?

576
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:02,666
Abandoned and angry, and
at one man in particular.

577
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,573
So you went way beyond
sermonizing, didn't ya?

578
00:33:06,607 --> 00:33:09,108
Huh? Colluding with all of these men

579
00:33:09,143 --> 00:33:11,977
to overthrow the powers that you
blamed for destroying your life!

580
00:33:12,011 --> 00:33:14,478
You preach against me in my own church?

581
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,515
Well, then repent.

582
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,381
Just repent and silence me.

583
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,716
- How dare you, boy?
- I dare because I'm the son

584
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,450
of the man that you almost killed.

585
00:33:25,386 --> 00:33:28,718
You were well-equipped for
the task as well, weren't you?

586
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:32,624
I remember the war stories
you told when I was a boy.

587
00:33:32,658 --> 00:33:35,757
<i>His years fighting the
French and the Iroquois.</i>

588
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:39,364
This is your musket, is it not?

589
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:40,931
I don't deny the weapon's mine,

590
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:43,465
but I deny I used it against
your father or any man.

591
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:47,601
I swore an oath after that
war never to take another life.

592
00:33:47,636 --> 00:33:52,136
I see that you cannot
be induced to confess.

593
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:56,307
Shall I then show these good people

594
00:33:56,341 --> 00:34:00,210
how you used musket and
ball together so shamefully?

595
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,646
First, the primer, yes?

596
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:10,785
And then the firing charge.

597
00:34:15,457 --> 00:34:18,291
Then the ball that was
extracted from my father's body.

598
00:34:18,326 --> 00:34:20,896
<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>

599
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:24,799
And then to ram it home, just a...

600
00:34:24,834 --> 00:34:26,834
<i>(crowd chuckling)</i>

601
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:28,971
It seems our
farmer-turned-barrister

602
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:30,774
is in need of some assistance. Allow me.

603
00:34:30,808 --> 00:34:33,539
<i>- (crowd laughing)
- Allow me.</i>

604
00:34:39,282 --> 00:34:40,415
Ball?

605
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:52,859
(all gasp)

606
00:35:05,975 --> 00:35:09,078
I'm guessing you've never seen
a Pennsylvania rifle, Captain.

607
00:35:09,113 --> 00:35:11,115
The barrel's grooved.

608
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,316
It takes a smaller round
than your Brown Bess.

609
00:35:14,351 --> 00:35:16,753
That one you're trying
to jam down her muzzle,

610
00:35:16,787 --> 00:35:19,524
<i>the one our young Hotspur here
says almost killed his father,</i>

611
00:35:19,558 --> 00:35:22,323
well, that's a musket round.

612
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:25,429
The kind a king's man might
use if he was bent on murder.

613
00:35:25,463 --> 00:35:27,767
(murmuring)

614
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:29,769
After hearing all my war stories,

615
00:35:29,804 --> 00:35:31,970
I'm surprised you didn't know that, boy.

616
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,672
(bangs)

617
00:35:33,706 --> 00:35:36,741
That is enough evidence for today.

618
00:35:36,775 --> 00:35:40,309
<i>I will now retire and consider my ruling.</i>

619
00:35:40,343 --> 00:35:43,114
You have no right to sit in judgment.

620
00:35:43,148 --> 00:35:44,582
No?

621
00:35:44,616 --> 00:35:46,616
I am the authority here.

622
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:49,421
The only authority I
recognize is that of God's,

623
00:35:49,455 --> 00:35:51,023
and you, sir, are not He.

624
00:35:51,057 --> 00:35:52,525
Reverend, I believe this proceeding...

625
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:54,092
No, no, no. It's all right.

626
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:55,260
Let him speak.

627
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:58,267
This will be his last sermon.

628
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:07,010
A man may believe

629
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:09,348
in freedom from tyranny

630
00:36:09,382 --> 00:36:13,622
and not be rebel or a traitor.

631
00:36:13,657 --> 00:36:17,593
If he is not free to make up his own mind,

632
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:20,597
that is the worst form of tyranny.

633
00:36:20,631 --> 00:36:23,334
- Aye.
- Hear, hear.

634
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:27,720
These men were sent here to subjugate us.

635
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:33,392
But I never would've expected

636
00:36:33,427 --> 00:36:36,732
the boy who grew up best friends

637
00:36:36,766 --> 00:36:38,833
with my son Benjamin

638
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:41,469
to turn against his own.

639
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:43,507
(murmuring)

640
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:47,876
Abraham, what did you do

641
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:51,216
that day your father
walked out of my church?

642
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,285
You stayed behind.

643
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:57,152
You thought for yourself.

644
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,119
A lesson for us all.

645
00:37:01,154 --> 00:37:03,720
<i>(crowd clamoring)</i>

646
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,757
That is enough.

647
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,725
<i>Silence! Take the prisoners down.</i>

648
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,530
<i>Take them down now, to the tavern cellar.</i>

649
00:37:22,996 --> 00:37:27,464
Abraham, I wanted to commend
you on your efforts today.

650
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:29,133
I think your father would be very proud.

651
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:30,768
Oh, thank you, sir.

652
00:37:32,271 --> 00:37:34,672
Have you reached a decision?

653
00:37:34,706 --> 00:37:36,341
I have.

654
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:40,144
I expect Mr. Appleton's
labors will not go unrewarded.

655
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:41,778
To tell you the truth,
I would like nothing more

656
00:37:41,812 --> 00:37:43,945
than to hang these miscreants.

657
00:37:43,979 --> 00:37:47,843
But given the confusion
of today's proceeding,

658
00:37:47,878 --> 00:37:50,477
I think it best to show
that measure of mercy

659
00:37:50,512 --> 00:37:52,881
that you spoke of, Abraham.

660
00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:56,317
So, I am sentencing them all to a term

661
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,921
of no less than 10 years on the Jersey.

662
00:37:58,956 --> 00:38:02,457
Um, sir... ahem... if I may.

663
00:38:02,492 --> 00:38:04,993
Given the conditions aboard that ship,

664
00:38:05,028 --> 00:38:06,564
that is a death sentence.

665
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:08,534
You think a hanging more merciful?

666
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:09,935
No, no.

667
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,471
It's just that what happened today...

668
00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:14,576
the business with the rifle...

669
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:17,678
So he used a different weapon
than the one he turned in.

670
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,448
He's clever, I'll grant him that.

671
00:38:19,482 --> 00:38:20,951
Or perhaps he's innocent.

672
00:38:20,985 --> 00:38:23,322
I acknowledge that there are
untidy aspects to this case,

673
00:38:23,356 --> 00:38:26,258
and perhaps some were
overzealous in pursuing it.

674
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:28,959
<i>But the most important thing</i>

675
00:38:28,993 --> 00:38:32,526
<i>is that an arm of disloyal
citizens have been identified</i>

676
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:36,163
and the gangrenous limb will now be cut off

677
00:38:36,197 --> 00:38:37,899
from the rest of the healthy body.

678
00:38:37,934 --> 00:38:41,069
There's just one problem, sir.

679
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,538
It seems to me that the true
assassin may still be out there.

680
00:38:46,572 --> 00:38:50,510
I shall make it my mission to find him out.

681
00:38:57,249 --> 00:38:59,051
<i>Caleb: I can't feel my legs anymore.</i>

682
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:03,454
Let alone something
else of equal importance.

683
00:39:03,488 --> 00:39:07,091
(chuckles) How much further to Ridgefield?

684
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:08,762
No more than a day.

685
00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:11,600
I sent a scout ahead to alert
General Arnold of our arrival.

686
00:39:11,634 --> 00:39:14,800
Oh, of course you have.

687
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:17,633
Now, look, don't be
injured if Benedict Arnold

688
00:39:17,668 --> 00:39:21,201
ain't as excited to meet the
famous Benny Boy Tallmadge.

689
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:24,173
I will admit, the man impresses.

690
00:39:24,207 --> 00:39:26,175
Imagine having your horse
shot out from under you,

691
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:29,045
your leg pinned beneath it,
and instead of surrendering

692
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:31,281
to the regular standing
above you with a bayonet,

693
00:39:31,316 --> 00:39:33,484
you pull his pistol and shoot him dead.

694
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:37,286
Yeah, it sounds like a
tale I'd tell about me self,

695
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:41,094
which tells me he's
taking a bit of license.

696
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,528
Company, halt!

697
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:45,665
<i>- Man: Company halt!
- Man 2: Company halt!</i>

698
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:46,966
Private.

699
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:49,037
Caught him hiding in a ditch.

700
00:39:49,071 --> 00:39:51,608
<i>Thought he might be a spy, but
when he said he was from Setauket...</i>

701
00:39:51,643 --> 00:39:53,109
Let him down.

702
00:40:01,117 --> 00:40:02,817
- Mr. Havens.
- Ben.

703
00:40:02,851 --> 00:40:04,584
(both laugh)

704
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:07,220
Walt, look at you. How are ya?

705
00:40:07,255 --> 00:40:09,124
What brings you to Connecticut?

706
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:11,394
A bloody-back named Simcoe.

707
00:40:11,429 --> 00:40:13,327
Ever since he returned to Setauket,

708
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:15,328
he's had it in for us Whigs.

709
00:40:15,363 --> 00:40:17,961
Your father's been arrested, Ben.

710
00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:21,164
- My father?
- And Lucas Brewster, too.

711
00:40:21,198 --> 00:40:23,598
Your father, my uncle.

712
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:24,999
That's quite the coincidence.

713
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:26,466
On what grounds could he be arrested?

714
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,967
Conspiracy.

715
00:40:28,002 --> 00:40:29,802
I left town to cheat the hangman.

716
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:31,970
I doubt the rest will be so lucky.

717
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:38,571
How many whaleboats could you round up?

718
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:39,805
What do you mean?

719
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,845
- To carry all this lot?
- Aye.

720
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,080
We're going home?

721
00:40:47,115 --> 00:40:49,213
We're going home.

722
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,323
Thank you, Luke.

723
00:41:05,094 --> 00:41:07,631
All right, sweetheart, we'll go upstairs.

724
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,467
Time for your nap.

725
00:41:48,665 --> 00:41:51,599
<i>(Mary grunting)</i>

726
00:41:56,008 --> 00:41:59,342
<i>(Mary panting)</i>

727
00:41:59,376 --> 00:42:01,514
<i>- (board thudding)
- Thomas!</i>

728
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,316
Thomas, stop it.

729
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,283
Thomas.
