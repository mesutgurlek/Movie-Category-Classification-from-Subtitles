NARRATOR:
<i>In the year 1807...</i>

2
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:22,973
<i>... a small ship of the Royal Navy set sail</i>
<i>from England for a secret destination.</i>

3
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:27,010
<i>With five million French</i>
<i>and Spanish soldiers...</i>

4
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:29,086
<i>... poised on the continent</i>
<i>under Napoleon...</i>

5
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:34,204
<i>... nothing could save England</i>
<i>from invasion except her 300 ships.</i>

6
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:40,363
<i>HMS</i> Lydia <i>was soon far beyond</i>
<i>battle-charged Europe.</i>

7
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:47,089
<i>Under the most secret of sealed orders,</i>
<i>she sailed deep into southern waters...</i>

8
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:50,213
<i>... fought her way around the Horn...</i>

9
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:57,173
<i>... headed north again, into the Pacific.</i>

10
00:01:57,535 --> 00:02:01,369
<i>For seven months,</i>
<i>she stayed out of sight of land.</i>

11
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,608
<i>Becalmed finally...</i>

12
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:08,769
<i>... her weary crew toiled at the oars in</i>
<i>the vain hope of towing her into a wind.</i>

13
00:02:08,935 --> 00:02:13,167
<i>They thirsted and hungered</i>
<i>and wondered where she was going...</i>

14
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:17,089
<i>... what she would do</i>
<i>when she got there, if she got there.</i>

15
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:20,770
<i>These were things</i>
<i>known only to one man aboard.</i>

What are we doing in the Pacific,

There's islands there

Brown-skinned girls, bread growing
on trees, where the <i>Bounty</i> went.

Why don't you ask Hornblower
to take us there?

30
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:04,011
What's wrong with our cargo
doing the asking?

31
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:07,212
Muskets and ammunition.
Who for? Why not for us?

Come on, get on with your work.
Get on with it.

- Me throat's closing up on me.

- Mr. Bush.
- Thank you.

38
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,173
How much do you suppose
he's paced the deck since Plymouth, sir?

39
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:47,647
Well, an hour a day at three knots,
and we're 201 days out.

40
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:50,409
I'd say the distance
between Plymouth and Aberdeen.

41
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:52,247
I'd like to know what he's thinking.

What would you think about?

A rotting ship
and 10,000 miles from a friendly port.

Do you know why I'm having
Hommel flogged, Mr. Gerard?

I reported him for fighting, sir.

I'm not having him flogged
for fighting, Mr. Gerard.

58
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:33,250
I'm having him flogged because you said
in front of the men that you'd flog him.

This is a ship of war.

As its captain, I must uphold
my lieutenant's authority.

I understand, sir.

62
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:44,047
Flogging only makes a bad man worse,
Mr. Gerard.

63
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:47,013
And it can break a good man's spirit.

64
00:05:47,175 --> 00:05:48,608
Is Hommel a bad man?

65
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,570
Aside from his temper, sir,
he's a good sailor.

66
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:55,648
A good sailor, ill-fed and thirsty.

Watch the cat
as it cuts his back to pieces, Mr. Gerard.

And in future,
perhaps you'll think twice...

He was a good topman.

You'll lose more than Hazlitt if you don't
put ashore for fresh food and water.

Dig into your medical kit

There's no need to stammer, Mr. Gerard.
No, we are not towing ashore.

Did you say something, Mr. Crystal?

...and Spanish charts
that aren't to be trusted...

106

...we can be 300 miles
out of our reckoning.

She's been informed of your arrival, sir.

Your exploits at sea, captain,
have made you quite famous.

811
01:12:25,055 --> 01:12:28,013
When you make your report
to the Admiralty you'll probably find...

812
01:12:28,175 --> 01:12:30,973
...that you've something better
to command than this little 38-gunner.

I did little to deserve it.

814
01:12:32,615 --> 01:12:34,685
It's my belief
that you were very fortunate...

815
01:12:34,855 --> 01:12:39,326
...to sink the <i>Natividad</i>,
having first given her away as you did.

01:12:39,495 --> 01:12:42,692
- On your own initiative.
- Seemed the best thing to do at the time.

817
01:12:42,855 --> 01:12:46,530
The captain of a frigate
doesn't normally decide Admiralty policy.

818
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,573
There was no way of consulting
the Admiralty, or I'd have done so.

I stood ready to answer
for my action, sir.

821
01:12:56,975 --> 01:12:59,535
Had you been serving under me,
you'd have answered for it.

822
01:12:59,695 --> 01:13:03,324
A court martial might have considered
your action irresponsible.

823
01:13:03,495 --> 01:13:06,453
It caused you to risk the life
of the Duke of Wellington's sister.

824

I apologize for that, sir.

01:13:09,015 --> 01:13:12,007
It would have gone very hard with you
had anything happened to her.

We're to be married.

Yes, so Lady Barbara has told me, sir.

01:13:18,695 --> 01:13:20,970
I suppose a ship of this size
is rather confining...

829
01:13:21,135 --> 01:13:25,128

than under normal circumstances.

Oh, very good, Mr. Bush.
Acknowledge, and clear away the gig.

Well, gentlemen,
now that we are finally all assembled...

918
01:21:57,095 --> 01:22:00,167
...I've some fairly startling news
that has been sent to me by cutter.

919
01:22:00,335 --> 01:22:02,895
The French have broken
Macartney's blockade at Brest.

920
01:22:04,175 --> 01:22:07,451
The old boy supposedly had Napoleon's
ships completely bottled up in here.

921
01:22:07,615 --> 01:22:09,571
A pea-soup fog settled in for 48 hours.

922
01:22:09,735 --> 01:22:11,965
When it lifted,
four ships had slipped away.

923
01:22:12,135 --> 01:22:13,568
Any idea what course they took?

924
01:22:13,735 --> 01:22:16,454
The only place they could go
is to the Mediterranean.

925
01:22:16,615 --> 01:22:20,847
So if we proceed from our position here,
stand well out into the bay...

926
01:22:21,015 --> 01:22:22,653
...we'll intercept them about here.

927
01:22:22,815 --> 01:22:25,045
Four against four,
the outcome's obvious.

You don't seem to agree,
Captain Hornblower.

930
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:30,885
Where else would they go
except the Mediterranean?

931
01:22:31,055 --> 01:22:33,933
- I submit, sir, here.
LEIGHTON: North of Spain?

932
01:22:34,095 --> 01:22:35,574
Nonsense. Why should they?

933
01:22:35,735 --> 01:22:38,374
Napoleon's army has already
been pushed deep into Spain...

934
01:22:38,535 --> 01:22:39,809
...by the Duke of Wellington.

935
01:22:39,975 --> 01:22:42,125
If I were Napoleon, sir,
I'd consider it a good idea...

936
01:22:42,295 --> 01:22:44,604
...to thrust from the northeast,
behind the duke.

937
01:22:44,775 --> 01:22:46,003
And supply them by sea?

938
01:22:46,175 --> 01:22:48,370
Better than hauling over
the Pyrenees, I'd say.

939
01:22:48,535 --> 01:22:50,890
The French wouldn't risk four ships
on such a wild gamble.

940

What does Napoleon care
about ships, sir...

941
01:22:52,935 --> 01:22:55,051
...except to help him
in his military operations?

942
01:22:55,215 --> 01:22:57,968
I submit most urgently, sir,
that instead of standing out to sea...

943
01:22:58,135 --> 01:22:59,966
...we move north
along the French coast.

Admiralty if they got to the Mediterranean.

LEIGHTON: Hmm.

946
01:23:05,495 --> 01:23:08,612
Perhaps we could take care of both
possibilities with a wide deployment.

947

Good idea, Sylvester. You see, I've no
objection to a practical suggestion.

949

has the shallowest draught?

a prize or two, eh?

in private code.

Thank you. May I call your attention
to the gallant behavior...

...of my first lieutenant, Mr. Bush?
- Indeed you may.

Mr. Bush, the greatest pleasure
of an admiral is to reward good conduct.

I'm promoting you to captain.

...I'm sure he'd have recommended it
in his last report.

- His last report, sir?
- Of course, you couldn't have known.

He was killed at La Teste. Great loss.
