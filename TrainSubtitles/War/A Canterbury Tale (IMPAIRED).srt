<i>- [Alison] I'm going to work on Mr. Colpeper's-
- [Man] May I see your identity card?</i>

145
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,988
<i>[Bob] Identity card nothing.!
What kind of a cop are you?</i>

146
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,190
<i>- [Whispers] American.
- [Man] Anything the matter, miss?</i>

147
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,860
- Matter?
- Somebody's poured some sticky stuff on my hair.

148
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:48,269
<i>- Sergeant, the Glue Man's out again.
- [Whistle Blows]</i>

149
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,673
While you're looking us up
in the Domesday Book, he's making a getaway.

150
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,972
<i>- [Woman] Door there.!
- And what about my hair?</i>

151
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,742
- Just a minute, if you please. One thing at a time.
- [Groans]

152
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,341
- Are you the incident, miss?
- Yes. Look. My hair's full of it.

153
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,047
<i>- [Man] Oh, it's the Glue Man, all right.
- Glue Man?</i>

154
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:06,522
Let me have a look, deary.
Oh, we'll soon see to that, all right.

155
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,684
What is this,
an old Chillingbourne custom?

156
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,126
- He's in the town hall, Sergeant.
- Who is?

157
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,166
Your Glue Man. We chased him
down the street, and he's in this building.

158
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,428
<i>- [Man] Door there.!
- [Panting]</i>

159
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,073
What's up, Ernie?

160
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,869
- It's him, the Glue Man.
- Where?

161
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,578
I heard the whistle,
up on the church tower.

162
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,581
I ran all the way.
[Panting]

163
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:35,245
I ran - I - I dropped - bumped
into a soldier running across the square.

164
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,585
- He caught the Chartham bus.
- Nuts! That was Peter Gibbs.

165
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,854
- And who may he be?
- The soldier who was with us when it happened.

166
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,895
Well, why don't you
search the building?

167
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:48,194
You leave that to us, miss. We may be slow
in Chillingbourne compared with London ways...

168
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,168
and we ain't no G-men neither,
but we know our duty and we have our methods.

169
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,671
Ernie Brooks, you get back
to your fire-watching.

170
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,299
If you hear anything,
blow your whistle, as arranged.

171
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:01,106
- All right, Bertie.
- Sergeant Bassett when on duty, if you please.

172
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,410
Constable Ovenden, you will accompany me
on a tour of the building.

173
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,645
You will kindly stay here with the young lady.
Uh, sergeant, is it?

174
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,483
Yeah. SergeantJohnson.
Say, can't I come too?

175
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,217
This guy may be dangerous.
Have you got a gun?

176
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:16,954
This is Chillingbourne, SergeantJohnson,
not Chicago.

177
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,930
- Better use your torch.
- Say, what kind of a crack is that?
I come from Oregon.

178
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,072
[Ovenden] Getting tired
of this old Glue Man spoiling our games.

179
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,111
<i>[Bassett] You shouldn't be.
It saves you money the way you play.</i>

180
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,806
<i>[Ovenden Grumbles]</i>

181
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,383
I wonder when they're gonna
give us our electric light.

182
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,651
Oi. There's a light in the courtroom.

183
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,786
- There's someone in there.
- Yeah.

184
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,731
- Ready?
- Yes.

185
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,768
Come on.
Let's take him by surprise.

186
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,902
- Anything wrong, Bassett?
- Sorry, Mr. Colpeper.

187
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,241
[Ovenden]
We didn't know you were still up here.

188
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:13,307
I see. All right. Can you make me a cup of tea?
I'm sure you've got a kettle on downstairs.

189
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,944
- Here's my cup.
- [Bassett] Yes, sir.

190
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,826
- Sir, the Glue Man's out again.
- How do you know?

191
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,897
An American soldier
and a girl chased him here, sir.

192
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,898
What girl? What American?

193
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,662
Well, the girl who was the incident, sir.
Isn't that right?

194
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,863
Yes, Sergeant.
She's come to work for you, sir.

195
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,635
On your farm.
She's a land girl.

196
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:40,371
There must be some mistake.
You say they chased the Glue Man here?

197
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,744
Yes, sir. They insist he's somewhere
inside this building.

198
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,080
Well, what are you standing
talking for, Bassett? Get on and search it.

199
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,154
Yes, sir.

200
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,026
[Whistles]

201
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,526
- Gee, what a job.
- Is it coming out?

202
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,430
- Beg your pardon, ma'am?
- Any better?

203
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,935
Well, I've got considerable on me,
so there must be less on you...

204
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,700
but there's still plenty on you.

205
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,775
Here you are, miss.

206
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,080
[Groans]

207
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,740
[Sighs]
What on earth am I to do?

208
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,977
Soap's no good.
Hot water's the only thing.

209
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,815
- Miss Grainger's boiling a kettle.
- You seem to be an expert.

210
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:27,552
- She's the 11 th incident.
- What about this glue-throwing character?

211
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:33,191
Captain, you don't mean to say
you let him get away from you?

212
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,824
He got away- if ever he were inside.

213
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,597
- Now we shan't be long, deary.
- Nice work.

214
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,104
Put another kettle on, Miss Grainger,
and make some tea.

215
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,868
Mr. Colpeper's fire-watching.
Oi. Here's his cup.

216
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,002
- Who's Mr. Colpeper?
- Magistrate. Wants to see you.

217
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,478
Oh, he does?
Okay, ma'am?

218
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,880
- Mmm.
- Let's give it another whirl with the hot water.

219
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,317
I guess Mr. Colpeper can wait a while.

220
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,912
Here. We know how to handle this.

221
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,354
Still a bit sticky, sir.
Glad to meet you.

222
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,591
Welcome to Chillingbourne.
You're the first American soldier we've seen.

223
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,726
- Bad luck missing your train, Sergeant, uh -
- Johnson, sir.

224
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,804
Johnson.

225
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,143
- Say, what's that?
- That's the old ducking stool.

226
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,882
Very sensibly used
for silencing talkative women.

227
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,118
<i>[Footsteps Approaching]</i>

231
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,595
Excuse me.

232
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,571
<i>- That you, Brooks?
- [Brooks] You're showing a light, sir.</i>

233
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,078
Sorry, Brooks.

234
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,439
Very careless of me.
We take our blackout seriously in East Kent.

235
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,213
This your first time in England?

236
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,688
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Do you like it?</i>

237
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:10,183
Sure, but I haven't seen
much else but Salisbury.

238
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,389
<i>You've seen something if you've seen Salisbury.
It's a fine town.</i>

239
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,300
Yeah. It's got some swell movies.

240
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:21,271
<i>Really? You're a great moviegoer,
SergeantJohnson?</i>

241
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,740
You bet. It's a great thing
to sit back in an armchair...

242
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,175
and watch the world go by
in front of you.

243
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,179
The drawback is, SergeantJohnson...

244
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,717
that people may get used to looking
at the world from the sitting position.

245
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,048
I don't quite get you.

246
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:38,453
Then when they really do pass through it,
they don't see anything.

247
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,254
Shall you be
going to a movie in Canterbury?

248
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,925
Is there anything good on?

249
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:52,094
This voucher will get you a room
in the Hand of Glory. That's the inn.

250
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,638
One of the men will take you over.
There's nothing to pay.

251
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,699
- Thanks. That's swell of you, but I can pay.
- No, no. You're our guest for tonight.

252
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,770
Okay. Thanks a lot.

253
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,144
That's all right.

- Pity.
- Pity?

255
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:10,482
Pity when you get home and people ask you
what you've seen in England, you'll say...

256
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,285
"Well, I saw a movie in Salisbury...

257
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,725
and I made a pilgrimage to Canterbury
and saw another one."

258
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,729
You've got me all wrong.

259
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:22,358
I know that in Canterbury
I have to look out for a cathedral.

260
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:26,302
Do look out for it. It's just behind
the movie theater. You can't miss it.

- Yes, Mr. Colpeper.</i>

And ask the young lady to come in.

- Miss Smith.

270
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,391
I've been sent by
the War Agricultural Committee.

271
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,329
I wish they'd telephone
before they send people.

272
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,864
You wrote. They sent me.

273
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,900
I want a farm laborer.

274
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,994
You have to take
what you can get these days.

275
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,369
You've got me.
I can do the work.

276
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,442
I'm sorry, Miss Smith.

277
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,404
You refuse to employ me
because I'm a girl?

278
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,041
Miss Smith, there's a camp
near this village full of soldiers.

279
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,312
<i>- I know.
- Oh, you know?</i>

280
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,752
I'm not interested in soldiers.

281
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,690
- Perhaps they're interested in you.
- Let them. They mean nothing to me.

282
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,057
Aren't you afraid to stay here?

283
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,062
Why should I be afraid?

284
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,428
<i>- After what's happened to you.

- Didn't you hear it?
- What?

286
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,573
Somebody moved. In there.

287
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,610
<i>Nonsense.</i>

288
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,679
It isn't nonsense.

289
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:22,176
- Somebody's there.
- How could there be?

<i>That stone interest you, miss?</i>

307
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,257
<i>It comes from the old road...</i>

Three years ago.

Ah. Then it weren't our bend you saw.
It weren't uncobbled then.

No, but the bend was there all the same.

- Yeah. The whole bend.

We changed our magistrate.

How do you know about our bend?

322
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,112
I spent the whole
of my holiday here once.

<i>I don't call you to mind.</i>

We camped outside the village
in a caravan.

Uh -There ain't been
no caravanners up by our bend...

No. He was my fiance.

Your room's ready.

- Is his nameJohnson?
- Are you the girl?

336
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,568
Yes. We washed it,
but it's still full of glue.

337
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,638
Revolting.

338

- Silly, I call it.

339
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,066
You'll have to wash your hair again,

Gee, ma'am. I didn't know
you were stopping here too.

346
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:30,961
- Why didn't you tell me last night?
- Well, I didn't know myself. I didn't get that job.

347
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,970
- Sorry about the job.
- Oh, never mind about that. What I want -

348
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:37,166
Let's see now.
Since you didn't get the job...

349
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,835
that means you're
going in with me on the 8:57?

350
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,379
That's just what I wanted
to talk to you about.

351
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:46,247
Bob, would you mind very much
not catching the 8:57?

352
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:49,286
Would I mind?
I've got to meet a buddy in London.

353
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,582
- Well -
- And I want to get to Canterbury first.

354
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,682
- I promised Ma.
- Well, we can go in on the evening train together.

355
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,421
- And I've written to Peter Gibbs.
- What's he got to do with it?

356
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,930
"Dear Sergeant Gibbs, you'll have heard
by now that the Glue Man got away.

357
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:04,229
- But he didn't get far."
- Hmm? You mean they've got him?

358
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,203
- No.
- What kind of a quiz is this?

359
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,239
You met Mr. Colpeper, didn't you?

360
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:13,573
Yes. He got me this room.
And a swell room it is. What about him?

361
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,612
There's something about him
I don't like.

362
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,809
- And he's got a Home Guard uniform.

Oh, don't laugh, Bob. What I want to do
is to snoop around in the village.

364
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,022
Peter can do that at the camp.

And I want you to help me, Bob.

366

00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,109
[Chuckles]
You better remember that...

440
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,203
just in case Susanna Foster asks you
what was wrong with the wheel.

441
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,214
Thank you.

442
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,341
Mr. Horton, what was
your job before the war?

443
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:31,752
<i>Mine? I've been
a blacksmith for 37 years.</i>

444
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,222
My father was a blacksmith
and his before him.

445
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:37,624
I was selling things
in a department store before the war.

446
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,529
I wonder how you would look
behind a counter, Mr. Horton.

447
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,363
<i>- [Man] Horton behind a counter?
- [All Laughing]</i>

448
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,972
<i>- American army, eh?
- BobJohnson's the name.</i>

449
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,041
- Sergeant, ain't ya?
- Mmm.

450
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:55,010
[Chuckles] This is, uh,
Sergeant BobJohnson of the American army.

451
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,138
- Morning, folks.
- [All] Morning.

452
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,408
- Morning.
- Morning.

453
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,418
Nice place you've got here.

454
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,718
- So you didn't catch the 8:57.
- No, ma'am.

455
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,850
You look as though
you belong around here already.

456
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,156
- Do I?
- Sure do.

457
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,823
I thought I'd stick around today myself.

458
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,401
Thought I might have a chat
with Mr. Colpeper.

459
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:21,700
<i>I hear he knows a lot
about the old Pilgrims'Road.</i>

460
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:25,333
Ah. So you're interested
in that old road, are you?

461
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,345
Well, the wheel's finished. What are you
standing round for? Put her on the cart.

462
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:35,215
Yes, sir. I'm crazy about that old road
and... those old Canterbury pilgrims.

463
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,811
Ah. Them was the days
for a wheelwright.

464
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,891
Mind that strut, boy.
Have you got the linchpin, Ned?

465
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,892
<i>- Yeah.
- [Jim] George?</i>

466
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,962
<i>[Man]
Yes?</i>

467
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:49,159
- Did you hear the news last night, Mr. Horton?
- There wasn't nothing on the wireless.

468
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:52,828
<i>Oh, no. I didn't mean that sort of news.
I mean what happened here last night.</i>

469
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,872
We get all our local news at 6:00, miss.

470
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,034
You got a local newspaper?

471
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:03,637
- No. That's when the pub opens.
- [All Laughing]

472
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,550
What happened?

473
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:11,816
- Your Glue Man was on the warpath last night.
- Who was he after this time?

474
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,857
<i>- [Alison] Me.
- Oh. You.</i>

475
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,893
I suppose that'll learn you
not to run around at night.

476
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,829
On the contrary. I shall go out
every night until I catch him.

477
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,832
Aren't likely.

478
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,926
Come on then.
Get her down.

479
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,912
[Alison]
Back.

480
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,372
Can I give you a hand there, ma'am?

481
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,644
<i>[Alison]
Thanks, Bob. I'd rather do it alone.</i>

482
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,887
Back.

483
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,225
<i>[Bob]
Elm.</i>

484
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,395
<i>[Jim]
Yeah. And chestnut.</i>

485
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:04,498
- Do you get much sweating in your elm planks?
- Oh, average.

486
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,975
At home we build two at a time.

487
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,978
For steadiness. Side by side.

488
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,379
Well, so do us.
To tie them longer strips together.

489
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:16,510
<i>- Sewn last winter.
- Is that how you do it in America?</i>

490
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,749
It's how we do it
in my part of America.

491
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:23,725
But we take off the strips
when we put the planks away in stock.

492
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,126
Well, so do us.

493
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,391
How long do you allow
for seasoning timber?

494
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:32,560
- Ayear for every inch of thickness.
- Same here. [Chuckles]

495
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,797
You can't hurry an elm.

496
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,398
<i>- No. But some folks try to, all the same.
- Yeah. Capitalists.</i>

497
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,444
Can't stand to see
their money lie idle a piece.

498
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,480
<i>- And the war.
- Why the war?</i>

499
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,948
Folks go mad.
They cut oak at midsummer.

500
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,951
<i>- No.
- I'm telling you, yes.</i>

501
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:50,953
- Oak should be cut in winter.
- Course.

502
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,488
- Or the spring.
- That's right.

503
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,286
- And beech in the fall.
- And plank it out -

504
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,293
- At Christmas.
- Yeah.

505
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:01,058
- That's how my dad taught me.
- Ah. You was well brought up.

506
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,360
- In the timber business, was you?
- Lumber.

507
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:07,097
- Oh.
- My granddad had the first mill in our parts.

508
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,332
- Yeah.
- Dad - He was a cabinetmaker.

509
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,500
I cut my teeth on wood shavings.

510
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,875
<i>[Jim Chuckles]
Cut his teeth on wood-[Chuckles]</i>

511
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:21,317
Dad - He made my cradle
out of cedar of Lebanon.

512
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,853
He said what was
good enough for Solomon...

513
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,254
was good enough
for a Johnson ofJohnson County.

514
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,850
Gee, I can smell that cedar now.

515
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,638
Ah.

516
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,906
Can I bum a ride off you, ma'am?

517
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,036
- Jump in.
- Looks like a good way to see the sights.

518
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,116
Just a minute, missy.
We have our dinner at midday.

519
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:56,482
I'd like to have you join us, Sergeant.
That is if you ain't got nothing better to do.

520
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,556
- Thanks a lot. I'd be glad to.
- Ah, that'll be fine.

521
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,625
Get up.

522
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,263
Hey, Mother?

523
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:09,026
- Yes, Jim?
- One extra for dinner.

524
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:13,593
- I was thinking of a cottage pie, Jim.
- Ah, well, think of a good big un.

525
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:25,607
Nice piece of weatherboarding,
that water mill.

526
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:28,048
I must ask the old gentleman
who built it.

527
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,120
I'll bet it was a Horton.

528
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:33,213
How did you manage
to get round Mr. Horton in that way?

529
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,588
I believe you are a detective.

530
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,718
We speak the same language.

531
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,262
I'm English,
and I don't speak their language.

532
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,060
He knows about wood, see,
and so do I.

533
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,829
- That's it.
- That was it.

534
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,435
Oh, look at that house.

535
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,252
<i>What a perfect place.</i>

536
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:06,779
<i>I wonder whose it is...
and what it's like at the back.</i>

537
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,828
<i>Whoa.</i>

538
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,193
<i>[Crows Squawking]</i>

539
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:22,602
What wouldn't I give
to grow old in a place like that.

540
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,766
<i>[Bell Clanging]</i>

541
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,775
<i>[Woman]
Tom.</i>

542
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,868
<i>Breakfast.</i>

[Clicks Tongue]

544

<i>[Alison]
Beats me.</i>

545
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,483
<i>Last night I could have
believed anything.</i>

546
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,494
But this morning...

547
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,531
if ever a man
looked - looked right, he did.

548
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,101
[Bob]
Yeah. It don't add up.

549
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,102
[Alison]
Whoa.

550
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,264
[Bob] But, you know, Alison,
things don't add up in life.

551
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,605
Look, Bob.
Are you positively off tonight?

552
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,679
Positively.
But I'll see you before I go...

553
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,216
and tell you what I find out
from old Jim Horton.

554
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:09,650
What I'll find to do the rest
of the afternoon I don't know.

555
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:12,154
There's a movie.
It's Saturday. They have a matinee.

556
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:15,555
What? Go to a single feature?
Not me.

557
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,790
- Write some postcards.
- I'll have to do that to the folks from Canterbury.

558
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,832
- Write to your girl.
- I don't write my girl anymore.

559
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:26,096
How do you expect her to write to you
if you don't write to her?

560
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,103
You've got that in reverse English.

561
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:32,232
She doesn't write to me anymore,
so I don't write to her.

562
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,312
- That's the way it is.
- That's the way it is.

563
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,313
Perhaps she has written.

564
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,077
I haven't had a letter in seven weeks.

565
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:43,585
Sometimes the mail's lost by enemy action.
A ship might have gone down.

566
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,179
Yes. A ship might have gone down...

567
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,224
the address might have been wrong...

568
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,159
there are a hell of a lot
ofJohnsons in the army...

569
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:54,493
maybe she was ill,
maybe her mother was ill.

570
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,566
I've had all the maybes.

571
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,632
I cabled her.
I haven't heard a thing.

572
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,367
She was a swell girl, Alison.

573
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,376
We used to talk.

574
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,776
She liked the woods.

575
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,317
She learned some of the birdcalls
I taught her real well for a girl.

576
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,784
She caught her first rainbow
with my rod.

577
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,855
Two and a half pounds.

578
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,924
She broiled it herself.

579
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:26,389
We've been walking in the woods often,
following the trail...

580
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,466
and haven't said a word
for two hours...

581
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,365
and then both said
the same thing together.

582
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,496
What do you figure it means
when that happens?

583
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:39,506
It means love.

584
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,204
It means no letter in seven weeks.

585
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:46,145
I don't believe this enemy action stuff.

586
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,617
All the other fellas
get letters from their girls.

587
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,620
If a ship goes down,
it can't just be...

588
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:56,318
that particular part of the ship where
my letters are dumped that goes down, can it?

589
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,729
Well...

590
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,799
so long, Alison.

591
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,301
I hope you don't mind my calling you
by your first name.

592
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,531
I shall miss being called ma'am.

593
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,802
Time marches on.
Which way does your road go...

594
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,809
ma'am?

595
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:17,347
He knows.
I hope up that hill.

596
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:21,714
<i>- [Bob] Why that hill?
- That's where the Pilgrims'Road runs.</i>

597
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:25,585
<i>- Along that hill?
- Yes.</i>

598
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:29,056
<i>From the bend
at the eastern edge of the hill...</i>

599
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,253
pilgrims saw Canterbury
for the first time.

600
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,830
- You've seen it?
- Yes.

601
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,765
With a friend of mine.

602
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,665
- Boy or a girl?
- Boy.

603
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,567
I hope he writes to you.

604
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,007
No, he doesn't.

605
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:49,205
Maybe the mail was lost by enemy action.

606
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,281
No, Bob.

607
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:55,011
As it happens,
he was lost by enemy action.

608
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,121
<i>- He was a pilot.
- Shot down?</i>

609
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:02,920
- Yes.
- Sorry.

610
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,995
[Clicks Tongue]

611
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,877
[Alison]
I hope you'll have better luck.

612
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,250
<i>Get up.</i>

613
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,860
<i>[Alison]
Whoa.</i>

614
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,756
I'm Prudence Honeywood.
My sister telephoned you were coming.

615
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:43,026
Glad to see you.
We're shorthanded here.

616
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:48,035
- Smiler brought you along all right, I hope.
- Yes, Miss Honeywood.

617
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,436
- Not afraid of work, are you?
- No.

618
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,065
- Can you tie sheaves?
- Yes.

619
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,268
- Cart muck?
- Yes.

620
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:54,537
- Lift potatoes?
- Yes.

621
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,044
- Lead a harrow?
- Not very straight.

622
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,046
Neither can I.
Can you spud wheat?

623
00:41:58,148 --> 00:41:59,615
- Yes.
- Spread lime?

624
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,345
- If I have to.
- You'll have to. Know anything about hops?

625
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,353
- Not a thing.
- Hmm.

626
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,652
Most of the hands are in the fields today.
You'd better stay here this morning.

627
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,386
You can put your bag in that shed.
See you a little later.

628
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,167
Sue tells me you had
a frightening experience last night.

629
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,328
Wasn't frightening.
It was just unpleasant.

630
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,564
<i>- Hmm.
- And annoying.</i>

631
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:26,268
I thought so. It's happened to other girls.
None of them died.

632
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,141
My sister likes to dramatize things.
You know the type.

633
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:32,477
- Do I know them.
- Well, do you or don't you?

634
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:35,780
- I worked in a London store before the war.
- Selling things?

635
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,081
Yes. Garden furniture.

636
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,122
Picnic baskets.
All that sort of thing.

637
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,522
- Did you like the job?
- Not much.

638
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,227
It was better than
selling ordinary furniture.

639
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,163
I used to imagine my deck chairs
in beautiful gardens...

640
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,734
and my picnic baskets
opened in the woods and fields.

641
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,235
So you like gardens and the country?

642
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,306
Mmm.

643
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:00,542
[Cow Moos]

644
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:03,078
Hope you won't miss
your London store here.

645
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,410
I shan't.

646
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,450
You get up at sunrise.

647
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:11,214
But you don't have to queue for the bus.
It's hot and sweaty this time of the year.

648
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,756
- You should see the stores in August.
- Hmm.

649
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:17,224
- The flies are the very devil.
- So were the customers.

650
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:21,763
That's your room over there.
The end one.

651
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:26,325
<i>- You won't get much of a view, I'm afraid.
- You should have seen the view
from my room in London.</i>

652
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:31,602
Was it a long street with every house
a different sort of sadness in it?

653
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,973
It was a long row of back gardens...

654
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:36,273
and the tall, sad houses
were all the same.

655
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,008
<i>- Ghastly in winter.
- Airless in summer.</i>

656
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:43,644
<i>- You seem to know them.
- The only man who ever asked me to marry him
wanted me to live in a house like that.</i>

657
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,758
I'm still a maid.

658
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,656
<i>- Miss Honeywood.
- Call me Pru. You might as well.</i>

659
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:57,700
I don't like Prudence -
name or quality.

660
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,827
Pru and Sue we've always been.
She likes Susanna.

661
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,998
You spoke of other girls who had
the same experience as I had last night.

662
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:07,373
- Do you know any of them?
- Yes, I have one working in the hopyards.

663
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,742
<i>- Fee Baker.
- I'd like to talk to her.</i>

664
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,213
Well, you'll see her
when you take their dinner down.

665
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:25,292
<i>- [Chicken Clucking]
- [Whistling]</i>

666
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,364
[Prudence]
That way.

667
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:46,116
Whoa there. Hold it.

668
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,619
[Gasps]

669
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:57,288
- What's for dinner?
- Scotch eggs and apple dumplings.

670
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,453
Good.

671
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:02,225
- You're Fee Baker, aren't you?
- And you're Alison Smith.

672
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,892
- Yes.
- Are you working for Pru?

673
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,902
Yes.

674
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,904
- Where are you from?
- London.

675
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:11,440
Oh, I've got an uncle in London.
He's a policeman.

676
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:15,376
His father was a policeman too. Very good dancer.
The uncle, not the father.

677
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,447
Are you fond of dancing?

678
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:22,178
Am I! There aren't many boys around here
who can tell their own feet from their partner's.

679
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,516
Lots of soldiers.
No good dancers among them?

680
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,522
I wouldn't go out with a soldier
for a hundred pounds.

681
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:31,492
- Why?
- The Glue Man's a soldier. Everybody knows that.

682
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:37,262
- He wears a soldier's uniform.
- And what makes a civilian a soldier? A uniform.

683
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:41,030
Besides, there weren't any old
Glue Man here before the soldiers came.

684
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,934
Suppose he isn't a soldier.

685
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,033
What are you driving at?

686
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:49,135
Suppose he's a civilian.

687
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,841
- Someone in the village.
- In uniform?

688
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,750
Supposing he wore a uniform to make
the girls afraid to go out with soldiers.

689
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,322
[Chuckles]
That might be any one of a dozen.

690
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,391
- Might be a glue woman.
- Why?

691
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,753
Don't be soft.

692
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,922
- Take Ernie's family.
- Who's Ernie? Another uncle?

693
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,192
No. My Ernie.
He's with the Eighth Army.

694
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,600
Do you think his family like me going out
with strange soldiers? But a girl must live.

695
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,173
I'm sure I'm right.

696
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,367
Well, suppose you are.
Where does it get you?

697
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,376
And why worry?
You weren't the first.

698
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,412
- Do you know the other girls?
- Of course.

699
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:26,813
There's Dorothy Bird. She's the post-girl.
Susan Cummings, Polly Finn -

700
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:29,147
Hold on a tick.
If nobody else cares...

701
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,983
I'm going to find out what can be done
about this glue business.

702
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,989
- I can tell you that.
- You can?

703
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,924
Hot water. Plenty of hot water.

704
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:51,500
<i>- [Alison] What's the idea, frightening my horse?
- I suppose you weren't scared.</i>

705
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:54,833
Why don't you keep your beastly carriers
off the Pilgrims' Road?

706
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:58,374
I know that voice. Hey, Alison.
This is Peter Gibbs.

707
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:01,467
I thought you didn't get that job.
Who'd you steal this cart from?

708
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,478
I'm working for Mrs. Foster.

709
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,378
And if you don't take your carriers
out of the road at once...

710
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:09,179
I'll tell her what happened,
and she'll report you to your C.O.

711
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,345
<i>- [All Laugh]
- It was the C.O.'s idea.</i>

712
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:14,549
We didn't know who was in the cart.
I didn't even know it was a girl.

713
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:18,253
- You're just an objective.
- I don't believe a word. And I'm in a hurry.

714
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:21,593
Well, we're not. You're our prisoner,
but we'll exchange you for some information.

715
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:25,759
What have you been up to? Have you got a plan?
What's Bob doing to earn his keep? Archie!

716
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,235
<i>This is Miss Alison Smith I told you about.</i>

717

<i>- Archie here had an Agnes.
- A Gwladys.</i>

718
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:35,138
- Go on, Archie. Tell the tale.
- Well, that's all there was to it. Love's young dream.

719
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,270
- Glue.
- What next?

720
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,576
<i>There wasn't any next.
She went home like a scalded cat.</i>

721
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:43,585
- And that was after dark?
- Conditions were perfect - until the Glue Man came.

722
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:47,248
- What was the girl's name?
- Gwladys. She spelt it with a "W." Class.

723
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,882
- Gwladys what?
- How should I know? Wasn't a lasting friendship.

724
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,790
<i>- [Gibbs] It happened to her.
- What date?</i>

725
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:55,296
Half a mo. Archie's my witness.
I'll get all the dope. Okay, Archie.

726
00:48:57,301 --> 00:49:00,862
<i>- And talking of dope.

00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,690
Aren't you in the army? Women's Land Army?
Isn't that H.M. Forces too?

736
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,700
- Yes, it is, but - but the lecture's tonight.
- What's wrong with tonight?

737
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,895
- I've got a job. I'm working here.
- You are? Good.

738
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,199
- And it's my first day.
- Well, what's wrong with it?

739
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,206
- Nothing.
- Well, can you be there?

740
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,471
- Yes. I suppose I can, if I finish in time.
- Well, can you finish in time?

741
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:44,638
- Yes. If it's important.
- Important? To detective work,
every clue's important.

742
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,648
- What clue?
- Did I say clue?

743
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,945
<i>- You did.
- I meant glue. Don't be late.</i>

744
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:23,216
<i>[Bob] "Not heaven itself
upon the past has power...</i>

745
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,550
<i>"but what has been has been...</i>

746
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:28,180
<i>and I have had my hour. "</i>

747
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,657
<i>[Chattering]</i>

748
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:41,236
Are you from the States?

749
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,774
- Yes.
- I got a brother there.

750
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,708
- That so?
- "Butt" City.

751
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:50,645
"Butt" City?

752
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:53,580
"Butt" City, Montana.

753
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,708
Oh, yes. Of course.

754
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:58,344
Name of Isaac Wells.
Maybe you know him.

755
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,089
- Tall fellow?
- Short and fat.

756
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:08,860
- Can't place him.
- Pity.

757
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:11,490
- Good evening.
- Evening.

758
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:14,695
- Coming to the lecture?
- Yes. In a minute, sir.

759
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:18,172
I come from
Three Sisters Falls, Oregon.

760
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:21,711
I come from the Seven Sisters Road,
London. Put it there.

761
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:26,010
Pleased to meet you. You sure are
a whole mess of sisters ahead of me.

762
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,186
[Chattering]

763
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,723
- Good evening.
- [All] Good evening.

764
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,919
I'm glad to see such a big house.

765
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,966
<i>The last time I was to speak- It was July the 11 th,
I think- there was an audience of one.</i>

766
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:48,265
He was reading his evening paper. I waited
for a bit. Then I asked him, "Uh, shall I start?"

767
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,272
He said, "Start what?"
I said, "Didn't you come to hear me lecture?"

768
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:54,104
- He said, "No, I'm waiting for the pubs to open."
- [All Laugh]

769
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:58,079
We waited till 5:30, then we adjourned
the lecture and both went to the pub.

770
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:01,241
Uh, would some of you mind
doing the blackout, please?

771
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,751
And I hope there are
going to be plenty of questions.

772
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:05,913
Will somebody
start the ball rolling now?

773
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:09,583
[Man] Yes, sir. May I ask why
you want to lecture us at all, sir?

774
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:11,593
[All Laugh]

775
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,856
Well, you see,
it's a form of human weakness.

776
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:18,230
It's only human nature when you hear something
interesting to want to pass it on to somebody else.

777
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:21,634
Well, I know a lot of interesting things
about this part of the country...

778
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,434
<i>and I feel the urge
to pass some of them on to you.</i>

779
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:28,776
Good evening. You'll find a place
at the back there, I think.

780
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:32,406
<i>Good evening, SergeantJohnson.
Would you like tojoin your two friends?</i>

781
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:36,077
<i>- Yes, sir.
- [Colpeper] Good evening, Miss Smith.</i>

782
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:39,587
- Good evening, Mr. Colpeper.
- Say, won't you come back and join us?

783
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:42,089
Well, uh, I wouldn't like to, uh, presume.

784
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:44,319
- Sure. Come on. We'd like it.
- Straight?

785
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:47,487
- Sure.
- Oh, that's very kind of you, I'm sure.
Don't mind if I do.

786
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,862
- Friend of mine.
- Good evening, all.

787
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:57,872
- [All] Evening.
- Good evening, Sergeant.

788
00:52:57,974 --> 00:52:59,874
- [Whispers] Big news.
- [Together] What?

789
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:01,876
- Tell you later.
- What about your train?

790
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,878
- Brother, you can take my-
- Shh!

791
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,642
I was born here,
and my father was born here.

792
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,650
You're here because there's a war on.

793
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:11,846
<i>- You'd rather be in your own part of the country.
- [Man] You're telling us.!</i>

794
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:14,549
- [Laughing]
- That's why none of you like being here very much.

795
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:17,354
- But suppose there was peace again.
- [All Groan]

796
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,360
- And holidays again.
- [Chuckling]

797
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:23,660
Well, you'd like to spend your holidays
in a beautiful and interesting part of the country.

798
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:27,464
And if you were to ask any man
who knew England well, "Where shall I go to?"

799
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:29,471
10-to-one he'd say, "Go to Kent."

800
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:32,406
<i>- Well, you're in Kent.
- [Man] And how.!
- [Man #2] Don't rub it in.</i>

801
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,739
<i>- Where's the wife and kid?
- Only passing through. I know.</i>

802
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:37,210
<i>- [Man #3] Who named Old Kent Road?
- [All] Watch yourself.</i>

803
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:40,841
<i>[Colpeper] I don't know what you are
in civil life. You might be cook, clerk...</i>

804
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,283
<i>a doctor, a lawyer, a merchant.</i>

805
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,378
Let me remind you
that as much as 600 years ago...

806
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:49,458
doctors and lawyers
and clerks and merchants...

807
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:53,222
were passing through here on the old road
which we call the Pilgrims' Way.

808
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,821
- And cooks.
- Yes. And cooks too.

809
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:59,197
<i>- [Man] Blimey. Cook's tour.!
- [All Laughing]</i>

810
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:03,864
These ancient pilgrims came to Canterbury
to ask for a blessing or to do penance.

811
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,139
You, I hope, are on your way
to secure blessings for the future.

812
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:13,107
- Any questions?
- Uh, I was thinking, sir.

813
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:16,617
- Yes?
- What have we got to do with this old road...

814
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,120
and the people who traveled along it
600 years ago?

815
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:23,852
- Hear! Hear!
- Isn't the house you were born in the most
interesting house in the world for you?

816
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,622
Don't you want to know
how your father lived? And his father?

817
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,198
That's all right,
but how do we know it really happened?

818
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:32,268
Well, there are more ways than one
of getting close to your ancestors.

819
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,394
Follow the old road,
and as you walk...

820
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:36,438
think of them
and of the old England.

821
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:40,200
They climbed Chillingbourne Hill,
just as you did.

822
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:43,040
They sweated and paused for breath,
just as you did today.

823
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,045
<i>When you see the bluebells
in the spring and the wild thyme...</i>

824
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,118
<i>and the broom and the heather...</i>

825
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,620
<i>you're only seeing
what their eyes saw.</i>

826
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:56,681
<i>You ford the same rivers.
The same birds are singing.</i>

827
00:54:56,793 --> 00:55:00,194
<i>When you lie flat
on your back and rest...</i>

828
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,527
<i>and watch the clouds sailing,
as I often do...</i>

829
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:07,069
you're so close
to those other people...

830
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:11,533
that you can hear the thrumming
of the hoofs of their horses...

831
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,701
and the sound
of the wheels on the road...

832
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,405
and their laughter and talk...

833
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,847
and the music
of the instruments they carried.

834
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,749
<i>And when I turn the bend of the road...</i>

835
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:28,381
<i>where they too
saw the towers of Canterbury...</i>

836
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,755
I feel I've only to turn my head...

837
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,851
to see them on the road behind me.

838
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:38,828
[Murmuring]

839
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:41,460
Like it?

840
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,539
Mmm.

841
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,608
How about you?

842
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,010
Makes a nice change.

843
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:51,603
Now I'd like to show you
some drawings and photographs...

844
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,706
of things we found
in recent excavations.

845
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:56,377
Hey, Bob. Movies.

846
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:59,649
I don't like free shows.
Something always goes wrong.

847
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,384
First I'll show you the bend
on the Pilgrims' Road.

848
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:04,926
- See?
- [All Whistling]

849
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:08,020
[Colpeper] Sorry. I always do that.
Somebody mind undoing the blackout?

850
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:10,099
[Murmuring]

851
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,910
Oh, thanks.

852
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:25,276
Perhaps our friend will be able to fix it.

853
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,646
He only looks after three Bren carriers.

854
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:32,083
Pity. I shall only be able to show
half the slides.

855
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:36,454
By the way, if any of you are really interested,
drop in at my house at any time and have a chat.

856
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,756
- Thank you.
- Are you interested, Miss Smith?

857
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:43,230
Why shouldn't she be?
I'm interested too.

858
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,359
- Otherwise we wouldn't be here. Right?
- Right.

859
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:48,562
What interests you especially?

860
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:51,105
Well, what you were saying.

861
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:54,973
- Of course, we know we don't know anything
about that sort of thing.
- Oh, yes, we do.

862
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,205
- Do we?
- We know all about the old road.

863
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,747
We know that the pilgrims
weren't the first to use it.

864
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:03,307
Quite right.
In Surrey it was used by the Romans.

865
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,254
- Here in Kent it certainly goes back to the Iron Age.
- I thought this was the Iron Age.

866
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:10,292
- [Men Laughing]
- Pipe down. It's very interesting.

867
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:15,391
A geologist found some Belgian coins
not far from here some time ago.

868
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:18,626
Last time I was in London I inquired
at the British Museum about them, but...

869
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:20,669
<i>I'm afraid they have no record.</i>

870
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,398
- I have them.
- You have them?

871
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:27,237
Yes. They were left to me
by the man who found them.

872
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:29,937
I'd be very grateful
if one day you let me see the coins.

873
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:32,844
Anytime.
After my luggage gets here.

874
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:36,112
- I wouldn't keep them very long.
- I'm going to give them to this museum.

875
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:41,587
Not for you.

876
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:43,352
Thank you.

877
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,494
Very much obliged.

878
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:50,122
May I ask for

01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:49,990
<i>- Yes?
- Have you got a minute?</i>

1030
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:52,219
<i>- Five, if you want them.
- Can I come up?</i>

1031
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:54,626
No, stay where you are.
I'll come down.

1032
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:58,690
You can't come in the box, you know.
It's against regulations.

1033
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,702
- Well, what is it?
- I only want to ask you one or two questions.

1034
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,772
Oh, well, fire away.

1035
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:16,183
- Morning.
- Morning.

1036
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:18,276
- Are you Dorothy Bird?
- That's me.

1037
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:22,289
I got your name from Fee Baker.
I'm the new land girl working at Foster's.

1038
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:24,359
Blimey.

1039
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:33,668
August 27.

1040
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:35,669
There.

1041
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:41,607
Fee Baker, Susan Cummings, Dorothy Bird,
Polly Finn, Gwladys Swinton and me.

1042
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:45,612
Each time the thing happened after
half past 11:00, but never later than midnight.

1043
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:49,081
Did it ever happen
after midnight to anybody?

1044
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:52,086
- As far as I can check, no.
- I've checked that my end.

1045
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:55,555
- They all say it never happened after midnight.
- That's important.

1046
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:58,183
- Why?
- Facts are always important.

1047
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:00,194
What about dates?

1048
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:04,357
Fee Baker, June 8.
Susan Cummings, June 24.

1049
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:07,196
Gwladys Swinton -
Oh, not sure.

1050
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:09,828
And me, August 27.

1051
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:13,067
Of course.
Bertha Rogers on the 11 th of August.

1052
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:15,143
Well, wait a minute.

1053
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:18,943
No. False alarm.

1054
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,948
Well, I can fill in some dates.

1055
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,177
Now, Gwladys Swinton was July 10.

1056
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:27,813
Two other girls, anonymous,
July 2 and August 3.

1057
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,026
Well, let's see.

1058
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:41,234
That gives us two on Tuesday,
one on Wednesday...

1059
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:44,602
one on Thursday,
two on Friday...

1060
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:47,608
one on Saturday,
blank on Sunday and Monday.

1061
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,610
Well, what do you make of that?

1062
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:51,680
I don't know.

1063
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,583
<i>[Alison] Well, anyway, our dates are still
incomplete. There were 11 cases in all.</i>

1064
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,658
So what?

1065
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:08,255
You know, I'm beginning to think
the whole village is cracked.

1066
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,730
<i>Just look at that boy.</i>

1067
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:14,667
<i>Ninety degrees in the shade,
and he's wearing a winter overcoat.</i>

1068
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,261
<i>[Bob]
Hello, Leslie, Terry.</i>

1069
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:20,900
<i>Come on up.
Ask for me.</i>

1070
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,137
They'll never get past old Albert.

1071
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,213
I'll fix that.

1072
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:35,622
Kids and almanacs.
This won't get us anywhere.

1073
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:37,624
Have you got a better idea?

1074
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:42,720
Yes. I'm gonna call on Mr. Colpeper this afternoon,
and I want you to come with me.

1075
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:45,061
You can't crash in
without being asked.

1076
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:48,967
He has asked me. Last night.
Anyone really interested, he said.

1077
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:51,335
- Well, I'm interested.
- Yes, that's clever.

1078
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,340
Well, will you come?

1079
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:56,741
- I'm not very keen. Take Bob.
- No, he's got a date.

1080
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:58,813
Meet General Terry...

1081
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:02,149
General Leslie.

1082
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:05,448
<i>Also Commander Todd-
he's the delicate one.</i>

1083
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:07,784
<i>- Do you all like lemonade?
- [Boys] Yes.</i>

1084
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,324
- You too, Commander?
- Yes.

1085
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:13,395
You can take this coat off now,
Commander.

1086
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,463
You're through the enemy's lines.

1087
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:20,265
Meet the account book
of Mr. Holmes...

1088
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:23,270
the general's father
and Chillingbourne drugstore keeper.

1089
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:26,432
- You mean the grocer.
- Beg pardon.

1090
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:32,074
"'A,' 'B,' 'C.' Thomas.

1091
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:36,850
Flower, soap, sugar, bacon."

1092
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:38,852
A week's rations.

1093
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:41,923
Here, you look at it.
You know the names.

1094
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:49,429
- Any sticky stuff?
- [Todd Muttering]

1095
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:52,432
Do some of the richer people here,
like the rector, Mr. Colpeper...

1096
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,434
buy everything in Chillingbourne?

1097
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,936
No, they get lots of things
from outside.

1098
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,008
- How do you know?
- We collect salvage from the houses.

1099
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:02,043
Salvage!

1100
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:04,244
Good afternoon.
You want my son.

1101
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:06,746
Yes, as a matter of fact.
I was at his lecture last night.

1102
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:10,148
And you want to talk to him about it.
Of course. Come in.

1103
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:12,220
Thanks.

1104
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:25,489
[Bell Clangs]

1105
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:28,263
- He'll be here in a moment.
- Thanks.

1106
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,591
Good afternoon, Sergeant.

1107
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:27,423
Oh, how do you do, sir?
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday.

1108
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:30,089
Oh, don't mention it. I expect
your weekdays are pretty fully occupied.

1109
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:32,099
- Yes, they are.
- Do sit down.

1110
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:34,761
- What do you drink? Beer, whiskey or cider?
- Nothing for me.

1111
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,839
- Oh, do have something.
- Oh, cider, please.

1112
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,405
Emma? Cider.

1113
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:46,908
Well, how's the army going?
You seem to be busy from morning till night.

1114
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:50,348
- It's a bit like your job.
- Mine?

1115
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:54,354
You put a great deal in
to get very little out.

1116
01:14:54,456 --> 01:14:56,356
Are you a farmer in civil life?

1117
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:58,358
Me? No.

1118
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,860
May I ask what part
of the country you come from?

1119
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:02,863
London.

1120
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:06,298
- Not much material there for your lectures.
- More there than anywhere.

1121
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:08,369
What about the British Museum?

1122
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:12,205
Yeah, I suppose it is pretty good.

1123
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:16,141
Yes, very good.
Nearly a day's walk from Chillingbourne.

1124
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:18,645
What, 50 miles?
Some walk.

1125
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:21,147
Not if you like walking.
Do you like walking?

1126
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,980
Not if I can help it.
Why walk if there's a train?

1127
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:27,055
- Oh, Mother.
- Go on with your talking. I can manage.

1128
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:31,886
I see, sir,
you're interested in mountaineering.

1129
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:34,394
Yes, I do a bit of it.

1130
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:38,523
I suppose you'd recommend me to wait at
the bottom till somebody builds a funicular railway.

1131
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:42,536
I'd say, why climb to the top at all?
What's wrong with the valley?

1132
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:46,039
- The answer's in yourself.
- You're dead right.

1133
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:49,838
And the trouble with this country is that every
second man thinks he's born to be a missionary...

1134
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:52,470
and every third man
has a bee in his bonnet.

1135
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:55,345
Thank you. Look at you.
You don't mind?

1136
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,350
No, of course not.

1137
01:15:57,452 --> 01:16:00,080
You're a gentleman farmer
with a fine house.

1138
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:03,123
I'm sure you've got a first-class farm
and run it well.

1139
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:07,423
Yet the first chance you get, you're off
climbing mountains or digging up stuff...

1140
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:11,090
which 600 years ago
was thrown out as junk.

1141
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,224
No bee in your bonnet.

1142
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:17,704
No. I've got my job -
30 a week.

1143
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:20,707
I've got my flat. I meet my friends
when I want to meet them.

1144
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:22,709
That's good enough for me.

1145
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:25,712
Don't you want a bigger flat,
better job - 40 a week?

1146
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:28,715
I've got the best job
a man in my business can have.

1147
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:31,479
May I ask, what is your job?

1148
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,487
I'm an organist.

1149
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,614
In St. Paul's Cathedral?

1150
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:38,852
No, in a cinema. West End.

1151
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:42,226
I'm a cinema organist.
A good one.

1152
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:44,231
I'm sure you are.

1153
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:47,734
Have you always wanted
to be a cinema organist?

1154
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:49,804
Not when I was a kid.

1155
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:58,245
I wanted to be a church organist.

1156
01:16:58,347 --> 01:17:00,679
I studied for nine years.

1157
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:05,685
Then, luckily for me, I met
a chap who told me about a job -

1158
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:09,223
a new theater,
brand-new organ.

1159
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:13,658
You see, I never really had the chance
to play on any big organ...

1160
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:15,662
except the one at the academy.

1161
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:19,291
- You never played a church organ?
- Not a big one.

1162
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:23,929
It seems to me, Sergeant,
there are two kinds of men -

1163
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:26,735
<i>one who learns to play
Bach and Handel...</i>

1164
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:29,834
only to play
"I Kiss Your Little Hand, Madame"...

1165
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:32,846
and the man who learns
to walk step by step...

1166
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:35,644
so that one day
he might climb Mount Everest.

1167
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,810
<i>[Knocking]</i>

1168
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,979
Perhaps another convert
to the study of ancient Kent.

1169
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:45,389
- I'm afraid I have gone rather off the rails.
- Never mind. There's plenty of time.

1170
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,724
Not much to do in Chillingbourne.
How do you find it?

1171
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:49,729
<i>- I haven't seen much of it.
- Oh, how's that?</i>

1172
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:52,459
- I only arrived on Friday night.
- Oh, yes.

1173
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:55,730
I remember seeing you at my lecture with
Miss Smith and our American ally, Sgt. Johnson.

1174
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:58,863
- Did you walk in together from the station?
- Yes.

1175
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:02,603
I was with them
when the attack took place.

1176
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:06,772
This fellow must be a tough sort of customer.
About your height.

1177
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:09,316
As a matter of fact,
I had some excitement myself that night.

1178
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:12,819
- They searched the town hall. I was on fire guard.
- Do you have to do fire-watching?

1179
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:14,946
<i>- Oh, yes.
- As well as Home Guard?</i>

1180
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:18,458
Twice a week Home Guard,
and fire-watching every eighth day.

1181
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:23,324
<i>- Tom?
- Yes, Mother?</i>

1182
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:25,332
The salvage boys are here again.

1183
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:28,597
<i>- Why, they were here last week.
- Well, they say it's a paper drive.</i>

1184
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,604
But maybe it's my homemade toffee.

1185
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,266
There are six boys
and Ovendon's donkey.

1186
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,843
I'll go and talk to them.
Excuse me.

1187
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:46,778
<i>- Hello. Salvage again?
- [Terry] Yes, sir. Wastepaper.</i>

1188
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,788
<i>[Leslie]
We've got a lot of sacks, sir.</i>

1189
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,552
<i>- [Colpeper] Did you go round
to the old scullery last time?
- No, sir.</i>

1190
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,561
You'd better go round by the back way.
Emma will show you.

1191
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,563
Round the back way.

1192
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:59,327
- How's your father's lumbago, Terry?
- Awful, sir.

1193
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:01,402
Oh, too bad.

1194
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:09,542
- Well, I'm afraid I must be going now, sir.
- Nonsense.

1195
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:12,613
I'm enjoying our talk.
Let's have another mug.

1196
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:23,056
<i>[Knocking]</i>

1197
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:25,058
Hello?
Coming, ma'am.

1198
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:29,324
Four and five and six and seven.

1199
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:33,197
Two shillings and seven pence.
That okay, ma'am?

1200
01:19:33,301 --> 01:19:36,168
Now what?
Press button "A." Okay.

1201
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:38,171
[Coins Jangling]

1202
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:40,173
Looks like I hit the jackpot.

1203
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,175
- Pressed the wrong button.
- What's that, ma'am?

1204
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:45,337
I pressed button "B"?
Check.

1205
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:50,082
Reinsert coins and press button "A."

1206
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:52,153
Check again.

1207
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:55,422
[Sighs]

1208
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:57,924
"A" buttons, "B" buttons...

1209
01:19:58,026 --> 01:20:00,620
mirrors, tea drinking...

1210
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:03,254
left-hand driving...

1211
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,265
stripes upside down.

1212
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:08,302
Yes, ma'am. It sure is difficult.
And hot.

1213
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:11,270
Here I come, button "A."

1214
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:13,307
[Coins Fall]

1215
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:16,002
[Sighs]
Made it.

1216
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:20,572
Hello?
Sergeant Michael Roczinsky, please.

1217
01:20:20,682 --> 01:20:24,209
<i>R- O-C-Z-l-
That's correct.</i>

1218
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,219
U.S. Army.

1219
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:28,755
He said what?
Now see here, ma'am.

1220
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:31,758
I don't care what Mickey Roczinsky told you.
He's a buddy of mine.

1221
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,760
We come from the same company.

1222
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:35,762
Wake him up. It's 4:00.

1223
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:38,765
He can't sleep out
his whole leave in London.

1224
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:41,597
<i>You can't? You won't?</i>

1225
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:45,799
Say, you give good service
in your hotel.

1226
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:49,968
Well, tell him BobJohnson rang.

1227
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:54,606
Bob. B-O-B. Bob.

1228
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:56,775
Call it what you like.

1229
01:20:56,885 --> 01:21:01,254
Tell him I can't get to London.
He's to meet me in Canterbury.

1230
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:05,520
I'm not in Canterbury now,
but I'll be in Canterbury tomorrow.

1231
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:08,895
Where will he meet me?

1232
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:13,331
Holy cats! I don't know where.
I've never even seen the place.

1233
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:15,369
Where can he meet me
in Canterbury?

1234
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:17,301
<i>- Cathedral.
- That's right.</i>

1235
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:23,139
Tell him to meet me
in Canterbury Cathedral at 11:00.

1236
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:25,145
Thanks.

1237
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:27,215
Whew!

1238
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:30,716
These London dames
have plenty on the ball.

1239
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:33,219
Now, look, forget sex
for a little while, will you?

1240
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:36,222
I've either solved the whole thing
or wasted a perfectly good Sunday.

1241
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:38,224
What about me
and my whole furlough?

1242
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:40,726
- See that?
- Without difficulty.

1243
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:43,423
Now where's that list you made today
of the dates of the crimes?

1244
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:46,432
- Right here, but -
- Now I'll tell you when the crimes were committed.

1245
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:49,901
- Why tell me? I have them here.
- Yes, but I haven't.

1246
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:54,169
Now check.
The last one was Friday, August 27.

1247
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:56,403
Considering we were both there -

1248
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:58,411
Before that,
Thursday the 19th.

1249
01:21:58,513 --> 01:22:00,413
- Unproven.
- Well, take it from me, it's right.

1250
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:02,415
- Shandy?
- No, thanks.

1251
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:05,748
Before that, Wednesday the 11 th.
Tuesday, 3rd of August.

1252
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:07,754
Say, that's right.

1253
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:11,189
July 26, a Monday.
July 18, a Sunday.

1254
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:14,626
Tenth ofJuly, a Saturday.
Second ofJuly, a Friday.

1255
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:16,890
- All correct.
- Twenty-fourth ofJune, a Thursday.

1256
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:20,092
Then one on Wednesday, the 16th ofJune
and Tuesday, the eighth ofJune.

1257
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:22,101
Altogether, 11.

1258
01:22:22,203 --> 01:22:24,262
Say, what have you got there?

1259
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:28,274
This, my fine feathered friend, is the
fire guard rota from Mr. Colpeper's house...

1260
01:22:28,376 --> 01:22:31,504
and the dates that I've quoted to you
are the nights that he was on duty.

1261
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,581
<i>- Every eighth day.
- Gee!</i>

1262
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:36,883
Then Ernie Brooks clinches it.

1263
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:38,714
<i>- What does he say?
- Same as me.</i>

1264
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:44,019
He saw the light in Mr. Colpeper's office
around midnight, but not before.

1265
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:47,094
<i>[Bell Dinging]</i>

1266
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:50,323
Halt! Who goes there?
Friend or foe?

1267
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:52,332
<i>[Bob]
Friend.</i>

1268
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:54,402
Sentry, let him come up!

1269
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,942
- Hello.
- Hello.

1270
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:06,445
- How are you doing, General?
- Okay. Four up to now.

1271
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,120
Well, here is something.

1272
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:18,056
The name of a firm - Rymans Limited.
Who are they?

1273
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,060
They're a London firm. Lot of branches.
They sell office accessories.

1274
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:23,062
Paper, ink...

1275
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,132
and gum.

1276
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:28,768
Well, that's that.

1277
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:30,770
The rest is just routine.

1278
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:32,840
Yes, we've got him cold.

1279
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:38,174
<i>[Bob] Let's see now.
It was a new football we agreed on, wasn't it?</i>

1280
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:43,778
You sure that's enough?
You've earned it.

1281
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:46,482
Thank you very much.

1282
01:23:46,588 --> 01:23:49,887
The pleasure, General,
is entirely mine.

1283
01:23:54,095 --> 01:23:56,825
Hey! Catch!

1284
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:11,761
<i>- [Jingling]
- [Hoofbeats]</i>

1285
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:22,550
<i>[People Laughing]</i>

1286
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:35,529
<i>[Colpeper]
Glorious, isn't it?</i>

1287
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:41,836
Is anybody there?

1288
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:46,872
It's a real voice you heard.
You're not dreaming.

1289
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:51,639
You know, just now I -

1290
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:53,714
I heard sounds.

1291
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:56,306
What sounds did you hear?

1292
01:25:56,417 --> 01:25:58,977
Horses' hooves, voices...

1293
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:03,155
and a lute.

1294
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:06,887
Or an instrument like a lute.
Did you hear anything?

1295
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:09,896
Those sounds come from inside,
not outside.

1296
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,967
Then only when you're concentrating,
when you believe strongly in something.

1297
01:26:13,067 --> 01:26:15,968
Just now I was concentrating on
who was coming up the hill to disturb me.

1298
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:17,731
Disturb you? At what?

1299
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:22,742
<i>Breathing the air, smelling the earth,
watching the clouds.</i>

1300
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:25,005
Why don't you sit down?

1301
01:26:34,088 --> 01:26:36,488
You know,
I was very mistaken about you.

1302
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:39,492
I'm sorry.

1303
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:41,562
I was mistaken about you too.

1304
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:47,257
You have to dig to find out
about people, as well as roads.

1305
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:53,005
Do you know
why I wanted to stay so much?

1306
01:26:53,107 --> 01:26:56,235
- I wanted to be here again.
- You've been here before?

1307
01:26:57,645 --> 01:27:00,546
Do you see that clump of trees?

1308
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:03,549
I spent 13 perfect days there
in a caravan.

1309
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:05,619
Your caravan?

1310
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:10,219
- It belongs to me now.
- And the owner?

1311
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:17,954
If there's such a thing as a soul,
he must be here somewhere.

1312
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:21,367
He loved this hill so much.

1313
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:23,494
I love it too.

1314
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:26,506
May I ask, were you engaged?

1315
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:29,509
- Three years.
- A long time.

1316
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:31,772
His father was the trouble.

1317
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:34,746
- Did you ever meet each other?
- Oh, yes.

1318
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:37,181
We didn't dislike each other.

1319
01:27:37,285 --> 01:27:39,185
They were a very good family...

1320
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:42,188
and he thought his son should marry
someone better than a shopgirl.

1321
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:47,318
"Good family." "Shopgirl."

1322
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:50,761
Rather dilapidated phrases
for wartime.

1323
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:55,768
Not for Geoffrey's father.
It would have taken an earthquake.

1324
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:58,338
We're having one.

1325
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:03,009
Too late for me.

1326
01:28:06,547 --> 01:28:10,779
- There are a lot of funny things in the world.
- What, for instance?

1327
01:28:10,885 --> 01:28:16,221
For instance, why should people
who love the country have to live in big cities?

1328
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,224
Something's wrong.

1329
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:20,726
Miracles still happen, you know.

1330
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:23,319
Do you believe in miracles?

1331
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:27,834
When I was your age, I didn't believe
in anything. Now I believe in miracles.

1332
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:30,836
- For shopgirls?
- For everybody.

1333
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:34,806
You know, I think a shopgirl has
a bigger chance of a miracle than a millionaire.

1334
01:28:34,909 --> 01:28:38,868
- I can see you've never been a shopgirl.
- Nor a millionaire.

1335
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:44,574
<i>See those clouds forming?
It'll be a warm day tomorrow.</i>

1336
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:51,317
Tomorrow I've got to go into Canterbury,
to the Agricultural Committee.

1337
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:54,987
- I shall visit my property.
- You've property in Canterbury?

1338
01:28:55,096 --> 01:29:00,625
My caravan. It's jacked up there in a garage.
I pay half a crown a week for it.

1339
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:03,169
Quite a lot
for a jacked-up caravan.

1340
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:06,507
Not for my caravan.

1341
01:29:08,476 --> 01:29:10,944
Shall you bring it here?

1342
01:29:11,045 --> 01:29:13,138
I hope so.

1343
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:16,944
Pilgrims to Canterbury
often receive blessings.

1344
01:29:17,051 --> 01:29:19,986
Do you think even a visit
to the Agricultural Committee...

1345
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:22,454
could be
the instrument of a blessing?

1346
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:25,526
Who knows? If not,
I might have a word with them.

1347
01:29:29,797 --> 01:29:33,062
[Bob] Yes, sir,
I was born with an open mind.

1348
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:36,136
<i>- [Gibbs] And mouth.
- And mouth, as you remark.</i>

1349
01:29:36,237 --> 01:29:40,936
<i>But it sure is a surprise to me to find
how much I like everything over here.</i>

1350
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:43,840
<i>- Must they see us?
- Everything, I may add, but one thing.</i>

1351
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:45,845
<i>- [Gibbs] What's that?
- Not if you keep low.</i>

1352
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:50,281
<i>Why do you, from sunrise to sunset,
and at odd hours throughout the night...</i>

1353
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:52,285
have to drink tea?

1354
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:55,288
- I shouldn't be too noisy about it if I were you.
- But I hate the stuff.

1355
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:59,588
Well, after Pearl Harbor you Americans
joined the honorable company of tea drinkers.

1356
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:04,324
Don't forget that the Nazis and Japs have
knocked down every country they've tried to,
except the tea drinkers -

1357
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:06,832
China, Russia and England.

1358
01:30:06,934 --> 01:30:08,834
So, long live drinking tea.

1359
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:12,030
Drinking tea doesn't appear
to be much good for the wind.

1360
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:15,906
If anybody'd made me walk three miles
before the war and then climb a hill...

1361
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:18,410
I'd say he could bury me at the top.

1362
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:21,414
<i>- I thought organists, as a race, were climbers.
- Of what?</i>

1363
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:24,747
<i>- [Bob] Church towers.
- [Gibbs] I use a lift.</i>

1364
01:30:26,954 --> 01:30:30,913
Boy! Cast your eye
around that noble prospect!

1365
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:32,925
Wasn't it worth the climb?

1366
01:30:33,027 --> 01:30:34,927
Nearly.

1367
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:36,929
Of course, I freely admit...

1368
01:30:37,031 --> 01:30:39,397
it's nothing to compare with the view
from Three Sisters Mountains.

1369
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,936
Now, don't start to tell me that
you've got higher hills and broader rivers.

1370
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:46,165
<i>- I don't see any river.
- There.</i>

1371
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:48,936
<i>- That's the River Stour.
- [Bob] That?</i>

1372
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:53,343
<i>- [Gibbs] It goes to Canterbury.
- Going to Canterbury is no proof it's a river.</i>

1373
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:56,611
I'm going to Canterbury,
and I ain't no river.

1374
01:30:56,717 --> 01:30:59,413
Well, I'll admit it's no Mississippi.

1375
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,681
And I'll admit
I've never seen the Mississippi.

1376
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:04,451
Then be happy to tell your folks
you've seen the River Stour...

1377
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:06,459
and English blackberries.

1378
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:10,327
I am happy.
Ours are bigger than these.

1379
01:31:10,431 --> 01:31:12,797
I feel fine.

1380
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:17,132
The whole time, ever since we sailed,
something's been wrong with me.

1381
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:21,265
Maybe it was my girl.
Maybe I was homesick.

1382
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:26,369
Now, for the first time,
I feel swell.

1383
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:29,678
Maybe it was because my mind
was preoccupied.

1384
01:31:29,784 --> 01:31:33,686
In the army, they think mostly
about keeping your body occupied.

1385
01:31:33,788 --> 01:31:36,348
They've not much time
to worry about your mind.

1386
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:38,357
No.

1387
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:40,620
The air here
is as good as Hyde Park.

1388
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:42,628
Hyde Park?
That's in London?

1389
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:44,630
Very much in London.

1390
01:31:44,732 --> 01:31:49,101
What would you be doing this afternoon
in London, if there wasn't any war?

1391
01:31:49,203 --> 01:31:51,103
<i>[Gibbs]
Sunday afternoon?</i>

1392
01:31:51,205 --> 01:31:53,400
<i>Reading, playing cards with the boys,
waiting for the pubs to open...</i>

1393
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:56,671
<i>occupying the mind,
letting the body take care of itself.</i>

1394
01:31:56,777 --> 01:32:00,042
You don't fancy
the countryside much, do you?

1395
01:32:00,147 --> 01:32:03,514
Tell you the truth, I'd hardly realized
there was a countryside before the war.

1396
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:06,212
[Bob]
Funny that -

1397
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,448
how the war can open
your eyes to a lot of things.

1398
01:32:09,557 --> 01:32:11,821
<i>[Gibbs] That sounds like
the Glue Man's lecture.</i>

1399
01:32:11,926 --> 01:32:14,918
<i>[Bob] Take me, for instance.
I was no G-man before the war.</i>

1400
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:18,988
Imagine me, BobJohnson
ofJohnson County, Oregon...

1401
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:22,001
coming over here
and solving the Glue Man mystery.

1402
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:25,368
<i>[Gibbs] While you're throwing bouquets
at yourself, don't forget me and Alison.</i>

1403
01:32:25,473 --> 01:32:28,601
<i>[Bob] The nutty thing
about it is, I like him.</i>

1404
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:30,973
- [Gibbs] Who?
- [Bob] Old Gluepeper.

1405
01:32:31,078 --> 01:32:33,706
[Gibbs]
He's a bit cracked, but I like him too.

1406
01:32:33,814 --> 01:32:36,783
- [Bob] Come on, Pete. I'll race you down.
- [Gibbs] You're on.

1407
01:32:50,998 --> 01:32:55,196
<i>[Duckett]
Chillingbourne.! Chillingbourne.!</i>

1408
01:32:56,304 --> 01:33:00,570
<i>Canterbury, next stop.!
Next stop, Canterbury.!</i>

1409
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:03,235
Well, it's just as well he knows.
He didn't deny it, did he?

1410
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:06,245
- Didn't say a word.
- No, he wouldn't. Are you going to tell the police?

1411
01:33:06,347 --> 01:33:08,872
Certainly. He's called the tune.
Now he's got to pay the piper.

1412
01:33:13,321 --> 01:33:16,688
- Say, what's the holdup, George?
- Mr. Colpeper's a bit late.

1413
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:19,692
Did you get that? Well, how do you know
he's going to Canterbury?

1414
01:33:19,794 --> 01:33:21,694
<i>It's Monday.
His day on the bench.</i>

1415
01:33:21,796 --> 01:33:24,424
- On the bench? Hello, pop.
- Hello, sonny boy.

1416
01:33:24,532 --> 01:33:27,660
- Bench of magistrates.
- The district law court.

1417
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:29,668
<i>- Good morning, Mr. Duckett.
- Morning, miss.</i>

1418
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:33,831
I warned you to keep an eye on her Friday night.
Oh, here he comes.

1419
01:33:37,345 --> 01:33:40,542
<i>[Duckett]
Here you are, Mr. Colpeper.</i>

1420
01:33:40,648 --> 01:33:42,548
<i>[Colpeper]
Thanks, Duckett.</i>

1421
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:45,118
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

1422
01:33:49,757 --> 01:33:51,657
Thank goodness
he didn't come in here.

1423
01:33:51,759 --> 01:33:53,727
<i>[Train Whistle Toots]</i>

1424
01:34:04,338 --> 01:34:08,365
Good morning. You don't mind my sitting with you.
It's only 10 minutes to Canterbury.

1425
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:11,104
- There's plenty of room.
- You bet.

1426
01:34:13,247 --> 01:34:15,147
I'm glad to meet you all together.

1427
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:18,082
You, I suppose, are on your way
to rejoin your unit, SergeantJohnson.

1428
01:34:18,185 --> 01:34:20,085
Yes, sir.

1429
01:34:20,187 --> 01:34:22,519
<i>And you're off to
the Agricultural Committee.</i>

1430
01:34:22,623 --> 01:34:25,114
And you're going to sit on the bench.

1431
01:34:25,226 --> 01:34:28,627
<i>- And you, Sergeant Gibbs?
- I'm going to the police station.</i>

1432
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:31,095
I see.

1433
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:33,428
An excellent police force,
the Kent constabulary.

1434
01:34:33,534 --> 01:34:35,525
They solve every crime
sooner or later.

1435
01:34:35,636 --> 01:34:38,537
- Do you think the Glue Man knew that?
- He knew it all right.

1436
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:41,631
- But he didn't think what he did was a crime.
- What else can you call it?

1437
01:34:41,742 --> 01:34:44,108
Upsetting the whole village,
giving the soldiers a bad name with everyone.

1438
01:34:44,211 --> 01:34:47,908
Some children hate going to school.
Their parents have to force them to go.

1439
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:49,915
<i>Is that a crime?</i>

1440
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:53,475
- Pouring glue on girls' hair is.
- It's awful to get out.

1441
01:34:53,587 --> 01:34:56,249
You're not going to defend
pouring glue on people?

1442
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:58,257
Certainly not.

1443
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:01,351
But I'm going to defend pouring knowledge
into people's heads, by force if necessary.

1444
01:35:01,462 --> 01:35:04,920
- What knowledge?
- Knowledge of our country and love of its beauty.

1445
01:35:05,032 --> 01:35:07,830
Beauty of the countryside!
Who cares about these things in wartime?

1446
01:35:07,935 --> 01:35:10,199
Who cares about them in peacetime?

1447
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:14,206
I've tried it before this war.
Why should it be any better after it?

1448
01:35:14,308 --> 01:35:17,539
I've written articles that didn't
get further than the county papers.

1449
01:35:17,645 --> 01:35:21,012
I rented a hall in London to speak from,
but nobody came to listen.

1450
01:35:21,115 --> 01:35:23,015
<i>I even held a meeting in Hyde Park.</i>

1451
01:35:23,117 --> 01:35:26,086
- That's no subject for Hyde Park.
- I found that out.

1452
01:35:27,321 --> 01:35:31,087
Then the war came,
and just as I was thinking, like you...

1453
01:35:31,192 --> 01:35:34,127
that all the things I'd been preaching about
would have to wait until peacetime...

1454
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:36,526
<i>a miracle happened.</i>

1455
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:39,360
That's the trouble.
You believe in miracles.

1456
01:35:39,467 --> 01:35:41,867
Yes, I do.

1457
01:35:41,969 --> 01:35:46,099
The miracle was that the army decided
to build a camp just outside our village.

1458
01:35:46,207 --> 01:35:49,608
Young men flowed in
from every part of the country.

1459
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:51,610
I felt as a missionary must feel...

1460
01:35:51,712 --> 01:35:54,772
when one day he finds
there's no need to travel into the jungle...

1461
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:57,248
to find converts...

1462
01:35:57,351 --> 01:35:59,251
<i>because the savages are coming to him.</i>

1463
01:35:59,353 --> 01:36:02,186
<i>- Thanks for the compliment.
- There's no sin in being a savage.</i>

1464
01:36:02,289 --> 01:36:06,282
But a missionary who doesn't try
to do his duty is a bad missionary.

1465
01:36:06,393 --> 01:36:09,089
- Well?
- Well, here was a chance for them and for me.

1466
01:36:09,196 --> 01:36:13,929
I planned a series of lectures - no one came.
I tried again and again - nobody turned up.

1467
01:36:14,034 --> 01:36:15,934
I went to see their C.O.
He sympathized.

1468
01:36:16,036 --> 01:36:18,937
Said when the men had finished their work,
they had dates with the girls in the village...

1469
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:22,406
or they went to the movies to see glamour girls
on the screen, or they got up dances.

1470
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:25,411
- They were always with girls or after girls.
- Well, what's wrong with that?

1471
01:36:25,513 --> 01:36:29,244
Yeah. It's natural to feel lonesome
in a strange place.

1472
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:32,251
You have a girl at home,
haven't you?

Yes, I have.

1474

5,000 miles.

1476

Most of our girls
have their men in the services.

1477
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:44,994
The older people didn't like the idea of them
going out with every soldier that came along.

1478
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:47,863
- I suppose they couldn't do anything about it.
- It was difficult.

1479
01:36:47,968 --> 01:36:50,528
Nobody wanted to stop the soldiers
having a good time.

- No.
- Pity.

a man in your position, a magistrate...

and your friends on the bench?

1493

It would depend upon
the findings of the court.

1494

I never pass sentence
without doing that.

1496
