00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:28,651
"The first impression one gets
of a new ruler and his brains

334

"is from seeing the men he has chosen
to have around him. "

but he acts like a real leader of men.

Inside that bastard a clown lives,
and sooner or later,

343

the clown will come out,

344
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,910
because a clown is a clown
and will always be a clown!

- The snotty one.

Things must be pretty bad in Rome
for the Fascists.

348

- She'd cut the eggs off a man.
- It would almost be worth it.

I'm sorry you're going,
but of course I understand you have to go.

- If I didn't, I could lose my place.
- No, we mustn't have that.

to have one young man at the university.

- I know.

- I've done your other shirt.
- Thank you.

You know what Pulci said
to me last night?

356
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,223
He said Fabio must keep his seat
on the council

357
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,268
even when he's away at school.

358
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:29,830
After all, you're the only minister we have
who's gone past the fourth grade.

- I always cry when Fabio goes.

00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:57,799
Of course, he's like a brother to you.

364

I don't love him like a brother.
I love him like a woman.

00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,769
Angela, my child,
you're too young to think such things.

366
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,243
That's what Fabio thinks, that I am a child.

367
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,075
- He's right.
- But I am 16 years old!

368
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,207
- You're only 16...
- And I have the breasts of a woman.

369
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,547
- Angela, please.
- And at night, when I'm in my bed,

370
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,314
- my breasts ache for Fabio!
- Don't do that!

371
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,615
And I only want to be with him!

372

You mustn't say such things!

I can't help it, Papa!

your daughter in the ways of the world!

Angela, please ask your father
what the hell he's talking about.

376
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:56,354
Angela, I want your mother
to teach you two things,

377
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,929
the beauty of women,
and the danger of men.

378

Are you sick?

381
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,681
You look sick.

382
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,719
Hey, why are you sweating all over?

383
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:31,452
What's wrong? Talk to your mother.

384
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:35,093
- It's Fabio, Mama.
- Fabio.

385
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:39,159
When I see Fabio, I love him so much,
I can't help sweating.

386
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,263
Well, I understand, believe me,
my little girl.

387
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,434
I understand you.
You see Fabio even in your soup.

388
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,102
Yes, Mama, yes.

389
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:51,205
And when I talk to him, I can't help it,
the juices flow inside...

390
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,807
- What?
- The juices, Mama.

391
00:35:57,288 --> 00:36:01,486
You can hit me all you like,
but that doesn't change anything.

392

You are a woman, Mama, and so am I.

393
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,793
It's time you taught me
everything you know.

394
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:07,888
Know?

395
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,934
What do I know
after a life with your father?

396
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,130
I fell in love with him at once
without even thinking.

397
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:19,233
Only because he was handsome, strong,
happy, with his big, beautiful hands.

398
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,575
And he smiled.
He smiled like a row of angels!

399
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:27,481
I told my parents
I want that man in my bed, only him.

400
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,350
My father should have hit me
over the head with a bottle.

401
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:33,618
But I don't want to marry Papa.
I want to marry Fabio.

402
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:39,630
I had him in bed.
I had him and that was all. Drunk.

You worked on the vines

Maybe you might have an idea.

There's only one place
in Santa Vittoria where it's

504

mathematically possible
to hide one million bottles.

Take the wine out of the cooperative

and put it down in the old Roman cave.

509
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:22,976
That's a wonderful idea,
except we already thought of it,

510
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,879
so maybe it's not such a wonderful idea,

511
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,246
because if we thought of the Roman cave,

512
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:28,784
and you thought of the Roman cave,

513
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:33,380
so will the Germans
think of the Roman cave.

514
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,254
You can hide the wine in the Roman cave
in such a way

515
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:39,386
that all the Germans will see
is an empty cave.

Prayers are never wasted.

519
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:04,485
Now, we all know the cave is useless,
so we won't use the cave.

520
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:05,579
The cave is useless.

521

Look at the room in there.

525
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:20,464
There's enough room for all the wine
in Italy. And there are four of them.

00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:21,765
Four of them!

527
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:28,244
So, my friends, I follow the advice
of my master, Niccolò Machiavelli.

"Things are never what they seem. "

529

We will brick up the tunnels
as if they never existed.

530
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:39,316

01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:48,212
total acreage,

793
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:49,846
uh,

794
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:53,188
- complete records of annual yield.
- Yield.

795
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:54,317
Mmm-hmm.

796
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:59,832
How many mules, oxen,
list of all machinery and tools,

797
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:06,735
and... Oh, yes, precisely how much
wine you have in store here.

798
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:14,575
- Have I said something to disturb you?
- Oh, no, no, no, sir.

799
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:19,143
It's just that it will take several weeks,
maybe months, to get all this information.

800
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:21,553
There are so many things
about you Italians

801
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:24,023
that, for me, are genuinely delightful.

802
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:26,424
And I'm sure you could be
months about this task,

803
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:31,899
but unfortunately I need
this information in 48 hours.

804
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:36,227
Will you do that for me?

805
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:43,437
(CLICKS TONGUE) Sir, you do something
for me, I will do something for you.

806
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:46,140
I mean, you scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours.

807
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:49,706
We have a saying. "You lend me
your mule, I will lend you my ox! "

808
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:50,945
Well,

809
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,547
I have no mule.

810
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,549
And as for scratching your back,
I'm not so sure.

811
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:59,785
However, Bombolini,
we'll talk from time to time.

812
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:02,830
Perhaps we can learn
from each other about things.

813
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:07,767
Yes, sir. Well, sir, it's...

814
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:11,328
I want to say it's... I mean...

815
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:13,235
It's...

816
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,875
It's been a great pleasure.

817
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:18,775
Excuse me, my hat.

818
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:24,376
Sir, the fact is
we don't see this war as our war.

819
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:29,321
All we want to do is act in a way that will
cause us the least harm in the end.

820
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:33,652
- I see.
- Excuse.

821
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:36,091
Well,

822
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:41,226
good day, sir. Good day.

823
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:47,164
So I said to Vingolini, "Look, Vingolini, I... "

824
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:51,912
Did you see what I saw?

825
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,414
If there are two people in the world
who should never meet,

826
01:20:54,482 --> 01:20:56,109
it's the German and your wife Rosa.

827
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:58,379
Babbaluche, do you think
she'll make trouble?

828
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:00,921
With Rosa, there's trouble.

829
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:18,398
Italo Bombolini is your husband?

830
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:20,907
- I can't deny it.
- How does it happen that

831
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:22,375
you are here, and he's there?

832
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,745
In Santa Vittoria, anything can happen.

833
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:28,908
If you have a pig with six ears
and two bottoms,

834
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:31,817
you say, "Santa Vittoria.
What do you expect?"

835
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,879
If Germans come here,
we say the same thing.

836
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:40,550
Your manners leave
something to be desired.

837
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,696
We didn't invite you here.

838
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:53,598
Sometimes, it would be a good idea
for you to keep your mouth shut.

839
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:55,139
(COIN RATTLING)

840
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,937
- Bombolini is well rid of you.
- Listen, German,

841
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:02,715
the whole town is one big Bombolini.

842
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:06,553
"Good evening, German Army.
How are you, German Army?"

843
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:09,590
The whole town, 1,200 people,

844
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:13,216
1,200 butter noses! But not me. Not me!

845
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:17,988
Signora, even for a woman
with your powerful face,

846
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:22,768
you're becoming a little too brave
for your own good.

847
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:30,268
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

848
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,540
How can you talk to the German like that?

849
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:34,206
It's not so hard.

850
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:39,811
Try to understand my position.
Rosa, Rosa, you could help me.

851
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:44,951
Rosa, I can't eat. I can't drink.
I have nightmares.

852
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:46,323
Just this afternoon, I fell asleep,

853
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:50,728
and I dreamt he asked me
how many bottles of wine we had.

854
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:52,733
- Tell him the truth.
- Yes.

855
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:56,302
And go back to sleep.
And don't try to cheat him.

856
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:58,100
You are not smart enough.

857
01:22:58,173 --> 01:22:59,572
I am not trying to cheat him.

858
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:01,666
I'm only trying to make him
think I'm cheating.

859
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:04,211
If he doesn't think I'm cheating,
he's going to start wondering

860
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:07,271
why I'm not cheating,
or even trying to cheat.

861
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:12,184
And, Rosa...
Rosa, then he's going to start thinking

862
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:15,745
maybe this isn't
all the wine we have, you see?

863
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,393
Bombolini,

864
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:23,761
why do you always have to go
all the way around the mountain

865
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,766
when you want to take a leak next door?

866
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:29,928
I don't know.

867
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,235
I guess cheating comes more natural.

868
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:36,734
Out. Out!

869
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:39,578
Look!

870
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:42,673
You be reasonable
and keep your fat mouth shut,

871
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:46,118
or I'm going to feed you my fist, I swear!

872
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:49,679
I'm frightened to death of you and the cat!

873
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:59,422
Oh, Captain, sir, I want to apologize.
I'm not responsible

874
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:03,335
- now for what my wife says.
- It's all right, Bombolini.

875
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:05,600
- I decided to forget it.
- Thank you.

876
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:07,664
But she certainly is a bitch.

877
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,638
Good afternoon.

878
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:17,914
- Bombolini.
- Yes, sir.

879
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:22,650
Tell me, what did you do before you
entered the field of civic administration?

880
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,658
I was a wine seller, sir.

881
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,489
- Were you?
- Yes.

882
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:27,960
And to whom did you sell your wine?

883
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:32,432
Well, to anybody who had money
to pay for it.

884
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,400
- You mean table wine.
- Yes.

885
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:38,666
But the wine that this village produces,
it goes to the Cinzano Company

886
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,765
for the making of vermouth, does it not?

887
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:42,633
Some.

888
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:46,237
The products of the Cinzano Company
are appreciated even in Germany.

889
01:24:46,314 --> 01:24:49,010
No! Even in Germany.

890
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:54,446
You know, sir, the people
of Santa Vittoria often speak

891
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:58,959
of the valiant efforts
of the great German Army.

892
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:00,426
- Do they?
- Yes.

893
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:10,599
Mr. Mayor, how many bottles?

894
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:15,966
I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand.

895
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:19,275
You've had ample time
to make the inventory I requested.

896
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:23,909
Now, tell me, how many bottles
of wine are there in Santa Vittoria?

897
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,341
Oh.

898
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:29,121
Well, I can answer that quite easily, sir.

899
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,555
Please do.

900
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:31,886

BOMBOLINl: Exactly

902
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:44,771
310,000 bottles.

903
01:25:44,839 --> 01:25:46,670
Three hundred and ten thousand, huh?

904
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:50,232
Three hundred and ten thousand bottles.

905
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,871
Bombolini, you are lying.

906
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:56,108
Well...

907
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:59,513
Sergeant Traub's count is

908
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:03,554
three hundred seventeen thousand
six hundred and one.

909
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:07,359
That many?

910
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:12,188
- That many bottles.
- That many.

911
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:13,461
Well, that proves I'm not lying

912
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:14,659
because, if I was going to lie,

913
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:17,034
I wouldn't lie for 7,000 bottles, would I?

914
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:19,505
(LAUGHING) That would be stupid, no?

915
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:22,534
Yeah, that would be stupid.

916
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,511
Bombolini, it is your fate
to be a civil authority.

917

It is my fate to be a soldier.

What I'm about to say to you now

919
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:35,653
has nothing whatever to do
with my personal feelings,

920
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:39,591
but since I am a soldier,
I can only follow my orders.

921
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:52,965
What is it that you're
about to say to me, sir?

01:28:50,224 --> 01:28:53,785
I gave you my word
that we would cooperate

949
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:57,358
to avoid the shedding
of a single drop of blood.

950
01:28:58,099 --> 01:29:00,761
I now withdraw that guarantee

951
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:05,836
unless you're willing to compromise.

952
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:10,199
- What's your idea of a compromise?
- Sixty-forty.

953
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:13,805
Bombolini, Germany has no need
of vermouth.

954
01:29:13,881 --> 01:29:16,941
We are simply trying
to defray the cost of occupying,

955
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:19,350
and if necessary,
protecting this community.

956
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:24,380
But it's like paying a stranger
to sleep in your bed with your wife!

957
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,725
I suppose it is.

958
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:30,730
All right, then, 25%,
but that's as high as I'm willing to go.

959
01:29:30,798 --> 01:29:35,929
I couldn't ask my people
to rape themselves for 25%.

960
01:29:38,573 --> 01:29:40,564
For what figure, then,
would you be prepared

961
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:42,905
to ask your people to rape themselves?

962
01:29:42,977 --> 01:29:45,377
They won't do it

963
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:49,075
- for less than 50%.
-50%?

964
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:54,143
I doubt. I doubt
that my superiors could possibly agree.

965
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:56,019
But still...

966
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,852
Still, I suppose...

967
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:02,020
I suppose it does no harm to see
what I can do for you.

968
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:03,188
Oh.

969
01:30:03,264 --> 01:30:06,700
- You drive a very hard bargain, Bombolini.
- Who, me?

970
01:30:07,268 --> 01:30:12,865
Tell me, tell me, who was that
attractive woman we passed on the steps?

971
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,071
Oh!

972
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:30,991
And frankly, to find someone like yourself
in a mountain town like this,

973
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:33,087
it's startling.

974
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:35,794
One grows lonely here, no?

975
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:39,060
The grapes, oxen, peasants, soldiers.

976
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:43,332
(SCOFFS) Not much to talk to, is there?

977
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:48,667
I think I know you.

978
01:30:48,743 --> 01:30:52,179
Want me to guess
where you used to spend your summers?

979
01:30:52,513 --> 01:30:54,310
Let me see.

980
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:56,475
Montreux.

981
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:59,349
And where would you go to ski?

982
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:00,819
Innsbruck.

983
01:31:01,756 --> 01:31:03,018
St. Moritz.

984
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:07,356
(LAUGHS) You see, same thing,
same place.

985
01:31:08,696 --> 01:31:11,324
I want you to come have dinner with me.

986
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:13,829
Monday.

987
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:17,470
If you say so.

988
01:31:19,507 --> 01:31:20,804
I say so.

989
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:49,699
They should be crying.
We are taking their wine.

990
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:52,466
I just don't understand these people, sir.

991
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:55,737
You didn't listen.
I told you. They're children.

992
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:59,609
They've probably hidden
an extra 1,000 bottles somewhere

993
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:02,308
and feel flushed with victory.

994
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:05,351
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Mayor Bombolini.

995
01:32:05,419 --> 01:32:07,387
- Yes, sir.
- If you please.

996
01:32:07,455 --> 01:32:10,515
At your service, sir, night and day.

997
01:32:11,259 --> 01:32:13,386
- Perhaps you can explain something.
- What?

998
01:32:13,461 --> 01:32:16,362
Why, in the circumstances,
are the people so gay?

999
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:21,668
Well, we Italians always try to look
at the bright side.

1000
01:32:21,736 --> 01:32:23,966
Unless we are depressed.

1001
01:32:25,172 --> 01:32:26,366
I see.

1002
01:32:27,408 --> 01:32:31,139
And which would you say
is the bright side of this situation?

1003
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:34,444
(LAUGHING)

1004
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:37,143
Now that you mention it, there isn't one.

1005
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:40,153
I guess we Italians are just naturally...

1006
01:32:40,821 --> 01:32:45,190
- Optimistic.
- Optimistic. Yes.

Stop it! Stand back!

Stand back!

01:33:40,581 --> 01:33:42,549
Sergeant.

1013
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:44,812
Put the herd swine on bread and water
for three days.

1014
01:33:44,885 --> 01:33:47,410
Maybe that will weaken
your sexual appetite.

1015
01:33:50,558 --> 01:33:53,584
Bombolini, I'm sorry for this.

(FABIO BREATHING HEAVILY)

1017

Fabio. Fabio.

01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:17,341
(GASPS)

1019
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:20,747
Angela, what are you doing here?

1020
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:25,615
I came to say thank you for what you did.

1021
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:33,657
It's 2:00 in the morning.

1022
01:34:33,734 --> 01:34:35,133
Mmm-hmm.

1023
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:41,765
Thank you, Fabio.

1024
01:34:48,482 --> 01:34:50,177
That's all right.

1025
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:52,779
I would do it again

1026
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:54,043
for you.

1027
01:34:56,557 --> 01:34:58,422
You shouldn't be here.

1028
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,855
Does it bother you for me to be here?

1029
01:35:05,566 --> 01:35:09,400
No! I don't think so.

1030
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:11,633
Just a little?

1031
01:35:15,342 --> 01:35:16,866
More than a little.

1032
01:35:19,146 --> 01:35:20,135
A lot!

1033
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:26,744
(PANTING) Angela, I think...
I think I want you!

- Angela!

Mayor Bombolini! Wake up!

1039
01:35:53,948 --> 01:35:56,746
What's all that noise?
What, are you drunk?

1040
01:35:58,786 --> 01:36:00,447
Rosa, is that you?

1041
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:02,715
Pax vobiscum, woman.

Shut up, you!

A crime is being committed,
Honorable Mayor.

1044

A crime?

1045
01:36:10,564 --> 01:36:14,864
You stay in there fast asleep,
and a man is seducing a virgin.

- Where?
- Right under your nose.

Who is the lucky girl?

1052
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:38,892
The lucky girl, Mayor Stupid of the
stupid city of Saint Stupid,

1053
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,890
is your daughter, Angela.

1054
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:46,996
Angela. My baby Angela.

1055
01:36:47,168 --> 01:36:50,467
It's impossible.
She can't do this to me!

1056
01:36:50,538 --> 01:36:52,768
You're telling the whole town.

1057
01:36:53,674 --> 01:36:57,235
Rosa. Rosa, maybe... Maybe it's love.

1058

She doesn't even know what love is,
and she's making it right now!

1059
01:37:02,716 --> 01:37:05,310
I brought her to you.
You were supposed to teach her.

1060
01:37:05,386 --> 01:37:07,149
It's the mother's fault!

1061
01:37:07,221 --> 01:37:09,655
I told you, shut up!

1062
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,891
Listen, Mayor Bombolini,

1063
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,487
I demand that you put on
your pants immediately

1064
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:18,225
and come down and kill him,

1065
01:37:18,299 --> 01:37:20,597
or kill yourself. I really don't care which.

1066
01:37:21,902 --> 01:37:23,062
Don't worry, Rosa.

1067
01:37:23,137 --> 01:37:27,767
I'm going to punish that boy
so he'll remember it the rest of his life.

Thank you, Padre. Thank you.

Hey, Babbaluche! Vittorini! Thank you.

01:37:59,907 --> 01:38:01,499
Good morning.

01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:04,668
Good morning.

1074
01:38:05,312 --> 01:38:08,213
They look quite well together, don't they?

1075
01:38:09,316 --> 01:38:10,476
Yes.

1076
01:38:11,352 --> 01:38:15,516
- Tonight, at 8:00, if you remember.
- I remember.

1077
01:38:23,697 --> 01:38:26,791
- There's going to be trouble.
- I had no choice.

1078
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:30,533
He didn't order you. It wasn't a command.

1079
01:38:30,971 --> 01:38:33,906
There are ways, Carlo,
of commanding without shouting.

1080
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:36,543
And what will you talk about, huh?

1081
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:38,143
All the people you know in common

1082
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:40,009
from the beaches and resorts
and all the right places?

1083
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,069
Perhaps.

1084
01:38:41,148 --> 01:38:44,208
- Things I wouldn't understand.
- I suppose not!

1085
01:38:50,491 --> 01:38:51,788
Carlo.

1086
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,327
Carlo, what are we doing to each other?
What's the sense in this?

1087
01:39:00,367 --> 01:39:02,267
I don't want you to go.

1088
01:39:03,404 --> 01:39:05,201
What's wrong, Carlo?

1089
01:39:05,406 --> 01:39:07,101
Are you afraid I'll jump
into the German's bed

1090
01:39:07,174 --> 01:39:09,267
because he gives me dinner?

1091
01:39:13,914 --> 01:39:16,712
I thought we knew each other
better than this.

1092
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,647
Let's go over it again.

1093
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:24,223
No promises.

1094
01:39:25,326 --> 01:39:29,319
I owe you nothing,
and you owe me nothing.

1095
01:39:30,597 --> 01:39:32,997
I have a body, and you have a body.

1096
01:39:34,735 --> 01:39:40,139
We are both grown people, and we can do
with them as we please.

1097
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:52,649
To the gentle life we knew
when there was peace.

1098
01:39:53,454 --> 01:39:54,944
A lovely toast.

1099
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:07,728
My father kept talking about the war.

1100
01:40:08,936 --> 01:40:10,836
I couldn't believe him.

1101
01:40:12,072 --> 01:40:17,339
I was young and in love and I knew
they wouldn't make war

1102
01:40:17,411 --> 01:40:19,106
and spoil it for me.

1103
01:40:19,646 --> 01:40:21,580
And they did, didn't they?

1104
01:40:23,317 --> 01:40:25,945
Why are you here? You don't belong here.

1105
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:27,986
And you?

1106
01:40:29,123 --> 01:40:31,648
In my case, I came to steal some wine.

1107
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:35,385
In mine, to hide.

1108
01:40:39,166 --> 01:40:44,069
All right, you've stolen your wine.
What keeps you here?

1109
01:40:46,573 --> 01:40:50,100
They haven't told me to go.
It might be weeks, who knows?

1110
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:53,045
They might even forget
about me completely.

1111
01:40:55,249 --> 01:40:57,046
What a wonderful thought.

1112

either way,

1114
01:41:05,459 --> 01:41:09,657

1115
01:41:11,532 --> 01:41:14,262
We're going to need each other, you and I.

1116
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:17,970
May I be quite frank?

1117
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:20,634
Please.

1118
01:41:21,642 --> 01:41:27,046
I find myself really attracted to you,
and not just physically.

1119
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:29,738
But that, too.

1120
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:32,908
Well,

1121
01:41:34,655 --> 01:41:36,418
that is quite frank.

1122
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:39,255
Does that offend you?

1123
01:41:41,829 --> 01:41:43,990
No. Not at all.

cut our evening short.

1128
01:42:10,157 --> 01:42:13,354
- Sir, an SS officer just arrived.
- Yes, I know.

1129
01:42:13,494 --> 01:42:17,328
Tell the gentleman that I'll be
at his disposal

1130
01:42:18,265 --> 01:42:20,495
after I've finished my dinner.

1131
01:42:23,504 --> 01:42:25,472
I'm sorry but...

1132
01:42:25,873 --> 01:42:28,467
Well, perhaps it's just as well
for my reputation

1133
01:42:28,542 --> 01:42:30,669
since the coffee here is truly dreadful.

1134
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:37,812
Next time you come,

1135
01:42:40,053 --> 01:42:43,580
I promise you we won't be disturbed.

1136
01:42:57,738 --> 01:43:00,901
Caterina, I'm sorry for what I said earlier.

1137
01:43:01,241 --> 01:43:02,674
CATERINA: It's all right.

1138
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:07,874
Did you have a pleasant evening?

1139
01:43:10,817 --> 01:43:13,411
It was not unpleasant. He's courteous.

1140
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:20,722
It kept grinding here in my head
all evening while you were gone.

1141
01:43:21,828 --> 01:43:23,489
Why I acted as I did.

1142
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,761
It's because I love you, Caterina.

1143
01:43:37,444 --> 01:43:39,674
I offer you, Caterina Malatesta,

1146
01:43:47,721 --> 01:43:49,814
No home, no money, no future.

1147
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:56,829
How does such a generous offer
appeal to you?

1148
01:44:04,838 --> 01:44:08,467
- Carlo. Carlo, I...
- I know.

1149
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:11,067
I know. But you'll think about it.

1150
01:44:16,149 --> 01:44:18,379
Carlo, leave things the way they are.

1151
01:44:19,486 --> 01:44:22,284
You said yourself it's best that way.

1152
01:44:22,756 --> 01:44:23,745
But

Scipione is the chief bookkeeper
of the Montefalcone bottling plant.

Oh, it's a pleasure, sir.

This wine is only one-fifth of what
his records show is in Santa Vittoria.

1159
01:45:11,638 --> 01:45:14,664
In other words, four-fifths is missing.

1160
01:45:15,475 --> 01:45:16,464
Four-fifths?

1161
01:45:17,544 --> 01:45:20,570
What happened to the rest
of the wine, Captain?

1162

Say, he's made a great mistake.
Four-fifths.

CAPTAIN: All right!

1170
01:45:47,474 --> 01:45:52,173
Bombolini, I ask you to tell us,
as a reasonable man,

1171
01:45:54,214 --> 01:45:57,650
to save both of us further effort
and further pain.

1172
01:45:59,853 --> 01:46:00,842
Captain,

1173
01:46:02,989 --> 01:46:05,685
this is unworthy of you.

1174
01:46:06,893 --> 01:46:10,590
How can I tell you about the wine
when there is no wine?

1175
01:46:14,167 --> 01:46:17,694
We could do with a little less grace
and a little more personality.

1176
01:46:17,771 --> 01:46:19,602
It works better with these people.

1177
01:46:19,673 --> 01:46:22,506
I know these people very well, Lieutenant.

1178
01:46:23,777 --> 01:46:26,473
I can handle this matter my own way.

1179
01:46:26,613 --> 01:46:29,844
How much more time would you suggest
for your way, Captain?

1180
01:46:29,916 --> 01:46:34,910
Thirty-six hours. If I don't find the wine,
I'll turn the matter over to your men.

1181
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:39,256
Thirty-six hours.

to see me like this.

I've seen you worse, my hero.

1186
01:47:34,714 --> 01:47:38,480
You couldn't bring yourself to say
something nice at a time like this?

1187
01:47:39,786 --> 01:47:42,949
With a face like that,
do you want me to kiss you?

1188
01:47:44,090 --> 01:47:46,388
You never cared for me, did you?

There was a time, I guess,
when I loved you.

That first year we were married.

out of the rain,

It was one day too many.

You were nothing but a big, stupid clown,

1195

and I lost my respect for you.

Keep still.

than the truth.

No, not you. I could be dead,
you would walk up to my grave,

spit in my face and tell me the truth.

No. You are the Mayor, Bombolini.

Yes, sir?

1265

The time is up now.

1266
01:55:28,821 --> 01:55:29,810
Time?

1267
01:55:32,358 --> 01:55:34,849
- How stupid can you be?
- What, sir?

1268
01:55:37,063 --> 01:55:38,758
- Bombolini.
- What?

1269
01:55:39,132 --> 01:55:41,157
You won't believe
what's going to happen now.

1270

I know, sir.

And when it does,
the responsibility is yours.

- But, sir...
- Yours!

1273
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,933
So I ask you the last time,

1274
01:55:52,312 --> 01:55:54,041
where's the wine?

1275
01:55:54,814 --> 01:56:00,309
Sir, I have told you.
I promise you, there is no wine.

- How many do you need?
- We prefer two.

All right, two then.

I have good news for you.
The Germans are here.

They want to see two of you
in order of importance.

to choose anyone for this.

1284
01:56:54,107 --> 01:56:56,166
Captain, I just couldn't do it.

1285
01:56:56,309 --> 01:56:59,938
Captain, you can kill me right now.

1286
01:57:00,013 --> 01:57:02,675
Right here, but I won't do it!

1287
01:57:08,021 --> 01:57:10,080
Captain, I have an idea.

1288
01:57:11,224 --> 01:57:13,852
Why not pick the first two men
who happen to come to the piazza?

1289
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:16,722
That way, I won't have the responsibility.

1290
01:57:16,796 --> 01:57:19,765
Not even you would have
the responsibility.

1291

We could leave it up to God.

1292
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:29,667
I would have said the Devil.

Not your wife, not the priest,
none of your friends, nobody.
