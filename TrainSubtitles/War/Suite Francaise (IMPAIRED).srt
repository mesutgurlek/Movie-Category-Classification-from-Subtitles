(Lucile) 'It began with a storm in June.

German bombs had fallen

'But deep in the countryside
the war still felt far away

'and I remained preoccupied

'with the one I was already fighting
much closer to home.'

10

We'll be late.

11
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,353
Do you really think
we should go out today?

12
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,188
Why ever not?

13
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,250

'My mother-in-law,
Madame Angellier,

'refused to accept

'even as the first refugees from Paris
started to arrive.

'Three years before I'd married
her precious son at my father's insistence

the farmers would be home.'

Have you heard anything
from your son?

26
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,730
No, not for over a week.
And you?

27
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,107
No, nothing from either of our boys.

28
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,361
- People say Paris is going to fall.
- People say a lot of things.

(Madame Angellier) Lucile?

30
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,201
Madame, it's...

31
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,120
It's a big farm.

32
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,332
And it's been difficult
without my brothers.

33
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,959
We'll put what they owe us
down to next month.

34
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,586
If I make any exceptions,

35
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,464
then Gaston wouldn't have
a home of his own to return to,

36
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,217
and then what would
he have been fighting for?

37
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,764
Come along, Lucile.

38
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,223
Good morning.

39
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,186
They don't want to pay the rent
but they don't think twice

40
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,813
about buying silk stockings
for that daughter of theirs.

41
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,649
Did you see?

42
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,069
I know it seems harsh,
but if you show them any weakness,

43
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,612
they'll bleed you dry.

44
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,199
When Gaston comes home,
he'll see he has a wife

45
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,159
who knows what it is
to be a land...

46
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,828
Stop! Stop the car!

47
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,668
(Horn blaring)

48
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,923
- We should turn back.
- No.

(Horn blaring)

50
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,221
We've got potatoes to buy
and four more rents to collect.

Madman.

52
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,983
The sack looks heavy.

53
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,110
He can manage.

54
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,155
- How much do we owe you?
- Four francs.

55
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,534
(Grunts)

56
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,123
Thank you.

57
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:36,544
There are more cars on the road,
from Paris.

58
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,463
My father always said,

59
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,841
"If you want to see what people
are truly made of, you start a war."

Go and see how long it goes on for.

66
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,190
(Man) Keep up.

67
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,735
Keep up.

68
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,822
Excuse me, Madame.

69
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,908
I wouldn't ask for me,
but my wife's very tired.

70
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,453
We've walked all the way from Paris.
Could she rest in your car?

71
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,914
Yes. Yes, yes, of course.

72
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,207
Thanks.

Anna? Anna?

83

- Thank you.
- Lucile.

84
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,551
We need to get off the road.
Could you take us to the nearest town?

85
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,685
Hey, you!

86
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,938
Get away from my car!

87
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:49,320
(Muffled crying and shouting continues)

88
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,615
Lucile! Get in the car!

89
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,375

you damn well do it.

Move, move!

Madame Perrin,
It's Lucile Angellier, Gaston's wife.

100

Get out of the damn way.
You've got to leave, they're coming.

a great tragedy
has befallen our nation.

111
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:36,862
Millions have fled their homes,
many thousands have lost their lives,

112
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,949
and the fate of a whole generation
of brave young men

113

still remains unknown.

114
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:49,124
Only God knows
what's in store for all of us

115
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,004
and the country
that we can no longer call our own.

116
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,632
- We must hold firm together.
- (Vehicles approaching)

117
00:11:56,758 --> 00:12:01,261
We must put aside anything
that will divide us from our neighbour.

118
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:07,267
We must unite into one being,
one family under God.

119
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,021
They're here already.

120
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,607
Let us pray.

121
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,112
- Anna, stand up.
- Our Father who art in heaven,

122

hallowed be thy name.

123
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,492
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

124
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,870
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

125

as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

126

Lead us not into temptation
and deliver us from evil.

a new constitution
of the French state is signed,

guaranteeing the rights of labour,
of family and of the fatherland.

You are defeated
and we are now in charge.

133

All firearms must be surrendered

134

tomorrow morning.

"The sword will become our plough
and from the tears of war..."

- How long will they be here?
- I don't know.

"...the daily bread
of future generations will grow."

if I'm living by German time.

Madame Angellier,
I'm Oberleutnant Bruno von Falk.

148
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,947
You have been told to expect me?

Madame.

150

I will try not to inconvenience you.

these gifts we are about to receive.

158

to share his bounty with us.

keep them safe.

(Bruno) Madame.

167
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:41,625
May I kindly request the key
to the piano and the desk?

168
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,756
I give you my word that they will
be treated with the utmost care.

169
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,760
Marthe will give you the key.

170
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,721
Good evening.

171
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,689
He'll be playing "Deutschland Über Alles"
before we know it.

Did you find somewhere to stay?

175
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,782
Yes, thank you.

176
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,081
(Madeleine) Have you seen this one?

177
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:15,385
We have to take German money.
We can't go out after nine.

178
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,598
And God help you if you're found
listening to De Gaulle on the radio.

179
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,062
Have you got anyone?

180
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,648
- An officer.
- Oh.

181
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:32,611
That's the price you pay for having
the best house in the village, I suppose.

182
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,614
And you?

183
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,074
Hm... nobody.

184
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,369
The only benefit of having the worst.

185
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,423
Why does she look at me like that?

186
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,008
You don't know?

187
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:00,972
Your mother-in-law moved her
and her parents into a barn.

188
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:06,436
Then she put a refugee from Paris
into their home and doubled the rent.

189
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,030
(Clerk) Nächste.

190
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,494
Name, occupation, address?

Benoit Labarie, farmer,
the Montmort estate.

- Viscountess.
- Benoit.

195
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,021
- Viscount.
- Excuse me.

196
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,066
Your wife and children were
in church yesterday. Where were you?

197
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:57,487
Working, not that you'd know
anything about that.

198
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,451
Benoit, please be careful
what you say to them.

199

We've been their tenants for generations.
They never give us anything but grief.

- Bitte.
- Danke.

Get inside, girls.

204
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:42,300
We'll have to get used to it, I'm afraid,
along with everything else.

'There had been no men

I'm going that way anyway.

217

You can say, "No, thank you."

Oh, that's not for in here.

(Marthe) You're not going to like this.

Really?

238
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,380
Yeah. If you don't believe me,

I was staying at the chateau.

- A lieutenant.

I don't believe
your mother-in-law is a music lover.

00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,303
My father was dying.

323
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,432
He wanted to... find me a... good man.

324
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,226
A rich man.

325
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,229
What have I done?

326
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,609
I see everything
that goes on in this house.

327
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,655
Please, he only asked
to go into the garden.

328
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,532
You should have stood up and left.

329
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,450
Do you expect me
to be confined to my bedroom?

330
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:55,913
- I expect you to be a faithful wife.
- I am.

331
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,790
Then how can you speak,
how can you even breathe,

332
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,459
when you know that your husband
has been hunted down

333
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:01,919
by these animals?

334
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:06,048
When I see them,
I want to rip their eyes out.

335
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,178
What's happened?

336
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,349
We've just heard that...

337
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,770
...Gaston's unit is
in a labour camp in Germany.

338
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:24,650
Your husband is a prisoner of war.

339
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:30,489
This German is our enemy.
Do you understand?

340
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,701
Yes.

341
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,875
Madame.

342
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,961
I can't talk to you.

343
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,635
I should have believed you.

344
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,763
I think this is why
you came into my room.

345
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,476
I'm sorry.

Remember you're doing
the rents today, Lucile.

348
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,032
Come on, Marthe.
We're going to be late.

350
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,369
I'm going for a swim.

351
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,663
Can you swim?

352
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,209
The Viscount doesn't let the villagers
swim in the lake.

353
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,295
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean...

354
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,089
I meant with your infirmity,
can you...?

355
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,259
What happened?

356
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,097
My horse fell.
My leg was trapped.

357
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,977
Otherwise you would have fought, huh?

358
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,688
Yes, I would.

359
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:12,485
Nietzsche said
a man is made to be a warrior.

360
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,111
Have you read Nietzsche?

361
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:19,116
He also said...

362
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:23,788
...a woman is made
to please the warrior.

363
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:32,338
His leg, did it happen
before or after you were married?

364
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:35,216
After.

365
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,474
Beautiful scent.

366
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,852
Perhaps I could buy a bouquet
for my bedroom,

367
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,562
cheer it up a little.

368
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:52,107
Madeleine... we've got
to bring the animals in.

369
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:57,196
Hey, a vase by my bed,
if that's no trouble.

370
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,483
It's all there, Madame Angellier.

371
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,361
You'll get double that next-door now.

372

(♪ "Ode to Joy" being played on a recorder)

373
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,628
(Lucile) I learned that piece
when I was young.

374
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,965
My father taught it to me.

375
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:03,971
- Anna's father taught her too.
- Oh! Is he...?

376
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,933
He and my other daughter
got separated from us.

377
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,310
But, er...

378
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:12,062
But they'll be joining us soon, hm?

379
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,650
That's enough practice for today.

380
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,445
Why don't you go outside and play?

381
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,159
Stay close to the house.

382
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:30,372
- She's lovely.
- Thank you.

(Lucile) I'm sorry.

388

It's just hard

Please.

I thought you'd handed in your gun.

I did, the one that was registered.

400

- (Marthe) People have been killed for less.
- I need it.

401
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:31,178
Why don't you tell her
why you're here?

402
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:34,556
The German... in my home,

403
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,767
he's chasing after Madeleine.

404
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,231
The officer that lives here
could put pressure on him.

405
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,775
- I don't speak to him.
- That's not what I've heard.

406
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:51,657
I'm not here to criticise you.
I just want him moved.

407
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,077
Please.

408
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,295
You have a complaint
about a German soldier?

409
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,465
- I apologise.
- So you'll do something?

410
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:13,053
I have no influence over him.
We are of equal rank.

411
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,680
So it's one rule for us
and another for them?

412
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,807
That's not what I said.

413
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,018
We lost the war. We don't have
to lose our women as well.

414
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:24,815
Then perhaps you should have thought
of protecting them earlier, my friend.

415
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,027
Please.

416
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,283
I will try.

417
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,078
But it might only make it worse.

418
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,747
Tell him to leave her in peace.

419
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,876
I won't ask again.

420
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,728
Our regiment could leave at any time.

421
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:09,484
I couldn't stand to think...
that you hated me.

422

There's hardly any left.
Your men have taken it all.

425
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,041
Or wine.

426
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,335
I'll talk to Bonnet,

427
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:30,797
but in return I only ask
that we be decent to one another.

428
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,302
Where's the harm in that?

429
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:38,680
My mother-in-law
would throw me out.

430

She'll be another half an hour.

Just one drink.

How did you become a soldier?

434
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,540
I'm from a military family.
It was expected of us.

435
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,753
My brothers and I signed up
on the same day.

436
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:13,465
Your brothers, where are they?

437
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,759
One was killed in Poland.

438
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,971
Another one in Normandy.

439
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:23,433
The youngest has just left for Africa.

440
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,561
People shouldn't be sacrificed like this.

441
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:31,483
- I mean none of us.
- I can't think like that.

442
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:37,114
Questioning only makes things
more difficult.

443
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,740
Do you believe in the war?

444
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,245
Let's say I believe
in the communal spirit.

445
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,123
None of us like to admit it,

446
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:50,294
but single actions on their own
don't mean anything.

447
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:53,964
So why is it that whenever I see you
you're always on your own?

448
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,426

00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,882
(Madame Angellier) Lucile?

483
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,761
You knew, didn't you?

484
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,389
That your perfect son
has been having an affair

485
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,349
that was going on
before we even met.

486
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,478
You should see
how many of those are about you.

487
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:33,613
You always say
how much you want a grandchild.

488
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:36,783
Now you've got one.
Her name's Simone.

489
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:47,085
You can keep your stupid little secrets.
I couldn't care less.

490
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,253
(Slams door)

491
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:45,059
(Footsteps approaching)

492
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,441
Can I play you something?

493
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,609
It's very beautiful.

494
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,325
What is it?

495
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:47,997
I married a man I'd only met twice.

496
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:51,793
I tried to convince myself
that we were in love.

497
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,966
I might as well have been dead.

498
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,360
It's not possible.

499
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,373
(Knocking)

500
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:31,833
Lucile?

501
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,960
I'm coming.

502
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,134
Madame wants to see you
straight away.

503
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,553
You remember Madame Perrin?

504
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:46,931
Yes, of course.

505
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,229
What brings you back
from the Free Zone, Madame?

506
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,649
My son died in Normandy
as the Germans advanced.

507
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,444
I've just received permission
to visit his grave.

508
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,904
I'm sorry to hear.

509
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,906
(Madame Angellier) How are things in Lyon?

510
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:04,073
(Madame Perrin) Bad.

511
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,319
At least you don't have a German
living in your house.

512
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,328
Yes.

513
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:11,289
I heard about your officer.
He's friendly?

514
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:14,709
(Scoffs) Well, I won't have anything to do
with him, but Lucile does, don't you?

515
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,503
(Madame Perrin) Oh, but that's good.

516
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:21,799
We had to leave in such a hurry
that certain things were left behind.

517
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:24,177
The Germans are using our house now.

518
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:26,679
Could you go there
and get them back?

519
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:41,527
(Laughter and chatter in German)

520
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:17,230
So this is what it means
to be protected by the German army?

521
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:25,822
Lucile.

522
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:28,658
Wait.

523
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,201
Look at me.

524
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:38,042
What happens in there
is indefensible.

525
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,503
I have nothing in common
with these people.

526
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,309
The only person
I've something in common with...

527
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,147
...is you.

528
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,399
No.

529
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:32,638
(Lucile) 'A set of false teeth,
a china dinner service,

530

'But none knew

Most of it is here.

537
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,794
I apologise for any damages.

538
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:13,846
Well done.

539
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:17,975
At least you've got the nerve
to stand up to these scum.

540
00:58:42,895 --> 00:58:44,061
(Door opening)

541
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,495
Marthe, can you take
these bags upstairs, please?

542

(Whispers) On Thursday
she's going to visit her sister.

543
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:08,002
- We'd have the house to ourselves.
- All right.

544
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,462
(Door opens)

545
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:22,243
(Viscountess) Come back here.
Come back here!

546
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:25,705
Benoit Labarie!

547
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:29,083
So you're the one
who's been stealing from us.

548
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,376
You thief.

549
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:36,132
What do you expect us to do?
You traitors would see us starve.

550
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:38,092
How dare you speak to me like that?

551
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,886
I'll speak to you how I like.

552
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:46,100
I'm not the only one who comes here.

553
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:50,313
We all do,
and it's only going to get worse.

554
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:53,441
- Get out of here.
- Chickens.

555
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:00,031
- Give me my fucking chickens!
- Please...

556
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,660
You'd better pray
your German friends stay a long time,

557
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:07,038
because the day they leave...

558
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:12,585
I caught him.

559
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,170
It's Labarie.

560
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:17,798
- I told you to let it lie.
- He still has a gun.

561
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,635
So does half the town,
including myself.

562
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,975
He tried to shoot me with it.

563
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,733
You need to do something.

564
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:24,824

What have you done?

571
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:40,024
Go. I'll distract them.

572
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:45,738

I have a warrant for the arrest
of Benoit Labarie. Where is he?

575
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:04,173
He's in the field.

576
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:17,561
I don't know what's wrong
with you farmers.

577

Always stashing your guns
in the same places.

Come down.

01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,902
You won't be
in the labour camp for long.

580
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:28,280
The Viscount begged for leniency.
It's likely to be a year.

581
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,407
Plenty of time
for me to fuck your wife

in Buchenwald.

583

Get off me!

584
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,314
Fuck you.

586
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:06,277
Stay there. Don't move.

No. Benoit!

Is your mother-in-law at home?

597
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:24,772
She's away for the night.
What's happened?

598
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,526
How do you know where he is?

599
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,487
There's an old hunting lodge
in the woods.

600
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,281
No one's offered to take him in?

601
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,368
That's why I'm here.

602
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,998
They let me go
but they're watching me.

603
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,293
If they're watching...

604
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,254
...you shouldn't have come here.

Look, Benoit's a good man.

606
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:55,177
No one else is going to help him.

607
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:59,431
He can't move very fast
and they'll hunt him and find him.

608
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:03,477
And when they do, they'll kill him.
Do you know that?

609
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:07,022
You're the only one
that can help me now. Please.

Your officer won't be coming, you know.

How romantic.

I'm going to have to talk

643
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:02,270
- Not even his wife?
- I couldn't risk it.

644
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,775
You should have asked me first.

645
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,737
(Shouting and screaming)

646
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:22,499
My grandfather put this here
during the last war.

647
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,295
Get in, quickly.

648
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:30,382
Don't make a sound.

649
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,004
Why are you doing this?

650
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:14,926
Seeing him dressed in Gaston's clothes,
it made me think...

651
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:17,888
...it could be my son.

652
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:21,057
(Footsteps approaching)

653
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:22,684
They're here.

654
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:31,193
Madame.

655
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:33,820
We are looking for Benoit Labarie.

656
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:39,409
(Shouting in German)

657
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:56,885
Lucile.

658
01:15:58,221 --> 01:15:59,971
Lucile, I couldn't get back.

659
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,854
- No!
- Celine, stop!

660
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:09,773
Gustav.

661
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,693
(Soldier)

662
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:23,787
We were searching the woods all night.

663
01:16:24,372 --> 01:16:25,538
I know.

664
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:51,982
Lucile, tell me.
Something's wrong.

665
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:57,445
I made a mistake.

666
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:06,079
(Gustav) Where's your daughter?

667
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:11,084
- Where's your daughter?
- She's with her father.

668
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,590
We'll come back for her.

669
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:23,096
Have your feelings changed?

670
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:26,016
Yes.

671
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:27,892
You're lying.

672
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:33,064
(Soldier)

673
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:16,816
A wake is being held
for Offizier Bonnet,

674
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:20,028
but we don't have enough table linen,
so could we borrow some of yours?

675
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:24,199
It belonged to my mother.

676
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:28,370
I trust you will return it
in its original state.

677
01:18:28,496 --> 01:18:29,537
Of course.

678
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:33,249
(Orders issued in German)

679
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:55,271
Anna?

680
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:21,631
(Soldier)

681
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:50,535
Don't fret, you mustn't.
There's still time.

682
01:19:52,163 --> 01:19:53,955
Somebody might give him up.

683
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,168
- You know, Benoit didn't...
- I know. I know.

684
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:00,545
You did the right thing.

685
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:04,466
God can see into our hearts.

686
01:20:27,615 --> 01:20:29,115
I love you.

687
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:35,205
I love you too.

688
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,003

they're just like us after all,

(Lighter clicks)

699
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,386
I won't hide here
till the war's over.

700
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:24,934
I'm not afraid of dying.
I just want it to be for a reason.

701
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:29,063
- What can you do?
- I know people, in Paris.

702
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:30,231
Who?

703
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:33,484
People who are getting organised,
fighting back.

704
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:37,613
You'll never get past the checkpoints.
They're everywhere.

705
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,907
What if I take him?

706
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:42,118
Lucile, you can't do that.

707
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:43,411
I'm taking you.

708
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:48,291
What about the travel pass?

709
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:03,347
I know where you're going,
you fucking German whore.

710
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,234
He's safe.

711
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:40,843
(German soldiers laughing and chatting)

712
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:45,056
(♪ Rosita Serrano's "Bel Ami" playing)

713
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:29,016
What are you doing here?

714
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:36,357
I need a travel pass.

715
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:39,610
I have to drive to Paris.

716
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:44,824
One of our tenants needs medicine.
His daughter's very ill.

717
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:50,246
You heard about the Viscount?

718
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,042
Yes.

719
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,169
You must hate me now.

720
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:00,506
I would if I were you.

721
01:27:04,595 --> 01:27:05,761
This tenant...

722
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:10,433
Has he come to the house?

723
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:15,021
- No.
- That's a shame.

724
01:27:19,318 --> 01:27:22,403
My orderly says he could smell
a different man's tobacco.

725
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:27,199
He thinks you're hiding someone.

726
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:32,622
And you?

727
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:43,382
If I had even the slightest suspicion,

728
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,427
it would be my duty to act on it.

729
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:51,974
I know that.

730
01:27:56,813 --> 01:28:01,442
I said it was mine,
a gift from my wife.

731
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:15,039
I'll instruct my orderly
to issue the pass.

732
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:21,295
Thank you.

733
01:28:40,691 --> 01:28:44,026
We will see each other again.

734
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,280
Not as a soldier.

735
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:53,911
You won't even recognise me.

736
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:12,722
Be careful... with your life.

737
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:24,525
Is it precious to you?

738
01:29:26,153 --> 01:29:27,570
Yes.

739
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:34,118
It is precious to me.

740
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,361
Jawohl.

(Madame Angellier) This is everything
you'll need.

743
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:11,025
And, er... Gaston left us this.

744
01:32:12,402 --> 01:32:14,236
Just in case.

745
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:22,745
(Door opens)

746
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:33,422
Thank you.

747
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:50,439
Gaston will come back.

748
