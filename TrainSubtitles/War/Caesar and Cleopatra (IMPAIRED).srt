1
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,250
(Men Laughing)

2
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,522
(Dice Rattling]

3
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,884
By Apis!

4
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,481
Persian, thy gods are good to thee.

5
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,061
Try yet again, O Captain.
Double or quits.

6
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:38,392
No more. I'm not in the vein.

7
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:51,038
Captain! A stranger approaches!

8
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,573
Stand! Who goes there?

9
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,649
The bearer of evil tidings.

10
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,479
(Captain]
Pass him in!

11
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,332
(Laughing]

12
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,464
Who art thou that laughest
in the house of Cleopatra the queen...

13
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:24,065
and in the teeth of Belzanor,
the captain of her guard?

14
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,169
I am Bel Affris, descended from the gods.

15
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,078
- Hail, cousin.
- (Others) Hail, cousin!

16
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:35,177
(Laughs) All the queen's guards
are descended from the gods... save myself.

17
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,849
I am a Persian descended from many kings.

18
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,926
Hail, cousins.

19
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,324
Hail, mortal.

20
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:46,296
You have been in battle, Bel Affris,
and you are a soldier among soldiers.

21
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:50,130
You will not let the queen's women
have the first of your tidings.

22
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,204
I have no tidings...

23
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:57,003
except that we shall all
have our throats cut presently...

24
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,840
women, soldiers and all.

25
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,914
I thought so.
Tell us what befell.

26
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,108
- Aye! Tell us!
- Tell us! Tell us!

27
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:09,144
Know then that I serve in the guard
of the temple of Ra here in Memphis.

28
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,416
We went to Alexandria
to inquire of King Ptolemy...

29
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,856
how we of Egypt should deal
with the Roman, Pompey...

30
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,724
newly come to our shores after his defeat
by Caesar at Pharsalia.

31
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,458
Caesar defeated Pompey?
Does Roman, then, fight Roman?

32
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,058
Even as Egyptian fights Egyptian.

33
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,969
What did you learn from the queen's brother,
Ptolemy the pretender?

34
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:31,339
We learnt that Caesar is coming also
in hot pursuit of his foe...

35
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,844
and that Ptolemy has slain Pompey.

36
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,108
Nay, more.
We found that Caesar is already come.

37
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,047
For we had not made half a day's journey
on our way back...

38
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:41,120
when we came upon a city rabble
fiying from his legions.

39
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,123
And ye the temple guard...
did you not withstand these legions?

40
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,853
What men could, that we did.

41
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,156
But this Caesar throws a legion at you
where you are weakest...

42
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,163
as he throws a stone from a catapult.

43
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:57,362
And that legion is as a man with one head,
a thousand arms... and no religion.

44
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,995
- I have fought against them, and I know.
- (Soldiers Chortling)

45
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,131
- Were you frightened, cousin?
- (Laughing)

46
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,905
- No, cousin, but I was beaten.
- (Laughing)

47
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,674
- Could you not die?
- There was no time.

48
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,373
All was over in a moment.

49
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:14,283
But now I am come to warn you
that you must open your gates to Caesar...

50
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,514
for his advance guard
is scarce an hour behind me...

51
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,183
and there is not an Egyptian warrior
left standing between you and his legions.

52
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,193
- Woe! Alas!
- Nail him to the door! Quick!

53
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:27,190
Now this news will run through the palace
like fire through stubble.

54
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,598
What shall we do
to save the women from the Romans?

55
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,762
- Why not kill them?
- Because we should have to pay blood money.

56
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,636
Better let the Romans kill them.
It's cheaper.

57
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,609
- O subtle one. O serpent.
- But your queen.

58
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,976
True. We must carry off Cleopatra.
I will take her on the crupper of my horse.

59
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,879
- (Women Screaming)
- Fly! Fly!

60
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:49,387
- What's the matter now?
- The sacred white cat has been stolen!

61
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,083
(Screaming, Shouting)

62
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:57,689
 (Blowing Horn)

63
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,284
(Hammer Ringing On Anvil)

64
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,395
(Men Chattering)

65
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,682
Hail, Sphinx.

66
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,886
Salutation from Julius Caesar.

67
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,122
I have wandered in many lands
seeking the lost region...

68
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,533
from which my birth into this world
exiled me...

69
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,435
and the company of creatures
such as I myself.

70
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:52,702
I found fiocks and pastures,
men and cities...

71
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,871
but no other Caesar...

72
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,610
no air native to me,
no man kindred to me...

73
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:02,882
none who can do my day's deed
or think my night's thought.

74
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,549
In the little world yonder, Sphinx...

75
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:09,116
my place is as high as yours
in this great desert.

76
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:13,562
Only I wander, and you sit still.

77
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,260
I conquer, and you endure.

78
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,394
I work and wonder.

79
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,438
You watch and wait.

80
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,341
Sphinx, you and I...
strangers to the race of men...

81
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,913
are no strangers to one another.

82
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:32,144
Have I not been conscious of you
and of this place since I was born?

83
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,651
Rome is a madman's dream.

84
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:39,424
This is my reality.

85
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,654
My way hither was the way of destiny...

86
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,789
for I am he of whose genius
you are the symbol-

87
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,335
part brute, part woman...

88
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,463
and part god.

89
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,939
Nothing of man in me at all.

90
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,434
Have I read your riddle, Sphinx?

91
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,537
(Woman]
Old gentleman.

92
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,946
Immortal gods.

93
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,019
Old gentleman, don't run away.

94
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,423
"Old gentleman, don't run away"?

95
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,152
- This toJulius Caesar?
- Old gentleman.

96
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,589
Sphinx, you presume on your centuries.

97
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,865
I'm younger than you, though your voice
is but a girl's voice as yet.

98
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,100
Climb up here, quickly,
or the Romans will come and eat you.

99
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,275
A child at its breast.

100
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,713
A divine child.

101
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,717
Come up, quickly.

102
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,185
You must get up at its side
and creep round.

103
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,292
Who are you?

104
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,692
Cleopatra, queen of Egypt.

105
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,465
Queen of the Gypsies, you mean.

106
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,333
You mustn't be disrespectful to me,
or the sphinx will let the Romans eat you.

107
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,406
Come up. It's quite cozy here.

108
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,278
What a dream.

109
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,643
What a magnifiicent dream.

110
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,148
Only let me not wake.
(Laughs)

111
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,150
Take care.

112
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,354
Ah. That's right. Now sit down.

113
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,188
You may have the other paw.

114
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,525
It is very powerful and will protect us...

115
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,497
but it wouldn't take any notice of me
or keep me company.

116
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,036
I'm glad you've come.
I was very lonely.

117
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,196
Did you happen to see
a white cat anywhere?

118
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,001
Have you lost one?

119
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,940
Yes. The sacred white cat.
Isn't it dreadful?

120
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,069
I brought him here
to sacrifice him to the sphinx.

121
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,704
But when we got a little way from the city,
a black cat called him...

122
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,045
and he jumped out of my arms
and ran away to it.

123
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,952
Do you think that the black cat
can have been...

124
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,785
my great-great-great-grandmother?

125
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,349
Your great-great-great-grandmother?

126
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,294
Well, why not? Nothing would surprise me
on this night of nights.

127
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,661
I think it must have been.

128
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,666
My great-great-grandmother's
great-grandmother...

129
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,168
was a black kitten of the sacred white cat.

130
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,933
And my blood is made with Nile water.

131
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,940
That is why my hair is so wavy.

132
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,438
What are you doing here this time of night?

133
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,982
- Do you live here?
- Of course not. I am the queen.

134
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:21,144
And I shall live in the palace of Alexandria
when I've killed my brother who drove me out of it.

135
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,244
When I'm old enough, I shall do just what I like.

136
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,018
I shall be able to poison the slaves
and see them wriggle...

137
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:31,290
and pretend to Ftatateeta, my nurse,
that she's to be put into the fiery furnace.

138
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:35,197
Meanwhile, why are you not at home
and in bed?

139
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,929
Because the Romans are coming
to eat us all.

140
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,063
- You aren't at home in bed either.
- Oh, yes, I am.

141
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:46,338
I live in a tent, and I am now in that tent
fast asleep and dreaming.

142
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:50,381
Do you suppose I believe you are real,
you impossible little dream witch?

143
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,078
You are a funny old gentleman.
I like you.

144
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,654
That spoils the dream.

145
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,656
Why don't you dream that I'm young?

146
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:02,455
I wish you were.
Only I think I should be more afraid of you.

147
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:06,657
I like men, especially young men
with round, strong arms.

148
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,666
But I'm afraid of them.

149
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,498
You are old and rather wrinkly.

150
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:15,040
But you have a nice voice,
and I like to have someone to talk to.

151
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,302
Though I think you are a little mad.

152
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,470
It is the moon that makes you
talk to yourself in that silly way.

153
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,479
Oh, you heard that, did you?

154
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,811
I was saying my prayers to the Great Sphinx.

155
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,818
- But this isn't the Great Sphinx.
- What?

156
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,911
This is only a dear little kitten
of the sphinx.

157
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,514
Why, the Great Sphinx is so big,
it has a temple between its paws.

158
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,151
This is my pet sphinx.

159
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,856
Tell me. Do you think the Romans
have any sorcerers...

160
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,989
who could take us away from the sphinx
by magic?

161
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,068
Why? Are you afraid of the Romans?

162
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,832
Oh, they would eat us if they caught us.
They are barbarians.

163
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,736
Their chief is called Julius Caesar.

164
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,071
His father was a tiger
and his mother a burning mountain...

165
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,077
and his nose is like an elephant's trunk.

166
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,876
They all have long noses
and ivory tusks and little tails...

167
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,382
and seven arms
with a hundred arrows in each.

168
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,852
And they live on human fiesh.

169
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,855
Would you like me to show you
a real Roman?

170
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,188
No. Oh, you're frightening me.

171
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,161
No matter. This is only a dream.

172
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,232
- It is not a dream. It is not a dream. See?
- (Yelps)

173
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,631
How dare you!

174
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,330
You said you were dreaming.
I... I only wanted to show you.

175
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,406
Oh, come, come. Don't cry.

176
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,408
- (Sniffiing)
- A queen mustn't cry.

177
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,208
Cleopatra, can you see my face well?

178
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,444
Yes.

179
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,520
It is so white in the moonlight.

180
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,987
Are you sure it is the moonlight...

181
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,524
that makes me look whiter
than an Egyptian?

182
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:45,654
Do you notice that I have
a rather long nose?

183
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,926
- It is a Roman nose, Cleopatra.
- (Screams)

184
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,628
(Shrieking)
Bite him in two, sphinx! Bite him in two!

185
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,535
I meant to sacrifice the white cat.
Indeed I did. Indeed!

186
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,633
Cleopatra, shall I show you a way
to prevent Caesar from eating you?

187
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:02,009
Do, do, do. I will steal the crown jewels
and give them to you.

188
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,776
I will make the river Nile
water your lands twice a year.

189
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,352
My child, your gods are afraid of the Romans.

190
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,549
You see? The sphinx dare not bite me
nor prevent me carrying you off toJulius Caesar.

191
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,455
You won't. You won't.
You said you wouldn't.

192
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,496
Caesar never eats women,
but he eats girls and cats.

193
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:22,499
Now, you're a silly little girl,
and you're descended from the black kitten.

194
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,262
You're both a girl and a cat.

195
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,066
- And will he... eat me?
- Yes.

196
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,075
Unless you make him believe
that you're a woman.

197
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:35,637
Oh. Then you must get a sorcerer
to make a woman of me.

198
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,943
- Are you a sorcerer?
- Perhaps.

199
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,111
But it'll take a long time, and this very night
in the palace of your fathers...

200
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,246
you must stand face-to-face with Caesar.

201
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,755
No, no. I daren't!

202
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,555
Whatever dread may be in your soul,
however terrible Caesar may be to you...

203
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,120
you must confront him
as a brave woman and a great queen.

204
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,132
And you must feel no fear.

205
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,930
If your hand shakes,
if your voice quavers...

206
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,403
- Then night and death.
- (Sighs)

207
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,531
But if he thinks you worthy to rule...

208
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:07,806
he will set you on the throne by his side
and make you the real ruler of Egypt.

209
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:11,144
No. He will find me out.
He will find me out.

210
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,844
He is easily deceived by women.

211
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,980
- Their eyes dazzle him.
- Then we will cheat him.

212
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,558
If you do that,
he will eat you at one mouthful.

213
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,456
Oh, no, no. Please. I will be good.
I will do whatever you tell me.

214
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,119
- ** (Horn Blowing]
- I will be your slave.

215
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,960
- Hark.
- What was that?

216
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,364
Caesar's voice.

217
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,527
Let us run away.
Come! Oh, come!

218
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,834
You are safe with me until you
stand on your throne to receive Caesar.

219
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,306
- Lead me to your palace in the desert.
- Oh, I will. I will.

220
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,309
Come, come, come.
The gods are angry.

221
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,244
- Do you not feel the earth shaking?
- It is the tread of Caesar's legions.

222
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,646
This way, quickly.
And let us look for the white cat as we go.

223
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,877
It is he who has turned you into a Roman.

224
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,315
Incorrigible.

225
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,391
Oh, incorrigible.

00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,392

What place is this?

230
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,321
This is where I sit when I'm allowed
to wear my crown and robes.

- Of course.

to be lighted without my permission?

- Chief Nurse to...

I speak to the queen. Be silent.

Is this how your servants know their place?
Send her away.

Do as the queen has bid you.

245
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:54,444
You are the queen.
Send her away.

246
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:58,642
Ftatateeta, dear, you must go away.
just for a little.

247
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,219
You're not commanding her to go.
You're begging her.

248
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,187
You're no queen. You'll be eaten.
Farewell.

249
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,918
No, no, no! Don't leave me.

250
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,394
A Roman does not stay with queens
who are afraid of their slaves.

251
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:15,024
I am not afraid.
Indeed, I am not afraid.

We shall see who is afraid here.

Am I also a child that you dare
trifle with me?

Yes.

Have you remembered yourself, mistress?

259
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,758
O Queen, forget not thy servant
in the days of thy greatness.

A real, real queen.

Cleopatra, the queen.

Oh, I love you for making me a queen.

00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,607
But queens love only kings.

275
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,609
I will make all the men I love kings.

276
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:36,203
I will have many young kings
with round, strong arms.

277
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,773
And when I am tired of them,
I shall whip them to death.

But you will always be my king...

my nice, kind, wise, good old king.

Oh, my wrinkles.

281
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,488
You will be the most dangerous
of all Caesar's conquests.

Caesar? I forgot Caesar.

You will tell him that I'm a queen,
won't you? A real queen.

00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,100
Listen.

00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,435
Let us run away and hide
until Caesar is gone.

286

If you fear Caesar, you are no true queen.

And though you were to hide
beneath a pyramid...

288

Yes, the crown, Ftatateeta.
I shall wear the crown.

For whom must the queen
put on her state?

303
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,097
For a citizen of Rome. A king of kings.

He will not ask me.

He will know Cleopatra by her pride,
her courage...

her majesty and her beauty.

Is it sweet or bitter
to be a queen, Cleopatra?

Bitter.

00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:59,619
can find time to occupy himself
with such a trifie as our taxes?

471
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:04,058
My friend, taxes are the chief business
of a conqueror of the world.

472
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,857
You must pay, Pothinus.

473
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:10,958
But in return for your bounty, I will settle
this dispute about the throne for you, if you will.

474
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,537
You say the matter
has been at issue for a year.

475
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,801
- May I have 1 0 minutes at it?
- You will do as you please doubtless.

476
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,603
Good.

477
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,439
But first let us have Cleopatra here.

478
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,072
Cleopatra? She is not in Alexandria.

479
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,583
I think she is. Call Totateeta.

480
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,812
Ho there, Teetatota!

481
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:38,420
Who pronounces the name of Ftatateeta,
the queen's chief nurse?

482
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,521
(Caesar) No one can pronounce it, Tota,
except yourself.

483
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,536
Where's your mistress?

484
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,731
- (Giggles)
- (Crowd Murmuring]

485
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,105
Will the queen favor us
with her presence for a moment?

486
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,804
Am I to behave like a queen?

487
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,380
Yes.

488
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,676
You may go, Ftatateeta.

489
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,784
(Crowd Gasping]

490
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:13,830
Caesar! This is how she treats me always!

491
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:18,096
If I am king, why is she allowed
to take everything from me? (Crying)

492
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,898
You are not to be king,
you little crybaby.

493
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,905
You are to be eaten by the Romans.

494
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,134
Come here, my boy, and stand by me.

495
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,949
Take your throne. I don't want it.

496
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,388
Go this instant
and sit down in your place!

497
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,930
Go, Ptolemy.
Always take a throne when it's offered you.

498
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,167
- Now, Pothinus...
- Aren't you going to speak to me?

499
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,932
Be quiet. Open your mouth again
before I give you leave...

500
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,939
and you shall be eaten.

501
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:00,533
I am not afraid.
A queen must not be afraid.

502
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,239
Eat my husband there if you like.
He's afraid.

503
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:06,749
- Your husband? What do you mean?
- That little thing.

504
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:09,886
Husband?

505
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,446
Caesar, you're a stranger here
and do not know our laws.

506
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:18,154
The kings and queens of Egypt may not marry
except with our own royal blood.

507
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:21,288
Ptolemy and Cleopatra
are born king and consort...

508
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,424
just as they're born brother and sister.

509
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,162
Caesar, this is not proper.

510
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,637
- Not proper?
- I say it is a scandal.

511
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:33,802
Scandal or not, my friend,
it opens the gates of peace.

512
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,171
Hear then what I propose.

513
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:39,874
Hear Caesar there!

514
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:43,943
Ptolemy and Cleopatra
shall reign jointly in Egypt.

515
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,023
- (Crowd Gasps]
- (Pothinus] Monstrous!

516
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,891
Peace with honor, Pothinus?

517
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,329
- (Man] What conceit!
- (Pothinus) A Roman trick!

518
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,900
No! We will not have it!

519
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,162
(Crowd Shouting)
No! No!

520
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,738
(Shouting Continues]

521
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,504
Caesar, be honest!

522
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,011
The money you are demanding
is the price of our freedom.

523
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,877
Take it and leave us
to settle our own affairs.

524
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,850
- Yes. Go back to your own country.
- (Crowd Clamoring)

525
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,977
Egypt belongs to us, not to you.

526
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,885
Egypt for the Egyptians!

527
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,753
(Crowd Shouting)
Egypt for the Egyptians!

528
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,689
Egypt for the Egyptians!

529
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,490
(Rufio)
Egypt for the Egyptians?

530
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,394
Do you forget there's a Roman army
of occupation here...

531
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,730
left by Aulus Gabinius when he set up
your toy king for you?

532
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,532
And now under my command.

533
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,437
I am the Roman general here, Caesar.

534
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,842
And also the Egyptian general, eh?

535
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:43,470
That is so, Caesar.

536
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,482
So you can make war on the Egyptians
in the name of Rome...

537
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,712
and on the Romans... on me if necessary...
in the name of Egypt.

538
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,721
That is so, Caesar.

539
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,259
And which side are you on at present,
if I may presume to ask, General?

540
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,726
On the side of the right...
and of the gods.

541
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,594
Mmm. How many men have you?

542
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,963
That will appear when I take the field.

543
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:07,697
Are your men Romans?
If not, it doesn't matter how many there are.

544
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,330
- (Pothinus] Insolence!
- We shall see, my friend.

545
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,604
(Laughs)
It is useless to try to bluff us, Rufio.

546
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:17,943
Caesar has been defeated before,
and he may be defeated again.

547
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,747
- What can you do with 4,000 men?
- (Crowd Laughing)

548
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:26,415
And what can you do without money?
Away with you!

549
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,424
(Crowd Clamoring)

550
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,427
- Go back to your deaths.
- Away with Caesar!

551
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,463
(Crowd)
Away with Caesar!

552
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:37,261
- (Pothinus] Away with you! Out of our country!
- (Crowd Shouting) Away with Caesar!

553
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,464
Caesar, why do you let them
talk to you like that?

554
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:45,974
Are you afraid?

555
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,238
Well, my dear, what they say is quite true.

556
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,610
But if you go away, I shall not be queen.

557
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,445
I shall not go away until you are queen.

558
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,722
(Hisses)

559
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:03,693
- (Women Gasping, Whispering]
- What is she doing?

560
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,130
Achillas, if you are not a fool...

561
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:12,202
you will take that girl
while she is under your hand.

562
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,362
Why not take Caesar as well, Achillas?

563
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,064
Well said, Rufio. Why not?

564
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,835
(Scoffs)
Try it, Achillas. Try it.

565
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,809
- Let us take Caesar and hold him!
- (Crowd Clamoring)

566
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,806
(Clamoring Continues)

567
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,009
(Rufio)
Guards! Guards there!

568
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,019
(Crowd Gasping, Clamoring)

569
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:40,257
(Britannus)
Peace, Egyptians!

570
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,663
You are Caesar's prisoners,
all of you.

571
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,963
Oh, no, no. By no means.

572
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,867
Caesar's guests, gentlemen.

573
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,736
Caesar's guests.

574
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,741
Won't you cut their heads off?

575
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,743
What, cut off your brother's head?

576
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,643
Why not?
He'd cut off mine if he got the chance.

577
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,717
- Wouldn't you, Ptolemy?
- I would.

578
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,786
I will, too, when I grow up.

579
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,056
(Sneers)

580
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:10,253
- Caesar, if you attempt to detain us...
- (Rufiio] He will succeed, Egyptian.

581
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,056
Make up your mind to that.

582
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,997
The road to Rome is open,
and you shall travel it if Caesar chooses.

583
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,592
I could do no less, Pothinus,
to secure the retreat of my own soldiers.

584
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,569
I am accountable for every life among them.

585
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,572
I am the king's guardian.

586
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:26,234
I stand on my right here.
Where is your right?

587
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:29,108
It is in Rufio's scabbard, my friend.

588
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,113
I may not be able
to keep it there much longer.

589
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,740
- (Crowd Muttering)
- And this is Roman justice.

590
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:36,285
Not Roman gratitude, I hope.

591
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:40,949
Is Caesar's life of so little account to him
that he forgets that we have saved it?

592
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,356
My life? Is that all?

593
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:47,522
Your life, your laurels, your future.

594
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,362
I can call a witness to prove that but for us...

595
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:54,837
the Roman army of occupation led by Pompey...
the greatest soldier in the world...

596
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,964
would now have Caesar at its mercy.

597
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:00,271
Ho there, Lucius Septimius!

598
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,211
Come forth and testify before Caesar.

599
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,544
No. No.

600
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,609
Yes, I say.
Let the military tribune bear witness.

601
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,486
(Theodotus]
Lucius Septimius.

602
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,225
Bear witness, Lucius Septimius.

603
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,464
Caesar came to Egypt
in pursuit of his foe.

604
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,506
Did we shelter his foe?

605
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,543
As Pompey's foot
touched the Egyptian shore...

606
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,112
his head fell by the stroke of my sword.

607
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:39,808
We have given you a full
and sweet measure of vengeance.

608
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,852
Vengeance?
If I could stoop to vengeance...

609
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:47,014
what would I not exact from you
as the price of this murdered man's blood?

610
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,358
Was he not my son-in-law, my ancient friend?

611
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,987
Am I Julius Caesar, or am I a wild beast...

612
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,158
that you fiing to me the gray head
of the old soldier, the laureled conqueror...

613
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,793
and then claim my gratitude for it?

614
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,065
Oh, begone. You fill me with horror.

615
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,600
(Septimius, Scoffiirg]
You have seen severed heads before, Caesar.

616
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,646
And severed right hands, too, I think...

617
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:14,047
some thousands of them
after you vanquished the king of the Gauls.

618
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:18,281
Did you spare him with all your clemency?
Was that vengeance?

619
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,789
Would that it had been.

620
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,791
Vengeance, at least, is human.

621
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,692
No, by the gods.

622
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,287
Those severed right hands...

623
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:32,563
and the brave king of the Gauls
basely strangled in a vault beneath the Capitol...

624
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,604
were a wise severity...

625
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:39,005
a necessary protection to the commonwealth,
a duty of statesmanship...

626
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,546
follies and fictions 1 0 times bloodier
than honest vengeance.

627
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,650
What a fool I was then.

628
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:51,917
To think that men's lives should be
at the mercy of such fools.

629
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,366
Lucius Septimius, pardon me.

630
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:14,069
Why should the slayer of the king of the Gauls
rebuke the slayer of Pompey?

631
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,715
You are free to go,
all here in this palace.

632
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:22,013
Free? Achillas's army... renegades and all?

633
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,087
Free, Rufio.

634
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,748
Lucius Septimius,
you're free to go with the rest.

635
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:30,554
Or stay if you will,
and I'll find a place for you in my service.

636
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,993
The odds are against you, Caesar.

637
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,558
I go.

638
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,130
Farewell.

639
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:48,075
Come, Pothinus, Achillas,
whilst there is yet time.

640
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,327
Do you suppose he'd let us go
if he had our heads in his hands?

641
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,261
Caesar, this is not good sense.

642
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:10,822
Your duty to Rome demands that her enemies
should be prevented from doing further mischief.

643
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,735
It's no use talking to him, Britannus.
You may save your breath to cool your porridge.

644
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,399
But mark this, Caesar.
Clemency's very well for you.

645
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,942
But what is it for your soldiers
who have to fight tomorrow...

646
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,171
the men you spared yesterday?

647
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:26,010
You may give what orders you please,
but l, for one, will take no prisoners.

648
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,016
I'll kill my enemies in the field.

649
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,484
Then I shall never have to fight them again.

650
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:34,752
(Sighs) Now, with your leave,
I'll see these gentry off the premises.

651
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,453
What? Have they left the boy alone?

652
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,256
Shame. Shame.

653
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,565
Come, Your Majesty.

654
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,907
Is he... Is he turning me out of my palace?

655
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,536
You're welcome to stay if you wish.

656
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,308
Go, my boy. I'll not harm you.

657
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,349
But you'll be safer
away among your friends.

658
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,146
Here, you're in the lion's mouth.

659
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:06,189
It's not the lion I fear, but the jackal.

660
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,986
- (Rufio Chuckling)
- Brave boy.

661
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:12,824
Little silly! You think that very clever.

662
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,023
Britannus, attend the king.

663
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,225
Give him in charge of that Pothinus fellow.

664
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:26,006
And this piece of goods...
what's to be done with her?

665
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,847
However, I suppose I may leave that to you.

666
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,380
Did you mean me to go with the rest?

667
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,216
You're free to do
just as you please, Cleopatra.

668
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:41,189
Then you don't care
whether I stay or not.

669
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,385
Of course, I'd rather you stayed.

670
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,621
Much, much rather?

671
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:49,497
Much, much rather.

672
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,092
Then I consent to stay...
because I am asked.

673
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,171
But I do not want to, mind.

674
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,148
That is quite understood.

675
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,083
- Totateeta!
- (Giggles)

676
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:12,349
Her name is not Totateeta.
'Tis Ftatateeta.

677
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:16,051
Well, Tafiatafeeta will forgive
the erring tongue of a Roman.

678
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:21,689
Tota, the queen will hold state
here in Alexandria.

679
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,597
Engage women to attend upon her
and do all that is needful.

680
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,136
Am I then the mistress
of the queen's household?

681
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:31,105
No. I am mistress of the queen's household.

682
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:35,702
Go and do as you are told, or I will have you
thrown into the Nile this very afternoon...

683
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,974
to poison the poor crocodiles.

684
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:41,142
Oh, no, no, no.

685
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,742
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

686
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:47,583
You are very sentimental, Caesar.

687
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:50,057
But you are clever.

688
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,060
And if you do as I tell you...

689
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:55,598
you will soon learn how to govern.

690
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,641
(Crowd Cheering)

691
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:14,874
(Man)
Pothinus!

692
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,386
(Crowd)
Hail! Hail, Pothinus!

693
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,481
- Achillas!
- Lucius Septimius!

694
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:24,288
Egypt for the Egyptians!

695
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,990
(Crowd)
Egypt for the Egyptians!

696
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:32,194
Egypt for the Egyptians!

697
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,862
(Crowd Clamoring)

698
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:45,047
(Laughs)

699
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,519
(No Audible Dialogue)

700
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,989
- What?
- Your barley water, Caesar.

701
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,665
Ftatateeta!

702
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,845
Ftatateeta!

703
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:28,016
Get up, child.
You must be bathed this morning.

704
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,679
No. I had my month's bath
the day before yesterday.

705
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,654
In future, you must have a bath every day.

706
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,725
No, no. I should die of it.

707
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,953
You must. Your life is changed.

708
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:42,555
You are still my child, but to all others
you are now a grown woman and a queen.

709
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:45,328
Yes. I am a queen.

710
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:48,268
Ftata, what will Caesar do with me?

711
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,340
Ask rather what you will do with him.

712
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,774
Ah. My child, you have charmed him.
You are safe. You are powerful.

713
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,642
I will guide you until you learn
how to guide yourself.

714
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,215
Fear nothing.

715
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,114
Who could fear Caesar?
He is not great and terrible.

716
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,119
He's only an elderly gentleman.

717
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:07,452
Rather sad-looking and wrinkled,
but very kind.

718
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:13,326
He is a magician, and magicians
can change their shapes as they please.

719
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,330
Everything about him is magical.

720
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,263
He would not sleep in the golden chamber...

721
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:20,564
but made his soldiers bring a bare stretcher
from the camp and put it in his study.

722
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:25,165
Even then, he did not sleep in it,
but sat up working like a slave all night.

723
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:28,938
Yet, everyone obeys him as if he were a god.

724
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,537
I think he is a god in disguise.

725
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,082
For he has changed your nature,
has he not?

726
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,948
Oh, yes, he has. That is true.

727
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,750
Ftatateeta, before he came...

728
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,883
I was afraid of you
more than anyone else on earth.

729
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:47,453
And now...
I'm not afraid of you at all.

730
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:50,795
Tell me. What must I do to begin with
now that I'm really a queen?

731
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:54,166
You must begin by having a bath every day.

732
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,762
- Oh.
- Come, child, and get it over.

733
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,366
- You will soon get used to it and love it.
- Never. It is too dreadful.

734
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:03,674
Oh, well, if I must be washed again so soon,
Ftatateeta, it must be a scented bath.

735
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,045
- Have you scented it?
- No. Caesar hates perfumes.

736
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,119
And if you redden your lips,
he will not kiss you. Come on.

737
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:29,399
He must indeed be a god.

738
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,601
(Sighs)
For only a god could be so unlike a man.

739
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:52,654
- No!
- (Guards Laughing]

740
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:16,779
Cleopatra, I really think
I must eat you after all.

741
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:19,515
You mustn't talk to me now
as if I were a child.

742
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,649
You have been growing up
since the sphinx introduced us that night.

743
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:24,727
You think you know
more than I do already.

744
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:27,160
No. That would be very silly of me.

745
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:31,496
Of course I know that, but...
Are you angry with me?

746
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,331
- No.
- Then why are you so thoughtful?

747
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,433
I have work to do.

748
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,703
Work? What nonsense.

749
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,609
You must remember you are a king now.
I have made you one.

750
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,706
- Kings don't work.
- And who told you that, little kitten, eh?

751
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,308
My father was king of Egypt,
and he never worked.

752
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:52,820
Well, he lost his throne.
And how did he get it back again?

753
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:57,724
I will tell you. A beautiful young man
with strong, round arms...

754
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:02,822
came over the desert with many horsemen
and gave my father back his throne.

755
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:04,833
I was only 1 2 then.

756
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:07,631
Oh, I wish he would come again
now that I am a queen.

757
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,638
I would make him my husband.

758
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,435
It might be managed perhaps...

759
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,510
for it was I who sent that beautiful young man
to help your father.

760
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,977
You know him?
Has he come with you?

761
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,344
Oh, I wish he had.

762
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,349
I wish he had.

763
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:29,922
He is many, many years
younger than you, is he not?

764
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,986
He is somewhat younger.

765
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:35,496
Would he be my husband, do you think,
if I asked him?

766
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,194
- Very likely.
- But I shouldn't like to ask him.

767
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:42,362
Could you... Could you not
persuade him to ask me...

768
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,633
without knowing that I wanted him to?

769
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,209
My poor child.

770
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,471
Why do you say that
as if you were sorry for me?

771
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:53,640
- Does he love anyone else?
- I'm afraid so.

772
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,980
Then I shall not be his first love.

773
00:50:56,086 --> 00:51:00,489
Not quite the first.
He is greatly admired by women.

774
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,616
Oh, I wish I would be the first.

775
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:07,493
But if he loves me,
I will make him kill all the rest.

776
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,088
Tell me. Is he still beautiful?

777
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,829
Do his round, strong arms
shine in the sun like marble?

778
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:17,373
He is in excellent condition
considering how much he eats and drinks.

779
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,442
(Groans)

780
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,773
You mustn't say common,
earthly things about him.

781
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:24,642
I love him. He is a god.

782
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:30,579
- What is his name?
- His name is Mark Antony.

783
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,587
Mark Antony.

784
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,958
Mark Antony.

785
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:40,595
Mark Antony.

786
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:43,689
- What a beautiful name.
- (Chuckles)

787
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,428
Oh, I love you for sending him
to help my father.

788
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:49,004
(Crowd Clamoring]

789
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,841
You must run away for a little,
and send my secretary to me.

790
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,639
Oh, no, no, no. I want to stay
and hear you talk about Mark Antony.

791
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:57,770
But if I don't get to work,
Pothinus and the rest of them...

792
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,941
will cut us off from the harbor,
and then the road to Rome will be blocked.

793
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:04,248
No matter. I don't want you
to go back to Rome.

794
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:06,345
But you want Mark Antony to come from it.

795
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,721
Oh, yes, yes, yes. I forgot.
Go quickly, Caesar.

796
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:14,320
And keep the way over the sea open
for my Mark Antony.

797
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:18,731
(Crowd Clamoring]

798
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,804
(Clamoring Continues)

799
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,315
- What now?
- This, Caesar.

800
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,949
- And two of my comrades killed in the marketplace.
- Why?

801
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,824
There's an army come to Alexandria
calling itself the Roman army.

802
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,262
- The Roman army of occupation.
- Commanded by one Achillas.

803
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,335
- Well?
- The citizens rose against us
when the army entered the gates.

804
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:56,895
- They set upon us. I cut my way out.
- Good. I'm glad to see you alive.

805
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,975
- Rufio, we're besieged.
- What, already?

806
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,339
- Caesar! Caesar!
- Yes, yes. I know.

807
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,503
Comrade, give the word to turn out
on the beach and stand with the boats.

808
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,638
Get your wound attended to.
Britannus, go with him.

809
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,717
Rufio.

810
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:12,147
- We have some ships in the west harbor. Burn them.
- Burn them?

811
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:15,986
Take every boat we have in the east harbor and
seize the Pharos... that island with the lighthouse.

812
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,959
Leave half our men behind to hold the beach
and the quay outside this palace.

813
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:20,962
That's the way home to Rome.

814
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,624
For the rest, Egypt for the Egyptians.

815
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,633
Well, you know best, I suppose.
Is that all?

816
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:27,828
That's all. Those ships burnt yet?

817
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,735
Be easy. I shall waste no time.

818
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,807
Caesar, Pothinus demands speech with you.

819
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,808
- Where is he?
- Waits in the council chamber.

820
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:37,209
In my opinion, he needs a lesson.
His manner is most insolent.

821
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:48,255
- Well, Pothinus?
- I have brought you our ultimatum, Caesar.

822
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,918
Ultimatum? The door was open.

823
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,086
You should have gone out through it
before you declared war.

824
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:56,324
- You're my prisoner now.
- I your prisoner?

825
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,128
Do you know that King Ptolemy...

826
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,931
with an army outnumbering
your little troop by a hundred to one...

827
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:03,028
is in possession of Alexandria?

828
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,107
Well, get out of here if you can.

829
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:08,507
And tell your friends not to kill
any more Romans in the marketplace.

830
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,843
Otherwise my soldiers,
who do not share my celebrated clemency...

831
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,848
will probably kill you.

832
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,010
Pass the word to the guard.
Pothinus is now prisoner.

833
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,554
Britannus, fetch my armor.

834
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:25,988
(Crowd Clamoring Outside]

835
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,428
Caesar! See there.

836
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,333
(Caesar]
What? The ships ablaze already? Impossible.

837
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,341
(Rufiio] It's not my doing.
The Egyptians have saved me the trouble.

838
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,503
- They have captured the west harbor.
- And the east harbor? The lighthouse, Rufio.

839
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,706
Can I embark a legion in five minutes?

840
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:49,546
The first cohort's already on the quay.
If you want faster work, come and do it yourself.

841
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,416
Patience, Rufio. Patience.

842
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,421
Patience. Who's impatient here... you or I?

843
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:56,185
Forgive me, Rufio,
and hurry them as much as you can.

(Man]
Help! Help! Help!

845
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,495
Help! Woe! Alas!

846
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,929
Woe! Alas!

847
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,763
- Help! Woe! Woe!
- What?

848
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:08,337
- Woe! Woe! Woe!
- What?

849
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:10,668
Help. Help. Help.

850
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,799
- Who is slain?
- Slain?

851
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,707
Worse than the death of 1 0,000 men.

852
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,871
Loss irreparable to mankind.

853
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,073
What's happened, man?

854
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,116
The fire has spread from your ships.

855
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:24,015
- The library of Alexandria is in fiames.
- Oh, is that all?

856
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,180
Rufio, is Britannus asleep?
I sent him for my armor an hour ago.

857
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:30,726
- Britannus! Britannicus!
- (Rufiio] Britannus!

858
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,627
Caesar, will you go down to posterity
as a barbarous soldier...

859
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,858
too ignorant to know the value of books?

860
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:39,491
Oh, Theodotus, I'm an author myself.

861
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,704
Good.

862
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,174
What is burning there
is the memory of mankind!

863
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,510
A shameful memory. Let it burn.

864
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:54,708
Would you destroy the past?

865
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,013
Aye, and build the future with its ruins.

866
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:00,614
Hearken to me, Theodotus, teacher of kings.

867
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:03,124
I cannot spare you a man
nor a bucket of water just now...

868
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:05,217
- But you shall pass freely out of the palace.
- Oh!

869
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:08,388
Away with you to Achillas.
Borrow his legions to put out the fire.

870
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:11,433
Caesar, posterity will bless you.

871
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:15,026
Will you stay to talk whilst
the memory of mankind is burning?

872
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:18,403
Sentry! Pass Theodotus out.
Away with you! Away with you!

873
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,874
I must save the library!

874
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:25,111
What's this? You let him go?
More clemency.

875
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,342
I have let him go to save the library.

876
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:31,045
- We must respect literature, Rufio.
- Folly on folly's head.

877
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,122
Besides, every Egyptian we imprison...

878
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:37,353
means imprisoning two good
Roman soldiers to guard him, eh?

879
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:41,658
I might have known there was some fox's trick
behind your fine talking.

00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:44,325
(Laughing)

881
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:45,901
(Rufio)
All ready there?

00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:49,267
- All ready!
- We await for Caesar!

883
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:52,341
Tell them Caesar is coming.
The rogues.

884
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,706
Ho, Caesar's guard there!
Push off.

885
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:58,406
All except the longboat.
Stand by it to embark.

886
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:07,120
I am going to dress you, Caesar.
Sit down.

887
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:09,623
Caesar, this is not proper.

888
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,524
These Roman helmets are so becoming.

889
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:19,368
Oh!
(Laughing)

890
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,369
What are you laughing at?

891
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:23,371
You're bald!

892
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:27,910
- Cleopatra.
- So that's why you wear the wreath... to hide it.

893
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:29,239
Peace, Egyptian.

894
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:31,176
They are the bays of the conqueror.

895
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,148
- Peace, thou... islander.
- (Blusters)

896
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:38,209
You should rub your head
with strong spirits of sugar, Caesar.

897
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:39,515
That will make it grow.

898
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,318
Cleopatra, do you like to be reminded
that you're very young?

899
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:43,892
No.

900
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:47,326
Neither do I like to be reminded
that I'm... middle-aged.

901
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:50,264
Now.

902
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,233
Oh. How nice.

903
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:03,004
You look only about 50 in it.

904
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:05,342
You mustn't speak in that manner to Caesar.

905
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:09,282
Is it true that when Caesar
caught you on that island...

906
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:11,353
you were painted all over blue?

907
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:14,685
Blue is the color worn by all Britons
of good standing.

908
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,691
In war, we stain our bodies blue...

909
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:20,661
so that, though our enemies
may strip us of our clothes and our lives...

910
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:23,254
they cannot strip us
of our respectability.

911
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:24,765
(Giggling]

912
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,302
Oh. Let me hang this on.

913
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,715
Now.

914
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:42,842
You look splendid.

915
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,419
Now, Caesar!

916
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,489
(Sighs)
Have you done talking?

917
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:49,285
The longboat awaits you.
The others race to the lighthouse.

918
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,259
Is this well set today, Britannicus?

919
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,694
At Pharsalia, it was as blunt
as a barrel hoop.

920
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:57,095
It'll split one of the Egyptian's hairs today,
Caesar.

921
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,497
I've set it myself.

922
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:01,900
Oh! You're not really going
into battle to be killed?

923
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,371
No, Cleopatra.
No man goes into battle to be killed.

924
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,500
Oh, but they do get killed.
My sister's husband was killed in battle.

925
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:10,135
You mustn't go.

926
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:13,113
- Let him go.
- (Caesar, Britannus Laughing)

927
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,241
Please. Please don't go.

928
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:17,876
What will happen to me
if you never come back?

929
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:21,388
- Are you afraid?
- No.

930
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:24,517
Come to the balcony
and you shall see us take the Pharos.

931
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:26,424
You must learn to look on battles.

932
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:29,191
Then take me with you.
Let me come with you to the Pharos.

933
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:32,029
No, no, my child.
You must stay here till I return.

934
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:35,436
That is well.

935
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:38,063
- Now, Rufio, march.
- Oh!

936
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:41,166
- You won't be able to go.
- Why? What now?

937
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,904
They're drying up the harbor with buckets.

938
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:44,502
A multitude of soldiers. Over there.

939
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:46,844
They're dipping up the water.

940
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:54,214
This is your accursed clemency, Caesar.
Theodotus has brought them.

941
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:57,816
I meant him to, Rufio.
They've come to put out the fire.

942
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,294
The library will keep them busy
whilst we seize the lighthouse, eh?

943
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:03,297
(Chuckles)
More foxing.

944
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:10,571
Caesar.

945
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:14,769
Cleopatra, if all goes well,
I shall be back this evening.

946
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,817
- (Soldier] All aboard!
- Good-bye!

947
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,355
(Cleopatra)
Good-bye.

948
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,553
(Soldiers]
Hail, Caesar!

949
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,562
Give way there!

950
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:42,833
Good-bye, my Caesar.
Come back safe.

951
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:46,203
Good-bye.

952
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:00,683
(Crowd Chattering)

953
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,168
- (Man) Who goes there, eh?
- (Soldier) Stand!

954
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:17,535
Who are you?

955
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,040
Centurion, I am Apollodorus the Sicilian.

956
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:23,237
My calling is to choose beautiful things
for beautiful queens.

957
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,906
Carpets for the queen's apartments
in the palace.

958
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:29,746
The queen? Oh, yes, yes. Pass him in.

959
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:33,117
Pass all these bazaar people in to the queen
with their goods.

960
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:35,850
But mind you pass no one out
that you have not passed in...

961
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,791
not even the queen herself.

962
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,954
(Laughing)

963
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:43,897
I have brought my caravan
past three sentinels...

964
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,833
all so busy staring at the lighthouse
that not one of them challenged me.

965
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:50,804
- Is this your Roman discipline?
- We're not here to watch the land, but the sea.

966
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,239
Who's this piece of Egyptian crockery?

967
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,572
Apollodorus, rebuke this Roman dog!

968
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:59,136
And bid him bridle his tongue in the presence
of the mistress of the queen's household.

969
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:02,274
This is a great lady
who stands high with Caesar.

970
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,784
Ftatateeta!

971
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,649
What are you dreaming of?

972
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,950
Ftatateeta!

973
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:10,218
No, no! You must not come.
There are men here.

974
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,159
- Oh, that ever I was born!
- Ftatateeta, I've thought of something.

975
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:15,696
- I want a boat at once.
- A boat?

976
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:17,493
No, no. You cannot.

977
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,763
Apollodorus, speak to the queen.

978
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,338
Beautiful queen.

979
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:26,374
I am Apollodorus the Sicilian,
your servant from the bazaar.

980
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,637
I have no time for carpets today.
Get me a boat.

981
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,805
You cannot go on the water
except in the royal barge.

982
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:35,077
Royalty, Ftatateeta, lies not in the barge,
but in the queen.

983
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:39,382
The touch of Your Majesty's foot on
the meanest boat in the harbor will make it royal.

984
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:43,220
Apollodorus, you are my perfect knight,
and I will always buy my carpets through you.

985
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,692
- Can you row?
- My oar shall be Your Majesty's wings.

986
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,263
- Ho there! Boatman.
- Aye.

987
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:50,423
- Whither shall I row, my queen?
- For the lighthouse. Come.

988
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,296
Stand! You cannot pass.

989
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:56,030
How dare you.
Do you know that I am the queen?

990
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:58,767
I have my orders. You cannot pass.

991
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:00,900
Ftatateeta, strangle him.

992
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,500
Keep off there.

993
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,637
Pass on to the palace
and take the queen in with you.

994
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:06,715
And how if I do neither?

995
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,284
- Then I'll drive this pilum through you.
- At your service, my friend.

996
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,784
Help him. Help him.

997
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,151
I shall not need help, my lady.

998
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,123
What shall it be... sword against pilum
or sword against sword?

999
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:19,285
Roman against Sicilian, curse you.
Take that!

1000
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,662
Help! Help!

1001
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:41,480
(Soldier Groans)

1002
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:50,251
(Soldier Groaning)

1003
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:52,853
(Grunts)

1004
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,105
(Ftatateeta)
Thrust your knife into the dog's throat, Apollodorus!

1005
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,334
A curse on you! Let me go!
Ho there, guard! Help! Help!

1006
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:09,741
Stab the little Roman reptile!
Spit him on your sword.

1007
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,837
What is this? Make your report, soldier.

1008
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:14,382
This old woman's dangerous.
She's as strong as three men.

1009
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:16,246
(Ftatateeta]
Centurion, he would have slain the queen.

1010
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,183
(Soldier]
So I would sooner than let her pass.

1011
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:21,313
Cleopatra, I am loath to offend you,
but without Caesar's express orders...

1012
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:23,756
I dare not let you pass
beyond the Roman lines.

1013
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,192
You must withdraw into the palace
and examine your carpets there.

1014
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:29,355
I will not. I am the queen.

1015
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,365
Caesar doesn't speak to me as you do.

1016
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:34,903
Have Caesar's centurions changed manners
with his scullions?

1017
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:37,063
I do my duty.
That is enough for me.

1018
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:42,236
Majesty, when a stupid man is doing something
he is ashamed of, he always declares it his duty.

1019
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:44,643
As for you, Apollodorus,
you may thank the gods...

1020
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:47,648
you are not nailed to the palace door
with a pilum for your meddling.

1021
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:51,515
- Is this woman your wife?
- Jupiter, no!

1022
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,886
Not that the lady's not a very striking figure
in her own way...

1023
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,050
but she is not my wife.

1024
01:04:57,159 --> 01:05:00,424
- Roman, I am Ftatateeta, the mistress of...
- Well, keep your hands off my men, mistress...

1025
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:03,726
or I'll have you pitched into the harbor
though you were as strong as 1 0 men.

1026
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:08,395
We shall see whom Isis loves best...
her servant Ftatateeta or a dog of a Roman.

1027
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:10,404
Two more men to this post here.

1028
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:13,168
See that no one leaves the palace
but this man and his merchandise.

1029
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,471
If he draws his sword again, kill him.

1030
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:29,819
Get about your business.

1031
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,928
(Soldier]
You ought to know better. Off with you.

1032
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:39,001
(Coins Clinking]

1033
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:43,138
(Sighs)

1034
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:46,106
Do not tantalize a poor man.

1035
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:52,245
Pearl of queens, the centurion is still at hand.

1036
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:55,647
The Roman soldiers are incorruptible...
when their officers are looking.

1037
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:57,685
I shall have to carry your word to Caesar.

1038
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,721
Are these carpets very heavy?

1039
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:02,154
It matters not how heavy.
There are plenty of porters.

1040
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:05,386
How do they put them into the boats?
Do they throw them down?

1041
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:08,088
Not into the small boats, Majesty.
It would sink them.

1042
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:10,825
- Not into that man's boat, for instance?
- No, no.

1043
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:12,560
Too small.

1044
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:16,331
But you can take a carpet
to Caesar in it if I send one?

1045
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:17,906
Assuredly.

1046
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:21,340
And you will have it carried gently down the steps
and take great care of it?

1047
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,742
Great, great care?

1048
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:27,413
More than of my own body.

1049
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:30,110
Good. Come, Ftatateeta.

1050
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:32,153
No, Apollodorus. You must not come.

1051
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:34,814
I will choose my carpet myself.
You must wait here.

1052
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:38,622
- Follow this lady. Obey her.
- This way.

1053
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,561
And take your shoes off
before you put your feet on those stairs!

1054
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:48,199
Listen. Were you sent here to watch me
or watch the Egyptians?

1055
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:51,933
- We know our duty.
- Well, then why don't you do it? Look!

1056
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,936
(Apollodorus] The Egyptians are moving.
They're going to recapture the Pharos.

1057
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:58,377
They will attack by land and sea
along the great mole!

1058
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,210
Stir yourselves! The hunt is up!

1059
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,556
(Rufiio]
Centurion, reinforce the platoons on the mole.

1060
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,126
Yes, sir.

1061
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:28,036
Rufio, this has been a mad expedition.
We shall be beaten.

1062
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,438
The Egyptians cannot be such fools...

1063
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:35,847
as not to storm the barricade
and swoop down on us here before it is finished.

1064
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:40,114
It's the first time I've ever run an avoidable risk.

1065
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:45,991
- I shouldn't have come to Egypt.
- An hour ago, you were all for victory.

1066
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:48,029
Yes. I was a fool.

1067
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,428
Rash, Rufio. Boyish.

1068
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,763
Boyish? Not a bit of it.

1069
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,836
Here.

1070
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:57,371
- What are these for?
- To eat.

1071
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,602
That's what's the matter with you.

1072
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:05,146
When a man comes to your age,
he runs down before the midday meal.

1073
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,442
Go on, eat. And drink.

1074
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:10,314
Then take another look at our chances.

1075
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,410
My age?

1076
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,421
Yes, I'm an old man.

1077
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:18,949
Worn out now.
Quite true, Rufio.

1078
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:21,928
Now, Achillas is still in his prime.

1079
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:26,126
Ptolemy is a boy.

1080
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:29,898
Well, every dog has his day.

1081
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:34,242
I've had mine. I cannot complain.

1082
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,507
These dates are not bad, Rufio.

1083
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,877
That's my old Caesar.

1084
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:43,418
It's a great war...
now we've got rid of the women.

1085
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:52,226
You again? Keep your distance.

1086
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:55,764
Come within a yard of me, you old crocodile,
and I'll give you this in your jaw.

1087
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:59,130
Peace, Roman fellow.
You are now single-handed.

1088
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:04,967
Apollodorus, this carpet
is Cleopatra's present to Caesar.

1089
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:09,534
It has rolled up in it 1 0 precious goblets
of the thinnest Iberian crystal...

1090
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,546
and a hundred eggs
of the sacred blue pigeon.

1091
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,741
On your honor,
let not one of them be broken.

1092
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:18,650
On my head be it.
Lay it carefully into the boat.

1093
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:23,657
Those eggs of which the lady speaks
must weigh more than a pound apiece.

1094
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,819
This boat is much too small for such a load.

1095
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:29,363
- Yes! Yes! Me!
- (All Shouting)

1096
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:30,762
Mine's bigger yet!

1097
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:33,733
Oh, thou injurious porter!

1098
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:37,328
Oh, thou unnatural son of a she-camel!

1099
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,839
My boat can carry five men.

1100
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:43,935
Shall it not carry Your Lordship
and a bale of pigeons' eggs?

1101
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:46,640
Oh, thou mangy dromedary!

1102
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:49,809
The gods shall punish thee
for this envious wickedness.

1103
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:53,787
Oh! I cannot quit this bale now to beat thee...

1104
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:57,381
but, another day, I will lie in wait for thee.

1105
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,393
(Grumbles)

1106
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:01,429
(Apollodorus]
Peace there, all of you!

1107
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:05,159
In the name of the gods, Apollodorus,
run no risks with that bale.

1108
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:09,101
Fear not, thou venerable grotesque.
I guess its great worth.

1109
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,537
Into the boat with it gently, my sons,
my children.

1110
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,131
Gently, ye dogs!

1111
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:16,143
So. 'Tis well.

1112
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:19,043
Do not step on it! Do not step on it!

1113
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:22,640
Be not excited, mistress. All is well.

1114
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:25,549
Oh, thou brute beast.
Thou hast given my heart a turn.

1115
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:28,214
- Here.
- (Chuckles)

1116
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:30,292
Ye hungry ones.

1117
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:33,054
- Robber of the poor.
- It's not enough!

1118
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:39,593
Oh! O bounteous prince!

1119
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,602
O lord of the bazaar!

1120
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,604
O favored of the gods!

1121
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:47,506
O father to all porters of the market!

1122
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:51,444
Farewell, Ftatateeta. I shall be
at the lighthouse before the Egyptians.

1123
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:53,447
(Ftatateeta]
The gods speed thee.

1124
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,983
Farewell, valiant pilum pitcher.

1125
01:10:57,019 --> 01:11:00,284
(Apollodorus)
 My heart, my heart 

1126
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:03,688
 Spread out thy wings 

1127
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:06,420
 Spread out thy wings 

1128
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:09,895
 Shake off thy heavy 

1129
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:14,095
 Load of love 

1130
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:22,141
Platoon, follow me!

1131
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:28,448
(Britannus]
Caesar!

1132
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:32,347
Caesar!

1133
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:35,480
Caesar, sir.
Our brave mariners have captured a treasure.

1134
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:37,491
Our enemies are delivered into our hands.

1135
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,891
- In that bag?
- Wait till you hear, Caesar.

1136
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:42,555
This bag contains all the letters
that have passed between our enemies.

1137
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,566
- Well?
- Well, we shall now know who your foes are.

1138
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:48,603
The name of every man who's plotted
against you since you crossed the Rubicon...

1139
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:51,002
may be in these papers, for all we know.

1140
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:53,097
- Put 'em in the fire.
- Put them...

1141
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:57,235
In the fiire. Would you have me waste years
of my life condemning men who'll be my friends...

1142
01:11:57,346 --> 01:12:00,338
when I've proved that my friendship
is worth more than that of my enemies?

1143
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,883
But your honor... the honor of Rome.

1144
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:06,978
I do not make human sacrifices
to my honor as your druids do.

1145
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:09,717
Since you won't burn them,
at least I can drown them!

1146
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,486
(Water Splashes]

1147
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,496
Caesar, this is mere eccentricity.

1148
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:20,329
Are all traitors to be allowed to go free
for the sake of a... paradox?

1149
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:23,405
Caesar, when the islander has finished preaching,
call me again.

1150
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,438
O Caesar, my great master...

1151
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:31,843
if only I could persuade you to regard life seriously,
as men do in my country.

1152
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:35,405
- Do they truly do so, Britannus?
- Have you not been there?
Have you not seen them?

1153
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:38,543
What Briton speaks as you do
in your moments of levity?

1154
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:41,885
What Briton neglects to attend
the services at the sacred grove?

1155
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,925
What Briton wears clothes
of many colors as you do...

1156
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,393
instead of... (Chuckles)
plain blue...

1157
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:49,862
as all solid, well-esteemed men should?

1158
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:53,059
These are moral questions with us.

1159
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:55,500
Well, well, my friend.
Someday I shall settle down...

1160
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:57,697
and wear a blue toga perhaps.

1161
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:02,175
Meanwhile, I must get on as best I can
in my fiippant Roman way.

1162
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:03,938
(Water Splashes]

1163
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,843
What now?

1164
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,547
- Hail!
- What is this? Who are you?

1165
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,986
- How did you come here?
- Calm yourself, my friend.

1166
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,081
I'm not going to eat you.

1167
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:22,292
Hail, great Caesar!
I am Apollodorus the Sicilian, an artist.

1168
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,366
- An artist? A vagabond!
- Peace, man.

1169
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:27,162
Apollodorus is a famous patrician amateur.

1170
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:30,295
I crave the gentleman's pardon.
I understood him to say he was a professional.

1171
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,102
- (Chuckles)
- Welcome, Apollodorus. What is your business?

1172
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:36,302
First, to deliver to you a present
from the queen of queens.

1173
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,903
- Who is that?
- Cleopatra of Egypt.

1174
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:42,472
Apollodorus, this is no time
for playing with presents.

1175
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,849
Pray you, go back to the queen
and tell her that if all goes well...

1176
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:47,854
we shall return to the palace this evening.

1177
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:50,015
Caesar, I cannot return.

1178
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:53,993
As I approached the lighthouse,
some fool threw a great leathern bag into the sea.

1179
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:58,499
It broke the nose of my boat. I had hardlly time to get
to the shore before my poor little cockleshell sank.

1180
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,500
I am sorry, Apollodorus.

1181
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:03,435
The fool shall be rebuked.

1182
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:08,068
Well, well. What have you brought me?
The queen will be hurt if I don't look at it.

1183
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:10,475
Caesar, have we time to waste on this trumpery?

1184
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:14,447
- The queen's only a child.
- Just so. That's why we mustn't disappoint her.

1185
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:18,008
Caesar, it's a Persian carpet... a beauty!

1186
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,452
And in it are... so I'm told...

1187
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:24,253
pigeons' eggs and crystal goblets
and fragile, precious things.

1188
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:27,556
I dare not for my head have it carried up
that narrow ladder from the causeway.

1189
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:30,689
- Swing it up by the crane then!
- The crane?

1190
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:32,767
(Chuckles)
Caesar.

1191
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:36,326
I have sworn to tender this bale of carpet
as I tender my own life.

1192
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:38,998
Then let them swing you up at the same time.

1193
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:42,201
If the chain breaks,
you and the pigeons' eggs will perish together.

1194
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,575
- Is Caesar serious?
- Well, his manner is frivolous.

1195
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,706
It's because he's an Italian.
But he means what he says.

1196
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:51,081
Serious or not, he spake well.
Give me a squad of soldiers to work the crane.

1197
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:53,381
No, no.
It's worked by an elderly Tyrian and his son...

1198
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,457
a well-conducted youth of 1 4.

1199
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:58,549
What? An old man and a boy work that?

1200
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,254
- Twenty men, you mean.
- No, no. Two only, I assure you.

1201
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:05,094
They have counterweights and a machine
with boiling water, which I don't understand.

1202
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,191
So it isn't of British design.
(Clears Throat)

1203
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:10,931
- Leave the crane to me.
Go and await the descent of the chain.
- (Chuckles) Good.

1204
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:18,245
You will see me presently there,
rising like the sun with my treasure.

1205
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:22,677
Are you really going to wait here
for this foolery, Caesar?

1206
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:24,775
- Why not?
- The Egyptians will let you know why not...

1207
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:27,549
if they've got enough sense to make a rush
before our barricade's finished.

1208
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:31,217
And here we are waiting like children
to see a carpet full of pigeons' eggs.

1209
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:33,692
Fear not, my son Rufio.

1210
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:38,357
When the first Egyptian takes his first step
along the mole, the alarm will sound...

1211
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:41,527
and we two will reach the barricade
before the Egyptians.

1212
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:45,937
We two, Rufio...
l, an old man, and you, his biggest boy.

1213
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:48,669
And the old man will get there first.

1214
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:50,870
I wish I had some more of those dates.

1215
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:01,382
Lower away!

1216
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,381
Lower away!

1217
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,601
Easy there!

1218
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:17,905
Further round.

1219
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:21,738
So! Haul up!

1220
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:35,515
Gently. Slowly. Slowly. Mind the eggs.

1221
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:38,024
Slowly. Slowly.

1222
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,570
Haul away!

1223
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:59,073
Stand off, my friends. Let Caesar see.

1224
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:05,986
Nothing but a heap of shawls.
Where are the pigeons' eggs?

1225
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:08,318
Approach, Caesar,
and search for them in the shawls.

1226
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:10,414
(Gasps)
Treachery! Stand back, Caesar.

1227
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:13,255
- I saw the shawls move.
There's something alive in there.
- Ooh! It's a serpent.

1228
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:15,489
Dare Caesar thrust his hand
in where the serpent moves?

1229
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:18,794
- Treacherous dog!
- Peace. Put up your swords.

1230
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:24,895
Apollodorus, your serpent
seems to breathe very regularly.

1231
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:33,210
Why, this is a pretty little snake.

1232
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,875
- (Laughs)
- Let's have the rest of you.

1233
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:38,248
Oh! I am smothered.

1234
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:41,049
Oh, Caesar. A man stood on me in the boat...

1235
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:44,284
and then... then a great sack of something
fell upon me out of the sky...

1236
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:47,885
then the boat sank, and then I was
swung up into the air and bumped down.

1237
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,226
Well, never mind.
Here you are, safe and sound at last.

1238
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:53,165
Aye. And now that she is here,
what are we going to do with her?

1239
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:55,168
(Britannus]
But, Caesar, this is not proper.

1240
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:58,762
She cannot stay here
without the companionship of some matron.

1241
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:03,002
- Shocking!
- Aren't you glad to see me?

1242
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:07,207
Yes, I'm very glad. But Rufio is very angry,
and Britannus is shocked.

1243
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:09,545
You can have their heads cut off,
can't you?

1244
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:12,916
They wouldn't be so useful with their heads cut off
as they are now, my seabird.

1245
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:16,354
We shall have to go away presently
and cut off some of your Egyptians' heads.

1246
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:19,120
How will you like being left here
with the chance of being captured...

1247
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:21,559
by that little brother of yours
if we're beaten, huh?

1248
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:23,722
You mustn't leave me alone, Caesar.

1249
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:25,766
You will not leave me alone, will you?

1250
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:28,301
What? Not when the trumpet sounds
and all our lives...

1251
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:30,769
depend upon Caesar being at the barricade
before the Egyptians, eh?

1252
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:33,568
Let them lose their lives.
They are only soldiers.

1253
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:35,643
Cleopatra...

1254
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:38,679
when that trumpet sounds,
we must take every man his life in his hands...

1255
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:41,010
and throw it in the face of Death.

1256
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:43,141
And of my soldiers who have trusted me...

1257
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:47,312
there's not one whose hand I shall not hold
more sacred than your head.

1258
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:49,481
Apollodorus, take her back to the palace.

1259
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:53,118
Am I a dolphin, Caesar,
to cross the seas with young ladies on my back?

1260
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:56,755
My boat is sunk. Yours are either at the barricade
or have returned to the city.

1261
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:59,026
It doesn't matter.

1262
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:01,034
I will not go back.
(Sobs)

1263
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:03,229
- Nobody cares for me.
- Oh, Cleopatra.

1264
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:05,932
You want me to be killed!
(Sobbing)

1265
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:10,239
My poor child, your life matters little here
to anyone but yourself.

1266
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:13,405
** (Horn Blowing]

1267
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,142
Come, Rufio.

1268
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,309
Caesar, do not leave me!

1269
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,319
Caesar, we are cut off.

1270
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,447
The Egyptians have landed from the western harbor
between us and the barricade.

1271
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:25,458
Rufio, my men at the barricade are lost.
I've murdered them.

1272
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,620
Aye. That's what comes
of fooling with this girl here.

1273
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:45,169
(All Shouting)

1274
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:57,050
Caesar!

1275
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:59,855
- Caesar. The Egyptians.
- I know. We must defend ourselves here.

1276
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,486
But I've thrown the ladder into the sea.
They can't get in without it.

1277
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:05,088
- And we can't get out. Have you thought of that?
- Not get out? Why not?

1278
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,692
- You have ships in the east harbor.
- Our galleys are standing in towards us already.

1279
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,795
And, pray, by what road
are we to walk to the galleys?

1280
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:13,306
The road that leads everywhere...
the diamond path of the sun and the moon.

1281
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:15,069
- How far is the nearest galley?
- Fifty fathom.

1282
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:16,940
No. Nearly a quarter of a mile, Apollodorus.

1283
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:19,809
- Defend yourselves here
until I send a boat from that galley.
- Have you wings perhaps?

1284
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,474
Water wings, soldier!

1285
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,289
Behold!

1286
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,261
Bravo, Apollodorus! Bravo!

1287
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:37,490
ByJupiter! I will do that too. Britannus.

1288
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:40,864
- Are you mad? You shall not.
- Why not? Can I not swim as well as he?

1289
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:43,369
- Can an old fool dive and swim like a young one?
- Old?

1290
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:45,371
Rufio, you forget yourself.

1291
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:48,499
- (Caesar] I'll race you to the galley
for a week's pay, father Rufiio.
- But me! Me!

1292
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,510
What is to become of me?

1293
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:53,012
I'll carry you on my back
to the galley like a dolphin.

1294
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:55,309
Rufio, when you see me rise to the surface,
throw her in.

1295
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:58,284
- No, no, no! I shall be drowned.
- Then in with you after her... both of you!

1296
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:01,321
Caesar, I am a man and a Briton, not a fish.
I must have a boat.

1297
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:03,323
- I can't swim.
- Neither can I.

1298
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:05,325
Stay here, then, Britannus,
until I recapture the lighthouse.

1299
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:08,590
- I'll not forget you. Now, Rufio.
- Have you made up your mind to this folly?

1300
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,257
The Egyptians have made it up for me.
And mind where you jump.

1301
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:14,062
I don't want you in the small of my back
as I come up.

1302
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:16,069
One last word, Caesar.

1303
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:19,140
Do not let yourself be seen
in the more fashionable part of Alexandria...

1304
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:21,209
until you've changed your clothes.

1305
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:22,776
Ho, Apollodorus!

1306
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,176
The white upon the blue above-

1307
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,475
Is purple on the green below!

1308
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:33,817
Let me see. Let me see!
He will be drowned.

1309
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:36,584
Oh! Aaah!

(Shouting)

1313
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:50,998
Hold the fort, Briton.
Caesar will not forget you.

1314
01:21:56,978 --> 01:22:00,607
Hip, hip, hip hooray!

1315
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:03,684
Hip... Hooray!

Ah. Another royal banquet?

1318
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,137
In Caesar's honor.

1319
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,139
These Romans are magicians.

1320
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:28,641
For six months, a mere handful of them
have held the palace...

1321
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:30,643
against the whole of Egypt's armed forces.

1322
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:32,838
And look at their escape from the Pharos.

1323
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,917
Who but a magician
could swim like a dolphin at Caesar's age...

1324
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:37,917
carrying the queen on his back?

1325
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:39,919
That might be the queen's magic.

1326
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:43,855
She rides on Caesar's back on land now
as on the sea!

But take care. Take care.

Do you know why...

I allow you all to chatter impertinently
just as you please...

1338
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:28,528
instead of treating you as Ftatateeta
would treat you if she were queen?

1339
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:31,104
Because you try to imitate Caesar
in everything...

1340
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:34,141
and he lets everyone say
what they please to him.

- (All Giggle)
- No.

But because I asked him one day
why he did so...

1343
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:44,448
and he said, "Let your women talk,
and you will learn something from them."

1344
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:47,112
"What have I to learn from them?"
I said.

"What they are," said he.

1346
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:54,052
And, oh, you should have
seen his eyes as he said it.

You would have curled up,
you shallow things.

- At whom are you laughing?

- At me or at Caesar?
- At Caesar.

1350
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:05,900
If you were not a fool, you would laugh at me.

1351
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:09,238
And if you were not a coward,
you would not be afraid to tell me so.

Heigh-ho.
I wish Caesar were back in Rome.

It will be a bad day for you when he goes.

Oh, if I were not ashamed to let him see
that I am as cruel at heart as my father...

1355
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:24,817
I would make you repent that speech.

1356
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:26,826
Why do you wish him away?

1357
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:32,059
He makes you so terribly prosy and serious
and learned and philosophical.

01:25:45,673 --> 01:25:48,198
Good. You shall teach me.
How long will it take?

1377
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:51,472
Not very long. Only four years.

1378
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:56,710
Your Majesty must first become proficient
in the philosophy of Pythagoras. And then...

1379
01:25:56,818 --> 01:26:00,413
Has she become proficient
in the philosophy of Pythagoras?

1380
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:02,683
(Man]
Oh, she is but a slave.

1381
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:04,883
She learns as a dog learns.

1382
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:09,521
Well, then, I will learn as a dog learns,
for she plays better than you.

1383
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:12,191
You shall give me a lesson
every day for a fortnight.

1384
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:16,066
After that, whenever I strike a false note,
you shall be fiogged.

1385
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:19,834
If I strike so many
that there is no time to fiog you...

1386
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:23,672
you shall be thrown into the Nile
to feed the crocodiles.

1387
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:26,008
Give the girl a gold piece
and send them away.

1388
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:31,782
- (Women Giggling]
- (Stammers) But true art cannot be thus forced.

1389
01:26:31,886 --> 01:26:34,548
What is this?
Answering the queen forsooth. Out with you.

1390
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:36,647
(Women Giggling]

1391
01:26:39,427 --> 01:26:43,761
Well, Pothinus, what is the latest news
from your rebel friends?

1392
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,095
I am no friend of rebellion.

1393
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:50,332
And a prisoner does not receive news.

1394
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:53,999
You are no more a prisoner than I am,
than Caesar is.

1395
01:26:54,108 --> 01:26:57,976
These six months we have been besieged
in the palace by my subjects.

1396
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:01,071
You are allowed to walk on the beach
among the soldiers.

1397
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:04,743
Can I go further myself?
Or can Caesar?

1398
01:27:04,852 --> 01:27:08,618
- You are but a child, Cleopatra...
- (Women Giggle]

1399
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:10,623
and do not understand these matters.

1400
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:13,956
I see you do not know the latest news,
Pothinus.

1401
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:18,328
- What is that?
- That Cleopatra is no longer a child.

1402
01:27:19,767 --> 01:27:25,000
Shall I tell you how to grow much older
and much, much wiser in one day?

1403
01:27:25,106 --> 01:27:27,666
I should prefer to grow wiser
without growing older.

1404
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:31,074
Well, go up to the top of the lighthouse...

1405
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:33,511
and get someone to take you by the hair...

1406
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:35,845
and throw you into the sea!

1407
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:38,783
- (All Laughing]
- She is right, Pothinus.

1408
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:43,482
- You will come to the shore
with much conceit washed out of you.
- (All Laughing]

1409
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:46,082
Begone, all of you.
I will speak with Pothinus alone.

1410
01:27:46,194 --> 01:27:48,287
(Giggling)

1411
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:56,862
- What are you waiting for?
- It is not meet that the queen remain alone.

1412
01:27:56,971 --> 01:27:59,235
Must I sacrifice you to your father's gods,
Ftatateeta...

1413
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,774
to teach you that I am queen of Egypt
and not you?

1414
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:03,776
You are like the rest of them.

1415
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:06,779
You want to be what these Romans call
a... a "new woman."

1416
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:12,376
Now, Pothinus...

1417
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:15,718
why did you bribe Ftatateeta
to bring you hither?

1418
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:19,850
Cleopatra, what they tell me is true.
You are changed.

1419
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:23,453
Do you speak with Caesar every day
for six months, and you will be changed.

1420
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:28,862
It is common talk that you are
infatuated with this old man.

1421
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,871
"Infatuated"? What does that mean?

1422
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,873
"Made foolish," is it not?

1423
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,875
Oh, no. I wish I were.

1424
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:39,378
Wish that you were made foolish?
How so?

1425
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,847
When I was foolish, I did what I liked.

1426
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:44,975
Now that Caesar has made me wise...

1427
01:28:45,086 --> 01:28:47,577
it is no use my liking or disliking.

1428
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:51,056
I do what must be done
and have no time to attend to myself.

1429
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:53,059
This is not happiness...

1430
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:55,493
but it is greatness.

1431
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:58,087
I think if Caesar were gone...

1432
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:00,565
I could govern the Egyptians.

1433
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:03,000
Cleopatra...

1434
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:05,038
this may be the vanity of youth.

1435
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:09,667
No, no. It is not that I am so clever,
but that the others are so stupid.

1436
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:12,337
Truly that is the great secret.

1437
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:15,439
Now, tell me what you came to say.

1438
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:18,883
- I? Nothing.
- Nothing?

1439
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:23,389
At least to beg for my liberty. That is all.

1440
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:25,516
For that, you would have knelt to Caesar.

1441
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:27,890
No, Pothinus.

1442
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:32,932
You came with some plan that depended on
Cleopatra being a little nursery kitten.

1443
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:36,367
Now that Cleopatra is a queen,
your plan is upset.

1444
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:41,932
Is Cleopatra then indeed a queen
and no longer Caesar's prisoner and slave?

1445
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:45,069
Pothinus, we are all Caesar's slaves...

1446
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:48,580
all we in this land of Egypt...
whether we will or no.

1447
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:50,651
And she who is wise enough to know this...

1448
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:53,346
will reign when Caesar departs.

1449
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:55,649
You harp on Caesar's departure.

1450
01:29:55,757 --> 01:29:59,488
- What if I do?
- Does he not love you?

1451
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:03,894
Love me? Pothinus, Caesar loves no one.

1452
01:30:03,998 --> 01:30:07,559
He makes friends with everyone
as he does with dogs and children.

1453
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:10,364
His kindness to me is a wonder.

1454
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:14,805
Neither mother, father nor nurse
have ever taken so much care of me...

1455
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:17,673
or thrown open their thoughts to me so freely.

1456
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:26,411
But how can you be sure that he does not
love you as men love women?

1457
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:28,421
Because I cannot make him jealous.

1458
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:30,423
- I have tried.
- (Chuckles)

1459
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,823
Perhaps I should have asked, then,
do you love him?

1460
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:35,725
Can one love a god?

1461
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:38,697
Besides, I love another Roman.

1462
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,166
No god, but a man.

1463
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:43,294
One who can love and hate.

1464
01:30:43,404 --> 01:30:46,430
And one whom I can hurt
and would hurt me.

1465
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:49,374
Does Caesar know this?

1466
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:52,037
- Yes.
- And he is not angry?

1467
01:30:52,146 --> 01:30:55,547
He promises to send him to Egypt to please me.

1468
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:57,982
I do not understand this man.

1469
01:30:58,085 --> 01:31:00,349
You understand Caesar?

1470
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:02,923
How could you?

1471
01:31:03,024 --> 01:31:05,652
I do, by instinct.

1472
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,320
Your Majesty caused me to be admitted today.

1473
01:31:08,429 --> 01:31:10,659
- What message has the queen for me?
- This.

1474
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:14,166
You think that by making my brother king,
you will rule in Egypt...

1475
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:16,793
because you are his guardian
and he is a little silly.

1476
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:20,863
- The queen is pleased to say so.
- The queen is pleased to say this also:

1477
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:23,739
Caesar will eat up you...
and Achillas and my brother...

1478
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:26,006
as a cat eats up mice.

1479
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:30,413
And he will put on this land of Egypt
as a shepherd puts on his garment.

1480
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:33,453
And when he has done that,
he will return to Rome...

1481
01:31:33,554 --> 01:31:36,182
and leave Cleopatra here as his viceroy.

1482
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:39,817
That he shall never do!
We have a thousand men to his 1 0.

1483
01:31:39,927 --> 01:31:42,657
And we shall drive him
and his beggarly legions into the sea.

1484
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:44,230
You rant like any common fellow.

1485
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:47,130
- Cleopatra...
- Enough, enough! Ftatateeta.

1486
01:31:47,235 --> 01:31:50,568
Caesar has spoiled me
for talking to weak things like you.

1487
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:53,972
I know to whom I must go now.

1488
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:00,775
- Let me go forth from this hateful place.
- What angers you?

1489
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:03,077
The curse of all the gods of Egypt be upon her.

1490
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:07,086
She has sold her country to the Roman
that she may buy it back from him with her kisses.

1491
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:09,782
Fool. Did she not tell you
that she would have Caesar gone?

1492
01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:11,381
You listened?

1493
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:14,689
I took care that some honest woman
should be at hand whilst you were with her.

1494
01:32:14,795 --> 01:32:17,059
Mark this, mistress.
You thought, before Caesar came...

1495
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:20,497
that Egypt should presently be ruled
by you and your crew in the name of Cleopatra.

1496
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:24,503
- I set myself against it.
- Aye! That it might be ruled by you and your crew
in the name of Ptolemy.

1497
01:32:24,605 --> 01:32:27,233
Well, better me, or even you,
than a woman with a Roman heart...

1498
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:29,775
- And that is what Cleopatra is now become.
- (Scoffs)

1499
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:32,539
Whilst I live, she shall never rule.

1500
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:35,081
So guide yourself accordingly.

1501
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:46,660
(No Audible Dialogue)

1502
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:49,796
Wait here.

1503
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:53,890
Here, Your Excellency.

1504
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:03,369
The Roman commander
will await Caesar here.

1505
01:33:04,445 --> 01:33:06,436
Hmm. Ah.

1506
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:11,374
(Sighs)

1507
01:33:11,485 --> 01:33:15,512
That was a climb. (Sighs)
How high have we come?

1508
01:33:15,623 --> 01:33:18,057
We are on the palace roof,
O beloved of Victory.

1509
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:21,356
Good. Then the beloved of Victory
has no more stairs to get up.

1510
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:23,555
Caesar approaches.

1511
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:32,505
Why, Rufio...

1512
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,507
a new baldric.

1513
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:36,577
A new golden pommel to your sword.

1514
01:33:39,981 --> 01:33:42,142
And you've had your hair cut.

1515
01:33:43,184 --> 01:33:45,948
Oh, but not your beard. Impossible.

1516
01:33:46,053 --> 01:33:49,489
(Sniffs)
Perfumed. ByJupiter Olympus.

1517
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:52,286
Well, is it to please myself?

1518
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:56,227
No, Rufio, my son, but to please me.
To celebrate my birthday.

1519
01:33:56,330 --> 01:34:00,960
Your birthday. You always have a birthday
when there's a pretty girl to be fiattered...

1520
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:03,298
or an ambassador to be conciliated.

1521
01:34:03,404 --> 01:34:06,896
- Rufio.
- Well, we had seven of them in 1 0 months last year.

1522
01:34:07,008 --> 01:34:10,375
Alas, Rufio, I shall never break myself
of these petty deceits.

1523
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:12,378
Have you noticed I'm before my time?

1524
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,574
Ah? I thought that meant something.

1525
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:18,447
- What is it?
- Pothinus wants to speak to you.

1526
01:34:18,552 --> 01:34:23,649
I advise you to see him. There's some
plotting going on here among the women.

1527
01:34:23,758 --> 01:34:26,727
Who is Pothi... Oh, yes.

1528
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:28,727
- Has he not escaped?
- No.

1529
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:31,764
Why not? Have I not told you
always to let prisoners escape...

1530
01:34:31,866 --> 01:34:33,925
unless there are special orders
to the contrary?

1531
01:34:34,035 --> 01:34:36,026
Are there not enough
mouths to be fed without his?

1532
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:40,437
Yes. And if you'd have a little sense
and let me cut his throat, you'd save his rations.

1533
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:45,342
Anyway, he won't escape.
He prefers to stay and spy on us.

1534
01:34:45,446 --> 01:34:48,472
- And you want me to see him.
- Oh, I don't want anything.

1535
01:34:48,582 --> 01:34:52,040
I daresay you'll do what you like.
Don't put it on me.

1536
01:34:52,153 --> 01:34:54,121
Well, well.

1537
01:35:01,228 --> 01:35:03,287
Let's have him in.

1538
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:07,065
Ho there, guard!
Release your man and send him up.

1539
01:35:19,313 --> 01:35:22,248
- Who's to dine with us besides Cleopatra?
- Apollodorus the Sicilian.

1540
01:35:22,349 --> 01:35:26,251
- Oh, that popinjay.
- Come. The popinjay is an amusing dog...

1541
01:35:26,353 --> 01:35:30,380
tells a story, sings a song
and saves us the trouble of fiattering the queen.

1542
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:33,289
Well, he can swim a bit and fence a bit.
He might be worse.

1543
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:37,455
- If only he knew how to hold his tongue.
- The gods forbid he should ever learn.

1544
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:39,533
Ah. Pothinus.

1545
01:35:39,633 --> 01:35:43,091
You're welcome.
What's the news this afternoon?

1546
01:35:43,204 --> 01:35:47,834
Caesar, I come to warn you of a danger
and to make you an offer.

1547
01:35:47,942 --> 01:35:51,810
- Never mind the danger. Make the offer.
- Never mind the offer. What's the danger?

1548
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:55,678
Caesar, you think that Cleopatra
is devoted to you.

1549
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:58,980
My friend, I already know what I think.

1550
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:02,146
- Come to your offer.
- I will deal plainly.

1551
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:05,020
I know not by what magic...

1552
01:36:05,126 --> 01:36:08,357
you have been enabled
to defend the palace...

1553
01:36:08,462 --> 01:36:11,829
and a few yards of beach
against a city and an army...

1554
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:15,231
but we know now
that your gods are irresistible...

1555
01:36:15,336 --> 01:36:17,964
and that you are a worker of miracles.

1556
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:21,041
- I no longer threaten you.
- (Laughs) Very handsome of you indeed.

1557
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:23,042
So be it, you are the master.

1558
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:25,840
Yes, yes, my friend. But what then?

1559
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:28,779
Spit it out, man. What have you to say?

1560
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:31,317
I have to say that you have
a traitoress in your camp.

1561
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:33,318
- Cleopatra...
- The queen!

1562
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:35,945
Should have spat it out sooner, you fool.
Now it's too late.

1563
01:36:36,056 --> 01:36:40,925
- What is he doing here?
- Just going to tell me something about you.

1564
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:44,364
You shall hear it.

1565
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:54,040
Proceed, Pothinus.

1566
01:36:55,209 --> 01:36:57,734
- I... Caesar...
- Out with it.

1567
01:36:58,846 --> 01:37:01,747
What I have to say is for your ears,
not for the queen's.

1568
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:05,376
There are means of making you speak.
Take care.

1569
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:07,954
Caesar does not employ those means.

1570
01:37:08,055 --> 01:37:11,582
My dear, when a man has anything
to tell in this world...

1571
01:37:11,692 --> 01:37:16,459
the difficulty is not to make him tell it
but to prevent him from telling it too often.

1572
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:20,364
Let me celebrate my birthday
by setting you free.

1573
01:37:20,467 --> 01:37:22,401
Farewell. We shall not meet again.

1574
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:24,596
Caesar, this mercy is foolish.

1575
01:37:24,705 --> 01:37:26,764
Will you not give me a private audience?

1576
01:37:26,874 --> 01:37:28,774
Your life may depend on it.

1577
01:37:28,876 --> 01:37:31,003
Ho there, guard! Pass the prisoner out.
He's released.

1578
01:37:31,111 --> 01:37:34,308
Now off with you. You've lost your chance.

1579
01:37:36,183 --> 01:37:38,083
I will speak.

1580
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:40,847
You see? Torture wouldn't have
wrung a word from him.

1581
01:37:40,955 --> 01:37:44,789
Caesar, you have taught Cleopatra the arts
by which the Romans govern the world.

1582
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:48,328
Alas, my friend,
they cannot even govern themselves. What then?

1583
01:37:48,429 --> 01:37:50,954
What then?
Are you so besotted with her beauty...

1584
01:37:51,065 --> 01:37:53,898
that you do not see that
she is impatient to reign in Egypt alone...

1585
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:55,935
and that her heart is set on your departure?

1586
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:59,005
- Liar!
- What? Protestations?

1587
01:37:59,106 --> 01:38:00,971
Contradictions?

1588
01:38:01,075 --> 01:38:03,976
No, I do not deign to contradict.

1589
01:38:04,078 --> 01:38:06,774
- Let him talk.
- From her own lips I have heard it.

1590
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:09,543
You are to be her cat's-paw.
You are to tear the crown...

1591
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:11,675
from her brother's head and set it on her own...

1592
01:38:11,785 --> 01:38:13,685
delivering us all into her hand.

1593
01:38:13,787 --> 01:38:17,416
Delivering yourself also.
And then Caesar can return to Rome.

1594
01:38:17,524 --> 01:38:21,654
Or depart through the gate of death,
which is nearer and surer.

1595
01:38:21,762 --> 01:38:24,128
Well, and is not this very natural?

1596
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:27,598
Natural? Then you do not resent treachery?

1597
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:31,660
Resent? O thou foolish Egyptian.
What have I to do with resentment?

1598
01:38:31,772 --> 01:38:34,434
Do I resent the wind when it chills me...

1599
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:36,941
or the night when it makes me
stumble in the darkness?

1600
01:38:37,044 --> 01:38:40,673
To tell me such a story as this
is to tell me that the sun will rise tomorrow.

1601
01:38:40,781 --> 01:38:42,715
But it is false, false! I swear it!

1602
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:47,947
It is true, though you swore it a thousand times
and believed all you swore.

1603
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:57,692
Come, Rufio. Let us see Pothinus past the guard.
I have a word to say to him.

1604
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:01,800
I must give the queen a moment
to recover herself.

1605
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:05,128
Tell your friends, Pothinus, they mustn't think...

1606
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:07,901
I'm opposed to a reasonable settlement
of the country's affairs.

1607
01:39:08,008 --> 01:39:10,636
Ftatateeta. Ftatateeta!

1608
01:39:10,744 --> 01:39:13,144
- Peace, child. Be comforted.
- Can they hear us?

1609
01:39:13,247 --> 01:39:15,181
No, dear heart. No.

1610
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:18,080
If he leaves the palace alive,
never see my face again.

1611
01:39:18,185 --> 01:39:21,552
- He? Pothinus?
- Strike out his life as I strike his name from your lips!

1612
01:39:21,655 --> 01:39:25,751
Dash him down from the wall.
Break him on the stones. Kill, kill, kill him.

1613
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:27,827
The dog shall perish.

1614
01:39:27,928 --> 01:39:31,295
Fail in this, and you go out
from before me forever.

1615
01:39:31,398 --> 01:39:33,366
So be it.

1616
01:39:33,467 --> 01:39:36,368
You shall not see my face
until his eyes are darkened.

1617
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:39,997
Come soon. Soon.

1618
01:39:41,442 --> 01:39:44,275
As the light dies...

1619
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:46,346
he shall die.

1620
01:39:48,782 --> 01:39:51,114
(Laughter]

1621
01:39:51,218 --> 01:39:54,813
So you've come back to me, Caesar.
I thought you were angry.

1622
01:39:54,922 --> 01:39:57,049
Welcome, Apollodorus.

1623
01:39:57,157 --> 01:39:59,887
Cleopatra grows more womanly beautiful
from week to week.

1624
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:02,690
- Truth, Apollodorus?
- Far, far short of the truth.

1625
01:40:02,796 --> 01:40:05,765
Friend Rufio threw a pearl into the sea.
Caesar fished up a diamond.

1626
01:40:05,866 --> 01:40:08,426
Caesar fished up a touch of rheumatism.
Come on. To dinner.

1627
01:40:08,535 --> 01:40:10,435
(Cleopatra)
Yes. To dinner!

1628
01:40:10,537 --> 01:40:13,267
- I've ordered such a dinner for you, Caesar.
- What are we to have?

1629
01:40:13,374 --> 01:40:15,706
- Peacocks' brains.
- Peacocks' brains, Apollodorus.

1630
01:40:15,809 --> 01:40:18,972
- Not for me. I prefer nightingales' tongues.
- Roast boar, Rufio.

1631
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:22,048
- Ah! Good!
- What has become of my leathern cushion?

1632
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:24,083
I've got new ones for you, Caesar.

1633
01:40:24,184 --> 01:40:27,551
These cushions, Caesar, are of Maltese gauze,
stuffed with rose leaves.

1634
01:40:27,654 --> 01:40:31,351
- Rose leaves? Am I a caterpillar?
- Oh, what a shame. My new cushions.

1635
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:33,824
What shall we serve to whet Caesar's appetite?

1636
01:40:33,927 --> 01:40:35,827
- Any oysters?
- Assuredly.

1637
01:40:35,929 --> 01:40:38,363
- British oysters?
- British oysters, of course.

1638
01:40:38,465 --> 01:40:40,729
- Oysters then.
- Sea hedgehogs for me.

1639
01:40:40,834 --> 01:40:42,631
Have we nothing solid to begin with?

1640
01:40:42,736 --> 01:40:45,466
- Fieldfares with asparagus.
- Fattened fowls, Rufio.

1641
01:40:45,572 --> 01:40:48,598
- Have some fattened fowls.
- Aye! That'll do.

1642
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,700
(Cleopatra]
Fieldfares for me.

1643
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:54,770
Caesar will deign to choose his wine?
Sicilian, Tuscan, Macedonian, Chianti-

1644
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:57,476
- (Rufiio] All Greek.
- Try the Sicilian, Caesar.

1645
01:40:57,584 --> 01:40:59,484
Bring me my barley water.

1646
01:40:59,586 --> 01:41:02,350
(Groans)
Bring me my Falernian.

1647
01:41:02,456 --> 01:41:07,223
It's a waste of time giving you dinner, Caesar.
My scullions would not condescend to your diet.

1648
01:41:07,327 --> 01:41:09,261
Well, well. Let's try the Falernian.

1649
01:41:09,363 --> 01:41:13,129
But when I return to Rome,
I shall make laws against these extravagances.

1650
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:16,202
- I will even get the laws carried out.
- Never mind.

1651
01:41:16,303 --> 01:41:18,237
Today you are to be like other people...

1652
01:41:18,338 --> 01:41:21,739
idle, luxurious and kind.

1653
01:41:21,842 --> 01:41:25,209
Well, well.
For once, I will sacrifice my comfort.

1654
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:31,149
There. So now are you satisfied?

1655
01:41:33,387 --> 01:41:37,153
- ** (Woman Vocalizing]
- (Laughter]

1656
01:41:37,257 --> 01:41:40,784
(Cleopatra] And you no longer believe
I long for your departure for Rome?

1657
01:41:40,894 --> 01:41:43,089
I no longer believe anything.

1658
01:41:43,197 --> 01:41:45,461
My brains are asleep.

1659
01:41:49,069 --> 01:41:52,664
Besides, who knows
whether I shall return to Rome?

1660
01:41:52,773 --> 01:41:56,539
- How? Huh? What?
- One year of Rome is like another...

1661
01:41:56,643 --> 01:41:58,543
except that I grow older.

1662
01:41:58,645 --> 01:42:02,172
It's no better here in Egypt.
The old men, when they're tired of life, say...

1663
01:42:02,282 --> 01:42:04,842
"We have seen everything
except the source of the Nile."

1664
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:07,011
Why not see that?

1665
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:09,021
Cleopatra...

1666
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:12,183
will you come with me
and track the fiood to its cradle...

1667
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:14,852
in the heart of the regions of mystery?

1668
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:17,897
Shall I make you a new kingdom
and build you a holy city...

1669
01:42:17,998 --> 01:42:19,932
there in the great unknown?

1670
01:42:20,033 --> 01:42:21,933
Yes, yes. You shall.

1671
01:42:22,035 --> 01:42:26,335
Now he'll conquer Africa with two legions
before I finish the roast boar.

1672
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:29,273
No scoffiirg. This is a noble scheme.

1673
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:32,743
Come. Let's name the holy city
and consecrate it with Sicilian wine.

1674
01:42:32,846 --> 01:42:35,974
Cleopatra shall name it herself.

1675
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:38,142
It shall be called...

1676
01:42:38,252 --> 01:42:40,720
Caesar's Gift to His Beloved.

1677
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:46,555
No, no. Something vaster than that.
Something universal, like the starry firmament.

1678
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:49,925
Why not simply The Cradle of the Nile?

1679
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:53,227
No. The Nile is my ancestor, and he's a god.

1680
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:55,358
Oh, I've just thought of something.

1681
01:42:55,469 --> 01:42:57,767
The Nile shall name it himself.

1682
01:42:57,871 --> 01:43:00,465
Let us call upon him all together.
Send for him.

1683
01:43:03,277 --> 01:43:05,404
- Away with all of you.
- (Stops)

1684
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:37,008
Go. I am a priestess and have power
to take your charge from you.

1685
01:43:38,178 --> 01:43:40,646
What hocus-pocus is this?

1686
01:43:40,747 --> 01:43:42,977
'Tis not hocus-pocus.

1687
01:43:43,083 --> 01:43:47,144
To do it properly,
we should kill something to please him.

1688
01:43:47,254 --> 01:43:50,917
But perhaps he will answer Caesar without that
if we spill some wine to him.

1689
01:43:51,024 --> 01:43:55,484
- Why not call on our hawk-headed friend there?
- Shh! He will hear you and be angry.

1690
01:43:55,596 --> 01:43:58,087
The source of the Nile is not in his district, I expect.

1691
01:43:58,198 --> 01:44:01,827
Now let us call on the Nile all together.

1692
01:44:01,935 --> 01:44:06,872
You must say with me
"Send us thy voice, Father Nile."

1693
01:44:08,208 --> 01:44:11,905
Send us thy voice, Father Nile.

- It is nothing. They are beating some slave.

Nothing?

1701
01:44:32,633 --> 01:44:34,965
No. A thud. Something fell, I think.

1702
01:44:35,068 --> 01:44:37,366
Something with bones in it, huh?

1703
01:44:37,471 --> 01:44:40,167
- Rufio...
- Will you leave me, Caesar?

1704
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:43,766
- Apollodorus, are you going?
- Faith, dearest queen. My appetite is gone.

1705
01:44:43,877 --> 01:44:46,368
Apollodorus, go down to the courtyard.
Find out what has happened.

1706
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:49,176
Your soldiers have killed somebody perhaps.
What does it matter?

1707
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:51,251
This must be seen to.

1708
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:10,061
- Is she drunk?
- Not with wine.

1709
01:45:24,918 --> 01:45:28,547
The queen looks again on the face of her servant.

1710
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:39,225
There's some mischief between those two.

1711
01:45:48,709 --> 01:45:50,768
Cleopatra, what has happened?

1712
01:45:50,877 --> 01:45:53,641
Nothing, dearest Caesar. Nothing.
I am innocent.

1713
01:45:53,747 --> 01:45:56,773
Dearest Caesar, are you angry with me?

1714
01:45:56,883 --> 01:45:58,783
Why do you look at me so?

1715
01:45:58,885 --> 01:46:02,082
I have been here with you all the time.
How could I know what has happened?

1716
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:04,623
- That is true.
- Of course it is true.

1717
01:46:04,725 --> 01:46:06,625
You know it is true, Rufio.

1718
01:46:06,727 --> 01:46:09,958
I shall know presently.

1719
01:46:10,063 --> 01:46:14,090
Caesar, remember,
your bodyguard is within call.

1720
01:46:15,502 --> 01:46:19,632
Why do you allow Rufio to speak to me so?
You should teach him his place.

1721
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:23,767
Teach him to be my enemy and to hide his thoughts
from me as you are now hiding yours.

1722
01:46:23,877 --> 01:46:29,008
Why do you say that, Caesar?
Indeed, indeed, I am not hiding anything.

1723
01:46:29,116 --> 01:46:31,277
You are wrong to treat me like this!

1724
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:36,186
I am only a child, and you turn into stone
because you think someone has been killed.

1725
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:38,257
I can't bear it.

1726

But there. I know you hate tears.

1728
01:46:44,131 --> 01:46:46,292
You shall not be troubled with them.

1729

Only, I am so silly.

1730
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:52,933
I cannot help being hurt when you speak coldly.

1731
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:57,339
Of course you are quite right.
It is dreadful to think of anyone being killed...

1732
01:46:57,444 --> 01:47:00,936
or even hurt, and I hope nothing really serious...

1733

I swear it!

I know that.

and driving us into the sea straightaway.

- We laid hold of this renegade
as we were clearing them out of the courtyard.
- Release him.

1744
01:47:45,525 --> 01:47:48,255
What has offended the citizens, Lucius Septimius?

1745
01:47:48,361 --> 01:47:51,194
What did you expect, Caesar?
Pothinus was a favorite of theirs.

1746
01:47:51,298 --> 01:47:55,598
What has happened to Pothinus? I set him free here
but an hour ago. Did they not pass him out?

1747
01:47:55,702 --> 01:48:01,641
Aye. Through the gallery arch, 60 feet
above ground, with three inches of steel in his ribs.

1748
01:48:01,741 --> 01:48:03,936
He is as dead as Pompey.

1749

We are quits now as to killing,
you and I.

Our prisoner. Our guest. Rufio.

and a friend of yours.

Now the others shall judge of me too.

This Pothinus sought to make me conspire
with him to betray Caesar. I refused.

1761
01:48:45,852 --> 01:48:49,549
And he cursed me and came privily to Caesar
to accuse me ofhis own treachery.

1762
01:48:49,656 --> 01:48:51,886
He insulted me.

1763

Me, the queen, to my face.

1764
01:48:55,662 --> 01:48:59,996
Caesar would not avenge me.
He spoke him fair and set him free.

Was I right to avenge myself?
Speak, Lucius.

I do not gainsay it,
but you'll get little thanks for it from Caesar.

and in fair duel, I should have slain the slanderer.

Hearken to me, Caesar.

1820
01:52:09,589 --> 01:52:13,320
It may be ignoble,
but l, too, mean to live as long as I can.

1821
01:52:13,426 --> 01:52:17,157
- Well, my friend, you are likely to outlive Caesar.
- Does Caesar despair?

1822
01:52:17,263 --> 01:52:21,563
He who has never hoped can never despair.

1823
01:52:21,668 --> 01:52:24,535
Caesar, in good or bad fortune,
looks his fate in the face.

1824
01:52:24,637 --> 01:52:27,697
Look it in the face now,
and it will smile as it always has to Caesar.

1825
01:52:27,807 --> 01:52:30,332
- You presume to encourage me?
- I offer you my services.

1826
01:52:30,443 --> 01:52:33,037
- I will change sides if you will have me.
- What? At this point?

1827
01:52:33,146 --> 01:52:36,809
- At this point.
- Do you suppose Caesar is mad? To trust you?

1828
01:52:36,916 --> 01:52:41,285
I do not ask him to trust me until he is victorious.
I ask for my life and a command in Caesar's army.

1829
01:52:41,387 --> 01:52:44,788
And since Caesar is a fair dealer,
I will pay in advance.

1830
01:52:44,891 --> 01:52:47,792
- Pay? How?
- With a piece of good news for you.

1831
01:52:47,894 --> 01:52:50,055
- What news?
- "What news?"

1832
01:52:50,163 --> 01:52:52,631
What news, did you say, my son Rufio?

1833
01:52:52,732 --> 01:52:56,293
The relief has arrived.
Mithridates of Pergamus is on the march.

1834
01:52:56,402 --> 01:52:58,836
- Is it not so, Lucius Septimius?
- He has taken Pelusium.

1835
01:52:58,938 --> 01:53:01,372
Lucius, you are henceforth my officer.

1836
01:53:01,474 --> 01:53:04,204
Rufio, the Egyptians must have sent
every soldier from the city...

1837
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:06,471
to prevent Mithridates crossing the Nile.

1838
01:53:06,579 --> 01:53:08,945
There is nothing in the streets now but mob. Mob!

1839
01:53:09,048 --> 01:53:13,246
It is so. Mithridates is marching by the great
road to Memphis to cross above the delta.

1840
01:53:13,353 --> 01:53:16,652
- Achillas will fight him there.
- Achillas shall fight Caesar there.

1841
01:53:16,756 --> 01:53:18,724
(Crowd Shouting, Booing]

1842
01:53:22,862 --> 01:53:24,955
See, Rufio.

1843
01:53:25,064 --> 01:53:27,589
- Here is the palace.
- Mm-hmm.

1844
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:30,100
Here is the theater.

1845
01:53:30,203 --> 01:53:32,671
Now, you take 20 men
and pretend to go by this street.

1846
01:53:32,772 --> 01:53:36,037
And whilst they're stoning you,
out will come the cohorts by this and this.

1847
01:53:36,142 --> 01:53:38,542
- My streets are right, are they, Lucius?
- Aye. That's the fig market.

1848
01:53:38,645 --> 01:53:41,637
Yes. I saw on the day we arrived.
Britannus, tell Petronius that within an hour...

1849
01:53:41,748 --> 01:53:43,773
half our forces must take ship
for the western lake.

1850
01:53:43,883 --> 01:53:45,783
And see to my horse and armor.

1851
01:53:45,885 --> 01:53:50,015
With the rest, I shall march round the lake
and up the Nile and catch Achillas in the desert.

1852
01:53:50,123 --> 01:53:52,318
Lucius, give the word to start.

1853
01:53:52,425 --> 01:53:55,986
Apollodorus, lend me your sword
and your right arm for this campaign.

1854
01:53:56,095 --> 01:53:58,996
- Aye. And my heart and life to boot.
- I accept both.

1855
01:53:59,098 --> 01:54:01,498
- Are you ready?
- Ready for art... the art of war!

1856
01:54:01,601 --> 01:54:05,367
- Come! This is something like business.
- Is it not, my only son?

1857
01:54:05,471 --> 01:54:07,837
- You understand about the streets, Rufio.
- I think I do.

1858
01:54:07,941 --> 01:54:09,966
- I'll get through them, at all events.
- (Cleopatra] Caesar.

- Caesar.

Oh, I'm busy now, my child. Busy.

1862

When I return, your affair shall be settled.
Farewell.

Tell your executioner that if Pothinus
had been properly killed... in the throat...

1870
01:54:43,476 --> 01:54:45,535
he wouldn't have called out.

1871
01:54:45,645 --> 01:54:48,239
Now, your man bungled his work.

1872

How do you know it was a man?

1873
01:54:52,585 --> 01:54:56,419
It wasn't you.
No. You were with us when it happened.

1874
01:54:56,522 --> 01:54:59,889
Was it she, with her own hands?

1875
01:54:59,993 --> 01:55:03,121
Whoever it was, let my enemies beware of her.

1876

Look to it, Rufio... you who dare
make the queen of Egypt a fool before Caesar.

Aye. I'm Caesar's shield...

but what use will I be when I'm no longer
on Caesar's arm?

- Where is that British islander of mine?
- Here, Caesar.

And who bade you, pray, thrust yourself
into the battle of the delta...

uttering the barbarous cries of your native land?

1940
02:00:38,798 --> 02:00:42,461
Caesar, I ask you to excuse the language
that escaped me in the heat of the moment.

1941
02:00:42,568 --> 02:00:47,096
And how did you, who cannot swim,
cross the canal with us when we stormed the camp?

1942
02:00:47,206 --> 02:00:50,801
Caesar, I clung to the tail of your horse.

1943
02:00:52,411 --> 02:00:55,812
These aren't the deeds of a slave, Britannus,
but of a free man.

1944
02:00:55,915 --> 02:00:58,281
Caesar, I was born free.

1945
02:00:58,384 --> 02:01:00,352
But they call you Caesar's slave.

1946
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:05,220
Only as Caesar's slave have I found real freedom.

1947
02:01:05,324 --> 02:01:07,292
Well said.

1948
02:01:07,393 --> 02:01:10,385
Ungrateful that I am,
I was about to set you free...

1949
02:01:10,496 --> 02:01:13,465
but now I will not part with you
for a million talents.

That Roman knows how to make men serve him.

1951

Apollodorus, I leave the art of Egypt
in your charge.

1952
02:01:30,783 --> 02:01:33,445
Remember, Rome loves art and will encourage it.

1953
02:01:33,552 --> 02:01:37,318
I understand, Caesar.
Egypt must pay her tribute to Rome in art.

1954
02:01:37,423 --> 02:01:40,915
Mm-hmm.
Now, what else have I to do before I embark?

1955
02:01:41,027 --> 02:01:43,086
There's something I cannot remember.

1956
02:01:43,195 --> 02:01:45,254
I wonder what it can be.

1957
02:01:45,364 --> 02:01:47,298
Well, it must remain undone.

1958
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:49,334
We must not waste this favorable wind.

1959
02:01:49,435 --> 02:01:52,302
Caesar, I'm loath to let you go back to Rome
without your shield.

1960
02:01:52,405 --> 02:01:54,600
- There are too many daggers there.
- It matters not.

1961
02:01:54,707 --> 02:01:57,540
I've always disliked the idea of dying.
I'd rather be killed.

1962
02:01:57,643 --> 02:01:59,668
- Farewell, Rufio.
- Farewell.

1963
02:01:59,779 --> 02:02:01,747
- Farewell, Apollodorus.
- (Man] The queen!

Ah. I knew there was something.

02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:20,594
How could you let me forget her, Rufio?

1966
02:02:26,205 --> 02:02:29,174
Has Cleopatra no part in this leave-taking?

1967
02:02:33,079 --> 02:02:37,379
Had I gone without seeing you,
I should never have forgiven myself.

1968
02:02:37,483 --> 02:02:39,383
Is this mourning for me?

1969
02:02:39,485 --> 02:02:42,886
- No.
- Ah, that was thoughtless of me.

1970
02:02:42,988 --> 02:02:46,651
- It's for your brother.
- No.

1971
02:02:46,759 --> 02:02:48,659
For whom then?

1972
02:02:48,761 --> 02:02:52,197
Ask the Roman governor whom you have left us.

1973
02:02:52,298 --> 02:02:55,096
- Rufio?
- Yes. Rufio.

1974
02:02:59,538 --> 02:03:02,939
He who is to rule in Caesar's name,
in Caesar's way...

1975
02:03:03,042 --> 02:03:05,636
according to Caesar's boasted laws of life.

1976
02:03:06,679 --> 02:03:09,671
He is to rule as he can, Cleopatra.
He has taken the work upon him...

1977
02:03:09,782 --> 02:03:11,773
and will do it in his own way.

1978
02:03:11,884 --> 02:03:16,787
Not in your way then... without punishment,
without revenge, without judgment?

1979
02:03:16,889 --> 02:03:21,019
Ah, that is the right way, the great way,
the only possible way in the end.

1980
02:03:21,127 --> 02:03:23,459
Believe it, Rufio, if you can.

1981
02:03:23,562 --> 02:03:25,462
Why, I believe it, Caesar, but look you.

1982
02:03:25,564 --> 02:03:28,260
Cleopatra had a tigress
that killed men at her bidding.

1983
02:03:28,367 --> 02:03:30,892
I thought she might bid it kill you someday.

1984
02:03:31,003 --> 02:03:33,836
So, without malice, I only cut its throat.

1985
02:03:33,939 --> 02:03:36,032
That's why Cleopatra comes to you in mourning.

1986
02:03:36,142 --> 02:03:38,804
He has shed the blood of my servant Ftatateeta.

1987
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:44,106
Upon your head be it, Caesar, as upon his,
if you hold him free of it.

1988
02:03:44,216 --> 02:03:47,549
On my head be it, then,
for it was well done, Rufio.

1989
02:03:47,653 --> 02:03:50,247
Come. Don't be angry with me.

1990
02:03:50,356 --> 02:03:52,847
- I'm sorry for that poor Totateeta.
- (Chuckling)

1991
02:03:52,958 --> 02:03:54,926
Ah. You're laughing.

1992
02:03:56,061 --> 02:03:59,292
- Does that mean reconciliation?
- No, no, no.

1993
02:03:59,398 --> 02:04:02,367
Only it is so ridiculous to hear you
call her Totateeta.

1994
02:04:02,468 --> 02:04:04,732
As much a child as ever, Cleopatra.

1995
02:04:04,837 --> 02:04:07,101
Haven't I made a woman of you after all?

1996
02:04:07,206 --> 02:04:09,367
Oh, it is you who are a great baby.

1997
02:04:09,475 --> 02:04:12,740
You make me seem silly
because you will not behave seriously.

1998
02:04:12,845 --> 02:04:15,336
But you have treated me badly,
and I do not forgive you.

1999
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:18,417
- Bid me farewell.
- I will not.

2000
02:04:18,517 --> 02:04:21,577
I will send you a beautiful present from Rome.

2001
02:04:21,687 --> 02:04:24,247
Beauty from Rome to Egypt indeed.

2002
02:04:24,356 --> 02:04:26,551
What can Rome give me
that Egypt cannot give me?

2003
02:04:26,659 --> 02:04:29,787
That's true, Caesar.
If the present is to be really beautiful...

2004
02:04:29,895 --> 02:04:31,988
I shall have to buy it for you in Alexandria.

2005
02:04:32,097 --> 02:04:35,294
You're forgetting the treasures
for which Rome is most famous, my friend.

2006
02:04:35,401 --> 02:04:37,335
You cannot buy them in Alexandria.

2007
02:04:37,436 --> 02:04:40,837
- What are they, Caesar?
- Her sons.

2008
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:44,103
Come, Cleopatra.
Forgive me and bid me farewell...

2009
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:47,008
and I will send you a man.

2010
02:04:47,112 --> 02:04:49,046
Not old and ripe for the knife.

2011
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:51,878
Not hiding a bald head
under his conqueror's laurels.

2012
02:04:51,984 --> 02:04:54,384
Not stooped with the weight of the world
on his shoulders...

2013
02:04:54,487 --> 02:04:56,978
but brisk and fresh and strong and young...

2014
02:04:57,089 --> 02:05:00,752
hoping in the morning,
fighting in the day and reveling in the evening.

2015
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:03,351
Will you take such an one in exchange for Caesar?

2016
02:05:03,462 --> 02:05:05,020
His name? His name?

2017
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:09,123
- Shall it be Mark Antony?
- (Squeals)

2018
02:05:09,235 --> 02:05:11,726
(Chuckles)
You're a bad hand at a bargain, mistress...

2019
02:05:11,837 --> 02:05:13,737
if you'll swap Caesar for Antony.

2020
02:05:15,241 --> 02:05:17,175
So now are you satisfied?

2021
02:05:17,276 --> 02:05:21,110
- You will not forget?
- I will not forget.

2022
02:05:21,213 --> 02:05:23,181
Farewell.

2023
02:05:23,282 --> 02:05:26,012
I do not think we shall meet again.

2024
02:05:40,666 --> 02:05:42,566
Hail and farewell!

2025
02:05:42,668 --> 02:05:44,727
Hail, Caesar, and farewell!

2026
02:05:44,837 --> 02:05:49,365
(All)
Hail, Caesar, and farewell!

2027
02:05:53,612 --> 02:05:56,479
- (Sniffies)
- Oh, no tears, dearest queen.

2028
02:05:56,582 --> 02:05:59,380
They stab your servant to the heart.

2029
02:05:59,485 --> 02:06:03,512
- He will return someday.
- I hope not.

2030
02:06:03,622 --> 02:06:05,749
But I can't help crying...

2031
02:06:05,858 --> 02:06:07,792
just the same.

2032
02:06:14,366 --> 02:06:18,860
(Crowd)
Hail, Caesar, and farewell!
