Now forward.

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,007
Now forward.

00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,641
Now forward.

5
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,577
Now forward.

00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,052
Now forward.

00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,654
Left turn all.

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,460
Forward all.

9
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,033
Detail, halt.

10
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,543
Color detail, left face.

11
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,047
Arms at attention!

12
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,722
Battalion!
Ten-hut!

13
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,937
Colors!

14
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,045
Ready. Two.

15
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,296
<i>The Japanese sneak</i>
<i>attack on Pearl Harbor</i>

16
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,838
<i>on the morning</i>
<i>of December 7, 1941</i>

17
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:25,536

<i>that will never be forgotten.</i>

18
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:30,547
2<i>,</i>33<i>7 American servicemen dead.</i>

<i>1,15</i>3 <i>wounded.</i>

20
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:40,885
<i>18</i>3 <i>airplanes destroyed</i>
<i>without leaving the ground.</i>

21
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,996
<i>Sunk or indefinitely</i>
<i>out of action-</i>

22
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,155
<i>three light cruisers,</i>

23
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,233
<i>three destroyers,</i>

24
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,269

00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,271
<i>The California...</i>

26
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,171
<i>The Oklahoma...</i>

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,211
<i>The Maryland...</i>

33
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,953
<i>The new odds-</i>

34
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:23,558
<i>11 Japanese aircraft carriers</i>

<i>10 combat-ready Japanese</i>
<i>battleships to the United States 0.</i>

36
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,610
<i>Superior numbers of</i>
<i>Japanese combat aircraft</i>

37
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:39,616
<i>and enemy-controlled seas</i>

38
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:43,313
<i>to the very approaches</i>
<i>of Australia itself.</i>

39
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,583
Attention on deck.

40
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,588
Request permission
to come aboard.

41
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,090
Permission granted, sir.

42
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,955
My name is Victor Henry.

43
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,943
You look great.

44
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,307
You smell great.

45
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,813
You haven't even looked at me.

46
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,315
You're smelling fried chicken.

47
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,249
It's been five days.

48
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,251
Dad's here.

49
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,653
Ahh. That's nice.

50
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,158
He's in the backyard with Vic.

51
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,659
Oh, come on.

52
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,821
Come on.

53
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,863
Dad!

54
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,200
Dad! Look who's here.

55
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,201
Hey, Warren.

56
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,532
Hey, dad.

57
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,199
I almost visited you
on the Enterprise today.

58
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,136
I'm, uh...

59
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,940
relieving the North Hampton.

60
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,106
The North Hampton?

61
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,410
Why, that's great news.

62
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,313
I can't believe it.

63
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,920
My old man-
skipper of our screen flagship.

64
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,282
Congratulations, dad.

65
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,253
Thank you.

66
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,258
I stopped by
the California shore office.

67
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,693
These just came in.

68
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,471
Okay. Lunch in half an hour, men.

69
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,378
Come on, sprout.

70
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:12,041
Let's clean you up for lunch.

71
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,846
I'll ride down the hill with you later.

72
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,033
<i>My love, I hope this</i>
<i>will somehow reach you.</i>

73
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,761
<i>There's news.</i>

74
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:36,273
<i>The BBC has asked my father</i>
<i>to make a broadcasting tour</i>

75
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,277
<i>clear around this tortured planet,</i>
<i>touching the main military bases.</i>

76
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,941
<i>When he told me about it,</i>
<i>I only heard two words-Pearl Harbor.</i>

77
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:49,214
<i>I know you were supposed</i>
<i>to write to me first,</i>

78
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,617
<i>but for all I know,</i>

79
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,283
<i>your letter or cable will</i>
<i>come next week, and I'll be gone.</i>

80
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,454
<i>If so, I hope It's a love letter-</i>
<i>not a dismissal,</i>

81
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,997
<i>which Is what</i>
<i>I half fear and expect.</i>

82
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,500
<i>You're so utterly devoted</i>
<i>to your wife.</i>

83
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,504
<i>The weather in London</i>
<i>Is unspeakable,</i>

84
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,006
<i>and so Is the war news.</i>

85
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,837
<i>But for me,</i>
<i>to be quite honest,</i>

86
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,503
<i>the only news that counts,</i>
<i>and It's glorious,</i>

87
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:18,708
<i>Is that suddenly there's</i>
<i>a chance to see you again.</i>

88
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:22,287
<i>Now, crossed flingers,</i>
<i>here I come.</i>

89
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,582
<i>Love, Pam.</i>

90
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:37,401
From the Chief Bureau
of Navigation, Captain Victor Henry,

91
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:41,632
detached commanding officer
of the U.S.S. California BB44,

92
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:47,677
to relieve commanding officer
of the U.S.S. North Hampton CA26.

93
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,178
I relieve you, sir.

94
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,680
I stand relieved, sir.

95
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,013
Congratulations.

96
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,177
Commander Grigg,

97
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,188
all ship's standing
orders remain in force.

98
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,622
Dismiss the crew from quarters.

99
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,557
Aye, aye, sir.

100
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,755
Crew dismissed.

101
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,672
Hey, Gene.

102
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,937
My father's ship-
new command.

103
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,723
Right 5 degrees rudder.
All ahead 2/3.

104
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,490
Right, 5 degrees rudder,
aye sir.

105
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,122
All ahead 2/3, aye sir.

106
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,791
Sir, rudder's right, 5 degrees.

107
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,731
Engine's ahead 2/3, sir.

108
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,814
Gentlemen, I want to bomb Japan.

109
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,441
I want to strike them at once.

110
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,554
Anyway, as soon as possible.

111
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,953
I want to be able to tell
Churchill when he arrives

112
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:09,061
that such an air strike
is in the works.

113
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,458
Mr. Secretary of War.

114
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:17,695
Mr. President, such a token raid
at this stage will be very difficult.

115
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,464
And very costly, sir.

116
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,003
Not a token raid.

117
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,573
I said strike.

118
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,199
I want to hook the Japs,
shake them up,

119
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,743
give them something to think about
besides running wild

120
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,372
with victories in the South Pacific
and East Asia,

121
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,451
disrupt that timetable of theirs.

122
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,315
Mr. President,
with our present bombers,

123
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:40,323
our closest air base in the Aleutians
is out of range with Japan.

124
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,824
I've been studying maps.

125
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:45,328
How about striking them
from North China or Siberia?

126
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,831
If these governments will agree,
sure, Mr. President.

127
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,368
The logistics are formidable, sir.

128
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,869
And will take months?

129
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,906
But then we can hit them hard.

130
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,943
How about a carrier strike?

131
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,914
When ordered, Mr. President.

132
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,641
At once?

133
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,447
Zero possibility of surprise,
Mr. President.

134
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,748
Against overwhelming odds.

135
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,348
The Japs know our
carrier strike range...

136
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,517
300 miles.

137
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,526
Their land-based bomber patrols

138
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,530
cover the sea approaches
far beyond that.

139
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,902
Then that sounds like
a suicide mission.

140
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:33,205
No. I want a surprise-
a jolt to the Japs

141
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:37,247
and a psychological lift
to our people and our allies,

142
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,816
but a victory.

143
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:43,581
Those aviators must have
a good fighting chance.

144
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:47,089
A way will be sought
and found, Mr. President.

145
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,193
Fast.

146
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,760
Fast.

147
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:50,759
Splendid, General.

148
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:54,764
Now, gentlemen,
sit yourselves down.

149
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,751
The word from headquarters
for war patrol number one

150
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,353
is that a mess of big transports

151
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,923
have already left the Jap home
islands for the Philippines

152
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,923
escorted by battleships,
carriers, cruisers,

153
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,927
and God knows what else
for an invasion of Luzon.

154
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,429
They'll probably hit the beaches
of Lingayen and Gulf,

155
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:30,023
and from there,
try to march to Manila.

156
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,535
It looks like Christmas
on patrol for the Devilfish

157
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:36,038
and most of the squadron.

158
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,611
Guam and Wake look to be goners,

159
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,646
probably be operational
Jap air bases within a week.

160
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,646
So our line is cut.

161
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:48,651
We'll be patrolling in waters
totally controlled by the enemy.

162
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:52,382
Our mission is to harass
and, if we can,

163
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:56,153
prevent the landing of the main
Japanese expeditionary force.

164
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,162
It goes without saying
enemy destroyers

165
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,563
will be as thick as fleas
on a dog's back.

166
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:03,326
Questions?

167
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,493
Yes, sir.

168
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:08,368
Are we authorized to sink
unarmed merchantmen and tankers?

169
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,874
Okay. Here are our
orders on that point.

170
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,639
On December 8th, this force received
the following fleet order

171
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,873
from Commander in Chief,
Pacific fleet.

172
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,381
<i>'</i>'Execute unrestricted.

173
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:24,046
Repeat. Unrestricted
warfare against Japan.<i>'</i>'

174
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:27,647
The Devilfish will govern
herself accordingly.

175
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:33,060
Anything we sight, we sink...
without warning.

176
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,100
Gentlemen, the Japs attacked
Pearl Harbor without warning

177
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,431
in the middle of peace talks.

178
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,938
We didn't throw away the rules
of civilized warfare.

179
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,542
They did.

180
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:49,114
This isn't the war we trained for,
but it's sure the war we've got.

181
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,682
Any further questions?

182
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,217
Prepare all departments
for war patrol

183
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:59,188
under way for Lingayen Gulf
17 December. That's it.

184
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,495
Byron.

185
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,065
Sir.

186
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,725
Congratulations on your transfer
to Submarine's Atlantic.

187
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:16,205
I got the dispatch from headquarters
just now signed by Admiral Hart.

188
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,707
Sorry to lose you.

189
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,209
When can you detach me, sir?

190
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,679
Well, not till after this patrol.
You're needed.

191
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,552
What's his problem?

192
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:33,681
He disapproved my request,
didn't he?

193
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,554
I changed his mind.

194
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:36,888
Thanks.

195
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,053
Yeah.

196
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,563
You're wrong to go, you know.

197
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,064
Our war's out here.

198
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,568
Lady, my wife and kid may
be caught in Europe.

199
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,070
What can you do about it?

200
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,267
For starters,
I can be 10,000 miles closer.

201
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,860
Just a little while longer, baby.

202
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,830
Oh, there you are.

203
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,839
Are you enjoying the sun, Professor?

204
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,137
What there is of it.

205
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,974
I altered my dress.

206
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,206
Want to try it on?

207
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,349
Thanks. Yes.

208
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:08,681
Any news from the rumor department
about getting away, Mrs. Olofwsky?

209
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,550
Just the usual-nothing definite.

210
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:15,124
We should have been
in Palestine by now.

211
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,251
What are you working on, Professor?

212
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,363
This? Oh, just a diary.

213
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:24,197
Something to pass time
while we wait for us to sail.

214
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,031
I had hoped it was a new book.

215
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,002
It is a new book, Sarah.

216
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,371
Aaron intends to coin this
into publishable copy

217
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,343
on faith, war, the human
predicament, and what not.

218
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,971
Make all the jokes you like.

219
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,879
When a Jew's journey comes up

220
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,485
heading the book of the month
club selection,

221
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,182
something will have been gained
by all this discombobulation.

222
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:49,794
Just keep watching for Louis,
while I go with Sarah.

223
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,000
It's perfect, Sarah.

224
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,005
I really do love it.

225
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,340
I bought it in Paris-Spring 1938.

226
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,878
Seems like ages ago.

227
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,346
I'll have to pay you for it.

228
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,348
Whatever you think it's worth.

229
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,850
[knock on door]

230
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,455
Yes?

231
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,453
Avram.

232
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,454
Mrs. Henry.

233
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,753
I was looking for your uncle.

234
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,557
Oh, he's up on deck.

235
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:26,823
Oh.

236
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,128
New dress.

237
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,136
Oh, it's Sarah's.
I'm buying it from her.

238
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,501
We'll talk later, Natalie.

239
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,134
I should be going.

240
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,687
She needs money for her family.

241
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:56,624
And I started to loathe that
everlasting wool dress of mine.

242
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,627
I mean, truly loathe it.

243
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,631
Good choice.
You look very pretty.

244
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,596
Thank you.

245
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,170
Well, what did you want Aaron for?

246
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,674
In Rome, Mrs. Henry,

247
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:16,611
did the professor know anybody
at the German Embassy?

248
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:18,909
German Embassy?

249
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,179
I don't know. Why?

250
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,719
Werner Beck? Why, yes.

251
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,449
I did know a Werner Beck years ago.

252
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,489
What about him?

253
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,060
I have a message.
He's coming from Rome.

254
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,563
He's bringing your manuscript,
the Arch of Constantine.

255
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,724
How could that be?

256
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:39,564
I left it in my hotel room
when we fled.

257
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:40,967
I never hoped-

258
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,471
Who is he, Aaron?

259
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:46,977
He was a student in my
last graduate seminar at Yale.

260
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,980
One of the good
German students- demon for work.

261
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,482
I've not heard from him since.

262
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,349
What is he doing
with my manuscript?

263
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,355
How has he managed
to track us here?

264
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,126
It seems rather ominous.

265
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:04,027
When he arrives,
if we deny you're here,

266
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,528
the Uberalles will
board to search.

267
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,031
They do anything
the Gestapo wants.

268
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,259
When is he do here?

269
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,892
Very soon now.

270
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,241
You do remember me.

271
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,743
Of course, Werner Beck.

272
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,747
You've put on a bit of weight,
that's all.

273
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,248
Yes. Far too much.

274
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,751
Well,
here's the Arch of Constantine.

275
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,752
I can hardly believe it.

276
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,756
Natalie, do you see?

277
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,795
It seems to be all here.

278
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,830
Oh, Werner, I can't thank you enough.

279
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,228
Thank you.

280
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,234
How did you happen
to come by it?

281
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,739
I found it in your hotel room
at the Excelsior.

282
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:54,244
How did you know we were there,
that we'd come here?

283
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:59,248
The Gestapo has a list of all foreign
nationals staying in Rome hotels.

284
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,614
So Uberalles reported
to the Gestapo

285
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,618
that you'd boarded this vessel.

286
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,848
Then you're in the Gestapo?

287
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,389
No, Mrs. Henry.

288
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,893
I'm a foreign ministry officer.

289
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:14,692
Please, allay your fears.

290
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,700
I took the liberty
of reading the work.

291
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,203
Compared with a Jew's Jesus,
it's a great advance.

292
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,705
It's your finest achievement.

293
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,708
How kind of you to say so, Werner.

294
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,709
Your English has
improved considerably.

295
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,212
Remember the trouble
with your orals?

296
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,213I do.

297
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,715
You saved my career.

298
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,216
Oh, hardly so.

299
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:40,588
[baby cries]

300
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,624
Your child is not well?

301
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,126
He's catching a cold.

302
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,627
Oh, that's too bad.

303
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:49,928
I hoped you and the professor
would have lunch with me

304
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,535
at the Grand Hotel.

305
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,401
They say it has the finest
dining room in Naples.

306
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,905
Leave the ship?

307
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,170
Surely you're not serious, Dr. Beck.

308
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,609
Why not, Mrs. Henry?

309
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:05,114
I thought you'd enjoy
some good food and wine.

310
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,744
In a few days, you'll start on
a long, rigorous journey.

311
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,753
A few days?

312
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,984
That's more than I know,
I've come from the Harbormaster.

313
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,924
Oh, that's my affirmation.

314
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,962
Now, I have police passes
for you both.

315
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:24,467
It's really quite safe for you
to come ashore with me.

316
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,696
There is much to discuss.

317
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:30,672
Werner, what were you doing
in my hotel room?

318
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,175
Professor,
when Mussolini declared war,

319
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:36,747
I thought I'd better
offer you my hand.

320
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,749
Now, suppose I withdraw
so you can talk it over.

321
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,681
I hope to see you at lunch.

322
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:52,928
You're not seriously thinking
of going, are you, Aaron?

323
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,531
I'm certainly not.

324
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,894
What do you think, Rabinovitz?

325
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,629
I don't know.

326
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,535
Well, I've always been
a clumsy old dunderhead,

327
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:06,166
so I may as well follow my nature.

328
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,178
I'll go and take lunch
with Werner Beck.

329
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,872
Enjoy your lunch.

330
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,383
Maybe some of his Gestapo pals will
join you and make things jollier.

331
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,319
Find out all you can
about our departure.

332
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,288
Natalie, if I don't come back,

333
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:24,225
at least you'll be rid of
one of your millstones.

334
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:03,200
Sorry you couldn't join us.
It was a marvelous lunch, Mrs. Henry.

335
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:06,235
Professor, I'll be
hearing from you soon.

336
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,272
I hope the little baby
is feeling better.

337
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,534
Auf Wiedersehen!

338
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,514
Well, my dear,
I'm back, you see-

339
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,015
like a bad penny.

340
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,015
Thank God.

341
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,017
We must speak to Rabinovitz.

342
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,019
Sure you don't want a nap first?

343
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,852
No. I'm not feeling sleepy.

344
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,527
So, was it an interesting lunch,
Professor?

345
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,070
Rather interesting. Yes, it was.

346
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,574
To begin with,
your Turkish captain betrayed you.

347
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,578
He reported our presence here
aboard last week.

348
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:53,741
The Harbormaster decided
to notify the Ovra in Rome

349
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,582
about the examination
of the American fugitives

350
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,092
before letting you go,
hence the machination.

351
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,652
And what about leaving?

352
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,662
Still a few more days, he says.

353
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,460
And he gave me this.

354
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,297
Those are the Italian
police regulations

355
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,566
for the American internees
to be sent to Siena

356
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,504
to await exchange there.

357
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:22,010
As it happens, my home is in Siena.

358
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,844
My staff is still living there.

359
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,396
So...

360
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,397
you've made up your mind.

361
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,831
You're getting off
and going to Siena.

362
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,494
I told Werner it's
entirely up to Natalie.

363
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:50,574
If she wants to sail with you,
I'll sail, too.

364
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:54,405
If she goes back to Siena,
I'll go with her.

365
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,979
I see.

366
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,845
Very nice.

367
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,385
And what did Doctor Beck
say to that?

368
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,284
Well, Werner said
that as a mother,

369
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,654
he was sure that Natalie
would decide wisely.

370
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,023
But he asked me to point
out to you, Natalie,

371
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:15,861
that for us the risks of this voyage
are pointless and intolerable.

372
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,528
This ship is not even seaworthy.

373
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:24,141
The refugees will be entering
Palestine illegally.

374
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,507
The Syrian mountains are full
of bandits and hostile Arabs.

375
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:32,083
Why take such chances
when we are bona fide Americans

376
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,045
with our papers in order?

377
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,712
He's trying to keep you here, why?

378
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:40,553
He's hoping to help his teacher.

379
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,126
Will you ever show
any common sense?

380
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,922
He's a high-placed Nazi.

381
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,496
How can you accept his word?

382
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:47,495
He's not a Nazi.

383
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,293
He's a professional diplomat.

384
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:53,564
He regards the party
as a pack of gross opportunists.

385
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,672
The anti-Jewish policy appalls him.

386
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,866
However, all that
is neither here nor there.

387
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,875
I stand by my word.

388
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,243
Whatever you decide,
I'll support you fully.

394
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:30,833
The Harbormaster
has cleared us to leave.

395
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:35,469
You'll have to decide, Mrs. Henry.

396
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,012
Come with us, Natalie.

397
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:41,676
You'll be safe and free-
you and your baby.

or maximum elimination
of the nation's enemies?

I'm a soldier, Herr Gruppenfuhrer.

But why do you suppose
you were chosen?

441
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:13,088
The Reichsfuhrer knows you
can accomplish the impossible.

442
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,215
He'll see you're richly rewarded.

eventually millions.

453
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,834
It's the Fuhrer's will.

454
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,842
Will the new material
work on such numbers?

455
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,343
I believe it will.

456
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:11,846
We have already tested it
on smaller numbers.

457

Besides, what is
the alternative?

458
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,486
The carbon monoxide
used at Treblinka was preposterous.

459
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,989
I could have told them that.

460
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,490
Messy, wasteful of fuel.

461
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,790
And shooting on such a scale...

00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,899
the psychological effect
on the execution squads

463

would be unendurable.

464
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:35,065
Besides, the Reich
has better uses for the ammunition.

00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,922
Long johns?
Shades of President McKinley.

484
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,925
So how was your trip?

485
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,427
Fine. It was wonderful.

486
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:10,933
What is this awful
hush-hush thing you're working on?

487
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,935
Oh, good Lord, Palmer,
you're getting as bad as Pug.

488
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,505
Can't you tell me anything?

489
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,233
If we get it first,
we win the war.

490
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,812
If Hitler gets it first,
he wins the world.

491
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:25,438
Who'll get it first?

492
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,949
As of now, Hitler-hands down.

493
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,019
Look at this, Rhoda. Christmas.

494
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:31,951
It's got the country half-paralyzed.

495
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,489
Does anyone remember
there's a war on?

496
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,432
Rhoda.

497
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,433
Oh, Palmer.

498
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,401
Oh, Palmer, dear.

499
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,443
Oh, I'm-I'm afraid

500
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,945
I have some bad news, darling.

501
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,947
Madeline's here.

502
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,949
Madeline? Since when?

503
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,954
She dropped in on me
from New York this afternoon.

504
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,421
How long is she staying?

505
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,092
Just for the holidays.

506
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,891
Oh.

507
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,478
Hi, Madeline and Simie.

508
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,748
I'll fix us a drink.

509
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,688
Well, Madeline,
how nice to see you again.

510
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,589
Simon, this is Dr. Palmer Kirby.

511
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:18,786
He's a good friend of dad's.

512
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,658
Lieutenant Anderson.

513
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,662
Just back from the sea?

514
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,131
No, I'm at Buord
proving grounds.

515
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,428
New weapons section.

516
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:28,060
Working on anything exciting?

517
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,604
Nothing I can talk about.

518
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,470
You were scaring me
about radioactive bombs

519
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,100
blowing up the world.

520
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:37,112
Pure theory, Mad.
Not for this war.

521
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:41,548
We'll see you later, mom.

522
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,881
Aren't you two
going to eat here?

523
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:47,252
Uh-uh. We'll grab a bite
before the movies.

524
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,289
Well, have a nice evening.

525
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,393
Bye-bye.

526
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,824
Bye. It's very cold out there.

527
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,155
Good night.

528
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:17,818
Black. Right?

529
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,320
Yes, that's right.

530
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,651
Oh, Rhoda.

531
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:23,316
You certainly know
how to spoil a man.

532
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,088
Why, thank you, Palmer.

533
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,870
Palmer, I have something to tell you.

534
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:42,571
I wrote Pug about a month ago
and asked for a divorce.

535
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,580
Now, darling, listen,
you're free as air.

536
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:49,083
I'm not sure I ever
want to marry again.

537
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,383
l...

538
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,390
I'm-I'm in such
a terrible turmoil.

539
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,894
When he got to California,

540
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:06,196
I thought he might ask me to come
and set up house in Honolulu.

541
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,498
I simply couldn't face
leaving you, so I did it.

542
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,039
And now it's done.

543
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,138
What reason did you
give him, Rhoda?

544
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:20,910
I simply told him
we had been seeing each other,

545
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:24,384
and I'd fallen hopelessly in love.
It was wrong not to tell him.

546
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,025
Has he answered you yet?

547
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,461
Yes.

548
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,364
A lovely, heartbreaking letter.

549
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,164
Let me see it.

550
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,402
Are you sure that's what you want?

551
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,136
Please. I want to see it, Rhoda.

552
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,410
What's the matter, dear?

553
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,217
Nothing.

554
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,225
I still have a report
to write tonight.

555
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,896
It is awkward, isn't it?

556
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,900
I mean, Madeline
being here and all.

557
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,763
Palmer.

558
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,702
Palmer, uh...

559
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,477
Palmer, take me
to your apartment.

560
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,754
Is that what you really want?

561
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:45,555
Oh...oh, what do you think, you fool?

562
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,489
Don't you?

563
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:55,136
<i>Dearest Pug,</i>

564

<i>and go on as before.</i>

565
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,039
<i>It's almost too generous to accept,</i>

566
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:04,443
<i>and we both ought to take time</i>
<i>to think about it.</i>

567
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,345
<i>That you would be willing</i>

568
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:11,853
<i>Is almost inconceivable to anyone</i>

569
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:16,392
<i>Believe me, I have never respected</i>

574
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,905

576

577

578
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:58,159
<i>All my love always, Rho.</i>

579
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,399
Can't you get anything right?

580
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:33,901
I never said that.

581
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,403
Oh, perhaps I did.

582
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,063
[laughs]

583
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:40,301
This is going to be
worst than Ceylon.

584
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:43,902
We're going down
into a bloody inferno.

585
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:47,448
Looks like a peaceful
little inferno to me.

586
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:51,452
Where are the <i>'</i>'vast fortress walls,
the masses of cannons,

587
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,022
the swarms of spitfires

588
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,954
That doesn't show, naturally.

589
00:44:56,093 --> 00:45:00,553
Believe me, this little green scorpion
of an island down there

590
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,996
packs a hell of a sting.

591
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,498
<i>Prepare to land.</i>

592
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:07,832
<i>Please prepare</i>
<i>for landing at Singapore.</i>

593
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:11,429
I look as if I've
been digging a ditch.

594
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:16,671
So, Philip Rule is meeting us.

595
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,180
Oh, the swine cabled me in Ceylon.

596
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:24,218
Damn able correspondent, Philip.

597
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:28,222
Talky, I finished
with him long ago.

598
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:39,901
<i>Qantas flight</i> 23
<i>Arriving at gate number 5.</i>

599
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,561
Hello, Tudsburys.

600
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,070
Philip, just in time.

601
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:44,572
How are you, Tudsbury?

602
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,609
Welcome to the
bastion of the empire.

603
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,871
I'm overwhelmed.

604
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:51,571
Well, don't be.
They grow by the roadside.

605
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,774
Mr. Alistair Tudsbury?

606
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,282
Air Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham

607
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:58,183
invites you for a tour
of the island's defenses.

608
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,586
Oh, I accept.

609
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:04,785
My car will be waiting
for you outside customs.

610
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,828
You do rate
with the high brass, Talky.

611
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:10,456
Imagine a journalist
receiving that offer.

612
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,068
What happened to your hand?

613
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:15,729
I went on maneuvers with the Argyll
and Sutherland highlanders.

614
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,101
Got bitten...by a centipede.

615
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,232
It was a nasty brute,
about a foot long.

616
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,377
Didn't know whether to kiss it
or kill it.

617
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,878
Still playing your
Hemingway act, eh?

618
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:25,379
Nasty, nasty. Come along.

619
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,381
I'll whisk you
through formalities,

620
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,917
then I'll book you into raffles.

621
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:32,920
What are you sending
to the express?

622
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:36,423
My sources say our lads
are smashing the Japs.

623
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,425
That's the official line, Talky.

624
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:43,397
The rumors filtering down
the Peninsula aren't quite so rosy.

625
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:48,402
Looks peaceful.

626
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,404
This is the residential section.

627
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,408
We are east of Suez.

628
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,637
Where are the British, Phil?

629
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:58,646
You'll meet them tonight
at the Tanglin Club,

630
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,046
Governor's reception for whites only.

631
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:02,948
Governor's reception?

632
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,489
For the celebrated Alistair Tudsbury.

633
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:11,993
You'll get a chance to meet
all the calcified Pukka Sahibs

634
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:15,496
responsible for sweating and
oppressing half a billion Asiatics

635
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:19,830
in the name of God
and the British empire.

636
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:24,737
So, Tudsy, tell me about this U.S.
naval captain Victor Henry.

637
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,672
Who's that?

638
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,368
Oh, come, come.

639
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,379
People talk,
especially the Moscow press corps.

640
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,381
You and this yank lovers?

641
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,885
None of your bloody business.

642
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:42,390
As long as we're on the subject,
how's the little wife?

643
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,857
God knows.

644
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,895
Last I heard, she was working
in a factory outside Moscow

645
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:51,524
making tank turrets
out of borscht or something.

646
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:55,536
The idea of you married,
and to a Russian ballerina.

647
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:58,038
You always were full of surprises.

648
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,905
It was the only way
into her knickers.

649
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,409
Beautiful girl, Tudsbury,

650
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:06,107
but prim as an Anglican
Bishop's wife.

651
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:11,152
A Yank, Tudsy,
and, I hear, over 50.

652
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:14,451
You must tell me.
What's the appeal?

653
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,990
Among other qualities, Phil,

654
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:19,994
he's as little like you
as anyone could possibly imagine.

655
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,995
He's decent to the bone.

656
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:25,966
Ah, the charm of novelty.

657
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,075
This war will be won.

658
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:44,017
Though it may well entail further
grizzly sacrifices for mankind.

659
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:46,451
But after what I have seen today,

660
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,581
thanks to the generous cooperation

661
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:52,627
of Air Chief Marshall,
Brooke Poppum,

662
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,856
this is what I'm going to say tonight

663
00:48:54,998 --> 00:49:00,698
when I broadcast to England,
the empire and the world.

664
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:04,796
Fortress Singapore is ready.

665
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:10,278
[applause]

666
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:13,850
Fortress Singapore doesn't
expect a tea party

667
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:18,421
but it is well prepared
for its uninvited guests.

668
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:24,083
Let the rest of the world be assured
the Japanese will not enjoy,

669
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,661
if they ever
get near enough to taste it,

670
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:31,097
the bitter brew that awaits
them at Fortress Singapore.

671
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:38,436
[applause]

672
00:49:38,575 --> 00:50:24,746
[singing]

673
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,966
Morning sir.

674
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:48,168
Good morning Byron.

675
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,279
Good morning Skipper.

676
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:51,972
Good morning Byron.

677
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,951
How much longer till Lingayen?

678
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,555
I'm taking her down Lady.

679
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:00,713
Pull the plug
as soon as we are below.

680
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,188
Aye, aye sir.

681
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:06,193
Clear the bridge.

682
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,661
Let's move it.

683
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,027
Let's get going.

684
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,862
Get going.

685
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,785
Green board.

686
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,219
Bleed air.

687
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,285
Pure air.

688
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,025
Green board,
pressure in the boat.

689
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,363
Very well take it up
one, two, five feet.

690
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:50,234
Let me know
when you get it.

691
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:52,136
One, two five.

692
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,902
One, two, five aye.

693
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:01,179
I relieve you Briny.

694
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,114
I stand relieved sir.

695
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,049
I want you to go forward and check
the new torpedo explosives.

696
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:05,381
Aye, aye.

697
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:08,185
Full negative to the mark.

698
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,020
Bridge circuit is secure sir.

699
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:13,060
Very well give me
a nine-degree down bubble.

700
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:14,595
Now line it up.

701
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,160
Hey guys.

702
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,565
Hello sir.

703
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,070
How we doing Hans?

704
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,176
We had to load all six bow tubes
with of warheads Mr. Henry.

705
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,572
Allfish routine.

706
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:29,872
Floaters are ready
for insertion.

707
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,378
Well let's get at it.

708
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,133
Tracking party
to the conning tower Mr. Henry.

709
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:02,404
What's going on?

710
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:03,808
The captain wants you
to take the dive

711
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,643
so that Mr. Turkell
can man the TDC.

712
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:07,807
We're in silent running.

713
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,009
We have a contact?

714
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,176
Your damn right.

715
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,117
There's crew noises
all over this ocean.

716
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,289
We're inside Lingayen.

717
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:34,976
Lady, when did all this break.

718
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:38,603
We picked up these clowns on sonar
at about nine thousand yards

719
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:41,717
all of a sudden we must have come
out from underneath a thermal layer.

720
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,045
I want you to take the dive.

721
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:44,710
I'm going to go back up
to the conning tower.

722
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:46,219
Very well,
I'll relieve you sir.

723
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:47,380
And I stand relieved.

724
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:48,786
We are at one,
twenty-five running silent.

725
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:52,884
I only had one-third and for once
Foof left you with a good trim.

726
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,826
Sure sounds like
a mess of them.

727
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:58,457
Yeah like the whole
damn Jap landing force.

728
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,386
Now Briny listen carefully.

729
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,354
I'm going to raise number one
periscope all the way.

730
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:27,157
I want you to come to exactly
sixty-six feet and level off.

731
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:30,458
And then another foot and level off

732
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:34,229
just the way we did on that
last practice run on the Litchfield.

733
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,497
Nice and easy, you know?

734
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,800
Aye aye sir.

735
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:38,839
Take it up sixty-six feet.

736
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,341
Zero bubble.

737
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:52,886
Six-six feet sir.

738
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:53,990
Very well.

739
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,615
Up scope.

740
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,655
Make it up six-five feet.

741
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:08,304
Six-five feet sir.

742
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,267
Very well.

743
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,271
That's it hold it.

744
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,736
Wow unbelievable.

745
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:18,848
Mark?

746
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,711
0 4 5.

747
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,249
Leaving AP. Mark?

748
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,148
0 4 6 1/2.

749
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,584
Second A.P. Mark?

750
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,314
0 4 4.

751
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:28,788
Third A.P. Mark?

752
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:29,857
Down scope.

753
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,426
0 4 2 1/2.

754
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:32,550
Target angle on the bow.

755
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:35,096
Forty starboard -
range about ten thousand yards.

756
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,198
C.B.C.

757
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,527
Will track the first transport.

758
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:41,467
Give me the normal approach course,
all ahead standard.

759
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,606
This is the captain.

760
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:47,902
We've got three big
transports in column,

761
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:51,639
screened by three destroyers,
off our starboard bow.

762
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:55,342
The rising sun is flapping
plain as day on all of them.

763
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:56,975
This is it.

764
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,714
Flood the bow tubes.

765
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:04,691
All tubes flooded sir.

766
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:06,227
Very well.

767
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,126
They're still beyond
torpedo range, Captain.

768
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:09,458
They are now
but they're zig-zagging

769
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,500
and when they zig back
they will be in range.

770
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,159
All ahead 1/3.

771
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,397
Answering all ahead 1/3.

772
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,343
Up scope.

773
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:39,961
Okay, here they come.

774
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:42,189
They are zigging back.

775
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,492
Get ready to shoot.

776
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,100
They're still
in outside range, Captain.

777
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,203
I'll use slow setting Zen?

778
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:48,304
I'm going to shoot.

779
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:51,532
Open outer doors.

780
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,699
Lead transport bearing.

781
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:54,605
Mark?

782
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,371
3 5 0.

783
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,310
Range. Mark?

784
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:00,143
4500.

785
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:01,215
Down scope.

786
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:04,343
Angle on the bow
seventy starboard.

787
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:07,581
Now all hands I intend to shoot four bow tubes

788
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:11,490
at those three big
overlapping transports.

789
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:13,926
Set depth thirty feet all tubes.

790
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:15,189
Acknowledge sir.

791
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:15,990
Very well.

792
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:16,996
Up scope.

793
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,339
Target bearing.

794
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:25,166
Mark?

795
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:26,673
3 5 2.

796
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,675
Range. Mark?

797
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:29,938
3500.

798
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,410
Down scope.

799
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:33,413
Angle on the bow
ninety starboard.

800
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,417
Solution light,
shoot anytime Captain.

801
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,349
Fire one.

802
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:42,958
One fired electrically.

803
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:46,619
Number one fired
electrically sir.

804
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:50,529
Fire two.

805
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:55,036
Number two fired
electrically sir.

806
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,332
Fire three.

807
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:01,705
Number three fired
electrically sir.

808
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,938
Fire four.

809
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,641
Number four fired
electrically sir.

810
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:09,411
All fish are running
toward target sir.

811
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:11,383
Very well.

812
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:12,385
Up scope.

813
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:24,192
All wakes running hot,
straight and normal.

814
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,699
Beautiful.

815
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,360
Down scope.

816
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:33,671
Nineteen seconds
till impact Captain.

817
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:44,478
Fifteen, fourteen...

818
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,613
No, it has to be.

819
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,359
Ah, up scope.

820
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:05,466
Scope's been up
fourteen seconds.

821
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:08,577
Down scope.

822
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,144
Four misses.

823
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,771
Lady, four.

824
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:16,612
These two wakes had to go
right under the lead transport.

825
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:19,551
In spite of the wakes that near
destroyer is coming right at us

826
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,088
with a hell of a bone in its teeth.

827
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,122
All ahead full.

828
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:23,486
Answering all ahead full sir.

829
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,890
Bradley emergency give me
two hundred and fifty feet.

830
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:27,860
What's he talking
about Mr. Henry?

831
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:29,862
Lingayen is no deeper
than hundred seventy.

832
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:33,696
We're going to hit bottom
like a ton of bricks.

833
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:36,805
All hands rig for depth
charge on the double.

834
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:54,345
On that dive order, Captain I think
you mean a hundred and fifty feet.

835
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,583
That's about down to the mud here.

836
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:58,921
Oh right. Thanks Lady.

837
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:02,554
Byron make that
one hundred fifty feet.

838
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:04,633
One five zero aye sir.

839
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,758
Passing one hundred feet.

840
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,371
Take it up one five zero feet.

841
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:16,504
Below negative to four thousand.

842
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:27,349
One five zero sir.

843
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,525
Well, what course Captain?

844
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:36,291
Course? Oh yeah... huh?

845
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:44,168
Left full rudder come to, ah...
make it two, seven, zero.

846
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,867
Left to two, seven, zero sir.

847
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:34,422
Depth charge.

848
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:08,785
Hold on.

849
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:25,431
Foof hit it with a torch.

850
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:50,664
Captain, we got our depth crank in.
We're getting creamed.

851
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:55,260
Let's take her up to fifty-five feet
and give them a knuckle.

852
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:58,305
Take her up
to fifty-five feet.

853
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,204
Fifty-five feet aye sir.

854
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,538
Give me a ten up, no more.

855
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:03,542
Four degree down
till we past six, zero feet.

856
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:31,605
Floor auxiliaries from cease,
eight hundred pounds.

857
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:34,972
Leveled off at five,
five feet sir.

858
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,942
Very well.

859
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:40,014
Everything okay down there?

860
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,016
Seems to be sir.

861
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:57,028
Now all hands we've seemed
to have give them the slip for now.

862
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,259
Congratulations on bringing
the Devilfish

863
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:01,700
through her first enemy attack.

864
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,296
Make depth sixty-five feet.

865
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:09,605
Lady, Foof,
let's look at the chart.

866
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:13,573
Lady what do you think?

867
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,844
Well I'd say he's
heading for the beach.

868
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,079
Yeah why's that?

869
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,487
Because he probably knows
that we're still trying

870
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:25,093
for the landing area.

871
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:27,889
Well if you're right
that's just great.

872
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,863
Because we're heading
for the entrance.

873
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,864
The entrance?

874
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,868
Of course.

875
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:39,100
The whole landing area will be
on full submarine alert now.

876
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:41,472
We can't accomplish anything here

877
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:47,379
but up at the entrance
we might find some fat pickings.

878
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:50,974
All right,
Foof you relieve Briny.

879
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:53,986
Lady you and Briny
take a look around the boat.

880
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:56,990
Let me have a full damage report
as quickly as possible.

881
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:01,262
Lady?

882
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:02,692
Aye, aye sir.

883
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:15,509
No, no you tell me why he's not
going after those transports.

884
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:17,237
Take it easy Briny.

885
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,278
He knows what's he doing.

886
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:19,142
He does?

887
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:21,045
Yes, you heard him say
that our torpedo attack

888
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,980
put the landing force
on full sub alert.

889
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,644
The landing force has to be on
full sub alert anyway you know that.

890
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:28,688
We're still loaded
with twenty fish and he's running.

891
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:30,451
What the hell
are we out here for?

892
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:47,471
He's zigging again.

893
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,874
Range is sixty-five hundred.

894
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:51,673
Ready to relieve.

895
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:54,146
He's back with us.

896
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,649
Were at eight, zero feet
and 1/3 speed.

897
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:57,946
Very well I relieve you sir.

898
01:05:58,087 --> 01:05:59,315
I stand relieved.

899
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,692
Sonar's got them
at six thousand yards.

900
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,318
He's already completed
two tight squares.

901
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:10,363
It looks like he's about
to take a wider sweep.

902
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:14,927
What do you think Chief?

903
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:16,800
Well it's a pretty
dark ocean up there

904
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:21,967
but if he carries out the right search
pattern he could pick us up again.

905
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,871
Range five thousand and closing.

906
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:29,412
Lady let's take a look.

907
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:31,918
Steve, keep feeding plot
we're going below.

908
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:33,487
Aye, aye, sir.

909
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,533
He's right there sir
and he's making another turn.

910
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:50,772
Well maybe we should
change course Captain.

911
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:51,531
Come right...

912
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,072
Negative.

913
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,573
We're continuing
toward the entrance.

914
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:56,143
Where the pickings are.

915
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:59,736
Hold course, speed and depth.

916
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:01,873
He may not pick up
an echo at all.

917
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,883
The Litchfield didn't
pass us at three thousand

918
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,649
when we were on the bottom.

919
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,553
Why don't we at least
pop the scope up?

920
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,354
Maybe the weather's lousy
top side and we could surface

921
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:15,760
and run the hell out of here with
our diesels at twenty-one knots.

922
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:17,160
The batteries
are pretty low Captain.

923
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:18,960
Not much juice left
for underwater evasion.

924
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,569
Damn it Lady what if the weather
isn't lousy up there?

925
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,171
We're up moon from them.

926
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:26,206
Even our attack periscope might
show up in his binoculars.

927
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:32,647
He's turning towards us sir.

928
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:39,449
Well maybe he picked up
a school of fish... or something.

929
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:43,524
Range four thousand.

930
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:46,594
Speed thirty knots.

931
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:57,300
Range thirty-five hundred.

932
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,001
Collision course Captain.

933
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:02,075
Rig for depth charge.

934
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:03,735
Rig for silent running.

935
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,813
Emergency give me
one hundred feet.

936
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:06,915
Take it up one hundred feet.

937
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:08,914
All ahead full flood negative.

938
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:10,348
Retrack the sonar heads.

939
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:11,350
I'm going to the bottom.

940
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:12,613
You're bottoming Captain.

941
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,279
That's the way I shook off
the Litchfield remember?

942
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:17,915
His sonar couldn't screen out
the bottom return.

943
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,324
We're an extremis
it's our best chance.

944
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:22,157
Give me a fathometer reading.

945
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:26,257
Have all hands
prepare to bottom.

946
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:27,402
Right.

947
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,561
Full rudder.

948
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:37,207
Will it work?

949
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:38,210
Well it depends.

950
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:39,712
On what?

951
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:42,477
How good the Japs sonar is.

952
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:01,429
All right level off.

953
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,009
All stop.

954
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,373
Answering all stop.

955
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:36,337
On the bottom sir
is nine, seven feet.

956
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:37,905
Very well.

957
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:41,839
Shut down everything
but top side sonar.

958
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:05,631
Top side sonar report
is dead overhead Captain.

959
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:11,196
It's too close
for a good bearing now.

960
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,042
My God it's working.

961
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:25,081
He's gone by us sir.

962
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,104
How are we on air?

963
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,573
Forty hours Captain.

964
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,644
Okay.

965
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:55,114
We'll just lie here
until he fades off.

966
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:06,255
He's coming back Mr. Henry.

967
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:09,262
He's coming back sir.

968
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:13,829
Nothing to worry about.

969
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:15,937
Nothing to worry
about down there.

970
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:19,472
Bottom return
blanks out his sonar.

971
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,542
We know that now.

972
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:16,888
Secure that valve.

973
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:18,659
Let's see some hands over here.

974
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,642
I'm taking her up.

975
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:35,512
Blow all ballast
surface, surface, surface.

976
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:40,086
Byron I'm taking her up
to sixty-five feet.

977
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:44,488
Blow negative. Maximum up angle.
All head full.

978
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:45,650
Six, five aye sir.

979
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:49,560
Make it up six, five feet below
negative mark, ten degree up.

980
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:04,640
All compartments
report damage.

981
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,442
High speed propeller sir
approaching from the entrance.

982
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,380
One bearing three, zero, zero.

983
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:11,850
The other bearing
one, two, zero.

984
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:15,115
Speed twenty knots.

985
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:17,248
Mr. Aster two more destroyers.

986
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:28,031
Periscope depth Briny
but be ready to flood negative

987
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,866
and get me down fast.

988
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,973
Six, five, aye sir
making up six,

989
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:34,507
five feet below
negative the mark.

990
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:35,837
Ten up bubble.

991
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,228
Level off at six, five feet.

992
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,128
Leveling off
at six, five feet sir.

993
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:02,237
Up scope.

994
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:06,831
Hot damn.

995
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:08,271
It's raining, it's pouring.

996
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:10,105
We're right in the middle
of a damn squall.

997
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,144
Black as a cow's inside.

998
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,476
Prepare to surface
four main engines.

999
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:17,551
Prepare to surface
four main engines.

1000
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:21,019
Tell maneuvering room to stand by
to make twenty-one knots.

1001
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:22,953
Ready to surface sir.

1002
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:26,959
Surface! Surface! Surface!

1003
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:30,360
Blow bubble.
Blow main ballast.

1004
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:57,656
Lay up to the conning tower
on the double.

1005
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:59,761
Briny come up here a minute.

1006
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:05,161
What happened?

1007
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,530
He got knocked off his feet
in the darkness.

1008
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,762
I just wanted you to see
why I was giving orders.

1009
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:10,303
Is he all right?

1010
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:11,531
I don't know.

1011
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:13,572
Doc come here
have a look at him.

1012
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:15,677
Aye, aye sir.

1013
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:17,301
What do you think?

1014
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:21,775
Okay guys listen up.

1015
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:27,582
Sonar reports that the destroyers
are rapidly opening the range

1016
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:30,590
and it looks like
we've shaken them off.

1017
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:35,721
Now I'm sure you already know

1018
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:39,766
that during the last barrage
the captain was badly hurt.

1019
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:42,564
Doc Halston says he's got
a concussion that it seems serious.

1020
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:47,403
So what it means is that the Devilfish
is going to have to return to base.

1021
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,670
I know you guys feel
as badly as I do

1022
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:53,941
but the Captain just
isn't up to conducting attacks

1023
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:57,142
and he can't delegate command.

1024
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:59,879
Well how do we get out
Lady and when?

1025
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:01,216
On the surface Foof.

1026
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:02,516
Straight down the middle
of twenty-one knots

1027
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:04,626
at approximately forty minutes.

1028
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,387
On the surface?

1029
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:08,826
Yeah.

1030
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:10,022
I know Billy.

1031
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:11,928
It's a tough one.

1032
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,194
Destroyers and sub chasers
are going to be as thick

1033
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:17,430
as whores on market street.

1034
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,337
You see on the other hand
we've got zero visibility top side<i>;</i>

1035
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:23,205
the entrance is twelve miles wide
and at flank speed

1036
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:26,212
we can run through
and get away in fifteen minutes.

1037
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:30,078
Any comments?

1038
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:33,551
That's the way to go.

1039
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:35,179
All right then that's that.

1040
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:37,189
I secured for a while to allow
the crew to get a sandwich

1041
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:40,784
and hit the head.

1042
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,191
You mean there's
a sailor on this boat

1043
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:44,390
who hasn't already
pissed in his pants.

1044
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:47,161
[laughter]

1045
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:48,894
All right back to battle.

1046
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:05,247
We're passing through
the entrance right now Lady.

1047
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:09,356
Sonar reports screw noises and echo
ranging all around us Mr. Aster.

1048
01:17:09,491 --> 01:17:11,049
Start patrol maneuvers.

1049
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,024
No collision courses.

1050
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:16,528
No sign they've picked us up.

1051
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:19,225
Just goes to show you
ignorance is bliss.

1052
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,859
Here we are absolutely ringed
by the yellow bastards

1053
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:25,667
and its like a pleasure cruise.

1054
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:29,174
Let's just hope we don't ram one.

1055
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:33,138
What's up?

1056
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:36,079
Hi Briny close the curtain.

1057
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:42,789
So how do you like
submarine duty so far?

1058
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:48,695
Listen to me carefully.

1059
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,320
There's nothing wrong
with the Captain

1060
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:53,093
except that he's absolutely
scared out of his mind.

1061
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:54,259
What?

1062
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:55,427
No concussion?

1063
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,800
No. He confessed to Doc Halston
and the doc told me.

1064
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:00,407
I can't believe it.

1065
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:02,134
He just can't hack it Briny.

1066
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,871
The doc had to put him
to sleep with a sedative.

1067
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:05,843
Does anyone else know?

1068
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:07,175
No.

1069
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:09,681
And I'm going to back his story.

1070
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:11,716
The truth will come
out soon enough.

1071
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:16,347
Meantime we're returning to the barn
with our tail between our legs

1072
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:18,254
and that's poison for the crew.

1073
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:21,294
So if we make a contact
on the way back

1074
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:24,160
I'm going to ask
the Captain's permission to shoot.

1075
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:26,529
You're damn right.

1076
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:28,431
Foof will be my kibitzer sir.

1077
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:31,368
You'll man the TDC.

1078
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:32,734
Me?

1079
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:35,434
Lady I've never ran
the TDC on patrol.

1080
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:36,509
So what?

1081
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:39,512
You did a damn good job
on the attack trainer.

1082
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:45,980
Anyway there's nobody else.

1083
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:10,376
[knock at the door]

1084
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:14,209
[pounding on the door]

1085
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:15,440
Who is it?

1086
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:18,849
It's Phil Rule.

1087
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:19,976
Phil my God.

1088
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:22,180
Pam this is
Major Denton Sharp.

1089
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:24,222
How do you do Mrs. Tudsbury?

1090
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:25,724
Come in.

1091
01:19:27,395 --> 01:19:28,760
Do you have any brandy?

1092
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:32,462
Major Sharpe?

1093
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:33,431
Yes please.

1094
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:39,636
Bless me Phil you're drowned.

1095
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,504
Major Denton Sharpe...
Alastair Tudsbury.

1096
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:42,610
My dear fellow...

1097
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,770
Panang has fallen
we've just come from there.

1098
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:46,938
That far south.

1099
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:49,516
All Malay's is falling
it's a route.

1100
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:51,585
I caught some of your
broadcasts up country.

1101
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:55,656
Criminal lies Tudsbury
well how can you still suck up

1102
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,816
to these incompetent,
mendacious bastards?

1103
01:19:57,993 --> 01:20:00,086
Who've botched this job
and lost the empire,

1104
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:01,559
not that it was worth saving.

1105
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:02,993
I told the truth.

1106
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,098
Phil.

1107
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:06,291
Such as I could find out.

1108
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:10,393
Your truth is rule
Brittannia Drivel.

1109
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,166
You might as well let government
house make your dispatches.

1110
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:13,740
Phil please.

1111
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:17,003
I say jolly good brandy.

1112
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:19,204
Don't mind Phil
he's got the wind up.

1113
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:23,010
He's never been through
a retreat like this.

1114
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,311
Well if Malay isn't gone

1115
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:26,317
we can still defeat
these little bastards.

1116
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:28,752
Well I don't agree with you
there Denton but listen to him.

1117
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:31,654
At least he'll give you
something real to report.

1118
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,852
Do you have a map of Malay
about Tudsbury?

1119
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:36,361
Yes, of course.

1120
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:40,761
That hand looks awful.

1121
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:44,599
Yeah I had some imbecile
army medico Lance at Jitra.

1122
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:47,037
I hope I don't lose it.

1123
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:49,166
I could have a touch
of blood poisoning.

1124
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:50,710
I'm shaking all over.

1125
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:53,144
You always
were a real hypochondriac.

1126
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,943
You've always looked naughty
in a nightie.

1127
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:59,110
Than I shall put on
my dressing gown.

1128
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:10,389
But despite the poor performance
of our Asiatic troops

1129
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:12,965
we've still got
the edge Tudsbury.

1130
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:16,867
If the top brass ever
awakens from its funk, if.

1131
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:20,099
The trick is to use delaying
tactics to force the enemy

1132
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:22,540
to using up
his ammunition and supplies.

1133
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:25,908
Meanwhile, our main forces
fall back to two very strong lines.

1134
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:28,242
One here in Jahore
and the other here

1135
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:33,616
along the north shore
of Singapore lsland itself.

1136
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:36,019
Now there's still time
to build those defenses.

1137
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:39,524
What with the labor pool of nearly
two million Chinese and Malayans.

1138
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:41,525
What are you talking about?

1139
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:43,630
The north shore is impregnable.

1140
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:45,960
I've seen the defenses myself.

1141
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:47,466
Well you're wrong.

1142
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:51,402
There's nothing on the north shore
of this island but marsh.

1143
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:53,973
They probably showed you
the walls of the naval base.

1144
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:57,374
Are you telling me that BBC
has been lied to

1145
01:21:57,512 --> 01:21:59,946
by the highest officials
of this city?

1146
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,208
Oh my dear fellow
one uses you.

1147
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,409
Why do you suppose I'm here?

1148
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:07,851
But don't feel badly,
Churchill himself has been lied to.

1149
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:11,390
There's not one man to tell him that
fortress Singapore never did exist.

1150
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:14,791
The empire is teetering
in the balance Tudsbury.

1151
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,660
That's not journalism
that's the military fact.

1152
01:22:17,799 --> 01:22:21,098
We can win here
but we must get cracking.

1153
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:22,362
Very well.

1154
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:24,665
If what you say is true

1155
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:28,833
I've led myself to this
governments suicidal sham.

1156
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:31,673
I shall broadcast your story.

1157
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:32,939
Really?

1158
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:34,446
Smashing.

1159
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:37,813
They won't let you broadcast
out of Singapore Talky.

1160
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,477
The Governor and Brooke Poppum.

1161
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:42,021
Popham will put you behind bars
before that happens.

1162
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:44,318
Very well, I shall go to Australia.

1163
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:45,551
I'll leave in the morning.

1164
01:22:45,694 --> 01:22:47,753
Yes that might work.

1165
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:50,727
You better stay here dear
and keep an eye on things.

1166
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:53,766
Well, Phillip I thank you
and take care of that hand.

1167
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:59,833
I shall be listening
for your broadcast, up country.

1168
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,170
Oh don't bother to see me out.

1169
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:09,046
Well, you'll be in Australia then
for Christmas and I'll be here.

1170
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,709
I know but what is to be done?

1171
01:23:11,853 --> 01:23:15,812
The war,
this story must go on the air.

1172
01:23:15,957 --> 01:23:18,187
What if the Japanese show up
before you get back?

1173
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:19,293
Nonsense.

1174
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:20,792
Do you think I'd abandon you?

1175
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:24,421
The little beggars are still
three hundred miles up country.

1176
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:26,396
Oh well good.

1177
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:27,694
I mean given the choice

1178
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:32,272
I'd rather not be raped by platoons
of slavering Orientals.

1179
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:35,865
Well now that's settled.

1180
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:40,641
You won't mind if I stretch out
here on the couch.

1181
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:43,307
I've got to get to a doctor
with this hand in the morning.

1182
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:46,181
You could have Pam's bed.

1183
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:48,551
We shall be up all the night
writing this story.

1184
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:52,956
Draw him a hot bath dear
and then let's get to work.

1185
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,333
Follow me.

1186
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,102
Ah yes.

1187
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:13,112
Ah yes Tudsey.

1188
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:16,342
I can see this being very,
very cozy in here

1189
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:18,418
until the old gasbag gets back.

1190
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,521
Not bloody likely.

1191
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:23,089
All right now Tudsbury
now let's talk about it.

1192
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:25,988
Well what finally
finishes off in Paris?

1193
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,425
I mean it all got very blurry.

1194
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:30,394
Was it the waitresses?

1195
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:33,228
Low taste I admit
but an amiable weakness?

1196
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:35,699
Not the waitresses Phil.

1197
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:38,965
Not even the whores.

1198
01:24:39,107 --> 01:24:41,667
The Yale boy.

1199
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,368
Oh yes.

1200
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:46,708
Young Antinous.

1201
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:48,543
School boy lapse.

1202
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:51,174
Nothing to get upset about.

1203
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:52,581
You're hopeless.

1204
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:58,290
I do my best though.

1205
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:01,589
But you do realize
you will be alone here

1206
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:04,994
if those slavering whores
do make a sudden break through.

1207
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:06,690
If you're feeling lonely
on Christmas Eve

1208
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:10,326
I'll be staying with some friends
of mine in McMahons.

1209
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:12,564
They'll be having a do.

1210
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:16,301
On that I may take you up.

1211
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:20,847
Don't think I could stand to be
in Singapore alone on Christmas Eve.

1212
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:26,048
Closing shop is right.

1213
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:28,678
When do you think the
Japanese will get through?

1214
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:08,519
What the devil, Pamela?

1215
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:11,962
Come get at the typewriter,
let's go.

1216
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:05,142
Ausweis bitte danke.

1217
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:29,035
<i>Field Marshall</i>
<i>Walter Von Brauchtsch,</i>

1218
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:32,578
<i>Commander In Chief</i>
<i>of the German army.</i>

1219
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:36,047
I have already
offered twice to resign.

1220
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:38,310
What can he do to me?

1221
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:43,014
<i>Colonel General Franz Helder,</i>
<i>Chief of the general staff.</i>

1222
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:46,752
You must not resign.

1223
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:49,385
I am sick.

1224
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:22,355
Yes it's the most colossal mistake
yet was to declare war on America.

1225
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:23,293
Yeah.

1226
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:25,058
Why? Why?

1227
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,963
Perhaps, the treaty
with the Japanese.

1228
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:30,502
But is there Japanese
attacking the United States?

1229
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:32,765
So there was no
treaty obligations.

1230
01:28:32,907 --> 01:28:34,898
He's an adventurer.

1231
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:37,409
He acts on impulse.

1232
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:43,943
<i>Conspiracies to depose</i>
<i>or assassinate Hitler</i>

1233
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:49,488
<i>have existed In the army for years</i>
<i>hence the unprecedented security.</i>

1234
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:56,396

<i>their fanatical loyalty</i>
<i>to Adolph Hitler and the Nazi party.</i>

1239
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:32,659
If only he will listen.

1240
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:37,260
Going on the defensive in
the Soviet Union is the main thing.

1241
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:39,373
Then in the Spring.

1242
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:42,340
There's a smashing
new offensive.

1243
01:29:42,477 --> 01:29:47,642
We maybe able to win
some kind of peace.

1244
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:52,411
[German speaking]

1245
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:54,851
<i>Even the highest Generals</i>

<i>S.S. Guard.</i>

1250
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:13,669
Who is responsible
for this driveling nonsense?

1251
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:15,435
As ordered my Fuhrer.

1252
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:19,876
The Eastern front strategy
to knock England out of the war.

1253
01:30:20,014 --> 01:30:22,778
What has England
to do with this?

1254
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:24,248
Filthy rubbish.

1255
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:33,884
General, withdrawal in the east
your positions?

1256
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:39,795
The front straightened
and shortened.

1257
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:45,531
New front line chosen with
an eye to easy quartering

1258
01:30:45,673 --> 01:30:49,541
and simplified supply problems.

1259
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:57,508
Ah yes you gentlemen
of the officer core

1260
01:30:57,652 --> 01:31:01,053
with your Von's before your names.

1261
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:04,022
You never dusted your
polished boots in a trench,

1262
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:08,492
the kind of trench I served in for four years.

1263
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:13,532
Always looking for an easy war,
for simple war.

1264
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:16,499
While you snicker behind my back
at the Bohemian Corporal

1265
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:20,004
who knows from bitter experience

1266
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:25,340
from lying gassed in a field
hospital that war is hard!

1267
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:31,476
Vain soft, cowardly wretches,
beneath contempt.

1268
01:31:33,855 --> 01:31:36,722
I repeat my request
to be permitted to resign.

1269
01:31:36,858 --> 01:31:37,882
Yes now!

1270
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:39,822
Now that you have ruined
my eastern campaign

1271
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:45,058
I designed it with crystal clarity
it was bound to lead to victory

1272
01:31:45,233 --> 01:31:50,967
if you had done as you were told
and driven for the Caucasus oil.

1273
01:31:51,105 --> 01:31:55,337
But no you knew better.

1274
01:31:55,476 --> 01:31:59,640
You and your generals
had to march on Moscow.

1275
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:04,444
You wanted your
prestige successes.

1276
01:32:04,585 --> 01:32:05,813
Fool!

1277
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:06,817
Weak!

1278
01:32:06,954 --> 01:32:08,945
Nincompoop.

1279
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:12,787
There will be no withdrawal
on the eastern front.

1280
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:14,588
That's final!

1281
01:32:14,729 --> 01:32:22,192
Every German soldier will
hold or die where he stands!

1282
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:30,271
My wermacht will not turn
it's back on the Russians

1283
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:35,474
and fall to pieces
like Napoleon's grand army.

1284
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:41,418
I beg you...
let me resign.

1285
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:42,614
Resign!

1286
01:32:42,757 --> 01:32:44,452
You are dismissed!

1287
01:32:44,592 --> 01:32:51,225
Herr Von Brauchitsch from your post,
from my armed forces,

1288
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:53,856
from all further service
to the fatherland

1289
01:32:54,035 --> 01:32:57,630
that you tried to betray
with this!

1290
01:32:57,772 --> 01:33:00,366
Treasonist filth!

1291
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:30,136
You... will remain.

1292
01:33:40,581 --> 01:33:42,549
This little affair
of operational command

1293
01:33:42,683 --> 01:33:46,141
is something anyone can do.

1294
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:48,380
The task of the Commander In Chief

1295
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:52,481
is to educate the army
in national Socialism.

1296
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:58,532
I know of no General who can do it,
as I want it done.

1297
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:09,474
Therefore, I shall take over
command of the army myself.

1298
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,373
Yes Mien Fuhrer.

1299
01:34:11,512 --> 01:34:14,379
I shall require
a Chief of Staff of course.

1300
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:22,283
If you wish to resign I will permit it.

1301
01:34:22,423 --> 01:34:27,793
If you want to remain at your post
you may.

1302
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:36,703
For now that is all.

1303
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:47,032
A Corporal, a Corporal
relieving a Field Marshall.

1304
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:54,376
The time may be coming
to relieve the Corporal.

1305
01:35:54,515 --> 01:35:56,676
Never say it
never think it.

1306
01:35:56,817 --> 01:35:59,843
The time has passed.

1307
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:03,718
He is a fate of Germany
and fate cannot be state.

1308
01:36:05,392 --> 01:36:07,053
I shall resign, too.

1309
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:09,754
No. No. You are professional.

1310
01:36:09,897 --> 01:36:11,489
He will listen to you.

1311
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:15,500
I'm a scapegoat for his Russian folly
and that's that, so be it.

1312
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:22,772
For the sake of the fatherland
stay at his side,

1313
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:27,370
try to curb the mistakes,
the excesses.

1314
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:31,178
Hope for a turn in the tide.

1315
01:36:38,759 --> 01:36:42,718
The horrors now being committed.

1316
01:36:42,863 --> 01:36:46,196
We all have blood on our hands.

1317
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:49,200
Yeah, the Jews.

1318
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:55,074
It has only begun.

1319
01:37:00,948 --> 01:37:04,907
<i>The British empire staggers</i>
<i>under worldwide disaster.</i>

1320
01:37:05,052 --> 01:37:06,917
<i>The Japanese continue to advance</i>

<i>Singapore and land In Hong Kong.</i>

<i>are sunk off the Malayan coast.</i>

1324
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:25,937
<i>Two more British battleships</i>
<i>go down In the Mediterranean.</i>

1325
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:30,065
<i>Four million tons</i>

1327

<i>Delano Roosevelt.</i>

1331
01:37:49,496 --> 01:37:52,988
What about my grand strategy
memorandum for the President?

1332
01:37:53,133 --> 01:37:58,571
Twenty-five single-spaced pages,
Prime Minister - much to digest.

1333
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:00,604
But I have digested it.

1334
01:38:00,774 --> 01:38:03,538
Germany first.

1335
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:06,112
Correct.

1336
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:13,119
Japan's thrust into Southeast Asia
may well spell for us a disaster,

1337
01:38:13,254 --> 01:38:18,521
but America's entry into the war
can make amends for all.

1338
01:38:20,294 --> 01:38:26,494
I shall press my views on President
Roosevelt with all my force.

1339
01:38:26,634 --> 01:38:29,865
All my force.

1340
01:38:30,004 --> 01:38:30,868
Germany first.

1341
01:38:31,005 --> 01:38:35,408
Despite the Pearl Harbor debacle,
Germany first.

1342
01:38:35,542 --> 01:38:37,874
Winston,
we have always talked softly

1343
01:38:38,012 --> 01:38:39,946
and diplomatically
with the Americans.

1344
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,514
Yah...

1345
01:38:42,683 --> 01:38:46,050
we talked like that
while we were wooing her.

1346
01:38:46,186 --> 01:38:52,921
Now that she's in the harem,
we talk to her quite differently.

1347
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:56,359
[laughter]

1348
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:00,230
By the by, gentlemen,

1349
01:39:00,367 --> 01:39:03,165
we'll light the White House
Christmas tree shortly.

1350
01:39:03,304 --> 01:39:06,831
You're all invited to the ceremony.

1351
01:39:06,974 --> 01:39:10,910
immediately thereafter, to eggnog.

1352
01:39:11,078 --> 01:39:13,444
That's very nice, Mr. President.

1353
01:39:39,773 --> 01:39:42,469
A productive meeting, Winston.

1354
01:39:42,609 --> 01:39:45,476
Mr. President, we've discussed
many great issues,

1355
01:39:45,612 --> 01:39:49,139
but not the greatest.
Not yet.

1356
01:39:49,316 --> 01:39:53,548
Mr. President, is it still
to be Germany first?

1357
01:39:53,687 --> 01:39:57,088
Here's the view
of my Joint Chiefs on that.

1358
01:39:57,257 --> 01:40:00,351
It's quite short.

1359
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:03,691
<i>'</i>'At American-British
staff talks in February,

1360
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:08,962
it was agreed that Germany was
the predominant member of the axis

1361
01:40:09,103 --> 01:40:11,503
and Europe,
the decisive theater.

1362
01:40:11,638 --> 01:40:13,606
Much has happened since then.

1363
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:17,575
Not withstanding Japan's
entry into the war,

1364
01:40:17,745 --> 01:40:22,580
our view remains that Germany
is still the prime enemy,

1365
01:40:22,716 --> 01:40:25,583
and her defeat
is the key to victory.<i>'</i>'

1366
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:27,311
Thank God.

1367
01:40:27,488 --> 01:40:29,353
<i>'</i>'Once Germany is defeated,

1368
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:37,022
<i>'</i>'the collapse of ltaly
and the defeat of Japan will follow.<i>'</i>'

1369
01:40:37,164 --> 01:40:43,535
Franklin, we shall have that evil man.

1370
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:47,106
I believe we shall, Winston.

1371
01:40:47,241 --> 01:40:51,678
Come. You'll throw the switch
and light the tree.

1372
01:40:55,482 --> 01:40:58,349
And perhaps you'll
say a word or two.

1373
01:40:58,519 --> 01:41:00,680
That would be a great honor.

1374
01:41:07,194 --> 01:41:10,061
All set with your speech
for Congress?

1375
01:41:10,197 --> 01:41:12,028
I'm somewhat nervous.

1376
01:41:12,166 --> 01:41:13,030
Not you.

1377
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:15,727
How will you start?

1378
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:20,238
Well, I shall say that
if my father had been American

1379
01:41:20,374 --> 01:41:23,241
and my mother English-
instead of the reverse-

1380
01:41:23,377 --> 01:41:27,404
I might have got here on my own.

1381
01:41:27,548 --> 01:41:29,607
You'll do well.

1382
01:41:32,953 --> 01:41:36,354
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for joining us

1383
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:39,618
in this annual tree-lighting
ceremony this evening.

1384
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:45,721
Standing beside me is one
of the great leaders in the world.

1385
01:41:45,866 --> 01:41:52,430
He and his people have pointed
the way, in courage and in sacrifice,

1386
01:41:52,573 --> 01:41:55,736
for the benefit of little
children everywhere.

1387
01:41:55,876 --> 01:42:01,746
And I'm asking my associate,
my old and good friend, and yours,

1388
01:42:01,915 --> 01:42:06,909
to say a word to the people
of America tonight.

1389
01:42:07,087 --> 01:42:12,855
The Prime Minister of Great Britain,
Winston Churchill.

1390
01:42:12,993 --> 01:42:17,760
[applause]

1391
01:42:20,934 --> 01:42:24,961
This is a strange Christmas Eve.

1392
01:42:25,105 --> 01:42:29,474
Almost the entire world
is locked in deadly struggle.

1393
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:35,014
So, with the most terrible weapons
science can devise,

1394
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:38,016
with the nations' advance
upon each other.

1395
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:44,751
Yet, let the children have
their night of fun and laughter.

1396
01:42:44,925 --> 01:42:51,797
Then we turn again to the stern task
and the formidable years,

1397
01:42:51,932 --> 01:42:55,060
in God's mercy.

1398
01:42:55,202 --> 01:42:58,831
A happy Christmas to you all.

1399

1400
01:43:08,448 --> 01:43:11,178
And now, for the ninth time,

1401
01:43:11,318 --> 01:43:15,118
we'll light the living
community Christmas tree

1402
01:43:15,289 --> 01:43:18,190
of our nation's capital.

1403
01:43:18,325 --> 01:43:21,886
Mr. Prime Minister,

He is improving, isn't he?

1416
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:40,304
He will never improve.

The entire American fleet

No one knows what happened

They lost all eight battleships.

Was he on a battleship?

1450
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:29,647
Denton Shairpe didn't know
the extent of the casualties.

1451

Maybe he's alive.

I would have hated it

Let the Japanese have it.

1462
01:46:59,146 --> 01:47:01,876
I'm going back up to the house.

Is there anything you need?

1465
01:47:05,519 --> 01:47:09,649
I might be a bit lonely perhaps.

Why don't you, Pam?

1473

Truly, that's a charming idea.

You haven't changed a bit.

Oh. Darling, I was born
into a rotten system.

1479
01:47:57,671 --> 01:48:00,105
I'm merely a reflection of it.

1480

When everything's breaking up,
the only thing left is pleasure.

You believe in that.

02:01:52,905 --> 02:01:54,202
All ahead 1/3.

1600
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:56,968
Answering. All ahead 1/3.

1601
02:01:59,111 --> 02:02:00,339
Up scope!

1602
02:02:04,717 --> 02:02:06,708
He's closing fast.
Down scope!

1603
02:02:06,852 --> 02:02:08,786
Give me a course for a 90-track.

1604
02:02:08,921 --> 02:02:10,115
Right to 150, sir.

1605
02:02:10,256 --> 02:02:11,917
Open outer doors.

1606
02:02:12,058 --> 02:02:14,322
Coming right to 150.

1607
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:15,518
Open outer doors.

1608
02:02:15,661 --> 02:02:17,151
Generator range, 1-200.

1609
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:18,820
We have a solution light.

1610
02:02:18,998 --> 02:02:21,466
Very well, Briny. Up scope.

1611
02:02:21,634 --> 02:02:24,501
This will be the final bearing.

1612
02:02:26,605 --> 02:02:27,264
Mark?

1613
02:02:27,406 --> 02:02:28,338
013.

1614
02:02:28,507 --> 02:02:29,565
Down scope.

1615
02:02:29,709 --> 02:02:32,542
013. Set. Solution light.

1616
02:02:32,678 --> 02:02:35,476
We're right on.
Distance to track - 800 yards.

1617
02:02:35,614 --> 02:02:37,479
Fire three!

1618
02:02:37,616 --> 02:02:39,709
Number three fired
electrically, sir.

1619
02:02:39,852 --> 02:02:41,251
Fire four!

1620
02:02:41,387 --> 02:02:43,651
Number four fired
electrically, sir.

1621
02:02:43,789 --> 02:02:48,351
Torpedo run to target,
32 seconds, sir.

1622
02:02:48,494 --> 02:02:53,955
Both fish running out
straight and normal.

1623
02:02:59,405 --> 02:03:00,872
Up scope.

1624
02:03:09,348 --> 02:03:10,906
Two wakes.

1625
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:13,541
Dead on.

1626
02:03:17,590 --> 02:03:19,023
[explosion]

1627
02:03:20,459 --> 02:03:23,019
Whoo! Yay! Yay!

1628
02:03:23,162 --> 02:03:25,187
[explosion]

1629
02:03:25,331 --> 02:03:28,198
Whoo!

1630
02:03:28,334 --> 02:03:29,995
All gone.

1631
02:03:30,169 --> 02:03:31,329
God, what a sight!

1632
02:03:31,504 --> 02:03:32,368
Put the camera on here!

1633
02:03:32,505 --> 02:03:35,099
That's beautiful!
That's magnificent!

1634
02:03:35,274 --> 02:03:36,536
It just takes one.

1635
02:03:36,675 --> 02:03:38,302
It's a successful patrol.

1636
02:03:38,444 --> 02:03:40,810
Well done, Briny, well done.

1637
02:03:40,946 --> 02:03:42,208
Get a couple more, then look.

1638
02:03:42,348 --> 02:03:43,315
What a sight!

1639
02:03:43,449 --> 02:03:44,746
Everybody have a look!

1640
02:03:44,884 --> 02:03:45,942
Everybody in the attack party.

1641
02:03:46,085 --> 02:03:50,146
Come on up from down there, guys.
Have a look in this thing.

1642
02:03:50,289 --> 02:03:51,517
Here, Briny.

1643
02:03:51,657 --> 02:03:54,421
Now eyeball that!

1644
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:55,857
Wow!

1645
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:03,167
How about that?

1646
02:04:03,302 --> 02:04:07,261
A perfect solution. Perfect!

1647
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:09,874
He's going to burn
for a while there.

1648
02:04:10,009 --> 02:04:13,638
Briny, you're the hottest
TDC operator in the South China Sea.

1649
02:04:13,779 --> 02:04:15,542
Foof, have a look.

1650
02:04:15,681 --> 02:04:16,739
Two out of two.

1651
02:04:16,882 --> 02:04:18,816
Have you ever seen anything
more beautiful?

1652
02:04:18,951 --> 02:04:21,749
Never seen anything
half as beautiful!

1653
02:04:21,887 --> 02:04:23,616
You bet you haven't.

1654
02:04:23,756 --> 02:04:24,984
Merry Christmas.

1655
02:04:25,124 --> 02:04:27,854
Now you got a story
to tell Natalie, huh?

1656
02:05:19,144 --> 02:05:21,339
Thank you for waiting for me,
Natalie.

1657
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:24,347
It's cold and windy up on deck.

1658
02:05:24,483 --> 02:05:26,610
Let me give you some coffee.

1659
02:05:26,752 --> 02:05:28,413
Thank you.

1660
02:05:40,366 --> 02:05:42,334
How's your baby?

1661
02:05:42,468 --> 02:05:46,598
Cranky. He keeps pawing
at his ear, and he's feverish.

1662
02:05:46,739 --> 02:05:47,603
Sugar?

1663
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:50,300
No, thank you.

1664
02:05:53,245 --> 02:05:54,712
Sit.

1665
02:06:09,528 --> 02:06:11,587
So...

1666
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:14,631
are you coming with us?

1667
02:06:14,767 --> 02:06:16,962
I'm trying to make up my mind.

1668
02:06:17,102 --> 02:06:19,332
That shouldn't be hard.

1669
02:06:19,505 --> 02:06:23,271
Decide what's the best
for yourself and do it.

1670
02:06:23,409 --> 02:06:29,109
Listen, the Italians have no use for
a lot of hungry and stateless Jews.

1671
02:06:29,248 --> 02:06:32,183
We'll go, Mrs. Henry.

1672
02:06:32,318 --> 02:06:35,082
You should come, too.

1673
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:37,688
I should?

1674
02:06:37,823 --> 02:06:39,256
Why?

1675
02:06:39,391 --> 02:06:42,189
Perhaps because your baby is Jewish

1676
02:06:42,328 --> 02:06:47,391
and should go
to the Jewish homeland.

1677
02:06:47,533 --> 02:06:51,936
Don't you understand...

1678
02:06:52,071 --> 02:06:55,598
I feel no emotion
about Palestine. None.

1679
02:06:55,741 --> 02:06:57,709
I'm an American,
completely irreligious,

1680
02:06:57,843 --> 02:07:00,641
married to a Christian naval officer.

1681
02:07:07,086 --> 02:07:10,487
Tell me about your husband.

1682
02:07:10,623 --> 02:07:15,026
Well, he's on a submarine
in the Pacific somewhere.

1683
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:19,187
I haven't seen him in ages.

1684
02:07:27,806 --> 02:07:30,798
That was my wife.

1685
02:07:30,976 --> 02:07:35,310
She was killed in a bus
that the Arabs blew up.

1686
02:07:35,447 --> 02:07:37,244
That's awful.

1687
02:07:41,587 --> 02:07:45,455
It happened eight years ago.

1688
02:07:45,591 --> 02:07:50,528
And you want me
to bring my baby there?

1689
02:07:50,663 --> 02:07:52,858
Jews live in danger everywhere.

1690
02:07:52,998 --> 02:07:56,729
Not in America.

1691
02:07:56,869 --> 02:08:00,930
There are no boats to America.

1692
02:08:08,881 --> 02:08:12,749
Here's my husband Byron.

1693
02:08:12,885 --> 02:08:15,149
It was taken on our honeymoon
in Lisbon.

1694
02:08:15,287 --> 02:08:17,482
It lasted all of two days.

1695
02:08:17,623 --> 02:08:21,184
He looks young. When was this?

1696
02:08:21,326 --> 02:08:25,660
A million years ago,
it seems like.

1697
02:08:25,798 --> 02:08:29,632
No-l mean, yes,
he's young, but...

1698
02:08:29,768 --> 02:08:32,236
he's exceptional.

1699
02:08:32,371 --> 02:08:36,273
Byron has a marvelous knack for, I don't know,

1700
02:08:36,408 --> 02:08:39,400
for getting things done.
You'd have to meet him.

1701
02:08:39,578 --> 02:08:42,672
Bring your son to Palestine.

1702
02:08:42,848 --> 02:08:46,443
He'll grow up to be a man
of action like his father.

1703
02:08:48,987 --> 02:08:51,751
You know, Werner Beck's
coming in the morning,

1704
02:08:51,890 --> 02:08:54,688
just in case we decide
to leave the ship.

1705
02:09:00,199 --> 02:09:03,168
Yes, I know.

1706
02:09:03,302 --> 02:09:07,830
[crash]

1707
02:09:07,973 --> 02:09:10,032
Steady.

1708
02:09:10,175 --> 02:09:13,633
I'm sorry.

1709
02:09:18,050 --> 02:09:20,382
The wind keeps backing around.

1710
02:09:20,519 --> 02:09:25,547
The weather report is not good.

1711
02:09:25,691 --> 02:09:29,855
Still, we sail
with the first light.

1712
02:09:29,995 --> 02:09:33,123
That may solve my problem.

1713
02:09:33,265 --> 02:09:35,426
Maybe Beck won't be here that early.

1714
02:09:35,567 --> 02:09:39,059
Oh, he will come, all right.

1715
02:09:39,204 --> 02:09:41,729
[knock on door]

1716
02:09:41,874 --> 02:09:43,068
Yes?

1717
02:09:43,208 --> 02:09:44,300
Sorry to interrupt.

1718
02:09:44,443 --> 02:09:47,378
The baby's behaving
rather strangely.

1719
02:09:50,916 --> 02:09:55,148
[baby cries]

1720
02:09:55,287 --> 02:09:57,778
Uh...convulsions. Hmm.

1721
02:09:57,956 --> 02:10:00,550
It is this inflamed left ear.

1722
02:10:00,692 --> 02:10:02,319
A febrile episode.

1723
02:10:02,461 --> 02:10:05,157
Don't worry, Natalie.
Infants come out of convulsions.

1724
02:10:05,297 --> 02:10:07,595
The doctor will give him something.

1725
02:10:07,733 --> 02:10:10,497
Unfortunately,
for this there's no medicine.

1726
02:10:10,636 --> 02:10:12,331
What about a warm bath?

1727
02:10:12,471 --> 02:10:14,996
Yes. Yes, this could help.

1728
02:10:15,140 --> 02:10:19,474
But there's no hot water
on this boat.

1729
02:10:19,645 --> 02:10:22,170
Come. The galley.

1730
02:10:43,235 --> 02:10:48,639
Fortunately,
soup is the mainstay of our diet.

1731
02:10:48,774 --> 02:10:50,435
Feel that.

1732
02:10:50,576 --> 02:10:51,474
Too warm?

1733
02:10:51,610 --> 02:10:53,544
No.

1734
02:11:00,118 --> 02:11:02,746
When my baby brother
went into a convulsion,

1735
02:11:02,888 --> 02:11:06,255
that's what my mother
always did.

1736
02:11:16,201 --> 02:11:18,635
Get some on his head, too.

1737
02:11:29,147 --> 02:12:07,774
[singing]

1738
02:12:37,049 --> 02:12:39,517
Come along, my dear.

1739
02:12:48,660 --> 02:12:52,027
My God, Natalie, you're not
really leaving the boat,

1740
02:12:52,164 --> 02:12:54,632
putting yourself in the hands
of that German?

1741
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,062
My baby's sick as hell.

1742
02:12:56,201 --> 02:12:59,659
I know babies' fevers
are frightening,

1743
02:12:59,805 --> 02:13:02,774
but it's amazing how they recover,
throw them off.

1744
02:13:02,908 --> 02:13:08,210
A few days at sea, and you'll
be safe in the Jewish homeland.

1745
02:13:08,347 --> 02:13:09,473
We appreciate your concern,

1746
02:13:09,614 --> 02:13:12,276
but Natalie's
already made a decision.

1747
02:13:12,417 --> 02:13:15,580
This ship will be 10 days at sea.

1748
02:13:15,721 --> 02:13:18,986
There will be weeks
in the wild Syrian mountains.

1749
02:13:19,124 --> 02:13:24,391
And also, the Turks or British may
stop the boat and send it back.

1750
02:13:32,504 --> 02:13:34,495
Okay, let me help you.

1751
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:36,402
You're very kind.

1752
02:13:36,541 --> 02:13:38,441
Let your uncle get off,
if he insists.

1753
02:13:38,577 --> 02:13:39,669
He's had his life.

1754
02:13:39,811 --> 02:13:41,335
Not you and Lewis.

1755
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:42,879
Listen to me, darling.

1756
02:13:43,015 --> 02:13:45,916
Sarah, you're not helping.

1757
02:13:46,051 --> 02:13:50,579
I suppose we oughtn't to keep
Werner waiting, Natalie.

1758
02:14:02,734 --> 02:14:04,759
Mrs. Henry.

1759
02:14:07,339 --> 02:14:10,137
Professor.

1760
02:14:10,275 --> 02:14:14,109
I'm so pleased that you made
the right decision.

1761
02:14:18,483 --> 02:14:21,816
Well, Dr. Jastrow...goodbye.

1762
02:14:21,953 --> 02:14:24,387
Goodbye, Rabinovitz.

1763
02:14:24,523 --> 02:14:27,981
Perhaps we shall meet again.

1764
02:14:40,505 --> 02:14:42,473
Am I doing the right thing?

1765
02:14:42,607 --> 02:14:47,010
It's done.

1766
02:14:47,145 --> 02:14:53,106
Mrs. Henry, do you remember the
last line from the Passover seder?
