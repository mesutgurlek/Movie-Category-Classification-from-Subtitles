1
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:19,773
Kill them.

2
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:49,869
If you kill it,
it is I who will.

3
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:52,273
With a machete.

4
00:03:55,882 --> 00:03:57,782
They will suffer greatly.

5
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:08,088
Do what he tells you.

6
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,116
You are now a rebel
Grand Tiger.

7
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,782
We have 10 children ...

8
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,720
20 Kalashnikovs.

9
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:17,144
Hurry.

10
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:25,440
Sit.

11
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:47,996
Take. It's like your father,
Your mother.

12
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:58,345
Should not hold the gun
like this ...

13
00:08:58,418 --> 00:09:02,149
Must hold like this.

14
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:04,183
Got it?

15
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:08,190
Never lose, never
your weapon.

16
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:11,560
We are rebels.

17
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:13,492
Respect your arms ...

18
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:15,329
as your new daddy
and mom.

19
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,469
Look at me.
Why are you looking down?

20
00:11:03,142 --> 00:11:05,610
Gives the biscuits!

21
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:09,076
It's been two days
I have not eaten anything.

22
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,137
Person needs to know
I've given you.

23
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:59,559
I'll tell you
a story ...

24
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:04,230
which tells how
military life is hard.

25
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:06,628
Look.

26
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:08,435
My scar.

27
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:14,238
Look.

28
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:19,381
This is a bullet wound.

29
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:24,554
It was said to smoke at night
but I still smoked.

30
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:26,753
The bullet hit me.

31
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:31,619
Lifted the rifle. Tire.

32
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:47,850
Save yourself!

33
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:39,854
- We ...
- A witch ...

34
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:02,845
- Who will win ...
- The Government!

35
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,570
It is said that ...

36
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:01,634
you can see ...

37
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:05,643
wizards government
in the forest.

38
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:12,313
I have a gift.

39
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:22,288
My wizard ...

40
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:25,653
was engraved with magic.

41
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:44,328
Wake up!

42
00:23:59,718 --> 00:24:02,312
It not hit the witch
Grand Tiger!

43
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:11,147
I return.

44
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:14,022
I will fight.

45
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:56,393
We need to celebrate!

46
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,012
Ask better than that!

47
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:32,756
This is a book about
the history of the Grand Tiger.

48
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:36,450
While he was
incantations ...

49
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:39,497
sunlight,

50
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:43,091
he fell on 30 elephants.

51
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:45,227
But thanks â magic,

52
00:28:45,303 --> 00:28:48,272
he was able to defeat the elephants.

53
00:28:57,349 --> 00:29:00,375
You know why
it's called Grand Tiger?

54
00:29:00,452 --> 00:29:04,354
Because his magic
is so powerful ...

55
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:07,290
he can eat
men!

56
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,134
What are you doing?

57
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:52,492
Sit down.

58
00:30:00,078 --> 00:30:01,272
What is it?

59
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:04,314
This is the Eye of the night.

60
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:07,517
He sees what happens
in the night.

61
00:30:08,687 --> 00:30:11,281
And it?

62
00:30:14,593 --> 00:30:17,858
The protection of the ancestors.

63
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:20,494
Wings?

64
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:23,260
It is the bird of night.

65
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:26,136
He takes the Eye
in the sky.

66
00:30:27,272 --> 00:30:29,467
I have something ...

67
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:34,303
You'll always
have on you ...

68
00:30:38,817 --> 00:30:40,307
Give me your hand.

69
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:24,557
Put it in your pocket.

70
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:05,767
- What are you doing?
- I take the sap magic.

71
00:32:38,637 --> 00:32:40,730
The son of the Chief wanted to marry ...

72
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:42,500
Then he invited the girls.

73
00:32:42,574 --> 00:32:46,533
They are disguised ...

74
00:32:57,522 --> 00:33:00,457
"You're pretty, miss."

75
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:07,579
It not return
at Grand Tiger!

76
00:35:07,652 --> 00:35:10,382
- I'm not leaving!
- You're coming with us!

77
00:35:15,493 --> 00:35:17,393
No, but I dream ...

78
00:35:17,729 --> 00:35:20,755
You know what grigri?

79
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:24,768
It is you who will die
if you shoot, not me.

80
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:28,862
After all I've done
for you ...

81
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,034
I have protected the forest,
on the river ...

82
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,944
- We go to Grand Papa Tiger!
- No!

83
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:39,606
You've lost your mind.

84
00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:41,015
They made you mad.

85
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:42,575
Come on, get out!

86
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:56,761
We're going.

87
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:59,827
- Leave me alone!
- Come on, I say!

88
00:36:03,741 --> 00:36:06,767
Listen to me.

89
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:31,595
Come on, we're going.

90
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:10,130
It is backward or forward?

91
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:13,973
Not a pig
rowing better than you!

92
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:15,945
You say anything ...

93
00:37:16,948 --> 00:37:19,883
We have already capsized
if it was not for me.

94
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:13,830
Give me a white cock!

95
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:21,036
Are you kidding me?

96
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:25,008
Are you in love?
You want to marry?

97
00:38:26,718 --> 00:38:29,653
Mom Angela!

98
00:38:30,955 --> 00:38:33,583
What makes you laugh
like this?

99
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:36,627
It seeks a white cock
to marry.

100
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:46,361
You are completly cracked!

101
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:01,812
Where can I find
a white cock?

102
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:04,047
Does not exist ...

103
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:06,620
It exists because I looking for one!

104
00:39:06,691 --> 00:39:09,216
My father wanted to marry
the most beautiful girl in the country.

105
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:11,853
He has requested,
he has never found

106
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:14,056
when he married my mother
for 10 cows!

107
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:17,226
Well okay, where
chickens here?

108
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:19,394
There is a loose-down barn.

109
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:23,038
- But there's no white cock ...
- Forget it.

110
00:39:58,176 --> 00:40:03,375
Bastards! You will
slaughtered die!

111
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:30,263
I do not want.

112
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:33,303
We need a white cock
to be together ...

113
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:36,238
The white cocks
do not exist.

114
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:40,299
Your father lied.

115
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:44,309
All those whom I asked â
told me.

116
00:41:44,382 --> 00:41:46,976
The white cocks exist
in your village.

117
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:52,853
And you refuse my hugs
for a white cock that does not exist.

118
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:58,086
So I'm going.

119
00:44:00,651 --> 00:44:03,017

120
00:44:08,326 --> 00:44:10,123
Stop your antics!

121
00:44:10,194 --> 00:44:14,961
Money! For the hospital.

122
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:21,561
You hit my brother.
You will pay! Help!

123
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:10,677
Tell me ...

124
00:45:11,756 --> 00:45:14,520
You know where I can find
a white cock?

125
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:20,321
They are difficult
â find ...

126
00:45:20,398 --> 00:45:24,562
I know!

127
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:30,039
Give me a grigri
to protect myself against the war.

128
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:33,634
- That's all you want?
- Yes.

129
00:46:45,716 --> 00:46:47,809
- Maestro is the all?
- Yes.

130
00:47:45,743 --> 00:47:50,874
A white cock is três expensive
this is rare.

131
00:47:51,148 --> 00:47:52,843
It'll cost money.

132
00:47:55,386 --> 00:47:58,753
I say you're a magician?

133
00:47:58,822 --> 00:48:00,722
I have three wives.

134
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:03,157
I see one on Monday,
one on Tuesday,

135
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:04,489

00:48:04,562 --> 00:48:06,530
â difficult to manage.

137
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:08,895
So you give me
some money ...

138
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:12,363
and you give me also
something for strength.

139
00:48:12,436 --> 00:48:15,166
No troubleshooting,
I have what you need.

140
00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:20,773

This is to get married,
then show your courage.

144
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,924
Come.

145

147
00:51:39,543 --> 00:51:41,602
My wife Komona.

148
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:02,724
You do not need it anymore.

Is pressed and the oil is extracted.

150
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:08,837
It picks up
the Witch King Tiger.

151
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:11,100
It's not her witch
This is my wife.

152
00:57:11,742 --> 00:57:13,141
She's not going anywhere.

153
00:57:16,246 --> 00:57:17,941
We start with the witch!

154
00:57:18,014 --> 00:57:21,279
She does not.

155
00:57:23,286 --> 00:57:24,480
Hold it!

156
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:28,290
Leave him alone!

157
00:57:56,386 --> 00:57:58,115
Kill him.

158
00:58:24,181 --> 00:58:25,910
You are my wife.

159
00:58:28,385 --> 00:58:29,977
Be happy.

Why are you looking at me?

162
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,734
I do not concern you.

163
01:02:46,076 --> 01:02:47,600
You look at me.

164
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:55,450

No.

171
01:05:59,902 --> 01:06:01,665
Okay, little one?

172
01:06:15,418 --> 01:06:17,318
Help us, Komona.

173
01:06:19,555 --> 01:06:21,489
Why not you help us?

174
01:06:58,594 --> 01:07:00,323
Come.

175
01:07:14,844 --> 01:07:16,072
Lead us.

176
01:07:17,347 --> 01:07:20,544
This is a hearse.
I wait for a corpse ...

177
01:07:23,086 --> 01:07:24,815
Go!

178
01:07:25,955 --> 01:07:28,014
You go to the cemetery later.

179
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,907
- Faster!
- It does not ...

180
01:08:02,658 --> 01:08:04,751
Where can you file?

181
01:08:04,827 --> 01:08:07,387
They'll put you in jail
if you go â hospital.

182
01:08:08,498 --> 01:08:11,490
My uncle, the butcher.

183
01:08:11,701 --> 01:08:13,931
- You know where it is?
- Yes ...

184
01:08:26,983 --> 01:08:31,545
Where is the house of the butcher?

185
01:08:31,854 --> 01:08:36,416
At the end, â right.

186
01:09:42,825 --> 01:09:44,554
Grows.

187
01:09:54,637 --> 01:09:56,537
Why did you put?

188
01:09:58,107 --> 01:10:00,905
You could stifle
child, you know.

189
01:10:26,569 --> 01:10:28,264
The child is alive.

190
01:10:45,821 --> 01:10:47,550
Rest.

191
01:10:49,158 --> 01:10:51,058
You're like my daughter.

192
01:10:52,962 --> 01:10:56,056
I'll teach you
â raise goats.

193
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,148
Where is my gun?

194
01:11:48,184 --> 01:11:50,345
Give me my weapon
or I'll kill you.

195
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:58,784
My weapon is my child,
This is my father.

196
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:02,058
This is my mother ...

197
01:12:02,765 --> 01:12:05,325
I'll kill you,
give me my gun.

198
01:12:05,601 --> 01:12:07,228
You have a nightmare.

199
01:13:08,097 --> 01:13:10,793
You want to force me
â confess.

200
01:13:12,168 --> 01:13:15,331
You eat people at night.

201
01:13:15,404 --> 01:13:16,996
I do not eat one!

202
01:13:17,073 --> 01:13:19,098
You eat people at night!

203
01:13:19,175 --> 01:13:21,700
How witchcraft
Is she into you?

204
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:23,802
She's not into me!

205
01:13:32,021 --> 01:13:33,921
What do you want?

206
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:36,949
Witchcraft in me.

207
01:13:37,927 --> 01:13:40,862
How witchcraft
Is it coming?

208
01:13:42,398 --> 01:13:46,732
By Grand Tiger's gun.

209
01:13:49,038 --> 01:13:50,300
What?

210
01:13:50,372 --> 01:13:53,808
By Grand Tiger's gun.

211
01:13:54,844 --> 01:13:57,005
What do you want?

212
01:13:57,947 --> 01:14:00,472
I want you to débarrassiez
witchcraft.

213
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:05,881
I need a gift
to pray.

214
01:14:09,225 --> 01:14:13,423
You must pray much
â God and ask for forgiveness ...

215
01:14:13,496 --> 01:14:17,762
so that the spirit of Komona
returned to you.

216
01:14:30,146 --> 01:14:33,172
I'll kill you!
You killed my family, my husband!

217
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:35,080
Give me my gun!

218
01:14:38,854 --> 01:14:40,082
What are you doing?

219
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:07,114
Wait!

220
01:21:13,749 --> 01:21:19,415
Go, go, Dad.

221
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:26,689
Go, go, mom.

222
01:23:15,337 --> 01:23:16,861
Where are you going?

223
01:23:18,607 --> 01:23:20,768
My uncle, the butcher.

224
01:23:20,842 --> 01:23:22,036
Monte.

225
01:23:22,944 --> 01:23:24,639
I have no money.

226
01:23:24,713 --> 01:23:26,613
Nobody has any money.

227
01:23:53,675 --> 01:23:55,939
Leaves, I got it.

228
01:29:57,672 --> 01:30:00,004
