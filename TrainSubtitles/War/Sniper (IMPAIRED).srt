1
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:45,788
Range me.

2
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:50,250
Three to five on the legs.

3
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,135
They're coming.

4
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:21,901
Scan him. Find Cabrera.

5
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:34,036
At the jeep. Designer sunglasses.

6
00:04:34,078 --> 00:04:35,663
You sure that's him?

7
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:37,748
I'm reading his rank and name tag.

8
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,834
He's moving.

9
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:47,964
Six-five-zero. Range me.

10
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:53,135
Range correct: 6-5-0.

11
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:55,971
When he clears the civilians,
he's mine.

12
00:06:57,364 --> 00:06:59,282
- Anything?
- No, nothing.

13
00:07:15,713 --> 00:07:17,464
Two more hours.

14
00:07:17,547 --> 00:07:19,424
Damn! I hate the down time.

15
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:21,759
Well, you have a leave coming up,
don't you?

16
00:07:21,843 --> 00:07:23,552
Yeah.

17
00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:38,398
That can't be our extraction!

18
00:07:41,484 --> 00:07:44,778
Oh, those dipshits!
I told them no daylight!

19
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:46,697
Should I pop smoke?

20
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:51,618
Let's get out of here before those dicks
page us over the P.A. system!

21
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:43,127
Come on!

22
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,015
Get back! You're crazy!
He's gone down!

23
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,391
Wait!

24
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:03,861
Why didn't you let the door gunner
sweep it out first?

25
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:08,698
My spotter's dead because you assholes
got here early!

26
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:10,909
I asked for a night extraction!

27
00:11:10,992 --> 00:11:14,036
I ought to leave you out there,
you son of a bitch!

28
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:34,553
We'll be needing both of those, gunny.

29
00:11:34,637 --> 00:11:36,221
He only needs one.

30
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:55,621
Colonel Weymuth, this is Richard Miller.

31
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:57,706
- He'll be our man in Panama.
- How do you do?

32
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:01,042
- Heard a lot about you.
- Come on. Sit down.

33
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:20,225
Intelligence indicates that there's
a major coup planned...

34
00:13:20,308 --> 00:13:22,018
for election day in Panama.

35
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,146
Colombian drug lord Raoul Ochoa
is bankrolling it.

36
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,150
His plan is to put in
rebel General Miguel Alvarez in power.

37
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:33,152
We have less than one week
to prevent that.

38
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:35,070
With his man Alvarez running
the country...

39
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:38,031
Ochoa could very easily gain access
to the Panama Canal.

40
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:40,658
We have only one shot at Alvarez...

41
00:13:40,742 --> 00:13:44,495
and it is absolutely critical
that we eliminate the general...

42
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:46,330
prior to next week's election.

43
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:51,626
Now, this operation
won't bear congressional scrutiny.

44
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:54,628
It must be completely covert.

45
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,547
You won't be getting a medal for this.

46
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:00,008
But there will be other
tangible benefits.

47
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:02,593
First one's Alvarez.

48
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,014
Most recent photo
was taken ten days ago.

49
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,266
The ponytail's Ochoa.

50
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,310
Ochoa's never seen outside of Colombia.

51
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,313
That's Alvarez's hacienda.
That's where you'll find him.

52
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:17,856
That's your shooter.

53
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,359
That's Master Gunnery Sargent
Thomas Beckett.

54
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:23,152
He's the Marine Corps' top man.

55
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:26,113
He's logged more time in the jungle
than any other sniper.

56
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:29,366
On this particular mission,
your function is to be his spotter.

57
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:32,785
Mr. Miller, should anything happen
to Beckett...

58
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:35,037
your duty would be to eliminate Alvarez.

59
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,914
- Personally.
- Don't worry about having to shoot him.

60
00:14:37,998 --> 00:14:40,834
Beckett is the best,
and I'm sure it wouldn't come to that.

61
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:43,336
I may not have any kills...

62
00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:46,338
but I have had men in my sights.

63
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:47,756
Good.

64
00:14:48,798 --> 00:14:52,135
We're giving you rank on this one:
GS-9.

65
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:55,512
The mission is under your command.
It's your responsibility.

66
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:57,681
Good luck.

67
00:14:58,807 --> 00:15:01,392
Consider it done. Gentlemen.

68
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,191
One last thing.

69
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:11,984
This assignment is critical.

70
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:14,904
If at any point Beckett becomes
a liability...

71
00:15:14,987 --> 00:15:17,614
or he endangers this mission's
covert status...

72
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:20,450
you're gonna have to take him out.

73
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:21,501
The embassy's pleased.

74
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:26,296
They'll mark Cabrera confirmed kill,
classified, on your service jacket.

75
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,340
We're very sorry about your spotter.

76
00:16:28,381 --> 00:16:31,884
If was a rebel sniper that got Papich.
He's still out there.

77
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:38,682
Washington is really excited
about these upcoming elections.

78
00:16:38,723 --> 00:16:41,142
Oh? Why is that, sir?

79
00:16:41,184 --> 00:16:44,103
Our policy is to see this country
have a freely-elected government.

80
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,230
That could happen in a couple of months.

81
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,110
You know it'll be the usual damn thing.

82
00:16:52,193 --> 00:16:54,487
People will be too scared to vote.

83
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:58,698
Well, whatever you and I
may think, Tom...

84
00:16:58,782 --> 00:17:02,827
Washington feels that this is the right
time to go after the rebel leadership.

85
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:06,413
You're sending it my way, sir?

86
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:08,457
Yes, I am.

87
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,168
We're getting a little long in the tooth
for this kind of thing, Tom.

88
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:16,964
But I figured that this would make
a great capper for a fine career.

89
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:22,468
The National Security Council is sending
a guy along to help- a shooter.

90
00:17:22,552 --> 00:17:25,888
- He's coming with full plans.
- A civilian?

91
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:28,432
Just hold on.
Take a look.

92
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:31,517
The army shooting team
plucked this guy right out of ROTC.

93
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:33,769
He took a silver in the '88 Olympics.

94
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:37,689
After his discharge the N.S.C. assigned
him to a Washington D.C. SWAT team.

95
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:39,649
It's all in there.
Take a look.

96
00:17:41,484 --> 00:17:43,194
Has he ever been in a jungle?

97
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:44,904
Does he speak any Spanish?

98
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:48,156
This is not a matter of choice.
Just trust me.

99
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:51,492
Anybody the N.S.C. sends down here
is gonna be fully qualified.

100
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,090
Hey, yo!

101
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:11,259
What do you got in there anyway?

102
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,261
A bassoon.

103
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,057
With the Marine Corps band, right?

104
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,934
Exactly.

105
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:24,603
New Psy-ops strategy. We're gonna
charm the rebels, like snakes.

106
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,272
Whip a charm on this!

107
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:30,233
Shit, Ripoly! Whip a charm!

108
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,324
Hey, take a swig.

109
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:42,201
It'll burn through that frost you got.

110
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,125
Give me your battle dressing!

111
00:18:52,835 --> 00:18:55,337
Jesus Christ!

112
00:18:58,298 --> 00:19:00,383
We got wounded!

113
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:07,139
Jesus Christ!

114
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:11,017
Baker, stand by!

115
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:16,897
We're hit!

116
00:19:25,904 --> 00:19:27,823
Where is he? Anyone got a visual?

117
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:31,909
There he is! Get him!

118
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:39,749
- He's on your side! Get him!
- You're gonna get us all killed!

119
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,085
For Christ's sake! Take it down!

120
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:45,504
- He's shooting at us!
- Use your fucking weapons!

121
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,007
What the-

122
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:55,512
We're gonna die!
Oh, God! We're gonna die!

123
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,438
Kill him!

124
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,984
Get us out of here!
Come on! Shoot him!

125
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:16,613
Hit him! Come on! Go!

126
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:22,160
Come on!

127
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,136
Jesus Christ! You got him
with a sniper rifle!

128
00:20:45,638 --> 00:20:47,014
Yeah.

129
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:29,633
- How about a game?
- I got a game.

130
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:38,640
- Can I get a beer?
- Coming up.

131
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,645
So you're going down south
towards the border.

132
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:48,148
I'm not at liberty
to discuss my mission.

133
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:51,150
How do you feel
about hanging on a charm bracelet?

134
00:21:53,694 --> 00:21:55,070
Come again?

135
00:21:55,154 --> 00:21:58,532
You better take a good look
at Master Beckett's dog tag collection.

136
00:21:58,615 --> 00:22:00,658
Got any money?

137
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:05,162
Yeah. I'll play for money.

138
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,210
I said I already got a game.

139
00:22:15,546 --> 00:22:17,839
I'm talking about holding on
to your cash...

140
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:19,924
while you're out in the jungle.

141
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:23,261
Better do it.

142
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:27,681
Those rebels can fund a whole offensive
on what they take off you.

143
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,437
I'm ready for a game now.

144
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,147
He doesn't have time for a game.

145
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,650
GS-9 Miller?

146
00:22:56,747 --> 00:22:58,623
A lot of attitude around here.

147
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:01,959
Welcome to "Marine World."
Those people thought you were a sniper.

148
00:23:02,043 --> 00:23:03,878
It's an outcast profession.

149
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:06,964
They always go out in platoon strength.

150
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:10,884
We go out in pairs, sometimes alone.

151
00:23:11,843 --> 00:23:14,053
Their idea of combat
is tearing up the countryside...

152
00:23:14,095 --> 00:23:17,764
with heavy artillery
and millions of rounds.

153
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:20,767
We'll wait days for one shot, one kill.

154
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,356
Well, I guess it's a different
version of war.

155
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,234
There's a lot of them
and just a few of us.

156
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:34,028
What's that?

157
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:37,281
Sometimes these shells
get nicks and burs on them.

158
00:23:37,364 --> 00:23:40,533
This little son of a bitch
will take your head of at 1,000 yards.

159
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:45,996
Have you had a chance to look over
our operations plan?

160
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:50,417
Yeah, I have,
but I wanna study it a little more.

161
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,502
All right. Forget the specifics.
How about an overview?

162
00:23:53,544 --> 00:23:55,337
We'll get to that later.

163
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:57,714
I have a few things I have to do.

164
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:02,760
See you at 5- 0500.

165
00:24:02,844 --> 00:24:04,637
Having had.

166
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:06,221
Having had what?

167
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:07,973
Breakfast.

168
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:18,356
This is Corporal Papich's gillie suit.

169
00:24:45,963 --> 00:24:49,591
Is that our ride?

170
00:24:49,674 --> 00:24:51,759
No. That's our ride.

171
00:24:53,344 --> 00:24:56,221
I thought this was a deep jungle
insertion. Don't we do that by chopper?

172
00:24:56,305 --> 00:24:58,432
Yeah, that's the usual S.O.P.

173
00:24:58,515 --> 00:25:01,017
But those asshole rotor heads
at battalion-

174
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,269
they fucked with me
one time too many.

175
00:25:03,311 --> 00:25:05,187
We're gonna have to walk it in.

176
00:25:23,994 --> 00:25:25,329
My fiancée.

177
00:25:28,957 --> 00:25:30,500
You married?

178
00:25:45,888 --> 00:25:48,557
What's that?

179
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:51,476
Got it out of the catalogue
when I was with D.C. SWAT.

180
00:25:52,393 --> 00:25:53,894
We called it "Gucciflage"

181
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:58,523
- You gonna wear that?
- Yeah.

182
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:00,191
Let me see it.

183
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,748
- Nice shot!
- No room for Peter Pan on this hunt.

184
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:21,042
You wear Corporal Papich's tree togs
that I gave you.

185
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:31,301
What the hell are those for?

186
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:34,470
Respect.

187
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:09,666
Still think a chopper insertion would
have made a hell of a lot more sense.

188
00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:13,502
By the way, that was a hell of a shot
you made from a chopper.

189
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:19,883
That's the sort of thing
myths are made of.

190
00:27:19,966 --> 00:27:21,759
Yeah, it was pretty unreal.

191
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:24,178
Yeah.

192
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:34,228
Roll down your sleeves, Miller.
We're going in the bush.

193
00:28:19,015 --> 00:28:20,892
What?

194
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:22,393
What- I miss a spot?

195
00:28:24,145 --> 00:28:26,355
Come on. On your feet.

196
00:28:54,336 --> 00:28:56,380
I had a lot of SWAT training,
all right?

197
00:28:56,463 --> 00:28:59,883
Urban anti-terrorist tactics.
I've never actually done a creep.

198
00:29:01,342 --> 00:29:03,052
The army ever put you in the jungle?

199
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:08,723
If you call deepest, darkest
North Carolina a jungle, yeah.

200
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:11,768
You wanna survive this, right?

201
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,270
You want an answer to that?

202
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,939
Then if you do as I tell you,
to the letter-

203
00:29:18,065 --> 00:29:20,650
- I think you got a chance.
- Whoa! Hold on!

204
00:29:21,651 --> 00:29:24,320
You may have more experience than I do,
but with all due respect, gunny...

205
00:29:24,403 --> 00:29:25,779
this mission is N.S.C.

206
00:29:25,863 --> 00:29:28,782
Meaning I still have rank,
whether you see it or not.

207
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:31,909
Sorry, but I don't have to take orders
from you.

208
00:29:31,993 --> 00:29:33,119
Fair enough.

209
00:29:34,412 --> 00:29:36,455
You want to take point?

210
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,085
You're doing fine.

211
00:30:14,403 --> 00:30:16,030
I got it.

212
00:30:16,071 --> 00:30:18,448
- You sure?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

213
00:30:32,085 --> 00:30:34,378
Oh, fuck!

214
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,924
Goddamn it!

215
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,760
- You all right, son?
- Yeah.

216
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:45,304
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey!

217
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,723
Relax. You did okay.

218
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:50,767
Thanks. You mean, there's a wrong way
to fall down a fucking mountain?

219
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,103
Your weapon, Miller!
It's your life!

220
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,939
You knew that, and you saved it.

221
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,902
You're learning, son.

222
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:16,538
Our drop point from the railway
was east.

223
00:31:16,622 --> 00:31:19,249
- Now, we're heading west here.
- I know that.

224
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:22,376
That's not the plan.

225
00:31:22,418 --> 00:31:25,004
- The plan was no good.
- Now, what?

226
00:31:29,424 --> 00:31:30,884
We're changing directions.

227
00:31:30,925 --> 00:31:34,303
Okay. I was given
very specific orders...

228
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:36,513
by the staff at the N.S.C.

229
00:31:36,597 --> 00:31:40,350
First it indicated a chopper insertion,
which we won't get into.

230
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:44,103
But then we were supposed to head east,
you know? Due east?

231
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:46,980
You think Washington knows
the best way to get through this jungle?

232
00:31:48,023 --> 00:31:51,359
You think they know which streams are
flooded, which trails are booby-trapped?

233
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,653
What I know about this place, son...

234
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:55,529
is because I'm here.

235
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,036
Changing directions.

236
00:32:05,287 --> 00:32:07,581
Good. North.

237
00:32:13,044 --> 00:32:15,212
Holy shit.

238
00:32:15,254 --> 00:32:17,464
What the hell is that?

239
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,812
"Hotel Europa."

240
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,273
What kind of wacko builds a hotel
in the jungle?

241
00:32:56,997 --> 00:32:58,874
Sure is a hell of a lucky break for us.

242
00:33:06,296 --> 00:33:08,882
I got ammo and he's laughing?

243
00:33:10,884 --> 00:33:12,593
Ease up, young agent.

244
00:33:12,635 --> 00:33:14,970
They've been with us
since we left the train.

245
00:33:15,012 --> 00:33:18,432
If you drop the hammer on him, we'll be
dead before we can take ten steps.

246
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:45,496
He wants my eyes?

247
00:33:47,664 --> 00:33:50,542
He means ante ojos.

248
00:33:51,584 --> 00:33:53,336
Your shooting glasses.

249
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:55,004
Give them to him.

250
00:33:55,045 --> 00:33:56,922
- Why?
- Because he likes them.

251
00:33:56,964 --> 00:33:59,132
Fuck him!

252
00:33:59,216 --> 00:34:00,717
Fuck me.

253
00:34:02,385 --> 00:34:06,680
This area's swarming with rebel patrols.
These Indians can help us avoid them.

254
00:34:06,722 --> 00:34:08,181
Give him the glasses.

255
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,186
May you go blind.

256
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:38,748
Following these Indians
is fucking crazy.

257
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,001
- Their agenda works with ours.
- What agenda?

258
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:44,920
Do you see Cacique's hand-
the way it's cut up?

259
00:34:45,004 --> 00:34:47,881
The animal who did that
is el Cirujano.

260
00:34:47,964 --> 00:34:51,009
The Surgeon. He's headed this way,
and we're gonna take him out.

261
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,344
In return, they'll lead us
passed the rebel patrols.

262
00:34:53,386 --> 00:34:55,262
We'll cut off hours on our time
to Sangre.

263
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:58,181
Our mission isn't about assassinating
people for Indians!

264
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:00,809
El Cirujano's listed
as a target of opportunity.

265
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:03,185
That means, we see him,
we take him out.

266
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:05,312
Listed where?
It's not in my orders, man.

267
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:08,398
El Cirujano's gonna be at this
river up ahead, and Miller-

268
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,567
You're the designated hitter on this.
So batter up.

269
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,277
Hold on a second now!
I'm not buying into this.

270
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,655
And I don't buy that you shot a man
from a moving helicopter.

271
00:35:17,614 --> 00:35:19,491
It's got nothing to do with anything!

272
00:35:19,574 --> 00:35:22,660
You're gonna look Cirujano in the eyes
and put a bullet through his heart...

273
00:35:22,702 --> 00:35:25,287
because until I see you kill a man
you're a liability to this mission!

274
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:27,414
That's not my purpose here!

275
00:35:27,497 --> 00:35:30,542
Maybe, but when we get to Alvarez's
hacienda there's gonna be two targets!

276
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:33,586
- Now, what?
- That's right.

277
00:35:33,669 --> 00:35:35,754
Intelligence changes all the time.

278
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:39,257
Alvarez is setting up a meeting
with a man called Raoul Ochoa.

279
00:35:39,299 --> 00:35:41,718
He's a Colombian drug lord
that's financing the rebels.

280
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:45,846
- We got a chance to get them both.
- Where does this information come from?

281
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:47,848
Any new intelligence
has to come through me!

282
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:49,516
A local contact- Father Ruiz.

283
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,684
He's a priest in the village of Sangre.

284
00:35:51,768 --> 00:35:54,353
They'll give us specifics on the meeting
when we get there.

285
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:11,284
Wind coming off the water at 3:00.

286
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:13,619
One click right.

287
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,122
Make that two clicks.

288
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:29,424
Which one is he?
I can't tell who he is.

289
00:36:30,425 --> 00:36:33,261
He's the baseball fan.

290
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:35,846
He's a fucking American!

291
00:36:35,888 --> 00:36:38,223
He's a fucking spook.
Ex-CIA.

292
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:40,225
I met him once up in El Salvador.

293
00:36:41,392 --> 00:36:43,811
Now he's an enforcer
for the cocaine monkeys.

294
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:45,562
I'll take out the lieutenant.

295
00:36:45,646 --> 00:36:48,273
You concentrate on him.

296
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:51,567
Now put a fucking bullet
through his heart!

297
00:36:55,696 --> 00:36:57,656
Do it! Feel the rush!

298
00:37:19,174 --> 00:37:20,550
Breathe.

299
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:35,354
Nail that motherfucker now!

300
00:38:10,216 --> 00:38:12,051
What the hell did you just do, sniper?

301
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:15,429
I just wanted to show you
that I owned that situation.

302
00:38:15,512 --> 00:38:18,640
Bullshit! You fired a spoiler.

303
00:38:18,723 --> 00:38:20,809
You saw him go down.
He's dead!

304
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:22,643
I didn't see shit!
I didn't see him hit!

305
00:38:22,685 --> 00:38:24,770
For Christ sake! You gave him
a warning shot!

306
00:38:24,854 --> 00:38:26,313
I hit him!

307
00:38:26,396 --> 00:38:28,315
I had him in my sights,
no doubt about it.

308
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:31,651
You'd better be right.

309
00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:34,445
From now on...

310
00:38:34,487 --> 00:38:36,822
one shot, one kill.

311
00:38:36,864 --> 00:38:39,658
No exceptions. Do you understand?

312
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,188
What? Now they blame us for this?

313
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,779
But they sure as hell
ain't gonna help us.

314
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:52,894
Patrols.

315
00:41:35,471 --> 00:41:37,389
You really get off on this shit,
don't you?

316
00:41:38,515 --> 00:41:40,975
It's just a job.
I don't think about it much.

317
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:42,977
So that's the secret:
not thinking.

318
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:49,566
What are you doing here?

319
00:41:49,649 --> 00:41:52,151
This assignment was supposed to be
a piece of cake.

320
00:41:52,235 --> 00:41:55,070
You're in, you're out. You go back home.
You reap the rewards.

321
00:41:55,154 --> 00:41:57,072
Washington brass loves this shit.

322
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:01,034
They never said anything about
a goddamn jungle creep, that's for sure.

323
00:42:01,075 --> 00:42:03,452
Yeah, well. Those guys wouldn't.

324
00:42:03,536 --> 00:42:05,746
It seems so far away.

325
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,332
- What?
- My life.

326
00:42:12,085 --> 00:42:15,546
I read your dossier before I came.
You had 74 confirmed kills.

327
00:42:17,381 --> 00:42:19,132
It's not about numbers.

328
00:42:19,216 --> 00:42:22,552
The only one that really mattered
was the first one.

329
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:24,470
That was the toughest one
for you, right?

330
00:42:25,512 --> 00:42:27,014
First one?

331
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:29,391
Yeah.

332
00:42:31,184 --> 00:42:33,894
Seventy-four, that's...

333
00:42:33,936 --> 00:42:35,813
a lot of faces to carry around.

334
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:39,733
Yeah, well.

335
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:42,276
You put them in the back of your mind...

336
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:44,987
and you just keep on going.

337
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,489
Until they decide
not to stay in the back of your mind.

338
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,659
You may find this hard to believe...

339
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:54,328
but I'd take a nice office
on the Hill over this shit any day.

340
00:42:54,412 --> 00:42:57,164
Sitting in an office,
giving other men orders to kill...

341
00:42:57,206 --> 00:42:59,624
ain't no different than putting
a bullet in a man's heart.

342
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:02,502
Let me tell you something.

343
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:05,296
It's the same goddamn thing.

344
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:13,552
- You hear that?
- An AK.

345
00:43:14,637 --> 00:43:17,139
- I know that hammer recoil.
- Yeah.

346
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:19,724
And I think I know
who that single shot is.

347
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:20,975
He's behind us.

348
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,998
Who is this guy?

349
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:50,166
I think he's the guy
that killed Papich.

350
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,793
It ain't the first time
he's been on my trail.

351
00:43:52,835 --> 00:43:56,338
He's a Panamanian I trained.

352
00:43:56,422 --> 00:43:58,673
His name's DeSilva.

353
00:43:58,715 --> 00:44:00,592
Now he's a fucking mercenary.

354
00:44:20,984 --> 00:44:22,902
This is ridiculous. I can't sleep here.

355
00:44:23,986 --> 00:44:25,821
It's a good spot.

356
00:44:25,904 --> 00:44:30,033
Stagnant. Liver flukes,
leaches, malaria.

357
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:32,952
He'd never think anybody'd be
stupid enough to hide here.

358
00:44:32,994 --> 00:44:35,371
Except us.

359
00:44:35,454 --> 00:44:38,623
Just take your horse pill.

360
00:44:38,707 --> 00:44:40,291
And don't take a piss.

361
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:43,002
Bugs will swarm
right up through your dick.

362
00:44:43,085 --> 00:44:44,962
Good night.

363
00:45:32,793 --> 00:45:34,378
Tough, huh?

364
00:45:44,512 --> 00:45:47,848
He's there, and he's out of range,
damn it!

365
00:45:47,931 --> 00:45:50,433
I'm looking right at the ridge
that we came over.

366
00:45:50,517 --> 00:45:52,268
I don't see a damn thing.

367
00:45:52,351 --> 00:45:55,104
That's because he's smarter than you.
Come over here.

368
00:46:06,488 --> 00:46:09,282
Glance down to the bottom of the finger.

369
00:46:10,241 --> 00:46:12,493
Sweep up to your left
at 11:00.

370
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:14,829
- Halfway.
- Got him.

371
00:46:16,413 --> 00:46:18,415
Heading west.

372
00:46:18,498 --> 00:46:20,125
Lost us.

373
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:23,169
Wrong. He's just doing
what he was trained to do.

374
00:46:25,671 --> 00:46:28,381
He's circling our flank,
coming around us.

375
00:46:28,423 --> 00:46:30,133
Gaining some ground.

376
00:46:31,092 --> 00:46:33,261
He'll be waiting for us somewhere.

377
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:38,890
He'll know exactly where we are.

378
00:46:38,974 --> 00:46:41,267
We have to take him out.

379
00:46:58,031 --> 00:46:59,699
Taking a break?

380
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:11,334
Makes it sensitive.

381
00:47:11,376 --> 00:47:13,294
Marries my finger to the trigger-break.

382
00:47:13,336 --> 00:47:15,713
What are you gonna do, a pedicure next?

383
00:47:18,298 --> 00:47:20,967
I guess some men are born to this work
and others aren't.

384
00:47:22,635 --> 00:47:24,595
It may be your career choice
but it ain't mine.

385
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:28,306
This career chooses the man.
Ain't the other way around.

386
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,225
Well, like I said-

387
00:47:30,308 --> 00:47:33,144
- I have other plans.
- Yeah?

388
00:47:33,227 --> 00:47:35,813
I had plans. Still do.

389
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:43,694
- What is it?
- I'm working on something back home.

390
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,531
Where are you from?

391
00:47:47,572 --> 00:47:50,408
Montana. Boseman.

392
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,076
No shit? I went to university there.

393
00:47:55,704 --> 00:47:58,415
Miller, don't jerk me off.
I'm not in the mood.

394
00:47:58,457 --> 00:48:01,334
I'm not. Freshman and sophomore year.

395
00:48:01,376 --> 00:48:03,252
I would have stayed longer
but skiing killed my grades.

396
00:48:06,255 --> 00:48:08,590
I'll be damned.

397
00:48:10,967 --> 00:48:13,511
You wouldn't happen to know
a little town called Livingston?

398
00:48:13,552 --> 00:48:14,762
Sure.

399
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:19,307
Well...

400
00:48:19,391 --> 00:48:22,685
there's a stream nearby,
up in the hills.

401
00:48:22,768 --> 00:48:25,604
It's, I don't know. What- three clicks
east of the interstate.

402
00:48:25,646 --> 00:48:30,733
If you follow that,
you come to this rock basin.

403
00:48:30,817 --> 00:48:33,486
Like a quarry pit, but not as deep.

404
00:48:33,527 --> 00:48:35,195
I found that when I was a kid.

405
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:38,740
Anyway, it's fed by
a tributary of the Madison.

406
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:41,618
And it's the best damned
steelhead fishing in the world.

407
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:44,078
I plan to go back there and-

408
00:48:45,496 --> 00:48:47,998
I don't know.
Start a little fishing camp.

409
00:48:48,081 --> 00:48:50,458
Guide operation. Whatever.

410
00:48:51,417 --> 00:48:53,127
When's the last time you were there?

411
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:57,297
Couple years ago.

412
00:48:58,548 --> 00:49:00,467
Damn it- "couple years ago."

413
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:02,385
That whole area was leveled
seven years ago!

414
00:49:02,468 --> 00:49:04,970
They got a high school there now!
Your pond is buried.

415
00:49:05,012 --> 00:49:06,430
It's a tennis court!

416
00:49:10,809 --> 00:49:12,560
We're not talking about the same place.

417
00:49:13,769 --> 00:49:16,647
You know we are,
whether you admit it or not.

418
00:49:18,106 --> 00:49:20,150
Killing's all you got, isn't it?

419
00:49:47,631 --> 00:49:49,466
What is it?

420
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:11,901
Something's wrong here.

421
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,643
God.

422
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,064
What kind of-

423
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:49,983
Who would do something like that?

424
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:55,446
I'd say the man you had
dead in your sights did this.

425
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,656
You don't know it was el Cirujano.

426
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,992
Probably Alvarez's men. They probably
found out what the priest was doing.

427
00:52:01,075 --> 00:52:04,578
He must have told them everything.
They're going to be waiting for us.

428
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,413
Maybe.

429
00:52:06,497 --> 00:52:09,708
But if he told them everything,
why didn't they hit us here?

430
00:52:28,682 --> 00:52:30,683
The hacienda's only three clicks away.

431
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:33,978
We should make our shots easy at dawn.

432
00:52:34,061 --> 00:52:36,105
What? This mission is over.

433
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:40,733
Our contact is dead! All we do now
is get the hell out of here!

434
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:43,569
I've never turned back on a mission
in my life, and I ain't gonna start now.

435
00:52:43,653 --> 00:52:46,864
Such gung-ho bullshit! Without the
specifics, it's a suicide mission!

436
00:52:46,947 --> 00:52:50,783
They all are! I wouldn't be out here
unless I was ready to die!

437
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,869
We've got our location.
We've got our targets.

438
00:52:52,952 --> 00:52:56,580
- And we got a time frame!
- You're out of your fucking mind!

439
00:52:56,622 --> 00:52:58,498
I'm not going!

440
00:53:07,964 --> 00:53:10,967
I've had enough of your mewling!
Shut your fucking mouth!

441
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,844
- I'm not going with you!
- The hell your aren't!

442
00:53:12,927 --> 00:53:14,345
You have no choice!

443
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:19,307
- It'll never work.
- We're going where they won't expect us.

444
00:53:56,839 --> 00:53:59,883
Jar head. Fucking flag-top lifer.

445
00:54:36,455 --> 00:54:38,915
We camp here.

446
00:54:38,999 --> 00:54:42,043
We'll make our final approach
to the hacienda at dawn.

447
00:54:42,126 --> 00:54:43,961
Wait a minute, okay?

448
00:54:44,045 --> 00:54:47,172
Now, at the village you said we were
three clicks away from the hacienda.

449
00:54:47,256 --> 00:54:50,341
That is three clicks.
We've been walking for miles.

450
00:54:50,425 --> 00:54:53,219
We don't walk in straight lines.

451
00:54:53,302 --> 00:54:55,929
Get some sleep.
I'll take the first watch.

452
00:54:56,805 --> 00:54:58,932
Move out at 0400.

453
00:55:01,142 --> 00:55:02,935
You sleep here.

454
00:58:18,765 --> 00:58:21,184
Son of a bitch! You used me as bait?

455
00:58:23,978 --> 00:58:25,896
You were never really in any danger.

456
00:58:54,587 --> 00:58:56,463
We're about 100 yards out.

457
00:58:56,505 --> 00:58:59,216
This is our rendezvous point.

458
00:58:59,299 --> 00:59:01,759
If I don't show, you cross country
to the nearest river...

459
00:59:01,801 --> 00:59:03,678
follow it downstream to the coast.

460
00:59:03,761 --> 00:59:04,887
Whatever.

461
00:59:27,281 --> 00:59:29,574
Hacienda, 12:00.

462
00:59:32,243 --> 00:59:33,953
The most logical position would be...

463
00:59:34,036 --> 00:59:37,914
to take our shots from that tree line
over there.

464
00:59:37,998 --> 00:59:40,375
But they're going to be expecting that.

465
00:59:40,458 --> 00:59:43,878
So somehow, we gotta get in the clear
to make our shots.

466
00:59:44,753 --> 00:59:46,630
When Ochoa arrives...

467
00:59:46,713 --> 00:59:50,175
I figure we got ten seconds
after they greet...

468
00:59:50,258 --> 00:59:51,843
and then we drop them.

469
00:59:51,926 --> 00:59:54,053
Then we gotta fire
our shots simultaneously...

470
00:59:54,095 --> 00:59:56,722
or they're gonna vector in
on our positions.

471
00:59:59,891 --> 01:00:02,226
Here's Ochoa. He's yours.

472
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:17,531
There's a clear shot from that
metal utility shed. You got coverage.

473
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,324
That's your position.

474
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,784
I'll be on the other side
of the village.

475
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,036
We'll both be...

476
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,621
thousand yards out.

477
01:00:27,372 --> 01:00:29,207
You listening, Miller?

478
01:00:32,126 --> 01:00:33,502
Get below.

479
01:00:46,472 --> 01:00:49,307
There better not be any doubt
about your shot this time.

480
01:00:49,391 --> 01:00:51,643
One shot. One kill.

481
01:00:51,684 --> 01:00:54,478
This ain't a fucking game out here!

482
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:58,023
- You blow it, and I'll tear-
- You'll what?

483
01:00:58,106 --> 01:01:00,984
You'll kill me?
Come on. Say it, Beckett.

484
01:01:01,025 --> 01:01:02,777
You just get it right.

485
01:02:50,116 --> 01:02:52,535
Son of a bitch!

486
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:32,318
You lying bastard!

487
01:03:45,704 --> 01:03:47,748
Fucking truck's blocking my shot.

488
01:04:20,483 --> 01:04:22,193
What are you doing?

489
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:02,752
Where is he?

490
01:08:12,677 --> 01:08:14,470
Oh, shit, Miller!

491
01:08:18,056 --> 01:08:20,100
You're out in the open!

492
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:32,819
Fuck.

493
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:40,325
Shit! Miller, someone's seen you.

494
01:08:55,087 --> 01:08:57,547
What are you doing?

495
01:09:31,075 --> 01:09:33,411
Alvarez.

496
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,170
Ochoa.

497
01:09:52,176 --> 01:09:53,594
Ten...

498
01:09:53,678 --> 01:09:55,054
nine...

499
01:09:55,137 --> 01:09:58,223
eight, seven-

500
01:10:04,395 --> 01:10:05,521
Lady, move!

501
01:10:08,523 --> 01:10:10,442
One.

502
01:10:12,777 --> 01:10:15,070
One, Beckett! One!

503
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:30,525
Oh, shit.

504
01:13:45,663 --> 01:13:47,414
- Did you get Ochoa?
- Yes, I got Ochoa.

505
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:49,291
What happened to you?
What were you doing in that barn?

506
01:13:49,374 --> 01:13:52,835
It doesn't matter. We gotta try and get
back and try and hit Alvarez after dark.

507
01:13:52,877 --> 01:13:57,005
What, another shot? Are you crazy?
I got my kill. I'm out of this mission!

508
01:13:57,089 --> 01:13:59,466
- There's still two targets left-
- You're the one who fucked up.

509
01:13:59,549 --> 01:14:02,176
You son of a bitch.
He had the drop on you.

510
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:04,553
He had you in his crosshairs,
and I took him out.

511
01:14:04,637 --> 01:14:07,306
Fuck you! I'm not ending up
on your fucking key chain, Beckett.

512
01:16:21,084 --> 01:16:23,127
Give it up, Miller!

513
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:37,514
You're losing it!
Pull it together.

514
01:16:53,527 --> 01:16:55,279
Beautiful.

515
01:18:19,516 --> 01:18:22,768
Miller, it's over.

516
01:18:22,852 --> 01:18:25,813
I'm out of bullets.
Do it.

517
01:18:29,149 --> 01:18:31,484
So come on and shoot me already.

518
01:18:32,527 --> 01:18:34,361
You feel the rush?

519
01:18:36,155 --> 01:18:38,240
I felt it.

520
01:18:38,323 --> 01:18:40,575
I felt it when I had you
in my crosshairs.

521
01:18:40,658 --> 01:18:42,326
After you pull the trigger...

522
01:18:43,911 --> 01:18:46,455
when the rush is over...

523
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:52,251
it hurts, doesn't it?

524
01:18:53,294 --> 01:18:56,130
The hurt you're feeling now
ain't the worst pain.

525
01:18:58,256 --> 01:19:00,133
The worst thing...

526
01:19:02,468 --> 01:19:04,512
is not feeling the hurt anymore.

527
01:19:07,097 --> 01:19:08,932
You'll get past this.

528
01:19:10,433 --> 01:19:12,310
You'll get by.

529
01:19:14,145 --> 01:19:16,563
Hey...

530
01:19:16,647 --> 01:19:18,940
you can still go home.

531
01:19:33,077 --> 01:19:34,954
Get out of here.
I'll cover you.

532
01:19:43,502 --> 01:19:47,047
Son, I'm getting you out of here.
Now go.

533
01:19:53,386 --> 01:19:56,346
I'II be right behind you.
Move it!

534
01:22:50,366 --> 01:22:51,951
Tell me who you are.

535
01:22:55,287 --> 01:22:56,872
Lee Harvey Oswald.

536
01:23:04,962 --> 01:23:06,630
We've been looking for you.

537
01:23:11,134 --> 01:23:13,386
You've hurt our cause.

538
01:23:13,469 --> 01:23:15,596
Fuck you and fuck your cause.

539
01:23:23,644 --> 01:23:28,106
Well, all things come to he who waits.
Right, Beckett?

540
01:23:31,234 --> 01:23:32,944
Long time no see.

541
01:23:32,985 --> 01:23:34,862
See if there's any others.

542
01:23:36,405 --> 01:23:39,532
Beckett and I are gonna have a long
talk. We'll hear about everything.

543
01:24:02,927 --> 01:24:04,887
Everyone back to the hacienda.

544
01:24:16,355 --> 01:24:18,106
Feel the trigger, sniper.

545
01:24:19,274 --> 01:24:20,859
It'll be the last time.

546
01:24:39,582 --> 01:24:41,209
Where'd you leave your partner?

547
01:24:54,595 --> 01:24:58,723
Now, you targeted Ochoa,
a Colombian civilian.

548
01:24:58,807 --> 01:25:01,517
Is the U.S. military now moving
against the Colombian cartel?

549
01:25:16,071 --> 01:25:20,366
Thomas Beckett,
master gunnery sergeant...

550
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:23,286
United States Marine Corps.

551
01:25:36,588 --> 01:25:38,715
I like your dedication, Beckett.

552
01:25:40,383 --> 01:25:41,884
It's a challenge.

553
01:27:05,079 --> 01:27:07,789
Wake up!
Don't die on me yet, Beckett.

554
01:27:07,873 --> 01:27:10,041
I'm just starting to have fun.

555
01:27:31,601 --> 01:27:32,768
Wait.

556
01:27:35,813 --> 01:27:37,564
Wait?

557
01:27:39,733 --> 01:27:44,820
Please.
One shot, two kills.

558
01:27:44,862 --> 01:27:47,447
One shot...

559
01:27:47,531 --> 01:27:49,366
two kills.

560
01:27:50,617 --> 01:27:52,910
A man...

561
01:27:52,994 --> 01:27:54,829
in the organization-

562
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:59,207
- What?
- A man-

563
01:28:02,376 --> 01:28:04,003
What?

564
01:28:04,962 --> 01:28:07,256
Move.

565
01:28:57,714 --> 01:28:59,507
We gotta go one click.
Can you make it?

566
01:28:59,549 --> 01:29:01,801
- Yeah.
- All right.

567
01:29:01,884 --> 01:29:03,552
Let's go.

568
01:29:04,762 --> 01:29:08,140
One minute to rendezvous.
They better be there.

569
01:29:08,223 --> 01:29:10,517
Take her down.

570
01:29:31,868 --> 01:29:33,411
Beckett, go.

571
01:29:33,494 --> 01:29:37,331
- Give me that rifle, I'll cover you.
- Go on! That's an order.

572
01:30:51,142 --> 01:30:52,768
Let's go!

573
01:31:15,079 --> 01:31:17,164
There's always Montana.
