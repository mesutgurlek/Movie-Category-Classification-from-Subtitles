David, isn't it?

- Yes, sir. I wonder if I could
have a word with you.

142
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,937
- By all means. Come on in.
- No, sir...

I'd like to introduce you
to David, uh...

00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,523
Good Lord, I've forgotten
your last name.

- It's Mann, sir.
- David Mann.

- I'm very honored to meet you.

149
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,397
- It appears that young David

has conceived of a passion
for my daughter.

151

- Daddy, please!
- A passion, is it?

152
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,428
Well, then I'd be guessing
you'd still be a student.

153
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,938
- And you'd be wide of the mark.

154
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,737
David here counts himself among
the ranks of the working men.

155
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,938
- I work for a newspaper.
- But he's not a scribe.

156
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,277
He sets type.
He's a typesetter.

157
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:47,877
- But you must be 18 years old and
you're not in uniform. Why is that?

158
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,421
- It's a medical thing, sir.
He's doing what he can.

159
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,684
- Yes, well, he'll have
to do better than that

160
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,783
if he wants to earn
the respect of your father.

161
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,887
- That's what I intend to do, sir,
and I'm open to suggestions.

162
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,694
- For God's sake, son.
We're at war.

163
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,860
Use your imagination.

164
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,811
- I'm sorry.
[Clearing his throat]

165
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,347
I don't know, I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to say.

166
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,851
- There's no formula here,
Sergeant. We're just talking.

167
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,051
You, uh, want to tell me
about your nightmares?

168
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,391
They consistently feature

169
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,327
the image of a Canadian
soldier and a cross.

170
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,832
Why is that, you imagine?

171
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,362
- I don't sleep, so I don't really
know how to answer that.

172
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,974
- In 1915, in retreat outside Ypres,

173
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,374
German soldiers nailed
a Canadian N.C.O. to a barn door.

174
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,503
You were there,
were you not?

175
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,878
- Yes sir, I did take part
in that retreat but...

176
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,976
if they had time to stop
and nail a guy to a door

177
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,251
they're even better than
I already know them to be.

178
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,521
- Are you saying it didn't happen?
- I'm saying artillery throws soldiers

179
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,652
into positions
you can't even imagine.

180
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,027
A man in a trench...

181
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,957
he's gonna see
what he needs to see.

182
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,668
- Michael, you are
a decorated soldier...

183
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,107
- Yeah. Yeah, I am.

184
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,639
And I received that medal

185
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,649
for sticking a 17-inch piece
of steel into a boy's forehead.

186
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,514
- As soon as you were well
enough to walk, you went AWOL.

187
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,576
- I went AWOL because
I received a medal

188
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,713
for sticking a piece of steel
into a boy's forehead!

189
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:31,915
- This is insubordinate.

190
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,982
- Understand your situation here,
Sergeant.

191
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,857
We are trying to determine
your status of discharge.

192
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,363
Your physical wounds have,
for the most part, healed.

193
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:43,162
Dr. Walker would like to give you
a clean bill of health, in which case

194
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,362
you'd be sent back
to the battlefield,

195
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:49,066
stand trial for desertion and
more than likely be executed.

196
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,406
- I'm going to end up back
there one way or another.

197
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,876
- Michael,

198
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,848
I'm trying to save your life.

199
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,884
- I know that.

200
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,386
And I appreciate it,
I do, but this...

201
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,821
- Go on.

202
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,857
- The house...
we grew up in...

203
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,529
it was at the bottom of this hill,

204
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,231
and every time
one of my brothers, uh...

205
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,933
- Died?
- Yeah.

206
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:30,542
- The telegraph guy, he'd bring
the notification down the hill

207
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,811
and my mother never got
any other news.

208
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,189
After all, three of my younger
brothers -one, two, three and me-

209
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,020
AWOL...

210
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,189
And they don't say
"Absent without leave."

211
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:48,461
They say "Missing in action,"
which to her meant I was dead.

212
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,199
So when that telegraph guy
came down the fourth time,

213
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,542
it broke her heart.

214
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,204
She... she died
of a broken heart.

215
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,819
- Nurse Mann, please escort
the sergeant back to the ward.

216
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:26,133
- Major Nigel Bernard,
Canadian Army Medical Corps,

217
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,868
re: patient T-331,
Sergeant Michael Dunne.

218
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,410
Physically the patient nears repair.

219
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:36,175
Diagnosis remains
however neurasthenia,

220
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,478
Dr. Walker's dissent noted.

221
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,314
In light of his service record,
the recommendation

222
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,446
is that the soldier be
reassigned to the home front,

223
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,458
possibly in recruitment,
in support of our ongoing effort.

224
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,936
- I came to wish you luck.

225
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,407
- It's not likely
I'll see you again, is it?

226
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,178
I don't want to leave.

227
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,181
No, that's...

228
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,707
That's not accurate.
I don't want to leave you.

229
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,345
- I'm not what you think I am.

230
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,480
- You don't know
what I think you are.

231
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,491
- You talk in your sleep.

232
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,459
- I don't sleep.
How can I talk?

233
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,224
- You don't even
know my first name.

234
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,630
- No, I don't. No.

235
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,635
And that's a hell of a thing, that is.

236
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,543
Good-bye, Nurse Mann.
- Bye.

237
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,385
- It's Sarah.
- What?

238
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,387
[Whispering]: Her name...

239
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,423
is Sarah.

240
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,516
- Thanks.

241
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,360
[Background chatter]

242
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,198
- Rigor, Sergeant.
Rigor is our shibboleth.

243
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,068
No slight intended to
my immediate predecessor,

244
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,472
but the sails
on this ship are slack.

245
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,943
The home front is awash
in saboteurs and provocateurs.

246
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,209
Odd those words
sound French, what?

247
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,341
Allies and all.

248
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,478
Be that as it may, our immediate
concern is recruitment.

249
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,081
Minimum age 18. Infantry,
Service and Medical Corps:

250
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,252
minimum height 5 foot 3 inches,
chest 33 and one half inches.

251
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,523
Gunners - Carmichael,
remove this.

252
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,565
- Ah, yes sir!

253
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,397
Capital asset,
Carmichael.

254
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,133
Gunners: minimum height
5 foot 7 inches,

255
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,267
chest 34 and one half inches
- give or take, you understand.

256
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,539
Preference given
to unmarried men.

257
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,979
The blind and the deaf
are to be avoided,

258
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,243
and asthmatics are
strictly <i>ne touche pas,</i>

259
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,842
given the problems
associated with gas.

260
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,287
And on that note,
may I say, in confidence...

261
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,124
I have seen acts
of depravity, Dunne.

262
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,663
Kroonstad.

263
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,325
Human depravity.

264
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,063
But gas? Even the Boer
would not sink so low.

265
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,196
- We use gas, sir.

266
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,400
- Of course we do.

267
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,236
Cut from the same cloth,
you and I.

268
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,406
A rarefying experience, combat.

269
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,848
Something Carmichael
will never encounter.

270
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,408
Blind as a bat,
feet like a fried egg.

271
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,921
Isn't that right, Carmichael?
- More than right, sir.

272
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:31,978
[Chuckling]

273
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,116
- You saw action
in South Africa, sir?

274
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,363
- I've studied your dossier, Sergeant.

275
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,799
But you can rest easy.

276
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,666
I have my eye on you.

277
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,069
[Soft music]

278
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,172
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you

279
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,936
a Distinguished Conduct Medal
winner,

280
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,342
a proud member of Calgary's
own 10th Battalion,

281
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:30,347
Second Brigade,
First Canadian Division.

282
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,406
Please rise
for Sergeant Michael Dunne!

283
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,678
[Applause]

284
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:42,389
- I thought he'd be bigger.
- In what sense?

285
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,396
- In the sense that he'd be bigger.
- Please, please.

286
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,432
You're embarrassing
the good sergeant.

287
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,730
Would all of those women who are
present please resume your seats?

288
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,140
Thank you.

289
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,143
And all those men
too old to serve,

290
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,475
would you also
resume your seats?

291
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,985
And all the boys who are
not yet of age to serve,

292
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,850
would you take
your seats as well?

293
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:20,086
And now, I ask you
to look at the men

294
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,962
who stand amongst you...

295
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,763
and explain to Sergeant Dunne

296
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,936
why they are not doing
their part for their King,

297
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,310
their country and their God!

298
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,619
[Explosions and gunfire]
- Kamerad.

299
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,492
Eyes wide open.

300
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,068
[Background chatter]

301
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,004
- Next.

302
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,310
Name?
- David Mann.

303
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,943
- What's your marital status, David?

304
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,247
- Single.
- And you're of legal age?

305
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,913
- Look, I applied before.
- Yeah, I see that.

306
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,114
And according to this form,

307
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,817
you were rejected
because you have asthma.

308
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,984
Do you now have medical
clearance on that asthma?

309
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,493
- I wouldn't be here, would I?

310
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:27,328
And this isn't Germany.
I don't carry documents with me.

311
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,196
You're in uniform,
but you aren't at the front.

312
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,700
Do you have
anything to document that?

313
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,430
- As a matter of fact I do.

314
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,405
They diagnosed me as neurasthenic,
which means 'shell shock,'

00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,907
which means
I'm mentally incompetent,

316
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,307
and this is the paper
that proves it.

317
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,814
- Haven't you ever
heard of patriotism?

318
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:54,158
- Do you have a relative who's
a nurse? A sister or something?

319
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,217
And you live out
on Stewart Avenue?

320
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,261
- Maybe.

321
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,858
- Okay, as long
as I'm sitting at this desk,

322
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,900
you will not be going to this war.

323
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,061
Next.

324
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,440
Name.

325
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:24,183
- How's that feel, war hero?
[Moaning in effort]

326
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,399
- You only got one arm.

327
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,527
- Sad, ain't it?
How 'bout we get drunk?

328
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,470
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey!
Forget about the nurse!

329
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,305
There's a gaggle of women,
all free and clear,

330
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,935
ready and willing
to hike up their skirts.

331
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,003
You want to know why?
- 'Cause you give them money.

332
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,240
- No, because I let them know

333
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,545
they are in the presence
of a real-life war hero.

334
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,881
- When did you become a hero?
- When I lost my arm.

335
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,784
- You lost your arm
in a lumber mill.

336
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,688
- The ladies don't know,
which is what I love about this war.

337
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,226
[Background chatter
and music]

338
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,626
- Joe. Got a postcard from Highway.

339
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,630
Seems like the Redskin's
back on his feet,

340
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:10,099
and by the sounds of it, he's cutting
a swath right through London.

341
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,329
- That's what I hear.
Hey, John.

342
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,962
- Michael Dunne.

343
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,269
Lord God, it's good to see you
in one piece.

344
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:20,141
- Oh, more or less.
- On the house, my friend. Your call.

345
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,442
- I'll have whatever you
got underneath the counter.

346
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,142
I'll be back in a second.

347
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,241
Hey, Royster.
- To Dunne.

348
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,951
- Well, well, well...

349
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:33,217
You two are so...
[End of music and applause]

jesusly rhetorical.

351
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,225
This man who just left,

352
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,526
this man would not allow
me to serve - and why?

353
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,467
He's been over there. He's run Fritz
through with a bayonet.

354
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,299
- Johnny, what's this kid
doing in here?

355
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,669
- Time to go, son.
- Do I smell Kraut?

356
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,437
- You calling me a Kraut, boy?
- You calling me a boy, Kraut?

357
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,172
[Laughing]
- I'm just a one-armed man.

358
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,180
What are you trying
to do here, kid?

359
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:59,045
- Mister,

360
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,517
I'm just trying
to save my soul...

361
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,850
[Moaning and screaming]

362

[Background reactions]
- Hey, leave the boy alone!

363
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,897
- Let it go, Roy.
[Dropping David to the floor]

364

[David catching
his breath and moaning]

365
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,530
- What, are you nuts?

366
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:22,402
He would have killed you.
You know that?

367
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,034
[Background reactions]

368
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,582
- You come with me.

[Dog barking
in the background]

370
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,496
- Thank you for bringing him home.
- You don't have to thank me.

371
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:58,337
It's, uh, a good excuse
to see you again.

372
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,073
- Well, thank you anyway.
- Okay.

373
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,983
Hey...

374
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,025
Do you think maybe I could
accompany you to a dance or?

375
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:19,154
- I don't dance with soldiers.
- I could lose the uniform.

376
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,324
- I don't dance
with naked soldiers.

377
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,425
- I'm trying to flirt.

378
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:28,302
- And I'm not making it easy, am I?
- No.

379
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,035
What if I asked
your father for permission?

380
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,478
- That would be difficult.

381
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,480
- He doesn't like suitors?

382
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,278
- No. My father's dead, Sergeant.

383
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,318
He was killed on Vimy Ridge.

384
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,157
- Ah, Jesus.

385
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,193
I'm sorry.

386
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,295
I'm really sorry.

387
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,024
Good night.

388
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,128
- Good night.

389

[Sad music]

390
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,940

[Sighing]

392
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,082
Lot of rum over there, I guess.

393
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,084
- Yeah, but they water it down.

394
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,211
- Plentiful though, no?

395
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,517
- If there's a show on.

396
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,523
- Battle, you mean?
- Mm-hm.

397
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,617
- Christ, that word's got a ring.

398

It's like...

399
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,525
It must be like top of the world.

400
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,638
And all the shit
these Krauts get up to!

401
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,367
They crucified
one of our guys, for God's sake!

402
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,375
- That never happened.
- Still.

403
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:14,502
- No, it's a good story.
It just never happened.

404
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:15,546
- Still...

405
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,684
You know...

406
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,380
I follow it.

407

Lot of people,

00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,388
they take it, leave it.

409
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,393
But me?

410
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,658
Every day come five o'clock
I got a paper in my hand,

00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,995
nose right to the print.

Every step you two take,
you and Highway,

I'm right there with it.

And it ain't just the liquor talking,

415
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,141
but I am.

00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:48,969
- You're what?

00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,413
- Okay, Mikey. I am.

I'm proud of you.

421
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,617
And I'll tell you something else:

422
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,160
if I didn't have this stump,

423
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,957
I'd be right between
you and Highway

424
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,657
on the firing step,
right in the middle of it.

425

you could go ride with one?

- Did you carve this?

- No.
No, it was whiskey carved that.

433
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,093
I ran a mining camp
up near Rocky Mountain House.

434
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,534
The gold ran dry about the same
time the war started up, so...

435
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,140
I figured I'd go sign up and...

436
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,141
go get killed.

437
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,939
- Can I ask you something,
Sergeant?

438
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,140
- Do you think
maybe you could call me,

439
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,080
uh, you could call me Michael?

440

- Were you at Vimy Ridge?

441
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,220
- I did attend that fight, yeah.

442

- What was it like?

- It was cold.

444

But we took that ridge and we
held it. Nobody else did that.

The British couldn't do it;
the French couldn't do it.

It was just us,
the Canadian Corps.

You should be proud
of your father.

by the way.

about anything for you.

- Tell me about this.
Paint me a picture of it.

- I'm not a painter.

- I'm not all that particular.

In this picture,
there is a river and, uh,

460

there's a horse, and there's
a man sitting that horse,

and together they ford that river.

And all these things
are in the Foothills.

463

like the back of his hand.

about this day that's different.

see, that's the thing.
