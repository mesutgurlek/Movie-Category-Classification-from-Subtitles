Well, of course, Gladys, but
don't let Horace keep you out too late.

152

Rather a dashing fellow,
young Horace Perkins, eh, Gladys?

KAY: You know, Clem, I...

155

- I'm sorry. Go ahead, dear.
- No, what were you going to say?

156
00:13:42,494 --> 00:13:47,122
Nothing important. I just wondered if you
had a nice time in town, that was all.

157
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,835
Oh, wonderful.
I shopped and shopped.

158
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:53,838
Just little things, you know.

159
00:13:58,051 --> 00:14:01,428
Oh, I had a puncture in the car today.

160
00:14:01,596 --> 00:14:03,389
Oh, no, what a shame.

161
00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:06,851
Tires are getting pretty worn
on that old bus.

162
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,895
- Clem, you know what I think?
- What?

163
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:12,898
I think you ought to buy yourself
a new tire.

164
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,483
A new tire?

165
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:17,236
Yes, it might not be a bad idea, at that.

166
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:19,864
They aren't so frightfully expensive,
are they?

167
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:24,910
- Oh, I guess we can swing it all right.
- A new tire shouldn't cost more...

168
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:28,372
...than a new hat, should it?
- A hat?

169
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,918
Well, I just said hat. I might have said
shoes or trousers or anything.

170
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:36,630
- Some more coffee, dear?
- I have some, thank you, darling.

171
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:39,758
Yeah.

172
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:43,012
That old bus. Pretty sad.

173
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:45,848
Been giving a lot of trouble lately.

174
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:48,684
- Has it? I hadn't noticed it.
- Of course you hadn't.

175
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:50,728
That's the danger with an old car.

176
00:14:50,896 --> 00:14:54,023
You don't notice anything,
then when you're doing 70 miles...

177
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,943
- Not with our car, dear.
- And that's another thing. It's too slow.

178
00:14:58,111 --> 00:15:02,448
- That car is dangerously slow.
- Clem, what have you been up to?

179
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:07,953
Come on. Get your coat and hat on.
I've got something to show you.

180
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:17,796
Smooth, isn't she?

181
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:20,382
- You all right, darling?
- Yes.

182
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:24,470
I was afraid you'd think
I'd been a bit too extravagant.

183
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:29,308
Oh, all of us are extravagant
now and then, don't you think?

184
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:32,770
Of course. It's fun. What's the use
of having a little money...

185
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:35,356
...if once in a while
you can't be reckless with it?

186

Throw is away on something
you really want.

187
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,239
Where are you going?

188
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,285
After all, what is money?

189
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:53,333
It's a token. It's the power to buy ourselves
something that'll make us happier.

190
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:55,919
You shouldn't be a slave to it, though.

191
00:15:57,672 --> 00:16:01,424
Say, what are you doing, anyway?

192
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:17,482

CLEM:
Do you?

194
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,404
I bought it today.

00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:24,656
Isn't it lovely?

196
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:26,157
CLEM:
Not bad.

197
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:28,702
I do think it does something for me,
don't you?

198
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:31,538
- Yes, it makes you look rather ridiculous.
- Clem.

199
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:34,124
Maybe it's this gown.
Doesn't quite go with it.

200
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,877
Yes, but just look at the hat itself.
And if I've had my hair done...

201
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:41,589
...it'd look different.
- Yeah, it would be a difference.

202
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:50,682
Yes, it's very pretty.

203
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,393
Good! Then I think
it was worth the money.

204
00:16:53,602 --> 00:16:58,606
- Oh, much?
- Not for people with a car like ours.

205
00:16:58,774 --> 00:17:02,360
- You're pretty clever, aren't you?
- I hope you think so, darling.

206
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:05,030
Kay, sit down here a minute.

207
00:17:05,322 --> 00:17:07,323
Let me look at you.

208
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:12,203
- You're really quite beautiful, aren't you?
- If you think so, darling.

209
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:15,999
I think you're even more beautiful
than when I married you.

210
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:19,669
- Could that be?
- I don't see why not.

211
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:22,047
I've had more reason to be.

212

Put that silly thing away
and get into bed, now.

looking at it all night.

Yes.

00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:48,865
Clem, I think we're very lucky people.

217
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,326
CLEM: Because we've got a new car
and a new hat?

Oh, much more than that.

Because of Vin and Toby and Judy...

Huh?

Guess what.

I had a rose named after me today.

Sorry. I found it took up
too much of my time.

So your interest
doesn't center on cars anymore, Vin?

Well, this last year at Oxford, I've rather
changed my outlook on things.

- You don't say.
- Yes. I think I've grown a little.

Matured in my conception
as to what life's about.

Ah.

- Do you know what Oxford taught me?
- What, dear?

253
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:13,260
- That I know nothing about anything.
- Rather a waste of time and money.

254
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:16,764
Not at all, because it's shown me
just what I want out of life.

255
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:18,641
- And what's that, Vin?
- To learn.

256
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:22,269
I want to encompass all the knowledge
I can in my brief span.

TOBY: What's "span," Vin?
- It's a bridge.

258
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,775
TOBY: A bridge?
- When I think of the amount of knowledge...

...in the world: Scientific knowledge,
philosophical, sociological...

260

...and when I realize the infinitesimal part
of this I possess, it makes me shudder.

261
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:41,121
And apart from all that, Mother, I think
I've developed a social consciousness.

Front door, Gladys.

Look, the 9th to 15th centuries,
when the lords held all the land...

00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,305
...and parceled out what they wished
to their vassals.

Look about. What have we?

269
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:04,186
As pure a feudalistic state as there ever
was in the 9th through 15th centuries.

270
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:07,606
When I think about it, I'm appalled,
genuinely appalled.

Well, show her in, Gladys.

- For the Beldon Challenge Cup?
- Yes.

299
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:42,076
- But no one ever has entered... That is...
- No...

300
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:45,829
...no one has ever entered a rose
in competition with my grandmother.

301
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,456
And that's just the point.

302
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:50,209
It's become a tradition for her
to win the cup...

303
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:53,087
...and her roses mean so much to her.

304
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:56,006
I know it seems
an awful thing to ask...

305
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,967
...but I thought you might,
perhaps, as a favor...

306
00:22:59,135 --> 00:23:02,971
...persuade Mr. Ballard to withdraw
his rose from the competition.

307
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:07,976
To be frank, it's such a beautiful rose
it might easily win, and, well...

308
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:09,645
Miss Beldon...

309
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,773
...may I ask whether
this is an open competition?

310
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:16,902
- Yes, technically...
- Technically, yes, but actually, no.

311
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,365
CAROL: Yes, I suppose that's it. You see...
- I see only too well, Miss Beldon.

312
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,076
Because Mr. Ballard
is not of the ruling class...

313
00:23:24,244 --> 00:23:28,997
...is a mere vassal, as it were...
- Vin, please. Let Miss Beldon explain.

314
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:32,292
But, Mother, Miss Beldon
doesn't have to explain, not to me.

315
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,796
I'm aware of the influence
of the feudal system in this village.

316
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:39,883
These are orders from the manor.
Her ladyship must have no competition.

317
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,719
You must excuse my son.
He's just down from Oxford.

318
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:46,349
Don't apologize for me.
I mean everything I say.

319
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:50,520
Well, I'm glad to hear it,
but do you do anything about it?

320
00:23:50,688 --> 00:23:53,982
Do? Why, what do you mean?

321
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,986
If you feel something is wrong,
what are you doing about it?

322
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:02,949
I've spent holidays the last few years
doing settlement work in London slums.

323
00:24:03,117 --> 00:24:05,910
- You wallow in luxury all the year...
- I don't wallow!

324
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:08,621
...and think a few weeks playing
Lady Bountiful...

325
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:10,832
- Come, Vin.
- It's not much, perhaps...

326
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,251
...but it's the only thing I know.

327
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:16,379
- What have you been doing?
- I?

328
00:24:16,547 --> 00:24:19,841
- Well...
- I see. Just talk.

329
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:22,844
- That's all right. It's easier.
- Listen, I didn't say...

330
00:24:23,012 --> 00:24:24,679
Oh, don't apologize.

331
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:28,683
I know how comfortable it is to curl up
with a book full of big words...

332
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:32,187
...and think you're going to solve
the problems of the universe.

333
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:35,690
But you're not.
A bit of action is required now and then.

334
00:24:35,858 --> 00:24:38,943
Action? If that's what you
and your class are asking for...

335
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:43,281
...maybe you'll get it one of these days.
- Maybe. But not from the talkers.

336
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:47,202
Vin! Remember, Miss Beldon is a guest.
If you have any manners at all...

337
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:50,955
Manners? A humble working man
is denied the reward of his artistry...

338
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:55,168
...to gratify the vanity of an aristocrat...
- Quiet. This isn't your concern.

339
00:24:55,336 --> 00:24:58,379
I beg to differ. I'm concerned
for a fellow man's dignity.

340
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:01,216
And the indignity
that's heaped upon him.

341
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,428
- You'll excuse me, I'm sure, Miss Beldon.
- Certainly.

342
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:10,767
- I must apologize for Vin.
- Oh, no, please, it's all right.

343
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:13,937
And besides, he's rather nice, isn't he?

344
00:25:14,104 --> 00:25:15,563
- What?
- Well...

345
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,815
Really, you know, he's perfectly right.

346
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,735
I have not a leg to stand on
in this business.

347
00:25:20,903 --> 00:25:22,403
I shouldn't have asked you.

348
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:25,365
I realized that before the words
were out of my mouth.

349
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:28,826
It's just that my grandmother's over 80
and takes such pride...

350
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,246
...in winning year after year.
KAY: Of course.

351

But please forget
I said anything about it.

00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:35,542
Anyhow, I'm glad we met at last.

353

- I hope so too.

- You'll be at the sailing club dance tonight?
- Oh, yes.

355
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:44,300
- Good. I'll see you there, then.
- Goodbye.

356
00:25:44,468 --> 00:25:47,512
To hear people talk, you'd think
Mr. Ballard committed a crime.

357
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,765
I don't hold with people getting
ideas above their station.

358
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:53,810
Who's he to think he can
enter his rose in the show?

359
00:25:53,978 --> 00:25:57,105
- And who's to say he can't?
- Nobody's ever entered a rose...

360
00:25:57,273 --> 00:26:02,235
...against Lady Beldon since she started
30 years ago. Keep a civil tongue...

361
00:26:02,403 --> 00:26:05,363
...or I'll be doing my shopping
in Meekham after this!

362
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:09,242
My opinion has got nothing to do
with the quality of my merchandise.

[BELLS RINGING]

364
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:14,163
If you'd called your rose a "Lady
Beldon," I'd have said right and proper.

365
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:17,667
- But who's Mrs. Miniver?
- The nicest lady in the neighborhood...

366
00:26:17,835 --> 00:26:21,170
...Mr. Huggins, that's who.
- Yeah, maybe, but a newcomer.

367
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:26,301
No, Mr. Ballard, you stick to the railway
and leave roses alone.

368
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:30,388
Why should I? Why should I?
They're my hobby, the roses are.

369
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:33,141
And the railway can go to...

- And a sense of humor too.

00:26:50,534 --> 00:26:53,411
I loved the way she handled Vin
this afternoon.

372
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:56,748
I think she's coming over.

373
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,083
- Hello.
- Good evening, Miss Beldon.

374
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,961
- Please, sit down.
- Sit down, won't you?

00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:03,463
Thank you.

- Yes, such a wonderful band.

- No, thanks.

- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

- I was rather looking for your son.
- I'm sorry, Vin's not here.

No, he's suffering
from an acute case of maturity.

Yes. But it'll pass.
We give it a week or two, at the outside.

I wanted to tell him I was sorry
about this afternoon.

383
00:27:25,903 --> 00:27:31,491
Oh, I rather think he wanted to say
the same thing himself. It's a pity...

384
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:34,035
I beg your pardon.
For you, Miss Beldon.

Thank you.

Please don't get up.

I'm going back on anything I said.

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,934
Of course not.

397
00:28:39,352 --> 00:28:42,938
But I did express myself
a bit emphatically.

I hope you'll excuse me.
My mode of expression, I mean.

There's really nothing to excuse.

Everyone's entitled to his
mode of expression.

Still, I had no right to lose my temper.

Oh, yes. Yes, I do.

I didn't know when you'd wake up,
so I couldn't order anything for dinner.

1056
01:25:03,247 --> 01:25:06,582
Breakfast. No matter what time it is
when I wake up, it's breakfast.

Come in.

1059
01:25:09,711 --> 01:25:12,964
- Hello, Ada.
- Well, I am glad to see you, sir!

1060
01:25:13,132 --> 01:25:16,467
After what it said in the papers,
I was quite worried about you.

1061
01:25:16,635 --> 01:25:19,178
- I was.
- That's nice of you, but I'm all right.

1062
01:25:19,346 --> 01:25:22,181
All I need now is a good large plate
of ham and eggs.

1063
01:25:22,349 --> 01:25:23,933
All right, sir.

1064
01:25:24,101 --> 01:25:27,186
- Then it is in the papers?
- About Dunkirk?

1065
01:25:27,354 --> 01:25:29,564
- Yes.
- Yes, dear.

1066
01:25:30,065 --> 01:25:33,276
Thank heavens.
I shan't have to tell you about it.

1067
01:25:33,443 --> 01:25:35,319
Clem, I'm so proud of you.

1068
01:25:35,487 --> 01:25:37,780
Are you, darling?
Well, that's nice.

1069
01:25:37,948 --> 01:25:40,783
And come to think of it,
I'm a bit proud of myself.

What you might call
a real bit of navigation.

1071

I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

1072

Oh, darling, I'm almost sorry for you,
having a nice, quiet, peaceful time...

1073

I'm sorry, ma'am, but I just remembered
we ain't got any ham.

- Nothing at all.
- What do you mean, "nothing at all"?

1083
01:26:21,116 --> 01:26:25,161
Well, I just had a German pilot in
for ham and eggs this morning.

1084
01:26:25,329 --> 01:26:28,539
CLEM: Wait! What's going on here?
- Now, Clem, don't get excited.

1085
01:26:28,707 --> 01:26:32,084
- I'm going to draw your bath.
CLEM: I've had a bath. I'm not excited!

- No, I don't want one.

- Yes.
- But what did you do?

1089
01:26:38,759 --> 01:26:41,594
Woman, you're driving me crazy.
Didn't he have a gun?

1090
01:26:41,762 --> 01:26:44,138
Well, yeah, he had a gun.

Well?

I took it from him and called the police.

Oh, you just took it to the police...
Just like that.

1094
01:26:57,278 --> 01:26:59,988
And then I suppose you gave him tea.

1095

Milk.

KAY:
Lady Beldon.

1105

If I hadn't known you'd taken that pilot
single-handed, I'd say you were scared.

I took that German pilot single-handed.

she ought to be proud and happy.

Why, Lady Beldon, this is nice.

1114

Won't you sit down here?

1115

I think I can guess why you came.

1116
01:28:34,751 --> 01:28:37,711
- Vin's told you his news, hasn't he?
- Yes, Mrs. Miniver.

1117
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:42,049
- I do hope you're as pleased as we are.
- I'm afraid not. Why, they're infants.

1118
01:28:42,216 --> 01:28:45,135
- Carol's 18 and that boy's not 20.
- Yes, they are young.

1119
01:28:45,303 --> 01:28:49,056
I think I should tell you frankly,
I hope to persuade Carol to wait.

1120
01:28:49,223 --> 01:28:52,100
- You think she may change her mind?
- Frankly, yes.

1121
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:56,355
- Perhaps make a better match.
- There's always that possibility.

1122
01:28:56,522 --> 01:28:58,899
Of course,
it may be just maternal vanity...

1123
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:02,652
...but I don't think Carol will find
anyone nicer than Vin.

1124
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:06,323
- I don't believe she'll change her mind.
- It's a matter of opinion.

1125
01:29:06,491 --> 01:29:09,659
- Her age is a matter of fact.
- Isn't that Beldon tradition...

1126
01:29:09,827 --> 01:29:11,161
...to marry young?

1127
01:29:11,329 --> 01:29:13,997
- I don't know what you mean.
- My daughter Judy...

1128
01:29:14,165 --> 01:29:17,918
You've not met Judy. She had to write
a composition on the Crusades.

1129
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:20,587
She brought a small book home
from the library...

1130
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:23,965
...called A Friend
of King Richard the Lion-Hearted.

1131
01:29:24,133 --> 01:29:27,886
- It was a life of an ancestor of yours.
- Really, I fail to see...

1132
01:29:28,054 --> 01:29:31,348
It was a fascinating book.
I got quite interested in it myself.

1133
01:29:31,516 --> 01:29:33,934
It was full of stories
of the Beldon family.

1134
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:37,521
I trust you satisfied yourself
we were worthy of the alliance.

1135
01:29:37,688 --> 01:29:40,941
Well, there were one or two things
that rather surprised me.

1136
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:44,111
Did you know that the
12th Lord Beldon was hanged?

1137
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:45,612
He was beheaded.

1138
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:48,031
Such things happen in the best families.

1139
01:29:48,199 --> 01:29:52,119
- Usually in the best families.
- In fact, what interested me most...

1140
01:29:52,286 --> 01:29:56,039
...was the extreme youth of the
Beldon brides. This Gilbert Beldon...

1141
01:29:56,207 --> 01:30:00,627
...who went on the Crusades, married an
Isabelle Du Something-or-other, age 12.

1142
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:05,382
I did not come here to chatter pedigrees.
I'm old-fashioned. I believe in breeding.

1143
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:08,885
- That's neither here nor there.
- Your point is, they're too young.

1144
01:30:09,053 --> 01:30:11,221
I've said so, haven't I?

1145
01:30:11,556 --> 01:30:14,683
We're at war, Lady Beldon.
And Vin's a flyer.

1146
01:30:14,851 --> 01:30:17,936
It's no excuse for rushing into
an ill-considered marriage.

1147
01:30:18,104 --> 01:30:22,149
But in war, time is so precious
to the young people.

1148
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:24,693
- How old were you when you married?
- I?

1149
01:30:24,861 --> 01:30:27,154
It's no use telling fibs...

1150
01:30:27,321 --> 01:30:31,658
...because I looked you up.
- Oh, well, if you've looked me up...

1151
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:35,412
...I suppose you know that I was 16.

1152
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:40,000
- Sixteen. And did your parents approve?
- That's beside the point.

1153
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:42,210
Oh, forgive me. Is it?

1154
01:30:42,378 --> 01:30:45,338
You married very young,
without your parents' consent...

1155
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:47,591
...and yet when Carol...

1156
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:52,304
- Oh, but perhaps you regretted it.
- I did nothing of the kind.

1157
01:30:52,472 --> 01:30:54,932
- Then why...?
- My marriage lasted a few weeks.

1158
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:58,853
My husband was in the army.
He was killed in action.

1159
01:30:59,021 --> 01:31:01,856
Oh, I'm so sorry. Forgive me.
I didn't know.

1160
01:31:02,024 --> 01:31:04,734
I never regretted it.
Not for one moment.

1161
01:31:04,902 --> 01:31:07,653
We married because
we knew that might happen.

1162
01:31:07,821 --> 01:31:11,657
But I don't want Carol to suffer
as I suffered.

1163
01:31:11,867 --> 01:31:15,203
Don't you want her to be happy,
even for a little while...

1164
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:17,371
...the way you were?

1165
01:31:17,998 --> 01:31:19,582
I was afraid you'd say that.

1166
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:22,710
Not that it matters what you say.
Or what I say, either.

1167
01:31:22,878 --> 01:31:24,629
You know that, don't you?

1168
01:31:24,796 --> 01:31:27,340
You mean, Carol will go her own way?

1169
01:31:27,508 --> 01:31:29,842
She's my granddaughter.

1170
01:31:30,636 --> 01:31:32,970
Well, then why?

1171
01:31:33,138 --> 01:31:35,264
Goodness knows.

1172
01:31:35,432 --> 01:31:37,683
I was beaten before I started.

1173
01:31:37,851 --> 01:31:41,062
You don't mind terribly, do you?

1174
01:31:41,230 --> 01:31:43,814
He is a nice boy.

1175
01:31:44,691 --> 01:31:46,234
Yes.

1176
01:31:46,401 --> 01:31:48,277
I see now where he gets it.

1177
01:31:48,445 --> 01:31:49,779
You're pretty too.

1178
01:31:49,947 --> 01:31:52,907
No wonder that wretched Ballard
named his rose after you.

1179
01:31:53,075 --> 01:31:56,202
Not that he's got a chance
of getting the cup from me.

1180
01:31:56,370 --> 01:32:00,373
Well, so long as we're going
to be relatives...

1181
01:32:00,541 --> 01:32:03,501
...the least you can do
is to offer me some tea.

1182
01:32:05,796 --> 01:32:09,173
- Well?
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

1183
01:32:15,556 --> 01:32:17,598
"So Alice sat on with closed eyes...

1184
01:32:17,766 --> 01:32:20,434
...and half believed herself again
in Wonderland.

1185
01:32:20,602 --> 01:32:22,770
With the grass rustling in the wind...

1186
01:32:22,938 --> 01:32:25,815
...and the pool rippling
to the waving of the reeds...

1187
01:32:25,983 --> 01:32:30,194
...the tinkling sheep bells,
the voice of the shepherd boy...

1188
01:32:30,362 --> 01:32:33,281
...and the lowing of the cattle
in the distance.

1189
01:32:33,448 --> 01:32:37,910
She pictured to herself how she would
keep through all her riper years...

1190
01:32:38,078 --> 01:32:42,081
...the simple and loving heart
of her childhood...

1191
01:32:42,249 --> 01:32:45,501
...and how she would gather
about her other little children...

1192
01:32:45,669 --> 01:32:50,381
...and make their eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale.

1193
01:32:50,549 --> 01:32:54,010
Perhaps even with a dream
of Wonderland."

1194
01:32:56,847 --> 01:33:00,099
- They're asleep.
CLEM: Good.

1195
01:33:03,937 --> 01:33:06,355
- What time is it, darling?
KAY: Ten to 10.

1196
01:33:10,902 --> 01:33:12,486
Going to have your coffee now?

1197
01:33:12,654 --> 01:33:16,949
No. I think I'll have a little smoke first.

1198
01:33:18,619 --> 01:33:20,411
Anything you want from the house?

1199
01:33:20,579 --> 01:33:22,204
No, I don't think so.
