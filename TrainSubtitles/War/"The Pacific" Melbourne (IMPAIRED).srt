1
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:30,029
(theme music playing)

2
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,430
(marching band playing)

3
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,603
(crowd cheering)

4
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,356
Woman:
Heroes! Heroes!

5
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,359
Man:
Welcome to Australia, mates.

6
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,322
What the hell is this?

7
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,625
Well done.
Well done.

8
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,922
Yay for the Yankees.

9
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,090
- Yay!
- Welcome down under.

10
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,343
Woman:
G'day, handsome.

11
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,766
We love you.

12
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,393
Man:
G'day there, mate.

13
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,525
Do you believe this?

14
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,402
Woman:
We love you!

15
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,656
We love you!

16
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,617
(cheering)

17
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,423
How many Japs
you kill, Yank?

18
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,883
You kill many Japs?

19
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,470
Killed any Japs?

20
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,982
Let's go.
Disembark the truck.

21
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,944
Find your company areas.

22
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,822
Where are we?

23
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,324
Man:
Keep moving.

24
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,995
Make sure you got
all your gear.

25
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,373
Find your area.

26
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,253
Keep moving
all the way through.

27
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,343
Let's go.
Find your areas.

28
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,983
Make sure to store
those M1 rifles now!

29
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,695
Andrews, you're on mess.
Move it.

30
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,865
It ain't no Wrigley Field.

31
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,743
Man on P. A:
Attention in the area.

32
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,911
Attention in the area.

33
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,540
All arriving personnel,
this is your billeting area.

34
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,917
You will be directed
by your company.

35
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,795
Officer: First squad, let's go.
Grab those packs.

36
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,846
Oh, the hell with this.
I'm gonna sleep for a few days.

37
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,226
Better take
a look at this.

38
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,355
The MPs
are just giving up.

39
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,065
Phillips:
Can they do that?

40
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,359
Everyone's going AWOL.
Nobody's stopping them.

41
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,361
Oh, I've got to be
a part of this.

42
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,364
- Marine: Whoo, freedom!
- All right.

43
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,075
Marine:
Melbourne here we come.

44
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,743
Let's hit the streets.

45
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,412
Hey, buddy, rest up.
All right?

46
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,748
Mmm.

47
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,084
(bell dings)

48
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,796
(church bell tolling)

49
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,718
Have something.

50
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,264
It's like St. Mark's
on Woodward.

51
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,725
All Saints
on North Hermitage.

52
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,354
It's as pure as every
church bell that ever rang.

53
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,068
(jazz music playing)

54
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,903
Straight ahead.
Give it a try.

55
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,822
- It's wonderful.
- Sorry, excuse me.

56
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,408
The beers?

57
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:53,078
Here, here and here.

58
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,166
Whiskey,

59
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,170
rum,

60
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,297
vodka,

61
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,425
rye,

62
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,427
brandy,
Bourbon

63
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,263
and vermouth.

64
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,433
And you call that?

65
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,768
A Blockbuster.

66
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,521
You're sure gonna be
trouble tonight, cobber.

67
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,404
- Here you go, Manny.
- To Manny.

68
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,666
(groans)

69
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,586
Never thought you'd
down that, mate.

70
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:46,006
Right now we could
down anything.

71
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,300
Aren't you supposed to be
in Africa fighting Rommel?

72
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,552
Somebody has to keep
the peace at home,

73
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,387
let you Yanks
get your proper R&R.

74
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,390
Quite a lot of you here now.
Just arrived today?

75
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,392
- Must be thousands.
- Tens of thousands.

76
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,685
How many, mates?

77
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,396
- Enough for a cricket team.
- (laughs)

78
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,358
Enough to make our beer
run dry and our girls run loose.

79
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,278
Have to fuck the king himself to find a taxi
you warriors haven't commandeered.

80
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,697
I'd say it's a bit more
like a gang of roaches.

81
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:14,242
Every step we take, and bloody hell,
there's another Yank under our boot.

82
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,790
I'm guessing this is one Yank we don't
have to worry about anymore.

83
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,751
Hey, if it weren't for us
you'd be guzzling sake

84
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,337
with a pair of chopsticks up
your ass, you stupid fuck.

85
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,343
Okay okay, that's it.

86
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,512
Yeah right, you're all
Tommy Mix who saved the day.

87
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,850
It's okay.
Why don't you get out of here?

88
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,354
This one hits the turps,
first thing out he's having a blue.

89
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,524
Another dumb drunk
who thinks he can fight.

90
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,443
Let us buy you the next
round of drinks.

91
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,112
Otherwise what kind
of hosts would we be?

92
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,949
Alan, another round of drinks
for the cowboy Yanks.

93
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,706
(chuckles)

94
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,003
Whoo!

95
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,755
Oh, Yank here.

96
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,383
Looking to see the town.

97
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,595
Oh, hello.

98
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,722
Hello, beautiful.

99
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,642
Visitor down under;
speak the same language.

100
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,729
(laughs)

101
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,901
Hey!

102
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,534
Hey, beautiful.

103
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,792
(bell dings)

104
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,252
(bottle breaks)

105
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,754
Oh, what the hell's
he doing?

106
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,089
Where's that tram go?

107
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,757
That's the Preston line.
He'll end up in Perth.

108
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,052
- Oh hey, Leckie, come on!
- Hey, Leckie, what the hell?

109
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,888
Excuse me, sir.
Ma'am.

110
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,224
I apologize.

111
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,478
Pardon me.
Excuse me.

112
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,982
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Leckie!

113
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,110
Whoa! Attaboy, Leck.
(laughs)

114
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,529
Are you proposing
already, Yank?

115
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,615
I'm proposing that you
take a walk with me.

116
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,658
You never know what
the future may bring.

117
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,202
You know what
take a walk means?

118
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,622
Oh, ma'am.

119
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,749
Ma'am, miss...

120
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,002
miss, I'm a foreigner
on your shores.

121
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,463
Forgive my ignorance
of your customs, but...

122
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,969
my invitation
remains an offer.

123
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,305
Ha.

124
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,227
You're a bold one sotted.

125
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,813
Let's see you
in the light of day.

126
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,825
Collect me at home.

127
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,619
Being sober
would be a plus.

128
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,580
- (chuckles)
- (bell rings)

129
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,628
I'm Stella, in case you were
wondering what to call me.

130
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,463
Ah.

131
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,507
Stella is it?

132
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,677
Well, you've got
guts, Leckie.

133
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,388
Thank you very much.
That made my night.

134
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,348
- You'd better laminate that piece of paper.
- That made my night.

135
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,643
- (snoring)
- (coughing)

136
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,986
- Gonna be good?
- I'll say.

137
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,488
Shh, be quiet.

138
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,827
- Hit it.
- (reveille playing)

139
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,079
(groans)

140
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,252
(men groaning)

141
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,716
(men grumbling)

142
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,364
(belches)

143
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,373
Company dismissed.

144
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,419
Puller:
Let me tell you something, Sergeant,

145
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,380
stumbling around camp
like the town stiff

146
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,257
is not acceptable behavior.

147
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,384
Not anymore.

148
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,431
Can't help but notice
I'm not alone in this, sir.

149
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,976
Well, you are
in one respect.

150
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,732
You are about to be awarded
the Medal of Honor.

151
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,111
President Roosevelt
found you worthy.

152
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,907
Congratulations, old man.

153
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,076
You're about to go where very
few Marines have ever been.

154
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,245
(gags)

155
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,581
Oh, hey hey!
Here here.

156
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,125
Oh, shit.

157
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,756
This is...
I'm sorry.

158
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,009
Yeah, all right.

159
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,303
Listen,

160
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,639
get yourself a big breakfast
and a pot of coffee

161
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,974
and you come back here
when you're respectable.

162
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,812
It's not gonna do to have you heave
all over your own citation.

163
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:39,150
This is the highest honor that our
country can award a serviceman.

164
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,486
But from now on,

165
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,531
you try and act
like it's yours.

166
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,950
Yes, sir.

167
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,124
Well, go.

168
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,215
(door opens, closes)

169
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,425
(chuckles)

170
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,386
Aw, Jeez.

171
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,348
? You're just an angel
in disguise ?

172
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,227
? Who wandered down
from up above ?

173
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:18,189
? You're just a heavenly
surprise ?

174
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,068
? Who came to Earth
for me to love ?

175
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,946
? 'Cause introduction
to an angel ?

176
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,240
? Is more than thrilling ?

177
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,868
? It leaves me high... ?

178
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,995
The Articles of War?

179
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,788
That's what I'm calling 'em.

180
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,582
He's been going on about this

181
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,917
since long before
you came along.

182
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,296
See, Gwenie's dad, my son,
he's over there in Burma

183
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,173
showing the Japs
what side is up.

184
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,843
I'm in charge
of Gwenie's honor.

185
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,970
A manual of arms.

186
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,514
My grandfather would want
the same understanding.

187
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,017
Let's get this understood.

188
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,019
Hit him with it, girl.

189
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,271
Article l:

190
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,982
General provisions.
Hands off the merchandise.

191
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,191
You've memorized this?

192
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,695
See, I'm the merchandise.

193
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,572
Hand off, aye aye, sir.

194
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,032
Article Il:

195
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,867
Hands off the merchandise.

196
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,453
Meaning there'll be
none of that.

197
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,960
There's no problem there.
I'm not much of a dancer, sir.

198
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,883
Um, Article lll:

199
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,344
Punishments for violating
one and two.

200
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,095
It'll be swift
and unflinching.

201
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,557
Don't for a moment think
otherwise, son.

202
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,559
Yes, sir.

203
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,396
Make a hole.
Come on.

204
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,109
Drink it out of the glass
without spilling.

205
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,403
That's right.
Take your time.

206
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,490
Move closer.
A little closer.

207
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,742
- Closer.
- Come on.

208
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,578
Closer.
Closer.

209
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,789
- A little closer.
- (crowd groans)

210
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,125
It's hard.
Come on.

211
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,920
(brakes squeal)

212
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,339
MPs just pulled up.

213
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,675
You've got to get out of here.
Every Marine in this place is AWOL.

214
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,094
I'd say that's why
they're here.

215
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,975
Listen up.

216
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,851
Every Marine
in this establishment

217
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,689
will produce a Liberty Pass
or will return immediately to his billet.

218
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,108
- Oh, come on!
- (bottle shatters)

219
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,278
What's this then?

220
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,781
There's no problem.
I've got a pass.

221
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,034
But still, why don't I escort
Gwen out the back, sir?

222
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,161
- M. P: You're going back to your billet.
- Good night, Gramps.

223
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,164
- Don't wait up.
- M. P: Show me your pass.

224
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,459
Come on, let's go.

225
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,255
Come on, Mo.

226
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,967
(horn honking)

227
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,220
Saddle up, pardner.

228
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,680
Stealing an MP's jeep?
Are you kidding me?

229
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,099
- (starts engine)
- Come on, Mo. Hop in.

230
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,309
(turns off engine)

231
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,228
You can't do this shit, John.
Not now.

232
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,063
Remember what
Chesty told you.

233
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,482
Don't screw this up.

234
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,159
(marching band playing)

235
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,330
Left.

236
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,874
March.

237
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,212
Line halt.

238
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,513
Detail halt.

239
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,850
Sir, detail is formed.

240
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:48,524
For extraordinary heroism
and conspicuous gallantry,

241
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,818
Sergeant John Basilone,

242
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,362
while at great risk
to his own life,

243
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,865
fought valiantly
to check a savage

244
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,992
and determined
Japanese assault

245
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,204
while serving the 1st Battalion,
7th Marines

246
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:06,000
in Guadalcanal on October
24 and 25, 1942.

247
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,212
Sergeant John Basilone
is hereby awarded

248
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,880
the Medal of Honor.

249
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,902
Left as we go.

250
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,531
Right face.

251
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,494
Company right hut.

252
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,259
Face right.

253
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,909
(Greek music playing)

254
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,995
(knocks)

255
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,133
So what's your name then?

256
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,093
Bob.

257
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,929
Sobered up,
are you, Bob?

258
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,139
I'm no fool.

259
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,892
These are for you.

260
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,479
I hope you're hungry.

261
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,734
(door closes)

262
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,320
Man on radio:
...created by the announcement

263
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,614
that President Roosevelt
and Winston Churchill

264
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,034
have met at Casablanca
and completed...

265
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,578
- Stella: This is Bob.
- Leckie.

266
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,205
Bob Leckie.

267
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,165
Shake hands
with my father Baba.

268
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,876
(Greek accent)
What a grip.

269
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,337
An American grip, eh?

270
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,172
This is my mama.

271
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,841
This is a Yank.

272
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,762
Skin and bones.
Like a skeleton. Like a rail.

273
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,973
(speaking Greek)
He stole some roses

274
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,016
from Mrs. Bano's yard.

275
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,061
Let her scream.

276
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,355
Stella, his jacket. Ella.

277
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,695
I thought we were going
for a stroll.

278
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,197
Good news, Bob.
You're staying for dinner.

279
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,699
I am?

280
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,035
One word of an American coming
to call and that was that.

281
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,956
Leckie:
This is like a Thanksgiving.

282
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,749
Oh, what is that?

283
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,419
It's a holiday Roosevelt made
of the fourth Thursday of November.

284
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,879
Everyone sits at the table,
eats turkey and argues.

285
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,465
- (laughs)
- Roosevelt is a great man.

286
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,551
You eat as much
as you like, eh? Ella.

287
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,594
The beans are from the garden.

288
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,972
You didn't touch the feta.

289
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,890
We save it
for tomorrow, huh?

290
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,268
Nay, Mama,
I'll start cleaning up.

291
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,396
You see?
Good girl, my Stella.

292
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,647
Good Greek girl.

293
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,566
(speaking Greek)
Okay, but don't break the good dishes.

294
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,943
I won't.

295
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,820
You're on your own now.

296
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,655
I think I can
handle this one.

297
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,825
So, Mama,

298
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,077
what's a Greek girl like
you doing in Melbourne?

299
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,912
Oh, you don't care
about that.

300
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,206
No no no, don't go officer on me.
You're not Australian.

301
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,667
No no, I come from
the old country.

302
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,085
Smyrna.

303
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,588
That was sacked
by the Turks, wasn't it?

304
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,506
You know about that?

305
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,509
Um, I read a lot.

306
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,929
The Turks invaded in 1922
and burned it down.

307
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,515
All gone.

308
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,353
If you survived, you fled
like my mama and me.

309
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,230
But we made it down
to the docks.

310
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,733
We swam to a ship.

311
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,651
The captain took us onboard

312
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,029
and sailed us to Piraeus.

313
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,115
He saved our lives.

314
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,202
But our home was gone.

315
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,788
So where do we go?

316
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,624
We come here.

317
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,002
We live, we work,
we find love.

318
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,340
So now you must tell
about your home.

319
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,467
- Yeah, about America.
- No no no.

320
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,095
Not America.
America we see in the movies.

321
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,388
Your family.

322
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,972
Well, seems like we both
escaped disaster.

323
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,474
I fled the Leckie household.

324
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,976
Mama:
How many in the household?

325
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,020
Mama had five girls,
three boys.

326
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,857
Oh, octo babies.
Your lucky mama.

327
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:25,111
I don't know if she'd agree. She was
almost 40 by the time I came along.

328
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,322
(speaking Greek)
Baba! Just like you and me, you hear?

329
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,074
She was worn out by then.

330
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,159
I think they all were.

331
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,830
But it's a blessing,
so many children.

332
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,332
Well, Marion and Foddy Leckie,
they didn't want eight kids.

333
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,001
Oh no?
They should stop?

334
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,337
They didn't want
the beautiful baby son?

335
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:47,174
I was last.
Last is least.

336
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,718
Oh, Bob.
You know nothing.

337
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,222
By the time I met Nicola

338
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,975
it was almost too late
to make babies.

339
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,019
Not that we didn't try, eh?
(laughs)

340
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,981
Eh, relax.

341
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,319
That girl in the kitchen,
my only blessing.

342
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,363
I prayed for more,

343
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,532
but God said no.

344
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,618
Nothing you can do
when God say no.

345
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:20,082
So where do you stay
with the Marines, huh?

346
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,293
They put us in the stadium
where you play cricket.

347
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,546
What? You will stay
here tonight.

348
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,132
Stella, get the bed
ready in the spare room.

349
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,926
- Okay.
- I can't do that.

350
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,720
- I could never repay you.
- (scoffs)

351
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,930
You can help clear
the vines from the roof.

352
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,932
Yes, you will do that.

353
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,519
You will make this
your home.

354
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,110
Twist a guy's arm.

355
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,362
(speaks Greek)

356
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,907
Slanche.

357
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,184
(moaning)

358
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,141
Oh, dear God.

359
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,646
- Oh, God.
- (laughs)

360
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,860
No no no,
you stay right there.

361
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,571
I think we should give it
another go.

362
00:26:56,906 --> 00:27:00,409
Okay, sure.
Sure, me too.

363
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,538
But even Americans
need, uh...

364
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,916
Oh, a wait
before they reload.

365
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,127
It's okay.

366
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,088
I'm going nowhere.

367
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,030
Why did you have to flee
your family?

368
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,616
Oh...

369
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,243
my family.

370
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,206
Not a happy bunch,
my family.

371
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,124
Why not?

372
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,512
Something in our bones.

373
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,058
Did your brothers go into
the service to get away too?

374
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:09,144
One of my brothers
was too old.

375
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,438
The other died
when I was a kid.

376
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,108
That's terrible.

377
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,903
My father's been crippled
in the head ever since.

378
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,699
We're not exactly
the Judge Hardy family.

379
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,450
(laughs)

380
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:28,247
I swear, I'm just waiting
for the clock to hit midnight

381
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,999
and my sanity bell
goes ringing.

382
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,461
I had a brother
who died too.

383
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,422
You did?

384
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,300
No one talks about him.

385
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:43,262
He was a baby, just a few days old
and didn't live.

386
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,224
Mama got sick and wasn't
able to have any more.

387
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,758
Puller:
We start by restoring their bodies.

388
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,511
They rest.
They play.

389
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,013
Then we work
on their pride.

390
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,057
We remind them
they're Marines.

391
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,851
Then we replenish
our supplies.

392
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,062
See, all of that
takes money.

393
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,688
I understand.

394
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,149
It's a hell of a lot
easier to raise money

395
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,777
when there's a face
behind it

396
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,738
and a heroic story
attached to it,

397
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,406
like yours.

398
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,033
I don't feel
like a hero, sir.

399
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,160
You're not getting it.

400
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,663
All right.

401
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,666
Think of us out there
on that line.

402
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,626
You know what we need...

403
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,879
new weapons, new gear,
better motor transport.

404
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,297
Yes, sir.

405
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,384
Selling US war bonds

406
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:50,138
is just as important,
just as life saving,

407
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,391
as what you did
on Guadalcanal.

408
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,811
Now pack your seabag.
You're going home

409
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,772
Home?

410
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,692
How many US war bonds
you gonna sell

411
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,111
stomping around
the Solomons with us?

412
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,032
Go on.
Get it done, Sergeant.

413
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,882
(grunting)

414
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,095
(moaning)

415
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,073
Oh.

416
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,075
(laughs)
I liked that.

417
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,745
Shame on me.

418
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,540
I got you something.

419
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,642
Stockings?

420
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,686
Real silk?

421
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,111
I'll wear them
only for you.

422
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,783
Wait wait wait wait.
There's more.

423
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,077
This...

424
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,162
is for everyone.

425
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,790
(laughs)
Oh no.

426
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,792
- Leg of lamb.
- No.

427
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,127
How?
How did you get it?

428
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,296
- I'm not gonna tell you.
- Why not?

429
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,674
- I think you should kiss me first.
- How?

430
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,384
- How?
- I can't remember.

431
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,345
I can't get a leg of lamb.
But you do?

432
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,556
American ingenuity
and a few packs of Lucky Strikes.

433
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,310
"Nicholas Genkos...
wounded."

434
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,854
Is that
Theodora Genkos' nephew?

435
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,149
I don't know.

436
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,403
Baba checks the casualty
reports for Greek names.

437
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,158
"Alexi Stavrapolous."

438
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,160
Mama:
What's happened to Alexi?

439
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,498
(speaks Greek)

440
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,502
"Killed in action."

441
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,175
I grew up with Alexi.

442
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,220
He lived two streets over.

443
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,017
Change your shirt, Nicola.

444
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,686
We'll take them
the spanikopita.

445
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,605
I'd like to go.

446
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:49,192
Pay my respects,
if they're friends of yours.

447
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,700
(crowd chatting)

448
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,214
- This is my friend Bob.
- My condolences.

449
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,970
Mama:
Stella and Alexi,

450
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,431
they were friends every since
they were children.

451
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,142
He was her friend.

452
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,261
(door opens)

453
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,685
It's no good, Bob.
Mama is still up.

454
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,008
The Greek boys are gone.

455
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,678
More and more every day...

456
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,307
all of Stella's friends
from when she grew up.

457
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,893
I prayed for them,

458
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,396
and for their families.

459
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,775
Do you go to church, Bob?

460
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,320
- St. Mary's.
- Mmm.

461
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,239
What kind of church?

462
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,241
Catholic.

463
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,079
I like the early
morning mass.

464
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,539
Less people.

465
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,083
Mama:
Hmm, we need prayers.

466
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,503
How are we going to make it
through these years

467
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,797
if we don't pray?

468
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,386
We are so lucky to have
you with us, Bob,

469
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,181
to have a young man
in the house.

470
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,349
I like you.

471
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,811
Stella, she likes you.

472
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,190
Baba, he always wanted
a son like you.

473
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,903
I am going to pray
that you come back to us.

474
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,661
That's a good thing
to pray for.

475
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,360
Officer:
Let's get your squads going!

476
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,404
Pack up that gear
and let's go!

477
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,534
What? You thought Uncle Sam was gonna
pay for your great debauch forever?

478
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,912
- Officer: Move out!
- Semper fi.

479
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,082
Better gear up, brother.

480
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,627
Time to get
back in shape.

481
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,045
(train whistle blows)

482
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,589
(moos)

483
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:44,219
(whistle blows)

484
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,474
Chuckler: The M1 is better.
There's no contest.

485
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,268
- Runner: Okay, so show us.
- Okay, ready ready.

486
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,395
- (gunshot)
- Oh!

487
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,230
Chuckler:
Eight rounds over five.

488
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,482
Runner:
No, I will still keep my Springfield.

489
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,776
Chuckler: Jesus Christ, it's like
talking to an old lady.

490
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,278
Fine. You know what?
Keep your cane.

491
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,654
- I will keep my cane.
- I'll will take the M1

492
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,531
because it beats the hell
out of the Springfield.

493
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,908
No no no no.
The 03's are still more accurate.

494
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,910
- Exactly exactly.
- No no, they're slower.

495
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,245
- Target in sight.
- Watch him miss.

496
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,122
- Do it!
- Come on, Gibson.

497
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,374
- Come on, Gibson.
- (gunshot)

498
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,959
- (cheering)
- Bull's-eye!

499
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,169
Hey! Hey!

500
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,922
What are you doing?

501
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,924
You just shot some
poor farmer's cow!

502
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,926
It was gonna
be steak anyway.

503
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,095
Not if it's a dairy cow,
you idiot.

504
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,597
- (laughs)
- Good shot, Gibson.

505
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,850
What kind of morons
have you become?

506
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,436
Did you see that?
I've never seen that.

507
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,151
You will be given
one sack of raisins.

508
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,739
You will be given one sack
of uncooked rice.

509
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:51,202
A Japanese soldier
can live on that for three weeks.

510
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,831
You will march
the 100 miles

511
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,791
back to Melbourne

512
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,627
and be in the arms of your
Aussie girlfriends

513
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,713
in three days.

514
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,259
Fall in, column of two.
Standby to move out.

515
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,678
Let's go.
Fall in.

516
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,514
Move out!

517
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,540
(snoring)

518
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:43,004
Marine: H-2-1, drop your cocks
and grab your socks.

519
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,839
Formation in 20 minutes.

520
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,300
Come on, let's move.
On your feet, let's go.

521
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,677
Come on, shake it out.
Let's do it.

522
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,346
On your feet.
Let's move.

523
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,848
(groans)

524
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,227
Fuck!

525
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:03,983
God!

526
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,655
(sighs)

527
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,287
You first.

528
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,306
Mmm!

529
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,559
Oh, sweet Jesus,
that feels good.

530
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,816
(men muttering)

531
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,926
(Greek music playing)

532
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,060
- Couple of doors down.
- Just right up?

533
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,270
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.

534
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,855
- Take this with you.
- No...

535
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,073
(woman speaking Greek)

536
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,793
You have to go away, Bob.

537
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:52,050
Please don't come
here anymore.

538
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,135
I told Mama
and Baba already

539
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,931
that you got your orders and you left.
You couldn't say goodbye.

540
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,391
You lied?

541
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,645
I'm fairly crazy
about you, Robert.

542
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,188
I think you know that.

543
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,691
I thought so, yeah.

544
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,486
But...

545
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,697
I don't want to have
a baby with you.

546
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,616
Uh...

547
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,829
Are you pregnant?

548
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,706
- No. No.
- You're not?

549
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,834
Bob, you and I aren't going
to have a family.

550
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,172
And we're not going
to get married.

551
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,050
And you are never coming
back to Melbourne.

552
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:49,148
You're dumping me because you think
I'm gonna get killed?

553
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,696
Bob...

554
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,117
if you don't
come back to us,

555
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,369
I don't just lose you,

556
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,538
Mama does too.

557
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,207
I can't do that to her
and I won't let you.

558
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,388
She's lost so much
already, Bob.

559
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,516
She's praying for you
to come back to us.

560
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,060
She can save her breath.

561
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,613
(sobs)

562
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,491
(blues music playing)

563
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,085
(men talking loudly)

564
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,852
(breathing heavily)

565
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,778
Leckie.
Leckie, God love you.

566
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,488
- Come here.
- Fuck off.

567
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,948
No, seriously.
I've got to piss like terrible.

568
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,533
You've got to cover
for me, okay?

569
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,577
I can't.
Drunk as a skunk.

570
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,287
One minute, that's all I need.
Come on.

571
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,873
Come on.
Thank you.

572
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,602
Leckie, what are you doing?

573
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,487
Manning this fucking post,
Lieutenant.

574
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,323
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm the fucking guard on guard duty.

575
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,742
You pull a fucking sidearm
on an officer?

576
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,328
Lieutenant, I went for a quick piss.
Leckie was just covering.

577
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,205
- You fucking prick!
- Stand at attention.

578
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,999
- Fuck you!
- I said stand at attention!

579
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,001
And I said fuck you!

580
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,050
Chuckler:
? Don't sit under the apple tree ?

581
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,678
? With anyone else but me ?

582
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,514
? With anyone
else but me ?

583
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,016
? With anyone else but me ?

584
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,562
? No no no, don't sit under
the apple tree ?

585
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,106
? With anyone else but me ?

586
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,483
? With anyone
else but me ?

587
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,153
? Till I come
marching home. ?

588
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,872
- (cheering)
- Yay, Ma.

589
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,207
- Run, Ma!
- Good hit, Ma.

590
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,585
Yes, Auntie,
that's a six.

591
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,004
So I guess it's sort of
like baseball, huh?

592
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,506
What happens in baseball?

593
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,509
Well, in baseball,

594
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:07,638
you hit a ball
and you run to a base.

595
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,141
Then you run to the next
base if you can.

596
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,684
You keep going
to the next base.

597
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:15,396
If you get to enough bases
you score a run.

598
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:18,775
Gwen: Sounds like rounders.
We play that in school.

599
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,526
Looks like someone is
hunting for you, cobber.

600
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,570
Hey, it's my turn.

601
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,406
Shit.

602
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:30,286
- Your unit?
- How Company, 1st Marines.

603
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,247
Report to your CO
no later than 2400.

604
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,686
(groans)

605
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,739
I trust you Marines got
your heads back together.

606
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:10,284
I'm on orders from
2nd Marine Division.

607
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,787
Lieutenant Lebec has got
the platoon now,

608
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,539
and I want him to inherit
a solid outfit

609
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:17,291
so I volunteered you
for reassignment

610
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,252
to the Battalion
Intelligence section

611
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,254
You're booting us?

612
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,256
Not you...

613
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,676
Leckie.

614
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,149
Fuck.

615
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,159
So, a little light.

616
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,372
Yeah.

617
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,791
(train whistle blowing)

618
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,273
How about if an engine
catches fire

619
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,733
and you dump
in the Pacific?

620
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:51,362
Swim around for days, weeks,
get strafed by Jap Zeroes.

621
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,364
Finally the navy
picks you up.

622
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,242
Think about how many
war bonds you'd sell then.

623
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,244
Probably give you
another medal.

624
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:00,746
You're gonna look up
Katie, right?

625
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,498
First chance I get.

626
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,751
I've been sending my poker
winnings home to her.

627
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,170
Hey, 700 of that is mine.

628
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,464
- (chuckles)
- That's the good thing about leaving...

629
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,258
I won't lose anymore
money to you.

630
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:18,139
Wish you were coming with me.

631
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,977
(plane engine starts)

632
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,775
I think that's you.

633
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,572
(cheering)

634
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,731
(plane engine humming)

635
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,242
(sighs)

636
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,624
(theme music playing)
