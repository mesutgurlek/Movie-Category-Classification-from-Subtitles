<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Last night I dreamed a deadly dream.</i>

2
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,835
<i>Beyond the Isle of Skye...</i>

3
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:39,606
<i>I saw a dead man win a fight...</i>

4
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:43,599
<i>and I think that man was I.</i>

5

<i>This we may say</i>—

6
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,338

7
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:22,331
<i>has begun to touch</i>
<i>our soldiers'helmets.</i>

8
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,502
<i>I have this day received</i>
<i>the following communication...</i>

9
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,616
<i>from General Alexander:</i>

10
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,619
<i>"Sir, the orders you gave me...</i>

11
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,755
<i>"on August 15, 1942...</i>

12

<i>I now await your further instructions. "</i>

18
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:58,567
<i>Well, obviously we shall now</i>
<i>have to think of something else.</i>

19
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,348
<i>I am sure the House will bear with me...</i>

20
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,018
<i>if I do not publicly proclaim...</i>

21
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,321
<i>what that something else will be.</i>

22
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,192
<i>[Man] Sicily, eh?</i>
<i>I suppose it was the obvious choice.</i>

23
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,194
Too obvious.

24
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,197
Here we are, all along the North African coast,
except for Tunisia...

25
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,200
and here's Jerry opposite
from the Pyrenees to Greece.

26
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,003
He knows we're coming, and he knows
we're almost certain to come through here.

27
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,507
All he's got to do
is to sit and wait for us.

28
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,010
As a king's counsel, Montagu,
and a leading member of the bar...

29
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,013
you've sometimes defended a man
in peril of his life.

30
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,015
Yes, sir.

31
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,452
Well, here's your chance
to defend thousands of men.

32
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:43,445
If we land in Sicily now,
we shall have 30% casualties getting ashore.

33
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,460
We sit in offices
and talk about casualties...

34
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,463
as though they were just figures
on a bit of paper.

35
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:54,456
I take it the chiefs of staff
want us to think up a cover plan.

36
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,737
One that'll makeJerry think
we're going somewhere else.

37
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,806
Greece, Sardinia...

38
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,774
the south of France.

39
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,310
I'm told Corsica is very pleasant.

40
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,312
But with respect, sir...

41
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,314
the Germans know we need Sicily.

42
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,316
They must go on defending it.

43
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,819
But we may make them
thin their defenses a bit...

44
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,822
if they think the main attack
is coming somewhere else.

45
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,815
You and your outfit
must drop everything for it.

46
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,928
If we can getJerry...

47
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,930
to move one single battalion...

48
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,432
a battery, or even a gun...

49
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,435
it's going to save a lot of lives.

50
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:33,428
[Man On P.A.] Now, to your left
you will see a further wave of aircraft.

51
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,233
<i>Here you see the multicolored chutes</i>
<i>which are dropping before you.</i>

52
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:42,181
<i>Ah, there's one taking a short cut.</i>

53
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:46,174
<i>That's what we call</i>
<i>jumping to a conclusion, gentlemen.</i>

54
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,456
Just for a moment
I thought someone had had it.

55
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,459
Me too. Those things aren't nearly as safe
as they're made out to be.

56
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,462
I don't think there's
anything for us here, George.

57
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,966
Any scheme that means using troops
would take far too long to set up.

58
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,959
Next phase:
"Use of natural cover."

59
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:08,697
Let's slide out.

60
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,846
Monty, that parachute
that didn't open—

61
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:17,450
Suppose we were to drop a fellow
out of a plane over enemy territory...

62
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,453
with papers on him saying
we were going to invade Greece...

63
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,455
and <i>his</i> parachute didn't open up.

64
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,457
The Germans would find him dead...

65
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,459
and the papers...

66
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,961
and "A-ha," they'd say, "look at this.

67
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,964
"Officer with secret papers,
parachute didn't open—

68
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,966
they're going to invade Greece."

69
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,969
Do we tell the man who jumps
that the parachute doesn't work...

70
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,972
or is it a sort of practical joke
that he finds out on the way down?

71
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,975
Well, of course it'd have to be somebody
we didn't mind much about.

72
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,977
Are you volunteering?

73
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,979
No, George, it wouldn't work.

74
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,482
What about using a man already dead?

75
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,485
The autopsy would show he'd been dead
before he hit the ground.

76
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,755
Let's get back to the office
and think again.

<i>[Bells Pealing]</i>

78

If those boys of yours drink any more coffee,
they won't be able to sleep.

79
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,533
That won't worry them.
They gave up sleeping two days ago.

[Laughs]

81
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,510
Will you come and get it
while it's hot, sir?

82
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,224
Monty, what we really want...

83
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,226
is something absolutely simple.

84
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,729
- The simpler the better.
- Good boy, George. You're absolutely right.

85
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,733
How about this? Supposing we issue
Greek dictionaries to all the troops.

86
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,604
Why should we do that unless we intend
to invade Greece? That'd fool 'em.

87
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,940
I'd make it Eskimo dictionaries.
That would <i>really</i> fool them.

88
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,443
Pam, first thing in the morning...

89
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,446
I want you to get me
the fullest possible details...

90

91

Gibraltar
and the Portuguese border.

92
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,486
- Between where, sir?
- Gibraltar and the Portuguese border.

93
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,388
- Yes, sir.
- Going for a swim?

94
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,390
No.
Sardine fishing.

95
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,393
Now, Pam, it's getting late.
You'd better get off home.

96
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,396
Are you sure you don't want
some sandwiches before I go?

97
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,399
My dear child,
you must try not to be so greedy.

98
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,903
You think of nothing but my stomach.
Go on, hop it.

Yes?

105
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,863
It won't work the way you had it, but...

106
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,866
I have an idea about something

Lucy, the languishing librarian?
Not a chance.

155
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:56,578
If ever I fall in love, it'll be with a guy
who goes out at 9:00 to a nice, safe office...

156
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,425
and comes back at 6:00.

157
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,418
Not one of these flyers—
here today and gone tomorrow.

158
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,922
<i>- [Knocking]</i>
- Come in.

159
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:33,915
Commander Montagu
and Lieutenant Acres, sir.

160
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,530
- Sir Bernard.
- Nice to see you.

161
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,532
- How are you?
- Well, thank you.

162
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,034
My chief assistant, George Acres,
Sir Bernard Spilsbury.

163
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,036
- How do you do?
- I'm honored to meet you, sir.

164
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:48,040
I've always wanted to ever since I heard you
give evidence in the Shotgun Murders.

165
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,543
- You were absolutely masterly.
- Thank you.

166
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,545
Though, mind you,
for sheer brilliance—

167
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,048
No doubt if you continue to charm Sir Bernard,
he'll give you his autograph later.

168
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,050
- Meantime, may we get on?
- Yes, sir.

169
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,052
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

170
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,987
Thank you.

171
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,989
Sir Bernard...

172
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,993
may I ask you some rather odd questions
without explaining why I'm asking them?

173
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,995
You may.

174
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,499
Suppose I wanted
to put a dead body in the sea...

175
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,002
let it float ashore and have it accepted
by the people who find it...

176
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,506
as the victim of an air crash at sea.

177
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:24,499
What sort of body would I need?

178
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,549
Do you want the body
to show any physical damage?

179
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,052
No.

180
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:37,045
- But to look as though he'd died by drowning.
- Yes.

181
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:41,827
- Could he be wearing a Mae West?
- Yes.

182
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,830
- How long in the water?
- Two, three days.

183
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,823
It rather depends on
the information I get from you.

184
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,838
I would say your best bet would be
someone who died of pneumonia.

185
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,840
When somebody dies of pneumonia...

186
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,343
there's a certain amount
of fluid in the lungs.

187
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,346
After a few days in the water,
it would be almost impossible...

188
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,782
to say that he'd
not died of drowning.

189
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,785
That is, unless one
had reason to be suspicious.

190
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,821
You mean, if you were suspicious
you'd probably spot it?

191
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,923
I would, if it came here.

192
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:14,916
But I don't suppose
it <i>would</i> come here, would it?

193
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,598
I don't want to ask
any awkward questions...

194
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,601
but at what sort of place
might this body be found?

195
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,504
Shall we say... Spain.

196
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,506
You wouldn't have any trouble there.

197
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,508
I don't think there's anyone in Spain...

198
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,845
who would examine the body closely enough
to spot the sort of thing that I have in mind.

199
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,181
One other thing, Sir Bernard.

200
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,184
If we had to keep the body
for a week or two...

201
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,553
how would we stop it
from decomposing?

202
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,555
Refrigeration.

203
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,558
<i>And while it was</i>
<i>being transported?</i>

204
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:49,551
I would suggest some sort of
airtight canister packed with dry ice.

205
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,330
Why dry ice?

206
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,034
It would melt and give off carbon dioxide
which would dispel the air.

207
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,037
It's the oxygen in air
that causes decomposition.

208
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:02,030
It would be possible to store a body
in a canister in this way for quite a while.

209
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,744
Well, thank you very much.
That gives me a start.

210
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,748
Sir Bernard, you won't mind if we
come back to you on some of these points?

211
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,750
By all means.

212
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,752
Incidentally,
on this question of refrigeration...

213
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:17,656
you'd better have a word with my man Adams,
the fellow who brought you in.

214
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,658
He has all the facilities here...

215
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,161
and I can arrange for him
to look after things for you.

216
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,163
That would help a great deal.

217
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:28,156
If I were in your place, I shouldn't be able
to resist asking what all this is about.

218
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,937
Lieutenant Acres,
if you <i>were</i> in my place...

219
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,940
you would have to remember
what we used to be told in the nursery.

220
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,944
Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies.
Go on, George.

221
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,946
Good-bye.

222
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,939
Thank you very much.

223
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,221
Well, so far, so good.

224
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,214
That part of it seems to be practical anyway,
provided we can get a body.

225
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,762
Oh, any decent undertaker
will fix us up with a body.

226
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,755
I don't think that's a problem.

227
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,493
So that in essence, sir,
the idea is this:

228
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,675
The body of a dead man,
dressed as an officer...

229
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:13,178
will be put into the sea
from a submarine off the coast of Spain...

230
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,514
near Huelva.

231
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,517
On the body will be
top secret documents...

232
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:22,510
or a letter suggesting
our main attack will be Greece...

233
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,391
not Sicily.

234
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,393
The body will drift ashore.

235
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,396
It will be picked up
and the papers found.

236
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,399
The impression will be
that it is the body of an officer...

237
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,401
who was traveling by plane...

238
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:39,405
and was drowned
when his plane crashed into the sea.

239
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,942
Hmm.

240
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,945
- Why Huelva?
- Two reasons, sir.

241
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,948
First, there are strong inshore currents...

242
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,950
and a prevailing onshore wind...

243
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,953
which will almost certainly
carry the body ashore.

244
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,946
Second, one of the sharpest German agents
in Spain operates in that district.

245
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,951
But the beauty of the whole scheme, sir,
is that it involves only one man...

246
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,397
and therefore might be possible...

247
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:09,390
in the ridiculously
short time allowed us.

248
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,539
May I have your views, sir?

249
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:17,543
In over 30 years of intelligence work
I've never heard of anything like it.

250
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,212
Neither have the Germans.

251
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:24,205
It's the most outrageous, disgusting,
preposterous, not to say barbaric idea.

252
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,153
But work out full details...

253
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,156
and be on hand at the war cabinet offices
at 4:30 tomorrow afternoon.

254
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,158
Thank you, sir.

255
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,160
You'll need a code name.

256
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,153
You can have... Jumbo,
Trader, Wigwam...

257
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,200
<i>Mincemeat, Jubilee</i>—

258
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,193
With your permission, sir, Mincemeat.

259
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:49,430
Operation Mincemeat.
Comments and criticisms. Admiral.

260
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,911
Well, it's an ingenious idea,
of course.

261
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,415
Up to now, I've thought of four major ways
where it could go wrong.

262
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,550
Four?
I was going to say 40.

263
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,488
First, your body may not oblige
by drifting ashore.

264
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:06,291
Next, it may simply be handed over
to the British consul for burial.

265
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,794
<i>Next, even if the papers are examined...</i>

266
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,796
<i>they may not leak to the Germans.</i>

267
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:14,566
And finally, if they do leak to the Germans,
the Germans may guess they're a fake.

268
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,568
That's all quite true, of course.

269
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,071
There are ways
in which it can go wrong.

270
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,274
But that is so of any operation of war,
and certainly any deception plan.

271
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,277
- Dickie.
- I'm for the idea in principle.

272
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,279
But why not the south of France?

273
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,282
<i>Then you'd be sure that the Germans</i>
<i>would get the documents.</i>

274
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,284
<i>After all, Spain is neutral.</i>

275
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,287
Sir, perhaps you would allow Lt. Cmdr. Montagu,
who put forward the idea...

276
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,289
to answer
Adm. Mountbatten's question.

277
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,291
<i>Well, Montagu?</i>

278
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,293
The reason for choosing Spain, sir...

279
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,296
is that we don't want
the Germans themselves to get the body...

280
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,932
because we don't want it
examined too closely.

281
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,935
But forgive me, even if we could
get over these obvious snags...

282
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,937
surely we're being far too ambitious.

283
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,940
The man might be carrying letters
at a lower level...

284
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,933
but you can't expect the Germans to swallow
fake letters from the vice chief to Gen. Alexander.

285
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,448
<i>From their point of view,</i>
<i>it'd be altogether too good to be true.</i>

286
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,441
Montagu, surely the first question
German intelligence will ask themselves...

287
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,456
is why the letter wasn't sent
through the normal channels...

288
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,825
instead of by this—
this dead gentleman.

289
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,827
It was my intention, sir...

290
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:18,820
to ask for a letter of a personal and private type
from you to General Alexander.

291
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:23,001
It might contain
certain references to other people...

292
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,004
which you would hardly want
to go through ordinary channels.

293
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,607
You mean saying someone important
is a nitwit or something.

294
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,609
- [All Chuckling]
- Yes, sir.

295
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,602
There are, in fact, a number of jokes
already in circulation that might be suitable.

296
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:37,316
Why is this officer flying to Africa?

297
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,818
Where is he going?
What's his job?

298
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,821
We'd like to make him a major
in the Royal Marines, sir...

299
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,657
on your staff at Combined Operations.

300
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,127
He's an expert on landing craft.

301
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,129
You are lending him
to General Eisenhower...

302
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,131
to whom he also carries a letter.

303
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,600
- Oh, I write a letter as well?
- Yes, sir.

304
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,602
He seems to have jobs for all of us.

305
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,605
- Can my letter be rude about somebody too?
- [All Chuckling]

306
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,541
You realize that
if the Germans see through this...

307
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,544
you're pinpointing Sicily
as the place where we <i>are</i> going.

308
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,514
- Quite right.
- We've got a big agenda. We must get on.

309
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,516
This is an imaginative plan...

310
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,352
but obviously it needs careful consideration
or we may do more harm than good.

311
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,355
<i>I think we'd better</i>
<i>leave it for the moment.</i>

312
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:20,348
The time is very short, sir,
and we must get going as soon as possible.

313
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,529
We're aware of that.

314
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,532
We'll put it on the agenda
for the next meeting.

315
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,535
<i>- [Bells Pealing]</i>
<i>- [Sergeant] Attention.!</i>

316
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,538
I have a feeling it would be easier
to convince the Germans...

317
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,540
than it is to persuade our masters.

318
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,543
It's no use losing your temper.
They've got a lot of other things to think about.

319
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,546
Then why can't they make up their minds
and give us a plain yes or no?

320
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,548
They want to mull it over,
quite rightly.

321
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:46,552
You'll just have to be patient. The moment
they agree, if they do, you can go ahead.

322
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:50,545
Till then, you'll just have to wait.

323
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,397
Sticky?

324
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,400
Like trying to swim
through a barrel of syrup.

325
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,403
They just want to stand
and chew their cud...

326
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,406
and gaze into the distance
with big, brown eyes.

327
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,409
What are we supposed to do,
get on with our knitting?

328
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,412
I'll wager that in the end
they won't turn it down.

329
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,415
I'm going to take a chance
and jump the gun.

330
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,417
You go and get a body.

331
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,420
I'll start working out
drawings for a canister.

332
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,423
<i>[Airplanes Passing Overhead]</i>

334
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,928
One engine.

- Larry.
- You all right?

338
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,949
Port engine cracked up,
and Steve's had it.

339
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,951
- Steve?
- Just outside Brussels.

340
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,953
Light flak.
He went down fast.

341
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:58,946
Didn't have time to bail out.

342

343
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,574
Hello?
Hello?

Joe?

345
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,813
I was on my way back.
I saw them come in.

346
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,815
Are you all right, Joey?

347
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,151
I'm all right, baby.
I'm fine.

348
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,153
It was an easy one.

349
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,155
Oh...

350
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,457

353
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,603

- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

358
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:57,104
Montagu, I want you to be at 10 Downing Street
tomorrow morning at 10:30.

359
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,618
Of course, sir.

Tomorrow morning at 10:30.
I'll be there.

All right, Montagu,
you've got the all-clear.

And your submarine's fixed.

Good.
Carry on.

Yes, I'll hold on.

379
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:23,068
George, it's on. We've got the right of way

"Let the plan be implemented!"

May I ask what you're up to?

383
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,079
I've got a socking great blister
on my foot.

384
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,082
I've walked more than 50 miles
in the last two days...

385
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,084
I didn't go to bed at all last night...

386
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,586
and it doesn't matter whether
he shoots it down or not...

387
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,588
because the whole thing
is utterly impracticable.

388
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,590
- What?
- Napoo. Won't go. Not on.

- Hello? Yes.
- Why not?

390
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,595
Because, Monty, there simply
isn't any way of getting a body.

391
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:54,099
You wave an airy hand and say, "George, go and
get a body," as though there was nothing to it.

392
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,101
- Well, you try.
- Nonsense!

393
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,103
There are hospitals,
nursing homes, mortuaries—

394
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,106
- I've tried 'em! Not a hope.
- Is he at the hospital now?

395
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,542
You see, Monty,
every body belongs to somebody...

396
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,044
and it isn't a thing
people want messed about.

397
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,547
What about the fellow
in St. Luke's Hospital?

398
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,049
Changed his mind
at the last moment and recovered.

399
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,052
- Very unreliable type.
- Yes, we'll come round immediately.

400
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,555
- Have you tried Spilsbury?
- Yes, he gets bodies.

401
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,057
But they're special ones that the police
think have been murdered...

402
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,059
and he wants them himself.

403
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,061
- Sir, I think I'm onto something.
- Where?

404
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,063
In a small hospital
in St. John's Wood.

405
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:29,056
I said you'd come and see the father.
There doesn't seem to be anybody else.

406
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,907
- When did he die?
- 3:00 this morning.

407
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,909
- Pneumonia?
- Bronchial pneumonia.

408
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,412
Are there any other relatives
beside the father?

409
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,915
I don't think so. He was an only child,
and I gather the wife's dead.

410
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:47,908
- Is the father with him now?
- He is waiting for you.

411
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,422
You wait here.

412
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:54,415
I think I'd rather
deal with this by myself.

413
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,706
Perhaps you'd like to sit over there
while you're waiting.

414
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,208
- Thank you.
- I'll come back in a few minutes.

415
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:14,201
Right.

416
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,054
It has been explained to you...

417
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,390
that, for reasons of security...

418
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,393
we cannot tell you
why we are asking you this?

419
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:31,396
Yes.
That has been explained.

420
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:35,400
But if there is any question
you wish to ask me, sir...

421
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,237
I will answer it if I can.

422
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:43,230
I'll try not to embarrass you.

423
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:49,748
Can you assure me,
Commander Montagu...

424
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,083
as an officer and a gentleman...

425
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,086
that if I agree to your request...

426
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:59,079
my son's body will be treated decently
and with respect?

427
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,594
I give you my word.

428
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:06,298
His name will never be revealed?

429
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:09,100
Never.

430
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,102
And finally...

431
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,105
his body will have Christian burial?

432
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:17,208
I cannot absolutely promise that...

433
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:21,201
but I am fairly certain of it.

434
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,785
I was never the one...

435
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,788
nor was he...

436
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:33,781
to mind very much about
the last resting place of the body...

437
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,852
being more concerned
with the repose of the spirit.

438
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,968
But still...

439
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:46,972
I would like to be sure
that this thing you are going to do...

440
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,808
is good...

441
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:53,178
and worthy of him.

442
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,513
I can assure you that...

443
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:59,506
this is an opportunity for your son
to do a great thing for England.

444
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,355
My son, sir, was a Scotsman...

445
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:07,348
and very proud of it.

446
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,028
I beg your pardon.

447
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,397
Never mind.

448
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,399
We're used to that.

449
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:18,392
You English always talk about England
when you mean Britain.

450
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:32,906
Good-bye, son.

451
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:36,688
I don't know what they want with you...

452
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:40,558
but it doesn't matter now...

453
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,894
because...

454
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:46,498
you're not here anymore.

455
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,633
You're somewhere else...

456
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:52,626

00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,674
Good day to you.

458
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,088
I have no son now...

459
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:14,081
but you have a body.

460
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,744
I think William Martin
is a good name.

461
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,746
One naval identity card...

462
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:38,283
in the name of
Captain, Acting Major, William Martin...

463
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,285
Royal Marines.

464
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,621
Born in Cardiff, 1907.

465
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:47,614
I thought of Glasgow,
but I don't want to say he's a Scot.

466
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,929
Also, a combined Operations Headquarters
pass in the same name.

467
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,666
You'll need a photograph of him, sir,
for the identity card.

468
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,668
So we shall.

469
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,671
It's only a passport photograph.
It needn't look like him.

470
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,607
Now, we need various articles
to go in his pockets—

471
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,609
cigarettes, matches, bunch of keys—

472
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,112
- What's he carrying the documents in?
- Briefcase.

473
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,114
But he's floating in the water.

474
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,616
Has he got it in his hand, or what?

475
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,619
What about one of those things
that bank messengers have?

476
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:18,590
Goes around the waist, comes down
the sleeve and clips onto the briefcase.

477
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,592
Get one, and we'll see.

478
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,595
And he'll have to have
a wallet, money, wristwatch.

479
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,597
- George.
- Hmm?

480
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,600
I think we're attacking this
the wrong way round.

481
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,870
Wallet, money, wristwatch,
they're all right and necessary.

482
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,373
But, after all,
he must have had some private life.

483
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,377
There ought to be something
more intimate on him when they find him.

484
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:43,181
Personal things like photographs
or maybe some private letters.

485
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,451
I'll tell you what. He'd better have
a girlfriend with a love letter from her.

486
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,454
That's a good idea, but we'll have
to make it really convincing.

487
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,557
Hmm.

488
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,659
We'll get Pam to write it for us.

489
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,661
You wouldn't mind, would you?

490
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,164
<i>[Montagu]</i>
<i>Would you have a go at it, Pam?</i>

491
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:03,157
I'll do anything I can
to help with the work, sir.

492
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:14,735
- Hang on a minute. I'll be back.
<i>- Okay, sir.</i>

493
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:28,092
I won't come up, Lu.
There isn't time.

494
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:31,095
All right.

495
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,097
Good-bye, Joey.

496
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:36,034
Now, remember, you're my girl now.
Official.

497
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:40,027
I won't ever forget.

00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,542
Hi, Pam.
How goes it?

502
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,544
Little bit tired.

503
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,546
Pam, I've got some news for you...

504
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,549
and maybe it's going
to make you angry.

505
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,051
Tell me later, Lucy,
when I've done this.

506
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,053
Okay.
I'll go make some coffee.

507
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,556
It's already done.
It's on the hot plate.

508
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,559
That's what I like about you—
you're so inefficient.

509
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,552
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

510
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,935
"Dearest Willie"?

511
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,938
Have you ever tried writing? That's the
greatest opening I've ever heard in my life.

512
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,940
Don't fool.
It isn't a real letter.

513
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,942
It's just something I've got to do.

514
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:54,112
Love letters are always something
you've got to do. What's it for then?

515
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,115
It's part of a story
I've got to make up.

516
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:01,108
Well, let me help you. I'm completely
undiscovered and cheap. My work, I mean.

517
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,855
- What's the story?
- Oh, it's very ordinary.

518
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,857
They've just got engaged.

519
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,359
He's going off on a dangerous job...

520
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,361
and she's writing to him.

521
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,363
Oh, that one.

522
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,866
It's the start that's sticking me.

523
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:18,102
"Dearest Willie—"
His name's Willie Martin.

524
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,104
"It was lovely seeing you."

525
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,107
Willie Martin.
What a name.

526
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:27,100
"Dearest Willie."

527
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:33,707
Take dictation.

528
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,792
Darling...

529
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,261
when you went away tonight...

530
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,464
something went with you.

531
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,934
<i>I think it must have been my heart...</i>

532
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,927
<i>because now I'm cold and empty.</i>

533
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,575
It's always bad when you go away...

534
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,811
but it was worse tonight...

535
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,804
because the day was so good.

536
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,118
You shouldn't have bought the ring...

537
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,687
and I knew you shouldn't.

538
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:12,757
And you did because you love me...

539
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:16,561
and I let you because I love you.

540
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:20,554
There isn't much more than that
to be had from any day.

541
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:23,267
<i>I won't wear it, darling.</i>

542
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:26,004
I told you I wouldn't.

543
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,206
Because if I did...

544
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,708
that would mean that you were real...

545
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,710
that you belonged to me...

546
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,114
and that they couldn't
take you away from me...

547
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:39,250
whereas now they can send you away...

548
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:43,243
and leave me to wonder
if I'll ever see you again...

549
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,257
or whether I may wake up...

550
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:49,694
and find I'd dreamed you.

551
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,929
[Gasps]

552
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,932
Maybe there'll be a time
when it's all over...

553
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:58,636
and you're still there
and real and lovely.

554
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,672
Then I'll put your ring on
and wear it...

555
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:05,665
and wear it until I die.

556
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,903
Oh, God, darling,
take care of yourself.

557
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:14,485
As if you ever could or would.

558
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:17,321
I suppose I mean...

559
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,324
O God, take care of you.

560
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,860
I love you.

561
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,853
I love you.

562
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,103
This is really wonderful, Pam.

563
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,105
I had no idea you were a writer.

564
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,607
- I'm afraid I didn't do it, sir.
- Oh?

565
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:13,111
A friend of mine did it.
I only altered a word here and there.

566
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,113
That's why I've signed it Lucy.

567
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,615
- You didn't tell her anything.
- Of course not.

568
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,118
- She did it just for fun?
- Yes, sir.

569
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,120
- Just for fun.
- Good.

570
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,622
- Oh, George, have you seen this?
- Yes.

571
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,625
- I always told you there were hidden depths.
- Mr. Acres, I have—

572
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,628
Never mind, my dear.
It happens to the nicest people.

573
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:34,465
Oh, by the way, I fixed the letter
from the bank about Willie's overdraft.

574
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,467
The manager was very helpful.

575
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,769
- I told him just enough.
- Fine.

576
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:42,273
Tell me, does this alleged girlfriend of yours
wear thick spectacles?

577
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,275
No.

578
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,777
- Reasonably good to look at?
- Very.

579
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,480
Ah, then we want her photograph
for Willie's wallet.

580
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,473
- It doesn't have to be her photograph.
<i>- Oh, don't spoil it, Monty.</i>

581
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:57,544
I want to see
this passionate Lucy creature.

582
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,991
<i>What are you doing?</i>

583
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,984
It's got to look as though
it's been in his pocket for several days.

584
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,465
Can we get a snap of this girl?

585
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,467
- I should think so, sir.
- Good.

586
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,469
Now about dates.

587
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:14,972
There's got to be something on him
that will show when he left.

588
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:18,776
I think I can fix to get a receipted bill
from the Naval and Military Club.

589
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,778
He stayed there on his last night.

590
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,281
And he went to the theater.
Final celebration.

591
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,783
He has the stubs of the tickets
in his pocket.

592
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,819
Item: Two theater tickets
for the night of...

593
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,821
April 22.

594
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,823
- Dress circle.
- Make it four.

595
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,825
And for something worth seeing.

596
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,828
And what's going on
in that bright little mind?

597
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,831
You've got to buy the tickets anyway,
and Willie can't use them.

598
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,833
We might as well.

599
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,836
There are three of us already,
and with Pam's alleged girlfriend—

600
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,838
I understand, dear chap.
Mmm.

601
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,831
Make it four.

602
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,846
I've hacked it about a bit,
as we agreed.

603
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:59,850
It now reads, "General,
the Honorable Sir Harold R.O.G. Alexander.

604
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,221
"My dear Alex, I am taking advantage
of this opportunity...

605
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,991
"to send you a personal letter
by hand of one of Mountbatten's officers...

606
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:10,161
to put you in the picture regarding
our intention in the Mediterranean."

607
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:13,030
- Good.
<i>- Then comes the personal stuff.</i>

608
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,023
Then, "The plan is that the 5th
and 56th divisions will be reinforced...

609
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,771
and form the main force
for the attack on Greece."

610
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,274
Then a lot about possible landing points.

611
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:26,377
Then,

I do hope you'll be comfortable.

920
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:42,044
I expect you'd like a cup of tea, wouldn't you?
I can make you one quite easily.

921
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:45,781
Oh, no, thank you.
I'll just get on and unpack my things.

Oh, don't worry.
I'll be very careful.

In case you should want to be out late in the
evening, I'll put the key on the hall table.

928
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:09,538
And if there's anything else you want, just call
"coo-ee" over the banisters and I'll pop up.

Yes, with pinstripes
right through it, if we can.

935

Thank you very much, sir.
Good morning.

936
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:22,193
- Good morning, sir.
- Uh, um, I'd like some khaki shirts, please.

937
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:25,674
- Made to measure or ready-made, sir?
- Ready-made.

938
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:29,667
- Collar size?
- Sixteen.

939
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:33,515
I think you'll like these, sir.

940
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,085
They're very fine poplin.
Practically prewar quality.

941
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:38,821
- Oh, yes, yes. They're very nice indeed.
- It's a beautiful shirt, sir.

942
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:41,690
- But they're not really the ones I had in mind.
- No, sir?

943
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,327
No, you sold some to a friend of mine
a few weeks ago.

944
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:48,731
Um, Major William Martin
of the Royal Marines.

945
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:52,724
- They were cotton with separate collars.
- I know the one you mean.

946
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,740
Just take a look at those, will you, sir?

947
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,743
Separate collars. Cotton.

948
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:02,745
- Oh, good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

949
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:06,738
- Won't keep you a moment.
- Right.

950
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:10,652
- Yes, these look like the ones.
- Good, sir.

951
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,955
But I'm not quite sure.

952
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:16,948
Uh, would it be troubling you too much
to look up Major Martin's account—

953
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:19,595
Look, sir, if your friend
got his shirts from us...

954
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:22,498
and if they were cotton with separate collars,
those are certainly the ones.

955
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:26,068
- We haven't any others in stock.
- Oh.

956
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:29,438
Well, I'll not doubt the word
of an honest man.

957
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:33,431
- I'll take two.
- Thank you very much, sir.

958
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:37,179
<i>- So I said to this chap, if you can't let us have</i>—
- Excuse me.

959
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:40,616
- Is this the Naval and Military Club?
- Yes, that's right.

01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:43,852

Major William Martin
of the Royal Marines.

968
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,187
I believe he's a member here.

969
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:21,089
Do you happen to have seen him lately
or know his whereabouts?

970
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:24,526
Major Martin.
There's a Major Martin who's a gunner, sir.

971
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:28,497
[Chuckling] No, that'd hardly be him.
He's in the Royal Marines.

972
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,732
- Eh?
- The Royal Marines!

973
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:33,302
I don't think I know
the gentleman personally, sir.

Is he a regular officer or temporary?

01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:38,106
Oh, now, there I couldn't be sure.

976
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:40,909
If he's a temporary,
I probably shouldn't know him, sir.

977
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:44,246
There's a lot of members now

982
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:00,963
- Now, surely that's odd if he's a member.
- Eh?

983
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:04,933
- Surely that's odd if he's a member!
- Not necessarily, sir.

we're a bit behind with things these days.

he may not be on the file yet.

My name is Phillips, and I'm making

I'm trying to help clear up his affairs.

1011
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:03,485
I see.

1012
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:07,478
I'm sure you'll understand it's an absolute rule
of the bank not to discuss a client's affairs...

with anyone
but his accredited representatives.

1014
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,028
Certainly not on the telephone.

1015
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:15,597
But I am onto the right branch,
I take it.

1016
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:19,534
I should have thought the best thing
would be if you could drop in and see me.

1017
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:23,527
I'm pretty full up this morning,
but this afternoon's all right...

1018
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:28,432
if you'd like to come in at, say,
quarter past 2:00 and ask for me.

1019
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:32,981
Yes. Yes, I suppose
that would be a good idea.

1020
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:35,717
- A quarter past 2:00.
- Yes.

1021
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:39,710
All right.

1022
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:58,373
You were very smart
to get this, Mr. Emberton.

1023
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:01,276
My secretary often takes notes
of important calls.

1024
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:03,345
You say he had a slight accent?

1025
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:06,415
Yes, but, uh, not a foreign accent,
if you follow me.

1026
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:08,817
It's difficult to tell on the telephone.

1027
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:11,553
I should have said he was English,
but possibly from the west country.

1028
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:14,122
- Did you trace the call?
- It came from a public telephone booth.

1029
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:17,693
Obviously, yet when you
suggested an appointment, he agreed.

1030
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,529
He agreed, but he didn't sound
particularly enthusiastic.

1031
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:23,432
Is there any chance
that this might be a coincidence?

1032
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:27,202
William Martin is quite a common name.
He may have just mistaken the bank.

1033
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:29,504
- It's possible, but—
- But not probable.

1034
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:33,175
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Emberton.
You've handled the whole thing beautifully.

1035
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:35,744
Frankly, I don't think
the man will turn up.

1036
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:39,481
However, we can't afford to take any chances.
We'll both be back at 2:00.

1037
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:43,485
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Thank you.

1038
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:46,354
- He's a good chap.
- Very good.

1039
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:50,347
Look, George, if there's somebody around
who can ring up Willie Martin's bank...

1040
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:54,418
it means thatJerry's putting the whole thing
under a microscope.

1041
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:58,723
Now, where, if anywhere,
is there a weak link?

1042
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:04,995
I'm going to Scotland Yard to talk
to General Colbourne of the special branch.

1043
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:09,811
Of course, a voice from a telephone booth
isn't much of a starting point.

1044
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:11,813
I realize that, sir.

1045
01:19:11,813 --> 01:19:15,806
I wondered whether you'd had any ripple on
the waters recently that might give us a line.

1046
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:18,520
I don't think so.

1047
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,289
There's a gentleman just arrived from Sweden
we're rather interested in...

1048
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:23,825
but he's nothing to do
with your Major Martin.

1049
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:27,763
It's certain he won't come to the bank, but we'd
better have a couple of your men just in case.

1050
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:30,632
Yes, of course.
We must certainly be in on it.

1051
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:33,535
We always like to make
a new friend if we can.

1052
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:35,937
Besides, you may be wrong.
He may turn up.

1053
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:38,507
My guess is that he's only over here
for this one job.

1054
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:41,076
He knows we haven't
got our tabs on him.

1055
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:45,069
He's the sort of man

if you send your men to the house...

you will arrest one spy,

No, sir.
