A letter from the publisher
and a check.

460
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:19,884
It isn't very much,
but it's a check.

461
00:40:20,076 --> 00:40:22,857
- Everything's gonna work out all right.
- What will, darling?

462
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:24,967
All of it.

463
00:40:27,748 --> 00:40:29,762
Say, what'd old sawbones say?

464
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,448
Nothing frightful?
Didn't pick up a fever?

465
00:40:32,735 --> 00:40:34,653
- No, I--
- What did I tell you?

466
00:40:34,749 --> 00:40:38,298
All you need's a change of climate.
We'll go directly to Madrid.

467
00:40:38,585 --> 00:40:40,983
We'll have the bullfights,
the Grecos at del Prado...

468
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:43,381
then up to Pamplona
in time for the fiesta.

469
00:40:43,572 --> 00:40:46,354
- Harry.
- Luckiest timing in the world.

470
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:49,135
Darling, couldn't we just go home?

471
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:51,341
Home?

472
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,451
Where's that?

473
00:40:53,546 --> 00:40:55,560
You mean back to Paris.

474
00:40:55,848 --> 00:40:59,493
Well, why?

475
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:01,698
Just to go home.

476
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,575
Look, darling, we can get
a nice apartment with the check...

477
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:06,685
with a room for you to work in.

478
00:41:06,877 --> 00:41:08,891
You don't have to go
to Spain, do you?

479
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:11,768
No, darling, I don't
have to go to Spain...

480
00:41:12,056 --> 00:41:13,974
or anyplace else.

481
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,988
You just want to.

482
00:41:18,482 --> 00:41:23,756
Look, Cynthia, if I have to sound
like a lousy stiff that had a mission.

483
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,168
I'm trying to become a writer.

484
00:41:30,086 --> 00:41:32,292
It's a writer's business
to buzz around...

485
00:41:32,484 --> 00:41:34,785
find out about things for himself...

486
00:41:34,977 --> 00:41:38,525
not sit on his can in a comfortable chair
and reach for a bookcase...

487
00:41:38,813 --> 00:41:40,731
for something to crib from.

488
00:41:40,923 --> 00:41:42,745
And after Spain?

489
00:41:44,663 --> 00:41:46,485
How do we know?

490
00:41:46,677 --> 00:41:50,513
I mean, you never want
this other normal thing?

491
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:53,678
I'm trying to explain
what is my normal thing.

492
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,172
- With maybe children?
- Children?

493
00:41:56,364 --> 00:41:59,624
Darling, I want a child
more than anything in the world.

494
00:41:59,912 --> 00:42:02,022
Something of my very own
to hold on to.

495
00:42:02,214 --> 00:42:05,762
Well! Well, sure.
[ Chuckling ]

496
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,352
I love kids, but later.

497
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,612
We've got lots of time.

498
00:42:11,804 --> 00:42:15,736
Look, Cyn, the world is a market...

499
00:42:16,024 --> 00:42:18,134
in which you buy
what you want--

500
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:21,490
not just with money, but with your time,
with a lot of things.

501
00:42:21,682 --> 00:42:25,998
It's an exchange.
You give something, and you get something.

502
00:42:26,286 --> 00:42:28,971
I'm giving up a piece of my life...

503
00:42:29,163 --> 00:42:31,656
to get something
that I need for my work.

504
00:42:31,848 --> 00:42:35,876
Later on, we can afford what we can afford.
It's as simple as that.

505
00:42:36,164 --> 00:42:37,986
I see.

506
00:42:39,233 --> 00:42:41,151
Can I fix you a drink?

507
00:42:43,452 --> 00:42:45,562
It's a little bit early, isn't it?

508
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:49,878
It seems to me to be just about
the right time. Do you object?

509
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,084
No.

510
00:42:54,002 --> 00:42:57,071
Look, Cyn, if you have
this yen to go to Paris...

511
00:42:57,263 --> 00:42:59,756
well, you can go there.

512
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:03,017
Without you?

513
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:05,798
I'm not saying that I want it.

514
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:09,059
I'm just saying
that you can go there.

515
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,772
Or if--

516
00:43:17,786 --> 00:43:20,376
If it's a matter
of life and death...

517
00:43:20,663 --> 00:43:22,965
okay, I'll go with you.

518
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:42,721
I'll go change the tickets.

- How do you do? How is she?

524
00:44:32,591 --> 00:44:35,756
I'm sorry to have to tell you
she lost the child.

- The what?
- You didn't know, Mr. Street?

526
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:45,059
Exactly what happened?

527
00:44:45,346 --> 00:44:49,183
They told me at the hotel that there'd ...
been an accident. That's all.

528
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:53,594
A nasty fall. She'll be quite all right
after a few days' rest.

529
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:57,334
Do you actually mean
you didn't know about the child?

530
00:44:57,622 --> 00:45:00,595
Don't you people talk to each other?

531
00:45:15,844 --> 00:45:18,337
You did it deliberately.

532
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:21,215
- It was an accident.
- You did it because of what I said.

533
00:45:21,406 --> 00:45:23,612
It was an accident.
I stumbled.

534
00:45:25,914 --> 00:45:28,695
You didn't have any right to do it.

535
00:45:32,627 --> 00:45:34,833
It was my child too, you know.

All right. The dancer likes you.

Darling, you don't want to be childish.
You've read it.

- It meant that I'm beginning

You've got to forget that.

Yes, I ought to forget.

584
00:49:17,906 --> 00:49:20,399
I ought to just go back

and not drive myself crazy at all
while I wait for you and wait and wait.

Don't you even know you're lying?

- I'm not lying.
- No.

No, it isn't a lie yet.

589
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:35,936
It won't be a lie until you go away
and discover you're not coming back...

00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,909
but are going on and on
and see the whole world...

even if you lose it for us.

You know, I think this dancer
likes me very much.

00:49:44,663 --> 00:49:47,156
All right, the dancer
likes you very much.

594
00:49:47,348 --> 00:49:50,033
It ought to make me very happy.

595
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:53,102
It makes me feel dreadful.

00:49:53,294 --> 00:49:55,596
Shall we invite him
over to the table?

597
00:49:55,788 --> 00:49:58,569
Do you think his manners
would be as nice as yours?

598
00:49:58,857 --> 00:50:01,446
Do you think he'd ask me first
if I'm Harry's lady?

Women can pick the times
to start a row.

600
00:50:05,474 --> 00:50:08,447
It's not a row, darling.
It's very sad.

601
00:50:09,981 --> 00:50:13,146
You with your ambition,
me with my guilt.

602
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:16,503
A lot of things are sad.

603
00:50:16,695 --> 00:50:19,572
Why do they put the pads on the horses
in the bullfights?

604
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:23,312
- I've told you that.
- Tell me again.

605
00:50:23,504 --> 00:50:27,052
It isn't so the horses
won't feel the hurt, is it?

606
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,258
It's only for the spectators...

607
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,944
so they won't see
the horses' insides.

608
00:50:32,135 --> 00:50:35,012
Yes, it is for the protection
of the spectators.

609
00:50:35,204 --> 00:50:37,026
I knew you wouldn't like the horses.

610
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:39,328
But I desperately like the horses.

611
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,548
I know just how the horses feel,
with their nice pads to protect

612
00:50:43,836 --> 00:50:46,905
You ought to put some pads
on me to protect you, poor darling.

613
00:50:47,096 --> 00:50:50,357
Cynthia, will you kindly,
kindly, kindly stop?
