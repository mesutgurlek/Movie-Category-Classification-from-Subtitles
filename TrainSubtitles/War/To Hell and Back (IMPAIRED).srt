00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:54,821
Armies, for the most part,

6
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:58,484
are made up of men drawn
from simple and peaceful lives.

7
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:00,823
In time of war,
they suddenly find themselves...

8
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:03,090
living under conditions
of violence,

9
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:07,100
requiring new rules of conduct
that are in direct contrast...

10
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,103
to the conditions
they lived under as civilians.

11
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:14,938
They learn to accept this
and to perform their duties
as fighting men.

12
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:19,105
But some begin to perform,
as military language puts it,

13
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,617
"at the risk of life,
above and beyond
the call of duty."

14
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:28,622
Military histories are filled
with incredible examples
of individual courage...

15
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,287
that are only made more
incredible by the fact that
they were everyday events.

16
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:38,958
As Senior Staff Officer
at Supreme Headquarters
in World War II,

17
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,969
it was my privilege to know
the records of many such men.

18
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:46,302
The story you are
about to see is theirs:

19
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,467
The true story
of the foot soldier,

20
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:52,809
as seen through the eyes
of one of them, Audie L. Murphy.

21
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,146
He received
every decoration for valor
that his country could award,

22
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,813
and he became
the most decorated soldier
for combat action...

23
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:04,255
in the military history
of the United States.

26

I don't suppose you girls have
had time to fill the wood box.
Uh-uh, Audie.

27
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:55,574
Hey, Audie, look at me!

28
00:03:55,643 --> 00:04:00,637
Get off that woodpile,
Preston. Do you want
to break a leg?

29
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:03,741
Did you get another
rabbit today, Audie?

30
00:04:03,818 --> 00:04:06,252
Yeah.
Now you come with me.

31
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:11,917
You sit down
right over there.

32
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:16,592
You watch that
until I get back, okay?
Okay.

33
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:18,757
It'll keep you
off the woodpile.

34
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,427

He said he'd get
the window fixed.

37
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:30,643
- That's good of him.
- He was askin' about Pa.

38

No word today.

Hi, Mr. Brooks!
Hi!

43
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,639
[Mrs. Murphy]
Any mail for us today,
Mr. Brooks?

44
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:06,236
Nothing today,
Mrs. Murphy. Sorry.

45
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:10,080
Thank you.
Maybe tomorrow.
Bye.

46
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:15,744
Why does Mom
get so worried
when no mail comes?

47
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:18,087
Because
we got no money.

48
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,266
Here, take these
to the house.
Where are you goin'?

49
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:29,235
I just made my mind up
about something.

50

Hi, Mrs. Huston.
Hello, Audie.

55
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:55,792
Sir, I know you don't
hire any steady help
except at picking time,

56
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:58,195
but could you give me
a full-time job?

57
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,530
A full-time job?

58
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:05,402
I wouldn't want much money,
and you could keep half until
we pay back what we owe you.

59
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:10,069

<i>I wanted to talk to you</i>
<i>before I said anything to her.</i>

60
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:14,046
It's not right.
Why, you'd have
to quit school.

61
00:06:14,115 --> 00:06:17,107
Yes, ma'am,
but I need the money.

62

What about your sister
in Farmersville?
Can't she help?
Edna.

63
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:26,926
Corinne's helped all she can,
but, well, she's got a family
of her own to take care of.

You can't do it, Ben.
This is man's talk.

go to the house,

I never finished school neither.

68
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:47,106
A couple years older than you,
I quit to go in the Marines
when we was in the big war.

<i>Sometimes I wish</i>
<i>I'd stayed in.</i>

70

Probably be retired by now
on more money than I make
out of the farm.

71
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,158
Now about that job...

72
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:02,757
I guess the best thing to do
is leave it to your ma.

to go to school.

I don't like it anymore.

00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:16,608
after taking care
of your family
all these years,

146
00:12:16,677 --> 00:12:19,441
but look at it another way.

147
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:22,607
You've got
no responsibilities left now,
except to yourself.

148
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:24,776
It's time
you were thinking
about your future.

149
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:29,516
I have been. That's what
I wanted to tell you.

150
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,616
After all the talk you and I
had about it, I've decided
to go into the service.

151
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:34,786
I was hoping
you'd say that.

152
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:37,956
It'll be a great chance
for you to catch up
on your education.

153
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:43,493
Yeah. The only thing is,
I hate running out on the kids.
They've had enough of that.

154
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,337
You can do more for 'em
with your service pay than
you can by staying here.

155
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:51,867
I guess I hadn't
thought of it that way.

156
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:55,848
Course, being under age,
you'll have to get
a letter of permission.

157
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:59,647
I'll get Corinne
to write one for me.

158
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,746
Good-bye, Mr. Huston.
Thanks.

159
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:06,088
If I were you, Audie,
I'd think about it
for a career.

160
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,425
You stay in 20 years,
and you can retire
on good money.

161
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:12,932
Don't make the mistake
that I made. I might
have been a general...

162
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,764
Yes, sir.
I'll remember that.

163
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:23,102
It'll take more than a letter
from your guardian to get you
in this outfit, sonny.

164
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,772
We separate the men
from the boys, but we like
to have something to start with.

165
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,613
Why don't you
try the Army?
[Others Laugh]

166
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,956
I'm sorry.
The Navy makes men
out of boys,

167
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,458
but you're too much
of a job for us.

168

close to the river and dig in.

Gentlemen, our mission here
is a diversionary one.

We're to make the enemy
think that the main effort
will take place here.

437
00:34:37,683 --> 00:34:40,777
Actually, the 7 th Regiment
will be the attacking force.

438
00:34:40,853 --> 00:34:42,946
They'll go across
upriver from us.

will start things off.

440

in Perth Amboy, New Jersey.

441
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:06,407

She was a beautiful thing.

Be more natural if he opened up.

445

Why open up tonight
and get ten of us...

446
00:35:25,698 --> 00:35:28,599
when they can catch a hundred
in the middle of the river?

About my little girl,
my ex-wife.

452
00:35:54,226 --> 00:35:58,162
Sometimes I think I got
my mind rid of her, but...

453
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,290
when it gets quiet like this,
she keeps coming back.

Then the baby came.

457
00:36:12,178 --> 00:36:17,445
I had to give up school
and work full-time.

458
00:36:17,516 --> 00:36:22,954
I began blamin' them for all
the big things that I'd planned
that weren't pannin' out.

459
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:25,115

I sure did.

462
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:36,524
Did she get married again?

I don't know why,
but she hasn't yet.

464

Sounds like maybe you ought
to try patching things up
when you get back home.

there's nothing between us
