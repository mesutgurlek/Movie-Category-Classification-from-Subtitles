When you want to take down
a government from the inside,

61
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,520
there's a pretty standard
formula.

62
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,155
First, you put the leadership
in a position where

63
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,023
they have to make immensely
unpopular decisions.

64
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,193
Like Ration cards, bank closures.
And you start a few riots,

65
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,794
force the President
to put them down

66

and broadcast the violence.

67
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,864
Finally,
you manufacture a crisis.

68
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,699
Like an assassination
or a hostage situation.

This too tight? Good.

645
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:32,616
So, I take it
I answer to you now, CNO?

646
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:34,384
No.

647
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:39,022
You answer to him,
just like I do.

648
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,390
Commander in Chief!

649
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:43,293
Man: Attention!

650
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:57,574
We'll need to give them
the oath.

651
00:37:57,576 --> 00:38:01,278
They're rejoining the service
of the United States.

652
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:04,981
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

653
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:16,493

654

[ Grunts ]

655
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,584
[ Scoffs ]

656
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:17,220
Tom Chandler.

657
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:21,791
Saved America from the virus,
and they loved you for it.

658
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,727
Then they got hungry.

659
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:29,999
They miss things like heat,
clean water, and Wi-Fi.

660
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:33,503
They don't have any time
for heroes now.

661
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:35,705
So do your victory dance,

662
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,708
and when the filthy masses
turn against you,

663
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,009
give me a call.

664
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,712
I'll show you
how to keep them in line.

665
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:46,149
But I will never cooperate.

666
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:48,685
Here's the deal, Manuel...

667
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:52,021
From here on out,
you no longer get to decide

668
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,691
what you will and will not do.

669
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:59,929
See, you had the chance
to kill me, again,

670
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:02,699
and you blew it...

671
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:05,068
again.

672
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,004
So you will cooperate.

673
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:10,540
And why is that?

674
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:14,377
Your army turned on you
without hardly a shot fired.

675
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,379
Once your partners find out
you lost control

676
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:18,415
of your region and Beatty's...

677
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:22,285
They will cut you out
like the cancer you are.

678
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:26,689
And let's not underestimate
the "filthy masses."

679
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:29,092
Once they hear
what you're really about,

680
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:32,562
you'll need more than an army
to keep them in line.

681
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:39,769
But we can always drop
you back off at the depot,

682
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,638
see for ourselves.

683
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:49,379
Witt: He must have commandeered
a Chinese destroyer back in Asia

684
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:51,614
and then navigated it
through the channel remotely.

685
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,584
We need to warn Castillo,
ma'am.

686
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:57,220
It's too late. By now,
Chandler already has him.

687
00:40:57,222 --> 00:41:00,256
He may be Navy,
but he's a badass.

688
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,791
Shut up, will you?

689
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:08,198
[ Sighing ] I need to think.

690
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,641
[ Exhales sharply ]
