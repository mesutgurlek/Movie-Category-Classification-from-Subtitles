And there's no one I trust more.

644
00:35:53,157 --> 00:35:54,857
Sounds like an order.

645
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:56,575
It is.

646
00:35:56,577 --> 00:36:00,590
Tonight we rest and enjoy our success.

647
00:36:00,729 --> 00:36:03,217
Tomorrow, the fight for America

648
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:05,409
and the rest of the world begins.

649
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,091
All right, it was Christmas Eve.

650
00:36:12,093 --> 00:36:14,176
We're doing this anti-piracy mission

651
00:36:14,178 --> 00:36:16,095
off the coast of Somalia.

652
00:36:16,097 --> 00:36:19,215
We come across this poor
Hungarian freighter...

653
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:23,018
engine problems, 50-person
crew, nowhere to go.

654
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,055
Frankie and I were... were running point.

655
00:36:26,057 --> 00:36:27,627
Meanwhile, back on our ship,

656
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:31,777
our mail arrives from home...
presents from our families.

657
00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:33,896
Frankie turns to me, and he says,

658
00:36:33,898 --> 00:36:36,232
"what about the Hungarians?

659
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:38,651
Don't they get a Christmas?"

660
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:42,404
And I'm like, "Frankie, like,
this is a hostile situation."

661
00:36:42,406 --> 00:36:46,325
But he's not hearing it, not for a second.

662
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:47,828
30 minutes later,

663
00:36:47,853 --> 00:36:50,546
our helo is hovering
over that Hungarian ship.

664
00:36:50,548 --> 00:36:53,297
Frankie is fast-roping down,
dressed as Santa Claus...

He did.

He also included me in his pardon.
