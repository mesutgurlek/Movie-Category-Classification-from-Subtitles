You know what you said.

What, do you like the guy?
You find him attractive?

For chrissakes,

Look, i hate to disturb
mr. Vitale when he's busy.

346
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:25,839
Does anyone here

00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,778
Michael, finally.

351
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,313
Gina keeps telling me
how busy you are,

352
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:37,516
But, uh, hey,
better late than never.

353
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:38,884
Right.

354
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:40,385
So, did you meet
everyone?

355
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:41,552
Yeah, i think so.

356
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:42,553
Vinnie.
How you doing?

This is uncle vito.

359
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:47,089
A pleasure.

360
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:50,392
Likewise. So are you
mostly family, then?

361
00:15:52,963 --> 00:15:55,029
Mostly.
Ah.

[plays the pointer sisters'

363
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,598
You two should talk.

364
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,433
Right.
Good, good, good.

365
00:16:00,435 --> 00:16:01,400

Thanks.

368
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,137
Look, mr. Vitale,

369
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,338
It's really nice
to meet you at last,

370
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,605
But i actually
just dropped by

371
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:09,939
To ask you
a question.

372
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:11,974
Is that right?
A question?

373
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:15,177
I think i have an idea
what that question might be.

374
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,712
But if we're gonna
do this right,

375
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:18,879
Don't you think

376
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:20,080
We should get to
know each other first?

377
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:24,083
Uh, yeah.
I suppose so.

378
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,686
You know something,
michael?

379
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:30,955
I think
i'm gonna like you.

380
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:34,458
I believe very deeply
in first impressions.

381
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,059

Yeah, down the hall there.
You can't miss it.

You recognize this person?

00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:26,920
The best student they ever had.

411
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:29,255
Here she is with her mother.

412

Gina has her eyes,
you'll notice.

413

About a week after this,

414
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:37,194
Her mother passed away.

And a week after that,
gina was back at school

Who knows exactly how
she deserves to be treated.

About what happened
tonight.

I knew.

for my daughter's hand.

have to do this?

was perfect.

to go and ruin it?

I didn't mean to.

460

00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,310
I don't understand.
Are you saying

498
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,079
Your dad's some kind
of mob caterer?

499
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:35,551
My father was in prison
till i was 8, michael.

500
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:37,553
He's one of them.

501
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:46,060
Wow.

502
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:50,497
Just keep walking.

503
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:55,568
I should have told you
months ago,

504
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,637
Or just walked away.
Normally i would have,

505
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:00,905
But i couldn't
because i was so happy.

506
00:23:00,907 --> 00:23:03,474
Listen. I don't want
to marry your father.

507
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:06,043
But you will, michael,
whether you like it or not.

508
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:07,611
Him and his friends.

509
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:09,913
And i can't let that happen
to you because i love you,

510
00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:12,849
And everything they touch
ends up spoiled and corrupted.

511
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,617
Wait a minute.
This is ridiculous.

512
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:18,454
For a start, i might
not be corruptible.

513
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:21,457
It's a little favor,
a tiny lie, and you're theirs.

514
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:24,026
Believe me,
i've seen it.

515
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,061
I'm sorry, it's just...

516
00:23:26,063 --> 00:23:28,830
It's just over, michael.

517
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,968
Well, no.

518
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:36,436
I'm sorry,

519
00:23:36,438 --> 00:23:37,837
But i've waited all
my life to find someone

520
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:40,306
I love as much
as i love you.

521
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:42,474
I'm just not
gonna let this

522
00:23:42,476 --> 00:23:45,276
Or anyone
come between us.

523
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,713
Not vito the butcher
or vinnie the baker

524
00:23:49,715 --> 00:23:52,248
Or anyone involved in any
kind of food preparation.

525
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,682
That's it.
End of story.

526
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:55,717
But you don't know
how clever they are.

527
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:57,652
No, but you do,
presumably,

528
00:23:57,654 --> 00:24:00,888
And you can tell me.
We can do this together.

529
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:04,858
Completely together?

530
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,159
Completely.

531
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:07,593
I swear.

532
00:24:08,629 --> 00:24:11,363
Now just give in.

533
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:12,764
Marry me.

534
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:18,501
Yeah.

535
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:25,473
Smile.
You're engaged.

536
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:28,476
Great. Now just
gina and michael.

537
00:24:28,478 --> 00:24:29,877
Over here, i think.

538
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:32,112
Man: Happy engagement,
you guys!

539
00:24:32,114 --> 00:24:34,180
Ok, ok.

540
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,347
Say "cheese."

541
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,716
You're right.
He does talk funny.

542
00:24:37,718 --> 00:24:40,251
You're really
getting into this.

543
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:41,685
I know, i know.

544
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:43,653
My therapist suggested it

545
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:46,222
As a way to get over
my little blip.

546
00:24:46,224 --> 00:24:47,256
I know.

547
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:48,523
I think
it's really working.

548
00:24:48,525 --> 00:24:51,292
I feel terrific.
Especially tonight.

549
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:54,861
I am so happy for you guys.

550
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:56,128
Excuse me.

551
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,731
Bad breakup.
Long story.

552
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:01,932
Hey!

553
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:04,167
Let's go say hello
to uncle vito.

554
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,535
Come on.

555
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,270
Here we go.

556
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,138
Hey!

557
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,544
<i>Molto grazie.</i>

558
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:19,946
Hey, uncle vito.

559
00:25:19,948 --> 00:25:21,113
Hey, kid.

560
00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:24,415
Don't you look beautiful.

561
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:25,849
Ah.

562
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:29,152
Always so beautiful.

563
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:30,720
You're like a flower.

564
00:25:30,722 --> 00:25:32,555
Well, you, too,
uncle vito.

565
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:34,623
This is so nice of you.
We were really planning

566
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:35,624
Something much smaller.

567
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:36,825
Oh, yes, thank you.

568
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,259
<i>Niente.</i>

569
00:25:38,261 --> 00:25:40,361
Your school.

570
00:25:40,363 --> 00:25:42,096
How is everything?

571
00:25:42,098 --> 00:25:43,564
It's pretty good.

572
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:46,300
Only 2 shootings
last week.

573
00:25:46,302 --> 00:25:47,934
It's got me sick
with worry.

574
00:25:47,936 --> 00:25:50,436
Why do you want
to worry your father?

575
00:25:50,438 --> 00:25:51,904
You wanna transfer?

576
00:25:51,906 --> 00:25:54,740
I have a friend of a friend
in the supervisor's office.

577
00:25:54,742 --> 00:25:57,042
Thank you.
I'll let you know.

578
00:25:57,044 --> 00:26:00,011
Oh. So...

579
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:01,712
Michael.

580
00:26:02,715 --> 00:26:05,982
Are your family coming
over for the wedding?

581
00:26:05,984 --> 00:26:06,816
No. I, uh--

582
00:26:06,818 --> 00:26:08,083
Michael's
an orphan.

583
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:09,284
He was.

584
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:12,386
I'm sorry to hear that.

585
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:13,587
Mmm.

586
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:15,455
Tell me, michael.

587
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:17,490
I'm interested to know.

588
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,725
Coming from
a foreign culture,

589
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:22,127
You must have
a different perspective

590
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:23,595
On all these killings.

591
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:29,132
Well, um...

592
00:26:30,735 --> 00:26:32,801
Yeah, to speak honestly,

593
00:26:32,803 --> 00:26:35,837
I can't say
i really approve,

594
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,372
But my understanding
is that it's all

595
00:26:38,374 --> 00:26:39,606
Part of your business,

596
00:26:39,608 --> 00:26:41,808
And that people
only get killed

597
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,243
Who bring it
on themselves.

598
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:46,812
Um...

599
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,215
The killings
at gina's high school.

600
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:56,553
I'm against them.

601
00:26:57,822 --> 00:26:59,021
Ah!

602
00:26:59,023 --> 00:27:01,957
Vito, what do you say
we show him around the house?

603
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:10,798
Vito: 250,000.

604
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,299
You think
it's worth that?

605
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:13,566
Well, like i say,

606
00:27:13,568 --> 00:27:15,434
That's the great thing
about an auction.

607
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:16,735
An object is worth

608
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:19,571
Whatever anyone
is willing to pay for it.

609
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:22,073
That's an interesting
perspective.

610
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:23,507
Now...

611
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:26,343
Tell me what you think
of this one.

612
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,613
You like it?

613
00:27:34,517 --> 00:27:38,451
Michael:
Wow. It's very...

614
00:27:38,453 --> 00:27:40,719
Intriguing, isn't it?

615
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:44,522
Tell me, why does jesus
have a machine gun there?

616
00:27:44,524 --> 00:27:46,156
Vito: It's symbolic.

617
00:27:46,158 --> 00:27:47,390
You have to ask johnny.

618
00:27:47,392 --> 00:27:50,459
He does them
as part of his therapy.

619
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:53,428
You have a very
gifted son, vito.

620
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,629
No two ways
about it.

621
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,697
I must say,
i like the way...

622
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:58,498
The blood sort of
oozes out of his--

623
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,399
I like that.

624
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:01,833
[laughs]

625
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:03,734
Yeah. He's a very
talented kid,

626
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:05,135
Wouldn't you say,
michael?

627
00:28:05,137 --> 00:28:08,171
Yes, yes, i think
he certainly has something.

628
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:10,006
<i>Grazie.</i>

629
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:12,708
I'm flattered
that you like it.

630
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,243
Uh, listen, michael.

631
00:28:15,245 --> 00:28:17,111
We should talk.

632
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:20,447
I have friends
in various fields

633
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,614
That would
be delighted

634
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:25,049
To help
a friend of mine.

635
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:26,950
Well, um...

636
00:28:26,952 --> 00:28:28,718
That's extremely kind of you,

637
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,254
But i've always had
this silly thing

638
00:28:32,256 --> 00:28:35,656
About standing on my own
two feet in business.

639
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:37,723
I hope...

640
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:40,258
You understand.

641
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:48,064
Of course.

642
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:51,967
I respect
your feeling.

No. You see,

No, you.
No, you.

00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:20,224
Oh, shut up.

649
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,291
All right.

Talk to helen

Excuse me.
Can i help you?

660
00:30:04,461 --> 00:30:06,761
How much
is this one?

661
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:10,964
On this, the reserve
is 30,000, i think.

00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:13,899
That being, of course,

663
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:16,368
The opening bid
on tonight's auction.

664
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,602
Oh.

665
00:30:17,604 --> 00:30:18,703
Do you have
much experience

666
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:20,304
When it comes
to buying art?

667
00:30:20,306 --> 00:30:25,375
No, but i hear it can be
a good investment.

668
00:30:25,377 --> 00:30:27,377
Yes.

669
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:28,878
My father

670
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,814
Recently died...

671
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,716
And left me some money.

672
00:30:34,718 --> 00:30:36,084
Your father.

673
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:38,453
That must have been
a terrible shock.

674
00:30:38,455 --> 00:30:41,456
You know, if, um...
If you're just looking

675
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:43,057
For something beautiful
to put on your wall,

676
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:44,525
You might like to think
about a mirror.

677
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:46,326
[laughing loudly]

678
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:49,729
Oh...

679
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:51,864
You.

680
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:54,266
I really want a painting.

681
00:30:54,268 --> 00:30:55,267
Yeah.

682
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:56,268
Michael.

683
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,068
Can i have a word?

684
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,936
One moment.
I tell you what.

685
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:01,204
Tonight if there's
a nice painting

686
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:03,072
Going for less than
it's really worth,

687
00:31:03,074 --> 00:31:04,740
Perhaps we could
work out a way

688
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:06,441
In which i could let
you know about it.

689
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:08,709
You mean like a signal?

690
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:09,843
Exactly.

691
00:31:09,845 --> 00:31:11,344
Listen.
I have an important

692
00:31:11,346 --> 00:31:13,512
Potential client
i have to talk to,

693
00:31:13,514 --> 00:31:14,746
So i'm gonna
leave helen here

694
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,180
To work out
the exact details

695
00:31:16,182 --> 00:31:17,347
Of this with you.
Where is he?

696
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:21,050
Not here yet,
but the trucks are.

697
00:31:21,052 --> 00:31:22,451
That means
they're early.

698
00:31:22,453 --> 00:31:25,287
Yeah. Incredible, huh?

699
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:27,055
Fantastic. Ok.

700
00:31:27,057 --> 00:31:28,289
Bye.

701
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,124
Hello.

702
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:32,258
What?

703
00:31:37,964 --> 00:31:39,930
So that's everything.

704
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:41,398
Yes, sir, all 44 pieces.

705
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,001
I just want you to know
if i've said anything

706
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,469
Or done anything
in the past

707
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,504
That in any way offended
you, i'm, uh...

708
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,673
Very deeply sorry.

709
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:53,675
Ah.

710
00:31:53,677 --> 00:31:55,510
Well, uh, thanks.

711
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:04,285
Michael.

712
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:06,353
Michael.

713
00:32:07,322 --> 00:32:08,821
Are you ok?

714
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:10,222
Sorry. Yes,
yes, i'm fine.

715
00:32:10,224 --> 00:32:13,525
Just, this
morning's delivery

716
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:14,726
Was complete
and on time.

717
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:16,294
It was
a bit of a shock.

718
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:17,094
I can imagine.

719
00:32:17,096 --> 00:32:19,096
Morganson's here.

720
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:21,932
I thought that you could
soften him up a bit,

721
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:22,999
And then i'll move in
for the kill.

722
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:24,867
Absolutely.

723
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:26,168
Lovely.

724
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,203
We do like to think
that we can

725
00:32:28,205 --> 00:32:30,371
Match sotheby's
in the 2 qualities

726
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:32,306
Most important
to any auction house.

727
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:34,207
One being, obviously,
a tradition

728
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:35,942
Of unquestioned
respectability.

729
00:32:35,944 --> 00:32:38,110
And the other being,
um...

730
00:32:38,112 --> 00:32:39,377
For want
of a better word,

731
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:41,312
Shall we say class?

732
00:32:48,754 --> 00:32:51,788
Well, i know mr. Cromwell
is anxious to talk to you.

733
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,356
[breathing heavily]

734
00:32:56,828 --> 00:32:58,594
I'm sorry, michael.
I'm confused.

735
00:32:58,596 --> 00:33:00,028
What's the problem?

736
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,531
Well, mr. Graziosi wants me
to auction it for $50,000.

737
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:06,267
No one--i mean,
people would pay $50,000

738
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:08,502
Just to avoid being in
the same room as this thing.

739
00:33:08,504 --> 00:33:09,302
Michael, please.

740
00:33:09,304 --> 00:33:11,304
Your trucks show up on time

741
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:13,572
For the first time
in god knows how long.

742
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,740
And you--you get to give
a little happiness

743
00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:16,974
To an important friend.

744
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:18,742
So, i mean,
what's the matter with you?

745
00:33:18,744 --> 00:33:19,743
I thought you'd be happy.

746
00:33:19,745 --> 00:33:20,944
No. Mr. Vitale--

747
00:33:20,946 --> 00:33:22,045
No. Dad.

748
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:23,312
No,
you don't understand.

749
00:33:23,314 --> 00:33:24,546
This is exactly what
gina said would happen.

750
00:33:24,548 --> 00:33:26,581
This is her--i mean,
if she even found out

751
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:28,783
That this thing had been
sent over here--

752
00:33:28,785 --> 00:33:30,918
Gina. You're early.

753
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,985
Hi.

754
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:33,419
Just on the phone
with your dad.

755
00:33:33,421 --> 00:33:34,686
Oh, let me talk.

756
00:33:34,688 --> 00:33:35,853
Yeah.

757
00:33:35,855 --> 00:33:37,554
Hey, you. Ah.
Oh, oh.

758
00:33:37,556 --> 00:33:38,788
Mmm.
[chuckles]

759
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,089
Daddy,
you got my message?

760
00:33:40,091 --> 00:33:42,424
Great. And everything's
ok for tomorrow?

761
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:43,458
[snaps]

762
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,727
And tomorrow at noon's
ok for the fittings?

763
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:47,828
Ok, well,
here's the deal.

764
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,763
Now, i'm gonna be there,

765
00:33:49,765 --> 00:33:51,998
And carol is gonna
come along, too,

766
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,299
To take photos.

767
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:55,634
No. She's doing
the whole wedding,

768
00:33:55,636 --> 00:33:57,335
So be nice.

769
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:59,537
We have to talk about
the wedding reception.

770
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:00,538
Gina!

771
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,505
Whoo.

772
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:04,774
Now, i know you and mom
used louie's,

773
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,776
But...

774
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,443
Hold on.

775
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:12,713
[laughing]
no.

776
00:34:13,782 --> 00:34:15,782
We do have 2 key attributes

777
00:34:15,784 --> 00:34:18,618
For which, in this business,
there is no substitute.

778
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,685
The first being, obviously,

779
00:34:19,687 --> 00:34:22,421
A tradition of unparalleled
respectability.

780
00:34:22,423 --> 00:34:24,423
And the other being,
shall we say,

781
00:34:24,425 --> 00:34:26,124
For want of
a better word--

782
00:34:29,795 --> 00:34:31,594
We'll come back later.

783
00:34:31,596 --> 00:34:33,062
[chuckles]

784
00:34:33,064 --> 00:34:35,264
Michael: Right.

785
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:36,198
Fine.

786
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,933
You know what, daddy?
We have to go.

787
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:39,467
Ok, i love you, too.

788
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,335
He wants to say bye.

789
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:45,337
Yeah?

790
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:47,272
Frank: Look,
it's gonna be ok.

791
00:34:47,274 --> 00:34:49,040
Uh, you put the thing
up for auction.

792
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:51,342
It don't sell.
Gina will never know.

793
00:34:51,344 --> 00:34:54,445
Oh, i don't think
i can do that. Ha ha.

794
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:56,013
Um, listen.

795
00:34:56,015 --> 00:34:58,815
This favor...
If you don't do it,

796
00:34:58,817 --> 00:35:00,183
It's really
not that great.

797
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:01,350
I mean, not for you,

798
00:35:01,352 --> 00:35:03,018
And to be honest
with you, not for me.

799
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,153
So, we'll just
do it this once,

800
00:35:05,155 --> 00:35:07,088
And i'll talk to vito
and explain, uh...

801
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,289
How in the future

802
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:10,424
You two would prefer
to go it alone, ok?

803
00:35:10,426 --> 00:35:13,160
Heh heh.
Is that a promise, dad?

804
00:35:13,162 --> 00:35:14,693
Yes, that's a promise.

805
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,029
Fabulous.

806
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:19,663
Noon tomorrow, then,
it is.

807
00:35:19,665 --> 00:35:20,664
Ok, bye.

808
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,399
What is wrong with you?

809
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:24,601
Yeah. Yeah.

810
00:35:24,603 --> 00:35:25,868
You...Come here.

811
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,436
Mmm!

812
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:29,404
[laughs]

813
00:35:29,406 --> 00:35:30,705
Yeah.

814
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:34,875
I swear to god, frankie,
i ain't got the money!

815
00:35:34,877 --> 00:35:35,909
[pants]

816
00:35:35,911 --> 00:35:37,076
All right.

817
00:35:37,078 --> 00:35:38,743
Now i gotta put you
on mountain climb.

818
00:35:40,646 --> 00:35:42,245
[beeping]

819
00:35:52,356 --> 00:35:54,422
We worked out
the signals.

820
00:35:54,424 --> 00:35:55,222
What?

821
00:35:55,224 --> 00:35:57,090
With the old lady.

822
00:35:57,092 --> 00:35:59,592
If you want her to start
bidding, you cough.

823
00:35:59,594 --> 00:36:00,859
Ok, easy enough.

824
00:36:00,861 --> 00:36:02,627
If you want her
to stop bidding,

825
00:36:02,629 --> 00:36:04,528
You just say "ha."

826
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,662
Fine.

I, uh, don't see how
this time is any different.

913
00:40:12,895 --> 00:40:14,060
The difference is

914
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:15,594
That this painting
was bought

915
00:40:15,596 --> 00:40:16,861
By a restaurant owner

916

Who owed the artist's
father $50,000.

It's a setup.
You get it?

They bought it
from themselves.

I don't understand.

00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:26,768
If someone buys
your painting for 50,000,

You make 50,000,

But if they already
owed you the money,

And may i just remind you,
ladies and gentlemen,

1073
00:46:41,992 --> 00:46:44,993
That we recently sold a graziosi
for a record $50,000,

1074
00:46:44,995 --> 00:46:47,095
The most ever paid

Gina: Michael.

From the painting

1178

This is why you told me
not to come tonight.

Gina, i--

1180

A friend of ours.

I thought big mickey
was dead.

1316
00:55:52,542 --> 00:55:55,175
The father. This is
little big mickey.

1317
00:55:55,177 --> 00:55:57,210
Wasn't there
a little big mickey

1318
00:55:57,212 --> 00:55:58,477
Out of chicago?

1319
00:55:58,479 --> 00:56:00,178
Yeah. That's the original
little big mickey.

Whoa, is that

Frank: I thought he was
in witness protection.

1327
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:13,388
Al: Took us 7 years.

1328

Tracked him
and whacked him. Yeah.

"tracked him
and whacked him."

00:56:18,127 --> 00:56:20,127
So, uh,
who's your guy?

1331
00:56:20,129 --> 00:56:22,395
He's a nobody.

1332
00:56:22,397 --> 00:56:24,530
Frankie, come on.
We showed you ours.

1333

What? We in the
second grade over here?

1334
00:56:27,501 --> 00:56:30,435
He's a witness. I really
can't talk about it.

1335
00:56:30,437 --> 00:56:32,170
Well, then,
i guess we should

1336
00:56:32,172 --> 00:56:33,304
Get these guys
in the ground, huh?

1337
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,338
Frank:
Good, good.

1338
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,772
Good to see you.
You, too, huh?

Mickey.

Come on, let's go.
We got to move him.

I got to dig?

Yeah, you dig.
It's your turn.

1347
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,149
You shot him
in the head.

1348
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,383
Yeah, so?
I whacked him. You dig.

I wish i was him.

No, you don't.

1353
00:56:55,855 --> 00:56:58,855
No, you're right.
I wish you were him.

00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:03,058
Here, here,
here, here.

1355
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,592
Wipe yourself.

Oh. You got
a hundred-dollar bill?

1357
00:57:09,298 --> 00:57:10,463
Why?

1358
00:57:10,465 --> 00:57:12,798
Get in the car.
Don't worry about it.

1359

Look, one thing.

1360

If any of this
gets out,

1361

I'm the one that
shot johnny, ok?

1362
00:57:20,406 --> 00:57:23,873
Can we at least
agree on that?

1363
00:57:25,176 --> 00:57:27,009
You got it.

1364
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:37,352
You all right?

1365
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:39,053
You got my messages?

[sighs]

1367
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:43,790
You buried him,
and then you dug him up,

1368
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:46,526
And now you don't know
where he is.

1369
00:57:46,528 --> 00:57:49,128
No, not exactly.

1370
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:52,631
Yeah,
i got your messages.

1371

So, how you feeling?

1372
00:57:58,337 --> 00:58:00,136
Well, obviously,
it's my first murder.

1373
00:58:00,138 --> 00:58:03,372
On top of which, i feel
like i'm going crazy,

1374
00:58:03,374 --> 00:58:05,006
And i'm scared, and...

1375
00:58:05,008 --> 00:58:07,041
And the one person
i want to turn to

1376
00:58:07,043 --> 00:58:09,443
Turns out to be
a liar and a fraud,

1377
00:58:09,445 --> 00:58:11,878
But other than that...

1378
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,212
I'm not a liar.

1379
00:58:13,214 --> 00:58:15,447
I mean, yes.
I am a liar.

00:58:19,452 --> 00:58:21,185
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

Wait. Wait.

1384
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:25,221
Hold out your hand.

00:58:26,524 --> 00:58:29,124
Here. Just...

Till i've had
a chance to explain.

And i'll listen to
what you have to say.

This is patrick richards,

Reporting from central park,

1392

Where police this morning
found the body

1393

Of 31-year-old

Son of reputed mob boss
vito graziosi.

the body was found

With a rolled-up $100 bill
in one of the nostrils,

Calling card of the notorious
risolli crime family.

Of a flourishing art career.

1400

Tony risolli called.

1401

They want to talk.

1402
00:59:38,418 --> 00:59:40,951
Ok. Set it up.

1403
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:47,989
Soon as they pull up,
we should blow them away.

1404
00:59:50,827 --> 00:59:53,227
Let's listen to what
they got to say, huh?

On the soul
of his mother

1408

He had nothing
to do with this.

A cop in the 20th
precinct tipped us.

1412

They towed johnny's car
from in front of a building

1413

On the upper west side.

That's the address.

1415

Go.

1416
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:46,640
No, wait.

1417
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:51,510
You don't want everyone
stomping around up there

1418
01:00:51,512 --> 01:00:53,778
Like a bunch of goddamn
elephants, scaring people away.

How about i go in there
with a detective's badge,

And save you going back

for strangling her?

Well, what else
was it for?

1496

take her up to my cabin.

Trust me, it'll be ok.

01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:29,522
No, you--
just wake up, frank!

1604
01:08:29,524 --> 01:08:30,723
It will not be ok!

1605
01:08:30,725 --> 01:08:33,192
I just assaulted my boss,
i've lost my fiancáe,

1606
01:08:33,194 --> 01:08:37,328
And now your pals are gonna
hunt me down and kill me.

1607
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:39,330
So "it's not gonna be ok"
pretty much tops the list.

1608
01:08:39,332 --> 01:08:41,065
Michael, you have
to stay focused.

1609
01:08:41,067 --> 01:08:42,466
Well, you focus on this:

1610
01:08:42,468 --> 01:08:44,568
Gina's probably
not going to forgive me,

1611
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:46,636
Because i lied to her.

1612
01:08:46,638 --> 01:08:49,205
And her father's been
lying to her all her life,

1613
01:08:49,207 --> 01:08:50,940
And it hurts.

1614
01:08:50,942 --> 01:08:52,508
She tell you that?

1615
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:53,809
Yeah.

1616
01:08:53,811 --> 01:08:55,477
And now it looks like
i've lost

1617
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:57,479
The only girl
i've ever really loved,

1618
01:08:57,481 --> 01:08:59,347
So as far
as i'm concerned,

1619
01:08:59,349 --> 01:09:01,381
It's not bloody ok
at all!

1620
01:09:04,085 --> 01:09:05,484
Michael.

1621
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,453
You can't go home.

1622
01:09:10,089 --> 01:09:12,089
I'm going to gina.

1623
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:20,362
I should never have
lied to you.

1624
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,964
I should have told you
everything from the start,

1625
01:09:22,966 --> 01:09:24,966
But the whole thing just
snowballed,

1626
01:09:24,968 --> 01:09:26,968
And before
i knew where i was,

1627
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,970
I was just buried
in the whole thing.

1628
01:09:28,972 --> 01:09:31,138
But everything i did,
i did out of...

1629
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,572
Fear of losing you.

1630
01:09:32,574 --> 01:09:33,606
Can't you see that?

1631
01:09:33,608 --> 01:09:36,241
Gina, listen, please,
just let me come up.

1632
01:09:36,243 --> 01:09:37,542
This is--
this is ridiculous.

1633
01:09:37,544 --> 01:09:40,745
Why didn't you show up

They don't know anything
at all about you.

1798
01:17:28,574 --> 01:17:31,708
But, um, they think
that i shot johnny.

1799
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:32,842
But you didn't.

1800
01:17:32,844 --> 01:17:34,410
Act like
you're in love.

1801
01:17:34,412 --> 01:17:36,278
Who are you?

1802
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,445
Fbi.

1803
01:17:37,447 --> 01:17:39,146
How are you today?

1804
01:17:39,148 --> 01:17:41,114
Vito doesn't know
that i know this,

1805
01:17:41,116 --> 01:17:42,715
But your father's been
ordered to kill me

1806
01:17:42,717 --> 01:17:44,316
At our
wedding reception.

1807
01:17:44,318 --> 01:17:47,052
Michael will be
wearing a wire.

1808
01:17:47,054 --> 01:17:48,253
What?

1809
01:17:48,255 --> 01:17:50,455
The idea is that vito won't
be afraid to talk to me

1810
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:51,856
Because he thinks
i'm about to die.

1811
01:17:51,858 --> 01:17:54,725
And then when i get him
to incriminate himself--

1812
01:17:54,727 --> 01:17:56,460
Our guys come in.
Bingo. Got him.

1813
01:17:56,462 --> 01:17:58,462
And, uh...

1814
01:17:58,464 --> 01:18:00,730
That's the end of it.

1815
01:18:01,999 --> 01:18:05,300
You think i'd help trap
my own father?

1816
01:18:05,302 --> 01:18:06,567
Your father is with us.

1817
01:18:06,569 --> 01:18:09,870
You're more important
to him than they are.

1818
01:18:09,872 --> 01:18:12,839
It's our only way
out of this alive.

1819
01:18:15,877 --> 01:18:18,477
Then i guess
i don't have a choice.

1820
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:21,079
Is everything ok?

1821
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:21,879
Everything's fine.

1822

you know?

1823
01:18:24,183 --> 01:18:26,149
I think
we're through.

1824
01:18:27,485 --> 01:18:28,884
Uh, excuse me.

1825
01:18:28,886 --> 01:18:30,886
Um, any panics,
any questions,

1826
01:18:30,888 --> 01:18:32,754
You just
give us a call.

Don't be shy.

Well, bye, then,

1829
01:18:37,327 --> 01:18:38,359
See you later.

1830
01:18:38,361 --> 01:18:39,626
Ok.

1831
01:18:46,434 --> 01:18:47,866
Michael: I can't do this.

1832
01:18:47,868 --> 01:18:49,901
We have to tell her frank's
gonna pretend to shoot me.

1833
01:18:49,903 --> 01:18:52,103
No way, her reaction
is everything.

1834
01:18:52,105 --> 01:18:53,504
It has to be real.

Good.

Ok, gentlemen,
the limo is on its way.

Now, a squeeze
or a sharp tap...

01:19:36,278 --> 01:19:37,543
Sets them off.

before the speeches.

about the other day...

I don't want to hear.

1913

I'm sure
you had your reasons.

of the way you've...

Opened my eyes
to new possibilities.

As a matter of fact,
um...

1938
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:27,616
I recently thought
of a new idea

01:23:27,618 --> 01:23:29,284
That i think could be

1940

Extremely profitable
to us both.

1941
01:23:32,421 --> 01:23:35,522
Uh, absurdly profitable,
really.

1942

we're talking millions.

But, um, this certainly
isn't the occasion

1945
01:23:42,029 --> 01:23:43,528
To be talking business,
is it?

1946

Another time perhaps.

for being here.

1948

And speeches in 4:05.

your mind?

01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:09,045
Let the bid come to you.
That's rule number one.

1961
01:24:09,047 --> 01:24:11,047
What the hell are
you talkin' about?

1962
01:24:11,049 --> 01:24:14,383
Oh, mr. Graziosi wants
to see you over there.

1963
01:24:14,385 --> 01:24:15,650
Of course.

1964
01:24:15,652 --> 01:24:17,050
Pleasure.

1965
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:22,521
I think
we're in business.

1966

Speech is in 3.

1967
01:24:26,325 --> 01:24:28,525
We have to go say hi
to maria.

1968
01:24:28,527 --> 01:24:29,726
Here.               Oh.

1969
01:24:32,797 --> 01:24:34,263
So basically...

1970
01:24:34,265 --> 01:24:37,399
You continue to sell and buy
interesting work through us,

1971
01:24:37,401 --> 01:24:40,068
And i do
the insurance valuation

1972
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:41,502
On the collection
you assemble.

1973
01:24:41,504 --> 01:24:45,672
Like insurance against
a fire, for example.

1974
01:24:45,674 --> 01:24:48,074
Fires can happen.

1975
01:24:48,076 --> 01:24:50,042
Look at sotheby's.

1976
01:24:51,812 --> 01:24:54,078
But fortunately,
of course,

1977
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,213
You would be
handsomely covered.

1978
01:24:57,082 --> 01:24:58,714
So what do you think?

1979
01:24:59,683 --> 01:25:01,749

You two look serious.
Cheer up.

1986
01:25:17,096 --> 01:25:18,695
Good heavens.
Those are something.

1987
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:19,696
You mind if i...

1988
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:20,697
Take it easy.

1989
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,832

Are you all right?

2025
01:26:33,450 --> 01:26:35,049
I'm sure he meant it
as a joke.
