DETECTIVE TYLAR: One female
in her late thirties
and three minors.

Multiple stab wounds
and blunt-force trauma.

CAPTAIN MACKIE: What about
the ex-husband?

38
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,040
Court said the wife
had a restraining order
against him.

39
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,220
Dylan Bennet.
He spent the night with
a bottle of Jack Daniel's.

40
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,140
lt was his
first Christmas
without his family.

MACKIE: All the more reason.

you didn't se'e him
when he ID-ed his family.

43
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,120
Looked like he'd been
hit by a freight train.

DETECTIVE SHAY:
Seeing his kids like that.
All the blood.

Yeah, it was definitely
a nightmare for him.

he gets my vote for

Let's say the stepfather,
this Grady Edwards did it.

Nothing.

Said he was from Kansas.

SHAY: Except we can't find
a match in any database.

51
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,260
And he stopped the newspaper
to have time to disappear.

52
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,040
And we think he might
have done this before.

Three years ago
in New Jersey,
a wife and three kids.

54
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,260
Gunshot wounds to
the back of the head.
The stepfather disappeared.

55
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,080
Lived in a rented room
where he met the victims.

56
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,160
Both rooms were owned
by older women.

57
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,160
One of the women
who lives in New Jersey said,

58
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,000
''He's a wondeful man,
always paid his rent
on time and in cash.''

59
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,120
So, of course,
she never asked him
for any identification.

60

SHAY: No, he's smart.
The Toyota Land Cruiser
that we found abandoned?

61
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,290
Paid for in cash.
No driver's license
required for registration.

62
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,220
TYLAR: No credit cards,
no anything. Which means...

63
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,020
MACKIE: No photo ID required.

64
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,180
SHAY: Always a divorced
or widowed situation.

65
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,110

this guy's a monster.

Even if this is your guy,

He could be anywhere by now.

l can't get these.

69
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,290
Sean, we're not
getting these.
Hey! You two stop arguing.

70
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,290
Why does she always get
to pick the kind of cookies
we get? It's not fair!

71
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,290
Life is not fair.
Life is about the woman
getting to pick the cookies.

72
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,100
Sorry, they get a little
out of control sometimes.

00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,100
DAVID: Everyone have
enough to eat?
ALL: Yeah...

159
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:27,080
l would like to
propose a toast.

160
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,200
First of all
l want to th' ank Susan
and Sean and Beth,

161
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,100
who, in a very short time,
have taken me in
and made me feel at home.

162
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,240
This is... It's a dream
come true for me.

163
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,070
Thank you.

164
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,160
And to Michael.
Your return makes
us complete.

165
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,100
Family is
the most important thing.
Without it, we have nothing.

166
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,000
Welcome home, Michael.

167
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,060
Hear, hear.

168
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,120
MAN: Hear, hear, Michael.

169
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,290
l think l'm a little
nauseous after that.

170
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,110
Stop it.

171
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,240
You want something
to drink?
No, no, no, l got this.

172
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,170
We have a surprise
for you, too.

173
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,220
Really?
Jackie pulled a few strings

174
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,060
and she can get you a job
working with her as
a real estate agent.

175
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,200
Oh, l couldn't.

176
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,110
Wait a minute.
Of course you can.

177
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,060
Okay? Just follow me around
and I'll get you all set up.

178
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,190
lt's a great
opportunity for us

179
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,060
and she really
went out of her way.

180
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,040
Well, l can't say no
to my bride-to-be
or her sister, can l?

181
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,050
Thank you, Jackie.
Don't thank me. Thank her.

182
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,170
Because she's
the one who convinced me
to get you off the road

183
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,080
so she can keep
an eye on you.

184
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,280
Oh. Did you?

185
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,060
Thank you.
l'm gonna go have
a word with your son.

186
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,250
God, l hope Michael
takes to him.

187
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,270
He will. He's just been
blindsided by the divorce.

188
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,150
He'll bounce back.

189
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,130
Michael.
Give me four minutes.
Meet me in the basement.

190
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,110
So, what'd he say?

191
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,210
He said he wants me to
meet him in the basement.

192
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,200
ln the basement?
Yeah.

193
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,160
Why?

194
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,190
l don't know.
Well, l guess l'm
about to find out.

195
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,210
Those two are mine.
But you're welcome
to use the others.

196
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,220
What's all this for?

197
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,020
Well, l'm a bit of
a wannabe carpenter.

198
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,050
l built these
storage cabinets myself.

199
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,020
And l'm working up
in the attic right now
on some termite damage.

200
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,040
l think we need
a real toast.

201
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,250
Just the guys.

202
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,070
This is where
l keep the good stuff.

203
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,030
There we go.

204
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,000
Now, don't let your mom know
l've got a tequila stash.

205
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,090
l've worked my ass off
trying to convince her
l'm perfect.

206
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,120
l know this must
be a bit of a shock,

207
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,120
your mom and me
getting married and all,

208
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,160
but l want you
to know, l want us

209
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,290
to be a real family.

210
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,150
Because without it,
we have nothing?

211
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,040
Oh.

212
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,090
Okay. Touché.

213
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,270
So l get a little
corny sometimes,
but l meant what l said.

214
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You just let me
handle your mother,

215
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,020
and l'm gonna make
sure you stay right here,
where you belong.

216
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,150
No more military school.

217
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,180
We're gonna put this
family back together,
you and me,

218
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,240
father and son.

219
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,030
Stepfather.

220
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,130
Stepfather

221
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,010
and son.

222
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,190
That's smooth, isn't it?

223
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,020
(COUGHS)

224
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,210
So your mother tells me
you're one hell of a swimmer.

225
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,050
Yeah, l do okay.

226
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,070
You know, l used to
swim in competition.
In college, at U of O.

227
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,000
Your senior year is
gonna be very important.

228
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,130
You could maybe get
a college scholarship
swimming.

229
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,240
You should be
training this summer.

230
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,160
lt's kind of hard to
train in a backyard pool.

231
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,130
Maybe. But l hear
your old school has
a summer swim program.

232
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,000
lt does, but l can't
use that pool anymore.

233
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,190
That's the past.

234
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,240
Here is to the future.

235
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,240
Remember,
l have to go see my
grandparents tomorrow.

236
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,190
Yeah, that's right.
But l'll be back
the day after. l'm sorry.

237
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,130
No, that's all right.
l mean, it's the day
l get back,

238
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,170
but that's fine.
l'll call someone else.

239
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,190
Shut up. l'm sorry.

240
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,290
Listen, l want to
get my license.

241
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,110
So, can you take me
by the DMV?

242
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,160
Maybe.
l'll think about it.

243
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,230
Why not?

244
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,110
l kind of like having you
dependent on me, actually.

245
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,170
All right, get in the car.

246

Thanks, Aunt Jackie.
l'm so glad to be home.
Thank you for coming.

David meant what he said

252
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,230
about getting your
mom to let you stay?

253
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,190
He said he was
gonna make it happen,
so we'll see.

254
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,160
Sweet. Bye.

A lot for one day, huh?

257

No, no, it was...
It was nice. Thanks.

258

l'm trying too hard.
You can say it.

259
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:08,130
Look, Michael, l know
it's difficult to come home
to another man in the house.

260
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,090
l just need you to
try and get along, okay?

261
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,010
Mom, can we just hold
the lectures, please?

262
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,050
l've been home
for two seconds.

263
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,210
Okay.

264
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,130
He's a really good guy.

265
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,230
And he cares about me
and we're trying to
start a new life together.

266
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,250
And you don't want
me to mess that up.

267
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,000
Well, that's not fair.

268
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,190
No, no, no, l get it.
l'll try not to inconvenience
you and your new life.

269
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,250
Michael.
l'm sorry. l, um...

270
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,090
l'm pretty tired, Mom.

271
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,290
Okay. Okay.

272
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,050
Good night.

SUSAN: Maybe he should
stay there his senior year.

274
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,160
But his place is
here with his family.

275
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,040
Yeah, but you don't
know what he was like.

276
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,190
The kids he was
hanging out with,
the lying.

277
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,290
His temper was
out of control.

278
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,130
Believe me,
l want him here more than
anything in the world.

l just hope he's ready.

You're right.

00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,160
Are you ready?

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,100
Well, it depends.

to stay here with you.

l'm sorry.

is so important to me,

our family wasn't that bad.

That kind of thing
really gets to me,

360
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,060
that someone
could do that to
her own children.

361
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,140
lt makes you wonder,
though, what it takes

362
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,190
to make someone do
something so sick.

363

the conversation?

to a Blazers game.

They can spend the night
with me at the hotel.
l'll have them back tomorrow.

working for a Ph.D.

She wasn't that much
younger than you were.

better care of herself,

Mmm-hmm.

his ID.

They couldn't
trace any fingerprints.
And there are similarities.

1046

He said he traveled a lot.

any pictures of David.

1050

1058

can help him work it out.

there's a big storm

What?
The shot l took
of him before?

1184

and now there's no pictures
of him anywhere.

didn't see you take it.

maybe he's been

his picture taken.
