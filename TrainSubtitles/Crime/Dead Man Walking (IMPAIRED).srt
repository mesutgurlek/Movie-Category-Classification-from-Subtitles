- Hi, Sister Helen.
- Hi. How ya doin'?

9
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,393
Well, if it ain't the late Sister Helen.

10
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,520
I got a note from my mama, Idella.

11
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,065
Do you need a new composition book?
How about you, Melvin?

12
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,653
The resident counselor wants us at their
meeting tomorrow. Can you be there?

13
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,239
Yes. Oh... New poetry books.

14
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,200
- Your poem got all smudged.
- Smudged?

15
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,412
Sister Helen, I got
another letter from that guy.

16
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,374
- Which guy is that?
- Angola inmate. Death row.

17
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,500
Oh, yeah.

18
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,920
Could you write to him?
He could use some friendly words.

19
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,840
Sure. I'll come up after the class.

20
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,427
- It got smudged.
- You can still read it.

21
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,269
"There's a woman
standin' there in the dark

22
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,730
and she's got big arms to hold you,

23
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,774
but you won't feel
those arms, that hug,

24
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,152
till you can see her face.

25
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,032
So you stand there waiting
for the light at the end of the road."

26
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:25,120
- (Helen) Idella, that is so fine.
- Thank you.

27
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,087
(man)
My lawyer seems to have disappeared.

28
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,131
So I could use some help
on the legal end,

29
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,468
but I'd take a kind word or a visit.

30
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,553
It gets real quiet here sometimes.

31
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,140
None of these guys on the row
can afford attorneys for appeals.

32
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,477
We get frantic phone calls
from death row inmates,

33
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,730
- begging us to find them attorneys.
- Who work for nothin'.

34
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,691
That's right. Each petition
takes hours to prepare.

35
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,070
Attorneys aren't exactly
lining up for the job.

36
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,283
(♪ "The Face of Love")

37
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,093
Dear Sister Helen,

38
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:26,723
Thank you for writin' to me. I'm writin'
from my home, my six by eight foot cell.

39
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,393
I'm in here 23 hours a day.

40
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,354
We don't work on death row.

41
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,647
We're special here.

42
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,984
They keep us away from the
general population of the prison.

43
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,529
We're the elite, cos we gonna fry.

44
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,532
It's hard not to get soft in this cell.
I press my footlocker,

45
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,537
try to get my muscles in shape,
but it's hard not to get fat.

46
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:52,541
Rice, potatoes, pancakes, beans.

47
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:57,796
Sometimes I feel like a sow that's being
fattened up for a Christmas slaughter.

48
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,300
I had a dream that I was
about to be fried in the chair

49
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,594
and a guard came into my cell
with a chef's hat on.

50
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,471
He started to roll me in breadcrumbs,

51
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,224
lickin' his chops and all.

52
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,145
Maybe I'm weird to have dreams like
that, but your mind does funny things

53
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,648
when you're surrounded
by people that wanna kill you.

54
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,235
Anyway, thanks for writin'.

55
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,904
- I don't get many letters or visitors.
- (beeps)

56
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,950
No one in my family seems able
to make the trip out here. I understand.

57
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,579
It's a long drive from Slidell.

58
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,497
(beeps)

59
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,252
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Father.

60
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,006
- Sister...
- Helen Prejean. Nice to meet you.

61
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,978
- Have you been in a prison before?
- No, Father.

62
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,438
Sister Clement and I sang

63
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,024
at the juvenile detention center
in New Orleans.

64
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,152
We sang "Kumbaya"
and the boys really liked it.

65
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,200
They started makin' up their own verses,
singin' "Someone's escapin', my Lord..."

66
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,495
The guards made us
sing a different song.

67
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,206
Where is your habit?

68
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,209
Our sisters haven't worn
the habit for 20 years, Father.

69
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,463
You are aware of the papal request
regarding nuns' garments, aren't you?

70
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,885
I believe the Pope said
"distinctive clothing", not habits.

71
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,640
Well, I'm sure you will interpret it
in your own way. Whatever's convenient.

72
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,018
Matthew Poncelet.

73
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,606
I remember him from the news.
Him and another fella

74
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:43,485
shot two children in the back
of the head on a lovers' lane.

75
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,656
Raped the girl,
stabbed her several times.

76
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,244
Do you know what you're gettin' into?

77
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,081
So what is it, Sister?

78
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:01,420
Morbid fascination?
Bleedin'-heart sympathy?

79
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,756
He wrote me and asked me to come.

80
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,008
There's no romance here, Sister.

81
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,804
No Jimmy Cagney "I'm wrongly accused.

82
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,474
If I only had someone to believe in me."

83
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:20,272
They are all con men and they will take
advantage of you every way they can.

84
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,986
You must be very, very careful.
Do you understand?

85
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,320
Yes, Father.

86
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:31,116
These men don't see many females.

87
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:35,036
For you to wear the habit
might help instill respect.

88
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:40,250
For you to flout authority
will only encourage them to do the same.

89
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,473
(gunshot)

90
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,309
Woman on the tier!

91
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,958
You can wait over there.
We'll bring your man out for you.

92
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,335
Well, Matthew, I made it.

93
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,298
Thanks for comin', ma'am.

94
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,344
Never thought I'd be visitin'
with no nun.

95
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,730
- So you're a nun.
- Yep.

96
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,741
I'm here to listen, and whatever
you wanna talk about, that's fine.

97
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,660
You're very sincere.

98
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,413
What do you mean?

99
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,665
- You never done this before?
- No.

100
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,584
Never been this close to a murderer?

101
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,752
Not that I know of.

102
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,005
You live in St. Thomas.
Lots of niggers.

103
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,341
They knock each other off
like beer cans off a fence.

104
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,804
When I got your letter
and I seen "Helen" on it,

105
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,514
I thought of my first ex-old lady.

106
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,852
I almost ripped it up.
She turned me in. Called the cops.

107
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,605
Orphaned our kid, the stupid bitch.

108
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,690
- You've got a kid?
- Yeah, a con with a kid.

109
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,191
- Girl or boy?
- Girl.

110
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,277
What's her name?

111
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,863
- You ask a lot of questions.
- I don't know you.

112
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,323
Well, never mind.

113
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,664
In your letter you say
you work with poor people.

114
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:28,293
Your daddy was a lawyer.
You come from money, don't you?

115
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,378
Some.

116
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,591
And you live in St. Thomas projects?
I don't know who's crazier, you or me.

117
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,218
- I live where I work.
- Yeah. In a slum.

118
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,804
- What about you?
- I live here.

119
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,223
You... were brought up poor?

120
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,102
Ain't nobody with money on death row.

121
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,105
Then you and I have
somethin' in common.

122
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:53,026
- What's that?
- We both live with the poor.

123
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,654
Mm.

124
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,666
Ain't you gonna ask me what I done?

125
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,587
- The chaplain filled me in.
- Farley?

126
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,507
He's a very religious man.

127
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,268
I didn't kill nobody.
Carl went crazy on me.

128
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,271
- Carl?
- Vitello. He oughta be sittin' here.

129
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,734
Went nuts on me. I was scared,
did what he said, held that boy back.

130
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,361
He killed them.

131
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,573
You watched him kill these kids?

132
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,992
I'll tell you the truth, ma'am.

133
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,580
Me and Carl were loaded on downs,
acid and booze when this happened.

134
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:51,334
I hadn't slept in two nights.
I was outta my head.

135
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,628
But I didn't kill 'em.

136
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,549
I didn't kill nobody.
I swear to God I didn't.

137
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,053
Ally.

138
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,597
- Ally?
- Her name.

139
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,479
- She's cute.
- She's 11... or 12. I don't know.

140
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,108
She was born when I was first in prison.
I seen her once.

141
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,319
- When was that?
- When she was three.

142
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,489
- Do you write to her?
- I don't know where she is.

143
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,576
She's in Texas somewhere.
Foster parents.

144
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,911
Go on and finish up, Sister.

145
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,586
Look... They're about
to go on a killin' spree here.

146
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,338
They're gonna zap
this guy Tobias tonight.

147
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:42,177
The guards are takin' bets on who's
next. I'm at even odds. It's not good.

148
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,847
So I got two chances: The pardon board
or the federal appeals court.

149
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,267
I wrote the motion on the appeal,
but I need somebody to file it.

150
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,977
Can you help me with that?

151
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,190
You know how to write a motion?

152
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,109
When your back's against the wall,
you learn the law real fast.

153
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,571
Call it special motivation.
I been on death row six years.

154
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,324
I've studied every law book
I can get my hands on.

155
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,328
This stuff is about my case -
transcripts of the trials, legal papers.

156
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,372
Maybe they'll help you
get ahold of things faster.

157
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,043
You rustle me up a lawyer,
we can file a motion for appeal.

158
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,718
- You ain't comin' back.
- No, I... Are these your only copies?

159
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,722
I got my own copy. But if you ain't
gonna help me, I don't wanna waste 'em.

160
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,017
I'll do my best.
And I appreciate your trust.

161
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,188
Sister, I don't trust nobody in here.

162
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:39,150
But you don't kiss my ass or preach
that hellfire and brimstone crap.

163
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,362
I respect that. You got guts.

164
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,241
You're livin' in a neighborhood
with every nigger carryin' a gun.

165
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,080
(child) Come on, Helen. Hit it!

166
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,710
(yelling)

167
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:11,182
Playing possum, huh? You think
you can trick us, you dumb animal?

168
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,268
You think you can fool us?

169
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,104
(siren)

170
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,785
- How fast was I goin'?
- 75 miles an hour, ma'am.

171
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,787
Wow!

172
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,540
- Are you a nun?
- Yes, sir.

173
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,544
Never gave a ticket to no nun before.

174
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:44,632
Gave a ticket to a guy from the IRS
one time. Got audited the next year.

175
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,264
Sister, I'm gonna let this one slide.

176
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,433
- But keep your speed down.
- Yes, sir.

177
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,494
On Friday night, Walter Delacroix,
age 17, and Hope Percy, 18,

178
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,330
had been just two happy people

179
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,665
celebrating one of
life's turning points.

180
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,335
The couple was shot twice at close range

181
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,712
in the back of the head
with a.22 rifle.

182
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,925
Poncelet and Vitello also face
six counts of aggravated kidnapping

183
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,636
and one charge of aggravated rape.

184
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,513
Before the murders,

185
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:36,976
the men allegedly had cut a path
of terror across the area.

186
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,396
A police spokesman said today,
in the wake of the murders,

187
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,024
Poncelet addressed the judge as "Cap"

188
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,861
and smirked when the jury
found him guilty of murder today.

189
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,906
Poncelet claims Vitello
killed both of them.

190
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,494
- Y'all think he's lyin'.
- Vitello accuses Poncelet.

191
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:58,456
Both say the other did the actual
killing. Somebody's lyin' to somebody.

192
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,625
They were both there.
We know that much.

193
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,044
How is it possible one guy gets life,
the other death?

194
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:07,173
Well, the State has probably got
a stronger case against Poncelet.

195
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:11,636
Vitello had a better lawyer. Created
a reasonable doubt in the jury's mind.

196
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,847
- And Vitello gets life, Poncelet death.
- Yeah.

197
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,432
Bad luck.

198
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,019
He needs help, Sister.

199
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:24,941
There's this lawyer, Hilton Barber.
He's aware of the case and told me no.

200
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:29,445
- Maybe you can change his mind.
- With the aim of gettin' him out?

201
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,240
I'm not sure I wanna run
into this guy on the street.

202
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,201
There's no way he's gettin' off.
He was there. He was an accomplice.

203
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,078
That's life!

204
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,581
A life sentence in a
Louisiana prison is for real.

205
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,251
You're just tryin' to stop
the State from killin' him.

206
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,674
You want out? That's cool with me.

207
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,593
You don't have to go back there.

208
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,681
Get tough on sentencin'.
Get tough on lenient parole boards.

209
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,101
Get tough on judges
who pass light sentences.

210
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,228
(phone rings)

211
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,398
- Hello.
- Sister Helen?

212
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,359
- Who's this?
- Matt Poncelet, Sister.

213
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:12,822
I know I'm on death row, but there's
guys been here years and years.

214
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,742
I didn't know this was comin'.
They set a date.

215
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,328
- What?
- They're gonna kill me on the 13th.

216
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,790
I didn't know you needed a lawyer
to get a pardon board hearing.

217
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,501
I'd do it myself if they'd let me,
but they say...

218
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,670
OK... OK, Matthew.

219
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,175
Uh... I think I know of a lawyer
that may be able to help you.

220
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,803
- I'll do my best, all right?
- Sister, come through for me.

221
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,932
You're all I got. They got me on
a greased rail to the death house here.

222
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,561
I ain't heard from you. You ain't
fadin' out on me, are you, Sister?

223
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,274
I'll get you the lawyer.
Just... try not to worry.

224
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:52,028
I'll call you soon. Bye.

225
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,655
It's about time the State
got with the program.

226
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,825
Call me sentimental,
but I'd rather see him fry.

227
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:01,829
Barring any last-minute appeals or
stays, Poncelet will die

228
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:05,500
under the State's new execution
procedure, the lethal injection machine.

229
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:09,337
- Hello?
- Luis, this is Helen.

230
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,965
Can you give me the name of that lawyer
you wanted me to talk to?

231
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,843
- How long you been doin' this, Sister?
- Doin' this?

232
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,846
- Counseling death row inmates.
- Oh, I'm not counseling him.

233
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,683
- I just met him once.
- What's your impression?

234
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,645
I don't know if I like him.

235
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,648
He needs help, but the best thing
is to bring him to you.

236
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,608
Well, I'll do my best.

237
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,156
Courts don't wanna hear appeals
on death-penalty cases.

238
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:41,786
You can have new evidence of innocence
and the court won't hear the case.

239
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,373
We're the pariahs. We're...
"Have many rabbit."

240
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,751
Think that's a "for sale" sign
or a cry for help?

241
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,878
Or is it braggin'?

242
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:57,552
Imagine that poor guy. Bought two
rabbits a year ago and now he's overrun.

243
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,595
Comin' like popcorn!

244
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,978
The governor runs for re-election
so they set a date for my execution.

245
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,731
- Show how tough he is on crime.
- Matt, I agree with you.

246
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,942
Politics did play a big part in this,

247
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,027
but don't bring it up
before the pardon board.

248
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,487
Why not?

249
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,489
Because it's full
of political appointees.

250
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,242
The last thing they wanna hear

251
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,537
is some convicted killer
tellin' them they is bunk.

252
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:29,250
We have to present you as a human being
and convince them to spare your life.

253
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,918
We have to prove I'm innocent.

254
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,714
We're filing appeals with
the federal and supreme courts.

255
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:39,010
This is a pardon board. It don't matter
to them whether you pulled the trigger.

256
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,681
They're gonna be thinkin' of the crime,
and of you as a monster.

257
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,268
It's easy to kill a monster,
but it's hard to kill a human being.

258
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,981
We need people that know you to speak
for you. Your mama should be there.

259
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,776
I don't want her there. She'll bust out
cryin' till she can't say nothin'.

260
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,529
Your mama should still be there.

261
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,532
No. She'd have to hear
the Delacroixs, the Percys, the DA.

262
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,119
- But if she's not at the hearing...
- Excuse me for buttin' in.

263
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,790
You're right. It's gonna be upsettin'
for her but... she's your mama, Matthew.

264
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:14,295
She should have the opportunity
to speak for her child.

265
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,755
She's just gonna blubber her head off.

266
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,133
Yeah, well, she has
the right to do that.

267
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,932
What if you die and she hasn't
had a chance to speak for you?

268
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,145
Don't you think it'll always eat at her,
wonderin' if she could have saved you?

269
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,780
I'll think about it, but I got my pride.

270
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:45,034
I ain't gonna kiss ass in front of these
people. I ain't gonna kiss nobody's ass.

271
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,789
(♪ "This is the Day the Lord Has Made")

272
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:59,840
- What are you making, Kenitra?
- An Easter card for my mama.

273
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,349
♪ I will rejoice

274

280

Happy Easter.

281
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,567
- Yes?
- Mrs. Poncelet?

282
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,235
No.

283
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,864
Mrs. Poncelet, please.

284
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:09,035
She don't live here. Who is it?

285
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:13,831
My name is Sister Helen Prejean.
I know your son Matthew.

286
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,420
Happy Easter.

287
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,090
- You sure you're a sister?
- Yes.

288
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,261
- You're not from the TV?
- No.

289
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,805
You're sure?

290
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,770
How do you know Mattie?

291
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,230
I met him on death row.

292
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,902
Well, you never know
who's at your front door.

293
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,906
So what do you want? Mattie send you
for money, for cigarettes?

294
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,408
No.

295
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,580
So what do you want?

296
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,795
You know they set the date
for Matthew's execution.

297
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:06,550
Yeah. The prison called. Said if it
goes down, do I got death insurance.

298
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,177
Hah!

299
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,430
What a laugh!
I ain't even got food money.

300
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,558
His pardon board hearing
is this Wednesday.

301
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,229
His lawyer thinks it'd be
a good idea if you were there.

302
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,356
What does Mattie think?

303
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,652
He's worried. He wants to protect you.

304
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,363
Well, it's a little late for that.

305
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,991
That show Inside Crime
did a thing on Mattie

306
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,869
and told how I tried
to help him and everything.

307
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,288
A regular Ma Barker or somethin'.

308
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,416
Now I'm famous.

309
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:43,254
Yesterday I was in the store
and I see these two ladies eyein' me.

310
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,465
When I get closer,
I hear one of them say,

311
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:50,219
"I can't wait to hear that
they've executed that monster,

312
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,721
Matthew Poncelet."

313
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,933
That's cruel.

314
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,813
My boys are havin'
a real hard time at school.

315
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:05,526
Kids picking on 'em,
beating 'em up, calling 'em names.

316
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,738
Someone put a dead squirrel
in my little Troy's locker.

317
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:13,159
Poor boy came home cryin'.

318
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,703
What'd he ever do to anyone?

319
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:25,171
I just keep... tryin' to figure out
what I done wrong.

320
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:31,552
They have been ploughed over by life.
He first got in trouble when he was 15.

321
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,680
- Every kid does that.
- His daddy was never around.

322
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,100
Most of your kids in the project
are raised by single parents.

323
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:43,147
They're not rapin' and killin' people.
Really, Helen, you're being suckered.

324
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,399
What about the parents of these victims?

325
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:49,403
- Have you counseled them?
- You think they'd wanna talk to me?

326
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,823
Don't people in your neighborhood
need your help?

327
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,992
Yes, Mama. I'm still workin' with them.

328
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,995
But why are you visiting with murderers?

329
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,956
For all the energy that
you're putting into them,

330
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:04,460
you could be keepin' other kids
from going to prison.

331
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:09,924
Mama's friends read an article which
associated your name with Poncelet.

332
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,676
- My name was in the paper?
- It has nothing to do with that.

333
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:17,348
I am simply curious.
Helen, what has drawn you to this?

334
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,601
Mama, I don't know.

335
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,771
I feel caught more than drawn.

336
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:29,485
The man's in trouble and, for some
reason, I'm the only one he trusts.

337
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,028
Your heart's in the right place,

338
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,031
but a full heart shouldn't
follow an empty head.

339
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,407
Or an empty stomach.

340
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:42,122
You'd always bring home strays. If we'd
taken in all those dogs and cats,

341
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,876
we wouldn't have had any money
to feed the children in this house.

342
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,547
Your heart is large.

343
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:55,678
Just take care that others don't take
advantage of it. I'd hate to see that.

344
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,888
All right, Mama.

345
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:03,060
My daddy took me to a bar when I was 12
and told me to pick my whiskey.

346
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,312
There was all these bottles
behind the bar.

347
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,983
I said "I'll take that one there
with the pretty turkey on it."

348
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:14,738
The guys in the bar laughed their butts
off. We got drunk as coots that night.

349
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,742
My daddy was a good man.
Sharecropper. Hard worker.

350
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,412
That's the one thing I got from him -
workin' hands.

351
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,999
- How old were you when he died?
- 14.

352
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,463
- Why's you a nun?
- I was drawn to it, I guess.

353
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:36,176
That's a hard question to answer. It's
like asking you why you're a convict.

354
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,095
- Bad luck.
- Good luck, then.

355
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:43,809
I had a lovin' family, a lot of support.
I felt obliged to give some of it back.

356
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,978
Don't you miss havin' a man?

357
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,731
Don't you wanna get married,
fall in love, have sex?

358
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,403
You don't wanna talk about it?

359
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,990
I have close friends - men and women.

360
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:02,911
I've never experienced sexual intimacy,
but there's other ways of being close.

361
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,498
Sharing your dreams,
your thoughts, your feelings.

362
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,876
That's bein' intimate too.

363
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,754
We got intimacy right now,
don't we, Sister?

364
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,217
I went to see your mother.

365
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:23,307
She said she'd appear at the pardon
board hearing if you want her to.

366
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,062
I like bein' alone with you.

367
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,272
You're lookin' real good to me.

368
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,776
Look at you.

369
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,945
Death is breathin' down your neck

370
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,948
and you're playin' your little
man-on-the-make games.

371
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:45,412
I'm not here for your amusement,
Matthew. Show some respect.

372
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,707
Why should I respect you?
Cos you're a nun and you wear a cross?

373
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,960
Because I'm a person.
Every person deserves respect.

374
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,262
What's it gonna be with your mama?

375
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:08,977
(Mrs. Poncelet) Mattie had a hard life,
but he was a good boy.

376
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,981
When he was six, he...

377
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,027
he...

378
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,114
(sobs)

379
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,420
Ladies and gentlemen, let's be honest.

380
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,631
You're not gonna find
many rich people on death row.

381
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,718
Matthew Poncelet's here today
because he's poor.

382
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,805
Didn't have money for representation,
so he took what the State gave him.

383
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:49,393
A tax lawyer who'd never tried
a capital case before. An amateur.

384
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:54,440
The jury selection took four hours.
The trial lasted five days.

385
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:59,987
The lawyer raised one objection
the entire trial.

386
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:04,158
Now, if Matthew had himself
some money,

387
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:09,163
well, he could have hired
a team of crackerjack lawyers.

388
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,126
They would have hired top-notch
investigators, a ballistics expert,

389
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:18,338
a psychologist to compile
profiles of desirable jurors,

390
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:24,303
and you can be sure Matthew Poncelet
wouldn't be here today, before you,

391
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,514
asking for his life.

392
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:35,147
The death penalty. It's nothing new.
Been with us for centuries.

393
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,442
We've buried people alive,
lopped off their heads,

394
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,361
burned them alive in public squares.

395
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,281
I wanted them to see this picture.

396
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,325
In this century, we've searched

397
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:51,413
for more and more humane ways
of killing people we didn't like.

398
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:55,375
We've shot 'em with firing squads,
suffocated 'em in a gas chamber.

399
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,878
But now...

400
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:03,884
Now we have developed a device
that is the most humane of all.

401
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,178
Lethal injection.

402
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,472
We strap the guy up.

403
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,560
We anaesthetize him with shot No.1.
Then shot No.2 implodes his lungs

404
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:17,523
and shot No.3 stops his heart.

405
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,193
We put him to death
just like an old horse.

406
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:26,907
His face just goes to sleep. Inside, his
organs are going through Armageddon.

407
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,535
The muscles of his face
would twist and contort and pull,

408
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:34,748
but you see, shot No.1 relaxes those
muscles so we don't see any horror show.

409
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,751
We don't have to taste
the blood of revenge on our lips,

410
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,090
while this human being's organs
writhe, twist, contort.

411
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:49,638
We just sit there quietly, nod our
heads, and say "Justice has been done."

412
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:58,272
It is six years since the brutal murders
of Hope Percy and Walter Delacroix.

413
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,483
Justice is long past due.

414
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,028
Matt Poncelet has had
a lengthy, thorough court review.

415
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,531
A trial, a retrial for sentencin',

416
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,576
numerous appeals to
state and federal courts

417
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,620
and successive petitions
filed by Mr. Barber.

418
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:18,709
There has been no doubt in the court's
mind about who did the murder.

419
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:25,090
Matthew Poncelet is not a good boy.
He is a heartless killer.

420
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:29,303
These murders were calculated,
disgusting and cruel.

421
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:34,099
This man shot Walter Delacroix
two times in the back of his head,

422
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,852
then raped Hope Percy
and stabbed her 17 times

423
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,397
before shootin' this sweet girl
two times in the back of the head.

424
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:46,695
These families will never see
their children graduate from college.

425
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,616
They will never attend their wedding.

426
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,911
They will never have Christmas
with them again.

427
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,163
There will be no grandchildren.

428
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:02,085
All they ask of you is simple justice
for their unbearable loss.

429
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:07,174
I ask you to take a breath,
steel your spine

430
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:11,845
and proceed with the execution
of Matthew Poncelet.

431
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,351
It's always a good sign
when you have to wait.

432
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,979
- I don't know if we made any headway.
- I thought you did great.

433
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:24,232
Best thing would be if they
realized their own culpability

434
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,525
in the death of a man.

435
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,195
- Hilton.
- Excuse me, Sister.

436
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,326
I'm Walter Delacroix's father.

437
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,162
Mr. Delacroix,
I'm sorry about your son.

438
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,040
Sister, I'm a Catholic.

439
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,501
How can you sit by Poncelet's side

440
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,087
without ever coming
to visit with me and my wife

441
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,297
or the Percys to hear our side?

442
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,884
How can you spend all your time
worryin' about Poncelet

443
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:54,304
and not think that maybe
we needed you too?

444
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:59,559
Mr. Delacroix... I didn't think
that you wanted to... talk to me.

445
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,645
Earl, are you goin' in?

446
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,231
This is Mary Beth and Clyde Percy.

447
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,027
- I'm sorry about your daughter.
- Yeah. So are we. Excuse us.

448
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,741
Listen, Sister.

449
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:19,329
I'm sure you've seen a side of Matt
Poncelet that none of us has seen.

450
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:23,583
I'm sure he's on his best behavior
and must be pretty sympathetic to you.

451
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:27,546
But, Sister, this is an evil man.

452
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,674
This is a man
who abducted teenage kids

453
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,927
and raped... and killed them.

454
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:38,265
That scum robbed me of my only son.

455
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:42,394
My name... my family name dies with me.

456
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:47,190
There will be no more Delacroixs,
Sister. No more.

457
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,277
I want you to know I do care
about you and your family

458
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,904
and what happened to your son.

459
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:57,784
I'm gonna give you my number and
if there's anything that you need,

460
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,537
- you just call me.
- Me call you?

461
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:07,878
Think about that, Sister.
Think about how arrogant that is.

462
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,130
Excuse me.

463
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,594
You all right?

464
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,639
We better be gettin' on in.

465
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,326
It is the finding of this board that
clemency be denied to Matthew Poncelet.

466
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:43,830
Execution will be carried out
as scheduled one week hence.

467
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,499
(Hilton) Don't give up hope, Matt.

468
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:49,252
We still got a judge
that can put a stop to this.

469
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,588
Then there's the US Supreme Court
and the governor.

470
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,466
I'll get a private meeting.

471
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,052
You're all I got, Sis.

472
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,346
They tell me I can have
a spiritual adviser of my choice.

473
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,264
Will you do it?

474
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,936
Ride along into the sunset with me.

475
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:14,694
You're gonna have to spend several hours
with him every day as his death nears.

476
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:19,574
And on the day of his execution you're
gonna have to spend all day with him.

477
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,202
It's not an easy job.

478
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:27,040
Usually it's done by a chaplain
or a priest or a Muslim cleric.

479
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,503
I want you to be realistic about this.

480
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:36,258
We've got about a one in 1,000 chance
things might go our way.

481
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,301
It's a tough road.

482
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,686
If that had been a king,
you could have gone back over again.

483
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:51,565
You can jump three this way,
then go all the way back.

484
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:54,985
She got that big old bad joker
and she don't wanna put it down.

485
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,071
All right. My turn. My turn.

486
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,782
I got an ace. I'm really lucky.

487
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,743
Whose was this?

488
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,704
(radio) Oh, please don't kill him.

489
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,541
He's a child of God.
He's a poet, blah, blah, blah.

490
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:13,044
Attention all ye advocates
of killers and child molesters,

491
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,130
ye opponents of execution.

492
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,716
Ye cannot walk upon the high ground.

493
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,844
Ye do not have
the moral authority to walk there.

494
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,763
Ye traverse with scum
and scum is where ye...

495
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,852
(doorbell)

496
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,321
What do you want?

497
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,573
Mr. Delacroix,
forgive me for intrudin',

498
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,910
but I haven't been able to get
you and your wife out of my mind.

499
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:49,289
I've been tryin' to call you
but there's been no answer.

500
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,458
Can I please speak with you?

501
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,418
Sure.

502
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:02,427
I'm really sorry for not comin' to visit
with you and your wife before this.

503
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:07,474
But... I've never been involved
in anything like this before.

504
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,434
Truth is you're scared.

505
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,979
Yes.

506
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,565
I'd be too.

507
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,569
- Come in.
- Thank you.

508
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,910
Sister... Can I ask you a question?

509
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:32,832
- Are you a communist?
- Communist? No.

510
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:39,172
That's what some people are sayin'
with you defendin' this murderer.

511
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,677
But I didn't think so. Sit down.

512
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,553
Thank you.

513
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:54,229
- Care for some coffee?
- Thank you.

514
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,108
Sorry about the mess.

515
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,363
My wife and I had a big fight.

516
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,865
When we got back from the hearing,

517
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:10,328
she... took Walter's clothes
out of his closet.

518
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:14,708
Put 'em in boxes. Called Goodwill.

519
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:20,005
She says she wants to
put the past behind her.

520
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:24,509
She says she...
has to move on in her life.

521
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:31,016
- She's not herself.
- That must be so hard.

522
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:37,856
When it first happened, she had me bring
her to Walter's grave every morning.

523
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,027
She wept a river, poor woman.

524
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:47,324
Whole days, nights... for weeks, months.

525
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:54,914
I wish there was some way,
some key into the past, to change it.

526
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,919
It tears me up.

527
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,009
She used to be a ball.

528
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,639
We would have us
some fun, boy. (chuckles)

529
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,851
Some times.

530
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:21,191
Laugh... Laugh our heads off.

531
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,791
Walter learned to walk
on this floor right here.

532
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:48,635
He bust his chin on the arm
of that sofa right there.

533
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,391
In that love seat right there,

534
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:01,481
he sat with Hope...
the week before they died.

535
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,533
When you lose a child

536
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,787
all the memories,
get sealed in a place.

537
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,665
Sealed.

538
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:24,129
Like a... shrine.

539
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:42,230
So, you've put in a request to be the
spiritual adviser to Matthew Poncelet.

540
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,356
Yes, Father.

541
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,860
- Why?
- He asked me.

542
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,279
This is highly unusual.

543
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:53,032
- Why?
- You would be the first woman to do it.

544
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,409
Really?

545
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:58,288
This kind of situation
requires an experienced hand.

546
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:03,668
This boy is to be executed in six days
and is in dire need of redemption.

547
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,796
Are you up to this?

548
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:12,177
I don't know, Father. I hope so.
I've been prayin' for guidance.

549
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,929
You can save this boy

550
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:19,559
by getting him to receive the
sacraments of the Church before he dies.

551
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:24,230
This is yourjob.
Nothing more, nothing less.

552
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,819
If you need any help,
please feel free to call on me.

553
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,446
Thank you, Father.

554
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,072
(thunder rumbling)

555
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,742
I don't wanna be buried here.

556
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,204
They said they'd call Mama and
ask her about the funeral arrangements.

557
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,581
Could you do that?
She'd fall apart on 'em.

558
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,374
I'll do it.

559
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,173
You ever read the Bible?

560
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,341
Yes, ma'am.

561
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,594
I ain't much of a Bible reader,
but I pick it up from time to time.

562
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,263
Like WC Fields read his Bible.

563
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,265
- Who?
- WC Fields.

564
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,601
Played this drunken character
in the movies.

565
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:05,855
He's on his deathbed and a friend
comes and sees him readin' the Bible.

566
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:11,277
The friend says "WC, you don't believe
in God. Why are you reading the Bible?"

567
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:15,657
And Fields says
"I'm lookin' for a loophole."

568
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,747
I ain't lookin' for no loophole.

569
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,668
Rain, rain, rain.

570
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:31,673
That's a bad sign. They already
executed one black - Tobias.

571
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,301
Wayne Purcell tonight.
That's two blacks.

572
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,473
Time for a white. The governor's
under pressure to get a white.

573
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,433
And that's me!

574
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:48,147
Nigger on the gurney before me. I hope
they clean it before they put me on it.

575
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,819
Was your daddy a racist?

576
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,823
- What kind of question is that?
- You have to teach a child to hate.

577
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,659
- I just don't like niggers.
- Have you known any black people?

578
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,996
They was all around when I was a kid.
Lived around me.

579
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:07,166
- Did you ever play with a black child?
- No. Me and my cousin got jumped once.

580
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,003
- What happened?
- We was throwin' rocks at 'em.

581
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,590
Next day they wait their chance,
get ahold of our bikes, tear 'em up.

582
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,675
- Can you blame 'em?
- No.

583
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,762
But slavery's long over. They always
sayin' what a bad deal they got.

584
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,725
- The kids that tore up your bike?
- I can't stand people who are victims.

585
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,977
- Victims.
- Yeah. They all victims.

586
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:30,607
I don't know any victims in my area.
I know some decent, hard-workin' people.

587
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,943
I know a lot of lazy coloreds
suckin' up tax dollars.

588
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,696
- You sound like a politician.
- What's that mean?

589
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:40,700
- You ever been the object of prejudice?
- No.

590
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,494
What do people think about
inmates on death row?

591
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,872
- Why don't you tell me?
- They're all monsters.

592
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,459
Disposable human waste
suckin' up tax dollars.

593
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,711
They gonna kill me. I'm innocent.

594
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:55,548
I ain't whinin'. I ain't sittin' on no
porch going "Slavery, slavery."

595
00:43:55,716 --> 00:44:00,803
I like rebels. Martin Luther King,
he led his people all the way to DC.

596
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:04,057
- You respect Martin Luther King?
- He put up a fight, wasn't lazy.

597
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,808
- What about lazy whites?
- Don't like 'em.

598
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,311
So it's lazy people you don't like.

599
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,647
Can we talk about somethin' else?

600
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:28,456
Jesus also said "He who lives
by the sword shall die by the sword."

601
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,250
Purcell had it coming to him.
He had it coming!

602
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:35,463
(crowd) Nine, eight, seven, six,

603
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,800
five, four, three,

604
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,427
two, one.

605
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,888
(cheering)

606
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:54,232
It's the only way we can be sure
that they will not kill again.

607
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,693
Life without parole. Oh, sure!

608
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,822
How many prison guards and prisoners
do they have to kill before it's over?

609
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:05,284
These people are mad dogs. Maniacs.

610
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,037
Come on. Let's go.

611
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,213
If the governor and the courts
turn us down,

612
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,675
Matt's gonna be dead in six days.

613
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:27,265
We gotta get us a funeral home
and... someplace to bury him.

614
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,186
Maybe our sisters will donate
one of their burial plots.

615
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,272
Somebody to do the burial service.

616
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,151
Clothes. I guess... a suit.

617
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,944
A suit?

618
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,741
What size suit do you think he wears?

619
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,702
I don't know.

620
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,038
How tall is he?

621
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,627
I don't know. I think he's... kinda big.

622
00:45:56,795 --> 00:46:02,467
What... size is kinda big?
Does it run like big, medium and petite?

623
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:12,143
Well, I don't know.
I never bought a man's suit before.

624
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:18,524
Won't you be a pretty sight?
A nun shoppin' for a man's suit!

625
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:26,032
I'm out of my league.
This is so surreal.

626
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,371
(woman) Hope had just graduated
from high school in early May.

627
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:37,168
She was to join the air force
on June 15th.

628
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,170
That's the day it happened.

629
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,672
She almost got out of Slidell.

630
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,675
She was hopin'
to get stationed overseas.

631
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:50,598
She liked to travel and loved being
around people of different cultures.

632
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:56,479
On June 15th, the recruiting sergeant
was to meet Hope in Slidell

633
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,899
and drive her to Baton Rouge
for induction.

634
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:03,486
The day before I took her shoppin'
for things she'd need.

635
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,155
You know, just practical things.

636
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:11,077
That evening about five, she dressed
and headed off to work at Coreys

637
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,204
where she waitressed.

638
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:16,415
After work she had a date with Walter.

639
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:23,089
As she was about to leave, the hem
of her skirt was comin' out and I...

640
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,342
She was in such a hurry, so...

641
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,429
I pinned it for her with one
of those tiny safety pins

642
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,599
and she was gone, out the door.

643
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,227
You don't know, when
you see your child leave,

644
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:40,314
that you're never gonna
see them alive again.

645
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,901
If I'd known that,

646
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,072
I would have told her
how much I love her.

647
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,450
You know, my last words to her,

648
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:54,745
the last that
she ever heard from me,

649
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:58,040
were about the hem of her skirt.

650
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,212
Next morning we waited for her
to come out of that door.

651
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,592
This was Hope's big day.

652
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:10,261
Our baby was leavin' home.

653
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:16,142
(Mrs. Percy) Her room was empty
and the bed was still neatly made.

654
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,937
So I telephoned the Delacroixs.

655
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:25,276
Our hearts sank when they told us that
Walter hadn't come home that night too.

656
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:29,113
And then for one brief moment
we thought, well,

657
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,618
maybe they'd run off
and gotten married or somethin'.

658
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:39,332
(Mrs. Percy) But we knew that she was
just too sensible a girl to do that.

659
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:43,377
I went down to the police
and filled out a missing person's form.

660
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:48,841
Three days later,
the sheriff formed a search party.

661
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:52,345
- I went along with 'em.
- They were gone all day.

662
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:55,348
They just walked for miles and nothin'.

663
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:58,559
On Thursday, June 20th,

664
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:03,856
some kids were walking near
Flank's Cove and they found a purse,

665
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:07,985
some clothing and a wallet.
They turned them in to the police.

666
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:14,909
They found the kids' bodies on Friday,
six days after they'd gone missin'.

667
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:22,541
(Mrs. Percy) My daughter's body
was nude, legs spread-eagled.

668
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:27,755
The coroner's report said that
her vagina was all tore up.

669
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,635
At first they couldn't find
this class pin she was wearin'

670
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:37,223
cos it was embedded so deep
from the stabbin'.

671
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:43,896
She loved that pin. She was so proud
of it. She wore it all the time.

672
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:48,567
It said "Class of '88.
Making a difference."

673
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,197
(Mr. Percy) The police wouldn't
let us identify the body.

674
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:56,158
They said it would be too traumatic.

675
00:49:56,326 --> 00:50:02,123
I just couldn't bear the thought
of them buryin' that body

676
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:06,919
without makin' absolutely and
positively sure that that was Hope.

677
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,588
So I called my brother. He's a dentist.

678
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:14,844
I asked him to go to the funeral home
and make an ID from dental records.

679
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:20,683
Before he'd stuck his hand into
that bag with all that lime in it

680
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,186
and fished Hope's jaw out,

681
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,690
he'd been against the death penalty.

682
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:31,485
And after that he was all for it.

683
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:35,531
I knew it had to be Hope.

684
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:40,745
That's what my mind told me,
you know, but I... just had to be sure.

685
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:56,927
OK. This is Sister Helen Prejean.

686
00:50:57,095 --> 00:51:00,014
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you, Emily.

687
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,433
OK?

688
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:07,271
OK. Let's go in the kitchen.
I'll make us some coffee.

689
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:21,410
(Mr. Percy) I met Poncelet face to face
in the hallway during the trial.

690
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,746
I ain't gonna get no chair, Daddy.

691
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,458
You're gonna fry.
And I'm gonna watch you sizzle.

692
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,504
There was a sheriff
standin' pretty close by me.

693
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:35,841
I could have grabbed his gun.
I could have shot Poncelet right there.

694
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:40,012
I could have killed him on that day.
I wished I would have.

695
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,432
I'd be a happier man today.

696
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,106
So what made you change your mind?

697
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:54,360
- Change my mind?
- What made you come round to our side?

698
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:05,204
I just... wanted to come and see

699
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:09,041
if I could help y'all and pray with you.

700
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,751
Thank you.

701
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,088
But...

702
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:22,388
He asked me to be his spiritual adviser,
to be with him when he dies.

703
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,015
And what did you say?

704
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,310
That I would.

705
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,480
We thought you'd changed your mind.

706
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,358
We thought that's why you were here.

707
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,655
No.

708
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,911
- How can you come here?
- How can you do that?

709
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,248
How can you sit with that scum?

710
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:53,085
Mr. Percy, I've never
done this before. I'm...

711
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,546
I'm tryin'...

712
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,593
I'm just tryin' to follow
the example of Jesus,

713
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:06,640
who said that every person
is worth more than their worst act.

714
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:10,186
This is not a person. This is an animal.

715
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:14,398
No, I take that back. Animals don't
rape and murder their own kind.

716
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:18,277
Matthew Poncelet is God's mistake.

717
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:22,656
And you want to hold
the poor murderer's hand?

718
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,409
You wanna be there
to comfort him when he dies?

719
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:28,287
There wasn't anybody
in the woods to comfort Hope

720
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:31,874
when those two animals pushed her
face down into the wet grass!

721
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:36,879
I just wanna help him
take responsibility for what he did.

722
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,591
Does he admit to what he did?
Is he sorry?

723
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:45,471
- He says he didn't kill anybody.
- Sister, you're in way over your head.

724
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:49,016
You don't know what it's like
to carry a child and give birth

725
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:53,145
and get up with a sick child
in the middle of the night.

726
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,773
You say your prayers
and get a good night's sleep.

727
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:59,235
(Mr. Percy) My parents raised me
to respect the religious.

728
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:02,404
Sister, I think you need
to leave this house right now.

729
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,366
I'm sorry.

730
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,326
Wait a minute.

731
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:11,747
If you really are sorry and you
really do care about this family,

732
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,500
you'd wanna see justice done
for our murdered child.

733
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,794
You can't have it both ways.

734
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:20,673
You can't befriend that murderer
and expect to be our friend too.

735
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,635
You brought the enemy
into this house, Sister. You gotta go.

736
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,900
I come from a good family.
My family can't be blamed for nothin'.

737
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:43,153
I had two families.
Both of 'em I'd live and die for.

738
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:47,408
- Your other family is?
- The family of man. Of men in prison.

739
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,702
My white family, the Aryan brotherhood.

740
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,538
You're a white supremacist,
a follower of Hitler?

741
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,708
Hitler was a leader. I admire him
for gettin' things done.

742
00:54:55,875 --> 00:55:00,129
Like Castro. Hitler might have gone
overboard with the killin' stuff,

743
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,673
but he was on the right track
about the Aryan race.

744
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,384
The right track?
The murder of six million Jews?

745
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,552
That's never been proven.

746
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,680
What am I doin' with this guy?
I'm nuts.

747
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,560
...political assassination
of Castro, Allende, Sandinistas...

748
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:15,936
(phone)

749
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,938
The government shouldn't...

750
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,274
- Hello?
- Sister? Hilton Barber.

751
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,527
We need you to come in
for a strategy meeting.

752
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,530
In the Shreveport Times,

753
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,408
Poncelet says that if he
had to do it all over again,

754
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:35,497
he would do something useful like
bombing government buildings.

755
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,167
We must get him off
this political prisoner kick.

756
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,253
Henry, how close are we
on the supreme court docket?

757
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:44,548
- A couple of days.
- We don't have a couple of days!

758
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,926
- We don't have the legal staff, Hilton.
- You've had it three days.

759
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:51,930
- Where were you yesterday anyway?
- I had to take my kid to the dentist.

760
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,932
A man's gonna die on death row and...

761
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,352
My kid needed to
hold her daddy's hand.

762
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:01,190
If you don't like it, find another
lawyer to volunteer his time.

763
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,449
People are thinkin'
you're some kind of a nut.

764
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:14,787
Admirin' Hitler and wantin' to come back
as a terrorist and blow people up!

765
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,581
I didn't say people.
Government buildings, not people.

766
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,042
How can you bomb a building
without hurtin' somebody?

767
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,836
I ain't got no love
for the US government.

768
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:27,049
You're a fool. You are makin' it
so easy for them to kill you.

769
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:32,471
Comin' across as a crazed, animal, Nazi,
racist, mad dog who deserves to die.

770
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,847
Is that what you think?

771
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:36,058
You are makin' it
so difficult to help you.

772
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,977
- You can leave.
- I'm not gonna do that.

773
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,857
It's up to you.
You want me to go, you say so.

774
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,575
Do you ever think about those kids?

775
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,702
It's terrible what
happened to them kids.

776
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,996
It didn't have to happen.

777
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:01,708
Do you ever think about what
you and Vitello did to their parents?

778
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:05,170
It's hard to have sympathy for them
when they want to kill me.

779
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:10,092
Well, think about it.
Their kids are shot, stabbed, raped,

780
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,095
left in the woods to die alone.

781
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,432
What if it happened to your mama
or your little brother?

782
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:20,060
- What would you wanna do to them?
- I'd sure as hell wanna kill 'em.

783
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:23,730
I understand them parents,
but they callin' for the wrong head.

784
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,983
- I wanna take a lie detector test.
- What?

785
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:31,572
It won't change their minds, but I want
my mama to know I didn't kill any kids.

786
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,166
Boy, that's good.

787
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:50,966
Hey, y'all! Havin' a party! Palmer.

788
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:54,470
- Herbie, how's your side feelin'?
- OK.

789
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,597
- Kenitra, how are you doin'?
- Fine.

790
00:57:56,764 --> 00:58:00,267
- Come on, Kenitra. Let's go.
- Bye-bye.

791
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,104
Wait a minute. What happened?

792
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:08,275
There's talk in the neighborhood.

793
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:12,571
Someone read some of Poncelet's racist
comments. Your name was in the article.

794
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,073
Oh, Lord.

795
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:17,326
You haven't been at the learning centre.

796
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,829
They think you care more
about him than your classes.

797
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:27,377
- Colleen, I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. I still love you.

798
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,421
I just thought you should know.

799
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,882
Oh!

800
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,010
I got this at Goodwill.

801
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:42,726
I talked to Bishop Norwich.
He said he would say the funeral mass.

802
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:47,356
I also found a funeral home
willing to donate their services.

803
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:52,069
The leaders of the congregation met and
we can use one of our own burial plots.

804
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:57,366
If Matt dies, guess who
he'll be buried next to.

805
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,536
- Who was the last person to die?
- Sister Celestine.

806
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,205
Oh, Lord.

807
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:07,459
Remember when that sweet little girl
came to introduce her husband to us?

808
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:11,463
Sister Celestine said "I'm glad I'll
never have to share my bed with a man."

809
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,800
- She loved her celibacy so much.
- I know.

810
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:19,388
She's gonna be lyin' next to a man
for all eternity.

811
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:40,409
My daughter's killer can possibly
get out on parole in another year.

812
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,662
He's only served six.

813
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:48,166
I can't bear the thought
of him bein' a free man

814
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:52,296
and her buried in the ground
and dead for ever.

815
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:57,301
(woman)... was killed by her ex-husband.

816
00:59:57,468 --> 01:00:02,764
(second woman)... stabbed to death
in our backyard by my son's best friend.

817
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,349
He'd spent the night at our house

818
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:07,686
and gone to church with us
that very morning.

819
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,564
(man) I've just lost my child.

820
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:18,780
(woman) When our child was killed,
it took over a week to find her body.

821
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:24,202
The DA's office treated us
like we were the criminals.

822
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:29,583
My wife...
filed for divorce this afternoon.

823
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:36,965
We just have different ways
of dealing with our son's death.

824
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:42,554
"Until death do us part."

825
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,142
We're nothin' special.

826
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,562
Most folks that lose a kid split up.

827
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,357
70% or somethin'.

828
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:56,777
I just wish I could laugh,
find somethin' funny.

829
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,238
This is my car.

830
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:04,409
Thanks for invitin' me, Mr. Delacroix.

831
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,288
You take care, Sister.

832
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,342
What the fuck you doin'? What you doin'?

833
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:16,314
(gunshot)

834
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,880
Raise your arms.

835
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,427
Go ahead.

836
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,682
Have a seat in that chair.

837
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,204
Like my new digs?

838
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,707
Hi.

839
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,379
I'm pretty special.

840
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:25,258
I'm pretty special.
Have this place all to myself.

841
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,347
They got ten guards guardin' me.

842
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,726
Got one guy that comes down every 15
minutes just to see if I killed myself.

843
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:37,229
Suicide watch.

844
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:43,401
Never had so many people
carin' about what I was doin'.

845
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,571
When did they bring you here?

846
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:49,699
Last night. Late.

847
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:53,662
Didn't say goodbye to most of the guys
on the row. They were asleep.

848
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,248
Did you take care of
that lie detector test yet?

849
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:00,252
I made some calls,
but I haven't had any luck yet.

850
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,926
So this is the end, huh?
My death-house vacation.

851
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,721
Three days of quiet.
Plenty of time to read my Bible.

852
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:17,269
Look for a loophole.

853
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:25,569
Did you read anythin'
about Jesus in that Bible?

854
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:33,285
Uh... Holy man. Did good. In heaven.

855
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,495
Praise Jesus.

856
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:40,041
There are some passages in there

857
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:43,753
about when Jesus was facin' death
alone that you might wanna check out.

858
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:47,257
I think me and Jesus have
a different way of dealin' with things.

859
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,968
He's one of them
turn-the-other-cheek guys.

860
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:55,265
It takes a lot of strength
to turn the other cheek.

861
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:58,435
You say you like rebels.
What do you think Jesus was?

862
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,813
- He wasn't no rebel.
- Sure he was. He was a dangerous man.

863
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:05,734
- Why is "love your brother" dangerous?
- Because his love changed things.

864
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,737
His love changed things.

865
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:13,325
All those people nobody cared about -
prostitutes, beggars, the poor...

866
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:16,328
...they finally had somebody
who respected them, loved them.

867
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:19,831
Made 'em realize their own worth.

868
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:24,878
They were becomin' so powerful that
the guys on the top got real nervous

869
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,839
and so they had to kill Jesus.

870
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:30,425
Kinda like me, huh?

871
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:36,765
No, Matt... Not at all like you.

872
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:41,061
Jesus changed the world with his love.
You watched while two kids were killed.

873
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,649
- (buzzer)
- Step back from the door, Sister!

874
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,151
Why? What's happenin'?

875
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:58,078
- Move it on out, boy.
- Well, Sister... What's this?

876
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:04,501
He'll be an hour, Sister.
Why don't you get some air?

877
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:07,170
- Where are they takin' him?
- I can't tell you.

878
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:25,021
Sister Helen? Chaplain Farley called.
He's at the gate. He'll be right here.

879
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,398
Thank you.

880
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:30,735
Sergeant Trapp, how long do you think
that big old tree's been there?

881
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:34,906
Ma'am, ain't no tellin'.

882
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:39,744
Saw you outside the gates
the other night at Purcell's execution.

883
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,329
Yeah.

884
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,249
- You seemed upset.
- Upset? No.

885
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:48,378
- Were you in the room when they did it?
- I'm on the strap-down team.

886
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:51,423
Left leg. That's my job. The left leg.

887
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:54,759
We take the prisoner from his cell
to the execution chamber.

888
01:06:54,927 --> 01:07:00,807
- Wow. That's gotta be tough.
- It's hard. I didn't sleep that night.

889
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:04,686
I think it's gotta affect
everybody that sees it,

890
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,563
whether they're for it or against it.

891
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:11,526
It's just part of the job. These
prisoners get what's comin' to 'em.

892
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:16,906
It's easy for someone to come in here
and make a rash judgment on procedure.

893
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:21,494
What may appear on the surface
to be irrational or unnecessary

894
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:27,125
proves upon examination to have solid
reasoning and experience behind it.

895
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,129
Father, all I want is to play a hymn
for Matt before his execution.

896
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,883
And experience tells us
that music stirs up emotion.

897
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:39,637
Emotion that can produce
an unexpected reaction in the inmate.

898
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:44,684
All right. Do you have any objection
to my asking the warden for his opinion?

899
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:50,356
I would oppose it,
but you may if you like.

900
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:54,110
Thank you. And thank you for your time.

901
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:58,323
I understand you were protesting outside
the gates during the last execution.

902
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,908
Yes.

903
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:04,662
Are you familiar with the Old Testament?
"Thou shalt not kill."

904
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:09,751
"If anyone sheds the blood of man,
by man shall his blood be shed."

905
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:15,715
Yes, Father. In the New Testament, Jesus
talks about grace and reconciliation.

906
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:20,095
Poncelet has to understand
that Jesus died for his sins.

907
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:21,513
If he accepts that,

908
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:26,643
reconciliation is his and
his soul shall have eternal life.

909
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:31,022
One's opinion of the death penalty
is not the issue here.

910
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:37,195
Look at Romans. "Let every person be
subordinate to the higher authorities.

911
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:40,949
For there is no authority
except from God.

912
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:45,703
And those who oppose it
will bring judgment upon themselves."

913
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,456
- What is it?
- She collapsed in my office.

914
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:51,376
- She's havin' a heart attack.
- I'm OK. I just fainted.

915
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,963
I just need something to eat.

916
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,598
Could you tell Matt
what happened, please?

917
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:09,018
- When we're finished here.
- No, I've gotta tell him now.

918
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:11,855
- (Farley) I'll take care of it, Sister.
- Thank you.

919
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:15,650
- Good news. This isn't a heart attack.
- I'm just hungry.

920
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:20,697
They don't let visitors eat in the death
house. They must think we feed on air.

921
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:25,785
Is that the machine
they use after an execution?

922
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:29,956
Yes, ma'am. Just have to be
official about the whole thing.

923
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:34,377
Thank God we're off the electric chair.
It's easier to take the needle.

924
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:38,131
Just part of the job, you know. Let's
get you up and put some food in you.

925
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:39,966
Who puts the needle in?

926
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,427
That's private information.

927
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,179
Is it you?

928
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:49,767
We're not allowed to disclose any
specifics regardin' execution procedure.

929
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,814
Sister, let me get you some food.
Then we'll send you home.

930
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:57,942
- I gotta get back to Matt.
- I'm sorry, Sister.

931
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:01,112
This is warden's orders.
You're through for the day.

932
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:10,038
Where'd you go yesterday? You all right?
I asked what happened. Nobody'd tell me.

933
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,916
You didn't know?
They told me they'd tell you...

934
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:16,002
They took me into that little room.
They was measurin' me...

935
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,588
- Measuring you?
- See how big a coffin I needed.

936
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,674
Then I come back and you were gone.
I spent the day alone.

937
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:24,135
Oh, Matt. I'm sorry.

938
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:28,306
I'm so sorry.

939
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:36,439
- You ever get lonely?
- Yeah, sure.

940
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:46,741
Sometimes on Sundays when I smell
the neighborhood barbecues

941
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:52,330
and I hear all the kids laughin'
and I'm sittin' in my room,

942
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,165
I feel like a fool.

943
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:02,173
What I miss most bein' here are women.

944
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:06,928
You know, I used to sit at the bar,
just drinkin' and listenin' to music.

945
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,681
I'd dance till
three or four in the morning.

946
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:12,183
I ain't gonna lie.
I believe in doin' it.

947
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,061
Me and my lady friends,
we'd grab a bottle, some weed...

948
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:18,356
...go out in the woods and we'd do it.

949
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,525
It's somethin' you miss, ma'am.

950
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:23,528
Let's face it.

951
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,864
If I had a husband and family, chances
are I'd be with them right now

952
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:30,868
- instead of here visitin' with you.
- Yeah, true enough.

953
01:11:31,328 --> 01:11:32,787
I'm glad you're here.

954
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:40,920
Do you want me to get a message
to your daughter?

955
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:49,387
Let her be.

956
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:55,476
Those things'll kill ya.

957
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,066
I ain't gonna let 'em break me.

958
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:06,571
I just pray God holds up my legs
on that last walk.

959
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:09,407
It's the wait, it's the countdown
that gets to you.

960
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,579
We're gonna know soon
about the federal appeal.

961
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:18,291
And Hilton and I are meeting
with the governor this evening.

962
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:21,711
Fat chance he's gonna do anything.
Risk his political butt for me?

963
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:25,423
I wish I hadn't said all that shit
about Hitler and bein' a terrorist.

964
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,467
Stupid!

965
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:32,597
Hartman says there won't be
any more media interviews.

966
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:36,768
Good. Keep my stupid mouth shut.

967
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:44,442
I arranged for a lie detector test
for tomorrow morning.

968
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,903
All right. There is some good news.

969
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:50,448
The man that's giving
the test has serious doubts

970
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,492
that they'll get an accurate result.

971
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:55,411
- Why?
- Tomorrow's the day of your execution.

972
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:59,457
You'll be under stress and the test
can mistake stress for dishonesty.

973
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,751
No problem. I'm home free.

974
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,881
You been readin' your Bible?

975
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:10,968
I tried to last night.

976
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,846
Makes me wanna sleep.

977
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:16,182
I'm tryin' to stay conscious.

978
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:24,107
I appreciate you tryin' to save me.

979
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:27,777
Me and God, we got
our thing squared away.

980
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:31,614
I know Jesus died on the cross for us,
and he's gonna take care of me

981
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,033
when I appear before God
on Judgment Day.

982
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:41,999
Redemption isn't a free admission ticket
you get because Jesus paid the price.

983
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:47,505
You gotta participate in your own
redemption. You got some work to do.

984
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:52,510
I think you should look at the Gospel of
John, chapter eight, where Jesus said,

985
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:58,641
"You shall know the truth,
and the truth shall make you free."

986
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:05,773
I'll check it out. I like that. "The
truth shall make you free." I like that.

987
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:09,819
So I pass that lie detector test,
I'm home free.

988
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:12,864
Matt...

989
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:19,704
If you do die... as your friend,
I wanna help you die with dignity.

990
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:22,498
You can't do that unless you own up...

991
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:25,960
...to the part you played
in Walter and Hope's death.

992
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:46,898
Hilton Barber, Bishop Norwich.

993
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:49,484
Pleasure, Bishop. Here's the situation.

994
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:53,905
Governor Benedict is a reluctant
supporter of capital punishment.

995
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:57,366
He has the power to stop this execution
and save a man's life.

996
01:14:57,534 --> 01:15:00,244
It's the last vestige
of the divine right of kings.

997
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:03,623
The trick is that we have to appeal
to him on a personal level,

998
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:05,208
without any fanfare.

999
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,418
That's why this is a private meeting.

1000
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:10,171
You must understand that,
in representing the State,

1001
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:15,927
I must carry out the laws and must
submerge my own personal views

1002
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:20,097
to carry out the will of the people.
I'll look carefully at this case.

1003
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:25,436
But unless there's some clear,
striking evidence for innocence,

1004
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:28,231
I will not interfere with the process.

1005
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:33,194
We still got the court, Sister.

1006
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:37,323
We might hit pay dirt
on one of the legal issues.

1007
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:45,289
(Mrs. Prejean) Helen!
Helen, come to dinner!

1008
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:51,462
You're looking for a love
that's so big, it takes in all evil.

1009
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:56,008
Annunciations are common.
Incarnations are rare.

1010
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:58,219
You're not a saint, Helen.

1011
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:06,477
Helen. Helen.

1012
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:08,646
Helen.

1013
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:11,399
- Helen.
- Oh, Mama.

1014
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:17,530
- Are you OK?
- Oh, yes. I was just dreamin'.

1015
01:16:19,032 --> 01:16:22,618
- What time do you have to be there?
- Nine sharp.

1016
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:26,247
- Did you set a clock?
- Yeah.

1017
01:16:27,874 --> 01:16:30,543
Oh... It's so bizarre.

1018
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:35,840
A man's gonna be killed
in front of me tomorrow.

1019
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:41,345
- Has he admitted anything?
- Oh, no.

1020
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:47,184
He's so full of hate.
He doesn't trust anybody. He just...

1021
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:49,895
He keeps pushin' me away.

1022
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:54,275
You're in deep water, kid.

1023
01:16:56,236 --> 01:16:59,363
Do you remember
when you gave me a black eye?

1024
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:04,201
- I had a fever.
- You were delirious, hysterical.

1025
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:08,122
You were trying to get up
and run into the street.

1026
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:13,711
You socked me in the eye
and you said you hated me.

1027
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:16,964
You screamed, but I held you.
I held you tight.

1028
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:22,345
Cos a mother's arms are strong
when her child's in danger.

1029
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:43,282
I didn't sleep at all last night.

1030
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:47,578
I didn't take that nerve medicine
they wanted to give me.

1031
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,415
I'm lookin' death in the eyes.
I'm gettin' ready to go.

1032
01:17:56,963 --> 01:18:02,510
Listen, Matt, I want you to know
that I respect your need for privacy.

1033
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:06,931
If you wanna be alone,
or be just with your family today,

1034
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:08,766
I understand. I won't be offended.

1035
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:11,102
You should be there, ma'am.

1036
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:14,063
I'm gonna want somebody to talk to,
be there till the end.

1037
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:15,898
I'll be there.

1038
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:22,947
If only I knew I would die right away
with the first shot. Will I feel it?

1039
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,163
The lungs go first.

1040
01:18:31,331 --> 01:18:35,626
Like a... fast choke.

1041
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,797
That's gotta hurt.

1042
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:48,139
They say that, uh...
the body doesn't move.

1043
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:51,767
Doesn't shake.

1044
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:01,360
My poor mama.

1045
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,993
(Helen) Any word from the Fifth Circuit?

1046
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:11,328
(Hilton) None yet. That's a good sign.

1047
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:15,791
They've had it a good while. Maybe that
means they see something substantive.

1048
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:19,670
- I gotta go. I'll call you later.
- Thanks, Hilton.

1049
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,884
Tell me somethin', Sister.

1050
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:28,512
What is a nun doin'
in a place like this?

1051
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,848
Shouldn't you be teachin' children?

1052
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:33,517
Do you know what this man has done?

1053
01:19:33,685 --> 01:19:35,478
How he killed them kids?

1054
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:39,857
What he did was evil.
I don't condone it.

1055
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:43,110
I just don't see the sense in killing
people to say killing's wrong.

1056
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,738
You know how the Bible says
an eye for an eye?

1057
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:48,491
The Bible also asks
for death as a punishment

1058
01:19:48,658 --> 01:19:51,327
for adultery,
prostitution, homosexuality,

1059
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:55,623
trespass upon sacred ground, profaning
the Sabbath and contempt of parents.

1060
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:59,126
I ain't gonna get into no Bible quotin'
with no nun, cos I'm gonna lose.

1061
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:05,382
(laughter)

1062
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:13,724
She was only on the phone a few minutes

1063
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:17,478
and she was fallin'
for the old Matt charm.

1064
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:21,565
I had to take back that phone.
You were tryin' to steal my gal.

1065
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:24,568
- You dog!
- She sounds like a great little gal.

1066
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:26,737
She ain't so little, though.

1067
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:31,283
You take care of her, Craig.
Don't do nothin' stupid.

1068
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:35,663
She looks a bit like... What was
that girlfriend you had in high school?

1069
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,915
I had lots of girls in high school.

1070
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,918
- The one with the funny name.
- Funny name?

1071
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,920
Maddie... Maldy. Maldy?

1072
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:46,799
- Madrigal.
- Madrigal. Madrigal.

1073
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:49,718
Madrigal Parmelee. Oh, she was hot!

1074
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:53,430
- She was a nasty little thing!
- Matthew.

1075
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:56,350
Sorry, Mama. She was a fine,
upstanding young woman.

1076
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:04,817
How about you, Troy?
Got yourself a little girlfriend?

1077
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:06,277
No.

1078
01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:08,487
- Why not?
- Ain't got time.

1079
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:10,614
Too much fishin' and campin' to do.

1080
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:13,784
- Troy just got a new tent.
- What kinda tent you got?

1081
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:17,037
Army tent. Not like them
sissy ones with all them colors.

1082
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:20,082
- Tell Matt about the other night.
- Campin' in the backyard.

1083
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:23,669
I made him come in. I was worried.

1084
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:26,171
I went out there
and I made him come in.

1085
01:21:26,339 --> 01:21:27,882
Mama, that ain't what happened.

1086
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:30,885
- Go on. Tell him.
- Come on.

1087
01:21:33,096 --> 01:21:37,099
Me and my buddy Paul put up the tent,
cooked our own dinner.

1088
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:41,896
We roasted potatoes in tinfoil on the
fire and cooked us some weenies.

1089
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:44,148
Then what? Go on.

1090
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:48,736
- About midnight...
- About nine o'clock, I think.

1091
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:51,947
- We heard some kinda animal.
- What kinda animal?

1092
01:21:52,115 --> 01:21:53,240
It was big.

1093
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,743
- Was it a bunny?
- A possum?

1094
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,912
- Was it a squirrel?
- Was it a mouse?

1095
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:03,292
- Shut up! It was big and nasty.
- Look me in the eye, little man.

1096
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,629
Did you go in cos Mama told you to
or cos you were scared?

1097
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:08,464
Now tell the truth.

1098
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,802
Look me in the eye.

1099
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,015
We got him!

1100
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:26,190
Some people ask about your funeral.

1101
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:29,276
I get real angry and say
"He's not dead yet."

1102
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:52,091
(shoes squeaking)

1103
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:29,211
- Sorry, folks. We have to wrap this up.
- It's early, isn't it?

1104
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:31,422
Rules say they can stay till 6:45.

1105
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:37,386
It's time for you folks
to be leavin' now.

1106
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:01,452
- Here you go, Poncelet.
- Thanks, man.

1107
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:04,204
I got my stuff in these pillowcases.

1108
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,081
I'd like it if y'all
took it home with you.

1109
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:10,252
I don't want the prison sendin' it.
Craig, you can divide up the stuff.

1110
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:14,506
Except my boots from Marion. I want
to walk to my execution in these boots.

1111
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:16,592
Up on your feet.

1112
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:19,636
Y'all say your goodbyes now.

1113
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:40,324
(Craig) See you later, Matt.

1114
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:47,456
- Bye.
- No goodbyes, little man.

1115
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:51,001
- No, ma'am.
- Can't she hug him?

1116
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,172
I'm sorry, Sister. Security reasons.

1117
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:06,600
Don't cry, Mama.
I don't wanna see no cryin'.

1118
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:09,103
I'm not sayin' goodbye now.

1119
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:13,065
- I'll call you tonight.
- See you, Matt. Stay strong.

1120
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:16,401
Don't cry, Mama. I'll call you later.

1121
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:19,738
We love you, Mattie.

1122
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:32,918
If I'd put my arms around my boy,
I'd never have let go.

1123
01:25:38,049 --> 01:25:40,008
(sobbing)

1124
01:25:45,181 --> 01:25:46,890
Is my mama all right?!

1125
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:49,935
She's fine, Matt.

1126
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:53,897
All right. Goodbye.

1127
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:04,908
I never had shrimp before.
They're pretty good.

1128
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:12,082
So what did he say? What's the word
on the lie detector test?

1129
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,837
Your answers showed stress,
as predicted

1130
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:19,339
and the results were inconclusive.

1131
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:25,012
Man... Was the dude sure?
Absolutely, positively sure?

1132
01:26:27,807 --> 01:26:31,768
I felt all right answerin' them
questions. I didn't feel no stress.

1133
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:34,730
I can't believe I failed it.

1134
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:38,275
You'd have to be a robot or insane
not to feel stress now.

1135
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,903
I can't believe that test
didn't come out right.

1136
01:26:45,074 --> 01:26:49,286
Let's talk about what happened.
Let's talk about that night.

1137
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:51,747
I don't wanna talk about that.

1138
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:25,322
- Get outta the car.
- Hey, you're a pretty bunny.

1139
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:28,659
You're trespassing.
This is private property.

1140
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:30,160
Let's go.

1141
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:32,162
You're under arrest.
Step outta the car.

1142
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:34,331
We'll just leave. We didn't know...

1143
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,458
Get outta the car!

1144
01:27:36,834 --> 01:27:39,795
- Where are we going?
- There's a little bar back here.

1145
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:43,090
- Our boss is in the bar.
- We can't let you go. You been bad.

1146
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:46,051
- Our boss is gonna be pissed.
- Maybe he'll let you go.

1147
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:51,014
Well, here we are. This is the bar.

1148
01:27:51,182 --> 01:27:53,350
- Can we get you a drink?
- Kneel down.

1149
01:27:54,185 --> 01:27:55,435
I'm pissed off!

1150
01:27:55,603 --> 01:28:00,315
Pissed off at them kids. Pissed off
at their parents comin' to see me die.

1151
01:28:00,483 --> 01:28:02,693
Pissed off at myself
for lettin' Vitello do it.

1152
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:06,196
I got my last words. I know what to say
to the Percys and the Delacroixs.

1153
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:08,532
Your last words
will be words of hatred?

1154
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:11,159
Clyde Percy wants
to inject me hisself!

1155
01:28:11,327 --> 01:28:13,870
Think of how angry he must be.

1156
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:16,540
He's never gonna see his daughter again.

1157
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,876
Never hold her, love her,
laugh with her.

1158
01:28:20,044 --> 01:28:25,007
You've robbed these parents of so much.
They have nothin' but sorrow. No joy.

1159
01:28:25,174 --> 01:28:26,758
That is what you have given them.

1160
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:35,392
- What possessed you to be in the woods?
- I told ya. I was stoned outta my head.

1161
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:40,397
You were harassing couples for weeks
before this happened. Months!

1162
01:28:42,233 --> 01:28:45,152
- What was it?
- What do you mean?

1163
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,655
Did you look up to Vitello?
Did you think he was cool?

1164
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:51,199
Did you wanna impress him?

1165
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:53,744
I don't know.

1166
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:57,205
- You could have just walked away.
- He went psycho on me.

1167
01:28:57,373 --> 01:29:00,250
Don't blame him. You blame him,
the government, drugs.

1168
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:03,628
You blame blacks, the Percys,
the kids for bein' there!

1169
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:06,381
What about Matthew Poncelet
in this story?

1170
01:29:06,549 --> 01:29:09,051
What is he? Just an innocent? A victim?

1171
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,269
I ain't no victim.

1172
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,775
(door opens)

1173
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:29,112
Poncelet.

1174
01:29:33,409 --> 01:29:37,204
The federal appeals court
turned you down.

1175
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,289
I'm sorry.

1176
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:50,801
Sister, please step into the corridor.

1177
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,388
I'll be right outside.

1178
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:06,650
- (Hilton) Matt?
- Yeah.

1179
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:09,152
(typing)

1180
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:14,950
- I'm sorry, son. I feel like I failed.
- No, you didn't fail. You didn't.

1181
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:17,911
I appreciate everythin'
you and the others done for me.

1182
01:30:18,996 --> 01:30:23,166
- What is she typin'?
- The forms for the witnesses to sign.

1183
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:25,669
You didn't fail.

1184
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:28,922
The justice system in this country
failed me. It stinks bad.

1185
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,675
I'm gonna head out there right now.

1186
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:47,274
Oh, God, help me.
This is such a terrifyin' place, Lord.

1187
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:50,819
So cold. So calculated, this murder.

1188
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:53,113
Just don't let him fall apart, God.

1189
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:58,702
Help him stay strong. Help me, Jesus,
stay strong. Help us, Lord.

1190
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:02,873
Help us stay strong. Help me.

1191
01:31:23,936 --> 01:31:26,396
They shaved the calf of my leg.

1192
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:30,817
Why?

1193
01:31:31,235 --> 01:31:33,904
I guess they was worried
they wouldn't find a vein in my arm.

1194
01:31:36,365 --> 01:31:38,492
What's that number?

1195
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:41,161
I put it on there when I was in Marion.

1196
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:44,706
In case somebody killed me,
they could identify my body.

1197
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:53,048
Did it hurt when you got all those?

1198
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:58,678
You seein' these tattoos,
you're gonna think I'm a bad person.

1199
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:04,476
Nah, you just have more color
on your body than I thought.

1200
01:32:12,276 --> 01:32:14,402
Tried to give me two shots.

1201
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:18,365
- A sedative and an antihistamine.
- Antihistamine?

1202
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:20,450
Yeah.

1203
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:24,955
If I had an allergic reaction

1204
01:32:25,122 --> 01:32:28,041
to the first shot that knocks you out,
it gets messy.

1205
01:32:31,754 --> 01:32:33,797
Somethin' I wanna give you.

1206
01:32:38,511 --> 01:32:39,761
My Bible.

1207
01:32:41,013 --> 01:32:42,973
I dated it myself.

1208
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:45,767
Hey...

1209
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:49,437
Thanks, Matt.

1210
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:53,608
Step back from the cell, Sister.

1211
01:32:56,654 --> 01:32:58,488
Time to call home.

1212
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,741
Will you stay?

1213
01:33:02,868 --> 01:33:06,246
I'll stay.
I'll just give you some privacy.

1214
01:33:13,504 --> 01:33:15,338
Hey, man.

1215
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:20,051
You know what I'm doin'.
What are you doin'?

1216
01:33:20,219 --> 01:33:24,723
Yeah. It... The time's tickin' away.

1217
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:28,518
Hey! What you doin' grabbing the phone?

1218
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:30,687
Gonna sleep in that tent tonight?

1219
01:33:32,481 --> 01:33:35,066
Hey, Mama. I'm waitin' to talk to you.

1220
01:33:35,234 --> 01:33:38,361
Don't cry, Mama. Don't cry.

1221
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:41,031
Don't cry. (sniffs)

1222
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:50,373
That's not what it was, Mama.
That's not what it was.

1223
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:54,836
I was... (sniffs) I was small.

1224
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:01,426
It had nothin' to do with that guy.

1225
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:06,139
Yeah, I can hear him.
Let me talk to him.

1226
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:10,393
Hey, Troy. You take care of Mama, OK?
All right, little man?

1227
01:34:10,561 --> 01:34:12,520
You take care of Mama.

1228
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:16,608
Mama? Mama?

1229
01:34:18,235 --> 01:34:22,530
(sobbing) I love you, Mama.
I love you, Mama.

1230
01:34:25,034 --> 01:34:27,202
I just let it flow.

1231
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:29,579
Told my mama I loved her.

1232
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:34,668
Talked to each of the boys.
I hate saying goodbye.

1233
01:34:34,835 --> 01:34:38,588
I just told 'em, if I get a chance,
I'd call right before I go.

1234
01:34:41,258 --> 01:34:44,427
What, Matt? What is it?

1235
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:49,516
My mama said it was that Vitello.

1236
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:52,769
She'd always regret
that I got involved with him.

1237
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:57,107
I didn't want her thinkin' that.

1238
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:01,653
It was somethin' that you said.
I coulda walked away.

1239
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:05,031
I didn't.

1240
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:11,162
I was a victim.

1241
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:15,625
I was a fuckin' chicken.

1242
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:18,128
He was older and tough as hell.

1243
01:35:18,295 --> 01:35:23,007
I was just... boozin' up, tryin'
to be as tough as him. I couldn't...

1244
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:27,095
I didn't have the guts
to stand up to him.

1245
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:33,143
I told my mama I was yellow.

1246
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:40,650
She kept sayin' "It wasn't you, Matt.
It wasn't you. It wasn't you."

1247
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:45,405
Your mama loves you, Matt.

1248
01:35:47,491 --> 01:35:49,492
That boy...

1249
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:54,539
Walter.

1250
01:35:54,707 --> 01:35:56,541
Yeah?

1251
01:36:01,213 --> 01:36:03,173
What?

1252
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:06,593
I killed him.

1253
01:36:13,559 --> 01:36:17,020
- And Hope?
- No, ma'am.

1254
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:20,690
Did you rape her?

1255
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,196
Yes, ma'am.

1256
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,368
Do you take responsibility
for both of their deaths?

1257
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:34,245
Yes, ma'am.

1258
01:36:36,373 --> 01:36:40,001
When the lights dimmed last night, I
kneeled down and I prayed for them kids.

1259
01:36:40,169 --> 01:36:42,086
I never done that before.

1260
01:36:42,254 --> 01:36:44,547
Oh, Matt...

1261
01:36:46,926 --> 01:36:50,303
There are spaces of sorrow
only God can touch.

1262
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:53,515
You did a terrible thing, Matt.
A terrible thing.

1263
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:58,561
But you have a dignity now.
Nobody can take that from you.

1264
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:03,316
You are a son of God, Matthew Poncelet.

1265
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:17,747
Nobody ever called me
no son of God before.

1266
01:37:18,749 --> 01:37:22,418
Called me a son of you-know-whats
a lot of times. Never no son of God.

1267
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:26,381
I just hope my death can give
them parents some relief.

1268
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:30,301
Maybe the best thing you can give
to the Percys and the Delacroixs

1269
01:37:30,469 --> 01:37:32,720
is a wish for their peace.

1270
01:37:32,888 --> 01:37:35,431
You know, I never had
no real love myself.

1271
01:37:37,017 --> 01:37:40,270
Never loved a woman
or anybody else much good.

1272
01:37:43,941 --> 01:37:46,943
It figures I'd have to die to find love.

1273
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,453
Thank you for lovin' me.

1274
01:38:03,085 --> 01:38:05,295
(guard laughs)

1275
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:13,136
Look at the time. It's been flyin'.

1276
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:16,931
I'm really cold.

1277
01:38:17,099 --> 01:38:20,226
Can he have a jacket or somethin'?
He's cold.

1278
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:28,151
What happened to that song
you were gonna play for me?

1279
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:30,320
- The hymn?
- Uh-huh.

1280
01:38:30,487 --> 01:38:33,907
They have a rule you can't
have music in the prison.

1281
01:38:34,491 --> 01:38:36,659
So they won't let me play it.

1282
01:38:37,828 --> 01:38:40,663
Well, you know the words.
You could sing it.

1283
01:38:40,831 --> 01:38:42,832
- I can't sing.
- That's OK.

1284
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,751

I need you to step into the corridor,
Sister.

1298
01:41:37,382 --> 01:41:39,634
Gimme my boots! I want my boots!

A grown man goin' to his death

I'll be done with all of this.

No more bars, no more cells,
no more life in a cage!

- Matt...
- Sister Helen, I'm gonna die.

1303
01:41:55,567 --> 01:41:58,569
You know the truth.
The truth has made you free.

1304
01:41:59,321 --> 01:42:01,531
God knows the truth about me.

1305
01:42:01,698 --> 01:42:05,201
I'm goin' to a better place.
I'm not worried about nothin'.

1306
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:07,495
You all right?

1307
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:10,498
Yes. I'm OK.

1308
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:13,209
- Christ is here.
- I'm not worried about anything.

1309
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:15,128
OK.

1310
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:21,300
Look. I want the last thing you see
in this world... to be a face of love.

1311
01:42:23,303 --> 01:42:27,890
So you look at me
when they do this thing.

1312
01:42:28,058 --> 01:42:29,725
You look at me.

1313
01:42:30,894 --> 01:42:33,563
I'll be the face of love for you.

1314
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:35,648
Yes, ma'am.

1315
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:41,737
(warden) Time to go, Poncelet.

1316
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:50,955
- Can Sister Helen touch me?
- Yes, she may.

That's as far as you go, Sister.

1329
01:43:56,813 --> 01:43:59,232
Will you check in on my mama
from time to time?

1330
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:02,026
Yes, Matt. You have my word on that.

1331
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:02,355
Do you have any last words, Poncelet?

1332
01:46:05,317 --> 01:46:07,234
Yes, sir. I do.

1333

Mr. Delacroix...

1334

...I don't wanna leave this world
with any hate in my heart.

1335
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:24,335
I ask your forgiveness for what I done.

1336
01:46:25,337 --> 01:46:29,090
It was a terrible thing I done
in taking your son away from you.

How about us?

1338
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:36,972
Mr. And Mrs. Percy,
I hope my death gives you some relief.

1339
01:46:44,439 --> 01:46:46,774
I just wanna say...

1340
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:50,653
...I think killin' is wrong,
no matter who does it.

1341
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:54,865
Whether it's me, or y'all,

May almighty God bless you, the Father,
