00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:10,524
Why? Because I'm a cop.
It's my job to ask questions.

Indigent?

318

That means "poor."

319

- It's called post-traumatic stress syndrome.

Sometimes a person sees something
they just can't deal with.

Welcome to Memphis, home of the king.
City of the good abode.

ROY:
What do you know, McThune?

359
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:15,792
Uh, kid's name is Mark Sway. He told Memphis
P.D. that he and his younger brother...

360
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,504
...just stumbled on the body in the woods,
and then ran and called the cops.

361
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,214
- I think he's lying.
- Why's that?

362
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,258
We lifted his prints off a Sprite can...

363
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,428
...they match prints that
were all over the car, inside and out.

364
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,222
I think he was in that car
before Clifford shot himself.

365
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,267
And he was there for a while
because of the number of prints.

366
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,394
- Why would the kid lie?
- One, he's scared.

367
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,105
Two, he's a kid, they always lie.
Adults are the enemy.

368
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:41,026
And three, maybe Romey Clifford told him
something he knows he should not know.

369
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,570
People hate to die with secrets.
That's good work, McThune.

How you doing, Paulie?

00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:19,774
Guess Johnny means business,
bringing you here.

915
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,235
- Where's the kid?
- With that bitch lawyer.

916
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,529
Got a private dick tailing him.

917
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,239
Any sign of the fibbies?

918
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,409
Yeah, a couple, watching the hospital,
same as we are.

919
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:32,078
I gave that kid a little warning last night.

920
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,372
This is the directive:

921
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:39,002
We bug everything, hospital room,
lawyer's office, the works.

922
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:41,421
Find out what the kid knows.

923
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:45,258
That doesn't work, we kill them all.

How's he doing?

MOMMA:
Oh, when he gets hungry, he'll come in.

926
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:53,016
REGGIE: It's a lucky thing a car
only comes by here every four hours.

927
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,268
That is one willful child, Regina.

You're the kid at the hospital, right?

Uh-huh.

How's your brother doing?

00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,557
Come on back here.

MOMMA: Why, hello there.
- Take me back to the hospital.

942
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,404
- Want some lemonade?
- I'm not taking you anywhere...

943
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:51,115
- ...until we've had a conversation.
- Or a piece of pie?

944
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,493
Where's a phone? I need to call a cab.

945
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:56,287
Help yourself.
It's, uh, 40 dollars from here, Momma?

946
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:59,248
Or 45? I'm not sure, something with a tip.

947
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:03,002
Look, you're fired, okay?
Can't you get that through your thick head?

948
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:06,839
Fine. Because I cannot do my job
if you keep hiding things from me.

949
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:11,427
Did it ever occur to you how it made me
feel to take on Foltrigg on your behalf...

950
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:13,012
...without the facts?

951
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:15,640
I should've smelled your breath
before I hired you. ..

952
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:19,560
- ...then I would've known you was a drunk.
- Well, I think I'll be going.

953
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,021
I have been sober for 3 years.

954
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:26,192
Yeah, right. That's what all the drunks say.
How they gonna get sober and all.

955
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,653
They even say they love you,
but they don't.

956
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:32,031
Then they come home wasted
and beat on you and your mother so bad...

957
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:34,742
...you gotta hit them in the face
with a baseball bat.

958
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,453
You're talking about your daddy,
aren't you?

959
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,914
Yeah, well I got rid of him.

960
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:42,750
When me and my mom went into court
to buy a divorce...

961
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,585
...our lawyer sucked, as usual.

962
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:48,840
So I went up there and told the judge
myself about all the beatings...

963
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:52,176
...and about how
he made us sleep in the street.

964
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:55,429
And that's when my father
became my ex-father.

965
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:59,559
And now I got you,
and you're a drunk and a bad lawyer too.

966
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:02,103
So now I'm getting rid of you.
You're fired, okay?

967
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,022
I can handle this myself.

968
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:08,693
Mark.

969
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:12,321
Mark, I used to think
I could handle everything by myself.

970
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:15,575
But sometimes being strong
means asking for help.

971

I know you've been taking
real good care of your family...

...but the FBI’s
not gonna leave you alone.

973
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,668
- You gotta let me help you.
- Let go.

974
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:29,005
- I need a cigarette.

Hey, hey, hey.

What did Romey tell you in that car?

God, why do I always
have to answer questions?

978
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,848
Why don't you ever have to
answer any questions?

979
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,434
Okay, that's fair.
Go ahead, ask me something.

980
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,768
Like what?

981
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,856
Whatever you want. Go ahead,
there's no rules, there's no limits.

982
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,317
You ask me and I will answer.

983
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,776
And you'll tell the truth?

984
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:53,404
If it takes my skin off.

985
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:55,448
All right.

986
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,993
What's that thing you always wear
around your neck?

987
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:01,954
This is my mamaw's compass.

988
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,749
I wear it so I'll never lose my way again.

989
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:06,375
Hmm.

990
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:08,920
Anything else?

991
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,380
Yeah. These your kids?

992
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,508
- Yes.
- They chained down in the basement?

993
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,510
Heh, close. They're with their daddy.

994
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,721
- There was a divorce.
- You ever see them?

995
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:23,851
- They don't really wanna see me.
- Because you was drunk and on drugs.

996
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,563
Because after the divorce
I drank some, yes.

997
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:32,568
I drank a lot.

998
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,614
Why?

999
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:42,286
You're right, there must be a cigarette
around here someplace.

1000
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:47,583
Uh, I married a big Memphis doctor, worked my
ass off to put him through medical school. ..

1001
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:51,921
...and soon as he became rich and famous,
he traded me in for a younger model.

1002
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,389
I didn't have a dollar
to put food in the fridge. ..

1003
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,267
...or a car to go look for a job.

1004
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:08,062
But I figured I could handle it myself,
just like you.

1005
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,649
But I was wrong.

1006
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,277
- So then you started to drink?
- Mm-mm.

1007
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,823
First, I stopped sleeping and eating.

1008
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:22,702
I was scared to death. I kept staying up
every night, watching my babies. ..

1009
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,996
...trying to figure out
what I was gonna do.

1010
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:27,832
Finally, I took some pills to sleep.

1011
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:32,712
Hell, he prescribed them for me.
I was not trying to kill myself.

1012
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:36,424
But that's when he pounced.

1013
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:38,968
Got himself a fancy lawyer.

1014
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,803
I didn't have anybody.

1015
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:44,724
I figured after all those years
of blowing noses and wiping butts...

1016
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:47,184
...fixing meals and carpooling
the kids every which way...

1017
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,603
...that it'd count for something.

1018
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,398
I was a fool.

1019
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,277
The court declared me unfit.

1020
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:01,324
Just like that, they were gone.

1021
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,743
He took...

1022
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,537
...my little girl and my little boy, heh.

1023
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:09,874
Anyhow, that's when I started drinking.

1024
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,668
But I got myself sober...

1025
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:14,128
...I stayed sober. ..

1026
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,173
...and I put myself through law school.

1027
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:22,219
- Do you miss your kids?
- Heh.

1028
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:27,516
So much
I try not to even think about them.

1029
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,252
He told me.

1030
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,172
Romey told me where the body's buried.

1031
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,842
Do you wanna tell me?

1032
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,553
I can call the police
and put an end to this right now.

1033
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:07,473
But I swore an oath
that I wouldn't tell nobody.

...had any legally significant
conversation with Mr. Clifford...

01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,674
...is based on purely
circumstantial evidence.

to see Jerome Clifford alive.

Now, we have established
this child willfully deceived us.

1270
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:08,897
A set of fingerprints on a Cadillac
is hardly willful deceit.

1271
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:13,652
We can show the child's fingerprints
on the suicide hose and on the gun itself.

01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:17,614
We feel the child must testify for
his own good in order to exonerate himself.

Mr. Fink, are you attempting to implicate
this child in Clifford's suicide?

1274
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:26,164
No, we are not. Currently, we are alleging
only obstruction of justice.

1275
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:30,043
Now, involvement in a suicide
could constitute juvenile delinquency.

1276
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:32,587
This child could be removed
from his mother's care.

01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:34,798
Your Honor, there's no basis for this.

1278
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:38,927
Your Honor, we are only asking that
the child testify to clear his good name.

1279

We're not forcing the child to testify.
Not yet.

Ms. Love, will your client testify
and put an end to this foolishness?

Act like the FBI. You find him.

would we still get protection?

1531
01:33:39,281 --> 01:33:41,907
We make our deal
before we tell them where the body is...

1532
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:44,159
...and then just keep our fingers crossed.

1533
