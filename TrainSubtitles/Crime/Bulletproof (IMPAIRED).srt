It's a good idea to wear a wire.

I want you to make it to the end of the bar.

314
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,964
Pull it forward. There you go.
Put your weight on it.

315
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,215
Bring the other one forward.

316
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,301
Five. Five. Let's go.

319

Come on, Jack. You're ready for this.

320
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,415
I'm proud of you.

321
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,009
COP 1: The ghost himself.

322
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,220
COP 2: Not even a bullet in the head
could stop him.

323
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:05,682
One millimeter to the right or left
and he'd be dead.

324
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,602
Oh, man, I wouldn't want
to have to mess with him.

325
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:57,359
Sir!

326
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,570
Sir! Sir!

327
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,324
Where you headed, sir?

328
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:09,079
I'm going to Mexico.
I got to start my life over.

329
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,247
I'm gonna be a bullfighter.

330
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,417
Have you been drinking, sir?

331
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,879
I had about a half a beer,
but the dog had a lot.

332

(WHINING)

333
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:23,719
Would you mind stepping out of this vehicle
and walking a straight line?

334
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,220
Oh, yeah. No problem.

335
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,769
So you got Archie Moses.
What does that got to do with me?

336
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,856
Archie Moses is gonna turn state's evidence.

337
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,108
- He's rolling on Colton?
- Uh-huh.

338
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:42,362
Colton wasn't too thrilled with Moses
for bringing a cop into his organization.

339
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:44,990
He's had a hit on him ever since.

340
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,868
So now that Moses is up against it,

341
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,454
he's ready to give us Colton on a platter.

342
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,123
Jack, Steve Finch, DEA.
He's calling the shots on this.

343
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,208
And what the hell is he getting out of this?

344
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,794
- Commuted sentence.
- How commuted?

345
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:58,879
Still to be determined.

346
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,465
- Oh, bullshit! How commuted?
- Take it easy.

347
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:04,217
That little asshole shot me in my head!

348
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:06,887
Now I got this bigger asshole
telling me he's getting away with it!

349
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,138
Asshole?

350
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,724
Jack, that's not how it happened.

351
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,769
- Moses will do the time.
- You know what?

352
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:17,481
You and the DEA figure that shit out.
I don't want nothing to do with it.

353
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,648
Hold on a minute.

354
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,651
The deal with Moses.

355
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:23,653
One condition.

356
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:26,823
What condition?

357
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,329
I don't know why he wants you
to bring him in, and I don't give a shit!

358
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,581
- With him, we finish what we started.
- No.

359
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:37,667
You don't have to be afraid.
We'll send in a team for backup.

360
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:40,212
You think I'm afraid of Moses?

361
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:41,797
After the way you treated him,

362
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,508
I wouldn't be surprised
if he didn't want to put another bullet...

363
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,637
Hold on. Take it easy.

364
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,890
You're right, "Stench." I am afraid of Moses.

365
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,309
I'm afraid if I see him again, I'll kill him.

366
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:55,685
Come on.

Let someone else bring Moses' stupid ass in.

369

Far as I'm concerned, this shit is over for me.

370
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:12,077
You know your cop buddies?
They all say the same thing.

371
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:14,871
They say you're not the same man, Jack.

372

They say that when you got shot,
you lost a piece of yourself.

373
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,337
I didn't even know you then,
but do you know what I think?

374
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,630
I think they were right.

375
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,632
What are you talking about? I'm happy.

376

Come on. You pretend that you like your job.

377

Any fool can see that
it's making you miserable 8 hours a day,

378
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:34,015
and you pretend
that Archie Moses doesn't exist,

379
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,726
which is making you miserable
24 hours a day!

So, listen, babe, what are you wearing?

633

What am I wearing?

634

Yeah. You know, you wearing
that little black lacy thing I bought you?

Well, as a matter of fact, I am.

I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

649

I'm probably gonna marry this one.

Spare me your ignorant philosophy.

793

than a guy that shot me in my head.

Hey, man, can I call my mother?

799
00:53:23,952 --> 00:53:26,413
- For what?
- Because you just got me killed.

800
00:53:26,496 --> 00:53:28,248
I figure I'll talk to her one last time.

801
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:30,750
- No.
- Come on, man!

802
00:53:30,834 --> 00:53:32,544
You know I talk to her every Tuesday.

803
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:35,505
She's gonna get all nervous if I don't call.
Please.

804
00:53:36,298 --> 00:53:38,008
Do you have any change? Come on.

805
00:53:41,595 --> 00:53:45,599
I always did like your mom. How's she doing?

806
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:49,519
If she could stop drinking all that booze
and smoking all that weed,

807
00:53:49,603 --> 00:53:51,021

Hey, don't talk about my mother, by the way.

810
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,610
What are you getting all defensive about?

811
00:53:56,693 --> 00:53:59,821
Because it would break my mother's heart
if she knew what you did to me.

812

I was just doing my job.
That's what I did to you.

My mother loved you.
She said you were my only real friend.

It's ringing.

815

You didn't tell her what happened, did you?

816
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:16,838
No. I wouldn't do that.

817

Will you please help? Thank you.

818
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:28,892

819
00:54:30,477 --> 00:54:31,645

820
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,148

Yes, he is. He's right here.

You said so.

- Just talk to my mommy, Carter.

Yeah. Named Traci.
