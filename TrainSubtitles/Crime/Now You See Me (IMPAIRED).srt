00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,416
Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

168
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,917
You don't have my number.

169
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,961
I'm magic. I'll find it. Have a good night.

170
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,423
Oh, you are such an asshole.

171
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,774
(CHUCKLES)

172
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,328
DANIEL: Hey!

173
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,497
Henley.

174
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,874
Danny? Hey.

175
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,628
- Ah. You got a card, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,965
No, no, no, it's good for you. Congratulations.
All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

177
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,383
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

178
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,843
You wait out here. I will come back
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

179
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,720
Hey, Danny! I'm not your assistant anymore.

180
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,222
Nice hair.

181
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,140
DANIEL: So, um, actually,
what have you been up to?

182
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,309
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

183
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:05,145
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

184
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,065
You have a website. That's good.
Good for you. Get the word out.

185
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,483
- Oh.
- Uh...

186
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,277
Okay.

187
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,572
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

188
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,242
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

189
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,493
Yeah. Excuse me.

190
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,412
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

191
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,081
You. Now, hold it, don't tell me. Uh...

192
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,708
Helen? No, no.

193
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,084
Henley.

194
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,585
It's on your coffee cup.

195
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,170
Thanks for keeping me honest.

196
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,257
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.
It was just an observation.

197
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,927
Second observation, you are beautiful.

198
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,178
Thank you.

199
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,931
That's good.
That's very nice. Very well-polished. Nice bit.

200
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,267
J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

201
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,185
Very nice.
I know who you are and I just want to say that

202
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,270
I'm not interested in you doing

203
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,438
your mentalism thing on us.

204
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,024
Especially when we don't know
who brought us here or even if it's real.

205
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,110
Shh! Hold on, I'm sensing... I'm sensing you

206
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,862
are a control freak.

207
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,196
I'm sorry, have we met before?

208
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,740
It doesn't take a mentalist to figure that out.

209
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,866
You are a control freak.

210
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,159
Well, I take that as a compliment.

211
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,411
Only he would take it as a compliment.

212
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,788
Okay, great. Good. Another compliment.

213
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:08,083
Okay. So that's why
you're no longer a couple.

214
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,376
A couple? No, no.

215
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,544
BOTH: We were never a couple.

216
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,379
He used to saw me in half.

217
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,672
She was a very good assistant.

218
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,798
But I was too fat for Danny.

219
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,551
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

220
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,553
- There were specs.
- You built it this size.

221
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,305
No one could fit through there. No one.

222
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,681
- Rebecca fit through.
- Ah...

223
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,433
Rebecca fit for years.

224
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,226
Do you know how hard it is to stay

225
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,145
in those tiny little costumes?

226
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,230
No. I'm the main attraction.

227
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,357
Okay. So he never made you feel special.

228
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,445
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

229
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,863
That's a really nice story.

230
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,531
Hope you guys enjoy each other's company.

231
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,116
No way.

232
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,911
J. Daniel Atlas?

233
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,455
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

234
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,831
You're like...

235
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,291
I idolize you. Seriously.

236
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,793
From a true fan. It's so nice to meet you.

237
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,336
I'm Jack, by the way.

238
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,004
Question. Did you get one of these?

239
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:55,881
Yeah. Death.

240
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,050
The High Priestess.

241
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,259
I'm the Lover.

242
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,427

Hermit.

244
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,390
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

245
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,934
- Why are we just...
- BOTH: The door's locked.

246
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,645
Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.

247
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,439
Hmm.

248
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,156
HENLEY: What is this place?

249
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,451
- Ugh!
- MERRITT: Oh!

250
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,120
Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty.

251
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,922
JACK: Man, it's freezing in here.

252
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,633
HENLEY: What's that?

253
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,051
I don't know.

254
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,305
MERRITT: What's it say?

255
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,100
"Now you don't."

256
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,229
"A rose by any other name..."

(DANIEL LAUGHS)

258
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,819
JACK: Guys, what's happening?

259
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,487
Whoa.

260
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,322
Look at that.

261
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:03,991
Whoa.

262
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,455
JACK: It's gas!

263
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,749
MERRITT: Relax. Just dry ice.

264
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,543
Cool.

265
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,879
Wait. What do you think this is all about?

266
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,589
Hang on. Hang on.

268
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,803
I got nothin'.

269
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,722
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the delay.

270
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,807
I'm just trying to create the space for wisdom.

271
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,019
Okay, so you're like Buddha,
if he wasn't so enlightened.

272
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,478
And you're like Jesus,

273
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,106
if he was arrogant
and all of his miracles were fake.

274
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,443
Okay, lovebirds, get a room.
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

275
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,652
No. Wait, did you?

276
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,029
I wish.

277
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,781
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

278
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,783
Oh, great.

279
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,916

I don't know, but I really want to meet them.

00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,000
It's bad enough they got me chasing down
David Copperfield and Friends.

485
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,295
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with Interpol?

486
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,588
I look forward to working
with you, too, Agent Rhodes.

487
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,675
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

488
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,885
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

489
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,888
Oh, you did?
You spoke to my witness before me?

490
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:19,100
Your witness?
I thought you didn't want the case.

491
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,893
Besides, he's useless.

492
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,645
Oh, really? Why is that?

493
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,023
Because he believes their magic was real.

494
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,276
Oh, he believes the magic was real?
You're right, he probably is useless.

495
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,404
Is it okay with Interpol if we talk to him, too?

496
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,072
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

497
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:37,201
I have never stolen a thing in my life, okay?

498
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,620
I tried to give the money back,
but they won't take it.

499
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,332
Okay, okay, okay,
let's just say you robbed a bank.

500
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,583
I did.

501
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:44,959
Fine. Fantastic. You did.

502
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,628
But since I'm new to this,
can you explain to me how you went

503
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,131
from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

504
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,675
With the teleportation helmet.

505
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,344
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

506
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,137
He was hypnotized during the show.

507
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,306
I told you, he's useless.

508
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,184
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm done
with this other bullshit.

509
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,770
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

510
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:05,688
Hey!

511
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,565
FULLER: During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

512
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,067
to believe they were in the Philharmonic.

513
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,569
I guess that "bullshit" was the trigger word.

514
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,781
Okay. Hey, hey. Écoutez.
Etienne, come on down from there.

515
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:15,948
You're not in the Philharmonic.

516
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,659
- How do you say "stop" in French?
- Stop.

517
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:19,869
Tell him to stop.

518
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,248
No, I can't.
You just have to let him finish his movement.

519
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,209
Okay, I need a time-out.

520
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,835
Too many French people in one room.

521
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,462
- Agent Rhodes!
- Huh?

522
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,131
I'm ordered by my bosses to provide a report.

523
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,301
And until we have one, I'm here, like it or not.

524
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,178
So we can work together,

525
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:41,432
or you can continue to follow behind
asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

526
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:42,683
It's up to you.

527

(SNORING)

528
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,396
Hmm.

529
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,688
I'm not finished.

530
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,651
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

531
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,820
And I do not handle jet lag well.

532

So if you want to see who can be grumpier,

533
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,869
- I promise you, you will lose.
- Hmm.

534
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:07,083
Mm-hmm. Fine. So which one of these idiots
do you want to talk to first?

535
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,209
Him?

536
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:14,924
Dylan, for the record,

537
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,218
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate.

538
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,302
Okay.

539
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,180
That is to say, that it's not a science.
It's more for entertainment.

540
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,265
All right.

541
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,726
Just don't believe everything the guy says.
That's all.

542
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:31,524
Please convey my deepest apologies
to your colleague out there.

543
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,068
I'm really sorry about this
whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

544
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,236
I was out of line.

545
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:36,571
Tranny Tuesday?

546
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,448
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

547
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,283
Or might not have, if you believe

548
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,702
everything Agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

549
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,457
But isn't there a proud tradition in the FBI
of men wearing dresses?

550
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,878
<i>No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.</i>

551
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,466
(LAUGHS) I'm just having fun.

552
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,926
Was this your card? No.

553
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,303
See, I knew you weren't
a queen of hearts lady,

554
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,387
and I respect that.

555
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,347
The trick usually works better
when I'm not strapped in here,

556
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,474
but I understand protocol.

557
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,808
Okay, okay.

558
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,603
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

559
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,105
then how did
the playing card get into the vault?

560
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,356
Oh, yes. That would be...

561
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,941
What do the kids call it these days?

562
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,193
Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

563
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,111
Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

564
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,406
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

565
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,909
You can keep that. Don't share it with him.

566
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:26,078
It says here you are a mentalist.

567
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:29,248
- Hmm.
- What exactly is mentalism?

568
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,418
Tricks, mostly. Um, some science.

569
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:36,422
Targeted guessing
might be a most apt description.

570
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,884
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

571
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,221
Voices in my head.

00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,140
Says here you were fairly famous at one point.

574
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,433
Mm-hmm.

575
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,435
You can
even hypnotize people over the phone.

576
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:52,146
Some big tours
around the U.S. For a few years,

577
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,232
- two TV specials.
- Glory days.

578
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:57,777
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

(CLEARS THROAT)
Did your research, did you?

00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,113
DYLAN: IRS audit. Back taxes.

581
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:05,451
You've had a long hard slog back
into the limelight, haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

582
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:10,331
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down Memory Lane.

583
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,542
As far as I understand it,
when the man from Paris

584
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,751
put on the magical helmet...

585
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,835
Listen to me.

586
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,421
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

587
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:18,714
Which makes you an accomplice.

588
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,217
So if you wanna walk out of here today,
I'd suggest you start...

589
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,886
Now you listen to me, unless you think
there's a D.A. In the state of Nevada

590
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,304
who'd be willing
to make sense of this to a jury,

591
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,639
then we have a show to perform.

592
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,308
And you, Agent Rhodes,
have a drawing board to get back to.

593
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,851
Is this your first date?

594
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:32,979
What?

595
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,941
No, I mean, obviously, you guys don't
know each other well, if at all.

596
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,570
But, like,
there is a palpable tension in this room.

597
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,321
And before you get involved,

598
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:45,992
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets.

599
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,038
And I know the first one is that
this is your first time off the desk. Isn't it?

600
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,915
You should have said something to him.

601
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,042
This is a weird way for you to find out.

602
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,128
You are literally begging to be arrested.
You know that?

603
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,547
If it means you would actually do it,
then, yeah. But you won't.

604
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:03,259
Because if you did, it means that you,
and the FBI, and your friends at Interpol,

605
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,846
actually believe,
at an institutional level, in magic.

606
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,515
The press would have a field day.

607
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,392
And we'd be even more famous
than we already are.

608
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,145
And you guys would look like idiots
even more then you already are.

609
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,188
Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

610
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,525
You have,
what we in the business, like to call,

611
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,027
"nothing up your sleeve."

612
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,194
And you know it.

613
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:28,034
Don't draw him in and then dump him
because abandonment is a big "area" for him.

614
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,535
Mommy?

615
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,621
Daddy.

616
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,164
Ah! You have big daddy issues.

617
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,041
- Okay, that's enough.
- I'll tell you what.

618
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:38,377
Your average therapist is gonna charge you
$200-$300 for this sesh.

619
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,338
Me? I'll take a tenner.

620
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,716
Okay, later, if you're feeling magnanimous...

621
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,968
I'll still take a tenner.

622
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,721
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

623
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,890
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

624
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,391
And you know who put them there?

625
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:54,393
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

626
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:58,481
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

627
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,400
than you can maintain that phony arrogance.

628
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:06,405
And the instant that you even show
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

629
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,740
I'll be there.

630
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,492
I will be all over you like...

631
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,743
Like white on rice?

632
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,578
Sorry. That's unfair.

633
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,914
Let me warn you. I want you to follow.

634
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,499
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

635
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,251
we will always be one step, three steps,
seven steps ahead of you.

636
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:20,461
And just when you think you're catching up,

637
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,879
that's when we'll be right behind you.

638
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,506
And at no time will you be
anywhere other than

639
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,674
exactly where I want you to be.

640
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,843
So come close. Get all over me
because the closer you think you are,

641
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,261
the less you'll actually see.

642
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,888
- I'm gonna nail you...

643
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,602
Something wrong with that soda, Miss?

Oh! Shit!

647
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,864
First rule of magic.

648
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,951
Always be the smartest guy in the room.

649
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,851
Boss, what are we doing?
We're letting them go?

650
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,978
They all but admitted
they're gonna do it again.

651
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,063
About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

652
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,065
- What changed?
- I met them.

653
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,150
Hey. Guys.

654
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,652
Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

655
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,154
Most of it was just filler.

656
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:29,905
People that Tressler
dragged in to pack the room.

657
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,033
But guess who was sitting there in the back,
filming the whole damn thing?

658
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
I don't know.

659
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:35,703
Thaddeus Bradley.

660
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,332
Thaddeus Bradley,
the guy from TV with the DVDs and shows?

661
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,417
No.

662
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,669
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

663
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,755
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

664
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,922
Get him on the phone.

665
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:49,884
- I did. You're having lunch with him in 45.
- Good.

666
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,720
<i>WOMAN: Mr. Bradley started as a magician.</i>

667
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,513
- He was actually quite good.
- Really?

668
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,974
- One of the best.
- You don't say.

669
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,187
"The greatest genius
is in seeing through the illusion."

670
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,689
That's a man who loves his work.

671
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,942
You sure I can't interest you
in a glass of wine?

672
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:09,862
No, no, no. No, thank you, sir. We're working.

673
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,489
I will take one.

674
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,583
That's incredible. That's amazing.

675
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,377
Red dye, palmed.

676
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,130
Is that how Jesus did it? That's incredible.

677
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,548
I'm sorry. Can I just take a minute here?

678
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,926
You were one of the great magicians.
Why did you stop?

679
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,221
Do you know how many people
went to see magic performed live

680
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,889
in the last half decade?

681
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,224
About 1.6 million.

682
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:41,644
You know how many DVDs I sold
in the same period?

683
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,020
Five million.

684
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,146
Right, so it's about the money.

685
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,731
Well, the money is only there

686
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,109
because the need to know
is greater than the desire to be fooled.

687
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:53,489
Like you, I detest those
who prey upon the gullibility of the masses.

688
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,243
With all due respect,
isn't there a cost, though, to this game?

689
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:58,828
Cost?

690
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,204
I don't know. Careers.

691
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,413
Lives.

692
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:04,708
I assume you're referring to Lionel Shrike.

693
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,002
I'm sorry, who?

694
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,587
Lionel Shrike.

695
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:12,967
A middling magician who drowned
in the Hudson River 30 years ago.

696
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:16,846
On Mr. Bradley's first special,
he revealed all of Shrike's tricks.

697
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:20,432
The next year,
Shrike tried to stage a comeback.

698
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:23,853
He was shackled inside a safe,
and dropped into the river.

699
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,062
But he never resurfaced.

700
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,398
You mean he died?

701
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,275
I didn't kill him.

702
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,612
He killed himself trying to do something
he wasn't prepared to handle.

703
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,906
You do realize this is a game?

704
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,783
Believe me, it's not a game.

705
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,034
It is a game.

706
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,870
You're the game. You're being played.

707
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:44,331
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust...

708
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,208
I mean, come on.

709
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,293
You got me.

710
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,627
If you really want to know

711
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:52,506
how a bank in Paris was robbed
from a stage in Las Vegas,

712
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,550
my special comes out next month.

713
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,759
Or I could just bring you in

714
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,304
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me.

715
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,930
Unless, of course,
what you're trying to say to me is that

716
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:03,100
you actually don't know how they did it.

717
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,229
Showmanship and theatrics.

718
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,565
When a magician waves his hand and says,

719
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,483
"This is where the magic is happening."

720
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,944
The real trick is happening somewhere else.

721
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,406
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

722
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,908
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

723
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,577
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

724
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,455
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

725
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:25,956
But don't take my word for it.

726
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,125
How about a trip to Paris?

727
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:31,629
Hermia, the teleportation helmet,
please, darling?

728
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,589
You're joking, right?

729
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,591
You wanna know how they did it or not?

730
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,761
I'm just gonna put this on your head.

731
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,472
THADDEUS: Step right up.

732
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,058
There you go.

733
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,729
Now we just pull this down all safe and snug.

734
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,441
Make yourself comfortable. There we go.

735
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:57,154
And when you're ready to go to Paris,
just say the magic word.

736
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,322
Blow me?

737
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,325
<i>- That'll suffice.</i>
- Bon voyage.

738
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:05,829
(SCREAMING)

739
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,587
THADDEUS: Bonjour.

740
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,799
I personally prefer to take the stairs to Paris.

741
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,218
Welcome to the City of Light, Agent Rhodes.

742
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,053
Hardy har har. What was with the helmet?

743
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,805
My fun.

744
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,182
- (LAUGHS)
- What?

745
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:26,725
- Nothing.
- Oh!

746
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,396
- So they got a vault set.
- Yes.

747
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,315
And it's the exact replica
of the little French guy's bank.

748
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,943
- So he's a plant.
- He was a dupe, not a plant.

749
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,404
They chose him.
They knew which seat he was in.

750
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,447
No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

751
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:44,410
Unless, of course,
the audience didn't pick the seat.

752
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:46,537
They let them think they picked the seat.

753
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,247
We'll choose one at random then.

754
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,374
<i>THADDEUS: Actually, they were</i>
just palming the ball

755
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,167
<i>with the seat number they wanted.</i>

756
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,712
DANIEL: We are looking at row number 5.

757
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,130
Henley, could I please have a seat number?

758
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:57,464
Lucky number 13.

759
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,591
Could you just confirm that
this is, in fact, your seat?

760
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:00,968
THADDEUS: He was selected.

761
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,928
<i>They programmed his mind</i>

762
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,139
<i>- to make him go to Las Vegas.</i>
- MERRITT: Viva Las Vegas.

763
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:09,476
<i>THADDEUS: And then</i>
they kept reinforcing it, until he did.

764
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:11,895
<i>They trailed him.</i>

765
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,105
<i>They studied him.</i>

766
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,940
<i>- Nothing was left to chance.</i>
- Oh!

767
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,025
(SPEAKS FRENCH)

768
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,277
I got his measurements.

769
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,696
<i>THADDEUS: He had no idea</i>
he was their target.

770
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,823
<i>And they simply activated him in Vegas.</i>

771
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,366
When I snap my fingers...

772
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,910
And once again, Merritt McKinney.

773
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,203
<i>DYLAN: But how did they know</i>
what bank was his?

774
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:29,788
- You're kidding.
- Really?

775
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,458
Can you be any more
of a condescending ass?

776
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,001
- Yes.
- (LAUGHS)

777
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,294
Like this.

778
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:39,757
There's a very rare, very mysterious way

779
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:43,343
in which a magician divines
an audience member's bank.

780
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:45,471
You ready?

781
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:46,764
Yes.

782
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,057
Credit card.

783
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,227
And that's how they got
the signature for the card

784
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,396
they left in the vault in Paris.

785
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,481
Very good.

786
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,065
You're being one-upped, Agent Rhodes.

787
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:00,235
Okay, but they had to get
the signature card in the vault.

788
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,112
You said they didn't steal the money.

789
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:05,240
No, I didn't say they didn't steal the money.
I said they didn't rob the bank.

790
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,120
<i>My guess is that they targeted</i>
a shipment of freshly minted money

791

on-board an armored truck.

<i>the men who drive these trucks</i>
are not exactly mental giants.

796
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,827
<i>For our Horsemen...</i>

797
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,162
<i>- Oh!</i>
...it was almost too easy.

798
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,628
HENLEY: Hey, boys.

799
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,054
So, how did they make the fake money
disappear from the vault? What is that?

800
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,431
THADDEUS: Flash paper.

801
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,894
<i>Magicians use it all the time.</i>

802
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,902
<i>Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.</i>

803
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,574
<i>Oh, merde.</i>

804
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,660
<i>CONAN O'BRIEN: Two days ago,</i>
no one heard of these guys,

805
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,246
<i>but tonight's show sold out in 35 seconds.</i>

806
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,832
I think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business.

807
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,751
Give your audience $3 million.

808
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,253
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

809
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,546
Best finale ever.

810
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,089
<i>They're gonna be</i>
the first magicians in history

811
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,173
<i>to get laid.</i>

812
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,593
<i>Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,</i>

813
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,761
<i>- put it on the lawyer first. Remember.</i>
- Oh, yes.

814
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,264
<i>I always do. It's lawyer first,</i>

815
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,266
<i>- then myself and then the children.</i>
- Then yourself.

816
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,767
Yes. Then the children.

817
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,354
Um... Allow me to make plain
what we've both been thinking.

818
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:00,606
And what's that?

819
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,775
Well, obviously, you have feelings
of affection for Daniel.

820
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:08,906
Unrequited and misguided,
owing to his lack of emotional availability.

821
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,700
Consequently, you're very tightly...

822
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,452
How should I put it? Um...

823
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:14,912
Corked.

824
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,038
Oh, I am?

825
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,708
Now, recognizing that
you have physical needs not being met,

826
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,294
and strictly in the vein of helping a sister out,

827
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:27,215
I invite you to think of me
as your own personal corkscrew.

828
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:28,550
Wow. Thanks.

829
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,303
Let me mull over
that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

830
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,555
Cheap and meaningless, maybe, but, uh,

831
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,307
not time-consuming.

832
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:36,892
(LAUGHING)

833
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,063
<i>MAN: (OVER PA) We should be getting there</i>
a few minutes early.

834
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,230
<i>So, sit back, relax.</i>

835
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:45,734
<i>We should be in the Big Easy soon.</i>
Appreciate you flying with us today.

836
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,278
So, what's in it for Tressler,
besides the money?

837
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,488
Ego.

838
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,574
Okay, pick your card.

839
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,953
Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.

840
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,788
No, don't tell me.

841
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,623
- Okay.
- Okay.

842
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,166
Thaddeus was there that night.

843
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,669
He knows exactly how they pulled it off.
What about him?

844
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,878
What are you saying?

845
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,130
You think they could be working together.

846
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,757
I don't know. All I know is that these guys

847
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,718
were a bunch of street magicians
a year ago with no resources.

848
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:15,973
So, how do they go from doing that to this
without some kind of outside help?

849
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,224
Is this your card?

850
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,851
No, my card is sitting
over there in that guy's lap.

851
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,395
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

852
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:22,521
Nice shuffle.

853
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,607
You know, this is hard.
According to this book,

854
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:29,695
some of those guys practice one simple
move eight hours a day for years.

855
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,823
Really? Some of those guys
seriously need to get a life.

856
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,158
Is it magicians, in general,
you have a problem with?

857
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,536
Or specifically those guys?

858
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,831
I could care less about magicians in general.

859
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,834
What I hate is people
who exploit other people.

860
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,002
Exploit them how?

861
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,420
- Try again.
- Um...

862
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,548
By taking advantage of their weaknesses.

863
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,384
Their need to believe in something
that's unexplainable

864
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,345
in order to make their lives more bearable.

865
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,222
I see it as a strength.

866
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,182
My life is happier when I believe that.

867
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,643
Is this your card?

868
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,603
Yeah.

869
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:05,856
Yeah?

870
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,357
- Yeah.
- Cool.

871
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:13,113
(LAUGHS) That smile on your face. Is it real?

872
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,448
Maybe.

873
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,492
So let me ask you, Mr. Detective Man.

874
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:18,994
Do you feel exploited?

875
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:22,289
Or did you have maybe a tiny, tiny bit of fun?

876
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:25,834
MERRITT: Guy goes to the doctor.

877
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,128
Doctor says, "Sir, you're gonna
have to stop masturbating."

878
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,212
He says, "Why?"

879
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,630
He says, "So I can finish the examination."

880
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,840
Oh, Danny, can I talk to you about

881
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,508
- my role in the show real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

882
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,218
- Hey, guys.
- (LAUGHING)

883
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,720
We got a show to prepare for.

884
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,014
- Oh.
- Oh! Do we now?

885
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,307
No, no, no, don't do that.

886
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,558
You're not doing that thing to me. No.

887
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,976
What thing? I'm just looking at you.

888
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,644
No, you're not.
I've been watching you for a year.

889
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:45,937
I know all of your little tricks.

890
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,355
That what they are to you? Tricks?

891
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,149
Yes, it's gimmicks. It's Barnum statements.

892
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,942
It's reading the eyes. Body language. I get it.

893
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,694
If it's such an easy thing,
why don't you do Henley?

894
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,529
Yeah, Danny. Why don't you do me?

895
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,740
No, you're too easy. I'll do Jasmine.

896
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,325
TRESSLER: No.

897
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,078
- Do me.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. Do Art.

898
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,329
DANIEL: Okay.

899
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,455
MERRITT: Even better.

900
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,539
- DANIEL: Art.
- Yeah.

901
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,375
But I warn you, I can be difficult to read,
when I want to be.

902
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,503
Just stay with me, okay?

903
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,214
So, Art, you were a tough kid.

904
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,299
You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

905
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:18,303
You had a dog. A real tough dog.
A brutish breed. Like a real...

906
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,472
I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

907
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,225
Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

908
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,394
I had a fluffy white cat called Snuffles.

909
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:27,854
<i>- (LAUGHING)</i>
- Wow.

910
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,189
Ah. Sorry.

911
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,398
Wait, let me try one.

912
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:31,608
- I can do way better than that.
- Let him do it.

913
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,776
Come on, give me one more time.
One more time.

914
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,444
He can do way better than that.

915
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:35,529
Let's do family.

916
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:38,824
You had an uncle on your mother's side.

917
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,576
He had a real, kind of...
A real masculine name.

918
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:45,455
A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...
You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

919
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,709
Like it was some kind of Paul.
Thompson? Was it a Paul...

920
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,545
(SIGHING) Okay.
You know what? I got nothin'.

921
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:52,712
- Nearly though.
- Was I?

922
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:56,716
Yeah. My uncle's name
was Cushman Armitage. (LAUGHS)

923
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,511
Really? Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?
That was your childhood?

924
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,972
I certainly hope tonight's show
is gonna be better than this.

925
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,558
DANIEL: Don't worry. Just you wait.

926
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:13,233
Hey. Come on, give me some good news
on a hotel room, please.

927
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,484
FULLER: What, are you kidding me?

928
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,194
No, it's Mardi Gras, Dylan.

929
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,071
There's nothing within sight of the theater.

930
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,407
Hold on a second. Hold on.
Where is this woman?

931
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,578
Hey, hey! There you are.

932
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,289
What, the French girl doing a little
sightseeing while she's in New Orleans?

933
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,583
No. In fact, here, speaking French

934
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,376
- is actually an asset.
- Huh?

935
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,003
Do you see that woman up there?

936
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,005
That's Marie Claire.

937
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,465
And she has a lovely apartment for us.

938
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,802
You're welcome.

939
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,512
Yeah.

940
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,181
We got a place.

941
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,561
I want two each inside of here.
The other 30 around here.

942
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,062
Roofs, alleys, balconies.

943
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:54,232
- Eyes on The Horsemen at all times.
- Yes, sir.

944
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:58,153
Wow, 100 years ago, William Robinson
took the name Chung Ling Soo

945
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:02,115
and spent his entire life
never speaking English in public.

946
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,533
(SPEAKS FRENCH)

947
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,744
This other guy, Maximillian...

948
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,955
I am not interested
in a history lesson on magic at this moment.

949
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,750
If you want to keep playing
into their hands, go for it.

950

Lionel Shrike.

955
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:27,724
In Central Park,
he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

956
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:30,936
Then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years.

They saw the tree in half.

Inside the tree, encased in glass,

959

is the card with the signature.

he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

1087
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,707
He had a guy who worked at the carousel

sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,878
And?

1090
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:58,049

I mean, that isn't magic. It's not magic.

1096
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,525
The point is, the trick was not to look closely.

It was to look so far
that you see 20 years into the past.

Thank you. Before we begin,

1108
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:47,849
we'd like to single out
two people in particular.

1109
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,393
A man and a woman to whom
we'd like to dedicate tonight's performance.

1110
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,186
FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes

1111
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:57,984
and the lovely, if somewhat inexperienced,
Interpol Agent Alma Dray, everyone.

(CROWD BOOING)

1113
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:03,197
Yeah, Agent Rhodes
has personally vowed to "nail us."

1114
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:07,785
And we encourage him to do so
if he has the brains and the fur.

1115
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,749
What is magic?

Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

1117
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,964
So I want you to look.

1118
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,341
Look as closely as possible.

1119
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:26,721
Because the tricks you are about to see
may not seem connected.

1120
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,723
But we assure you, they are.

1121
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,477
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

1122
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:36,481
Or is it one giant illusion?

of the oldest tricks in the book.

1125
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,368
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

1126
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,579
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

1127
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:55,917
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

1128
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,252
I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

1129
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:01,130
and put her inside this mystery box.

1130
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,634
There are two pencils out there.
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

1131
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,093
- Here!
- WOMAN: Yeah!

1132
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,596
And now, you will say the magic word.

1133
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:09,931
Abracadabra.

1134
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:13,059
Yes, and I will wave this magic wand
for no reason. And then...

1135
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,603
Fluffy has magically vanished
before your very eyes.

1136
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,608
If you haven't experienced mass hypnosis,
you're about to.

1137
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:21,859
And sleep.

Down, down. Sleep, sleep. Completely sleep.

Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

1140
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:30,743
And now we are gonna debunk
a few magic myths this evening.

1141
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,871
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

1142
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,832
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

1143
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,417
As has the mirror

1144
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:40,962
which makes the box only
appear as though it's empty.

1145
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,214

of pulling the rabbit out of the hat.

1154
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:04,110
But has anyone heard
of pulling a hat out of a rabbit?

1155

about resolution and logic.
