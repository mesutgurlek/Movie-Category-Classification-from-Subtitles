I'm no longer in command,

You are going to reassume command until my people arrive to finish the job,

When this white phone rings, it'll be me with further instructions,

514

If you deviate from the plan one little bit,

515
00:46:06,237 --> 00:46:08,364
I will kill your wife,

516

And then I will kill your child,

517
00:46:13,444 --> 00:46:17,574

You shot out the cameras?

Dennis says he doesn't trust me anymore,

You're gonna want to run that through your database,

Your next question is: How did I get that information?

616

The little boy in the house called me on his sister's cell phone,

Smith's not talking,

625

Is Smith not talking because you won't let him?

626

It's not a wise move,
We don't have enough information,

Look, I want to help,

01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:54,292
Four-man team ropes in, Silent entry through one of the skylights here,

869
01:11:54,361 --> 01:11:55,851
All right,

870
01:11:55,929 --> 01:11:59,865
I put the doer and the two boys here in the courtyard, I keep the two kids in the house,

871
01:11:59,933 --> 01:12:03,892
- How much time you need for the play?
- Two minutes,

872
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:06,165
Say you can get the hostages to the pool area,

873
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,606
How are you gonna get all three suspects to this side of the house?

874
01:12:09,676 --> 01:12:13,544
Well, we're about to jump off that bridge,
aren't we?

875
01:12:13,613 --> 01:12:15,604

879
01:12:58,825 --> 01:13:00,622
Dennis?

880
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:03,118
Dennis?

881
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,398
What do you want?

882
01:13:08,001 --> 01:13:09,992
You by yourself?

883
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:14,463
Yeah,

884
01:13:14,541 --> 01:13:16,771
We got a problem, Dennis,

885
01:13:16,843 --> 01:13:18,743
Oh, yeah?

886
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:20,803
Yeah,

887
01:13:22,182 --> 01:13:24,173
Walter Smith just died,

888
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:31,719
Hear what I said?

889
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:34,021
Yeah,

890
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:40,266
I know Mars killed my cop, but Smith's death is on you, man,

891
01:13:42,068 --> 01:13:46,198
Things just got a lot more complicated, didn't they, Dennis?

892
01:13:46,272 --> 01:13:50,231
Not to mention the fact that helicopters are very expensive,

893
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:53,746
Gotta pay for the fuel, the pilot...

894
01:13:54,748 --> 01:13:57,342
chief of police,

895
01:13:57,417 --> 01:14:00,750
You know what cops do when they retire, Dennis?

896
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:03,084
They play golf,

897
01:14:03,156 --> 01:14:06,990
I don't want to play golf, I hate fucking golf,

898
01:14:08,561 --> 01:14:10,756
I want a house on the golf course,

899
01:14:11,765 --> 01:14:13,596
I want that,

900
01:14:15,402 --> 01:14:18,769
Walter Smith talked to me before he died,

901
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,105
I know about the money,

902
01:14:22,175 --> 01:14:25,975
I don't know shit about money, man, I don't know shit about what you're talking about,

903
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:28,036
I'm talking about a transaction,

904
01:14:28,114 --> 01:14:32,551
You want a helicopter, I want a house on the golf course,

905
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:39,418
Fifty thousand,

906
01:14:39,492 --> 01:14:41,619
Maybe you can negotiate with the sheriffs for that,

907
01:14:41,694 --> 01:14:43,628
No, No!

908
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:45,687
No,

909
01:14:46,966 --> 01:14:48,957
Shit,

910
01:14:50,637 --> 01:14:53,162
Half,

911
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:55,230
I'll give you half, OK?

912
01:14:57,544 --> 01:15:01,810
That's, like... two million, OK?
Half is good,

913
01:15:01,881 --> 01:15:05,840
All right, Sell it to your crew,

914
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:08,353
Jennifer and Tommy stay in the house,

915
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:11,481
The three of you down here in the courtyard,

916
01:15:11,558 --> 01:15:14,083
I'll trade the helicopter for the cash,

917
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,754
How do I know the pilot's not gonna shoot me?

918
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:19,492
Let me worry about the pilot,

919
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:23,698
You just make sure he gets that bag, understand?

920
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:26,364
Yeah,

921
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:28,430
Half an hour,

922
01:15:55,568 --> 01:15:59,800

Always, OK?

931
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,672
What... What if they just want to get us outside just to shoot us?

932
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:45,547
They could have killed us, like, a million times, Kev,

933
01:16:45,618 --> 01:16:47,643
But they didn't, because Talley wants to get paid,

934
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:51,520
Yeah, Get paid and then shoot us,

935

937
01:17:00,266 --> 01:17:02,757
We're going on a helicopter ride,

No, No, I don't want to,

I'm not your girl,

I'm not going anywhere with you, I'm not leaving...

You're my girl,

942
01:17:28,728 --> 01:17:30,719
And my girl comes with me,

943
01:17:32,131 --> 01:17:37,262
Red team ropes in, Upon entry, our packages should be here,

944
01:17:37,337 --> 01:17:40,397
This indoor pool area, Any questions?

945
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:08,594
It's all there!

946
01:18:08,668 --> 01:18:11,193
- Two million,
- OK, Let's go,

947
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,170
Where's...

948
01:18:13,706 --> 01:18:17,836
What's this? This wasn't what we discussed,

949
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:20,003
This wasn't what we talked about,

950
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:23,913
Three people in the chopper,
That's all it can carry, Dennis,

951
01:18:23,983 --> 01:18:27,942
I thought you were the man in charge,
Isn't that what you told me?

952
01:18:28,021 --> 01:18:31,184
- You said, "I'm the man,"
- I am the man! I am in charge!

953
01:18:31,257 --> 01:18:33,487
- Prove it,
- Mars, leave her!

954
01:18:33,559 --> 01:18:36,153
Jenny and I aren't going nowhere,

955
01:18:36,229 --> 01:18:39,960
Dennis, The man that owns this house is a criminal,

956
01:18:40,033 --> 01:18:42,934
So are his friends,
This money belongs to them,

957
01:18:43,002 --> 01:18:45,630
- You want more money?
- They'll come after you and fuckin' kill you,

958
01:18:45,705 --> 01:18:46,831
You want more fucking money?

959
01:18:46,906 --> 01:18:48,931
You just chose the wrong house on the wrong day,

960
01:18:49,008 --> 01:18:50,339
- I'm not lying,
- Bullshit,

961
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:54,210
The only thing I lied to you about was Smith,

962
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,771
He's not dead, You didn't kill anybody,

963
01:18:56,849 --> 01:18:59,215
That means that you and your brother can still beat the hard shit,

964
01:18:59,285 --> 01:19:02,777
Just walk out of here with me,
Put those guns down and walk out now,

- Dennis, it's fucked,

They're gonna shoot us as soon as we get through the gate,

1000
01:21:45,418 --> 01:21:48,285
The situation has clearly gotten away from you,

1001
01:21:48,354 --> 01:21:50,219
Your flagrant disregard for protocol

1002

has unnecessarily placed yourself and my officers in the line of fire,

1003

My opinion? You remain in command, there's a probability of a negative outcome,

Chief, the US government would like to thank you for your service and cooperation,

Chief, move, now,

01:43:09,634 --> 01:43:12,296
I'm just trying to bring us all home,

1166
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:17,637
Cut Walter loose, Send him over next to me, and we will disappear into the day,

1167
01:43:17,709 --> 01:43:20,200
Let them go, I'll stay here, Just let them go,

1168
01:43:20,278 --> 01:43:24,078
You get this one thing: I don't bargain,

1169
01:43:24,149 --> 01:43:27,118
I give, You take, That's it,

1170
01:43:27,185 --> 01:43:29,380
Cut him loose,

1171
01:43:37,929 --> 01:43:39,226
Good,

1172
01:43:41,733 --> 01:43:44,327
Hands, Hands up, in the air,

1173
01:43:44,402 --> 01:43:48,634
Oh, you're a fucking dead man, You're a fucking dead man!

1174
01:43:48,706 --> 01:43:51,402
Thank you very fucking much, He hasn't seen your face?

1175
01:43:51,476 --> 01:43:54,001
<i>- He's seen my face!
- My family hasn't seen his face,</i>

1176
01:43:54,078 --> 01:43:56,069
- What are you waiting for? Kill him!
- They didn't see his face,

1177
01:43:56,147 --> 01:43:57,205
Come on,

1178
01:43:57,282 --> 01:43:59,773
My family hasn't seen Walter Smith's face!
Just let 'em go!

1179
01:43:59,851 --> 01:44:03,184
- Come on, what are you waiting for?
- Just let 'em leave! Just let 'em go now!

1180
01:44:03,254 --> 01:44:07,315
Goddammit, kill him!

1181
01:44:58,643 --> 01:45:00,736
