And I don't need good luck. Thank you.

160
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,627
Oh, yes, you do.
You just think you don't.

161
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,430
Say, you're blocking our doorway.
You think you might wanna move your cab?

WIZARD:
You know, eye shadow, mascara,

165
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,785
lipstick, rouge.

166
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,872
DOUGHBOY:
Not rouge. Blush-on, they call it.

167
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,460
WIZARD: The kind with the brush.
DOUGHBOY: Yeah, it's Blush-on.

WIZARD:
Travis.

169
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:27,342
Hey, Wiz.
That's Blush-on. My wife uses it.

170
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,636
Ask Travis.
He's a ladies' man.

171
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,263
A cup of coffee, please.

172
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,266
Anyway, whatever the fuck it is,
she uses a lot of it, you know?

173
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,894
And then perfume.
The spray kind.

174
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,605
And then, get this.
In the middle of the Triborough Bridge...

No.
Oh, yeah.

177
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,821
What'd you do?
I throw the meter, you know,

178
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:53,409
and I jump in the back seat and I whip it out.
I said, "You know what this is?"

179
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,412
She says, "It's love." You know,
I'm gonna fuck her brains out.

180
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,247
She goes wild, you know,
and she said,

"That's the greatest
single experience of my life."

182
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,921

What's that?

189
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:32,198
Well, I turn on the radio.
Some fleet driver from Bell just got all cut up.

Stickup?

191
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,412
No, he got cut up by some crazy fucker.
Cut half his ear off.

Where?
It was at 122nd Street.

00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,332
these three fingers
missing on this hand

00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,793
and that hand missing
on that hand,

227
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,672
how would you light the match?
I wouldn't light a match.

00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,049
Go ahead.
Give it a try.

229

Well, the guy at the
newsstand can do it.

00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,544
Well, I don't work
at a newsstand.

239
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,797
Anyway, he's probably Italian.
No.

240
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,591
You're sure he's not Italian?
He's black.

241
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,136
Well, if he had been Italian, he might've been a thief.
They do that, the mob does that.

242
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,973
If a thief screws up on the job,
you know, they'll blow his fingers off.

I'll tell you something else.
This sounds like a joke, but it's true.

244
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,104
If they kill a stool pigeon,
they leave a canary on the body.

245
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,608
Apparently it's symbolic.
Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?

246
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,527
I don't know why not
a pigeon. Wait a minute.

247
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,615
You gotta catch a pigeon. A canary, you can walk
right into a pet store, as long as you pay for it,

248
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,618
boom, kill it right there.
Put it on anyone you want. Doesn't matter.

249
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,940
Hi. I'd like to volunteer.
Great. I'll take you right over here.

250
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,817
That's all right. I'd rather
volunteer to her, if you don't mind.

251
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,907
Why do you feel that you
have to volunteer to me?

252
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:47,245
Because I think that you are the most
beautiful woman I have ever seen.

253
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,040

254
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,501
But what do you think
of Palantine?

255
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,714
Well, l...

256
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,176
Charles Palantine, the man you're
volunteering to help elect president.

257
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,596
Well, I'm sure he'll make
a good president.

258
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,183
I don't know exactly what his policies
are, but I'm sure he'll make a good one.

senator's stand on welfare?

261

welfare, but I'm sure it's a good stand.

You're sure of that?
Yeah.

Well, we all work together
here full-time, day and night,

264
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,914
so if you would just like to step over there,
I'm sure the gentlemen will sign you up.

265
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:36,669
The thing is, I drive a taxi at night,
so it's kind of hard for me

266
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,214
to work in the day.
So, uh...

267
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,300
Then what exactly do you want?

268
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,261
Would you like to come have
some coffee and pie with me?

269
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,721
Why?

270

Why? I'll tell you why.
Yeah.

271
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,435
I think you're a lonely person.

272
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,271
I drive by this place a lot,
and I see you here.

273
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,481
I see a lot of people
around you

274
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,776
and I see these phones
and all this stuff on your desk

275
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,320
that means nothing.

276
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,655
And when I came inside
and I met you,

277
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,616
I saw in your eyes, and I saw
the way you carried yourself,

278
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,036
that you're not a happy person.

279
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,413
And I think you need something.

280
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,499
And if you wanna call it a friend,
you can call it a friend.

281
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,795
You're gonna be my friend?
Yeah.

282
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,180
What do you say?

283
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:37,021
It's a little hard standing here
and asking you, so...

284
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,987
Five minutes, that's all.
Just outside. Right around here.

285
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,906
I'm there to protect you.

Just take a little break.

288
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,503
I have a break at 4:00.
And if you're here...

289
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,755
4:00 today?
Yes.

290
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,883
I'll be here.
I'm sure you will.

291
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,011
All right, 4 p.m.
Right.

292
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,055
Outside in the front?
Yes.

00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,473
Okay.

Oh, my name is Travis.
Betsy?

296

BICKLE:
May 26th, 4:00 p.m.

299
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,752
I took Betsy to Charles' Coffee Shop
on Columbus Circle.

300
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:47,383
I had black coffee and apple pie
with a slice of melted yellow cheese.

301
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,844
I think that was a good selection.

302
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,388
Betsy had coffee
and a fruit salad dish.

303
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,515
She could've had
anything she wanted.

Fifteen thousand volunteers
in New York alone's not bad.

But, Christ,
the organizational problems.

306
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,105
Mm-hm.

307
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,608
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I got the same problems.

308
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,905
I gotta get organized. You know, little
things, like my apartment, my possessions.

309
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,535
I should get one of those signs that says, "One
of these days, I'm gonna get organiz-ized."

relating that there was no connection whatsoever.

there was something between us.

There was an impulse
that we were both following.

to come in and talk to you.

nothing and I could sense it.

I was right. Did you feel that way?

MAN:
Dear Mr. Bickle:

1282
01:46:09,821 --> 01:46:13,783
I can't say how happy
Mrs. Steensma and I were

1283
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:16,952
to hear that you are
well and recuperating.

1284
01:46:17,162 --> 01:46:20,039
We tried to visit you at the hospital

1285
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:22,958
when we were in New York
to pick up Iris,

1286
01:46:23,251 --> 01:46:25,795
but you were still in a coma.

1287
01:46:26,088 --> 01:46:28,130
There is no way we can repay you

1288
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:31,467
for returning our Iris to us.

1289
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,427
We thought we had lost her,

1290
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:36,806
and now our lives are full again.

1291
01:46:37,307 --> 01:46:38,641
Needless to say,

1292
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:43,354
you are something of a hero
around this household.

1293
01:46:44,106 --> 01:46:47,608
I'm sure you want
to know about Iris.

1294
01:46:47,818 --> 01:46:51,320
She's back in school
and working hard.

1295
01:46:51,613 --> 01:46:54,657
The transition has been
very hard for her,

1296
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:56,158
as you can well imagine.

1297
01:46:57,661 --> 01:46:59,203
But we have taken steps to see

1298
01:46:59,454 --> 01:47:03,624
she has never cause
to run away again.

ln conclusion,

1300
01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:09,588
Mrs. Steensma and I
would like to again thank you

1301
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:12,508
from the bottom of our hearts.

1302
01:47:12,717 --> 01:47:16,804
Unfortunately, we cannot afford
to come to New York again

1303
01:47:17,013 --> 01:47:20,975
to thank you in person,
or we surely would.

1304
01:47:21,184 --> 01:47:24,019
But if you should ever
come to Pittsburgh,

1305
01:47:24,312 --> 01:47:28,858
you would find yourself
a most welcome guest in our home.

1306
01:47:29,151 --> 01:47:34,029
Our deepest thanks,
Burt and Ivy Steensma.

up, he says, "Hey, I wanna swap tires."

I say, "These are new tires.

1309

Why don't you throw in
something else, like your wife?"
