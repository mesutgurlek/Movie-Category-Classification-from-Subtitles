OUT OF PRISON.

165
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
REALLY?

166
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,000
WELL, WHY WERE
YOU IN PRISON?

167
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,300
I STOLE THINGS.

168
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,800
YOU STOLE THINGS?
LIKE, UH, JEWELS?

INCAN MATRIMONIAL
HEAD MASKS.

170

INCAN MATRIMONIAL--

THERE'S SOME.

DON'T LET HIM FOOL YOU.
THERE'S BOATLOADS,

00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,700
IF YOU CAN MOVE 'EM.

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
BUT YOU CAN'T.

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
MY FENCE SEEMED
CONFIDENT ENOUGH.

177
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,400
IF YOU'RE DEALING IN CASH,
YOU DON'T NEED A FENCE.

178
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,800
SOME PEOPLE LACK VISION.

179
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,700
PROBABLY EVERYBODY
IN CELL BLOCK E.

180
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
THAT'S $500.

LESSON IN POKER?

NEVER BET ON THE--
NO.

183

LEAVE EMOTION
AT THE DOOR.

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,300
THAT'S RIGHT, TOPHER.

185
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,800
TODAY'S LESSON--
HOW TO DRAW OUT THE BLUFF.

NOTHING BETTER THAN
A PAIR OF FACE CARDS.

JOSH?
NO. I'M GAME.

00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,900
I WILL SEE YOUR 500,

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,800
AND I WILL RAISE YOU
ANOTHER 500 OF MY OWN.

HANDSOME BET, JOSH,

WE DON'T WANT TO PUSH HIM
TOO HIGH TOO FAST.

TO DO WHAT YOU LIKE.

00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,200
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY,
BUT I'M STAYING IN.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,500
HE'S TRYING TO BUY
HIS WAY OUT OF HIS BLUFF.

LET'S SEE 'EM.

I'M NOT SURE
WHAT THE FOUR 9s DOES,

217
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
BUT THE ACE, I THINK,
IS PRETTY HIGH.

218
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,400
DUDE! THANKS FOR THE TIP
ON CALLING OUT THE BLUFF.

YOU LOOK BORED.

I AM BORED.

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
SO, HOW WAS THE CLINK?
DID YOU GET THE COOKIES I SENT?

224
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,800
WHY DO YOU THINK
I CAME TO SEE YOU FIRST?

225
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
SO, TELL ME.

226
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,100
IT'S TRICKY. IT'S
NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.

227
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
IT'S GONNA NEED PLANNING
AND A LARGE CREW.

GUNS?

229
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
NOT EXACTLY.
A LOT OF SECURITY,

230
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
BUT THE TAKE--

231
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
WHAT'S THE TARGET?

232
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
8 FIGURES EACH.

233
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
WHAT'S THE TARGET?

234
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,900
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE IN VEGAS?

235

WHAT? YOU WANT TO
KNOCK OVER A CASINO?

236
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
OH! HO HO.

237
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,800

AT THE BELLAGIO.

Rusty: MMM.

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
OOF!

IF I'M READING
THIS RIGHT,

AND I'D LIKE TO
THINK THAT I AM,

243
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,300
THIS IS PROBABLY

244
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
THE LEAST ACCESSIBLE
VAULT EVER DESIGNED.

245
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
YEP.

246
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
YOU SAID 3 CASINOS?

247
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,000
THESE FEED INTO THE CAGES
AT THE MIRAGE,

248
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,900
THE MGM GRAND, BUT
EVERY DIME ENDS UP THERE.

249
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,700
THE BELLAGIO
AND THE MIRAGE.

250
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
THESE ARE TERRY
BENEDICT'S PLACES.

YES, THEY ARE.

00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,400
DO YOU THINK
HE'LL MIND?

253
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,300
MORE THAN SOMEWHAT. YOU'D
NEED AT LEAST A DOZEN GUYS

254
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,700
DOING A COMBINATION OF CONS.

255
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

256
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD,
I'D SAY YOU'RE LOOKING

00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,900
AT A BOESKY, A JIM BROWN,
A MISS DAISY,

258
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
2 JETHROS,
AND A LEON SPINKS,

259
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,700
NOT TO MENTION THE BIGGEST
ELLA FITZGERALD EVER.

260
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,000
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN GET
THE MONEY TO BACK THIS?

261
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,400
IF WE'RE HITTING
THESE 3 CASINOS,

262
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
WE'LL GET
OUR BANKROLL.

263
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,300
BENEDICT'S GOT
A LONG LIST OF ENEMIES.

264
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,600
YEAH, BUT ENEMIES WITH
LOOSE CASH, NOTHING TO LOSE?

AH! REUBEN.

WHA--
I NEED THE REASON.

DON'T SAY MONEY.
WHY DO THIS?

278
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,600
WHY NOT DO IT?

279
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
BECAUSE YESTERDAY,

280
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
I WALKED
OUT OF THE JOINT

281
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,800
AFTER LOSING
4 YEARS OF MY LIFE,

282
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,700
AND YOU'RE COLD-DECKING
TEEN BEATCOVER BOYS.

283
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,000
BECAUSE THE HOUSE
ALWAYS WINS.

284
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,400
PLAY LONG ENOUGH,

285
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
YOU NEVER
CHANGE THE STAKES,

286
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
THE HOUSE TAKES YOU
UNLESS...

287
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,700
WHEN THAT PERFECT
HAND COMES ALONG,

288
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
YOU BET BIG,

289
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
AND THEN
YOU TAKE THE HOUSE.

290
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
YOU'VE BEEN PRACTICING
THIS SPEECH, HAVEN'T YOU?

291
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,800
A LITTLE BIT. DID I RUSH?
IT FELT LIKE I RUSHED IT.

292
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,800
NO. IT WAS GOOD. I LIKED IT.
TEEN BEATTHING WAS HARSH.

293
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,500
I WONDER WHAT

YOU'RE OUT OF
YOUR GODDAMN MINDS!

ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?
YOU'RE, BOTH OF YOU, NUTS.

296
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,600
I KNOW MORE
ABOUT CASINO SECURITY

297
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,500
THAN ANY MAN ALIVE.
I INVENTED IT,

298
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
AND IT CANNOT BE BEATEN.

299
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,300
THEY GOT CAMERAS, THEY GOT
WATCHERS, THEY GOT LOCKS,

300
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
THEY GOT TIMERS,
THEY GOT VAULTS.

301
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,100
THEY GOT ENOUGH ARMED
PERSONNEL TO OCCUPY PARIS.

302
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,400
OK, BAD EXAMPLE.

303
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,300
IT'S NEVER BEEN TRIED.

304
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
HO HO!
IT'S NEVER BEEN TRIED.

305
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
IT'S BEEN TRIED.
A FEW GUYS EVEN CAME CLOSE.

3 MOST SUCCESSFUL ROBBERIES

311

HE GOT 2 STEPS
CLOSER TO THE DOOR

312
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,000
THAN ANY LIVING SOUL
BEFORE HIM.

TASTED FRESH OXYGEN

317

BEFORE THEY GRABBED HIM.

00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
UHH!

319
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,000

BREATHING OUT OF A HOSE

00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,700
CHECKED IN 2 NIGHTS AGO.
HE'S IN THE MIRADOR SUITE.

956
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,100
HOW'S HE DOING?

957
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,500
UP. ALMOST 200.

958
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,400
GOOD FOR HIM.

959
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,800
YOU'RE 30 SECONDS LATE.

960
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,300
I WAS ABOUT TO SEND OUT
A SEARCH--

961
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,600
HELLO, TESS.

962
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,400
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

963
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,400
I'M OUT.

964
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,300
YOU'RE OUT.
OF PRISON.

965
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,300
YOU REMEMBER THE DAY
THAT I WENT FOR CIGARETTES

966
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,200
AND I DIDN'T COME BACK?
YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED.

967
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,600
I DON'T SMOKE.
DON'T SIT.

968
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,500
AHH. NOW, THEY TELL ME
THAT I PAID MY DEBT TO SOCIETY.

969
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,900
FUNNY,
I NEVER GOT A CHECK.

970
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,800
YOU'RE NOT WEARING
YOUR RING.

971
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,100
I SOLD IT. I DON'T
HAVE A HUSBAND,

972
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,500
OR DIDN'T YOU
GET THE PAPERS?

973
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
MY LAST DAY INSIDE.

974
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,900
I TOLD YOU I'D WRITE.

975
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,700
DANNY...GO NOW, BEFORE--

976
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,100
WHAT? BENEDICT?

977
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
HOW YOU DOING?

978
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,900
WHISKEY,
AND A WHISKEY.

979
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,300
DANNY--

980
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,300
TESS, YOU'RE
DOING A GREAT JOB

981
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,700
CURATING THE MUSEUM.

982
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,600
THE VERMEER IS QUITE GOOD.
IT'S SIMPLE, VIBRANT,

983
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,000
ALTHOUGH HIS WORK DEFINITELY
FELL OFF AS HE GOT OLDER.

984
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,400
REMIND YOU
OF ANYONE?

985
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,400
AND I ALWAYS CONFUSE
MONET AND MANET.

986
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,300
NOW, WHICH ONE
MARRIED HIS MISTRESS?

987
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,700
MONET.

988
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,600
RIGHT. AND THEN
MANET HAD SYPHILIS.

989
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
THEY ALSO PAINTED
OCCASIONALLY.

990
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,300
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL MAKE THIS QUICK.

991
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,700
I CAME HERE FOR YOU.

992
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
I WANNA
GET ON WITH MY LIFE.

993
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,500
I WANT YOU WITH ME.

994
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,900
YOU'RE A THIEF
AND A LIAR.

995
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,800
I ONLY LIED
ABOUT BEING A THIEF.

996
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,700
I DON'T DO THAT
ANYMORE.

997
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,600
STEAL?
LIE.

998
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,100
I'M WITH SOMEONE NOW

999
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,500
WHO DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE
THAT KIND OF DISTINCTION.

1000
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,900
NO, HE'S
VERY CLEAR ON BOTH.

1001
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,300
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS?

1002
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,700
I ONLY HAVE ONE?

1003
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,700
YOU'VE MET TOO MANY
PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

1004
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,100
I'M WITH TERRY NOW.

1005
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,800
DOES HE MAKE YOU LAUGH?

1006
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,200
HE DOESN'T
MAKE ME CRY.

1007
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,200
Saul: MR. BENEDICT,

1008
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,600
THE FIGHT IS SATURDAY
NIGHT, IS IT NOT?

1009
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,000
YES. WOULD YOU
LIKE SOME TICKETS?

1010
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,900
NO. HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT
DOES NOT INTEREST ME.

1011
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,800
I HAVE A PACKAGE
ARRIVING HERE THAT EVENING,

1012
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,600
BLACK BRIEFCASE,
STANDARD SIZE,

1013
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,500
THE CONTENTS OF WHICH
IS VERY VALUABLE TO ME.

1014
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,800
I'LL PUT IT
IN THE HOUSE SAFE FOR YOU.

1015
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,700
THE HOUSE SAFE
IS FOR BRANDY

1016
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,100
AND GRANDMOTHERS'
PEARLS.

1017
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,500
I NEED SOMETHING
MORE SECURE.

1018
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,900
MR. ZERGA,
I CAN ASSURE YOU

1019
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,300
THAT OUR HOUSE SAFE--

1020
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,300
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU,
MR. BENEDICT,

1021
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,200
THAT YOUR GENEROSITY
IN THIS MANNER

1022
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,600
WILL NOT
GO OVERLOOKED.

1023
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,000
NOW...WHAT CAN YOU
OFFER ME

1024
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,300
BESIDES THE SAFE?

1025
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,200
SEE, THE PEOPLE
YOU STEAL THINGS FROM?

1026
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,100
THEY HAVE INSURANCE
TO COMPENSATE THEM.

1027
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
THEY GET
MADE WHOLE AGAIN.

1028
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,400
I HAD TO LEAVE NEW YORK
TO GET AWAY FROM WHAT HAPPENED.

1029
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,400
HOW AM I GONNA GET
MY 5 YEARS BACK, DANNY?

1030
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,800
YOU CAN'T.

1031
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,700
BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO IS
NOT THROW AWAY ANOTHER--

1032
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,200
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW ANY--

1033
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,100
TESS, ALL RIGHT.

1034
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,600
YOU DON'T LOVE ME
ANYMORE.

1035
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,000
YOU WANT TO MAKE A LIFE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE, FINE.

1036
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,400
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO LIVE WITH THAT.

1037
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,900
BUT NOT HIM.

1038
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,800
SPOKEN LIKE
A TRUE EX-HUSBAND.

1039
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,200
I'M NOT JOKING, TESS.

1040
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,200
I'M NOT LAUGHING, DANNY.

1041
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,100
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THERE IS
A BIT OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST

1042
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
WHEN YOU GIVE ME ADVICE
ABOUT MY LOVE LIFE.

1043
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,400
YES, BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN THAT I'M WRONG.

1044
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,200
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT I SAID
TO YOU WHEN WE FIRST MET?

1045
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,600
YOU SAID THAT I BETTER
KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

1046
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,500
DO YOU? YEAH?

1047
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,900
BECAUSE, TRULY, YOU SHOULD
WALK OUT THE DOOR IF YOU DON'T.

1048
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,800
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

1049
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,200
Benedict:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1050
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,100
JUST CATCHING UP.

1051
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
TERRY,
MEET MY EX-HUSBAND.

1052
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,900
DANNY OCEAN.

1053
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,400
MR. OCEAN.
I'M IN YOUR SEAT.

1054
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,800
FORGIVE ME
FOR BEING LATE.

1055
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,700
A GUEST REQUIRED
MY ATTENTION.

1056
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,600
THAT'S FINE.

1057
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,600
DANNY WAS WALKING
THROUGH THE RESTAURANT

1058
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
AND SPOTTED ME.

1059
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:56,900
IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH.

1060
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,400
IMAGINE
THE ODDS.

1061
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,800
"OF ALL THE GIN JOINTS
IN ALL THE WORLD."

1062
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,700
YOU RECENTLY WERE RELEASED
FROM PRISON, IS THAT CORRECT?

1063
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,100
Ocean: THAT'S RIGHT.

1064
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Benedict: HOW DOES IT
FEEL TO BE OUT?

1065
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Ocean: ABOUT THE SAME.

1066
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,900
DANNY WAS
JUST ABOUT TO--

1067
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,800
I JUST STOPPED BY
TO SAY HI TO TESS

1068
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,300
FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.

1069
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,200
STAY AND HAVE A DRINK.

1070
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,600
I CAN'T.
HE CAN'T.

1071
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,400
Benedict: WELL, THEN...

1072
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,300
I DON'T IMAGINE WE'LL BE SEEING
MR. OCEAN ANYTIME SOON, RIGHT?

1073
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,600
Ocean: YOU NEVER KNOW.

1074
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,100
AH, I KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENING IN MY HOTELS.

1075
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,900
Ocean: SO I SHOULD
PUT THOSE TOWELS BACK?

1076
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,800
NO, THE TOWELS YOU CAN KEEP.

1077
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,000
GOOD TO SEE YOU, TESS.

1078
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,400
TAKE CARE, DANNY.

1079
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,400
TERRY.

1080
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,300
DANNY.

1081
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
[INAUDIBLE SPEECH]

1082
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,000
OH.

1083
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,300
STINKIN'...

1084
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,200
TOMORROW, THE DAY IS YOURS.
DO WITH IT WHAT YOU LIKE.

1085
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,100
CALL IS AT 5:30--
MAKEUP AND COSTUME.

1086
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,000
SAUL'S PACKAGE
ARRIVES AT 7:05.

1087
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,800
LINUS GRABS OUR CODES.

1088
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,800
ALL GOES WELL,
WE'RE A GO.

1089
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:25,200
7:30, YEN GETS LOCKED IN.
WE'RE COMMITTED.

1090
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,100
FROM THIS POINT WE HAVE
30 MINUTES TO BLOW THE POWER

1091
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
OR HE SUFFOCATES.

1092
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,300
Rusty: ONCE
THE ELECTRICITY GOES,

1093
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,700
ALL ACCESS POINTS
TO THE VAULT AND ITS ELEVATOR

1094
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,600
WILL AUTOMATICALLY SHUT DOWN
FOR 2 MINUTES.

1095
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,000
THAT'S WHEN
WE MAKE OUR MOVE.

1096
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,800
OK, IT PUTS YOU
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM,

1097
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,700
10 FEET FROM EVERYTHING.

1098
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,100
YOU HAVE TO GET
FROM THERE TO THE DOOR

1099
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,500
WITHOUT TOUCHING THE FLOOR.

1100
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,400
WHAT DO YOU DO?

1101
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,400
10 SAYS HE SHORTS IT.

1102
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,300
20.
20.

1103
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,600
HMM.

1104
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,000
WINDOW OR AISLE, BOYS?

1105
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,900
YEAH,
WE'RE IN DEEP SHIT.

1106
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,300
THAT POXY DEMO CREW
HAVEN'T USED A COAXIAL

1107
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,700
TO BATTEN THE MAIN LINE,
HAVE THEY?

1108
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,600
THEY'VE ONLY NOSED UP
THE MAINFRAME COUPLET.

1109
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000

01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,100
Policeman:
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

HOW LONG
WILL YOU BE?

1912
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:28,400
ABOUT 3 TO 6 MONTHS,
I GUESS.

1913
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,300
UHH.

1914
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:17,400
I HOPE
YOU WERE THE GROOM.

1919
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,500
BLEW IT ALL ON THE SUIT.

1920
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:39,900

HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

1924
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,500
I'M NOT SURE
THESE BELONG TO ME.

1925
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:02,100

DOWN THE ROAD.

1929
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:10,800
YOU SAID
THAT YOU SOLD THIS.

1930
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:12,200
I SAID THAT.

1931
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,600
