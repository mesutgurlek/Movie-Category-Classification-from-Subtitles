02:07:59,755 --> 02:08:01,814
You write down
every word I say.

1857
02:08:01,891 --> 02:08:06,658
Anything you don't understand, you ask.
I will answer just once, so write it down.

1858
02:08:06,729 --> 02:08:10,529
Precedents for habeas corpus,
cruel and unusual punishment here.

1859
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,034
You're also allowed to help
on Durham decree.

1860
02:08:13,102 --> 02:08:15,263
How much can you
charge for this?

1861
02:08:15,338 --> 02:08:17,863
You gotta know what you're
talkin' about first.

1862
02:08:17,940 --> 02:08:20,374
You do your homework,
jailhouse lawyer...

1863
02:08:20,443 --> 02:08:23,503
can make as much as
any mid-level attorney on the street.

1864
02:08:23,579 --> 02:08:25,706
I'm gonna live
in here.

1865
02:08:27,116 --> 02:08:31,052
- Jerry, I don't mean to be nosy, but I...
- Then don't be.

1866
02:08:33,156 --> 02:08:35,886
All right, what?
What is it?

1867
02:08:35,958 --> 02:08:38,552
I'm just
wonderin', uh...

1868
02:08:38,628 --> 02:08:41,062
You own all those
hardware stores.

1869
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:43,496
How come
you're in here?

1870
02:08:44,867 --> 02:08:47,927
Eleven tons of Colombian weed,
twelve keys of heroin...

1871
02:08:48,004 --> 02:08:50,802
and a pilot that turned
state's evidence.

1872
02:08:51,841 --> 02:08:55,868
<i>¡Chingao! Big time.</i>

1873
02:08:55,945 --> 02:08:58,607
- Hey, Jer, I just want you to handle my ca...
- Hurry up, Jerry.

1874
02:08:58,681 --> 02:09:01,582
Charlie. I didn't see your jacket here.
You got an appointment?

1875
02:09:01,651 --> 02:09:04,176
<i>The name's Carlos. Remember, I'm
paying you lot of feria, ese.</i>

1876
02:09:04,253 --> 02:09:06,744
- Make an appointment, Charlie.
- You should be working on my case overtime.

1877
02:09:06,822 --> 02:09:10,280
Charlie, cool out or get out.
George? Table.

1878
02:09:12,595 --> 02:09:18,363
<i>Oye, Miklo. You could take your leg off and
hook down some of the books from up top, ese.</i>

1879
02:09:18,434 --> 02:09:23,428
<i>Hey, I'm just kidding, ese.
Come here. Oye, come here, man.</i>

1880
02:09:23,506 --> 02:09:28,136
<i>Hey, relax. I got the medicine
to make you well, vato. Mira.</i>

1881
02:09:28,211 --> 02:09:31,772
<i>If you're ever in any pain, homey, you
just come talk to me. ¿Me entiendes?</i>

1882
02:09:33,916 --> 02:09:35,884
<i>- You should talk to El Mero Mero.
- Chale.</i>

1883
02:09:35,952 --> 02:09:39,444
Think about the future, not the past.
Montana's not God.

1884
02:09:39,689 --> 02:09:43,455
<i>[Carlos] Tomorrow at the council I'm giving
Onda a chance to move into the driver's seat.</i>

1885
02:09:43,525 --> 02:09:45,652
<i>Don't be
left behind, eh?</i>

1886
02:09:45,727 --> 02:09:49,561
<i>Mira. I cut a sweet deal
with the AV-ers.</i>

1887
02:09:49,631 --> 02:09:52,429
<i>They'll supply me
with all the dope I can move...</i>

1888
02:09:52,501 --> 02:09:55,334
just as long as I sell
only to the blacks and the browns.

1889
02:09:56,705 --> 02:10:00,937
What do you have to give
in return to the polar bears?

1890
02:10:02,677 --> 02:10:05,305
I gotta plug up
the B.G.A. Pipeline.

1891
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:07,314
Take 'em outta
the dope business.

1892
02:10:10,018 --> 02:10:14,478
<i>It's simple. Me and my soldados
can take care of Pockets in here.</i>

1893
02:10:14,556 --> 02:10:18,014
<i>My brother Smokey can take out Cheap
Times, their main supply joint in L.A.</i>

1894
02:10:18,093 --> 02:10:21,119
All I need from the council
is backup.

1895
02:10:21,196 --> 02:10:26,395
- In return, I'm prepared to give Onda a third of my profit.
- It's a sucker's deal, ese.

1896
02:10:28,270 --> 02:10:32,502
The only thing the Aryans want is
to start a war between black and brown.

1897
02:10:32,574 --> 02:10:34,565
<i>Chale. We've got
a truce with the B.G.A.</i>

1898
02:10:34,643 --> 02:10:37,942
<i>Why do you wanna play
the chimp with these mayates?</i>

1899
02:10:38,013 --> 02:10:40,481
The market is there.

1900
02:10:40,549 --> 02:10:43,712
Cocaine is America's
cup of coffee.

1901
02:10:46,154 --> 02:10:48,714
<i>Oye, check it out.</i>

1902
02:10:48,790 --> 02:10:50,724
<i>I'm making so much feria
right now,</i>

1903
02:10:50,792 --> 02:10:53,955
it's making Miklo's gambling book
look like bubble gum change!

1904
02:10:54,029 --> 02:10:57,226
We don't start wars
to become dope pushers.

1905
02:10:57,299 --> 02:10:59,995
<i>You even addicted some of
our own soldados to coca.</i>

1906
02:11:00,068 --> 02:11:04,562
We're supposed to protect
our people, not destroy them.

1907
02:11:04,639 --> 02:11:08,166
Look at his arms. He loves
that shit more than he loves us.

1908
02:11:08,243 --> 02:11:11,804
<i>- He'll destroy La Onda.
- ¡Ya! Enough words.</i>

1909
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:15,976
We've come all this way. You wanna
go back to bumming cigarettes, ese?

1910
02:11:16,051 --> 02:11:19,509
<i>- Oye, you wanna shine shoes?
- Ese, La Onda don't shine shoes.</i>

1911
02:11:19,588 --> 02:11:22,580
That's right, but that's what's gonna
happen if we don't make our move now.

1912
02:11:22,657 --> 02:11:26,218
I wanna own the whole fuckin' store!
Now are you with me?

1913
02:11:26,294 --> 02:11:29,422
<i>I say chale.
You're not the leader here.</i>

1914
02:11:29,498 --> 02:11:31,398
<i>I say Onda's
not with you.</i>

1915
02:11:31,466 --> 02:11:33,559
You do what you
have to do without us.

1916
02:11:43,478 --> 02:11:46,413
'Cause I ain't goin' back.

1917
02:11:48,083 --> 02:11:50,381
I don't need Onda for this.

1918
02:11:50,452 --> 02:11:53,853
Money buys my backup.

1919
02:11:53,922 --> 02:11:56,982
I'll get the polar bears
to back my play.

1920
02:11:59,995 --> 02:12:02,088
<i>- Oye, ¿adonde vas, Jose?
- I split, eh.</i>

1921
02:12:02,163 --> 02:12:04,256
<i>- Hey, carnal.
- No, ese.</i>

1922
02:12:08,236 --> 02:12:12,195
<i>Carlos, come back!
Jefe, we can't let him go.</i>

1923
02:12:12,274 --> 02:12:14,970
We can't let him
split up Onda. Carlos!

1924
02:12:15,043 --> 02:12:18,410
<i>[Jerry] Can't you see Montana's
stupid for letting Charlie walk?</i>

1925
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:20,505
<i>- Onda's committing suicide.
- Fuck you, Jerry!</i>

1926
02:12:20,582 --> 02:12:22,709
Fine. I thought you wanted
to learn something.

1927
02:12:25,921 --> 02:12:27,855
Listen, Charlie's
a businessman.

1928
02:12:27,923 --> 02:12:29,857
He broke some serious
business rules.

1929
02:12:29,925 --> 02:12:32,155
Not only did he get strung out
on his own shit,

1930
02:12:32,227 --> 02:12:34,957
but he moved on B.G.A. Clients
when he didn't have to.

1931
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:36,964
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

1932
02:12:37,032 --> 02:12:39,796
I see the jackets of most
of the cons that come in here.

1933
02:12:39,868 --> 02:12:42,769
Eighty percent of them...
eighty percent of them are drug cases.

1934
02:12:42,837 --> 02:12:45,362
You know why?
Because everybody out there's doin' it.

1935
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:47,499
Doctors, lawyers,
housewives.

1936
02:12:47,576 --> 02:12:50,010
Cocaine is
America's cup of coffee.

1937
02:12:54,316 --> 02:12:56,580
You were Carlos' connection.

1938
02:12:56,651 --> 02:13:01,452
<i>He said the same "cup of coffee"line
exactly. You were supplying him.</i>

1939
02:13:01,523 --> 02:13:04,515
<i>You're pissed 'cause he's
doing business with AV-ers now.</i>

1940
02:13:04,593 --> 02:13:08,051
Last year, California passed
a flat-time law for drug offenders.

1941
02:13:08,129 --> 02:13:10,654
You know what that means? That means
they have it worse than anybody...

1942
02:13:10,732 --> 02:13:12,723
murderers, rapists,
anybody.

1943
02:13:12,801 --> 02:13:15,099
There's no parole,
no good time.

1944
02:13:15,170 --> 02:13:19,300
That's a lot of guys that are gonna be
here for a real long time, all drug users.

1945
02:13:19,374 --> 02:13:21,308
Can you see
the potential?

1946
02:13:21,376 --> 02:13:23,367
- Can you?
- Yeah.

1947
02:13:23,445 --> 02:13:25,504
Anyone who can accommodate
that appetite...

1948
02:13:25,580 --> 02:13:29,038
can control this joint
and every other joint.

1949
02:13:29,117 --> 02:13:31,017
Dwell on it.

1950
02:13:38,293 --> 02:13:41,126
[Lightning] Drive it.
Drive it, Ryder.

1951
02:13:41,196 --> 02:13:43,528
Here's your pill briefs.

1952
02:13:43,598 --> 02:13:47,125
Jerry said it will take at least
three months for the court to respond.

1953
02:13:47,202 --> 02:13:49,727
Well, well, well,
Lightning.

1954
02:13:49,804 --> 02:13:52,864
<i>Our favorite spic lover has come home.
I knew he'd be back.</i>

1955
02:13:52,941 --> 02:13:58,709
Here's your file. Magic said to remind you
about Lightning's account. It's overdue.

1956
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:03,376
You hear that, Lightning? The cripple
here wants to collect your gambling debts.

1957
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:08,783
Yeah, well, I might think about it,
if he'll show me his falsie.

1958
02:14:10,125 --> 02:14:11,888
Come on, cripple,
show me your stump.

1959
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:14,394
<i>[Ryder] Little white Mexican boy...</i>

1960
02:14:14,462 --> 02:14:16,487
came all the way back
just to show us his stump.

1961
02:14:16,564 --> 02:14:20,056
- Hold his fuckin' leg! Come on. Stand still.
- Get off me, motherfuckers!

1962
02:14:20,135 --> 02:14:23,036
Too many britches on.
Stay still, goddamn it, I said!

1963
02:14:23,104 --> 02:14:25,334
You gotta be crazy to pull
this shit, Lightning!

1964
02:14:25,407 --> 02:14:27,341
Ooh, I'm scared, punk.

1965
02:14:27,409 --> 02:14:30,242
<i>I'll bet you didn't fight so hard when
Big Al used to do this, did you?</i>

1966
02:14:30,311 --> 02:14:32,176
He must be laughin'
in his grave, cripple.

1967
02:14:32,247 --> 02:14:34,841
Get off, you fuck...
No, leave it alone!

1968
02:14:34,916 --> 02:14:37,749
Stay still,
goddamn it.

1969
02:14:37,819 --> 02:14:42,279
<i>- Oh! There she is.
- Fucking puto!</i>

1970
02:14:42,357 --> 02:14:45,986
You ever heard that old saying,
"Put your foot in your mouth"?

1971
02:14:47,929 --> 02:14:50,591
Spit-shine that shoe, boy.

1972
02:14:52,701 --> 02:14:56,694
- You fuckin' polar bears are gonna pay, believe me!
- [Ryder Spits]

1973
02:14:56,771 --> 02:15:00,366
Look around you, half-breed.
Onda's finished!

1974
02:15:00,442 --> 02:15:02,376
Carlos works for us now,

1975
02:15:02,444 --> 02:15:05,038
and every day he brings
more Onda soldiers with him.

1976
02:15:05,113 --> 02:15:08,310
You greasers better wise up.
It's a white world.

1977
02:15:08,383 --> 02:15:11,045
<i>The coloreds are here
to serve us.</i>

1978
02:15:11,119 --> 02:15:14,885
From now on, you're gonna be
my personal errand boy.

1979
02:15:16,324 --> 02:15:19,316
- You motherfucker!
- Fuckin' punk!

1980
02:15:19,394 --> 02:15:22,886
Go out for a pass, cripple.
Come on, go deep.

1981
02:15:27,736 --> 02:15:29,795
[Laughter]

1982
02:15:31,539 --> 02:15:33,871
Now you're back to
your true nature, boy.

1983
02:15:33,942 --> 02:15:37,639
<i>- Crawling on your belly like a worm.
- [Laughter]</i>

1984
02:15:38,947 --> 02:15:40,881
They put it in my face!

1985
02:15:40,949 --> 02:15:44,851
You have to understand. Your leg is gone,
Miklo. You can no longer be a soldier.

1986
02:15:44,919 --> 02:15:46,853
That's why I put you
in the library.

1987
02:15:46,921 --> 02:15:49,947
It's not what they did to me.
They got no respect for Onda.

1988
02:15:50,024 --> 02:15:52,015
We should never have
given up Carlos.

1989
02:15:52,093 --> 02:15:56,393
You think I wanted to?
Carlos fucked up, bad!

1990
02:15:56,464 --> 02:15:59,331
I'm not saying he didn't,
but he was right about the drugs.

1991
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:01,368
Whoever controls them
controls everything.

1992
02:16:01,436 --> 02:16:04,371
You ever seen an old drug dealer,
Miklo? They don't exist.

1993
02:16:04,439 --> 02:16:06,703
Look, all we have
to do is wait.

1994
02:16:06,774 --> 02:16:10,210
<i>In five years, Chicanos are gonna be the
majority in the pintas in the Southwest.</i>

1995
02:16:10,278 --> 02:16:12,405
This is now,
not five years from now!

02:27:03,798 --> 02:27:05,789
No, but my warden has
and he's Chicano.

2139
02:27:05,867 --> 02:27:08,700
Well, is your warden related
to someone on the Onda council?

2140
02:27:08,770 --> 02:27:11,762
Miklo Velka is my...
is my cousin.

2141
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:14,832
I am related to him
by blood and by this.

2142
02:27:14,909 --> 02:27:18,345
Look, Lieutenant,
I don't mean any disrespect,

2143
02:27:18,413 --> 02:27:20,847
but I think I can get further
on this thing than you can.

2144
02:27:20,915 --> 02:27:22,906
All I'm asking is
that I'm involved.

2145
02:27:29,424 --> 02:27:30,857
Thank you.

2146
02:27:31,492 --> 02:27:37,362
There is no war here, Bonafide. This was a
personal thing between Carlos and Pockets.

2147
02:27:37,431 --> 02:27:40,298
Carlos and Pockets were loose cannons.
That was business.

2148
02:27:40,368 --> 02:27:44,134
But what you all did in L.A.
Night before last was bullshit.

2149
02:27:44,205 --> 02:27:46,139
There's gonna be more blood

Onda had nothing to do
with Cheap Times.

2153
02:27:52,747 --> 02:27:56,843
Carlos' brother, Smokey,
acted on his orders, not Onda's,

2154
02:27:56,918 --> 02:27:58,909
and he's paid the price
with his life.

2155
02:27:58,986 --> 02:28:01,045
Cheap Times make for
cheap lives. Lots of'em.

You want a war? We're ready.
Believe me, we'll win.

2157
02:28:04,692 --> 02:28:08,685
We've got more soldiers and they'll go all
the way... to the death if they have to.

2158
02:28:08,763 --> 02:28:11,755
I got soldiers. My soldiers are
ready to die. We can prove that.

2159
02:28:11,833 --> 02:28:15,769
Is that what you want? I guarantee
that's what the Aryans want.

- Uh-uh.

2163

Maybe for Soto at Folsom, but your word
ain't reachin' to Chino right now.

We were all innocent, eh.</i>

2569
03:00:00,939 --> 03:00:04,898
That's all gone, Cruzito.
It ain't like that anymore.

2570
03:00:04,976 --> 03:00:08,434
<i>What, not even a little carnalismo
left in there, ese?</i>

2571
03:00:08,513 --> 03:00:11,846
What, you think you use brotherhood up
like a shot of tequila?

2572
03:00:11,917 --> 03:00:16,081
<i>[Cruz] You just drink it down,
it burns, makes you feel good, ya?</i>

2573
03:00:16,154 --> 03:00:18,486
<i>And you're left with a hangover
the rest of your life?</i>

2574
03:00:18,557 --> 03:00:20,525
Look, man, you showed me
your mural.

2575
03:00:20,592 --> 03:00:22,685
You're a good artist.
I think you're the best.

2576
03:00:22,761 --> 03:00:24,752
Now come on. Let's go.

2577
03:00:24,829 --> 03:00:28,094
Just 'cause you wear sunglasses
don't mean you're blind, ese.

2578
03:00:28,166 --> 03:00:30,760
Oh, shit! You wanna know
what I see up there?

2579
03:00:30,835 --> 03:00:33,235
A fantasy, man.
A dream.

2580
03:00:33,305 --> 03:00:35,967
Three vatos looking for
something that wasn't there.

2581
03:00:36,041 --> 03:00:40,410
Loco, we stood by each other.
We trusted each other.

2582
03:00:40,478 --> 03:00:42,241
<i>¡Orale! That's
worth believing in!</i>

2583
03:00:42,314 --> 03:00:44,282
<i>Shit, we were familia,
homes.</i>

2584
03:00:44,349 --> 03:00:48,843
And never again, Cruzito.
Miklo and I are finished, man.

2585
03:00:48,920 --> 03:00:52,219
<i>He ain't my family!
I hate that fuckin' puto!</i>

2586
03:00:52,290 --> 03:00:54,781
You oughta scrape his ass
off the wall like dirt.

2587
03:00:54,859 --> 03:00:59,319
<i>Chale, vato. No matter how much hate there is
between you and him, you're still connected.</i>

2588
03:00:59,397 --> 03:01:02,457
You got the same blood pumping
through both your hearts, ese.

2589
03:01:02,534 --> 03:01:04,729
That's a bond
you can never break.

2590
03:01:04,803 --> 03:01:07,601
Neither can Miklo.

2591
03:01:07,672 --> 03:01:09,572
He's still just trying
to be like you!

2592
03:01:09,641 --> 03:01:12,166
<i>- That's bullshit!
- ¡Simon, ese! Come on!</i>

2593
03:01:12,244 --> 03:01:15,145
<i>¡El Gallo Negro!
The baddest Chicano in the barrio!</i>

2594
03:01:15,213 --> 03:01:18,205
Yeah, well, that ain't me!
Not anymore.

2595
03:01:20,885 --> 03:01:22,819
You ain't changed
a bit, ese.

2596
03:01:24,222 --> 03:01:26,190
Oh, so what?
What are you saying?

2597
03:01:26,258 --> 03:01:28,522
It's all my fault the way
everything turned out?

2598
03:01:40,739 --> 03:01:42,730
Oh, I see.

2599
03:01:49,748 --> 03:01:51,841
<i>Orale.</i>

2600
03:01:51,916 --> 03:01:54,817
What, you think you got
so much fucking power, huh?

2601
03:01:58,089 --> 03:02:01,354
<i>You control everybody's
destiny? Chale.</i>

2602
03:02:04,262 --> 03:02:07,322
- No, you're right, man. I set Miklo up.
- No, I'm not.

2603
03:02:07,399 --> 03:02:10,800
I made him go after Spider.
I started the whole fuckin' thing.

2604
03:02:10,869 --> 03:02:13,497
Relax, ese.

2605
03:02:13,571 --> 03:02:16,438
- Your back wouldn't be all fucked up.
- [Sighs]

2606
03:02:16,508 --> 03:02:20,205
- Miklo wouldn't be in prison. He'd still have his leg.
- Hey, I forgive you, ese.

2607
03:02:20,278 --> 03:02:22,644
I don't want
your forgiveness, man!

2608
03:02:24,683 --> 03:02:28,983
You know, that's your fuckin' problem,
ese. You can't forgive yourself.

2609
03:02:31,856 --> 03:02:34,620
You need that guilt.
It's what keeps you going.

2610
03:02:34,693 --> 03:02:38,959
Hey, I know, bro. I fed mine
through a needle for ten years.

2611
03:02:42,400 --> 03:02:45,801
<i>And that guero up there, hating
his own fuckin' white skin?</i>

2612
03:02:45,870 --> 03:02:48,532
Shit, he's got it worse
than both of us.

2613
03:02:51,242 --> 03:02:55,804
<i>You gotta cut it loose, carnal.
It's fucking poison!</i>

2614
03:02:57,415 --> 03:02:59,542
That's who we are.

2615
03:02:59,617 --> 03:03:03,485
<i>Three vatos locos
full of carnalismo,</i>

2616
03:03:03,555 --> 03:03:06,422
trying to survive
in a fuckin' war zone.

2617
03:03:06,491 --> 03:03:12,157
<i>But what I know now, bro, is that I need
my familia to do it. We all do.</i>

2618
03:03:14,632 --> 03:03:18,363
<i>Even you, ¡pinche jura!
Badass cop.</i>

2619
03:03:18,436 --> 03:03:20,961
Hey, don't back away,
vato.

2620
03:03:21,039 --> 03:03:24,440
<i>Life's a risk, carnal.
Remember? You said it yourself.</i>

2621
03:03:24,509 --> 03:03:27,876
<i>¡Pues orale!
Step into the ring and throw down, ese.</i>

2622
03:03:27,946 --> 03:03:31,541
You a badass?
Take care of business, homes.

2623
03:03:31,616 --> 03:03:33,914
<i>¡Caiga, puto!</i>

2624
03:03:33,985 --> 03:03:36,886
'Cause we're
from East Los, ese!

2625
03:03:38,056 --> 03:03:41,492
We come out chased
by hounds! Huh?

2626
03:03:43,728 --> 03:03:48,495
<i>Round and round we go,
wearing a pinche rabbit's foot for luck.</i>

2627
03:03:48,566 --> 03:03:50,659
<i>Just ahead of the fuckin'
hounds. ¡Qu'iubo!</i>

2628
03:03:50,735 --> 03:03:53,169
- Ow!
- Yeah!

2629
03:03:53,238 --> 03:03:57,265
<i>¡Que vida es!
Que loca vida, homes.</i>

2630
03:04:02,180 --> 03:04:04,842
<i>¿Pero sabes que, ese?</i>

2631
03:04:04,916 --> 03:04:08,010
<i>- [Sniffling]
- Hey.</i>

2632
03:04:08,086 --> 03:04:12,682
We got something better
than a rabbit's foot, homes.

2633
03:04:12,757 --> 03:04:15,555
<i>We've got familia!</i>

2634
03:04:17,962 --> 03:04:20,021
<i>Raza, huey.</i>

2635
03:04:29,240 --> 03:04:32,698
Hmm? You know
what I'm saying, ese?

2636
03:04:32,777 --> 03:04:34,870
<i>Crees mucho,
Gallo Negro.</i>

2637
03:04:34,946 --> 03:04:37,972
You may be bad, but you
can't dance like Smooth Cruz.

2638
03:04:38,049 --> 03:04:39,949
<i>¡Orale!
Yo y tu, ese.</i>

2639
03:04:40,018 --> 03:04:43,681
Oh, I see now.
I remember you, vato.

2640
03:04:43,755 --> 03:04:45,814
<i>- ¡Ah! ¡Ay, ay, ay!
- El Gallo Negro, vato.</i>

2641
03:04:45,890 --> 03:04:48,688
<i>- I'm a lover, not a fighter, man.
- Oh, si.</i>

2642
03:04:48,760 --> 03:04:51,854
<i>Simon. El merengue
at the Tender Trap '72.</i>

2643
03:04:51,930 --> 03:04:55,593
<i>- Rucas got their hearts broke and I kicked your ass. Pow! Pow!
- Shit!</i>

2644
03:04:55,667 --> 03:04:57,567
Shit, man, I was breakin'
hearts and faces, vato.

2645
03:04:57,635 --> 03:05:01,799
<i>[Cruz] ¡Oh, si! Bullshit!
You still can't dance, ese!</i>

2646
03:05:01,873 --> 03:05:05,001
<i>You still can't dance.
¿Yque, loco?</i>

2647
03:05:05,076 --> 03:05:07,943
<i>Yeah, but you can learn, ese.
I'll teach you. Simon.</i>

2648
03:05:08,012 --> 03:05:11,004
'Cause it ain't ever over,
homes. Never!

2649
03:05:11,082 --> 03:05:13,846
<i>Bailamos hasta que
nos morimos, ese.</i>

2650
03:05:13,918 --> 03:05:15,943
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>
