Well, I see that you're

You have no idea of the consequences

Actually, there's a little more to it.

Most of our students
are here on scholarship.

The cost of repairing
the damage that you did

is roughly the equivalent
of one student's tuition.

what that means?

You just cost someone their future.

You're so eager to get to work
you're sprinting off to the supply closet?

324

It's 15 minutes.
Don't I get a grace period or something?

325
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:58,142
You've neither earned one, nor are you
entitled. But you can stay 15 minutes later.

What happened?

328
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:11,455
Came down on my ankle wrong
in class today.

329
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:14,366
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. It's just a sprain.

330
00:21:14,436 --> 00:21:17,964
Doctor says I have to stay off of it.
I'm really sorry.

331
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,976
- For what? It's not your fault.
- I know, Nora.

332
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:23,809
It's just that the showcase
means a lot to both of us.

333
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:27,079
Maybe you could find someone
to rehearse with in the meantime.

334
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,917
I should be back before you know it.

335
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,423
Yeah. Um...

336
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:33,961
Don't worry about it.
I'll be OK.

337
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:37,295
All right.
Cool. I'll see you later.

Oh, word.

That's where my boy Mac is from.
He lives over at Heritage now, though.

Oh, yeah?

344

I don't live over there no more.
I live with my aunt now.

He only has a bad sprain. I need someone
to rehearse with until he gets better.

349
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,182
You know all the stuff
I have going on with the labels.

350

How come Miles
can find the time to help me?

351
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,760
No offense to Miles, but he's not involved
in every aspect of the music as I am.

352
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:20,269
Look, all I need is somebody, Brett,
to rehearse with just for a couple of weeks.

I'm just so close with my music,

No. What about
choreographing a solo?

One, two, three, four.

758
00:47:48,763 --> 00:47:51,232
- That's actually really good.
- Cool.

759
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,792
I think we should do it.

760
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,738
Let's try it again.
Five, six, seven, eight.

761
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:03,181
I guess I'll just see you tomorrow, then.

762
00:48:03,249 --> 00:48:05,343
- OK.
- All right.

763
00:48:07,455 --> 00:48:10,083
You need a ride?

764
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:11,524
Um... <i>(laughs)</i>

765
00:48:11,594 --> 00:48:13,620
You ever even been out to Hampden?

766
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,665
No, but there's a place I go near there.

767
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:26,504
I'm serious.
Where are you takin' me?

768
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:29,209
Hold on.
I'm about to show you.

769
00:48:29,284 --> 00:48:32,015
Hold it. Is this...
Is this where you kill me?

770
00:48:32,088 --> 00:48:33,680
Funny.

771
00:48:40,032 --> 00:48:41,864
This is it.

772
00:48:48,977 --> 00:48:51,139
Yeah. I mean...

773
00:48:51,214 --> 00:48:54,582
I got a view just like this,
you know, from my balcony.

774
00:48:54,651 --> 00:48:58,145
- You do?
- No.

775
00:48:58,223 --> 00:49:03,423
- How did you find this place?
- I been comin' here since I was a kid.

776
00:49:03,497 --> 00:49:07,696
My dad was an executive
at one of the shipping companies.

777
00:49:08,169 --> 00:49:10,638
This is where
I imagined my whole routine.

778
00:49:10,706 --> 00:49:13,107
I don't know how you do it.

779
00:49:13,176 --> 00:49:17,978
How you think about
how two people are gonna move and...

780
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:22,078
I don't know, every detail.
I couldn't do that.

781
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:25,557
- You've been doing it.
- It's not the same thing, though.

782
00:49:25,626 --> 00:49:27,856
That's how it starts.

783
00:49:28,863 --> 00:49:31,992
I always saw this routine
with a bunch of other dancers.

784
00:49:32,068 --> 00:49:33,900
What do you mean?

785
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:39,034
Well, if I had enough dancers,
I could have them all starting in unison

786
00:49:39,111 --> 00:49:41,238
and then slowly
breaking out in a canon.

787
00:49:41,313 --> 00:49:42,474
Whoa, what's...

788
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:46,247
- What's a canon?
- You know, like "Row Your Boat"?

789
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:48,722
<i>(laughs)</i>

790
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:53,091
OK, I'll show you. You know
that phrase with the turn and lift?

791
00:49:53,629 --> 00:49:55,996
They all have turn and lifts.

792
00:49:57,835 --> 00:50:01,237
All right, what, in the middle section?
Yeah, I know it.

793
00:50:01,307 --> 00:50:04,607
Instead of doing it together,
you're gonna go first.

794

796
00:50:09,418 --> 00:50:11,080
OK, go on "one."

797
00:50:11,153 --> 00:50:13,145
