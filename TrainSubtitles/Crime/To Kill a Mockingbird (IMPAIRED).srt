1088

She hugged me
around the waist.

She reached up and kissed me
on the face.

1091
01:24:47,345 --> 01:24:51,945
She said she'd never kissed
a grown man before...

1092
01:24:52,025 --> 01:24:55,505
and she might as well kiss me.

She says for me
to kiss her back,

1094

"Miss Mayella, let me outta here,"

from the window.

To begin with,

1125
01:28:20,025 --> 01:28:22,545
this case should never
have come to trial.

1126
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:25,585
The State has not produced
one iota...

1127
01:28:25,665 --> 01:28:27,585
of medical evidence...

1128
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:31,225
that the crime Tom Robinson
is charged with...

1129
01:28:31,305 --> 01:28:34,585
ever took place.

1130
01:28:34,665 --> 01:28:36,905
It has relied, instead,

1131
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:40,105
upon the testimony
of two witnesses...

1132
01:28:40,145 --> 01:28:43,385
whose evidence has not only been
called into serious question...

1133
01:28:43,465 --> 01:28:45,905
on cross-examination,

1134

but has been flatly contradicted
by the defendant.

1135
01:28:51,905 --> 01:28:55,185
There is circumstantial evidence
to indicate that...

Mayella Ewell
was beaten savagely...

1137

by someone who led,
almost exclusively, with his left.

1138

with the only good hand

1141
01:29:27,505 --> 01:29:32,065
I have nothing but pity
in my heart...

1142
01:29:32,105 --> 01:29:35,905
for the chief witness
for the State.

1143
01:29:37,985 --> 01:29:43,225
She is the victim
of cruel poverty and ignorance.

1144
01:29:46,705 --> 01:29:50,025
But my pity...

1145
01:29:50,065 --> 01:29:53,105
does not extend so far...

1146
01:29:53,185 --> 01:29:57,345
as to her putting
a man's life at stake,

1147
01:29:57,385 --> 01:30:02,625
which she has done in an effort
to get rid of her own guilt.

1148
01:30:02,705 --> 01:30:05,785
Now I say "guilt," gentlemen,

1149
01:30:05,865 --> 01:30:11,265
because it was guilt
that motivated her.

She's committed no crime.

1151
01:30:16,265 --> 01:30:19,065
She has merely broken
a rigid and time-honored...

1152
01:30:19,145 --> 01:30:22,665
code of our society--

1153
01:30:22,745 --> 01:30:26,905
a code so severe that whoever breaks it
is hounded from our midst...

1154
01:30:26,985 --> 01:30:29,065
as unfit to live with.

1155

of her offense ?

She must put Tom Robinson
away from her.

1160
01:30:51,785 --> 01:30:55,465

a daily reminder...

of what she did.

1162

Now, what did she do ?

1163
01:31:01,545 --> 01:31:03,585
She tempted a Negro.

1164
01:31:03,665 --> 01:31:07,865
She was white,
and she tempted a Negro.

1165
01:31:07,945 --> 01:31:12,545
She did something that,
in our society, is unspeakable.

1166
01:31:12,585 --> 01:31:14,985
She kissed a black man.

1167

Not an old uncle,

1168

but a strong, young Negro man.

1169
01:31:25,105 --> 01:31:28,745
No code mattered to her
before she broke it,

would not be doubted.

that all Negroes lie,

all Negroes are basically
immoral beings,

1180

all Negro men are not
to be trusted around our women.

1181
01:32:20,225 --> 01:32:25,305
An assumption that one associates
with minds of their caliber,

1182
01:32:25,385 --> 01:32:29,945
and which is, in itself,
gentlemen, a lie,

which I do not need
to point out to you.

respectable Negro,

to feel sorry
for a white woman,

against two white people's.

[ Atticus ]
Heck, l-l--

1392
01:57:48,705 --> 01:57:53,745
I guess that
the thing to do is, uh--

1393
01:57:56,545 --> 01:58:01,105
Good Lord...
I must be losin' my memory.

1394
01:58:02,465 --> 01:58:07,825
I can't remember
whether Jem is 12 or 13.

1395
01:58:10,785 --> 01:58:16,305
Anyway, it'll have to come
before the county court.

1396
01:58:19,105 --> 01:58:22,905
Of course, it's a clear-cut case
of self-defense.

1397
01:58:22,945 --> 01:58:26,385
I'll, uh-- Well, I'll run down
to the office--

1398
01:58:26,465 --> 01:58:28,945
Mr. Finch...

1399
01:58:29,025 --> 01:58:31,505
do you think Jem
killed Bob Ewell ?

1400
01:58:31,585 --> 01:58:34,705
Is that what you think ?

1401
01:58:34,785 --> 01:58:37,905
Your boy never stabbed him.

1402
01:58:54,105 --> 01:58:57,545
Bob Ewell fell on his knife.

1403
01:58:57,625 --> 01:59:00,905
He killed himself.

1404
01:59:04,185 --> 01:59:06,985
There's a black man
dead for no reason.

1405
01:59:07,065 --> 01:59:10,825
Now the man
responsible for it is dead.

1406
01:59:10,905 --> 01:59:13,865
Let the dead bury the dead
this time, Mr. Finch.

1407
01:59:13,945 --> 01:59:16,265
I never heard tell it was
against the law for any citizen...

1408
01:59:16,345 --> 01:59:18,825
to do his utmost to prevent a crime
from being committed,

1409
01:59:18,905 --> 01:59:20,905
which is exactly what he did.

1410
01:59:20,985 --> 01:59:26,345
But maybe you'll tell me
it's my duty to tell the town
all about it, not to hush it up.

1411
01:59:26,425 --> 01:59:28,745
You know what'll happen then.

1412
01:59:28,825 --> 01:59:30,985
All the ladies in Maycomb,
includin' my wife,

1413
01:59:31,065 --> 01:59:35,305
will be knockin' on his door
bringin' angel food cakes.

1414
01:59:35,385 --> 01:59:38,505
To my way of thinkin',
takin' one man,

1415
01:59:38,585 --> 01:59:41,265
who done you and this town
a big service,

1416
01:59:41,345 --> 01:59:45,305
and draggin' him with his shy ways
into the limelight--

1417
01:59:45,385 --> 01:59:48,505
To me, that's a sin.

1418
01:59:48,585 --> 01:59:50,585
It's a sin.

1419
01:59:50,665 --> 01:59:54,425
And I'm not about
to have it on my head.

1420
01:59:54,505 --> 01:59:57,305
I may not be much,
Mr. Finch,

1421
01:59:57,385 --> 02:00:00,825
but I'm still Sheriff
of Maycomb County,

1422

and Bob Ewell fell on his knife.

1423
02:00:04,905 --> 02:00:06,745
Good night, sir.

[ Car Door Shuts, Engine Starts ]

1425
02:00:44,345 --> 02:00:46,865
Mr. Tate was right.

1426
02:00:50,745 --> 02:00:53,265
What do you mean ?

1427
02:00:53,305 --> 02:00:56,945
Well...
it would be...

1428
02:00:56,985 --> 02:01:01,105
sort of like shooting
a mockingbird, wouldn't it ?

1429
02:01:28,025 --> 02:01:30,065
Thank you, Arthur.

1430
02:01:37,585 --> 02:01:40,385
Thank you for my children.

[ Adult Scout ]
Neighbors bring food with death...

1432
02:01:57,265 --> 02:01:59,265
and flowers with sickness...

1433
02:01:59,345 --> 02:02:02,785
and little things in between.

1434
02:02:02,865 --> 02:02:05,505
Boo was our neighbor.

1435
02:02:05,585 --> 02:02:08,225
He gave us two soap dolls,

1436
02:02:08,305 --> 02:02:10,945
a broken watch and chain,

1437

1438
02:02:13,265 --> 02:02:15,585
and our lives.

1439

One time Atticus said...

1440
02:02:23,185 --> 02:02:28,385
you never really knew a man
until you stood in his shoes
and walked around in them.

1441
02:02:32,785 --> 02:02:36,785
Just standing
on the Radley porch was enough.

1442
02:02:43,105 --> 02:02:46,705
The summer that had begun
so long ago had ended,

1443
02:02:46,785 --> 02:02:49,105
and another summer
had taken its place.

1444
02:02:49,185 --> 02:02:51,065
And a fall.

1445
02:02:51,105 --> 02:02:54,425
And Boo Radley had come out.

1446
02:02:57,505 --> 02:03:00,825
I was to think
of these days many times,

1447
02:03:00,865 --> 02:03:02,865
of Jem and Dill...

1448
02:03:02,945 --> 02:03:06,065
and Boo Radley
and Tom Robinson.

1449

And Atticus.

1450
02:03:17,345 --> 02:03:21,265
He would be
in Jem's room all night,

1451
02:03:21,345 --> 02:03:26,065
and he would be there when Jem
waked up in the morning.
