1
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,211
Come on, Daddy!
Let's go play on the beach.

2
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:46,078
Just going to take my
shoes off, okay?

3
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,010
Yeah, it's cold, huh?

4
00:01:58,282 --> 00:02:00,809
It's going to be
a big castle.

5
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,439
Let me know if you
strike oil, okay?

6
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:49,799
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

7
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,751
I've been waiting
here forever.

8
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:54,050
Oh, Dad.

9
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:55,923
The train was on time,
you're always early.

10
00:02:55,924 --> 00:02:58,550
- Are you starting already?
- Why? You can’t take it?

11
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:00,718
Come on, let’s go home.

12
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:24,206
You alright, honey?

13
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:43,858
You know there's things
you can tell me.

14
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:46,417
I’m not as bad at
communication and...

15
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:48,809
so on and so forth as
you might think.

16
00:03:48,809 --> 00:03:50,838
I've lived in the world.

17
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:55,261
I'm not pregnant.

18
00:03:55,262 --> 00:03:58,589
No. No, I wasn't
saying that.

19
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,359
{LAUGHING}

20
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:07,050
Are you seeing someone?

21
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:09,315
Yeah, I am.

22
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:14,881
Someone with a name?

23
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:18,226
- Nah, you wouldn't like him.
- How do you know that?

24
00:04:18,227 --> 00:04:20,504
How do you know
I wouldn't like him?

25
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:23,523
I wish you had someone.

26
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:27,241
Who says I don’t have a honey
stashed away somewhere?

27
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:39,390
You're my girl.

28
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,444
Yeah, well, I'm not really
sure how to cook it.

29
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:44,177
You finally got a vegetable and
I don’t know if I can eat it.

30
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,419
You alright? You've been
to the doctor, right?

31
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,005
When was the last
time you went?

32
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:52,521
- I have a physical every year.
- That's right. They make you.

33
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:56,020
Careful. So how did you
get time off from work?

34
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,391
You don’t even know
what I do.

35
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,004
Of course I know
what you do.

36
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:04,031
Dad. I'm a glorified intern.
I can get off when I want.

37
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:07,262
I wanted to come home.

38
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:09,649
I'm glad you did.

39
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,588
Maybe you'll tell me
what's bothering you.

40
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,542
I'm just tired, you know.

41
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,431
I think I got a bug.

42
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:21,935
Yeah? Want to lay down?
Go upstairs, lay down.

43
00:06:21,936 --> 00:06:23,671
I got your room all
ready for you.

44
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:25,688
I know you do, Dad.

45
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:28,271
Ginger-ale. That will settle
your stomach. I'll get some.

46
00:06:28,272 --> 00:06:30,561
I always keep some
ginger-ale on hand.

47
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,999
Honey, honey.
You alright?

48
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:50,309
- Dad...
- Yeah?

49
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,779
Oh my god I have to
go to a doctor!

50
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,423
Dad, I got to tell you something
I should have told you!

51
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:04,206
I got you.

52
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:07,789
CRAVEN!

53
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,909
Oh Jesus!

54
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:28,441
You're my girl.

55
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:33,575
I... I know...

56
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:47,507
Through this
holy anointment...

57
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,674
love and mercy...

58
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:50,354
with... with the grace...

59
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:53,089
may the... may the...

60
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:36,962
About five nine, five ten.

61
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:38,294
Thinks he was white from
what he could see through

62
00:08:38,295 --> 00:08:39,844
the eyes of the ski mask.

63
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:42,771
Yelled out one word, "Craven",
and then he fired.

64
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,313
Jesus Christ.

65
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,407
Then he ran.
Didn't pursue.

66
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:21,784
You want some water or
coffee or something?

67
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,318
You want something
stronger?

68
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:28,274
I know somewhere in there
is a bottle of Crown Royal

69
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:30,771
with dust all over it.

70
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:39,554
You're going to put the first
foot forward, Tommy,

71
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:44,500
I don’t care if it’s now.
I'll sit with you, okay?

72
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:47,808
Get out.
Get out of here.

73
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:49,672
He's not a basket
case. Get out.

74
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:53,105
- Somebody make some coffee.
- I want a glass of ginger ale.

75
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:54,738
Get him a ginger ale.

76
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,833
We'll get him, Tommy.

77
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:06,415
You know how we
react to thing like this.

78
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,376
Officer involved.

79
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:12,492
"Office involved". We ought to
do that for everybody, right?

80
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:14,991
"Officer involved". Who the fuck
do you think you are?

81
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:18,615
If you want to get philosophical,
I'll get philosophical.

82
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,269
- Want to get cleaned up?
- No, I'm alright.

83
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,944
I want you to come stay
with Carol and me.

84
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:29,317
No.

85
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:33,238
- You can't stay here.
- It's where I live.

86
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,951
- If you won't come with me...
- Just tell everybody to just

87
00:10:37,952 --> 00:10:41,314
get out of here, just finish
what they got to do and go.

88
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:43,365
This is someone armed
and dangerous...

89
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:44,807
What do you think I am?

90
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:49,610
Can everybody get out?
I'd like them to go,

91
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:51,387
can they just go finish
what they do and go?

92
00:10:51,388 --> 00:10:53,915
Get out.
Get out!

93
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:44,935
Craven's phone. Hello?

94
00:13:04,803 --> 00:13:06,827
<I>Are you alright?

95
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:12,369
<I>Dad, are you alright?

96
00:13:14,955 --> 00:13:16,944
Yeah, I'm fine.

97
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,020
Whose my little girl?

98
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:23,981
M.

99
00:13:24,782 --> 00:13:26,040
Whose one of
those sweethearts?

100
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,289
M.

101
00:13:57,065 --> 00:13:58,821
<I>...shooting last night, the
daughter of a Boston

102
00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:02,148
<I>Police Detective leads our
news. Emma Craven, 24,

103
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:04,846
<I>an MIT graduate, was killed
in front of her home in

104
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:08,532
<I>Roslindale by a man thought
to be targeting her father..

105
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:13,894
<I>Cathy, from what I understand,
police don't have much to

106
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,110
<I>go on right now.

107
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:17,760
<I>Lisa, there is still a lot of
unanswered question when it

108
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:20,320
<I>comes to this case.
24 year old Emma Craven

109
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:23,154
<I>was gunned down outside of
this Roslindale home on the

110
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:27,472
<I>porch just behind me. Sources
tell me the suspect in this case...

111
00:14:27,473 --> 00:14:28,832
Turn that shit off.

112
00:14:32,714 --> 00:14:35,386
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

113
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,680
None of your neighbours
saw anything.

114
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:42,655
And the rain hasn't left
much for forensics.

115
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:46,008
We need to go through
your cases, Tommy.

116
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:49,980
You must have an instinct
on this. Something.

117
00:14:50,397 --> 00:14:52,444
Not off the top
of my head, no.

118
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:55,100
They want to see you
upstairs first, anyway.

119
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:56,263
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

120
00:14:56,264 --> 00:14:58,931
This is off-subject, but this
is my daughters phone.

121
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,353
I need a list of all the contacts,
I got to talk to her friends,

122
00:15:01,354 --> 00:15:02,399
- associates, whatever...
- Yeah yeah.

123
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,165
Janet can do all that.
Don't worry about it.

124
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,414
Blocked incomings too.

125
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:11,181
Tom.

126
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:16,395
Sorry for your loss. Anything
you need from me and Mary.

127
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:18,231
And let us know about
the arrangements.

128
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:20,199
It'll be in the Globe
and the Herald.

129
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,436
I haven't been down to,
you know, the...

130
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,231
Thank you.

131
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,889
Bill Whitehouse
is running things.

132
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,966
He has every resource this
department possesses.

133
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:36,012
This is a cop thing.
Officer involved.

134
00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:41,717
So, will you take a
leave of absence?

135
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:43,317
No.

136
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:49,873
We can't have you on this
investigation. It's a rule.

137
00:15:49,874 --> 00:15:52,265
Well, since it's me that's got
to figure out who would want

138
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:55,152
to kill me, for reasons only
I would know about, then

139
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:58,163
I'd rather get paid for it.
So the rules don't apply.

140
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,517
- He's right, isn’t he?
- I think he is, yeah.

141
00:16:08,397 --> 00:16:10,753
I have to make a statement to
the media. Is there anything

142
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:13,119
you want in there? You
want to stand with me?

143
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,977
- No, thank you.
- They want to see you.

144
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:18,301
I don't want any part of it.

145
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:25,068
Alright.

146
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,576
I'm not going to sit in the
Murder Room. No point to it.

147
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:30,581
There's no physical evidence.

148
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:35,517
If we got the gun or something.
Jesus, I can't think.

149
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:39,209
It'll come to me.

150
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:42,159
It'll come to me but it's not
going to come to me here.

151
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,285
I've got to drive around.
I have to think.

152
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,368
You do what you need to do.
You keep me informed.

153
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:48,154
I'll punch you in.

154
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:50,976
I got to go. The Coroner
wants to ID the body.

155
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,268
- Are you up to it?
- Yeah.

156
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:54,272
I want my case files
brought up.

157
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:57,192
Nothing this year makes any
sense to me at all.

158
00:16:57,193 --> 00:16:58,441
Tommy.

159
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:04,905
I'll have them sent
to your house.

160
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:06,928
Sure.

161
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:16,358
Cause of death: injuries
arising from gunshot wounds.

162
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:21,071
Massive haemorrhage. Heart
seizures due to shock.

163
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:29,570
Tom, this is very difficult.

164
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:33,974
You've done this before,
but it's not the same...

165
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:35,223
Let's get it over with.

166
00:17:45,796 --> 00:17:49,619
Is this your daughter,
Emma Charlotte Craven?

167
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:51,176
Yes, it is.

168
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:54,836
Leave her alone.

169
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,656
Let me have
some scissors.

170
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:30,052
- What was that Tom?
- Scissors. I need some scissors.

171
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:22,498
Don't cry.

172
00:19:24,215 --> 00:19:25,352
I'm not.

173
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,776
I don’t know if
I can make it.

174
00:19:36,937 --> 00:19:38,221
You have to.

175
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:45,400
Alright.

176
00:19:52,456 --> 00:19:55,425
You're wasting two guys
here at my house, Bill.

177
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:56,841
If you want them in the
neighbourhood, then have

178
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:58,292
them going door to door.

179
00:19:58,293 --> 00:20:00,938
Someone's trying to kill
you Tom. They're staying.

180
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:05,740
I got nothing. Nothing.
I don't have enemies.

181
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:07,314
I never lived life or said
what I thought enough

182
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:08,559
to have enemies.

183
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,891
Listen, you know
I understand.

184
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:12,045
I'm not stuck in a personal
conversation with you, Bill.

185
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:13,670
Don't get nervous.

186
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:17,872
And tell the two uniforms
in the cruiser to stop pissing

187
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:20,643
in the bushes. They can
come into the house.

188
00:20:44,737 --> 00:20:47,004
This is your beach.

189
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:20,507
<I>Hey Daddy.
Come on in.

190
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:22,185
<I>Come on, Daddy!

191
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:37,371
Okay, sweetheart,
I'll be right there.

192
00:21:37,372 --> 00:21:38,772
Go on.

193
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,634
"NORTHMOOR"

194
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:24,846
"Weapons Query"
"Searching..."

195
00:23:25,828 --> 00:23:28,163
"David Burnham"

196
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,469
Tom!

197
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,298
You ready for this?

198
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:46,025
Ski mask found in a hedge
five doors from you.

199
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:49,266
We got hair. Caucasian.
It's in for DNA.

200
00:23:51,768 --> 00:23:54,559
- Keep me posted.
- Where are you going?

201
00:25:58,053 --> 00:26:00,349
Mr. Burnham?
Mr. Burnham, yeah?

202
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,598
Yeah.

203
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,478
Settle down. Alright?
I'm not going to hurt you.

204
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:13,505
I see you know my daughter.
Are you her boyfriend?

205
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:17,890
Alright. Okay.
I'm Emma’s father.

206
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:20,347
I'm going to let you go now.
You're going to be alright.

207
00:26:20,348 --> 00:26:22,131
- Okay?
- Yeah.

208
00:26:22,132 --> 00:26:25,129
Okay, be nice. Okay?
Jesus.

209
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:31,663
I'm sorry but you're going to
get the fuck out of here now.

210
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:35,862
Give me a minute, alright?
I want to ask you some questions.

211
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:37,139
Why not answer the door
like everybody else?

212
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,969
What the hell are
you so scared of?

213
00:26:41,322 --> 00:26:43,702
Is this your handgun?

214
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:46,723
How did my daughter get
a god damned handgun?

215
00:26:46,724 --> 00:26:48,002
Did you give it to her?
Is this yours?

216
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:49,745
I gave it to her.

217
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,959
Alright.

218
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,656
Why?

219
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:57,422
I didn't notice a shotgun
in your list of weapons.

220
00:26:57,423 --> 00:26:59,417
- Do you own one?
- Do you think that I...?

221
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:00,624
Your pistol.

222
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,000
You licensed it in Vermont,
it's illegal in Massachusetts.

223
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,233
I tell the local police barracks
you opened the door with it

224
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:07,484
that's an automatic year in jail.
Not that I don’t have you

225
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:10,542
by the balls already for trying
to stick me in the doorway.

226
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:13,173
- You'd be lying.
- I don't care.

227
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,388
I know you.
You're her dad.

228
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:19,163
And you never came to
visit her. Didn't even bother.

229
00:27:21,771 --> 00:27:25,360
Yeah, well... you
worked with her.

230
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,965
And I need to know what
kind of trouble she was in.

231
00:27:28,966 --> 00:27:30,974
I can't talk about that.

232
00:27:30,975 --> 00:27:34,314
There's security structures.
Clearance to what we do.

233
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:36,187
I understand you
won't help me.

234
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,197
But I'm confused you
won’t help Emma.

235
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:42,106
She's dead, man. There's
no way to help Emma.

236
00:27:44,972 --> 00:27:46,961
There are probably two
fucking guys out there

237
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:49,765
watching and listening to
us right fucking now

238
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:56,943
Now, I'm sorry, but you need
to get the fuck out of here now.

239
00:27:56,944 --> 00:27:58,261
Please.

240
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:00,512
Or I'm dead.

241
00:28:04,913 --> 00:28:07,015
There's something
I need to give you.

242
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,503
Yeah? Sure, go ahead.

243
00:28:35,654 --> 00:28:37,639
Here's the keys
to her place.

244
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,467
And her personal things.

245
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:42,195
Thanks.

246
00:28:43,444 --> 00:28:45,233
I'm going to leave you alone
now until you realize

247
00:28:45,234 --> 00:28:48,416
you got to talk to me.
Alright?

248
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:49,619
Yeah.

249
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,321
I know you're a good guy
otherwise Emma wouldn't

250
00:28:51,322 --> 00:28:53,051
have nothing to
do with you.

251
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,372
Here's my card. It's got
my cell on it, okay?

252
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:57,773
Call.

253
00:30:17,612 --> 00:30:20,098
You were right,
I don’t like him.

254
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:30,254
Why did you have
a gun, honey?

255
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:27,586
Jesus.

256
00:32:29,552 --> 00:32:32,497
Is there something I
could do for you, Milroy?

257
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:34,761
What do you do
usually, Jed burgh?

258
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:39,293
If someone has a national
security problem...

259
00:32:39,294 --> 00:32:41,872
they dial a number in
{Northern Virginia?}

260
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:44,893
And then I decide
what happens next.

261
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:47,114
What's your problem?

262
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:50,654
You're a consultant in security.
I'm merely consulting.

263
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:52,282
So consult.

264
00:32:56,903 --> 00:32:59,052
There's a company
called North moor.

265
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:02,202
They own a number of
defence department contracts.

266
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,008
It's not an agency front,
if that's what you think.

267
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:08,582
- It's a real private company.
- That is unusual.

268
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:11,370
They have private security.
Autonomous security.

269
00:33:11,371 --> 00:33:13,789
I'm autonomous myself.

270
00:33:14,098 --> 00:33:15,330
These are the facts:

271
00:33:16,422 --> 00:33:19,116
One of their secure facilities
was penetrated.

272
00:33:19,117 --> 00:33:20,963
Three people died
making their escape.

273
00:33:20,964 --> 00:33:23,379
A fourth, an employee who
may have been involved

274
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,542
has been killed.

275
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:27,670
- By North moor security?
- I didn't say that.

276
00:33:28,248 --> 00:33:29,830
No one would.

277
00:33:29,831 --> 00:33:31,893
Fact is, we don't know.

278
00:33:38,257 --> 00:33:40,697
She was shot dead
five nights ago.

279
00:33:40,698 --> 00:33:43,273
Her father is a
Boston Detective.

280
00:33:43,274 --> 00:33:45,898
Boston police are working
on the assumption

281
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,466
that her father was
the target.

282
00:33:47,467 --> 00:33:50,116
And what assumption
are we working on?

283
00:33:50,117 --> 00:33:52,165
That he wasn't.

284
00:33:53,764 --> 00:33:57,918
- Who killed her?
- That's not the issue at this point.

285
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,255
National security
is the issue.

286
00:34:01,526 --> 00:34:06,084
I know your function, Jed burgh.
This has to be cleaned up.

287
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,671
Whatever it takes.

288
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,332
Yes.

289
00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:14,950
Are you absolutely sure you
want me to look into this?

290
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:19,220
Cause you have to be
absolutely sure.

291
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,555
- She was killed in Boston.
- Yeah.

292
00:34:28,562 --> 00:34:30,052
But this isn't a
part of that.

293
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,347
You think it's a
funeral robbery?

294
00:34:33,348 --> 00:34:34,841
Yeah.

295
00:34:35,294 --> 00:34:36,971
Look..

296
00:34:37,564 --> 00:34:39,296
I don't want this mixed up
with the other business.

297
00:34:39,297 --> 00:34:41,317
I don't need the
trouble, alright?

298
00:34:43,235 --> 00:34:45,743
Do me a solid in
Boston sometime.

299
00:34:46,686 --> 00:34:48,004
Thanks.

300
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:09,121
Hello?

301
00:35:09,122 --> 00:35:12,376
Hello. My name is
Tom Craven.

302
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,841
Your number was in my
daughters phone records.

303
00:35:14,842 --> 00:35:17,851
I'm Emma's father.
I'm a policeman.

304
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,520
I just want to know what
you were to Emma.

305
00:35:22,273 --> 00:35:23,493
Find out what happened.

306
00:35:23,494 --> 00:35:26,027
It says in the papers
what happened.

307
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,946
Someone tried to kill you
and they got her.

308
00:35:28,947 --> 00:35:30,703
Is that what you
think happened?

309
00:35:30,704 --> 00:35:33,592
<I>I run a shop.
A luggage shop.

310
00:35:34,724 --> 00:35:36,275
I want to keep
running a shop.

311
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:39,011
I'd like to talk to
you in person.

312
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:43,075
- Would you do that?
- About North moor?

313
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:46,772
Yeah, sure. About anything
you want to talk about.

314
00:35:48,088 --> 00:35:49,605
How do I know
you're you?

315
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,262
When you meet me,
you will know that guy

316
00:35:51,263 --> 00:35:53,606
can't be anyone else
but Emma's father.

317
00:35:56,646 --> 00:35:58,023
Will you help me?

318
00:35:59,738 --> 00:36:02,010
I'm out of state,
I'm at my grandmothers.

319
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:04,407
I have your number,
I'll call you.

320
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:19,832
I'm here to see
John Bennett.

321
00:36:38,217 --> 00:36:42,230
Detective Craven.
Jack Bennett.

322
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:45,503
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

323
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,373
Can I say how shocked we all
were to hear of Emma's death.

324
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,225
She was a valued
member of our team.

325
00:36:50,226 --> 00:36:51,986
I can't say I knew her
very well personally, but

326
00:36:51,987 --> 00:36:55,307
she is well thought of.
She is missed.

327
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:56,557
Thank you.

328
00:36:57,229 --> 00:36:59,405
In the Sixties, this hill
was excavated.

329
00:36:59,405 --> 00:37:01,460
The site for Nike
nuclear missiles.

330
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:03,881
Miles of tunnels
and launch chambers.

331
00:37:03,882 --> 00:37:07,498
- I'm sure Emma told you.
- She never talked about work.

332
00:37:07,499 --> 00:37:10,192
So North moor bought this
from the federal government?

333
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:13,810
- Well, we lease it.
- For money?

334
00:37:13,811 --> 00:37:17,267
- Coffee?
- I'll have a ginger ale.

335
00:37:17,578 --> 00:37:18,826
Certainly.

336
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:21,595
Annie, get Detective Craven
a ginger ale, would you?

337
00:37:21,596 --> 00:37:24,190
- Of course.
- Please.

338
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,239
You have interesting friends.

339
00:37:42,352 --> 00:37:43,809
Yes.

340
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:47,030
This facility, R&D in general,
earns a great deal of money

341
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:50,417
to Massachusetts. As
reflected in the tax breaks.

342
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:52,308
How may I help you?

343
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:55,172
I supposed I want to know
what my daughter did here.

344
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:56,408
In what sense?

345
00:37:57,283 --> 00:37:58,959
She didn't tell you
about our work?

346
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,399
She was following your
security protocols.

347
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,994
And what are they in
your understanding?

348
00:38:04,995 --> 00:38:08,024
I don’t understand anything.
She never talked about work.

349
00:38:08,025 --> 00:38:09,274
Right.

350
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,515
Well you'll understand that
most of what we do here

351
00:38:11,516 --> 00:38:13,913
is classified. Almost
everything we do.

352
00:38:13,914 --> 00:38:16,229
What she did, despite
her qualifications,

353
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,919
your daughter
was a trainee.

354
00:38:18,351 --> 00:38:20,467
Of course, she was a full
employee and there's a...

355
00:38:20,468 --> 00:38:23,503
benefit package I suppose you
should see Personnel about.

356
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:25,526
I'm not interested
in that just yet.

357
00:38:25,907 --> 00:38:28,621
All our people are
very well insured.

358
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:30,173
I bet they are.

359
00:38:32,401 --> 00:38:35,164
Well, what we do here...

360
00:38:36,034 --> 00:38:38,409
Northwood is essentially
a research facility.

361
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:40,098
We have a mandate from
government to develop

362
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:43,791
a safe and clean energy source
based on fusion technology.

363
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:45,718
- Very green.
- And weapons?

364
00:38:46,817 --> 00:38:48,179
Do you make them?

365
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:50,951
Well, If we did, it
would be classified.

366
00:38:51,627 --> 00:38:54,131
I can tell you, since you are a
policeman and have access to

367
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:56,832
this information anyway, that
North moor is an important part

368
00:38:56,833 --> 00:39:00,023
of the nation’s nuclear stockpile
and maintenance program.

369
00:39:00,024 --> 00:39:02,728
We ensure that the nations
nuclear stockpile remains ready

370
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:04,080
for the presidents order.

371
00:39:04,594 --> 00:39:07,826
- Not weapons, raw materials.
- Emma was a part of this?

372
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:10,466
God no. As an intern, she didn't
have any direct involvement

373
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:13,544
whatsoever. She worked on
the research floor.

374
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:19,348
We all very very much
regret Emma's death.

375
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,456
It must be especially
painful for you.

376
00:39:22,457 --> 00:39:24,158
In the circumstances.

377
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:27,908
You mean that she was
shot instead of me.

378
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:31,831
As a parent I can only guess
at your pain, I think.

379
00:39:31,832 --> 00:39:35,505
Though I'm sure I cannot
imagine its full dimensions.

380
00:39:36,387 --> 00:39:38,532
I've taken up enough
of your time.

381
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:40,216
I'd like to talk to
her friends if any.

382
00:39:40,217 --> 00:39:43,402
Yes, of course. I'll see what
I can do. I'll tell Personnel.

383
00:39:43,403 --> 00:39:45,383
Give you a list. Of contact
numbers and so forth.

384
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,625
Can I ask you a question?

385
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:52,375
What does it feel like?

386
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:10,905
- David.
- You ready for this?

387
00:40:10,906 --> 00:40:13,445
- I'm ready for anything.
- We have a DNA match.

388
00:40:13,446 --> 00:40:16,410
Oh, really?
Give me the skinny.

389
00:40:47,088 --> 00:40:49,282
You got no buzz of
this guy? Nothing?

390
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:53,328
This guy was a professional.
This guy was a hit man.

391
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:02,326
What's the matter? You
were looking at something.

392
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:03,666
Tell me what you're
looking at.

393
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:06,458
It says in the evidence log the
hair you found was 2,5 inches.

394
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:08,174
So he cut his hair.

395
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:10,057
Not as recently as
a week ago.

396
00:41:10,058 --> 00:41:13,195
- So what are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.

397
00:41:13,196 --> 00:41:15,977
Hair can stick to a hat
for a long time. Years.

398
00:41:16,694 --> 00:41:17,962
Decades.

399
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,253
Why would a pro blow off
two barrels with a shotgun

400
00:41:20,254 --> 00:41:24,443
instead of saving
one for his target?

401
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:54,793
Creeping up on a bereaved
man at a murder scene

402
00:41:54,986 --> 00:41:56,496
is not very bright.

403
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,677
Mr. Craven, we have
things to talk about.

404
00:42:00,302 --> 00:42:02,290
Like your name and
what you're doing here?

405
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:04,710
Like who shot
your daughter.

406
00:42:07,198 --> 00:42:08,854
You know who
shot my daughter?

407
00:42:08,855 --> 00:42:11,619
If I was looking for a man who
might have shot your daughter,

408
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,160
and I had a limited imagination,
of which I do not,

409
00:42:15,161 --> 00:42:18,593
I might have looked at the
poor bastard you found today.

410
00:42:19,448 --> 00:42:21,177
A known killer.

411
00:42:21,548 --> 00:42:27,355
An unusually well known
killer. Makes you think.

412
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:31,812
- What are you burning?
- None of your business.

413
00:42:41,944 --> 00:42:43,434
Yeah, go ahead.

414
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,627
- Cigar?
- Not celebrating just now.

415
00:42:49,628 --> 00:42:52,647
I know you don't smoke.
I saw your DARPA file.

416
00:42:52,648 --> 00:42:55,527
That's my way of telling you
you've got a DARPA file.

417
00:42:56,963 --> 00:42:58,879
Are you going to tell
me what that is?

418
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,219
Defence Advance Research
Project Agency.

419
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:06,009
Their slogan is:
"Scent est. Potential"

420
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:08,086
And I know you know Latin.

421
00:43:09,262 --> 00:43:12,650
Stood serum. You know what
that means, yeah?

422
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:15,475
- Stand the fuck up.
- Please do so.

423
00:43:37,913 --> 00:43:40,273
Well it seems like you're
no one in particular.

424
00:43:40,714 --> 00:43:42,597
Just some English guy,
standing on my lawn,

425
00:43:42,598 --> 00:43:45,077
with a District of Columbia
drivers license.

426
00:43:46,032 --> 00:43:47,410
Thank you.

427
00:43:49,374 --> 00:43:52,550
- Is North moor part of DARPA?
- Well, that's hard to tell.

428
00:43:54,663 --> 00:43:55,300
Why are you here?

429
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:57,796
Your daughter was flagged as
a possible terrorist threat to

430
00:43:57,797 --> 00:44:00,467
United States of America.

431
00:44:01,735 --> 00:44:04,587
I said "flagged",
I didn't say she was.

432
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:11,043
It's funny the Boston Police
Department didn't come up

433
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:12,814
- with that one.
- Funny if they had.

434
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:15,959
What the fuck are you
burning out there?

435
00:44:16,152 --> 00:44:17,785
Fucking Christ.

436
00:44:17,786 --> 00:44:22,387
My English friend Mr. Davenport,
about 6 feet tall, 220 pounds,

437
00:44:22,388 --> 00:44:24,515
is enjoying a cigar.

438
00:44:25,135 --> 00:44:27,026
Did he put it out?

439
00:44:29,027 --> 00:44:31,109
You said my daughter
was a terrorist.

440
00:44:31,686 --> 00:44:34,658
I didn't. But someone did.

441
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:38,555
Who are you, Mr. Jed burgh?

442
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:40,307
I'm a friend of the corps.

443
00:44:40,308 --> 00:44:42,978
And I'm a bit fucking
cold out here.

444
00:44:46,213 --> 00:44:48,657
Pills, pills, pills.

445
00:44:48,658 --> 00:44:52,523
Not like when we were kids.
When it was pills, pills, pills

446
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:54,685
in a very different context.

447
00:44:57,892 --> 00:45:00,621
You're not much of a
partier, are you Craven?

448
00:45:00,622 --> 00:45:02,667
Do you believe in fun?

449
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:05,001
What, do you mean recently?

450
00:45:07,907 --> 00:45:09,958
What's your interest
in my daughter’s death?

451
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:13,219
I don't like the look of it.
Tell me what you think.

452
00:45:28,787 --> 00:45:30,325
Do you recognize?

453
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:32,733
Should I?

454
00:45:33,345 --> 00:45:37,194
They broke into a US classified
nuclear research facility,

455
00:45:37,195 --> 00:45:40,995
then drowned in the Connecticut
river making their escape.

456
00:45:40,996 --> 00:45:44,165
Now I know that sounds like
bollocks. But it's not.

457
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:46,760
North moor isn't federal.
I checked.

458
00:45:46,761 --> 00:45:49,806
So if you're saying my daughter
was involved with these people

459
00:45:49,807 --> 00:45:52,320
the most you can get her
for is trespassing.

460
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:56,418
Her apartment was tossed.
Her computer was stolen.

461
00:45:56,859 --> 00:45:59,841
And do the police know
that you know that?

462
00:46:01,898 --> 00:46:03,262
No.

463
00:46:06,676 --> 00:46:08,915
You're a smart fucker.

464
00:46:09,324 --> 00:46:11,066
What does North moor do?

465
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:13,460
What have they done?

466
00:46:13,461 --> 00:46:17,097
The people who drowned
belonged to "Night Flower".

467
00:46:17,098 --> 00:46:20,146
Tree huggers. Militants.
New Age fuckups.

468
00:46:20,147 --> 00:46:22,075
Sometimes they
blow shit up.

469
00:46:22,076 --> 00:46:24,998
Infrequently, and
not very well.

470
00:46:24,999 --> 00:46:28,109
You can look them up.
The organization itself,

471
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:30,879
not the dead guys.
They are classified.

472
00:46:32,605 --> 00:46:37,232
She wasn't an activist. Not the
type. My daughter wasn't a joiner.

473
00:46:37,232 --> 00:46:39,388
She was more like me.

474
00:46:39,836 --> 00:46:43,306
If she did anything, whatever
she did, she did it alone.

475
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:47,098
There's a point where anyone
can become an activist.

476
00:46:47,493 --> 00:46:52,136
I mean you see something
so wrong, you have to act.

477
00:46:52,137 --> 00:46:54,821
Even if it means
the end of you.

478
00:46:56,058 --> 00:46:59,012
Let’s just say
she was involved.

479
00:46:59,013 --> 00:47:02,357
Her companions died.
Then she came home.

480
00:47:02,357 --> 00:47:04,440
She didn't say anything.

481
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:08,395
She meant to, she wanted to,
but she didn't make it.

482
00:47:13,766 --> 00:47:17,554
I'm going to advise my
department of one,

483
00:47:17,555 --> 00:47:22,121
which is me, to let you
continue your investigation,

484
00:47:22,122 --> 00:47:25,958
even if you sometimes burn
the evidence in your backyard.

485
00:47:25,959 --> 00:47:28,678
And you, an officer
of the corps.

486
00:47:30,194 --> 00:47:32,261
I'm not going to
arrest anyone.

487
00:47:33,904 --> 00:47:35,406
I never do.

488
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,692
Will you try to stop me?

489
00:47:40,374 --> 00:47:42,422
It depends.

490
00:47:51,025 --> 00:47:52,831
See you around.

491
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:59,035
I do sometimes like that
feel like Diogenes.

492
00:47:59,036 --> 00:48:01,555
You know the guy who
walked around with a lamp.

493
00:48:01,556 --> 00:48:03,901
Looking for an honest man.

494
00:48:04,731 --> 00:48:06,345
How did it turn out?

495
00:48:06,346 --> 00:48:10,387
Well, for him?
I don't remember.

496
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,720
But you and I have
done pretty good.

497
00:48:13,674 --> 00:48:15,489
Bonne chance.

498
00:48:41,217 --> 00:48:43,762
I thought you were going to
wait until I was a nice guy.

499
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,805
As a career move man, I
seriously need to be seen

500
00:48:47,806 --> 00:48:49,622
telling you to fuck off.
You have no idea,

501
00:48:49,623 --> 00:48:51,839
you don't understand.
Go home! Go home!

502
00:48:55,789 --> 00:48:57,874
There's nothing you
can do to me.

503
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,761
There are times when you
don’t have a choice what

504
00:48:59,762 --> 00:49:01,562
kind of fucking guy you are.

505
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:04,283
You understand that because
you're doing it right now.

506
00:49:05,888 --> 00:49:06,944
May I?

507
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,466
Drinking the good stuff because
your job is going so well?

508
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:17,232
Is this an intervention?

509
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:18,792
If it is I'd like to call a
few people that don't

510
00:49:18,793 --> 00:49:21,604
whack me around because
I’m afraid for my life.

511
00:49:29,484 --> 00:49:32,362
I assumed you'd be
some kind of scientist.

512
00:49:32,363 --> 00:49:35,103
Didn't think your daughter
would go for a grease monkey?

513
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:40,313
Something like that. Yeah.
If you want to beat yourself up.

514
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:43,799
And what if I said she said
I reminded her of you?

515
00:49:44,142 --> 00:49:45,749
Except drinking.

516
00:49:46,514 --> 00:49:48,737
Something to do with the
absence of bullshit and

517
00:49:48,738 --> 00:49:51,417
no patience for
Broadway musicals.

518
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,545
You're looking at me
like I'm crazy.

519
00:49:54,546 --> 00:49:57,173
Somebody shot my girlfriend,
have you factored that in?

520
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,762
What do you know
about Night Flower?

521
00:50:04,771 --> 00:50:07,899
- Politics don't interest me.
- What did interest you?

522
00:50:10,589 --> 00:50:11,755
Emma.

523
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:21,251
Look. I'm under contract.
I have a five year contract.

524
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:24,013
I'm shrivelled. I'm going to
loose my fucking job

525
00:50:24,014 --> 00:50:26,279
if I talk to you no
matter who's dead.

526
00:50:28,045 --> 00:50:30,425
How did my daughter get
people through the security

527
00:50:30,426 --> 00:50:33,301
in a classified nuclear
R&D facility?

528
00:50:34,444 --> 00:50:36,001
There's a rumour
she had help.

529
00:50:36,002 --> 00:50:38,397
- You?
- No.

530
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,819
I passed the polygraph
at work.

531
00:50:43,904 --> 00:50:45,200
What happened?

532
00:50:45,956 --> 00:50:47,466
Come on, level with me
here, I'm not a cop.

533
00:50:47,467 --> 00:50:49,436
Now it's just you and me.
What happened?

534
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:55,249
You got somewhere
else we can talk?

535
00:50:59,496 --> 00:51:03,061
You didn't pass the polygraph,
they just told you you did.

536
00:51:04,256 --> 00:51:06,677
Emma was writing to
Senator Pine.

537
00:51:06,678 --> 00:51:10,235
And at some point she went
to this grease ball loco.

538
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:11,287
A lawyer to see about
getting out of her...

539
00:51:11,288 --> 00:51:13,399
What was the name
of the lawyer?

540
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:17,645
- Sampson... Sander man.
- Sander man.

541
00:51:17,646 --> 00:51:20,381
Anyway, said nobody
could help her.

542
00:51:20,382 --> 00:51:22,820
Whistleblowers always
sound like psychos.

543
00:51:22,821 --> 00:51:24,710
And I didn't get
back to her.

544
00:51:24,711 --> 00:51:27,001
So she helped out these
Night Flower assholes.

545
00:51:28,232 --> 00:51:30,245
She got them in through
the cooling tunnels.

546
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:35,662
She didn't go in herself.
But she was there.

547
00:51:36,813 --> 00:51:39,417
How was Emma
exposed to radiation?

548
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:41,400
She wasn't.

549
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,926
That's what I’m saying, she
didn't go into the tunnels,

550
00:51:44,927 --> 00:51:46,945
they were exposed, but she
couldn't have been exposed,

551
00:51:46,946 --> 00:51:48,891
she wasn't in the tunnels.

552
00:51:50,104 --> 00:51:52,315
What happened to the
people that went in?

553
00:51:52,316 --> 00:51:54,030
There's a protocol.

554
00:51:54,254 --> 00:51:56,285
It's Bennett. He's insane.

555
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:01,166
In case of a breach, they
release irradiated steam.

556
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:04,422
Now I can't prove this,
and you can't prove it,

557
00:52:04,423 --> 00:52:07,027
these are clever,
clever fuckers, right?

558
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,556
You're a cop. You've
got to help me.

559
00:52:10,557 --> 00:52:12,129
Yeah. Sure. Yeah,
I will help you.

560
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,684
Just come with me.
Tell me the truth.

561
00:52:13,685 --> 00:52:15,002
We'll get you deposed
by a lawyer.

562
00:52:15,003 --> 00:52:17,828
No. I'm sorry, no.

563
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:20,879
I like you, you're Emma's dad.

564
00:52:21,365 --> 00:52:22,936
But you have to go.

565
00:52:26,741 --> 00:52:29,834
Alright. You can always
change your mind.

566
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:33,085
In the meantime,
here, this is yours.

567
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:36,453
It's loaded.

568
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:41,769
That's illegal in
Massachusetts.

569
00:52:42,346 --> 00:52:44,747
Everything is illegal
in Massachusetts.

570
00:57:02,298 --> 00:57:06,241
What does it feel like?
Hmm?

571
00:57:30,811 --> 00:57:32,864
<I>- Good evening, Senator.
- Good evening, glad to be here.

572
00:57:32,865 --> 00:57:35,526
<I>Senator, two days ago you
gave a speech in which you

573
00:57:35,526 --> 00:57:38,910
<I>criticized your colleague Senator
Stafford, for his position

574
00:57:38,911 --> 00:57:40,926
<I>- We all have positions.
- But Senator...

575
00:57:40,927 --> 00:57:44,372
<I>I think the American people
are asking, with good reason,

576
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:47,592
<I>whether the price they've paid
for their security is too high.

577
00:57:47,593 --> 00:57:50,220
<I>With respect, that's an answer
one would expect, but how

578
00:57:50,221 --> 00:57:52,560
<I>does it jibe, Senator, with
your support for secret

579
00:57:52,561 --> 00:57:55,095
<I>research facilities in
Massachusetts?

580
00:57:55,788 --> 00:57:58,249
<I>I'm curious about what
you just asked of me.

581
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,306
<I>If you're asking...

582
00:58:04,056 --> 00:58:07,544
...about this administrations
failed policies...

583
00:58:02,544 --> 00:58:05,442
<I>Senator, what can you tell
me about North moor?

584
00:58:05,443 --> 00:58:08,010
<I>I'm not familiar with the
business practices of...

585
00:58:08,011 --> 00:58:10,364
<I>Their parent company is one
of your biggest donors.

586
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:12,562
<I>All I can say about my
donors is that they are

587
00:58:12,563 --> 00:58:14,848
<I>completely vetted and
above board.

588
00:58:14,849 --> 00:58:18,308
<I>Senator, there is a serious
and growing petition movement

589
00:58:18,309 --> 00:58:21,891
<I>to ban military research and
development in Massachusetts.

590
00:58:21,892 --> 00:58:25,943
<I>I understand that. But people
have to realize the importance

591
00:58:25,944 --> 00:58:29,866
<I>of R&D of every kind to
Massachusetts economy.

592
00:58:29,867 --> 00:58:33,249
<I>Now, to answer your questions
about some other stuff...

593
00:58:33,283 --> 00:58:36,158
<I>I fully agree with his
desires to expand...

594
00:59:05,865 --> 00:59:07,902
I never had kids.

595
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:12,710
Maybe it's better not to have
had one than to see one die.

596
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,682
No.

597
00:59:17,372 --> 00:59:20,078
It's worth everything
to have one.

598
00:59:22,741 --> 00:59:24,691
Public drinking is illegal
in Massachusetts.

599
00:59:24,692 --> 00:59:27,688
Everything is illegal
in Massachusetts.

600
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:30,123
Payback for the tea party.

601
00:59:31,212 --> 00:59:33,063
You've ever had
wine before?

602
00:59:33,064 --> 00:59:35,239
Not with any pleasure.

603
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,199
Besides, with you, I think I'd
have to switch glasses

604
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,036
when you weren't looking.

605
00:59:44,176 --> 00:59:47,389
My daughter was irradiated.
I don’t know how exactly,

606
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:49,841
but I think it was our
friends at North moor.

607
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:52,664
Later she was gunned
down in my home.

608
00:59:52,665 --> 00:59:54,957
And I want to know what
you would think about that.

609
00:59:56,919 --> 00:59:58,789
I had a source that said the
Night flower people were

610
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:02,105
intentionally exposed to
radiation while in the tunnels,

611
01:00:02,106 --> 01:00:04,119
but that source is dead now.

612
01:00:04,664 --> 01:00:06,857
He wasn't a bad guy.

613
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:08,469
No.

614
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:10,985
Now you know
better than anyone

615
01:00:10,986 --> 01:00:13,061
cases like these
are never solved.

616
01:00:13,062 --> 01:00:16,258
Simply too complicated,
too much hard work.

617
01:00:16,994 --> 01:00:19,384
There is a lot going on
out there in this world.

618
01:00:19,808 --> 01:00:22,859
You just never can
connect "A" to "B".

619
01:00:23,517 --> 01:00:24,914
How do you know that?

620
01:00:24,915 --> 01:00:26,938
Because I'm usually the guy
that stops you connecting

621
01:00:26,939 --> 01:00:27,974
"A" to "B".

622
01:00:27,975 --> 01:00:30,013
It's part of what I do.

623
01:00:37,244 --> 01:00:39,560
If I was an employee
at North moor,

624
01:00:40,014 --> 01:00:42,954
and I wanted to blow the
whistle on something...

625
01:00:42,955 --> 01:00:45,113
what would I be blowing
the whistle on?

626
01:00:45,114 --> 01:00:48,092
Let's take a walk and
we can talk about it.

627
01:00:48,323 --> 01:00:50,679
I'm not walking into
the dark with you.

628
01:00:51,253 --> 01:00:53,116
You're a wise man.

629
01:00:55,305 --> 01:00:59,008
- Are you on my side?
- That's hard to tell.

630
01:00:59,732 --> 01:01:02,525
Do you know the Scott
Fitzgerald thing about

631
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:06,685
an artist who's a man with
opposing ideas in his head,

632
01:01:06,686 --> 01:01:08,882
and he believe in them
both simultaneously?

633
01:01:08,883 --> 01:01:10,346
Heard of it. Yeah.

634
01:01:10,347 --> 01:01:12,708
Well, that's sort of the
beginning of it.

635
01:01:15,802 --> 01:01:20,111
So what's that like? Not
being anyone in particular.

636
01:01:23,023 --> 01:01:26,689
I don't know what it means
to have lost a daughter.

637
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:29,816
But I know what it means
never to have had one.

638
01:01:34,339 --> 01:01:35,962
Yeah.

639
01:01:35,963 --> 01:01:37,817
Got nobody left
to bury you.

640
01:01:39,442 --> 01:01:40,771
Yeah.

641
01:01:52,115 --> 01:01:54,006
Oh and by the way...

642
01:01:54,007 --> 01:01:55,816
Thanks for not killing me.

643
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:12,214
Detective Craven. How do
you feel about a suspect

644
01:02:12,215 --> 01:02:13,987
being identified?

645
01:02:16,746 --> 01:02:18,652
You're later than
everybody else.

646
01:02:19,214 --> 01:02:21,858
Is that because you
have a lousy boss?

647
01:02:24,508 --> 01:02:26,954
I'm so sorry for you.

648
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:28,743
I'm sorry I have
to be here.

649
01:02:29,084 --> 01:02:30,741
It's alright, take it easy.

650
01:02:30,742 --> 01:02:33,051
You got a business
card or something?

651
01:02:34,369 --> 01:02:35,719
Thanks.

652
01:02:38,709 --> 01:02:41,720
Look, go on home, honey.
It's too late to be out here.

653
01:02:41,721 --> 01:02:43,567
I'll call you, okay?

654
01:03:02,869 --> 01:03:04,394
Mr. Sander man?

655
01:03:04,908 --> 01:03:07,090
I'm sorry, I didn’t mean
to... I interrupted?

656
01:03:07,091 --> 01:03:08,827
- No.
- I'm Tomas Craven.

657
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:10,776
Detective Tomas Craven,
Boston Police Department.

658
01:03:10,777 --> 01:03:12,201
I know who you are.

659
01:03:12,201 --> 01:03:15,374
- I'm sorry for your troubles.
- Thank you.

660
01:03:15,712 --> 01:03:18,229
I understand my daughter
was a client of yours?

661
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,271
Yes.

662
01:03:19,272 --> 01:03:22,811
I mean no, we had a consultation,
she never formally became

663
01:03:22,812 --> 01:03:24,048
my client.

664
01:03:24,609 --> 01:03:25,822
Oh.

665
01:03:25,823 --> 01:03:27,439
It says in her phone
calendar that you and she

666
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,629
had dinner on the
18th of last month.

667
01:03:30,342 --> 01:03:32,528
Yeah, I asked her
on a date, yes.

668
01:03:32,529 --> 01:03:36,750
- Well how did it go?
- Fine. Fine.

669
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:39,426
She was a nice girl.

670
01:03:39,883 --> 01:03:41,475
Smart as a...

671
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:45,557
- Sorry, I have to go.
- I'll come with you.

672
01:03:46,942 --> 01:03:48,245
Can I ask you what
this is about?

673
01:03:48,246 --> 01:03:50,096
She came to your office.
She wanted to blow

674
01:03:50,097 --> 01:03:51,316
the whistle on something.

675
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,924
You know where
that's from, right?

676
01:03:52,925 --> 01:03:54,692
When the cops used to
blow their whistles.

677
01:03:54,693 --> 01:03:55,631
I can't talk about that.

678
01:03:55,632 --> 01:03:57,412
I don't want you
to talk about that.

679
01:03:57,412 --> 01:04:00,120
But then later that night you
invited her out for dinner.

680
01:04:00,665 --> 01:04:02,785
Gee, you're really
nervous, Mr. Sander man.

681
01:04:02,786 --> 01:04:04,855
You're about two seconds
away from telling me how

682
01:04:04,856 --> 01:04:06,397
inappropriate all this is.

683
01:04:06,835 --> 01:04:08,683
Let me say right off the bat,
I knew you couldn't represent

684
01:04:08,684 --> 01:04:11,010
her in a non-disclosure contract,
but you probably suggested

685
01:04:11,011 --> 01:04:13,088
some further discussion on the
matter over a nice plate of

686
01:04:13,089 --> 01:04:14,670
spaghetti and meatballs.

687
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,855
I think you had two agendas.
One, you wanted sex with her.

688
01:04:17,856 --> 01:04:19,849
Hey I'm not passing
judgment here okay,

689
01:04:19,849 --> 01:04:23,109
and two, Mr. Sander man, you
wanted to know more about

690
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:24,812
what potential security
breach she represented.

691
01:04:24,813 --> 01:04:27,596
I have to get to a
deposition in Springfield.

692
01:04:42,891 --> 01:04:45,204
You represent North moor
in local matters.

693
01:04:45,205 --> 01:04:47,835
My daughter came to you, but
you're North moors attorney.

694
01:04:47,836 --> 01:04:49,416
This is a highly
irregular converse...

695
01:04:50,025 --> 01:04:51,447
...because senator Pine has
put your name before

696
01:04:51,448 --> 01:04:54,527
two different governors
for District Court Judge.

697
01:04:54,899 --> 01:04:56,276
So you were about
to say something?

698
01:04:56,277 --> 01:04:58,788
I don't have anything to say
and you are out of your depth

699
01:04:58,789 --> 01:05:00,044
and far from your
jurisdiction.

700
01:05:00,045 --> 01:05:01,956
You won't talk to me? I'm going
to the Global and the Herald.

701
01:05:01,957 --> 01:05:04,327
I'll tell them my daughter came
to talk to you about North moor.

702
01:05:04,328 --> 01:05:07,095
That you were North moors
attorney and failed to tell her.

703
01:05:07,096 --> 01:05:08,724
And then you'd be right in
the middle of a big ass story

704
01:05:08,725 --> 01:05:11,037
saying how my daughter
was the target and not me.

705
01:05:11,038 --> 01:05:12,082
Is that where you
want to be?

706
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:13,795
On what evidence
would you say that?

707
01:05:13,796 --> 01:05:15,736
I'll forge your fucking
diary. I don't care.

708
01:05:15,737 --> 01:05:16,940
Getting you in trouble is
good enough for me.

709
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:19,810
Listen, asshole, this is not
about police, okay?

710
01:05:19,811 --> 01:05:22,057
This isn't about police and
arrest and all that nice shit,

711
01:05:22,058 --> 01:05:23,753
this is about me knowing what
I have to know and the fact

712
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:25,110
that you got to tell me.

713
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,334
Now I want to see
the Senator.

714
01:05:27,335 --> 01:05:30,191
See the Senator? Who the
fuck do you think you are?

715
01:05:30,191 --> 01:05:32,699
I'm the guy with nothing to
lose that doesn't give a shit.

716
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,824
You tell him that. And fasten
your fucking seatbelt.

717
01:05:42,395 --> 01:05:44,913
<I>Look, Daddy.
Lots of ABCs

718
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:55,098
Hi.

719
01:05:56,764 --> 01:05:58,474
I want to go to
her apartment.

720
01:05:59,319 --> 01:06:00,997
I want to see
her things.

721
01:06:02,145 --> 01:06:04,806
That's not a good
idea right now.

722
01:06:06,094 --> 01:06:07,372
I'm sorry.

723
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:10,051
I'm so scared.

724
01:06:10,292 --> 01:06:12,969
Look. I would take you for
a cup of coffee some day,

725
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,710
but we have to
just talk now.

726
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:17,132
I'd like to ask you things about
her. Personal things maybe

727
01:06:17,133 --> 01:06:20,292
I never knew, but there's
no time now...

728
01:06:22,108 --> 01:06:24,365
Look, honey, I can't
take this, okay?

729
01:06:24,366 --> 01:06:28,775
I... talk to me, okay?
Talk to me.

730
01:06:35,056 --> 01:06:39,680
- I introduced her to them.
- Introduced her to who, honey?

731
01:06:39,681 --> 01:06:41,433
Night flower.

732
01:06:42,221 --> 01:06:43,917
Fuck, you know.

733
01:06:43,918 --> 01:06:46,074
Corporations this,
corporations that.

734
01:06:46,075 --> 01:06:47,626
Just keep it
straight, okay?

735
01:06:50,785 --> 01:06:52,579
They had a little
shack up the river.

736
01:06:53,095 --> 01:06:54,548
Night flower.

737
01:06:55,326 --> 01:06:58,441
- I'm so afraid.
- Who are you afraid of?

738
01:07:00,456 --> 01:07:03,567
They came to my house.
These guys in black suits,

739
01:07:03,568 --> 01:07:06,285
asking about Emma,
I lied my ass off!

740
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:08,549
What were they doing in
North moor that Emma

741
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:10,330
wanted to expose?

742
01:07:10,331 --> 01:07:13,453
Bennett’s the motherfucker.
Alright? It's Bennett.

743
01:07:13,454 --> 01:07:15,954
That's all she wanted to say
at first. That he was insane.

744
01:07:15,955 --> 01:07:17,836
She realized he was
completely fucking insane.

745
01:07:17,837 --> 01:07:20,196
Okay, whether he was
this, that or whatever,

746
01:07:20,197 --> 01:07:21,527
What were they doing
at North moor?

747
01:07:21,528 --> 01:07:23,384
Why did Emma go to
Night flower?

748
01:07:23,385 --> 01:07:25,824
Because she couldn't go to the
papers because of the contract.

749
01:07:25,825 --> 01:07:29,365
The Senator wouldn't help. You
are not hearing this from me.

750
01:07:29,366 --> 01:07:30,577
Alright, you are not.

751
01:07:30,578 --> 01:07:34,565
I run a luggage store.
I got a three year old.

752
01:07:34,566 --> 01:07:36,520
I'm not hearing this
from you.

753
01:07:37,312 --> 01:07:40,065
What did they do at North moor
that Emma wanted to expose?

754
01:07:47,925 --> 01:07:49,278
She had this for you.

755
01:07:49,855 --> 01:07:50,900
In case...

756
01:07:52,951 --> 01:07:54,745
I never wanted...

757
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:57,158
I'm just a person.

758
01:07:57,387 --> 01:07:59,075
You know, I'm just
a fucking person.

759
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:00,753
Okay. I know.

760
01:08:01,217 --> 01:08:03,449
Go back to your
baby, okay?

761
01:08:03,676 --> 01:08:05,223
I never saw you.

762
01:08:05,904 --> 01:08:08,016
Alright? Go on.

763
01:08:16,034 --> 01:08:18,394
I got to tell you
something else first.

764
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:19,643
What?

765
01:08:24,015 --> 01:08:26,045
She thought they
poisoned her.

766
01:08:36,498 --> 01:08:38,209
You know...

767
01:08:39,739 --> 01:08:42,042
I always liked
this town.

768
01:08:43,628 --> 01:08:45,938
When she moved
out here...

769
01:08:46,171 --> 01:08:49,603
She said it reminded her
of Paris in the Twenties.

770
01:08:49,604 --> 01:08:52,964
We have a very traditional
home in Boston, and...

771
01:08:52,965 --> 01:08:56,831
maybe it wasn't what she
wanted out of life, you know?

772
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:03,341
What was the name of
her contact in Night flower?

773
01:09:03,342 --> 01:09:04,925
Tell me that and
we're done.

774
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:07,737
No, I'm done now.

775
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:10,697
In her phone records it
was a guy called Robinson.

776
01:09:10,698 --> 01:09:12,632
Is that the guy?

777
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,833
Yeah.
Now I'm done.

778
01:10:18,023 --> 01:10:19,635
We've stabilized her.

779
01:10:19,636 --> 01:10:23,246
She's in a coma, although we
weren't able to save her leg.

780
01:10:26,616 --> 01:10:28,164
She has a child, is there
anybody who could...

781
01:10:28,165 --> 01:10:30,357
Her parents just arrived.

782
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:32,205
Thanks.

783
01:10:40,587 --> 01:10:43,647
Go ahead. I'll
keep you posted.

784
01:10:45,225 --> 01:10:46,700
Thanks.

785
01:11:28,065 --> 01:11:31,283
<I>My name is Emma
Charlotte Craven.

786
01:11:31,284 --> 01:11:33,308
<I>I work at North moor,
Massachusetts,

787
01:11:33,309 --> 01:11:35,090
<I>as a research assistant.

788
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:37,307
<I>I know that I am violating
the security conditions

789
01:11:37,308 --> 01:11:41,284
<I>of my workplace, and I
know I am committing a crime.

790
01:11:41,285 --> 01:11:44,730
<I>But I'm doing this because I've
exhausted every legal avenue

791
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:47,753
<I>that is available to me,
and no one would listen.

792
01:11:47,754 --> 01:11:50,561
<I>So, now I have to
do what's right.

793
01:11:50,562 --> 01:11:52,690
<I>North moor is
breaking the law.

794
01:11:52,691 --> 01:11:54,746
<I>They are making
nuclear weapons.

795
01:11:54,747 --> 01:11:56,521
<I>But these are not US
nuclear weapons,

796
01:11:56,522 --> 01:11:59,644
<I>they are weapons designed
to foreign specification

797
01:11:59,645 --> 01:12:01,594
<I>and built with
foreign materials.

798
01:12:01,595 --> 01:12:04,648
<I>So, obviously, if these
bombs were ever used,

799
01:12:04,649 --> 01:12:06,831
<I>they would be traced
back to another country,

800
01:12:06,832 --> 01:12:08,654
<I>and not the US.

801
01:12:08,655 --> 01:12:13,794
<I>I've stolen documents,
images, blueprints.

802
01:12:13,795 --> 01:12:16,216
<I>But we need proof of
the weapons themselves,

803
01:12:16,217 --> 01:12:19,613
<I>so I'm showing a team
of people how to get into

804
01:12:19,614 --> 01:12:23,049
<I>the North moor facility
to video the evidence.

805
01:12:24,281 --> 01:12:27,934
<I>I'm recoding all this
because I'm very scared.

806
01:12:27,934 --> 01:12:30,103
<I>I'm under constant
surveillance.

807
01:12:30,104 --> 01:12:33,353
<I>My phone is tapped
and I'm being followed.

808
01:12:33,354 --> 01:12:38,471
<I>So chances are that if you're
watching this I'm already dead.

809
01:12:39,422 --> 01:12:40,739
<I>I...

810
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,276
<I>I love you, dad.

811
01:12:51,613 --> 01:12:53,108
Fuck

812
01:13:56,463 --> 01:13:58,589
If another contractor asks
to run his own security,

813
01:13:58,590 --> 01:13:59,681
What should I say?

814
01:13:59,682 --> 01:14:01,874
I suppose that
would be up to you.

815
01:14:02,675 --> 01:14:05,426
This is called a containment
situation. I wonder why, really.

816
01:14:05,427 --> 01:14:07,492
The problem is that there
are things uncontained

817
01:14:07,493 --> 01:14:09,524
and some of them will
never get back in the box.

818
01:14:09,525 --> 01:14:11,587
You're scared about
Craven. Very wisely so.

819
01:14:11,588 --> 01:14:14,101
But here is the damage
control analysis:

820
01:14:14,102 --> 01:14:16,689
Apart from Craven, three sets
of parents have lost their kids.

821
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:19,373
Now you have an employee
who tries to run over

822
01:14:19,374 --> 01:14:21,475
a single mother, only to be
shot in the head by the

823
01:14:21,476 --> 01:14:23,218
same cop that you
previously bereaved.

824
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:24,566
I don't know what you're
talking about, and surely

825
01:14:24,567 --> 01:14:25,338
you're not saying it.

826
01:14:25,339 --> 01:14:26,613
Do you know what the thing
is about the dead, Bennett?

827
01:14:26,613 --> 01:14:31,374
They have got lovers, friends,
relatives, a billion loose ends.

828
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:33,162
Let’s start at the beginning
of this debacle.

829
01:14:33,163 --> 01:14:36,618
Night flower is a pack of paranoid
anti-corporate freaks.

830
01:14:39,042 --> 01:14:42,389
You think three of their people
drowned is going to read

831
01:14:42,389 --> 01:14:43,864
as an accident?

832
01:14:43,865 --> 01:14:45,520
It was an accident.

833
01:14:45,521 --> 01:14:47,745
And the man involved in the
other incident was a Bosnian,

834
01:14:47,746 --> 01:14:50,281
who as far as the paperwork
is considered is live and well

835
01:14:50,282 --> 01:14:52,519
in London, at this
very moment.

836
01:14:52,970 --> 01:14:56,796
You can do my job, it seems
I can also do yours.

837
01:14:56,797 --> 01:14:58,899
What you're doing
is not my job.

838
01:14:59,376 --> 01:15:00,616
Isn't it?

839
01:15:00,617 --> 01:15:03,063
Look, even if the drowning
were accidental, the Night flower

840
01:15:03,064 --> 01:15:06,050
bodies were recovered by a
radiation team and disposed of.

841
01:15:06,051 --> 01:15:07,989
- By your people, not mine.
- You told my office they were

842
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:10,432
contaminated terrorists, not that
they were American citizens

843
01:15:10,433 --> 01:15:12,906
that you had contaminated.
One of them is the only child

844
01:15:12,907 --> 01:15:14,998
of a mother with
multiple sclerosis.

845
01:15:14,999 --> 01:15:17,487
When she's on TV, saying:
"The last thing I knew, they

846
01:15:17,488 --> 01:15:20,677
were breaking into North moor",
do you know what I’m saying?

847
01:15:20,678 --> 01:15:23,210
Do you understand what
you have done?

848
01:15:23,211 --> 01:15:27,328
What's worse, me doing it,
or you covering it up?

849
01:15:27,329 --> 01:15:29,840
I'm just a private individual,
a citizen, a man.

850
01:15:29,841 --> 01:15:33,306
You on the other hand
are the US government.

851
01:15:33,995 --> 01:15:36,042
What I am is the guy whose
only fuckup was letting you

852
01:15:36,043 --> 01:15:38,394
have your own
security fiefdom.

853
01:15:40,056 --> 01:15:42,233
Whatever they say,
there was never a break.

854
01:15:42,234 --> 01:15:44,198
North moor has never
had a security breach,

855
01:15:44,199 --> 01:15:45,648
North moor has never
had an accident

856
01:15:45,649 --> 01:15:49,287
and North moor does
not make weapons.

857
01:15:49,288 --> 01:15:52,326
Least of all things supposed
in certain contingencies

858
01:15:52,327 --> 01:15:56,674
best known to you to look
like jihadist dirty bombs.

859
01:15:57,590 --> 01:16:00,537
I wouldn't worry
about it more.

860
01:16:00,538 --> 01:16:05,685
"Fuck you, it's classified", still
works as far as I’m concerned.

861
01:16:11,974 --> 01:16:13,375
Are you even here,
Mr. Bennett?

862
01:16:13,376 --> 01:16:15,864
Are we even talking?
I'm at my house in Virginia.

863
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:17,907
I've got food poisoning.
Where are you?

864
01:16:17,908 --> 01:16:19,928
Oh, I'm not here.

865
01:16:21,042 --> 01:16:23,955
Is Robinson keeping
his part of the bargain?

866
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:34,435
- Mr. Robinson?
- Yes.

867
01:16:34,436 --> 01:16:37,350
- Mr. Allison Robinson Jar?
- Yes.

868
01:16:37,351 --> 01:16:40,128
Could you remove the
glasses please, Sir?

869
01:16:49,795 --> 01:16:52,670
My daughter was Emma Craven.
She wasn't killed in your

870
01:16:52,671 --> 01:16:55,343
amphibious little operation
against the corporate Satan.

871
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:58,619
She was killed later!
On my front porch!

872
01:16:58,620 --> 01:16:59,964
Come here!

873
01:17:01,058 --> 01:17:03,871
I want to know why you, with
your concerns for the planet

874
01:17:03,872 --> 01:17:05,910
and the human race stayed
silent about the drowning

875
01:17:05,911 --> 01:17:08,473
deaths of your people.
Why is that?

876
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:10,402
People with families.

877
01:17:10,403 --> 01:17:12,057
All of them had kids.

878
01:17:12,058 --> 01:17:13,953
And one of them
was my daughter.

879
01:17:15,173 --> 01:17:17,637
I'm not going to
hit you again.

880
01:17:19,365 --> 01:17:23,785
And she's not here because
of you. You son of a bitch!

881
01:17:27,796 --> 01:17:30,790
Now you got a serious
situation here Mr. Robinson.

882
01:17:32,153 --> 01:17:33,707
See they know who you
are, and you're not dead.

883
01:17:33,708 --> 01:17:36,675
You're not dead, shot,
hurt, poisoned, nothing.

884
01:17:36,676 --> 01:17:39,019
Now I figure that's
because you cut a deal.

885
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:41,021
You're going to cut
another deal with me.

886
01:17:41,854 --> 01:17:43,292
You're going to
tell me everything.

887
01:17:43,293 --> 01:17:45,144
- Come on, you scum.
- No!

888
01:18:15,344 --> 01:18:17,353
I need to know something
about the properties of the

889
01:18:17,354 --> 01:18:19,655
substance you gave
Emma Craven.

890
01:18:19,656 --> 01:18:21,811
I would rather not discuss
it in those terms.

891
01:18:21,971 --> 01:18:25,486
Is it something she could have
encountered in her work?

892
01:18:25,487 --> 01:18:28,406
Any exposure, if there were
an exposure, would be consistent

893
01:18:28,407 --> 01:18:31,938
with a documentable, procedural
failure on her part.

894
01:18:31,939 --> 01:18:34,877
Is it something that could
have remained in her effects

895
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:36,656
and been transferred to her
father without much

896
01:18:36,657 --> 01:18:38,808
collateral contamination?

897
01:18:38,808 --> 01:18:42,348
Do you mean could it have
poisoned her father as well?

898
01:18:43,289 --> 01:18:44,429
Yes.

899
01:18:46,272 --> 01:18:48,626
What, in your opinion, would
be the consequences if

900
01:18:48,627 --> 01:18:50,712
Craven opens his mouth?

901
01:18:53,845 --> 01:18:56,429
It's unserviceable.

902
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:01,911
So be it, then.

903
01:19:07,739 --> 01:19:09,853
Do you see a
soul in there?

904
01:19:09,854 --> 01:19:11,814
I beg your pardon?

905
01:19:12,368 --> 01:19:13,887
You can button
your shirt.

906
01:19:13,888 --> 01:19:15,962
You know, as we discussed
yesterday, there will be

907
01:19:15,962 --> 01:19:17,899
some erratic behaviour.

908
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:21,769
And I regret to say this probably
means you will have less time.

909
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:23,768
I know what it means.

910
01:19:26,702 --> 01:19:29,384
I've been having
aural hallucinations.

911
01:19:29,385 --> 01:19:32,493
My father's voice calling
my name as I start to sleep.

912
01:19:33,873 --> 01:19:35,834
Bastard's been dead for
forty years and suddenly

913
01:19:35,835 --> 01:19:37,542
he's yelling at me again.

914
01:19:37,896 --> 01:19:40,534
- I come awake.
- You're not sleeping?

915
01:19:40,535 --> 01:19:43,837
No, I'm not sleeping, I start
to sleep, then I jolt awake.

916
01:19:45,418 --> 01:19:49,296
There's something
about the darkness.

917
01:19:49,297 --> 01:19:52,419
- I don't like it.
- I'm not a counsellor.

918
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,904
I know you want to banter
with me. I don't do that.

919
01:19:54,905 --> 01:19:59,532
- I can only give you the facts.
- We all know what the facts are.

920
01:20:00,216 --> 01:20:04,173
We live a while, and then we
die sooner than we planned.

921
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:14,111
Standard procedure
with the Senator.

922
01:20:14,112 --> 01:20:15,867
Yeah, I get it.

923
01:20:16,586 --> 01:20:19,540
You know you didn't really
let the side stand with you.

924
01:20:19,541 --> 01:20:21,328
You got a lot of
brothers out there.

925
01:20:21,329 --> 01:20:24,043
Yeah, I know. But I
like a private funeral.

926
01:20:24,447 --> 01:20:26,890
Senator gets in his moods.
Not too good today.

927
01:20:26,891 --> 01:20:29,721
That's too bad. I was
jumping for joy.

928
01:20:34,744 --> 01:20:39,010
Are you hungry? We have
some sandwiches, a cup of tea?

929
01:20:39,755 --> 01:20:41,327
No thank you, Sir.

930
01:20:41,328 --> 01:20:45,241
Well, it's always a pleasure
to meet a combat veteran.

931
01:20:45,242 --> 01:20:49,012
You left as a master sergeant
of a heavy weapons platoon.

932
01:20:49,013 --> 01:20:49,968
Yes, Sir.

933
01:20:49,969 --> 01:20:54,678
- How did you do that at 20?
- Everybody else was dead.

934
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:59,778
Did you have trouble adjusting
when you came home?

935
01:20:59,779 --> 01:21:01,603
- No.
- Really?

936
01:21:01,604 --> 01:21:05,037
No. People talk about
trauma and so forth.

937
01:21:05,038 --> 01:21:07,990
I figure you come out of
combat the way you went in.

938
01:21:07,991 --> 01:21:09,774
I know that's not a very
kind thing to say, but

939
01:21:09,775 --> 01:21:11,654
that's my observation.

940
01:21:11,943 --> 01:21:14,263
And I know there's a lot of
big bucks in this post traumatic

941
01:21:14,264 --> 01:21:19,068
stress thing. But combat is
pretty much like anything else.

942
01:21:19,069 --> 01:21:22,111
It helps put perspective on things
when you're scared shitless.

943
01:21:22,112 --> 01:21:24,699
What is the nature of our
appointment, Detective Craven?

944
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,858
Well I was hoping that
you could tell me that.

945
01:21:26,859 --> 01:21:29,833
Why am I supposed to tell you
what you want to see me about?

946
01:21:29,834 --> 01:21:32,316
Well, because you're seeing me
in less than 48 hours after

947
01:21:32,316 --> 01:21:34,248
I talked to your attorney.

948
01:21:36,175 --> 01:21:40,534
Your daughter came to me with
allegations about North moor.

949
01:21:40,535 --> 01:21:44,117
- She sent me a letter.
- What did the letter contain?

950
01:21:44,118 --> 01:21:47,795
It touched on national security
matters that are classified.

951
01:21:49,575 --> 01:21:53,561
- What happened to the letter?
- That is also classified.

952
01:21:53,562 --> 01:21:57,762
But protocol would be to turn
it over to the committee that

953
01:21:57,763 --> 01:22:01,289
does oversight on the area your
daughters letter touched upon.

954
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:03,400
Prompting an investigation
on my daughter.

955
01:22:03,401 --> 01:22:06,115
Opening up a DARPA file on her.
Treating her like a terrorist?

956
01:22:06,116 --> 01:22:09,173
I'm not involved in
security matters.

957
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:12,492
I did write your daughter,
advising her she might be

958
01:22:12,493 --> 01:22:14,143
in breach of security.

959
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:17,727
Oh. So you didn't help her?

960
01:22:18,488 --> 01:22:21,224
I'm glad to see you, Detective.
As both a veteran and as

961
01:22:21,225 --> 01:22:23,859
a police officer of your many
years of service, but I have

962
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:26,669
to tell you that your daughter,
and we have to say this despite

963
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:31,760
her terrible accident,
was in violation of...

964
01:22:31,761 --> 01:22:34,071
almost everything of which
she could be in violation.

965
01:22:34,072 --> 01:22:37,021
- What did she allege?
- That's classified.

966
01:22:38,176 --> 01:22:40,469
You know, Detective, a very
important part of Massachusetts

967
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:42,472
economy is research and
development...

968
01:22:42,473 --> 01:22:47,191
Senator. I think you're in a
position regarding North moor,

969
01:22:47,192 --> 01:22:49,779
where you had better decide
if you're hanging on the cross

970
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:53,354
or banging in the nails.
Here.

971
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:58,435
These deaths are the result
of a conspiracy by one of your

972
01:22:58,436 --> 01:23:00,846
major campaign contributors.

973
01:23:02,023 --> 01:23:04,149
Why do you include your daughter?
Her death was an accident.

974
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:07,659
No. She was poisoned with
caesium by Mr. Bennett.

975
01:23:09,524 --> 01:23:12,153
I think I'm scaring you Senator.
There's probably not too much

976
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:15,611
upside to scaring a Senator, except
to provide some perspective.

977
01:23:15,817 --> 01:23:17,777
I'm going to go now, but I'm
going to leave you these pictures

978
01:23:17,778 --> 01:23:20,028
I want you to call everybody
involved, everybody concerned,

979
01:23:20,029 --> 01:23:22,224
and tell them I know everything
I need to know to throw a

980
01:23:22,225 --> 01:23:24,228
real box of Tarantulas
into this situation.

981
01:23:24,229 --> 01:23:25,224
- If you have info...
- Shut up!

982
01:23:25,225 --> 01:23:27,389
I'm not interested in
talking any more shit.

983
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:29,350
You investigate this
at a national level.

984
01:23:29,351 --> 01:23:31,458
You do that, maybe you'll
come out of this alright.

985
01:23:31,459 --> 01:23:32,681
I don't know.

986
01:23:33,598 --> 01:23:34,891
I don't think you knew
that the people you are

987
01:23:34,892 --> 01:23:36,332
in business with
killed my daughter.

988
01:23:37,277 --> 01:23:39,100
But now that you do know...

989
01:23:39,609 --> 01:23:41,428
what are you going
to do about it?

990
01:23:41,634 --> 01:23:43,380
Good afternoon, Senator.

991
01:25:00,321 --> 01:25:02,203
Get out of the vehicle.

992
01:25:03,908 --> 01:25:05,977
What the fuck do you
think you just did?

993
01:25:05,978 --> 01:25:07,972
You just rear-ended an
unmarked cruiser, and I

994
01:25:07,973 --> 01:25:09,858
made an observation
that you are armed.

995
01:25:09,859 --> 01:25:11,288
Through smoked glass
and our coats?

996
01:25:11,289 --> 01:25:12,907
Yeah, I'm funny
that way.

997
01:25:13,061 --> 01:25:14,965
Get out of the car, now.
Or you're going to make

998
01:25:14,966 --> 01:25:16,477
a move for something on
the inside of your jackets,

999
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:18,014
you understand me?

1000
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:20,853
Get out of the car.

1001
01:25:26,049 --> 01:25:28,301
Alright. On your knees,
hands on your heads.

1002
01:25:33,631 --> 01:25:35,311
- What have you got, Tom?
- These guys are armed.

1003
01:25:35,312 --> 01:25:37,947
They were following me.
Rear-ended my car.

1004
01:25:38,728 --> 01:25:41,830
Got some ID then?
Thanks.

1005
01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:47,672
Not in law enforcement.
Imagine that.

1006
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:49,734
What are you?

1007
01:25:50,023 --> 01:25:51,830
You don't think this is going
to get straightened out?

1008
01:25:51,831 --> 01:25:53,377
Not for a while.

1009
01:25:53,378 --> 01:25:55,663
These fuckers got
automatic weapons.

1010
01:25:56,303 --> 01:25:58,962
You just made
a serious mistake.

1011
01:26:02,644 --> 01:26:05,569
Did you shoot
my daughter?

1012
01:26:07,178 --> 01:26:11,310
I'm the supposed target of a
killer. So you here, following me

1013
01:26:11,311 --> 01:26:13,744
armed, with no credentials
in the city of Boston,

1014
01:26:13,745 --> 01:26:15,733
you're out of your
fucking mind.

1015
01:26:16,814 --> 01:26:18,786
Welcome to hell.

1016
01:26:19,586 --> 01:26:22,226
<I>A strange new twist
in the Emma Craven case,

1017
01:26:22,227 --> 01:26:24,878
<I>a suspect has been
identified as her murderer,

1018
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:27,902
<I>but new developments
today involving her father

1019
01:26:27,903 --> 01:26:30,410
<I>Two men have been arrested
in Boston. Police say

1020
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:32,936
<I>the men were taken into
custody after their car

1021
01:26:32,937 --> 01:26:35,590
<I>crashed into the back
of an unmarked police car,

1022
01:26:35,591 --> 01:26:37,936
<I>driven by Boston Police
Detective Tomas Craven,

1023
01:26:37,937 --> 01:26:39,535
<I>the father of Emma Craven.

1024
01:26:39,536 --> 01:26:42,016
<I>This all happened on
Marlinton Street...

1025
01:26:48,593 --> 01:26:51,486
- Bennett.
- We need to abort right now.

1026
01:26:51,487 --> 01:26:53,411
<I>We can't risk killing
Tom Craven yet.

1027
01:26:53,769 --> 01:26:55,248
It's too late.

1028
01:26:55,529 --> 01:26:57,378
It's already been done.

1029
01:27:19,429 --> 01:27:20,892
You want to try?

1030
01:27:27,627 --> 01:27:28,449
Hold your hair back,
your mother will

1031
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:30,523
kill me if I get it all
messed up again.

1032
01:27:30,524 --> 01:27:31,845
There you go.

1033
01:27:38,436 --> 01:27:43,552
Perfect. Now a razor. Here
you go. Don't cut yourself.

1034
01:27:43,553 --> 01:27:46,483
- Comb?
- That will work.

1035
01:27:47,450 --> 01:27:48,602
Now watch.

1036
01:28:06,604 --> 01:28:08,143
Painless.

1037
01:28:08,144 --> 01:28:11,423
Wash it off.
One more.

1038
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,453
Can I come in, Tom?

1039
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:02,378
- You alright?
- Yeah.

1040
01:29:21,549 --> 01:29:23,521
Do you remember when the
trooper out at the airport

1041
01:29:23,522 --> 01:29:27,816
busted Whitey? He got
demoted and transferred.

1042
01:29:30,286 --> 01:29:33,889
He knew what was going on.
But he couldn't prove it.

1043
01:29:33,890 --> 01:29:36,152
And nobody wanted to
know about it.

1044
01:29:36,795 --> 01:29:39,625
And finally he shot
himself, remember that?

1045
01:29:42,324 --> 01:29:44,748
I don't think you'd
shoot yourself.

1046
01:29:46,717 --> 01:29:49,102
But what's coming
is worse than that.

1047
01:29:50,722 --> 01:29:55,328
It isn't what it is, Tommy.
It is never what it is.

1048
01:29:55,329 --> 01:29:58,557
It is what it can be
made to look like.

1049
01:30:00,932 --> 01:30:03,967
There's a DA in Hampshire
County, going to charge you

1050
01:30:03,968 --> 01:30:06,675
with the death of your
daughters boyfriend.

1051
01:30:06,965 --> 01:30:10,405
He doesn't have a case.
But that doesn't matter.

1052
01:30:12,185 --> 01:30:15,688
It'll be five years of
people thinking you did it.

1053
01:30:15,689 --> 01:30:17,748
You'll go broke,
you'll lose the house.

1054
01:30:18,076 --> 01:30:19,806
And they go after
your pension.

1055
01:30:19,807 --> 01:30:23,737
If you win the case
there'll be a civil suite

1056
01:30:23,737 --> 01:30:25,446
by that point you won't
be able to afford a lawyer.

1057
01:30:25,447 --> 01:30:27,704
What are they
offering you?

1058
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:35,541
I got kids, Tommy.

1059
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:38,898
I don't.

1060
01:30:43,026 --> 01:30:45,508
But even if you did, right?

1061
01:30:48,106 --> 01:30:51,790
- Even if you did.
- Yup. Even if I did.

1062
01:31:41,483 --> 01:31:46,349
You know, Bill. No one
expects you to be perfect.

1063
01:31:47,705 --> 01:31:50,963
But there's a few basic
things you got to get right.

1064
01:31:53,272 --> 01:31:55,814
Always do the best you
can by your family,

1065
01:31:55,815 --> 01:31:58,835
go to work every day,
always speak your mind.

1066
01:31:58,836 --> 01:32:01,488
Never hurt anyone that
doesn't deserve it.

1067
01:32:02,778 --> 01:32:05,209
Never take anything
from the bad guys.

1068
01:32:06,841 --> 01:32:10,576
It's all. It's not
much to ask.

1069
01:32:21,455 --> 01:32:22,804
Hello, Craven.

1070
01:34:19,559 --> 01:34:20,807
I need your car.

1071
01:34:59,004 --> 01:35:00,465
Not yet.

1072
01:35:21,487 --> 01:35:22,735
Go ahead.

1073
01:35:25,111 --> 01:35:26,360
Hold on.

1074
01:35:29,571 --> 01:35:30,819
I'll call you back.

1075
01:35:40,318 --> 01:35:41,566
Derek?

1076
01:35:41,854 --> 01:35:43,102
Derek?

1077
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:50,078
Shit.

1078
01:35:51,689 --> 01:35:53,266
You're all fucked
up, Craven.

1079
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:55,160
You're all done.

1080
01:35:55,419 --> 01:35:56,824
Sit down.

1081
01:35:56,825 --> 01:35:58,587
Lie down.

1082
01:35:58,588 --> 01:35:59,836
Be dead.

1083
01:36:02,970 --> 01:36:04,164
Fuck.

1084
01:36:05,917 --> 01:36:08,186
- Say "Craven".
- Fuck you.

1085
01:36:09,379 --> 01:36:12,896
- You fuck.
- "Craven". Say it.

1086
01:36:13,549 --> 01:36:15,179
- Craven.
- Louder!

1087
01:36:15,564 --> 01:36:16,813
- Craven!
- LOUDER!

1088
01:36:17,095 --> 01:36:18,350
CRAVEN!

1089
01:36:36,526 --> 01:36:38,167
I'm sorry you had
to see that, honey.

1090
01:37:43,101 --> 01:37:45,563
Deep down...

1091
01:37:46,298 --> 01:37:48,838
You know you
deserve this.

1092
01:38:19,431 --> 01:38:21,561
We've got a cop of almost
30 years spotless service

1093
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:23,717
and there's not one person,
on our side, who can explain

1094
01:38:23,717 --> 01:38:26,851
his instability without lying,
who has executed the director

1095
01:38:26,852 --> 01:38:30,146
of a nuclear research facility
where his daughter worked.

1096
01:38:31,255 --> 01:38:34,154
Okay. Ideas?

1097
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:42,869
Your scenario is this.

1098
01:38:43,163 --> 01:38:46,501
He was accidently
poisoned by his daughter.

1099
01:38:49,559 --> 01:38:52,365
- But he blamed Bennett.
- How do we know that?

1100
01:38:52,366 --> 01:38:56,779
Testimony of an altercation at
North moor when he was there.

1101
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:58,413
Testimony from the Senator.

1102
01:38:58,414 --> 01:39:01,665
I can easily testify that he was
unstable. He came to my house.

1103
01:39:01,666 --> 01:39:05,970
That's right. He made wild
allegations. He was armed.

1104
01:39:05,971 --> 01:39:08,324
You know, you were
very lucky to live.

1105
01:39:08,325 --> 01:39:10,000
That's true.
That's very true.

1106
01:39:10,001 --> 01:39:12,710
Now the real story
here gentlemen, is:

1107
01:39:12,711 --> 01:39:16,359
"United States Senator
escapes assassination."

1108
01:39:16,359 --> 01:39:18,013
- That's right.
- That's the lead story.

1109
01:39:18,014 --> 01:39:19,656
That will wipe the rest of
it right out of the media.

1110
01:39:19,657 --> 01:39:21,851
Anyone who looks
at the rest of this

1111
01:39:21,852 --> 01:39:24,374
is going to see that
something happened.

1112
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:26,782
But no one is going to be
able to figure it out.

1113
01:39:26,783 --> 01:39:28,345
That's your objective.

1114
01:39:28,346 --> 01:39:32,304
To make it so convoluted that
anyone can have a theory.

1115
01:39:32,305 --> 01:39:35,721
- But no one’s got the facts.
- That's quite good, Jed burgh.

1116
01:39:35,722 --> 01:39:39,787
Senator, I've been making things
unintelligible for 30 years.

1117
01:39:40,219 --> 01:39:44,044
And by the way, its
Captain Jed burgh to you.

1118
01:39:44,525 --> 01:39:47,330
Captain. Of what?

1119
01:39:49,906 --> 01:39:51,822
Very little he can
tell you about.

1120
01:39:54,605 --> 01:39:57,814
Right. Well. Seems we
have a good starting point.

1121
01:39:57,815 --> 01:39:59,972
What's the prognosis
on Craven?

1122
01:39:59,973 --> 01:40:04,057
- Well, you know he's terminal.
- We're all terminal, Milroy.

1123
01:40:04,058 --> 01:40:06,055
Even middle management.

1124
01:40:06,056 --> 01:40:07,791
But how fast is
he being terminal?

1125
01:40:07,792 --> 01:40:11,041
- He's incapable of speech.
- Thank God for that.

1126
01:40:16,914 --> 01:40:19,273
I understand you had a chance
to terminate Detective Craven

1127
01:40:19,274 --> 01:40:20,982
and did not do so.

1128
01:40:21,252 --> 01:40:26,440
You come to me. I look
at things. I decide.

1129
01:40:26,441 --> 01:40:29,692
Jed burgh, we've got to get
the Senator out to the press.

1130
01:40:32,436 --> 01:40:34,792
I've decided what
this country is.

1131
01:40:35,567 --> 01:40:36,608
What?

1132
01:40:37,763 --> 01:40:40,947
People, who
deserve better.

1133
01:40:42,008 --> 01:40:45,198
We all appreciate Captain Jed burgh.
Yet we would have not got

1134
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:48,368
to this extremity had he done what
the situation clearly dictated.

1135
01:40:48,369 --> 01:40:51,451
Senator, I don’t think you
really understand what side

1136
01:40:51,452 --> 01:40:53,588
of this situation you're on.

1137
01:40:59,447 --> 01:41:01,756
Well, I think we've had
a successful meeting...

1138
01:41:08,732 --> 01:41:10,509
I...

1139
01:41:10,510 --> 01:41:13,543
am a United
States Senator.

1140
01:41:14,163 --> 01:41:15,479
By what standards?

1141
01:41:28,613 --> 01:41:31,823
- You got a family?
- Yeah.

1142
01:41:32,196 --> 01:41:34,465
- Kids?
- Yeah.
