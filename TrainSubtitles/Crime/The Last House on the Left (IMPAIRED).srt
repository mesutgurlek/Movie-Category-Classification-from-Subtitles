790
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:17,789
that would be up to you...

we have a perfectly good guest room.

And, well, there's
Mari's room, I suppose.

Are you sure we're not gonna
put you folks to any trouble?

796

Nonsense! Our home is yours.
Let me get your bags.

No, no, no! Frank here is younger.
He can handle it.

I'll put some towels in the bathroom for
you, and you can wash up if you like.

- Thank you.
- That's marvelous.

Okay, well, we'll be in the living room,
and you can join us if you like.

up your ass sideways?

How did I do that?

01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:37,604
- Shall I just give it a little yank?
- No!

956
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:40,566
No, no, don't do that!
Just ease it down.

957
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:42,359
Nice and easy.

She was a lot tougher
than you were, Doc.

Come on now, Doc.
You can do better than that.

1008
01:16:36,468 --> 01:16:38,178
Just a couple of more, Doc.
