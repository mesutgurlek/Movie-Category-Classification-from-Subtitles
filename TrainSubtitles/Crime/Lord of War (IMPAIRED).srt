My name is Yuri Orlov.

43
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,278
When I was a boy,
my family came to America.

44

But not all the way.

45
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,557
Like most Ukrainians,
we congregated in Brighton Beach.

It reminded us of the Black Sea.

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,112
I soon realised we'd just
swapped one hell for another.

Even in hell, an angel
sometimes makes an appearance.

I'd worshipped Ava Fontaine
since I was ten years old.

she had a point.

For the first 20-odd years of my life,

53
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,875
Little Odessa was to me
what it is to the Q train:

Oh, I did lie about my name.
It's not really Yuri Orlov.

56

There've been few occasions
in the 20th century

57
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,233
when it's been an advantage
to be a Jew, but in the '70s,

58
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,989
to escape the Soviet Union,
our family pretended to be Jewish.

That's true,

better than doin' this.

[man] Sir, sir,

161
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,628
may I interest you in the shoulder-fired
SA-7 surface-to-air missiles?

162
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,389
The older model, not so effective
against modern military aircraft

163
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,755
but deadly if used against a commercial
airliner. I'm giving them away at 850.

164
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,793
It was the '80s,
and the Cold War was far from thawed.

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,389
Most deals
were government-to-government.

166
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,036
It was a mostly private club,
with a lifetime club president.

I have a business proposal.
Perhaps we could discuss it.

I don't think you and l
are in the same business. [laughs]

178
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,636
You think I just sell guns, don't you?

179
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,319
I don't. I take sides.

180
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,910
But in the lran/lraq war,
you sold guns to both sides.

181
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,671
Did you ever consider
that I wanted both sides to lose?

182
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,555
Bullets change governments
far surer than votes.

The only option for Vitaly and me
was under-the-counter gunrunning.

I got my first break in Lebanon,

When the United States
leaves a war zone,

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,913
they generally don't take
their munitions.

199
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,430
It costs more to bring it back
than to buy new stock.

200
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,232
[Yuri] So.

201
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,793
We sell by the kilo.

202
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,958
They're second-hand weapons,
but they're still OK.

- How many kilos would you like?
- 5,000.

I had a flair for languages,

205

but I soon discovered
that what talks best

206
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,198
is dollars, dinars, drachmas, roubles,
rupees and pounds fuckin' sterling.

Of course, the US Army

Army salaries were no better
in the '80s than they are today.

Some of the brass,
like Lieutenant Colonel Southern,

210

you make calls,
pound the pavement, take orders.

221

I was an equal-opportunity

I supplied every army
but the Salvation Army.

It's the triple and quadruple lives
that'll get you.

Back then I carried a French, British,
Israeli and Ukrainian passport,

237
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,756
and a student visa for the US,
but that's another story.

238
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,839
I also packed six different briefcases
depending on who I was that day

239

and the region of the world
I was visiting.

240
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,672
Without operations like mine,

241
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,192
it would be impossible for certain
countries to conduct a respectable war.

242
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,359
I was able to navigate around those
inconvenient little arms embargoes.

243
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,676
There are three
basic types of arms deal:

244
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,189
white, being legal;
black, being illegal;

245
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,119
and my personal
favourite colour, grey.

246
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,629
Sometimes I made
the deal so convoluted

247
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,593
it was hard for me to work out
if they were on the level.

To fool authorities,
I often spoke in code.

Rocket-launchers were "mothers",
rockets "children",

Hallelujah to you too. All right.

255
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,315
The point is, if I've done my job right,
an arms embargo should be

256
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,432
- practically impossible to enforce.

what's in a name?

You got a shorter name?

273
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,278
I'd often changed the registration
of a ship or plane,

- Faster, or I'll send your arse in!
- Yuri, I don't have Dutch!

registered in the fucking Netherlands.

Turn it sideways, it's Dutch.

That's why you're my brother.

but not every man gets it.

Interpol agent Jack Valentine
couldn't be bought,

288
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,392
at least not with money.

289
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,160
For Jack, glory was the prize.

290
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,590
Yeah, it's the Kono,
it's not the Kristol.

291

293
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,429
I'm gonna go aboard.

Phone in a sighting
of the Kristol south of Aruba.

295
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,640
Even when I was up
against an overzealous agent,

296
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,071
I had a number of methods
for discouraging a search.

297
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,795
I routinely mislabelled
my arms shipments "farm machinery",

298
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,434
and I've yet to meet
the customs official

299
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,757
who will open a container
marked "radioactive waste"

300
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,916
to verify its contents.

301
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,669
But my favourite is the unique
combination of week-old potatoes

302
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,075
and tropical heat.

303
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,720
It smells.

304

Sir, a sighting of the Kristol,
due north.

305
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,633
Most importantly, I kept a number
of intelligence people on the payroll

306
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,991
to supply their colleagues
with counter-intelligence.

307

The second rule of gunrunning is,

309
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,518
always ensure you have
a foolproof way to get paid,

310
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,315
preferably in advance,
ideally to an off-shore account.

311
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,670
That's why I chose customers carefully.

312
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,394
Say what you like
about warlords and dictators,

313
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,034
they have a highly developed
sense of order.

314
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,151
They always pay their bills on time.

[Yuri] Shit.

321
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,318
The first and most
important rule of gunrunning

322
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,239
is never get shot
with your own merchandise.

323

You OK?

324
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,151
[sighs] I think so.

That narco-guerrilla
had his facts right.

330
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,999
After shipping it stateside,
the return netted me a healthy profit.

331
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,749
It would've been even better,
except one kilo never made it back.

Vitaly? Vit?

To this day, I don't know
what Vitaly was running away from.

334
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,914
Maybe just from Vitaly.

335
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,999
I found him 12 days,
2000 miles and 1 50 grams later

[Yuri exhales deeply]
Get out of the car.

354
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,031
Vitaly, I need you
to get out of the car.

355
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,196
I promised our parents.

- Please.
- You're gonna have a great time.

357

It's a top place. Two Ford Models
checked in last week,

358
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,520
that cute weathergirl's
been here since July...

359
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,915
Please.

360
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,076
Please, Yuri.

361
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,671
You're a good brother.

362
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,394
- You're a good brother, Yuri.
- OK. All right.

363
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,160
- Good brother.
- All right, get out of the car.

364
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,591
OK. Get out of the car.

365
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,074
From then on,
I was a one-man operation.

366
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,478
I never understood what separated the
recreation drug-user from the habitual,

367
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,035
but, for the grace of God,
it could have been me

368
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,595
snorting lines
as long as the Belt Parkway.

369
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,509
However, I wasn't entirely free
of the grip of addiction myself.

370
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,678
There she was again,
Ava Fontaine.

371
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,633
In my neighbourhood,
they say the good get out.

You can't force someone to fall in love
with you, but you can improve your odds.

375
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,872
It cost me 20 grand to book her
for a fake photo-shoot,

376
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,958
another 12 to buy out the hotel.

377
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,517
It's a popular hotel, huh?

378
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,556
- Ava Fontaine.
- Yuri Orlov.

- What brings you to St Barts?
- Photo-shoot.

380
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,313
At least that was the plan. Guess
the photographer got stuck in Miami.

Those things can come out of nowhere.

383

So the job's been cancelled, and
there's no flight back until Tuesday.

In my experience,

387
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,076
some of the most successful
relationships are based on lies.

388
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,909
Since that's where they usually end up,
it's a logical place to start.

Right there, right there.
Hold it. Oh, my God.

convincing her I was anything but.

seduced by a ride in a private jet,

392

unless you owned the jet.

There's nothing better
for an arms dealer

Those 45 years of mutual hatred
between the East and the West

The Soviets had guns
coming out of the demon hole.

Huge stockpiles,

Dmitri.

616
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,796
The end user certificate for this
aircraft states "Burkina Fasou".

617
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,560
Nice. Very nice.
Did you type this up yourself?

618
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,194
The helicopter's
for humanitarian missions.

619
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,153
- Oh, so you're a humanitarian?
- Oh, absolutely.

620
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,636
- [scoffs] This is a military aircraft.
- Not any more.

621
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,068
Listen to the nephew.

622
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,159
What can they do with military hardware
but convert it to civilian use?

623
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,319
The only way you could die from this
baby now is if a food drop hits you.

624
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,799
And this stuff?
Is that going to Burkina Faso as well?

625
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,355
To a different client
at a different address.

626
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,109
It's just a coincidence? Do you
take me for a complete fucking fool?

627
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,676
Not complete, sir. And while
I hesitate to tell you your job,

628
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,269
I must point out
that when shipped separately,

629
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,473
the weapons and the aircraft both
comply with lnterpol trade standards.

630
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,558
We both know
that is an obscene bureaucratic loophole

631
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,910
that's gonna be closed
any goddamned day.

632
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,712
But it's not closed.

633
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,912
And while some might
interpret this cargo as suspicious,

634
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,669
we live in a world where suspicion alone
does not constitute a crime,

635
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,394
and where men like you
respect the rule of law.

636

[sighs]

637
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,073
I was as guilty as sin,
but Valentine couldn't prove it.

638
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,033
He was the rarest breed
of law-enforcement officer:

639
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,798
he knew I was breaking the law,

640
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,833
but wouldn't break it
himself to bust me.

641
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,038
He wasn't the only one
trying to put me out of business.

642
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,629
My uncle had turned down
rival arms dealers,

643
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,796
sometimes with better offers,

644
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,788

you couldn't put a price on loyalty.

- Hoping to beat your offer.

647
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,875
I told him to go
have intercourse with himself.

- But Yuri...
- You need to make more pay-offs.

- Too many know.
- Don't worry.

650
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,110
There are more VCRs, cigarettes.
I left them in your new car.

651
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,756
Even your enemy
was admiring that car.

Hi, baby.

How was that... Your audition?

658

They're going in another direction.
The direction of someone who can act.

659
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,793
They don't deserve you.

660
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,513
Where are you?
Is everything OK?

661
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,871
- It was a rough day at the office.
- Come home.

662
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:12,108
- Soon. How's Nicki?
- He misses you. We both do.

663
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,392
It's lonely without you here.

664

00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,919
I'd better go. I just wanted to call

The pillaging didn't die with my uncle.

670
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,159
After the Wall came down,

671
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,309
32 billion dollars' worth of arms were
stolen and resold from Ukraine alone.

672
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,035
One of the greatest heists
of the 20th century.

[distant voice]

674
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,676
The primary market was Africa.

675
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,475
1 1 major conflicts involving
32 countries in less than a decade.

A gunrunner's wet dream.

At the time,
the West couldn't care less.

678
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,833
They had a white war
in what was left of Yugoslavia.

679
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,919
I did the bulk of my business
in Liberia, "Land of the Free".

680
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,271
Established as a homeland
for freed American slaves,

681
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,711
it's been enslaved by one dictator
or another ever since.

682
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,392
The latest was American-educated,
self-declared president Andre Baptiste.

Thank him.
Unfortunately I have other business.

It's a shame.
It's...It's a very busy schedule.

00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,750
optional.

694
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,838
My father is easily offended.

695
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,796
My schedule just freed up.

696
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,794
President Baptiste was my best customer,
but I was in no hurry to meet him.

697
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,437
He's gotten a reputation for hacking off
the limbs of those who opposed him.

698
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,108
His seven-year civil war
has been described as

699
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,551
"a relentless campaign
of sadistic, wanton violence. "

700
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,354
That kind of sums up Andy for me.

701
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,676
The Glock is interesting.

702
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,558
It's made of a polymer composite.

703
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,912
Many feel they can get through airport
security without setting off bells.

I do not recommend that.

705
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,033
On the other hand, if you are looking
for a traditional wheel gun,

706
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,279
there's no substitute for the six inches
of muzzle energy of the.357 Magnum.

707
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,436
And, of course, it will never jam.

- What did you say?

709

Now you're gonna have to buy it.
It's a used gun.

That's a good one.

with the youth today.
