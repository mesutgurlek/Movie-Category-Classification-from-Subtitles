00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,980
But instead,
he's turned on by it.

160
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,100
He likes the balls of it.

161
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,100
"Stick around," he says.

162
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,260
Couple hours later, we're doing it
in his Beemer, his hotel suite.

163
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,860
He keeps one, creep.

164

What happened to Chuck?

We're fighting more
than we're fucking.

166
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,700
Anyway, I get back to Philly,
our online stuff gets pretty hot.

167
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,020
He misses me.

168
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,100
I mean, he practically
begs me to move here.

169
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,180
So I check out apartments
and agencies,

170
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,740
and I wanna tell him,
you know, I'm really excited.

171
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,740
But suddenly,
I can't get ahold of him.

172
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,100
I mean, I sent him a million
e-mails and he just cuts me off.

what I can do to him.

It always comes
back to haunt you.

182
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,020
I wonder what Hill would think
if David Shane threatened to
publish a few of his e-mails?

183
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,140
I'm sure the wife would
find them interesting.

184

"Yeah, Ro.
Don't blueball the guy."

You are officially in the way

It's Hill.
We can prove it now.

771
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,820
Do not send any more e-mails
on my behalf. And do not speak
for me in any way.

Pretty busy for the end of the day.
Yeah.

Nope.

00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,380
Not unless data entry
turns you on.

878
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,940
You know what?
Surprisingly, it doesn't.

879
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,580
But seriously,
how you doing?

880
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,740
Let me tell you about my night.

881
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,180
I have to go to dinner at Sapa.
Average jokes, exceptional food.

00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,900

yourself bored

883
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:42,820
in the area of 24th and Sixth
around 10:00,

884
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,580
you could fall by
for a drink.

885
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,820
I really appreciate that offer,
but I think I'm gonna have to pass.

886
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,660
Okay.

887
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,660
Is there something else
I can do for you, or--?

888
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,180
No.

889
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,660
I'm just waiting for you
to change your mind.

890
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,140
Look, Mr. Hill--

891
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,780
I recognize that tone.
Sounds serious.

892
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,660
I really like working here.

893
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:19,100
And I would really like for
my work to speak for itself.

894
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,740
Fair enough.

895
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,620
Have a splendid evening,
Miss Pogue.

896
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,700
Wait. Mr. Hill?

897
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,780
Mm-hm.

898
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,580
In case I change my mind...

899
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,620
keep an eye out around dessert.

900
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,900
Hey, how you guys doing?

901
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:49,420
Miles.
Bill Patel, Rowena Price.

902
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,340
Hey. A pleasure.
You can lose the glasses, Bill.

903
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,380
This isn't Deep Throat.

904
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,100
Here's your pia colada,
hold the umbrella.

905
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,500
ROWENA:
We know about the drowning,
Bill, but what was this poison?

906
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:01,900
Belladonna.

907
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,500
What's that?

908
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,420
Highly toxic plant that's used
to make atropine.

909
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,820
You know what that is, right?

910
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,620
Well, yeah. Atropine
is used to dilate eyes.

911
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,740
And for anesthesia, and in cardiac
medicine as a resuscitant,

912
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,660
and witchcraft.

913
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,820
Coroner had cause of death
listed as atropine poisoning,

914
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,900
but I did a further test on the bile
and found it was belladonna.

915
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,220
Which means what?

916
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,580
It's not the expensive synthetic type,
so it's more readily available,

917
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,100
harder to narrow down
where it came from.

918
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,540
Where do you get it?

919
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:38,980
Well, you don't pop into Duane Reade
and order a vial, but it's accessible.

920
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,140
Easy enough to find
if you know where to look.

921
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,540
Besides, nowadays, you can
pretty much get anything online.

922
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,380
MILES:

Well, I heard my voice

coming from your computer.

That's what I'm doing.

Oh, it's a joke, huh?

Huh? Huh?

You know what,
I'll tell you what's funny.

1396
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,140
What's funny is the fact that
you said you hadn't seen Grace,

1397
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:40,140
but yet you got pictures of her

took all these pictures.

You were ADEX.

1406

Yeah, that's what I thought.

1407
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:23,300
You've been manipulating
this whole thing, haven't you?

1408
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,860
Lying to me. Fucking Grace.

that I had something
to do with that?

1413
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:44,860
Why wouldn't I? You can't keep
changing your identity, Miles,

01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,860
and expect people to trust you.

No. Fuck you.

1417

I've been working my ass off
on this for you the whole time.

Everybody has secrets, Ro.
Right. Everybody's got secrets, huh?

1419
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:59,820
Until they get caught.

1420
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:04,900
Let's see.
Take a fucking look at something.

1421
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:09,380
You told me to take
the virtual tour of H2A.

1422
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:10,580
When you do,

1423
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:13,660
when you click on the photographs
hanging in the reception area,

1424
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:15,780
it links you
to Mia Hill's webpage.

1425
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:18,260
She took photographs
of dilated eyes, Ro.

1426
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:20,660
They're eyes. Look.
"Mia Rheinhart Hill replicates

Are you okay, honey?
Are you okay?

1537
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:08,660
Mommy,
he's coming.

1538
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:13,020
I said, get out. Get out.

1539
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:17,860
MILES: She was
blackmailing you, wasn't she?

1540
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:20,340
That's why you did her all
those favors all those years,

1541
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:23,020
even after she slept
with your boyfriend.

1542
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:27,140
You just couldn't
say no, could you?

1543
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:31,860
What was it? What did
Grace know about you?

1544
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:40,940
MOTHER:
We're just gonna tell
people he disappeared.

1545
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:43,180
Like last August.

1546
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:44,980
He just never came home.

1547
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:48,740
He just went away
and he never came home.

1548
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:51,220
You got that?

1549
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:53,460
Rowena, look at me.

1550
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,020
You got that?

1551

MILES:
<i>God, you must have hated her.</i>

1552
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:05,540
I hated her.
I hated her for you.

1553
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:07,820
I still do.

1554
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:08,980
Rowena.
Grace.

MILES: <i>But she just kept coming back.</i>
You can't just forget people.

Bury them and pretend
like they never existed?

1557
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:18,260
And then she handed
you Hill that night.

1558
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:20,300
She fucking
handed him to you.

1559
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:21,540
Regards to your mother.

1560
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:28,340
At some point, you must
have thought, "This has to end.

1561
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:29,900
This all has to end."

1562
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:34,900
<i>So you did a little research.</i>
<i>You took the virtual tour.</i>

1563
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:37,740
<i>That's how you found out</i>
<i>about the belladonna.</i>

1564
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:39,940
That's how you knew
you could pin it on Hill.

1565
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:44,020
And then that's how
I knew it was you.

1566
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:46,860
You remember that night
at my apartment?

1567
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:48,940
<i>When I was looking for</i>
<i>Mia Hill's webpage,</i>

1568
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:51,700

01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:53,500
<i>Didn't register for me at the time.</i>

1570

1571
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:00,980
<i>You led me right to him.</i>
Belladonna is used to dilate eyes.

1572
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:04,260
Are those planets?
No, eyes.

1573
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:07,380
Mrs. Hill did a whole series:
"Inside the Dilated Eye."

And then, all you needed
was the belladonna.

1576
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:16,180
And I-- And I
remembered your mother

1577
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:21,020
and that pathetic little
pharmacy they have there...

1578
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:25,140
and how you always used to
complain how understaffed they were.

<i>"show me everything you've got."</i>

01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:38,380
<i>You laced her drink good enough</i>

1583
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:39,740
<i>You took some blood.</i>

1584

<i>You placed the belladonna</i>
<i>in her eyes</i>

to implicate Hill
or his wife.

01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:48,180
And then,

1587
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:53,740
all you needed to do was connect
Hill with the physical evidence.

1588
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:56,660
<i>You had the blood.</i>
<i>You had the fibers.</i>

So you waited all these years

That's fucking beautiful.

That's poetic.
