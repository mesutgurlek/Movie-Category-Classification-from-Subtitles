He set his genitals on fire.

328

who set herself on fire once.

Not on purpose, though.
She was wearing this long lace dress

331
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,083
and she got it caught in the furnace.

332
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,447
She died
before they could put the fire out.

in the family I look the most like.

- Why?
- I was just curious.

354
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,366
My momma tried to kill me
when I was real little.

355
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,646
She put a pillow over my face,

356
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,371
because she cared more about herself
than her little baby.

357

She didn't love me like a momma
should love a little baby.

358
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,081
And she was happy,
because she thought she'd done it.

359
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,447
And then I couldn't grow into
something better than she'd been.

She didn't send me back to Him.

- It's pretty simple.

- No exceptions.
- Sir, let me explain.

One of the reasons
we're interested in having this done

418
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,682
is my mother holds
a very large insurance policy.

They usually do.

420

if we can guarantee payment

- I won't tell Daddy.

what you're talking about.

I never told nobody.

495

His name was Marshall. He was fat.

496
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,886
He loved me.

497
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,200
You need to go out more often.

498
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,442
Nobody ever knew
we were going together.

499
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,002
We didn't see each other at recess,
we didn't sit together at lunch.

500
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,845
We never wrote notes and he didn't
walk me home from school.

501
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,684
When would you see him?

502
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,921
In class, at school.

503
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,081
I mean, alone.

504
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,764
We didn't see each other alone.

505
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,571
- Ever?
- That would have spoiled the secret.

506
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,081
How'd you know
you were going together,

507
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,049
if you never spent any time alone?

508
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,566
We just knew. If we talked about it,

509
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,688
it wouldn't have been what it was,
which was true.

What was true?

511
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,925
Love. We loved each other.

512
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,725
How do you know he loved you,
if y'all never talked about it'?

513
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,450
Because he loved me with pure love.

You can't tell Joe
we're going to Peru, okay'?
