with the syndicate...

331
00:27:20,898 --> 00:27:22,832

in the big time.

332
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,368
Back for good.
He was very excited.

333
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,927
Well, you tell him
that Porter is back, too...

334

Yeah. l met up with him
once a few years ago.

He can't use
Star Service anymore...

549
00:38:21,077 --> 00:38:23,045
because he beats up
all the girls...

You quit looking
after me, remember?

he won't like.

and they grab you...

found out about the hotel?

00:44:39,387 --> 00:44:42,322

to kill you?

Yes.

00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,722
And you say
that he's alone...

a professional robber...

is that correct?

673

Yes, sir. He does

That's why this man
has come to town, huh?

The $130,000
that you paid us back?

Yes, sir, but only
70,000 of it was his.

686

Well, we never asked you
where you got the money.

687

lt's none of

to the organization,

693

You're a sadist.

You lack compunction.
That comes in handy.

of your personal life
to become a danger to us.

and self-reliant.

Excuse me for saying so,
Mr. Carter...

711
00:47:05,432 --> 00:47:08,333

if Resnick just disappeared.

about Resnick.

Porter.
