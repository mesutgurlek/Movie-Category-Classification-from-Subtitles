00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:59,420
[SEAN] No, I haven't seen him since we
were kids. Once in a while, I run into him.

311
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,250
[MAN]
Sure looked cute, though, didn't he?

312
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,380
[GIRL] Daddy, Daddy!
[JIMMY] Hey, darling. Good day, huh?

313
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,090
[GIRL]
This dress itches.

314
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,930
Yeah, I'm not even wearing it,
and it's itching me.

315
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,430
We are so proud of you.

316
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,390
[Sirens Wailing]

317
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,790
- Morning, honey.
- Dave.

318
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:40,120
There's nothing about it in the papers.
I checked three times.

319
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,460
It was late, real late.

320
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,840
- Morning, Mikey.
[MIKE] Morning, Dad.

321
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,640
- You up for hitting some Wiffle Balls?
- Yeah, come on, let's go.

322
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,970
Come on.

323
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,980
Put your coat on, Mike.

324
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,270
[MIKE]
Thanks, Mom.

325
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,730
[Sirens Wailing In Distance]

326
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,580
[Chattering]

327
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,950
- Hey, Jimmy.
- What's up, Ed?

328
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,830
They got Sydney blocked off,
Crescent to Dunboy.

329
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,210
Boo Bear Durkin saw frogmen going
into the Pen. Why you all decked out?

330
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,170
- Nadine's First Communion.
- What are you doing here?

331
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,880
Just curious, I guess.

332
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:48,490
That's my daughter's car.

333
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,070
The dog's sniffing
something by the old bear cage.

334
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,990
- Want to take a walk over?
[SEAN] Yeah.

335
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,330
[MAN] Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, go ahead.

336
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,830
We got a guy on Sydney
says he's the father.

337
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,460
Oh, shit.

338
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,170
- Got a psychologist on the scene yet?
- En route.

339
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,210
Just keep him calm
till the shrink gets here.

340
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,880
Asking for you. Says he knows you.
Not taking no for an answer.

341
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,800
And he's got some guys with him.

342
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,260
- What guys?
- Crazy-looking guys.

343
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,940
- The Savage brothers.
- Just a "hi" around the neighborhood?

344
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,940
All right, I'm on my way.

345
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,400
[OFFICER] Hey, guys.
[MAN 1] That's our niece in there.

346
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,240
[MAN 2] Let us in.
[OFFICER] We're doing our job.

347
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,700
[MAN 1] Let us in.
[MAN 2] Fuck you!

348
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,580
The doughnut shop's that way!

349
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,540
- Nick, Val, ease up.
- Fucking dickhead.

350
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,750
- Enough.
- Nick.

351
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,090
Go to Drew Pigeon's house, talk to his
daughter. Katie was with them last night.

352
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,840
- Kevin, let's go.
- And, guys?

353
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,630
These girls are friends,
so don't be hard on them.

354
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,930
- But get answers.
- You got it.

355
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,310
[WOMAN]
Yeah, that's what I believe. Yeah.

356
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,480
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, man.

357
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,270
- Is she in there?
[SEAN] All we're doing is looking.

358
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,070
- Quit blowing sunshine up his ass.
- That's my daughter's car.

359
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,320
- I understand.
- And it's got blood in it.

360
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:19,790
You got fucking dogs all over. Why do you
got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?

361
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,620
Because we're looking, Jimmy, okay?
Right now all she is is missing, okay?

362
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,040
[MAN] Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, say again.

363
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,170
Sergeant Powers says you need
to get in here ASAP.

364
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,130
- Your location?
- The old bear cage. It's a fucking mess.

365
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,140
All right.

366
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,310
Make sure he doesn't get through.

367
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,930
You got those bolt cutters in your car?

368
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,060
I'll get us right through
that Sydney Street fence.

369
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,020
[JIMMY]
Go.

370
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,910
There's a massive search underway
for a woman missing in Buckingham Flats.

371
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,740
All we know now
is there are signs of foul play...

372
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,830
...in a car found abandoned
outside of Pen Park.

373
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,330
Now, police officers have moved in
quickly and cordoned off the area...

374
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,840
...but even as we speak,
a crowd of spectators has gathered.

375
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,300
We don't know more than that,
but we will stay on the story.

376
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:17,850
Until later, this is Jim Smith
reporting for WB 56, 10:00 news.

377
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,720
[DAVE]
Ready? Bat back.

378
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,600
All the way back.

379
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,330
I never saw anything like that before.

380
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,870
What do we got?

381
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,550
Oh, Christ.

382
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,530
[WHITEY]
Is that her?

383
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,780
Yeah.

384
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,040
We'll have the father
do a positive ID at the morgue.

385
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,620
Blood's from a split
in the crown of her head.

386
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,670
She was beaten with a stick,
but that didn't kill her.

387
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,260
She was shot a second time.
Looks like a.38.

388
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,930
What the fuck am I gonna tell him?

389
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,140
"Hey, Jimmy...

390
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,310
...God said you owed another marker.
He came to collect."

391
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,440
[OFFICER 1] Hey.
[OFFICER 2] Hold on!

392
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,900
[OFFICER 3] Grab him. Stop that guy.
[OFFICER 4] Hey, you!

393
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,320
[VAL] I'm fucking going in there!
[OFFICER 5] Take it easy!

394
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,820
[OFFICER 6] Get his arms.
[OFFICER 7] Hold him. Come on.

395
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,320
[VAL] Let me in, you motherfuckers!
[OFFICER 8] Take it easy.

396
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:05,410
[VAL] Let me in!
[JIMMY] Is she in there?!

397
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,460
- Sean, is my daughter in there?!
- Let me in! You motherfuckers!

398
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:14,130
[JIMMY] Is my daughter in there?!
Is she in there?! Is she in there?!

399
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,510
Hey, take it easy! That's the father.

400
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,140
Is my daughter in there?! Motherfuckers!

401
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,310
Is that my daughter in there?!

402
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,640
Look into my eyes! Is she in there?!

403
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:31,360
[VAL] Get off me!
- Sean, is that my daughter in there?!

404
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,320
Is that my daughter in there?

405
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,860
No! No!

406
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,620
[Yelling]

407
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,160
Oh, no!

408
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,830
No, God!

409
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,420
Oh, God, no!

410
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,880
No one's said anything, right?

411
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,720
What do you mean?

412
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,430
You haven't seen her yet, right?
It might not be her, right?

413
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,560
Jimmy?

414
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,350
- Jimmy, please...
- Please what?

415
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,230
- Please...
- Please what, baby? Please what?

416
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,270
[Sobbing]

417
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,850
Yeah, that's her.

418
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,400
That's Katie.

419
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,990
That's my daughter.

420
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:02,090
Fresh-brewed.

421
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,720
So we need to work a time line.

422
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,220
It's details, little things
that make a case.

423
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:11,140
You know, things that you could
forget about after a day or two.

424
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,070
Did you ever think about how one little
choice could change a whole life?

425
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,150
I heard Hitler's mother
wanted to abort him.

426
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,410
At the last minute,
she changed her mind.

427
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,780
See what I mean?

428
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,500
What do you mean, Jimmy?

429
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,170
What if you or I had gotten
into that car instead of Dave Boyle?

430
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,210
- What car?
- You're losing me here.

431
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,670
[JIMMY]
If I'd gotten into that car that day...

432
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,680
...my life would have been
a different thing.

433
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,680
My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother...

434
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,810
...she was a beautiful woman.

435
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,230
Regal.

436
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,650
As a lot of Latin women are,
and she knew it.

437
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,320
You had to have balls
to go near her, and I did.

438
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,650
Eighteen years old, the two of us.
She was carrying Katie.

439
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,570
Now, here's the thing, Sean.

440
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,540
If I'd gotten into that car,
I'd be a basket case.

441
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,750
I never would have had the juice
to go near her.

442
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,080
And Katie never would have been born.

443
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,380
And she never would have
been murdered. You know?

444
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,550
[JIMMY] See?
- Yeah.

445
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:28,680
- You ever see Dave around?
- He married my cousin Celeste.

446
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,600
[WHITEY COUGHS]

447
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:35,650
What time did Katie get home
from work yesterday?

448
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,320
MRS. MARKUM:
Around 7:30.

449
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,440
Anything unusual,
out of the way about her?

450
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:47,240
No. She sat with us,
with me and the girls, while we ate.

451
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,450
She was having dinner with her friends.

452
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,920
[WHITEY] Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
- Yeah.

453
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:00,920
She talked to Nadine
about her Communion...

454
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:04,590
...and then she was on the phone
in her room for a bit.

455
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,140
And then around 8, she left.

456
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,430
[WHITEY] Do you know who she talked to?
- No.

457
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,350
Do you mind if we have the phone
company subpoenaed for records?

458
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,770
- No, go ahead.
[WHITEY] Good.

459
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,320
You spent most of the day Saturday
with your daughter in the store, correct?

460
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,570
Yes and no. I was mostly in back.

461
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,780
Anything odd? A confrontation
with a customer, anything?

462
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,200
No, she was herself,
she was happy. She...

463
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,160
[WHITEY]
She what?

464
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,460
It's nothing.

465
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:39,800
Listen, the littlest thing
could be something right now.

466
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:44,050
It's just that when she was little,
right after her mother died...

467
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,890
...I had just gotten out of prison,
she couldn't be by herself.

468
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:51,310
Whether she was crying or not,
it didn't matter...

469
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,690
...but she gave a look sometimes, like
she was preparing to never see you again.

470
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:59,820
For a couple of seconds on Saturday,
she looked at me that way.

471
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,650
[WHITEY] Okay.
- It was just a look.

472
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,030
It's information. We collect it, put it
together, see what fits. Little things.

- I'm just asking.

Sixteen years ago, I did a two-year bit
for robbery at Deer Island.

477
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,840
Is that gonna find
my daughter's killer? Just asking.

was there anything else?

There was this kid.

This kid Brendan Harris come in the store,
like he was expecting to see her.

00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,920
- Barely knew each other.
- Could they have been dating?

488
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,880
[JIMMY] No.
- What makes you so sure?

Sean, are you gonna grill me?
A father knows.

490
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,550
Mrs. Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?

491
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:12,010
No one right now, as far as we know.

492
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,270
- I mean, knew.
- I'll give you whatever you need tomorrow.

493
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,730
We got girls at home wanting to know
where their sister is.

All right, there will be a trooper
downstairs to take you home.

when you were kids?

Shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle
were playing in front of my house.

This car came up and took Dave away.

- Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.

The other got busted,
went the noose route in his cell.

Your pal Markum, the moment I laid
eyes on him, I could tell he'd done time.

505
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:06,280
They never lose that tension,
it settles in their shoulders.

506
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,200
He lost his daughter.
That's what's in his shoulders.

No, that's in his stomach.

...had pamphlets on Las Vegas
and a list of Vegas hotels.

Did you see her?

That Celeste, she's a godsend.
You thank her for me, will you?

614
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:34,020
It's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.

615
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,610
Yeah.

616
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,580
I couldn't stand looking through the
fridge to find room for all that food...

617
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,710
...we're gonna throw away
in the next few days.

618
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,210
- Lot of waste, huh?
- Yeah.

619
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:58,840
I just can't let anything get fucked up
in these next few days.

620
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:03,930
Because it's all anybody
will remember about her.

621
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:13,610
One thing you could say about Katie,
even when she was little...

622
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,900
...that girl was neat.

623
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,820
When I got out of the joint...

624
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,120
...you know, after Marita died...

625
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:32,630
...I remember, I was more afraid
of my little daughter...

626
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:36,460
...than I ever was of being in prison.

627
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:47,140
I loved her...

628
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,350
...most...

629
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:56,530
...because when we were sitting in that
kitchen that night...

630
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:05,530
...it was like we were the last two
people on Earth. You know, forgotten.

Unwanted.

632
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,790
And it's really starting to piss me off,
Dave, because I can't cry for her.

633
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,050
My own little daughter,
and I can't even cry for her.

634
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:25,810

You're crying now.

Yeah, damn.

00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,200
I just want to hug her one more time.

638
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:52,620
She was 19 fucking years old.

639
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,880
Do you want me to leave you alone?

640
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,430
No, just stay here for a minute,
if that's cool.

641
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,220
Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.

642
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:29,870
When was the last time
you saw Katie Markum?

643
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,620
- You don't think I'd hurt her do you?
- She isn't hurt. She's dead.

644
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,590
- I didn't kill her.
- Again, when's the last time you saw her?

645
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,090
About 8...
Saturday night, about 8:00.

646
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,390
About like 8, Brendan, or at 8?

647
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,930
It was about 8. Um...

648
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:56,940
We had a couple slices at Hi-Fi,
and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.

649
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:00,610
Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum
like you?

650

I don't know.

651
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:09,450
But he told Katie he never wanted her
to see me or any other Harris.

652
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,540
What? That thief thinks he's better
than our family?

653
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,210
He's not a thief.

654

MRS. HARRIS:
He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.

655

Daughter probably had the same bad
gene. You count yourself lucky, Bren.

656
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:27,640
So Katie had some brochures for Vegas.
We heard she was going there with you.

657
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,810
We were gonna leave Sunday.

We were gonna get married
when we got there.

659
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:40,520
Well, that was the plan, right?

660
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:43,690
You were gonna leave me?
Without a word?

661

- Ma, I was gonna tell you.
- Just like your father, huh?

He don't speak.

a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.

go watch TV or something.

668
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:16,980
So where were you between 12:30
and 2 a.m. On Sunday morning, Brendan?

669
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:19,060
I was asleep.

00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,020
Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?

671
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,990
I can confirm that he closed his door
at 10:00.

672
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,950
He came down for breakfast at 9.

00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:36,420
I can't confirm that he didn't open
his window and go down the fire escape.

Okay, we're gonna ask you to take a

I'm never gonna feel that again.

[DAVE] Yeah, the yuppies are coming.

769
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,150
[SEAN] They're cutting my dad's
old house up into condos.

770
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,110
We walked by there the other day.

771
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,530
Must be something we could do
to stop them.

772
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,120
A friend of mine says the other day,
he says:

773
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,410
"Neighborhood needs
a fucking crime wave.

774
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:44,750
Get property values where they belong."

775
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:49,420
Girls keep getting murdered up in
Pen Park you might get your wish.

776
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,090
Dave. Call me Dave.

777
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,210
You said the F-word, Dad.

778
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:57,380
Yeah, I know.
Walk on up ahead, Michael.

779
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:00,720
Us guys need to talk. Go on.

780
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:04,890
- So, what's up, Sean?
- Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?

781
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,980
Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday.
Celeste is there now.

782
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,270
- Who's Celeste?
- My wife.

783
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,690
- How's Jimmy doing?
- It's hard to tell. You know him.

784
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:18,240
- Yeah, so the reason we came by...
- Listen, I saw her.

785
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:23,450
Katie. I don't know if you know that.
At McGill's, the night she died.

786
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,620
That's what we wanted to talk about.

787
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:29,750
They were at a couple of bars that night.
Your name turned up for McGill's.

788
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,210
They put on quite a show
dancing on the bar.

789
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:35,920
- Pretty drunk, huh?
- But it was harmless.

790
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:39,130
They weren't stripping or nothing.
They were just 19.

791
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,890
What time did they leave?

792
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:44,100
I left at 1. They must've left
15 minutes before me.

793
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:47,390
- So we'll say 12:45?
- Sounds about right.

794
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,060
[SEAN] You see anything unusual
or anyone...?

795
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:52,900
[DAVE]
Michael.

796
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,110
[SEAN] Like what?
I don't know.

797
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,610
A guy watching the girls?

798
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,610
A guy with hate in his eyes?
A woman-hater?

799
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:05,620
No, if they hadn't danced on the bar,
it would've been business as usual.

800
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,160
See you later, Dad.

801
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,120
- You got your milk money?
- Uh-huh.

802
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,130
Fuck, I hated school.

803
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:20,180
What?

804
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:21,430
Oh, uh...

805
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,680
Yeah, me too, Sean.

806
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:30,350
Uh, just one more thing, Mr. Boyle.
Where did you go after you left McGill's?

807
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,650
- Home.
- Home by 1:15, would you say?

808
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:36,610
- Roughly. Sure.
- All right.

809
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,360
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.
We'll grab a beer sometime?

810
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,990
- Yeah, I'd like that, Sean.
[SEAN] All right.

811
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,370
[Bell Rings]

812
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:53,250
What?

813
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:56,000
[WHITEY]
What happened to him in that car?

814
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:05,180
Can you believe this?

815
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:08,350
Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.
It costs 15 times the price.

816
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,310
Yeah, well...

817
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:14,400
You know, you take away love,
money or hate as motives...

818
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:16,480
...you're not left with a whole lot.

819
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:19,240
Well, if this Markum thing's random,
I mean, shit.

820
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:23,620
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,
Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.

821
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:25,740
Hears a gunshot,
before that a "hi"...

822
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:29,160
...which tells me the girl is either
friendly or she knew him.

823
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:33,960
She turns to the curb, not too fast or she
hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.

824
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:38,000
- She says, "Hi." He shoots her.
- She slams the door into him, takes off.

825
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:40,840
What makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes?

826
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,640
- I don't know. Something in the street.
- Maybe.

827
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,060
This Markum girl couldn't have
weighed more than what, 110?

828
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:51,520
- Hits hard enough to get a jump on him?
- Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.

829
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:55,230
Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy
permanently back on his heels.

830
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second, how
did we get to Dave Boyle all of a sudden?

831
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:01,490
[WHITEY] We just got to him.
- He's a guy who was in the bar.

832
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,490
The last place, Seany,
the last place she was at.

833
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,780
The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.

834
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:10,620
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously
want to take a look at Dave Boyle?

835
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:12,960
Just a little one.

836
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:22,220
I'd recommend two sets of
visiting hours, from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.

837
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,550
- Sure.
- Good.

838
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:30,890
- Have you thought about flowers?
- I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.

839
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:32,560
Good.

840
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:39,860
And the notice?

841
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,070
Notice?

842
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:48,330
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it
if you give us her basic information.

843
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:51,080
Or if you prefer donations
in lieu of flowers?

844
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,960
Where's my daughter?

845
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,500
Downstairs, in the basement.

846
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:59,630
I wanna see her.

847
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:49,350
I'm gonna find him, Katie.

848
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,850
I'm gonna find him before the police do.

849
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:56,850
I'm gonna find the man,
and I'm gonna kill him.

850
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,360
[MAN]
Did you say something, Mr. Markum?

851
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,740
The notice.

852
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,410
It should read; "Katherine Markum...

853
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,580
...beloved daughter
of James and Marita, deceased...

854
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:22,590
...stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to..."

855
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:26,380
"Sister to Sara and Nadine."

856
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:10,800
[DAVE] You guys again?
- Yeah. We're like two bad pennies.

857
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,060
- You dropping in on Jimmy?
- Yeah.

858
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:16,980
Do you have some kind of, what,
break in the case?

859
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:20,150
No, just paying our respects.
Where you off to?

860
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,940
[DAVE]
Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes.

861
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:24,940
I'm gonna go get some.
See you in a minute.

862
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:28,950
By the way, Mr. Boyle, what happened
to your hand there?

863
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:35,410
Uh, garbage disposal. It jammed,
I stuck my hand in, it started again.

864
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,290
- Stupid.
[WHITEY] Yeah, painful.

865
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:43,960
Garbage disposal. Bullshit.

866
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:48,130
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean
he killed anybody either. Come on.

867
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:53,640
[Knocking]

868
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:04,780
- Heard you could use one.
- Thanks.

869
01:09:06,150 --> 01:09:10,490
- I quit 10 years ago, you believe this?
- Whatever you need right now.

870
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,200
Come on in, I'll get Jimmy.

871
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:22,540
I got a couple errands I gotta run.
I'll be back in an hour.

872
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:25,380
You don't have to come back, Celeste.
I'll be fine.

873
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:26,720
[CELESTE] Sure?
- Celeste Boyle?

874
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,340
Uh, yeah.

875
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:31,930
I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's.
This is Whitey Powers.

876
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,140
- Mrs. Boyle.
- Nice to meet you.

877
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:36,810
Look, I gotta go.

878
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:41,480
- Oh, damn it.
[WHITEY] What?

879
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:43,400
I left my report pad in the cruiser.

880
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:46,150
- You better go get it.
- Yeah.

881
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:48,450
Come on.

882
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:57,040
Hey, Celeste, could I ask you
a quick question?

883
01:09:57,580 --> 01:10:00,000
- Me?
- What time did Dave get home Saturday?

884
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,790
- What?
- It's a little thing.

885
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,710
We're running a time line on everything
involving Katie. I'm sure...

886
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,920
...Dave told you he saw her
at McGill's.

887
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:11,680
You think Dave killed Katie?

888
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:15,390
Oh, no. God. I didn't say that.
Why would I even think that?

889
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:21,230
- I don't know.
- No. It's just that we could figure out...

890
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,980
...what time she was on the road
if we knew what time Dave got home.

891
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:28,320
See, it's 5 minutes from your place
to McGill's...

892
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:31,950
...and Katie left 15 minutes
before Dave did. You see what I mean.

893
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:35,450
- I was asleep.
- Huh?

894
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:41,790
Saturday night, when Dave came in,
I was asleep.

895
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,290
Okay. Well, thanks.

896
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,770
Bullshit.

897
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:58,430
[SEAN]
No, he was dating Katie, Jim.

898
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,270
They were gonna elope to Vegas.
We found tickets under their names.

899
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,150
Brendan Harris confirmed it.

900
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:05,940
Remember what you said?

901
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,950
How she looked at you on Saturday like
she was preparing to never see you again?

902
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:16,410
- Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?
- No.

903
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:18,160
You're 100 percent sure?

904
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:23,130
Passed his poly with flying colors, plus it
seemed to me like he really loved her.

905
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:29,050
Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.

906
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,630
Why are you so dead set
against that kid?

907
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,470
He said Katie told him you'd disown
her if she ever dated a Harris.

908
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:40,310
I knew his father. They called him
"Just Ray" Harris.

909
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,810
Why is that?

910
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,480
There were so many Rays
in the neighborhood.

911
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:50,820
You had "Crazy Ray" Bucheck,
"Psycho Ray" Dorian.

912
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:54,990
The cool names were taken,
so he got stuck with "Just Ray."

913
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,990
We never got along.
I flat out didn't like him.

914
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:03,670
And he cut out on his wife when she was
pregnant with that little mute of hers.

915
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,840
I don't know.

916
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:09,000
I just figure the apple doesn't fall

What does Just Ray's gun
have to do with Dave?

1073
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,270
These things get passed around.

1074
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:27,400
Just Ray may have blown town,
but his gun never did.

1075
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:30,490
I say we talk with Brendan Harris
in the morning.

1076
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:34,740
And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story.
The wife, she's definitely scared.

1077
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:39,370
They're hiding something, but Boyle's
as much a killer as Brendan Harris.

1078
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:43,710
Boyle fits the profile, a fucking T.
Mid-30s, white, marginally employed...

1079
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:48,050
...sexually abused as a kid. On paper,
this guy should be in jail already.

1080
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:50,550
Katie Markum
was not sexually abused, see?

1081
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:54,100
In that equation,
sexual emission is part of the deal.

1082
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:58,270
You were friends when you were kids.
This makes you a fucking liability.

1083
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,730
Hey, he's not my friend.

1084
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:04,400
Turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs
off my hip faster than yours.

1085
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,620
Hey, Jimmy.

1086
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:23,420
You're out late.

1087
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:25,300
Yeah, you too.

1088
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,550
It's cold, huh?

1089
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,050
Yeah, I guess.

1090
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,100
You know, I...

1091
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,650
I been sitting out here...

1092
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:44,940
...over the last few years...

1093
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:50,950
...waiting on Katie to get back
from someplace.

1094
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:56,950
About midnight, I'd say to Annabeth,
"I'm gonna sit on the porch for a while."

1095
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,340
Weird thing is...

1096
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:06,300
...it seemed to bring her back.

1097
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,840
I saw her, you know.

1098
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,350
Saw who?

1099
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,680
Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.

1100
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:25,820
- You saw Katie Saturday night?
- Never got around to telling you.

1101
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:30,490
Did you talk to her?

1102
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,820
Just nodded hello at one point.

1103
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:37,160
Next time I looked up, she was gone.

1104
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:44,880
But, uh...

1105
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,630
...Jimmy...

1106
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:50,010
...she looked, um...

1107
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,840
...happy.

1108
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:13,030
Uh, I got more walking to do.
Good night.

1109
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,170
- You stole his car.
- His car was officially towed.

1110
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:32,170
[SEAN] From the front of his house.
- No! It was abandoned in Rome Basin...

1111
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:33,840
...adjacent to the parkway.

1112
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:38,560
Lucky for us, the parkway's state
jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car...

1113
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:42,310
...they took it for a joy ride...
- What? Why'd you do it?

1114
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:47,400
After I left last night, I decided to talk
to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.

1115
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:52,360
I get to his house, I decide to look in
his car, see what he's got. I find blood.

1116
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:55,240
- Blood?
- Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.

1117
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:59,240
- How much?
- A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot.

1118
01:26:59,410 --> 01:27:02,250
Type O, same type as Katie Markum.

1119
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:05,170
Wait, Katie Markum
never got in anybody's trunk.

1120
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:08,090
She was chased through the park
where she died.

1121
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:12,090
- It's enough to ask questions.
- Your search is gonna get tossed out.

1122
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:17,140
No, found and abandoned in state
jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.

1123
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:21,430
- In the best interest of the owner.
- Get a physical search, file the report.

1124
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,100
[WHITEY]
Bingo.

1125
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:26,440
So, you wanna talk to him,
or should I send him home?

1126
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:29,780
- Dave's here?
- I've had him in the box for an hour.

1127
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:33,070
Sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers
to pick him up.

1128
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:36,120
Come on, Mr. Boyle!

1129
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:39,490
We know you didn't get that swollen
hand sticking it in the garbage disposal.

1130
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:44,920
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- Why's your wife afraid of you?

1131
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,960
She know what really happened
to your hand?

1132
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:57,140
How about a Sprite or something?

1133
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:01,350
How about you tell us what really
happened Saturday night, Mr. Boyle?

1134
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,060
You lied.

1135
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:05,770
That's your opinion,
which you're entitled to.

1136
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:10,820
- Hey, you think this is funny?
- No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.

1137
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:15,450
Not only was my car stolen last night,
but now you won't release it to me.

1138
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:17,200
Okay.

1139
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:20,370
All right.

1140
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:24,000
Tell us, Mr. Boyle,
how did you get the blood in your car?

1141
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,830
- What blood?
- Let's start with the front seat.

1142
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:30,750
What are you looking at him for?

1143
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:35,880
Hey, you think I could get
that Sprite, Sean?

1144
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,180
Sure.

1145
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:40,470
[DAVE]
Oh, I get it.

1146
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:42,930
You're the good cop.

1147
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:46,480
How about a meatball sub
while you're at it?

1148
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:49,860
I ain't your bitch, Dave.
Looks like you'll have to wait.

1149
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:54,240
Yeah, but you're someone's bitch,
aren't you, Sean?

1150
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:59,910
The blood on your front seat, Dave.
Answer the sergeant.

1151
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:05,790
We got a chainlink fence
in our back yard.

1152
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:09,170
Me and my kid play Wiffle Ball
every afternoon after school.

1153
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:13,960
He's getting good, so most of the balls
are on the other side of the fence.

1154
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:16,800
So I climb it.
Except I slip...

1155
01:29:16,970 --> 01:29:20,180
...slice myself where the links curl in,
right here.

1156
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:22,140
Bled like hell.

1157
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,810
Ten minutes later,
I gotta pick up Michael at school.

1158
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:29,560
Probably was still bleeding
when I got in the front seat.

1159
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:31,440
What blood type are you?

1160
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:33,780
B-negative.

1161
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:36,740
Yeah? That's the match we got.

1162
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,410
- Well, there you go.
- Not quite.

1163
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:42,080
Blood in the trunk of the car
wasn't B-negative.

1164
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:46,250
I don't know anything
about any blood in the trunk.

1165
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:50,080
No idea how half a pint of blood
got in the trunk?

1166
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:53,420
- None.
- This is not the way you wanna go.

1167
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:55,300
[WHITEY]
How will that look in court?

1168
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:59,390
You not knowing how someone else's
blood got in the trunk of your car?

1169
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:02,470
Gonna look fine, I suppose.
You filed the report.

1170
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:04,770
What report?

1171
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:09,440
The stolen-car report. The car
wasn't in my possession last night.

1172
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:12,860
So whatever the thieves used it for,
you should find out...

1173
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:15,610
...because it sounds like they
were up to no good.

1174
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:25,120
Things looking any better
on the Sprite, Sean?

1175
01:30:25,370 --> 01:30:28,920
Well, you just got too fucking smart.
The car is inadmissible.

1176
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,750
Anything there, his lawyers say
was put by thieves.

1177
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,510
- I can break him.
- He just kicked our asses!

1178
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:36,840
You still think Dave
wouldn't hurt a fly...

1179
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:39,300
- Is that the point? No.
- What is the point?

1180
01:30:39,470 --> 01:30:43,470
We can break this open on the gun.
It's the gun.

1181
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:46,140
Okay. Maybe.

1182
01:30:48,650 --> 01:30:50,310
So, what do we do with Dave?

1183
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:53,520
Fuck it. Kick him loose.

1184
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:58,320
Maybe a Celtic cross.
That's always a popular choice.

1185
01:30:58,530 --> 01:31:01,820
Or this lovely red marble here.

1186
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:04,490
Or a figural.

1187
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:06,250
That one.

1188
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:10,250
Very good. Nice and simple.

1189
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,340
Hey, Jimmy!

1190
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,930
Annabeth said you were here.

1191
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:29,390
We been asking around, like you said to.

1192
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,100
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1193
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:34,400
Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit
you did for me.

1194
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:36,820
And it ain't about me
missing your brains running things.

1195
01:31:36,990 --> 01:31:38,030
I know.

1196
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:42,320
Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but
she was part of our family, we loved her.

1197
01:31:42,490 --> 01:31:45,040
I don't question you, Val.
What's up?

1198
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:51,210
Cops are all over this. Doing their job
for once. Bars, street trade, everything.

1199
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:54,840
Every hooker we talked to, bartender,
already been questioned.

1200
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,880
- The fucking law has descended, Jimmy.
- What about Just Ray's kid?

1201
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:02,930
Quiet as a mouse.
Kid's no trouble to anyone.

1202
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:06,390
I talked to Diane and Eve.
They said he loved her.

1203
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:09,230
Jimmy, they said that she loved him.

1204
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:13,730
- Want us to take a run at him?
- No.

1205
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:17,570
Hold off for now.
Anything else?

1206
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:21,860
What?

1207
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:27,700
Val, you wanna spit something, spit it.

1208
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:29,410
Tell him.

1209
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:34,090
Sean Devine and his partner
went by and saw Dave Boyle.

1210
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:37,960
Dave was at McGill's. Probably
questioning him like everybody else.

1211
01:32:38,670 --> 01:32:40,970
I heard something else this morning too.

1212
01:32:41,130 --> 01:32:45,810
- Two staties came by in uniform.
- Maybe forgot to ask him something.

1213
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:49,180
No. When they left,
they took him with them.

1214
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:52,440
They put him in the back seat,
if you know what I mean.

1215
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:11,710
"Raymond Matthew Harris,
born 9-6, 1957.

1216
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:14,500
First child, Brendan Seamus, born 1983."

1217
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:19,300
Same year that Just Ray is indicted
in a scam to embezzle subway tokens.

1218
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:21,800
Charges are dropped, and he's fired.

1219
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:26,140
Does odd jobs after that,
including clerking at Looney Liquors.

1220
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:31,230
Questioned in that robbery. Questioned in
another, same year, Blanchard Liquors...

1221
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:33,640
...released on lack of evidence again.

1222
01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:36,520
- Beginning to become known, though.
- He's getting popular.

1223
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:40,900
Ooh. "A known associate,
one Edmund Reese, fingers Raymond...

1224
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:44,660
...in the 1985 heist
of a rare comic-book collection."

1225
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:46,320
Comic books? You go, Ray.

1226
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:49,160
Hey, hey, hey, excuse me,
$150,000 worth of comic books.

1227
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:51,080
Oh, excuse me.

1228
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:55,170
"Raymond returned said literature
unharmed." Does a year solid inside.

1229
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:56,670
Ooh. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

1230
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:59,340
Comes out with a chemical-dependency
problem.

1231
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:01,340
Gets honest work
to support the habit, though?

1232
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:04,050
Mm, evidently not.

1233
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:08,560
Picked up in a joint
MCU-FBI sting operation...

1234
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:13,190
...trafficking stolen goods across state
lines. Stole a truckload of cigarettes.

1235
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:16,190
- The boy's got style.
- Got a boatload of grief too.

1236
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:21,030
Stole the truck in Rhode Island,
drove it into Massachusetts.

1237
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:26,030
- Hence, the federal interstate rap.
- Hence, they got him by the balls, but...

1238
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,870
...he does no time.

1239
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:32,080
- He rolled on someone.
- Looks that way. After that, he's clean.

1240
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:36,540
- August 1989, poof, he disappears.
- One, dead, two, in Witness Protection.

1241
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:40,000
Three, he goes deep underground,
then pops back up...

1242
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:43,760
...to murder his son's 19-year-old
girlfriend? We got nothing.

1243
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:48,550
A prime suspect in a robbery 18 years
ago, during which the weapon was used.

1244
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:52,560
The guy's son dated the victim.
I say we got a lot.

1245
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:55,600
Anything about Just Ray's
known associates?

1246
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:58,400
Let's take a look.
"Known criminal associates:

1247
01:34:58,570 --> 01:35:03,400
Reginald 'Dukie' Neil, Kevin
'Whackjob' Sirraci, Nicholas Savage...

1248
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:05,240
...Anthony Waxman."

1249
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,620
Ah...

1250
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,120
And one James Markum.

1251
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:14,750
And the hits just keep on coming.

1252
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:22,090
- You looking for me?
- I'm Sean Devine. This is Whitey Powers.

1253
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,340
I already gotta get back.

1254
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,930
[SEAN] So you worked a task force
with Major Crimes in the '80s?

1255
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:31,600
- Bunch of them.
- You took down a smalltimer, Ray Harris.

1256
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:36,270
He stole a truckload of cigarettes from
a rest stop in Cranston, Rhode Island.

1257
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:39,520
Trucker went to take a piss,
Harris guy jacks the truck.

1258
01:35:39,690 --> 01:35:42,030
I think we pulled him over
in New Bedford.

1259
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:43,240
But Harris walked.

1260
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:45,740
He didn't walk, he rolled.

1261
01:35:45,910 --> 01:35:50,120
Boston Police Anti-Gang Unit stepped in
for info on another case. He rolled.

1262
01:35:50,290 --> 01:35:51,870
On who?

1263
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:54,660
What the fuck was the name?

1264
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:58,790
Him and three other guys knocked over
the MBTA counting room, 60 grand.

1265
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,750
Jimmy Markum.

1266
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:05,930
Kid was 19, 20. Slick as hell, man.
Ran a crew, never got arrested.

1267
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:08,970
So did Harris ever testify in open court?

1268
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:12,720
Never went. Markum dummied up
on the guys he was working with...

1269
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:16,640
...DA was afraid he wouldn't be able
to convict. So he cut a deal.

1270
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:19,020
Two years inside,
couple more suspended.

1271
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:22,730
So Jimmy Markum never knew
that Ray Harris ratted him out?

1272
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:26,530
Ray Harris disappeared
about two months...

1273
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,660
...after Markum rotated back
into the free world.

1274
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:31,490
What's that tell you?

1275
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:45,510
[CELESTE]
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Val.

1276
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,510
- Hey, coz, how you doing?
[CELESTE] I'm good.

1277
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:51,350
Okay. Hey.

1278
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:54,060
[JIMMY] Hey, Celeste.
- Hey, Jimmy. Hey.

1279
01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:58,020
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- I'll catch up with you in a minute.

1280
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:02,690
Step into my office.

1281
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,330
Beautiful day, huh?

1282
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:26,510
Whatever it is, Celeste, it's okay.

1283
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:34,850
I took Michael last night...

1284
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:37,100
...and I went to a motel.

1285
01:37:39,310 --> 01:37:40,560
Okay.

1286
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:43,480
I don't know, Jim.

1287
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,900
I might have left Dave for good.

1288
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:50,280
You left Dave?

1289
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:55,040
Yeah.

1290
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:57,750
Well...

1291
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:02,630
...he's been acting kind of nuts lately.

1292
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:07,130
I'm almost afraid of him.

1293
01:38:11,390 --> 01:38:13,140
Do you know something?

1294
01:38:16,270 --> 01:38:19,270
I know he was taken in by the cops
this morning.

1295
01:38:19,940 --> 01:38:21,860
He saw Katie the night
she was murdered.

1296
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:25,280
Didn't tell me about it
till after the cops questioned him.

1297
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:29,610
I know he's got a hand that looks like
it's been punching a fucking wall.

1298
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:32,780
Is there anything else I should know?

1299
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:42,210
Come here.

1300
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:46,340
Okay.

1301
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:49,720
At 3 in the morning...

1302
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:55,470
...on Sunday, Dave came back to the
apartment covered in someone's blood.

1303
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:01,310
What did he say happened?

1304
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:06,440
That he was mugged.
That he...

1305
01:39:06,610 --> 01:39:09,400
He bashed the mugger's head
in the street.

1306
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:10,820
That...

1307
01:39:10,990 --> 01:39:13,320
That he might have killed him.

1308
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,040
But there was nothing in the paper.

1309
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:39,100
- Celeste?
- Yeah?

1310
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:40,770
Celeste?

1311
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:47,650
Do you think Dave killed my Katie?

1312
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:54,700
Okay. All right.

1313
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:56,370
Okay.

1314
01:39:57,370 --> 01:39:59,200
[CELESTE]
Oh, God.

1315
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:06,920
Okay.

1316
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:11,550
[CELESTE]
Oh, my God.

1317
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:15,760
[SEAN] Tell me about your father.
[BRENDAN] What?

1318
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:19,890
Your father, Ray Sr.
You remember him.

1319
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:23,940
- I was 6 when he left us.
- So you don't remember the guy?

1320
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:27,270
I remember little things.

1321
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:30,780
He smelled like Schlitz and Dentyne.

1322
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:32,900
He...

1323
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:35,120
He what?

1324
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:40,580
He carried a lot of change in his pocket.
It jingled when he walked.

1325
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:43,250
You could always hear him
coming home.

1326
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:48,670
And if I guessed how much he had,
even if I was close, he'd give it to me.

1327
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:51,920
You remember your father having a gun?

1328
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:53,930
No.

1329
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:58,560
Well, you seem awfully sure for
somebody who was 6 when he left.

1330
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:00,850
What's up?

1331
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:03,850
- What's that?
[DETECTIVE] This is what you asked for.

1332
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:08,610
CSS reports, ballistics, fingerprint
analysis, the 911 tape. Bunch of stuff.

1333
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:10,440
- All right, thanks.
- Yeah.

1334
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:13,780
We were talking about your father's gun.

1335
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:20,160
- I told you, my father didn't have a gun.
- Oh, well, I guess we were misinformed.

1336
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,920
- So when was the last time you talked?
- Never.

1337
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:25,420
Never?

1338
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:27,880
He went out for a drink
and never came back.

1339
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:31,550
But your mother never filed
a missing person's report. Why not?

1340
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:33,430
Because he's not missing.

1341
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:36,470
- He sends money every month.
- Sends money?

1342
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:41,060
Five hundred bucks every month.
Like clockwork.

1343
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:45,270
- From where?
- Postmark says Brooklyn.

1344
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:49,480
- How do you know it's him?
- Who else would it be?

1345
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,320
[BRENDAN]
Who else would send it?

1346
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:57,570
My ma says that's the way he was.

1347
01:41:57,740 --> 01:42:00,660
Do something shitty,
then he'd try to make up for it.

1348
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:07,170
Why do you keep asking me
if my father had a gun?

1349
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:10,550
You know why, kid.

1350
01:42:11,090 --> 01:42:12,380
No, I don't.

1351
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:15,180
The gun that killed your girlfriend...

1352
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:18,220
...was the same gun your father used
in a robbery 18 years ago.

1353
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:20,390
So...

1354
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:23,020
...you wanna tell me about it?

1355
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:28,360
My father didn't have a gun.

1356
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:30,530
You are fucking lying!

1357
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:38,660
Can I go now?

1358
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:42,200
Or are you gonna charge me
with Katie's murder?

1359
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:59,050
[VAL] Hey! Dandy Dave Boyle,
how's it hanging?

1360
01:43:00,010 --> 01:43:01,770
Hey, Val.

1361
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:04,440
Nick. How you guys holding up?

1362
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:07,230
[NICK] All right.
- It's fucked up.

1363
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:11,150
Katie.

1364
01:43:12,570 --> 01:43:14,400
A fucking tragedy.

1365
01:43:15,570 --> 01:43:16,820
[NICK]
Yeah.

1366
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:19,700
We're gonna get a couple of beers
and a bite to eat.

1367
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:21,290
Yeah?

1368
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,330
Yeah. What do you say, man? Hm?

1369
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:28,290
How about a boys' night out
in the middle of the day?

1370
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:34,630
- I gotta get home after a while.
- Don't we all? Hop in.

1371
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,590

- All right.

Well, the first round's on me.

Now you're talking.

1374
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:05,290
I think the kid is lying about the gun.

1375
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:07,870
Absolutely. I told you
three times already.

1376
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:13,050
- What about the father?
- I don't know. Maybe Just Ray is alive.

1377
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:14,800
Eighty grand. I mean...

1378

...who else is gonna send
that kind of money if not the father?

[WHITEY]
Listen, go home, have a drink.

1380
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:26,930
- Let it go for a while.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1381
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:29,440
Hey, anything good on the 911?

1382
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:33,190

[MAN] 911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?

1385
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:44,040
[BOY] There's, like, this car
with blood in it, and the door's open.

01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:47,160
[MAN] What's the location of the car?
[BOY] Sydney Street.

1387

It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend, we just found it.

Good luck, man.

That about cracks the case, don't it?
Let's get a burger or something.

Her.

[BOY] He wants to know her name.

1396
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:21,160

- She's a dead girl, refer to her as a she.

1397
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:23,910
How does the kid know?
Girl's dead in the park.

1398
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:27,460
How does he know the blood in the car
came from a woman?

1399
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:33,420

but I'm looking at Carson.

01:46:09,670 --> 01:46:11,670
I'm thinking, "What the fuck?"

1410
01:46:11,830 --> 01:46:17,130
Because that fucking bonehead's
still got his Ronald Reagan mask on!

And you guys didn't notice till then?

Shit like that happened all the time on
jobs. That's why Jimmy was so missed.

He saw shit happen
before it even went down.

Why do you think he went straight?

That's pretty fucking funny!

[NICK] All right, Val! Now you're talking.

Yeah, nobody bothers you.

nobody to bother you in this life.

that time?

Everybody called this guy "Just Ray,"
but Val here called him "Ray Jingles."

with 10 bucks in change...

Let me tell you about Ray Harris.

1459
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:14,020
He was a buddy of mine.
He used to visit me in prison.

1460
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:19,480
He checked in on Marita and Katie,
my mother, if they needed anything.

1461
01:51:19,650 --> 01:51:22,230
He's also the one who put me in.
He ratted me out.

01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:25,030
- Shit, that's terrible.
- My wife had cancer at the time.

1463
01:51:25,190 --> 01:51:27,700
- Yeah, I remember.
- Ray robbed me of being with her...

1464
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:29,110
...when she was dying.

1465

The death part you do alone, but I could
have helped her with the dying.

01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:35,750
Why are you telling me this?

1467
01:51:35,910 --> 01:51:40,130
I knelt Ray down over there and
I shot him twice, in his throat and chest.

1468
01:51:40,290 --> 01:51:42,750
- We were both crying when I did it.
- Jimmy...

1469
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:44,460
[JIMMY]
He was begging.

1470
01:51:44,630 --> 01:51:47,380
You know, pregnant wife, little Brendan.

1471
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:52,010
He said he knew me.
He said I was a good man.

1472
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:55,600
What do you think, Dave?
You think I'm a good man?

1473
01:51:56,430 --> 01:51:57,850
Who do you hate?

Come on, who?

01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:03,360
No one.

1476
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:10,450
- What is it you think I did?
- As I was holding him under the water...

1477
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:14,120
...I could feel God watching me,
shaking his head. Not angry...

You love me so much,
I wanna hear you say it.

- Don't talk, Dave. Don't talk.

1484
01:52:44,610 --> 01:52:47,320
No, I killed someone,
but I didn't kill Katie.

This is the mugger story.

1486
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:51,820
He wasn't a mugger,
he was a child molester.

1487
01:52:51,990 --> 01:52:54,200
He was having sex with
this kid in his car.

1488
01:52:54,370 --> 01:52:58,160
He was a fucking wolf!
He was a vampire!

Get out of here.

[JIMMY] You killed a child molester.
- Yeah. Well, me and the boy.

1493
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:33,700
- The molested boy helped you.
- Oh, no. No...

1494
01:53:33,870 --> 01:53:38,500
- You just said you and the boy!
- No, forget that!

1495
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:43,040
- My head gets fucked up sometimes.
- Your wife thinks you killed my daughter.

1496
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:47,800
You'd rather have her think that
than you killed a child molester?

1497
01:53:47,970 --> 01:53:51,470
People don't care if a child molester dies.
Why not tell the truth?

1498
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:56,060
I don't know. Maybe I thought
I was turning into him.

1499
01:53:56,220 --> 01:53:58,430
I didn't kill Katie.

1500

I don't remember hearing anything about
any guy's body being found.

Me and my son. Me and Celeste. There's
so many things we gotta make right.

Make it right now. Start now.
Admit what you did.

1513

No more lies, no more secrets.

I wanna go home to Celeste.
I wanna feel Celeste.

1515

Right after you do your time. I did mine,
you do yours. Admit what you did.

...and I will open you the fuck up.
