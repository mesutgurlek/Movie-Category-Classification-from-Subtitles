Time travel. It's easy
when you think about it.

You do it every day
in one direction.

Would it be enough
to just observe?

Or would knowing you had
the power to change that moment,

Sorry, are ya? I just paid two cents
for that doughnut and coffee.

I said I'm sorry, Officer.

He says he's sorry, boys.

If you was truly sorry, laddie,

as an accomplice in the murder
of T.E.C. Agent Edwards.

Silence!

194
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,127
The outstanding murder warrant against
you supercedes the present charges.

There are far too many variables,

we have a moral obligation to
right the wrongs of the past.

All right. This morning, Ryan Chan
starts his 30-day suspension.

243
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:30,137
This afternoon, he had Frank Knight
arrested, tried and sentenced.

244
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,776
- He served his 30 days.
- He was gone for three hours.

245
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:38,084
Nowhere in the Oversight Committee's ruling
does it say where he has to take his 30 days.

246
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,557
He happened to be there when the time
crime was being committed.

247
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:45,722
He'd already served his 30 days, so
officially he was back on active duty.

- We had him in 1988, and he just...

Why? Why would he kill your father then?
You were already born.

- It would do him no good.
- Miller was looking for me!

You're making this sound
like it already happened.

699
01:02:01,098 --> 01:02:04,295
It did already happen! It's about
to happen again if I don't stop him!

700
01:02:04,368 --> 01:02:06,302
You've been launched too many times.

701
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:09,965
You gotta launch me again, or Miller's
gonna kill me when I'm 11 in 2002.

702
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,874
No. He didn't kill you before, why
would he kill you now?

703
01:02:13,944 --> 01:02:17,641
He's already changed history, Betsy.
Last time I came back, you were dead.

Dead? Oh...

705
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:24,387
You tried to alter history to save
your husband from dying in the war.

706
01:02:24,455 --> 01:02:26,980
Ryan, my husband did die in the war.

707
01:02:27,057 --> 01:02:31,323
In this time line. But in the real
time line, there was no war.

708
01:02:31,395 --> 01:02:35,331
You gotta believe me, Betsy.

709
01:02:35,399 --> 01:02:41,304
Listen to me. You're the one
who always said to me that if
a timecop does his job right,

710
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:44,499
no one knows if
he got it right except him.

711
01:02:44,575 --> 01:02:50,536
This same timecop would also be the
only one to know if he got it wrong.

712

This one got by me, Bets.

[Chiming]

737
01:04:55,205 --> 01:04:57,833
There are far too many
variables, Mr. Miller,

738
01:04:57,908 --> 01:05:01,708
to theorize what might have
happened historically,

739
01:05:01,745 --> 01:05:03,303
had events played out differently.

740
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:06,941
I'm not theorizing, Professor Chan.
I'm just saying if time travel is possible,

741
01:05:07,017 --> 01:05:10,509
we have a moral obligation
to right the wrongs of the past.

742
01:05:10,587 --> 01:05:16,548
So are you suggesting that if it were
possible to change historic events, we should?

743
01:05:16,627 --> 01:05:18,686
[Laughing]
Yes, absolutely.

744
01:05:18,762 --> 01:05:20,957
Without knowing
the results of those changes?

745
01:05:21,031 --> 01:05:24,523
Changes that would have a profound
effect on our world as we know it.

746
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:27,966
I don't see the problem with that, as
long as the changes are for the better.

747
01:05:28,038 --> 01:05:30,836
All right.
Let's run with your idea.

748
01:05:30,908 --> 01:05:36,847
Let's say hypothetically that we do
go back in time to make things right.

749
01:05:36,914 --> 01:05:41,817
Whose moral guidelines are we
working within? Yours? Mine?

750
01:05:41,885 --> 01:05:44,410
What happens if we have
a difference of opinion?

751
01:05:44,488 --> 01:05:46,422
Whose rules are we playing by?

752
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:49,755
I think we all share a common
ground morally and ethically,

753
01:05:49,793 --> 01:05:51,658
so some good would come out of it.

754
01:05:51,728 --> 01:05:55,220
What's the point of researching time
travel, if not to right the wrongs?

755
01:05:55,299 --> 01:05:58,097
We're historians, right?

756
01:05:58,168 --> 01:06:01,569
Wouldn't you like
to observe history firsthand,

757
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:04,368
be there to authenticate
history's accuracy?

758
01:06:04,441 --> 01:06:06,033
Yeah, that'd be cool.

759
01:06:06,109 --> 01:06:10,045
But to stand around and do nothing
seems like a colossal waste of knowledge.

760
01:06:10,113 --> 01:06:14,277
I mean, can I at least stop the guys
from flying the planes into the buildings?

761
01:06:14,351 --> 01:06:18,253
Or the fanatic from walking into
a restaurant wearing a bomb?

762
01:06:18,322 --> 01:06:23,555
As much as we all wish those horrific events
never happened, the fact is they did.

763
01:06:23,627 --> 01:06:25,561
Then let's prevent them
from happening.

764
01:06:25,629 --> 01:06:28,564
But we are who we are today
because of them.

765
01:06:28,632 --> 01:06:34,434
Our anger, our compassion,
our awareness, our knowledge.

766
01:06:34,504 --> 01:06:38,941
We alter history, it all changes...
good and bad.

767
01:06:39,009 --> 01:06:42,911
[Sighs]
Yeah, I... I guess so.

768
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:46,143
Think about it.

769
01:06:48,218 --> 01:06:50,778
[Chiming]

770
01:06:50,854 --> 01:06:53,152
We'll have to pick
this up next week.

771
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:08,665
[Woman Laughing]

772
01:07:08,739 --> 01:07:11,264
So, who wants ice cream?

773
01:07:11,341 --> 01:07:15,778
[Young Ryan]
I do, but I have to go
to the rest room first.

774
01:07:15,846 --> 01:07:17,814
- You do?
- Yeah.

775
01:07:17,881 --> 01:07:19,815
- We'll be just a minute.
- I'll wait here.

776
01:07:19,883 --> 01:07:21,817
Come on, then.

777
01:07:21,885 --> 01:07:25,116
- See you next week, Professor.
- Good debate today.

778
01:07:25,188 --> 01:07:27,247
- Thanks. Hey, Ryan.
- Hi.

779
01:07:49,946 --> 01:07:51,937
Come on, Ryan.
You okay?

780
01:07:52,015 --> 01:07:55,007
Yeah. Come on.
It's cool.

781
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:04,055
I'll be back as soon as I can.

782
01:08:10,867 --> 01:08:13,563
[Sasha]
What's wrong, baby?

783
01:08:13,637 --> 01:08:16,367
Hold on a second.
I'll be right back.

784
01:08:19,142 --> 01:08:21,076
- You gonna be quick?
- Yeah.

785
01:08:21,144 --> 01:08:23,009
All right.

786
01:08:42,466 --> 01:08:46,232
Hello, Professor.
It's good to see you again.

787
01:08:48,638 --> 01:08:51,766
Miller?
What the hell is this?

788
01:08:51,842 --> 01:08:57,144
What I would give to be able to sit
and talk with you...

789
01:08:57,214 --> 01:08:59,239
knowing what I know now.

790
01:08:59,316 --> 01:09:01,841
Why do you look so different?

791
01:09:01,918 --> 01:09:04,716
Shh.

792
01:09:04,788 --> 01:09:08,884
- I have an appointment with your son.
- Ryan?

793
01:09:08,959 --> 01:09:10,722
[Professor Chan]
What are you doing?

794
01:09:10,794 --> 01:09:13,354
[Miller]
Come out, come out wherever you are.

795
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:17,196
No. No!

796
01:09:22,506 --> 01:09:28,274
- Miller, what are you...
- Professor, I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this.

797
01:09:28,345 --> 01:09:31,041
[Buzzing]
[Gasps]

798
01:09:39,856 --> 01:09:43,883
[Chiming]

799
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:47,487
Oh, my God.
What did you do to him?

800
01:09:49,699 --> 01:09:52,395
You'll figure it out one day.

801
01:09:56,006 --> 01:09:59,134
I can kill him before you can
even get into that stall.

802
01:09:59,209 --> 01:10:01,803
You'd be altering history.

803
01:10:01,878 --> 01:10:06,815
You'd be going against
everything you stand for.

804
01:10:06,883 --> 01:10:12,844
Oh, but it's different when it
affects you personally, right?

805
01:10:12,923 --> 01:10:16,120
You fucking hypocrite.

806
01:10:17,594 --> 01:10:22,156
Go on. Go on. Do it.

807
01:10:22,232 --> 01:10:24,530
You kill him, you kill me.

808
01:10:24,601 --> 01:10:26,694
Your father never dies.

809
01:10:32,509 --> 01:10:36,570
Something to think about, isn't it?

810
01:10:36,646 --> 01:10:39,206
The ultimate validation.

811
01:10:39,282 --> 01:10:42,149
This is between you and me.

812
01:10:44,554 --> 01:10:45,384
Attaboy.

813
01:10:49,759 --> 01:10:52,523
Come on, Ryan.
Let's see what you got.

814
01:11:08,878 --> 01:11:11,904
Let's put an end to it all right here.
Come on, baby!

815
01:11:11,982 --> 01:11:14,382
Don't let me down.

816
01:11:16,219 --> 01:11:18,517
Yes.

817
01:11:29,566 --> 01:11:32,729
You spent your entire life
playing by the rules.

818
01:11:32,802 --> 01:11:35,999
What have you got to show for it?
Nothing.

819
01:11:40,877 --> 01:11:43,175
Sasha.

820
01:11:43,246 --> 01:11:47,205
Oh, my beautiful Sasha.

821
01:11:47,284 --> 01:11:51,812
You are looking at the man that took
two years of our life away from us.

822
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:56,750
You tell her what you did to her.
You tell her!

823
01:11:58,828 --> 01:12:00,352
I didn't want it to be this way.

824
01:12:01,698 --> 01:12:04,030
I gave you every opportunity.

825
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:15,637
Come on!

826
01:12:15,712 --> 01:12:18,374
Thattaboy. I knew you
wouldn't let me down.

827
01:14:00,917 --> 01:14:02,350
Yes.

828
01:14:48,631 --> 01:14:54,035
It doesn't have to be this way.
You can change all this.

829
01:15:06,516 --> 01:15:11,920
[Coughing, Gasping]

830
01:15:36,012 --> 01:15:38,879
[Ryan Narrating]
History is being
altered every second,

831
01:15:38,948 --> 01:15:42,315
by a look, a simple gesture...

832
01:15:42,385 --> 01:15:46,321
or that unintentional
footprint left in the sand.

833
01:15:46,389 --> 01:15:51,656
All secrets hidden in time,
locked in time.

834
01:15:51,728 --> 01:15:56,927
[Chiming]
And unless you were there,
you'll never know the truth.

835
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:08,239
There you are.
I've been looking everywhere
for you. Where've you been?

836
01:16:08,311 --> 01:16:10,279
Around.

837
01:16:10,346 --> 01:16:12,541
- You okay?
- Yeah.

838
01:16:12,615 --> 01:16:15,243
You look like you've been on one
too many jumps this month.

839
01:16:15,318 --> 01:16:17,286
You got that right.

840
01:16:17,353 --> 01:16:21,380
Hey, Jeffers,
it's good to see you.

841
01:16:23,593 --> 01:16:25,527
Kiss my ass, Ryan.

842
01:16:25,595 --> 01:16:28,393
[Chuckles]

843
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:34,601
Hey, Ryan.

844
01:16:37,674 --> 01:16:41,041
Hey, Edwards.

845
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:45,274
Damn it, O'Rourke, you are not giving
these guys enough turn around time.

846
01:16:45,348 --> 01:16:49,409
We're suspending them in their
own reality, and ripping them
back and forth through time.

847
01:16:49,485 --> 01:16:52,818
I just got the results of Casey's CAT scan.
That's a cerebral hemorrhage.

848
01:16:52,889 --> 01:16:55,687
It's your responsibility
to start reigning these guys in.

849
01:16:55,758 --> 01:16:59,216
- Will you give it a rest, Doc?
- Give it a rest?

850
01:16:59,295 --> 01:17:02,731
And you were supposed to check
in with me as soon as you got back.

851
01:17:02,799 --> 01:17:05,097
I think I like you better
with the lip ring.

852
01:17:05,168 --> 01:17:07,864
- Lip ring?
- Where the hell have you been?

853
01:17:07,937 --> 01:17:11,168
- Saving the world.
- [Chuckles]

854
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,437
You still want me
to give it a rest?

855
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:18,344
- Just put it in your report.
- We still on for tonight?

856
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,445
- I don't date...
- Timecops.

857
01:17:22,518 --> 01:17:27,421
- I know. 8:00?
- 8:00.

858

[Alarm Beeping]

859

We have a Time breach in progress.

* You're light, euphoric *

861

01:17:49,846 --> 01:17:51,837

* You're supersonic *

* I weathered through this time *

867
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:10,362
* The force erratic *

01:18:10,433 --> 01:18:13,800
* Like a deuce from a laser storm *

* The sound subsonic *

01:18:17,807 --> 01:18:21,243
* Like a car crash in the rain *

871
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:24,973
* Your karma is solid *

872
01:18:25,048 --> 01:18:27,516
* You gotta wonder
It's all your own *

* Heaven knows

* Still I felt so right *

* I've never known before *

877
01:18:47,904 --> 01:18:51,499
* Never felt so right *

01:18:51,574 --> 01:18:54,839
* Never felt so right *

* Your thigh, your hips *

881
01:19:16,966 --> 01:19:20,367
* Like a meltdown power zone *

882
01:19:20,436 --> 01:19:22,370
* Pressed on me *

883
01:19:22,438 --> 01:19:26,169
* Like the very thought of it all *

884
01:19:26,242 --> 01:19:29,541
* Like a voice in a hurricane *

885
01:19:29,612 --> 01:19:33,673

* The source, excited *

888
01:19:41,023 --> 01:19:44,390
* Like life on a runaway train *
