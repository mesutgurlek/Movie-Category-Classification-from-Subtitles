00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,373
Dr. Cocteau is the most important
man in San Angeles.

799
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:58,168
He practically created
our whole way of life, savage.

800
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,712
Yeah? Well, he can have it.

801
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,883
Phoenix could be anywhere,
but not being coded could limit him.

802
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,637
Correct. Money is outmoded.
All transactions are through codes.

803
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,890
So he can't buy food
or a place to stay for the night.

804
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,727
It'd be a waste of time to mug somebody.

805
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,771
Unless he rips off someone's hand.

806
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,733
But with all officers patrolling
in a citywide crisis net...

807
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,901
...should be a matter of tick-tocks
before--

808
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:26,613
More importantly,
we already have a backup plan.

809
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:30,659
We can just wait
for another code to go red.

810
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,537
When Phoenix performs another
MurderDeathKill...

811
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,707
...we'll know exactly where to pounce.

812
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,584

for quite some time.

815

In fact, I perused some newsreels from
the Schwarzenegger Library. That time--

816
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,516

Yes, the Schwarzenegger

Wasn't he an actor when--?

820
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,442
- Stop. He was president?
- Yes.

821
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:08,447
Even though he wasn't a native,
his popularity caused the 61st Amendment--

822
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,574
I don't want to know.

anyway?

831

He says I saved his life,
which I'm not sure I did.

832
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,832
My reward is dinner and dancing
