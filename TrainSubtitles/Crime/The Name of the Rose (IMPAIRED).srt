I trust my words did not offend you,
Brother William...

...but I heard persons laughing
at laughable things.

341

You Franciscans, however,

St. Francis was much disposed

Laughter is a devilish wind...

There is nothing in the scriptures

Nothing in the scriptures

Even the saints have
employed comedy...

354

...to ridicule the enemies of the faith.

355
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:11,274
For example, when the pagans plunged
St. Maurus into the boiling water...

356
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:16,363
...he complained his bath was too cold.
The sultan put his hand in, scalded it.

357
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:22,702
A saint immersed in boiling water
does not play childish tricks.

He restrains his cries
and suffers for the truth.

359
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,628
And yet, Aristotle devoted
his second book of Poetics...

00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:36,133
...to comedy as an instrument of truth.

- No, it has not. It was never written.

Because providence doesn't want

00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,131
You are in love.

Is that bad?

483
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,680
For a monk,
it does present certain problems.

484
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:50,643
But doesn't St. Thomas Aquinas
praise love above all other virtues?

485
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:55,856
Yes. The love of God, Adso.
The love of God.

486
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:03,489
And the love of woman?

487
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:08,327
Of woman, Thomas Aquinas
knew precious little.

488
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,955
But the scriptures are very clear.

489
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:15,834
Proverbs warns us, "Woman takes
possession of a man's precious soul."

490
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:22,091
While Ecclesiastes tells us,
"More bitter than death is woman."

491
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,594
Yes, but...

Of course, I don't have
the benefit of your experience.

494

But I find it difficult
to convince myself...

495
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:44,113
...that God would have introduced
such a foul being into creation...

496
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:49,702
...without endowing her
with some virtues. Hmm?

497
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:56,959
How peaceful life would be
without love, Adso.

UBERTINO:

The only evidence
I see of the devil...

And how do we know that?
Because those random notes...

576

...overrun Adelmo's blue smudge,
and not vice versa.

Someone was at great pains to conceal
a secret of the first magnitude.

01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:31,288
Now, the calligraphy is,
without question, left-handed.

Now, what kind of secret knowledge
would he have been privy to?

586
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:47,512
I have the feeling that
you're about to tell me.

587
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,182

01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:53,810
Spiritually dangerous books.

01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:58,356
Everyone here knew of the assistant
librarian's passion for handsome boys.

590
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:02,402
When the beautiful Adelmo wanted
to read such a forbidden book...

591
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,822
...Berengar offered Adelmo
the key to its whereabouts...

592
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:09,075
...enciphered on that parchment...

593
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:14,498
...in exchange for unnatural caresses.
- Enough, Brother William!

594
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:19,002
Adelmo agreed and duly submitted
to Berengar's lustful advances.

595
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,713
Afterwards, wracked by remorse,
he wandered...

596
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:26,343
...crying and desperate in the graveyard,
where he met the Greek translator.

597
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:29,596
- How could you know this?
- There was a witness.

598
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,640
The hunchback...

599
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:36,478
...who saw Adelmo giving
this parchment to Venantius.

600
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:41,650
Then running towards the small tower
and hurling himself out of the window.

601
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:45,779
The night of my arrival, while
Berengar punished his sinful flesh...

602
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:49,574
...Venantius, helped by the coded
instructions on the parchment...

603
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:53,703
...made his way into the forbidden
library and found the book.

604
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:58,416
He took it back to his desk
in the scriptorium and began to read it.

605
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,628
After scribbling down
those few mysterious quotations...

606
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:04,673
...he died with a black stain
on his finger.

607
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:08,385
The assistant librarian
discovered the body...

608
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:13,723
...and dragged it down to the pigpens
to avert suspicion falling on him.

609
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:16,893
But he left his autograph behind.

610
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:19,813
The book remained
on the translator's desk.

611
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:23,149
Berengar returned there
last night and read it.

612
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:27,237
Soon after, overcome
by some agonizing pain...

613
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:32,409
...he tried to take a soothing bath
with lime leaves and drowned.

614
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,078
He, too, had a blackened finger.

615
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:38,748
All three died because
of a book which kills...

616
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,876
...or for which men will kill.

617
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:45,630
