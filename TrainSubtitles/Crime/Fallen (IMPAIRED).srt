You answer the quest--

If I don't know what's going on--

775
01:03:05,158 --> 01:03:06,451
Okay, okay.

776
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:09,328
That's good. That's a start.
They don't even exist.

777
01:03:09,537 --> 01:03:11,664
So where are they from?
Who the hell are they?

778
01:03:11,873 --> 01:03:15,501
Mr. Hobbes,
there are certain phenomena...

779
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:19,130
...which can only be explained
if there is a God...

780
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:22,550
...and if there are angels.
And there are. They exist.

781
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:24,594
Some of these angels were cast down.

782
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:27,805
And a few of the fallen were punished
by being deprived of form.

783
01:03:28,014 --> 01:03:31,350
They can only survive in the bodies
of others. It's inside of us.

784
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:34,312
Inside of human beings,
their vengeance is played out.

785
01:03:37,857 --> 01:03:39,317
That's it?

786
01:03:40,151 --> 01:03:41,777
Come on, get out of here.

787
01:03:42,612 --> 01:03:43,863
I mean, come on. What--?

788
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,157
I mean...

789
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:48,367
Miss Milano, I'm just a cop, okay?

790
01:03:48,618 --> 01:03:52,371
I'm a detective.
My work is based upon evidence, facts.

791
01:03:52,622 --> 01:03:54,332
Mine too. Mine too.

792
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:58,878
And aren't your facts here
rather resistant to normal interpretation?

793
01:04:00,505 --> 01:04:04,008
So you're saying
that Edgar Reese is actually--

794
01:04:04,217 --> 01:04:06,886
At the time you knew him,
he was not himself.

795
01:04:07,136 --> 01:04:09,222
- He was Azazel?
- Yes, Azazel.

797
01:04:12,266 --> 01:04:14,852
Reese? Why does he focus in on me?

798
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:17,688
You got his attention
so he tried to get inside you.

799
01:04:17,897 --> 01:04:18,981
He shook your hand.

800
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:22,985
That didn't work, so now he's gonna try
and find some other way.

801
01:04:24,946 --> 01:04:27,031

Okay.

803
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:37,166
How do we fight him?
Is it even possible?

804
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,293
I believe it is. And I'm not alone.

805
01:04:40,086 --> 01:04:43,422
There's a network. I don't even know
who they are. I just have numbers.

806
01:04:43,631 --> 01:04:45,258
Okay, these people know the--

807
01:04:45,466 --> 01:04:48,928
We believe that God limited demons
and made them mortal...

808
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:51,180
...and he put a few of us here
to fight them.

809
01:04:51,806 --> 01:04:55,184
Us? Us who? Who us?

810
01:04:55,393 --> 01:04:57,436
You saying me? I'm one of these people?

811
01:04:57,603 --> 01:05:01,023
Ha. I don't know. Maybe, maybe not.

Okay. Touché.

814
01:05:07,363 --> 01:05:09,532
So these demons are mortal.
They can be killed.

- Who?
