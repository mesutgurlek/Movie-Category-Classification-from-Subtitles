1
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,200
Please God, help me.

2
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,365
Please God, help me.

3
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,814
(muffled) Oh, you're already
back, John?

4
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,775
Oh-oh. What did our
boys break this time?

5
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,361
(Man) John!

6
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,656
(phone rings)

7
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,053
Let's go in my office.

8
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,850
John, the reason I called you here".
take a seat will you?

9
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,152
Reverend Beaumont dropped by
a little while ago.

10
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,414
He said your daughter is living
in his church. Since when?

11
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,955
Since Tuesday.

12
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,415
This is very awkward.

13
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,797
He gave me this.

14
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,883
She signed it.

15
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,319
-(officer) ls there a problem, Boss?
- Shh,

16
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,979
(phone rings)

17
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,919
This is Detective Bruce Kenner.
It is October

18
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,930
the 14th, 1990.
State your full name.

19
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,511
- John Gray.
- And your occupation.

20
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,096
Auto mechanic.

21
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,729
Okay, well you already know me,
I already know you so...

22
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,859
...why don't we not play any games and you
can start by telling me why you're here.

23
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,863
Well I'm... I'm really confused
and I've been thinking about...

24
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,867
I've been thinking about this
all night. And I've been praying.

25
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,494
- Does that help? Praying?
- Yeah. Yeah,

26
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,369
But I don't know, you see.

27
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,251
Part of me says it's impossible.

28
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,622
I... I don't remember anything.

29
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,083
It's just impossible.

30
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,428
All right, well then
what is the other part say?

31
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,554
Some things are obvious.

32
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,476
Such as?

33
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,397
First of all I'm completely sure
about one thing.

34
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,691
Angela never lies.

35
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,825
She'd never do that.
Her mother was just like her, a saint.

36
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,112
And I don't know, Little details
like not hugging or kissing me.

37
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,952
So she's...
she's been avoiding you?

38
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,661
Yeah.

39
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,703
And then... also the”.

40
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,416
John.

41
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,336
Cut the shit,
take your hat off first of all.

42
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,297
- What?
- Take your hat off.

43
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,055
Why do you think she
was avoiding you, John?

44
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,809
Cause I did it.

45
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,313
I did it.

46
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,077
He admits it, but he doesn't remember
doing it? I don't get it.

47
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:04,911
He's just stalling for time. I need to talk
to the girl as soon as possible.

48
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,292
Reverend says she
doesn't want to see anybody.

49
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,545
Well I don't care about the Reverend,
right. We need a psychologist,

50
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,957
- A psychologist?
- We need a good one.

51
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,047
Lean on him until he breaks, Do your thing.

52
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,882
It's child abuse, Chief.

53
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,718
(Cries)

54
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,223
Mrs. Gray.

55
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,736
I'll make you some tea, okay?

56
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,902
Mrs. Gray.

57
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,738
Did you know?

58
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,164
The Reverend called me and told me.

59
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,954
But I...

60
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,005
I talked to my son, and”.

61
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,750
He flew into a rage. He denied everything.

62
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,887
Reverend, please...
I need to see her.

63
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,799
We've already discussed that, Rose.

64
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,681
She'd rather stay at the church.

65
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,848
Mrs. Gray. You think it would all right if
I went, took a look at Angela's room?

66
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,608
-It's upstairs.
- Thank you'

67
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,985
It's the last door.

68
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,993
- What?
-It's the last door.

69
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,411
(cat meows)

70
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,911
(slow piano music)

71
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,567
(door is blown by the wind)

72
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,000
Hey Bruce.

73
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,752
This isn't right, we
need a warrant.

74
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,668
She gave us permission. Are you asleep?
Where's the son?

75
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,838
Roy? He left two years ago.

76
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,262
Where'd he go?

77
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,308
You don't know?

78
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,311
You're friends with the family and
you don't know where he went?

79
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,152
They've suffered a lot,
I wouldn't bring that up.

80
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,942
Mrs. Gray.

81
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,821
Have you heard from your grandson?

82
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:18,790
Not really. He calls sometimes
to say he's okay.

83
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,874
But...

84
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:25,008
Why did he leave? You think
he was running from his father?

85
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,762
I asked my son last night.

86
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,467
And what did he say?

87
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,382
He took my hand“.

88
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,138
And...

89
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,891
we prayed.

90
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,365
<i>(radio) It's not an urban legend.
The Satanists are living among us.</i>

91
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,367
<i>Like any religious group,
they worship their lord,</i>

92
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:55,952
<i>he Devil, and perform horrible rituals.
The question we should ask ourselves...</i>

93
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,833
How can you listen to this right now.
Can I tum it off?

94
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,211
No, turn it off.
It's your car.

95
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:09,170
John... I knew he had problems
but molesting his daughter?

96
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,380
- I can't believe it.
- Why not?

97
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,175
Because you both go to the same church?

98
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,980
What if? I mean what if...
...it was a caress'

99
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,766
A show of affection?

100
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,529
His daughter exaggerated it.
She's kind of difficult.

101
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,860
Really?
That's not what I hear.

102
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,984
- Said she's a little shy,
- I saw her grow up, Bruce.

103
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,448
You've seen that house,
you've seen the way that they live.

104
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,616
On top of that,
she lost her mom.

105
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,044
She's had a pretty shitty life.

106
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,208
Maybe she just”.

107
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,296
Wanted to get away from it all.
I don't know.

108
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,555
Well still, I mean you really think
a seventeen year old girl is going to...

109
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:58,264
...put her dad in prison just because
she wants to change her life?

110
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,561
We can't rule that out.

111
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,514
Right?

112
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,359
Yeah right, can't rule it out.

113
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,781
The boy calls his grandmother from a bar.

114
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,242
Trace one of those calls damn it.

115
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,199
Don't call me again until you find him.

116
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,543
Well?

117
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,126
Well umm..

118
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:32,173
- His mental state appears to be normal.
- I already told you that.

119
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,804
Big question is, why the sudden amnesia?

120
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,092
No one's going to believe him.
Bruce. Mr. Raines is here.

121
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,352
Don't think he's after anything.

122
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,511
What?

123
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,806
If he doesn't want a lawyer, then he isn't

124
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,600
drying to protect himself, right?
- I don't understand.

125
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,734
- Bruce!
- Yeah, I'm right here.

126
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:52,443
Say that again, professor, will ya.
I'm a bit of a dummy sometimes.

127
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,358
I don't think what John is doing
is a strategy,

128
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,654
on the contrary I think
he's trying to cooperate.

129
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,541
He keeps saying: I think I did it'
But speaks like he wasn't there.

130
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,952
And to a certain
extent, he wasn't.

131
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:10,256
See this is a man who has spent years
trying to stop drinking.

132
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,885
And he does ii by giving in to faith
which is an explosive combination.

133
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:18,389
Because on the one hand,
he goes too far, does awful things.

134
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,933
On the other hand he can't live
with the awful things he's done. So now...

135
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,518
...he can't find them in his head.

136
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,445
- He can't find them?
- He's repressed them.

137
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,571
The memories are behind some doors.

138
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:39,328
It's not that difficult to find a key
and free them. Provoke a regression.

139
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:43,240
Look, I'm not an expert.
But, I don't know.

140
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:47,036
- This all seems a little...
- It seems a little strange, doesn't it?

141
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:52,708
I suppose umm... I often tell my students
that the mind is a whole universe.

142
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,802
I read an article about this.

143
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,010
Regressive hypnosis has made
great progress, gentlemen,

144
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,804
Anyway, I hope you didn't...

145
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:07,351
...interrupt my classes,
to discuss these topics with me.

146
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,104
Or did you?

147
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,570
(clicking)

148
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,279
I've been very confused ever since.

149
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,991
My father ordered me
not to tell anyone.

150
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,249
He said, be a good girl and the Lord
will watch over you.

151
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,127
But I know this is wrong.

152
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:33,749
He touches me and forces me
to have sex with him'

153
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,094
I'm scared,
I don't know if I should.

154
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,426
Okay. John, again.
Concentrate

155
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,140
on the first sentence. Last year
my father started coming into my room.

156
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,393
Last year...

157
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,729
Remember what I said, John,
let the pendulum clear your mind.

158
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,651
Look through it.

159
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,615
This is no use.

160
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,906
How long are we going to keep doing this?

161
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,746
Just one more time.
Let yourself go.

162
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,755
I want you to relax every muscle
in your body'

163
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,673
Third sentence.

164
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:22,006
My father ordered me not to tell anyone.
He said, be a good girl

165
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,173
and the Lord will
watch over you.

166
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,640
...and the Lord will watch over you.
Yes, I said that,

167
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,770
I said that to her plenty of times.
But...

168
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,603
He touches me and forces me
to have sex with him'

169
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,607
Your daughter wrote this, Right?
You realize that?

170
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,614
It's her handwriting, John.

171
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,993
You yourself said, your
daughter never lies,

172
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,780
No, she would never lie.
She would never lie to me.

173
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,415
Well she must be, and
if you don't remember it...

174
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,418
Oh God! God please...

175
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,543
- Oh God help me I”.
-(Raines) John.

176
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,795
(Raines) John.

177
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,838
(Raines) Behind the pendulum...

178
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,596
Right behind...

179
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,942
Oh wait, wait-wait-wait.

180
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,323
I think I see something.

181
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,284
Okay, John, Tell us what you see.

182
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,701
I see <i>. .</i> . . ..is it my house?
And I'm moving.

183
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,919
Jesus. Jesus it's just like I was there.

184
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,881
(Raines) Just read it again, please.

185
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:43,803
(Bruce) Last year, my father
started coming into my room.

186
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,886
I've been very confused ever since.

187
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,346
He touches me and
forces me to have sex with him.

188
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,231
I see her.
She's sitting there on the bed.

189
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,642
(John moans)

190
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,899
I'm on top of her, Jesus!

191
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,107
- God no!
-(Bruce) What are you doing to her?

192
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,619
I tied her hands to the
headboard.

193
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,529
You're tying her'?
Can you see the rope?

194
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,369
Yeah.“ Yeah it's a rope.
It's a black rope.

195
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,417
Why is it black? Is it some type of ritual?

196
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,460
Hold on' Hold on. Now he's".
I'm tying her feet!

197
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,130
Wait, wait. You said "he".
Where are you watching this from?

198
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,637
I'm right there,
I'm standing right (here by the bed.

199
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,761
- Are you seeing yourself?
- I guess. It has to be me, right?

200
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,396
No, that's somebody else.
Focus on the face.

201
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,149
Why! Then why aren't I stopping it?

202
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,309
What the hell am I doing there!

203
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,945
Somebody you let in,
somebody you must know.

204
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,277
Why aren't I stopping
it! Jesus!

205
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,192
- Angela!
- A face, John' It's someone you know.

206
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,488
I don't know who it is!
It could be anybody!

207
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,998
Who has been in your
house in the last year?

208
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,329
- You know who it is, John...
- Detective...

209
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,750
I guess... I'm holding a camera...

210
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,762
I'm taking pictures!

211
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,390
Hold on just a second”.
I see... I think I see.

212
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,224
It's George!

213
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,014
George Nesbitt?

214
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,478
- Okay...
- George Nesbitt?

215
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,656
(car horn)
Hey George!

216
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,744
Hey George.

217
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,449
Hey Bruce. How'd it go with John?

218
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,084
Where you doing?

219
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,165
Where do you think?
My shift is over.

220
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,085
Is there a problem?

221
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,888
Your name came up.

222
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,686
My name?

223
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,356
What'd he say?

224
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:10,700
You tell me, huh George.
You tell me.

225
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,290
What if I told you I just looked at all the
photos. Would you tell me you did it then?

226
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,543
- We have the photos.
- If you showed me.

227
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,631
(whispers) Oh I get it...

228
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,848
Wail a minute, no. I'm not sure".
This is all really weird.

229
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:38,011
Five minutes ago I would have
never believed it. Now I wanna kill you.

230
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,896
- Give me your gun,
- Bruce, take it easy okay.

231
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,149
I am taking it easy.
Give me your gun'

232
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,854
What photos“.

233
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,565
Now you don't know what
I'm talking about huh'?

234
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,230
- Fuck!
- Son of a bitch!

235
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,995
Oh please, Give me a break,
you assaulted him without saying a word.

236
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:04,162
I would never do that Katie,
and you know that, You know he's lying.

237
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,127
That's enough.
Nesbitt is my client now.

238
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,630
And that whole (hing
about the photos,

239
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:14,514
if you had them, you'd already
have shown them to me, don't you think?

240
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,717
So who's the one lying here, Bruce?

241
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,601
Without saying a word...
Do you hear this bull shit, Chief?

242
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:26,142
We need to talk to the girl,
If she identifies him.

243
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,357
Just hold your horses.

244
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,439
Sometimes I wish I was like you, Bruce.

245
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,152
For me this is all”.

246
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,743
Nesbitt was one of our own.

247
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,370
Just remember that, okay.
Take your psychologist.

248
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,079
Thanks Chief.

249
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,250
We're leaving.

250
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,939
You suspected Nesbitt
before John said his name, why?

251
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,326
There was something off about him.
lam a Detective, Professor'

252
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,954
I see' Nevertheless,

253
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,621
But please do not interfere
with my therapy again.

254
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,254
You and your people can ask him
anything you like. But after that”.

255
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,005
...it's my turn.

256
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,158
Oh hey, Hello Angela.

257
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,076
My name's Bruce. Bruce Kenner.
Please, have a seat.

258
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,587
We actually met before once
in your father's workshop'

259
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,004
You wouldn't remember,
you were.” smaller.

260
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:25,224
We just want to have a little chat. This is
Professor Raines. He's our psychologist.

261
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,599
(whispers) Angela, do you want me to stay?

262
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,567
We're just going to ask
you a few questions.

263
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,280
I'm not crazy.

264
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,904
No, of course not.

265
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:51,045
The reason I'm asking
so many questions is because...

266
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,833
We know there was
someone else in the room.

267
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,340
Your father told us.

268
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,049
But why?

269
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,099
Why did he say that?

270
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:07,137
I need you to look at
these photos closely.

271
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,930
I don't want to go on
with this,

272
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,394
Angela. These people hurt you.

273
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,150
And they could hurt
someone else.

274
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,281
Your father said something about a ritual?
What's all that about?

275
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,075
Would you like to write it down?
Sometimes that helps.

276
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,548
Alone.
I want to do it alone.

277
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,800
Okay'-

278
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,471
She was always sad.

279
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,891
Like she was shutting herself in.

280
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,062
It was in one of our seminars.

281
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,482
(woman) ...stay away from me
Satan, I have Jesus.

282
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,610
She just started crying all of a sudden.

283
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,863
Then I realized”.

284
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,829
It was like, like God
had spoken to me'

285
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,873
I'd prefer to call that intuition,
Reverend,

286
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,961
Call it whatever you want.
But I knew it was her father.

287
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,844
And that it had happened
more than once.

288
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,418
Angela?

289
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,545
These things they did to you?

290
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,260
When they summoned the Devil.

291
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,268
Who else was there with your father?

292
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,104
Could you please tell me?
His name?

293
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,044
You did great.

294
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,507
(Cries)

295
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,928
(indistinctive chatter)

296
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,223
I'm afraid I don't know
anything about Satanism.

297
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,934
Are you a man of faith?

298
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,274
I'm afraid I'm in no mood
to answer that question.

299
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:06,691
Agnostic. You want to believe,
but you can't.

300
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,202
Don't worry.
I went through that phase myself.

301
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,173
I got a hold of a copy.

302
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,103
You branded her with an inverted cross.

303
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,901
Now I'm starting to understand
why you came to us.

304
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,536
It wasn't to get over
your wife's death.

305
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:58,584
It was to desecrate our church.

306
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,412
Well Reverend,

307
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,168
I...

308
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,918
You don't know what I'm talking about.

309
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:12,552
You don't remember
the insults, or the torture?

310
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,716
Or the excrement or”.

311
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:22,399
Okay John".
Just do us all a favour.

312
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,398
Try.

313
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:44,126
<i>...as pan of a ritual
involving black magic.</i>

314
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:49,044
<i>One of his accomplices could even belong
to the Hoyer Police Department.</i>

315
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,587
<i>And tonight,
don't miss our special segment...</i>

316
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,427
Wonderful. That's what
I call not causing a panic.

317
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,639
<i>...keep the people of
this city in suspense.</i>

318
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,528
(phone rings)

319
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,372
(phone rings)

320
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,837
<i>- Hello?
- It's Cleveland, turn on the TV.</i>

321
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:28,124
Yeah, all right.
What channel?

322
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,303
Yeah. Give me a second.

323
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,894
<i>We used to consider Satanic ritual abuse
something from the middle ages,</i>

324
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,650
<i>or literary fantasy.</i>

325
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:52,361
<i>Bu! in the flask few years.
books like this one have opened our eyes.</i>

326
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:57,866
<i>woman) They branded his sign
on my back, said that I was his sieve.</i>

327
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,332
<i>They made me attend
their ceremonies for 15 years.</i>

328
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,744
<i>One time I even saw
them sacrifice...</i>

329
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,503
Yeah right I'll see you tomorrow.

330
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:11,133
<i>Maybe it's easier to think people
aren't capable of doing things like this.</i>

331
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,798
<i>R's very sad.</i>

332
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:37,322
(sleep talking)

333
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,367
(yells) No! No! I don't want to!

334
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:03,477
Okay, Angela <i>says</i> that
Nesbitt branded this._.

335
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,475
...on her stomach with a knife.

336
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,359
John just corroborated it.
That's not all.

337
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,110
Now he remembers something about
a black cat and someone wearing a hood.

338
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,533
You can imagine what
I'm talking about.

339
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,783
Satanic Ritual Abuse.

340
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,790
How long will you detain
George without any proof?

341
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,203
He's a cop, we can detain him
as long as necessary.

342
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:33,749
Tom. Find this book.
Get everybody a copy.

343
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,386
- Everybody?
- S. Cooper, she was on TV last night.

344
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,093
- Can I make photocopies?
- Just a copy Tom.

345
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,054
We're poor... I had to say it.

346
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:48,268
Boss, I actually read that book'
But it seemed like a pile of trash to me.

347
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,775
Baby sacrifices and snuff movies? Come on.

348
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,901
The FBI would be
all over something like that.

349
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,779
Really? What do you
know about it?

350
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,905
Have you even
bothered to call the FBI?

351
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,609
No, but”.

352
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,871
This case is a little bit more complicated

353
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,703
than taking a stroll
and handing out parking tickets.

354
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:10,453
We have to be on-point.
No mistakes.

355
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,621
Even if it's just this one time.

356
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,836
What's that mean,
just (his one time.

357
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,421
Okay, okay. Enough! Enough!

358
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,254
Go on, get the job done.

359
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:31,060
I thought this was a quiet town.

360
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,272
Keep thinking of my granddaughters, Jesus.

361
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,861
You don't look too good.
You sleepin'?

362
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,660
I just get the feeling
with this case...

363
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,663
- What?
- I don't know.

364
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,867
That look in your eyes scares me.

365
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:55,540
It's a part of something bigger.
You know much bigger,

366
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,295
Charlie, how many times
did I say, knock first.

367
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,884
- Sorry Chief. Ahh, we found him.
- Who?

368
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:07,142
John's son. Roy.
He lives in Pittsburgh.

369
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,769
Okay. Where the hell is Tom?

370
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:14,729
(Cleveland) Ask him, if our department
can afford two plane tickets to Pittsburgh.

371
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:34,002
<i>-(Bruce) Your father told us.
(Angela) Why? Why did he say that?</i>

372
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,005
<i>(Bruce) I need you to look at
these photos closely.</i>

373
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:40,839
<i>-(Angela) I don't want to go on with this.
-(Bruce) Angela, these people hurt you'</i>

374
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:44,881
Do you make your wife listen to this
over and over again?

375
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:52,138
- We're separated.
- Well now you know why.

376
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:15,290
(indistinct chatter)

377
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,963
Hey ROY-

378
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,883
-(Roy) A ritual?
- Yeah.

379
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,057
-It's a great story'
-(Bruce) Does it surprise you?

380
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,435
My father warships the devil?

381
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,397
What would you think?
Good girl.

382
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:39,856
Is that why you ran away?
To get away from him?

383
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,613
- Why don't you ask him.
- I did. That's why I'm here.

384
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,742
What about your mother?
Was she good to you?

385
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,034
Yeah. When she left us.

386
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,246
She killed herself.“ Did you know that?

387
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:59,504
I just know what it said in the report -
a car accident. A lapse at the wheel.

388
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:02,416
My Dad made her life hell for 20 years.

389
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:07,175
He's a drunk, you know,
it's probably not in the report.

390
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:12,184
He got us all involved in that Evangelical
stuff, like that would make things better.

391
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:16,643
Why don't you tell us about that.
What was he like when he drank?

392
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,643
- I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

393
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,901
Why don't you tell me
what he did to you and Angela.

394
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,449
Just forget it, okay.

395
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,736
I understand how these things
might be difficult...

396
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,371
They're things that didn't happen!

397
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:38,748
If they didn't happen, then why
do you need to raise your voice to say it.

398
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,668
You've been through something
very traumatic.

399
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,799
It's quite normal for the
mechanisms in the brain“.

400
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,676
Are you deaf! Huh?

401
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,837
All right, take it easy okay.

402
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,890
Sit down. We're just talking.

403
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,396
Roy, I'm a police officer.

404
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,023
I'm going to tell you
what I'm looking at.

405
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,777
I'm looking at a young man.
Who doesn't speak to his sister.

406
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,065
Doesn't speak to his father.
And is living in an abandoned building.

407
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,112
What's wrong with you?

408
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,825
You need to stop fighting everybody
and find the real enemy,

409
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,866
the person who made you feel
exactly like him.

410
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,409
A loser.

411
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:27,258
I have a very simple
proposition for you, Roy.

412
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:32,014
Let's go back to your bedroom, search your
adolescence, even your childhood.

413
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:37,436
Review all those moments
that were weird.

414
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,980
Weird? What do you mean weird?

415
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,313
We're looking for someone in a hood, Roy.

416
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,902
(kids playing)

417
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,493
(clicking)

418
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,248
(Roy) I hear voices.

419
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,461
Where?

420
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,629
Behind the door.
Whispering.

421
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,308
Which door are you talking about.

422
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,516
It's my old room.

423
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,024
It's opening.

424
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,813
I... I see them.

425
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,985
Wearing hoods.

426
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,197
Can you see your father?

427
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:39,243
I don't know.
I can't make out their faces.

428
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,704
Why not? Make up, maybe?

429
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,331
Yeah.” they look like“. witches.

430
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,835
What are they doing?

431
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,596
Come on, you know.

432
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,090
I don't know”.

433
00:36:57,257 --> 00:37:01,512
It's not what you think Roy.
It's what you don't want to think.

434
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,814
(gasps)

435
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,479
(whispers) I don't know”.

436
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,368
I can't stop...

437
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,709
Something doesn't fit.

438
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:33,260
In his vision, Roy saw himself as a child.
Yes?

439
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,214
And the other sister says the abuse
began only last year.

440
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,759
Yeah but see, for me that's the
typical progressive revelation.

441
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,974
For me, what doesn't fit is
he said there was six

442
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:48,855
people in his room' How do you get six
people in and out of that room without...

443
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,143
The grandmother.

444
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,610
And she had John when she was
barely sixteen years old.

445
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:59,245
Everybody knew she was into some bad stuff,
I see no reason for us to rule her out.

446
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:02,034
Of course I should have realized.

447
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,709
Some of us can use
our heads too, Professor.

448
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,609
- What is the meaning of all this!
- Mrs. Gray!

449
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,490
- You already searched the house yesterday.
- Rose. Rose.

450
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:40,402
- Today they're destroying it!
- You need to stay calm.

451
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,196
- Nobody has explained anything to me,
- Rose! Rose! Listen to ma!

452
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,324
None of this is necessary. All right.

453
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,961
I'll talk to Brody and right now we'll
get these men out of your house.

454
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,588
Yeah? Well then why don't you?

455
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,965
You know where the photographs are.

456
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,013
I talked to Roy and he told us.

457
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:08,726
You're lying!
(yells) You are lying!

458
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,067
My Grandson didn't...

459
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,948
(wails)

460
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,327
She's been drinking.

461
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,121
<i>Haw you Gain' boss'?</i>

462
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,957
Listen, Brody and I are
going bowling later.

463
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,794
You should join us.
Gonna blow off some steam.

464
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,508
What?

465
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,595
You need to disconnect, Boss.

466
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:50,768
Yeah, no thanks boys.
Don't you disconnect too much all right?

467
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,653
Are you a police officer?

468
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,358
Yes.

469
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,452
Did you sexually abuse Angela Gray?

470
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,617
No.

471
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,750
- Is today Friday?
- Yes.

472
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,671
- Did you sexually abuse Roy Gray.
- No.

473
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,218
An FBI report.

474
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,759
I hate it when you're always right.

475
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,436
This could be huge Bruce.

476
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,810
A cult of Satanists.

477
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:38,896
They've suspected it for seven years.
Ever since the book came out.

478
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:48,368
They shelved it last month,
can you believe it? I mean, take a look.

479
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,035
Rumours about rituals everywhere,
like they're connected.

480
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,954
But not a shred of evidence what-so-ever.

481
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,212
We'll find the proof.

482
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:01,547
Kate just called me,
if we don't find something,

483
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:05,343
-we're going to have to release him.
- What? Nesbitt?

484
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:06,848
It's the law, Bruce.

485
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:11,512
You mean that this guy is part of a
Satanic cult and we're going to let him go?

486
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:13,271
<i>Do you know any pornographic
pictures of Angela Gray?</i>

487
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,727
- No.
- You're lying!

488
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,317
(phone rings)

489
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,945
Kenner speaking.

490
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:25,192
All we tried to do was
lift her shin and she panicked.

491
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:35,623
Hey Angela, it's Bruce. Bruce Kenner.
Will you open the door'?

492
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,312
Listen, Doctor just wants to
inspect your mark.

493
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,310
What's the problem?

494
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,562
- Would you prefer if it was a female?
-It's not that,

495
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,484
What is it?

496
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,609
Tell me, what is it?

497
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,826
If I show it to you, they'll kill me

498
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:26,883
You listen to me. Right now it's incredibly
important that you tell us everything.

499
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,389
We think that your grandmother...

500
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,848
Come on there were more
people there, with painted faces.

501
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,809
Why won't you confirm it?

502
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,812
The Devil is on their side.

503
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,692
The Devil doesn't exist.

504
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,524
There's good people. okay.
And there's bad people'

505
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:54,372
And unfortunately these
people are real scum'

506
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:58,206
But good people, like you,
are stronger than they are.

507
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,337
Yes you are.
People say that you're shy.

508
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:07,878
But I don't see that.
I see someone who is incredibly brave.

509
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:16,395
Someone who has been through living
hell and made it stop, all by yourself.

510
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:22,685
Now you just need to take
one more step, okay, and trust me.

511
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:05,234
(whisper)

512
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,605
Now they'll kill you too.

513
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,961
<i>(Angela) ...their headlights woke me up.</i>

514
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,300
<i>I saw them get out of the cars,
and they were wearing robes.</i>

515
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,809
<i>They were headed for my
Dad's workshop.</i>

516
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:48,191
<i>After a while I heard
a knock at the door.</i>

517
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,616
They were going to break it down
like the other times.

518
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,902
<i>So I opened it.</i>

519
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,866
(Bruce) Who were they?

520
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:05,662
It was my Grandmother,
dressed like them.

521
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,211
<i>She took me downstairs.</i>

522
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:15,676
<i>She had this weird smile on her face.</i>

523
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,218
<i>-(Angela) Like...
-(Bruce) Like she was drugged.</i>

524
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,808
<i>Yeah.</i>

525
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:29,902
I saw that we were headed
for my Dad's workshop.

526
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:37,861
<i>I could hear chanting and...</i>

527
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,533
<i>...squealing inside.</i>

528
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,090
<i>I! was a black mass.</i>

529
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,680
<i>I know {hey were
doing stuff in the comers.</i>

530
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,808
<i>Like fornicating.</i>

531
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,401
<i>Tenure.</i>

532
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,154
<i>There was blood, everywhere.</i>

533
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,375
<i>There was a woman with a pitcher.</i>

534
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:32,374
<i>She said. {his isn't happening.
Ifs all a dream.</i>

535
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:39,222
<i>But there was like this altar.</i>

536
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,848
And my Grandmother's:
"look at your Dad."

537
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:48,727
<i>"It's his big night."</i>

538
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:57,733
<i>Then... they brought out a baby.</i>

539
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,955
...and they each brought out a knife.

540
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,954
And they started stabbing it!

541
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,086
And they started eating it!

542
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,176
<i>I know they did this
to other mothers of the sect.</i>

543
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:20,760
<i>They burned the remains and
buried them on my dad's property!</i>

544
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,639
<i>Please find them!</i>

545
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,550
<i>They got to be there.</i>

546
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,981
...can't alter the bottom.
Okay. So just the grass...

547
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,445
- How long is it going to take?
-.'.two or three inches“.

548
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,111
Okay, it's very big.
We got to do it in sections.

549
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,575
- How long?
- We got to locate places where ditches...

550
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:48,457
- How long is it going to take?
- I don't know, Bruce, maybe a month!

551
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:51,165
You're all about not making any mistakes.
What are you doing? You come down here...

552
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,955
(yells) We don't have a month, Farrell!

553
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,375
Do you have any idea
what we are up against!

554
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:01,717
No, why would I? Why would I, Bruce?
You're the one with all the answers. Right?

555
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,098
You're right. You're right, okay.

556
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:09,346
Give this a listen. I already have it
memorized' Okay. Knock yourself out.

557
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,314
- What about the FBI?
-It's not going to lift a finger...

558
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,480
...until we have some hard evidence.
So we are on our own.

559
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,741
We got another call.
About twenty people in dark clothes.

560
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,243
Somebody heard "weird music."
- Send someone over.

561
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,575
It's probably those Gum's again.

562
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,365
- Who do we send, Chief? Everybody's here.
- Find someone, Tom!

563
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:34,413
Call the D.A. and tell him we can't
keep this up. And shut that damn door.

564
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,257
All right. Professor Raines?

565
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,546
Well John is responding well to therapy.

566
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:46,591
But he hasn't been able to identify
any of the faces that he's sees,

567
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,601
- You think he's trying to buy time?
- No, no. I don't think so.

568
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:54,107
You know Chief, I don't think he's telling
us everything. Let me talk to him a bit.

569
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,983
Work him, try to get
something out of him.

570
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:59,316
You don't know what you're talking about.
Keep your mouth closed.

571
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:03,779
Angela, what are you doing here?
Are you all right?

572
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,577
I was looking for you.

573
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,658
All right. Well...

574
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,333
Please. Sit down.

575
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:28,258
- You're not going to believe me.
- What happened?

576
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:31,389
I think they were following me.

577
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:35,101
- Just now as I was leaving the bookstore.
- Well who was?

578
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:37,687
I don't know who they are. But

579
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:42,898
I could feel 'em mixed in with
everyone on the street. Just...

580
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:44,986
Watching me.

581
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,079
- You don't believe me.
-It's not that, Angela.

582
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,410
Please. Sit down.

583
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,163
Half the city is in shock right now.

584
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,463
I went to your father's
workshop the other day.

585
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,802
And I saw everything.
I was terrified.

586
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,381
It was just suggestion.

587
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,477
My mother was followed.

588
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,060
She told me just before the accident.

589
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,652
Your brother told us.

590
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,823
- I should get your statement.
- I don't want to burden anyone.

591
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,031
You're not a burden.
All right, ifs my job to protect you.

592
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,788
Let me go get my recorder,
and I'll be right back.

593
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,766
You okay?

594
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:11,073
- Thank you but I...
-it's to protect you.

595
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,874
All right. I appreciate it.

596
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,585
My Dad said you were a jerk.

597
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:24,040
That you always complained
when he fixed your car.

598
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,959
Sometimes I get pissed off
when people don't do their job well.

599
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,755
I'm not exactly what you
might call a nice guy. You know?

600
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,138
Yes you are.

601
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,972
To me, at least.

602
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,150
- Good night.
- Good night.

603
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,398
And hey, hey. Thank you.

604
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,810
<i>(Bruce) This happened today?
What time?</i>

605
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,900
<i>(Angela) Around three o'clock.
Between Main and Timothy.</i>

606
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:47,172
<i>(Bruce) And what exactly did
your mother tell you ?</i>

607
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,214
<i>(Angela) It was one of their tactics.</i>

608
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:54,343
<i>They blend in with people on the
street and start staring at someone.</i>

609
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,052
(Bruce) What for?

610
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:00,970
<i>-(Angela) It's</i> a <i>death threat.
- How did she know?</i>

611
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,394
<i>She never said.</i>

612
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,768
<i>But she died right after.</i>

613
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:13,817
<i>Sometimes they'd call in the
middle of the night and hang up.</i>

614
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,989
<i>That's a warning.</i>

615
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,448
<i>A warning?</i>

616
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,908
<i>Yeah, it's like”.</i>

617
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:23,451
<i>An invitation. To be one of them.</i>

618
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:26,105
(whisper)

619
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,528
(Hold him)

620
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,167
Shh...

621
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,158
(chanting)

622
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:11,077
(breathes heavily)

623
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:29,599
So much depravity.
So much evil.

624
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:31,977
How...

625
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:36,519
How does he fool us? Just when
I thought my life was back on track,

626
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,780
my mother and I away
from temptation from the Devil.

627
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,071
That's right when I was closest to him.

628
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,453
You don't know, John?

629
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,914
- You really don't know?
- Bruce.

630
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,576
You had no idea what you were getting into?

631
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:58,253
There's no Devil, John'
There's only you. You're the Devil.

632
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:02,587
What about your wife?
You ready to confess to killing her?

633
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:06,428
- No... I didn't“. It was an accident.
-(yells) Bull shit!

634
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,052
The threats, the anonymous phone calls.
People stalking her.

635
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,437
You didn't know anything about that.

636
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:16,351
Quit praying and drawing things
and give me names!

637
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,734
- Are you sure you can handle this?
- What are you talking about?

638
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:23,524
This case is affecting everyone.
And you as well.

639
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,567
No need to play the tough guy.

640
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:31,161
Half the cops on this case are dragging ass
because I put one of our own behind bars.

641
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:35,662
The other half are complete idiots
to begin with. That's what's affecting me.

642
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,250
What about the nightmares?

643
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,422
Are you going to tell me
you're the only one not having any?

644
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,178
No, no I'm having them.

645
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:48,181
Luckily we all have you
to take care of us Professor.

646
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,725
Angela.

647
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:02,484
Clear something up for me and”.
these gentlemen,

648
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,615
Why did you let the Reverend
tell me what your father did.

649
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:12,281
Why? If you already
knew I was involved?

650
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:19,004
Because you don't
remember, Grandma.

651
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:24,418
I thought I was going crazy.

652
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:28,593
Because you'd walk around as if...

653
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,842
everything was normal.

654
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,892
But then I realized”.

655
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,275
That's a lie!

656
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,688
Hey. Rose. Rose.

657
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:47,825
I want to talk to my grandson!
Talk to Roy! He knows me!

658
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:50,452
He knows that I would
never do such a thing.

659
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:55,537
Listen Rose, it's your own son that's
telling us, Rose' You understand that?

660
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,539
(Raines) Take another look
at John's drawings

661
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:01,626
-and see if there's something”.
- I don't kill babies!

662
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,789
I know who I am.

663
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:06,051
I think you and I
should go on with the therapy.

664
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:11,135
You just don't...
just don't remember.

665
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:16,478
I know who! am!
(yells) I know who I am!

666
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:21,184
(Reverend) I think I better take you home.
(Rose cries)

667
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:25,108
Come Rose.

668
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,398
You will pay for this!

669
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,242
(Angela cries)

670
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:25,669
You were right.
This case is getting to me.

671
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,294
Since we've had
absolutely no progress.

672
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:34,135
Nothing. This is impossible.

673
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,510
There are too many pieces here.

674
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:44,483
John blocked his memories
because they defied his morality.

675
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:50,489
And his son Roy is a defence mechanism.
All right, very well. But now Rose.

676
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,734
You're the one that said
the mind is a whole universe.

677
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,153
Oh God I say that crap sometimes.

678
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:05,087
What about from a
non-scientific standpoint?

679
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:10,091
(Raines) Non-scientific.

680
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:14,676
What are you implying -
that we were all possessed by the Devil?

681
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:17,091
I'm just trying to keep
an open mind.

682
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:37,069
It wasn't you, Rose.

683
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,405
It was his will.

684
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,618
And he is the one we're up against.

685
01:01:55,545 --> 01:02:00,392
<i>You can't be too careful. The men and women

688
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,486
Yeah Chief, I'm watching it.

689
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,863
Who is this?

690
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:22,910
Hello?

691
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,457
Hello?

in Olympia, Washington.</i>

<i>Who was accused of
being a Satanist.</i>

699
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,788
<i>This could mean that

Did you look at that window?

Looks like she was trying to getaway.

737

See, what did I tell you, man.

738

The somebody pushed her.
And the house is clean.

You know exactly what I said.

What's going on, Charlie?

741
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:22,737
Boss, I never really believe
in this sort of stuff.

742
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,609
But?

743
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,943
But I'm starting to think this won't help.

744

Those people are just flesh and bone.

745

I'm not talking about people, Boss.

746

We're waiting for her to confess.
So right now she'll stay in the hospital.

- Please don't say that again.
- You don't understand.

I know I should hate them.

But they're my family.

752
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:19,160
I talk to her every day.

753
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:23,043
She left us.

754
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,334
All of us.

755
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:29,254
Despite everything my Dad
put her through.

756

You don't believe, do you?
In praying.

757
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:43,356
I believe in you, Angela. I do.

- Now listen'

762
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:21,769
Listen, forgive me, okay.
I'm sorry. I have to go.

763
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:30,820
What are you doing, Bruce?

764
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:34,410
What are you doing?

765
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,846
Roy...

766
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:01,141
Oh Roy.

767
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:09,146
Grandma, what happened?

768
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:12,904
They hounded me.

769
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:21,034
So I wouldn't tell,
what I did to you.

770
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:25,750
Grandma, you never did anything to me.

771
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,880
You were always good to
me.

772
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,166
Accepted me as I am.

773
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,883
Horrible things.

774
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:36,472
Horrible things“.

775
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,309
I know that now.

776
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,692
Don't talk to her anymore.

777
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,652
- You're making her crazy.
- What happened?

778
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:56,409
- You really think she saw the Devil?
- Roy.

779
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:59,241
She suffered a
spontaneous regression.

780
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:02,203
Now we need to separate
the real from the imagined.

781
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,367
She started drinking again,
she's delirious.

782
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,332
- Roy.
- You're a fraud.

783
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,212
Just like him.

784
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,505
You think I don't remember?

785
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:17,013
Always preaching, sticking your nose into
other people's lives.

786
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:20,050
Like you did with mine!
You and your fucking church!

787
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:23,853
I'm very sorry you feel that way, Roy.

788
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:28,141
Will you at least come
and see your sister?

789
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:34,989
I should go.

790
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:39,995
I got a better idea.
Why don't all of your just go.

791
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,742
Leave us alone.

792
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:59,181
He's only trying to protect Rose.
We have to talk to him again.

793
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,887
(Reverend) You don't know what
you're up against.

794
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:05,519
Don't you see it?
He's with them now.

795
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,314
And I don't think even he knows it.

796
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,484
- All of this is Satan's work.
- Oh come on.

797
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,610
I'm talking about evil.

798
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:18,612
- Evil itself.
- Evil itself? Listen, Reverend.

799
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:23,701
No. The Devil will do
the same thing to you.

800
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:28,619
As he's doing to John's family.
He'll find a way to confuse you.

801
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:30,999
To tempt you.

802
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,758
I've already handed out
quite a few at the station.

803
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:42,515
- You did what?
-It can't do any harm.

804
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,359
(Reverend) Good night.

805
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,777
- Why don't you just admit it?
- Admit what?

806
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,942
That you're scared to death.

807
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,578
You're not using your head anymore.

808
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:07,410
Raines...

809
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:44,949
<i>(Bruce from recording) And what exactly did
your mother tell you?</i>

810
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:47,660
<i>(Angela) It was one of their tactics.</i>

811
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:51,201
<i>They blend in with people on the street
and start staring at someone.</i>

812
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,914
(Bruce) What for?

813
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,839
(Angela) <i>It's</i> a death threat.

814
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:58,796
(phone rings)

815
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,927
(phone rings)

816
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,897
Hello?

817
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:21,363
(breathing)

818
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,112
Hello?

819
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:27,824
Listen I am sick...

820
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:51,348
<i>(Angela) Sometimes they'd call
in the middle of the night and hang up.</i>

821
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,308
<i>That's a warning.</i>

822
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:56,357
<i>-(Bruce) A warning?
- Yeah, it's like”.</i>

823
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:01,942
<i>an invitation to be one of them.</i>

824
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:10,742
(woman) Bruce?

825
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,662
Are you all right?

826
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:22,959
- Where am l...
- Shh..,

827
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,846
Tell them he's ready.

828
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:34,720
(Bruce) Nesbitt...

829
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:39,400
- This can't be real.
-(woman) Of course it's not real.

830
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,856
- You're in custody.
-It's not happening, Bruce.

831
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:44,238
-(woman) This is a dream.
- Come on.

832
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:48,526
Walk slowly.

833
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,831
Hold him,
he's still a bit dizzy.

834
01:14:56,534 --> 01:15:00,289
- Watch your step, Bruce.
- What are you all doing in my house?

835
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:02,627
-(man) Let him through.
- Gel out of my house.

836
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,713
(woman) Make way. Make way.

837
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,469
- Ge( out of my house!
-(woman) This is not your house.

838
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:21,192
(woman) You're dreaming, Bruce.

839
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:23,769
(baby cries)

840
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,938
This isn't real.

841
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,280
Give him the knife.

842
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:08,190
No! No!

843
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:11,409
No! No!

844
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:21,377
Don't cry sweetheart.

845
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:27,005
It's only a dream.
Our secret recipe.

846
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:31,129
Go on. Drink.

847
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,844
I'm not one of you!

848
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:40,556
I'm not one of you!
I'm not one of you!

849
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,123
(prays)

850
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,011
Come on Lady.

851
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,525
Tough luck.

852
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:45,961
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!

853
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,212
Come on.

854
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:10,436
Morning.

855
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:27,328
What are you doing here?
What the fuck are you doing here!

856
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:29,667
- Hey! Hey!
- Jesus Christ, Bruce!

857
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,003
This man is under arrest! Get off me!

858
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:35,511
Who authorized his release!
Get the fuck off me!

859
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,427
He came here to pick up his stuff.

860
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:42,518
They released him
yesterday afternoon.

861
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:44,553
I tried to call you
but you never answered.

862
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,816
- But why! Why did you release him?
- He passed the polygraph twice,

863
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:51,185
Polygraph...
- We had no choice.

864
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:54,025
- That's the deal we had with his lawyer."
- What deal?

865
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:56,862
I know he's lying, Chief! I know it.

866
01:18:57,024 --> 01:19:00,949
Bruce, relax. Relax okay.
He'll never work here again.

867
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:04,741
Look. Look.
May I'? It's not just the test.

868
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:07,660
We got back the results
of Angela's medical report.

869
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:11,421
And the mark's superficial, it was recent,
it was probably self-inflicted'

870
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,254
- I saw... I saw...
- Oh for Christ's sake. You're not a doctor.

871
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:17,511
- But I saw...
- You saw wrong.

872
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,014
It's typical in trauma victims to want to

873
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:23,802
strengthen their testimony
by adding little details.

874
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:25,936
Do we know who signed this report?

875
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:29,144
- Bruce.
- No, they already be among us!

876
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:31,475
I don't believe any of it.

877
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:36,022
I got my hands full with these guys.
Please, don't let all this get to you.

878
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,027
- Not to you.
- What...

879
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:41,490
You said you were being
watched on the street today.

880
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:46,373
Have you seen yourself
in the mirror recently?

881
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:55,341
Why don't you just go home and
forget about the case for a few days.

882
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,627
Somethings happening to you.

883
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:41,880
<i>This is Detective Bruce Kenner.
It is October the fourteenth. 1990.</i>

884
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:45,266
<i>- Stale you! full name.
- John Gray.</i>

885
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:59,730
<i>-...hugging or kissing me...
- So she's been avoiding you?</i>

886
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:02,446
<i>Yeah. And also...</i>

887
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:06,738
<i>John. cut the shit okay.
Take your hat off.</i>

888
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:21,252
(rewinds)

889
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:24,046
<i>Yeah and then also...</i>

890
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:27,342
<i>John. cut the shit okay.
Take your hat...</i>

891
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,768
Shit.

892
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,383
<i>- She's been avoiding you'?
- Yeah.</i>

893
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:03,381
<i>And then also the...</i>

894
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:06,093
<i>John. cut the shit okay.
Take your...</i>

895
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:10,723
You were making a list of things
that were obvious and I cut you off.

896
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:13,728
What was it you were going to say?
What made you feel guilty.

897
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:18,980
Well I think it had to
do with my son, Roy.

898
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:24,528
He's umm...
Just saying the word makes me sick.

899
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,658
What word?

900
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:29,069
He's a sodomite.

901
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:31,200
He's a what?

902
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,115
That's why I kicked him out.

903
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:35,743
That means he's gay?

904
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:40,089
No... well at church we
call them sodomites.

905
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:44,969
Those are sins that people
always learn from some pervert.

906
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:48,556
And then when Angela
started accusing me,

907
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:55,142
I.“ I saw it clearly. It was me.
I was the pervert'

908
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,230
Wait a second.

909
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:03,904
Are you telling me that you're taking the
blame for sexually abusing your daughter

910
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:05,780
-because your son is gay?
- Yeah.

911
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:09,660
John, and you waited
to tell me that until now!

912
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,037
- Why... Why are you angry?
- Now you tell me!

913
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:14,995
- Why are you so angry?
- Oh God, John!

914
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:18,161
- I'm only trying to help you.
- Bullshit you're trying to help me!

915
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,204
- Are you playing games with me?
- No sir!

916
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,498
Hey look at me,
are you playing games!

917
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,917
No, I never lied to you. sir!

918
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:32,308
You don't think I want to put an end
to all of this? I'd do anything, Bruce.

919
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:36,596
Anything to pay for what I've done.

920
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:45,405
To my children.
And I don't know what else to do.

921
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:14,026
(truck horn)

922
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:35,673
(bark)

923
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:40,181
Move.

924
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:44,397
You never rest, do you?

925
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:46,809
I have a question.
Just need a simple yes or no answer.

926
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,524
Please just for a second
can you just listen to me”.

927
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,859
Can these dogs please shut up!

928
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:57,327
Look at this, please.

929
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,489
You see this picture?

930
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:05,707
I thought I knew her, I was sure that
I knew her but ifs an advertisement.

931
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:09,590
Obviously. It's been up
all over town. It's a drawing.

932
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:14,879
Right? But ever since the case began, I've
been thinking about her. I put her there.

933
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:17,514
I don't know her.
She's not even real.

934
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:22,015
What if the regressions
are the same thing'

935
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:27,017
They're not memories.
They're fantasies.

936
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,526
- They're induced fantasies.
-Induced by who?

937
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:35,032
By us' By the therapy.
By police, by the media.

938
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:39,240
We bombard them with
the same thing over and over.

939
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:42,080
And their imagination
just does the rest.

940
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:47,290
We're not freeing their memories.
This is a nightmare produced by all of us.

941
01:26:51,957 --> 01:26:54,301
- Collective hysteria.
- Yeah. Yeah.

942
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:01,387
It doesn't make sense,
What about Nesbitt?

943
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:04,679
You know he's guilty or
are you doubting that now?

944
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:06,847
No. No. George Nesbitt
is guilty, but maybe.”

945
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:08,811
- Maybe what?
- I don't know.

946
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:10,851
Stop clutching at straws.

947
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:14,738
I'm not clutching at straws.
I'm trying to find the truth.

948
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,990
You're demolishing my work!

949
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:19,197
- Okay, all right...
- This is science.

950
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:22,329
- This is science!
- I'm starting to use my head again!

951
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,869
Goodbye Professor.

952
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:40,714
Nesbitt, what did you do?

953
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,093
What did you do.

954
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,417
Drop that! Get over there!

955
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:59,084
Let me see your faces!
Both of you, let me see your faces!

956
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:08,343
(Farrell) You had it coming.

957
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:10,638
For ruining his life you bastard.

958
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:16,272
His life? They just let him go!

959
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:21,190
- What you came over here to celebrate?
- What am I supposed to do now, huh?

960
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,734
- What about my career?
- Your career.“

961
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:28,030
Fine. Yeah I made some mistakes.
But I shouldn't have to pay for all this!

962
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:32,417
You got what you wanted. Two stooges for
your bull shit case! You'll get a medal!

963
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:34,999
All right, listen to me right now.

964
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:37,835
I'm not going to report this.

965
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:41,923
This stays between us.
Just tell me what you know, Nesbitt!

966
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:44,087
- Tell you what?
- What you kept from us.

967
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:46,256
What only you know about it.

968
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:49,680
(George laughs)

969
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:52,304
Only me?

970
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:56,149
I told you that day in the car.

971
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,145
Am I right?

972
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:08,657
(soft piano music)

973
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:24,882
I need to speak with Angela.

974
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:29,762
- What happened?
- I've solved the case.

975
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:33,140
We've go! them all.

976
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,559
I'll get her.

977
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:45,486
Hello, Angela.

978
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:49,031
Did you really?

979
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,781
Nesbitt gave us all the names.

980
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:57,203
Yeah I know, I know,
I know' Sit down. Sit down.

981
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:59,124
You'll be fine.

982
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:06,136
Angela. I know something
terrible happened to you.

983
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:11,766
And I understand why maybe you
didn't want to tell me this until now.

984
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:18,064
Nesbitt said they go! you pregnant.

985
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:25,572
Did they want you to have
a baby for the sect?

986
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:31,404
(reverend) Angela. Don't hold
anything back' Tell us everything.

987
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:38,122
He also told us”.

988
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:43,291
...that there was a ceremony
where they gave you an abortion.

989
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:55,810
Please tell me they didn't...

990
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,606
Put a foetus“.

991
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:16,740
Angela.

992
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:30,004
What is the meaning of this?

993
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:31,797
What's the meaning of it?

994
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:37,059
It means I made it all up.

995
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,564
- Why are you lying?
- Angela.

996
01:32:42,474 --> 01:32:46,195
You have been playing us
from the start, all right. Was it you?

997
01:32:46,352 --> 01:32:48,946
- You were the one calling my house?
- I didn't call anyone.

998
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:50,903
You were calling my house.

999
01:32:51,441 --> 01:32:53,284
You know what
Nesbitt really told me?

1000
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:57,573
He told me that you hate your family.

1001
01:32:57,906 --> 01:33:00,409
That you think they're all
a bunch of drunk losers.

1002
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:04,455
And that your mother killed herself
because she couldn't lake it anymore.

1003
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:06,248
That's a lie.

1004
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:10,089
You really opened up to George. And then
you guys were sleeping together, right.

1005
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:13,176
I mean, when he told you
he would never run away with a minor...

1006
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:16,888
And you saw that your life was going to be
like your mothers, you wanted to change it.

1007
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:19,348
Why were you crying
that day at the seminar?

1008
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:22,390
I already told you why,
her father raped her.

1009
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:26,105
No. Can I talk to you for a second.

1010
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:30,397
- What are you doing?
- Just come, speak with me for one second.

1011
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:34,572
Next time you hear
the voice of God, don't call us.

1012
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:36,611
Are you out of your mind!

1013
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:39,702
<i>Open this door light now! Mr. Kenner!</i>

1014
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,366
You just told us
what we wanted to hear

1015
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:44,537
while getting rid of your family.
Isn't that right Angela?

1016
01:33:44,702 --> 01:33:48,752
Then you went too far,
and now you can't stop. Isn't that right?

1017
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:57,056
Who's going to believe you, Bruce?

1018
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:02,388
Especially when I tell everyone
what you did in the cemetery'

1019
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:05,311
In front of my mother's grave.

1020
01:34:12,105 --> 01:34:15,029
You just offended someone
who loved you very much.

1021
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,448
I offended you?

1022
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:21,535
You think I care?

1023
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:24,201
I was talking about your mother.

1024
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:35,465
Get out of my church.

1025
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:39,640
You were right, Reverend.

1026
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:41,596
Get out!

1027
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:44,729
It does exist. Evil itself.

1028
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:55,031
<i>Now the police have no leads. Which is very
common in cases of Satanic Ritual abuse.</i>

1029
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:58,535
<i>But that begs the question,
where's the proof?</i>

1030
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:02,367
<i>(man) The Devil knows where the proof is.</i>

1031
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:06,285
<i>He's the one guiding and
helping his henchmen conceal it.</i>

1032
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:10,121
<i>To make us believe
that he doesn't exist.</i>

1033
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:15,802
<i>I saw what they did! They killed
babies and sometimes they ale them.</i>

1034
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:19,510
<i>Then they'd burn the remains
and bury them on my Dad's properly.</i>

1035
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:21,595
<i>They said they would kill me.</i>

1036
01:35:21,758 --> 01:35:25,934
<i>I chose to speak out about this
so the people would know the truth.</i>

1037
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:28,769
<i>This is so much bigger
than what it seems'</i>

1038
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:33,645
<i>I only hope that people realize
the enormous danger we're in.</i>

1039
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:39,360
<i>People need to believe use
Believe us.</i>

1040
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:45,828
That's the scariest part,
We believed it.

1041
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:52,547
Hey, you did good.

1042
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,217
Let's go.

1043
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:36,044
(Bruce) Angela must've read it.

1044
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:40,633
Or else she saw one of those shows
she's doing interviews on now.

1045
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:42,547
Doesn't matter, it's all trash.

1046
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:46,810
The rest is just outbreaks of panic
like the one we had here.

1047
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:49,600
The FBI had already filed all this.

1048
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:56,690
But... I don't get it. What about my
visions, and my mothers and Roy's?

1049
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:58,400
They all match,
how is that possible?

1050
01:36:58,563 --> 01:37:01,157
You saw what we made you believe,
and we believed what you saw.

1051
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:06,868
We just went around in a circle. The
tortures, the photographs, the sacrifices.

1052
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:09,574
We all just made it up.

1053
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:16,965
I spoke with the D.A.
All right, now listen.

1054
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:20,547
Nobody wants to take
the blame for this mess, okay.

1055
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:23,133
They're going to want you
to confess to child molestation,

1056
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:25,845
but you can't do it
because they don't have a case.

1057
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:30,471
The only one who should
be worried right now is Angela.

1058
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:34,015
No you just...
Leave Angela alone.

1059
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:38,858
Please leave her alone.
First you said I was the Devil, Remember?

1060
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:56,838
All those years, drinkin'
and destroying myself

1061
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:03,171
and not taking care
of my family until Emily...

1062
01:38:03,336 --> 01:38:06,590
John, You have to stop punishing yourself.

1063
01:38:06,923 --> 01:38:09,426
Emily gave up.
My wife gave up.

1064
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:15,311
And Angela never complained.
She never said anything.

1065
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:17,983
All this hate now.

1066
01:38:20,395 --> 01:38:21,942
It's my fault.

1067
01:38:24,941 --> 01:38:29,162
- I'm the one that made her into this.
- I am the one who failed you.

1068
01:38:29,779 --> 01:38:35,081
Don't you see? From the beginning,
I couldn't see what was happening.

1069
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,587
I thought that this case”.

1070
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,549
That I was the only one...

1071
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:46,587
I was so stupid, John.

1072
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:52,515
Please. Please, you have to at least
let me help you get out of here.

1073
01:38:56,931 --> 01:39:01,402
- You really want to help me?
- Yes.

1074
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:05,907
Then you tell the D.A.
that I plead guilty.

1075
01:39:06,065 --> 01:39:08,864
No. John, you'll get
a minimum of five years.

1076
01:39:09,026 --> 01:39:14,453
I don't care, doesn't matter. As long as
you leave Angela alone. Don't go after her.

1077
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:21,206
She'll realize I'm doing this for her,
to protect her.

1078
01:39:21,581 --> 01:39:23,709
And that way, maybe...

1079
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:28,342
