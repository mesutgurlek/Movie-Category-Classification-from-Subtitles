does the defense have
anything further to add ?

uh, i guess i should, uh,

what happened ?

00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,815
i just want to reaffirm
what i said to you yesterday.

we're gonna get you out.
i know you're trying,
mr. kirkland.

00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,821
but this is crazy,
you know ?
i know it.

211
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,824
you told me you have
the evidence that proves
i'm innocent.

212
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,327
it does prove it,
doesn't it ?
yes, jeff, you're innocent.

213
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,829
and that there judge fleming
agrees with you, right ?
right.

214
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,333
well, if everyone agrees
that i'm innocent, how come
i'm goin' back to jail ?

215
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,335
roll 'em.
there's enough
proof, jeff.

216
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,337
it's just that the court
won't accept the proof.

217
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:15,341
why not ?
well, uh, there's a law--

218
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,844
there's a law which
says that evidence
must be submitted...

within a certain
time period, a-an-and...

two days late.

00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:27,853
what difference does that make ?
what difference does it make
if it came in three years late ?

222
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,356
they got the proof they need.
 they should let me go !

223
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:34,860
i don't understand this !
that judge who sent me to jail,
he knows i'm innocent !

224
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,364
what's goin' on here ?
jeff, it's just gonna take
a little more time, that's all.

225
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,367
any other judge would
have let you out, but
this guy, fleming,

00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,370
he goes by
the letter of the law.
i don't understand that.

i promise i'll get you out.

i want to apologize
to you, sir, for my--

231
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,396
my behavior
in the courtroom
the other day--

232
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:14,400
i don't want to hear your
apologies.  i don't want to hear
anything you have to say.

233
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,902
that's understandable, sir.
it's just--

234
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:20,406
it's just i thought that
maybe we could discuss
this mccullaugh case,

235
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,408
you know, you and i,
man to man ?

236
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,411
off the record, sir.
if you're going to try
to make a deal with me,

237
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,413
you might wind up
right back in jail.

no, sir.

no, sir, i'm not trying
to make a deal.  look,
sir, i can understand...

your strict enforcement
of the statute,

241
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,922
but what i can't understand
is that my client's
constitutional rights...

242
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,924
are being denied !
don't you quote
the law to me.

243
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,429
my client is innocent !
personally, i don't give a shit
about your client.

it's been a week.

302
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:51,176

oh !
that's a good machine.

are you a...

[ scoffs ]

311
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:25,711
are you honest ?
well, i don't know.

00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:30,716
bein' honest doesn't
have much to do with
bein' a lawyer, grandpa.

00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,719
if you're not honest,
you've got nothing.

00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:52,237
they're still your parents.
no.

you raised me.
you're the one that put
me through law school.

00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,269
soon,
you'll look like a lawyer,

and you'll be a lawyer.

326
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,778
i've been a lawyer
for twelve years.

[ sighs ]

328
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,793
so, it's another week,
already ?

329
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,301
[ man ]
do you know jules stouffer ?
[ arthur ]  yes, i do.

330
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,804
-[ man ]  he was a client
 of yours, isn't that right ?
-[ arthur ]  yes.

331
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,808
wasn't he originally
represented by alvin burton ?

332
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:06,311
yes, that is correct.
why did he change
representation ?

333
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,814
because i handled him on
an aggravated assault charge.

334
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,316
that's my area,
not burton's area, so--

335
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:15,320
did jules stouffer
express dissatisfaction
with mr. burton ?

336
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,323
no.  not at all.
burton's an excellent lawyer.

337
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,325
you're not going after him,
are you ?

338
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:23,328
we're not going after
anyone, mr. kirkland.
we are simply--

339
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,832
do you know david--
we are simply trying to review
certain accusations,

340
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:31,336
to determine whether or not
they are true, and to, more
or less, clean our own house.

341
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,840
so, please
do not overdramatize
these proceedings.

342
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,344
- it's not
  the mccarthy hearings.
- oh !  that's a relief.

343
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:43,849
so, you're not gonna ask me,
"are you now, or have you
 ever been, a lawyer ?"

344
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,353
that wasn't amusing,
mr. kirkland.

345
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:52,858
- do you know david crebbs ?
- no, it wasn't, miss, um--

- packer.
- packer.

347
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,364
this isn't amusing.
it is, however, ridiculous.

00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,366
yes.
david crebbs ?
i know him.

349

350
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:10,375
do you know david crebbs ?
why are we using
microphones ?

351
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:15,380
- why don't we just
  talk to each other ?
- this is a hearing.

352
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,884
ah !  yes.
it's a hearing.

353
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:22,387
-do you know jules stouffer ?
- we've already asked that
  question, mr. crenna.

354
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,891
oh, we're through
with stouffer ?
how about alvin burton ?

355
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,394
do you know david crebbs ?
i already asked that.

356
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,396
what'd he say ?
he said, "yes."

357
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,399
have you ever seen him
intoxicated in court ?

david crebbs has
a speech impediment.

now, if you check
your records, you'll see
it's there someplace.

360
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,909
no.
that's the answer
to your question:

00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,912
no, he doesn't drink.
doesn't drink at all.

362
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,915
at this point,
i would just like to say...

363
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:55,921
that what this committee
is doing in theory
is highly commendable.

364
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:59,925
however, in practice,
it sucks.

365
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,428
and i am not going to
answer any more questions.

366
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,440
what do you think
we're trying to do
in there ?

367
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,944
want a drink ?
no.

368
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,947
whatever you may think,
we are not conducting
some kind of, uh,

well, you might not
be aware of this,

371
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,455
mr. kirkland,
but there's a lot of
corruption going around...

doing anything about.

00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,961
do you think your committee's
doing something about it ?
yes, i do.

00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:40,465
that committee is
a very dangerous farce.

working on that committee.

377

i don't care how many hours
you spend.
i don't do it...

378
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,977
because it's going
to give me laughs,
understand ?

to wind up accomplishing ?

when they came down
on me.
it states that you were--

the dog was attacking you
when you were first seen
in the alley.

gets like that sometime.
it also states that the dog...

belonged to
mrs. b. jackson.

looked like my dog.

come on, ralph.
it also states here...

that when asked
what you were doing
in the alley,

414
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:14,502
you replied,
"i don't know nothin' about
that taxi cab robbery."

my cousin royce--

00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:31,579
s-see, he figures that
since i am the way i am--

437
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:38,086
[ chuckles ]
mr. kirkland, i can look
real fine sometimes, you know ?

438
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,091
yeah, i'm sure
you can, ralph.

439
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,594
w-well, royce figures
that we can be a couple.

440
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,097
you know, like a man
and a woman couple.

441
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,100
'cause a cab driver
will pick up a couple
a whole lot faster...

442
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,603
than they will
two nigger men.

443
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:59,607
so, uh--

444
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:04,112
we got into
this cab over on
garrison boulevard,

445
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,115
and we asked him
to take us down
to the harbor.

446
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,118
you know, like-like
we was tourists.

447
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,628
hey, man, i--
i can't go to jail, man.

448
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:24,132
i just can't do it.
i can't go
to that place.

449
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,136
please, mr. kirkland,
you've got to help me.

450

453
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,648
just don't lie
to me, that's all.

454

[ pen scratching ]
okay ?

thanks for bringing
me home, gail.

460
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,177
oh, god.
well !

461
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,181
you really take renting
an unfurnished apartment
literally, don't you ?

462
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,184
arthur, you know it doesn't
have to stay this way.

463
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:22,190
what happened ?
did your wife take you
in the divorce settlement ?

464
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,194
she had
a better lawyer.
oh.

465
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,198
what about your kids ?
get to see them much ?

466
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,700
well, they're in
california, you know.

467
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,203
phone calls, holidays--

468
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,706
put the food out.
i'll get the plates.

469
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:42,710
i guess i was lucky.
we never had any kids.

470
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,213
how long were you married ?
three years.

471
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,715
ooh.
were you in love ?

472
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:53,221
nah.  i was
in love with the law.

473
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,723
you know what i mean ?

474
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,228
got a serving spoon ?

thank you.

00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,737
so, uh,
you eat out a lot ?

478
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:13,241
yeah, you ?
yeah.

479
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,743
the committee works
just about every night.

480
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,748
how did you feel
when you walked out on
the committee this morning ?

481
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,251
[ grunts ]
did you feel all those
daggers in your back ?

482
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,254
that's a very
dangerous group, you know ?

483
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,757
[ sighs ]
oh, jesus.
here we go, here we go.

484
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:35,263
arthur, why ?
why do you feel
it's dangerous ?

485
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,766
because you're conning
the public into thinking
you're doing something.

486
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,768
and you're not.
yeah.  but we are
doing something.

487
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,771
no, you're not.
we are protecting the public
from a lot of corrupt lawyers,

488
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,774
is what we're doing.

489
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:50,278
you're skimming the surface.
you're not going after
real power.

490
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,280
[ whistles ]

491
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,284
wow, that's scary.
what real power, arthur ?

492
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,786
you don't know ?
no, why don't
you tell me ?

493
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:02,790
well, now we know
they are definitely safe.

494
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,297
what makes you think
you know so goddamn much ?

495
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,300
i don't know so much.
no, no.  tell me.

496
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,804
what makes you the great
voice of authority ?
[ scoffs ]

497
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:19,807
i don't pretend to be
a voice of authority.

498
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,815
i don't think you know
what you're doing,
that's all.

499
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:31,319
oh, i see.
yeah, yeah.

500
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,324
this is nice,
don't you think ?

501
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,327
no, i don't find this
particularly nice.

502
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,829
arthur, i'm, uh--

503
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,334
i'm angry again.

504
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,337
- you know ?
  i don't like being angry.
- it's not very pleasant.

505
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:53,341
i don't understand how
you can criticize me
for what i do.

506
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,344
i'm not criticizing you,
gail.  you're taking it
too personally.

507
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:00,848
arthur, the committee
is doingsomethingabout
what's going on.

508
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,352
we are not sitting
in jail at nights because
of contempt of court.

509
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,356
do you know what
that's about ?
yeah.

510
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,359
yeah ?
you threw a punch
at judge fleming.

511
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,861
uh-huh.
you know why ?
i have no idea.

512
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:17,865
tell me.
i got a client
who's in jail...

513
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,868
because of
a faulty taillight,
and i can't get him out.

514
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,371
what do you mean,
you can't get him out ?
you want to hear...

515
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,874
a story about our
wonderful judicial system ?

516
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:30,378
hmm ?
sure.

517
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:35,883
there's a guy named
jeff mccullaugh, and he's goin'
down the highway one night.

518
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:40,388
and the cops stop him
because his taillight
isn't working.

519
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,890
they pull him over
to the side,
run a make on him.

520
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,394
computer kicks back that
there's a jeff mccullaugh...

521
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,397
wanted in alabama for
assault with a deadly weapon.

522
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,399
is this the same
jeff mccullaugh ?
no.

523
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:55,403
but he fits the same
general description,
so they arrest him.

524
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,406
why didn't mccullaugh tell them
they had the wrong person ?
well, he did.

525
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,908
he told the public defender,
who i don't think
really believed him.

526
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,911
and he was too busy.
he never even
bothered to check.

527
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:08,416
[ laughing ]
are you serious ?
ah, wait.  it gets better.

528
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,919
while jeff is sittin'
in jail,

529
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,921
a guard is stabbed.

530
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,924
and the knife is planted
in jeff's cell.

531
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,927
and jeff is brought to trial
on a new charge--

532
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,930
this time, assaulting a guard
with a deadly weapon.

533
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,433
and a trial date is set,

534
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:29,437
six months from the time
he was first picked up.

535
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,941
i'll make a long story
short for you.
six months go by.

536
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:37,945
and a very shaky,
very crazy jeff mccullaugh
goes to court.

537
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:41,449
now, the public defender
who's defending him,
he says--

538
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:46,454
he tells jeff that
he can get him off
if he pleads guilty.

539
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,956
he'll make a deal
with the judge,
and he'll get him off.

540
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,959
time served.
right.  so he pleads guilty,
even though he's innocent.

541
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:56,464
that's right.  however,
the deal was made
with a judge callahan.

542
00:36:56,464 --> 00:37:01,469
the day of the trial,
judge callahan
can not be found.

543
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:06,974
fleming is in his place.
fleming doesn't know
anything about the deal.

544
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,478
jeff pleads guilty.

545
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:14,482
fleming sentences jeff
to five years in prison.

[ exhales ]

547

goddamn.
so, one little guy...

548
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,492
has already spent
a year and a half
in jail,

549
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,494
because his lights
didn't work.

550
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:31,499
i've spent the last year
puttin' together enough
evidence to prove he's innocent.

551
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,001
and i prove it.
i get it all together,

552
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:38,506
and i bring it
into fleming's court,
and he throws it out.

553
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:42,510
why ?
because it came in
three days late.

oh, that's incredible.

it's not incredible.
 it's fleming.

no, arthur.
that's the law.

560
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,534
you can't fault fleming legally,
because he was going
by the letter of the law.

561
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,545
are you kidding ?
no, i'm not.

you talk to me like that,
you're not going to
get me into bed, dear.

yes, i will.

this may sound crazy,
but judge fleming...

was just taken away.

they just arrested the judge.

what's the joke,
warren ?

there's a joke
connected to this.
there is no joke, arthur.

i don't know what it's all
about.  they're sitting on

i am innocent,
and i fully intend...

to have that proven
in a court of law.

to handle my defense.

to our advantage.

unless he was
truly innocent ?

 you might learn something.

732
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:57,194
you know, i was skydiving
once, and my main chute,
it didn't open.

733
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:59,696
i pulled my reserve.
that didn't open either.

00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,698
there i was,
plunging to the earth.

735
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:05,202
just as i hit
the treetops, i discovered
the meaning of life.

- which is ?
- it sucks, arthur.
  it really sucks.

[ judge ]
now, just relax, arthur.

the old chinese proverb.

what have we hit ?

755
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,781
the halfway point.

756
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:26,783
there's a little
game i play,
each time i go out.

757
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:29,286
i calculate how much
fuel i have.

758
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:32,789
and how far
i can go and still
get back on it.

759
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:35,292
well--
then i figure out
the halfway point,

760
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,794
and i go just
a little beyond it.
[ chuckles ]

761
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:43,300
you mean, we're beyond
the halfway point ?

preoccupied with it,

like a valid time,

consider taking his case ?

well, you better be
interested, arthur,

because there's some very
powerful people in this town

talking about, disbarred ?

named ernest drago ?

sure.  yeah, drago.
yeah.  what about him ?

825
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:57,220
well, you gave information to
the police on the q.t. that led
to his arrest and conviction.

826
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:02,225
drago was anut !
 drago was insane.

827
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,728
he used to sit in my office
and rattle off to me...

828
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:07,230
some of the most grotesque
fantasies you can imagine.

829
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:12,235
i handled him one time
on a burglary charge and used to
hear that stuff every day.

830
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,738
he would tell me these fantasies
and one of his favorites was:

831
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:18,742
what would happen
if he stuck a firecracker
in somebody's mouth ?

832
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:22,245
yeah, that was
one of his favorites.
so i read in the newspapers...

833
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:25,248
that there was
this-this-this nut...

834

who was holding people up
with a gun, forcing
cherry bombs in their mouths.

835
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:32,255
i knew it was drago,
so i told the police.
the specifics don't matter.

836
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:36,760
by telling the police,
you didn't prevent a crime.
you betrayed a client.

837
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,263
you violated the code of ethics.
what the hell
are you talkin' about ?

what the hell
is going on here ?

they want me to defend fleming
because of my moral integrity,

and if i don't defend him,
they're gonna have me disbarred
for bein' unethical ?

00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:09,793
look, arthur.  put aside
your personal feelings.

just reopen the case.
that's all i'm askin'.

reopen the case
and give me a crack at a jury.
i'll get him acquitted.

you are in no position
to ask for anything.

what i can do to help.

to the statute.

about the girl ?

about her ?

what do you want to know ?

over at city hall.

did you have sex with her

yes, i did.

that's why this whole thing
makes no sense to me.

happened to her ?

i assure you
that i did not rape her,

but i really don't know.

867
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:41,384
maybe some angry boyfriend
showed up after i left.

868
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:45,889
"angry boyfriend"--
that's a little mild,
don't you think ?

869
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:50,894
i mean, she wasn't just raped.
she was sadistically beaten
and sodomized.

870
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:53,897
that goes a little bit
beyond an angry boyfriend.

you're right.
you're right.

01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:42,044
he was injured by it.
i understand that.
that is not the point !

1022
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:45,548
isn't it ironic that the one
lawyer-- the only lawyer--
who felt something...

1023
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:48,050
should be brought up
before your ethics committee ?

1024
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:52,054
arthur, please stop trying to
make yourself out to be the only
sensitive person around here.

1025
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:56,559
i know.  i know jay
was hurting.  i know that !
that's not the point !

1026
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:59,562
the point is,
he is not functioning
properly because of it.

1027
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:02,565
he's all right.
he just needs a little time,
that's all.

1028
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:04,567
i've taken over
most of his court cases.

1029
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:09,071
he's-he's puttin'
his emphasis on contracts.
now lay off him, okay ?

1030
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:12,074
it's not up to me, arthur.
i'm just trying to let you know
what's going on.

1031
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:15,077
i just love the way
the hierarchy works !

1032
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:18,581
i mean,
you're goin' after guys
like jay or whoever,

1033
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:21,584
and nobody is doing anything
about judge rayford,

1034
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:24,587
who happens to be
a suicidal maniac.

1035
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:27,089
rayford ?
rayford !

1036
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:29,592
the man is bent
on killing himself.
it's no secret.

1037
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:33,596
a court bailiff found him
in his chambers trying
to hang himself once.

1038
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:36,098
you know where he spends
his lunch every day ?
no.

1039
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:40,603
outside his window
on the ledge,
four stories high.

1040
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:44,106
now this is a man
who's making value decisions
on people's lives every day.

1041
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:48,611
wait a minute !
now, his personal behavior
is not affecting his work.

1042
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,614
oh, you know that for sure ?
yes, i've worked with him.
he's an excellent judge !

1043
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:55,117
-and jay's an excellent lawyer !
-i know.  hewas
 an excellent lawyer.

1044
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:57,119
that's not the point.
the point is...

1045
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:01,123
his problems are affecting
his ability to serve
his clients,

1046
01:11:01,123 --> 01:11:04,627
and that's why the committee
wants to see him.

1047
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:07,129
[ sighs ]

1048
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:11,634
[ both sighing ]
oh, god.

1049
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:24,146
you know,
there are times...

1050
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:26,649
when i'm not too sure
i like you.

1051
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:37,159
i mean, we are
so opposite...

1052
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,663
how we feel
about things, gail.

1053
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,672
maybe that's good.

1054
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:55,678
that's perfect,
right ?
right.

1055
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,681
as long as we just keep
a little friction between us,
there's...

1056
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:01,183
no problems.
no problems.

1057
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:41,223
that's all the photos
in the fleming case.

1058
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:46,228
and here's the name and address
of a witness that lives
in leah shepard's neighborhood.

1059
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:49,231
he thinks you oughta
see this guy yourself.
what's this say ?

1060
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:52,735
reisler ?  "riesler" ?
reisler.
yeah, reisler.

1061
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:06,248
she's a little constipated,
i think.  she's got
that look on her face.

1062
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:08,250
yeah.

1063
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:12,755
you say you saw somebody
go into leah shepard's house
the night she was attacked ?

1064
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:15,758
can you describe
that person to me ?

1065
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:20,262
well, i'd say he was
a young fella,

1066
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:23,265
small build,
maybe about 5'6", 5'7",
something like that.

1067
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:27,269
cherry ?
no, no, thanks.

1068
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:30,272
small fella, huh ?
yeah.

1069
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:32,775
would you be able
to identify him
if you saw him again ?

1070
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:35,778
no.  no, it was too dark,
too-too far.

1071
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:40,282
you knew about this publicity
this case has been getting ?
yeah.

1072
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:42,785
newspapers about
judge fleming and all ?
oh, yeah, sure.

1073
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:47,289
and you knew this information.
how come you didn't report it
to the police ?

1074
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:50,793
i went to the police.
i went down there and told them
i had information for them,

1075
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:52,795
and they told me to wait there
on the bench.

1076
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:56,298
i waited and hour, two hours,
three hours.

1077
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:58,300
finally, turned around,
went home.  i left.

1078
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:03,305
i couldn't spend
the whole night there.

1079
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:05,808
you know leah shepard,
mr. reisler ?

1080
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:10,813
oh, to say, you know,
to wave to her, say hello.

1081
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:14,817
would you testify
what you just said
in court ?

1082
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:21,323
i guess i would
if i had to,
but i'll tell ya,

1083
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:24,326
i really don't wanna
get involved.

1084
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:26,328
and then what happened,
officer ?

1085
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:28,831
i told him to move on,

1086
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:32,835
but he continued to use
profanity, and he refused
to leave the premises.

1087
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,837
what sort of profanity ?

1088
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:38,340
you know, the normal kind.

1089
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,343
officer leary,
we've all heard
these words before.

1090
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:43,846
now, for the record,
what did he say ?

1091
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:50,352
he used "fuck" a lot,

1092
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:54,356
[ chuckling ]
and "piss on you"...

1093
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:58,360
and said he was
going to "bunghole"
the short order chef,

1094
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:01,363
was gonna "cream"
on the waitress.

1095
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:04,366
[ laughing continues ]
stuff like that,
your honor.

1096
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:06,869
there's a very good reason
for all that, your honor.

1097
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:10,372
oh ?
what is that ?

1098
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:14,376
- i'm a diabetic.
-[ laughter ]

1099
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:18,881
i fail to see the connection.
i've never heard of diabetes
causing foul language.

1100
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:22,384
that's because
you're a douche bag.

1101
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:32,394
make sure this man gets over
to the hospital this afternoon
for psychiatric evaluation.

1102
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:35,898
i will withhold a verdict
pending a medical report.

1103
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:38,901
son of a bitch.
day in, day out,
the same goddamn thing.

1104
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:43,906
most of these people
belong in a mental home,
for christ's sakes.

1105
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:47,910
that judge is slower
than the 6:00 news.

1106
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,912
so what can you
do for me ?
a year.

1107
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:52,414
what ?  are you kidding ?
i thought it was bargain day.

1108
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:56,418
make it six months,
and i think he'll buy it.
all right.  what else you got ?

1109
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,924
fenwick.
mm, 18 months.

1110
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:04,426
eighteen months ?

1111
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:09,431
good luck.
you tell him.

1112
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:11,433
the son of a bitch is crazy.
he'd just as soon snap
your neck.

1113
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:15,437
all right, tell him a year.
the offer's only good for today.

1114
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:18,941
oh, frank, come on.

1115
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:20,943
he's got beady eyes.
 he's a maniac.

1116
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:23,445
last week, he got mad,
he bit off two of
his cell mate's fingers.

1117
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:25,447
i don't have the nerve
to tell him he's gotta spend
a year in jail.

1118
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:28,450
that's the best i can do.
i'm just not in a good mood,
you know ?

1119
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,953
- frank.
- yeah, here i am.

1120
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:32,955
is that it ?
yeah, that's it.

1121
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:34,957
i'll have to get back to you
on fenwick.

1122
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:38,460
gotta talk to you.
i got a case
coming up here, art.

1123
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:40,963
and then what happened,
mr. saltzman ?

1124
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:45,968
[ mumbles ]
this punk kept pulling
my wife's purse,

1125
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:47,970
and she wouldn't let go.

1126
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:52,975
so i tried to get him off.
he pushes me aside,
and then he knocks...

1127
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:56,478
my wife into a wall--
you want
the good news first ?

1128
01:16:56,478 --> 01:17:00,983
shoot.
fleming passed the polygraph.

1129
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:05,487
and i got an eyewitness.

1130
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:08,991
in that case, your honor,
we will call the defendant
to the stand.

1131
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,993
very well.

1132
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:13,996
and as far as
your star witness goes--
leah shepard--

1133
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:17,499
well, we know about her
and her credibility.

1134
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:21,003
so you want me to throw
the whole fleming thing
out the window, is that it ?

1135
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:23,005
i got you by the balls,
frank.

1136
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:25,507
he's innocent.
 he's innocent.

1137
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:28,010
yeah, well,
if the d.a.'s office
drops this case now,

1138
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:30,012
everybody's gonna be
screaming political deal.

1139
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:33,515
the old lady kept hanging on.
she lets go of that purse,
i'm on my way.

1140
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:37,519
but, ma'am, she just
kept hanging on.  i don't
mean no harm or nothing.

1141
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:41,023
but you're the one
who's gonna come out of this
looking like a jerk.

1142
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:44,526
well, maybe,
but let me tell you
something, arthur.

1143
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:46,528
if this is one of
your run-of-the-mill
saturday night killings,

1144
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:49,531
maybe we could deal.
i'm not dealing with you.

1145
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:52,034
this is too hot.
this is not a trade-off.

1146
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:56,038
[ chattering ]
any further questions
from the state ?

1147
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:58,040
what the hell
are you doing ?
this is a dream !

1148
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,542
it's a dream come true.
you're not gonna spoil it.

1149
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:03,545
when i get fleming down,
i'm gonna tear him apart,
crucify him.

1150
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:08,050
my client, mr. avillar,
has no prior criminal record.
he merely wanted her money.

1151
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:13,555
this is the super bowl, art.
it's the super bowl,
and i'm the quarterback.

1152
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:16,558
and there's
three seconds left to go,
and i drop back to pass,

1153
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:19,061
and there's a touchdown !

1154
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:22,064
fleming's carried out
on a stretcher.
it's that big, art.

1155
01:18:22,064 --> 01:18:26,068
[ judge ]
i find you guilty,
but i'm not going to jail you.

1156
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:29,071
i'm placing you on probation
for one year.

1157
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:33,575
one year probation ?
what kind of punishment
is that ?

1158
01:18:33,575 --> 01:18:36,578
they're getting
real pissed off at the law

i can't tell him
to be patient.
good.

1300
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:54,912
prison should be
a frightening place.

1301
01:28:55,413 --> 01:28:57,915
let those criminals create
their own hellhole.

1302
01:28:57,915 --> 01:29:01,419
are you crazy ?
what are you talking
to me about ?

1303
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:06,924
i tell you, arthur, the idea
of punishment to fit the crime
doesn't work.

1304
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:09,427
we need unjust punishment !

1305
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:13,431
hang somebody
for armed robbery !
try it.

1306
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:15,433
we've got nothing to lose.

1307
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:18,436
do you understand
what i'm saying to you,
for god sake ?

1308
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:20,938
you don't, do you ?
[ sighs ]

1309
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:25,443
you fellas with your fancy ideas
of rehabilitation.

1310
01:29:26,944 --> 01:29:31,949
i tell you that the concept
of rehabilitation is a farce.

1311
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:34,952
do you honestly think that--

1312
01:29:34,952 --> 01:29:38,956
that bringing johnny cash
into prisons
to sing railroad songs...

1313
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:41,959
is gonna
rehabilitate anyone ?

1314
01:29:41,959 --> 01:29:47,465
most people are sick
and tired of mugging
and crime in the streets.

1315
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:50,968
do you hear what
i'm telling you, arthur ?
arthur ?  arthur !

1316
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:53,471
come on, let's move !
let's go !

1317
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:56,474
sir, could you tell us
what's going on ?
please give us your statement.

1318
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:58,976

01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:06,984
please, just a statement.
that's all we want.

01:30:06,984 --> 01:30:08,986
move out of the way.
move out of the way.
move back.

1322
01:30:08,986 --> 01:30:10,988
how many hostages
is he holding ?

1323
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:14,492
here.
you take the back.

1324
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:18,496
the clinic doctor felt he was
well enough to be sent back
to his cell and was signing--

1325
01:30:18,996 --> 01:30:21,999
look, i'm not sure what
happened, but all of a sudden,
mccullaugh had a gun.

1326
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:24,001
these guards, i don't know
where they come from.

1327
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:27,004
no training, no education.
and motivation ?  forget it.

1328
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:30,007
i hope you've got this thing
under control.  i don't want
anything crazy happening.

1329
01:30:30,007 --> 01:30:32,009
we're doing what we can.
we can't sit on this for long.

1330
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:36,013
there are too many
goddamn criminals
in this building.

excuse me, warden.

1334
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:56,033
i'm sorry, but i couldn't
hold onto him any longer.
he had to go back.

1335
01:30:56,033 --> 01:31:00,037
he had to, huh ?
look, look, that's not
even the point.

1336
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:04,542
i'm surprised he's even awake.
i loaded him up on tranqs
before it was time to leave.

1337

i'm all right.

1343
01:31:41,078 --> 01:31:44,081
can i come in here
a little further, jeff ?
where are you ?

1344
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:47,084
i'm out here

can you see me ?

1348
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:06,604
could i come in,
you think ?

1349
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:10,107
um, yeah, i guess so.

1350
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:14,612

i mean, me,
taking hostages.

1358
01:32:50,147 --> 01:32:52,149
that's what's
really crazy.

you know, i don't know
what the hell i'm doing.

1360
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,153
it took me 40 minutes
to tie these guys up,

1361
01:32:56,654 --> 01:32:58,656
'cause i couldn't figure out
how to make a good knot.

i mean, would you know
how to do that ?

1363
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:04,662
i don't know.
 i guess i would--

1364
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:07,665
i-- i don't know.
i guess you-you make
a square knot.

1365
01:33:08,165 --> 01:33:12,169
and that's the easiest.
i don't know.

would you like to take a look
to see if i did these okay ?

01:40:37,614 --> 01:40:41,118
a check on me ?
yeah.

1447
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:45,622
yeah, zinoff requested it.
i had no idea why.
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1448
01:40:45,622 --> 01:40:49,626
you mean to tell me,
while we were
sleeping together,

1449
01:40:49,626 --> 01:40:53,630
you and the fellas
were making decisions
on my life ?

1450
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:55,632
arthur !
gail, on my life ?

1451
01:40:56,133 --> 01:40:58,135
would you just let me
finish, please ?

1452
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:00,637
the next thing i knew,
zinoff stepped in,

1453
01:41:00,637 --> 01:41:03,640
he said he wanted
to personally review
your case.

1454
01:41:04,141 --> 01:41:06,143
i swear to god, arthur,
 i had no idea.

1455
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:09,146
jesus.
this whole thing stinks !

1456
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:14,151
okay, arthur, if you feel
that way about it,
then fight 'em.

1457
01:41:14,151 --> 01:41:18,655
go ahead.
go up against them,
take the consequences.

1458
01:41:18,655 --> 01:41:20,657
the consequences ?

1459
01:41:20,657 --> 01:41:25,162
the consequences are that
i'll be disbarred, gail.
i know that.  that's right.

1460
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:29,166
i'm a lawyer.
that's all i know.
then do it.  defend fleming.

1461
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:32,669
you'll win the case.
no disbarment, right ?

1462
01:41:32,669 --> 01:41:35,172
you'll end up being
a very important lawyer.

1463
01:41:35,672 --> 01:41:38,175
the judge is guilty...
w-w-wait a minute.

1464
01:41:38,175 --> 01:41:41,178
of beating and raping
a woman.
wait !  you're talking crazy.

1465
01:41:41,178 --> 01:41:43,180
you don't know he's guilty.

1466
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:47,684
you're making an assumption
he's guilty because you hate him
so much, right ?

1467
01:41:47,684 --> 01:41:50,687
even if he is,
what difference does it make ?
come on.

1468
01:41:50,687 --> 01:41:54,691
a defense lawyer has to
defend people who are guilty.
you know that.

1469
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:04,201
would you defend him ?
if you were me,
would you do it ?

1470
01:42:04,201 --> 01:42:08,705
i would, arthur, 'cause
it's my job, you know ?

1471
01:42:09,206 --> 01:42:14,711
look, you took an oath
to defend your clients
to the best of your ability.

1472
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:18,715
now, if you can't do that,
then get out.

1473
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:13,770
where'd you get these ?

1474
01:43:13,770 --> 01:43:17,774
i've been carrying 'em around
for a couple of days.

1475
01:43:17,774 --> 01:43:20,277
i'd like to know
what they mean.

1476
01:43:24,781 --> 01:43:27,784
i see the wheels spinning.

1477
01:43:27,784 --> 01:43:30,787
sex photos, sex crime.
is he guilty ?

1478
01:43:30,787 --> 01:43:33,290
is he ?

1479
01:43:39,296 --> 01:43:41,298
yes.

1480
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:47,304
what about the polygraph ?

1481
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:50,807
the eyewitness ?
how'd you do that ?

1482
01:43:50,807 --> 01:43:53,810
those were taken care of
for me.

1483
01:43:58,315 --> 01:44:04,321
so-- so now you have it.

1484
01:44:08,325 --> 01:44:12,329
well, i'll see you
in court, arthur.

1485
01:44:17,834 --> 01:44:20,337
oh, you forgot these.

1486
01:44:32,849 --> 01:44:34,851
so you're home
on leave.

1487
01:44:37,854 --> 01:44:40,357
arthur's in
the coast guard.

1488
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:44,361
i don't understand.
he's gettin' worse.

1489
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:46,863
it depends.
he comes, he goes.

1490
01:44:50,367 --> 01:44:53,870
you didn't come
for three weeks.
he missed you very much.

1491
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:56,873
oh, yeah, well,
i was busy, arnie.

1492
01:44:56,873 --> 01:45:01,378
you know, i had
the trial and all.
i know, i know.

1493
01:45:01,878 --> 01:45:06,383
it's important to you.
but you missed three tuesdays,
so he lost his sense of time.

1494
01:45:08,385 --> 01:45:10,887
you know, arnie,

1495
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:13,890
i don't know what i'd do
if he goes.

1496
01:45:16,393 --> 01:45:18,895
he's the only family
i got.

1497
01:45:18,895 --> 01:45:21,398
he's very proud of you.

1498
01:45:24,901 --> 01:45:28,405
i'm a lawyer
because of him.

1499
01:45:32,909 --> 01:45:37,414
he wanted it for me,
and he made sure i got it.

1500
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:40,417
to him,

1501
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:45,422
being a lawyer was
the finest thing
you could be.

1502
01:45:46,923 --> 01:45:48,925
[ groaning ]

1503
01:45:50,927 --> 01:45:52,929
[ groaning continues ]
[ knocking ]

1504
01:45:52,929 --> 01:45:55,932
- your honor,
  court's about to begin.
- [ coughing ]

1505
01:45:55,932 --> 01:45:59,436
coming !
[ spits ]
coming !

1506
01:46:11,448 --> 01:46:13,867
[ crowd chattering ]

1507
01:46:29,883 --> 01:46:32,886
you must admit,
she's an attractive woman.

1508
01:46:32,886 --> 01:46:35,389
i wouldn't mind seeing her
again some time.

1509
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:38,392
you're gonna be fine.
take the stand.
answer simply and directly.

1510
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:44,898
silence !
all rise !

1511
01:46:44,898 --> 01:46:48,402
all persons having matters
before this court draw near
and give your attention !

1512
01:46:48,902 --> 01:46:51,405
the honorable
francis rayford presiding.

1513
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:54,908
[ coughing ]
be seated !

1514
01:46:57,411 --> 01:46:59,913
so it's really
very simple.

1515
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:08,422
we have a judge,
a symbol of justice here...

1516
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:13,927
who's accused...

1517
01:47:13,927 --> 01:47:17,431
of raping and brutally beating
this young girl right here.

1518
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:24,938
now, we can do
something about it,
and we can do it today,

1519
01:47:24,938 --> 01:47:26,940
and we can do it together.

1520
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:32,946
let's make this
our goal-line stand.

1521
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:39,953
just give me a verdict
of guilty.

1522
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:44,458
i need your help.

1523
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,462
thank you.
[ applause ]

1524
01:47:51,965 --> 01:47:56,970
prosecutor's completed
his opening statement.
defense counsel ready ?

1525
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:00,474
yes, your honor.

1526
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:08,482
your honor, mr. foreman,
ladies and gentleman
of the jury,

1527
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:13,487
my name is arthur kirkland,
and i am the defense counsel...

1528
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:18,992
for the defendant,
judge henry t. fleming.

1529
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:25,499
now that man over there,
he's the prosecuting attorney,

1530
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:30,003
and he couldn't be
happier today.

1531
01:48:30,003 --> 01:48:33,006
he is a happy man today...

1532
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:36,510
because today he's going
after a judge.

1533
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:39,513
and if he gets him--

1534
01:48:41,014 --> 01:48:43,016
if he gets him,
he's gonna be a star.

1535
01:48:43,517 --> 01:48:49,022
he's gonna have his name
in this month'slaw review,
centerfold,

1536
01:48:49,022 --> 01:48:51,024
"lawyer of the month."

1537
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:56,530
now, in order
to win this case,

1538
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:58,532
he needs... you.

1539
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:02,536
naturally.
you're all he's got.
believe me.

1540
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:07,541
so he's counting on tapping
that emotion in you which says,

1541
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:11,545
"let's get somebody in power.
  let's get a judge."

1542
01:49:13,547 --> 01:49:15,549
however, these proceedings
are not about that.

1543
01:49:16,049 --> 01:49:21,054
these proceedings are here
to see that justice is done.

1544
01:49:22,055 --> 01:49:26,059
and justice is,
as any reasonable person
would tell ya,

1545
01:49:26,059 --> 01:49:28,562
the finding of the truth.

1546
01:49:28,562 --> 01:49:31,064
and what is
the truth today ?

1547
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:35,569
one truth--
a tragic one--

1548
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:39,072
is that that girl
has been beaten
and raped.

1549
01:49:39,072 --> 01:49:43,577
another truth is
that the prosecution
doesn't have a witness,

1550
01:49:43,577 --> 01:49:48,081
does not have one piece
of substantiating evidence...

1551
01:49:48,081 --> 01:49:52,586
other than the testimony
of the victim herself.

1552
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:59,092
another truth is
that my client voluntarily--

1553
01:49:59,092 --> 01:50:01,595
and the prosecution
is well aware of this fact--

1554
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:04,097
voluntarily took
a lie detector test--

1555
01:50:04,097 --> 01:50:06,099
objection, your honor,
that's inadmissible evidence !
objection !

1556
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:10,103
- come on, arthur.
- he told the truth.

1557
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:12,606
the jury will disregard
that remark.

1558
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:15,609
polygraph tests
have not been proven
100 percent reliable,

1559
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:17,611
therefore, inadmissible
in a court of law.

1560
01:50:17,611 --> 01:50:19,613
sorry, your honor.

1561
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:25,118
let's get back to justice.

1562
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:29,122
what is justice ?

1563
01:50:29,122 --> 01:50:31,625
what is the intention
of justice ?

1564
01:50:34,127 --> 01:50:38,632
the intention of justice
is to see that the guilty people
are proven guilty...

1565
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:40,634
and that the innocent
are freed.

1566
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:44,137
simple, isn't it ?

1567
01:50:44,137 --> 01:50:46,640
only it's not that simple.

1568
01:50:48,141 --> 01:50:52,646
however, it is
the defense counselor's duty...

1569
01:50:52,646 --> 01:50:54,648
to protect the rights
of the individual,

1570
01:50:55,148 --> 01:50:57,651
as it is
the prosecution's duty...

1571
01:50:57,651 --> 01:51:02,656
to uphold and defend
the laws of the state.

1572
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:04,658
justice for all.

1573
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:09,663
only we have a problem here.

1574
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:13,166
you know what it is ?

1575
01:51:13,166 --> 01:51:16,169
both sides wanna win.

1576
01:51:18,171 --> 01:51:20,674
we wanna win.

1577
01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:23,677
we wanna win,
regardless of the truth,

1578
01:51:23,677 --> 01:51:26,680
and we wanna win
regardless of justice,

1579
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:30,183
regardless of who's guilty
or innocent.

1580
01:51:30,684 --> 01:51:32,686
winning...

1581
01:51:33,687 --> 01:51:35,689
is everything.

1582
01:51:37,691 --> 01:51:40,193
that man there wants
a win so badly today.

1583
01:51:40,193 --> 01:51:43,196
it means so much to him.

1584
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:46,199
he is so carried away
with the prospect
of winning,

1585
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:51,705
the idea...
that he forgot something...

1586
01:51:52,205 --> 01:51:55,709
that's absolutely essential
to today's proceedings.

1587
01:51:57,711 --> 01:51:59,713
he forgot his case.

1588
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:04,217
he forgot to bring it.
i don't know.
i don't see it.  do you ?

1589
01:52:04,217 --> 01:52:07,721
the prosecution's case--
he's gotta have one.

1590
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:13,226
not a witness !
not one piece of
substantiating evidence...

1591
01:52:13,226 --> 01:52:17,230
other than the testimony
of the victim herself.

1592
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:19,733
ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1593
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:22,736
i have a case
to end all cases.

1594
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:27,741
[ sighs ]
i have witnesses
for my client.

1595
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:31,745
i have character references,
testimonials,

1596
01:52:32,245 --> 01:52:35,749
that are backed up
from here to washington d.c.

1597

- [ both ]  objection !

1598
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:41,254

1599
01:52:41,254 --> 01:52:43,256
mr. kirkland,
you are out of order !

1600
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:51,264
one thing...
that bothered me--

1601
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:56,269
the one thing
that stayed in my mind,
and i couldn't get rid of it,

1602
01:52:56,269 --> 01:52:58,772
that haunted me...

1603
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:00,774
was why.

1604
01:53:02,275 --> 01:53:04,277
why would she lie ?

1605
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,282
what was her motive
for lying ?

1606
01:53:09,282 --> 01:53:13,787
if my client is innocent,
she's lying.

1607
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:15,789
why ?

1608
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:19,292
was it blackmail ?

1609
01:53:20,293 --> 01:53:23,296
no.

1610
01:53:23,296 --> 01:53:25,799
was it jealousy ?

1611
01:53:25,799 --> 01:53:27,801
no.

1612
01:53:29,302 --> 01:53:34,808
yesterday i found out why.
[ sniffles ]

1613
01:53:39,813 --> 01:53:42,816
she doesn't have a motive.

1614
01:53:45,318 --> 01:53:46,820
you know why ?

1615
01:53:49,322 --> 01:53:51,825
because she's not lying.

1616
01:53:53,326 --> 01:53:55,829
and ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1617
01:53:57,831 --> 01:54:00,333

that man today !

1619

i'm gonna get him !

1620
01:54:09,843 --> 01:54:11,845
