26
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:21,435
Relations take different forms.

27
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:26,513
They shape into new generations.

28
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:34,180
Generations pass away.

29
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:38,517
Making a new saga every time.

30
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:44,500
Because even a mother-in-law
was once a daughter-in-law!

31
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:49,896
Even a mother-in-law was once a daughter-in-law!

32
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:55,744
Because even a mother-in-law
was once a daughter-in-law!

33
00:03:56,981 --> 00:04:01,645
Even a mother-in-law was once a daughter-in-law!

34
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:11,455
People will watch it together.

Let's go! lt's clear.

47
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:41,785

48
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:43,919
Come out!

49
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:46,051

50
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:49,417
Rogue!

00:05:54,298 --> 00:05:55,424
He has locked it.

54
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:56,898
Wait!

55
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:00,494
Get the bomb.
- Give me the bomb!

56
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:02,169
Wait!

57
00:06:03,107 --> 00:06:04,267
Bend down!

58
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:11,207
Aim from every hole.

59
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:13,379
Turn this palace into an open space.

60
00:06:14,051 --> 00:06:14,847
Give me the bomb!

61
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:19,486

Where are you?

64
00:06:43,213 --> 00:06:44,043
Come out!

65
00:06:44,782 --> 00:06:45,976
Come out!

66
00:06:47,484 --> 00:06:48,382
Yes, Qasim!

l have found the back door.
Give me the order!

68
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:53,819
Don't spare anyone alive

69
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:57,359
Understood! Kill everyone

70
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:15,378
Fix a bomb.

71
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:22,311
Start firing.

72
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:38,293
Fire upstairs.

73
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,298
Come fast.

74
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,567
Kill everyone.

75
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:49,140

76
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:51,246

77
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:55,275
Fire!

78
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:12,499
Whose call it is?

79
00:08:17,474 --> 00:08:20,807
l'm not a hero..

80
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:23,774
..but a villain!

81
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:27,313
l'm not a hero..

82
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:32,885
The phone is ringing.

83
00:08:37,728 --> 00:08:38,592
No one is inside.

84
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:42,031
l don't know..

85
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,563
l'm just worth for a death.

86
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:51,732
l'm not a hero..

87
00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:54,970
..but a villain!

88
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:56,706
Ring is over.

89
00:08:58,315 --> 00:08:59,612
l think they're dead.

90
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:02,111
Let's go.

91
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,487
Let's go.

92
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:09,151
Fazal Khan is dead!

93
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,519
Let's go.

94
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:13,255
Matter is over.

95
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:20,503
Now we'll know who died and who survived.

96
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:22,295
Poor family!

97
00:09:22,773 --> 00:09:23,797
Qasim!

98
00:09:24,207 --> 00:09:25,265
Move!

99
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,210
Let's go back.

100
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:30,337
They're dead.

101
00:09:30,547 --> 00:09:33,175
l was about to shoot Vinod on his
ass but he came to my front.

102
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,918
You should have told him.

103
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:39,282
We'd have got him with us.

104
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:40,750
Shall we get them in our jeep?

105
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,289
Let them collect the bodies.

106
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,326
Anchor asked to Minister on TV

107
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,291
Tell me our national anthem.

108
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:49,220
So he started singing.

109
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,531
The fellows are worth praising.

110
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:53,731
The fellows are worth praising.

111
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:55,470
Thats our minister.

112
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:56,969
You know what?

113
00:09:57,374 --> 00:09:59,308
Nicer than the world.. - Hello!

114
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:03,240
Yes. Fazal Khan is dead

115
00:10:04,414 --> 00:10:08,214
ln a heavy firing, l have demolished his entire castle.

116
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:10,682
Brother!

117
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:13,151
Stop the car!
lts police check post

118
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:17,018
Why this police check post is here?

119
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,928
What we do now?. Shall we go?

120
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:22,089
He disconnected the phone.

121
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:23,196
Leave it! Let's go.

122
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,000
This check post is for us.

123
00:10:30,307 --> 00:10:31,239
Abbas! 
- Yes.

124
00:10:31,975 --> 00:10:33,067
He's dead.

125
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:36,474
What are you doing? No, don't go.

126
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:40,146
Fire!

127
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:42,650
Brother!

128
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,295
There are two kinds of human

129
00:11:02,806 --> 00:11:05,741
One form is Clever and second form is stupid

130
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:08,243
And this game is based upon these two kind of humans

131
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:11,847
Now when some clever human started foolish things

132
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:15,084
and when some fool has become a part of cleverness

133
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:16,149
You never find out

134
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,451
This Wasseypur's story is strange

135
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:19,753
lf you will see from outside

136
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:21,446
then Wasseypur is the village of decent men

137
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:22,922
but when you enter inside...

138
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,287
then there are lot of bastards are hidden inside...

139
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:29,361
Now what they have been proved
in the end that's another thing.

140
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,999
at least they all think themselves Clever in their lives...

141
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,995
We muslim's battle is not today's war.

142
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:37,601
it has been running since centuries...

143
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:40,705
And in Wasseypur this fight was
not between Shia and Sunni.

144
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:42,306
All of them were Sunni

145
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:46,173
This fight was between Qureshis and other muslims...

146
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,439
lt has announced war later

147
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:48,809
earlier it was one sided attacks...

148
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:51,484
Qureshi were butchers...

149
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:53,449
and Everyone was scared from Butchers.

150
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:56,089
They scared the people...

151
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:59,256
Now Qureshis were ruling in Wasseypur.

152
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:02,863
When this village was outside the Dhanbad.

153
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:06,402
and then Dhanbad become a part of Bengal.

154
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,271
After freedom Dhanbad went to Bihar

155
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:14,006
and Wasseypur has become a part of Dhanbad

156
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:16,307
Now Dhanbad is in Jharkandh

157
00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:18,571
And Wasseypur is in the centre of Dhanbad

158
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:19,677
Anyway!

159
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:20,941
Story is still running

160
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:22,342
But it was started

161
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:23,985
when around Dhanbad...

162
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:26,312
British has occupied all the harvests

163
00:12:26,523 --> 00:12:28,923
and started coal business

164
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,556
when trains runs with coal...

165
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:35,059
and all factories and machines runs with coal

166
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:38,559
When Sultana dacoit used to live here...

167
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:40,461
and he robbed their trains

168
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:44,871
That man attacked on british
trains and robbed their treasures

169
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:47,800
One day force were travelling
in train instead of treasure

170
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:50,336
when Sultana attacked on the train

171
00:12:50,747 --> 00:12:53,215
British has arrested him and
sentenced them life imprisonment.

172
00:12:53,717 --> 00:12:56,914
Mulla told me that British gave him death sentence

173
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:58,686
Shut up! 
- Yes.

174
00:12:58,922 --> 00:13:00,651
Your Moulvi is a stupid man

175
00:13:01,224 --> 00:13:03,419
Actually Sultana was Qureshi

176
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:05,189
And in history, he was the second man..

177
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:06,725
..that escaped from the life imprisonment.

178
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:08,255
Was he Sultana? 
- Yes.

179
00:13:08,498 --> 00:13:09,658
He is alive? 
- Yes.

180
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,766
He is in Wasseypur.

181
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:13,532
and british is still looking for him..

182
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:50,407
..and he's still robbing their trains

183
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:51,339
C'mon!

184
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:53,200
Get in!

185
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,407
We have removed the tracks

186
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:58,273
lf you will drive lt then you will be stuck

187
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:01,606
There is nothing ln train but food bags

188
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:03,251
We are also businessmen

189
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,110
We are not dacoits who came to rob the money

190
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:08,050
We have quit rob the treasure...

191
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:11,550
Now Sultana robs the food bags

192
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:14,625
May l go?

193
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:17,891
You have train.

194
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:19,594
and l have bull cart.

195
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,531
So until l don't return and ask you to leave..

196
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:24,400
..till then sit here...

197
00:14:25,308 --> 00:14:26,969
Sit down!

198
00:14:28,311 --> 00:14:29,141
Sit down!

199
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:37,348
Quick! Hurry up!

200
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:42,550
Be quick! C'mon!

201
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,351
Fast!

202
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:54,530
Where is the car?
- l don't know

203
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,266
Open the box l will check...
- Okay.

204
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:03,807
Why did you stop the train?

205
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,604
Train is empty

206
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:07,407
Why all boxes are empty?

207
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:09,246
Sultana dacoit came...

208
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:11,320
he robbed all the food...

209
00:15:13,556 --> 00:15:15,786
There is someone who is robbing the train with my name

210
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:17,886
Who could he be?

211
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:19,317
Who?

212
00:15:20,764 --> 00:15:21,788
Shahid Khan!

213
00:15:22,232 --> 00:15:24,200
He is only person who have horse

214
00:15:26,102 --> 00:15:27,467
Salutation! 
- Salutation!

215
00:15:28,438 --> 00:15:29,769
But his horse used for commercial purpose

216
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:31,130
lt was...

217
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:32,465
..but now he sell food...

218
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:46,055
How is your business?

219
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:47,746
Entire market is finished...

220
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:51,121
He is selling the food in cheap prices

221
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:54,227
lf we will try to fight So we will be finish...

222
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:57,196
5.. 6.. 7..

223
00:15:58,301 --> 00:15:59,598
And Shahid!

224
00:16:00,971 --> 00:16:02,131
When your younger brother will come?

225
00:16:03,473 --> 00:16:04,599
He should have come in 2 months

226
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:07,136
Rest is upto God.

227
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:10,211
Allah!

228
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:14,779
Train track passes from the Qureshi neighbourhood

229
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:17,150
only qureshi lives both side of the track

230
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:21,157
So Qureshi have right on every train

231
00:16:21,391 --> 00:16:22,358
..nor any pathan.

232
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:25,717
Look!

233
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:27,520
l just want to tell you one thing

234
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:29,722
Whatever you do..

235
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:31,493
..but don't do blood bath.

236
00:16:32,802 --> 00:16:34,633
Shahid is also belongs to this Wasseypur

237
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:36,270
But he doesn't belongs to our caste...

238
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:38,837
lf we will be caught so we appologize to Mukhtar Sahab

239
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:40,570
He won't kill us

240
00:16:41,344 --> 00:16:42,504
lf he will kill us then...

241
00:16:45,348 --> 00:16:46,576
He won't do it

242
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:48,275
l know him

243
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:50,283
Dog never change it's breed

244
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,655
lf you don't beat the horse so he never run

245
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:54,417
Shahid was stubborn like that

246
00:16:54,924 --> 00:16:55,913
His life was in danger

247
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:58,227
Everyone knew that who is robbing the trains...

248
00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:00,252
But how do he listen to anyone

249
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,095
Robbing was in our blood.

250
00:17:02,832 --> 00:17:04,732
Thought dark clouds were raising..

251
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:06,059
..it had to rain.

252
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,631
Are you scared?

253
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:09,871
Do you know who is Shareef Qureshi?

254
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:12,268
You are using his name

255
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:14,800
Sultana dacoit died in black water

256
00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:16,573
and the rest are stories...

257
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:19,343
He is butcher - So what will he do?

258
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:21,916
We pathans keep thousand butchers in our houses

259
00:17:22,786 --> 00:17:24,720
They are weak like their goats

260
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:34,122
And tomorrow l will remove the train from the tracks

261
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:36,999
Hit it hard.

262
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:39,228
lt's not coming out.

263
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:57,247
Here they come!

264
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:03,990
Run for your lives

265
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:12,599
Let's go.

266
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:23,071
Don't spare anyone alive.

267
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,610
Let everyone know.

268
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:09,951
How are you feeling?

269
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,449
Better.
- Lie down!

270
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,926
Chief!

271
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:25,169
Where is everyone?

272
00:19:26,075 --> 00:19:27,201
Only l'm alive

273
00:19:28,444 --> 00:19:29,741
They have killed all of them

274
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,375
You said that they won't do anything

275
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:39,651
tell him to leave Wasseypur with his family

276
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:42,087
We will go...

277
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:45,058
but ask him how l will feed them

278
00:19:45,628 --> 00:19:46,652
and by the way what have l done with him

279
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:49,126
You're using my name to rob trains.

280
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:51,959
Tell him to leave.

281
00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:55,167
One food bag

282
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:59,099
will reach to your home from every train

283
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:01,971
Okay.. okay.

284
00:20:02,512 --> 00:20:04,139
Don't give him any food bag

285
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,381
Shahid khan must Escaped for his life.

286
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:13,783
but he was not a coward

287
00:20:14,324 --> 00:20:16,392
He knew that Qureshi
won't spare him

288
00:20:41,818 --> 00:20:43,086
We settled down in Dhanbad.

289
00:20:43,086 --> 00:20:43,484
We settled down in Dhanbad.

290
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:46,883
Shahid's wife gave him his kid's swear

291
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:49,248
that he will quit his bad habits

292
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:50,618
and he will find a job.

293
00:20:58,034 --> 00:21:00,559
Bear a little pain.

294
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:02,065
Bear it, my dear.

295
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,567
Bear it!

296
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:05,273
Call her husband.

297
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:15,943
Please stop the work

298
00:21:16,386 --> 00:21:17,683
Water is pouring inside...

299
00:21:18,021 --> 00:21:19,579
Everyone will sink down
- Do your work!

300
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:22,121
Even 9 hours are not completed from 12 hours job

00:22:58,488 --> 00:23:02,015
then l will kill you...

338
00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:04,693
Open it.

339
00:23:07,764 --> 00:23:08,696
Open it.

340
00:23:08,965 --> 00:23:09,795
How she is?

341
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:11,566
She is in pain!
- So why you didn't come earlier?

342
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:12,958
l wanted to come

343
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:14,734
but he didn't let me come

344
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:25,007
lt's been 6 hours but kid is not coming out

345
00:23:25,248 --> 00:23:27,307
what were you doing from 6 hours?
- l was coming but...

346
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,676
he pushed me away

347
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:30,079
Why didn't you tell me?

348
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,328
She's dead.

349
00:23:46,636 --> 00:23:48,297
She had heavy bleeding.

350
00:23:48,504 --> 00:23:49,903
She was in great pain.
She gave birth to a cute son.

351
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:04,883
Take care.

352
00:24:26,843 --> 00:24:29,471
We can't blame God
for life and death

353
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:33,707
We gave life with our wish and sometimes by mistake

354
00:24:34,517 --> 00:24:37,145
but people died from our mistake

355
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,985
lt wasn't that Pehelwan's mistake

356
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:41,013
who didn't let me come

357
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:42,556
lt was my mistake

358
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,253
that l defeated from that Pehelwan

359
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:48,358
And l have to suffer the punishment of my weakness

360
00:24:48,631 --> 00:24:51,657
Shahid Khan will kill our man

361
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:53,290
Who Shahid Khan?

362
00:25:14,423 --> 00:25:15,720
Hit him!

363
00:25:28,804 --> 00:25:31,398
Hit him!

364
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:39,204
Hit him!

365
00:26:01,737 --> 00:26:03,068
When the world..

366
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:06,166
..will sleep,

367
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:08,902
At the stroke of the midnight hour..

368
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:11,746
lndia will awake to life.

369
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:19,280
The real war began after the freedom.

370
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,590
After British left, all the mines..

371
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:26,453
..were distributed to Tata,
Birla and Thapa.

372
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:28,796
But there were very few who understand business.

373
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:32,095
And Ramadhir benefited the most by this decision.

374
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:33,560
He became a big head.

375
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,095
And few mines were handed over to him.

376
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:39,736
But without the labours, neither British..

377
00:26:40,242 --> 00:26:42,710
..nor these businessmen could run the mines.

378
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:44,373
And also not Ramadhir.
- Will you work for me?

379
00:26:47,116 --> 00:26:48,310
l'm already in your service.

380
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:51,146
Will you be my special worker?

381
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:56,019
You won't lack anything in life.

382
00:27:02,632 --> 00:27:06,625
Yes. - Now, l've got the contract of these mines.

383
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,337
All the coals produced here will be mine.

384
00:27:11,874 --> 00:27:14,502
Profit and loss, everything is mine.

385
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:18,942
After the British,
now the labours think that..

386
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:23,215
..the workload will reduce and they'll get more wages.

387
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,645
But it's not true.

388
00:27:25,087 --> 00:27:26,884
We've to increase the production.

389
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:29,013
For which we need more coal.

390
00:27:30,026 --> 00:27:31,254
We've to dig it more.

391
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:38,100
We've to dig a new mine..

392
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:40,096
..on the place where the labours live.

393
00:27:40,603 --> 00:27:41,433
Get lost!

394
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:43,134
British had money.

395
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:45,764
So they provided salary as well as shelter.

396
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:48,403
We're not that capable.

397
00:27:49,111 --> 00:27:52,342
We'll pay them by which they can
arrange their shelter on their own.

398
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:37,717
What happened?

399
00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:39,218
Why aren't you working?

400
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:41,354
Sir, we've been met with injustice.

401
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:43,323
Our houses are set on fire.

402
00:28:43,566 --> 00:28:45,431
We've families.

403
00:28:47,803 --> 00:28:48,929
l'm going inside for refreshment.

404
00:28:49,672 --> 00:28:51,606
l shouldn't see anyone here when l come out.

405
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:01,946
C'mon, get back to your work!

406
00:29:02,184 --> 00:29:04,516
Get lost! Join your duty.

407
00:29:04,754 --> 00:29:06,483
But you're one of us.

408
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:13,628
Get lost!

409
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:18,522
C'mon!

410
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,801
Do you want an invitation? C'mon.

411
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:48,152
Shahid! - Yes.

412
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:49,892
You think..

413
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:52,266
..you're treating your friends correctly?

414
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:57,669
No one is a friend here.

415
00:29:59,175 --> 00:30:02,338
British had left a piece of bread.
And monkeys came later.

416
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,907
And what do you think?

417
00:30:05,614 --> 00:30:07,707
Ramadahir Singh's father had left the mines for him?

418
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:10,616
Earlier British owned it..

419
00:30:11,153 --> 00:30:12,211
..and now Ramadhir Singh.

420
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:16,586
And in future, l'll own the mines by killing Ramadhir Singh.

421
00:30:35,177 --> 00:30:36,269
Shahid Khan!

422
00:30:38,781 --> 00:30:39,770
l'll see!

423
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:46,846
Yes!

424
00:30:47,256 --> 00:30:48,348
Sir is calling him.
He's in the jeep.

425
00:30:48,824 --> 00:30:49,722
Yes, l'll send him.

426
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,028
Ramadhir Singh is waiting
for you in the jeep.

427
00:30:59,134 --> 00:31:00,294
Why is he here?

428
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:02,097
lt's very precious goods.

429
00:31:02,705 --> 00:31:04,297
lt has to reach Benaras this night.

430
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:06,065
Benaras?

431
00:31:06,642 --> 00:31:08,974
Atrain will leave from Dhanbad station after 20 minutes.

432
00:31:10,012 --> 00:31:11,274
l've got your ticket.

433
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:14,213
Let's go.

434
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,778
l didn't inform my son,
he'll wait for me.

435
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:18,018
l'll send a message.

436
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:28,595
Let's go to sleep.

437
00:31:35,504 --> 00:31:36,596
Whose umbrella it is?

438
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:38,367
lt was lying here.

439
00:31:38,674 --> 00:31:40,369
Really? Show me.

440
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,777
Ramadhir Singh?

441
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,203
Escaped!

442
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,205
And the child? - He's killed.

443
00:32:49,878 --> 00:32:50,845
And the dead body?

444
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,048
l buried its pieces.

445
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:29,180
Mr Yadav? Shahid Khan.

446
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:42,993
Mr Ramadhir..

447
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:45,361
..has sent money.

448
00:34:32,347 --> 00:34:33,541
lt's pistol, right?

449
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:37,908
Will you show me?

450
00:34:40,055 --> 00:34:43,752
Running and rattling..

451
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:46,387
..playing with the rocks..

452
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,255
changing it's side every now and
then, what's made of water drops?

453
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,361
That has four letter name?

454
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:51,498
Ganga!

455
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:53,561
Shahid Khan didn't return.

456
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:55,269
We knew he will never.

457
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:58,538
Sardar grew up with my nephew Asgar.

458
00:34:58,807 --> 00:34:59,899
One day he asked me..

459
00:35:00,242 --> 00:35:01,174
..about Shahid Khan.

460
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:05,005
l told him that Ramadhir Singh had
taken away his father and killed him.

461
00:35:05,714 --> 00:35:08,740
After that Sardar's childhood ended.

462
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:11,879
He started thinking
about Ramadhir only.

463
00:35:12,254 --> 00:35:13,414
Since then he took an oath..

464
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:16,488
..that he won't grow hairs on his head..

465
00:35:16,692 --> 00:35:18,319
..until he'd avenge his father's death.

466
00:35:31,373 --> 00:35:33,170
C'mon, anyone for Girdi..

467
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:34,432
Jaliya.

468
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,407
Dhanbad! Ranchi! Wassypur!

469
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:37,406
Will you come?
- No.

470
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:39,080
C'mon, anyone for Girdi?

471
00:35:39,548 --> 00:35:41,482
Girdi! Jaliya! Ranchi!

472
00:35:41,717 --> 00:35:42,615
Dhanbad!

473
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:43,818
Girdi!

474
00:35:44,052 --> 00:35:46,077
Jariya! Dhanbad! Wassypur!

475
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:50,091
Girdi! Ranchi! Dhanbad! Wassypur!

476
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:52,357
Girdi!

477
00:35:52,661 --> 00:35:53,685
Saradar Khan, son of Shahid Khan..

478
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:58,298
..your marriage with Ms Nagma, daughter of lmtiyaz Ahmed..

479
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:01,727
..has been fixed keeping all the terms.

480
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,765
Do you accept this marriage?

481
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:05,366
Yes! l do...

482
00:36:05,674 --> 00:36:08,234
Do you accept this marriage?
- Yes! l do...

483
00:36:08,477 --> 00:36:10,411
Do you accept this marriage?

484
00:36:12,748 --> 00:36:14,909
Do you accept this marriage?

485
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:20,983
Do you want water?

486
00:36:25,494 --> 00:36:26,756
Sardar!

487
00:36:27,863 --> 00:36:28,989
Coming!

488
00:36:33,936 --> 00:36:36,200
10 trucks of Ramadhir Singh will leave from Jariya.

489
00:36:36,438 --> 00:36:37,928
Let's vacate them.

490
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:07,401
He killed my father

491
00:37:08,303 --> 00:37:11,534
My father sat in his car and gone with him

492
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:13,333
he never came back

493
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:16,607
l have only object in my life

494
00:37:17,412 --> 00:37:18,572
Revenge!

495
00:37:20,616 --> 00:37:24,552
l can't see Ramdheer Singh's progress

496
00:37:27,356 --> 00:37:29,415
l have to finish that bastard

497
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,426
l won't shoot him

498
00:37:33,996 --> 00:37:35,486
l will make fun of him

499
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:40,958
l will show him his value

500
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:46,000
Slowly, slowly l will snatch
everything from him so he will die..

501
00:37:47,409 --> 00:37:52,210
Respectable Mr Ramadhir Singh.

502
00:37:52,414 --> 00:37:54,279
Long live!

503
00:37:54,516 --> 00:37:57,314
Long live!

504
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,885
Long live!

505
00:38:00,088 --> 00:38:04,115
l am standing on this stage and promise you

506
00:38:05,594 --> 00:38:07,892
that we'll defeat the opposition.

507
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:10,654
ln 1952 when Jagjivan Raam was announced Minister

508
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:13,924
To change the situation of that time.

509
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:15,602
so he announced..

510
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:17,737
..Coal Welfare Association to see labour's condition

511
00:38:17,939 --> 00:38:19,998
as per that National Trade Union has been established

512
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:23,402
As per that Supervisors
pressurized Coal Mines Owners

513
00:38:23,612 --> 00:38:25,477
and Ramadheer Singh was the Leader of that movement

514
00:38:27,115 --> 00:38:29,208
This trade union has become a face of Mafia.

515
00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:31,818
Union Leader has become contractors

516
00:38:32,054 --> 00:38:34,579
and they were raising funds to make other labours to their workers

517
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,221
They gave money on interest

518
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:39,653
and they keep their salaries for interest

519
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:42,557
What will l eat from this?

520
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:43,890
New contractors came one by one

521
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:45,724
Ramadhir singh was already a contractor.

522
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:47,866
He has become a politician
and won the election, too.

523
00:39:04,986 --> 00:39:07,284
My dad run coal mines for many years

524
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:09,115
His name is Ramadhir Singh.

525
00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:11,522
l know how..

526
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:13,251
..how contractors and labours..

527
00:39:13,462 --> 00:39:14,861
..stealing coal and sell in black markets

528
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:16,659
l won't let this
black marketing happen

529
00:39:17,366 --> 00:39:19,300
My profit should be great

530
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:23,865
Coal is a great thing

531
00:39:25,207 --> 00:39:26,572
lt looks like stone

532
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:30,374
but it's not thick like stone

533
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:31,936
it's light weighted

534
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:36,407
if you will put it into the water

535
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:41,579
Now it will soak the water.

536
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,079
And it will become..

537
00:39:44,693 --> 00:39:45,921
Heavy

538
00:39:48,296 --> 00:39:49,354
16 Tons...

539
00:39:49,598 --> 00:39:51,190
ls it?

540
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:53,232
Yes. - Come in.

541
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:56,130
After this privatization..

542
00:39:56,805 --> 00:39:58,272
you are facing many injustices

543
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,271
Our union...

544
00:40:00,642 --> 00:40:02,132
Union for labours.

545
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:05,808
lt's lending us money and taking our salaries as interests.

546
00:40:06,014 --> 00:40:07,174
And how it's happening

547
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,708
lts all happening under Chief...

548
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:11,418
Stop, where are you going?

549
00:40:19,194 --> 00:40:20,161
l have told you

550
00:40:20,796 --> 00:40:22,525
that my share should be same like other contractors

551
00:40:22,764 --> 00:40:24,459
l am sending the stuff as per your demand

552
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:27,101
lt's going...

553
00:40:29,104 --> 00:40:30,366
..but it's not reaching there.

554
00:40:30,672 --> 00:40:32,537
Until S.P. Sinha will alive

555
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:36,235
till then nor we will eat something
neither we will have house.

556
00:40:36,545 --> 00:40:37,944
What do you think?

557
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,476
S.P. Sinha isjust educated.

558
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:43,751
He is writing in his office.

559
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:45,579
How do he know how people are stealing.

560
00:40:46,221 --> 00:40:48,451
We don't have food to eat.

561
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:50,557
And he is gardening outside his house.

562
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:52,123
You shouldn't break the flower

563
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:54,352
Just play with it. okay?

564
00:41:03,405 --> 00:41:04,736
Hey, Ramadhir!

565
00:41:05,106 --> 00:41:07,097
Catch him!

566
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:09,004
With privatization, government
took the mines back from Ramadhir..

567
00:41:09,244 --> 00:41:11,735
..and handed over to Coal lndia..

568
00:41:12,247 --> 00:41:13,714
..which was under S.P. Sinha.

569
00:41:14,282 --> 00:41:16,409
Ramadher Singh has become contractor from Owner.

570
00:41:16,952 --> 00:41:19,113
And after killing S.P. Sinha
Ramadheer's terror has increased..

571
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:22,550
..which made him a first don of Dhanbad.

572
00:41:22,824 --> 00:41:24,621
Your father was a big man.

573
00:41:33,335 --> 00:41:34,461
Move.

574
00:41:35,937 --> 00:41:37,131
Where is Sardar Khan?

575
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,101
Sardar khan came here

576
00:41:48,683 --> 00:41:49,707
Sardar Khan!

577
00:41:52,187 --> 00:41:53,245
ln the opposite room.

578
00:41:57,158 --> 00:41:58,216
Who's it?

579
00:41:58,593 --> 00:42:00,356
What do you mean?

580
00:42:00,795 --> 00:42:04,196
She says that she is Nagma.

581
00:42:04,432 --> 00:42:06,366
She said she is Nagma?

582
00:42:06,668 --> 00:42:08,363
And you too think she is Nagma.

583
00:42:08,603 --> 00:42:10,264
What do you think of me?

584
00:42:10,505 --> 00:42:12,837
l didn't found out

585
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:15,870
Didn't you think of anything before doing this?

586
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:17,635
Were you walking in sleep?

587
00:42:17,846 --> 00:42:18,972
Seriously. l couldn't realize.

588
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,477
She took advantage of me.

589
00:42:20,682 --> 00:42:22,081
No..

590
00:42:22,284 --> 00:42:24,718
What are you doing? She will die

591
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,818
Let her die

592
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:27,249
There'll be a murder. - Move.

593
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,945
Leave it. She'll get hurt.

594
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,953
l said move, or else l'll kill you.

595
00:42:31,192 --> 00:42:33,092
Listen to me.

596
00:42:33,328 --> 00:42:34,454
l won't spare you alive

597
00:42:34,696 --> 00:42:36,391
Leave it.

598
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:41,099
Nagma!

599
00:42:42,304 --> 00:42:43,635
Stop!

600
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:45,372
Where are you running?

601
00:42:49,878 --> 00:42:52,369
Some day you will come home.

602
00:42:52,747 --> 00:42:54,715
Rogue!

603
00:43:09,331 --> 00:43:10,457
No..

604
00:43:23,445 --> 00:43:24,810
Calm down!

605
00:43:27,048 --> 00:43:29,608
Have patience.

606
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:33,985
Push!

607
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:38,925
Get lost!

608
00:43:47,302 --> 00:43:48,894
My son!

609
00:43:49,471 --> 00:43:50,768
My child!

610
00:43:51,573 --> 00:43:53,131
Smile!

611
00:43:53,408 --> 00:43:54,773
Smile for me!

612
00:43:55,276 --> 00:43:56,538
Smile for me!

613
00:43:57,178 --> 00:43:58,543
Smile for me!

614
00:44:06,221 --> 00:44:07,586
Take him!

615
00:44:11,326 --> 00:44:12,520
My child!

616
00:44:12,994 --> 00:44:14,484
My prince!

617
00:44:15,263 --> 00:44:16,195
My child!

618
00:44:16,398 --> 00:44:17,592
Please forgive me

619
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:21,836
What is it?
- l don't know.

620
00:44:22,203 --> 00:44:23,795
What is it?

621
00:44:24,439 --> 00:44:25,428
Just there's something.

622
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:27,140
Nothing could happen right now

623
00:44:28,143 --> 00:44:28,905
Why?

624
00:44:29,244 --> 00:44:30,871
Somebody is inside my womb.

625
00:44:31,279 --> 00:44:32,678
So, l am not taking him out.

626
00:44:34,149 --> 00:44:35,446
Don't you feel shame?

627
00:44:36,284 --> 00:44:38,218
You will make your kid dirty?

628
00:44:38,586 --> 00:44:39,883
This is not right...

629
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:42,485
When somebody is already inside

630
00:44:42,824 --> 00:44:44,792
So you should control your self

631
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,493
You're right.

632
00:44:47,162 --> 00:44:48,459
l'm tired of telling him.

633
00:44:48,863 --> 00:44:50,387
He is born evil.

634
00:44:50,932 --> 00:44:53,264
There has to be a
lone horse amongst mare.

635
00:44:53,702 --> 00:44:55,329
When Darish was to be born..

636
00:44:56,037 --> 00:44:57,664
..nine months passed away.

637
00:44:59,207 --> 00:45:01,732
Even after his birth, one month passed just like that.

638
00:45:02,343 --> 00:45:03,571
And now she's carrying again.

639
00:45:03,845 --> 00:45:04,971
C'mon, the food is ready.

640
00:45:06,281 --> 00:45:07,339
Coming.

641
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:10,740
What do we do?

642
00:45:11,586 --> 00:45:12,883
Should we live life or not?

643
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:14,781
We too have lived that way.

644
00:45:17,325 --> 00:45:18,883
Wonder how you lived.

645
00:45:19,694 --> 00:45:20,888
You want to quench your thirst..

646
00:45:21,196 --> 00:45:22,220
..you can go anywhere you want.

647
00:45:22,997 --> 00:45:25,397
Don't bring anyone home.
Otherwise, l'll kill her.

648
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:27,598
And wherever you go, take a bath before you leave.

649
00:45:28,002 --> 00:45:29,367
Who's going out?

650
00:45:29,704 --> 00:45:30,693
Eat your food.

651
00:45:30,972 --> 00:45:32,098
You'll get power.

652
00:45:32,474 --> 00:45:34,032
Don't bring me shame outside.

653
00:45:34,509 --> 00:45:36,136
Vote for! - Brother Shetty!

654
00:45:36,344 --> 00:45:37,811

Vote for! - Brother Shetty!

664
00:45:53,461 --> 00:45:55,326
Get the jeep tank full.

665
00:45:55,997 --> 00:45:58,591
And fix monthly charges if you want.

666
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,531
You can fill the tank from my pump.

667
00:46:01,169 --> 00:46:02,761
lf you don't need the jeep..

668
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,529
..can l use it on rent?

669
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:08,509
Fill the tank.

670
00:46:10,078 --> 00:46:11,136
Also fill this one. Okay?

671
00:46:11,379 --> 00:46:14,405
Asgar took contract of driving jeep.

672
00:46:14,716 --> 00:46:16,775
He used to get the tanks full..

673
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:18,043
..and sell it to the truck
drivers on cheap rates. .

674
00:46:18,419 --> 00:46:20,319
And Sardar used to drive for him.

675
00:46:26,694 --> 00:46:28,992
Uncle..

676
00:46:29,964 --> 00:46:32,398
Did you read this?
l couldn't even believe.

677
00:46:33,134 --> 00:46:35,500
All these five petrol pumps are in
the names of Radmadhir Singh's wife..

678
00:46:35,737 --> 00:46:37,534
..and his daughters and sons-in-law.

679
00:46:39,207 --> 00:46:41,334
Eat it first and then talk.

680
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,444
Asgar!

681
00:46:51,085 --> 00:46:52,450
Shall we go and fill the tank?

682
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:04,688
Listen! Fill the tank.

683
00:47:13,474 --> 00:47:15,965
Where shall l fill it?.
There's no tank mouth.

684
00:47:16,644 --> 00:47:17,872
You need to turn thejeep this side.

685
00:47:18,112 --> 00:47:19,374
How many trucks would usually come here?

686
00:47:20,081 --> 00:47:21,708
Around 100 or 200?

687
00:47:22,116 --> 00:47:23,879
500!

688
00:47:24,118 --> 00:47:25,107

Yes.

691
00:47:29,524 --> 00:47:32,960
Hey! 500 trucks fill
the tanks from here.

692
00:47:34,295 --> 00:47:35,319
My God.

693
00:47:36,764 --> 00:47:37,696
What are you doing, sir?

694
00:47:37,932 --> 00:47:38,830
Get lost!

695
00:47:39,868 --> 00:47:40,664
Where's the key?

696
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:43,030
This is Ramadhir singh's pump.

697
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:44,830
What did you say?

698
00:47:45,206 --> 00:47:46,867
Ramadhir singh's pump.

699
00:47:47,175 --> 00:47:49,166
lt's politician's petrol pump.

700
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:55,941
Hey, you're lucky.
Petrol is filled for free.

701
00:47:56,184 --> 00:47:57,845

703
00:48:04,726 --> 00:48:06,717
Hello!

704
00:48:07,161 --> 00:48:09,152
Did you kill him?

705
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,124
Don't know.

706
00:48:10,365 --> 00:48:11,263
Let's go.

707
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:15,262
Start the jeep.

708
00:48:16,337 --> 00:48:18,532
l dropped the dagger.

709
00:48:18,773 --> 00:48:19,797
C'mon, let me go first.

710
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:21,668
Yes, get in.

711
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:22,744
C'mon, start.

712
00:48:53,474 --> 00:48:55,942
The last compartment of the goods train is in my name.

713
00:48:56,511 --> 00:48:58,035
My men will load it with iron.

714
00:48:58,513 --> 00:48:59,946
We'll unload it here.

715
00:49:00,181 --> 00:49:01,876
You look after the documents.

716
00:49:02,116 --> 00:49:03,708
Sure!

717
00:49:04,052 --> 00:49:06,680
Slowly!

718
00:49:06,921 --> 00:49:08,445
Careful!

719
00:49:09,123 --> 00:49:11,057
Come, let's sit here.

720
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:13,954
Hello, Guard.
- Hello!

721
00:49:14,228 --> 00:49:15,252
He's a guard..

722
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:16,622
..of that goods train.

723
00:49:16,898 --> 00:49:18,593
Carefully!

724
00:49:37,752 --> 00:49:38,810
Don't move.

725
00:49:39,087 --> 00:49:41,453
Or else l'll kill you.

726
00:49:41,956 --> 00:49:43,947
Switch on the light and l'll kill him.

727
00:49:45,259 --> 00:49:46,624
Don't kill him.

728
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:52,023
C'mon..

729
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:53,459
..it's our train.

730
00:49:54,235 --> 00:49:55,668
Start unloading it.

731
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,064
Quick!

732
00:49:57,372 --> 00:49:58,669
C'mon, hurry up.

733
00:50:12,353 --> 00:50:13,911
Want some water.
- Take it.

734
00:50:14,155 --> 00:50:15,179
Open it.

735
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:35,368
Can you see there?

736
00:50:35,977 --> 00:50:38,673
From there to the entire mine..

737
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,547
..belongs to Ramadhir Singh.

738
00:50:43,451 --> 00:50:44,782
lt's enough for you to understand.

739
00:50:46,087 --> 00:50:47,019
That's it.

740
00:51:22,523 --> 00:51:23,547
Where have you brought me?

741
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:24,890
Someone is..

742
00:51:25,326 --> 00:51:27,419
..illegally capturing the land.

743
00:51:28,496 --> 00:51:29,428
Who?

744
00:51:30,598 --> 00:51:31,656
Who's he?

745
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:33,224
Sardar Khan!

746
00:51:34,202 --> 00:51:35,134
Who's he?

747
00:51:36,804 --> 00:51:39,705
The one who drives Asgar's jeep at the station.

748
00:51:40,241 --> 00:51:42,607
He drops our passengers.

749
00:51:43,144 --> 00:51:44,907
From when did he get that power?

750
00:51:45,546 --> 00:51:46,513
Call him to my office.

751
00:51:47,081 --> 00:51:48,446
He won't come.

752
00:51:48,783 --> 00:51:49,807
Why?

753
00:51:51,252 --> 00:51:52,310
l told him.

754
00:51:52,653 --> 00:51:54,382
But he said you must come to him
if you want to make a deal.

755
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:56,386
And what will he do if we ploy men here?

756
00:51:57,658 --> 00:51:58,750
Till now, he was our driver.

757
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,052
And now he'll deal with us?

758
00:52:00,261 --> 00:52:02,729
Vini! - l'll kill him. - Vini.

759
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,325
Small man wants to do something.
Let him do it.

760
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:10,536
lf he wants to enjoy, let him enjoy.

761
00:52:11,873 --> 00:52:13,932
Will it suit you arguing with him?

762
00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:15,798
So, what do we do?

763
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:19,036
lf illegal means do not work, use legal means.

764
00:52:20,281 --> 00:52:22,408
Dhanbad falls in your
high command, right?

765
00:52:23,184 --> 00:52:25,584
lnvite SP for lunch.

766
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:31,018
l'll teach him a good lesson.

767
00:52:54,348 --> 00:52:55,645
Okay..

768
00:53:07,028 --> 00:53:08,359
Do it carefully.

769
00:53:09,363 --> 00:53:10,330
We need blessings.

770
00:53:10,565 --> 00:53:12,260
Give it to me. - Salutations!

771
00:53:34,522 --> 00:53:35,352
Ucle!

772
00:53:57,478 --> 00:53:59,139
Ramadhir Singh didn't recognize Sardar

773
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,669
Perhaps not me,

774
00:54:01,082 --> 00:54:03,016
Besides he saw me with Shahid.

775
00:54:03,684 --> 00:54:05,117
But if he wished, he'd recognize me.

776
00:54:05,753 --> 00:54:06,742
lt was a time...

777
00:54:07,021 --> 00:54:08,511
..when big people forget their names

778
00:54:08,889 --> 00:54:10,720
..but they never forget their land...

779
00:54:11,926 --> 00:54:13,917
Where it's written that this land is yours?

780
00:54:14,762 --> 00:54:16,195
lf it's your land then show me the papers.

781
00:54:17,031 --> 00:54:18,362
Land is mine.

782
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,326
l have already made a deal

783
00:54:21,836 --> 00:54:23,633
And what you are trying to occupy..

784
00:54:24,438 --> 00:54:25,530
..it won't be good for you.

785
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,173
Think and speak!

786
00:54:27,742 --> 00:54:29,471
Don't tell me the differences

787
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,377
Here's the land papers

788
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,577
l have bought it for Rs. 10

789
00:54:33,848 --> 00:54:34,906
Rs.10?

790
00:54:35,516 --> 00:54:38,508
Do you know what's your value?

791
00:54:38,753 --> 00:54:39,845
l'll bury you right here.

792
00:54:41,188 --> 00:54:42,519
Shut up! - Vini!

793
00:54:44,925 --> 00:54:47,223
lf you will keep sitting on your chair then..

794
00:54:47,495 --> 00:54:48,325
..it will be good for everyone.

795
00:54:49,697 --> 00:54:51,096
Move.. move out.

796
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:52,623
Move!

797
00:54:54,802 --> 00:54:55,791
Sir!

798
00:54:57,204 --> 00:54:58,865
No matter what position you reach..

799
00:54:59,073 --> 00:55:00,631
..you can never be God.

800
00:55:01,942 --> 00:55:03,204
You don't know who am l?

801
00:55:03,611 --> 00:55:05,010
How dare you raise hand at me?

802
00:55:09,517 --> 00:55:10,950
You don't know who am l?

803
00:55:11,919 --> 00:55:14,683
When you go back home and itching your father's head..

804
00:55:15,189 --> 00:55:16,554
..ask him who am l?

805
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:21,618
How many days l will be imprisoned to slap a minister..

806
00:55:21,896 --> 00:55:23,193
..in police station?

807
00:55:23,564 --> 00:55:25,998
And l too would like to get jailed, sir.

808
00:55:26,233 --> 00:55:28,667
How dare you?!

809
00:55:33,274 --> 00:55:34,206
Father!

810
00:55:36,043 --> 00:55:37,271
Why don't you?

811
00:55:40,715 --> 00:55:41,647
Start the car!

812
00:55:43,751 --> 00:55:44,683
Did you understand?

813
00:55:44,919 --> 00:55:49,481
Did you understand it now?.

814
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:51,917
You will appoint anyone without any information

815
00:55:52,193 --> 00:55:54,024
l'll kill you.

816
00:55:54,261 --> 00:55:55,785
l didn't know...

817
00:55:56,163 --> 00:55:58,563
Look! Everyone look your minister has been beaten up

818
00:55:59,266 --> 00:56:00,164
He was patting a snake.

819
00:56:00,468 --> 00:56:02,368
What are you doing?
Why are you beating him?

820
00:56:02,603 --> 00:56:04,400
lf you will interfere then l will slit your throat.

821
00:56:04,638 --> 00:56:05,935
You've given him birth.

822
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:09,372
Want to be a minister.

823
00:56:11,045 --> 00:56:11,807

00:56:22,656 --> 00:56:24,624

828
00:56:27,495 --> 00:56:28,792

00:56:31,532 --> 00:56:32,897
He's SP in the office.

00:56:33,167 --> 00:56:34,691
ln front of his father.

832
00:56:35,669 --> 00:56:39,264
Hello! - How are you?

Come! Sit here.

836
00:56:51,485 --> 00:56:54,045
Last night l saw a nightmare.

837
00:56:57,625 --> 00:56:58,922
Do you remember Shahid Khan?

838
00:57:01,762 --> 00:57:03,753
He used to work for me.

839
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:08,566
He came to your dreams.

840
00:57:09,236 --> 00:57:10,863
Did he come in your dream?

841
00:57:12,006 --> 00:57:13,371

Four marriages are allowed in our religion.

How can l refuse God?

935
01:07:50,877 --> 01:07:54,244
There must be some reasons

01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:58,072
Where's Sardar Khan?

955
01:08:58,311 --> 01:09:00,302
Why? Was he amongst the 21 absconding?

01:15:21,194 --> 01:15:22,855
Will you taste Durga alone?

1013
01:15:24,531 --> 01:15:25,520
l want to meet Sultan

1014
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:28,824
lt's dog's meat, take it away.

1015
01:15:32,038 --> 01:15:34,006
Sultan is the son of Sultana dacoit's daughter's son

1016
01:15:34,474 --> 01:15:36,669
whom Ehsan Qureshi has grown up at his home

1017
01:15:37,243 --> 01:15:39,871
He chopped the buffalo when he was 12

1018
01:15:40,446 --> 01:15:42,676
And still today he chopped 60 buffalos

1019
01:15:43,016 --> 01:15:44,415
that's why others are scared from him

1020
01:15:45,118 --> 01:15:46,608
What we do about these Qureshis?

1021
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,378
We tried to explain them

1022
01:15:48,821 --> 01:15:50,686
We requested them.
And did everything we could.

1023
01:15:51,124 --> 01:15:52,489
But they don't care

1024
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,722
Your name is still a terror there.

1025
01:15:55,528 --> 01:15:57,393
Everyone knew about your dad's legendary

1026
01:15:58,531 --> 01:15:59,862
Now you just come back

1027
01:16:00,466 --> 01:16:02,434
That house was empty in neighbourhood

1028
01:16:02,735 --> 01:16:03,861
We all have bought it

1029
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:05,703
Now Sultan has occupied that house.

1030
01:16:07,173 --> 01:16:08,470
His goons gamble all day long there

1031
01:16:08,675 --> 01:16:09,642
They drink beer

1032
01:16:09,876 --> 01:16:11,138
They kidnapped a woman in night

1033
01:16:11,377 --> 01:16:12,344
What we do now?.

1034
01:16:15,148 --> 01:16:16,376
Let's go!

1035
01:16:20,286 --> 01:16:21,947
Run!

1036
01:16:22,755 --> 01:16:24,689
Go to hell!

1037
01:16:27,794 --> 01:16:29,591
Let's go! Run!

1038
01:16:35,935 --> 01:16:37,596
How do l go to the college?

1039
01:16:37,937 --> 01:16:39,598
He stood there everyday

1040
01:16:40,139 --> 01:16:42,630
lf l change the lane
so he came from anywhere

1041
01:16:43,176 --> 01:16:46,612
He looks at me like no man has seen a woman

1042
01:16:47,447 --> 01:16:48,880
lt seems that he will eat me

1043
01:16:50,049 --> 01:16:52,210
He is a Pehelwan of Dhanbad.

1044
01:16:52,485 --> 01:16:55,010
lf you will kill him in Wasseypur then there is no problem

1045
01:16:56,289 --> 01:16:57,881
He must J. P Singh's man

1046
01:16:58,291 --> 01:16:59,724
Now if we will do something...

1047
01:16:59,959 --> 01:17:01,256
...police will be after us.

1048
01:17:10,837 --> 01:17:12,134
How are you?

1049
01:17:12,405 --> 01:17:13,667
Get lost, you rogue!

1050
01:17:33,926 --> 01:17:35,791
Shameless!

1051
01:17:36,963 --> 01:17:38,123
You!

1052
01:17:43,069 --> 01:17:44,627
Catch him!

1053
01:17:49,942 --> 01:17:51,204
Stop!

1054
01:17:52,111 --> 01:17:53,135
Get lost!

1055
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,869
Run!

1056
01:17:56,349 --> 01:17:57,748
Don't spare him.

1057
01:17:59,085 --> 01:18:01,178
Get in!

1058
01:18:03,589 --> 01:18:05,614
Hey! Bang!

1059
01:18:11,731 --> 01:18:12,663
ls he dead?

1060
01:18:12,932 --> 01:18:14,832
Not dead? check him!

1061
01:18:15,134 --> 01:18:16,533
You rogue!

1062
01:18:19,605 --> 01:18:22,130
Sardar lived in Wasseypur for 1 year after the jailbreak

1063
01:18:22,642 --> 01:18:24,007
He killed Pehelwan there.

1064
01:18:24,343 --> 01:18:25,401
J.P. Singh's Pehelwan.

1065
01:18:25,812 --> 01:18:27,541
whom nobody has touched yet.

1066
01:18:28,347 --> 01:18:29,939
Wasseypur was muslim's area

1067
01:18:30,416 --> 01:18:31,508
And that man was Hindu.

1068
01:18:31,984 --> 01:18:34,714
He chopped his body and threw it to every Slaughter house

1069
01:18:35,822 --> 01:18:38,120
Qureshi's had contract of the slaughter houses..

1070
01:18:38,357 --> 01:18:40,723
..and Qamar Makhdoom was not favourite of Qureshis...

1071
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:43,290
That girl was not belonged to Qureshi's.

1072
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:45,857
Besides that Qureshi did't said anything.

1073
01:18:46,632 --> 01:18:49,066
And their Sardar Sultan remains quite

1074
01:18:50,603 --> 01:18:51,729
Emergency was over

1075
01:18:52,071 --> 01:18:53,333
lt was 80's...

1076
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:55,503
and Wasseypur has become Dhanbad

1077
01:18:55,908 --> 01:18:57,466
where Sardar was living two lives

1078
01:18:57,643 --> 01:19:00,203
One house in Wasseypur where Qureshis were his enemies

1079
01:19:00,446 --> 01:19:03,176
Second house is in Dhanbad where
Ramadhir Singh was his enemy

1080
01:19:03,516 --> 01:19:05,211
There was only one advantage to live in Wasseypur..

1081
01:19:05,418 --> 01:19:07,147
..that police never came to this area.

1082
01:19:10,323 --> 01:19:12,086
Stand up.

1083
01:19:15,261 --> 01:19:16,888
Are you newly transferred?

1084
01:19:17,764 --> 01:19:18,890
Why did you came here?

1085
01:19:19,499 --> 01:19:21,126
This is Wasseypur. Understood?

1086
01:19:21,367 --> 01:19:22,766
ls there any drama going on?

1087
01:19:23,569 --> 01:19:27,938
Sardar Khan killed Pehelwan in Dhanbad's market.

1088
01:19:28,207 --> 01:19:29,799
l thought he is here.

1089
01:19:30,543 --> 01:19:32,977
When Sardar will come in markets

1090
01:19:33,312 --> 01:19:35,644
then you shall catch him. Right?

1091
01:19:36,082 --> 01:19:37,344
This is Wasseypur.

1092
01:19:37,717 --> 01:19:40,151
Here pigeon fly with one wing.

1093
01:19:40,486 --> 01:19:42,454
..and save his respect from another wing.

1094
01:19:43,089 --> 01:19:44,784
Understood?

1095
01:19:47,894 --> 01:19:49,156
Now, go. Leave that finger here.

1096
01:19:49,629 --> 01:19:51,153
l have proof!

1097
01:19:53,366 --> 01:19:54,298
Here it is.

1098
01:19:55,434 --> 01:19:56,128
Let's go. Bye!

1099
01:19:56,769 --> 01:19:58,600
So, how is it?

1100
01:20:00,406 --> 01:20:01,395
How are you?

1101
01:20:02,008 --> 01:20:04,533
l wanted to dig a pit. - Why?

1102
01:20:05,144 --> 01:20:06,634
l have brought cycle material

1103
01:20:06,846 --> 01:20:10,407
Cycle's pipe is weak and it will not explode properly.

1104
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:13,245
Will it? - Yes.

1105
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:15,754
So what should l bring?
- Truck's steering pipe.

1106
01:20:15,988 --> 01:20:17,319
How much pipe l will have to bring

1107
01:20:22,895 --> 01:20:23,862
What is the range?

1108
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:25,222
ltll be enough.

1109
01:20:25,531 --> 01:20:28,625
How much?
- lf it's local, it'll fit the target.

1110
01:20:29,335 --> 01:20:31,929
From how much distance l can shoot and man will get killed?

1111
01:20:32,138 --> 01:20:34,333
20 feet will do. - Sure?

1112
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:35,529
Qureshi!

1113
01:20:38,811 --> 01:20:39,800
Catch him!

1114
01:20:40,613 --> 01:20:41,773
Catch him!

1115
01:20:49,555 --> 01:20:51,580
How dare you?!

1116
01:20:51,824 --> 01:20:54,224
Catch him!

1117
01:20:54,427 --> 01:20:55,985
Move! - Hey, stop! Stop l say.

1118
01:20:59,165 --> 01:21:00,132
Run behind!

1119
01:21:00,867 --> 01:21:02,129
What did you made?

1120
01:21:02,568 --> 01:21:03,796
lt shakes my hand.

1121
01:21:04,003 --> 01:21:05,732
l shot at somewhere else and it hits somewhere else.

1122
01:21:05,938 --> 01:21:07,132
Do you think l am a fool?

1123
01:21:28,928 --> 01:21:29,952
How are you?

1124
01:21:32,131 --> 01:21:34,759
You son of a fool!

1125
01:21:35,334 --> 01:21:36,631
Stop!

1126
01:21:37,436 --> 01:21:39,700
Catch hold of him! Rogue!

1127
01:21:39,939 --> 01:21:42,032
Catch him!

1128
01:21:42,475 --> 01:21:43,542
Catch him!

1129
01:21:43,542 --> 01:21:44,099
Catch him!

1130
01:21:54,553 --> 01:21:56,714
Yes, that's right.

1131
01:22:49,875 --> 01:22:52,343
Run! Run for your life!

1132
01:22:58,384 --> 01:22:59,851
Throw!

1133
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:02,651
Throw!

1134
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:06,959
c'mon!

1135
01:23:24,777 --> 01:23:25,744
Who was that?

1136
01:23:26,145 --> 01:23:27,737
What was that? Sardar Khan!

1137
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:30,108
Everyone was gone to mourne

1138
01:23:30,383 --> 01:23:31,577
l was sleeping upstairs

1139
01:23:31,851 --> 01:23:33,113
l am not feeling well today

1140
01:23:33,285 --> 01:23:36,721
l heard a blast outside.

1141
01:23:36,956 --> 01:23:38,048
When l came out..

1142
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:42,659
..l have seen everywhere..

1143
01:23:46,098 --> 01:23:47,395
What?

1144
01:23:48,234 --> 01:23:49,667
We should kill him

1145
01:23:52,104 --> 01:23:58,304
And Sardar has become so famous in Wasseypur.

1146
01:23:58,511 --> 01:23:59,705
..that he has forgotten..

1147
01:23:59,912 --> 01:24:03,973
..that his wife Nagma and sons are still alive...

1148
01:24:12,224 --> 01:24:13,521
Shall l turn off the light?

1149
01:24:14,727 --> 01:24:15,694
Let it be...

1150
01:24:16,395 --> 01:24:17,487
l will turn it off

1151
01:24:36,582 --> 01:24:38,243
Did something happen?

1152
01:24:41,854 --> 01:24:43,287
lt happened to me, too.

1153
01:24:49,095 --> 01:24:52,360
l think you've lost your powers now.

1154
01:24:53,666 --> 01:24:55,258
Not at all.

1155
01:24:58,170 --> 01:24:59,831
Lion always wait.

1156
01:25:01,073 --> 01:25:06,204
They watch and attack

1157
01:25:08,147 --> 01:25:09,614
What happen?

1158
01:25:09,849 --> 01:25:11,214
Doctor has stopped me.

1159
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:15,546
Doctor doesn't know anything

1160
01:25:18,757 --> 01:25:20,418
lt doesn't make a difference to you.

1161
01:25:22,962 --> 01:25:24,395
So what should l do?

1162
01:25:25,297 --> 01:25:26,730
As you always do.

1163
01:25:29,301 --> 01:25:30,325
Get lost!

1164
01:25:43,349 --> 01:25:44,441
Good excuse!

1165
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:47,016
Get pregnant and avoid your husband.

1166
01:25:47,253 --> 01:25:48,880
Like l wanted to do it

1167
01:25:49,221 --> 01:25:51,314
As if God left your child in my womb.

1168
01:25:51,524 --> 01:25:53,191
My mom didn't had 4 kids.
-You are taking revenge of that.

1169
01:25:53,192 --> 01:25:54,284
l am not taking revenge

1170
01:25:54,527 --> 01:25:57,189
You really enjoy to born the kid

1171
01:25:57,429 --> 01:25:59,062
When you stay at home?
You have no time from your vandalism.

1172
01:25:59,098 --> 01:26:03,228
At least l keep busy with the kids.

1173
01:26:03,402 --> 01:26:05,495
lf l will bring another wife?
- What do you mean?

1174
01:26:05,704 --> 01:26:08,298
Like l don't know about your affairs.

1175
01:26:11,377 --> 01:26:13,174
Did you make her pregnant?

1176
01:26:17,416 --> 01:26:19,077
Why are you staring at me?

1177
01:26:33,232 --> 01:26:34,893

Enough!

1196
01:27:35,127 --> 01:27:36,253
Will you kill me?

1197
01:27:37,696 --> 01:27:38,720
What happened?

1198
01:27:42,768 --> 01:27:43,996
Leave me!

1199
01:27:44,203 --> 01:27:45,135

1201
01:27:57,049 --> 01:28:00,246
What happened?
- What you have done with me?

1202
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,015
You wanted to treat me for my illness.

1203
01:28:03,389 --> 01:28:05,653
You have tied me here like an animal.

1204
01:28:05,858 --> 01:28:08,122
Why are you cursing me?

1205
01:28:15,801 --> 01:28:21,103
l don't want to be a child making machine like your wife?

1206
01:28:21,373 --> 01:28:22,840
So who is making you?

1207
01:28:23,809 --> 01:28:25,640
So what is this?

1208
01:28:26,779 --> 01:28:28,644
This is love.

1209
01:28:31,984 --> 01:28:33,645
This is love my.

1210
01:28:39,191 --> 01:28:40,954
Faizal!

1211
01:28:45,631 --> 01:28:47,155
Salutation!

1212
01:28:47,566 --> 01:28:48,965
Where is your mom?

1213
01:28:50,035 --> 01:28:52,196
She is unconscious!
- ls it boy or girl?

1214
01:28:52,771 --> 01:28:53,931
Boy!

1215
01:28:54,306 --> 01:28:55,295
So smile!

1216
01:28:56,175 --> 01:28:58,837
What's wrong? Do you need money?

1217
01:29:00,979 --> 01:29:01,968
Distribute.

1218
01:29:03,849 --> 01:29:04,816
You don't want to meet mom?

1219
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:08,050
Now she is unconscious so what's the use?

1220
01:29:08,587 --> 01:29:10,214
Tell her that l came in new shirt.

1221
01:29:14,059 --> 01:29:15,458
l don't want to wear this.

1222
01:29:15,794 --> 01:29:16,726
Shut up! - l don't want to wear it.

1223
01:29:16,962 --> 01:29:18,623
Why?

1224
01:29:18,897 --> 01:29:20,228
l feel ashamed.

1225
01:30:08,414 --> 01:30:09,740
What will you do by going to the school?

1226
01:30:09,982 --> 01:30:11,950
Your dad has stopped sending money

1227
01:30:13,318 --> 01:30:15,878
Find a job and earn some money.

1228
01:30:23,829 --> 01:30:24,796
Faizal!

1229
01:30:26,932 --> 01:30:28,991
Tell me where are you going?

1230
01:30:34,373 --> 01:30:36,967
Who you are going to kill?

1231
01:30:51,557 --> 01:30:52,524
Whose house is this?

1232
01:30:53,892 --> 01:30:55,325
Shall l help?

1233
01:31:00,566 --> 01:31:01,726
What?

1234
01:31:18,717 --> 01:31:19,809
How much you got?

1235
01:31:20,452 --> 01:31:21,885
20 rupees
- That's it

1236
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,054
You will give 10 rupees to me?

1237
01:31:24,323 --> 01:31:26,450
l will give whole money to mom.

1238
01:31:26,725 --> 01:31:27,817
Danesh!

1239
01:31:30,963 --> 01:31:32,396
Did you recognize me?

1240
01:31:33,098 --> 01:31:35,328
What? - Ramadhir, l'm a minister.

1241
01:31:35,801 --> 01:31:37,325
Come l will drop you home

1242
01:31:39,671 --> 01:31:41,502
Since when your dad didn't come home

1243
01:31:43,976 --> 01:31:44,943
A year!

1244
01:31:46,378 --> 01:31:47,504
Or more than a year

1245
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:50,439
He earns millions

1246
01:31:50,782 --> 01:31:53,046
and he spend his money to that woman and his sons

1247
01:31:54,286 --> 01:31:58,120
You both are cleaning train toilets instead of going school

1248
01:31:59,057 --> 01:32:01,491
Don't you feel angry?

1249
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:12,897
lt's 1000 rupees. Keep it

1250
01:32:14,039 --> 01:32:15,097
Keep it

1251
01:32:16,308 --> 01:32:17,570
Tell your mom

1252
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:20,904
Ramadhir is with her

1253
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:26,815
Mom!

1254
01:32:28,787 --> 01:32:31,415
Who gave you?
- Ramadhir Singh gave me

1255
01:32:31,790 --> 01:32:33,724
He said if you need more money then come and get it

1256
01:32:34,059 --> 01:32:35,117
He gave you and you keep it

1257
01:32:35,494 --> 01:32:37,519
Are you a beggar? ls your dad died?

1258
01:32:37,963 --> 01:32:40,158
Why dad doesn't come home?
Why he doesn't send money

1259
01:32:40,699 --> 01:32:43,725
Now you want to kill him

1260
01:32:43,936 --> 01:32:46,404
Will you kill him?
Will you make me a widow?.

1261
01:32:47,105 --> 01:32:48,436
Wait, l'll show you.

1262
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:51,108
Why did you get the money?
So what if your dad doesn't come home

1263
01:32:51,443 --> 01:32:54,776
We get ration on time.
You are roaming with his respect.

1264
01:32:55,714 --> 01:32:58,808
Rogue! - What are you doing?

1265
01:32:59,017 --> 01:33:00,507
You take money from Ramadhir Singh?

1266
01:33:01,253 --> 01:33:03,380
Move.. move l said.

1267
01:33:03,622 --> 01:33:05,852
l said stop.
- Move away.

1268
01:33:06,058 --> 01:33:07,787
l said move away.

1269
01:33:07,993 --> 01:33:09,426
Move away.

1270
01:33:09,661 --> 01:33:11,925
Move away.

1271
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,100
Don't rub it!

1272
01:33:17,703 --> 01:33:19,193
l am not injured

1273
01:33:20,672 --> 01:33:22,367
Don't rub it!

1274
01:33:35,487 --> 01:33:37,045
Calm down!

1275
01:33:47,933 --> 01:33:49,366
Calm down!

1276
01:34:36,314 --> 01:34:40,216
Faizal!

1277
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:43,081
Faizal! Faizal!

1278
01:34:43,555 --> 01:34:44,715
Faizal!

1279
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:46,552
Faizal! Stop my child.

1280
01:34:46,858 --> 01:34:47,722
Faizal!

1281
01:34:56,301 --> 01:34:57,632
Faizal didn't return home that night.

1282
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:01,530
That thing settled in his mind to such an extent..

1283
01:35:02,107 --> 01:35:05,270
..that his growth stopped.
Physical as well as mental.

1284
01:35:06,411 --> 01:35:08,777
He started withering.

1285
01:35:09,147 --> 01:35:10,205
He was younger to Danesh..

1286
01:35:10,549 --> 01:35:11,538
..but looked elder.

1287
01:35:12,150 --> 01:35:14,141
Doctors and physicians lost hopes.

1288
01:35:14,586 --> 01:35:15,746
He also started taking drugs.

1289
01:35:16,321 --> 01:35:19,017
And he never talked about that night with anyone.

1290
01:35:19,591 --> 01:35:22,151
Neither he said anything, nor Nagma, nor did l.

1291
01:35:22,961 --> 01:35:26,556
Neither he met his eyes with mine nor..

1292
01:35:26,798 --> 01:35:28,425
..did l..

1293
01:35:28,734 --> 01:35:31,225
But he didn't know, what couldn't
happen between Nagma and myself..

1294
01:35:31,737 --> 01:35:33,170
..that day, never happened in life.

1295
01:35:52,858 --> 01:35:53,756
Hide the bottles.

1296
01:35:53,959 --> 01:35:55,017
Why?

1297
01:35:55,193 --> 01:35:57,423
A heroine is passing away.

1298
01:35:58,196 --> 01:36:01,063
Brother! Take at the crossroad.

1299
01:36:02,801 --> 01:36:05,361
Excuse me, will you come to Girdi?.

1300
01:36:05,604 --> 01:36:08,300
No. l don't want to go.
- Few men were following her in jeep.

1301
01:36:09,007 --> 01:36:10,474
The jeep was from Hirapur.

1302
01:36:10,675 --> 01:36:12,404
They abducted the girl.

1303
01:36:13,512 --> 01:36:15,070
Must be Ramadhir's men.

1304
01:36:17,149 --> 01:36:21,210
At what time did they come?

1305
01:36:21,453 --> 01:36:23,751
By swear of my parents.

1306
01:36:24,222 --> 01:36:28,090
l've sworn upon my parents..

1307
01:36:51,149 --> 01:36:52,548
..and fulfill it
at the cost of my life.

1308
01:36:53,385 --> 01:36:56,286
Salutations!

1309
01:36:56,755 --> 01:36:58,655
Fair will keep coming.

1310
01:36:59,124 --> 01:37:01,183
We're just celebrating a festival.

1311
01:37:02,227 --> 01:37:06,186
A girl was abducted from Wasseypur yesterday.

1312
01:37:08,033 --> 01:37:14,063
lf the girl wouldn't reach safe home..

1313
01:37:14,806 --> 01:37:20,802
..in next 3 hours, we'll explode the entire area with bombs.

1314
01:37:21,213 --> 01:37:26,674
And we'll make Minister Ramadhir Singh's..

1315
01:37:27,185 --> 01:37:29,619
..entire family to dance in public.

1316
01:37:30,355 --> 01:37:32,721
Listen to this!

1317
01:37:33,158 --> 01:37:34,250
Greetings! Go on playing.

1318
01:37:50,709 --> 01:37:51,869
Let's go.

1319
01:38:01,453 --> 01:38:02,511
Close the door.

1320
01:38:12,964 --> 01:38:14,693
How much will you humiliate me?

1321
01:38:15,967 --> 01:38:17,491
Find out who's that rogue?

1322
01:38:17,702 --> 01:38:19,135
Who's so passionate?

1323
01:38:20,672 --> 01:38:21,661
Yes, father.

1324
01:38:22,807 --> 01:38:23,774
Sir, l have some work.

1325
01:38:24,109 --> 01:38:25,406
lt's okay.

1326
01:38:25,677 --> 01:38:27,668
Take out the jeep.

1327
01:38:30,348 --> 01:38:32,179
Sir, please get my file passed.
- Get lost.

1328
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:33,778
Listen, excuse me.

1329
01:38:34,286 --> 01:38:35,844
Are you from this colony? - Yes.

1330
01:38:36,421 --> 01:38:39,015
ls any girl abducted from this colony?

1331
01:38:39,224 --> 01:38:40,589
Yes, she was Mr Khan's daughter.

1332
01:38:42,894 --> 01:38:45,158
A girl was abducted from Wasseypur.

1333
01:38:45,563 --> 01:38:47,690
Did you saw them at the pump?
lf they were drunk?

1334
01:38:48,066 --> 01:38:50,557
Was it Mohsin? - Mohsin?!

1335
01:39:08,153 --> 01:39:09,051
Pick her up.

1336
01:39:09,421 --> 01:39:10,479
Get up!

1337
01:39:12,824 --> 01:39:14,223
Are you mad?

1338
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,921
Did you forget the outcome of Pehlwan?

1339
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,490
They were too drunk.

1340
01:39:23,735 --> 01:39:25,396
Will they abduct any girl..

1341
01:39:25,603 --> 01:39:26,535
..walking on the road?

1342
01:39:33,445 --> 01:39:35,675

lt's not open battle.

1415
01:43:41,993 --> 01:43:43,221
Sardar is nothing.

1416
01:43:43,628 --> 01:43:45,425
You didn't know his father.

1417
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:47,488
He used to work for me.

1418
01:43:47,832 --> 01:43:50,995
Many used to shiver with his sight.

1419
01:43:51,636 --> 01:43:54,434
Sardar is not even an inch of his father.

1420
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:56,006
Definitely.

1421
01:43:58,243 --> 01:44:00,074

Kill each of them.

Find each and everyone and shoot them.

1427
01:44:13,591 --> 01:44:15,024
Take this. - Okay.

1428
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:17,084

1431
01:44:27,205 --> 01:44:28,399
Learn something from him

1432
01:44:29,641 --> 01:44:32,371
He doesn't have anything to do.
Just enjoying the position.

1433
01:44:33,211 --> 01:44:35,338
Go and help your mom. Go!

1434
01:44:36,114 --> 01:44:38,981
Time has come that steeling coal was a small business

1435
01:44:39,217 --> 01:44:43,278
Coal Labour has started their small business.

1436
01:44:43,621 --> 01:44:45,486
Big business was Contractorship.

1437
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:48,415
Rather it's a wood contract..

1438
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:51,094
..or contract of gathering explosives in the unused mines.

1439
01:44:51,729 --> 01:44:55,324
lt has written 32 trucks Rate.
- So 32 truck is parked there

1440
01:44:55,867 --> 01:44:57,664
Where it is? - Look over there.

1441
01:44:58,903 --> 01:45:01,531
That's only one,
- That's the 32nd truck...

1442
01:45:02,273 --> 01:45:03,968
l have to fill entire mine

1443
01:45:04,175 --> 01:45:05,574
Otherwise land will be collapse

1444
01:45:05,777 --> 01:45:07,267
Let it collapse.

1445
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:08,538
Only then the revolution will come.

1446
01:45:08,546 --> 01:45:09,410
He, who can rule, can get the contract.

1447
01:45:11,816 --> 01:45:14,580
Now We have started stealing sand near river bank.

1448
01:45:14,952 --> 01:45:17,750
Sardar got the contract to fill the mine with sand.

1449
01:45:17,955 --> 01:45:20,753
And Sardar had become a king of Wasseypur

1450
01:45:21,225 --> 01:45:23,989
After killing Qureshis and blown up their houses...

1451
01:45:24,228 --> 01:45:26,389
Sardar has removed them from Wasseypur

1452
01:45:26,664 --> 01:45:29,599
and he started iron business with Asghar

1453
01:45:29,767 --> 01:45:33,396
Coal chapter has become history for Dhanbad Mafia

1454
01:45:39,410 --> 01:45:41,901
Old Machines tender is coming for factories.

1455
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:43,838
Yes, l heard about it.

1456
01:45:44,349 --> 01:45:45,873
Asgar! - Yes.

1457
01:45:46,084 --> 01:45:47,346
He has grown up!

1458
01:45:48,953 --> 01:45:49,920

01:46:25,223 --> 01:46:26,952
C'mon, hurry up.

1468
01:46:54,619 --> 01:46:56,150
if someone is not in the line so don't give him the money

1469
01:46:56,387 --> 01:46:57,786

01:47:13,938 --> 01:47:16,236
Ramadhir couldn't harm me

1478
01:47:16,941 --> 01:47:18,306
But if his mom wants...

1479

Switch on the light.

1515
01:48:43,928 --> 01:48:44,792
Make him lie down.

1516
01:48:45,329 --> 01:48:47,957
He won't lay down from himself, lf he will die?

1517
01:48:48,165 --> 01:48:49,530
C'mon, lie down.

Do l need to invite you to get down?

1536
01:50:49,253 --> 01:50:51,847
Hey..

We are just making your car in pieces

1541
01:51:01,132 --> 01:51:03,362
lf something would happen to my son..

1542
01:51:04,602 --> 01:51:05,933
..then l would fire
so many bullets..

1543
01:51:06,137 --> 01:51:07,195
..that your driver...

1544
01:51:07,405 --> 01:51:09,532
..would become rich to sell bullet holes

1545
01:51:11,442 --> 01:51:12,670
Are you enjoying?

1546

Tell me.

1554
01:51:42,139 --> 01:51:43,333
What's the problem?

1555
01:51:43,674 --> 01:51:45,767
You live on one floor and
she will live on another floor.

1556
01:51:46,210 --> 01:51:48,007
lf you want you can make separate kitchen.

1557
01:51:57,988 --> 01:52:01,151
Durga!

1558
01:52:02,727 --> 01:52:03,785
Durga!

Do you want your daddy?

1560
01:52:17,742 --> 01:52:18,731
Let's do one thing

1561

1563
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:24,204
And she will have another.

1564
01:52:24,548 --> 01:52:26,607
Give me one shop.
And give her another.

1565
01:52:27,752 --> 01:52:29,276
Let's also cut down everything.

01:52:30,855 --> 01:52:31,753
Mouth too.

1567
01:52:40,998 --> 01:52:43,626
Durga, listen to me.

1568
01:52:43,901 --> 01:52:44,833
Get lost from here

1569
01:52:45,836 --> 01:52:47,531
You won't come.
- Never!

1570
01:52:50,841 --> 01:52:51,865

Where is daddy?
- ln hell..

1573
01:53:02,419 --> 01:53:03,818
Give your right to someone else..

1574
01:53:25,976 --> 01:53:27,967
Long live, Amitabh!
What a personality!

1575
01:53:28,179 --> 01:53:31,376
Get married to me.

1576
01:53:42,593 --> 01:53:45,687
Vijay! You blast dynamite..

1577
01:53:45,930 --> 01:53:47,420
..and walk off as if
you're strolling in a garden.

1578
01:53:47,832 --> 01:53:49,265
Aren't you afraid of your death?

1579
01:53:49,834 --> 01:53:54,203
One who has closely seen his mother meeting death..

1580
01:53:54,605 --> 01:53:55,799
..why would he fear death?

1581
01:54:00,744 --> 01:54:03,008
Tall hero really makes me crazy.

1582
01:54:03,247 --> 01:54:04,908
Let's watch the movie once again.

1583
01:54:05,149 --> 01:54:06,616

1593
01:54:36,347 --> 01:54:37,609
Will you eat something, Faizal?

1594
01:54:38,249 --> 01:54:39,978
Yes. - Let me watch please.

1595
01:54:42,253 --> 01:54:43,413
Come with me.

1596
01:54:43,888 --> 01:54:45,515
Why do you want to go to your father?

1597
01:54:46,423 --> 01:54:48,323
Till Vaidrayan is alive..

1598
01:54:48,559 --> 01:54:50,117
..he's everything.

1599
01:54:53,731 --> 01:54:56,564
We can't face the pistols by knives.

1600
01:54:56,767 --> 01:54:58,962
What? - Stop it.

1601
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:01,231
Go out. let me work.

1602
01:55:01,472 --> 01:55:02,962
We are also talking business.

1603
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:05,137
Do you have only this place to sit and talk?

1604
01:55:05,342 --> 01:55:06,673
Go out and talk.

1605
01:55:06,911 --> 01:55:08,378
Stop it!

1606
01:55:08,812 --> 01:55:11,144
Please, go out.

1607
01:55:11,582 --> 01:55:13,140
Close it. - Go out!

1608
01:55:15,319 --> 01:55:18,379
What are you doing? - Cleansing.

1609
01:55:25,062 --> 01:55:26,154
What were you saying?

1610
01:55:27,665 --> 01:55:29,724
Not many people know you.

1611
01:55:30,234 --> 01:55:31,963
l'll give you an address.

1612
01:55:32,369 --> 01:55:33,734
Mr Yadav will meet you there.

1613
01:55:34,605 --> 01:55:37,802
He'll give you 6 guns for Rs.200,000.

1614
01:55:38,375 --> 01:55:39,774
The real gun. But second hand.

1615
01:55:40,511 --> 01:55:43,036
Each one costs more than Rs.150000.

1616
01:55:43,948 --> 01:55:45,279
6 guns forjust Rs.200,000.

1617
01:55:45,549 --> 01:55:46,743
Why is he giving us at such cheap rate?

1618
01:55:46,917 --> 01:55:48,043
Shall l go?

1619
01:55:51,088 --> 01:55:52,919
His wounds haven't healed yet.

1620
01:55:54,091 --> 01:55:55,683
And no one knows me either.

1621
01:55:56,894 --> 01:55:57,918
Yes, send him.

1622
01:56:37,334 --> 01:56:38,358

What?
- Where are you going?

1628
01:58:53,570 --> 01:58:54,559
What's the matter?
- What do you mean?

1629
01:58:54,705 --> 01:58:56,366
Will you reply meor want to get locked up?

1630
01:58:56,874 --> 01:58:58,671
Where's your house?

1631
01:59:00,244 --> 01:59:01,268
ln Dhanbad.

1632
01:59:02,212 --> 01:59:03,474
How much luggage do you have?

1633
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:05,472
Only one bag.

1634
01:59:05,716 --> 01:59:06,683
Where's it? - Below the seat.

1635
01:59:06,850 --> 01:59:10,411
Pandey! Check his luggage.
- Yes.

1636
01:59:20,430 --> 01:59:22,455
What's this? Tell me.

1637
01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:24,562
Are you traveling in the train or goods compartment?.

1638
01:59:24,668 --> 01:59:28,866
C'mon!

1639
01:59:37,981 --> 01:59:40,848
Fazlu and his friends saw me.

1640
01:59:41,919 --> 01:59:43,443
Everyone is moving with the pistol in hand.

1641
01:59:44,621 --> 01:59:45,918
Time has changed.

1642
01:59:47,391 --> 01:59:49,222
Everyone is upto vandalism.

1643
01:59:49,326 --> 01:59:51,624
Who kept this dish and bowl here?

1644
01:59:51,762 --> 01:59:52,751
Things are not like that in past.

1645
01:59:53,497 --> 01:59:56,091
Where it was Ramadhir Singh,and we on his opposition.

1646
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:57,326
Can it cool a mind?

1647
01:59:57,434 --> 02:00:00,130
Rather it freezes.

1648
02:00:00,237 --> 02:00:02,137
Take it.
- Keep this milk for now.

1649
02:00:02,239 --> 02:00:03,672
Enough of bloodshed.

1650
02:00:04,274 --> 02:00:05,536
Let'sjump into another business.

1651
02:00:05,642 --> 02:00:06,734
Like?

1652
02:00:07,377 --> 02:00:09,004
Fishing.

1653
02:00:09,413 --> 02:00:10,505
What? - Fishing.

1654
02:00:10,814 --> 02:00:12,145
People respect me.

1655
02:00:13,116 --> 02:00:14,743
lf l'll request anyone,he won't refuse.

1656
02:00:14,851 --> 02:00:16,944
Bengalis have shifted here in large numbers,
Who eat fishes.

1657
02:00:17,154 --> 02:00:20,123
l'll talk to few local fishermen.. of course lovingly.

1658
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:21,555
To look for another business..

1659
02:00:21,692 --> 02:00:22,681
..so that we can jump into it.

1660
02:00:22,826 --> 02:00:24,020
ln that case there's a pond..

1661
02:00:24,127 --> 02:00:26,288
..outside Wasseypur.

1662
02:00:26,897 --> 02:00:27,921
lt belongs to the temple authority.

1663
02:00:30,234 --> 02:00:31,724
Why call them up?

1664
02:00:32,069 --> 02:00:33,400
Should we talk business on phone?

1665
02:00:33,537 --> 02:00:36,301
Nagma! You better lock yourself in the freeze.

1666
02:00:37,474 --> 02:00:38,941
l'll sell both of you.

1667
02:00:39,309 --> 02:00:40,708
You as well as the freeze.

1668
02:00:41,211 --> 02:00:42,303
Okay.

1669
02:00:42,613 --> 02:00:44,843
The fishes that you're catching here..

1670
02:00:45,782 --> 02:00:47,579
..now belongs to us.

1671
02:00:47,985 --> 02:00:49,452
We've bought this pond.

1672
02:00:50,287 --> 02:00:52,619
Henceforth, if a single fish is stolen from here..

1673

She's Sultan's sister. Shama Parveen.

1679
02:01:46,610 --> 02:01:49,636
God is Great!

1680
02:01:50,013 --> 02:01:51,708
God is Great!

1681
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:02,356
Uncle Badoor!

1682
02:02:02,459 --> 02:02:04,188
Do you want to listen,to the abuse after the prayer?

1683
02:02:04,328 --> 02:02:06,159
You can say anyt hing to me.

1684
02:02:06,997 --> 02:02:09,295
Please stop this fight amongst each other.

1685
02:02:09,533 --> 02:02:11,160
Your father had started it.

1686
02:02:11,368 --> 02:02:14,599
Listen, uncle. Your grandpa drove,
away my grandpa from this village.

1687
02:02:15,072 --> 02:02:18,098
We can't get to the,root of this fight.

1688
02:02:19,009 --> 02:02:20,806
We have to unite someday.

1689
02:02:21,178 --> 02:02:22,202
What do you mean to say?

1690
02:02:22,412 --> 02:02:23,879
That our religion is same.

1691
02:02:23,980 --> 02:02:25,777
Even our occupation is same.

1692
02:02:26,516 --> 02:02:28,450
Let's co-operate and live.

1693
02:02:28,552 --> 02:02:30,850
What will one gain,by this bloodshed?

1694
02:02:32,356 --> 02:02:33,516
Will your father agree?

1695
02:02:48,805 --> 02:02:49,829
Open it!

1696
02:02:50,741 --> 02:02:52,766

This is wrong, uncle.

1704
02:03:15,632 --> 02:03:18,499
This deal will be costlier for both of us.

1705
02:03:24,608 --> 02:03:26,906
l'll shot everyone.

1706
02:03:27,010 --> 02:03:30,207
He's taking a small piece.

1707
02:03:30,414 --> 02:03:31,278
Won't you take some? - Uncle!

1708
02:03:31,415 --> 02:03:34,509
Are you feeling ashamed?
- Uncle! Uncle!

1709
02:03:35,285 --> 02:03:37,810
Next month, l'm getting married.

1710
02:03:38,422 --> 02:03:40,219
We're waiting for your release.

1711
02:03:40,991 --> 02:03:45,155
And you know what?
We've,stopped this bloodshed business.

1712
02:03:45,896 --> 02:03:48,057
We started dealing fishes.

1713
02:03:48,999 --> 02:03:50,159
lt's doing well.

1714
02:03:51,401 --> 02:03:53,062
Where are you staring at?

1715
02:03:54,037 --> 02:03:56,733
Listen, l'll come toreceive you before marriage.

1716
02:03:57,207 --> 02:03:58,299

1718
02:04:02,312 --> 02:04:03,870
O Youth.

1719
02:04:04,347 --> 02:04:07,373
Poverty shakes up,the weak relations.'

1720
02:04:08,785 --> 02:04:11,845
Poverty shakes up the weak relations.'

1721
02:04:12,722 --> 02:04:15,885
And even the strangers become,
our well wishers when we've money.

1722
02:04:16,860 --> 02:04:19,852
Not every friend is loyal.

1723
02:04:20,730 --> 02:04:22,789
Not every stone is shinning.

1724
02:04:23,633 --> 02:04:26,067
Many flowers blossom in the forest.

1725
02:04:26,670 --> 02:04:28,467
But not every flower is fragrant.

1726
02:05:20,891 --> 02:05:22,859
Mr Ram Yadav?
Please, come..

1727
02:05:37,474 --> 02:05:38,463
Did you get the bullet?

1728
02:05:43,580 --> 02:05:45,775
l met your old friend in the jail.

1729
02:05:49,019 --> 02:05:51,283
Last time when father sent me with money..

1730
02:05:51,655 --> 02:05:52,883
..l didn't understand..

1731
02:05:54,524 --> 02:05:56,082
why anyone would sell such,costly guns at cheap rates?

1732
02:05:56,826 --> 02:06:00,227
Actually, it should be costlier.

1733
02:06:01,932 --> 02:06:06,767
Because you know.. money is kept there.
Full amount. ln the bag.

1734
02:06:13,276 --> 02:06:14,709
Now l understood..

1735
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:18,011
You carry a lot of it.

1736
02:06:20,216 --> 02:06:21,410
Mr. Yadav.

1737
02:06:39,436 --> 02:06:40,596
Mr. Yadav!

1738
02:07:09,432 --> 02:07:10,922
Won't you let me do it with ease?

1739

1740
02:07:13,770 --> 02:07:14,998
Go to the other toilet.

1741
02:07:17,207 --> 02:07:18,765
l said go to the other toilet.

1742
02:07:19,676 --> 02:07:21,974
l'll make the train stop for you,to do it with ease.
Now open it.

1743
02:07:35,859 --> 02:07:37,690
Go now.

1744
02:07:37,827 --> 02:07:39,522
Why did you leave so quickly?
Where are you going?

1745
02:07:39,796 --> 02:07:41,283
At home.
- Yes, but where?

1746
02:07:41,284 --> 02:07:42,026
- Dhanbad.

1747
02:07:42,465 --> 02:07:44,262
What's your name?

1748
02:07:44,634 --> 02:07:46,761
Faizal Khan.

1749
02:07:47,303 --> 02:07:48,327

1750
02:07:49,472 --> 02:07:50,598
Open it.

1751
02:07:59,215 --> 02:08:01,240
What's this? New clothes?

1752
02:08:02,519 --> 02:08:04,282
Jail authorities didn't return my bag.

1753
02:08:06,222 --> 02:08:07,348
l see.

1754
02:08:07,857 --> 02:08:09,017
Whose luggage is this?

1755
02:08:09,159 --> 02:08:10,183
lt's mine.

1756
02:08:10,593 --> 02:08:11,890
Keep it back.

1757
02:08:13,663 --> 02:08:14,925
Spoiled the ironing.

1758
02:08:15,532 --> 02:08:16,658
Smart!

1759
02:08:19,669 --> 02:08:20,966
Let's go.

1760
02:08:24,274 --> 02:08:26,504
Hey, l'll see you again.

1761
02:08:31,781 --> 02:08:32,907
Hello!

1762
02:08:35,785 --> 02:08:36,877
Hello!

1763
02:10:33,636 --> 02:10:34,898
Salutation!

1764
02:10:47,417 --> 02:10:48,543
Didn't he see me?

1765
02:10:49,519 --> 02:10:50,543
He was wearing glasses.

1766
02:10:52,188 --> 02:10:53,280
God!

1767
02:10:53,656 --> 02:10:56,420
No one is other's God..

1768
02:10:57,927 --> 02:11:00,589
..or well wisher.

1769
02:11:02,365 --> 02:11:06,165
By the God's grace, alliances are fixed with one's fate.

1770
02:11:07,737 --> 02:11:10,570
Nice writing.- Have l committed a mistake?

1771
02:11:13,576 --> 02:11:17,205
You fixed alliance with my enemy
and doing politics with me?

1772
02:11:19,649 --> 02:11:21,583
Sardar Khan is your relative now, right?

1773
02:11:22,452 --> 02:11:23,942
That's why he's still alive.

1774
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:28,286
Now, you'll have feast and dances.

1775
02:11:28,892 --> 02:11:31,292
Couple will tie knot.

1776
02:11:32,862 --> 02:11:34,625
But l don't accept it.

1777
02:11:45,174 --> 02:11:47,005
Sultan! - Stop!

1778
02:11:48,144 --> 02:11:50,704
Sultan! - What are you doing?

1779
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:52,279
lt's hurting me. Listen, l'm getting hurt.

1780
02:11:52,548 --> 02:11:56,211
Leave him! Leave, l said.
- Are you mad?

1781
02:11:56,386 --> 02:11:58,581
Do it properly.

1782
02:12:02,859 --> 02:12:04,952
Tie it properly.

1783
02:12:09,065 --> 02:12:11,124
l'll teach them a lesson.

1784
02:12:11,267 --> 02:12:14,100
What are you doing?

1785
02:12:14,704 --> 02:12:16,262
Will you put the festoons like this?

1786
02:12:16,673 --> 02:12:18,698
Look there. - What's all this?

1787
02:12:19,943 --> 02:12:21,911
Why are you wearing white dress?
Are you mourning?

1788
02:12:22,445 --> 02:12:24,970
Aren't you wearing underwear?

1789
02:12:25,181 --> 02:12:27,911
Get him a pajama. Will these
lower class people wear pajama?

1790
02:12:28,751 --> 02:12:30,651
Sultan! - Today you people will dance.

1791
02:12:30,787 --> 02:12:32,652
C'mon, get him a pajama.

1792
02:12:32,789 --> 02:12:36,850
Sultan! Ramadhir Singh is taking
advantage of our internal enmity.

1793
02:12:38,127 --> 02:12:39,754
What's his concern with Wasseypur?

1794
02:12:39,862 --> 02:12:41,386
Aren't you ashamed?

1795
02:12:41,798 --> 02:12:44,266
You're Qureshi's son.

1796
02:12:44,367 --> 02:12:45,925
Of a dacoit Sultana! English were scared of him.

1797
02:12:46,202 --> 02:12:48,534
And look at him. He hasjust inherited his father's look.

1798
02:12:48,671 --> 02:12:50,866
Look at him! He has got no guts.

1799
02:12:53,209 --> 02:12:54,870
Try and understand.

1800
02:12:55,378 --> 02:12:57,369
lt's no use creating a scene here.

1801
02:12:57,513 --> 02:12:58,912
Leave me.- We just want to be together.

1802
02:12:59,382 --> 02:13:01,942
Never count me. Do not link me in this.

1803
02:13:02,151 --> 02:13:03,277
l'm separate.

1804
02:13:03,586 --> 02:13:05,144
l know to show my loyalty.

1805
02:13:05,488 --> 02:13:06,750
l'm not like you.

1806
02:13:07,290 --> 02:13:10,020
Go and lie down at Sardar's feet.

1807
02:13:10,126 --> 02:13:12,458
Mind your language, Sultan.

1808
02:13:13,529 --> 02:13:14,860
Don't teach me manners.

1809
02:13:15,665 --> 02:13:19,192
Will you teach me manners? Where's he?
- Listen!

1810
02:13:19,335 --> 02:13:22,498
Move! Where's he?
- Sultan! - Get away.

1811
02:13:22,805 --> 02:13:24,534
Leave me. Sultan!

1812
02:13:24,874 --> 02:13:26,466
Come out! - Sultan!

1813
02:13:30,947 --> 02:13:33,415

Since, you're my sister, l'm telling you.

1822
02:14:09,185 --> 02:14:10,618
Do not accept this marriage, otherwise, l'll kill you.

1823
02:14:33,209 --> 02:14:34,938
How can he sing in this voice?

1824
02:15:02,105 --> 02:15:03,902
Wow! Very nice!

Look, how happy l am.

1828

What happened?

1829

You've saved many lives by marrying me.

1830
02:18:36,285 --> 02:18:38,685
My parents would be blessing you.

1831
02:18:39,088 --> 02:18:41,386
Then why are you crying?

1832

Because, l'm very happy.

1833
02:18:43,926 --> 02:18:46,087
Oh, really?

1834

You know what?

1835
02:18:49,832 --> 02:18:52,027
l did this to get you.

1836
02:18:58,741 --> 02:19:01,938
