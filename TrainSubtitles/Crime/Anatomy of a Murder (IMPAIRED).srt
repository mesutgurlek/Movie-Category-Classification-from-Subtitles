Well, I suppose I could.
I'll see him tomorrow morning.

A man named Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion.

Her husband, he's a lieutenant in the army.

There's a temporary base in Thunder Bay.
Gunnery or something.

107
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:22,872
The lieutenant goes to Quill's place
and plugs Mr. Quill about five times...

108
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,374
which causes Mr. Quill
to promptly die of lead poisoning.

00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,911
Well, you can put them back on
if it's more comfortable for ya.

156
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,256
This is Polly Biegler.
This is the bucko, Polly.

157
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,258
- Lieutenant Manion.
- Hello there.

158
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,260
- Hi, Manny.
- Hello, Laura.

159
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,391
Uh, Mrs. Manion, I wonder
if you could meet me

160
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:54,226
down at my office about
2:00 this afternoon.

161
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,312
It's 305 West Barnham.

162
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,355
- Of course.
- Fine.

163
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,735
- Is there anything I can get you, hon?
- I'm all right, hon.

164
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,322
Right in here.

165
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,629
"Wanted." The big ten.

166
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,632
[Chuckles]
They got the ten best-dressed dames...

167
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:28,010
the ten top teams, the ten top tunes...

168
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,012
and now, the ten most wanted.

169
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,244
Well, don't knock it.
That's the American dream.

170
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:34,391
Those boys made the grade.

171
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:39,647
You were the... district attorney
around here, weren't you?

172
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,649
Mm-hmm. Ten years.

173
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,193
What's your experience as a defense lawyer?

174
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,153
Not very much.

175
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,155
How do I know you can handle my case?

176
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,200
Well, I guess you don't know.

177
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,202
Shall we talk about it?

178
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,789
I suppose so.

179
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,500
Well, now, come on, Lieutenant.
Don't be so bored.

180
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:03,212
You know, it might very well be
that no lawyer can handle your case...

181
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,214
if you mean getting off scot-free.

182
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,759
You seem to be forgetting
Barney Quill raped my wife.

183
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,719
I have the unwritten law on my side.

184
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,722
The unwritten law is a myth, Lieutenant.

185
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,600
There is no such thing
as the unwritten law...

186
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,728
and anyone who commits a murder
on the theory that it does exist...

187
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:23,065
has just bought himself
room and board in the state penitentiary.

188
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,900
Maybe for life.

189
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,778
Now, with that in mind...

190
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:33,325
perhaps we can proceed with a few questions
and answers that... that, uh...

191
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,536
Can I borrow your lighter?

192
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,771
We can proceed with a few
questions and answers

193
00:16:40,772 --> 00:16:43,169
that might be of some
help in your defense.

194
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,882
But probably won't be.

195
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,927
Yeah. Nice lighter.

196
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:57,892
- Okay.
- Well, how old are you?

197
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,269
- Twenty-eight.
- How long have you been in the service?

198
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,730
Since '50.

199
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,107
- You seen any action?
- Korea.

200
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,568
- Have any decorations?
- Plenty.

201
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,570
Is this your first marriage?

202
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,238
No.

203
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:14,408
You're not on the witness stand.
You don't have to answer yes or no.

204
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,411
Just give me the matrimonial rundown.

205
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:21,123
- Is this necessary?
- I'll be the judge of that.

206
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,211
My first wife divorced me.

207
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,130
Charged cruelty. [Chuckles]

208
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:31,133
Eating crackers in bed.
You know, the usual stuff.

209
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:36,388
Truth was, she found another guy
when I was in Korea.

210
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,852
I met Laura four years ago in Georgia.

211
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,647
We were married right after her divorce.

212
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,774
Did you know the husband?

213
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,694
- He was in my outfit down there.
- You mean you were buddies?

214
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:54,823
I'll withdraw the question.
That's a little old-fashioned.

215
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:58,410
Have there been any children by or from
any of these marriages?

216
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,914
- No.
- Any present prospects?

217
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,083
Not unless Barney Quill started something.

218
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,335
What kind of a gun did you use on Quill?

219
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,797
War souvenir. Luger.
The police have it now.

220
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:13,342
I suppose you've read the newspapers,
the stories about your case?

221
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,928
- Some of them.
- Are they substantially correct?

222
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,137
Yes.

223
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:20,015
And you didn't see Quill
rape and beat your wife?

224
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,142
No. No.

225
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:26,689
When she got back, uh, to the trailer,
she told me what had happened.

226
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,566
Then how long was it before you went
over to Quill's and killed him?

227
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,527
I don't know exactly. Maybe an hour.

228
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,988
That long, huh?

229
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,283
Now, the newspapers say that your wife
volunteered to take a lie detector test.

230
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,034
You know anything about this?

231
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,370
Only what I read and what she told me.

232
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,872
Do you know how
the lie detector test turned out?

233
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,375
- They didn't tell her.
- Yes, Sulo?

234
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,087
Polly, we got lunch served for the jail.
You want to eat with us?

235
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,215
Does your sister still cook for the jail?

236
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,093
- Oh, sure. She cooks.
- Uh-huh.

237
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,513
Well, you give her my compliments, Sulo.

238
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,558
- I've got a luncheon date downtown.
- Nice going, Mr. Biegler.

239
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,935
- I'll be back after lunch.
- Look, uh...

240
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,479
I'm sorry if I offended you a while ago.

241
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,149
No, you're not.

242
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,485
Come on, bucko.

243
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,070
Thank you.

244
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,824
Pass the salt, Polly.

245
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,828
Thank you.

246
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,707
Did you give the lieutenant
the well-known lecture?

247
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,627
If you mean did I coach him
into a phony story, no.

248
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:34,340
Maybe you're too pure, Paul.

249
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,967
Too pure for the natural
impurities of the law.

250
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:42,097
Could be that you owe the lieutenant
a chance to find a defense.

251
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,308
Could also be that you might
guide him a little...

252
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,394
show him the way,
and let him decide if he wants to take it.

253
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,147
- Want some salt?
- No. I'm not ready.

254
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,358
Anyway, I'm not the right lawyer
for this fellow.

255
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,860
He's insolent, hostile.

256
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,864
You don't have to love him.
Just defend him.

257
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,784
What's the matter? Don't you need a fee?

258
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,663
You know something?
I think you might be a little bit afraid.

259
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:09,833
- Afraid of what?
- That you might get licked.

260
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:17,508
You know, there's only one thing more
devious than a Philadelphia lawyer...

261
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,718
and that's an Irish lawyer.

262
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,720
Pass the salt.

263
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,225
Put it down. Put it down.

264
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:37,236
- Hello there.
- I usually answer to the name Paul.

265
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,321
Are we gonna have some more jokes?

266
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,490
Not unless you want to be the comic.

267
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,033
Oh.

268
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:45,160
I brought you some cigarettes.

269
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,162
- Oh, thanks.
- Peace?

270
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,332
- Oh, sure.
- Fine, fine. Now, Lieutenant...

271
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,961
there are four ways I can defend murder.

272
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,339
Number one, it wasn't murder.
It was suicide or accidental.

273
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:00,426
Number two, you didn't do it.
Number three, you were legally justified...

274
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,719
like the protection of your home
or self-defense.

275
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:06,348
Number four, the killing was excusable.

276
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,643
Where do I fit into this rosy picture?

277
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:13,981
I'll tell you where you don't fit.
You don't fit in any of the first three.

278
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:17,818
Why? Why wouldn't I be legally justified
in killing the man who raped my wife?

279
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,486
Time element.

280
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,197
If you'd caught him in the act,
the shooting might have been justified...

281
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,032
but you didn't catch him in the act.

282
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,869
You had time to bring in the police,
and you didn't do that either.

283
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:30,164
You're guilty of murder,
premeditated and with vengeance.

284
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,166
That's first-degree murder
in any court of law.

285
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,168
Are you telling me to plead guilty?

286
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,170
When I advise you to cop out, you'll know.

287
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,672
- "Cop out"?
- That's plead guilty and ask for mercy.

288
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:42,176
Well, if you're not telling me to cop out,
what are you telling me to do?

289
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,178
I'm not telling you to do anything.

290
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:47,306
I just want you to understand
the letter of the law.

291
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,811
- Go on.
- Go on with what?

292
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,149
Whatever it is you're getting at.

293
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,364
You know, you're very bright, Lieutenant.

294
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:09,244
Now let's see how really bright you can be.

295
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:15,417
Well... I'm working at it.

296
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,879
All right. Because your wife was raped...

297
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,340
you'll have a favorable atmosphere
in the courtroom.

298
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,301
The sympathy will be with you,
if all the facts are true.

299
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,450
What you need is a legal
peg so that the jury

300
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:28,514
can hang up their
sympathy in your behalf.

301
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:32,059
- You follow me?
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:35,437
What's your legal excuse, Lieutenant?

303
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:40,025
What's your legal excuse
for killing Barney Quill?

304
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,279
Not justification, huh?

305
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,323
Not justification.

306
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,205
Excuse.

307
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,669
J-Just excuse.

308
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,101
What excuses are there?

309
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,895
How should I know?
You're the one that plugged Quill.

310
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,817
- I must've been mad.
- How's that?

311
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,736
I said I must've been mad.

312
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,326
No, a bad temper's no excuse.

313
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:36,915
Well, I mean, uh, I...
I must've been crazy.

314
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:43,547
Am I getting warmer?

315
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:50,095
- Okay, Sulo.
- Paul?

316
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,348
Am I getting warmer?

317
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,767
Well, I'll tell you that
after I talk to your wife.

318
00:23:55,852 --> 00:24:00,063
In the meantime, see if you can remember
just how crazy you were.

319
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,363
- [Typing]
- Mrs. Manion here yet?

320
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,533
- ## [Jazz]
- She's been waiting quite a while.

321
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:14,911
She's been through all your albums
from Dixieland to Brubeck.

322
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:18,415
- What do you think of her?
- Soft, easy.

323
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:22,044
The kind men like to take advantage of...
and do.

324
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,212
- Did you get any money?
- Huh?

325
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,590
- Money.
- Oh. Oh, no.

326
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,800
I haven't decided to take the case yet.

327
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:32,512
You know, you surprise me sometimes.

328
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:35,015
Why? I've been around.

329
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,517
Yeah, well...

330
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:44,650
- ## [Loud Dixieland Jazz]
- Hi.

331
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,861
Hi.

332
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:53,492
- I, uh...
- ## [Stops]

333
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:57,245
I hope you don't mind.
I think we'd better talk.

334
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,623
You're a funny kind of a lawyer.

335
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:04,169
- The music, I mean.
- Aren't lawyers supposed to like music?

336
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,838
Well, not that kind of music.

337
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:10,467
Well, I guess that settles it.
I'm a funny kind of lawyer.

338
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,762
Where's your home, Mrs. Manion?
Where'd you go to school?

339
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,431
Where'd you live when
you were growing up?

340
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,015
Oh, no place in particular.

341
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,081
We sort of moved around.

342
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:21,061
My father was a boomer...
construction boomer.

343
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,105
Building dams, mostly.

344
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,898
You can call me Laura.

345
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:29,778
- Is your family still alive, Laura?
- No.

346
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,822
I don't know. I have some
cigarettes around here someplace.

347
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,282
- Do you want a cigarette?
- No, I wanted to offer you one.

348
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:37,285
- You could light it for me.
- Oh, yes.

349
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,872
Here.

350
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:42,979
That's just like your
husband's, isn't it?

351
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,084
Mm-hmm.

352
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,131
He gave me this because
I liked the one he had.

353
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,383
He's like that.
He gives me presents all the time.

354
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,343
Do you have a happy marriage?

355
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,846
Yes.

356
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,807
What went wrong with the first marriage?

357
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,060
Well, what went wrong is
when I went for Manny.

358
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,104
Well, that's honest enough.

359
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:07,441
It was more than just that.
Like I told you, I grew up on the move...

360
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:10,193
and Jack... that was my first husband...

361
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:14,072
Jack didn't like to move. He wouldn't even
take a transfer when he had the chance.

362
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:16,116
I was really bored.

363
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,036
Manny likes to go. We're always
going, whenever we get the chance.

364
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,831
We've been all over. I'm thirsty.

365
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,083
Water? Or would a beer do?

366
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:27,085
I think a beer would do fine.

367
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,338
Maida, bring me a bottle of beer,
will you?

368
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,760
- Are you married?
- No.

369
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,304
That's nice.

370
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,807
What do you do alone
in this house if you aren't married?

371
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:43,894
Well, it's a family home.
I'm the last of the family.

372
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,937
- There you are.
- Thank you.

373
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:50,358
- Aren't you having one?
- No, not right now. Thanks.

374
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,361
- There you are.
- [Muff Whines]

375
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:56,490
Oh, could Muff have a little?
In that ashtray, maybe. He loves beer.

376
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:59,034
- You want a beer for the dog?
- Mm-hmm.

377
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,536
Well, here we are.

378
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,752
[Laura] He'll go to sleep now.

379
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:14,424
- Isn't he cute?
- Yeah.

380
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:16,843
Well, how about it? Are you ready?

381
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,348
I mean, are you ready to tell me the story?

382
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,517
I know what you mean.

383
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:28,230
Yeah. Well, now, suppose you tell me
everything you told the state police...

384
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,733
plus everything you didn't
tell the state police.

385
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:36,905
- Where shall I begin?
- What time did you leave for Quill's bar?

386
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:40,325
Right after dinner. About 8:30, I guess.

387
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,744
Manny was late getting home
from the firing range...

388
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:45,705
so we had dinner
and he laid down and went to sleep.

389
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,874
I hadn't been out of
the trailer almost all day...

390
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:51,211
so I took Muff and a flashlight
and walked over to the bar.

391
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,964
I bought a drink
and played the pinball machine.

392
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:55,549
Many people in the bar?

393
00:27:55,633 --> 00:28:00,554
Not many. Barney came over
and challenged me to a game.

394
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:03,807
- For drinks, you know.
- How well did you know Barney?

395
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:07,435
Well, he owned this bar where Manny
and I went sometimes. That's all.

396
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,023
- Had he ever made a pass at you?
- No. Nothing like that at all.

397
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,651
Was he drinking heavily that night?

398
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,864
He didn't seem to be.
At least not when we were playing pinball.

399
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:21,575
Were you with him
the whole time you were there?

400
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,743
Oh, no. There were other
people playing too.

401
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:26,288
What time did you leave the bar?

402
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:29,541
Oh, about 11:00, I guess.

403
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,961
I left by the side door.
Muff was carrying the flashlight.

404
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,921
He carries it in his mouth.

405
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:37,007
He's so cute running along ahead
with the light shining.

406
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,801
- Was he sober?
- Muff? Of course he was sober.

407
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,803
Oh, you're joking now, aren't you?

408
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:45,223
Yes, I'm joking. Uh, go on.

409
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:49,477
Well, Barney came from somewhere.
Not the door I left by.

410
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,981
And he said he was going my way
and he could drive me home.

411
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,693
He said the bears had been prowling around
that night, and I oughtn't to walk home.

412
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,987
The bears come out of the woods
at night to scavenge.

413
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,114
Yeah, but they're harmless enough,
aren't they?

414
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,950
Yeah. I suppose I wouldn't have
been afraid in the daylight...

415
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:06,119
but, well, the dark isn't
the same, you know.

416
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:09,372
Yes, I know. I know.
Now, you got into Barney's car.

417
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:11,708
I got in and he drove
straight to the trailer park.

418
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,710
He made overtures?

419
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,087
No, nothing.
When we got to the trailer park...

420
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:18,089
the auto gate was closed.

421
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:21,843
Mr. Lemon closes it
about 11:00 or a little after.

422
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:24,512
So I thanked Barney
and started to get out of the car...

423
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,390
but he said that there wasn't
any need for me to walk...

424
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:30,268
that he could drive me
into the park on another road.

425
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:35,523
I didn't know there was another road, but
he drove on before I could say yes or no.

426
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:38,026
- Were you alarmed?
- No.

427
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,195
I'm not usually afraid of men.

428
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,823
And anyway, he hadn't touched me
or even said anything out of the way.

429
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:49,329
Well, doesn't a woman sort of instinctively
know when a fellow's on the make?

430
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,540
Oh, sure. But that's only usual with me.

431
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,669
With men, I mean... almost all men.
Ever since I was a kid.

432
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,630
You, for instance. You're interested.

433
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,674
But there isn't any reason
to be afraid of you.

434
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:02,634
It was like that with Barney.

435
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,886
Well, now, Mrs. Manion,
believe me, I'm not in the least...

436
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,222
Call me Laura.

437
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,224
Uh, Laura.

438
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,435
I'm only interested in
helping your husband.

439
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,561
Nothing more.

440
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,231
Oh, I don't mean you'd try anything.

441
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:20,026
I just mean it's...
it's the way you look at me.

442
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,030
Well, it'd be very difficult
not to look at you.

443
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:26,908
Oh, the way I dress, you mean?
You don't like it?

444
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:30,036
Oh, I love it. I just love it.

445
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:34,082
Now, we-we'd better keep
moving along with this thing.

446
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,044
Now, uh, how were you dressed that night?

447
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,880
Oh, in a sweater like this and a skirt.

448
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,341
And the rest. What about that?

449
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:44,926
Underneath?

450
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:48,096
I had on a slip and panties and a bra.

451
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,765
- No girdle?
- I don't need a girdle.

452
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,600
Do you think I need a girdle?

453
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,936
I don't know.

454
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,105
I don't know. How sh... I...

455
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,899
Look, I'm only concerned
with a few facts...

456
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:02,610
that might be of help to me
in the defense of your husband.

457
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:05,363
- That's all.
- Well, I don't wear one.

458
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:09,367
Okay. No girdle. Okay.
All right. Now go on.

459
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:13,163
Well, he turned off the highway
into a lane in the woods...

460
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:16,082
and he stopped the car
and turned off the lights.

461
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:18,251
And then he grabbed me, and he said...

462
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,670
"I'm gonna rape you,"
just like that.

463
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:23,923
- Did he use those words?
- Exactly those words.

464
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:26,509
Muff began to bark,
so he threw him out the window.

465
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:30,346
I could hear little Muffy
whining outside the car all through it.

466
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,641
Barney began to try to get at me...

467
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:36,811
and I fought him off as best I could,
but he was terribly strong.

468
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,230
Did you cry out? Did you scream?

469
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:42,150
It didn't seem to be much use
out there in the woods.

470
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:47,155
He began to shout names at me
like "army slut" and some other names.

471
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,824
And then he drew back and
hit me with his fist.

472
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,786
He hit me again, and I
didn't fight anymore.

473
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:58,249
I must've been only half conscious,
but I know that he tore my panties off...

474
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,251
and did what he wanted.

475
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,379
Now, the newspapers said
that a doctor examined you...

476
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,507
and said that he didn't
think you'd been raped.

477
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:09,344
I don't care what the doctor thought.
A woman doesn't mistake these things.

478
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,472
All right. All right. Now go ahead.

479
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,140
Well, I...

480
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,144
I don't know exactly what happened then.
I must've fainted.

481
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:21,356
But the next thing I remember,
the car was moving.

482
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,610
Barney was driving very fast,
and... and he was breathing hard.

483
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:29,030
An ugly, gasping sound.

484
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:32,742
We were on the main road
to the trailer park...

485
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:35,578
and he swung in by the gate and stopped.

486
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,769
I opened the door to get out.
Muffy jumped out

487
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,874
first, with a lighted
flashlight in his mouth.

488
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,043
Well, now, wait a minute.
I thought you said...

489
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:44,546
he'd thrown Muff out of the car
back in the woods.

490
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,257
Well, he did, but Muff was
in the car when we got back.

491
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,217
He must've let him back in.
I don't remember.

492
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,846
All right. All right. Now, you opened the
door, and Muff got out first. All right.

493
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,557
Before I could get out,
Barney grabbed me...

494
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,893
and said he was gonna tear all my
clothes off and attack me again.

495
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,688
I got away and ran.

496
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,397
I could see Muff at an
opening in the fence.

497
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,900
He was scooting back and forth
with the flashlight.

498
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:09,946
Barney caught me from behind,
and I fell to the ground.

499
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,866
He fell on top of me and began
to beat me again with his fists.

500
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,868
I thought he was gonna kill me.

501
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:19,581
I screamed, and somehow or other
I got to my feet again and ran.

502
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:22,250
I went through the opening
in the fence and followed Muffy.

503
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,544
He was running along ahead
with the flashlight.

504
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:27,589
And I kept following the light
until he led me to our trailer.

505
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,883
And you didn't see Barney again?

506
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:32,719
Never laid eyes on him
again, dead or alive.

507
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,722
Well, I...

508
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,682
I think that's enough for now.

509
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,977
I've got lots of time. All you want.

510
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,355
Where can I reach you?

511
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,192
I'm still in Thunder Bay,
but I can drive down again in the morning.

512
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,781
- Was there something else?
- No.

513
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:08,463
Thanks for letting me play the records.

514
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,549
- Oh, you're very welcome.
- Thanks a lot. Bye.

515
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,931
- Who's that?
- The lady in the case.

516
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:19,307
Oh.

517
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,810
And you're not gonna take the case, huh?

518
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:27,148
Well, I don't know. That depends on
what Manion has to tell me tomorrow.

519
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,776
He's thinking things out.

520
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,903
Oh, well, that's more like it.

521
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:35,073
Now, if I take the case, I want you in it.

522
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:39,077
Me? In a big murder case?

523
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,872
Why, Polly, the sight of
this whiskey-drinking

524
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:44,040
old man at the counsel
table would ruin you.

525
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,709
I need you.

526
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,836
Do you mean that?

527
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,506
Why else would he say it?

528
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,093
Well, I'd be glad to work with you
outside of the courtroom...

529
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,095
but not in the courtroom.

530
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:01,432
Well, suit yourself about that. Either way,
I'm gonna have to be able to depend on you.

531
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,687
Will you lay off the booze?

532
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:15,571
I don't know.
I don't know about that, Polly.

533
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,615
Why don't you know?

534
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,495
Do you think I could lay off the booze?

535
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,498
[Maida] Ever tried it?

536
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,419
Try it.

537
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:36,134
I've never been on a big murder case.

538
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:39,470
Not once in all my life.

539
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,472
It's up to you, Parn.

540
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,773
Will you be around tonight?

541
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:54,360
Yeah. Yeah. I'll be around.

542
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:06,247
You know, Maida, darlin'...

543
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:09,250
I might manage it.

544
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:12,378
I might manage to be a real lawyer again.

545
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,673
For a little while anyway.

546
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,262
I tried remembering.

547
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:23,723
There were still some pieces missing.

548
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:27,226
I remember...

549
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,939
going to Quill's bar with a gun...

550
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:35,651
and I remember Quill's face behind the bar.

551
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,947
But I don't remember anything else,
not even going home.

552
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:42,033
Don't you remember firing the gun?

553
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,452
Five shots.
That's a lot of noise to forget.

554
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:48,498
Yeah, I remember hearing shots, but they
don't seem to be connected with me.

555
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:50,541
They seemed far away...

556
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:53,920
like somebody else was doing the shooting.

557
00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:01,886
Lieutenant Manion, I'll, uh...
I'll take your case.

558
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,722
Why, thanks. Thanks, Mr. Biegler.

559
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:07,975
All right. Now, there's
the little matter of the fee.

560
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,977
Three thousand dollars.
That's reasonable enough, isn't it?

561
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,979
Oh, sure, sure. More than reasonable.

562
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,065
I'll have to pay you later.
Right now I'm broke.

563
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,526
- You're what?
- I'm broke. I'm flat busted.

564
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,986
I don't have three dollars,
much less 3,000.

565
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:22,990
- Well, can you raise it?
- Oh, yeah, as soon as I get outta jail.

566
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:26,077
But, uh, next week's payday.

567
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,080
I'll, uh...
I'll be able to give you $150.

568
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:32,375
And if you get me off, I'll give you
a promissory note for the rest.

569
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:36,129
All right. Now, suppose I don't go along
with you unless you pay me half the fee?

570
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:40,216
Well, I'll have to take
the lawyer the court appoints.

571
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,928
- I got my defense now. Right? Insanity.
- Yeah.

572
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,848
I think I'll stick around
and make damn sure you get off.

573
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:51,144
- Where do we start?
- We're gonna need a psychiatrist.

574
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:53,313
As much as neither one
of us has any money,

575
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,398
do you think the army'll
stir one up for you?

576
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,400
Well, I know a colonel in the Pentagon.

577
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,610
- I'll write a letter.
- Good. Do that. Sulo.

578
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,285
Where are you going now?

579
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,662
I'm going to see your wife, for one thing.

580
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,206
Why? Didn't you see her yesterday?

581
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,333
That's right. I did.

582
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,627
She's a very pretty woman, your wife.

583
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,339
A man gets used to the
way his wife looks.

584
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,174
Yeah. I can see that.

585
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:23,176
I'll see ya.

586
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:42,278
Come on in, Polly. Come on in.

587
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,989
You haven't been in here since you vacated,
have you, Polly?

588
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,492
- No.
- Hardly recognize the old place, huh?

589
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:50,077
Mary did it for me.
She just finished a decorator's course.

590
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,580
Smart girl.
Very smart girl. Look at this.

591
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,416
- A real, genuine Picasso print.
- It's very nice.

592
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:58,586
And here, try this chair.
It sort of does things for you.

593
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,755
- Huh?
- Yeah. Sit right down.

594
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,549
[Mechanical Rattling]

595
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,258
Great, isn't it?
Good for the nerves, they say.

596
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:07,929
- Yeah. How do you shut it off?
- There. Here we are.

597
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,681
- Feel better?
- I feel all shook up.

598
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,141
Whew!

599
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:17,355
Uh, Mitch, I just dropped by to tell you
I've got both feet in the Manion case.

600
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,398
- You're going to cop out, aren't you?
- No.

601
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:21,276
That's a mistake, Polly.
It's open and shut.

602
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:23,069
Well, maybe. We'll see.

603
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,071
Judge Maitland is still in the hospital.

604
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,615
Maybe you'd like to agree
to a continuance until he gets back.

605
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,909
If we go with the case now,
we'll have to try...

606
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,203
before some grab-bag judge they'll send in.

607
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,872
- Me, I'd rather have Maitland.
- Yeah. So would I.

608
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:38,042
But of course that'd also mean my client
would lie around in jail...

609
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,503
for another two, three months
before the trial.

610
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:44,298
Now, if you'll drop the charge
down to manslaughter...

611
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:47,218
so I can get him out on bail,
we'll agree to a continuance.

612
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,637
You wouldn't do that if you were still D.A.

613
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,139
Oh, I don't know. I might.

614
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:55,142
I might, since a great big fat
lie detector test on his wife...

615
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,562
has given proof to the rape story.

616
00:39:57,646 --> 00:40:01,023
- He'd have the jury with him.
- How did you know what the lie...

617
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:03,025
- Bit, didn't I?
- Yeah. You did.

618
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,653
Anyway, the result of a lie detector test
isn't admissible evidence.

619
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:09,490
- You can't use it.
- No, but it carries moral weight.

620
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:12,952
[Mutters] Mitch, I wouldn't
sit in that chair too much.

621
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,454
It could shake a fellow's brains loose.

622
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:17,456
I'll see you later.

623
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:24,755
[Muff Barks]

624
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:28,426
He remembers you, Paul. He likes you.

625
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,428
- He likes the beer in my icebox.
- [Laughs]

626
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,805
Well, what's the occasion today?
A buffalo hunt?

627
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,933
I bought these in Arizona
when we were stationed there.

628
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:37,978
Aren't they smart?
I think they're very smart.

629
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:39,937
Here. We can sit in my car.

630
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:48,696
Here you are.

631
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:51,782
Here you go, Muffy.

632
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,118
Several things have occurred to me.

633
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,162
The, uh...

634
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:59,874
The undergarments
that Barney Quill tore off.

635
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,376
Who has them now? The police?

636
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,545
You mean my panties?

637
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,547
All right. Your panties.

638
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,549
I haven't seen them since.

639
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:10,551
I gave the torn skirt
and sweater to the police...

640
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:14,221
and then I went with them up that lane
into the woods to look for the panties.

641
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,329
But we couldn't find
anything but my glasses.

642
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:18,351
Your glasses?

643
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:20,394
You mean you were wearing glasses
through all that?

644
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:23,314
No. I had them in a case in my hand.

645
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,233
I wear them for reading, playing pinball.
Things like that.

646
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,736
I must've tried to get
out of the car and dropped them.

647
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,696
Uh-huh.

648
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:34,367
You, uh, might be interested to know
that your lie detector test...

649
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:36,577
turned out in your favor.

650
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:39,497
Of course it did.
I could've told you it would.

651
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:44,168
- You weren't worried about it?
- No. Why should I be?

652
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:47,838
Would you like to have
something to worry about?

653
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:49,548
[Chuckles] Silly.

654
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,926
Like your husband watching us
from his cell window?

655
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:59,058
All right. All right. Let's have it.

656
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:03,771
- Did he say something to you?
- Just enough.

657
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,898
Are you afraid of him?

658
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,442
Yes.

659
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:11,612
Is that why you volunteered
for a lie detector test? For him?

660
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:15,533
- Yeah.
- Mmm. Does he have reason to be jealous?

661
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:18,953
He was jealous even before we were married.

662
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,122
I should have known how it would be.

663
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,709
It's funny though. He...
He likes to show me off.

664
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,961
He likes me to dress the way I do.

665
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:30,005
And then he gets furious
if a man pays any attention to me.

666
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:33,092
I've tried to leave him, but I can't.

667
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,177
He begs. I give in.

668
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,849
Now, if you think I've forgotten
my question, I haven't.

669
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,977
- I have.
- All right.

670
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,438
All right. Then I'll ask it again.

671
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:48,566
Does your husband
have any reason to be jealous?

672
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,652
No.

673
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:54,155
Not once. Not ever.

674
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:03,742
[Door Opens]

675
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:14,670
All right? You like the place all right?

676
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,131
I was just lookin' at these pictures.

677
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:20,801
- That was Barney Quill, wasn't it?
- That's right. Barney Quill.

678
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:23,262
- I'm Paul Biegler...
- I know who you are.

679
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,598
Seen you around Iron City.

680
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:29,894
- You didn't tell me your name.
- Paquette. We don't open till 5:00.

681
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:33,564
That's all right. I can wait.
I don't have the shakes yet. [Chuckles]

682
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,775
You were on the job that
night, weren't you?

683
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,069
The night Barney Quill was killed.

684
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:41,488
Like the newspaper said, I was present.

685
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:45,117
You were the fellow that stopped
Lieutenant Manion outside.

686
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:48,662
That's right. He, uh...
He pointed the gun at me and said...

687
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:50,497
"You want some too, buster?"

688
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:53,167
And you said no,
because your name isn't buster.

689
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:55,753
There wasn't anything funny
about it, Mr. Biegler.

690
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:58,464
No. There wasn't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

691
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:02,176
Where were you when Barney Quill
was killed, Mr. Paquette?

692
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:05,012
[Sighs]

693
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,640
I gather you don't want to
talk about that night, huh?

694
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:10,184
That's right.
I don't want to talk about it.

695
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,228
Have to talk to me about it in court.
Why not now?

696
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:16,565
Because I don't have to now.
Reason enough, okay?

697
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:17,858
Okay.

698
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:23,697
Okay. Boy, old Barney, he was kind of
a rugged character, wasn't he?

699
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:27,868
Ex-prize fighter, muscle man.
Fancy with guns.

700
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:30,371
He paid his debts, ran a clean place.

701
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,415
- Me, I liked him.
- You run the place now?

702
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,044
No, I just work here.
Mary's running things.

703
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,296
Mary. Was that Barney's wife?

704
00:46:39,381 --> 00:46:42,591
No. He wasn't... He didn't have a wife.
Mary was his manager.

705
00:46:42,676 --> 00:46:46,553
Oh. Gee, I wonder
who's gonna inherit the place.

706
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:50,015
- Mary, I guess.
- Hmm, Mary again?

707
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,017
What's the matter with that?

708
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:55,187
You mean what's the matter with Mary?
I don't know what's the matter with Mary.

709
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,147
Mary what?

710
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:59,066
Pilant. Mary Pilant.

711
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,068
She's in the back booth.

712
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:04,405
We don't talk about our customers here,
but if we did...

713
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:07,533
- Which we don't...
- Thank you.

714
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:10,202
[Whispers]
That's her. That's Mary Pilant.

715
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,296
Do you know Lieutenant Manion's wife?

716
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:23,674
Sure. I know the lieutenant too.

717
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,593
He's a good officer. She's all right too.

718
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:29,054
- Friendly. Good kid.
- [Laughs]

719
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:31,056
What do you know about it?
Knock it off.

720
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:33,934
I didn't mean anything.
She's a dish. What's the matter with that?

721
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:36,562
You want this lawyer to get wrong ideas?

722
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,857
What chances has the lieutenant got,
Mr. McCarthy?

723
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:43,694
Pretty good, I'd say, with a couple
of character witnesses like you.

724
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:50,409
I'd like to help him out. I sure would, but
we're moving out. The whole outfit. Berlin.

725
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,911
Oh. Uh, tell me...

726
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:55,831
who is this babe at the hotel?

727
00:47:55,915 --> 00:48:00,502
Name's Mary Pilant.
She was Quill's private property.

728
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:16,060
- Would you like a table, sir?
- Yes, please.

729
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:25,736
- Will you be alone?
- I'll be joined by two others.

730
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,406
- May I take your hat?
- Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

731
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:38,290
How was the manicure?

732
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:41,502
Just ask me any questions about anybody.
I've got all the dope.

733
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:44,588
Well, can you tell me about a woman
by the name of Mary Pilant?

734
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,340
Easy.

735
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:50,594
Mary Pilant may or may not have been
the mistress of the late B. Quill.

736
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,179
Oh?

737
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,680
The manicurist is in favor
of the mistress theory...

738
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:55,682
but the hairdresser is agin it.

739
00:48:55,767 --> 00:49:00,521
However, they both agree that some sort of
hanky-panky must've been going on.

740
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,689
- To be continued.
- Menu?

741
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:04,691
Thank you.

742
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:08,654
- Pretty, huh?
- Yes, she's very pretty.

743
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:10,531
Well, go on. Go on.

744
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,825
Well, anyway, there's
one story that says

745
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:15,035
that Barney's wild night
with Mrs. Manion...

746
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,205
was somehow triggered by Mary Pilant.

747
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:22,209
Seemed she'd been running around with
some soldier, and Barney blew his stack.

748
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:25,712
- He got tanked up and exploded.
- Is Mary Pilant local?

749
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:29,842
No, she's a Canadian. Barney brought her
in here to sort of dress up the place...

750
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:31,927
and she stayed on to manage it for him.

751
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:34,117
Looks like she's
done all right.

752
00:49:34,118 --> 00:49:36,223
Better than all right.
She's in for the estate.

753
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,977
Oh? She doesn't look like
a bad sort, does she?

754
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:43,730
- Hmm? Where?
- What do you mean, where?

755
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:47,109
- The pretty one with the menus.
- This girl right here?

756
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:55,450
Uh, Miss Pilant, may I introduce myself?

757
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:57,911
I'm Paul Biegler,
attorney for Lieutenant Manion.

758
00:49:57,996 --> 00:50:00,080
This is Mrs. Rutledge
and Mr. McCarthy, my associates.

759
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:01,666
How do you do?

760
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:03,167
I wonder if you could
sit with us for a minute?

761
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:05,752
- Yes, I can take a minute.
- Thank you.

762
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:10,674
I'd like to ask you a few things,
if you don't mind.

763
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,093
What sort of things, Mr. Biegler?

764
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:16,722
Well, like what kind of a man
your employer was, Mr. Quill.

765
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:18,348
A very nice man.

766
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:22,186
If that's true, how do you explain what
happened with Lieutenant Manion's wife?

767
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,272
I don't know what happened
with Lieutenant Manion's wife...

768
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,983
so there really isn't anything
for me to explain, is there?

769
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:31,278
Your loyalty to the dead Mr. Quill
is very touching, Miss Pilant.

770
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,947
Barney was well liked here
by everyone, Mr. Biegler.

771
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:36,284
It was very generous of
everyone to overlook his

772
00:50:36,285 --> 00:50:38,535
little faults, like
raping other men's wives.

773
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:41,830
If you'll pardon me...

774
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:44,625
the waitress will take your order
when you're ready.

775
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:49,254
Nice to have met you, Mr. Biegler,
Mr. McCarthy, Mrs. Rutledge.

776
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:54,218
You've just been ginned, Lieutenant.

777
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:58,388
- Ten, twenty...
- [Sulo] Manion.

778
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:04,645
- Any word, Lieutenant?
- Yeah.

779
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:07,606
Uh, this. From Washington.

780
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,609
They'll let a doctor come to testify,
but there's a string on it.

781
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:14,446
They want me to go to an army hospital
in Detroit for an examination.

782
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,492
Doesn't the army understand you're in jail
on a non-bailable offense?

783
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,494
That's it, as far as the army's concerned.

784
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,580
I don't know how I can get around this.
I'll try and think of something.

785
00:51:23,665 --> 00:51:25,312
Look. My wife hasn't
been here for two days.

786
00:51:25,313 --> 00:51:26,959
Have you seen her?

787
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:29,753
- No, not for a while.
- Where the hell is she?

788
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:32,047
You've got other things
to worry about, Lieutenant.

789
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:35,050
Now, I'll get in touch with your wife.
I'll tell her you miss her.

790
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,094
Yeah. You tell her that.

791
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,889
- Thanks, Sulo.
- Okay, Polly.

792
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:47,187
I know just how you feel, Lieutenant.

793
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:51,191
I'd be tearin' my hair out too
if I had something like that outside.

794
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:56,863
- Something like what outside?
- Man, you know what I mean.

795
00:51:56,948 --> 00:52:00,242
Something like that,
running around on the loose.

796
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:03,704
[Shouts, Groans]

797
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,125
Now, what's the big noise, buckoes?

798
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,171
It's me, dummy.
I hit my elbow on this lousy iron bar.

799
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:16,383
Oh. You want some rubbing alcohol, maybe?

800
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,136
Nah. But a little bourbon might help.

801
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,557
- [Men Laugh]
- Knock it off. Knock it off, buckoes.

802
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,642
Let's finish the game, Lieutenant.

803
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:30,147
## [Jazz]

804
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,459
## [Continues]

805
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:58,842
Oh! Hey!
What a crazy lawyer we've got.

806
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:02,220
Hiya, Polly.
That's what they call you, isn't it? Polly?

807
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:05,474
That's a crazy name for a crazy lawyer!

808
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:15,776
Thanks for letting me sit in, Pie-Eye.

809
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,278
- Hey, you're not splittin' the scene, man?
- Huh?

810
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:21,156
- I mean, you're not cuttin' out?
- No, I'll be back.

811
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,345
Well, hi, Polly.
Fellas, this is Manny's lawyer.

812
00:53:42,346 --> 00:53:43,804
Hi.

813
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,597
- How are ya?
- Sit down, won't you?

814
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:50,310
Sorry, I can't right now. Mrs. Manion,
may I talk to you for a moment, outside?

815
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:53,980
"Mrs. Manion"? I thought
we dropped the formalities a long time ago.

816
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,441
I think maybe we'd better
pick them up again.

817
00:53:55,442 --> 00:53:56,817
This is important.

818
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:59,403
- All right. I'll go with you.
- All right, come on.

819
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:03,198
- Hey! You're coming back, aren't you?
- Sure. What do you think?

820
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:16,711
- See ya later, Pie-Eye.
- Okay.

821
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:27,806
- Did you get my phone message?
- Yeah, but I got busy.

822
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,808
Why haven't you been to see your husband?

823
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:32,060
I don't see why I have
to see him every day.

824
00:54:32,145 --> 00:54:34,396
I think it'd be a very
good idea if you did.

825
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,731
All right. I'll see him every day. Okay?

826
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:38,942
No, not okay. Now, where's your car?

827
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,298
I came with them.

828
00:54:40,299 --> 00:54:41,570
All right.
Mine's right over here. Come on.

829
00:54:41,654 --> 00:54:43,572
Hey, wait a second!
I've got friends inside.

830
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:46,491
- Friends or no friends, you're goin' home.
- Who do you think you are?

831
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:49,369
I'm the lawyer trying to beat a rap
for your husband! Do you remember?

832
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:52,456
- What's that got to do with...
- Wait. Now, you listen. You listen.

833
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,459
Now, until this trial is over, you're
gonna be a meek little housewife...

834
00:54:55,543 --> 00:55:00,130
with horn-rimmed spectacles, and you're
gonna stay away from men and juke joints...

835
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,549
and booze and pinball machines...

836
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,260
and you're gonna wear
a skirt and low-heeled shoes...

837
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:08,180
and you're gonna wear a girdle...
and especially a girdle.

838
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:10,579
Look, Laura, believe
me, I don't usually

839
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,893
complain of an attractive
jiggle, but just...

840
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:16,855
You save that jiggle for your husband to
look at, if and when I get him out of jail.

841
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,857
Now come on. Let's go.

842
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:22,277
I'm sorry. I really am.

843
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:24,529
I wouldn't hurt Manny's
chances for anything.

844
00:55:24,614 --> 00:55:26,531
Come on. Come on.

845
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:06,947
Is this about where
Barney knocked you down?

846
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:09,241
Yeah. Right over here.

847
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,243
Over there is the opening in the fence...

848
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:13,787
where Muffy was running
back and forth with the flashlight.

849
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:18,542
Where's your trailer?

850
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,086
Up there on the hill.

851
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,843
This is my favorite place.

852
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:37,769
Sometimes when Manny was sleeping,
I'd come out here and just sit.

853
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,730
I had to get out
of that trailer.

854
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:41,606
I couldn't stand being
cooped up all the time.

855
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,987
I'm... I'm lonely, Paul.

856
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,114
I'm awful lonely.

857
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:52,867
I wouldn't have gone to that roadhouse
if it weren't for that, you know.

858
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:56,246
Maybe you're getting in
some good practice being lonely.

859
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:59,249
You mean you think
maybe Manny won't get off?

860
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:02,544
That'll be up to the jury,
and you can never tell about them.

861
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:05,171
If he didn't, it'd be one way to end it.

862
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:09,092
No. I don't mean that.
I... I may think it sometimes...

863
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:11,553
but I don't really want it.

864
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,108
[Muff Barks]

865
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:28,403
Hello, sweetie. Did ya miss me?

866
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,447
Of course you missed me.

867
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,201
You wanna come in, Paul?

868
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:37,621
You can if you want to, you know.

869
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:41,291
No, thank you, Laura.

870
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:45,337
I'm sorry I had to spoil
your fun over at that place. I...

871
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:50,300
- Good night, Laura.
- Good night.

872
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,121
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

873
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:25,126
The Circuit Court for the County
of Iron Cliffs is now in session.

874
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:27,170
You can be seated.

875
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:36,513
For those of you I haven't met,
my name is Weaver.

876
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:38,932
I'm from downstate,
and I'm sitting

877
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:41,267
temporarily while your
good Judge Maitland...

878
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:43,937
is recovering from a severe illness.

879
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:47,315
There's no need, I think,
to dwell at length upon my methods.

880
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,026
One judge is quite like another.

881
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:53,947
The only differences may be in the state
of their digestions...

882
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,409
or their proclivities
for sleeping on the bench.

883
00:58:57,493 --> 00:59:00,870
For myself, I can digest pig iron.

884
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,415
And while I might appear
to doze occasionally,

885
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:05,875
you'll find that I'm
easily awakened...

886
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:11,256
particularly if shaken gently
by a good lawyer with a nice point of law.

887
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:16,761
We will now take up the criminal docket.
Case number one.

888
00:59:16,846 --> 00:59:19,931
The People versus Clarence Madigan.

889
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,809
Breaking and entering in the nighttime.

890
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,979
Will the defendant rise and come forward?

891
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,022
That's me, Your Honor.

I, Mitchell Lodwick,

894
00:59:40,578 --> 00:59:43,538

and give the court to understand...

alias 'One-Shot' Madigan,
alias 'Smoky' Madigan...

00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,337

the dwelling house of Casper Katz...

898
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:54,340
and did there commit the felony
of larceny on said premises."

899
00:59:55,426 --> 00:59:58,428
Does Mr. Madigan have an attorney?

900
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:02,307
Oh, no. A man's gotta have money
to ask them fellas the time of day.

901
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,934
Mr. Madigan, if you're impoverished,
it's my duty...

902
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:07,520
to appoint an attorney on your behalf.

903
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:11,191
Oh, I wouldn't bother, Your Honor.
I stole the whiskey.

904
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,151
I'm guilty as hell.

905
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,528
It was a full case of expensive bourbon,
Your Honor.

906
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:18,865
- Did you sell this whiskey?
- Oh, no. I drank it.

907
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,742
- All of it?
- You bet, Judge.

908
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:24,162
Are you aware that it will be necessary
to punish you for this crime?

909
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:26,206
It was worth it, Your Honor.

910
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,375
Well, I'll accept your plea
of guilty, Mr. Madigan.

911
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,460
You'll be sentenced later.

912
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:33,838
- You may now return to your place.
- Thanks, Your Honor.

913
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:40,720
Case number two.
The People versus Frederick Manion.

914
01:00:40,805 --> 01:00:42,972
The charge: murder.

915
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:47,685
Paul Biegler for the defendant.
My formal appearance is already on file.

916
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:50,563
Which of these men is your client,
Mr. Biegler?

917
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:52,982
- None of them, Your Honor.
- Mr. Sheriff...

918
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:55,443
will you produce the prisoner?

919
01:00:55,528 --> 01:00:59,072
Well, I... I'm afraid I can't do that,
Your Honor.

920
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:02,492
Perhaps someone should explain.
I'm not clairvoyant.

921
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:06,830
The defendant is in Detroit being examined
by a psychiatrist, Your Honor.

922
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:08,873
Shouldn't the court have been consulted...

923
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:11,918
before the defendant
was allowed to leave its jurisdiction?

924
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,879
Well, Your Honor, we're dealing
with the army in this matter...

925
01:01:14,964 --> 01:01:18,258
and this was the only crack the army would
give us at one of their psychiatrists.

926
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:20,426
The court was not present,
and it was very urgent...

927
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:23,096
that we get the defendant
to the psychiatrist.

928
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,515
What does the attorney
for the People say to this?

929
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,350
It was done with my knowledge, Your Honor.

930
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:32,438
I've always heard that this Upper Peninsula
of our fair state was a queer place.

931
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:34,983
If it's customary here to
allow a man charged with

932
01:01:34,984 --> 01:01:37,443
first-degree murder to
wander about at will...

933
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:41,197
I don't suppose it behooves
an outsider to point out...

934
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:45,326
that the law makes no provision
for such quaint liberalism.

935
01:01:45,411 --> 01:01:47,809
Your Honor, the defendant
is in the care of a

936
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:50,206
deputy and will be
returned this afternoon.

937
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:53,960
We'll formally arraign
the defendant on his return.

938
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:57,463
For the sake of the docket,
can you give me a clue as to his plea?

939
01:01:57,548 --> 01:02:00,758
The defendant will waive reading
of the information and stand mute.

940
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:03,303
A plea of not guilty will be entered.

941
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:08,141
The case of Frederick Manion
will be placed first on the trial docket.

942
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:21,029
Can you hurry it up, Polly?
Somebody tells that judge...

943
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:22,969
the prisoner was
lounging around the rail

944
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:24,824
road station, he'll
really give me the works.

945
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:26,701
- Just take a minute, Sheriff.
- Okay.

946
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:29,037
Thank you. Come on over here.

947
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:34,709
Well, Lieutenant, how'd things turn out?

948
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:37,170
- I was temporarily insane.
- Did he tell you that?

949
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:40,465
Yeah. Said he's gonna write you a letter...

950
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:43,343
but, uh, I took some notes on my own.

951
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,803
- Doctor's name is Smith.
- Smith.

952
01:02:45,888 --> 01:02:50,183
Anatole Ludwig Smith
or, uh, Ludwig von Smith, I hope.

953
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:53,436
- A name like that would impress the jury.
- No, just plain Matthew Smith.

954
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:58,441
He said that when I shot Quill, I was
suffering from "dissociative reaction."

955
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:02,445
Dissociative reaction.
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it, Parn?

956
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:05,323
- Yeah. What does it mean in plain English?
- Well, it means I had...

957
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:08,576
"an irresistible impulse to shoot Quill."

958
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,956
That's okay, isn't it?

959
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,375
Yeah, but what did he say
about your knowing the difference...

960
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:17,543
between right and wrong
when you shot Quill?

961
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:20,421
I don't think he said anything.
Why? Is that important?

962
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:24,133
We better not keep the sheriff waiting.
You better go.

963
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:32,475
[McCarthy] Thank you, Sheriff.

964
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,907
You ever heard of a Michigan court
accepting irresistible impulse as insanity?

965
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:51,244
No. Maybe we better switch to self-defense.

966
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,663
Even Mitch Lodwick would make
a monkey out of us on that.

967
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:56,416
[Belches] Damn strawberry soda.

968
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,835
- Here. Want a peanut?
- No, thanks.

969
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,796
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.

970
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,382
We just have the weekend before the trial.

971
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:08,678
- When do you want to start working?
- Tomorrow morning, early.

972
01:04:12,266 --> 01:04:14,434
[Bell Tolling]

973
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:47,967
[Clatter]

974
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:06,402
- Polly!
- Hey, listen to this, Parn.

975
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:09,238
Never mind that. Just find...

976
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:15,161
People versus Durfee,
62 Michigan, 486. Year 1886.

977
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,497
Yeah, that's it.
I have it right here in the A.L.R.

978
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:21,584
Listen. "The right-and-wrong test,
though condemned as being unscientific...

979
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:23,628
is adhered to by most
of the states, but"...

980
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:28,007
Listen to this "but." "But the fact
that one accused of committing a crime...

981
01:05:28,092 --> 01:05:33,012
may have been able to comprehend the
nature and the consequences of this act...

982
01:05:33,097 --> 01:05:36,390
and to know that it was
wrong, nevertheless"...

983
01:05:36,475 --> 01:05:39,352
Dear, sweet, endearing
word, "nevertheless"!

984
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:44,857
"Nevertheless, if he was forced
to its execution by an impulse...

985
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:47,985
by an impulse which he was
powerless to control...

986
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:50,696
he will be excused from punishment."

987
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:54,408
Why, the Michigan Supreme Court
did accept irresistible impulse, Parn.

988
01:05:54,493 --> 01:05:56,516
This is precedent.

989
01:05:56,517 --> 01:05:58,538
Boy, I think we got ahold
of something here.

990
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:01,207
Good old Durfee, 1886.

991
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,417
How about that? Give me a pad.

992
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,941
By the saints, this
strawberry soda pop is

993
01:06:05,942 --> 01:06:07,880
beginning to taste like
real bourbon whiskey.

994
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:11,551
Well, don't get drunk yet.
You know, we've got to convince a jury...

995
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:14,637
that our client was irresistibly impulsed.

996
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,305
Remember that.

997
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:19,934
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

998
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:23,729
before we proceed further, it will be
necessary for me to examine you...

999
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:27,650
on your qualifications to sit as jurors.

1000
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:30,319
Will you please remember
that you are under oath?

1001
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:32,947
Are all of you citizens?

1002
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,700
Will you please raise
your hand if you are not.

1003
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:53,551
Are there any justices of the peace
or law enforcement officers among you?

1004
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:55,803
[Jury] No.

1005
01:06:55,888 --> 01:07:00,808
Are any of you related by blood or marriage
to any law enforcement officer?

1006
01:07:00,893 --> 01:07:03,769
- [Jury] No.
- So much for qualifications.

1007
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:06,606
I will now examine for cause.

1008
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,817
Do any of you have any
business pending with

1009
01:07:08,818 --> 01:07:10,943
the prosecuting attorney,
Mitchell Lodwick?

1010
01:07:11,028 --> 01:07:12,904
[Jury] No.

1011
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:15,615
Do any of you have any
business pending with

1012
01:07:15,616 --> 01:07:18,242
Paul Biegler, attorney
for the defense?

1013
01:07:18,327 --> 01:07:19,619
No.

1014
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:22,079
Are any of you acquainted
with the defendant...

1015
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:24,749
sitting there on Mr. Biegler's left?

1016
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:27,627
- [Jury] No.
- Will Mrs. Laura Manion...

1017
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:29,921
the defendant's wife please stand?

1018
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:34,467
- Do any of you know Mrs. Manion?
- No.

1019
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:37,261
Thank you, Mrs. Manion.
You may be seated.

1020
01:07:38,305 --> 01:07:40,640
Counsel may challenge the jury for cause.

1021
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:46,270
Your Honor, before counsel's challenge, may
I introduce Mr. Claude Dancer to the court?

1022
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:49,440
Mr. Dancer is an assistant attorney general
from Lansing.

1023
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:51,609
Because of the peculiar
nature of this case,

1024
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,694
I have requested the
attorney general...

1025
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:56,239
to allow Mr. Dancer to sit in
with the prosecution.

1026
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:58,950
Your reputation precedes you, Mr. Dancer.

1027
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:01,327
It's a privilege to have you in my court.

1028
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:04,330
Thank you, Your Honor.
I'm sure it will be instructive.

1029
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:07,083
Do any of you jurors
have any business pending...

1030
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:09,168
before the attorney general's office?

1031
01:08:09,253 --> 01:08:10,753
No.

1032
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,757
I must apologize for my
disparaging remarks...

1033
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,635
about the Upper Peninsula and its customs.

1034
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:22,890
I've seldom seen a murder jury
selected and sworn in less than half a day.

1035
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:26,185
You have won my heart
completely, gentlemen.

1036
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:29,689
Now, Mr. Dancer, you asked for the recess.
What's your problem?

1037
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:32,608
There was a little suggestion
I wanted to make, Your Honor.

1038
01:08:32,693 --> 01:08:36,362
- By all means.
- Since the defense plea is insanity...

1039
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,698
the prosecution has
retained a psychiatrist.

1040
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:41,659
Under the statute, we have the right
to petition for a mental examination...

1041
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:43,828
of the defendant by our own doctor.

1042
01:08:43,912 --> 01:08:45,955
Are you familiar with that statute,
Mr. Biegler?

1043
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:48,207
Uh-huh. Moderately.

1044
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:50,793
I think it would only
delay things to file a formal petition...

1045
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:53,212
so why don't we just, uh,
get together and sort of...

1046
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:55,298
informally agree to ask His Honor
for an adjournment?

1047
01:08:55,382 --> 01:08:58,259
Only a day or so, and our doctor
can visit with the defendant.

1048
01:08:58,343 --> 01:08:59,844
I think it would save everyone
a great deal of time.

1049
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:01,345
Don't you, Mr. Biegler?

1050
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:03,389
- Yes, I'm sure it will.
- Good.

1051
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:08,227
But suppose you just go ahead
and file that formal petition anyway.

1052
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:10,313
Of course, you're a little late, aren't ya?

1053
01:09:10,397 --> 01:09:12,315
Well, maybe His Honor will overlook that.

1054
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,483
And then, I'd sort of
like the jury to see...

1055
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:17,194
that you think our insanity plea
has some merit.

1056
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,739
There really won't be any need for
our doctor to examine your client.

1057
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:21,741
Naturally, I was only following
the usual procedure.

1058
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:23,743
- Well, naturally, I'm all for it.
- Uh-huh.

1059
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:26,370
Do you wish to file the petition or not,
Mr. Dancer?

1060
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:28,205
- Yes, Your Honor...
- It won't be necessary.

1061
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:29,999
That's right. It won't be necessary at all.

1062
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:33,878
Skirmish over.
Shall we join now on the field of battle?

1063
01:09:37,758 --> 01:09:42,011
The body of Quill had sustained
five gunshot wounds.

1064
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:45,014
One of the bullets
had passed through the heart.

1065
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:48,768
Death, in my opinion,
was almost instantaneous...

1066
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:50,770
and was directly caused by this wound.

1067
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:52,877
Dr. Raschid, may I have
your detailed report?

1068
01:09:52,878 --> 01:09:54,899
Certainly.

1069
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:59,028
I ask that this report be marked
People's Exhibit One for identification.

1070
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:01,322
So received and marked.

1071
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:04,033
The People hand the defense
a copy of the report.

1072
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:06,619
Counsel may cross-examine.

1073
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:11,624
Dr. Raschid, your primary purpose was to
ascertain the cause of death, was it not?

1074
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:12,833
Yes.

1075
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:15,961
And yet, I read in your report here,
that you checked...

1076
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:18,506
to determine whether
spermatogenesis was occurring...

1077
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,966
in the body of the deceased
at the time of death.

1078
01:10:21,051 --> 01:10:25,888
Objection, Your Honor. The People call this
witness only to show the cause of death.

1079
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:28,599
Your Honor, the entire report
was offered as evidence...

1080
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:31,727
and the report contains this information
about spermatogenesis.

1081
01:10:31,812 --> 01:10:35,022
Overruled, Mr. Lodwick.
The witness may answer.

1082
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:38,651
Yes, I made that examination
on the deceased.

1083
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:41,737
Now, would you tell the
court your findings?

1084
01:10:41,822 --> 01:10:44,782
Spermatogenesis was occurring
at the time of death.

1085
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:49,370
In other words, the deceased, in life,
was not sterile. He could produce children.

1086
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:51,414
- That is correct.
- Now, Doctor...

1087
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:55,835
if a woman says that she has had
intercourse with a certain man...

1088
01:10:55,919 --> 01:11:00,005
and the man is proved fertile, even though
no evidence is found in the woman's body...

1089
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:02,383
could a lawyer...
say a prosecuting attorney...

1090
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:06,011
could he use this as evidence
that the woman is lying?

1091
01:11:06,096 --> 01:11:10,766
Your Honor.
I, uh, object to this line of questioning.

1092
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:12,935
We're not concerned here
with whether or not...

1093
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:15,438
there have been relations
between a man and a woman.

1094
01:11:15,522 --> 01:11:18,858
Your Honor, as long as an examination
for spermatogenesis has been made...

1095
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,693
at least we're entitled to know why.

1096
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,528
Overruled. You may answer.

1097
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:25,573
Yes. Prosecution could use that...

1098
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:29,201
though it certainly
would not be conclusive that she was lying.

1099
01:11:29,286 --> 01:11:31,954
- Why not?
- There could be several reasons...

1100
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,956
why the test on her was negative.

1101
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,084
The, uh, use of a contraceptive...

1102
01:11:37,169 --> 01:11:40,963
or... or possibly there was no completion
on the part of the man.

1103
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,883
Now, on this postmortem were you also asked
to determine whether or not...

1104
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:48,137
the deceased had reached
a sexual climax shortly before his death?

1105
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,764
- No, sir.
- Could you have made such a determination?

1106
01:11:50,849 --> 01:11:52,349
Oh, yes.

1107
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:55,144
So you were only asked
to make such examination...

1108
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:58,230
as might be useful to the prosecution,
none that might help the defense?

1109
01:11:58,315 --> 01:12:02,359
I object, Your Honor.
The question is argumentative.

1110
01:12:02,444 --> 01:12:04,987
Counsel for the defense
is trying to impugn the intent...

1111
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,989
of the representatives of the People.

1112
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:10,242
Mr. Biegler, you must be aware
that the question is improper.

1113
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:12,912
I withdraw the question, Your Honor,
and apologize.

1114
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:15,414
The question and answer will be stricken...

1115
01:12:15,499 --> 01:12:19,084
and the jury will disregard
both the question and the answer.

1116
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:22,755
- That's all the questions I had.
- No redirect.

1117
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:26,091
The People now call Lloyd Burke.

1118
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:28,802
[Bailiff]
Will the witness step forward, please.

1119
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:36,185
[Whispering] How can a jury disregard
what it's already heard?

1120
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:40,773
They can't, Lieutenant. They can't.

1121
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:44,276
...The whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1122
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:46,445
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

1123
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,615
Will you state your profession,
please, Mr. Burke?

1124
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:53,869
- I'm a commercial photographer.
- Were you called upon by the police...

1125
01:12:53,954 --> 01:12:57,790
to take photographs of the body
of the deceased Bernard Quill...

1126
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,751
before and after he was removed
from the scene of death?

1127
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:02,002
Yes, sir, I was.

1128
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:04,838
Were these photographs
of the deceased made by you?

1129
01:13:09,386 --> 01:13:11,387
They were.

1130
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:13,389
The reporter will please mark
these photographs...

1131
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:16,392
People's Exhibit 2A to
2D for identification.

1132
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:19,853
Photographs are tendered
to the defense for examination...

1133
01:13:19,938 --> 01:13:22,147
and the People move
their admission as evidence.

1134
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:24,984
- Your witness.
- Uh, no questions. No objections.

1135
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:27,444
Paul, he took pictures
of me that night too.

1136
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:29,863
Just a minute, Mr. Burke.

1137
01:13:29,948 --> 01:13:33,075
Uh, Mr. Burke...

1138
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,160
these photographs offered as evidence...

1139
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:37,913
are they the only photographs
you took that night?

1140
01:13:37,998 --> 01:13:39,999
Why, uh, no.

1141
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,251
I suppose the others didn't turn out.
ls that it?

1142
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,087
All my pictures turn out!

1143
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:48,048
- [Spectators Laugh]
- Oh, of course. I... I beg your pardon.

1144
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:50,843
Did you give the other
pictures to the police?

1145
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,846
- Yes, sir, I did.
- Well, Mr. Burke, what were they?

1146
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,600
Were they side shots,
or a shot of the moon, perhaps?

1147
01:13:57,684 --> 01:13:59,164
Or a black bear scavenging
the Thunder Bay dump?

1148
01:13:59,165 --> 01:14:00,644
[Spectators Laugh]

1149
01:14:00,729 --> 01:14:02,647
Your Honor, I object!

1150
01:14:02,648 --> 01:14:04,565
I can't see how other
photographs are relevant.

1151
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:06,567
The photographs in evidence
were introduced...

1152
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:09,361
to show that the deceased
met with a violent death.

1153
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:11,218
Well, Your Honor, I should
think any photograph

1154
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:12,990
pertaining to the case
would be relevant.

1155
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:15,951
The point is good, Mr. Biegler. Continue.

1156
01:14:16,036 --> 01:14:18,829
What were these other
photographs of, Mr. Burke?

1157
01:14:19,623 --> 01:14:21,332
Lieutenant Manion's wife.

1158
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:23,397
You mean these photographs
showed how she looked

1159
01:14:23,398 --> 01:14:25,377
that night after Barney
Quill was killed?

1160
01:14:25,462 --> 01:14:28,547
- Yes.
- Your Honor, how she looked is irrelevant.

1161
01:14:28,632 --> 01:14:30,425
No evidence has been
introduced to connect Mrs.

1162
01:14:30,426 --> 01:14:32,217
Manion's appearance to
a charge of murder.

1163
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:34,428
- [Judge Weaver] Sustained.
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

1164
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:37,765
I just wanted to make sure the prosecution
wasn't withholding evidence.

1165
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:39,767
Now look here!

1166
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:42,895
I protest to the defense attorney's
persistent attacks...

1167
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,397
on the motives of the prosecution.

1168
01:14:45,482 --> 01:14:50,152
The jury will disregard the remark
made by the attorney for the defense.

1169
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:54,573
There's no reason to believe that the
prosecution has not acted in good faith.

1170
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:57,701
My apologies to the prosecution,
and to the court.

1171
01:14:57,786 --> 01:15:01,497
But, Your Honor,
as long as protests are being made...

1172
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:03,749
I'd like to make a protest myself.

1173
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:09,088
Now, I'm perfectly willing to take on
these two legal giants anytime, anyplace...

1174
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:12,049
but in all fairness,
it ought to be one at a time.

1175
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:15,761
I don't want these two fellows pitching
knuckleballs at me at the same time.

1176
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:19,098
It seems to me you're batting
close to a thousand, Mr. Biegler...

1177
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:21,809
but your point is well taken.

1178
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:24,436
Whichever attorney opens
with the witness...

1179
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:29,191
he alone shall continue with that witness
until the witness is excused.

1180
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,402
Thank you, Your Honor. No more questions.

1181
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:33,404
No questions.

1182
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:46,959
- My, we're drawing well, aren't we?
- Where's Parnell?

1183
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:49,086
Parnell? Why? Isn't he here?

1184
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:52,297
No, he's not here. He's not in his rooming
house, and he hasn't been there all night.

1185
01:15:52,382 --> 01:15:54,299
You were the last to see him. Where is he?

1186
01:15:54,384 --> 01:15:56,301
I promised not to tell, so don't ask me.

1187
01:15:56,386 --> 01:16:00,055
- Aw, he hasn't fallen off the wagon?
- No. He was sober.

1188
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:02,058
Has he gone somewhere?

1189
01:16:02,059 --> 01:16:03,976
He did borrow my car
for something or other.

1190
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:07,062
Your car? That was smart.
He hasn't driven a car in 20 years.

1191
01:16:07,147 --> 01:16:09,189
He'll kill himself. Now where's he gone?

1192
01:16:09,274 --> 01:16:11,316
My word is my bond.

1193
01:16:18,742 --> 01:16:21,201
## [Humming]

1194
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,552
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

1195
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:40,512
- [Jury] Good morning.
- You may proceed.

1196
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:43,182
Your Honor, the, uh...

1197
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:47,019
the defense notices a third person
at the prosecution's table.

1198
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:50,314
We were wondering if the court
shares our curiosity as to just who he is.

1199
01:16:50,398 --> 01:16:52,316
I was about to introduce him.

1200
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,320
Your Honor, this gentleman
is Dr. W. Gregory Harcourt.

1201
01:16:56,404 --> 01:17:00,365
Dr. Harcourt is the People's psychiatrist
in this case.

1202
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:05,037
We ask that Dr. Harcourt be allowed
to sit at our table as an observer.

1203
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,831
What are you gonna have him observe?
The constellation of Taurus...

1204
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:10,292
- or the life and times of a bumblebee?
- [Laughter]

1205
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:12,294
To observe the defendant, of course.

1206
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,630
Oh! Oh, well, that's fine. That's fine.

1207
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:18,509
The defense has no objection, Your Honor.
I just wish to express my relief...

1208
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:23,889
that the new recruit is not additional
legal reinforcements from Lansing.

1209
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,308
- [Spectators Chuckle]
- [Lodwick] Call Alphonse Paquette.

1210
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:34,441
Raise your right hand, please.

1211
01:17:34,526 --> 01:17:37,069
You do solemnly swear that the testimony
you shall give in this cause...

1212
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:40,906
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1213
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,908
- [Paquette] I do.
- Take a seat, please.

1214
01:17:45,662 --> 01:17:49,164
- Will you state your name, please.
- Alphonse Paquette.

1215
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:51,875
You work at the Thunder Bay Inn,
don't you, Mr. Paquette?

1216
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,418
I'm bartender there.

1217
01:17:53,503 --> 01:17:56,797
Were you working on the night that Barney
Quill was shot by Frederick Manion?

1218
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:59,258
- I was.
- Were you witness to the shooting?

1219
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:00,467
I was.

1220
01:18:00,552 --> 01:18:03,512
Will you tell us in your own words,
please, what happened?

1221
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:07,933
I was at a table by the door
when Lieutenant Manion came in.

1222
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,310
Did you know Lieutenant Manion
by sight and by name?

1223
01:18:10,395 --> 01:18:12,855
- Yes, sir.
- Go ahead.

1224
01:18:12,939 --> 01:18:15,274
Well, he came in
and walked over to the bar...

1225
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:17,693
and began to shoot.

1226
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:21,029
He shot Barney when he came up to the bar,
and when Barney fell...

1227
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:24,032
he kept on shooting down at Barney,
behind the bar.

1228
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:26,034
Then he turned around and walked out.

1229
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:30,414
When Lieutenant Manion entered the bar,
how did he appear to you?

1230
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:33,000
Well, he walked slow.

1231
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:35,335
Kind of deliberate, I guess you could say.

1232
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:38,797
- Did he speak to Barney Quill?
- Not a word.

1233
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:42,384
Just walked over and pulled out
his gun, and bang.

1234
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:45,637
- And then he walked out.
- Yes.

1235
01:18:45,722 --> 01:18:48,932
When he walked out, how
did he appear to you?

1236
01:18:49,017 --> 01:18:51,518
He seemed just like he
did when he walked in.

1237
01:18:51,603 --> 01:18:53,812
Like he was the mailman
delivering the mail.

1238
01:18:53,897 --> 01:18:57,399
[Lodwick] When Lieutenant Manion
walked out of the bar, what did you do?

1239
01:18:57,483 --> 01:19:00,652
[Paquette] Well, it happened so fast,
I guess I was stunned.

1240
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:03,655
- But then I ran out after him.
- Did you find him outside?

1241
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:06,491
- Yes, sir. He was walking away.
- Did you speak to him?

1242
01:19:06,576 --> 01:19:10,829
Yes, sir. I said, uh, "Lieutenant,
you'd better not run away from this."

1243
01:19:10,914 --> 01:19:13,332
Did he reply to you?

1244
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:16,877
He said, "Do you want some too, buster?"

1245
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:19,004
Was he pointing the gun at you?

1246
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:22,841
Well, he was holding the gun in my
direction, but the muzzle was low.

1247
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:26,762
When he said,
"Do you want some too, buster?"

1248
01:19:26,846 --> 01:19:28,764
how was that expressed?

1249
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:31,934
Did he shout it? Was it hysterical?

1250
01:19:32,018 --> 01:19:35,854
- Was he hoarse? Did his voice tremble?
- No, sir.

1251
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:39,191
He just said it cool and hard
and looked right at me.

1252
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:42,361
Did he appear to you,
as far as you could tell...

1253
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:45,614
to be in complete possession
of his faculties?

1254
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:49,159
- Yes, sir, far as I could tell.
- Your witness.

1255
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:51,536
Mr. Paquette, did you see Laura Manion...

1256
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,872
the wife of Lieutenant Manion,
in the bar that night?

1257
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:57,209
Your Honor, there he goes again.
This is immaterial and irrelevant.

1258
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:59,253
Your Honor, I don't see
what the prosecution's

1259
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:01,213
so jumpy about.
I haven't gone anyplace yet.

1260
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:05,008
Well, let's see where he's going
before we start objecting, Mr. Lodwick.

1261
01:20:05,093 --> 01:20:07,219
You may proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1262
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:10,055
Well, did you see Mrs. Manion
in the bar that night?

1263
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:12,099
She was there.

1264
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,059
Did Barney Quill leave
the bar that night?

1265
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,561
- Yes.
- Do you remember when he returned?

1266
01:20:16,646 --> 01:20:18,563
I think he came back around midnight.

1267
01:20:18,648 --> 01:20:22,109
From which entrance did he come?
Did he come from the lobby entrance...

1268
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:24,945
or come from that...
that, uh, outside entrance?

1269
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:27,155
- It was from the lobby.
- Mm-hmm.

1270
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,699
And how did he appear
to you at that time?

1271
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,158
How do you mean?

1272
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:31,890
You understood the
prosecuting attorney very

1273
01:20:31,891 --> 01:20:33,537
well when he asked
you that question...

1274
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:35,539
about Lieutenant Manion's appearance.

1275
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:38,875
Oh, well, he was just
old Barney, like usual.

1276
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,213
You mean he was just
good old sober, reliable...

1277
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:45,195
gentle, salt-of-the-earth,
friend-to-man Barney?

1278
01:20:45,196 --> 01:20:47,092
Your Honor! Your Honor!

1279
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,094
Your Honor, what kind
of a question is that?

1280
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,263
I withdraw the question, Your Honor.

1281
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:55,017
Mr. Paquette...

1282
01:20:55,101 --> 01:20:58,770
had Barney changed his clothes
since he left the bar?

1283
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:00,063
I don't remember.

1284
01:21:00,148 --> 01:21:03,025
Might his clothing have been different
when he returned?

1285
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:05,861
That is, might he have changed his clothes?

1286
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:07,863
I couldn't say. I didn't notice.

1287
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:10,115
Was Barney drinking that night?

1288
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:14,619
Well, he... he always had a few shots
while he was talking to the customers.

1289
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:18,081
- He was friendly.
- Oh, sure he was. Sure. Good old Barney.

1290
01:21:18,166 --> 01:21:21,918
Well, now, how many shots would you say
good old Barney usually had?

1291
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:23,295
I don't know exactly.

1292
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:26,214
Wasn't he, in fact,
pretty loaded that night, Mr. Paquette?

1293
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:27,799
Objection, Your Honor.

1294
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:31,553
Even if the deceased was dead drunk,
it's no defense to this charge.

1295
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:34,931
Sustained.
I suggest you get off this, Mr. Biegler.

1296
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:40,604
Mr. Paquette, what would you call a man
with an insatiable penchant for women?

1297
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:43,523
- A what?
- A penchant.

1298
01:21:43,608 --> 01:21:46,151
A desire, uh, taste, passion.

1299
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:49,404
Well, a ladies' man, I guess.

1300
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:52,074
- Or maybe just a damn fool.
- [Spectators Laugh]

1301
01:21:53,201 --> 01:21:56,286
Just answer the questions, Mr. Paquette.

1302
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,914
The attorneys will provide the wisecracks.

1303
01:21:58,998 --> 01:22:02,918
Well... [Laughs] What else would you call
a man like that, Mr. Paquette?

1304
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:05,170
We can't see the drift of this, Your Honor.

1305
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,339
You mean you do see, Mr. Lodwick.

1306
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:09,258
You may answer.

1307
01:22:09,259 --> 01:22:11,093
Can you think of another
name, Mr. Paquette?

1308
01:22:11,803 --> 01:22:13,929
- Woman chaser.
- Try again.

1309
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:17,641
- Masher?
- Oh, now, come now, Mr. Paquette.

1310
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:20,811
Mashers went out with
whalebone corsets and hairnets.

1311
01:22:20,895 --> 01:22:23,188
- [Spectators Laugh]
- Did you ever hear the expression "wolf"?

1312
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,982
Well, sure, I heard that.
It just slipped my mind.

1313
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:28,151
It slipped your mind.
Well, naturally it would.

1314
01:22:28,236 --> 01:22:29,737
Clanking around in there with
all those rusty old mashers.

1315
01:22:29,738 --> 01:22:31,238
[Laughing]

1316
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:35,367
Have you ever known a man who you could
call a wolf, Mr. Paquette? - I'm not sure.

1317
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:38,120
- Was Barney Quill a wolf, Mr. Paquette?
- I couldn't say.

1318
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:40,038
- Or wouldn't?
- Objection.

1319
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:44,292
Sustained. The question was answered.
He said he couldn't say.

1320
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:50,215
Mr. Paquette, when Barney returned
from wherever he had gone...

1321
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,551
- did he relieve you at the bar?
- Yes.

1322
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:54,178
And what did he say to
you when he relieved you?

1323
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:55,720
Said, "I'll take over."

1324
01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:58,265
When you came out from behind the bar,
where did you go?

1325
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:02,144
I went over to the table
where the Pedersons were sitting.

1326
01:23:02,228 --> 01:23:06,064
Now, you testified that you were by the
door when Lieutenant Manion came in.

1327
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:09,234
Is that the reason you were by the door,
because the Pedersons' table was there?

1328
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:10,819
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

1329
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:13,822
And how long was it before
Lieutenant Manion came in?

1330
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:17,826
I don't know exactly.
Uh, maybe 30 minutes.

1331
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,453
And you remained
at the Pedersons' table all that time.

1332
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:24,958
- Yes, they're friends of mine.
- Is there also a window beside that table?

1333
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:26,960
- I think so.
- You think so.

1334
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:30,338
How long have you worked
at the Thunder Bay Inn, Mr. Paquette?

1335
01:23:30,423 --> 01:23:32,383
About six or seven years.

1336
01:23:32,384 --> 01:23:34,342
Well, now, does this
window beside the table...

1337
01:23:34,427 --> 01:23:37,929
does it suddenly vanish
and then reappear...

1338
01:23:38,014 --> 01:23:39,931
and come and go in a ghostly fashion?

1339
01:23:40,016 --> 01:23:41,933
No, sir. It's there all the time.

1340
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:43,894
And while you were talking
to your friends there,

1341
01:23:43,895 --> 01:23:45,770
did you happen to look
out of the window?

1342
01:23:45,855 --> 01:23:48,023
- I might have.
- And when you looked out of the window...

1343
01:23:48,107 --> 01:23:50,066
were you looking for something special?

1344
01:23:50,151 --> 01:23:52,110
No. No, I wasn't looking for anything.

1345
01:23:52,195 --> 01:23:54,446
Didn't Barney Quill tell you
to go over to that window...

1346
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,656
and watch out for Lieutenant Manion?

1347
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:59,993
[Sighs]

1348
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:02,662
Did he tell you to look out
for Lieutenant Manion?

1349
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:05,207
He did not.

1350
01:24:06,334 --> 01:24:09,586
Mr. Paquette,
Barney was quite a marksman, wasn't he?

1351
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,547
With guns. He'd won a lot of prizes
for shooting, hadn't he?

1352
01:24:12,632 --> 01:24:16,134
- Yes.
- Did he keep any guns behind the bar?

1353
01:24:22,183 --> 01:24:24,100
Well, he might have.

1354
01:24:24,185 --> 01:24:26,145
Isn't it a fact that there
are three concealed

1355
01:24:26,146 --> 01:24:28,104
pistol racks behind the
bar, Mr. Paquette?

1356
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:31,983
Your Honor, the defendant's plea
is one of insanity, not self-defense.

1357
01:24:32,068 --> 01:24:35,987
I'm sure Mr. Biegler
hasn't forgotten that fact, Mr. Lodwick.

1358
01:24:36,072 --> 01:24:38,115
You may answer.

1359
01:24:38,116 --> 01:24:40,158
Are there concealed gun
racks behind the bar?

1360
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:41,243
Yes.

1361
01:24:41,327 --> 01:24:44,537
And how many people
know about these gun racks?

1362
01:24:44,622 --> 01:24:46,186
I couldn't say.

1363
01:24:46,187 --> 01:24:47,749
But isn't it a fact that
Barney, every once in a while...

1364
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:50,669
he'd take the guns out of these racks,
and twirling them on his fingers...

1365
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:53,672
he'd demonstrate his skill to the patrons?

1366
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:55,632
- Isn't it?
- I don't remember.

1367
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:57,968
Oh, now, come on. Try and remember.

1368
01:24:58,052 --> 01:25:01,805
- Did you ever see him do that yourself?
- Once or twice he did.

1369
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:05,392
- That's all, Mr. Paquette.
- [Lodwick] No further questions.

1370
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:09,104
- [Judge Weaver] The witness may step down.
- Call George Lemon.

1371
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:17,612
[Whispering]
Biegler's going off in all directions.

1372
01:25:17,697 --> 01:25:19,614
What's he getting at?

1373
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:22,575
[Bailiff]
Raise your right hand, please.

1374
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,578
I have a feeling he's
afraid of what we'll get at.

1375
01:25:24,579 --> 01:25:26,496
[Bailiff] ...shall
be the truth...

1376
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,457
Mr. Biegler's putting up
a smoke screen for some reason.

1377
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:31,793
- I do.
- Take a seat, please.

1378
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:37,257
- Will you state your name, please?
- George Lemon.

1379
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:39,217
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Lemon?

1380
01:25:39,302 --> 01:25:42,554
I'm caretaker of the tourist park
in Thunder Bay.

1381
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:44,556
I see the place is clean and orderly.

1382
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,142
I check people in,
check 'em out and lock the gate at night.

1383
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:50,520
And what is your authority
for these duties?

1384
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:55,900
I'm paid by Mastodon township, and I'm also
a deputy sheriff... just courtesy, sort of.

1385
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:59,404
Did you see Lieutenant Manion
on the night of the 15th?

1386
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:02,407
- The night Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes, sir.

1387
01:26:03,284 --> 01:26:05,285
Will you tell the court...

1388
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:10,415
about how and-and when
you saw Lieutenant Manion?

1389
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:13,543
About 1:00 a.m.,
a knock on my door waked me up.

1390
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:16,254
I went to the door,
and Lieutenant Manion was standing there.

1391
01:26:16,339 --> 01:26:21,176
He said, "You better take me, Mr. Lemon,
because I just shot Barney Quill."

1392
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:24,512
I told him to go back to his trailer
and that I would call the state police.

1393
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:28,433
How did Lieutenant Manion appear to
you when he asked you to take him?

1394
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:30,352
He said what he had to say
and did what I told him.

1395
01:26:30,353 --> 01:26:32,187
There wasn't any fuss.

1396
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:35,357
Did he appear to you to be,
as far as you could tell...

1397
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:38,109
in complete possession of his faculties?

1398
01:26:38,194 --> 01:26:40,362
As far as I could tell, yes, sir.

1399
01:26:42,031 --> 01:26:43,948
Take the witness.

1400
01:26:44,033 --> 01:26:47,452
Mr. Lemon,
did you go to the Manions' trailer?

1401
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:48,578
Yes, sir.

1402
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:50,580
Did you see Mrs. Manion at the trailer?

1403
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:53,625
- Yes, sir.
- What was her appearance?

1404
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:56,836
- She was a mess.
- [Spectators Laugh]

1405
01:26:56,921 --> 01:26:59,130
Objection.
No evidence has been introduced...

1406
01:26:59,215 --> 01:27:02,133
to make Mrs. Manion's appearance
relevant to this case.

1407
01:27:02,218 --> 01:27:05,762
Well, no evidence has been introduced to
make Barney Quill's appearance relevant...

1408
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:07,931
but you didn't object to the question then.

1409
01:27:08,015 --> 01:27:11,768
Is that because you know that Barney Quill
bathed and changed and cooled off...

1410
01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:14,396
after he raped and beat hell
out of this poor woman?

1411
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,857
Your Honor, everybody in this court
is being tried except Frederick Manion!

1412
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,568
I must protest...

1413
01:27:19,569 --> 01:27:21,152
Now listen! This is a
cross-examination in a murder case!

1414
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:24,239
It's not a high school debate!
What are you and Dancer trying to do?

1415
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:26,658
Railroad this soldier into the clink?

1416
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:29,411
Mr. Biegler,
you are an experienced attorney...

1417
01:27:29,495 --> 01:27:32,247
and you know better
than to make such an outburst.

1418
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:35,208
I will not tolerate
intemperance of this sort.

1419
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:38,545
If you once again try
the patience of this court...

1420
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:41,047
I shall hold you in contempt.

1421
01:27:42,258 --> 01:27:43,675
Sorry.

1422
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:46,344
Your Honor...

1423
01:27:46,429 --> 01:27:50,014
I apologize,
and it won't happen again.

1424
01:27:50,099 --> 01:27:54,811
The witness's answer will be stricken,
and the jury will disregard the answer.

1425
01:27:55,354 --> 01:27:59,107
- Now you may proceed, Mr. Biegler.
- Yes, sir.

1426
01:27:59,984 --> 01:28:01,943
Mr. Lemon...

1427
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:05,280
on the night when Lieutenant Manion
awakened you and turned himself in...

1428
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:07,282
had you been awakened before?

1429
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:08,867
Had anything else
disturbed your slumbers?

1430
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:10,368
No, sir.

1431
01:28:10,453 --> 01:28:14,873
- There were no soldiers singing?
- No, sir. Not in my park after 10:00.

1432
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:17,042
There were no women screaming?

1433
01:28:17,043 --> 01:28:19,127
Well, those screams
were down by the gate.

1434
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:20,837
Objection! Objection!

1435
01:28:20,921 --> 01:28:23,923
I see no reason for objecting yet,
Mr. Lodwick.

1436
01:28:24,008 --> 01:28:27,177
Tell us about those screams, Mr. Lemon.

1437
01:28:27,261 --> 01:28:28,992
I didn't hear 'em myself.

1438
01:28:28,993 --> 01:28:30,722
There were some tourists
from Ohio in the park...

1439
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:33,141
and they heard 'em
and told me about it the next day.

1440
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:37,270
- Now, Mr. Lodwick.
- This testimony is incompetent, hearsay...

1441
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:40,315
irrelevant, immaterial, inconclusive...

1442
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:42,817
- Yeah, well, that's too much for me.
- [Spectators Chuckle]

1443
01:28:42,902 --> 01:28:45,320
- The witness is yours, Mr. Lodwick.
- Huh?

1444
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:48,156
Oh, uh, uh, no questions.

1445
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:50,867
The witness may step down.

1446
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:53,661
- Call your next witness.
- Um...

1447
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:57,081
Detective Sergeant James Durgo.

1448
01:28:58,918 --> 01:29:01,169
- Hi, Polly.
- [Whispering] Hi, Jim. Come here.

1449
01:29:03,214 --> 01:29:06,007
As soon as we break,
you'd better phone that army psychiatrist.

1450
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,927
- Tell him to be here day after tomorrow.
- Will do.

1451
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:12,263
Will you please tell me
where Parnell has gone?

1452
01:29:12,348 --> 01:29:14,265
Won't do.

1453
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:15,975
You're fired.

1454
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:19,395
You can't fire me till you pay me.

1455
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,773
[Durgo] Detective Sergeant
James Durgo, state police.

1456
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:24,776
[Lodwick] Were you called to Thunder Bay
by Deputy Sheriff Lemon of Thunder Bay...

1457
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:27,195
on the night that Barney Quill
was shot and killed?

1458
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:31,282
Yes, sir, I was. My companion officer and I
were the first to be called in on the case.

1459
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:34,953
Sergeant Durgo, when you arrived
at the Manion trailer, who was there?

1460
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:37,372
Lieutenant Manion and his wife were there.

1461
01:29:37,456 --> 01:29:39,707
What did Lieutenant Manion say to you?

1462
01:29:40,793 --> 01:29:44,128
He said that his wife
had had some trouble with Barney Quill...

1463
01:29:44,213 --> 01:29:46,923
that he had gone to the tavern
and shot Quill.

1464
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:50,343
He asked us whether Quill was dead or not.
We told him he was.

1465
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:53,429
How did Lieutenant Manion
take this information?

1466
01:29:53,514 --> 01:29:57,183
- He didn't seem surprised.
- What did you do then, Sergeant Durgo?

1467
01:29:57,268 --> 01:29:59,185
I asked for the gun he'd used.

1468
01:29:59,270 --> 01:30:01,334
Did you take Lieutenant
Manion to the county

1469
01:30:01,335 --> 01:30:03,398
jail here in Iron City
on that same night?

1470
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:06,276
Yes, sir. We drove the lieutenant
down with his wife.

1471
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:11,322
On the drive to Iron City, did the
lieutenant talk further about the shooting?

1472
01:30:11,407 --> 01:30:15,159
He remarked that if he had the whole thing
to do over again, he'd still do it.

1473
01:30:15,244 --> 01:30:18,997
[Lodwick] During all this...
at the trailer, the drive to Iron City...

1474
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:20,957
how did Lieutenant Manion appear to you?

1475
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:25,587
He was very quiet most of the time.
Seemed clearheaded.

1476
01:30:25,671 --> 01:30:27,819
As far as you could tell,
would you say that he

1477
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:29,966
was in complete possession
of his faculties?

1478
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:32,760
- Seemed so to me.
- Your witness.

1479
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:35,243
Sergeant Durgo, you
testified that Lieutenant

1480
01:30:35,244 --> 01:30:37,640
Manion told you that he
shot Barney Quill...

1481
01:30:37,725 --> 01:30:42,061
after he learned that his wife
had had some trouble with Quill.

1482
01:30:42,146 --> 01:30:45,607
Now, were these the words
Lieutenant Manion used? "Some trouble"?

1483
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:48,026
No, sir. Those were my words, not his.

1484
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:51,029
And was it your notion
to come here and use your own words?

1485
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:53,031
No, sir. It was not.

1486
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:55,742
And was the suggestion to
call it "some trouble"

1487
01:30:55,743 --> 01:30:58,369
made by somebody here
in this courtroom?

1488
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,540
Yes, sir, it was.

1489
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:04,876
All right, Sergeant.
Now, would you tell the court...

1490
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,337
what words Lieutenant
Manion actually used...

1491
01:31:07,421 --> 01:31:09,631
to describe the trouble his wife had had?

1492
01:31:09,715 --> 01:31:12,383
Objection, Your Honor.
We've been over this before.

1493
01:31:12,468 --> 01:31:15,553
This information would not be relevant
to any issues before the court.

1494
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:17,555
This statement concerning some trouble...

1495
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:21,351
was brought out during
the direct examination of Sergeant Durgo.

1496
01:31:21,435 --> 01:31:24,083
Up to now you've
adroitly restricted all

1497
01:31:24,084 --> 01:31:26,731
testimony as far as Laura
Manion's concerned.

1498
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:30,318
All right. The cat's out of the bag.
It's fair game for me to chase it.

1499
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:33,488
This is a sore point, Mr. Biegler,
and it's getting sorer.

1500
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:35,490
I'd like to hear from the prosecution.

1501
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:38,055
The burden is on the
defense to prove temporary

1502
01:31:38,056 --> 01:31:40,536
insanity at the time
of the shooting.

1503
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:44,791
Now, if the reason for the alleged insanity
is important to this case...

1504
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:47,418
then that is a matter
for a competent witness...

1505
01:31:47,503 --> 01:31:50,296
an expert on the subject of the human mind.

1506
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:53,841
What the defense is trying to do...

1507
01:31:53,926 --> 01:31:56,761
is introduce some sensational material...

1508
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:59,514
for the purposes of
obscuring the real issues.

1509
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:05,603
Your Honor, how can the jury accurately
estimate the testimony being given here...

1510
01:32:05,688 --> 01:32:09,148
unless they first know
the reason behind this whole trial...

1511
01:32:09,233 --> 01:32:12,110
why Lieutenant Manion shot Barney Quill.

1512
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:16,280
Now, the prosecution would like to separate
the motive from the act.

1513
01:32:16,365 --> 01:32:21,285
Well, that's like trying to take the core
from an apple without breaking the skin.

1514
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:26,290
The core of our defense is that the
defendant's temporary insanity...

1515
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:29,669
was triggered by
this so-called trouble with Quill.

1516
01:32:29,753 --> 01:32:31,879
And I beg the court...

1517
01:32:31,964 --> 01:32:36,467
I beg the court
to let me cut into the apple.

1518
01:32:38,387 --> 01:32:40,763
Our objection still stands, Your Honor.

1519
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:57,155
Objection overruled.

1520
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:59,240
[Spectators Murmuring]

1521
01:33:03,704 --> 01:33:07,331
Sergeant Durgo, tell the court...

1522
01:33:07,416 --> 01:33:11,461
how Lieutenant Manion described
the trouble his wife had with Barney Quill.

1523
01:33:11,545 --> 01:33:14,964
He told us that Quill had raped his wife.

1524
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:19,469
Now, can you recall generally what
Lieutenant Manion told you about this rape?

1525
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:24,223
Yes, sir. He said he'd been asleep
since right after dinner.

1526
01:33:24,308 --> 01:33:28,394
That he was waked up by some noise.
Screams, he thought.

1527
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:32,064
That he got up, opened the trailer door
and went outside.

1528
01:33:32,608 --> 01:33:35,693
His wife came running
out of the dark and fell into his arms.

1529
01:33:35,778 --> 01:33:39,030
You saw his wife in the trailer.
How'd she look?

1530
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:42,200
She was a little hysterical.
She'd been pretty badly beaten up.

1531
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:45,077
She had big black bruises
over her face and her arms.

1532
01:33:45,162 --> 01:33:47,080
Did Mrs. Manion tell you
about this rape and beating?

1533
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:48,998
She did.

1534
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:50,896
And did she take you to the
place where it had happened?

1535
01:33:50,897 --> 01:33:52,668
Yes, sir. The next morning.

1536
01:33:52,753 --> 01:33:54,484
And did you find anything there?

1537
01:33:54,485 --> 01:33:56,214
Any sort of evidence
pertaining to the story...

1538
01:33:56,298 --> 01:33:58,716
that Mrs. Manion had told you?

1539
01:33:58,801 --> 01:34:03,554
On the lane in the woods we found
some tire tracks and some dog tracks...

1540
01:34:03,639 --> 01:34:07,350
and a leather case with some
horn-rimmed glasses inside.

1541
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:10,478
We also looked for...

1542
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:14,190
a certain undergarment of Mrs. Manion's,
but we didn't find it.

1543
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:17,068
Will the attorneys for both sides
approach the bench, please?

1544
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:25,159
[Whispering] Mr. Biegler,
you finally got your rape into the case...

1545
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:29,080
and I think all the details
should now be made clear to the jury.

1546
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:33,084
- Do you agree, Mr. Lodwick?
- Absolutely.

1547
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:36,546
What exactly was
the undergarment just referred to?

1548
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:38,339
Panties, Your Honor.

1549
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,279
Do you expect this
subject to come up again?

1550
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,134
Yes, sir.

1551
01:34:42,219 --> 01:34:46,556
There's a certain light connotation
attached to the word "panties."

1552
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,683
Can we find another name for them?

1553
01:34:48,767 --> 01:34:50,748
I never heard my wife
call 'em anything else.

1554
01:34:50,749 --> 01:34:52,728
Mr. Biegler?

1555
01:34:52,813 --> 01:34:57,608
- I'm a bachelor, Your Honor.
- That's a great help. Mr. Dancer?

1556
01:34:57,693 --> 01:35:02,530
When I was overseas during the war,
Your Honor, I... I learned a French word.

1557
01:35:02,614 --> 01:35:04,804
I'm afraid that it might
be slightly suggestive.

1558
01:35:04,805 --> 01:35:06,993
Most French words are.

1559
01:35:07,077 --> 01:35:10,121
All right, gentlemen. Back to your places.

1560
01:35:10,831 --> 01:35:15,501
For the benefit of the jury,
but more especially for the spectators...

1561
01:35:15,586 --> 01:35:19,380
the undergarment referred to
in the testimony was, to be exact...

1562
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:21,382
Mrs. Manion's panties.

1563
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:24,635
[Spectators Laughing]

1564
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:29,307
I wanted you to get your snickering
over and done with.

1565
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:33,644
This pair of panties will be mentioned
again in the course of this trial...

1566
01:35:33,729 --> 01:35:36,230
and when it happens,
there will not be one laugh...

1567
01:35:36,315 --> 01:35:38,232
one snicker, one giggle...

1568
01:35:38,317 --> 01:35:41,444
or even one smirk in my courtroom.

1569
01:35:41,528 --> 01:35:45,156
There isn't anything comic
about a pair of panties...

1570
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:48,659
which figure in the violent death
of one man...

1571
01:35:48,744 --> 01:35:52,330
and the possible incarceration of another.

1572
01:35:52,873 --> 01:35:54,916
Proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1573
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,334
Did you give Mrs. Manion
a lie detector test?

1574
01:35:56,335 --> 01:35:57,668
Objection.

1575
01:35:57,753 --> 01:36:00,546
A polygraph test is inadmissible evidence
in our courts.

1576
01:36:00,631 --> 01:36:04,050
I only asked if he gave the test.
I didn't ask the results.

1577
01:36:04,134 --> 01:36:06,135
[Judge Weaver]
He may answer that.

1578
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:09,221
I gave her a lie detector
test at her request.

1579
01:36:09,306 --> 01:36:13,601
After all this investigation, did
you believe Mrs. Manion? - I did.

1580
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:17,063
- Even after the lie detector test?
- Your Honor, I object to that question!

1581
01:36:17,147 --> 01:36:19,190
It constitutes flagrant,
sneaking subterfuge

1582
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:21,233
on the part of the
defense counsel.

1583
01:36:21,318 --> 01:36:25,029
Objection sustained.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1584
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:28,991
a polygraph or lie detector test
is not admissible in evidence...

1585
01:36:29,076 --> 01:36:31,452
because no one has ever been quite sure...

1586
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:35,498
that some people couldn't lie
to a lie detector and get away with it.

1587
01:36:35,582 --> 01:36:37,626
Go ahead, Mr. Biegler.

1588
01:36:37,627 --> 01:36:39,669
In any case, Sergeant
Durgo, you, yourself...

1589
01:36:39,753 --> 01:36:44,090
in your own heart and mind are quite
convinced of Mrs. Manion's honesty.

1590
01:36:44,174 --> 01:36:46,592
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

1591
01:36:48,095 --> 01:36:50,096
- Just a moment.
- [Whispering]

1592
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:51,681
Yes, of course.

1593
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:55,790
Sergeant Durgo, did you
look for the panties

1594
01:36:55,791 --> 01:36:58,229
elsewhere than the
lane in the woods?

1595
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:01,148
We looked in Barney Quill's car
and his room in the hotel.

1596
01:37:01,233 --> 01:37:03,192
We didn't find the panties.

1597
01:37:03,276 --> 01:37:06,696
Do you know why Mrs. Manion
requested a lie detector test?

1598
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:08,864
- I know what she said.
- What was that?

1599
01:37:08,949 --> 01:37:10,908
She said she wanted everybody
to believe her story...

1600
01:37:10,993 --> 01:37:12,910
because she knew it would
help her husband.

1601
01:37:12,995 --> 01:37:14,578
Was that the only reason she gave?

1602
01:37:14,663 --> 01:37:16,748
She said she'd already
sworn to her husband.

1603
01:37:16,749 --> 01:37:18,833
She wanted everybody
else to believe it too.

1604
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:21,085
One moment, please, Your Honor.

1605
01:37:24,715 --> 01:37:27,341
Ask him in what manner she swore.

1606
01:37:27,426 --> 01:37:30,678
Did Mrs. Manion say how
she had sworn to her husband?

1607
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:34,390
Yes, sir. She said she'd sworn on a rosary.

1608
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:39,186
Sergeant, this lane in the woods...
What's it used for? Where does it go?

1609
01:37:39,730 --> 01:37:42,857
Used to be a logging road.
Doesn't go anyplace. Just stops.

1610
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:44,859
Who uses it now?

1611
01:37:44,943 --> 01:37:46,861
I think it's a road
kids drive down to park.

1612
01:37:46,862 --> 01:37:48,779
You mean it's a lovers' lane.

1613
01:37:48,864 --> 01:37:51,449
- I think so. Yes, sir.
- The witness is yours, Mr. Biegler.

1614
01:37:51,533 --> 01:37:54,452
- No more questions.
- [Judge Weaver] The witness may step down.

1615
01:37:54,536 --> 01:37:58,706
In view of the evidence concerning rape
which Your Honor has ruled admissible...

1616
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:02,084
the prosecution asks for a 30-minute recess
in order that we may bring in...

1617
01:38:02,169 --> 01:38:04,295
another witness whom
we had not anticipated using.

1618
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:08,215
- All right. We'll take a 30-minute recess.
- Recess.

1619
01:38:15,432 --> 01:38:17,767
Why didn't you tell me about that rosary?

1620
01:38:19,061 --> 01:38:21,145
We forgot it.

1621
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:23,293
We didn't forget it.

1622
01:38:23,294 --> 01:38:25,357
Manny said maybe we
shouldn't tell that again.

1623
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:29,904
It might have looked like something else.
Like I-I didn't believe her.

1624
01:38:31,323 --> 01:38:33,240
How much more didn't you tell me?

1625
01:38:33,325 --> 01:38:36,494
Everything else.
We told you everything else.

1626
01:38:36,578 --> 01:38:38,496
Is that right, Laura?

1627
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:40,664
Oh, yes. Everything else.

1628
01:38:40,749 --> 01:38:43,000
All right. Now get this, both of ya.

1629
01:38:43,085 --> 01:38:46,295
When you get up on that stand,
I want you to tell the truth.

1630
01:38:47,005 --> 01:38:49,340
I don't want you to tell
anything but the truth.

1631
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:54,637
Don't try and lie. Don't try and conceal
anything, or you'll get skinned alive.

1632
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:56,889
This fellow Dancer's gonna move in.

1633
01:39:17,828 --> 01:39:21,372
[Dancer] Dr. Dompierre, did you have
occasion to come to the county jail...

1634
01:39:21,456 --> 01:39:23,916
on the night of August
the 15th of this year?

1635
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,544
- I did.
- Who called you to the jail?

1636
01:39:26,628 --> 01:39:30,089
- The police authorities.
- What did they want you to do?

1637
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:32,967
They wanted me to make a test
for the presence of sperm...

1638
01:39:33,051 --> 01:39:35,719
on the person of a Mrs. Frederick Manion.

1639
01:39:35,804 --> 01:39:37,681
I made the test.

1640
01:39:37,682 --> 01:39:39,557
In making this test,
what was your conclusion?

1641
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:42,935
- Negative. There was none.
- Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

1642
01:39:44,146 --> 01:39:46,063
Doctor, in making these tests...

1643
01:39:46,148 --> 01:39:48,899
did you notice any bruises or marks
on Mrs. Manion at that time?

1644
01:39:48,984 --> 01:39:50,192
I did.

1645
01:39:50,277 --> 01:39:52,611
Were you asked to determine the reason
for these bruises?

1646
01:39:52,696 --> 01:39:54,196
I was not.

1647
01:39:54,281 --> 01:39:57,199
Where did you do the laboratory work
on your test for sperm?

1648
01:39:57,284 --> 01:39:59,577
Saint Margaret's hospital in this city.

1649
01:39:59,661 --> 01:40:03,747
- Who worked up the slides for you?
- A technician at the hospital.

1650
01:40:03,832 --> 01:40:07,251
Well, wouldn't it have been better
to have these slides worked up...

1651
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:10,045
by a pathologist or an
expert in this field?

1652
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:12,631
Well, yes, but the police
were in a hurry...

1653
01:40:12,716 --> 01:40:15,759
and I happened to know this young fella
came on at 7:00 in the morning.

1654
01:40:15,844 --> 01:40:18,554
Wouldn't it have been especially better
to wait for the expert...

1655
01:40:18,638 --> 01:40:21,432
if the possible question of rape
hung on the result?

1656
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:24,059
- It would have been.
- Now, Doctor, in the newspaper...

1657
01:40:24,144 --> 01:40:28,063
on the evening of August the 16th, it was
stated that you found no evidence of rape.

1658
01:40:28,148 --> 01:40:31,525
- Is that true?
- It is not true. I made no such statement.

1659
01:40:31,610 --> 01:40:35,446
But did you form an opinion
as to whether Mrs. Manion had been raped?

1660
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:37,781
- No.
- Why didn't you form an opinion?

1661
01:40:37,866 --> 01:40:42,119
It's impossible to tell
if a mature, married woman has been raped.

1662
01:40:42,204 --> 01:40:44,663
- That's all.
- Doctor...

1663
01:40:44,748 --> 01:40:46,583
did you have an opinion
about whether or not

1664
01:40:46,584 --> 01:40:48,417
she'd had any recent
relations with a man?

1665
01:40:48,501 --> 01:40:51,212
Insofar as no sperm was present...

1666
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:54,256
it didn't appear that she had
had recent relations with a man.

1667
01:40:54,341 --> 01:40:57,009
- That's all.
- Just one more question, Doctor.

1668
01:40:57,093 --> 01:40:59,303
The fact that no evidence
was present in her body...

1669
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:01,639
does not mean that
she was not raped, does it?

1670
01:41:01,723 --> 01:41:03,224
No.

1671
01:41:03,308 --> 01:41:05,809
Do you know what constitutes rape
under the law?

1672
01:41:05,894 --> 01:41:07,353
Yes, sir.

1673
01:41:07,437 --> 01:41:09,647
Violation is sufficient for rape.

1674
01:41:09,731 --> 01:41:11,732
There need not be a completion.

1675
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:14,485
- No further questions.
- [Judge Weaver] The witness may step down.

1676
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:17,738
The People recall
Alphonse Paquette to the stand.

1677
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:21,784
Your Honor, since counsel for the defense
has forced the question of rape...

1678
01:41:21,868 --> 01:41:25,079
it becomes necessary to take this
additional testimony from Mr. Paquette.

1679
01:41:25,163 --> 01:41:27,456
You're still under oath, Mr. Paquette.

1680
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:29,541
Mr. Paquette...

1681
01:41:31,253 --> 01:41:34,421
would you take a look at Mrs. Manion,
seated there behind the defense table?

1682
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:36,674
Was she dressed in this manner
on the night of the shooting?

1683
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:38,592
- No.
- How was she dressed?

1684
01:41:38,677 --> 01:41:42,263
She had on a real tight skirt
and sweater kind of thing.

1685
01:41:42,347 --> 01:41:46,809
Sort of glued on. She was wearing
a pair of red shoes with high heels.

1686
01:41:46,893 --> 01:41:50,312
- Was she wearing hose?
- No. She was bare legged.

1687
01:41:50,397 --> 01:41:52,898
- Was she wearing a hat?
- No.

1688
01:41:52,983 --> 01:41:57,111
Um, Mr. Paquette, what kind of hair
does Mrs. Manion have under that hat?

1689
01:41:57,195 --> 01:42:00,489
Well, we'd be very happy
to show the court Mrs. Manion's hair.

1690
01:42:00,573 --> 01:42:04,034
Mrs. Manion, would you take off
your hat, please?

1691
01:42:04,119 --> 01:42:06,495
[Spectators Murmur]

1692
01:42:08,581 --> 01:42:10,666
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.

1693
01:42:11,293 --> 01:42:14,336
Mr. Paquette, was she wearing
glasses that night?

1694
01:42:14,963 --> 01:42:17,089
I think she was when she played pinball.

1695
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:21,927
Considering the tight skirt
and the tight sweater and the bare legs...

1696
01:42:22,012 --> 01:42:24,722
- what was the result in her appearance?
- Well...

1697
01:42:24,806 --> 01:42:29,393
Would you say that Mrs. Manion's appearance
was deliberately voluptuous and enticing?

1698
01:42:29,477 --> 01:42:31,395
You could pretty much
see everything she had.

1699
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:35,190
Your Honor, the defense will concede that
Mrs. Manion, when dressed informally...

1700
01:42:35,275 --> 01:42:37,735
is an astonishingly beautiful woman.

1701
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:40,654
And we... Well, Mrs. Manion,
stand up, please. Will you?

1702
01:42:40,739 --> 01:42:42,740
As a matter of fact...
Take your glasses off.

1703
01:42:42,824 --> 01:42:45,242
As a matter of fact,
it's pretty easy to understand...

1704
01:42:45,327 --> 01:42:47,494
why her husband
became temporarily deranged...

1705
01:42:47,579 --> 01:42:50,914
when he saw such beauty
bruised and torn by a beast.

1706
01:42:50,999 --> 01:42:53,250
Your Honor, I protest.

1707
01:42:53,335 --> 01:42:55,336
Mr. Biegler is perhaps
the least disciplined...

1708
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:58,839
and the most completely out-of-order
attorney I've ever seen in a courtroom.

1709
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:01,717
The jury will ignore Mr. Biegler's oration.

1710
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:08,015
Uh, was Mrs. Manion drinking
heavily that night?

1711
01:43:08,683 --> 01:43:12,603
I sold her six drinks myself, and then
Barney came over and got some more for her.

1712
01:43:12,687 --> 01:43:15,522
- I don't remember how many.
- Would you say that she was tight?

1713
01:43:15,607 --> 01:43:17,192
Oh, she was high, all right.

1714
01:43:17,193 --> 01:43:18,776
What did she do to make
you think she was high?

1715
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:21,987
[Paquette] Well, she took off
her shoes and went barefooted, and...

1716
01:43:22,072 --> 01:43:26,116
when she played pinball she'd kind of
swish around to give the machine English.

1717
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:28,495
You mean she was
flipping her hips around.

1718
01:43:28,496 --> 01:43:30,788
Yeah.

1719
01:43:30,872 --> 01:43:32,790
Anything else?

1720
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:34,917
Well, when she made a
good score, she jumped

1721
01:43:34,918 --> 01:43:36,960
up and down and
squealed like women do.

1722
01:43:37,045 --> 01:43:40,756
[Chuckles] She was playing pinball
with Barney Quill that night, wasn't she?

1723
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:41,987
Yes, sir.

1724
01:43:41,988 --> 01:43:43,133
What was her attitude
toward Barney Quill?

1725
01:43:43,218 --> 01:43:45,135
Friendly, I guess you could call it.

1726
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:47,137
- More than friendly, would you say?
- I thought so.

1727
01:43:47,222 --> 01:43:49,223
[Dancer] Why did you think so?

1728
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:52,581
Well, she...
she'd kind of lean on him, and a

1729
01:43:52,582 --> 01:43:55,062
couple of times she
bumped him with her hip.

1730
01:43:56,689 --> 01:44:00,818
Uh, would you say that Mrs. Manion
was making a play for Barney Quill?

1731
01:44:01,403 --> 01:44:04,655
Objection. That calls for an assumption
on the part of the witness, Your Honor.

1732
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:07,032
I withdraw the question.
Would you say that, uh...

1733
01:44:07,117 --> 01:44:09,827
Mrs. Manion was free and easy
with Barney Quill?

1734
01:44:09,911 --> 01:44:12,079
- I would.
- Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

1735
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:15,374
Mr. Paquette,
the attorney for the People asked you...

1736
01:44:15,458 --> 01:44:20,129
if Mrs. Manion was tight,
and you said that she was high.

1737
01:44:20,213 --> 01:44:24,258
Now, speaking as a bartender,
what's the distinction between the two?

1738
01:44:24,342 --> 01:44:27,302
- I don't think I understand.
- Well, I mean...

1739
01:44:27,387 --> 01:44:29,535
when we say a person's
tight, we usually mean

1740
01:44:29,536 --> 01:44:31,682
that they're a little
stupid with the drink.

1741
01:44:31,766 --> 01:44:34,768
- Isn't that so?
- I guess that's about it. Yes.

1742
01:44:34,853 --> 01:44:38,105
And if they're high,
they're gay and enjoying themselves.

1743
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:41,358
- Yes.
- In other words, Mrs. Manion was happy.

1744
01:44:41,443 --> 01:44:44,445
Well, now, is there anything wrong
with being happy in Thunder Bay Inn?

1745
01:44:44,529 --> 01:44:48,407
- No.
- Thunder Bay itself is a resort, isn't it?

1746
01:44:48,491 --> 01:44:51,577
- Swimming, fishing, that sort of thing?
- Yes.

1747
01:44:51,661 --> 01:44:55,080
Is there anything unusual about
seeing a barefooted woman in Thunder Bay?

1748
01:44:55,165 --> 01:44:56,937
No.

1749
01:44:56,938 --> 01:44:58,709
So Mrs. Manion's taking her
shoes off in Thunder Bay...

1750
01:44:58,793 --> 01:45:01,712
that doesn't necessarily mean
that she was being unladylike, does it?

1751
01:45:01,796 --> 01:45:03,714
- I guess not.
- Yes or no?

1752
01:45:03,798 --> 01:45:05,299
No!

1753
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:09,720
Now, you testified...

1754
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:14,057
that Mrs. Manion was squealing
and jumping up and down and...

1755
01:45:15,018 --> 01:45:17,769
and swishing her...
I think that was the expression you used...

1756
01:45:17,854 --> 01:45:19,938
swishing her hips
around the pinball machine.

1757
01:45:20,023 --> 01:45:23,525
Now, was she creating a disturbance?
Was she attracting a crowd?

1758
01:45:23,610 --> 01:45:25,527
- No.
- Were all the men at the bar...

1759
01:45:25,612 --> 01:45:27,529
Were they all standing around
watching Mrs. Manion?

1760
01:45:27,614 --> 01:45:28,698
No.

1761
01:45:28,699 --> 01:45:29,781
But you were very
conscious of Mrs. Manion.

1762
01:45:29,866 --> 01:45:32,784
You were conscious enough so that you
can tell us all about her actions.

1763
01:45:32,869 --> 01:45:35,621
Yes. - And certainly Barney Quill,
he was conscious of Mrs. Manion...

1764
01:45:35,705 --> 01:45:38,582
because he was playing pinball
with Mrs. Manion, wouldn't you say so?

1765
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:40,313
Yes.

1766
01:45:40,314 --> 01:45:41,960
So it seems that only
you and Barney Quill...

1767
01:45:42,045 --> 01:45:46,089
were acutely aware of Mrs. Manion
and her actions and her appearance.

1768
01:45:46,174 --> 01:45:48,967
And maybe good old Barney, when he
came up to get some drinks from you...

1769
01:45:49,052 --> 01:45:53,722
maybe he winked and said, "Alphonse,
I'm gonna take this babe out and rape her."

1770
01:45:53,806 --> 01:45:55,558
No! No, he didn't.

1771
01:45:55,559 --> 01:45:57,309
Yeah, and maybe you said,
"Do it once for me, boss!"

1772
01:45:57,393 --> 01:45:58,915
[Dancer] Objection, objection.

1773
01:45:58,916 --> 01:46:00,437
Those are not questions.
Counsel is attacking...

1774
01:46:00,522 --> 01:46:02,689
- No more questions!
- [Gavel Rapping]

1775
01:46:02,774 --> 01:46:06,777
The court's had about all of this dogfight
it can take for one day...

1776
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:10,364
and I'm sure the jury
is equally tired and hungry.

1777
01:46:10,448 --> 01:46:14,243
Tomorrow the defense takes over,
and with expedition, prayer...

1778
01:46:14,327 --> 01:46:16,787
and a little self-discipline
on the part of counsel...

1779
01:46:16,871 --> 01:46:19,581
perhaps we can reach an end
by Saturday night.

1780
01:46:19,666 --> 01:46:22,543
- Will you adjourn court?
- [Gavel Raps]

1781
01:46:22,627 --> 01:46:25,171
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.
This court stands

1782
01:46:25,172 --> 01:46:27,714
adjourned until 9:00
tomorrow morning.

1783
01:46:45,567 --> 01:46:48,735
[Horn Honking]

1784
01:47:08,423 --> 01:47:11,925
He's banged up a little,
but there doesn't seem to be anything else.

1785
01:47:12,010 --> 01:47:14,052
We'd like to watch him for a day or so.

1786
01:47:14,721 --> 01:47:18,890
- How much damage did he do?
- Wrecked a gate and a barn door.

1787
01:47:20,184 --> 01:47:22,603
And he hasn't got a driver's license.

1788
01:47:23,646 --> 01:47:27,399
He'll have to appear
in the J.P. court when he's able.

1789
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:31,486
- The old fool.
- Speak kindly of the dead.

1790
01:47:31,571 --> 01:47:33,030
Do you mind if I have a
minute with the corpse?

1791
01:47:33,031 --> 01:47:34,489
Sure, Polly.

1792
01:47:38,786 --> 01:47:41,705
Now, was it worth trying
to kill yourself...

1793
01:47:41,789 --> 01:47:44,124
for whatever it is you've been up to?

1794
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:46,710
How's the trial goin'?

1795
01:47:46,794 --> 01:47:50,172
Well, I'm making a lot of noise.
Dancer's racking up all the points.

1796
01:47:50,256 --> 01:47:52,799
No, but come on.
Now, where have you been?

1797
01:47:53,885 --> 01:47:58,055
Quill hired Mary Pilant
up north of the Sault Sainte Marie.

1798
01:47:58,139 --> 01:48:00,308
Struck me funny he'd go
all the way up there

1799
01:48:00,309 --> 01:48:02,476
to hire somebody just
to work for him.

1800
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,519
I been up there nosin' around.

1801
01:48:04,604 --> 01:48:06,772
Well, did you find anything useful?

1802
01:48:06,856 --> 01:48:09,733
Not until I looked up
her birth certificate.

1803
01:48:09,817 --> 01:48:15,280
Born Blind River, Ontario,
1934, out of wedlock.

1804
01:48:15,365 --> 01:48:19,785
Mother was a waitress: Simone Pilant.

1805
01:48:19,869 --> 01:48:24,164
Father was a lumberjack.
Name: Barney Quill.

1806
01:48:31,631 --> 01:48:34,091
Say, I'd like to see Miss Mary Pilant.

1807
01:48:34,676 --> 01:48:37,719
- It's late, mister.
- I know. I know. This is important.

1808
01:48:37,804 --> 01:48:39,971
- Real important?
- Real important.

1809
01:48:42,725 --> 01:48:45,102
- [Line Rings]
- [Woman] Yes?

1810
01:48:45,186 --> 01:48:47,167
Miss Pilant, sorry
if I woke you up.

1811
01:48:47,168 --> 01:48:49,147
There's a guy to see you.
Says it's real important.

1812
01:48:49,232 --> 01:48:50,774
- What's your, uh...
- Paul Biegler.

1813
01:48:50,858 --> 01:48:53,235
- Biegler.
- I don't wish to see him.

1814
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:55,570
- Okay.
- [Buzzes]

1815
01:48:55,655 --> 01:48:57,823
She, uh, said it's not important enough.

1816
01:48:57,907 --> 01:49:02,035
All right. Now you call her back and tell
her I mentioned Blind River, Ontario.

1817
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:04,037
I'll be in the bar.

1820
01:49:20,179 --> 01:49:21,972
Evening, Alphonse.

- ## [Ends]

1822
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,393
Well, I think I'll try a little of both.

1823
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:28,895
What do you say we start out with a beer?

1824
01:49:33,609 --> 01:49:35,777
On the house, and that's all you get.

1825
01:49:35,862 --> 01:49:38,488
A beer. No questions, no answers.

1826

- I'm just a lawyer trying to do my job.

[Footsteps Approaching]

1829
01:49:46,414 --> 01:49:48,457
Will you sit over there, please?

1830
01:49:54,422 --> 01:49:56,339
Miss Pilant, I owe you an apology.

1831
01:49:56,424 --> 01:49:58,675
I was a little rough
when I was out here before.

1832
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:02,095
I didn't know that Barney Quill
was your father.

1833
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:05,015
- You didn't come here just to apologize.
- No. No.

1834
01:50:05,099 --> 01:50:07,017
But the apology was part of it.

1835
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:11,104
To tell the truth, I sort of hoped
maybe it would thaw you out a bit.

1836
01:50:11,814 --> 01:50:15,650
All I want you to do is just listen to me.
Just for a few minutes.

1837
01:50:16,235 --> 01:50:20,906
Now, I need some strong evidence to back
up Laura Manion's story about the rape.

1838
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:24,409
The prosecution's gonna
attack that story pretty hard.

1839
01:50:24,494 --> 01:50:27,120
And if... if the jury thinks she's lying...

1840
01:50:27,205 --> 01:50:30,290
well, that could turn the decision
against Manion, you see.

1841
01:50:30,374 --> 01:50:35,045
Well, isn't she lying? Barney didn't do
what she said he did. He couldn't have.

1842
01:50:35,671 --> 01:50:39,299
- What did you know about your father?
- All I needed to know.

1843
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:43,386
He took care of me and of my mother
for as long as she lived.

1844
01:50:43,471 --> 01:50:46,723
He was always there when I needed him.

1845
01:50:46,808 --> 01:50:49,059
That's what I know
about my father, Mr. Biegler.

1846
01:50:49,143 --> 01:50:51,728
Will that back up Laura Manion's story?

1847
01:50:51,813 --> 01:50:54,898
Miss Pilant, I don't want to get at you.
I don't want to hurt you.

1848
01:50:54,982 --> 01:50:57,192
I appreciate your affection
for your father...

1849
01:50:57,276 --> 01:51:00,320
but... but as a lawyer I've had to learn...

1850
01:51:00,404 --> 01:51:03,156
that people aren't just good or just bad.

1851
01:51:03,241 --> 01:51:05,408
But people are many things.

1852
01:51:05,493 --> 01:51:08,703
And I kind of have a feeling
that Barney Quill was many things.

1853
01:51:08,788 --> 01:51:12,082
- I don't want to hear that.
- No, no, please. Please now, hear me out.

1854
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:16,086
I believe that Barney told
Al Paquette what happened that night...

1855
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:19,422
and he told him to go to this window
and wait for Manion.

1856
01:51:19,507 --> 01:51:24,177
Barney stayed behind the bar
next to a gun rack, just waiting.

1857
01:51:24,262 --> 01:51:27,556
Manion came in and fired
the minute he got inside that door...

1858
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:30,433
and the first shot went
right through Barney's heart.

1859
01:51:30,518 --> 01:51:32,853
Now, here's what I want you to do.

1860
01:51:32,937 --> 01:51:37,399
I want you to try to persuade Al to come
to the court as a defense witness...

1861
01:51:37,483 --> 01:51:40,610
and tell the court exactly
what Barney told him that night.

1862
01:51:40,695 --> 01:51:43,613
That he'd raped and assaulted Mrs. Manion.

1863
01:51:43,698 --> 01:51:46,283
Al wouldn't conceal a thing like that.

1864
01:51:46,367 --> 01:51:48,410
Why wouldn't he tell it, if it were true?

1865
01:51:48,494 --> 01:51:51,746
I don't know. I don't know.
But I know this.

1866
01:51:51,831 --> 01:51:55,292
Everybody loves something or someone.

1867
01:51:55,376 --> 01:51:57,335
Me, I love fishing...

1868
01:51:57,420 --> 01:51:59,629
and an old guy by the name of Parnell.

1869
01:51:59,714 --> 01:52:03,258
Manion loves his freedom.
He'd like to have a little more of it.

1870
01:52:03,342 --> 01:52:06,970
Barney loved you. Maybe so does Al.

1871
01:52:07,638 --> 01:52:10,557
I wouldn't blame him.
But he doesn't want to hurt you.

1872
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:13,435
He doesn't want you to know
the truth about Barney...

1873
01:52:13,519 --> 01:52:15,478
that he could be dangerous and brutal.

1874
01:52:15,563 --> 01:52:17,669
Now, if you'd just ask AI.

1875
01:52:17,670 --> 01:52:19,774
If you could just ask
him right straight out.

1876
01:52:20,484 --> 01:52:21,776
AI?

1877
01:52:30,119 --> 01:52:33,914
Al, Mr. Biegler knows
that Barney was my father.

1878
01:52:35,249 --> 01:52:38,335
He thinks you know something
about the night my father was killed...

1879
01:52:38,419 --> 01:52:40,837
something you won't tell.

1880
01:52:40,922 --> 01:52:43,548
Lawyer, I told you once,
and I'll tell you again.

1881
01:52:43,633 --> 01:52:46,426
- No questions, no answers.
- Wait, Al.

1882
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:51,514
Did my father rape Mrs. Manion?

1883
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,517
Barney wouldn't hurt a woman.

1884
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:59,773
Is there any reason you wouldn't tell me
the truth about that, Al?

1885
01:53:00,942 --> 01:53:02,901
What reason?

1886
01:53:09,116 --> 01:53:11,660
- Anything else, Mr. Biegler?
- No.

1887
01:53:11,744 --> 01:53:14,621
I'm gonna leave a pass
for you and Al at the trial.

1888
01:53:14,705 --> 01:53:17,791
You might like to watch
Lieutenant Manion get convicted.

1889
01:53:18,376 --> 01:53:20,460
You gonna spread it around
about Mary being Barney's kid?

1890
01:53:20,544 --> 01:53:22,796
No, I'm not gonna spread it around, Al.

1891
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:26,132
Thank you for the beer.
Good night, Miss Pilant.

1892
01:53:30,221 --> 01:53:32,973
All right,
now let's get at this rosary thing.

1893
01:53:33,057 --> 01:53:36,309
Now, it's been testified
that your wife swore to you on a rosary...

1894
01:53:36,394 --> 01:53:39,145
that she'd been raped by Barney Quill.

1895
01:53:39,230 --> 01:53:41,690
Did you ask your wife to swear on a rosary?

1896
01:53:42,733 --> 01:53:45,902
My wife was hysterical.
She wasn't making much sense.

1897
01:53:45,987 --> 01:53:49,155
I thought if I asked her
to take an oath on a rosary...

1898
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:51,992
it might serve to calm her,
make her think more clearly.

1899
01:53:52,076 --> 01:53:53,994
Did the rosary help?

1900
01:53:54,078 --> 01:53:56,496
She was able to tell me
in detail what had happened.

1901
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:58,498
All right. Go on from there now.

1902
01:53:58,582 --> 01:54:00,834
What did you do then, Lieutenant?

1903
01:54:00,918 --> 01:54:04,504
Well, I... I had her lie on the bed...

1904
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:08,508
and I got some cold cloths for her head.

1905
01:54:08,592 --> 01:54:12,512
And, uh... Oh, yes.
I gave her a drink of brandy.

1906
01:54:14,765 --> 01:54:16,683
After a while she became calm...

1907
01:54:16,767 --> 01:54:19,352
seemed to go to sleep.

1908
01:54:19,437 --> 01:54:24,024
Then I went to the closet,
I got my gun, and I loaded it.

1909
01:54:24,108 --> 01:54:27,986
- Was it in your mind to kill Barney Quill?
- No.

1910
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:31,448
Well, then why did you go to the closet
and get your gun and load it?

1911
01:54:31,532 --> 01:54:33,284
Well, I-I-I knew I had
to go to Quill's place.

1912
01:54:33,285 --> 01:54:35,035
I thought I might need it.

1913
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:36,870
Why?

1914
01:54:36,954 --> 01:54:39,706
I knew Mr. Quill kept guns behind the bar.

1915
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:41,708
I was afraid he might shoot me.

1916
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:45,170
Might shoot you if you did what?
What were you gonna do?

1917
01:54:46,213 --> 01:54:48,631
I'm not sure.

1918
01:54:48,716 --> 01:54:51,551
I remember having some idea...

1919
01:54:51,635 --> 01:54:53,887
of finding him...

1920
01:54:53,971 --> 01:54:56,890
and holding him while I called the police.

1921
01:54:56,974 --> 01:54:58,975
Well, that Mr... what's his name...

1922
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:01,936
Mr. Lemon, right at the tourist court
there, he was a deputy sheriff.

1923
01:55:02,021 --> 01:55:03,938
Why didn't you get him to go with you?

1924
01:55:04,774 --> 01:55:08,902
Maybe because he always seemed to be
just the old caretaker of the park.

1925
01:55:10,321 --> 01:55:14,032
Maybe because I wasn't
thinking about anything too clearly...

1926
01:55:14,116 --> 01:55:16,076
except finding Barney Quill.

1927
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:19,829
Why didn't you go to a telephone, call the
state police before you went to the bar?

1928
01:55:19,914 --> 01:55:22,082
I don't know.

1929
01:55:22,166 --> 01:55:24,417
I was in sort of a daze.

1930
01:55:25,503 --> 01:55:28,463
It was a horrible thing
to see what had been done to my wife.

1931
01:55:28,547 --> 01:55:30,757
Now, you say you were in a sort of a daze.

1932
01:55:30,841 --> 01:55:34,260
When you got to the bar,
did you see that the bar was crowded?

1933
01:55:35,012 --> 01:55:36,930
I...

1934
01:55:37,014 --> 01:55:39,557
I didn't see anyone at the bar...

1935
01:55:40,351 --> 01:55:42,435
except Barney Quill.

1936
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:44,437
He was the only person I saw.

1937
01:55:44,522 --> 01:55:46,523
What was he doing?

1938
01:55:47,191 --> 01:55:50,985
I think he was just
standing there behind the bar.

1939
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:55,073
Well, now, did he make
a threatening move to get a gun?

1940
01:55:55,157 --> 01:55:56,699
I don't know.

1941
01:55:57,284 --> 01:55:58,910
He may have. I don't know.

1942
01:55:58,994 --> 01:56:01,454
All right.
Now, you say you went there to find him...

1943
01:56:01,539 --> 01:56:03,623
to hold him for the police.

1944
01:56:03,707 --> 01:56:05,625
Why did you shoot him?

1945
01:56:07,711 --> 01:56:10,046
I don't remember shooting him.

1946
01:56:10,631 --> 01:56:12,465
Now, when you left the bar...

1947
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:15,301
do you remember Alphonse Paquette
coming up to you and stopping you...

1948
01:56:15,386 --> 01:56:17,470
and saying,
"You'd better not run away from this"...

1949
01:56:17,555 --> 01:56:21,224
and your reply,
"Do you want some too, buster?"

1950
01:56:21,308 --> 01:56:22,809
Remember that?

1951
01:56:23,519 --> 01:56:25,812
I-I seem to have a vague recollection...

1952
01:56:25,896 --> 01:56:27,814
of somebody speaking to me...

1953
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:32,902
but I don't remember what I said
or what was said to me.

1954
01:56:32,987 --> 01:56:35,905
When did you realize
that you had shot Quill?

1955
01:56:38,576 --> 01:56:40,994
I was... I was getting a drink of water.

1956
01:56:41,078 --> 01:56:43,997
I remember my throat was so dry it hurt.

1957
01:56:45,583 --> 01:56:48,001
And when I put the glass down,
I saw the gun...

1958
01:56:48,085 --> 01:56:50,503
on the kitchen sink beside the tap.

1959
01:56:51,589 --> 01:56:53,590
I noticed the gun was empty.

1960
01:56:54,675 --> 01:56:57,343
Now I'd like you to show
the court and jury...

1961
01:56:57,428 --> 01:56:59,012
just, uh...

1962
01:56:59,972 --> 01:57:02,515
just how you knew this gun was empty.

1963
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:05,018
Well, this gadget here...

1964
01:57:05,102 --> 01:57:08,396
when it sticks up,
you know the last round's been fired.

1965
01:57:09,106 --> 01:57:12,192
Lieutenant Manion,
on the night of the shooting...

1966
01:57:12,276 --> 01:57:14,194
did you love your wife?

1967
01:57:14,278 --> 01:57:17,655
- Yes, sir.
- Do you still love her?

1968
01:57:21,118 --> 01:57:22,952
Very much.

1969
01:57:23,704 --> 01:57:25,747
The witness is yours, Mr. Dancer.

1970
01:57:25,831 --> 01:57:27,707
Lieutenant Manion...

1971
01:57:28,959 --> 01:57:31,211
how many men have you killed?

1972
01:57:31,295 --> 01:57:33,213
Now wait a minute.

1973
01:57:33,881 --> 01:57:35,549
Your Honor, a man's
war record...

1974
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:37,217
in Lieutenant Manion's
case, a great record...

1975
01:57:37,301 --> 01:57:39,219
certainly shouldn't be used against him.

1976
01:57:39,303 --> 01:57:42,222
Your Honor, I'm as patriotic
as the next man...

1977
01:57:42,306 --> 01:57:47,060
but the simple truth is, war can
condition a man to killing other men.

1978
01:57:47,144 --> 01:57:49,896
I simply want to determine
how conditioned the lieutenant may be...

1979
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:53,483
to the use of firearms
on other human beings.

1980
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:55,485
I don't quite like the
question, Mr. Biegler...

1981
01:57:55,569 --> 01:57:57,570
but I don't see how I can exclude it.

1982
01:57:57,655 --> 01:57:59,572
Let him answer.

1983
01:57:59,657 --> 01:58:02,909
I know I killed
at least four men in Korea...

1984
01:58:02,993 --> 01:58:04,911
three with a hand grenade...

1985
01:58:04,995 --> 01:58:07,247
and one with my service automatic.

1986
01:58:07,331 --> 01:58:11,084
I may have killed others.
A soldier doesn't always know.

1987
01:58:11,168 --> 01:58:13,419
Now, Lieutenant, in these
acts of killing...

1988
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:15,421
did you ever have a lapse of memory...

1989
01:58:15,506 --> 01:58:16,799
such as you had when
you killed Barney Quill?

1990
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,091
No, sir.

1991
01:58:18,175 --> 01:58:20,593
Did you ever have
a lapse of memory during battle?

1992
01:58:20,678 --> 01:58:21,887
No, sir.

1993
01:58:21,888 --> 01:58:23,096
Were you ever submitted
to a constant barrage...

1994
01:58:23,180 --> 01:58:25,098
constantly in a sweat for many hours...

1995
01:58:25,182 --> 01:58:27,267
- constantly under attack, or attacking?
- Many times.

1996
01:58:27,351 --> 01:58:29,269
Were you ever treated for shell shock,
battle fatigue...

1997
01:58:29,353 --> 01:58:31,437
- or any war neurosis or psychosis?
- No, sir.

1998
01:58:31,522 --> 01:58:35,775
Did you ever experience
any unusual mental state during the war?

1999
01:58:35,859 --> 01:58:37,235
Well, I do remember
having one great urge.

2000
01:58:37,236 --> 01:58:38,611
What was that?

2001
01:58:38,696 --> 01:58:42,115
- To get the hell out and go home.
- [Spectators Laughing]

2002
01:58:42,199 --> 01:58:46,452
You would do well to consider the
seriousness of the situation you are in.

2003
01:58:46,537 --> 01:58:49,622
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
- I sympathize with the lieutenant.

2004
01:58:49,707 --> 01:58:53,626
I expect he has the same feeling
about getting out of jail.

2005
01:58:53,711 --> 01:58:56,796
But the main point here, Lieutenant, is
that at no time during your war service...

2006
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,798
did you have a record
of mental disturbance.

2007
01:58:58,882 --> 01:59:00,967
You were always in complete possession
of your faculties.

2008
01:59:01,051 --> 01:59:03,636
Yes, sir, that's right.

2009
01:59:03,721 --> 01:59:06,306
- No more questions.
- [Biegler] No redirect, Your Honor.

2010
01:59:06,390 --> 01:59:08,975
[Judge Weaver]
Step down, please. Call your next witness.

2011
01:59:09,059 --> 01:59:11,644
We call Laura Manion to the stand.

2012
01:59:23,741 --> 01:59:26,659
- Up these stairs and to the right.
- Thank you.

2013
01:59:33,167 --> 01:59:35,626
Now, how long after you told your husband
what had happened...

2014
01:59:35,711 --> 01:59:37,962
did he leave the trailer?

2015
01:59:38,047 --> 01:59:40,131
I don't know exactly.

2016
01:59:40,215 --> 01:59:42,133
Everything was kind of fuzzy. I...

2017
01:59:42,217 --> 01:59:44,635
I was faint, and I lay down on the bed.

2018
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:46,804
He sat beside me.

2019
01:59:46,889 --> 01:59:49,974
I vaguely remember
his getting up and going out.

2020
01:59:50,059 --> 01:59:52,643
I remember wondering
if he was going for a doctor.

2021
01:59:52,728 --> 01:59:54,896
And then he came back in.

2022
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:57,482
It seemed like just a few seconds,
but it must have been longer.

2023
01:59:57,566 --> 01:59:59,776
I must have gone to sleep.

2024
02:00:00,527 --> 02:00:03,154
When he came back in,
he sat on the bed...

2025
02:00:03,238 --> 02:00:05,448
and he had a gun in his hand.

2026
02:00:05,532 --> 02:00:08,618
And I said, "What are you going to do?"

2027
02:00:08,702 --> 02:00:11,662
And he said, "I think I've already done it.

2028
02:00:11,747 --> 02:00:13,831
I think I've killed Barney Quill."

2029
02:00:13,916 --> 02:00:17,335
Are you sure he didn't say
"I've killed Barney Quill"?

2030
02:00:17,419 --> 02:00:20,004
No, I... I remember distinctly.

2031
02:00:20,089 --> 02:00:22,006
"I think I've killed Barney Quill."

2032
02:00:22,091 --> 02:00:24,175
Then what did you do?

2033
02:00:24,259 --> 02:00:28,679
I put my arms around him
and began to cry and...

2034
02:00:28,764 --> 02:00:31,516
and I said,
"You'd better go to Mr. Lemon."

2035
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:33,518
And my husband said, "I forgot about that."

2036
02:00:33,602 --> 02:00:36,521
What did he mean? Forgot about what?

2037
02:00:36,605 --> 02:00:39,690
Well, he meant that he'd forgotten
Mr. Lemon was a deputy sheriff.

2038
02:00:39,775 --> 02:00:43,403
And he said,
"Yes, I'll go turn myself in to Mr. Lemon."

2039
02:00:43,487 --> 02:00:47,698
Yes, I see. Your Honor, I have no other
direct questions at this time...

2040
02:00:47,783 --> 02:00:50,368
but since I'm sure
it's difficult to visualize...

2041
02:00:50,452 --> 02:00:53,538
the part a little dog
played on this night...

2042
02:00:53,622 --> 02:00:57,542
I should like a few minutes to show the
court this remarkable little animal.

2043
02:00:57,626 --> 02:00:59,544
Do the People object?

2044
02:00:59,628 --> 02:01:01,546
I'm sure if we raise an objection,
Your Honor...

2045
02:01:01,630 --> 02:01:04,924
Mr. Biegler will declare that we're
haters of all small, furry animals.

2046
02:01:05,008 --> 02:01:06,947
[Spectators Chuckle]

2047
02:01:06,948 --> 02:01:08,886
A creature that cannot talk
will be a welcome relief.

2048
02:01:08,971 --> 02:01:11,222
- Bring in the dog.
- [Spectators Chuckling]

2049
02:01:11,306 --> 02:01:15,852
Thank you, sir. Will the, uh,
deputy bring in the dog, please.

2050
02:01:28,991 --> 02:01:31,284
Uh, you can put him right there.

2051
02:01:32,453 --> 02:01:34,370
Fine.
Here, Muff! Here, Muff! Come on!

2052
02:01:34,455 --> 02:01:36,372
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

2053
02:01:36,457 --> 02:01:38,458
That's a boy.

2054
02:01:39,126 --> 02:01:42,795
And now I'll ask Mrs. Manion
to bring a flashlight for the dog.

2055
02:01:53,849 --> 02:01:58,311
Now, I ask the court to notice
that the dog turned on the light.

2056
02:02:00,481 --> 02:02:02,815
[Laughing]

2057
02:02:07,321 --> 02:02:10,072
Well, it's easy to see that Muff
doesn't know who his enemies are.

2058
02:02:10,157 --> 02:02:12,283
- [Laughing Continues]
- Remove the dog, please.

2059
02:02:12,367 --> 02:02:14,285
- Yes, sir.
- The witness will resume the stand.

2060
02:02:14,369 --> 02:02:17,497
Here we go, Muff. All right.

2061
02:02:18,874 --> 02:02:23,127
Mrs. Manion, may I congratulate you
on your well-trained pet.

2062
02:02:23,212 --> 02:02:25,129
May I also say that I'm pleased to see...

2063
02:02:25,214 --> 02:02:28,466
you are not today
hiding your lovely hair under a hat.

2064
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:32,470
Your Honor, is the assistant attorney
general from Lansing pitching woo...

2065
02:02:32,554 --> 02:02:34,847
or is he going to cross-examine?

2066
02:02:34,932 --> 02:02:36,474
Let's get on with it.

2067
02:02:36,558 --> 02:02:38,809
Mrs. Manion, what was your occupation
before you were married?

2068
02:02:38,894 --> 02:02:41,896
- Housewife.
- Oh, then you've been married before?

2069
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:44,295
Yes, once.

2070
02:02:44,296 --> 02:02:46,609
I suppose your first
husband, uh, died, hmm?

2071
02:02:46,693 --> 02:02:47,693
No.

2072
02:02:47,778 --> 02:02:50,321
Did you divorce your first husband
to marry Lieutenant Manion?

2073
02:02:50,405 --> 02:02:52,990
Your Honor, if counsel wants to know
the grounds for Mrs. Manion's divorce...

2074
02:02:53,075 --> 02:02:54,617
let him ask that question.

2075
02:02:54,701 --> 02:02:56,452
What were the grounds for divorce,
Mrs. Manion?

2076
02:02:56,537 --> 02:02:58,351
Mental cruelty.

2077
02:02:58,352 --> 02:03:00,164
Naturally.
And how long after your divorce...

2078
02:03:00,249 --> 02:03:02,458
was it that you married
Lieutenant Manion?

2079
02:03:02,543 --> 02:03:04,252
Uh, I'm not sure.

2080
02:03:04,336 --> 02:03:07,338
May I refresh the witness's memory
for Mr. Dancer?

2081
02:03:07,422 --> 02:03:09,340
- By all means.
- I believe she told me...

2082
02:03:09,424 --> 02:03:12,843
that they were married
three days after the divorce.

2083
02:03:12,928 --> 02:03:15,179
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.
ls that correct, Mrs. Manion?

2084
02:03:15,264 --> 02:03:16,722
Yes.

2085
02:03:16,807 --> 02:03:19,433
Then unless yours
was a whirlwind courtship...

2086
02:03:19,518 --> 02:03:21,644
you must have known Lieutenant Manion
before your divorce.

2087
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:23,688
- Did you?
- Yes.

2088
02:03:24,648 --> 02:03:28,359
Mrs. Manion, what is your...
[Clears Throat] religious affiliation?

2089
02:03:28,443 --> 02:03:30,361
[Laura] I'm a Catholic.

2090
02:03:30,445 --> 02:03:33,739
- Catholic in good standing?
- Well, no. The divorce, you know.

2091
02:03:33,824 --> 02:03:36,701
You mean you were excommunicated
because of the divorce and remarriage?

2092
02:03:36,785 --> 02:03:37,910
Yes.

2093
02:03:38,495 --> 02:03:42,164
Mrs. Manion, wouldn't you say
that a Catholic who can blithely ignore...

2094
02:03:42,249 --> 02:03:44,709
one of the cardinal rules of her church...

2095
02:03:44,793 --> 02:03:48,045
could also easily ignore
an oath taken on one of its artifacts...

2096
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:50,590
say, an oath taken on a rosary?

2097
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:54,427
I-I-I don't think that's true.

2098
02:03:54,511 --> 02:03:56,200
But wouldn't you think
there'd be some doubt

2099
02:03:56,201 --> 02:03:57,888
about the integrity
of such a person?

2100
02:03:58,599 --> 02:04:00,600
I don't know. Uh...

2101
02:04:00,684 --> 02:04:03,227
All I know is the rosary
means something to me.

2102
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:07,898
I see.
Well, I'll pass on to something else.

2103
02:04:07,983 --> 02:04:10,735
Mrs. Manion, you testified
that your husband came home late...

2104
02:04:10,819 --> 02:04:12,570
from his work
on the night of the shooting.

2105
02:04:12,654 --> 02:04:14,572
Were you a little angry
about his being late?

2106
02:04:14,656 --> 02:04:16,907
Well, I-I...
I guess I was a little put out.

2107
02:04:16,992 --> 02:04:19,910
- Did you have an argument?
- Not much. A little.

2108
02:04:19,995 --> 02:04:22,079
When you left the trailer
to go to the inn...

2109
02:04:22,164 --> 02:04:24,040
did your husband know you were going?

2110
02:04:24,124 --> 02:04:25,625
He was asleep.

2111
02:04:25,709 --> 02:04:27,752
Was part of your reason
for going without his knowledge...

2112
02:04:27,836 --> 02:04:30,129
because you were, uh, vexed?

2113
02:04:31,089 --> 02:04:34,258
Well, I-I'd been ironing all day and I...

2114
02:04:35,010 --> 02:04:36,553
Yes, I guess that's true.

2115
02:04:36,554 --> 02:04:38,095
Your Honor, the counsel
has deliberately...

2116
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:39,805
cut off my view of the witness.

2117
02:04:39,890 --> 02:04:41,390
I'm sorry, Mr. Biegler.

2118
02:04:41,475 --> 02:04:43,684
I wouldn't want to interfere
with your signals to Mrs. Manion.

2119
02:04:43,769 --> 02:04:46,103
I object to the implication
I was signaling the witness.

2120
02:04:46,188 --> 02:04:49,106
This is the shabbiest
courtroom trick I've ever seen.

2121
02:04:49,191 --> 02:04:51,108
You haven't lived, Mr. Biegler.

2122
02:04:51,193 --> 02:04:53,569
Your Honor, I ask the court
to rule on my objection.

2123
02:04:53,654 --> 02:04:55,946
Mr. Dancer, will you be careful
not to place yourself...

2124
02:04:56,031 --> 02:04:58,324
between Mr. Biegler and his witness.

2125
02:04:58,408 --> 02:05:01,952
Of course, Your Honor.
Anything else, Mr. Biegler?

2126
02:05:02,037 --> 02:05:03,954
You do it once more, I'll punt you...

2127
02:05:04,039 --> 02:05:06,582
all the way out into
the middle of Lake Superior.

2128
02:05:06,667 --> 02:05:10,002
- [Spectators Laughing]
- [Judge Weaver] Gentlemen, gentlemen.

2129
02:05:10,087 --> 02:05:12,380
This rowing has got to stop.

2130
02:05:12,464 --> 02:05:16,467
The next one of you that speaks out of turn
will have me to deal with.

2131
02:05:16,551 --> 02:05:18,678
Now get on with your cross-examination.

2132
02:05:18,762 --> 02:05:22,014
Would you have gone to the inn
if your husband had, uh, been awake?

2133
02:05:22,099 --> 02:05:25,518
- He probably would have gone with me.
- But would you have gone alone?

2134
02:05:25,602 --> 02:05:29,188
- Not if he didn't want me to.
- Would he have not wanted you to?

2135
02:05:29,856 --> 02:05:32,566
I'm not sure.
I... I don't know how to answer that.

2136
02:05:32,651 --> 02:05:34,694
Well, had you ever gone
to the Thunder Bay Inn...

2137
02:05:34,778 --> 02:05:37,905
or elsewhere in Thunder Bay
alone at night?

2138
02:05:38,407 --> 02:05:41,617
- Yes, sometimes.
- Did your husband know you were going?

2139
02:05:42,494 --> 02:05:44,662
Not always. He goes to sleep early and...

2140
02:05:44,746 --> 02:05:47,623
and sometimes I'm restless.

2141
02:05:47,708 --> 02:05:49,834
Where did you go on these occasions?

2142
02:05:49,918 --> 02:05:53,713
Oh, I'd take a walk by the lake
or went to the bingo place.

2143
02:05:53,797 --> 02:05:57,216
- Maybe to the inn.
- You ever go to meet another man?

2144
02:05:57,759 --> 02:06:00,010
No, I didn't. I never did that.

2145
02:06:00,554 --> 02:06:04,348
You mean to say, Mrs. Manion, a lovely
woman like yourself, attractive to men...

2146
02:06:04,433 --> 02:06:06,475
lonely, restless, that you never once...

2147
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:09,520
Objection, Your Honor! The witness
has answered the question about other men.

2148
02:06:09,604 --> 02:06:12,356
Counsel is now making
a veiled suggestion to the jury.

2149
02:06:12,441 --> 02:06:14,525
I withdraw the question.

2150
02:06:14,609 --> 02:06:19,071
Now, Mrs. Manion, on these
occasional excursions into the night...

2151
02:06:19,156 --> 02:06:21,657
did you always go and return home alone?

2152
02:06:21,742 --> 02:06:23,284
Of course.

2153
02:06:23,368 --> 02:06:26,871
Mrs. Manion, you testified that the reason
you got into Barney Quill's car...

2154
02:06:26,955 --> 02:06:29,206
was because you were afraid
to go home alone.

2155
02:06:29,291 --> 02:06:31,459
Why were you so frightened
on this particular night?

2156
02:06:32,419 --> 02:06:36,005
I said that it was because he told me
bears had been seen around.

2157
02:06:36,590 --> 02:06:38,717
Was this the first time
you'd heard that bears

2158
02:06:38,718 --> 02:06:40,843
came around Thunder Bay
to pick up scraps?

2159
02:06:40,927 --> 02:06:43,262
- No.
- Had you seen the bears before?

2160
02:06:43,346 --> 02:06:44,513
Yes.

2161
02:06:44,598 --> 02:06:47,057
Oh, this was just the first time
you were afraid of them?

2162
02:06:47,142 --> 02:06:49,268
No, I was always afraid of them.

2163
02:06:49,352 --> 02:06:51,604
Oh, this was just the first time
you were enough afraid...

2164
02:06:51,688 --> 02:06:54,732
to allow a man to take you home
from one of your evening prowls?

2165
02:06:54,816 --> 02:06:58,402
Objection! The use of the word "prowl"
is meant to mislead the jury.

2166
02:06:58,487 --> 02:07:00,571
- [Judge Weaver] Sustained.
- I apologize.

2167
02:07:00,655 --> 02:07:04,658
Mrs. Manion, I didn't mean to imply
that you were a huntress.

2168
02:07:04,743 --> 02:07:06,702
Was this the first time
that you were enough afraid...

2169
02:07:06,787 --> 02:07:10,122
to allow a man to take you home
from one of your evening walks?

2170
02:07:10,832 --> 02:07:13,667
Well, it... it wasn't just that.

2171
02:07:13,752 --> 02:07:15,628
- It was...
- Oh, come now, Mrs. Manion.

2172
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:17,130
You should be able to
answer that straight off.

2173
02:07:17,131 --> 02:07:18,547
That's a simple enough question.

2174
02:07:18,632 --> 02:07:20,800
Your Honor,
how can the witness answer straight off...

2175
02:07:20,884 --> 02:07:23,219
when the counsel keeps
interrupting the answer?

2176
02:07:23,303 --> 02:07:26,430
The witness seemed a little slow to me,
Mr. Biegler.

2177
02:07:26,515 --> 02:07:29,433
However, let her complete her answers
before you interrupt.

2178
02:07:29,518 --> 02:07:32,269
Of course, Your Honor.
In any case, Mr. Biegler's objection...

2179
02:07:32,354 --> 02:07:35,231
has given Mrs. Manion sufficient time
to think of an answer to my question.

2180
02:07:35,315 --> 02:07:37,274
You've thought of one,
haven't you, Mrs. Manion?

2181
02:07:37,359 --> 02:07:40,611
What I was going to say was that I
didn't want to offend Mr. Quill...

2182
02:07:40,695 --> 02:07:43,948
by making him think that I was
afraid of him or didn't like him.

2183
02:07:44,032 --> 02:07:47,743
He'd been very pleasant to my husband
and me when we'd been in his bar.

2184
02:07:47,828 --> 02:07:49,642
That's very good, Mrs. Manion.
Very good indeed.

2185
02:07:49,643 --> 02:07:51,455
Your Honor, please.

2186
02:07:51,540 --> 02:07:55,960
The attorney for the People will reserve
his comments for the arguments.

2187
02:07:56,044 --> 02:07:58,504
I will ask you this question, Mrs. Manion.

2188
02:07:59,089 --> 02:08:04,218
Was this the first time you had been
in Barney Quill's car at night?

2189
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:09,682
Mrs. Manion, did you hear the question?

2190
02:08:10,225 --> 02:08:11,809
Yes, I heard.

2191
02:08:12,561 --> 02:08:14,854
Yes, it was the first time.

2192
02:08:15,564 --> 02:08:18,399
Would you raise your voice a little,
Mrs. Manion?

2193
02:08:18,483 --> 02:08:21,193
[Laura]
I said it was the first time.

2194
02:08:22,279 --> 02:08:26,657
Now, Mrs. Manion,
I'm quite concerned about the lost panties.

2195
02:08:26,741 --> 02:08:29,535
Would you describe this article of clothing
to the court, please?

2196
02:08:31,329 --> 02:08:33,998
They were nylon
and had lace up the sides.

2197
02:08:34,082 --> 02:08:36,500
There was a label in them
of the place I got them...

2198
02:08:36,585 --> 02:08:38,502
the Smart Shop, in Phoenix, Arizona.

2199
02:08:38,587 --> 02:08:40,504
What was the color of the panties?

2200
02:08:40,589 --> 02:08:42,506
- I believe white.
- You believe?

2201
02:08:42,591 --> 02:08:44,050
I have white and pink.
They may have been pink.

2202
02:08:44,051 --> 02:08:45,509
You're not sure?

2203
02:08:45,594 --> 02:08:48,470
Haven't you checked your lingerie
to see which pair of panties is missing?

2204
02:08:48,555 --> 02:08:49,555
No.

2205
02:08:49,639 --> 02:08:51,473
When your husband came home
late from his work...

2206
02:08:51,558 --> 02:08:54,852
and you had this little spat,
were you already dressed to go out?

2207
02:08:54,936 --> 02:08:56,770
- No.
- When did you dress?

2208
02:08:56,855 --> 02:08:58,564
After dinner, when he was asleep.

2209
02:08:58,648 --> 02:09:01,734
It's been stated here that you were
bare legged in the bar. Is that true?

2210
02:09:01,818 --> 02:09:02,860
Yes.

2211
02:09:02,944 --> 02:09:05,696
In your anger at your husband
and your haste to get out of the trailer...

2212
02:09:05,780 --> 02:09:06,844
perhaps you didn't put
on any panties either?

2213
02:09:06,845 --> 02:09:07,907
Objection.

2214
02:09:07,991 --> 02:09:10,409
The witness has already testified
as to what she was wearing.

2215
02:09:10,493 --> 02:09:13,037
- [Judge Weaver] Sustained.
- Do you always wear panties, Mrs. Manion?

2216
02:09:13,121 --> 02:09:15,873
Now, Your Honor,
I object to this line of questioning.

2217
02:09:15,957 --> 02:09:18,834
It's immaterial what
Mrs. Manion does all the time.

2218
02:09:18,919 --> 02:09:21,128
On the night she was attacked,
she was wearing panties...

2219
02:09:21,212 --> 02:09:22,838
and that's all we're concerned with.

2220
02:09:22,923 --> 02:09:25,382
Your Honor, Mrs. Manion seems
a little bit uncertain...

2221
02:09:25,467 --> 02:09:27,593
about what kind of panties
she was wearing...

2222
02:09:27,677 --> 02:09:29,595
and since these panties
have not been found...

2223
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:33,432
I submit that it's possible
she wasn't wearing any and has forgotten.

2224
02:09:33,516 --> 02:09:36,936
- That's all I'm trying to get at.
- You may answer, Mrs. Manion.

2225
02:09:38,021 --> 02:09:40,272
Do you always wear panties?

2226
02:09:41,358 --> 02:09:43,025
No.

2227
02:09:43,109 --> 02:09:46,111
On what occasions don't you wear them?
When you go out alone at night?

2228
02:09:46,196 --> 02:09:48,156
Oh, no, no. Objection.
He says he's going

2229
02:09:48,157 --> 02:09:50,115
after one thing, then
he goes after another.

2230
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:52,076
I'll sustain the objection.

2231
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:55,788
Strike out the last two questions
and Mrs. Manion's answer.

2232
02:09:55,872 --> 02:09:58,624
Now, Mr. Dancer, get off the panties.

2233
02:09:58,708 --> 02:10:02,294
- You've done enough damage.
- Yes, Your Honor.

2234
02:10:02,379 --> 02:10:06,298
Mrs. Manion, is your husband a jealous man?

2235
02:10:06,841 --> 02:10:08,405
He loves me.

2236
02:10:08,406 --> 02:10:09,969
I'm sure of that, but is
he excessively jealous?

2237
02:10:10,053 --> 02:10:12,805
Your Honor, how can the witness
answer that question?

2238
02:10:12,889 --> 02:10:14,974
What's the norm of jealousy?

2239
02:10:15,058 --> 02:10:18,060
Can you put your question a
little differently, Mr. Dancer?

2240
02:10:18,144 --> 02:10:20,187
Has your husband ever struck you
in a jealous rage?

2241
02:10:20,271 --> 02:10:22,315
No. Your Honor, I think
Mr. Dancer's fishing now.

2242
02:10:22,316 --> 02:10:24,358
What's the relevancy
of this question?

2243
02:10:24,442 --> 02:10:26,485
Your Honor,
the shoe is squeezing Mr. Biegler's foot.

2244
02:10:26,569 --> 02:10:28,779
In his own words,
this is not a high school debate...

2245
02:10:28,863 --> 02:10:30,823
this is a cross-examination
in a murder trial.

2246
02:10:30,907 --> 02:10:32,825
Proceed, Mr. Dancer.

2247
02:10:34,411 --> 02:10:36,161
Mrs. Manion...

2248
02:10:37,247 --> 02:10:40,332
did you ever go out socially
in Thunder Bay?

2249
02:10:40,417 --> 02:10:42,334
Yes, a few times.

2250
02:10:42,419 --> 02:10:44,503
When your husband's outfit
moved to Thunder Bay...

2251
02:10:44,587 --> 02:10:46,547
didn't Barney Quill throw
a cocktail party...

2252
02:10:46,631 --> 02:10:49,008
- for the officers and their wives?
- Yes.

2253
02:10:49,092 --> 02:10:52,344
Didn't your husband strike
a young second lieutenant at this party?

2254
02:10:54,097 --> 02:10:56,390
There was a little scuffle. It wasn't much.

2255
02:10:56,474 --> 02:10:59,476
- What was it about?
- I'm not sure I remember.

2256
02:10:59,561 --> 02:11:03,731
- Were you too drunk to remember?
- No, I was not.

2257
02:11:04,774 --> 02:11:07,651
I-I-I think it was because
the lieutenant...

2258
02:11:07,736 --> 02:11:10,821
was cutting in too much
when I was dancing with my husband.

2259
02:11:10,905 --> 02:11:13,073
And shortly afterwards,
on the veranda of the inn...

2260
02:11:13,158 --> 02:11:16,493
didn't your husband slap you hard enough
so that you fell against the wall?

2261
02:11:17,704 --> 02:11:21,665
- Well, h-he was drinking.
- [Dancer] Wasn't this a jealous rage?

2262
02:11:22,417 --> 02:11:25,169
- I don't know!
- Do you remember why he struck you?

2263
02:11:25,253 --> 02:11:27,171
- Yes.
- Wasn't he enraged at you...

2264
02:11:27,255 --> 02:11:29,673
because he thought you'd encouraged
this young lieutenant?

2265
02:11:29,758 --> 02:11:31,675
He might have thought so.

2266
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:33,719
Mrs. Manion,
there are witnesses to this whole affair.

2267
02:11:33,803 --> 02:11:36,013
I'll ask you again.
Wasn't this a jealous rage?

2268
02:11:36,097 --> 02:11:38,557
I guess you could call it that.

2269
02:11:39,768 --> 02:11:41,727
Now I'll ask you...

2270
02:11:43,438 --> 02:11:47,691
on the night of the shooting,
what did you swear?

2271
02:11:47,776 --> 02:11:50,235
What oath did you take on the rosary?

2272
02:11:51,279 --> 02:11:53,864
It was about Barney Quill raping me.

2273
02:11:53,948 --> 02:11:56,992
Why did you swear on the rosary
that he raped you?

2274
02:11:57,535 --> 02:12:00,120
For the reason that my husband said...
because I was hysterical.

2275
02:12:00,205 --> 02:12:02,206
That was the reason he gave
for asking you to swear.

2276
02:12:02,290 --> 02:12:04,208
- What was your reason for swearing?
- So he'd believe me.

2277
02:12:04,292 --> 02:12:06,210
- Why shouldn't he believe you?
- Objection.

2278
02:12:06,294 --> 02:12:08,545
The reason for the use of the rosary
has been established.

2279
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:11,216
These questions are immaterial.

2280
02:12:11,217 --> 02:12:13,801
No, I think I'll take
the answer, Mr. Biegler.

2281
02:12:13,885 --> 02:12:15,719
I'll ask you again, Mrs. Manion.

2282
02:12:15,804 --> 02:12:17,930
Why shouldn't he believe you?

2283
02:12:19,265 --> 02:12:21,225
Because I wasn't making much sense.

2284
02:12:21,309 --> 02:12:23,352
Did he think you'd lie
about a thing like that?

2285
02:12:23,436 --> 02:12:25,167
Objection, Your Honor!
Lieutenant Manion has

2286
02:12:25,168 --> 02:12:26,897
already testified as
to what he thought.

2287
02:12:26,981 --> 02:12:30,609
- Sustained.
- Did your husband strike you that night?

2288
02:12:31,277 --> 02:12:33,445
Did he hit you that night?

2289
02:12:35,698 --> 02:12:37,741
Well, he... he...

2290
02:12:37,826 --> 02:12:41,370
He may have slapped me
because I was hysterical.

2291
02:12:41,454 --> 02:12:44,081
And didn't you swear to a lie to keep him
from hitting you again?

2292
02:12:44,165 --> 02:12:45,791
No! No, I didn't. I did not.

2293
02:12:45,875 --> 02:12:48,127
Hadn't he already beaten you up
at the gate when he caught you...

2294
02:12:48,211 --> 02:12:49,399
coming home from lovers'
lane with Barney Quill?

2295
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:50,587
Objection! Objection!

2296
02:12:50,672 --> 02:12:53,423
The witness has already testified
she was beaten by Barney Quill.

2297
02:12:53,508 --> 02:12:55,592
- [Spectators Murmuring]
- Quiet, quiet.

2298
02:12:55,677 --> 02:12:58,428
No more questions.

2299
02:12:58,513 --> 02:13:01,098
I think the witness has had enough,
Your Honor.

2300
02:13:01,182 --> 02:13:04,268
The witness may step down.
We'll recess for lunch.

2301
02:13:04,352 --> 02:13:06,436
[Gavel Raps]

2302
02:13:06,521 --> 02:13:08,772
[Bailiff] Recess until 1:00.

2303
02:13:08,857 --> 02:13:10,399
[Gavel Raps]

2304
02:13:11,484 --> 02:13:13,402
Sorry, baby. You were fine.

2305
02:13:13,486 --> 02:13:16,822
[Bell Clanging]

2306
02:13:46,895 --> 02:13:48,812
Dr. Smith?

2307
02:13:48,897 --> 02:13:50,814
I've come to meet you, sir.

2308
02:13:50,899 --> 02:13:53,317
- My name is...
- I'm sorry. You've made a mistake.

2309
02:13:53,401 --> 02:13:56,486
Maybe I'm the one you're looking for.
Are you Mr. Biegler?

2310
02:13:56,571 --> 02:13:58,906
No, I'm his associate in the case.

2311
02:13:59,449 --> 02:14:02,159
- Don't tell me you're Dr. Smith.
- That's me.

2312
02:14:02,243 --> 02:14:06,830
- The army psychiatrist?
- Maybe you expected me to be in uniform.

2313
02:14:06,915 --> 02:14:08,832
No. Well...

2314
02:14:08,917 --> 02:14:11,668
I didn't expect anybody so young.

2315
02:14:11,753 --> 02:14:13,670
I'm 40.

2316
02:14:13,755 --> 02:14:18,675
I sort of hoped you'd, uh, have a beard
and wear a monocle.

2317
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:20,719
Oh, I see.

2318
02:14:21,346 --> 02:14:23,723
That better?

2319
02:14:23,724 --> 02:14:26,099
It helps.
You're on the stand this afternoon.

2320
02:14:28,603 --> 02:14:30,520
Doctor, have you formed an opinion...

2321
02:14:30,605 --> 02:14:32,522
as to Frederick Manion's
mental and emotional state...

2322
02:14:32,607 --> 02:14:34,524
at the time he killed Barney Quill?

2323
02:14:34,609 --> 02:14:36,526
- I have.
- And what is that opinion?

2324
02:14:36,611 --> 02:14:39,363
He was temporarily insane
at the time of the shooting.

2325
02:14:39,447 --> 02:14:41,365
At the time of the shooting,
do you believe...

2326
02:14:41,449 --> 02:14:43,867
he was able to distinguish
right from wrong?

2327
02:14:43,952 --> 02:14:46,870
He may or may not have been.
It doesn't make too much difference.

2328
02:14:46,955 --> 02:14:50,040
All right. Now, Doctor,
as clearly as you can...

2329
02:14:50,124 --> 02:14:54,002
will you explain Frederick Manion's
temporary insanity.

2330
02:14:54,087 --> 02:14:57,005
It is known as dissociative reaction...

2331
02:14:57,090 --> 02:15:01,718
a psychic shock which creates
an almost overwhelming tension...

2332
02:15:01,803 --> 02:15:05,055
which the person in shock must alleviate.

2333
02:15:05,139 --> 02:15:07,557
In Lieutenant Manion's case... a soldier...

2334
02:15:07,642 --> 02:15:10,394
it is only natural
that he would turn to action.

2335
02:15:10,478 --> 02:15:14,231
Only direct, simple action
against Barney Quill...

2336
02:15:14,315 --> 02:15:16,817
would relieve this unbearable tension.

2337
02:15:16,901 --> 02:15:20,028
This is not too uncommon.
For example, in combat...

2338
02:15:20,113 --> 02:15:23,490
some of the more remarkable heroics
take place in this state of mind.

2339
02:15:23,574 --> 02:15:25,639
Is there another name for
dissociative reaction,

2340
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:27,703
one we might be more
likely to recognize?

2341
02:15:27,787 --> 02:15:31,123
Yes, it has been known
as "irresistible impulse."

2342
02:15:31,207 --> 02:15:34,251
Now, Doctor, a man in the grip
of irresistible impulse...

2343
02:15:34,335 --> 02:15:36,753
would he be likely
to go to his neighbor for advice...

2344
02:15:36,838 --> 02:15:39,715
or call up the police to come to his aid?

2345
02:15:39,799 --> 02:15:43,427
- Completely incompatible.
- Yes. But our man was able to think...

2346
02:15:43,511 --> 02:15:45,804
of going and taking out
a gun and loading it...

2347
02:15:45,888 --> 02:15:47,889
before setting out to find Quill.

2348
02:15:47,974 --> 02:15:49,808
Well, that was his conscious mind working.

2349
02:15:49,892 --> 02:15:52,394
But if no gun had been available,
he would have gone anyway.

2350
02:15:52,478 --> 02:15:55,939
How would a man look in the grip
of dissociative reaction?

2351
02:15:56,024 --> 02:16:00,277
He might appear to be deadly calm,
fiercely deliberate.

2352
02:16:00,361 --> 02:16:03,322
Mm-hmm. Would you describe
his behavior as being...

2353
02:16:03,406 --> 02:16:05,866
like a mailman delivering the mail?

2354
02:16:05,950 --> 02:16:10,162
That's not bad. Like a mailman, he would
have a job to do, and he would do it.

2355
02:16:11,497 --> 02:16:12,581
Your witness.

2356
02:16:12,665 --> 02:16:16,585
Doctor, did you find any psychosis
in Frederick Manion?

2357
02:16:16,669 --> 02:16:17,878
I did not.

2358
02:16:17,962 --> 02:16:20,964
- [Dancer] Any neuroses?
- I found no history of neuroses.

2359
02:16:21,049 --> 02:16:24,634
- [Dancer] Any history of, uh, delusion?
- None.

2360
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:26,803
- Loss of memory?
- Not before this instance.

2361
02:16:26,888 --> 02:16:31,308
[Whispering]
Hey. Can you spot Mary Pilant?

2362
02:16:31,392 --> 02:16:33,477
She didn't come back after lunch.

2363
02:16:33,561 --> 02:16:36,313
I think you'd better give up on that one.

2364
02:16:36,397 --> 02:16:38,273
Doctor, you stated that the defendant...

2365
02:16:38,358 --> 02:16:40,318
might or might not have
been able to distinguish

2366
02:16:40,319 --> 02:16:42,277
the difference between
right and wrong...

2367
02:16:42,362 --> 02:16:43,987
but that it wouldn't have made
much difference.

2368
02:16:44,072 --> 02:16:46,448
- Am I right? Is that what you said?
- Approximately, yes.

2369
02:16:46,532 --> 02:16:48,450
Did you mean that at the time
of the shooting...

2370
02:16:48,534 --> 02:16:50,452
he could have known the difference
between right and wrong?

2371
02:16:50,536 --> 02:16:52,329
He might have, yes.

2372
02:16:52,413 --> 02:16:57,000
Dr. Smith, if the defendant
could have known what he was doing...

2373
02:16:57,085 --> 02:16:59,002
and could have known that it was wrong...

2374
02:16:59,087 --> 02:17:02,130
how can you come here and testify
that he was legally insane?

2375
02:17:02,215 --> 02:17:04,299
I'm not saying he was legally insane.

2376
02:17:04,384 --> 02:17:06,301
I'm saying that in his mental condition...

2377
02:17:06,386 --> 02:17:08,970
it would not have made any difference
whether he knew right from wrong.

2378
02:17:09,055 --> 02:17:11,056
He would still have shot Quill.

2379
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:14,684
Dr. Smith, are you willing...

2380
02:17:14,769 --> 02:17:18,188
to rest your testimony
in this case on this opinion?

2381
02:17:18,272 --> 02:17:20,232
Yes, I am.

2382
02:17:21,442 --> 02:17:23,860
Your Honor, I'd like to
ask for a short recess.

2383
02:17:23,945 --> 02:17:25,862
The attorneys for the People
would like to meet...

2384
02:17:25,947 --> 02:17:27,094
with Mr. Biegler and
the court in chambers.

2385
02:17:27,095 --> 02:17:28,240
Mr. Biegler?

2386
02:17:28,825 --> 02:17:30,659
Glad to oblige, Your Honor.

2387
02:17:30,743 --> 02:17:33,745
Short recess. Jury will remain.

2388
02:17:45,299 --> 02:17:47,384
Someday I'm going to horrify tradition...

2389
02:17:47,468 --> 02:17:53,223
and lay a dense blue cloud of tobacco smoke
in that hallowed courtroom.

2390
02:17:53,307 --> 02:17:55,517
What's on your mind, Mr. Dancer?

2391
02:17:55,601 --> 02:17:57,519
Your Honor, in view of
Dr. Smith's testimony...

2392
02:17:57,603 --> 02:18:00,063
I thought perhaps the defense might like
to change their plea.

2393
02:18:00,148 --> 02:18:02,899
- Change it to what?
- Guilty, of course.

2394
02:18:02,984 --> 02:18:05,735
- No, we'll still go for broke.
- Hell, Polly.

2395
02:18:05,820 --> 02:18:08,071
You know a guy's not
considered legally nuts in Michigan...

2396
02:18:08,156 --> 02:18:10,073
unless he didn't know right from wrong.

2397
02:18:10,158 --> 02:18:12,347
Why don't you come on
and get this over with?

2398
02:18:12,348 --> 02:18:14,536
Your Honor, would
you turn to page 486?

2399
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:16,246
[Lodwick] What's that?

2400
02:18:16,330 --> 02:18:18,999
Appears to be a law book, Mr. Lodwick.

2401
02:18:20,334 --> 02:18:22,252
[Chuckles]
Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

2402
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:25,422
I make those things
to help me think sometimes.

2403
02:18:25,506 --> 02:18:27,841
- For perch?
- No, that one's for frog.

2404
02:18:27,925 --> 02:18:29,885
What case is he citing, Judge?

2405
02:18:29,969 --> 02:18:31,950
We gig frogs down in
my part of the country.

2406
02:18:31,951 --> 02:18:33,930
Yeah, well, it's
the same up here.

2407
02:18:34,015 --> 02:18:36,766
I'm a trout man myself,
but this is a new wrinkle I'm gonna try.

2408
02:18:36,851 --> 02:18:39,060
They do it a lot
down in the bayous down south.

2409
02:18:39,145 --> 02:18:41,062
The idea...
they get a great big long pole...

2410
02:18:41,147 --> 02:18:45,650
and about a ten-pound line, just sort
of drift along a high bank in a boat.

2411
02:18:45,735 --> 02:18:48,612
Then you see that
great big old bullfrog in a crevice...

2412
02:18:48,696 --> 02:18:51,615
and you sort of float this along
in front of him.

2413
02:18:51,699 --> 02:18:53,159
Pop! That old tongue of
his snaps out and...

2414
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:54,618
[Clicks Tongue]

2415
02:18:54,702 --> 02:18:57,287
- You've got frog's legs for supper.
- Well, I'll be darned.

2416
02:18:57,371 --> 02:19:01,625
- Why don't you keep it? Try it sometime.
- Thanks. I will.

2417
02:19:01,709 --> 02:19:03,835
486.

2418
02:19:05,087 --> 02:19:09,424
- What is it, Your Honor?
- People versus Durfee, 1886.

2419
02:19:10,051 --> 02:19:11,801
Looks like a precedent.

2420
02:19:11,886 --> 02:19:14,262
Would you like to read it, Mr. Dancer?

2421
02:19:15,223 --> 02:19:17,140
No, thank you, Your Honor.

2422
02:19:17,225 --> 02:19:19,351
I think I recall the case.

2423
02:19:19,894 --> 02:19:24,356
We're, uh, hooked... like the frog.

2424
02:19:26,901 --> 02:19:30,487
[Dancer] Dr. Harcourt, where did you
receive your university training?

2425
02:19:30,571 --> 02:19:32,489
Johns Hopkins, in Baltimore, Maryland.

2426
02:19:32,573 --> 02:19:34,783
And where do you practice now?

2427
02:19:34,867 --> 02:19:38,495
I'm the medical superintendent of the
Bonder State Hospital for the Insane.

2428
02:19:38,579 --> 02:19:43,667
It's been stated here that dissociative
reaction, or irresistible impulse...

2429
02:19:43,751 --> 02:19:46,670
is not uncommon among soldiers in combat.

2430
02:19:46,754 --> 02:19:49,339
- Do you agree with that statement?
- I do...

2431
02:19:49,423 --> 02:19:51,341
but not as it was put by Dr. Smith.

2432
02:19:51,425 --> 02:19:55,345
- Where would you depart from Dr. Smith?
- Well, dissociative reaction...

2433
02:19:55,429 --> 02:19:59,349
is not something that comes out of the blue
and disappears as quickly.

2434
02:19:59,433 --> 02:20:03,520
It can only occur...
even among soldiers in combat...

2435
02:20:03,604 --> 02:20:07,524
if the individual has a psychoneurotic
condition of long standing.

2436
02:20:07,608 --> 02:20:11,361
It's been testified here that a psychiatric
examination of the defendant...

2437
02:20:11,445 --> 02:20:14,030
showed no, um, evidence of neuroses...

2438
02:20:14,115 --> 02:20:16,533
and no history of dissociative reaction.

2439
02:20:16,617 --> 02:20:18,535
You've further heard it testified...

2440
02:20:18,619 --> 02:20:23,373
that the defendant's behavior on the night
of the shooting was cool and direct.

2441
02:20:23,457 --> 02:20:25,250
As an observer, do you
remember this testimony?

2442
02:20:25,251 --> 02:20:27,043
Yes.

2443
02:20:27,128 --> 02:20:29,045
From this, have you formed an opinion...

2444
02:20:29,130 --> 02:20:31,881
about the defendant's sanity
on the night of the shooting?

2445
02:20:31,966 --> 02:20:36,386
Yes. I'm of the opinion that he was in
sufficient possession of his faculties...

2446
02:20:36,470 --> 02:20:39,222
so that he was not dominated
by his unconscious mind.

2447
02:20:39,307 --> 02:20:42,892
In other words, he was not in the
grip of irresistible impulse?

2448
02:20:42,977 --> 02:20:44,311
In my opinion, he was not.

2449
02:20:44,312 --> 02:20:45,645
Thank you, Doctor.
Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

2450
02:20:45,730 --> 02:20:48,732
Dr. Harcourt, psychiatry
is an effort to probe...

2451
02:20:48,816 --> 02:20:51,568
into the dark, undiscovered
world of the mind.

2452
02:20:51,652 --> 02:20:55,071
And in there, the world might
be round, it could be square.

2453
02:20:55,156 --> 02:20:58,033
Your opinion could be wrong.
Dr. Smith's opinion could be right.

2454
02:20:58,117 --> 02:20:59,848
Isn't that true?

2455
02:20:59,849 --> 02:21:01,578
I'd be a poor doctor if I
didn't agree with that...

2456
02:21:01,662 --> 02:21:05,081
but I believe my opinion to be right.

2457
02:21:05,166 --> 02:21:07,459
Now, do you think you might have
changed your opinion...

2458
02:21:07,543 --> 02:21:10,462
if you had examined the defendant,
as Dr. Smith did?

2459
02:21:11,130 --> 02:21:12,714
I don't believe so.

2460
02:21:12,798 --> 02:21:15,884
But Dr. Smith's opinion was made under
better circumstances, wasn't it?

2461
02:21:15,968 --> 02:21:19,012
If you mean that he was able
to examine the man, yes.

2462
02:21:19,096 --> 02:21:20,930
Yeah. Well, thank you, Doctor.

2463
02:21:21,015 --> 02:21:24,267
That's all, Dr. Harcourt.
ls there more rebuttal?

2464
02:21:24,352 --> 02:21:26,603
We're over a barrel, Mitch.

2465
02:21:26,687 --> 02:21:28,813
We have to use him.

2466
02:21:29,357 --> 02:21:31,900
We call Duane Miller to the stand.

2467
02:21:31,984 --> 02:21:34,152
Will the sheriff please
bring in the witness?

2468
02:21:40,534 --> 02:21:42,494
What can he tell?

2469
02:21:43,204 --> 02:21:44,704
Nothing.

2470
02:21:45,706 --> 02:21:47,666
He can't tell anything.

2471
02:21:58,469 --> 02:22:00,095
Raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear

2472
02:22:00,096 --> 02:22:01,721
the testimony you shall
give in this cause...

2473
02:22:01,806 --> 02:22:05,350
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

2474
02:22:05,434 --> 02:22:07,018
I do.

2475
02:22:08,729 --> 02:22:11,648
- Would you state your name, please.
- Duane Miller.

2476
02:22:11,732 --> 02:22:13,525
Most folks call me Duke.

2477
02:22:13,526 --> 02:22:15,318
Where do you presently
reside, Mr. Miller?

2478
02:22:15,403 --> 02:22:17,320
Across the alley in the jail.

2479
02:22:17,405 --> 02:22:19,239
You know the defendant, Frederick Manion?

2480
02:22:19,323 --> 02:22:21,033
Yeah, I got to know him
in the past few weeks.

2481
02:22:21,034 --> 02:22:22,742
His cell's right next to mine.

2482
02:22:22,827 --> 02:22:25,245
When was the last conversation
you had with the lieutenant?

2483
02:22:25,329 --> 02:22:29,040
Except for "hello" this morning,
the last time was last night.

2484
02:22:29,125 --> 02:22:32,544
- Did you discuss his trial last night?
- Yeah, some.

2485
02:22:32,628 --> 02:22:35,880
Would you tell the court what Lieutenant
Manion had to say about the trial?

2486
02:22:35,965 --> 02:22:39,551
Well, I said, uh,
"Things looking up, Lieutenant?"

2487
02:22:39,635 --> 02:22:42,554
And he said, "I got it made, buster."

2488
02:22:42,638 --> 02:22:46,891
He said, "I fooled my lawyer.
I fooled that headshrinker.

2489
02:22:46,976 --> 02:22:49,686
I'm gonna fool that bunch
of corn cobbers on the jury."

2490
02:22:49,770 --> 02:22:52,689
You're a liar!
You're a lousy, stinkin' liar!

2491
02:22:52,773 --> 02:22:54,774
[Whispers] Come on. Come on.

2492
02:22:54,859 --> 02:22:56,401
Take it easy.

2493
02:22:57,361 --> 02:23:00,363
I apologize for my client, Your Honor.

2494
02:23:00,448 --> 02:23:02,365
Yet his outburst is almost excusable...

2495
02:23:02,450 --> 02:23:05,368
since the prosecution
has seen fit to put a felon on the stand...

2496
02:23:05,453 --> 02:23:07,746
to testify against an officer
in the United States Army.

2497
02:23:07,830 --> 02:23:12,459
Your Honor, I don't know who is
the worse offender, Manion or his lawyer.

2498
02:23:12,543 --> 02:23:14,544
We're close to the end.

2499
02:23:14,628 --> 02:23:20,258
In the name of heaven, let's have peace
and courtesy for these last few hours.

2500
02:23:20,342 --> 02:23:25,388
Mr. Dancer, you will continue
your interrogation without comment.

2501
02:23:25,473 --> 02:23:28,391
Mr. Biegler, you will not
sound off at every opportunity...

2502
02:23:28,476 --> 02:23:31,561
and the defendant will remain seated
in his chair and keep his mouth shut.

2503
02:23:31,645 --> 02:23:34,063
- Now go ahead.
- Mr. Miller...

2504
02:23:34,148 --> 02:23:36,733
are you certain that
Lieutenant Manion said...

2505
02:23:36,817 --> 02:23:40,236
- "I've got it made, buster"?
- That's what he said.

2506
02:23:40,321 --> 02:23:42,405
Mr. Miller,
did Lieutenant Manion say anything else?

2507
02:23:42,490 --> 02:23:44,574
Yes, sir. He said when he got out...

2508
02:23:44,658 --> 02:23:49,120
the first thing he was gonna do was to
kick that bitch from here to kingdom come.

2509
02:23:50,372 --> 02:23:53,166
- [Dancer] To whom was he referring?
- To his wife.

2510
02:23:54,126 --> 02:23:55,794
Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

2511
02:23:56,629 --> 02:23:58,421
What are you in jail for, Mr. Miller?

2512
02:23:58,506 --> 02:24:01,090
Arson. I copped out,
and I'm waiting for a sentence.

2513
02:24:01,175 --> 02:24:03,384
And how many other offenses
have you committed?

2514
02:24:03,469 --> 02:24:06,805
Well, I was in reform school when
I was a kid, but that's all.

2515
02:24:07,348 --> 02:24:09,933
Your Honor,
I'd like to see this man's criminal record.

2516
02:24:10,017 --> 02:24:12,060
Do you have his record, Mr. Lodwick?

2517
02:24:12,144 --> 02:24:13,645
Yes, sir.

2518
02:24:14,355 --> 02:24:16,314
Here it is.

2519
02:24:18,859 --> 02:24:20,777
Well, your record here
shows you've been in prison...

2520
02:24:20,861 --> 02:24:23,655
six times in three different states.

2521
02:24:24,365 --> 02:24:26,282
You were in three times for arson...

2522
02:24:26,367 --> 02:24:30,078
twice for assault with a deadly weapon,
once for larceny.

2523
02:24:30,871 --> 02:24:34,958
Yeah. Also shows you've done
short stretches in four city jails...

2524
02:24:35,042 --> 02:24:38,795
on charges of indecent exposure,
window peeping...

2525
02:24:38,879 --> 02:24:42,090
perjury and disorderly conduct.

2526
02:24:42,883 --> 02:24:44,926
Is this your true record?

2527
02:24:45,553 --> 02:24:47,637
Them things are never right.

2528
02:24:47,721 --> 02:24:50,974
How did you get the ear of the prosecution
in order to tell them...

2529
02:24:51,058 --> 02:24:53,476
about this conversation you had
with Lieutenant Manion?

2530
02:24:53,561 --> 02:24:56,521
- The D.A. was taking us to his office.
- Taking who to his office?

2531
02:24:56,605 --> 02:24:58,211
Us prisoners in the jail.

2532
02:24:58,212 --> 02:24:59,816
He take you all at
once, or one at a time?

2533
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:01,818
One at a time.

2534
02:25:01,902 --> 02:25:04,153
Him and that other lawyer
took us to his office...

2535
02:25:04,238 --> 02:25:06,990
and asked us questions
about Lieutenant Manion.

2536
02:25:07,074 --> 02:25:09,409
Were you promised a lighter sentence
if you came over here...

2537
02:25:09,493 --> 02:25:12,120
- and went on the witness stand?
- [Dancer] Your Honor, the People object...

2538
02:25:12,204 --> 02:25:13,830
Overruled. Answer the question.

2539
02:25:13,914 --> 02:25:15,832
- I wasn't promised anything.
- Oh, you just thought...

2540
02:25:15,916 --> 02:25:19,502
it would help your own troubles if you
dreamed up this story to please the D.A.?

2541
02:25:19,587 --> 02:25:21,046
I didn't dream up nothin'.

2542
02:25:21,047 --> 02:25:22,505
You're sure that's what
Lieutenant Manion said?

2543
02:25:22,590 --> 02:25:24,216
Yeah, I'm sure.

2544
02:25:24,217 --> 02:25:25,842
Just as sure as you were
about your criminal record?

2545
02:25:25,926 --> 02:25:29,053
Well, I guess I kind of goofed on that one.

2546
02:25:30,931 --> 02:25:36,185
Your Honor, I don't feel I can dignify
this creature with any more questions.

2547
02:25:36,270 --> 02:25:38,313
Take the witness away.

2548
02:25:38,397 --> 02:25:40,857
Mr. Biegler, would you
like a conference with your client?

2549
02:25:40,941 --> 02:25:44,027
I can see how the last witness
was quite a surprise.

2550
02:25:44,111 --> 02:25:46,529
No, Your Honor.
We don't need a conference.

2551
02:25:46,614 --> 02:25:49,407
I'll recall Lieutenant Manion
to the stand right now.

2552
02:25:57,458 --> 02:26:00,919
Now you've heard the
testimony of this Miller.

2553
02:26:01,629 --> 02:26:03,379
Is any part of it true?

2554
02:26:03,464 --> 02:26:04,964
None.

2555
02:26:05,466 --> 02:26:09,969
Lieutenant, do you have any idea why he
might come here with a tale like that?

2556
02:26:10,054 --> 02:26:11,596
No, sir.

2557
02:26:13,307 --> 02:26:15,558
Have you ever talked with this man?

2558
02:26:15,643 --> 02:26:17,060
Yes.

2559
02:26:17,603 --> 02:26:19,354
And what did you talk about?

2560
02:26:21,315 --> 02:26:23,399
Nothing important.

2561
02:26:23,484 --> 02:26:25,381
Certainly nothing...

2562
02:26:25,382 --> 02:26:27,278
nothing about my personal
life or my feelings.

2563
02:26:27,988 --> 02:26:29,572
That's all I wanted to know.

2564
02:26:29,657 --> 02:26:31,324
Lieutenant Manion...

2565
02:26:32,326 --> 02:26:35,244
have you ever had any sort of...

2566
02:26:35,329 --> 02:26:37,789
trouble with, uh, Miller?

2567
02:26:38,749 --> 02:26:41,542
I don't know. What do you mean?
An argument? Something like that?

2568
02:26:41,627 --> 02:26:46,130
Well, did you ever, um, attack Miller...
physically attack him?

2569
02:26:46,757 --> 02:26:49,300
Your lawyer can't answer the
question for you, Lieutenant.

2570
02:26:49,385 --> 02:26:51,302
Did you ever physically attack Miller?

2571
02:26:51,387 --> 02:26:53,972
Well, I wouldn't call it an attack exactly.

2572
02:26:54,056 --> 02:26:55,599
I pushed his head
against the bars one day.

2573
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:57,141
Why?

2574
02:26:57,226 --> 02:26:59,310
He said something ugly about my wife.

2575
02:26:59,395 --> 02:27:03,022
And do you remember, uh, pushing or
bumping his head against the bars?

2576
02:27:03,107 --> 02:27:05,274
Well, sure. I just told you.

2577
02:27:05,359 --> 02:27:07,652
Then this was not dissociative reaction?

2578
02:27:07,736 --> 02:27:09,112
The defendant isn't
qualified to answer that.

2579
02:27:09,113 --> 02:27:10,488
[Judge Weaver] Sustained.

2580
02:27:10,572 --> 02:27:14,325
Lieutenant Manion,
wasn't your action against Barney Quill...

2581
02:27:14,410 --> 02:27:16,327
much the same as your
action against Miller...

2582
02:27:16,412 --> 02:27:19,998
and against the lieutenant
that you struck at the cocktail party...

2583
02:27:20,082 --> 02:27:24,502
all in the heat of anger, with a willful,
conscious desire to hurt or kill?

2584
02:27:24,586 --> 02:27:27,171
I don't remember my action against Quill.

2585
02:27:28,257 --> 02:27:31,843
How long had you known your wife
was running around with Barney Quill?

2586
02:27:33,262 --> 02:27:35,263
I never knew anything like that.

2587
02:27:36,223 --> 02:27:37,849
I trust my wife.

2588
02:27:38,684 --> 02:27:41,519
I suppose you just beat her up occasionally
just for the fun of it.

2589
02:27:41,603 --> 02:27:45,023
Nothing has been established
to permit a question like that.

2590
02:27:45,107 --> 02:27:47,358
He keeps implying things
without ever getting to the point.

2591
02:27:47,443 --> 02:27:50,695
Let him ask the lieutenant,
did he ever beat his wife.

2592
02:27:50,779 --> 02:27:52,739
[Judge Weaver]
I'll sustain the objection.

2593
02:27:52,823 --> 02:27:55,700
Would you like to rephrase
your question, Mr. Dancer?

2594
02:27:56,952 --> 02:27:58,870
No, thank you, Your Honor.

2595
02:27:59,455 --> 02:28:01,372
I've finished.

2596
02:28:01,457 --> 02:28:05,460
Well, then I'll ask him. Did you,
Lieutenant Manion, ever beat your wife...

2597
02:28:05,544 --> 02:28:07,795
on the night of the shooting,
or at any other time?

2598
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:09,881
- No, sir.
- Is there any doubt in your mind...

2599
02:28:09,965 --> 02:28:12,258
that Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2600
02:28:12,342 --> 02:28:13,801
- No, sir.
- That's all.

2601
02:28:13,886 --> 02:28:15,887
Step down, Lieutenant.

2602
02:28:22,061 --> 02:28:24,562
- Are we hurt?
- We're hurt bad.

2603
02:28:24,646 --> 02:28:26,564
[Whispering] Paul.

2604
02:28:26,648 --> 02:28:28,566
[Whispering]

2605
02:28:30,152 --> 02:28:32,111
Your Honor, I know time is very pressing.

2606
02:28:32,196 --> 02:28:34,113
I don't want to ask for a recess.

2607
02:28:34,198 --> 02:28:36,240
I would like to leave
the courtroom for a moment.

2608
02:28:36,325 --> 02:28:38,910
If it's important,
we can be at ease for a minute.

2609
02:28:38,994 --> 02:28:40,495
Thank you, sir.

2610
02:28:41,663 --> 02:28:43,915
This is highly irregular, Your Honor.

2611
02:28:43,999 --> 02:28:47,085
Well, there's no reason
to make a federal case out of it.

2612
02:28:57,971 --> 02:28:59,889
Thank you very much, Your Honor.

2613
02:28:59,973 --> 02:29:02,058
We now have another rebuttal witness.

2614
02:29:02,142 --> 02:29:04,227
The defense calls Mary Pilant to the stand.

2615
02:29:04,311 --> 02:29:06,395
Your Honor, we must protest
this whole affair.

2616
02:29:06,480 --> 02:29:09,398
The noble defense attorney
rushes out to a secret conference...

2617
02:29:09,483 --> 02:29:12,527
and now the last-minute witness is being
brought dramatically down the aisle.

2618
02:29:12,611 --> 02:29:15,863
The whole thing has obviously been rigged
to unduly excite the jury.

2619
02:29:15,948 --> 02:29:18,074
It's just another one
of Mr. Biegler's cornball tricks.

2620
02:29:18,158 --> 02:29:21,410
Your Honor, I don't blame
Mr. Dancer for feeling put upon.

2621
02:29:21,495 --> 02:29:24,413
I'm just a humble country lawyer
trying to do the best I can...

2622
02:29:24,498 --> 02:29:28,126
against this brilliant prosecutor
from the big city of Lansing.

2623
02:29:28,210 --> 02:29:29,961
Swear the witness.

2624
02:29:30,504 --> 02:29:32,421
Raise your right hand, please.

2625
02:29:32,506 --> 02:29:34,924
You do solemnly swear the testimony
you shall give in this cause...

2626
02:29:35,008 --> 02:29:38,427
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

2627
02:29:38,512 --> 02:29:40,471
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

2628
02:29:43,225 --> 02:29:44,934
Where do you live, Miss Pilant?

2629
02:29:45,018 --> 02:29:46,894
At the Thunder Bay Inn, in Thunder Bay.

2630
02:29:46,979 --> 02:29:50,106
- And how long have you lived there?
- For two years.

2631
02:29:50,190 --> 02:29:53,025
- And what's your profession?
- I manage the inn.

2632
02:29:53,110 --> 02:29:57,613
Now, Miss Pilant, how is the laundry
handled at Thunder Bay Inn?

2633
02:29:57,698 --> 02:29:59,615
It's chuted down to the laundry room.

2634
02:29:59,700 --> 02:30:02,451
Where is the location of that chute
on the second floor?

2635
02:30:02,536 --> 02:30:06,122
- Between room 42 and 43.
- Who lives in those rooms?

2636
02:30:06,206 --> 02:30:09,959
I live in 42. Mr. Quill lived in 43.

2637
02:30:10,043 --> 02:30:12,628
Now, would Mr. Quill,
coming up from the lobby...

2638
02:30:12,713 --> 02:30:16,757
have to pass by the mouth of that chute
on the way to his room?

2639
02:30:16,842 --> 02:30:17,508
Yes.

2640
02:30:17,593 --> 02:30:21,095
Would it be very easy for him to drop
something into that chute as he passed by?

2641
02:30:21,180 --> 02:30:22,138
Yes.

2642
02:30:22,222 --> 02:30:25,892
Have you ever had occasion to go down
into the laundry at any time?

2643
02:30:25,976 --> 02:30:29,520
Yes. Part of my job is to sort
various pieces of laundry...

2644
02:30:29,605 --> 02:30:31,981
as they come out of
the wash-and-dry machine.

2645
02:30:32,065 --> 02:30:33,983
Would you tell the court what you found...

2646
02:30:34,067 --> 02:30:37,486
among those pieces of laundry
on the day after Mr. Quill was killed?

2647
02:30:37,571 --> 02:30:39,822
I found a pair of women's panties.

2648
02:30:39,907 --> 02:30:43,201
- What did you do with them?
- I threw them in the rag bin.

2649
02:30:43,285 --> 02:30:46,662
When did you learn
the significance of those panties?

2650
02:30:46,747 --> 02:30:49,123
Here. This morning in the courtroom.

2651
02:30:49,208 --> 02:30:51,834
And then you went home
and got them out of the rag bin?

2652
02:30:51,919 --> 02:30:53,669
- Yes.
- Did you bring them with you?

2653
02:30:53,754 --> 02:30:55,254
Yes.

2654
02:30:57,257 --> 02:31:00,676
I offer this article of lingerie...

2655
02:31:00,761 --> 02:31:03,179
as exhibit number one for the defense.

2656
02:31:03,263 --> 02:31:06,891
They're white,
they have lace up the side...

2657
02:31:07,935 --> 02:31:09,852
and they're badly torn...

2658
02:31:09,937 --> 02:31:13,689
as if they'd been ripped apart
by powerful hands.

2659
02:31:13,774 --> 02:31:15,733
The label reads...

2660
02:31:16,944 --> 02:31:19,946
"Smart Shop, Phoenix, Arizona."

2661
02:31:20,030 --> 02:31:23,282
If there is no objection,
the exhibit will be received in evidence.

2662
02:31:23,367 --> 02:31:24,367
That's all, Miss Pilant.

2663
02:31:24,451 --> 02:31:26,119
Did you ever talk to Mr.
Lodwick, the prosecuting

2664
02:31:26,120 --> 02:31:27,787
attorney, about the
death of Barney Quill?

2665
02:31:27,871 --> 02:31:31,290
Yes. He came to the hotel several times
after Mr. Quill was killed.

2666
02:31:31,375 --> 02:31:34,710
Did you tell Mr. Lodwick that you didn't
believe Barney Quill had raped Mrs. Manion?

2667
02:31:34,795 --> 02:31:36,837
- Yes, I told him that.
- Now, Miss Pilant...

2668
02:31:36,922 --> 02:31:39,048
did you ever talk to Mr. Biegler,
the defense attorney?

2669
02:31:39,132 --> 02:31:39,840
Yes.

2670
02:31:39,925 --> 02:31:42,260
Was this also in connection with
the shooting of Quill? - Yes.

2671
02:31:42,344 --> 02:31:44,845
Did you tell him you didn't believe
Barney Quill had raped Mrs. Manion?

2672
02:31:44,930 --> 02:31:45,510
Yes.

2673
02:31:45,511 --> 02:31:46,889
How many times did you
talk to Mr. Biegler?

2674
02:31:46,974 --> 02:31:48,891
- Twice.
- When was the last time?

2675
02:31:48,976 --> 02:31:51,394
- Last night.
- And have you now changed your mind?

2676
02:31:51,478 --> 02:31:54,063
Do you now believe
Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2677
02:31:54,147 --> 02:31:56,732
I... I don't know now.
I think he might have.

2678
02:31:56,817 --> 02:31:58,734
When did you change your mind?
Last night?

2679
02:31:58,819 --> 02:32:00,736
No. No, it was here, this morning.

2680
02:32:00,821 --> 02:32:02,863
When were you given the panties?
Was that last night?

2681
02:32:02,948 --> 02:32:05,075
Now wait a minute!
Now just wait a minute.

2682
02:32:05,076 --> 02:32:07,201
Use the proper form of

- No.

last night or at any other time.

I found them exactly as I said.

2688

Do you know for a fact that Barney Quill
dropped the panties down the chute...

- I assumed it.

Had you thought that perhaps someone
else might have put the panties there...

found in the laundry?

I hadn't thought of that.

Mm-hmm. And in the grip of what Mr. Biegler
might call irresistible impulse...

2694

you rushed in here with the panties...

2695
02:32:35,856 --> 02:32:38,274
because you wanted to crucify the character
of the dead Barney Quill.

- No. I thought it was my duty.

Yes, Mr. Dancer, I myself
would like to know what you're driving at.

Miss Pilant, when you found the panties...

2702
02:32:55,083 --> 02:32:58,669
was your first thought that Barney Quill
might have raped Mrs. Manion...

2703
02:32:58,754 --> 02:33:02,590
or was it that he might
have been stepping out with Mrs. Manion?

Miss Pilant, were you
Barney Quill's mistress?

No! No, I was not!

You know it's common knowledge
in Thunder Bay you were living with Quill?

2711

That's not true! Barney Quill was...

2712

Was what, Miss Pilant?

2713

Barney Quill was what, Miss Pilant?

2714
