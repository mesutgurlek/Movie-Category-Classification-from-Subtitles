to be famous.

for better things.

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,410
I had a calling.

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,590
I just didn't know

Can't fucking act.

10
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,680
Kind of running out
of choices really,

( Baby cooing )

35
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,090
There was nothing wonky
about my upbringing.

36
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,630
My parents were decent,

37

respectable and upstanding
members of society.

38
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,390

I kept my head down.

40
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,640
So like most kids,

41
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,600
I got into trouble.

42
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,480
You bastard!

43
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,350
I liked it.

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,250
Mrs. Peterson, I really must
talk to you about Michael.

49
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,420
But I wasn't bad.

50
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,380
I wasn't bad bad.

51
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,010
And I still have my principles.

52
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,890
I took the first job
I could get my hands on.

53
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,690
Bring the fries, Peterson.

54
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,230
I suppose the crumpet
wasn't bad.

( Doorbell rings )

56
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,930
Mrs. Peterson,

57
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,850
we'd like to have
a word with your son.

58
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,480
Michael.

Michael Peterson.

60
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,070
Right.

61
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,700
Yeah, before I forget,

62
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,540
I did come into this world
as Michael Peterson.

63
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,960
But I'll go out
with my fighting name...

64
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,040
Charlie Bronson.

65
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,380
Which is my alter ego.

66
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,430
( Screaming )

67
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,560
1974...

68
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,690
tough time
to be young in England.

69
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,610
Not a lot of opportunity around.

70
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,120
Still, life moves on.

71
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,750
Irene and I got hitched.

72
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,580
- ( Baby crying )
- It was all right.

73
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,420
We didn't have it bad
for a couple from the chippy.

74
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,510
But they don't give you
a star on the walk of fame

75
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,300
for "not bad," do they?

76
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,090
( Crying )

77
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,140
( metal clangs )

78
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,600
Michael, what is that noise?

79
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,730
For God's sakes.

80
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,200
So this is the post office

81
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,080
I did over.

82
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,740
This is what I got away with.

83
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,870
( Coins rattling )

84
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,540
And this is what they gave me.

85
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,750
Seven years!

86
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,050
Mother:
Don't worry, son.

87
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,430
You won't do the seven.
You'll be out in four.

88
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,340
( Door locks )

89
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,560

- ( laughing )
- ( audience laughing )

91
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,080
I had you going, didn't I?
Huh?

92
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,210
Go on!
I had you going!

93
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,460
I've always fancied myself
as a bit of a comedian.

94
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,840
But seven years

95
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,930
is a long time.

96
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,020
( laughs )

97
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,270
Now I'm not gonna
stand here, right, and tell you...

98
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,770
tell you that prison

99
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,770
is "not bad."

100
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,570
No, that would be
misrepresenting myself.

101
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,570
And I think enough of that
has been done already,

102
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,530
don't you?

103
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,700
No.

104
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,330
You see, I didn't see
a cell, a cage

105
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,090
or a box.

106
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,840
To me, it was a hotel room.

For most people,

110
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,530
prison is tough.

111
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,780
A monotonous nightmare.

112
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,120
24 hours a day,

113
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,580
seven days a week,

114
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,080
365 days a year

115
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,840
of pure, unadulterated,

116
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,800
living, breathing hell.

117

( Man wailing )

118

Charles:
But for me,

119
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,140
prison was finally a place

120
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,810
where I could sharpen my tools,

121
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,110
hone my skills.

122
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,610
It's like a battleground,
isn't it?

123
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,070
It was an opportunity

124
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,410
and a place where soon
every native

125
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,740
was gonna know my name.

126
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,550
What's the matter, Charlie?

127
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,090
Do you want me to take
you through it again?

128
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,470
No, we don't do work
in long-term prisons.

129
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,310
It's vocational training
so you can get a job when-.

What's the problem, Peterson?

133
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,210
Problem?

134
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,130
I said, what's the problem,
Peterson?

135
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,760

I don't have a problem.

Fuck that. I loved it!

It was exciting.
It was on the edge.

The problem is
once you get comfortable,

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,680
or sometimes even before,
they ghost you again

349
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,340
Well, that told me.

350
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,390
Truth be told, though,
they didn't want me

351
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,310
in there anymore anyway.

352
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:43,560
Apparently, I've managed
to cost the system

353
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,440
tens of millions of pounds
in damage.

354
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,110
And her majesty no longer
wanted to pleasure herself

355
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,950
with Britain's most
expensive prisoner.

356
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,910
I know. It's not the moniker
that I was looking for,

357
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,040
but what were they gonna do?

358
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,000
I mean, they couldn't let
a loony run around for free.

359
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,130
Oh yeah.

360
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:12,260
They had a dirty trick
up their sleeve.

361
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,800
They only went
and certified me sane,

362
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,800
didn't they?

363
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:21,220
So before I knew it,
I was back on the streets again.

364
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,390
( laughs )

365
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,690
But Charlie B.
ain't no fucking pillow biter.

366
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:29,110
Oh, no.
So it was time

367
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,440
to suck up the free air

368
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,200
and see what the world
had to offer me.

369
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,980
Very funny, boys.

370
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,780
Right.

371
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,080
It's been a pleasure.

372
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,730
Look at you. Dad.

373
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,320
Hi, son.

374
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,830
( Door rattling )

375
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,630

( door lock jiggling )

377
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,490
Come on in, son.

378
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,040
That's right.
I'll show you your room,

379
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,330
and then we'll have
a nice cup of tea.

380
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,340
Come on, son.

381
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,680
That's right.

382
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,060
Oh, look, it's me.

383
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,520
I was very small.

384
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,830
Where's all my stuff?

385
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,790
We couldn't bring
everything, Michael.

386
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,250
That was Luton.

387
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,880
What, all of it?

388
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,430
We kept some.

389
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,680
Where's my bed?

390
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,850
No, not this one.
The other one,

391
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,480
what I had when I was a child.

392
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,900
We couldn't keep
everything, Michael.

393
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,690
We don't have the room.

394
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,380
Is my bed still in Luton?

395
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,210
Luton...

396
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,880
never changes, does it?

397
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:29,350
Now my mom once said,
"Stick with what you know."

398
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,060
And I knew two things.

399
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,810
I knew Luton
and I knew Uncle Jack.

400
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,520
And Uncle Jack knew everyone.

401
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:42,150
And anyone he didn't know
wasn't worth knowing.

402
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,790
Going on holiday?

403
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,080
No.

404
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,840
Something better than that.
I'm gonna make a name for myself.

405
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,800
Oh, yeah, doing what?

406
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,260
I'm gonna kill the queen.

407
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,930
So you're off to London then?

408
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,680
No.

409
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,810
Luton's where it's at.

410
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,780
( Door rattling )

411
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,540

( door opens )

415
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:49,400
Well, fuck me inside out.

416
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,570
Come in, my dear boy.
You're just in time for cocktails.

417
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,380
Uncle Jack:
Hello.

418
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,210
Hello.

419
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,380
Luton calling.

420
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:12,720
Ladies and gentlemen
in ladies' attire,

421
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,600
allow me to present
my favorite nephew,

422
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,680
newly relieved
of Her Majesty's pleasure,

423
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:21,180
Mickey Peterson.

424
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,350
Sit down, my dear boy.

425
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,610
I'll sit there.

426
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,690
How are you?

427
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,940
Miss gorgeous here

428
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,780
will get you a cocktail.

429
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,740
Michael.

430
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:41,500
It's very exciting to meet you.

431
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,630
Our Jack here, he says
you're quite a celebrity on the inside.

432
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,800
Mmm.

433
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,260
Oh. Thank you.

434
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,560
It's a complete turnoff.

435
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,100
Mm-hmm.

436
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,150
Your face rug.

437
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,780
Be like kissing a fanny.

438
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,900
Ooh.

439
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:17,780
That's an outstanding
set of mustaches.

440
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:20,120
I admire your dedication.

441
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,740
Mmm.

442
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:25,420
I always knew you had
an artistic bent.

443
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,260
Woman:
So, big boy,

444
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,090
what does the future hold
for Michael Peterson?

445
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,930
Ooh.

446
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,170
Ambition is the virtue

447
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:13,210
of all great men.

448
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,600
He's going to stay here with us.

449
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:24,220
All right, my pets?

450
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,690
Say the more the merrier.

451
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:31,650
For as long as you like.

452
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,980
( Slurping )

453
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,370
That's very strong.

454
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,960
It's wonderful.

455
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,550
Charles: Uncle Jack always had
his ear to the ground.

456
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,800
And it turns out, there was an old prison
mate of mine in Luton too.

457
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:02,010
( Dance music playing )

458
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,730
- Peterson.
- This your gaff?

459
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,140
Yes.

460
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,690
How much you get?

461
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,190
10 years.

462
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,980
Fucking hell.

463
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,990
Make Mickey a cup
of tea, please.

464

( Mumbling )

465

Let's fuck.

466
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,760
So are you interested?

467
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,340
Of course I fucking am.

468
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,890
You're looking good, Mickey.

469
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,560
Fit, strong,

470
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,690
powerful.

471
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:56,190
You can make some money.

472
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,190
Serious money.

473
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,490
All you need's a name.

474
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,910
What's wrong
with Mickey Peterson?

475
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,660
No, you need a fighting name.

476
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,830
Like a movie star.

477
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,170
Oh, right.

478
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,680

Charlton Heston.

Look, love,

481
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:36,310
nobody gives a toss
about Charlton Heston.

482

The man's a cunt.

483
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,490
You're more
the Charles Bronson type.

484
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,240
Charles Bronson.

485

Yes, "Death Wish."

That's you down
to a tee, perfect.

Charlie, love, you need to build
your audience.

I gave you fucking magic
in there.

- for 10 minutes.
- I won't.

All right?

567
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,900

I've been thinking...

You're a very
sweet man, Charlie.

571
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,760
...about-about you.

572
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:15,140
Yeah, but you've
got no ambition.

573
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:17,640
You know what I mean?

574
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,070
Bought you this.

Well...

583

for a reason, don't it?

that lovely lady
in the jewelry shop

594
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:14,640
waited exactly 15 minutes.

595
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,140
But it didn't take them
15 minutes to find me.

596
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,600
We'd been expecting them.

Charles Bronson is it now?

600
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,740
An American Mongolian pop star.

601
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,700
Film star, sir.
"Death Wish."

602
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:18,740
Bloody good, as it happens.

603
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:22,160
Yeah, I'm sure, Webber.
I'm sure, thank you.

604
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:24,460
So...

605
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,500
69 days, was it?

606
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:32,300
69 days all to yourself.

607
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,180
Another of your prison
records broken.

608
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,430
So tell me, Charles Bronson,

609
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,100
what exactly did
you do with yourself

610
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:45,690
for these 69 days?

611
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,770
I was building an empire.

612

( Door opens )

614
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:26,640
Good morning, Charlie.
Something to read?

615
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:30,400
Got another Jilly Cooper.

616
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,570
Tell me how you got on
with "Who Dares Wins" then.

617
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,740
I've heard it's really good.

618
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,400
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- No problem, Charlie.

619
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,870
Shut the fuck up, you cunt!

620
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:43,290
Shut it!

621
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,340
Right.

622
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:59,720
Now I've got
a librarian up here.

623
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:04,720
And he's in a lot of trouble.

624
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,350
So I think you should send
someone up

625
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,350
to help him out, don't you?

626
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,570
Man: For fuck's sake,
he's at it again.

627
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:16,400
Man ♪2: He's got a hostage.
Get the governor!

628
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:19,200
Right.

629
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,360
Sit down.

630
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:26,580
Not there! On the fucking
karzy, you cunt!

631
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:52,600
What happens now?

632
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:54,900
Um...

633
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:56,900
I don't know.

634
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,910
Well, I guess we'll
just have to...

635
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:05,870
we'll have to wait.

636
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:10,870
I can wait all day.
I'm not going anywhere.

637
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,130
You're not going anywhere,
you fucking cunt.

638
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:15,380
We'll just fucking wait.
I'll wait.

639
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:24,050

640
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:31,060
( telephone ringing )

641
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,290
- Hello.
- Hello, Charlie.

642
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,750
- Can you hear me?
- Of course I can fucking hear you.

643
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:00,260
There's nothing wrong
with my hearing, you cunt.

644
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,510
What is it, Charlie?

645
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:06,140
What is it, Charlie?

646
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,140
Well...

647
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:12,140
I am sitting here with...

648
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,560
what's your name?

649
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:17,400
- Love.
- Love?!

650
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,400
- Andy Love.
- Oh, Andy Love.

651
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:22,070
Yeah?

652
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,990
All right, I'm sitting here

653
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,570
with Andy Love.

654
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,780
And I'm gonna snap
his fucking neck

655
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:32,830
and stick his head up
his ass if I don't get what I want!

656
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,330
What do you want?

657

What do I want?

658
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,970
What have you got?

659
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:49,010
Well...

660
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:52,850
that's entirely up to you,

661
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,850
isn't it?

662
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:58,560
We're done. You can fuck off.
I've had enough.

663
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:06,070
All right...

664
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:10,370
Andy Love.

665
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:13,160
Are you a family man?

666
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:17,000
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

667
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:19,920
- I got two kids.
- Two kids, yeah?

668
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:23,050
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

669
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:25,920
What does it fucking look like
I'm doing, you cunt?

670
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:29,430
- Look, let's-let's talk.
- No, I'm done talking.

671
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:32,220
Fucking pointless.

672
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:34,680
- Wait-
- Wait for what?

673
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:37,640
Right.

674
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:39,400
- That's it.
- What are you gonna do now?

675
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,650
What am I gonna do?

676
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,820
I'm gonna put my
fucking body paint on.

677
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,940
That's what I'm gonna do.

678
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:49,820
Get my body armor, all right?

679
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,910
Fucking hell.

680
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,740
Let's have it.

681
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:56,830
Go on, get some of that rubbed on
my back, you cunt.

682
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,330
- What?
- Get it on my fucking back.

683
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,540
Rub it in, you slag!

684
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:04,590
Go on, rub it in.
That's right. We ain't got all day.

685
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,260
Rub it right down my back.

686
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,340
Down my back and my legs.

687
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:09,930
Back of my legs, on my ass.

688
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:11,890
On my ass cheeks.
On my ass.

689
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:14,850
Not in my ass, you fucking homo!
On it.

690
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:18,060
Quickly. Quicker.
Quicker. Quicker!

691
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:19,980
Quicker! Quicker!
Quicker! Quicker!

692
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,900
Quicker! Quicker!
Fuck off!

693
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:25,230
Sit down in the corner.
Don't move, cunt!

694
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:30,280
Now hang on
to your fillings, right?

695
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:33,120
'Cause it's gonna
get fucking hairy.

696
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:37,580
- Come here.
- Fuck off, you cunt!

697
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,170
( Shouting )

698
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:09,360
( door opens )

699
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,120
Governor:
All right, Charlie Bronson.

700
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:18,580
I'll get straight to the point.

701
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:21,120
We have been sailing rather close
to the wind of late,

702
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:23,500
and I detect a rocky patch.

703
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,340
I had hoped that you coming

704
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,710
onto the special unit
with us might make you want

705
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,800
to stop this hostage
taking business,

706
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,970
this attacking of my officers.

707
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:37,760
We can handle this prick, sir.

708
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:39,270
Webber, will you please
take the rest

709
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,930
of the afternoon off?
Thank you.

710
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,140
Be in my office at 6:15 sharp
tomorrow morning.

711
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:46,310
- Thank you, goodbye.
- Yes, sir.

712
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:54,160
Look, I'm not in the habit

713
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,660
of making deals with prisoners.

714
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:58,490
For your recent escapade,

715
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:01,870
you will be punished again.
Block.

716
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:07,210
If you have absolutely
no interest whatsoever

717
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,710
in yourself,

718
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,470
then you leave us at a loss
with regards what to do with you.

719
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:20,770
What would you like us to do,

720
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:23,310
Charlie Bronson?

721
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,610
Fuck off.

722
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,610
You're pitiful.

723
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:39,330
You know that?

724
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:41,660
And I can promise you this,

725
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:44,370
if you further this
mindless behavior,

726
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:47,880
if you continue to act
in this nihilistic and godless fashion,

727
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,550
you will die inside.

728
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:52,880
( Moans )

729
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:40,680
Un, dos, tres.

730
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,060
( Murmurs )

731
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,610
( whistles )

732
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:52,900
Cuatro.

733
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:55,990
Como esta?

734
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:58,280
- What?
- What's this?

735
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:00,450
- A painting.
- Good for you.

736
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:03,160
Now what do you mean?
Talk to me.

737
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:08,040
Sun, sea, sand,
naked women, perfect.

738
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:11,250
- Whose is this?
- Eh?

739
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:14,460
Whose is this?

740
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:16,760
Come on, own up.
Who did the crime?

741
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,100
Bombs away.

742
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,970
Not your art teacher
for nothing, you know?

743
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,650
Very interesting, Charlie.

744
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:48,750
Interesting?

745
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:51,920
Yeah, it's interesting.

746
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,840
What does that mean?

747
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,130
What does interesting mean?
Interesting's good.

748
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,630
Bravado!

749
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,800
You know?

750
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:06,850
Yeah, you can't pin it down,
can't compute.

751
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:11,600
You can't tie that up
in a nice little pink bow.

752
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:15,690
No, you can't pin me down, mate.

753
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,190
- Pajaros!
- You fucking what?

754
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,150
Birds. Birds, Charlie.
I'm leaning Spanish.

755
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,200
- Español.
- Oh.

756
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,780
Are you?

757
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:25,410
Olé!

758
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:27,450
( laughs )

759
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,750
Lot of birds
in your work, Charlie.

760
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,830
I don't really get
to see much through...

761
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,790
bit of birds

762
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,920
and bars.

763
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:43,010
Pajaros.

764
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,640
Pajaros.

765
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,010
I know, mate.

766
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:50,100
Here's an idea for you.

767
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:52,600
Find that piece of you, Charles.

768
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:55,440
That piece that
doesn't belong here.

769
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:58,270
( laughs )
Fucking hell.

770
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:13,460
( Classical music playing )

771
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:20,270
Prisoner BT1314, Bronson, sir.

772
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,780
Good afternoon, Bronson.

773
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:27,610
Well, Mr. Danielson
here tells me

774
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:30,620
that you've been doing
extraordinarily well

775
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:33,580
in your creative endeavors.

776
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,000
Champion's a budding Magritte.

777
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,080
That's right, yeah.

778
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:43,960
You know, we've been
holding these artist materials for you,

779
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:46,970
sent in by your cousin Lorraine.

780
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:50,140
Well, now that we're rather sadly having
to consider the future

781
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:53,180
of the arts facility,

782
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:57,190
I don't see any reason why you shouldn't
be allowed these materials now.

783
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:00,940
Should help tremendously
with your work.

784
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,570
Mr. Danielson really has
got great confidence

785
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:05,490
in your cooperation,

786
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:07,700
your responsibility,

787
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:11,160
your ability to interact
within the group.

788
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,030
I strongly advise

789
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,330
that you continue
to follow this path.

790
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,370
And I look forward to seeing some
of this wonderful work

791
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:21,210
I've heard so much about.

792
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:23,710
Governor, Charlie's
actually brought something

793
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,050
for you to have
a look at now if you'd lik...

794
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:28,300
Charlie, give me that.

795
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:33,510
That's for you.

796
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,350
Thank you.

797
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:39,440
If you give it to Webber,

798
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,270
I'll be able to have
a look at it later.

799
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,230
Governor:
Thank you.

800
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,110
Webber: Right then, Bronson.
What are you waiting for, son?

801
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:47,360
Let's go, move it!
Move it!

802
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,740
I said, let's go.
Move it!

803
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:01,790
Sorry, Webber.
That's for you, mate.

804
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:13,510
Danielson:
He's a star fucker, that one.

805
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,600
I'll make sure he looks
at that painting, mate.

806
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,720
Don't you worry about that.

807
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,230
Review the unit-pfft!

808
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:23,560
Honest to God, though,
Charlie, and I'll tell you this straight,

809
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:26,730
I wouldn't be surprised if they started
to discuss your release date.

810
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,440
I mean, look,
it's just my opinion.

811
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:30,320
It's not necessarily
the opinion of others.

812
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:33,610
But you know,
if there's one thing I am,

813
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:36,410
I am a very good judge

814
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,120
of character.

815
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:40,000
Yep.

816
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,460
Sí sí.
Sí sí sí.

817
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:46,460
You'll get a call, mate.
You will.

818
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:48,960
You know why?

819
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:51,130
You're a brilliant artist.

820
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,180
Bueno.
Buenísimo.

821
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:56,600
I'm so excited, mate.
I'm proud as punch,

822
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,520
'cause you are a fucking star.

823
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,600
Gov's a cunt.
He is. Fuck him.

824
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,600
Can't stand the wanker.

825
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:07,650
Just keep your head down
and I'm absolutely positivo

826
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:09,570
that we can do this.

827
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:11,740
We can, mate.

828
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,580
What do you mean we?

829
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:19,790
We-no.
I'm just saying-.

830
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:21,750
No no no, Charlie.
Charles.

831
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:24,620
Don't misunderstand me, mate.

832
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:28,290
What I'm saying is you...

833
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:30,800
you are finally gonna get

834
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,550
what you've always wanted.

835
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:41,810
What do you know
about what I fucking want?

836
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:46,230
( laughs nervously )

837
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,320
( thunder rumbling )

838
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:16,630
What happened to my tea, Phil?

839
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,640
Sorry, mate. I'm such a cunt.
I completely forgot.

840
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:25,600
Two for you.

841
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:28,560
Two for me.

842
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:32,570
And then we have a cup of tea.

843
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,450
( Audience laughs )

844
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:41,700

Governor:
Charlie.

847
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:08,620
What is it you want now?

848
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,170
Music.

849
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:25,430
I don't see how
that's gonna help the situation.

850
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,020
I'll fucking kill him!

851
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:33,730
I swear it!

852
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:38,230
Bennett.

853
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:44,070
- Get me some music on now, please.
- Yes, Gov.

854
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:57,040
( Opera playing )

855
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:22,210
Here, Charlie.

856
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,880
Not feeling very well now, mate.

857
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,390
( Music continues )

858
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:23,690
Oh, yeah.

859
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:26,360
That's a fucking piece of me.

860
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,000
Right, that's enough!
He's had enough.

861
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:50,420
Get him out of here.

862
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:52,760
Go on, get him the fuck out of here.
He's had enough.

863
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:57,010
Come on, you fucking cunts.

864
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:59,350
No class tomorrow, eh?
