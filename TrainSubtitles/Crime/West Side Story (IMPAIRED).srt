I say sock 'em!
Tear them!

165
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,730
Yeah, but if they
say blades or guns...

166
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,399
I say let's just
forget the whole thing.

167
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,525
What?

168
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,693
What do you say, Riff?

169
00:19:55,903 --> 00:20:00,115
I say this turf is small,
but it's all we got, huh.

170
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,452
I wanna hold it
like we always held it,
with skin!

171
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,832
But if they say blades,
I say blades.

172
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,002
If they say guns,
I say guns.

173
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,797
I say I want the Jets
to be the number one!

174
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,799
To sail! To hold the sky!

175
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,843
Then rev us off!
Voom va-voom!

177
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,887
RIFF: Okay, cats, we rumble!

178
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,639
Now...

179
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,434
...protocality calls
for a war council...

180

...between us and the Sharks
to set the whole thing up.

181
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,522
So I will personally
give the bad news
to Bernardo.

182
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:33,690
You gotta take
a lieutenant with you.

183
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,816
That's me.

184
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,568
That's Tony.
Who needs Tony?

185
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,194
We need Tony!

186
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,031
He's got a rep
that's bigger than
the whole West Side!

187
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,490
He don't belong no more.

188
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,075
Now, cut it, Action!

189
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,952
Me and Tony
started the Jets.

190
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,537
So where is he?

191
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,497
How come he takes a lousy,
stinkin' job?

192
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,124
Youth Board
corrupted him.

193
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,251
Yeah, temporary sickness!
Wait and see.

194
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,920
Remember them fists
the day we clobbered
the Emeralds!

195
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,255
He saved
my ever-loving neck!

196
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,840
Sure! He'll do it
again, too!

197
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,009
He always came through
for us and he always will.

Then why don't
you say somethin'?

265

That's why you gotta
come to the dance tonight
and stand up with me.

270
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,149
Come on, Tony.
Just say yes.

271
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,068
Riff, did you ever
stop to figure...

272
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:27,238
...how many bubbles
there are in one bottle
of this here soda pop?

273
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,115
Tony, this is important!

274
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,409
Everything's important,
Riff...

275
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,204
...you, me,
the sweet guy
I work for.

276
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,165
The Sharks walk bad.
They bite hard.

stop them now...

Four and a half years
I live with a buddy
and his family.

Boy, am I a victim
of disappointment in you!

283
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,516
End your sufferin',
little man.

284
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,185
Why don't you just
pack up your gear
and move out?

285
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,978
'Cause your ma's
hot for me.

286
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:05,860
No! It's 'cause
I hate livin'
with my buggin' uncle!

287
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,028
Come on!

288
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,196
Come on, uncle!

289
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,865
(PANTING) Now...

290
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,368
...go play games
with the Jets.

291
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,578
And why not?
They're the greatest.

292
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,205
Ain't they?

293
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,832
Were.

294
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,086
You found
somethin' better?

295
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,880
No. Not yet, but...

296
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,550
But what?

297
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,803
You won't dig it, Riff.

298
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,638
So try me.

299
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,558
Come on, Tony,
try me.

300
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,521
Okay.

301
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,403
Every single night
for the last month,
I wake up...

302
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,072
...and I'm reaching out.

303
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,741
For what?

304
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,951
I don't know.

305
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,287
A dame?

306
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,666
It's right outside the door,
just around the corner...

307
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,501
...but it's comin'.

308
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:04,794
What is?

309
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,088
I don't know. It...

310
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:11,217
It's like
the kick I used to get
from bein' a Jet.

311
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,052
Now you're talkin'!

312
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,471
Man, without a gang,
you're an orphan.

313
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:18,141
With a gang,
you walk in twos,
threes, fours...

314
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,517
...and your
crew is the best...

315
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,270
...when you're a Jet,
you're out in the sun,
buddy boy...

316
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,521
...you're home free home!

317
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:25,356
Riff, I've had it!

318
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,903
Tony...

319
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,780
Tony, look at me,
will ya?

320
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:33,865
Come on, look at me.

321
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:34,908
I'm lookin' at you.

322
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:38,870

can be clinched
by a fair fight,

the guts to risk that.

do get rid of it.

It'll only be a fistfight

Yes.

01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:54,889
All right, I will, then.

1418
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,141

She'll come runnin'
from the kitchen

She lives in the kitchen.

1434
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:35,221

She'll look at your face.
Try not to smile.

1435
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:38,933
She'll say,
"Skinny, but pretty."

She is plump, no doubt?

02:14:43,909 --> 02:14:45,618
Didn't I tell you he ain't here?

2093
02:14:46,662 --> 02:14:48,788
I'd like to see for myself.

2094
02:14:51,292 --> 02:14:57,172
Please.

2095
02:14:59,842 --> 02:15:01,176
Por favor.

2096
02:15:01,844 --> 02:15:03,428
Will you let me pass?

2097
02:15:03,554 --> 02:15:05,180
She's too dark to pass.

2098
02:15:05,264 --> 02:15:06,890
- Don't.
- Please don't.

2099
02:15:07,016 --> 02:15:08,600
Por favor.
No comprende.

2100
02:15:08,684 --> 02:15:09,976

De nada.

2102
02:15:11,187 --> 02:15:13,062
Listen, you!
We're listenin'.

2103
02:15:13,147 --> 02:15:16,274
Look, I gotta
give a friend of yours
a message.

2104
02:15:16,358 --> 02:15:17,901
He ain't here.
I gotta tell Tony...

2105
02:15:17,985 --> 02:15:19,736
- I know he is.
- Who says he is?

2106
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:21,404
- Who's the message from?
- Never mind.

2107
02:15:21,488 --> 02:15:23,323
Couldn't be from Chino,
could it?

2108
02:15:23,407 --> 02:15:26,618
Don't you understand?
I want to help!

2109
02:15:26,702 --> 02:15:28,995
Bernardo's girl wants to help?

2110
02:15:29,079 --> 02:15:30,455
Even a greaseball's got feelings.

2111
02:15:30,539 --> 02:15:31,623
But she wants to help get Tony.

2112
02:15:31,707 --> 02:15:32,707
No!

2113
02:15:32,791 --> 02:15:35,210
Not much.
Bernardo's tramp.

2114
02:15:35,294 --> 02:15:36,461
Bernardo's pig!

2115
02:15:36,545 --> 02:15:38,338
- You lyin' Spic!
- Don't do that.

2116

2133
02:16:45,531 --> 02:16:47,365
Bernardo was right.

2134
02:16:49,493 --> 02:16:50,952
If one of you...

2135
02:16:51,078 --> 02:16:54,539
...was lying in
the street bleeding...

2136
02:16:54,957 --> 02:16:57,542
...I'd walk by
and spit on you!

2137
02:16:57,626 --> 02:16:59,836
She'll tell Chino that
Tony's in the cellar.

2138
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:01,796
Don't you touch me!

2139
02:17:04,967 --> 02:17:07,927
I got a message
for your American buddy.

2140
02:17:08,971 --> 02:17:12,682
You tell that murderer that
Maria's never going to meet him!

2141
02:17:13,642 --> 02:17:17,228
You tell him that Chino found
out about them...

2142
02:17:17,563 --> 02:17:19,147
...and shot her!

2143
02:17:20,357 --> 02:17:21,733
She's dead!

2144
02:17:26,322 --> 02:17:28,406
When do you kids stop?

2145
02:17:29,533 --> 02:17:32,368
You make this world lousy!

2146
02:17:33,162 --> 02:17:35,038
We didn't make it, Doc.

2147
02:17:37,041 --> 02:17:38,666
Get outta here!

2148
02:18:09,198 --> 02:18:10,365
Maria?

2149
02:18:11,325 --> 02:18:13,743
Doc, I thought I heard...
You got it!

2150
02:18:13,827 --> 02:18:15,536
Yes, I got it.

2151
02:18:15,704 --> 02:18:17,413
Doc, you're a pal.

2152
02:18:17,498 --> 02:18:19,582
You're the best friend
a guy ever had.

2153
02:18:19,666 --> 02:18:22,210
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
I promise.

2154
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:23,419
Forget that.

2155

No, I'll never!
I couldn't.

2156
02:18:25,381 --> 02:18:28,674
Doc, you know what we're gonna
do in the country, Maria and me?

2157
02:18:28,759 --> 02:18:31,386
We'll have kids, and we'll
name 'em all after you...

2158
02:18:31,470 --> 02:18:33,471
...even the girls,
so when you visit us...

2159
02:18:33,555 --> 02:18:34,889
Wake up!

2160
02:18:35,891 --> 02:18:38,893
Is this the only way
to get through to you...

2161
02:18:39,436 --> 02:18:43,815
...do just what you all do,
bust like a hot water pipe?

2162
02:18:44,024 --> 02:18:45,316
What's got into you?

2163
02:18:45,401 --> 02:18:48,778
Why do you kids live
like there's a war on?

2164
02:18:53,325 --> 02:18:55,034
Why do you kill?

2165
02:18:59,248 --> 02:19:01,374
I told you how it happened.

2166
02:19:02,251 --> 02:19:03,918
Maria understands.

2167
02:19:04,795 --> 02:19:06,754
I thought you did, too.

2168
02:19:06,922 --> 02:19:08,923
Maria understands nothing...

2169
02:19:09,842 --> 02:19:11,259
Never again.

2170
02:19:11,635 --> 02:19:13,886
There is no Maria, Tony.

2171
02:19:17,933 --> 02:19:19,016
What?

2172
02:19:20,727 --> 02:19:21,727
I can't.

2173
02:19:21,812 --> 02:19:22,812
No, no, Doc.

2174
02:19:23,564 --> 02:19:25,857
Now, tell me.
What is it?

2175
02:19:26,942 --> 02:19:28,901
That was Anita upstairs.

2176
02:19:30,070 --> 02:19:33,114
Chino found out
about you and Maria...

2177
02:19:34,324 --> 02:19:36,325
...and he killed her.

2178
