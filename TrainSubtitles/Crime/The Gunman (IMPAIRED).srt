I think if your gut instinct is that
this trouble is related to Calvary,

and what I think
all of our panelists are indicating,

479
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:24,698

Well, let me tell you,
I don't believe a word you're saying.

502
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:50,033
I believe you're here because you think
Annie will leave me to be with you.

503
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:51,868
And I would be most welcoming

504
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:54,704
of the humiliation you would suffer
in attempting to take her.

Is that clear?

506
00:40:57,165 --> 00:41:00,251
She is a remarkable woman, Jim. Remarkable.

507
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:03,380
But when you told me to look after her,

508
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,216
you didn't actually expect her to wait
for a man who walked away?

509
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:08,510
She's my wife,

510
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:09,844
and she will remain so.

511
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:13,682
That said, we can play along
in this fairy tale, but then why would I...

Don't fuck with me, Felix.
We were all part of the operation.

513
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:19,149
I mean, you did your part, I did mine.
We all found a way to justify it.

514
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,855
Listen, it's been many years

we worked with back then.

I'm running my own place here now,
as you can see.

517
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:27,362
I'm running my own enterprise.

518

And neither of us can afford to do
anything but forget that project.

we have a surprise, right,
we'd like to share with him?

Jim Terrier,
I heard great things about you.

780
01:01:22,265 --> 01:01:23,808
You were quite a marksman back in the day.

781
01:01:23,933 --> 01:01:25,413
It seems you haven't lost your touch.

REINIGER: I know every room in this house.

785
01:01:32,442 --> 01:01:34,486
You have one skylight, this door.

786
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:38,114
You've got nowhere to go.
And I know you're not alone.

787
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:43,203
His wife is with you, Annie.
We just want you, not her.

788
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:46,373
So give yourself up,
and we will let the girl go.

789
01:01:46,498 --> 01:01:48,792
You care for her, no?

790
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:51,503
Open the door
and she will walk away from this.

791
01:01:54,964 --> 01:01:58,009
JIM: Who sent you? Who do you work for?

792
01:01:58,134 --> 01:01:59,552
Why?

793
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:04,641
You wonder why your past
comes back to haunt you?

794
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:08,853
I guess your little bitch

795
01:02:08,978 --> 01:02:11,481
must be wondering how she got
caught up in that slaughter, too.

796
01:02:12,315 --> 01:02:15,860
And now you're ready
to sacrifice an innocent woman?

It belongs to a farmer, a friend of Felix.

We weren't just laying an airfield

We had

a parallel contract with a mining interest.

01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:58,249
Felix was the liaison.

828
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:01,711
We were supplying arms
to the rebels, training.

829

The company would get its piece of the pie

It was me.

834

I'm the one that killed
the Mining Minister.

835

The contract with the company

836
01:06:33,034 --> 01:06:36,413
dictated that the shooter leave the
continent, so I left the continent.

837
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:37,747
I thought I'd come back,

I thought things would improve,
but they didn't.

tried to reach you.

I felt so trapped. Annie...

01:06:56,599 --> 01:07:01,771

I know I abandoned you.

I can't expect anything.

01:07:24,961 --> 01:07:27,255
