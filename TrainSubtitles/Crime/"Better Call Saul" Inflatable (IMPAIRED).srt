      I bought the new medicine 
      with every last

             if this is about   
             the bagpipes...    

333
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,131
  It's not about the bagpipes.  

334
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,165
 Well, of course,               
 it's the bagpipes.             

335
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,234
   It's the bagpipes

 That's what this is about!

 haven't you?                   

340
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,380
 You want outta here, clearly,  

341
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,350
 but you can't just up          
 and quit and expect            
 to keep your bonus.            

342
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,218
  And if I fire you for cause   

343
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,387
  like I should have done for   
  the TV commercial,            
  again, no bonus.              

344

 but you're not worth my time.

 I'd rather just have you gone.

   did I mistreat you?

 this kind of behavior?

   Hell, that cocobolo desk!

 like that in here?             
 You never gave this a chance.  

360

361
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,135
       I tried to make it work.

                I'm sorry.

        Being my own man again. 

662
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,001
          So, how'd it go       
          with Schweikart?      

663
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:34,270
               Uh... Went well. 

664
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,740
          Should be getting     
          their offer tomorrow. 

665
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:40,977
   That's fantastic!            
   I'm really happy for you.    

666
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:41,911
                Thanks.         

667
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,180
 You know,                      
 we should celebrate.           

668
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,516
 Whataburger! On me!            

669
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,253
        I'm not taking the job. 

670
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:51,888
            Why not?            
                You were right. 

671
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,959
             It's time for me   
             to be my own boss. 
             Solo practice.     

672
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:02,432
          What, you don't think 
          it's a good idea now? 

673
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:04,033
      Don't tell me             
      you've changed your mind. 

674
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:07,704
     No, I...                   
     I'm surprised, is all.     
     (CHUCKLES)                 

675
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:12,909
 Hey, I've said all along       
 you're too good                
 for those clowns.              

676
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:13,543
 This is, uh...                 

677
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:18,314
           Shit, yeah.          
           Wow. It's great!     

678
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:21,217
             Good. To that end, 

679
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,420
        I have a pitch for you. 

680
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,228
             Not Wexler-McGill. 

681
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,764
                 But Wexler     

682
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,033
                   and McGill.  

683
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:40,103
  We find an office,            
  share the housekeeping costs, 

684
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,639
       the rent,                
       electricity, everything. 

685
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,809
           But I am Kim Wexler, 
           attorney at law,     

686
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:47,977
      and you are Jimmy McGill, 
      attorney at law.          

687
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:51,548
        Both free to            
        practice as we see fit. 

688
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,383
 Separate firms under one roof. 

689
00:40:53,385 --> 00:40:56,386
  We're both headed uptown,     
  so why can't we share a taxi? 

690
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:59,722
         You do things your way 
         and I do them mine.    

691
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:04,994
         We'll have freedom,    
         but we aren't each     
         trying to go it alone. 

692
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:10,033
   Not partners.                
   Solo practitioners together. 

693
00:41:12,404 --> 00:41:13,770
             What do you think? 

694
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:16,940
      (CHUCKLING)               
      I don't know what to say. 

695
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,776
              Say yes.
