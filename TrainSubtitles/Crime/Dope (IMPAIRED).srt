You know, the `90s was like
the golden age of hip-hop.

Everything from
It Takes A Nation Оf MiIIions

Austin Jacoby.

1096
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,982
Nice to meet you,
Malcolm.

1097
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,694
Take a seat.
Come on, relax.

1098
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,117
So, uh,
Malcolm Adekanbi.

1099
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,285
Did l pronounce that right?

1100
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,080
Yeah? Great.

1101
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:31,165
You`re Nigerian.

1102
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,794
My dad, um. . .

1103
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,631
He. . . He went
back to Nigeria
before l was born.

1104
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,134
Sorry to hear that.

1105
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,344
l know what it`s like
to grow up without a father.

1106
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,555
That`s why l spend
a lot of time

1107
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,181
and a lot of money
with the boys club.

1108
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:50,101
Those, uh, those kids. . .

1109
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:52,812
Are they your kids?

1110
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,105
Yes, they are.

1111
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:57,650
Not too much older
than you.

1112
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,569
So you know Dominique?

1113
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:00,945
Excuse me?

1114
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:04,407
You. . . You probably
know him as Dom.

1115
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:08,035
No. Sorry.
Why do you ask?

1116
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,122
Dom gave me something

1117
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,583
to deliver to someone.

1118
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:18,004
As crazy as it seems,

1119
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,466
l think that someone is you.

1120
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,760
This Dom person,

1121
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:27,013
what did he say that

1122
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:30,349
l should have to do
with this delivery?

1123
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:32,018
l don`t know.

1124
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,938
l just know that he told me
to deliver it to A.J. , so. . .

1125
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,648
And why did you do it?

1126
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,942
l didn`t have a choice.

1127
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:43,404
Oh, come on, Malcolm. Come on.
You always have a choice.

1128
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:46,574
You could have done
a lot of things
with that package.

1129
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,285
You`re a smart kid.
l`m sure you thought
about all of them.

1130
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:53,790
But you chose to
make the delivery
for this Dom person. . .

1131
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,835
Because you thought it was,
what, in your best interest?

1132
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,759
So, you should
take responsibility

1133
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,303
for the choice
that you`ve made.

1134
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,598
Now, you know l`m not
the person or persons

1135
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,183
for whom this delivery
was intended.

1136
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,976
Something happened
along the way.

1137
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:16,729
lt`s like, uh, Amazon.

1138
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:21,317
lf you order a Rick Ross
or Macklemore CD. . .

1139
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:25,112
l would not order
a Macklemore CD.

1140
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,489
That wouldn`t happen.

1141
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,950
All right. Who, then?

1142
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:30,660
Casey Veggies.

1143
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:33,704
Casey Veggies?
That`s. . . That`s an artist?

1144
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,540
Yeah.

1145
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:36,916
Yeah, okay. All right.

1146
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,337
So, you order
a Casey Veggies CD
from Amazon, right?

1147
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:45,508
No, you don`t order
a Casey Veggies CD.

1148
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,677
You just go online
and you download it.

1149
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,554
Yeah, okay. All right.

1150
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:53,599
But you are aware
that Amazon does
ship discs, right?

1151
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:55,601
And if you
order that disk

1152
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,186
and it does not come
in a timely fashion,

1153
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,605
you`re gonna call them
and you`re gonna say,
``Where`s my stuff?``

1154
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,732
And Amazon has to
assume responsibility.

1155
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,693
But it`s just one CD.

1156
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:08,406
But what if it`s 1 00 orders
and 1 00 CDs don`t show up?

1157
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,950
Or a thousand? Or 1 0,000?

1158
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,369
lt`s a slippery slope.

1159
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,121
Slippery slope.

1160
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:18,374
So, Amazon has got to assume

1161
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:21,168
the full cost of the loss.

1162
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:22,962
But most importantly,

1163
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,215
they have to deal
with the loss of
their reputation.

1164
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,635
A reputation that has taken
a long time to build.

1165
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,387
You understand
what l`m saying?

1166
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,432
So let`s do this.

1167
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,184
Let`s reschedule
this interview

1168
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:41,522
for a few weeks from now.

1169
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,899
Give it a little time.

1170
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,734
Go out there.

1171
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,737
Make the delivery
for which you have
claimed responsibility

1172
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,156
to the appropriate
consumers,

1173
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,202
so that the suppliers
of this product can be whole.

1174
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:58,414
Metaphorically speaking,
of course.

1175
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,207
lf you`re able to do this,

1176
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:05,421
it shows me more about you
than any interview ever could.

1177
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,507
And l would then
make it my business

1178
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:11,844
to make you a man of Harvard.

1179

get out of the Bottoms
just like l did.

1180
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:20,394
l know from growing up there,
it`s very, very dangerous.

1181
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:22,438
And that your family
or your friends

1182
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,231
could get killed
at any moment

1183
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:27,568
just by being in
the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1184
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,489
l`d hate for that
to happen to you. . .

Getting on?

1187
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:44,085
Looks like you and l had
the same kind of day.

1188
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,544
How`d the interview go?

1189
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,507
Okay.

1190
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,884
Well, sit down.

took place today at
Seven Bucks coffee,

1215
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:29,190
apparently the side effects
of the popular club drug

a bunch of bitches, man.

1240
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,457
Speak for yourself, Jib.
Yes.

1241
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,626
l am a bitch-ass nigga.
l don`t give a fuck.

1242
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,379
l own that shit.
Who are you trying
to impress, Diggy?

1243
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,965
We`re talking
about Molly, Jib,
not fucking heroin.

1244
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,093
All we gotta do is
find the white people.

1245
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:42,096
Go to Coachella,
Lollapalooza.
Yeah, yeah.

1246
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,639
We can backpack
and hitchhike

1247
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:44,807
and sing
Mumford & Sons songs

1248
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,100
and all that
folk fucking shit.

1249
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:48,811
Fuck you. Okay?
l`m just saying
it could work.

1250
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:51,689
JlB: Yeah, yeah.
Why stop there, you know?
Why not hit Bonnaroo also?

1251
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:52,940
MALCOLM: Bitcoins.

1252
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:55,734
That`s how we do it.
DlGGY: Do what?

1253
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,738
Oh, shit.

1254
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:01,824
There`s these sites
where you can. . .

1255
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,033
You can sell everything

1256
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:06,120
from fake credit cards
to illegal guns and drugs.

1257
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,873
And they use bitcoins
so they can`t be traced.

1258
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:10,833
We don`t have to
stand on any corner.

1259
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,919
Dark web. Could work.

1260
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:15,796
Way better than Coachella.

1261
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,798
Guys, the FBl can track us.
The police. . .

1262
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:19,091
No, they can`t.
Uh-uh.

1263
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:20,593
Not if you use
a Tor browser.

1264
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,719
What the fuck is that?

1265
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,012
Onion routing.

1266
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:24,847
Layered encryptions.

1267
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,307
lt`s like a game
of Whac-a-Mole

1268
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:27,433
with thousands
of computers.

1269
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,685
What the fuck
is a Whac-a-Mole?

1270
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:30,895
Look, these dark web sites

1271
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,688
run off these
secret lP addresses.

1272
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,857
Like LulzSec-level shady.

1273
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,358
We need to find one somehow.

1274

NARRATOR: William
Ian Sherwood III.

1276
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:48,787
Musician, scholar,
rake, entrepreneur,

01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,174
NARRATOR: MaIcoIm,
Jib and Diggy

1282
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,301
met WiIIiam at Band Camp
three years ago.

1283
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,802
Yo, if you niggas
need some weed,

1284
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:07,473
l got you. Good shit.
Fair prices.

1285
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,558
NARRATOR: William assured
them that he the used
the word ``Nigga``

1286
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:11,018
only as
a term of endearment,

1287
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:14,480
as expIained by Q-Tip
in the classic song,
Sucka Nigga.

1288
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:18,442
That`s your room
right there.

1289
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,237
NARRATOR: After that,
they all hit it off.

1290
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:24,240
Though he never used that word
in front of them again.

1291
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:27,076
The mission at Band Camp
was to give kids from
different backgrounds

1292
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:30,454
a chance to exchange
music and experiences
unique to their cultures.

1293
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:35,167
Wait. Okay, so you`re saying
white girls will suck dick,

1294
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:36,919
yet still claim
they`re virgins?

1295
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:38,545
(LAUGHlNG) Yeah, man.

1296
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,422
l`m serious.
Really?

1297
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:41,674
Dude, check it.
l`ve been getting head

1298
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,133
since l was,
like, 1 2, all right?

1299
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:46,679
l`ve been
hitting hos in the ass
since l was, like, 1 4.

1300
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:48,639
lt`s true, man.

1301
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:52,851
These chicks will
let you fill any hole,
except the pussy,

1302
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:54,937
with a dick, no problem.

1303
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,232
So, technically,
you`re still a virgin too.

1304
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,027
Yeah.
Right.

1305
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:05,948
But here`s something to
wrap your brain around, man.

1306
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:07,950
l`ve never
had intercourse
with a pussy.

1307
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,034
JlB: Mmm-hmm.

1308
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:12,037
Only asshole
and oral. Okay?
JlB: Mmm-hmm.

1309
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:16,625
So the question isn`t,
``Am l technically a virgin?``

1310
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,503
What the question
could be is,

1311
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:22,715
``Am l technically gay?``

1312
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,552
Oh. That`s deep, nigga.

1313
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,846
Yeah. l don`t know.

1314
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,517
NARRATOR:
WiIIiam went to
(BLEEP) prep schooI,

1315
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,353
where he smoked
a pound of weed a week,
skipped classes,

1316
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:38,230
and had a 1 .9 GPA,

1317
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,816
yet got a perfect
score on his SAT.

1318
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,278
He was accepted to
his father`s aIma mater
under academic probation,

1319
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:48,490
which meant he had to maintain
a 3.0 grade point average.

1320
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:51,410
So, William hacked
into the (BLEEP) database,

1321
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:55,205
erasing all grades
from the entire
freshman cIass.

(MUSlC CONTlNUES)

1326
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,182
NARRATOR: That same year,
he achieved his dream

1327
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,600
of having sex
with a black girl.

1328
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,477
You ever fucked
on Molly before?

1329
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,312
No.

1330
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,730
Hey, nah,
it`s good, man.

1331
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:23,692
lt`s like. . .
lt`s like being
fucked by God.

1332
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,695
(SlNGlNG) I`m nojoke
when I stroke for a cIient

1333
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,616
You know,
everybody is going to
Black Market Reloaded

1334
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,076
and a bunch of
smaller sites.

1335
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,870
But, dude,
that shit is getting
mad sketchy now.

1336
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:36,705
lf you nigga. . .

1337

lf you guys want drugs,

01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,251
l can get you good shit

1339
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:43,170
way less expensive
than online.

1340
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,881
Nigga, we don`t
need to buy anything.

1341
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,592
We need to set up
a store to sell.

1342
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,512
What? Nah, really, dude.
What can l get you, man?

1343
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:54,223
l`m dead-ass
serious, nigga.

1344
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,974
Dead-ass serious.

1345
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:57,935
Okay.

1346
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:00,521
Okay.
All right. Wait.

1347
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:03,440
`Cause this is
ridiculous, man.

1348
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:06,860
Why the fuck,
after all these years,

1349
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:10,823
you can call me N-word
and l can`t say it?

Yo, look, we already
went over this.

1351

l`ll have to slap
the shit out of you again.

1352

l don`t want to do that.

1353
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,705
See, that`s not even right.
l mean, like, really.

1354
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:21,625
You know l`m not
the one, all right?
This is all love here.

1355
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,752
Look, let`s. . .
Let`s get back.

1356
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:25,379
Hey, you asked me to
do something for you.

1357

l`m like, ``What?`` l`m down.
l don`t give a fuck.

1358

Because you`re my people,
all right? You`re my n. . .

1359
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:33,554
And this is where
l would insert that word.

1360
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,264
lt`s nothing personal.
You`re still my nigga.

1361
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:37,391
But l gotta slap
the shit out of you
based on principle.

1362
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:40,602
Let`s get back to
what`s goin` on.
No, no, no. Wait. Principle?

1363
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,020
Okay, you want
to talk principle.

1364
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,564
What about Jib here, man?

1365
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:45,149
This dude isn`t
African-American.

1366
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,651
He`s like fucking Latino
or Moroccan or some shit.

1367
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,027
MALCOLM: Where`s this
conversation going?

1368
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:50,696
Technically, he shouldn`t
be able to say the word.

1369
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:53,115
Why can he use it?
Okay. Because
l`m 1 4% African.

1370
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,200
Four. . . 1 4?
That doesn`t. . .

1371
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:56,785

For real?
Just say the
damn word, okay?

1375
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,502
lt doesn`t matter.

Don`t say that shit.
l will slap the shit
out of you.

No, no, no. No, you won`t

outvoted by your peers.

Well. . .

lf you want zero trace,

a hand-to-hand exchange.

They know.

1721
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:42,623
They know the only difference
between these two bags

1722
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:44,375
is the person rocking them.

1723
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,627
So, when they rock `em,

1724
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:48,504
people are gonna
assume it`s real.

sewn into the bag.

Yeah.

1850

But that`s not what
a Harvard man would do.

1851
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:39,433
Nah, see, a man of Harvard
is smart enough to see

1852
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:41,185
that would set off
a chain of events

1853
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:44,271
that would
inevitably come back
and destroy him.

That wouId be a shame.

So, l think you should
take this opportunity
before you very seriously.

a man of Harvard,

nothing happens to a hair

You`re pretty damn arrogant.

Who do you think you are?

1871
01:32:03,977 --> 01:32:05,769
Let me tell you
about two students.

1872
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:10,232
MALCOLM: Student "A``
is a straight-A student

1873
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:11,859
who Iives in the suburbs
of Los Angeles.

1874
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:18,032
He plays in a punk band
with his best friends.

1875
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:21,035
He Ioves to skateboard
and ride on his BMX bike.

1876
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:23,203
His favorite TV show
is Game of Thrones

1877
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:25,414
and his favorite band
is The ThermaIs.

1878
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:28,208
He`s a `90s hip-hop geek.

1879
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:31,336
Student ``B`` goes to
an underfunded school,

1880
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,589
where teachers who wouId
rather not be there

1881
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:37,134
teach kids
who really don`t care.

1882
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:38,302
He Iives with
a single mother,

1883
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:41,305
doesn`t know his father
and has sold dope.

1884
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:44,516
Now close your eyes.

1885
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:49,063
Picture each of these kids
and tell me what you see.

1886
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:51,940
Be honest. No one`s
going to judge you.

1887
01:32:52,025 --> 01:32:53,150
Now open your eyes.

1888
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:56,236
So, am l student
``A`` or student ``B``?

1889
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:57,988
Am l a geek or a menace?

1890
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:01,033
For most of my life,
l`ve been caught in
between who l really am

1891
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:02,493
and how l`m perceived,

1892
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:05,079
in between categories
and definition.

1893
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:07,790
l don`t fit in.

1894
01:33:07,874 --> 01:33:11,126
And l used to think that
that was a curse,

1895
01:33:11,211 --> 01:33:13,962
but now l`m slowly
starting to see

1896
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:16,590
maybe it`s a blessing.

1897
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:19,426
See, when you don`t fit in,
you`re forced to see the world

1898
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:21,595
from many different angles
and points of view.

1899
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:24,098
You gain knowledge,
life lessons

1900
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:26,558
from disparate people
and places.

1901
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:29,812
And those lessons,
for better or worse,
have shaped me.

1902
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:31,313
So, who am l?

1903
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:33,065
Allow me to
reintroduce myself.

1904
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:34,691

l`m a straight-A student

1906
01:33:35,985 --> 01:33:37,611
with nearly perfect
SAT scores.

1907
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:40,614
l taught myself
how to play guitar
and read music.

1908
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:42,282
l have stellar

1909
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:44,409
and diverse
extra-curricular activities.

1910
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:46,453
l am a Google
Science Fair participant,

1911
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:47,621
and in three weeks,
l helped make
