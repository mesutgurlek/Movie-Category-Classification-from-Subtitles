465
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,966
- No.
- Yeah.

466
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,052

467
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,889
- Fuck you.

468
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,892
Ah, I can't believe it.
I got a deejay in here with me?

469
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,894
I think that's unbelievable, man.

470
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:05,022
Why don't you do, like, a little, you know -

471
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,357
a thing, you know, a talk?

472
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:10,611
[Scoffs]
I don't feel like it.

473
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:14,573
[Clicks Tongue] Come on, man. Do -
You know, do the weather or something.

474
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,955
[Sighs] Man, what's it like outside?
Why don't you tell me that?

475
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,540
- Cold.

476
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,918
Tell me some stuff, you know.
Go ahead. Do a thing.

477
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,629
Come on.
[Makes Noise]

478
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,674
All right. Okay.

Okay.

Well, we got about 12 below
the big red line.

483
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:52,236
Slick, icy road conditions
out there tonight, Bob. You betcha.

484
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,947
All you holiday travelers beware.

485
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:59,368
Looks like we got about a four-car pileup
out there on the airline highway.

486
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:03,413
I'm gonna switch over to our mobile unit now.
Chip, what does it look like out there to you?

487
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,999

Well, we got about 10:43 -
Coming up on 10:43 here in the Crescent City.

497
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:39,199
We're goin' around and around with the big
sound from the big town right here on WYLD.

498
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:42,786
You got the Lee Baby.

Right now we're gonna talk to Jack Romano.

500
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,000
We got him right here in the studio with us.

501
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,129
He's working over there
at Tipitina's tonight.

502
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,589
I'm gonna be down there.
I'm gonna be down there checkin' him out.

503

Right now we're gonna hear

505
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:06,393
I wanna send this one out

Dwight, Tyrone and the Golden Boys.

509
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:21,616
Let's hear a little somethin'
from Earl King, New Orleans's own.

510
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,619
Little somethin' called "Trick Bag."

512
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,166
Man, what is wrong with you?

513
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,252
It's like pulling teeth tryin' to get you to talk,
and you're a fuckin' deejay.

514
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:34,880
- What is wrong with you anyways?
- [Chuckling]

515
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,204
Hey, cut it out.

Stop it!

517

He don't even speak no English.

530

Homicidal son of a bitch says he's Italian.

531

[Clears Throat]
If looks can kill, I am dead now.

Excuse me.

541
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,361
Not enough room to swing a cat.

[Chuckles]

543
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,158
Cat. The animal.

But do you have some cigarette?

556
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,962
Cigarettes won't help with hiccups.
Not in this country.

557
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:12,175
[Hiccups]

Nothing. I said, "Do you like Walt Whitman?"

Huh?

595
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,259
That's good, Bob.

596
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:47,432
Excuse me. Do you say in English,
"I looka at the window"...

597
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:51,853
or do you say in English,
"I looka out the window"?

598
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:55,815
Well, in this case, Bob, I'm afraid
you gotta say, "I look at the window."

Jack, why-why are you put in this place?

601
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,681
I don't know, Bob. It was, like,
voodoo or something, you know?

00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:35,021
I was framed. I'm completely innocent.

What'd you do that for, Bob?

- The guy didn't like Walt Whitman?
- [Chuckles]

They can eat an entire family

What's wrong, Bob?

we get caught, we get a retrial.
