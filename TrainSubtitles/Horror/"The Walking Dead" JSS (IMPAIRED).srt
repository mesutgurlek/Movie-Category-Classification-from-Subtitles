NARRATOR: Previously on
AMC's The Walking Dead...

00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,679
DEANNA: Pete's a surgeon.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,901
RICK: He's beating his wife.

4
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:07,070
We have to stop it.

5
00:00:07,182 --> 00:00:08,149
PETE: Get away!

7
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,222
RICK: He killed Reg, we
didn't have a choice.

8
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:12,232
DEANNA: Rick?

9
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,233
Do it.

10
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:14,368
(gun shot)

11
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:17,060
RICK: What I'm proposing-
force 'em west, here.

12
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,100
They'll follow a path if
something's drawing 'em.

13
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:20,049
RICK: It's open!

14
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,317
We've gotta do this now!

15
00:00:21,418 --> 00:00:24,186
RICK: Head back, tell
everyone what's happening.

16
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:27,556
GLENN: It's a horn or something, it's
pulling the back half off the road.

17
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:29,037
MICHONNE: It sounds
like it's coming from--

18
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:30,183
Home.

19
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:34,931
Woman: It says the
ignition switch fuse

20
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:36,766
is found at location number 27.

21
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:38,902
Man: All right, 27. I need
to know where that is.

22
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:40,370
(woman sighs)

23
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:43,473
Um, right here.

24
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,642
Man: Yeah, okay,
this one's blown.

25
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:47,043
What's this one, the red one?

26
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:51,247
(snarling)

27
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:53,016
Enid: Mom, Dad,
we got to go.

28
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:55,518
- Man: Come on, come on.
- Woman: We see them.

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,440
Just need to find a fuse
so we can start the car.

30
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,656
Almost got it, honey.
Location six.

31
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:02,025
That's turn signal lamps
and stop lamps.

32
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:03,860
Man: All right, we can
live without turn signals.

33
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:05,562

Celery soup.

It's been here since the start.

- You're very brave.

Well, I'm hoping
the paprika will mask

I'd try to use a few things
nobody seems to want.

58
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,073
I used to make Ed these
spring cleaning casseroles

59
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:11,809
just to empty the pantry.

60
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:14,912
I made some miracles happen
with water chestnuts.

61
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:18,950
Talk about miracles, that
recipe for cola canned ham.

62
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:20,618
Mmm.

63
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,021
Ms. Peletier, you are
an honest to goodness hero.

Erin:
<i>Something wrong, Shelly?</i>

67
00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:33,531
It's just those old noodles.

68
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:37,268
I mean, I tell you, if someone would
just find me one of those machines,

69
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,239
I swear we would all be eating
like we were on a tour of Tuscany.

70
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:45,343
You know, Shel,
I could teach you

71
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:47,979
how to make pasta
with your own two hands.

72
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:50,615
But you'd have to promise
not to smoke in the house.

73
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:52,483
It's just a disgusting habit.

74
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:54,819
And it kills you.

75
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:56,754
If you ask me,
there are too many things

76
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:58,689
trying to do that
already, right?

77
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,659
Right.

78
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:12,703
Your dad used to hit you and
then he got himself killed.

79
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:16,707
It happened.
Now it's done.

80
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,343
You live with it
or it eats you up.

81
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:21,379
Go home.

82
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,966
Ron.

83

Ron.

No.

- Ron.
- No, I don't want a haircut.

88
00:09:11,897 --> 00:09:14,031
Look, I just gave myself one.

89
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,366
All right?
It's all set up.

90
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:17,235
Don't make me do it
again next week.

91
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:18,836
Take off your hat.

92
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:21,506
- This is bullshit.
- What did you just--

93
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:23,508
This is just you
trying to talk to me.

94
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:27,478
There are things
we need to talk about.

95
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:31,249
There are things
that you need to learn.

96
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:32,950
What, are you serious?

97
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,288
What is it? Do you--
do you blame me?

98
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:42,660
Huh? Do you actually blame me?

99
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:46,597
Raise your left arm
above your head.

100
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:52,103
You can't.
Tell me why.

101
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:53,704
No.

102
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:57,542
Your father was dangerous.

103
00:09:57,544 --> 00:10:00,378
Rick is dangerous.

104
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,981
He doesn't have anything
to do with this.

105
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:05,516
What, is he your friend?

106
00:10:07,386 --> 00:10:09,587
Yeah, he's my friend.

107
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,568
We got some panels to put up,

108
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,103
but we don't have to wait
to start growing things.

109
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:28,973
There will be some sore
backs and tired feet.

110
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:31,642
That's how you know you've
put in a hard day's work.

111
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:45,556
They found crates of these at a
nursery just a few miles out.

112
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:48,392
Tomatoes, carrots, you name it.

113
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:50,828
We can plant them right here.

114
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,465
Just need to finish
the expansion

115
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:57,535
and the wall needs to go up.

116
00:10:57,537 --> 00:11:01,806
Reg wanted
this community to grow.

117
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:04,108
You did, too.

118
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,943
Has that changed?

119
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:13,050
Everyone that's here
is here because of you.

120
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:18,456
You need to show them
you're still here.

00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:34,505
And going by cubic feet, the
biggest building in the expansion

123
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:36,474
and we're gonna
waste it on a church.

124
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:38,342
Take out the benches,
that could be a lab,

125
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:41,178
a machine shop, very least
a sweet-ass game room.

00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:35,266
I got really interested
in psychology.

And...
(laughs)

150
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:41,872

Can you do this?

152

want to throw up.

<i>So why the aspirin?</i>

158
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:02,460
Oh, Eugene and I were working on a
platform for another guard tower.
