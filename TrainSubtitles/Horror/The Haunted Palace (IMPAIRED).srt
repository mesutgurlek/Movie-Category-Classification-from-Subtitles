Well, I'll admit there's

moved to this village

331
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:35,818
and built this palace.

332
00:32:35,886 --> 00:32:38,687
His first wife died
in childbirth,

333
00:32:38,755 --> 00:32:41,590
so he selected the most
beautiful woman in the village

334
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:43,259
and took her
for his mistress.

335
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:47,897
Unfortunately, she was engaged to
marry an Arkhamite named Ezra Weeden.

336
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:49,032
Uh, no, thank you.

337
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:52,001
You spoke with his
descendent yesterday.

338
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:53,469
Oh, the man
at the inn.

339
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:55,104
Yes.

340
00:32:55,172 --> 00:32:56,705
Well, according to legend,

341
00:32:56,773 --> 00:32:59,608
a number of strange things occurred
when Curwen moved into the village.

342
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:01,911
Terrible noises
were heard in the night.

343
00:33:01,978 --> 00:33:03,446
Thank you.

344
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,416
Young girls were said to have
disappeared from their homes...

345
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:07,816
To be gone until dawn,

346
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:11,687
and then reappear with no
memory of their whereabouts.

347
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:17,026
Weeden wasted no time in placing the
blame directly on this doorstep.

348
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:20,863
He and his coterie of friends
claimed that Curwen was a warlock.

349
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:21,864
ANN: Warlock?

350
00:33:21,932 --> 00:33:24,367
Yes. One who
conjures up the dead.

351
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:27,270
They demanded punishment.

352
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:32,275
And one night, the people of the
village marched on the palace,

353
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:35,678
dragged your ancestor
into the yard, and burned him.

354
00:33:35,745 --> 00:33:38,247
Burned him?

355
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:41,184
The "burning man."

356
00:33:42,953 --> 00:33:45,254
Well, that explains
the guilt.

357
00:33:45,322 --> 00:33:47,723
What about the fear?

358
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:50,326
Curwen put a curse
on the village.

359
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:52,895
He vowed
that he'd return.

360
00:33:52,963 --> 00:33:55,631
You can see
the resemblance yourself.

361
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:57,633
Dr. willet,
I'm sure that

362
00:33:57,701 --> 00:34:02,238
every warlock or witch who
died in America left a curse.

363
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,508
Why should Curwen's
be taken so seriously?

364
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,210
Why should it be remembered
after all these years?

365
00:34:07,277 --> 00:34:09,044
I can't say.

366
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,814
He was a strange man.

367
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:13,816
There were terrible
rumors about him.

368
00:34:13,883 --> 00:34:15,351
WARD: Such as?

369
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:18,687
It was thought, Mr. Ward,
that he had gained possession

370
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:21,124
of a book called
the necronomicon.

371
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:22,691
Have you heard of it?

372
00:34:24,428 --> 00:34:25,595
No.

373
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:27,263
Well, it obviously
never existed,

374
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,298
except in the minds
of the superstitious.

375
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:31,634
But they claimed
it held enough secrets

376
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:34,337
to give a man
absolute power.

377
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:38,907
Of course, every mythology
has such a book,

378
00:34:38,975 --> 00:34:43,112
but the necronomicon
supposedly contained formulas

379
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:48,684
through which one could communicate
with or even summon the elder gods...

380
00:34:48,752 --> 00:34:53,322
the dark ones from beyond
who had once ruled the world

381
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:57,693
and now are merely waiting for an
opportunity to regain that control.

382
00:34:57,761 --> 00:35:01,597
Cthulhu, yog-sothoth.

383
00:35:01,665 --> 00:35:04,066
Dreadful rubbish, I know.

384
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:07,236
Still, the people
of Arkham believed it.

385
00:35:07,304 --> 00:35:12,308
They claimed that Joseph Curwen
and two other warlocks

386
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,711
were trying to open the
gates to these dark gods.

387
00:35:15,779 --> 00:35:18,481
Open the gates? How?

388
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,816
They claimed that
Joseph Curwen was trying

389
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:23,953
to mate those beings
with humans

390
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,988
to create a new race

391
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:28,758
through which the gods
could regain their control.

392
00:35:28,825 --> 00:35:32,295
That's how they explained
the mutated births--

unsuccessful experiments passed
on from generation to generation,

394

explanation, doctor?

397

I advise you, Mr. Ward,
to leave this village.

would from a madman with a knife

Oh, Joseph, can't you

was burned from my bones

while I was yet alive? No.

No, this village will pay for
its crime, just as I vowed.

There can be no work
without my knowledge.

as to what's happening.

Your husband is reacting
to the legend of his ancestor.

The attitude of the village,
the remarkable resemblance

675

between him and the figure
in the portrait,

676

find a way to help him.

You're not going
back in there?

Yes. What else can
I do? Leave him?

Because you

to lie, doctor.

terribly upset about her.
