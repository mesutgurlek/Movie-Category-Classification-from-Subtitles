00:51:15,293 --> 00:51:17,554

609
00:51:22,925 --> 00:51:25,289

610
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:28,620
Donnie BarksdaIe

611
00:51:28,691 --> 00:51:32,248
His wife did.
I told her it was routine.

612
00:51:32,324 --> 00:51:34,619
We're checking all the ponds
in the county.

613
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,849
[SheriffJohnson]

614
00:51:41,123 --> 00:51:44,214

617
00:51:59,856 --> 00:52:03,254
All right. You just said you're
gonna be a few minutes.

618
00:52:03,322 --> 00:52:05,686
And we're
going on two hours.

619
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:08,744
Hey, Pearl !
I think I got something !

620
00:52:37,952 --> 00:52:41,179
False alarm.
It'sjust an old bicycle.

621
00:52:44,684 --> 00:52:47,343
None ofy'all brought a Thermos
ofcoffee out here ?

622
00:53:10,848 --> 00:53:12,939
That day at school.

623
00:53:14,248 --> 00:53:17,179
You looked kind ofstrange
at me and Jessica.

624
00:53:17,247 --> 00:53:19,712
Did you think
something bad then ?

625
00:53:30,346 --> 00:53:32,777
Shit.
Come on.

626
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,068
- Donnie, he called. I told him--
- Pearl !

627
00:53:37,145 --> 00:53:39,202
Shut your mouth !

628
00:53:39,279 --> 00:53:41,369
Goddamn it, Pearl,
what are you doing on my property ?

629
00:53:41,445 --> 00:53:44,877
I'm on Sheriff's business, Donnie.
I got permission from your wife.

630
00:53:44,944 --> 00:53:46,876
You think I let that
little ninny talk for me ?

631
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:51,470
How'd your arm
get all scratched up ?

632
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:57,233
Stray cat. She didn't like it
when I killed her.

633
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:00,673
- Now what brought you here ?
-Just routine investigation.

634
00:54:00,743 --> 00:54:02,970
We're checking
all the ponds in the county.

635
00:54:10,575 --> 00:54:14,007
- Iknewit wasyou.
- No ! You-- Uhh !

636
00:54:17,808 --> 00:54:21,331
Hey ! I'm on County business,
Donnie. Don't fool with me.

637
00:54:21,407 --> 00:54:24,168
- Hey, Pearl !
- What ?

638
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,171
- You need to take a look at this.
- Watch him.

639
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:30,228
HauIit up, boys !

640
00:54:38,272 --> 00:54:41,363
- It's her !
- Donnie ?

641
00:54:44,237 --> 00:54:47,601
Get those hooks
out of my baby !

642
00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:50,830
- Get her offthem hooks ! Ohh !
- Cuff him !

643
00:54:50,904 --> 00:54:54,199
- No ! No !
- Mr. King !

644
00:54:56,603 --> 00:54:59,727
- No ! Ohh !
- Get an ambulance !

645
00:54:59,803 --> 00:55:01,735
I think he's
having a heart attack !

646
00:55:01,803 --> 00:55:04,360
- I didn't do this !
- Get him out of here !

647
00:55:04,436 --> 00:55:06,595
This ain't right !
Pearl !

648
00:55:06,668 --> 00:55:10,964
Bitch ! [ Spits ]
Bitch ! Bitch ! Pearl !

649
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:27,328
Come in.

650
00:55:30,232 --> 00:55:32,164
Somebody might
come in here.

651
00:55:32,232 --> 00:55:34,925
I guess you better
fuck me fast.

652
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:37,897
You want some coffee ?
Mrs. Wilson ?

653
00:55:40,665 --> 00:55:42,892
You want some coffee ?

654
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,226
No, thankyou.

655
00:55:45,297 --> 00:55:47,229
Have a seat.

656
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:55,026
Why-- Why have you
called me here ?

657
00:55:55,097 --> 00:55:58,324
Tomorrow Donnie Barksdale goes
on trial for murder...

658
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:01,486
and I feel
that we have a powerful case.

659
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:03,494
In fact,
today the coroner verifiied...

660
00:56:03,562 --> 00:56:05,892
Donnie's tissue
under the victim's fiingernails.

661
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:09,620
Now, I only have one weak link
I got to worry about.

662
00:56:09,694 --> 00:56:12,888
- What ?
- You.

663
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:17,256
Yousee, you're how we foundout
where the victim 'sbody was.

664
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:20,622
And how you found out,
well,

665
00:56:20,693 --> 00:56:23,887
that might open up
a real can ofworms for us.

666
00:56:23,959 --> 00:56:28,482
Psychic phenomena,
E.S.P., dreams, visions.

667
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,821
The defense
couIdgo to town onyou.

668
00:56:30,893 --> 00:56:34,120
Andifthat'snot badenough,
Iunderstandthere wasbadbIood...

669
00:56:34,192 --> 00:56:37,090
between you
and Donnie Barksdale.

670
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:39,386
Yeah.
He threatened my kids.

671
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:43,413
That's what Iheard. IaIso heard
thatyou threatenedhim right back.

672
00:56:43,491 --> 00:56:45,615
ToIdhis wife
to Ieave him.

673
00:56:48,024 --> 00:56:50,489
Donnie's quite
a ladies' man.

674
00:56:50,557 --> 00:56:52,784
Wereyou invoIved
with him ?

675
00:56:54,856 --> 00:56:57,118
- What ?
- Ican deaI with any reveIation...

676
00:56:57,190 --> 00:56:59,121
right now.

677
00:56:59,189 --> 00:57:02,121
But at the trial
there can't be any surprises.

678
00:57:03,789 --> 00:57:06,448
So, is there anything I need
to know about you or Donnie...

679
00:57:06,522 --> 00:57:09,750
orDonnie's wife
orthe victim ?

680
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:12,287
No.

681
00:57:12,355 --> 00:57:14,650
Will that be all ?

682
00:57:15,821 --> 00:57:17,753
Yes, ma'am.

683
00:57:20,554 --> 00:57:23,986
You know, Mr. Duncan,

684
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:27,508
the victim had a name.

685
00:57:27,586 --> 00:57:30,279
It wasJessica King.

686
00:57:34,085 --> 00:57:35,685
Mr. Hawkins, howIonghaveyou

688
00:57:37,918 --> 00:57:39,850
About ten years.

689
00:57:39,918 --> 00:57:43,475
Now, were you working at AyJay's
on Saturday night, April 8 ?

690
00:57:43,551 --> 00:57:46,108
- Yes, sir.

-Yes, sir.

692
00:57:50,017 --> 00:57:52,744
Could you describe the circumstances
when you saw him ?

693
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:57,578
The circumstances were I come
outside to throw out some trash.

694
00:57:57,649 --> 00:57:59,581

00:58:02,015 --> 00:58:05,572
Anyhow, Iseen Donnie BarksdaIe

About that time,
Igo backinside.

700
00:58:17,347 --> 00:58:19,677
Is this the woman
you saw with Donnie Barksdale ?

701
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:22,974
- Yes, sir.
- Your Honor, let the record show...

702
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:27,070
that I'vejust shown Mr. Hawkins
a photograph ofJessica King.

703
00:58:29,546 --> 00:58:34,705
You just said that your attention
was drawn to the defendant's pond.

704
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:39,068
Drawn in--
Well, drawn in what way ?

705
00:58:40,445 --> 00:58:43,240
Me, Wayne Collins
and Kenneth King...

706
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:45,242
went to see a woman,
name ofAnnie Wilson.

707
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,742
What made you think this woman
would be able to help you ?

708
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:53,572
Well, word around town
was that she was a,

709
00:58:53,643 --> 00:58:56,353
uh--

710
00:58:56,487 --> 00:59:00,543
- WeII, Idon't knowthe right word.
- Isn't it fortune-teller ?

711
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,581
-Iguessso.
-What didthis fortune-teIIersee...

712
00:59:04,653 --> 00:59:07,618
when she looked into
her little crystal ball ?

713
00:59:07,685 --> 00:59:12,515
Well, she didn't have no ball.
She had these, uh, special cards.

714
00:59:12,585 --> 00:59:15,846
What did she see when she looked
into her little special cards ?

715
00:59:15,918 --> 00:59:18,180
Uh, she didn't actually
see nothing then.

716
00:59:18,251 --> 00:59:21,774
But next day,
she come to see me and...

717
00:59:21,851 --> 00:59:23,714
told me
she had this dream.

718
00:59:23,783 --> 00:59:26,806
- She had a dream ?
- Yes, sir.

719
00:59:26,883 --> 00:59:31,076
She'd seen this pond and it looked
a lot like Donnie Barksdale's and...

720
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:35,241
then she woke up
from herdream...

721
00:59:35,316 --> 00:59:38,372
andshe went outside
andIookedup in this tree.

722
00:59:41,415 --> 00:59:43,438
I'm all ears.

723
00:59:47,414 --> 00:59:50,505
She seenJessica King...

724
00:59:50,581 --> 00:59:53,206
floatin' in the tree,

725
00:59:53,281 --> 00:59:56,076
half-naked, with a chain
wrapped around her.

726
00:59:56,146 --> 00:59:58,544
Floatin' around a tree ?

727
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,945
Yes, sir.

728
01:00:03,445 --> 01:00:05,411
Floatin' in a tree,

729
01:00:05,479 --> 01:00:07,570
haIf-naked,

730

with a chain
wrapped around her.

731
01:00:11,845 --> 01:00:14,174
Thankyou, Sheriff.

732
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:18,166
That little squirrel,
Weems, isjust mean and skinny.

733
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:20,766
Neverhave known
a Weems worth a damn.

734
01:00:20,844 --> 01:00:22,707
Well, he was
just doing hisjob.

735
01:00:22,777 --> 01:00:26,607
Uh, Mrs. Wilson ?
Can I talk to you for a minute ?

736
01:00:26,676 --> 01:00:30,006
- Um--
- Uh, just call me later on, okay ?

737
01:00:30,076 --> 01:00:32,008
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, bye.

738
01:00:32,075 --> 01:00:36,700
Buddy, I got a lot on my mind.
It's not a good time, okay ?

739
01:00:39,042 --> 01:00:40,974
Um, Mrs. Wilson ?

740
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:45,064
You did tell me to do some thinkin'
and talkin'. And I've been thinkin'.

741
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,936
What ? What ?

742
01:00:47,008 --> 01:00:50,872
Can you tell me why
I do things to myself...

743
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,872
when I think
about my daddy ?

744
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,031
All right, well--

745
01:00:55,107 --> 01:00:59,334
Bud, you call me later, hon,
and we'll talk, all right ?

746
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:02,201
- I need to talk to you.
- Buddy.

747
01:01:02,273 --> 01:01:05,205
I've been thinking about my daddy
and I've been touching myself.

748
01:01:05,273 --> 01:01:08,204
- Touching yourself? How ?
- Why do I do that ?

749
01:01:08,272 --> 01:01:09,828
It's not a good time.

750
01:01:09,905 --> 01:01:13,167
- Something's bad wrong with me.
- Look, Buddy--

751
01:01:13,238 --> 01:01:16,203
And I-- I keep thinking
about that blue diamond.

752
01:01:16,271 --> 01:01:20,067
You look into the blue diamond,
you won't think a negative thought.

753
01:01:20,137 --> 01:01:23,933
I promise. Now, hon, I'm going
through a hard time myself. I'm--

- How'd you know ?
- A little bird told me.

758
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:53,527
It's time you started making things
easier on me instead of harder.

01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,532
- [Phone Ringing]
- I'm very disappointed in you.

760
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:59,088
- The phone's ringing, Mama.
- Second ofall,

761
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:01,927
I'm gonna have to testify
at that trial tomorrow.

762
01:02:01,999 --> 01:02:04,829
- The phone's ringing, Mama.
- I'm not deaf, Miller.

763
01:02:04,899 --> 01:02:07,058
Let the machine get it.

764
01:02:07,132 --> 01:02:11,086
Donnie Barksdale's side, they're
gonna try and give me a hard time.

765
01:02:11,164 --> 01:02:13,721
They're gonna call me names
and I--

766
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:15,729
I just want y'all
to be prepared...

about me, all right ?

He's threatening to kiIIhis daddy!

He's got Odell tied up
in the backyard,

772
01:02:32,062 --> 01:02:34,085
accusing him
of horrible things.

773
01:02:34,162 --> 01:02:37,594
- Have you called the police ?
- He said if I did he'd kill Odell.

774

Buddy, put that strap down and
tell me what he's done to you.

I'm here, Buddy. Like you said,
you can talk to me, honey.

It got so I was embarrassed
to go to school, Daddy.

789
01:03:33,055 --> 01:03:35,816
How could you do that
to your little boy ?

790
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:50,845
No, Buddy. You put that down.
No, Buddy.

in the explosion...

812
01:05:27,076 --> 01:05:29,008
out at the Reinhold
Cable Plant.

813
01:05:29,076 --> 01:05:31,167
Yes, that's right.

01:05:31,243 --> 01:05:34,675
Andyou were Ieft with threesmaII

Yes, sir.

01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:39,705
How do you provide
foryou and your sons ?

817
01:05:44,174 --> 01:05:47,038
I get a little bit
of money from Social Security...

818
01:05:47,107 --> 01:05:49,058
as a result
of my husband's death.

819
01:05:51,658 --> 01:05:54,180
And, uh,

820
01:05:54,257 --> 01:05:56,485
I also give readings.

821
01:05:56,557 --> 01:05:58,580
- Psychic readings.
- Yes, sir.

What doesbeingpsychic
enabIeyou to do ?

823
01:06:03,624 --> 01:06:05,816
I see things...

824
01:06:05,889 --> 01:06:09,321
and I, you know--
I sense... things...

825
01:06:09,389 --> 01:06:11,480

hadn't happened yet...

827
01:06:14,822 --> 01:06:19,981
My granny told me that I--
I had a gift that runs in my family.

828
01:06:20,054 --> 01:06:22,350
And she told me that
I shouldn't be afraid of it.

829
01:06:22,421 --> 01:06:27,512
I should just always use my instinct
and I'd-- I'd be all right.

01:06:27,587 --> 01:06:29,576
So, you'reswearing

about this tragedy...

from any other means
than your special ability ?

- Your gift.
- Yes, sir.

01:06:37,886 --> 01:06:40,612
I'm swearing that. Yes.

behind my back ?

839

- Objection, Your Honor.
- YourHonor,

840
01:07:01,383 --> 01:07:04,110
my client is sitting in this
courtroom on trial for his life...

841
01:07:04,183 --> 01:07:07,671
partIybecause ofpowers
that this woman cIaims to have.

842
01:07:07,749 --> 01:07:10,681
Now, in all fairness, I believe
I should be given the opportunity...

843
01:07:10,749 --> 01:07:12,681
to test
the alleged powers...

844
01:07:12,749 --> 01:07:15,271
instead of having to stand here
and take her word for it.

845
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:18,803
You have a good point.
Objection overruled.

846
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:24,245
Can everyone in thejury box
see how many fiingers I'm showing ?

847
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,908
How many fiingers,
Mrs. Wilson ?

848
01:07:36,579 --> 01:07:38,511
I don't know.

849
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:40,772
You don't know ?

850
01:07:43,346 --> 01:07:46,800
Seven.
Seven fingers.

851
01:07:46,878 --> 01:07:49,503
That-- That doesn't
prove anything.

852
01:07:49,578 --> 01:07:52,702
Your Honor, I can't do this,
you know, at the drop ofa hat.

853
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:57,141
Well, then, ma'am, how about doing
it at the drop ofa dollar bill ?

854
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:59,472
What are you trying to say ?

855
01:07:59,544 --> 01:08:01,941
I'm trying to say maybe this special
gift ofyours doesn't work...

856
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:04,737
unless you're
being paid for it.

857
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,241
Like they say in the army,
''No money, no honey.''

858
01:08:07,309 --> 01:08:09,275
No, that's not true.

859
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:11,275
Are you aware that in Hatcher County
it's against the law...

860
01:08:11,343 --> 01:08:13,501
for a psychic to set up shop
and charge people money ?

861
01:08:13,575 --> 01:08:15,564
Well, I don't charge money.

862
01:08:15,642 --> 01:08:17,608
You just testifiied
that you do charge money.

863
01:08:17,675 --> 01:08:21,072
No. I accept donations.
People give me gifts.

864
01:08:21,141 --> 01:08:25,799
Oh. A distinction
worthy ofa lawyer.

865
01:08:25,873 --> 01:08:28,362
Mrs. Wilson,
you a rich woman ?

866
01:08:28,441 --> 01:08:30,463
- No.
- Why not ?

867
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:35,438
If I had psychic powers and could
read the future, I'd be fiilthy rich.

868
01:08:35,506 --> 01:08:37,438
I'dbepIaying

869
01:08:37,505 --> 01:08:40,471
I'dbe overin MobiIe
betting on the dogs.

870
01:08:40,539 --> 01:08:42,801
I'd certainly warn my husband
not to go to work...

871
01:08:42,871 --> 01:08:45,303
on the day I know the Reinhold
Plant's gonna blow up...

872
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:49,599
leaving three little ol' children
to be raised in a carnival sideshow.

873
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:52,966
Well, it doesn't work
that way, sir.

874
01:08:53,037 --> 01:08:55,003
I can't use my gift
for personal gain.

875
01:08:55,071 --> 01:09:00,298
Except for those, uh,
what you call 'em, donations ?

876
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:08,559
You've had some personal trouble
with Donnie Barksdale, haven't you ?

877
01:09:13,802 --> 01:09:15,734
Yes, I have.

878
01:09:15,802 --> 01:09:18,632
Just a few weeks ago, you told him--
I believe the exact words was...

879
01:09:18,702 --> 01:09:20,963
you was gonna have
his ass thrown in jail.

880
01:09:21,034 --> 01:09:23,795
- But he was threatening my kids.
- Ain't it also true...

881
01:09:23,867 --> 01:09:26,799
that a few weeks ago in one of
those famous readings ofyours,

882
01:09:26,867 --> 01:09:28,798
when you were doing
your so-called E.S.P.,

883
01:09:28,866 --> 01:09:31,162
you told Valerie Barksdale,
Donnie's wife,

884
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:33,596
that Donnie wasjust
an insecure redneck...

885
01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:36,598
and that he wasn't really
crazy enough to kill anybody ?

886
01:09:43,365 --> 01:09:45,297
Yes, I did say that.

887
01:09:45,365 --> 01:09:47,592
Then why today are you
saying he did kill somebody ?

888
01:09:47,664 --> 01:09:49,596
Wait a second.
I've never said that.

889
01:09:49,664 --> 01:09:52,186
You might as well have, ma'am.
You wanted his ass in jail.

890
01:09:52,264 --> 01:09:55,628
-He's on trial for his life.
-I just told the sheriffwhat I saw.

891
01:09:55,697 --> 01:09:59,255
And how could any of us
ever forget that ?

so much fun foryou.

entertaining yourself
with your dreams and your visions.

899
01:10:21,194 --> 01:10:24,751
You think it's fun seeing decomposed
bodies in my tree, do you, sir ?

900
01:10:24,827 --> 01:10:26,759
You think that's fun ?

901
01:10:26,827 --> 01:10:30,224
Do you think it's fun I have people
trying to strangle me in my sleep ?

King on the night she was killed ?

So I told her
I'd meet her out at AyJay's.

920
01:11:36,552 --> 01:11:39,109
And I told my wife
I was going out for a beer.

921
01:11:39,185 --> 01:11:42,549
- What happened after that ?
- Well, we got in an argument.

922
01:11:42,619 --> 01:11:44,550
She told me she didn't
want to see me no more.

923
01:11:44,618 --> 01:11:47,311
-Did she tell you why ?
-She said she was getting married...

924
01:11:47,384 --> 01:11:49,975
in a couple of months and she
wanted to stop playing around.

Andduring the course
ofthisargument with Miss King,

927
01:11:55,283 --> 01:11:57,306
did you at any moment
strike her ?

928
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:02,414
Yes, sir.

929

afteryou struck her ?

930

WeII, she bangedherhead
prettyhard when she went down,

931
01:12:11,448 --> 01:12:14,676

to take herto the hospitaI.

- Did you reach the hospital ?
- No, sir.

I don't wanna go
to the hospital. Someone--

937
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,712

are you guilty
ofthe charge against you ?

beaten up the victim...

that she was murdered.

and with a bright,
shining future in front ofher--

Why would a woman like that get
involved with something like you ?

967
01:14:05,447 --> 01:14:09,674
I asked her that
myselfone time.

in town who knew how to fuck.

making those personal comments.

It won't happen again.

Let's clarify this.

You're saying it was
just a coincidence...

physically assaulted Jessica King,

someone else put
her body in your pond ?

978

I'm not saying
it was a coincidence.

- I'm saying I got framed !

Oh, well, what an original defense.

as a stray cat ?

No.

983
01:14:52,675 --> 01:14:54,937
Did you tell SheriffJohnson that
a stray cat had clawed your arm ?

- Yeah.
- Didn't you just tell the court...

-Jessica had scratched your arm ?
- Yeah, but--

Didn't you tell SheriffJohnson you
got scratched by the stray cat...

987
01:15:02,074 --> 01:15:04,005
because she didn't like it
when you killed her ?

Oh, Wayne,
I'm so sorry.

It's okay.

1057
01:24:08,273 --> 01:24:10,761
No, it's not okay.

1058
01:24:12,973 --> 01:24:17,802
I-- I don't think
Donnie Barksdale killed her.

1059
01:24:19,771 --> 01:24:21,862
- No, no, Annie.
- I'm really sorry.

I can't-- I can't do this.
It's fiinished.

1061
01:24:24,404 --> 01:24:27,801
I know. I wanna let
that bastard rot in jail.

1062
01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:30,563
- But he's guilty.
- No, Wayne.

I see it.

1064
01:24:35,769 --> 01:24:38,065
I see he didn't do it.

1065
01:24:41,569 --> 01:24:46,058
- Do you see who did ?
- Uh, I'm trying, but I-- I--

01:24:46,135 --> 01:24:48,067
I don't know yet.

What are we gonna do ?

1068
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:55,165
Well, if I had
a piece ofclothing...

1069
01:24:55,234 --> 01:24:59,859
or maybe I could go
out to the pond or see if I--

Well,
what brings you out here ?

Well, I'll just come
straight out and say it.

1076
01:27:02,764 --> 01:27:05,161
I don't think Donnie Barksdale
killed Jessica King.

1077
01:27:05,231 --> 01:27:07,197
Well, sure he did.
It was an open-and-shut case.

I'm telling you he didn't.

is still out there someplace.

- No.
- I'll talk to Pearl Johnson.

This has nothing to do
with the Barksdales. Listen.

I know that Donnie
didn't kill Jessica...

the same way that I knew
that her body was in his pond.

And do you know
who did kill her ?

No.

1087

So, what do you care ?
The son ofa bitch is in jail.

gonna try and kill me.

What do you
want me to do ?

Reopen the case and fiind out
who really did it.

- I can't. He's been convicted.
- Well, you can talk to somebody.

1093
01:27:48,125 --> 01:27:50,057
I've got no basis to open this case.
I'd look like a fool.

I don't give a damn
how you look.

Now, you listen to me.

I know you had
an affair withJessica.

the night before she was killed ?

Do you want money ?

01:28:35,421 --> 01:28:38,853
No. I want you
to reopen the case.

There's a saying about
letting sleeping dogs lie.

You thinkyou're in danger now ?
Look at it logically.

gets reopened and someone starts...

worrying that you're gonna have
another one ofyour damn dreams.

You're the soul

1205
01:41:33,791 --> 01:41:37,950
And you just need to keep doing
what you're doing.

1206
01:41:53,255 --> 01:41:55,187
I washed it.

1207
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:12,817
Will you come back
into town with me ?

1208
01:42:12,886 --> 01:42:14,818
Yeah.

1209
01:42:30,652 --> 01:42:33,981
You know you're
gonna have to go back.

1210
01:42:35,818 --> 01:42:38,375
Yes, ma'am, I know.

1211
01:43:11,313 --> 01:43:13,245
Can I have your keys,

1212
01:43:35,877 --> 01:43:36,968
WeII,

1213
01:43:37,178 --> 01:43:40,405
I just talked to Wayne.

1214
01:43:40,477 --> 01:43:43,466
He pretty much admitted
to everything.

1215
01:43:43,544 --> 01:43:47,908
I've known that boy
half my life.

1216
01:43:51,576 --> 01:43:54,507
Itjust goes to show,
you can know somebody and...

1217
01:43:58,241 --> 01:44:00,173
not know 'em.

1218
01:44:02,808 --> 01:44:06,205
How's his, um--
How's his head ?

1219
01:44:06,274 --> 01:44:08,399
Well, you put
a pretty good dent in it.

1220
01:44:08,474 --> 01:44:11,372
Oh, no, Sheriff,
I told, uh--

1221
01:44:11,441 --> 01:44:13,633
I told the deputy
it wasn't me who did that.

1222
01:44:13,707 --> 01:44:16,764
It was, um--
It was Buddy Cole. He saved me.

1223
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:19,862
- No, ma'am. It weren't Buddy.
- Well, yes, it was.

1224
01:44:19,939 --> 01:44:23,462
- Why don't you just ask Wayne ?
- I did.

1225
01:44:23,539 --> 01:44:25,868
He don't remember
what happened.

1226
01:44:25,938 --> 01:44:28,200
Head injuries is funny.

1227
01:44:28,272 --> 01:44:33,397

1231
01:44:43,670 --> 01:44:45,794
