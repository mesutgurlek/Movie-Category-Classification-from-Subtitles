into the lobby...

All he had to do
was hold the door.

Nicholas: <i> ...he was hitting</i>

00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,827
Or they were trying to.
Or they just didn't care.

Noah, I had him.

I had his hand.

00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:20,769
And if I didn't push back,

71
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:22,437
I'd be dead, too.

72
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,943

73
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,588

<i>No guns.</i>
<i>No going outside the walls.</i>

<i>I know you see it, too.</i>

87
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:20,602

what I see, Nicholas.</i>

88
00:08:20,604 --> 00:08:22,907
<i>And I see a great deal.</i>

89
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:34,917
I almost left him out there.

90
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,520
Could have told a story.

91
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,658
What, you think I should have?

92
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,496

I don't know if they can yet.

96
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,574

- We have to be here.

00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:59,614
- We have to.
- Yeah, we do.

98
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:03,182

we don't answer to them.

Talked to Sam some more.

109
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:21,387
He said his mom put a bolt
on the inside of his closet.

110
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:23,855
Tells him to lock
himself in sometimes

111
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,726
and not come out till morning.

112
00:10:27,229 --> 00:10:30,231
<i>He said he can hear</i>
<i>his dad yelling,</i>

Last month it got quiet
right in the middle of it

00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:39,473

00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:08,053
That's not nothing.

166
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,310
I'm sorry for what happened.

167
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,781
How are you holding up?

168
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:36,414
I'm not.

169
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:42,817
We have a problem with Pete.

170
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:49,558
I hoped it'd get better.

171
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:52,895
You knew?

172
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:57,932
It hasn't gotten better.
It won't.

173
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,734
Pete's a surgeon.

174
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:04,234
He's saved lives.

175
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:05,901
He might be saving Tara's life.

176
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:08,238
He's beating his wife.

177
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,041
- We have to stop it.
- How?

178
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:12,644
We separate them.

179
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:14,179
We tell him that's how
it'll be from now on.

180
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:16,518
What happens when he
doesn't want to do that?

181
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:24,362
It's not his choice.

182
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,135
So what happens?

183
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:33,976
I kill him.

184
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:35,944
We kill him.

185
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:38,182
We don't kill people.

186
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:41,952
This is civilization, Rick.

187
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:44,319
Warning someone to stop or die,

188
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,688
- that is civilized nowadays.
- Oh.

189
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,393
So what? So we just
let him hit her?

190
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:50,861
We let him kill her?

191
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:53,763
No, we exile him
if it comes to that.

192
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:56,433
We do that, we don't
know when he comes back

193
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:58,201
and what he does to them.

194
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:01,403
Letting him go makes
this place vulnerable.

195
00:18:01,405 --> 00:18:04,603
You really want to wait till someone
in that tower has to take care of it?

196
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,274
- And that's if we're lucky.
- We are not...

197
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:10,376
executing anyone.

198
00:18:10,378 --> 00:18:13,308
Don't ever suggest it again.

199
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:17,577
That sort of thinking
doesn't belong in here.

200
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:21,047
People die now, Deanna.
They do.

201
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:27,021
There's times like this
you can decide who and when.

202
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,090
Or it can be decided for you.

203
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,530
It already was.

204
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:37,098
I wouldn't kill you.

205
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:40,906
I'd just send you away.

206
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:52,852
Michonne: <i>Got it in
the back of the head.</i>

207
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:55,355
Had to be her.

208
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:08,671
Back of the head.

209
00:19:16,144 --> 00:19:18,413
She's hunting them.

00:19:47,408 --> 00:19:49,811
<i>And you're going the wrong way.</i>

<i>To be honest, you scare me.</i>

220

You shouldn't sneak out
by yourself.

221
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:07,505
Two people just died.

222

Oh, come on.

223
00:20:10,713 --> 00:20:13,650

You know that.

224
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,452
We should go back.

225

Why?

226
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:22,392
What do you do out here anyways?

227
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:26,396
Same thing as you.

Those five lives,
you have to carry that.

236

People like you
are supposed to be dead,

00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:03,555
but these walls
went up just in time,

238

so you're not.

239

You don't go outside
those walls anymore.

Not by yourself,
not with anyone else.

I'm someone who knows
who you are.

244

I know what you did.

245
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:30,012
And it's not gonna happen again.

246
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:32,213
I've been protecting this place,

247
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:34,950
helping provide for it.
You just got here.

248

Don't forget what I said.

249
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:41,455
Are you threatening me?

250
00:22:41,457 --> 00:22:44,862

No.

251
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,698

We're supposed to be out here.

We're supposed
to feel like this.

255

I don't want to forget.

256
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:27,421

Being in the forest with them.

260

I do, too.

No, I--

265

00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:32,890
I can fix it.

332
00:33:32,892 --> 00:33:35,894
No, you can't.
But I can.

333
00:33:37,663 --> 00:33:39,698
No, what--
what can you do?

334
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,620
What are you gonna do?
You gonna put him in jail?

335
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:46,037
You're only gonna
make things worse.

336
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:50,774
If it's gotten worse,
it means he's killed you.

337
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:52,376
That's what's next.

338
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:55,011
And I'm not gonna
let that happen.

339
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:01,851
Why do you care?

340
00:34:09,354 --> 00:34:11,520
Why is this so important to you?

341
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,093
Now?
You've made it.

342
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,460
You have a home for your kids.

343
00:34:20,562 --> 00:34:22,197
Rick, what are you doing?

344
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,934
I'm trying to help.

345
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,602
I don't know that.

346
00:34:29,107 --> 00:34:31,109
I'm married.

347
00:34:34,546 --> 00:34:38,051
Okay? I can take care of myself.

348
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:40,719
We have to take care
of ourselves.

349
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:43,850
What are you doing?

350
00:35:45,586 --> 00:35:48,488
You know Sam asked for a gun?

351
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,192
To protect you.

352
00:35:54,596 --> 00:35:56,332
You shouldn't be here.

353
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:58,833
Jessie, in here,
you can't see it,

354
00:35:58,835 --> 00:36:00,368
but it's the same.

355
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,337
It's the same as out there.

356
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:04,606
We have food and roofs
over our heads,

357
00:36:04,608 --> 00:36:07,242
but you don't get to just live.

358
00:36:07,244 --> 00:36:10,978
You don't get to put it off
or wish it away, Jessie.

359
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,482
If you don't fight, you die.

360
00:36:18,587 --> 00:36:21,357
And...

361
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,194
and I don't want you to die.

362
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:30,030
I can--
I can help you.

363
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:33,701
I can keep you
and your boys safe.

364
00:36:36,538 --> 00:36:38,971
I can.

365
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,612
All you have to do is say yes.

366
00:36:53,658 --> 00:36:56,060
Would you do this
for someone else?

367
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:02,568
Would you do this for anyone?

368
00:37:12,615 --> 00:37:14,916
No. No.

369
00:37:20,592 --> 00:37:22,860
Yes.

370
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:28,000
Rick.

371
00:37:30,036 --> 00:37:31,770
What are you doing here?

372
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:36,009
Pete.

373
00:37:36,011 --> 00:37:39,079
What are you doing here?

374
00:37:42,117 --> 00:37:45,584
- Listen to me.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, Rick.

375
00:37:48,954 --> 00:37:50,388
No.

376
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:57,732
Excuse me?

377
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,766
You need to leave.

378
00:38:05,103 --> 00:38:06,972
What are you talking about?

379
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:09,877
Just go, Pete.

380
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,747
What have you been
saying to each other?

381
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:16,919
Huh?

382
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:19,455
What have you been doing?!

383
00:38:19,457 --> 00:38:21,356
Pete, you and me
are gonna leave now.

384
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:23,625
You come into my house...

385
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:26,196
Pete, you and me are leaving.

386
00:38:26,198 --> 00:38:27,763
Pete: <i>You're leaving right now.</i>

387
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:30,066
You think you're the law?

388
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:33,103
You actually think you have
a say in anything here?

389
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:35,436
- Step back.
- Who the hell do you think you are?

390
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,402
Someone who's trying
not to kill you.

391
00:38:37,404 --> 00:38:38,638
No!

392
00:38:39,841 --> 00:38:41,840
- You wanna stop now!
- (shouts)

393
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:45,741
Come into my house?!

394
00:38:45,743 --> 00:38:47,844
- Pete, stop it!
- It's my house!

395
00:38:47,846 --> 00:38:49,480
Pete, stop it!

396
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:51,651
(shouts)

397
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:53,153
<i>(glass breaks)</i>

398
00:38:53,155 --> 00:38:55,354
- <i> (fight continues)</i>
- Jessie:<i> No! Stop it!</i>

399
00:38:55,356 --> 00:38:57,224
(shouting)

400
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,372
(snarling)

401
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,374
<i>(distant glass breaks)</i>

402
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,916
(screams)

403
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:21,457
(grunting)

404
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,924
Deanna!

405
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,986
Ah!

406
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,569
Dad, get off!

407
00:40:19,696 --> 00:40:21,496
Deanna:
<i>Stop it!</i>

408
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:23,598
Stop it right now.

409
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:28,369
You touch them again
and I'll kill you.

410
00:40:28,371 --> 00:40:30,638
Damn it, Rick!
I said stop.

411
00:40:32,422 --> 00:40:34,212
Or what?

412
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,184
You gonna kick me out?

413
00:40:39,555 --> 00:40:41,358
Put that gun down, Rick.

414
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,597
(panting)

415
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:51,071
You still don't get it.

416
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:54,873
None of you do!

417
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:57,873
(snarling)

418
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:03,311
Rick: <i>We know what needs
to be done and we do it.</i>

419
00:41:03,313 --> 00:41:05,977
<i>(silenced gunshot)</i>

420
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:07,878
Rick: <i>We're the ones who live.</i>

421
00:41:13,149 --> 00:41:18,185
You, you just sit
and plan and hesitate.

422
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:22,224
You pretend like you know
when you don't.

423
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:27,196
- (walkers snarling)
- (silenced gunshots)

424
00:41:27,198 --> 00:41:30,669
Rick: <i>You wish things
weren't what they are.</i>

425
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:32,471
<i>Well, you want to live?</i>

426
00:41:33,973 --> 00:41:36,441
<i>You want this place</i>
<i>to stay standing?</i>

427
00:41:36,443 --> 00:41:38,242
(silenced gunshot)

428
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:40,344
Your way of doing
things is done.

429
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,682
Things don't get better
because you-- you want them to.

430
00:41:46,817 --> 00:41:49,755
Starting right now,
we have to live

431
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:53,159
in the real world.

432
00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:56,991
We have to control
who lives here.

433
00:41:58,027 --> 00:41:59,863
That's never been
more clear to me

434
00:41:59,865 --> 00:42:02,000
than it is right now.

435
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:04,267
Me? Me? You--

436
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:06,935
(laughs)
You mean-- you mean me?

437
00:42:09,556 --> 00:42:12,815
Your way is gonna
destroy this place.

438
00:42:13,303 --> 00:42:14,862
It's gonna get people killed.

439
00:42:14,982 --> 00:42:17,469
It's already gotten
people killed.

440
00:42:17,883 --> 00:42:20,880
And I'm not gonna stand by
and just let it happen.

441
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:24,315
If you don't fight, you die.

442
00:42:24,632 --> 00:42:26,825
I'm not gonna stand by--

443
