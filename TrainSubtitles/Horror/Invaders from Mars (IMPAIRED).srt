GOT MUCH TIME.                  

647
00:55:23,085 --> 00:55:24,352
             WHAT HAPPENED WAS--

648
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,388
         NO!                    

649
00:55:26,455 --> 00:55:29,124
LET ME SEE                      
THE BACK OF                     
YOUR NECK FIRST.                

650
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:30,591
THE BACK OF MY NECK?            

651
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:32,127
                            YES.

652
00:55:32,194 --> 00:55:34,395
             PLEASE, GENERAL.   
                HE'S SERIOUS.   

653
00:55:49,495 --> 00:55:51,696
         I HAD TO               
     MAKE SURE FIRST.           

654
00:55:51,763 --> 00:55:53,364
                I GUESS         
             I'M NEXT.          

655
00:55:58,837 --> 00:56:00,171
        OKAY, GO ON.            

656
00:56:27,782 --> 00:56:29,216
             IT'S WIRED.        

657
00:56:37,691 --> 00:56:39,359
         THE DETONATOR IS SET.  

658
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,700
             YOU BETTER HURRY,  

659
00:56:47,768 --> 00:56:50,203
         OR YOU JUST MIGHT      
             BLOW IT.           

660
00:57:09,423 --> 00:57:12,759
                I UNDERSTAND HOW
         IT MUST SOUND, GENERAL,

661
00:57:12,827 --> 00:57:17,497
            BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU
         IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.  

662
00:57:17,565 --> 00:57:19,600
I DON'T KNOW.                   

663
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:23,070
PEOPLE BEING SUCKED             
UNDER THE SAND.                 

664
00:57:23,137 --> 00:57:24,270
A LOT OF ALIENS                 

665
00:57:24,338 --> 00:57:27,007
RUNNING AROUND LOOSE            
UNDERNEATH THE TOWN.            

666
00:57:27,075 --> 00:57:30,010
IT'S A LITTLE HARD              
TO SWALLOW.                     

667
00:57:30,078 --> 00:57:31,211
                 EXCUSE ME, SIR.

668
00:57:31,278 --> 00:57:34,781
             NASA DOES CONFIRM  
             A VISUAL SIGHTING, 

669
00:57:34,849 --> 00:57:36,416
                         A UFO, 

670
00:57:36,484 --> 00:57:38,184
     2 NIGHTS AGO DURING        
     THE METEOR SHOWER.         

671
00:57:38,252 --> 00:57:39,820
         BUT RADAR              
     REPORTED NO STRIKE.        

672
00:57:39,887 --> 00:57:42,155
 IN FACT, RADAR REPORTED        
         NOTHING AT ALL.        

673
00:57:42,223 --> 00:57:43,206
GENERAL,                        

674
00:57:43,274 --> 00:57:45,275
WHAT IF THE SHIP                
ABSORBED ENERGY?                

675
00:57:45,343 --> 00:57:46,876
IT WOULDN'T                     
SHOW UP ON RADAR                

676
00:57:46,944 --> 00:57:50,980
BECAUSE NO ENERGY               
WOULD BOUNCE BACK, RIGHT?       

677
00:57:51,049 --> 00:57:51,381
         SEARCH TEAMS WERE SENT 
             OUT TO FIND SIGNS  
         OF IMPACT OR LANDING.  

678
00:57:51,449 --> 00:57:54,484
                            SIR.

679
00:57:54,552 --> 00:57:56,553
             THE MEN WHO CHECKED
            THE COPPER HILL AREA

680
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,720
                         GAVE IT
                 A CLEAN REPORT.

681
00:57:57,788 --> 00:58:00,290
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE        
SUCKED UNDER THE SAND!          

682
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:02,192
THEY'RE ALL PART OF IT!         

683
00:58:11,986 --> 00:58:15,322
 WALKER, WOULD YOU              
 PLEASE COME IN HERE?           

684
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:16,756
MA'AM, I'D LIKE YOU             
 AND THE BOY                    

685
00:58:16,824 --> 00:58:19,426
     TO LEAVE US                
     FOR A MOMENT.              

686
00:58:19,494 --> 00:58:20,527
                 YES, SIR.      

687
00:58:20,595 --> 00:58:22,196
                            SIR?

688
00:58:22,263 --> 00:58:25,932
            [General]           
     WALKER, I WANT YOU TO      
    TO ESCORT THESE 2 PEOPLE    

689
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,034
     TO THE BRIEFING ROOM.      

690
00:58:28,102 --> 00:58:29,303
             YES, SIR.          

691
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,004
         PLEASE, FOLLOW ME.     

692
00:58:46,221 --> 00:58:49,289
RINALDI, I WANT YOU             
TO NOTIFY NASA                  

693
00:58:49,357 --> 00:58:51,725
THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO          
JUST A ROUTINE SECURITY CHECK   

694
00:58:51,792 --> 00:58:53,927
ON THEIR MEN.                   

695
00:58:53,994 --> 00:58:55,895
DON'T WANT TO MAKE              
AN ISSUE OUT OF THIS.           

696
00:58:55,963 --> 00:58:57,231
                     YES, SIR.  

697
00:59:06,173 --> 00:59:08,475
         [Walker]               
     THE GENERAL'S READY        
     TO SEE YOU NOW.            

698
00:59:24,492 --> 00:59:26,360
            SORRY TO            
     DISTURB YOU, BOYS.         

699
00:59:26,427 --> 00:59:29,463
     JUST HAVE A COUPLE         
     OF ROUTINE QUESTIONS       

700
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:35,902
         ABOUT THE              
     COPPER HILL SEARCH.        

701
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:38,372
            [Gunshot]           

702
00:59:44,829 --> 00:59:47,296
PLACE THESE MEN                 
UNDER ARREST!                   

703
00:59:55,239 --> 01:00:00,777
     TELL ME WHAT               
 THE HELL IS GOING ON!          

704
01:00:00,845 --> 01:00:01,978
                     GENERAL--  

705
01:00:07,818 --> 01:00:08,885
                 KEEP BACK!     

706
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:25,936
             MY GOD.            

707
01:00:26,003 --> 01:00:28,087
WHAT?                           
         THEY'RE DEAD.          

708
01:00:28,155 --> 01:00:28,956
            JESUS!              

709
01:00:45,974 --> 01:00:46,739
         STAY CLEAR!            

710
01:00:46,807 --> 01:00:52,980
 DON'T TOUCH THOSE THINGS!      

711
01:00:53,047 --> 01:00:54,481
    SEAL THE BASE PERIMETER.    

712
01:00:54,548 --> 01:00:56,516
         ALERT SECURITY!        

713
01:00:56,584 --> 01:00:59,086
     GET THOSE NASA HOTSHOTS    
 BACK OVER HERE RIGHT AWAY.     

714
01:00:59,153 --> 01:01:01,254
        MAYBE THEY CAN          
         EXPLAIN THIS.          

715
01:01:01,322 --> 01:01:03,690
BRING THE NURSE                 
AND THE KID BACK,               
RIGHT NOW!                      

716
01:01:03,757 --> 01:01:05,658
LOCK OFF THE LAUNCH AREA.       
                     YES, SIR.  

717
01:01:30,684 --> 01:01:31,951
             DAVID,             

718
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:33,453
     THIS IS DR. STOUT,         

719
01:01:33,521 --> 01:01:36,089
     SENIOR SCIENTIST ON        
 THE MILLENNIUM PROJECT.        

720
01:01:36,157 --> 01:01:37,457
     THIS IS DR. WEINSTEIN.     

721
01:01:37,525 --> 01:01:38,758
HOW DO YOU DO,                  
DAVID?                          

722
01:01:38,826 --> 01:01:40,793
WE WORK WITH                    
YOUR FATHER.                    

723
01:01:40,861 --> 01:01:43,963
HI, DAVID. YOUR DAD'S TALKED    
ABOUT YOU A LOT.                

724
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:46,733
 THIS IS LINDA MAGNUSSON,       
     DAVID'S FRIEND.            

725
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,037
     DOCTOR, I DIDN'T THINK     
         THE VIKING MISSIONS    

726
01:01:50,104 --> 01:01:51,871
         FOUND ANY SIGN OF LIFE,

727
01:01:51,939 --> 01:01:54,074
         EXCEPT FOR THIS PHOTO  
         I SAW IN A MAGAZINE    

728
01:01:54,142 --> 01:01:56,126
             OF THESE THINGS    
             ON THE SURFACE     

729
01:01:56,194 --> 01:01:58,695
             THAT LOOKED        
             LIKE PYRAMIDS.     

730
01:01:58,762 --> 01:02:00,364
                     I SAW THAT 
                     PHOTOGRAPH.

731
01:02:00,431 --> 01:02:03,533
         AND WHAT ABOUT         
         THAT HUGE THING        

732
01:02:03,601 --> 01:02:06,703
     THAT KIND OF LOOKED        
     LIKE A MONKEY'S HEAD?      

733
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,405
     IT WAS IN ALL THE PAPERS.  

734
01:02:08,473 --> 01:02:09,906
        THAT WAS FAKE, RIGHT?   

735
01:02:09,974 --> 01:02:12,342
            ON THE CONTRARY,    
         THERE WERE OTHER PHOTOS

736
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:15,212
             TOO SENSATIONAL    
         TO BE MADE PUBLIC.     

737
01:02:15,279 --> 01:02:17,897
BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WATER    
 TO SUPPORT LIFE.               

738
01:02:17,965 --> 01:02:21,434
ON THE SURFACE.                 
WE'RE LOOKING BELOW GROUND.     

739
01:02:21,502 --> 01:02:22,535
        IF THERE IS,            
         DAVID,                 

740
01:02:22,603 --> 01:02:24,504
     IT MAY NOT WANT            
        TO BE FOUND.            

741
01:02:24,572 --> 01:02:26,573
                    THE TUNNELS!

742
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:29,041
            IT MAY NOT          
         WANT US UP THERE.      

743
01:02:47,595 --> 01:02:49,862
                 THERE REALLY IS
                NO OTHER CHOICE.

744
01:02:49,931 --> 01:02:53,466
NO, PLEASE, GENERAL WILSON,     
    ANY FURTHER DELAY,          

745
01:02:53,534 --> 01:02:54,801
                WE'LL MISS      
            THE LAUNCH WINDOW.  

746
01:02:54,868 --> 01:02:57,003
                 MARS WON'T WAIT
                FOR US, GENERAL.

747
01:02:57,071 --> 01:02:58,371
     I UNDERSTAND,              
     GENTLEMEN.                 

748
01:02:58,439 --> 01:03:00,206
        WE WILL                 
        GO TONIGHT,             

749
01:03:00,274 --> 01:03:07,164
BUT WE MUST BE ABLE             
TO GUARANTEE SECURITY.          

750
01:03:07,231 --> 01:03:08,131
WE STILL DON'T KNOW             

751
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:09,966
WHAT THE HELL                   
WE'RE DEALING WITH.             

752
01:03:10,034 --> 01:03:16,973
         WHAT WOULD YOU

1196
01:33:00,373 --> 01:33:02,540
             YOU'RE FINE, MOM.  

1197
01:33:02,608 --> 01:33:03,358
                         WHEW.  

1198
01:33:03,425 --> 01:33:04,825
         OH, DARLING.           

1199
01:33:04,893 --> 01:33:06,827
                        YOU SEE,
            THE SPACESHIP LANDED

1200
01:33:06,895 --> 01:33:09,497
                 RIGHT IN BACK  
                 OF THE HILL.   

1201
01:33:09,565 --> 01:33:11,232
            WHAT DID?           

1202
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:17,172
AND YOU STARTED                 
CHASING ME DOWN THE HILL.       

1203
01:33:17,239 --> 01:33:21,108
 THEN EVERYTHING EXPLODED       
 INTO A GREAT BIG WHITE LIGHT.  

1204
01:33:21,177 --> 01:33:22,877
THAT IS                         
REALLY WEIRD, DAVID.            

1205
01:33:22,944 --> 01:33:24,312

                I LIKE THE STUFF

1206
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:27,715
     ABOUT THE MARTIANS         
         COMING TO STEAL        
             THE COPPER.        

1207
01:33:27,783 --> 01:33:29,284
     BUT IT SEEMED              
     SO REAL.                   

1208
01:33:29,351 --> 01:33:30,951

         OF ALL SORTS OF THINGS 

1213
01:33:40,229 --> 01:33:42,530

             TO YOU TODAY, LIKE,

1216
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:53,608
                 BUT I WAS      
                 SO SCARED.     

1217
01:33:53,676 --> 01:33:56,244
