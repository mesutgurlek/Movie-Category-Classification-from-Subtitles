1
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,577
Morning. Morning.

2
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,332
<i>ELECТRONIC VOICE ON ТOY:</i>
<i>Can уou spell "Parakeet"?</i>

3
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,791
Parakeet.

4
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,919
B-I-R-D.

5
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,545
<i>B-I-R-D.</i>

6
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,797
<i>Wrong. Try again.</i> Wrong?

7
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,300
Wrong, Aunt Trish. Try again.

8
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,676
What's for breakfast?

9
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,303
My turn, huh? Mmm-hmm.

10
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,514
Darlin', Donna has locked
herself in our bathroom.

11
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,600
Would you get her the hell
out of there, please?

12
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,518
My favorite role,
the wicked stepmother.

13
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,978
Absolutely.

14
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,231
It's kind of chilly in
here this morning, huh?

15
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,733
Yeah. I’ll check it out.
You makin' breakfast?

16
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,944
Aunt Trish said it's my turn.

17
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,821
Shh with that
"Aunt Trish" stuff.

18
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,075
I have been begging you since you
got here not to call her that.

19
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,993
It's been a month already.

20
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,287
Bruce, old habits
die hard, you know.

21
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,331
Right, they do.

22
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,708
My mom always calls her Trish.

23
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,961
My grandma
always called her Trish.

24
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:18,507
But Aunt Pat hates it.
She thinks it's declasse.

25
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,841
<i>Declasse?</i>

26
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,262
Call her Pat, will you?

27
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,597
I’ll try. You wanna
help me make breakfast?

28
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,057
Yeah, I'd love to. Come on.

29
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,476
What does "declasse" mean?

30
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,438
Come on. I heard Mom and
Pop called last night.

31
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,604
CAROL ANNE: Yeah, they did.

32
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,525
PAT: Donna?

33
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:38,627
Donna? We're gonna be...
Just a second, Pat.

34
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:39,754
We're gonna be late again,

35
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,448
and you still have to use
my eyeliner, which I have.

36
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,579
Here. Thanks.

37
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,331
You look great.

38
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,582
Now remember, less is more.

39
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,549
Okay. We got eggs, sausage, bacon,
dill pickles. What’ll it be?

40
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,801
Toast'ems.

41
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,804
Oh, no! Not again.

42
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,931
I cook. You set the table.

43
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,225
Done.

44
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,601
A masterpiece.

45
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,811
A veritable Picasso.

46
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,731
No! He would have put
your nose over here.

47
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,191
Can I borrow this?

48
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,321
You look like an Eskimo.

49
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,031
Well, I'm a California person.

50
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,991
I'm not used to
wearing all this stuff.

51
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,410
Listen, surfer girl, the
week before you got here,

52
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,872
the temperature got above
zero for about six minutes.

53
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,248
If it's this cold inside,

54
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,917
you're gonna appreciate all those
things when you get outside.

55
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,920
Doesn't it ever
get warm in Chicago?

56
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,174
You are gonna regret that
remark come August, young lady.

57
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,260
August? I'm supposed
to go home before August.

58
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,348
If I had my way, I'd
keep you here forever.

59
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,478
Pat? What are you
gonna wear tonight?

60
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,562
Oh, I got...

61
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,855
Last year's salary.

62
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,774
It wasn't that expensive.

63
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,400
Ah! Oh, yeah?

64
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:01,991
And what are you
gonna wear, Dad?

65
00:06:01,993 --> 00:06:02,893
My tux.

66
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,267
The one you wore
to your wedding?

67
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,641
Yeah, the one
I wore to my wedding.

68
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,991
You know, fashion's never
been your father's thing.

69
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,202
It's a year old, dear.

70
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,579
I think he looks handsome
in his wedding pictures.

71
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,122
There you are.
The voice of sanity.

72
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,207
I agree.

73
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,541
Handsome, but conservative.

74
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,584
I agree.

75
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,949
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
you're on my side, remember?

76
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,381
A woman's entitled
to change her mind.

77
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,739
Uh, no, thanks.
We’ll take the next one.

78
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,642
Okay.

79
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,394
Who's driving me to work? Me.

80
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,603
Let's go.

81
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,492
AII aboard!

82
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,329
Thank you, my lady.

83
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,125
Vroom! Fasten your seat belts.

84
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,670
You better be careful, honey.

85
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,714
Remember what happened
to Narcissus.

86
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,174
Nar who?

87
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,259
Greek mythology.

88
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,984
He was a guy who loved looking at
his reflection so much in a pond,

89
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,596
he fell in and drowned.

90
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,181
Only a boy could be that clumsy.

91
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,684
You got that right. BRUCE: Hey!

92
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,235
What's wrong?

93
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,282
Well, every new building
has its problems.

94
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,412
But we’ll get those problems
before they get us, right? Huh?

95
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:38,874
Right?

96
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,500
Right.

97
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,013
Hold it, please!

98
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,664
Bye, honey.

99
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,249
Have a good day.

100
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,918
Thanks for the lift.

101
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,836
Bye, Dad.

102
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,422
Morning, there, Gene.
How you doing?

103
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,594
Morning, Bruce. Mornin'.

104
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,833
Morning, Mr. Gardner.
Morning, Bill.

105
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,060
What's with the heat, anyway?

106
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,465
I don't know.
I'm checkin' it now.

107
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,188
Probably got a thermo
on the fritz.

108
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,233
Well, get it fixed and have somebody
check out freight elevator 15.

109
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,438
Got a bit of a stutter in it.

110
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,693
15? Sure.

111
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,278

00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,733
Takamitsu doesn't want them
intermingling with his work, darling.

166
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,568
Oh, yeah? Is he gonna
be responsible

167
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,905
for $26,000 worth of
postmodern neo-abstraction?

168
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,366
Well, you're the one
who gave him carte blanche.

169
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,742
Is everything set with
the caterers? Yes.

170
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,868
The brochures, the music?
Yes, yes.

171
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,163
Everything is set. Calm down,
go sit down and relax.

172
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,290
Nothing is gonna go wrong.

173
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,834
Okay.

174
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,043
Okay.

175
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,878
Hey, not over there!

176
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,715
MAN 1: That's where
he told us to put it.

177
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,679
MAN 2: Take it easy.

178
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,389
MAN 3: Watch it!

179
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,890
It's okay. We got it.

180
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,600
No problem here.

181
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,310
Okay, whoo!

182
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,813
Nothing's gonna go wrong, huh?

183
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,400
<i>KANE: Patricia.</i>

184
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,986
<i>Оh, Тrish.</i>

185
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,742
<i>Carol Anne.</i>

186
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,330
So, are you coming
to my party tonight?

187
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,415
I don't think so.

188
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,458
How come?

189
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,942
She can't come
to our party tonight.

190
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,795
She has to stay upstairs
and take care of Carol Anne.

191
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,173
'Cause her mother's having
her own party tonight.

192
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,049
I heard her mother tell Mom.

193
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,260
It's my party, not ours.

194
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,304
Listen, mouth,
Pat's not my mother.

195
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,723
And if I wanted to come to
your brother's party, I could.

196
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,950
Hey, Bruce. You got a second?

197
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,035
Yeah, what's up, Nate?

198
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,268
Come here, let me
show you somethin'.

199
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,080
Okay.

200
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,460
AII right. Where we goin'?

201
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,806
What? Somebody broke
the mirror. Replace it.

202
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,474
Oh, not just this panel.

203
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:33,186
Every panel from the concourse
all the way up to the top.

204
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,813
Hey, Nathan.

205
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,523
Bill. Mr. Gardner.

206
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,608
You guys have to see this.

207
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,921
BRUCE: Ice.

208
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,216
Now, how the hell
could that happen?

209
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,553
Kind of hoped you'd
tell us, Mr. Gardner.

210
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,478
Sally, call the heating and
air conditioning contractor,

211
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,188
and tell Stan to
get down to my office

212
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,525
with a schematic for the
ventilation system. Pronto.

213
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,778
<i>SALLY ON WALKY-TALKY:</i>
<i>Yеs, sir, Mr. Gardnеr.</i>

214
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,216
How come you go to the
Seaton school for weirdos?

215
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,177
It's for smart kids,
not weirdos.

216
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,942
Yeah, that's why you
don't go there, mouth!

217
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,139
Martin!

218
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,350
There she is.

219
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,894
Yeah, okay.

220
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,737
Thank you, Mrs. Moyer.

221
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,406
Boo! Seen any ghosts lately?

222
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,866
Leave her alone.

223
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,075
You a cop or somethin'?

224
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,744
Hey, watch it,
you little asshole!

225
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,662
Scott! Shut the door!

226
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,839
You're so declasse.

227
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,935
Damn.

228
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,021
Carol Anne.

229
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,940
Yeah, I know.

230
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,192
The kids have
started teasing her.

231
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,403
I was hoping we could keep
her ghosts in my closet.

232
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,864
This doesn't make
my job any easier.

233
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,784
That's why you get
the big bucks, Doc.

234
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:53,910
Funny, Deborah.

235
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,620
You could call in an exorcist.

236
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,955
Funnier.

237
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,561
Donna! I'm really sorry you're
not comin' to the party.

238
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,522
I kind of hoped you...

239
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,482
You were.

240
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:28,069
Oh, Scott!
My knight in shining acne.

241
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,613
HELEN: Marcie, shut up
and leave them alone.

242
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,908
Maybe we could catch
a movie tomorrow night.

243
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,910
Maybe. Call me.

244
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,583
Excuse me. Thanks.

245
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,751
He's still panting.

246
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,255
You know, I wish Dusty would,
like, pant that for me, you know.

247
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,756
Jeff's constantly in heat.

248
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,842
I practically have to
muzzle him every night.

249
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,010
It's a real drag.

250
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,429
Maybe he could,
like, give Dusty ideas?

251
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,472
I don't know
if you could handle it.

252
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,391
Well, it'd be totally
radical to try.

253
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,518
Get a grip, girls.

254
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:15,408
This is <i>the Second Piano
</i> Concerto by Chopin.

255
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,622
I’ll bet all of
you probably think

256
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:26,002
this was written by some old geezer
who looked like Dr. Seaton, hmm?

257
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,381
<i>Well, it wasn't.</i>

258
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,551
In fact, Freddy
Chopin composed this

259
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,345
when he was only 19 years old.

260
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,515
And he'd already written a lot.

261
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,811
He'd been playing by ear and
making up tunes since he was six.

262
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:51,110
At eight, he had written his
first of several polonaises.

263
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,073
And at the ripe old age of 12,

264
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,034
he was asked to play
for the Czar of Russia.

265
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,121
Pretty scary, huh?

266
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,040
Even for an old-timer of 12.

267
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,932
But in a school like this,
where we're dealing

268
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,092
with gifted children
with emotional problems,

269
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,927
what we have to
do is open them up.

270
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,804
So, we try to make
them aware of the fact

271
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,265
that other famous child prodigies
shared similar problems.

272
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,393
It makes them comfortable to
know they're not that different.

273
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,814
These kids are about to find out that
Chopin was almost crippled by shyness

274
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,440
and used his music
to overcome it.

275
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,693
Excuse me, Dr. Seaton.
That little blonde girl

276
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,071
keeps staring at the
mirror as if she sees us.

277
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,408
Do you think she can?

278
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,535
MAN: No.

279
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,703
But you think she's
staring straight at you?

280
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:45,957
Yeah.

281
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,251
That seems to be one
of her dubious talents,

282
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,961
making people believe things.

283
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,087
Has she ever...

284
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,047
Let's talk in the hall.

285
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,569
SEATON: She's a very interesting
case, our Carol Anne.

286
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,530
Reasonably well-balanced,
extremely intelligent,

287
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,532
IQ well into the 150s,

288
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,576
and one hell of an imagination.

289
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,743
MAN: Most bright kids do.

290
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,620
True, but even
the brightest ones

291
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,707
allow adults to intimidate
them back to reality.

292
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,668
"Hey, Dad, there's a
purple cow in our yard."

293
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,254
"What, are you nuts?
Get out of here."

294
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,465
But Carol Anne's different than
most of our other little geniuses.

295
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,385
She seems to be able to
project her imagination,

296
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,680
convince others that the purple
cow in the yard is real.

297
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,058
Apparently, she actually
convinced an entire neighborhood

298
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,935
that it was haunted.

299
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,353
Yep, there's a talent.

300
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,856
You think she's able to create
some sort of mass hysteria?

301
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,235
No, not really. It's
more like mass hypnosis.

302
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,865
As I work with her... Try to work
with her, the child's impossible.

303
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:05,286
The more I'm convinced she actually might
be capable of inducing mass hypnosis.

304
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,996
Have you put her under?

305
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,373
Only once. It was terrifying.

306
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,209
MAN: For her? For both of us.

307
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,878
I started to experience
what she was seeing.

308
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,946
Tangina.

309
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,158
My God.

310
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,161
He found her.

311
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,330
Oh!

312
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,915
He found her.

313
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,753
I'm sorry.
Stay, finish your tea.

314
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,713
I've got to go.

315
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,889
Mommy, where are you? I can't see you!
Where are you?

316
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,476
He's after me, Mommy!
He's after me! I'm scared!

317
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,603
Yes, I am running!
I'm running, Mommy!

318
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,189
I can't find you!
He's getting closer!

319
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,440
Who?

320
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,943
The man! The ugly man!

321
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:23,239
Shh, I've got you, Carol Anne.
You're safe. Shh.

322
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,410
You're in your room in Cuesta Verde.
You're safe.

323
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,161
Everything's calm.

324
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,884
Carol Anne,

325
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,387
tell me about
what's just happened.

326
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,390
The man wanted me to
lead him into the light.

327
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,312
It's so cold there.
I heard them talking.

328
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,064
He said it was my daddy's
fault 'cause of the houses,

329
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,900
the houses my daddy
built on their graves.

330
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,111
He said I had to lead
'em into the light.

331
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,988
Into the light!

332
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,906
Why do you have to
lead them, Carol Anne?

333
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,992
I was born in that house.

334
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,246
Robbie! Robbie!
The tree's eating Robbie!

335
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,497
Sleep.

336
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,009
I'm going to count
to three, Carol Anne.

337
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,179
And when I snap my
fingers, you will awaken.

338
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,598
You will not remember
any of this.

339
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:34,727
One, two, three...

340
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,358
How do you feel?

341
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,984
Okay.

342
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,612
Carol Anne, one word.

343
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,740
How do you feel
deep down inside?

344
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,742
One word.

345
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,453
I don't know.

346
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,790
Well, lonely, maybe.

347
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,839
Lonely, huh?

348
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,388
Sure, why not?

349
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,473
It gets lonely being away
from home, doesn't it?

350
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,851
Yeah. Aunt Tri... Pat.

351
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,812
Pat and Bruce and
Donna are real nice,

352
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,980
but I miss my mom and dad.

353
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,315
And even my brother.

354
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,121
That's very good.

355
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,414
What?

356
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,059
They way you made
me look in the mirror.

357
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,418
<i>I didn't</i>
<i>make you look at anything.</i>

358
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,129
That's what he meant.
Manipulation.

359
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,172
What were you looking
at that made me turn?

360
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,091
Nothing.

361
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,510
Carol Anne, you were
looking at something.

362
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,513
I don't wanna talk about it.

363
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,475
When you talk about things
that bother you, they go away.

364
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,769
No, if you talk about
things, they happen.

365
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,312
Who told you that?

366
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,606
Go away!

367
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,204
Are you all right?

368
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,373
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

369
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,339
WOMAN: What happened?
What broke the mirror?

370
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:34,180
A little demonstration
in mass hypnosis.

371
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:39,602
She made me believe I saw a coffee
mug fly off my desk into the mirror,

372
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,521
while giving you a
suggestion to smash it.

373
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,721
Beautiful sight, isn't it?

374
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,805
Mmm-hmm.

375
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,685
Did I ever tell you how to
make a little girl laugh?

376
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,896
I never did, huh?

377
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,565
Well, it takes
a lot of practice.

378
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,609
First thing you got to do

379
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,238
is tickle right
here under the ribs.

380
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:39,662
Hey, don't worry about that seven years'
bad luck stuff. That's old wives' tales.

381
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,871
I didn't break it.

382
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,458
Hey, I believe you. But
I’ll tell you a secret.

383
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,586
If that old nerd were my
doctor, I would have done it.

384
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,338
I didn't. He did.

385
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,215
Dr. Seaton?

386
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,341
No.

387
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,595
I don't wanna talk
about it, okay?

388
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,391
Okay.

389
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,019
See you, slugger.

390
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,796
How's Carol Anne?

391
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,299
I don't know.

392
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,264
How would you feel if some quack told
you you had supernatural powers?

393
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,601
Do you remember that guy that
was on all the talk shows?

394
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,895
What was his name? He was
from Israel or someplace.

395
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,773
He used to bend keys,
fix watches,

396
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,235
took Polaroids of himself in the dark.
Maybe Carol Anne...

397
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,696
Pat, please. Not you, too.

398
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,968
Give the kid a break,
will you, please?

399
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,826
First your crazy brother-in-law
uses her as a scapegoat

400
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,287
for those $250,000 collapsible
homes he built...

401
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,371
Oh, Steven didn't...

402
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:08,125
Steven and your sister have put
that poor thing through hell

403
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,586
with those weirdo psychics
and witch doctors.

404
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,756
"Weirdo psychics
and witch doctors?"

405
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,798
Come on!

406
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,634
Pat, darling,

407
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,387
you are the only sane person
in your family. Please.

408
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,017
Don't let that pompous-ass
shrink tell you

409
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,436
she's Carrie or Houdini

410
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,688
or some damn thing like that.

411
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,190
Look, Bruce,
nobody really knows

412
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,734
what happened there
this afternoon.

413
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,488
Maybe we shouldn't leave
the girls here alone tonight.

414
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,908
Yeah, well, maybe we should just
forget the opening altogether, huh?

415
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,576
Don't be stupid.

416
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,746
AII right, all right.
We're both bein' stupid.

417
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,511
You've got opening night jitters and
I got a building falling apart.

418
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,085
Exactly, and we really
needed my sister

419
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,753
pressuring us
into taking her kid

420
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,171
like we needed
a hole in the head.

421
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:57,549
I really don't mind a house
full of beautiful women.

422
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,177
The more the merrier.

423
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,304
Yeah, then hire us a maid.

424
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,848
Swedish? About 24?

425
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,851
Five feet two?
Talk about pressure.

426
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,561
Will you go get dressed?

427
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,897
What did I say? What did I say?

428
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,666
Hi, sweetie. Can I have
a good night kiss?

429
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,793
Ah.

430
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,670
Mmm.

431
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,130
AII set.

432
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,671
Have a good night's sleep.

433
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,299
Good night. Night.

434
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,301
Be right with you.

435
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,348
She's got the hots
for him. I'm serious.

436
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,308
No, I see her every single day.

437
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,894
Look for her at the beginning of the day.
I'm dead serious.

438
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:51,979
She follows him all the time.

439
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,063
Will you...

440
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,189
Yeah, well...

441
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,524
Will you do me a favor?

442
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,608
Hmm?

443
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,735
No ghost stories
tonight, all right?

444
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,986
Gotcha.

445
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,238
Yeah? Yeah.

446
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,906
Okay. Good night.

447
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:03,991
Bye.

448
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,368
My dad. I don't know
what he's talking about.

449
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,752
Not bad at all.

450
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,212
Forget it.

451
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,965
However, after the opening...

452
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:42,112
Sandy, I know it's gonna be a
great party, but I can't come.

453
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,699
No, I'm brat-sitting.
She's not even a relative.

454
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,869
Well, she's sort of a
relative, but not really.

455
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,831
Yeah, well, if Scott wants
to call me from the party,

456
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,708
I might talk to him.

457
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,338
Okay.

458
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,964
Bye.

459
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,051
What you doin'?

460
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,345
Eavesdroppin'.

461
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,305
Why don't you go
to Martin's party?

462
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,640
You know I can't.

463
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,309
I’ll cover for you.
They’ll never know.

464
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,646
If I get caught, we’ll
both get in trouble.

465
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,481
I can take the heat.

466
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,528
Listen, Carol Anne, I didn't mean
what I said to Sandy on the phone.

467
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,822
Oh, I don't mind being
"sort of a relative,"

468
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,949
as long as we're friends.

469
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,492
Good.

470
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,530
Takamitsu, there are some people
over here I'd like you to meet.

471
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,550
Hey, looks like the show
is a success, darling.

472
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:30,387
Pat, Bruce! Like the art.
Love the sushi.

473
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,471
It's nice to see you.

474
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,807
Excuse me. Pat, come here,
I gotta talk to you.

475
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,893
Hello, Mary.

476
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,145
Uh, Bruce, you tryin' to
save money on the heat here?

477
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,564
Oh, I wish that were the case.
You know, new equipment.

478
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,274
Tryin' to work out
the bugs and all that.

479
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,525
Good to see you.

480
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,580
Hey, you look great.

481
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,789
Anne Klein II.

482
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:58,957

Hey, you look great.

484
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,599
Look, maybe I ought to
stay home with you tonight.

485
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,851
Just go already. I’ll be fine.

486
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,616
How come you're taking
your dad's passkey?

487
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,910
I'm gonna use the
emergency stairs

488
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,329
so nobody sees
me in the elevator.

489
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,872
You got Martin's number, right?

490
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,791
Yes. I won't stay long.

491
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,875
Have fun.

492
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,335
Okay.

493
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,836
Bye. Be good.

494
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:45,921
I will.

495
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,246
Hi. Hi.

496
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,018
What's the matter?
Is the stereo broken?

497
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,168
No, it's my parents.

498
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,920
I thought they weren't
going to be home.

499
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,506
Tell me about it. My
father's not feeling well,

500
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,758
and my mom says if she
can hear the party,

501
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,343
the party's over.

502
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,761
I thought you couldn't come.

503
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,264
Couldn't stay away
from hot Scott, huh?

504
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,434
Marcie, back to your cage.
It's feeding time.

505
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,643
Psst.

506
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,812

DONNA: Hey, there,
hi, there, ho, there.

511
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,369
I can't believe I risked
getting into trouble for this.

512
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,955
I bet we could
find some trouble.

513

514

Yeah, sounds great. How
many bedrooms you got?

515
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,461
Shut up, Jeff.

516
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,545
Carol Anne's up there.

517
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,389
Is there something open
down in the galleria?

518
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,883
Uh, forget it.
Didn't bring my fake ID.

519

What?

520

That's where my stepmother's having a party.
I can't go down there.

Smoking more now
and enjoying it less?

708
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,035
Thinking more
and enjoying it less.

709
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,620
Pat, there's
something wrong. I...

710
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:18,871
Tell me about it.

711
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,916
Takamitsu offended everyone
he talked to tonight.

712
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,627
Excuse me, Mr. Gardner.
Just got a call.

713
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:28,005
There's a bunch of kids
partying up in the pool

714
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,883
who claim they're guests
of your daughter.

715
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,301
Excuse me.

716
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,104
BRUCE: Okay,

717
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,148
so you all left the party together
and they let you in here,

718
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,402
went to the security room
to turn off the camera,

719
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,654
and then where did they go?

720
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,716
I don't know where
Scott and Donna went.

721
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,534
We didn't hurt anything. AII
we were doing was swimmin'.

722
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,098
Where was Carol Anne
through all this?

723
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,829
Not with us.

724
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,253
Okay. Thanks, guys. Take
the kids back to 56E.

725
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,898
I’ll have a talk with
the parents later.

726
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,007
Right, Mr. Gardner. Come on!

727
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:14,176
Great. My parents are going
to ground me till I'm 40.

728
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,970
Hey, it’ll give
you time to study.

729
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,514
You might pass something
besides Auto Shop this year.

730
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,656
Donna.

731
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,741
Scott?

732
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:19,992
Donna.

733
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,620
They... Scott!

734
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,997
They... They got Donna.

735
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,332
Who? Who's got Donna?

736
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,458
They got Donna and...

737
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:28,959
What're you saying?
And they got Carol Anne.

738
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,669
Who's got Carol Anne?
They got 'em.

739
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,421
Who, damn it, who?

740
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,179
What happened?

741
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,972
He just came up
through the ice.

742
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,725
What ice?

743
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,018
The ice in the...

744
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:48,979
Pool.

745
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:57,029
She's gotten to you, too. It's
a suggestion, Mr. Gardner.

746
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,406
A posthypnotic suggestion.

747
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:03,244
They got 'em. They got Donna
and they got Carol Anne.

748
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,121
They got them both.

749
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,789
They've got 'em.

750
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,708
They got 'em.

751
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,645

00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,984
Stay back. He's got the
girls and now he wants you.

784
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,570
What are you talking about?

785
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,322
The preacher Kane.

786
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,574
He knows that as long
as there's someone

787
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,953
on this side that loves them,
you can get them back.

788
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,997
How did you know
that wasn't Carol Anne?

789
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,000
What surprised me, dear,

790
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,461
is that you didn't.

791
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,757
Who the hell are you?

792
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,303
I'm one of your
brother-in-law's

793
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,639
weirdo psychics.

794
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,557
Shh.

795
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:34,645
Carol Anne and Donna
are not in that room.

796
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,858
Well, some goddamn thing is.

797
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,193
Oh, yes.

798
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,196
Anger, rage,

799
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:48,200
evil, they are in that room.

800
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,078
Can you feel the cold?

801
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,122
He's devouring the heat,

802
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,040
the energy.

803
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,960
He's gathering his strength.

804
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,714
We must find the girls before
he becomes too strong.

805
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,216
If Donna and Carol Anne
aren't in that room,

806
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,342
then where are they?

807
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,720
The other side.

808
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,306
Before we can find the girls,

809
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,058
we must find out
where they entered.

810
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,563
Where did Dr. Rasputin

811
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,398
take Scott?

812
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:24,069
WOMAN: Excuse me, Dr. Seaton?

813
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,281
Excuse us.

814
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,749
Do your stuff.

815
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,175
Okay, Scott,

816
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,178
I want you to
look at the light.

817
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,556
Look at the light.

818
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,434
Look at the light.

819
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,696
Security.

820
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,448
Burt, this is Gardner.

821
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,783
Could you get your
guys together, please?

822
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,108
My daughter and niece are
roaming the building somewhere,

823
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,330
and I'd like them found
as soon as possible, okay?

824
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,583
What?

825
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,169
Oh, damn it.

826
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,880
Yeah, okay.

827
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,217
Terrific.

828
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,805
First, the heating,
then the electrical problems.

829
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,933
Now the security monitors.

830
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,978
Oh, Bruce, this is really
happening, isn't it?

831
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,981
Depends on who
you want to believe.

832
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,153
Tweedledum or tweedle-dumber.

833
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:55,994
Scott,

834
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,164
you and Donna are
at the swimming pool.

835
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:01,959
SEATON: You're leaving.

836
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,002
Where are you going?

837
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,673
The security room.

838
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,342
We saw Carol Anne
on the monitor.

839
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,387
Which monitor?

840
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,848
She was in the garage.

841
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,685
The puddle.

842
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,354
Hands came out of the puddle!

843
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,607
They grabbed us, the hands!

844
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,068
Keep her away from me!

845
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,071
Keep her away from me!

846
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:32,739
Shh.

847
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,536
What puddle?

848
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,289
What puddle, Scott?

849
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,541
What puddle?

850
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:46,170
The... In the garage.

851
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,547
In the garage.

852
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,215
In the garage!

853
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,742
They're between dimensions,

854
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,827
behind reflections,

855
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,414
behind mirrors,
stealing images.

856
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:25,626
Carol Anne.

857
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,921
Carol Anne.

858
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,173
Carol Anne!

859
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,677
<i>CAROL ANNE: The light!</i>
<i>Тhe light!</i>

860
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,807
<i>It's so cold.</i>
<i>Тhe light, it's so cold!</i>

861
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:42,976
Carol Anne,

862
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,187
listen to me.

863
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,773
Find your way
back to your room.

864
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,067
You must go back to your room.

865
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,986
<i>He won't let me.</i>

866
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,821
<i>I'm so cold!</i>

867
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,782
<i>I'm so cold!</i>

868
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:00,285
Find Donna and go back to your room.
Run, Carol Anne, run!

869
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,372
Enough. Stop this
stupid sideshow.

870
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:05,707
Oh, it's a great act.

871
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,710
Carol Anne creates the
fire and you feed it.

872
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,712
You made this happen.

873
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:14,341
You made her talk about him,
you made her remember him.

874
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:17,803
He was lost.
You brought him here.

875
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,012
Ludicrous.

876
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,182
It's your choice.

877
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:24,977
Tweedledum

878
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,980
or tweedle-dumber.

879
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,195
Tell us what to do.

880
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,492
Pray that Carol Anne
heard me and listens.

881
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:44,037
We must get up there
as fast as we can.

882
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,459
SEATON: This is
stupid, idiotic!

883
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,169
What's the matter
with you people?

884
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,422
Can't you see that
Carol Anne's behind this?

885
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:55,340
She's making us believe
this is happening.

886
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,758
It's... It's all a hypnotic...

887
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,260
It's about as stupid
and idiotic

888
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:01,722
as you hypnotizing that coffee
cup through the mirror.

889
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,696
That's good.

890
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:23,535
He’ll try to trick you.
He’ll try to separate you.

891
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,037
Don't let him.

892
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,581
Your love, your bond,

893
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:33,045
your caring for these two children,
is our most valuable weapon.

894
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,930
Let me take the chances.

895
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,850
What's that?

896
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,894
Some sort of mystical amulet?

897
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,021
A tool of your trade?

898
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,606
It was a gift.

899
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,608
From a good friend.

900
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:59,154
A powerful medicine man who
walked among the spirits

901
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,448
and returned.

902
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,202
There's power here.

903
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:09,247
I only pray it is enough.

904
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,841
Because Kane still
thinks he needs her.

905
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,761
He was insane when he lived,

906
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,180
and now, in death,

907
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:26,932
that insanity

908
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,434
has become the beast.

909
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,145
He wants Carol Anne now,

910
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,773
before she grows up.

911
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,943
Youth is a strong life force.

912
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:41,780
Innocence is pure life force.

913
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,992
We lose strength as we
lose our innocence.

914
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:50,455
You see, innocence is the only
gift we're given in life.

915
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,917
AII else must be fought for.

916
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,463
In that gift is purity.

917
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,633
In that purity

918
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,052
lies strength.

919
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,888
That's a lot of crap
that doesn't mean anything.

920
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,557
Shut up, Seaton.

921
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,362
Unlock it.

922

I can't deal with this anymore.

980
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:13,677
Bruce, I love you and Donna.
That's our family.

981
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,720
Let's get out of here.

982
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,205
Let Dr. Seaton
deal with Carol Anne.

983
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:18,640
Baby, she's your niece.

984
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:19,891
I don't care.

985
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,894
I can't take these sick
little games anymore.

986
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:26,898
I never should have let Steven
and Diane send her to us.

987
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,733
Carol Anne! Bruce!

988
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,151
Bruce, please!

989
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,618
Carol Anne!

990
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,249
Bruce!

991
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,926
Dad! Dad!

992
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,554
Relax, Donna. Relax.

993
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,681
You're safe.

994
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:02,267
You're just having a bad dream.

995
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:05,270
We're all having a bad dream.

996
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,315
Where's my dad? I want my dad.

997
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:13,778
Lie here and relax
and I’ll go get your dad.

998
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:23,204
SEATON: Mr. Gardner?
Mrs. Gardner?

999
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:28,668
Hello?

1000
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,474
Carol Anne.

1001
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:47,960
DONNA: And they
thought it was her.

1002
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,285
Carol Anne?

1003
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:14,792
Carol Anne!

1004
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,003
PAT: Bruce!

1005
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:19,839
Bruce?

1006
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:38,483
Carol Anne?

1007
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,695
Carol Anne!

1008
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:44,572
Bruce!

1009
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,657
I saw her.

1010
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,075
You think you saw her.

1011
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:48,952
I saw her, damn it.

1012
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:52,038
Your daughter's upstairs, a
shivering, emotional wreck.

1013
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:55,583
Then you run out on me to chase
after that evil little brat again.

1014
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,586
Don't you understand? Don't
you see what she's doing?

1015
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,255
It's just like Dr. Seaton said.

1016
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:03,591
Nothing Seaton said explains
what happened tonight.

1017
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:07,845
Come on.

1018
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:22,402
CAROL ANNE: The man!
The ugly man!

1019
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,749
Remember what Tangina said.

1020
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:51,991
Open!

1021
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:05,213
Help! Help us!

1022
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:08,383
Help us!

1023
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:16,891
Oh, God!

1024
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:17,975
BRUCE: Help!

1025
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,314
PAT: Help!

1026
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:25,650
Help!

1027
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:28,403
<i>TANGINA: Outside in!</i>

1028
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:33,032
PAT: Help! Help us!

1029
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:36,119
Help! Help!

1030
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:41,040
Outside in!

1031
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,400
Tangina gave this to me.

1032
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:11,487
She gave this to us!

1033
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:14,949
She's trying to save us.

1034
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:16,742
She's trying to
bring us through this!

1035
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:18,244
It's a lie!

1036
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:20,496
It's not true, any of this!
Oh, baby.

1037
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:21,789
It's not true. You're a liar!

1038
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:24,250
This... None of it's
true. You're a liar.

1039
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:25,585
She's trying to
get us through, Pat.

1040
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:28,129
She's trying to save our lives!
You're a liar.

1041
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:30,506
Just hold on, Pat. Just hold on.

1042
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:34,343
Just hold on, baby.

1043
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:37,430
Just hold on.

1044
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,278
No!

1045
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,452
Who are you?

1046
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:48,584
What do you want?

1047
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:50,294
<i>You!</i>

1048
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,095
Bruce!

1049
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:03,177
It's not cold anymore.

1050
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:05,930
She said we could do it!

1051
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,682
She said we could beat 'em!

1052
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:09,392
It's over, baby!

1053
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:11,227
It's over, darlin'!

1054
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:12,603
Oh, I want to believe that.

1055
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,438
What? Oh, believe it!

1056
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:16,399
Believe it!

1057
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:19,985
It's finished and
we did it together.

1058
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:43,259
Look at you.

1059
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:45,845
You two are pitiful.

1060
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:49,890
You know what? No, I don't wanna know.
I understand these things.

1061
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:53,394
Anyway, everybody went home.
And it went fine. I locked up.

1062
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:57,022
You two can read about it
tomorrow in the society columns.

1063
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,442
Newlyweds.

1064
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:02,945
Oh! Donna's been lookin' for you.
She called.

1065
01:19:03,029 --> 01:19:05,156
She and Carol Anne are
upstairs with that shrink,

1066
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,866
what's-his-name
from the school.

1067
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,492
Maybe, you ought to
talk to him, honey.

1068
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:11,620
He's probably never met
anybody with a garage fetish.

1069
01:19:13,498 --> 01:19:14,999
Manana, y'all.

1070
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:38,172
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Stanley,
how are you tonight?

1071
01:19:38,198 --> 01:19:39,899
I, uh... I have been
doing some plumbing.

1072
01:19:39,983 --> 01:19:41,150
Sorry for the inconvenience.

1073
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:42,994
What inconvenience?
We didn't have a problem.

1074
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,362
Well, if there was a problem,
I'm really very sorry.

1075
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,782
But the hot water's
gonna be on very soon.

1076
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:53,412
Well, I had to say somethin'.
I mean, look at us.

1077
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:56,874
I know. I didn't get much use
out of last year's salary, huh?

1078
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,793
I think you look great wet.

1079
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,961
Well, you can lie like
that anytime you want to.

1080
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,379
I usually do.

1081
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:03,714
I know.

1082
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:08,969
I can't wait to get upstairs,
stretch out in bed and...

1083
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:10,846
Act normal.

1084
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,140
Oh, getting upstairs
sounds great.

1085
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:14,809
What have you got in mind?

1086
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:17,144
Packing up everything that
belongs to that little brat

1087
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:19,605
and sending her
home to my sister.

1088
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:24,151
It wasn't her fault.

1089
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:27,780
<i>KANE: Yеs, it is!</i>

1090

Oh, my God.

1091
01:23:14,572 --> 01:23:16,198
Outside in. What?

1092
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:19,743
BRUCE: Damn it, that's it! Outside in.
That's what Tangina said.

1093
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,704
He controls the inside,
but not the outside.

1094
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:24,123
We can still get to him.
Come on!

1095
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,375
Don't look down.

1096
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:59,027
AII right, hold onto this.

1097
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:00,821
No matter what
happens, don't let go.

He only wants me!

You don't love me. You
don't want me here!

1106

My parents
don't love me either.

1107

Give me Tangina's necklace and you
can have Bruce and Donna back.

They're your family.

1111
01:27:16,522 --> 01:27:18,190
I’ll go with Kane.

1112

something to you, not me.

I love them.

1142
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:54,805
And I have this to protect me.

1143
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:16,493
<i>KANE: The necklace!</i>

1144
01:30:24,335 --> 01:30:26,336
<i>KANE: Give me the necklace.</i>

1145
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:27,754
No!

1146
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:29,881
<i>The necklace!</i>

1147
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:31,007
No!

1148
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:06,626
TANGINA: Kane!

1149
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:10,839
Give her back her family.

1150
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:16,428
You don't need them!
You don't need Carol Anne!

1151
01:31:16,512 --> 01:31:18,388
I can lead you into the light!

1152
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:23,810
I have the knowledge
and the power!

1153
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,912
No! Tangina, don't!

1154
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:45,290
Tell me how to use the necklace,
so I can save all of you.

1155
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,626
Thank you, Pat,

1156
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:50,045
but this is the
way it has to be.

1157
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:53,256
Say goodbye to
Carol Anne for me.

1158
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:56,760
Tell her I’ll always love her,

1159
01:31:58,429 --> 01:32:01,056
and that her nightmare is over.

1160
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:06,978
Tangina!

1161
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:11,858
Tangina.

1162
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:18,782
Tangina, wait!

1163
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:23,328
Where are they?

1164
01:32:37,426 --> 01:32:38,802
<i>BRUCE: Pat.</i>

1165
01:32:44,767 --> 01:32:45,934
Bruce.

1166
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:00,448
Bruce.

1167
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:34,566
She did it.

1168
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:37,861
She saved us.

1169
01:33:56,804 --> 01:34:33,804
