and they're on sale
in the lobby of this theatre.

If not, ask at your favourite toy
or department store.

1253
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:00,430
Don't let your child be left out.
Christmas isn't very far away.

1254
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:02,570
I love you, FT.

1255
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:09,540
- I want an FT!

(ROMANTIC MUSIC)

1260
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,280
- A fine couple.
- Yeah.

1261
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:04,780
Have you seen Matt?

1262
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,950
He said he was going back to destroy
that transformation equipment.

1263
01:35:08,050 --> 01:35:10,620
- Good idea. He's a fine boy, too.
- Yeah.

# But get my rocks off

1270
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:36,170
# When those big-breasted tomatoes
go to the beach #

1271
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:40,400
Hold it right there!
Where do you think you're going?

1272
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:45,910
My son and a lot of other people
have worked hard on this movie.

1273
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:49,990
You sit right there
and watch these credits!

1274
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:51,960
# And take their tops off

# I get around, round,
get around, I get around

1279

# Those southern girls how they hypnotise

1280
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:12,970
# Got the cutest way of talking
And I like their eyes

1281

You got to see them drivin'

# And I love to see her swaying

1287
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:47,690
# She got a rhythm of her own

1288
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:56,600
# Someday soon if I keep praying, praying

1289
01:36:56,700 --> 01:37:00,440
# She might see how big I've grown

'Well, what did you think
of that one, Sid?'

1295
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:21,750
'That had to be one
of the worst movies I ever saw.'

1299
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,930
- I'd like that.
- Let's do that tomorrow.

All right. Who let those carrots in here?

Hey, you carrots, get off the stage!

1302
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:39,984
Hey, wait a minute.
You guys can't come in here.
