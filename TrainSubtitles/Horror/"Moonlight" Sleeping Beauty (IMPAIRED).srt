MICK:
I saw Coraline last night.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,393
JOSEF: Coraline is dead.
- You look like someone I used to know.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,397
- Ex-girlfriend, maybe?
- Ex-wife.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,199
- She's found a cure.
- There is no cure for vampirism.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,796
One of these days, you're gonna
have to stop hating what you are.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,032
- What could be the downside?
- Missing the things that you loved.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,828
Turn me. Turn me.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,709
- Lf she is back, what does she want?
- She's back for Mick.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,309
She's been lying to us, stalking us.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,277
No. She's not a vampire.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,835
She's human. She has a cure.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,837
The object missed her heart,
but punctured her left lung...

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,037
...and partially tore the pericardium.
- Is she gonna live?

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,589
It's a deep wound
and infection has already set in.

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,557
That's her biggest concern right now.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,632
That and a buildup of fluid
around the heart.

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,156
You know, it's a very unusual wound.

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,551
I understand she told the ER doctor
that it was some sort of accident.

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,757
- Do you know what happened?
- No, we don't know what happened.

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,958
Well, all we can do now
is monitor her.

22
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,590
- I'll let you know if there's any change.
- Thank you very much.

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,835
Why did she lie?
Why didn't she tell them I did it?

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,355
She wouldn't want the police involved.

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,316
I can't believe I almost killed her. L...
I thought for sure she was a vampire.

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,636
You couldn't have known.

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,234
I didn't even know.

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,998
You still care for her, don't you?

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,359
She was my wife.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,356
You really think
there's some kind of cure?

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,795
MICK:
Coraline was a vampire for years...

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,875
...and now she's as human
as you are.

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,195
Something changed her back.

34
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,835
And if she dies...

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,040
...I'll never know what that was...

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,231
...or how she did it.

37
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,075
Did you find him?

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,912
That's him. Where is he?

39
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,959
He's living is Los Angeles,
using the name Josef Kostan.

40
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,073
- What do you want me to do?
- What I hired you to do.

41
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,391
- Kill him.
- I'll take the next flight out.

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,109
- It has to be done with fire.
- Fire's impractical.

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,239
- Long range, a single shot to the head...
- No.

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,159
It has to be fire.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,276
- Why fire?
- Because I've said so.

46
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,550
Burn him to death,
and you'll get your money.

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,478
Consider it done.

48
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,153
Trust me on this one, fellas.

49
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,550
You mix it up with mortal girls,
never ends well.

50
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,392
TIM: What?
DAN: You can turn them not mortal.

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,269
JOSEF: It's too much commitment.
- So you're saying, never turn a girl ever?

52
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,998
I'm saying forever's a long time.

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,794
- I know what you're saying.
JOSEF: All right, bets.

54
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,598
I'm in...

55
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,628
...with three AB negatives.

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,835
I'm out.

57
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,157
- What do you got?
- Two pair.

58
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,029
- Two pair, that's it?
JOSEF: Yeah.

59
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,872
DAN: Flush beats that.
- Of fives.

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,149
I guess tonight's my night, boys.

61
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,159
TOM: I'm glad to see you're here,
Mr. St. John.

62
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,594
- What happened, Tom?
- We're still putting the pieces together.

63
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,354
- There aren't many pieces left.
- Josef?

64
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,876
Forensics haven't found
any remains yet, just ash.

65
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,512
Whoever did this brought an awful lot
of firepower to take out just one man.

66
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,393
- How did they get in?
- Had to be real pros.

67
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,678
I've been the head of security
for Mr. Kostan for five years.

68
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,356
There's no way anyone should have been
able to get anywhere near this office.

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,070
MAUREEN: Great, you're still here.
That's why I love you.

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,392
I just had to finish up some copy.
I spent the afternoon in the hospital.

Yeah, Morgan. How's she doing?

72
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,868
She's in pretty bad shape.

73
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,032
Does anyone know
how she hurt herself?

74
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,111
No, she's still unconscious.

75
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,395
Cheer up.

76
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,996
I've got something
to take your mind off Morgan.

Explosion in a downtown office building
took out the top floor.

- Terrorists?
- No.

79
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,276
Apparently the target
was this bigshot hedge-fund trader.

80
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,472
Oh, my God, that's Josef Kostan.
He's a friend of Mick's.

81
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,110
Okay, I take it back.
This is why I love you.

82
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,113
- Was he there?
- Afraid so.

83
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,508
No survivors.

Have a cameraman
meet you down there.

I wanna know
the who, what and why.

I can't cover this.
This guy's a friend of Mick's.

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,712
Great. Use that
to show some vulnerability.

It was poker night.

They used fire. They must have
known he was a vampire.

- Beth, just go away.

in every office.

...parking structure, basement,
even the boiler room.

He even wanted
infrared cameras installed.

465
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,315
Well, for months, I thought
I was keeping my secret from her.

466
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,074
But then I discovered that she knew.

467
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,716
She knew, and she didn't care.

468
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,638
That was the happiest day of my life.

469
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,389
BETH: So you were in love with her.
- I wasrt looking for it, believe me.

470
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,674
The longer we were together,
the more I began to think...

471
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,071
...that the whole reason
that I became a vampire was...

472
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,713
You know, so I could
live long enough to meet her.

473
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,318
You know, it took me
over 350 years to find her.

474
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,312
And only a year to lose her forever.

475
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,636
So, what happened to her?

476
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,950
He tried to turn her.

477
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,277
Yeah. She'd been begging me
to do it for months.

478
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,560
I didn't want to
but she wouldn't let it go.

479
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,598
Now, she knew that was the only way
we could be together.

480
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,751
So I tried.

481
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,469
I drained her and I fed her my blood,
but it didn't work.

482
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,158
She never came out of it.

483
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,954
She got lost somewhere in between.

- I know, but it is.

something will bring her back.

you sure have a low threshold for pain.

That's proof that anything is possible.

511
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,080
Love can show you a part of yourself
you never knew existed.

00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,271
Or a part that you thought
you lost forever.

And then this happened.

I guess the universe
had a different plan for me.

is who I'm supposed to be.

your thing with Beth work?

Well, I hope the universe
