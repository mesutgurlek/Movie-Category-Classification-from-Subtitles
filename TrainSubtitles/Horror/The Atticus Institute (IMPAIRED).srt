Good.

7
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:43,349
My dad had three kids.
Ahem.

8
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,644
Me, my sister, and the institute.

9
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,107
That's just the way it was.

10
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,831
You knew that if you had
a baseball game

11
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,649
or, I don't know,
some sort of special event,

12
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,896
there was always a good chance
he might not be there.

13
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,288
I mean, don't get me wrong,
he was there a good amount of the time.

14
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,370
Just not all the time.

15
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:06,501
I remember I tried to trick him
into thinking I had ESP.

16
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,792
Or that I was moving stuff
around with my mind,

17
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,711
hoping it might get him
to pay a little more attention.

18
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,597
And he'd play along
for a few minutes,

19
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,885
but then he'd leave for work.

20
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,264
I was four, um,
when it happened.

21
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,183
So I don't have too many
memories of my father.

22
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,068
I kinda remember what it felt like
to be with him.

23
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,652
Talking with me, holding me.

24
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,214
One thing I've always remembered
is this game we used to play

25
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,736
on nights when
he'd put me to bed.

26
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,406
He'd ask all these questions
about animals.

27
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,121
How many eyes does a fish have?

28
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,126
And I'd say, "Two."

29
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,708
How many noses
does a monkey have?

30
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,714
How many ears
does a gopher have?

31
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,126
That's really all there was to it.

32
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,420
I remember thinking it was fun.

33
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,302
We got married in 1965.

34
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,438
I wanted children right away,
but Henry wanted to wait.

35
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,691
'Cause it was about that time
that he was starting the institute.

36
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,899
And then he had
a different research lab job

37
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:15,066
at the same time
so we could make rent.

38
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,486
He worked a lot.
Even after we had both kids.

39
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,613
But he loved it.

40
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,782
You know?

41
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,668
A man has the right
to love his work.

42
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,591
Lawrence Henault: Our goal was
to conduct unbiased, empirical research

43
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,473
on exceptional human abilities.

44
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,885
Psychokinesis, ESP, precognition.

45
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:47,522
Things that are typically considered
fringe science or parapsychology.

46
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:51,402
Dr. West, and the rest of us,
quite frankly,

47
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,904
all believed that
there was real science

48
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,905
to be discovered
in these areas.

49
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,240
We had a good time
doing what we were doing.

50
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,076
We were underfunded, of course,

51
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,115
but we were still relatively young,
so it didn't matter.

52
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,250
In the first few years alone,

53
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:11,539
we published close to
30 journal articles between us.

54
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,675
And there were
some truly exceptional cases.

55
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,302
All documented.

56
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,221
Well, we did a lot of different
kinds of tests, but, uh,

57
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,309
probably the most effective one
to measure clairvoyant abilities

58
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,394
were the Zener cards.

59
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,184
This one?

60
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,943
It's the lines.
The wavy lines.

61
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,484
WHEELER: Well, if you
select each card at random,

62
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,699
then the success ratio
will be <i>close</i> to 20%.

63
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,240
But we had several subjects

64
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,876
whose ratio was closer to 30%.

65
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,288
And that might not seem
like very much,

66
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,128
but if you realize
that we did each test

67
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,543
over 200 times,

68
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,427
you begin to understand

69
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,214
the virtual impossibility
of that figure.

70
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,434
SUSAN GERMAN:I think we were all secretly hoping

71
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,813
to discover the next Nina Kulagina.

72
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,601
She was a woman
from the former Soviet Union.

73
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,644
Truly remarkable.

74
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,733
Nina's psychokinetic abilities were
probably the most well-documented

75
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,244
and they stood up
to the strictest of scrutiny.

76
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,033
The closest we encountered
to that level was Norman LeClair.

77
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,747
French-Canadian man.

78
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:37,007
Norman's PK abilities
were astounding at times.

79
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,179
- (GAME VIBRATING)
- DR. WEST: That's how it works.

80
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,934
Pretty simple, huh?

81
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,390
- Yeah.
- (GAME SHUTS OFF)

82
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,896
Try to vibrate the game board.

83
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,535
It's all right.
Take your time.

84
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,213
That's all right. You gave it
your best shot. We can try again later.

85
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,834
HENAULT: Dr. West brought in colleagues,

86
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,972
some well-known and esteemed researchers
at the time,

87
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,303
to observe Norman.

88
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,308
All the necessary steps
were taken

89
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,346
to prevent any claims
of researcher bias

90
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,980
or improper testing methods.

91
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,688
GERMAN: All outside variables were controlled,

92
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,820
for this was to be
the moment the snickering,

93
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,653
the talking behind hands
would finally stop.

94
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,159
This was proof.

95
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,334
- God, I can't believe that.
- Explain that.

96
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,299
- As we said.
- How do you explain that one?

97
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,163
- (CHUCKLING)
- How do you explain that?

98
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,294
- What do you guys think?
- Oh, my God.

99
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,251
WHEELER: Oh, they were clearly impressed.

100
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,040
Even though, I'd have to say,

101
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,051
they didn't really
allow themselves to show it.

102
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,554
I was happy-
I was happy for Hem!!-

103
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,216
He had worked so hard
for that moment.

104
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:56,479
But then,
just before the researchers left...

105
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,561
one of them noticed
something odd

106
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:02,444
on the wristwatch
of one of our research assistants.

107
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,900
And it turned out that this watch

108
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:09,569
had been rigged with a small
neodymium magnet.

109
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,578
And every one of our tests

110
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,910
involved metal in some capacity.

111
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,623
Even the trace amounts
of iron in the cereal.

112
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,501
And this guy had been complicit
with Norman's ruse

113
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,086
right from the start.

114
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,798
Right under our noses.
It was-

115
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,713
it was a crushing blow.

116
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,348
For the institute's credibility

117
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,010
and for Henry's reputation.

118
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,304
It was... it was awful.

119
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:54,450
Is there something else
we should know about?

120
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,990
Judith?

121
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,500
With you?

122
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,214
(WHISPERING)
It's like, um...

123
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,428
it's like being
in a well sometimes.

124
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,855
I can see it, I can hear it,
but nobody knows I'm there.

125
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,948
I'd... I'd like to help you.

126
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,285
Whatever is going on.

127
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,744
WHEELER: Judith was first
brought to the institute

128
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:42,662
in September of 1976
by her sister-

129
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,170
sister Margaret.

130
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,549
She had been reading
about the work we were doing

131
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,459
in a small magazine
or something.

132
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,256
And she thought we would
be interested in testing Judith.

133
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,970
The first thing she did
when she walked in

134
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,510
was she told me
it was my birthday.

135
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,976
Which caught me
a bit off guard.

136
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,187
Not because it was my birthday.
It wasn't, it was the day before.

137
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,398
Maybe it was a guess.

138
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,233
You see, that's something

139
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,114
you always have to guard against
with the work we did.

140
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,617
Lucky guesses.
False positives.

141
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:19,122
If you let yourself fall victim
to a belief bias of any kind,

142
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,410
that's when you start
forcing the pieces together.

143
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,829
Even when they don't fit at all.

144
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,043
Judith...

145
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,712
she seemed average.

146
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,551
She's in her early 40s.

147
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,057
Can't say there's anything particularly
remarkable about her appearance.

148
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,140
She was kind of the type of person
that you would pass by

149
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,724
on the street in any town.

150
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,731
You might say hello, smile,
but that's about it.

151
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,274
You would have no idea

152
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,438
that Judith was what she was.

153
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,665
I was older than her
by seven years.

154
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,452
She was a silly kid.

155
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,121
And we had a lot of fun.

156
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,339
There was one day,
she was around 35,

157
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,472
she slipped on a patch of ice
on the sidewalk

158
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,600
and hurt her back pretty badly.

159
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,396
And after that,
she had a little trouble moving,

160
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,432
getting around.

161
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,899
And her pain was consistent.

162
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,280
It was chronic.

163
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,613
It was enough that
my husband and I decided

164
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,994
that she shouldn't be
living alone anymore.

165
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,123
So she moved in
with us and the kids.

166
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:46,285
About a year after
Judith moved in,

167
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,954
she began to withdraw.

168
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,340
I mean, she would stay
in her room for days.

169
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,297
I'm not sure
she would even eat.

170
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,465
I don't know what she did
when she was alone.

171
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,056
She was reading
some very unusual books.

172
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,470
And that's when it all started.

173
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,560
And I knew things weren't right.

174
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,521
There were things-

175
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,153
there were things
that I saw her do

176
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,486
that I just-

177
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,650
I had to do something.

178
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,698
And to this day,
part of me still regrets

179
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,333
doing what I did, but I had to.

180
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,166
GERMAN: But Dr. West was intrigued
with Judith almost immediately.

181
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,549
Yeah, we all were.

182
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,461
By this point,
we'd researched hundreds of cases,

183
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,131
brought in almost as many
subjects into the lab.

184
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,723
Judith was different, though.

185
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,848
We just had no idea
how different at this point.

186
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,485
DR. WEST: Um, ahem.
Can you tell us your name, please?

187
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,871
Ahem. Judith Winstead.

188
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,702
And what's your date of birth,
Judith?

189
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,959
February 18th, 1935.

190
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,120
And your marital status?

191
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,038
I'm not married.

192
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,878
Have you ever been?

193
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,509
Okay.
How many siblings do you have?

194
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,717
One.

195
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,677
Are your parents still alive?

196
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,062
- Judith, are your parents still alive?
- No.

197
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,724
Okay. Are you right-handed
or left-handed?

198
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,736
Judith's behavior was always odd.
Even from the first day she arrived.

199
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,569
But in our field, it wasn't uncommon
to encounter odd people.

200
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,608
So we didn't give it much thought.

201
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,242
WHEELER: Ms. Winstead?

202
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,829
Right-handed.

203
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,119
DR. WEST: And when did you first realize

204
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,754
you had certain abilities?

205
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,084
Are you... are you all right, dear?

206
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,253
- (SHUDDERING)
- Oh...

207
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,094
You're bleeding.
Oh, my God.

208
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,803
- (YELLS)
- WHEELER: Here's some...

209
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,968
DR. WEST: Give her some towels.

210
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,103
WHEELER: Oh, uh, tilt your head back, okay?

211
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,542
- (LAUGHING)
- Pinch your nose.

212
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,182
DR. WEST: It's not her nose,
it's her hand. Her hand is bleeding.

213
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,147
WHEELER: What?
Did you... did you bite yourself?

214
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,439
DR. WEST: Why?

215
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,530
Susan, let's get her...
get her to the ladies' room, please.

216
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,615
GERMAN: As long as you're okay with it.

217
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,404
That's all right.
Just take her-that's all right.

218
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,494
DR. WEST: Just take care of her.

219
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,373
- GORMAN: Judith?
- (LOUD BANGING)

220
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,957
- Wait, is she... no, no, no.
- (JUDITH SCREAMING)

221
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,542
What is she doing?
Stop.

222
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,799
- GORMAN: Just stop. Calm down.
- JUDITH: Let go.

223
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,335
DR. WEST: Ms. Winstead.
Judith, stop, please.

224
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,632
Well, for starters,
Judith came to us in an unusual way.

225
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:50,301
Most times, we learn of someone
and seek them out.

226
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,596
We had no idea
Judith was even out there.

227
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,149
Nevertheless, she tested beyond

228
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,310
what any of us thought
was even possible.

229
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,985
There was no measure.

230
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,322
Truly no measure
for her abilities.

231
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,280
If you can, try for seven this time.

232
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,074
Any combination.

233
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,378
DR. WEST: Three and four.

234
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,381
- (DICE THUDS)
- One and six.

235
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,918
- (DICE THUDS)
- Three and four.

236
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,178
- (DICE THUDS)
- One and six.

237
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:32,802
- (DICE THUDS)
- Two and five.

238
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,222
Uh, Judith, what I'd like you
to try to do

239
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,141
is to move the wheel
without actually touching it.

240
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,822
Try to concentrate your mind.
Focus your thoughts.

241
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,657
She outperformed every subject
we'd ever studied.

242
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,703
There was no comparison
to be made.

243
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,714
I understand how peculiar
it might seem

244
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,547
to hear her abilities described
in this way, but they were godlike.

245
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,561
Okay, Judith,
what do you see this time?

246
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,475
- Judith?
- Star.

247
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,147
- And this time.
- Square.

248
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,444
- (LAUGHS)
- And what do you see this time?

249
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,362
<i>Mm.</i>

250
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,326
(JUDITH STUTTERS)

251
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,115
Judith, are you all right?

252
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,875
Are you all right, Judith?
Do you...

253
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,707
can we continue
with the exercise?

254
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,671
- I think she's-
- Judith?

255
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,628
I think she's okay.
All right, let's resume.

256
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,087
Judith, what...

257
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,046
- The card bent.
- What?

258
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,076
- That card bent. We're taking a break.
- What do you mean?

259
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,852
Dr. West?

260
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,273
WHEELER: Looking back, I-

261
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,812
I guess I should've known better.

262
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,490
I mean, yes, we'd seen...

263
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,995
witnessed amazing things
in the past.

264
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,496
But nothing like that.

265
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,749
Nothing, nothing like that.

266
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,961
Inverse square law.

267
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,621
Conservation of momentum.

268
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,632
These were well-established
laws of physics

269
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,043
that were being violated.

270
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,132
The second law
of thermodynamics.

271
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,299
All of these.
We should've been scared.

272
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,342
Someone
with that much power would-

273
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,683
but we were too excited
to be scared.

274
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,473
We finally had the proof...

275
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,517
not another hoax-

276
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,732
that we'd been seeking for years.

277
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,741
We had our Nina Kulagina.

278
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,504
GORMAN: What I remember,
she was due to...

279
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,506
stay overnight in the lab
through the weekend.

280
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,105
We did this quite often
with subjects

281
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,843
because anomalous events

282
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,675
sometimes occur
during the deep-sleep cycle.

283
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,341
And we monitored the subjects
through the night

284
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,930
using various recording devices.

285
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,852
During Judith's first overnight,
we only had one staff member present.

286
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,440
Kenneth.

287
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,073
I don't ever think
I knew his last name.

288
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,360
He was a graduate student
at the time.

289
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,903
Nice, quiet kid.

290
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,572
Came from a fanning family.
I remember that because so do I.

291
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:45,670
He was... he was alone
with Judith that night

292
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,205
sitting not far from her bed.

293
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,295
I don't even think he knew
that he was being recorded

294
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,426
because you can
see him smoking,

295
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,713
which he wasn't supposed
to be doing in the lab.

296
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,720
Nothing happened for hours.

297
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,032
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

298
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,113
Nobody ever found out
what happened.

299
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,996
But whatever did...

300
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,040
that was it for him.

301
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,080
Never came back.

302
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:38,115
W-we tried contacting
Judith's sister, Margaret.

303
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,992
We couldn't reach her.

304
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,070
She'd disconnected her phone.

305
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,787
It became clear at that moment...

306
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,122
that Margaret
had abandoned her.

307
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,505
The decision now
was what we were gonna do.

308
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,917
I could tell that Lawrence was already
reaching a bit of a breaking point.

309
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,506
It was obvious.

310
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,889
It wasn't so obvious
with Dr. West.

311
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,674
Not to me anyway.

312
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,355
WHEELER: Well, we simply
made the decision

313
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,517
that we were going
to continue our testing with her.

314
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:17,359
But after that night,
it became extremely difficult.

315
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,863
It was so unnerving.

316
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,528
Her behavior.

317
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,573
It was so incredibly...

318
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,707
she would say things

319
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,369
and do things that made you...

320
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,547
She would scream in that voice.

321
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,253
- (SCREAMING)
- Grab her!

322
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,423
It wasn't hers.

323
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,634
It was like an animal.

324
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,434
WHEELER: Henry seemed most affected by it.

325
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,938
He tried his best
to shield the others from that.

326
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,394
I knew him well enough to know

327
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,185
that he was deeply affected.

328
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,242
STEVEN: I watched my father change firsthand.

329
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,074
And I have no doubt whatsoever
that what happened in that lab

330
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,989
caused that change.

331
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,955
CATHLEEN: I remember being
in the seventh grade

332
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,790
years later,

333
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,955
and other kids making fun of me.

334
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,296
Call him crazy.

335
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,256
They'd say I'd be crazy.

336
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:26,265
PATRICIA: Back then,
it was different than it is now.

337
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,892
Now everyone has a therapist.

338
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,554
They go for anything-
stubbed toe.

339
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,188
But back then,

340
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:36,442
you went if it was
something bad.

341
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,616
And especially
if medication was involved.

342
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,244
And in my husband's case,
it was.

343
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,451
THERAPIST ON RECORDING: Why do you say that, Henry?

344
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,165
DR. WEST ON RECORDING: You don't understand.

345
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:00,083
- THERAPIST: Okay.
- I see what's happening.

346
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,967
THERAPIST: At work?

347
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,719
(DR. WEST SWALLOWS HARD)

348
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,971
THERAPIST: I can't help you
if you don't tell me

349
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,490
- what you think is happening.
- DR. WEST: I can't tell you.

350
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,182
THERAPIST: What are you so afraid of, Henry?

351
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,978
I know it's very trying,

352
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,489
but we would really like
to continue.

353
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:27,652
- Can you please stop that, Judith?
- Can you please stop that, please?

354
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,164
We'd really like to continue-
(VEINS)

355
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,417
We had about 10 different degrees
between us.

356
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,624
Including one in medicine,

357
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,288
three in psychology.

358
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,584
And we knew...

359
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,720
that was not normal.

360
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,099
WHEELER: Judith was not
a typical test subject.

361
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,057
She had made that
abundantly clear by that point.

362
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:58,690
And I felt we needed help.

363
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,659
ROBERT KOEPP: I received a file
from another analyst.

364
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,857
It was something he thought
I should take a look at.

365
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:15,332
We started a program to
investigate psi in the early '10s.

366
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,038
Psi-related phenomenon.

367
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:20,375
About five years after KGB
conducted similar studies.

368
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,967
I didn't have the highest
expectations going in.

369
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,094
I felt we'd already
been down that road.

370
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,132
And it proved to be
a waste of time and money.

371
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,802
But Marcus was a friend of a friend,
and so I went.

372
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,064
It's difficult to explain.

373
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,693
But you could feel something...

374
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,945
a weight, an invisible weight.

375
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,237
The whole lab
took on that feeling

376
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,747
the minute he stepped
through the door.

377
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,373
Henault: It was if he represented
a challenge to her,

378
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,209
to her power.

379
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,341
Everything we had seen
up until that point,

380
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:08,127
everything Judith had done,
everything we'd witnessed,

381
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:12,924
it barely compared
to what happened after he arrived.

382
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,219
KOEPP: I assumed they'd run
through the usual battery of psi tests.

383
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:20,481
The cards, the elaborate devices
with the numbers, but they didn't.

384
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,643
They told me that those tests
weren't right for her.

385
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,111
DR. WEST: This here's a way
to convince anyone.

386
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:34,154
Easiest and simplest way
to begin the demonstration.

387
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,561
Now you understand
why we've called you in here.

388
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,098
That can't be accounted for

389
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,894
through any known
rational explanation.

390
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,404
And she's able to repeat it
with a variety of different materials.

391
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,440
Breaking the third law
of thermal dynamics.

392
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,493
GERMAN: By the time the man
from the Defense Intelligence Agency,

393
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,377
Robert Koepp, arrived,

394
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,504
we'd given up on
our standard testing procedure.

395
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,291
Well, we'd simply talked to her.

396
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,175
It was so difficult.

397
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,300
She knew...

398
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,187
too much.

399
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,474
Think of any object.

400
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,518
- KOEPP: Something in the room?
- No, it doesn't have to be.

401
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,404
No, let's make it something
not in the room.

402
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,856
- GORMAN: Okay.
- KOEPP: Okay.

404
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,715

were you thinking of?

405
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,550

- Susan! Stop it!

411

- DR. WEST: Marcus!

412
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,571
- Susan, calm down.
- SUSAN: How dare you?!

413
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,235
- You don't know anything!
- Take her outside, please.

414
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,404
Just take her outside.

415
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,823
GERMAN: She had drawn a shamrock.

416
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,290
Back in 1973,
three years earlier,

417
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,046
I had travelled back to London
for my mum's funeral.

418
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,926
I was devastated.

419
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:59,010
Her family had immigrated
to London from Ireland

420
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,925
and she was very proud
of her Irish heritage.

421
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,103
And in her casket,

422
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,764
she had worn the same brooch
that she'd worn

423
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,978
almost every day of her life.

424
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,150
It was a shamrock.

425
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,111
As soon as I saw that picture,

426
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:18,822
I realized what Judith
had whispered to me.

427
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,284
"You weren't there."

428
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,126
Which is true, I wasn't.

429
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:30,629
My mother died
the day before I made it home.

430
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,296
And that woman...

431
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,053
that thing somehow knew that.

432
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,340
And how much guilt.

433
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,139
She wanted me
to behave that way.

434
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,600
She wanted me to react that way.

435
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,815
To humiliate me
in front of my peers

436
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,274
by turning me into everything
I had tried so hard not to be.

437
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:05,118
Well, the incident with Susan
was very unsettling

438
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,500
because it demonstrated
Judith's ability to influence us.

439
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,332
She was definitely
influencing Henry.

440
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,795
He started to pull back.
Which was unlike him.

441
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,256
I thought he was gonna fight
the government's involvement,

442
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,886
but that didn't happen.

443
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,390
He withdrew and they took over.

we reviewed the footage
of the seizure incident.

497

Dr. West had no history of epilepsy
or any related condition,

498
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,977
so it's highly unlikely

that the flashing lights
could've triggered it.

that Ms. Winstead
caused the seizure,

couldn't rule it out either.

And that paper clip just
happened to be what he found?

Out of all the things in the world-

a balled-up receipt,
a stick of bubble gum...

647
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:04,109
that's what happened to fall
out of my pocket at that moment?

648
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,770
Not at any point
in the five days before that?

649

Not... not anywhere else?

it was... it was... it was like...

What happened was no accident.

That was it.
I'd had enough.

656
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,894
It was 10 years until I heard
from Lawrence again.

657
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:43,056
He and his wife moved out of the country
shortly after it happened.

658
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:49,312
I was surprised he didn't leave
the institute sooner than he did.

659
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,690
It was a shame
what happened to his nephew.

660
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,412
I don't think Lawrence
ever really forgave himself.

661

Well, we couldn't discount the events
that happened outside the institute.

Too much happened
for it to be coincidence.

was that it had an intelligence.

it was able to conduct

that we will never understand.

into a sideshow.

966

At the same time,

01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:48,589
we had to gain control somehow.

That last night in the lab was...

978
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,661
it was crazy.

979
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:04,252
They told us to double up
on our ammo just to stay safe.

980
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,087
There was a big buildup.

981
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:09,093
Everyone was mentally preparing
for what might happen.

982
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,385
We needed to get it
out of the lab

983
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:15,266
and we couldn't do that
with a civilian.

984
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:18,178
We had to transfer it
into one of our own.

what was going to happen...

987
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,323
I froze.

988
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:35,905
I wanted to scream
for them not to try that.

989
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:39,950
But I didn't say a word.

990
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,494
I wanted to get out of there
real bad.

991
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,413
I remember, I wanted
to sneak out the back door

992
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:48,550
when nobody was looking
and just go.

993
