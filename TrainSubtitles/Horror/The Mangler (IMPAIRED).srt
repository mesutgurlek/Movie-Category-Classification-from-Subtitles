blocking of a public street.

172
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,410
Come on, pal.
Give me a break.

173
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,912
What do you want? Insulting an
officer?

174
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:23,815
Or being an arrogant,
ignorant son of a bitch?

175
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,618
Since when is that a crime?

176
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,686
Help me, boss!

177
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,320
Aw, you broke my damn watch.

178
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,355
I'm all pooped out.

179
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,990
[Police radio] Officer
Hunton, come in.

180
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,059
Damn it.
You're a moron.

181
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:37,162
Officer Hunton, come in.

182
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,199
Officer Hunton.

183
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,668
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,103
Yeah, Molly, what have you got?

185
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,372
Good morning, Johnny.
How's your day so far?

186
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,874
Oh, my day's peachy,
Molly. What's up?

187
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,410
We've got a death
at the blue ribbon laundry.

188
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,846
It's a bad one.

189
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,882
Sheriff Hughes got called
away to an urgent meeting.

190
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,985
[Delivery man]
I need some help.

191
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:04,989
What's going on, and how
many did you take this time?

192
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,126
Right side up.
Come on.

193
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:11,029
Alright, Molly, I'm on the way.
Thanks a lot.

194
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,787
[Crying]

195
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,793
Oh, my god!

196
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,662
Oh, my god!

197
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,332
No!

198
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,300
No!

199
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:53,905
Sherry, it's O.K.

200
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,073
Get away from me!

201
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,307
Her worries are over.

202
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,310
Get away from me!

203
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,934
Holy shit.

204
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,014
Hello.

205
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,016
Is Mr. Gartley here?

206
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,919
Mr. Gartley
is unavailable.

207
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:44,889
I'm Stanner.
I'm the foreman.

208
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,291
Mr. Stanner,

209
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:49,127
I'm, uh...
I'm officer Hunton.

210
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,597
Can you show me what happened, Mr.
Stanner?

211
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,867
Do I have to?

212
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,102
Yeah, you have to.

213
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:01,606
She's down there. I... I
can't look at it again.

214
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,508
It makes me sick.

215
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,811
She's down there. I can't. I'm sorry.
I can't look at it.

216
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,948
Yeah, right, you can't look.

217
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,057
Run a loose shop, cut
corners... what do you expect?

218
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:22,393
People get hurt
or killed, right?

219
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,895
And then he can't look.

220
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,564
No, he can't look at it.

221
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,900
Oh.

222
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,034
[Gulp]

223
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,770
Hell of a mess, huh, Johnny?

224
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,506
You know, me and my old camera

225
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,910
were doing this long before
you even came to this town.

226
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:41,145
Never did get used to it.

227
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,950
[Hunton]
Yeah, right.

228
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,720
Oh.

229
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,855
[Gulp]

230
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:54,125
Um... pictureman...

231
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,761
Make sure I get
some copies of that.

232
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,631
Like always.

233
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:02,634
Have I ever let you down?

234
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:04,903
Yes.

235
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,844
Oh!

236
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,245
Oh.

237
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,022
Shit.

238
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,625
I feel like it's all my fault.

239
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:30,929
I just wasn't strong enough.
I tried to help her.

240
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,297
O.K., it's alright.

241
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:36,834
It's alright. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

242
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,336
It's O.K.

243
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:46,177
Ex... excuse me.

244
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,279
I know how you feel.

245
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,349
Have you seen that machine?

246
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,551
It makes me sick to my stomach.

247
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,091
These will help.

248
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:03,494
Mrs. Frawley
used to take 'em.

249
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,372
Oh, keep the bottle.

250
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,673
Thank you.

251
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,945
Annette Gillian.

252
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,548
Uh, John Hunton.
How do you do?

253
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,250
Hi.

254
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:29,287
Oh, poor Mrs. Frawley.

255
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,456
Oh, god!

256
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,758
[Crying]

257
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,227
[Car approaching]

258
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,809
Hey, what's going on?

259
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,946
Nothing, Johnny. We're here
to settle a safety issue.

260
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,547
What's the emergency, anyway?

261
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,783
There's been an accident
with a speed ironer.

262
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,618
Let's go in.

263
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,350
[Engine starts]

264
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,953
[Man] If the safety
features on this machine

265
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,822
meet state and local standards,

266
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,557
then you may resume operation.

267
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,759
[Hughes] Yes, thank
you, judge bishop.

268
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,795
O.K., Martin,
start her up.

269
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,763
Stand clear, boys.

270
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,771
Let's start with the safety bar.

271
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,206
When I lift this up,

272
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,743
the machine
should stop. Uh!

273
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,513
Put it down, it should start.

274
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,016
What is your conclusion,
Mr. Martin?

275
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,584
Well, I'll tell you,
judge bishop,

276
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,886
the safety bar seems to
be working fine.

277
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:12,223
Then I declare that this was
a case of accidental death.

278
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,891
This inquest is closed.

279
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,327
[Man] I know what you
think of my work.

280
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,062
Look, there's no such thing

281
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,665
as empirical truth in
theoretical parapsychology.

282
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,734
If you saw Seraphims and Cherubims
falling out of the sky,

283
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:24,902
singing <i>hallelujah,</i>

284
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,270
you wouldn't believe it.

285
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,473
You want proof, right?

286
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,109
Oh, you'll never change.

287
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,018
You haven't eaten much.

288
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,422
Why? You're not
feeling well?

289
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,023
There was an accident today...

290
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,059
The worst one I've ever seen.

291
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:49,327
Messy?

292
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,797
[Groan]

293
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,605
So how long is it now

294
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,807
you've been chasing corpses?

295
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,742
14 years.

296
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:08,045
Oh, man, 14 years.

297
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:11,582
You know, you need to spend
some more time with the living.

298
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,317
Ha ha ha!

299
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,287
Jesus, you sound
just like Sandy.

300
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,925
Sandra really loved you.

301
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,193
Whatever.

302
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:26,230
Uh, I just... I just
got to hang in there

303
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:29,066
and get my 20 years in
so I can retire

304
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,102
and get the fuck
out of this town

305
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:33,271
before I turn completely numb.

306
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:36,541
Yeah, well, uh,
you know, Johnny,

307
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:39,343
you really do
need to get a life.

308
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,950
I got a life.

309
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,387
What I need is a beer.

310
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,889
Come over if you want.

311
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,825
I don't suppose you know anything
about industrial laundries?

312
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,461
You know, I used to work
in an industrial laundry

313
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,830
when I was an undergraduate
at Berkeley.

314
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:00,865
Get out of here.

315
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:01,899
I did, man.

316
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:02,934
Really?

317
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,068
Yeah, sure.

318
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,405
Well, look,
do you know that machine

319
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,873
they call the speed ironer?

320
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,309
Oh, man, yeah. It's
called a mangle.

321
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,610
A mangler?

322
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:13,744
Mangle.

323
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:17,848
That's the one.
That's the one.

324
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,551
It mangled a woman
this morning...

325
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,652
Oh!

326
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,589
Over at Mr. Gartley's
blue ribbon laundry.

327
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,227
It...

328
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,229
There was hardly
anything left of her.

329
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,799
No way. No way, man. That can't happen.
You've got a safety bar.

330
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:38,603
If someone's feeding the machine
and get their hand underneath,

331
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,806
the bar snaps up and turns
the damn thing off.

332
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,441
Well, that's how I remember it.

333
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,109
Yeah, it's got a safety bar,

334
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,311
but it happened anyhow.

335
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:51,616
Oh, god. Man,
what a way to go.

336
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,020
I hated that machine.

337
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,104
Oh, fuck me!
I can't do this!

338

Well, it is what it is, right?

Johnny, don't.
I mean, you can't...

340

What? A woman's dead, mark.

341
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,382
It folded her like a sheet.

342
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,520
They carried her out
in a basket.

343
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,657
Whose ass is on the line?

344

Nobody's ass is on the line.

Gartley owns judge bishop.

346

fighting it, man?

I mean, wake up.

350

I've been in this
town long enough

to know that there's some
strange shit going on.

352
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,308
It's always been
narrow-minded and corrupt.

353
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,078
Hell, they used to burn witches
just 10 miles from here.

354
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,214
This puritanical ethic
is still hanging over...

is running right now,

about it, huh?

That's what I'll do.

of the world on your shoulders?

00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,985
Nothing.

501
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:57,321
Right. That would
be a first.

502
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,424
Barry!

503
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,226
Barry!

504
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,267
Was that
Mrs. Ellenshaw?

505
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,435
Yeah.

506
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,707
Take it easy, man.

507
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,909
Right. You, too.

508
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,252
Hey, man...

509
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:30,254
Why don't you come on over?

510
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,789
There's something important
I want to show you.

511
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,291
Six-pack of beer?

512
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:36,493
No. Come on.
Are you hungry?

513
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:37,961
No. I'm going
to bed.

514
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:41,832
Come on. It's really
important. Come on.

515
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:43,300
Ah, what the fuck.

516
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:45,569
Cold beer? Is that
all I'm good for?

517
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:49,072
You know how to hurt a guy. That's
no way to treat your brother-in-law.

518
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:52,743
I suppose you'd follow me to the
ends of the earth if I asked.

519
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:56,580
That's right. I'd follow you
to the ends of the earth.

520
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,782
[Door closes]

521
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:01,018
Come.

Frazer's <i>golden bough...</i>

523
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,322
Check it out. You might
learn something.

524
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:07,224
"Frazer's <i>golden bough...</i>

Check it out.
Check it out.

528
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,566
Have you considered
the possibility

529
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:20,737
that the machine
might be haunted?

530
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:24,207
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yes, mark. Yes.

531
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:26,643
That's the first thing
that popped into my mind.

532
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,445
No. Play along
with me.

533
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,647
Maybe "haunted"
is not a good word.

534
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:34,484
Let's say
"possessed."

535
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:35,752
Possessed.

536
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:38,622
Yeah. Yeah, man.
Possessed.

537
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:39,890
Possessed?

538
00:32:39,892 --> 00:32:42,259
Yeah! Possessed.

539
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:44,461
By the parrot demon, right?

540
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:45,729
O.K., O.K.

541
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:49,066
We're going to grab that
bad boy by the throat,

542
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:52,736
shove a couple cloves of garlic up
his butt, that'll be the end, right?

Man, this stuff's for real.
I'm serious about this.

544
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:57,174
Check it out. This
stuff is for real.

Alright?

550
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:14,891
The rest is bullshit.

It's O.K. Shh.

It's alright.

But, Mr. Gartley,
she's hurt, sir.

Mr. Gartley, she needs a doctor.
She needs help.

Bring her to me.

568

[Mark]
All spells can be reduced

569
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:55,992
to simple common denominators.

570
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:58,628
European spells mention
the hand of glory,

571
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,531
and that's real trouble.
Spells need a catalyst...

572
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,934
Either herbal or human or both.

573
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,569
The answer is in that book.

574
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,370
Just go for it!

575
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:11,274
Carry on. Come on. Come on.
Read on, man.

576
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:15,278
Belladonna, hand of glory...

577
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,980
Blood of a virgin!

578
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:18,782
Now, that's supernatural.

579
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:22,519
Supernatural is a really
misleading word, man.

580
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:25,655
Witches, demons, spirits...

581
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:27,190
All part of nature.

582
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,825
Like, um... O.K.

583
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:33,063
A demon is a kind of
energy like electricity...

584
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,865
Or fire.

585
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:39,402
Sometimes it gets out of
control, and people get hurt.

586
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:42,205
Thought you might
want something to eat.

587
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:43,740
Thank you.

588
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:47,210
The most powerful spells
always incorporate belladonna.

589
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,411
What is belladonna?

590
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,447
The hand of glory,
or deadly nightshade.

591
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:51,615
The plant?

592
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:53,049
Yeah.

593
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:55,051
And the most common ingredient

594
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:57,053
in all these spells

595
00:35:57,055 --> 00:36:00,157
is, uh, the blood of a virgin.

596
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,831
You must admit the way
Annette describes Sherry,

597
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,833
she sounds the type.

Oh, come on. Come on.
Go with the flow.

00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:18,608
Think of the possibilities.
Could be fun, huh?

00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,878
Alright. Hey, mark,
tell you what.

602
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,680

Mark, I could
just see my report.

616
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,344
They would tar and feather me

and run me out of

Ha ha ha!

00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,886
That sounds like a whole
lot of fun to me.

Oh, yeah!
Oh, boy!

622

Why don't we just go
there and talk to her?

Do it for me.

00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:28,311
Yeah. Who's picking up
the tab for my overtime?

No. I'm

He's a student...
An observer.

649
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,590
Then I guess it's alright.

00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:31,267
O.K.

663
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:33,203
[Johnny]
It's O.K.?

664
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,871
Alright.

665
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:39,175
Now, Annette said that you
cut your hand on a clamp.

666
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,578
How did that happen?

667
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,081
Getting out of the
way of that icebox.

668
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:49,486
These two guys lost control.
I guess it...

669
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,254
It hit the feed belt.

670
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,622
On the mangler?

671
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:57,327
Yeah. Then it bounce off
and almost hit me.

672
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:59,963
Did this icebox
hit the safety bar?

673
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:01,765
I think it did.

674
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:04,134
There were bright
sparks everywhere.

675
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:06,669
What? Sparks like
a wire had been cut?

676
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:10,807
I saw a big flash like
lightning or something.

677
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,042
That's it, then.
There it is.

Shh.

681
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,190
She was like a mother to me.

682
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:29,192
I tried to help her.

683
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:31,194
I pulled as hard as I could,

684
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:32,662
but I was too weak.

685

It's O.K.

very brave young woman.

690
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:46,142
The icebox hit the safety bar.

691
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,944
That's it.
Thank you very much.

692
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,946
Bye-bye. It was
a short circuit.

693
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,148
That's all there is to it.

694

Let's go.

Excuse me?
What is this?

I'm right!
I'm right.

She's definitely a virgin.

Jesus Christ! I can't
believe you did that...

God! Have fun? Shit,
I hope you had fun.

705
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,308
It's not a question of fun.
I know I'm right.

Shut up, goddamn it.

What are you... some
kind of pervert?

Hi, Johnny. It's really bad.
The boy's suffocated.

It's Barry Ellenshaw.

Mrs. Smith just learned
10 minutes ago.

I found that icebox when
I got here this morning.

He never got in any trouble.

Alright.

The boy's dog was barking
outside the icebox.

00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,458
I don't know what
we're dealing with.

828
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,761
It could be in the
cycle of bubastis,

829
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:55,164
pan, Dionysius.

830
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:57,566
You following me?

831
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,469
No... but go on.

832
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:06,175
I have to isolate
the exact cause.

833
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:09,011
We have to make sure
that we use the right ritual

834
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:10,846
because the rites of exorcism...

835
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:14,183
I don't know if you understand
but that's really heavy stuff.

836
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:17,520
That's like controlled
nuclear fission.

837
00:49:17,522 --> 00:49:19,855
We make one mistake,
that's it. We're dead.

838
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:22,325
We're destroyed.

839
00:49:22,327 --> 00:49:27,763
If you ask me, this is just an
act of random possession.

840
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:32,134
It's got to be.

841
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:36,272
Hey, mark.

842
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:39,709
I got to do some thinking.

843
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,546
Oh, Johnny,

844
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:45,848
listen, man,
don't worry, O.K.?

845
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:49,185
I'm with you 100%,
man, O.K.?

846
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:51,420
Alright, mark.
That's a relief, man.

847
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:52,888
100%.

848
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:56,325
That's real reassuring.

849
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:07,036
[Engine starts]

850
00:50:07,038 --> 00:50:12,608
Belladonna,
demonic possessions...

851
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,510
Oh, I'm having fun.

852
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:15,678
I'm with you, man.

853
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,347
There are stranger things
in heaven and earth,

854
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:22,084
John Hunton, than are dreamt of
in your philosophy.

855
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:23,352
Ha ha ha!

856
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,850
Hey, Johnny, what do you know?

857
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,752
Not much, Tyrone.

858
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:59,288
Just going to the morgue.

859
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,726
Whew. Not much.

860
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:33,956
[Man] Barry, it's
been a hell of a day.

861
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:36,225
Fix you up in the morning.

862
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:47,870
He's a brave kid, he put up a hell of
a fight, broke his arm in six places.

863
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,773
It was suffocation, right?

864
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,808
Mr. Hunton,

865
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,977
we've been expecting you.

866
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:57,513
You've come to see
Mrs. Frawley.

867
00:51:57,515 --> 00:52:00,015
She was a real challenge.

868
00:52:00,017 --> 00:52:02,518
I had practically
nothing to go on.

869
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,020
Hardly recognized the
parts... the ones that came in.

870
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:06,889
You look at her now.

871
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:13,729
I think I did a pretty good job, considering
the raw materials I had to work with.

872
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:17,199
Can you keep a secret? I had
to fill up her body with...

873
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:18,400
I hate secrets.

874
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:19,201
O.K.

875
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:20,202
O.K., yeah.

876
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:21,670
You need to be alone.

877
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:23,706
You've come to do some thinking.

878
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,040
I'll be in my office.

879
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:26,909
Okay, I'll call you
if I need anything.

880
00:52:26,911 --> 00:52:29,145
She's headed to the
cemetery in the morning.

881
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:30,913
Until then, she's all yours.

882
00:52:30,915 --> 00:52:32,114
Great, thank you.

883
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:34,116
Oh, her personal possessions.

884
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:35,684
They're right here.

885
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:36,685
Great.

886
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:38,320
That's all they brought in.

887
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:39,321
Cherry tomato?

888
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:43,225
No, thank you.
Bye-bye, now.

889
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:51,300
Oh, Jesus.

890
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:30,439
You won't mind, will you?

891
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:51,894
Jesus, I got to get a life.

892
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,596
Boo.

893
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:55,731
Got you.

894
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,266
Very funny.

895
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:03,806
She looks... pretty good,

896
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:04,640
don't she?

897
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:07,509
Oh, yeah.
She looks great.

898
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,182
Johnny. Johnny!

899
00:54:13,184 --> 00:54:16,418
You want to come downstairs?
We'll finish off that gin game

900
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,587
we started three years ago.

901
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,990
I've still got a drop
of that Irish whiskey.

902
00:54:20,992 --> 00:54:24,960
You know, I get the feeling
you don't like me anymore.

903
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:26,895
No.

904
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:31,600
It's my job I don't
like anymore.

905
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,402
Oh.

906
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:36,972
Well, it doesn't
matter much anyway.

907
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:42,911
You won't have to look at my ugly
mug around here much longer.

908
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,680
Why?

909
00:54:44,682 --> 00:54:47,449
Don't tell me you're moving
out of this hellhole.

910
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:50,219
Oh, something like that.

911
00:54:50,221 --> 00:54:53,656
The doc says I'm going fast.

912
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:58,961
I'm being
eaten up... inside.

913
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,977
I'm sorry to hear that.

914
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:17,246
Ah, don't be.

915
00:55:17,248 --> 00:55:19,682
We all have to go sometime.

916
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,620
Johnny, you and I...

917
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:27,823
We share the same ghosts.

918
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,762
To forgive is divine...

919
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:39,868
Especially if you can
forgive yourself.

920
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,842
Oh, did you get pictures
of that icebox?

921
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,243
Oh, yeah.

922
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:52,114
Yeah, I'm off down
to the darkroom now.

923
00:55:52,116 --> 00:55:53,248
What was that?

924
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,750
What?

925
00:55:54,752 --> 00:55:56,452
That ghost.

926
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:00,222
We live in strange
times, Johnny...

927
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:02,791
Very strange times.

928
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:06,228
I'll have the photos
ready later tonight.

929
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,563
Come on by.

930
00:56:07,565 --> 00:56:10,265
I'll be waiting for you.

931
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:13,135
You know, I'm 50 points
up on you in that game.

932
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:16,939
I've got an Ace up my
sleeve I'm dying to play.

933
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:21,777
You know where to find me. You're
going to lose to an old hack like me.

934
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,049
Shit.

935
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,790
Fuck.

936
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:52,828
Aah!

937
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,630
What are you doing?

938
00:58:54,632 --> 00:58:56,064
Where the hell is Gartley?

939
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:57,199
He's out of town.

940
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,433
Yeah, right.

941
00:58:58,435 --> 00:59:01,236
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come back here!

942
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:06,642
Hey, stop! Goddamn it,
he's out of town.

943
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:13,248
Get your hands off of me,
you lying sack of shit.

944
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,918
You want to go downtown?
You want to go downtown?

945
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,153
[Gartley]
Boys! Boys!

946
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:20,956
All right. Knock it off.

947
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:25,961
Get out, George.
I'll deal with you later.

948
00:59:25,963 --> 00:59:31,233
Come in, Mr. Hunton.
I've been expecting you.

949
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,302
So sorry I missed you earlier.

950
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:35,037
[Door slams]

951
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,106
You know, Stanner tells me
you're quite the detective.

952
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:41,877
A regular Sherlock Holmes
of the dead, hmm?

953
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:44,980
Why don't you
shut that thing down

954
00:59:44,982 --> 00:59:47,316
before somebody else gets hurt?

955
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:51,787
What, am I going to
have to shut you down?

956
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:54,623
Tsk tsk tsk. I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

957
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:58,193
Mmm. Bad career move.

958
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,665
Are you threatening me?

959
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:06,034
Is that a threat?

960
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:09,805
Go on, threaten me. I'll shove
them crutches up your moldy ass.

961
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:16,178
Ha ha ha!

962
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,447
I like that. Threaten?

963
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:19,848
Uh-huh.

964
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:24,886
No, no, no. Threaten
is far too... kind a word.

965
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:27,089
This goddamn machine
tried to kill me!

966
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:34,963
Breaking and entering
is a serious crime, <i>officer.</i>

967
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,965
Perhaps I should have
<i>you</i> arrested, hmm?

968
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:40,102
Yeah. O.K. O.K. Hey. Yeah.
Have me arrested.

969
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:43,805
I'm going to shut you down,
you sick son of a bitch.

970
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:51,913
I will not have you
tamper with my affairs.

971
01:00:51,915 --> 01:00:53,515
I'll have you suspended!

972
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:56,618
Hey, all your powerful
friends and all your money

973
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,521
don't mean shit to me, Gartley.

974
01:00:59,523 --> 01:01:00,822
Ha ha ha!

975
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:04,359
My power has nothing
to do with money.

976
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:07,763
Power is energy.
Power is motivation.

977
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:11,033
Power is what
holds things together

978
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:13,969
when they would
rather fly apart.

979
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:17,572
It's a complex world
out there, sporty.

980
01:01:17,574 --> 01:01:20,542
Many things you
do not understand.

981
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:25,414
But... understand this.

982
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:28,617
There's a little bit
of me in that machine

983
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:32,087
and a little bit of it in me.

984
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:35,724
We are the lifeblood
of this town.

985
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:42,731
Gartley, what are you
talking about?

986
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:46,368
We all have to make sacrifices.

987
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,508
You're right.

988
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:57,479
Everything has its price.

989
01:01:57,481 --> 01:01:59,114
Yeah. Yes, it does.

990
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:04,786
Well, do come again. This
has been delightful.

991
01:02:04,788 --> 01:02:08,490
And, uh... drive
carefully, won't you?

992
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,764
Fuck you!

993
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:21,069
What?

994
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:07,282
That s.O.B.

995
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:10,385
He thinks he's going to
shut down our machine.

996
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:11,720
Ha ha ha!

997
01:03:11,722 --> 01:03:13,722
Well, sir, I've been thinking...

998
01:03:13,724 --> 01:03:16,792
Maybe it should be shut down.

999
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:24,399
Yeah... how long you
worked here, George?

1000
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:26,168
15 years.

1001
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:30,572
15 years. Well, you're...
You're practically

1002
01:03:30,574 --> 01:03:33,642
part of our little family,
then, aren't you, hmm?

1003
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:37,879
I assume you'll be helping
us run this town, hmm?

1004
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:44,586
I've known that machine
since I was a little boy.

1005
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:46,922
My daddy bought it.

1006
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:50,292
Best business decision
he ever made, I'll tell you.

1007
01:03:50,294 --> 01:03:53,261
My god,
Mr. Gartley, sir.

1008
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:58,266
That... that machine
killed your daughter.

1009
01:03:58,268 --> 01:04:00,569
Look what it's done to you.

1010
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:06,508
Yeah. Sacrifices, George.

1011
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,310
We all have to make them.

1012
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:12,681
Hell, boy. You could say that machine
out there made me what I am.

1013
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:15,550
Mr. Gartley, if you're not
going to deal with it,

1014
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:19,855
then... maybe
I should.

1015
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:24,159
Oh, don't be a fool, George.

1016
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:28,697
Don't throw away
a bright future here.

1017
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:33,034
I'm worried.
Worried, uh...

1018
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:35,470
It's been troubling me.

1019
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:41,042
Well, George, let your own
conscience be your guide.

1020
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:44,880
[Bang]

1021
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,906
[Dialing]

1022
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,315
Good evening, Martha.

1023
01:05:20,317 --> 01:05:24,586
Bill. Bill Gartley.
Sorry to call so late.

1024
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:28,390
Let me speak to the good
sheriff, won't you, Martha?

1025
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:29,891
Thank you.

1026
01:05:29,893 --> 01:05:32,527
Evening, Hughes.
Now listen,

1027
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:35,964
I'm having a little problem
with one of the boys.

1028
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:39,334
Yeah. That's the fellow.
That's right.

1029
01:05:39,336 --> 01:05:45,440
Now you deal with him.
O.K, nighty-night.

1030
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:48,276
Fuck him.

1031
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,345
[Hughes]
John?

1032
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,348
What?

1033
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:56,484
Take some time off.
There's no case here, son.

1034
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:57,819
Take a vacation!

1035
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:00,388
O.K., Mr. Gartley.

1036
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:03,591
Now you're suspended,
officer Hunton.

1037
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:05,994
Hey, how much is he
paying you, Hughes?

1038
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:07,996
O.K., pal.
You're terminated!

1039
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:10,131
And kiss that
pension good-bye.

1040
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:39,627
How are we feeling,
my dear, hmm?

1041
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:43,498
Strange.
I'm getting sick.

1042
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:50,538
Are you ready for bed?

1043
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,610
Yes.

1044
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:58,213
No! No.

1045
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:03,852
There's something
I must show you.

1046
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:05,086
Come.

1047
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,928
Must be here somewhere.

1048
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,430
Aha!

1049
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:16,731
Yeah.

1050
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:26,875
My baby daughter's
death certificate.

1051
01:07:26,877 --> 01:07:29,144
Her passport to hell.

1052
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:30,912
She was only 16.

1053
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:35,283
Hmm. Well, survival of the
fittest is the way of things.

1054
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:39,754
I mean, surely, my child,

1055
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:42,090
you must have noticed
how Rikers valley

1056
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:44,959
is so ideally perfect, hmm?

1057
01:07:44,961 --> 01:07:48,229
There's something I want to show you.
Just a moment here.

1058
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,435
Ah! Ah.

1059
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:04,446
This... is my contract...

1060
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:09,084
My deal...
With the beast...

1061
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:11,286
The beast in the machine.

1062
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:18,726
What's happening to me?

1063
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:21,296
My child,

1064
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:25,300
there's a little piece
of you in the mangler

1065
01:08:25,302 --> 01:08:29,471
and the essence of it in you.

1066
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:31,673
You're one of us now.

1067
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:39,047
My signature.
See? Hmm?

1068
01:08:39,049 --> 01:08:41,950
Oh. Understand now?

1069
01:08:41,952 --> 01:08:43,451
Do we?

1070
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,187
Hmm?

1071
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,190
See?

1072
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:58,266
Welcome to the club.

1073
01:08:58,268 --> 01:09:00,768
Oh, precious.

1074
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:28,396
Fuck!

1075
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:30,798
I've been studying, man.
Virgin's blood.

1076
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,968
Definitely virgin's
blood. It's got to be.

1077
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:35,637
Now, look.

1078
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:39,741
A little holy water,
a smidgen of Eucharist...

1079
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:41,376
That ought to do it.

1080
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:44,512
We'll read some <i>leviticus.</i>
<i>Christian white magic.</i>

1081
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,080
Listen, I'll tell you the truth.

1082
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:49,450
I was really worried about that
hand of glory... belladonna.

1083
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:51,819
That's black Ju Ju.
Strong magic.

1084
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:53,421
Hey, mark?

1085
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:56,658
I looked down this son
of a bitch's throat.

1086
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,993
Holy water ain't going to do it.

1087
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:00,795
Yeah, well, a demon conjured up

1088
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:03,531
in conjunction with
the hand of glory can...

1089
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:07,602
I mean, that could eat a stack
of bibles for breakfast,

1090
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:10,572
but we don't have to
worry about that.

1091
01:10:10,574 --> 01:10:12,640
Thank god.

1092
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:13,541
Alright.

1093
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,643
You know, I hope you're right.

1094
01:10:15,645 --> 01:10:17,845
I know I'm right.

1095
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:19,247
I don't.

1096
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,951
We got to go talk to somebody.

1097
01:10:22,953 --> 01:10:23,985
Come on.

1098
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:25,887
Hold up!

1099
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:27,422
Damn it, hold up!

1100
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,649
I don't know about this, George.

1101
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:57,218
What the hell took you so long?

1102
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,454
I'm sorry.

1103
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:01,756
Are you sure we're doing
the right thing?

1104
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,791
Yeah. Now, don't start
arguing with me now.

1105
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:06,628
Go over there, cut all power,
and pull the breakers.

1106
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:08,830
I'll start on the feeder.

1107
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:26,281
[Sherry crying]

1108
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,485
Sherry?
What are you doing here?

1109
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:32,487
I have to see my uncle.

1110
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:34,589
That's not a good idea.
He's very upset.

1111
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:36,891
I can't work here anymore.

1112
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:40,361
The police came and asked me questions.
I got to speak to him.

1113
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:44,232
Police. That figures.

1114
01:11:44,234 --> 01:11:47,135
Just don't go up there.
He's busy.

1115
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:50,305
Lin sue's with him, isn't she?

1116
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:54,309
Sherry, go on home now.

1117
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:56,511
I have to talk to him.

1118
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:01,949
Oh, oh, oh. I'm caught!

1119
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:03,051
Mr. Stanner!

1120
01:12:03,053 --> 01:12:06,621
I'm caught!
Help! Aah!

1121
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:08,523
[Sherry]
Mr. Stanner!

1122
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,659
The fuses! Jesus!

1123
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:12,694
Aah!

1124
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:18,666
Mr. Stanner!
Mr. Stanner!

1125
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:19,600
Aah!

1126
01:12:19,602 --> 01:12:22,904
Aah! Turn it off!
Oh, god!

1127
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:29,811
Aah!

1128
01:12:29,813 --> 01:12:31,412
Mr. Gartley!

1129
01:12:31,414 --> 01:12:35,983
Aah! Oh, help me!
Help me! Oh, please!

1130
01:12:35,985 --> 01:12:37,018
Please!

1131
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,319
Do something!

1132
01:12:38,321 --> 01:12:40,421
Do something?
Do something?

1133
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:41,856
I'll do something.

1134
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,858
I'll dance, that's what I'll do.

1135
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,427
I'll do a little
dance for you, Sherry.

1136
01:12:46,429 --> 01:12:48,830
Oh, god. Mr. Gartley!

1137
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:50,431
A little jig.

1138
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:55,536
I need your help now.

1139
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:58,606
We're running out
of time. Come on.

1140
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:00,575
[Sherry screaming]

1141
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:05,713
Please! Please! Aah!

1142
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,749
Uncle bill, please!

1143
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:11,219
Move like there's no tomorrow.
We're on the clock.

1144
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,187
Aah!

1145
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:15,790
Do it! Do it!

1146
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:16,724
I can't!

1147
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:21,262
Do it! Do it!

in each of them.

1480
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:18,244
"Faithfully yours,

1481
01:40:18,246 --> 01:40:22,515
J.J.J. Pictureman."

1482
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:56,115
[Woman] Herb! I've got a big load
of sheets coming within the hour!

1483
01:40:56,117 --> 01:40:57,350
Now, get a move on!

1484
01:40:57,352 --> 01:41:01,054
Come on, ladies!
Move it up!

1485
01:41:02,289 --> 01:41:04,390
There's never enough
time around here!

1486
01:41:04,392 --> 01:41:06,793
I'm not running a
charity here, herb!

1487
01:41:06,795 --> 01:41:09,495
Tell them to get their
lazy asses in gear!

1488
01:41:09,497 --> 01:41:10,496
[John]
Sherry?

1489
01:41:10,498 --> 01:41:13,566
You heard the boss!
Keep moving!

1490
01:41:55,075 --> 01:41:57,276
[Engine starts]
