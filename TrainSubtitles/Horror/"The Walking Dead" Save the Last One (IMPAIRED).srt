- Shot

3
00:00:06,749 --> 00:00:09,424
I have to open him up,
find the bleeder and stitch it.

00:00:09,946 --> 00:00:10,943
You need a respirator.

5
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,933
The thought of her,
out here by herself...

6
00:00:15,538 --> 00:00:16,430
We're gonna locate
that little girl.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,130
She's gonna be
just fine.

41

Shane gets up and when
he runs into Kingsley
in the hallway

42
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:33,492
he looks out the window
and says,

43
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:36,446
"Principal Kingsley,

44
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,525

00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:49,173
Of course you do.

You've heard this story
1000 times.

50
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:58,032
What you said before,
you're right.

51
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:02,745
Shane's gonna make it back
with what the doctor needs.

52
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:03,972
He'll make it back.

I'm coming too.

62
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:00,346
I'm going for a walk.
Shine some light in the forest.

63
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:02,394
If she's out there,
give her something to look at.

Those windows,
what's on the other side?

67
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:24,362
About a 20-foot drop
with nothing to catch you,
maybe some bushes,

68
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,859
- then the athletic field.
- We just need enough time.

69
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:29,061
We got to get up there.
We got to get 'em open
and get out.

70
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,373
- Not me. Maybe you.
- Hey hey hey.

71
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:34,030
Come on, man, look at me.
You really think I can
squeeze through

72
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:36,976
one of them tiny windows?
They'd be all over us.

73
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:40,075
Look, we lay down some fire
to get a head start.

74
00:06:40,104 --> 00:06:42,480
You stay here.
I hop down and draw them away.

75
00:06:42,508 --> 00:06:45,192
That gives you the chance
to get up the bleachers
and out a window.

76
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:47,629
And where do you go?

77
00:06:47,677 --> 00:06:49,403
<i>Locker room
down those steps.</i>

78
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:52,221
Looks like a good way
to get trapped.

79
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:54,553
It's got windows too,
and more my size.

80
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:58,174
I get out through one,
I double back, we meet up
out on the field.

81
00:06:58,192 --> 00:06:59,865
You're a crazy son

for that boy.

83
00:07:02,062 --> 00:07:05,204
You take three shots
and you go.

84
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:07,774
After that I fire.
I'll lay down a cover for you.

85
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:09,979
- I'll get you a lead.
- All right.

There anything we can do?

It's not a bite.
I cut myself pretty bad though.

We'll have it looked at.
I'll tell them you're here.

We have some painkillers
and antibiotics.

107

I already gave him some.
If Carl needs any.

108

Whether to operate on your

It ain't

Nine days in the woods

My old man was off on

Went straight into the kitchen

No worse for wear.

I call that an advantage.

146
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:15,148
Maybe this isn't a world

Yeah well,

Maybe he shouldn't be.

150
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:24,598
Maybe this is how
it's supposed to be.

151
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:29,353
You can't mean that.

152
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:35,554
Okay.
All right.

153
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,817
I can understand that
thought crossing your mind.

154
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:40,742
It didn't cross my mind, Rick.
I can't stop thinking it.

155
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:43,952
Why do we want Carl
to live in this world?

156
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:46,191
To have this life?

157

hungry and scared

159

for however long
he has before he...

160
00:13:57,274 --> 00:14:01,207
So he can run and run
and run and run

161
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:04,087
and then even if he
survives he ends up...

162
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,778
he ends up just another
animal who doesn't know
anything except survival?

163
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:12,549

if he dies tonight,

00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:18,382
it ends for him.

be better another way.

167

What?

169
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,747
Jenner offered us
a way out.

170
00:14:33,763 --> 00:14:35,733
You asked him
to let us keep trying.

171
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,570
You begged him.

172
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:40,091
"For as long
as we can," you said.
What changed?

173
00:14:40,093 --> 00:14:41,685
There was a moment
the other day...

174
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:44,967
it was just a second
but I forgot Jacqui was dead.

175
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:47,758
I turned around,
I wanted to tell
her something.

176
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:51,108
I almost said her name.
It was just a second
and then I remembered.

177
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,763
But then I realized she
didn't have to see any of it.

she didn't...

180
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:07,304
She doesn't have
to be afraid anymore.

181
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,649
Hungry.
Angry.

182
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:12,528
It hasn't stopped
happening, Rick.

183

It's like we live with
a knife at our throats
every second of every day.

184
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:18,969
But Jacqui doesn't.
Not anymore.

185
00:15:19,007 --> 00:15:21,581
And then...

186
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,949
I thought,
"maybe Jenner was right."

187
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:32,479
I don't accept that.

None of it.

be better if Carl...

00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:33,615
Sorry.
Go ahead.

318
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:35,842
<i>Really.</i>

319
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:41,144
You gonna watch?

320
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,585
I'll get you
a refill instead.

321
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:57,866
I know it's not my business,

322
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:59,895
and feel free
to believe in God,

323
00:26:59,915 --> 00:27:03,333
but the thing is
you've got to make it
okay somehow

324
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:06,377
no matter what happens.

325
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:54,247
Before it happened

326
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:57,741
we were standing there
in the woods

327
00:27:57,777 --> 00:28:01,243
and this deer

328
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:03,631
just crossed
right in front of us.

329
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:07,279
I swear it just
planted itself there

330
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,785
and looked Carl
right in the eye.

331
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:13,766
And I looked at Carl

332
00:28:13,768 --> 00:28:16,849
looking at that deer,
and that deer looking
right back at Carl.

333
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:18,831
And that moment just...

334
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,387
( Sighs )

335
00:28:25,197 --> 00:28:27,795
Slipped away.

336
00:28:27,797 --> 00:28:30,348
It slipped away.

337
00:28:30,397 --> 00:28:34,448
That's what he was talking
about when he woke up,

338
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:37,909
not about getting shot

339
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,673
or what happened
at the church.

340
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,992
He talked about
something beautiful,

341
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:46,712
something living.

342
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:49,859
There's still
a life for us,

343
00:28:49,905 --> 00:28:52,517
a place maybe like this.

344
00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:55,581
It isn't all death
out there.

345
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:57,936
It can't be.

346
00:28:58,052 --> 00:28:59,712
We just have to be
strong enough

347
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:03,260
after everything we've seen
to still believe that.

348
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:06,863
Why is it better for Carl
to live even in this world?

349
00:29:09,196 --> 00:29:13,490
He talked about
the deer, Lori.

350
00:29:13,524 --> 00:29:15,764
<i>He talked about
the deer.</i>

351
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:22,409
<i>Shane:
Oh, shit.</i>

352
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:25,645
( Both groan )

353
00:29:25,686 --> 00:29:28,479
Got to get to the street,
double back to the truck.

354
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:31,046
- Look, we ain't
gonna make it, okay?
- Got to try, man.

355
00:29:31,077 --> 00:29:33,316
- Come on, get up.
- You're gonna take these bags

356
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,970
- and you're gonna go.
- I ain't leaving you behind.

357
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,757
Okay.

358
00:29:43,717 --> 00:29:45,940
How many rounds
you got left?

359
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:47,713
Four. You?

360
00:29:47,736 --> 00:29:49,957
Five and one in the pipe.

361
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,535
( Snarling, growling )

362
00:29:57,377 --> 00:29:59,710
( Gunshot )

363
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:04,031
( Gunshot )

364
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:15,846
He's still losing blood
faster than we can replace it.

365
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,152
And with the swelling
in his abdomen

366
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:20,206
we can't wait any longer

367
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,296
or he's just going
to slip away.

368
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:24,842
Now I need to know right now

369
00:30:24,877 --> 00:30:26,938
if you want me to do this,

370
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:29,485
because I think your boy
is out of time.

371
00:30:32,138 --> 00:30:33,297
You have to make a choice.

372
00:30:33,304 --> 00:30:35,937
- A choice?
- A choice.

373
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:39,441
You have to tell me
what it is.

374
00:30:39,443 --> 00:30:41,554
You have to
tell me what it is.

375
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,015
We do it.

376
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:00,218
Okay, get the corner
of that bed.

377
00:31:00,252 --> 00:31:01,931
Let's get the sheets down.

378
00:31:01,939 --> 00:31:04,647
Get the I.V. bag
on the sheet.

379
00:31:04,686 --> 00:31:08,534
<i>Okay, on three.</i>

380
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:11,524
One, two, three.

381
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,903
Rick, Lori,

382
00:31:32,937 --> 00:31:34,951
you may want to step out.

383
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:38,710
<i>( Truck approaching )</i>

384
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:44,196
<i>Rick:
Oh God.</i>

385
00:31:44,226 --> 00:31:46,697
You stay here with him.

386
00:31:59,358 --> 00:32:02,106
- Carl?
- There's still a chance.

387
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,416
Otis?

388
00:32:09,293 --> 00:32:11,223
No.

389
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:20,524
We say nothing to Patricia.

390
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,975
Not till after.
I need her.

391
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:45,155
They kept blocking us
at every turn.

392
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,860
We had nothing left.
We were down to 10 rounds.

393
00:32:47,862 --> 00:32:50,452
Then he said...
he said he'd cover me

394
00:32:50,486 --> 00:32:52,210
and that I should
keep going.

395
00:32:52,427 --> 00:32:54,947
So that's what I did.
I just...

396
00:32:54,969 --> 00:32:57,586
I kept going.
But I...

397
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:03,196
I looked back and he...

398
00:33:07,663 --> 00:33:09,831
I tried.

399
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:12,467
He wanted to make it right.

400
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:21,879
( Crying )

401
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:04,462
Andrea.
Wait.

402
00:34:04,592 --> 00:34:06,496
What do you want, Dale?

403
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,043
To give you this.

404
00:34:09,106 --> 00:34:11,122
<i>I care about you</i>

405
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:14,065
so I made a choice
for you...  choices.

406
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:17,977
I know why I did it,
but this is not my gun.

407
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:20,867
And the choices
that I made for you

408
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:22,372
were not mine to make.

409
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,719
But I can still ask,

410
00:34:31,876 --> 00:34:34,297
and this is not
to make you guilty

411
00:34:34,331 --> 00:34:37,110
or put me ahead of you,
but I can still ask,

412
00:34:38,816 --> 00:34:40,292
please...

413
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:44,486
Don't make me regret this.

414
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:49,595
I'll take watch.

415
00:34:51,196 --> 00:34:53,219
So do you forgive
me for...

416
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:59,166
do you forgive me?

417
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,698
I'm trying.

418
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:16,999
I've known Otis
since I was a kid.

419
00:35:17,105 --> 00:35:20,664
He's run this farm
since before my mother died.

420
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,002
Who else?

421
00:35:33,036 --> 00:35:35,777
Who'd you lose?

422
00:35:39,009 --> 00:35:41,573
You told me I had
to make it okay somehow.

423
00:35:43,195 --> 00:35:45,697
That's what you've been
trying to do, right?

424
00:35:45,731 --> 00:35:47,670
Which ones?

425
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:55,592
Stepmother.

426
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:01,344
Stepbrother.

427
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:18,433
He seems to have
stabilized.

428
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:20,277
( Exhales )
Oh God.

429
00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:33,686
I don't have words.

430
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,908
I don't either.
Wish I did.

431
00:36:37,977 --> 00:36:40,203
How do I tell Patricia
about Otis?

432
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,527
You go to Carl.

433
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,878
I'll go with Hershel.

434
00:37:15,168 --> 00:37:17,926
( Patricia sobbing )

435
00:37:38,918 --> 00:37:41,605

436
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:10,348
Stay.

437
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:51,624
The bathroom's upstairs.

438
00:38:51,676 --> 00:38:54,717
- I brought you some clothes.
- Thank you.

439
00:38:54,825 --> 00:38:57,428
They won't fit well.
They were Otis's.

440
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,242
<i>Shane:
How many rounds
you got left?</i>

- Down to my last.

00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:56,866
