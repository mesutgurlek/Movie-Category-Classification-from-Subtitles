in my room, and...

177
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,251
something grabbed me
and smothered me.

178
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,957
Did you call the police?

179

- No.
- Why?

Yeah, I checked everything.
Everything was locked.

I couldn't have bitten myself.

484
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,224
Carla, I've seen
cases of hysteria

485
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,060
that have raised welts,

486
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,600
caused blindness,
loss of hearing.

487
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,526
Well, haven't your tests
told you anything?

488
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,656
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

489
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:46,661
We know that there is nothing
wrong with you medically,

490
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,913
physiologically, that is.

491
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,291
And as far as we can tell,
your intellect

492
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,497
seems to function as well,
if not better than normal.

493
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,504
So that leaves only one area
for us to explore--

494
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,711
early psychological
development,

495
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,967
emotional development.

496
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,547
What does that mean?

497
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,963
Well, the general idea

498
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,973
is that certain phases
of our life never really die.

499
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,635
They continue to exist
within us, all of us.

Now I'm talking
about you, me, everybody,

501
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,939
and they affect us
the rest of our lives.

502
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,941
For certain reasons,
they come back.

503
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,443
By coming back--

504
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,148
And sometimes they come back
with a vengeance--

505
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,234
they can cause delusions,

506
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,149
anxieties,

507
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,443

Look, Carla,
what I'm going to do

510
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,497
is I'm going to give you
some tranquilizers, okay?

511
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,503
They won't knock you out,
but they will reduce your anxiety,

512
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,335
which can be as bad
as the delusion itself.

if you can believe it.

He actually spoke
with "thee" and "thou."

I was six before I realized
not everyone talked that way.

It was quite a shock.

589

Why were you afraid of him?

590
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,933
Because when he held me,

591
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,977
it wasn't the way a father
should hold a daughter.

But you did like
making love with him?

and then it turned bad.

- I see. How old were you?
- 16.

618
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,300
Gee.
So Billy wasn't born yet?

619
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:23,307
No. I mean, I was pregnant.

620
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,477
How did you feel when he died?

621
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,518
How do you think I felt?

622
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,603
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

623
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,393
- He was my husband.
- Yeah, I know that,

624
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,186
but I still don't know
how you felt.

625
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,817

627
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,417

for Bob Garrett.

- Julie and Kim's father.

629

Ah, right, right, right.

630
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,213
He was older.
He knew a lot.

631
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:01,630
He made me see
that life was good,

632
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:05,016
that men and women loving
each other was good, healthy,

633
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:08,018
having children
was good, simple.

634
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,475
So Bob was your second husband?

635
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,936
Well, no.
We were never legally married.

636

I don't know.

638

to stay in one place very long.

639
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,491
I'm impressed.

640
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,998
By what?
By what? Your independence,

641
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,578
knowing who you are,
what you want,

642
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,664
keeping your family together,
doing it the hard way.

643
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,959
I do need your help.

644
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,720
I really do.

645
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,926
And I won't fight you.

646
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,351
Because if it is me, if it's
really me creating all this,

647
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,012
if I'm that sick...

648
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:54,478
then I have to be stopped.

649
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,731
But if it isn't me...

650
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:02,106
then we have to make a deal,
you and I,

651
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,277
to accept that fact and find
about a way to stop it, okay?

652
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,446
Okay.

Well, Dr. Sneiderman explained
it was like a very powerful dream.

701
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,794
Mrs. Moran...

702
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,044
did you believe him?

703
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,628

704
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,546

00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:15,387
cannot. Hmm?

Why?

707
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:25,018
Because he hurt my son.
He broke his wrist.

708
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:28,654
Because my children feel it.

709
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,782
Because of the marks on my body.
They're in places I--

I can't do it to myself.

711
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,534
Why does he attack you, Carla,

not anyone else?

713

I don't know.

714
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,038
I suppose he chose me.

715

716
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,718

Would it be a reflection
on you as a woman

00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,853
if he left you,

or if you were cured?

720
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,944
No. It would not be

Certainly, and thank you very much,
Carla, for letting us talk to you.

00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:46,728
- Sure.
- All right.

732
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:53,280
Quite a young lady.

733
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:56,113
- Yep.
- How did you meet her?

734
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,277
I was on call one night at
the clinic, she walked in.

735
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:00,037
Just came in out of the blue?

00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,538
- Please.
- There you go.

737
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:03,665
- Thank you.
- A walk-in.

738
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,418
That's how it happens.

739
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,421
- Yeah.
- She's masturbating.

740
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,207
This entire circus,
she has invented it

741
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,046
to cover up what
every little girl does.

742
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,586
Well, with all due respect, sir,

743
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,721
that was my initial diagnosis,

744
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,382
but I think we can all agree

745
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:21,892
that that's not some teenager
with an identity crisis,

746
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,643
and now she tells us

747
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,146
that her children are feeling
this thing too, so...

748
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:30,276
It's a mass illusion,
folie a quatre.

749
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:33,608
Hysteria is contagious.
Given the right circumstances,

750
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,399
anyone can see and feel things
that simply aren't there.

751
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,533
Her children are just
supporting Mama's delusions.

752
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,535
Okay, classically correct,
sir, but her mind

753
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,447
is giving her very strong
and explicit images.

754
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:46,458
Why is she going to such lengths
to support this delusion? It--

755
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,415
Phil, look at the record.

756
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:51,421
She believes that her father
has incestuous desires.

757
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:55,175
She falls in love with an adolescent,
a typical overgrown kid.

758
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,257
He tries to prove he's
a real man, and he's not.

759
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,092
After which,
she picks up with this...

760
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,427
- Jerry Anderson?
- No, Garrett.

761
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,137
- Oh, Garrett.
- Bob Garrett, right?

762
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,302
A man old enough
to be her father.

763
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:06,846
See a pattern here?

764
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,889
I think I know what you're suggesting.
I don't know that I agree, though.

765
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,649
- Safe sex.
- PHIL: Well--

766
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:12,651
It's the story of Carla's life.

767
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,939
She's consistently refused to
get involved in the real thing.

768
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,529
- She has three children.
- What does that prove?

769
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,443
It doesn't take sex
to make babies.

770
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,157
That is a fact
I wasn't aware of.

771
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,947
- Well, now you know.
- Not real sex.

772
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,660
Now, for 32 years,

773
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,952
Carla goes along very smoothly,

774
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,336
and all of a sudden,
she meets this fellow--

775
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:33,247
- What's his name?
- Jerry Anderson?

776
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,460
- Now you have it.
- Ah, now I'm on it.

777
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:36,170
Okay. And, pow,

778
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:40,008
she drifts into
a Dionysian fantasy.

779
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,014
Don't you see?
It's exactly the kind of situation

780
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,516
that can energize
this sort of breakdown.

781
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,052
What, Anderson?

782
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,721
Certainly. A real man. Sure.
She wants the real thing.

783
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,731
No more faking it
with kids and old men.

784
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,985
And faced with the real thing,
Carla buckles.

785
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,396
She falls back
into an infantile reality.

786
00:55:57,563 --> 00:56:00,407
Now, I suggest
you dig a lot deeper.

787
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,159
I think you're
going to find out more,

788
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,194
and maybe you'll find out

789
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,831
that Carla is
not what she seems to be.

790
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,788
MAN:
Hear, hear.

791
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,870
(CARLA CHUCKLES)

792
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,962
You look different.

793
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,473
- How?
- I don't know.

794
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,976
The face,
this serious look.

795

- 80's yours.
- No, no.

797
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,730
changed or something.

798
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:37,566
What is it?

799
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,239
It's been a long time.

800
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,026
You know, it's been too long.

801
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,785
- Something's wrong?
- No.

802

- No.

803

804
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,908
Come on.

805
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,294
No. Just nothing.
It's...

806
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:57,172
I'm only afraid.

807
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:00,005
You know, I'm just--
when you're not around,

808
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:03,011
I'm afraid of losing you.

809
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,638
That's all.

810
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,469
You won't lose me, honey.

811
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,094
I go crazy thinking about it.

812
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,933
Don't go crazy either.

813
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,891
What if I did?

814
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,895
What if I went crazy?

815
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,991
Now, you're not going to go
and do that right now.

816
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,370
What would you do if I did?
Would you leave me?

817
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,828
You'd still be my Carla.

818
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,913
Why are you
carrying on tonight?

819
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,254
Are you ready for my surprise?

820
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,541
Yeah.

821
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,380
I'm going
on the road again, Carly,

822
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,886
but this is the last time.

823
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:47,173
When I get back, it's for good.

824
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:50,058
I'm taking over the LA office.

825
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,972
We're going to be
a family, Carly, all of us.

826
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:02,563
Take me with you.
Please?

827
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,152
Just put me in your pocket
and take me with you.

828
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,283
Honey, I can't.
You know that.

829
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,945
Don't ask that.
What the hell are you asking,

830
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,989
to take you with me?
Where? On the road?

831
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,783
Yeah. I'll go anywhere with you.

832
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,749
Okay, what about your job,
your school?

833
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,959
How about the kids?
Who's going to take care of them?

834
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:22,045
Yeah, all right. Okay.

835
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,585
You're right.
It was just a pipe dream.

836
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:30,136
You have to go on the road,
and I have to go through what...

837
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,551
I'm going through.

838
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:34,436
What you're going through?

839
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,937
You know, you're not
telling me everything.

840
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,439
What the hell
are you going through?

841
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,940
What I'm going through's
being without you.

842
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,726
That's really
what I'm going through.

843
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,394
Car, it's all going to change.

844
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:45,405
Oh, sure. When you get back.

845
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,566
Just one more trip.

846
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:51,579

it's been ever since we met?

848
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,628
No, I'm sorry.
I don't feel like it.

849
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,460
I'm sorry.

850
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:08,095
Look, I have to--
I think I should go home.

851
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:11,097
It's late, and I have
to get up early. Okay?

852
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,099
I'll take you home.

853
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,386
No. You call me a cab.

854

to sign yourself
into the hospital.

880

No. I won't let myself
be committed.

No, you're not being committed.

that if we wanted to,

we can insist
that you stay here.

when you crashed your car?

- It was a suicide attempt, Carla.

We could have you in here

- To stay alive.

Carla, listen to me.

01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,481
You're running the risk
of harming your children.

906
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,892
No. They won't be harmed.

907
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,435
Billy has already
broken his wrist.

908

Beyond that, you're harming them
psychologically.

There's nothing wrong
with my children.

910
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,944
Carla, that's not the environment
they need. You know that.

911
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,576
Look, I know you think I'm crazy.
it doesn't matter about your theories.

912
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,328
Whether it's me or something
else is beside the point now.

913
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,740
What are you telling me? You're going to
stay home and be victimized?

- Yes. Yes.
- Yes?

I'll go to secretarial school.

I'll look for a better job.

is to go into any hospital.

01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:01,591
Mm-hmm, and you'll
be beaten and frightened.

01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:03,877
- No. No.
- No? No? Why not?

to cooperate with him.

listen to reason,

reasonably, okay?

No more questions
and answers, hmm?

925
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:33,540
You know, there was a time when people
believed in the supernatural.

926
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,917
Here. I want you
to look at these pictures.

927
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,870
Pretty frightening, huh?

928
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:42,462
Bats, werewolves,
dragons, demons,

929
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:45,093
all sorts of goblins, okay?

930
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:48,095
They were supposed
to abuse people sexually.

931
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,973
They were supposed
to impregnate people.

932
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,226
Do you think these things
really exist in there?

933
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:55,762
- I am not stupid.
- I didn't say you were stupid.

934
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:57,977
But why do you think these
people saw these things, huh?

935
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:00,517
Why do you think
they saw them?

936
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,106
Hmm? Can you take a guess?
Do you know why?

937
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:06,022
Because it was a way of expressing
something that was frightening to them.

938
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:08,237
- It has nothing to do with me.
- Wait a second. Carla...

939
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:09,992
- it has a lot to do with you.
- It has nothing to do with me.

940
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,619
Oh, no, it has a lot
to do with you.

941
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:13,280
It has an awful lot
to do with you.

942
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:16,290
These ghosts and demons
were only ideas,

943
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,451
but people saw them.

944
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:24,257
Look, Carla, let's say
a man who wanted to be good

945
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:27,259
had a desire
for his neighbor's wife.

946
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:30,092
He knows it's wrong,
he feels terrible about it,

947
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,508
but the desire
is growing and growing.

948
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,302
Desire can be a very frightening
and powerful sensation.

949
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,597
How does he deal with it?
He invents a creature,

950
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:41,562
an evil, ugly,
evil-tempered creature

951

which is just a picture
of his own desire, Carla.

952
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,445
I have no need of inventing
anything, Dr. Sneiderman.

953
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:49,073
Come on, Carla, stop it.
You have a lot of need.

954
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:50,484
You were scared
of your daddy.

955
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:51,822
He was a minister.
He held you in a way

956
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:53,237
- he shouldn't have held you.
- Stop it.

957
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,871
- You were pregnant at 16.
- Oh, shut up!

958
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,497
A drug-crazed guy
went off and killed himself.

959
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:57,748
- Stop it!
- Another guy left you

960
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,409
with two kids.
Now, Carla, stop it!

961
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:03,171
Come on. Do the work, Carla.
What was evil to your family?

962
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,832
All sorts of things were evil
to my family. You know that.

963
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,592
Carla, we know your family well enough
to know what was evil to them.

964
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,172
As a child, you knew
what was evil to him. What?

965
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:11,838
- Sex. They were afraid of sex.
- Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex.

966
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,552
They were afraid of sex.
Exactly.

967
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,264
So let's use our imagination
a little bit, okay?

968
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:17,769
Let's try putting
some things together.

969

it's getting all mixed up.

970
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:20,897
Your creature is
a symbol, Carla.

971
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,398
A symbol of what?

972
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:24,104
I don't know yet.
Maybe we'll find out.

973
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:27,111
Could be a specific person,
a fear of someone, a desire...

974
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,773
No, I'm not hiding
from anybody or anything!

975
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,034
Carla. Carla, let's talk
about your visitor friend, okay?

976
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:35,866
- Dr. Sneiderman, I'm so sick of this.
- Take a good look at him.

977
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,576
What do we know
about him, Carla?

978
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:39,207
Come on. Let's use your words.
What do we know about him?

979
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,959
We know that he is big,
we know that he is strong.

980
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,041
It's frightening how strong
this guy is, isn't it?

981
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,955
You told me,
unbelievably strong.

982
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,466
So why does he need help?
But he has two helpers, right?

983
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,969
Two little ones? Right?
Those are your words.

984
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,629
One big one
and two little ones.

985
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,138

- Billy's a good-looking kid.

is obscene.

992

He was talking about
two little ones and a big one.

993
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:16,577
He was implying that I wanted
to make love with Billy.

(SIRENS PASSING)

996
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:23,459
- Really.
- It was obscene.

997

There's no other word for it.

998
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,338
No. I think
he just pushed too far.

999
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,465
He pushed too far. It was disgusting.
It was sickening.

1000
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,672
I mean, I know he has to probe
into painful areas

- That's not probing.

They're asleep right now,
and I don't want to disturb them.

Did they sleep
through this whole attack?

Yeah, they managed
to sleep through it.

He broke his wrist--

an electrical discharge?

I don't know what it was.

It was like lightning
was going into him

1259
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:39,189
Yeah.

1260
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:42,309
I can't blame you
for not coming back.

1261
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:44,149
I really did push
a little too hard.

1262
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:46,313
I think you need
to understand something.

1263
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,403
I feel very fine now.

1264
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,442
There are no more attacks.
I have no reason to see you.

1265
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,450
Carla, do you remember
that book I showed you

1266
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:55,489
in the office?
The bats and the dragons?

1267
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:58,205
That's what those guys
are looking for, fantasies.

1268
01:23:58,367 --> 01:23:59,789
No, they have photographs.

1269
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:02,454
Okay.

1270
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:05,465
Look, Carla,
how about you and me,

1271
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:08,127
we make a bargain, okay?

1272
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:11,137
You can see me and still...

1273
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:13,970
have your scientist friends
help you.

1274
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:15,725
I don't see any point in that.

1275
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,386
Well, it's like seeing
two different doctors,

1276
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:19,396
you know,
getting different opinions,

1277
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:21,102
a bone specialist
and a blood specialist.

1278
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,063
- They work together.
- No, I'd rather not.

1279
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:24,647
Why?
What have we got to lose?

1280
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:27,897
I believed in you.

1281
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,565
You know I did.

1282
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:32,860
I really needed to believe in you.
But every time you discovered

1283
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:35,074
something new about me,
something worse happened,

1284
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:37,740
and I got sick of hearing
that it would all go away

1285
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,204
as soon as we got down to the basic
problem, as though it was in me.

1286
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:42,369
It is in you, Carla.

1287
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:46,211
I think you better leave.

1288
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,466
- Hi, Billy.
- Hi.

1289
01:24:55,632 --> 01:24:58,181
- Billy. Billy!
- Yeah?

1290
01:24:58,343 --> 01:24:59,811
- Look, would you do me a favor?
- What?

1291
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,597
Don't pretend next time.

1292
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:03,857
The next time your mother
thinks she sees something

1293
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:05,814
or she hears something,
she wants you to corroborate it,

1294
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:07,603
and when you do, it's that much
more difficult to convince her

1295
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:09,442
that it's all in her head,
it's a delusion.

1296
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,073
I didn't get a broken arm
by pretending.

1297
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,699
Look, Billy, there's a lot
of logical explanations

1298
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,360
that could have caused
something like this.

1299
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:16,779
All I'm telling you, that is,
if you care about your mom,

1300
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,367
you will not pretend next time.

1301
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:20,578
I care about my mother, yeah.
But I was not pretending.

1302
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,243
I'm not lying to you.

1303
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,928
Want to know
why she's not coming back?

1304
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,759
- Mmmmm.
- She's fallen in with some schmucks

1305
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:37,265
who are supporting her fantasies.
You ought to see her house.

1306
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:40,143
They're watching her visitations,
got it all wired to look for poltergei--

1307
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:41,474
- Entities.
- Wait a minute.

1308
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:42,889
That's what they called it,
an entity.

1309
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:44,272
- What schmucks?
- I don't know.

1310
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:45,774
They say they're
from the university here.

- Elizabeth Cooley.
- Yeah.

1315
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:53,858
parapsychology.

1316
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:56,527
It's fly-by-night psychology.

1317
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,491
Okay. So how do we
get rid of 'em?

1318
01:25:58,654 --> 01:25:59,997
Well, not very easily.

1319
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,328
I mean, these are
not snake-oil peddlers, Phil.

1320
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:04,334
These are supposedly
academic brethren.

1321

They're feeding her delusion.

By the time
they get through with her,

1324

she's really going to be
off her rocker or worse.

1325

It's her life, her house,
her delusions.

1328
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,644
No, until she crosses
the line of legal sanity,

1329
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,771
nobody can touch her.

You won't appear.

1343
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:59,862
You won't appear, because you're
a devil out of hell,

and you're afraid.

You'll wait till I'm alone,
won't you?

Then you'll come forth to hurt me,
to hurt my children.

1347
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:42,443
Show yourself.

1348
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:47,406

Yes, Mrs. Moran.

I've never seen

Do you think that we were
in some kind of hypnotic state

and that this was
a mass hallucination?

1370
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,438
I've always believed

1371
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:38,441
that there were several planes
of existence,

distinct and separate...

some discarnate entity,

01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:45,276
I mean, those people
you saw in the house,

1415
01:32:45,435 --> 01:32:47,437
they're psychologists.
They're doctors,

1416
01:32:47,604 --> 01:32:50,448
and they have a theory
that there's something

1417
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:53,451
in the house that...

1418
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:55,328
is keeping me from sleeping,

1419
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:58,457
and they're trying to fix it.

1420
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,619
Some of them looked pretty young
to be doctors.

1421
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:06,669
- Oh, you're mad.
- No, it's not a question of mad.

1422
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,674
- Yeah, okay, since you ask.
- Yeah, you're mad.

1423
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,427
I mean, who brings
a university full of kids

1424
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:12,929
into their house
because they can't sleep?

1425
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,967
You can't sleep, you take a pill.
You go see a regular doctor.

1426
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:18,055
I'm not giving a party, Jerry.
I'm really not.

1427
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:20,141
Hey, all I'm asking for
is a simple explanation.

1428
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:21,600
I still don't know
what's bugging you.

1429
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:23,106
- Yeah.
- Don't treat me like a jerk.

1430
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:24,732
- I'm not a jerk, okay, Carly?
- I'm sorry.

1431
01:33:24,891 --> 01:33:27,269
Trust me. Just tell me
what the hell's happening.

1432
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:31,781
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know--

1433
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:34,784
I don't know the difference

1434
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:36,741
between what is happening

1435
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:39,531
and what I think
might be happening.

1436
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:42,826
The only thing I know for certain
is that it started when you left.

1437
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:45,086
And I don't say that
with any kind of blame

1438
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:47,293
or accusation,
but that is when it started.

1439
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:49,958
When what started, Carly?
What?

1440
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:54,129
All right.

1441
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:58,266
Okay. I was--

1442
01:33:58,424 --> 01:34:00,847
I was attacked.
And it's not happening now,

1443
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:02,307
so don't worry,
but I was attacked.

1444
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:03,938
You were attacked?
By who? Who attacked you?

1445
01:34:04,097 --> 01:34:05,223
- Nobody. Nobody.
- You were attacked?

1446
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:06,391
No, nobody. Nobody.

1447
01:34:08,518 --> 01:34:10,361
Nobody you can see.

1448
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,897
Oh, God.
This sounds so crazy.

1449
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:14,862
I mean, it was like
a horrible dream.

1450
01:34:15,024 --> 01:34:16,617
Shit. I don't know
how to explain it.

1451
01:34:16,776 --> 01:34:19,245
It sounds crazy
every time I explain it.

1452
01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:21,498
- Ohh.
- It sounds crazy.

1453
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,329
God, baby.

1454
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:27,294
Oh, Carla.

1455
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:29,547
Do you know, for a second,
you had me worried?

1456
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:31,504
I mean, I thought
you were really attacked.

1457
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:33,009
I thought that somebody
attacked you.

1458
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:35,170
(LAUGHING)

1459
01:34:37,547 --> 01:34:39,641
JERRY: Honey.

1460
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:42,097
I know why you can't sleep,

1461
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:44,638
but I am with you right now.

1462
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:48,896
I will guarantee you
that these dreams

1463
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:50,605
or nightmares
or whatever the hell they are

1464
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:52,566
will never bother you again.

1465
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:57,609
Because I'm staying this time.
No more trips.

1466
01:34:57,775 --> 01:35:00,619
No more one-night stands, baby.

1467
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:03,782
Starting tonight,
it's going to be forever.

1468
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:16,044
Hey.

1469
01:35:16,211 --> 01:35:18,464
Let's go to bed.

1470
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:20,257
Huh?

1471
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:22,175
Hey, can we go to your place?

1472
01:35:22,342 --> 01:35:25,562
Uh-uh.
Remember, I'm with you,

1473
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,688
and as long as I am,

1474
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:29,770
nothing bad is going to happen.

1475
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:31,731
Do you believe that?

1476
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:36,072
I got something for you.

1477
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:40,322
What? What is this?

1478
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:41,987
You'll see.

1479
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:48,501
Oh.

1480
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,833
Aw, it's beautiful.

1481
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:52,542
- Mmm.
- It's pure silk.

1482
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:54,548
It feels good.

1483
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:58,215
Go put it on for me.

1484
01:35:58,378 --> 01:35:59,971
Come on.
It's my homecoming.

1485
01:36:00,129 --> 01:36:01,631
Put it on.

1486
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:17,363
(HUMMING)

1487
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:45,593
Look, honey. You know what
I was thinking? If we--

1488
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:47,635
Please. Help me.

1489
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:49,600
Help me.

1490
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,724
Help me. Help me.

1491
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,483
Help me.

1492
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:57,566
Help me. Help me.

1493
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:01,074
Help me.

1494
01:37:02,692 --> 01:37:05,366
Help me. Help me.

1495
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,953
Please, help me.

1496
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:12,960
Help me.

1497
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,871
Help me. Help me!

1498
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:16,585
Help me.

1499
01:37:16,748 --> 01:37:19,547
Help me. Help me.

1500
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:22,921
(JERRY SCREAMS)

1501
01:37:29,218 --> 01:37:30,595
Help me. Help me.

1502
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:33,231
Help me.

1503
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:36,063
Stop it. Stop it.

1504
01:37:36,225 --> 01:37:37,397
- Get off her.
- Help me.

1505
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,403
- Help me.
- Stop it!

1506
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:41,940
Stop it!

1507
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:43,904
You son of a bitch!

1508
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:49,117
You fucking bastard!
You son of a bitch!

1509
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:54,335
WOMAN ON P.A.:
Dr. Bronstein, Dr. Loomis...

1510
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:55,791
Okay. She's going
to be all right.

1511
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:57,455
- Yeah?
- She's still a little shaky,

1512
01:37:57,622 --> 01:37:59,499
so when you go in,
don't stay too long, okay?

1513
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:01,212
- All right.
- Okay. All right. Go in.

1514
01:38:01,376 --> 01:38:02,923
Go in.
She's dying to see you.

1515
01:38:03,086 --> 01:38:04,429
Make a right
at the corner there.

1516
01:38:04,587 --> 01:38:05,930
- BILL: First right?
- First door on your right.

1517
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:07,386
- Thanks a lot.
- You got it.

1518
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:09,050
Don't stay too long.
Please don't.

1519
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:13,767
Okay, Jerry,
she's going to be okay.

1520
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,682
It was just
a slight concussion.

1521
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:19,394
Thank God for that, Doctor.

1522
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,937
Thank God.

1523
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:22,777
Look, why don't you
go in and see her?

1524
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:24,816
She'd like to see you.

1525
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:27,155
No way, Doctor.

1526
01:38:27,318 --> 01:38:29,412
I can't be around her.

1527
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,038
I can't handle
what's going on in there.

1528
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:32,449
Come on, Jerry.
What do you mean

1529
01:38:32,615 --> 01:38:34,083
you can't handle it?
She needs you now.

1530
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:36,085
I mean, I loved her.

1531
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:40,714
I was going to marry her,
you know.

1532
01:38:40,873 --> 01:38:44,002
I could've taken anything,
I mean, a disease, cancer.

1533
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,421
This is a disease, Jerry.
It's the same thing.

1534
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:47,839
Not what she's
got living with her.

1535
01:38:48,005 --> 01:38:50,133
Jerry, it's just
a disease now, okay?

1536
01:38:50,299 --> 01:38:51,721
Now just get it
through your head.

1537
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:53,557
It's just in her head.
There was nobody there.

1538
01:38:53,719 --> 01:38:55,016
Nobody was there.

1539
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:56,647
Don't tell me that.
There was somebody there.

1540
01:38:56,806 --> 01:38:58,058
- Okay. Okay.
- I mean, there was.

1541
01:38:58,224 --> 01:38:59,771
Okay, okay.
Take it easy.

1542
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:02,357
I couldn't see him with my eyes,
but there was somebody there.

1543
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:05,239
I see this--

1544
01:39:05,398 --> 01:39:07,275
like something is pressing her.

1545
01:39:07,442 --> 01:39:08,910
It's pushing her.

1546
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:12,072
I see her breasts
are being touched.

1547
01:39:14,073 --> 01:39:16,292
I mean, I see her breasts
are being squeezed by fingers,

1548
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:18,294
only I can't see the fingers.

1549
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:21,539
I'm sorry.

1550
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:23,424
That's okay. That's okay.

1551
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:28,008
Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing here?

1552
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:29,673
We're visiting a friend.

1553
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:35,728
- I got to go now.
- No, no. Oh, Jerry, look.

1554
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:37,764
She needs you now.
She needs you now a lot.

1555
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:39,603
It's okay. It's okay.
I really have to go.

1556
01:39:39,765 --> 01:39:41,267
Hey, Jerry--

1557
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:45,280
- NURSE: Look at me.
- GENE: Thanks for calling, Billy.

1558
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:47,941
- Come on.
- No. I want to stay with Mommy.

1559
01:39:48,107 --> 01:39:50,075
Come on.
We've got to go.

1560
01:39:50,234 --> 01:39:52,612
- I'll talk to you later, Mom.
- Okay.

1561
01:39:52,778 --> 01:39:54,701
I hope you're all right,
Mrs. Moran.

1562
01:39:54,864 --> 01:39:56,958
NURSE:
I'll be back.

1563
01:39:57,116 --> 01:39:59,289
We never should've left
the house. I'm sorry.

1564
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:03,127
Maybe this doesn't seem
like the best time for this,

1565
01:40:03,289 --> 01:40:05,041
but we're afraid for you.

1566
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:09,633
JOE: We have an idea
that might help.

1567
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:13,390
We want to try to isolate
this thing and immobilize it.

1568
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:15,847
COOLEY:
We need your consent.

1569
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:18,980
That means going into it
with your eyes wide open.

1570
01:40:19,138 --> 01:40:22,984
What we have in mind
has never been tried before.

1571
01:40:23,142 --> 01:40:26,396
We'll take
every possible precaution.

1572
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:33,494
I'll do anything...

1573
01:40:33,653 --> 01:40:35,781
to get rid of him.

1574
01:40:38,741 --> 01:40:40,835
That guy Jerry was
her only contact with reality.

1575
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:43,087
I want those two guys
banished from her life.

1576
01:40:43,246 --> 01:40:45,795
I don't see what I can do.

1577
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:48,631
Well, go to the dean.
Maybe he can do something.

1578
01:40:48,793 --> 01:40:50,545
Maybe he can
pull those creeps back.

1579
01:40:52,088 --> 01:40:53,840
Do you realize
what you're asking?

1580
01:40:54,006 --> 01:40:55,724
- That's a month-long debate...
- Right.

1581
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:57,977
And it could get
very complicated.

1582
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:01,689
All this for Carla Moran?

1583
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:06,273
Somebody's got
to look after her.

1584
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:08,529
Let her go, Phil.

1585
01:41:08,688 --> 01:41:11,862
You don't have any choice,
professionally or personally.

1586
01:41:14,402 --> 01:41:18,032
GENE: As you can see,
this is a freshly cut rose,

1587
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:21,041
and this is a container
of liquid helium,

1588
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,453
473 degrees below zero.

1589
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:25,417
This is the coldest substance
known to man.

1590
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:27,002
Anything frozen
at this temperature

1591
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:29,383
will shatter
at the slightest touch.

1592
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:47,773
What we are seeking
is to determine

1593
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:50,358
if this entity has mass.

1594
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,740
If in fact this is the case,

1595
01:41:52,898 --> 01:41:55,526
then we should be able
to freeze it,

1596
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:57,946
verify its objective existence,

1597
01:41:58,112 --> 01:42:00,160
and prove that it isn't
just a psychic projection...

1598
01:42:00,323 --> 01:42:01,745
It's going to work great,
isn't it?

1599
01:42:01,907 --> 01:42:04,660
...but rather an independent
force from some other

1600
01:42:04,827 --> 01:42:07,751
level of reality
that has never been isolated.

1601
01:42:07,913 --> 01:42:10,007
Here she is.

1602
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:14,253
Mrs. Moran.

1603
01:42:16,464 --> 01:42:18,091
Let me take your bag.

1604
01:42:18,257 --> 01:42:20,305
It's good to see you.

1605
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:23,472
We're all very excited
to get the experiment under way.

1606
01:42:26,057 --> 01:42:28,435
- Welcome.
- GENE: Mrs. Moran.

1607
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:30,319
See you later.

1608
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:35,108
Have you made arrangements
for your children?

1609
01:42:35,274 --> 01:42:38,244
- They're with a friend.
- Good.

1610
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:41,030
Let me show you
to your new house.

1611
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:45,080
I'm afraid we're not able

1612
01:42:45,242 --> 01:42:47,620
to provide you
with all the conveniences,

1613
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:51,291
but we hope
you'll find it comfortable

1614
01:42:51,457 --> 01:42:54,461
- and familiar.
- JOE: Watch your step.

1615
01:42:57,922 --> 01:43:01,142
I think everyone's done a terrific
job in recreating your home.

1616
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,302
We did use different colors
on the walls.

1617
01:43:03,469 --> 01:43:06,393
And there are other differences.
No light switches.

1618
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:09,525
We have to control
the electricity.

1619
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:12,654
This, of course,
is the children's room.

1620
01:43:12,812 --> 01:43:15,031
Yeah, the bed's
in the wrong place.

1621
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:17,612
Well, doesn't matter.

1622
01:43:17,775 --> 01:43:19,743
There are no ceilings
anywhere in the house.

1623
01:43:19,902 --> 01:43:21,404
That's for
the television monitoring.

1624
01:43:24,365 --> 01:43:25,958
Except, of course,
in the bathroom.

1625
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:30,167
There is a ceiling,
but no plumbing.

1626
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:32,832
We'll supply you
with all the water you need.

1627
01:43:32,998 --> 01:43:35,171
That's a chemical toilet.

1628
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:40,222
Does this look familiar?

1629
01:43:40,381 --> 01:43:41,974
It's a good simulation.

1630
01:43:49,515 --> 01:43:51,859
And remember
not to change in here.

1631
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:54,611
The television camera
will be watching you,

1632
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:58,195
and Gene at the controls.

1633
01:44:00,276 --> 01:44:04,031
COOLEY: Now, in the kitchen,
we had a bit of a problem.

1634
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:07,040
No gas, but we have a hot plate

1635
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:09,543
and a well-stocked refrigerator.

1636
01:44:09,702 --> 01:44:11,670
It's like camping out.

1637
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:20,259
Mrs. Moran, I'd like
to show you something now.

1638
01:44:22,423 --> 01:44:24,096
Looks a lot like your house,
doesn't it?

1639
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:26,886
The living room.
Brought your books.

1640
01:44:27,052 --> 01:44:29,180
Just stand over here with me.

1641
01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:41,530
Mrs. Moran, this is the protected area
that we were talking about.

1642
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:43,694
It's two pieces of double-thick,
heat-treated glass

1643
01:44:43,861 --> 01:44:45,829
with a vacuum
in between the panes.

1644
01:44:45,988 --> 01:44:48,832
Now, the system is fail-safe.
We can't activate the helium

1645
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:51,039
until you're safely
behind this enclosure,

1646
01:44:51,202 --> 01:44:53,671
so when we tell you to go
to the protected area,

1647
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:55,627
we want you to come
directly to this spot

1648
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:58,418
as quickly as possible,
and we'll take care of the rest.

1649
01:45:06,509 --> 01:45:09,729
Okay?
Now we have to get ready.

1650
01:45:09,887 --> 01:45:12,481
You make yourself
as comfortable as you can,

1651
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,483
but you're not alone.

1652
01:45:14,642 --> 01:45:17,111
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

1653
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:21,570
I'm not afraid.

1654
01:45:23,067 --> 01:45:25,320
If you can get him,

1655
01:45:25,486 --> 01:45:27,454
I'm not afraid.

1656
01:45:27,613 --> 01:45:30,457
Hey. Where do you think
you're going?

1657
01:45:30,616 --> 01:45:32,789
- Is this the Cooley experiment?
- Yeah.

1658
01:45:32,952 --> 01:45:35,705
Yeah, I'm with the Medical
Institute, Dr. Sneiderman.

1659
01:45:35,871 --> 01:45:37,669
- Go right on in, Doctor.
- Thank you.

1660
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:41,627
(DOOR CLOSES)

1661
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:09,784
Carla.

1662
01:46:09,947 --> 01:46:11,995
I'd like to talk to you alone.

1663
01:46:12,157 --> 01:46:16,037
Is there any place
that we could go talk?

1664
01:46:19,832 --> 01:46:21,334
That we could talk privately?

1665
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:24,128
The bathroom.

1666
01:46:35,139 --> 01:46:37,938
This is quite a setup they have.

1667
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:42,276
They made a natural environment
for him so he'll come here.

1668
01:46:42,438 --> 01:46:45,282
Really? Is that
what they're telling you?

1669
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:46,863
That's what they're doing.

1670
01:46:47,026 --> 01:46:48,949
Uh-huh.
And you believe them?

1671
01:46:49,111 --> 01:46:51,239
Oh, yes.

1672
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:54,625
They're dangerous frauds, Carla.
You're their guinea pig.

1673
01:46:57,453 --> 01:46:59,831
Carla, do you know
that there are tanks

1674
01:46:59,997 --> 01:47:01,544
of liquid helium outside?
Did you know that?

1675
01:47:01,707 --> 01:47:03,050
- Mm-hmm.
- You do?

1676
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:04,676
Do you know
what liquid helium can do?

1677
01:47:04,835 --> 01:47:06,382
- Of course.
- Of course. Really?

1678
01:47:06,545 --> 01:47:08,923
You understand what it means
to stop all molecular motion,

1679
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:11,183
paralyze atomic particles,
decompose matter?

1680
01:47:11,342 --> 01:47:13,595
- Okay,
- Okay?

1681
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:16,435
What do you mean, okay?

1682
01:47:16,597 --> 01:47:17,940
I mean I'd rather be dead

1683
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:20,692
than living the way
I've been living.

1684
01:47:20,851 --> 01:47:22,694
Do you understand that?

1685
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:25,151
Yes, I can understand that.

1686
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:27,737
Yes. I also understand

1687
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:30,744
that I care very much
what happens to you,

1688
01:47:30,903 --> 01:47:33,406
very much.

1689
01:47:33,572 --> 01:47:36,872
And I know that, in your heart,

1690
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:40,288
you know the difference
between reality and fantasy.

1691
01:47:41,622 --> 01:47:43,841
Carla, look at me. Carla.

1692
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:45,467
Our reason, our intelligence,

1693
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:47,048
that's the only thing
that distinguishes us

1694
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:49,009
between any other species
of animal.

1695
01:47:49,171 --> 01:47:50,844
Carla, I care about you.

1696
01:47:51,006 --> 01:47:53,475
Carla, don't close
yourself off now.

1697
01:47:53,634 --> 01:47:56,979
It's real important, real important
that you maintain contact

1698
01:47:57,137 --> 01:48:00,391
with at least one person
that really cares about you.

1699
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:05,734
- I don't know what you're saying.
- I'll tell you what I am saying,

1700
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:07,819
that you and I
can make that contact.

1701
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,824
I don't want
to make that contact.

1702
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:17,082
Okay.

1703
01:48:29,336 --> 01:48:32,180
JOE: Hey.
Wait up a minute, will you?

1704
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:34,808
Really.
I want to talk to you.

1705
01:48:34,967 --> 01:48:36,810
I got to hand it to you.

1706
01:48:36,969 --> 01:48:39,392
You just don't give up.

1707
01:48:39,555 --> 01:48:42,354
Look, get out, and stay out.

1708
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:44,894
Okay. Now you listen to me,
Buck Rogers, okay?

1709
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:47,313
If you or your trusty sidekick
harm one hair on her head...

1710
01:48:47,479 --> 01:48:48,947
- Officer.
- I will have your ass in court.

1711
01:48:49,106 --> 01:48:50,983
You're going to be looking
for your ghosts from prison.

1712
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:52,493
Do you hear me?

1713
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:55,495
You see this face?
I don't want to see it again.

1714
01:48:55,654 --> 01:48:57,782
- You got it.
- Hey, Mehan,

1715
01:48:57,948 --> 01:49:00,042
you may have them all fooled,
but not me.

1716
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:02,123
I'm going to nail you
and that little creep.

1717
01:49:03,871 --> 01:49:05,999
I'll tell him.

1718
01:49:06,165 --> 01:49:07,587
Come on. Let's go.

1719
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:09,923
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.

1720
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:15,765
GENE:
Mrs. Moran, we are now going

1721
01:49:15,924 --> 01:49:18,143
to move into
the nighttime mode.

1722
01:49:53,087 --> 01:49:55,681
I want to get it so bad,
I can taste it.
