Yesterday, I went pig hunting

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,253
with my brothers,
Mulla and Tony.

Tony brought his blues guitar.

Mulla brought
his favourite rifle.

There was a strange feeling
in the air.

00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,760

And when I did,
I dreamed bad things.

I woke up in the morning.
Mulla and Tony were gone.

That's not me brother.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,297
Then he come at me.

45

And I just run,
yelling at him to stop.

46

But he just keeps coming!

47
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,719
After a while, I get tired

48
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,798

Took out his legs.

53
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,048
I blew his knee cap off.

54

me son had brain cancer.

Baz?

538
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:50,756
So, what I've been
wondering is...

539
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,085
...how come we're not like them?

540
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,129
How come we never turned?

- What?
- You never read the Bible?

543
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:07,254
Nah, man.
I don't read that shit.

544
00:55:08,917 --> 00:55:13,297
In Revelations, when the third angel
blows his trumpet,

545
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:16,667
a star called Wormwood
falls to the earth

546
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:19,427
bringing a disease
that kills a fuckload of people.

547
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,754
That's pretty much the beginning
of the end, biblically speaking.

548
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,925
When I seen those
meteor showers last night,

549
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:31,426
and then in the morning,

550
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:34,211
all these dead bastards
come running out of the bushes,

551
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:39,211
I figured we were pretty deep into
that final judgment, you know?

552
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:41,343
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

553
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,219
And when the end comes,

554
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,002
all the good folks go upstairs

555
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:48,169
and all the bad folks
go downstairs

556
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:51,007
and there's a bunch of
poor bastards left in the middle.

557
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:54,760
What happens to them?

558
00:55:54,917 --> 00:55:58,467

a trial by fire.

They get tested by God.

560

You reckon
we're being tested right now?

561
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:08,041
Yeah. I reckon we are.

562
