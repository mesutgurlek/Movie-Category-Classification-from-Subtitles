There's someone on the bridge.

- Where?
- I'm not sure where.

- Yes.

- Well, you heard the blowout.
- Yes, I heard the blowout.

- But the first sound I heard was a bang.
- Well, that's some kind of an echo.

No. [ Chuckles ] Look, I know what
an echo sounds like. I'm a sound-man.

And, uh, the bang was before
the blowout. All right?

- What were you doing up there?
- I was recording sounds for a movie I'm working on.

- You recorded the accident?
- Yes.

- What did you do then?

- Well, can I see her?
- She might be asleep. She has been sedated.

- I'll just say good-bye.
- Don't stay too long.

That's him over there.

how we're gonna keep the lid on this guy.

And to the girl too. Where is she?

- All right, she's asleep.

about the governor...

loved to have saved his life too, but, uh --

just say she wasn't here?

C-C-Can't you keep your mouth shut?

It's better the governor died alone.

I mean, I was there, she was there and --

with his hand up some girl's dress?

Or maybe you'd rather
she read it in the papers!

Well, that is what happened.
I mean, that is the truth, isn't it?

292
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,899
Well, what difference
does that make to you...

293
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:23,030

00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,433
- Aah!
- Aah!

449
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,477
- What do you think?
- Keep lookin'.

450
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,771
Keep lookin'?
Hey, Jack, what are you talking about?

451
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,747
- Sorry, Jack. I'm all stacked up.
- Please, just this once, as a favor to me.

452
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,749
All right?

453
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,752
Well, I'll see what I can do,
but you'll have to come back after midnight.

454
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,380
Sally? It's Jack.

455
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,717
See, I-I told you I'd call you.

456
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,052
How 'bout that drink you promised?

457
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,016
Where you going?

458
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,478
Why don't I meet you at the station?

459
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,529
[ Sighs ]

460
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,364
Sally! Hi.

461
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,284
- Hi!
- I'm so glad I caught you.

462
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,370
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah, I was out the door.

463
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,289
Look, I only got 20 minutes.

464
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,125
That's fine. We'll have a quick drink
and you'll be on your way.

465
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,879
Well, I -- I wanna get
a good seat, you know.

466
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,465
Aw, come on, Sally.
You promised me.

467
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:02,135
- Okay, but just 10 minutes.
- Okay, come on. Let me take this.

468
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,803
- Okay. Thanks.
- [ Woman On P.A., Indistinct ]

469
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,513
- How you feelin'?
- Pretty good.

470
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,266
[ Woman On P.A. Continues ]
Stopping at Trenton, Newark, New York...

471
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,895
Rye, Stamford,
New Haven, New London...

472
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,980
Providence and Boston.

473
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,733
Stairway 3, Track 4.

474
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:20,654
Now what's the first thing you see...

475
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,405
when you meet somebody?

476
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,532
Legs. I'm a leg man.

477
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,786
No! [ Laughing ]
Come on!

478
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,996
All right, all right. Face.
You see their face. Right?

479
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,414
- Exactly.
- Okay.

480
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,542
So -- So if your face
doesn't look right...

481
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,837
no one -- I mean no one
is gonna look at you again.

482
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,173
Yeah, but I don't think your face
needs any makeup.

483
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,008
Every face needs makeup!

484
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,678
- But it shouldn't look like makeup.
- Oh, I see.

485
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,680
You see, I've worked on this face.

486
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,474
I've hidden everything
so you don't see the makeup.

487
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,310
You got makeup on right now?

488
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,187
- I do.
- I don't believe it.

489
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,522
- Yeah.
- I don't believe it!

490
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,065
Absolutely.

491
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,651
And you see, this took me two hours.

492
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,653
And this is the no-makeup look.

493
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,656
Really? Well, I would like to see
what the makeup look looks like.

494
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,908
- I bet that's good, huh?
- Well, I --

495
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,869
I only do that for special occasions.

496
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,998
How about a broken nose? How --
How would you deal with a broken nose?

497
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,001
Well, that's easy.
You just take, like, a little --

498
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,004
Wait a minute. Let me see.
I can even show you in here.

499
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,465
- Yeah, like, you get a brush like this, right?
- Yeah?

500
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,135
You take a little brown powder.

501
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,804
- You just kinda make a little brown --
- [ Laughs ] What are you doin'?

502
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,057
Hey, now wait a minute.
This is serious business here.

503
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,435
- You interested or not?
- Oh, yes. Okay. Sorry.

504
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,604
Okay. Make a brown line
and kinda smudge it in right here.

505
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:40,483
It has to be real subtle
so no one notices or anything like that.

506
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,486
But -- what are you smiling about?

507
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,990
Wh -- I-I'm impressed. I'm impressed
that you know so much about this.

508
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,451
- You're not interested in this at all.
- Yes, I am.

509
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,912
No, you're not. You just kept me
sittin' here, talkin' so I'd miss my train.

510
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,914
Wait, now, that's not true, Sally.

511
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,125
- I just didn't want you to go.
- Why?

512
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:00,962
Because I like you, and I just met you,
and you're goin' off on me.

513
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,381
I don't know.
I don't know anything about you.

514
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,551
Well, what do you want to know?
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

515
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,846
All right.
You're a sound-man, right?

516
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,849
- Yeah.
- Okay, how'd you get that job?

517
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,352
That's a good question.
I don't know.

518
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:19,189
[ Laughing ] No, I'll tell you.
All right, it all started in school, okay?

519
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,734
I mean, I was, uh, the kind of kid
who fixed radios...

520
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,653
made my own stereos,
won all the science fairs.

521
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,155
You know the type.

522
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,242
Well, after that I went into the service --
went into the army -- and I refined my skills there.

523
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,577
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

524
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:35,121
- Were you in any wars or anything?
- No, no.

525
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,208
I was such a communication whiz
they wouldn't let me leave New Jersey.

526
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,542
See?

527
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:43,463
Then I went into the police for a while,
and after that I, uh, went into movies.

528
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,257
Wait a minute.
You were a cop?

529
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,219
- No, no. I worked for the Keen Commission.
- What's that?

530
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:53,556
It's just a group of politicians that got together
to try to stop police corruption.

531
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,518
- Oh.
- Then I quit that and, uh --

532
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,562
- Well, what'd you do?
- Well, it's a long story.

533
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,940
- You really don't want to know about it.
- Oh, I do.

534
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,651
I really do.
This is very interesting.

535
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,779
How about movies?
I thought you wanted to know about movies.

536
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,698
Yeah, movies are great,
but I mean, this is --

537
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,410
this is, like, real life
on the streets, you know.

538
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,203
It's exciting.

539
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,540
All right.

540
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,752
I, um -- I wired
their best undercover cop.

541
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,255
Guy by the name of Freddie Corso.

542
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,925
And one of Freddie's cases
was to set up a corrupt police captain...

543
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,010
who was trying
to shake down a mob guy.

544
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:35,265
My job was to rig a wire on him
so I could record the conversation.

545
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,934
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, "wire"?

546
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,937
[ Jack ] Well, it's just a tiny little mike
that's attached to a transmitter...

547
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,022
that I strapped around Freddie's waist.

548
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,320
Mackey, hand me the tape.

549
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,490
Okay, Freddie, give me a sound check.
Count to 10.

550
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:56,536
One, two, three, four, five, six --

551
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,421
[ Jack ] It was a great wire. I mean, it was one of
these deals where you could be blocks away...

552
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,090
and you could hear everything
within 10 feet of him -- Fantastic!

553
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,302
- [ Freddie ] Hey, Milt, how you doin'?
- [ Milt ] Hello, Freddie. How you doin'?

554
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,971
- [ Freddie ] Good to see ya!
- [ Milt ] Nice seein' you. You look good.

555
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,098
[ Freddie ] Yeah, so do you.
You look like a million in that getup.

556
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,349
[ Milt ]
Thank you.

557
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:22,187
[ Freddie ] So, uh, I brought
someone here I want you to meet.

558
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,314
Captain Kennedy, this is Milt.

559
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,774
[ Milt ] Who the fuck
wants to meet Captain Kennedy?

560
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,776
[ Freddie ]
Milt, take it easy.

561
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,029
[ Milt Speaking Italian ]
I don't wanna meet him.

562
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,531
[ Freddie ] Hey, take it easy.
This man could put the cap on everything.

563
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,492
You won't be able to go
to the bathroom alone.

564
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,870
- [ Milt ] All right, come on in the car. We'll take a ride, we'll talk a little.
- [ Freddie ] All right.

565
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:42,373
[ Jack ] And the first thing that the captain
says to the mob guy, he says, uh --

566
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,835
[ Captain ] Look, I understand
that the man has a brother-in-law. Okay?

567
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,546
Now, I happen to see him
talkin' to his brother-in-law.

568
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,841
Now, the brother-in-law
is a known felon, Freddie...

569
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,386
and MiIt's out on parole,
and that's a parole violation.

570
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,389
Now, I'm gonna have to tell
the parole officer. Okay?

571
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,351
If I tell the parole officer,
he's goin' back in the can.

572
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:06,773
But, uh, I think I could work something out
that I don't have to tell him for, uh, 5,000 bucks.

573
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,942
[ Milt ]
$5,000?

574
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:13,029
Freddie, you little prick!
We started this thing for $1,000!

575
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,781
- $1,000?
- Now wait a minute!

576
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,950
[ Jack ] I'm getting this
clear as a bell on tape...

577
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,118
when I start to hear this static.

578
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:23,831
[ Milt ] If you think you're gon -- [ Static ]
the two of ya are outta your -- [ Static ]

579
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,834
- [ Freddie ] We could work this thing out!
- [ Milt ] I mean wha -- [ Static ]

580
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,129
[ Static Continues,
Voices Breaking Up ]

581
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,220
- He's goin' up the river. You understand?
- Right. Right.

582
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:41,391
- You told me -- What's the matter?
- You're sweatin', Freddie. What's the matter?

583
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,143
[ Jack ] The one thing the fuckin' whiz kid
didn't think of...

584
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,479
was maybe that Freddie
would get nervous and sweat.

585
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,482
He was sweating so bad
that the battery in the transmitter...

586
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,484
was shorting out
and burning a hole in him.

587
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,861
Hey, pull over at this gas station.
I gotta take a piss.

588
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:12,589
[ Groaning ]

589
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,097
- Shit.
- What's wrong, Jack?

590
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,932
- The battery's arcing.
- The battery's arcing?

591
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,768
My battery in the transmitter's arcing.

You were supposed to get
some pictures of McRyan, not kill him.

I understood the objectives of the operation.
I never concurred with them.

768

But I didn't kill him.
It was an accident.

You accidentally shot out the tire of his car?

770
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:30,315
As you may recall, this was my initial plan
as proposed in our meeting of June the 6th.

We rejected that plan.

Of course, I do admit I had to exceed
the parameters of my authority somewhat...

773
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:39,700
but I always stayed within
an acceptable margin of error.

774
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:42,202
After all, the objective was achieved.

775
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,996
He was eliminated from the election.

Don't ever call me again.

780
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,088
Just a minute, sir.
We got some loose ends.

781
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:56,300
I changed the tire,
made it look like a blowout.

782
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,720
I erased the sound guy's tape
so everybody will think he's a crackpot.

783
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:02,055
Karp's disappeared, but I'll find him.

one of a series of sex killings in the area.

01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,179
[ Gunshot ]

889
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:01,516
Yeah. That's what I heard,
just before the tire blew out.

890
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,560
You're right. It was a shot.

891
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:05,979
You took this to the police, huh?

892
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:10,275
Yes, I took it to the police, I gave them a copy,
they sent it to the lab, and then it came out blank.

893
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,736
- So somebody's erased it.
- Are you sure?

894
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:17,449
I transferred it myself, I heard it played back,
and now it's blank, like the rest of my tapes.

895
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,826
Okay. Okay. Calm down.

896
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:23,121
Now the sound is very clear.
It's the picture that's a little fuzzy.

897
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:26,666
Shit. Nobody'd believe it. They'd say
I made it up in a lab, and they'd be right.

898
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,877
Well, whosever in on this thing
has contacts with the police...

899
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,962
'cause they want McRyan
to sink without a trace.

900
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,048
They don't want to hear about my gunshot.

901
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,759
- Gee, what are you gonna do?
- What?

902
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:38,386
- What are you gonna do?
- What do you mean, what am I gonna do?

903
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:41,097
- What are we gonna do?
- What do I have to do with this?

904
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:44,726
Will you cut the shit, Sally?
I know what you were doing in that car.

905
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,352
What do you know?

906
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,813
That you and your friend Karp
were setting up McRyan to be blackmailed...

907
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:52,817
getting scummy pictures of you and the candidate
getting laid after the Liberty BalI, right?

908
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:56,112
What'd you do, tell him that running water
under a well-lit bridge gets you hot?

909
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,406
- Who told you that?
- I got a look at your earlier work.

910
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,700
Some motel candid camera shots.

911
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,787
You got nice tits.
Who was paying you to flash 'em for McRyan?

912
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:06,456
I wasn't in the car.
Or haven't you been reading the papers?

913
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,666
How long do you think
Henry's cover-up is gonna last?

914
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,960
I just talked to a reporter
who knows everything.

915
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:15,340
They have erased my tapes, they've made you
disappear, and next it's gonna be me.

916
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,884
- But I'm not disappearing. I'll tell you that.
- Yeah? I am.

917
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:20,678
- Yeah? What makes you think it won't be permanent?
- What's that supposed to mean?

918
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:23,098
Didn't I meet you in a car wreck
10 feet underwater?

919
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:25,350
Yeah, but that was an accident.
Manny wouldn't get me hurt.

920
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,520
- Didn't he get you into the car?
- Yeah, but-but-but he didn't know --

921
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:31,981
Yeah, but he didn't know that the tire
was gonna be shot out. He didn't know that.

922
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,027
- He-He couldn't have.
- Oh, come on, Sally.

923
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:40,365
If I hadn't been there to pull you out of the river,
you'd be dead right now. Don't you get it?

924
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,622
Sit down. Come on.
Sit down. I want to hear everything.

925
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:50,667
Just start right from the top.
Come on.

926
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:53,253
It was just a job like all the others.

927
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:55,630
I get 'em into bed,
and Manny'd get it all on film.

928
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,549
All right. "Them." who's "them"?

929
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,634
I don't know. Husbands. City officials.

930
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:01,678
- Mostly small-town guys.
- Why?

931
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:06,307
- The money.
- Oh, you need the money that bad?

932
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,144
Come on. You know where I work.

933
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:13,690
I get paid to smile my ass off and show
the 27 different color lipsticks they're pushing.

934
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,276
You know how much I make?
Shit is what I make.

935
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:20,155
And I sure as hell can't type,
so it doesn't leave a hell of a lot, you know.

936
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,824
So I did it.

937
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:25,994
I didn't really have to do anything,
like screw 'em or anything.

938
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:27,579
Just make it embarrassing.
I know.

939
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,164
Yeah, right.

940
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:31,124
Anyway, Manny said it served 'em right.

941
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:34,460
I mean, if a guy stuck his hand in the cookie jar,
he deserves to get it cut off.

942
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:36,880
Oh, can't cheat an honest man, right?

943
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:40,508
I guess I wanted to believe it.
Just made it easier.

944
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,595
- You know?
- Okay. McRyan. What about him?

945
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,390
Manny got me into the Liberty Ball.
I went over to McRyan.

946
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:50,602
I told him what a great guy he was,
and he was very hot to show me.

947
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:54,189
So we slipped out the back
and took off in his car.

948
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,524
All right. Now who hired Manny
to take these pictures?

949
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,484
I don't know.

950
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:02,030
Well, don't you think that Manny knew
that his client was planning to shoot out the tire?

951
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:04,032
No.

952
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:08,036
- Well, it wouldn't pay to tell you, now would it?
- Manny wouldn't do that.

953
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,622
- Well, didn't he want to make an extra buck?
- Yeah, right.

954
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:13,791
Yeah, 'cause he's making big bucks
selling them pictures now. What's your cut?

955
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,419
- I got paid.
- Yeah, underpaid probably.

956
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:19,881
- What do you care?
- I'm sick of being fucked by these guys. That's what I care.

957
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:24,219
I mean, look. First Henry gets me to shut up
to preserve the reputation of the great governor...

958
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:28,056
and then I find out instead of getting laid he gets
murdered, and nobody wants to know about it.

959
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,309
I mean, nobody wants to know
about conspiracy. I don't get it.

960
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:35,980
Let me tell you something. All right?
I know what I heard and what I saw.

961
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:39,400
And I'm not gonna stop until everyone in this
fuckin' country hears and sees the same thing.

962
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,402
And you're gonna help me.
Yeah, you.

963
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:44,405
You're gonna find your pal Karp,
and you're gonna get that original film.

964
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,532
'Cause this isn't any good.
I need the original.

965
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:49,410
'Cause if we don't get this out
and on television for everybody to see...

966
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:52,705
they're gonna close the book, and any loose ends
that happen to be hanging out...

967
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,916
like you or me,
are gonna be cut right off.

968
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,086
So you got your choice.
You can be crazy or dead. Either will do.

969
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,255
All right. All right. Look.

970
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:03,549
I'll try and get the film.
Now will you just leave me alone about all this?

971
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:06,094
I wish I was the only one
you had to worry about.

972
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:08,429
You know, if you're trying to scare me,
you're doing a good job.

973
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:12,141
- I am trying to save our asses.
- I'll look after my own ass, thank you.

- Yeah? Like what?

977
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,418
- Here you go.
- How did I end up in that car?

978
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:41,129
Come on. Sit down. Have a seat.
Take a load off your mind.

979
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:44,674
How did I end up in that car
in the bottom of the creek?

980
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:46,467
Well, listen. What do you think?

981
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:49,721
I mean, uh, the guy's driving along,
and all of a sudden he has a blowout.

982
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:53,433
It wasn't a blowout, Manny.
Somebody shot out the tire.

983
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:56,311
Oh, what the hell are you talkin' about, huh?
How do you know that?

984
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:58,813
I know. I know. I just know.

985
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:02,317
- Now, who was it?
- It was nobody.

[ Sighs ]

988

All right. This, uh -- This nut --
He-He calls me a couple of weeks ago...

989
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,829
and, uh, he says he's working
for some candidate --

990
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:19,250
some, uh -- some candidate that's interested
in gettin' McRyan out of the race, huh?

991
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,294
Sounds like a normal joe, right?

992
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:25,506
He says he's heard all about our fine
divorce work, and he offers me six grand.

993
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:28,134
Six? You told me three.

994
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:32,305
Yeah. Well, uh, three before
and-and-and three after.

995
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:35,141
So when were you gonna tell me
about the three after?

996
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:37,894
After I collected it.
When do you think?

997
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:41,272
Yeah. Sure.

998
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,816
Hey. Hey, what's the matter with you?

999
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,778
You think I'm pulling your leg or some --
You don't believe me?

1000
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:52,200
Listen. How was I gonna be sure
that this guy was gonna come through?

1001
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:56,204
l mean, uh, six grand --
that's a lot of money for this kind of a job, huh?

1002
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,456
I'd say he got his money's worth.

1003
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,959
He wasn't supposed to die, for Christ's sake.
He wasn't even supposed to get hurt.

1004
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,544
That was an accident, huh?

1005
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:06,130
You know, I figured it out later.

1006
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:10,468
This nut's idea was to, uh --
to shoot out the tire of McRyan's car...

1007
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:12,428
cause a little crack-up.

1008
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:15,390
- The police show up, they pull him out of the car --
- With me?

1009
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:18,643
Yeah, yeah. With you. And, uh --
And I'd get it all on film.

1010
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:22,230
Some little crack-up.

1011
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:24,690
He wasn't supposed to die.

1012
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:27,735
That part was an accident.
How many times I gotta tell you that?

1013
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:31,239
Manny, we got him killed.

1014
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:34,158
Oh, hey. Wait, wait. "We"?

1015
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,619
What do you mean "we," huh?

1016
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:40,415
We didn't do nothin'. "We"?
I-I -- I was in the woods. You were in the car.

1017
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:43,000
l didn't shoot out no tire.
You didn't either.

1018

none of this, uh -- this conscience shit, huh?

No. He should have called me back.
This isn't right.

I'll give him the tape and the film
and get it over with.

He'd ride the subways at rush hour...

01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:41,281
and he'd stand in the corner real quiet,
so as nobody'd notice him, you know.

01:33:41,365 --> 01:33:43,283
And then they'd pulI into a station...

01:33:43,367 --> 01:33:46,119
and he'd open up his coat,
and he'd pull out this big old meat cleaver...

01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:48,121
and wham, he'd whack 'em
right over the head with it.

and he just disappeared.
