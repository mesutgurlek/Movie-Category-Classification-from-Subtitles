You better go get her
before it gets her.

00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:56,540
You got some kind of an
overactive imagination or something, man?

172
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:00,911
Look, tell you what.

173
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,913
You go on home.

00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,832
I'll talk to you
when I get back.

last night ever come back in here?

181
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,813
What happened?

182
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,314
You get a hold of something
you couldn't handle?

183
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:01,318
Nah, she just ditched
out on me, I guess.

184
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:06,790
We were messing around
out there at Morningside.

186

I know you're not gonna believe
this, but these things were here.

199
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:54,431
Right in the garage,
and they were gonna get me.

Aw, gimme a break, will ya?

201
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,937
They were jumping on the car
and making these weird sounds.

202
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,689
Sure it wasn't that retarded
kid, Timmy, up the street?

203
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,576
No, it was the same thing
that chased me last night.

I didn't tell ya.

After everybody had left,

at a man unless you intend to shoot him.
