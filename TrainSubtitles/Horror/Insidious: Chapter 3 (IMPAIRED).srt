she's going to kill me.

that's attached itself to your daughter.

at Ernesto's tonight, buddy.

840

(WHISPERS) Good night, buddy.

841
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,641
Now what?

842
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:05,406
This entity is very powerful.

843
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,563
It's a spirit who used to
live in this building a long time ago.

844
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,569
It's been alone for a long time.

845
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,764
But she's making it stronger.

846
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,800
It's feeding on her life force.

847
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,925
And wants to possess her?

848
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,620
Usually, entities of this type,
living in the dark,

849
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,500
they want to possess
the bodies of the living

850
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,809
so that they can
leave the dark and return to life.

851
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,927
But there's another kind of a spirit.

852
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,765
It's an even worse kind.

853
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,046
One that does not wanna leave the dark,

854
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,446
that wants the souls of the living
to join it in the shadows.

855
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,169
She's only half a person right now.

856
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,126
After the accident,
it got half her soul.

857
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,491
It needs all of it.

858
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,580
And if we don't hurry,
it's going to get it.

859
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,660
Okay, what do we do now?

860
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,500
To bring all of your daughter back,

861
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,648
I'm going to have to go
to where it lives.

862
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,860
You can record everything,
even in the dark?

863

Yeah, of course. Whatever you need.

I'm the technical part of the team.

865

maybe write it down and try not to talk?

Um... Yeah. Yeah.

who died in this building a few days ago.

977
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,980
Yeah. Grace.
Grace, the neighbor's wife.

978
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:28,460
She's saying something to me.
I can't hear it exactly.

979
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,940
- What is she saying?
- Honey, please!

980
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,420
What book?
Grace, what book?

981

This is it. "Quinn, I wanted you to find
this on the day you graduated."

985
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,020
This is the letter
that Lily hid from Quinn.

986
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,700
She wanted her to find it
on her graduation day.

987
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,580
She tried to get her to read it early.

988
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,660
She was trying to reach Quinn.

989
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,020
Quinn!

990
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,860
Lily, I know you were
trying to reach her.

991
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,611
We know that you wanted her
to read this letter.

992
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,922
Lily, we need you now!

Who?

1001
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,844
Someone else is here with us.

1002
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,650
- Someone who really wants to talk to you.

Mom.

1004
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:41,700
I need to know that this is real.

1005
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,040
(WHISPERS) Okay.

1006
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:51,731
She's saying something
about a stage, an audition.

1007
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:56,362
She says that when you were on stage,
you wanted to know if she was there.

1008
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,925
She was there.

1009
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,481
And she was so proud of you.

1010
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,820
She wants you, and you, Sean,

1011
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,605
to know that you
don't need to look for her anymore.

1012
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:24,082
Because she'll always be with you.
No matter what.

1013
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:28,006
She's gonna be standing
right beside you.

1014
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:30,327
And even though
you can't see her, she's there.

1015
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:37,528
And anytime you're feeling
confused or alone,

this business was too dangerous for you
