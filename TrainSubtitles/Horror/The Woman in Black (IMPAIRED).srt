ARTHUR: Joseph.

506
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,272
If we can get the telegram off now,

507
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,191
we can catch them before
they get on the train.

508
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,157
How could you take me to Eel Marsh?

509
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,754
If even a small part of you feared
the stories were true?

510
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,114
But I never believed them.

511
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,599
No, you didn't want to.

512
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,750
There's a difference. I
had no choice, Arthur.

513
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,149
Either Nicholas is in a better place

514
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,231
waiting for us to be reunited one day,

515
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,548
or he's lost.

516
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,312
Now which would you have
chosen to believe?

517
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,233
Forgive me, Sam, but my son is alive.

518
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,514
He's on his way here.

519

520
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:23,079
The next village is over an hour away.

521
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,197
They'll have left by then.

522
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:32,279
What time is the tide back out?

523
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,351
5:00. Why?

524
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,988
If we can reunite Jennet
Humfrye with her son,

525
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,833
perhaps she'll finally be at peace.

526
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,520
They never recovered the
child's body, Arthur.

527
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,989
But you have something they never had.

Sam, I feel it. It's just
beneath my feet.

534
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:35,396
Just give me a moment while I tie it.

535
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,028
Be careful.

536

there's something I need to do first.

They're lost.
