Well, Mr. Brooks.

00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,131
As long as you're by the door,
you mind hitting the light?

170
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,096
You missed the film, Jack.

171
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:44,233
But don't worry.
Wasn't very interesting.

Mmm!

179
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:08,391
So, just to see if everyone
was paying attention,

180
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:12,995
who can tell me what the symbol
for the element of sodium is, hmm?

181
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,767
- [snaps fingers]
- Yes, Janice.

182
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,569
It's capital N, small A.

183
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,701
Very good.

184
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,905
And, uh, what is sodium?

185
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,538
It's salt.

186
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,346
Well, not exactly.

187
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:31,721
You see, sodium
is actually an alkali metal.

188
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:36,228
Uh, a very interesting fact
about the origin of the name sodium

189
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:41,096
is that it was referred to
as "soda" by the English.

190
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,592
Uh...
[clears throat]

191
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:50,165
Uh, it was isolated in 1807

192
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,678
by Sir Humphry Davy

193
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:58,308
through the electrolysis
of caustic soda.

194
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,411
- Uh, capital N, small A...
- Pay attention.

195
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,479
...comes from the Latin word for...
- You should be taking notes.

196
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,548
...a common sodium compound
- I don't have a pen.

197
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,058
...called natrium.

198
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,389
[huffs]

199
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,124
- Uh, derived from
- You're kidding me.

200
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,533
...the Greek <i>"natron."</i>
- Deal with it.

201
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:22,370
Now, when we combine
chlorine with sodium,

202
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,605
we get what is known
as sodium chloride,

203
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,648
which, of course, we all know as, uh...

204
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,445
- Hmm?
- Table salt.

205
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,884
Very good, Janice. Very good indeed.

206
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:38,617
Now, sodium by itself

207
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,592
can be highly malleable

208
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,595
and reacts explosively with moisture.

209
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:49,395
So, in order to protect the sodium,
we've surrounded it with oil.

210
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,663
Now, I am going to cut off

211
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,898
just a very small piece here.

212
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,464
Uh, no reason to be alarmed.

213
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,533
It's all quite safe.

214
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,602
Yes.

215
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,078
Oh.

216
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,378
Now, as you can see,

217
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,250
even with the minute amount
of moisture in the air,

218
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,290
the sodium is already reacting.

219
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,792
When I put it in this dish of water,

220
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,159
it should react violently.

221
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,697
Cool.

222

molecular deconstruction.

225
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,615

00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,067
And you were supposed to be
my ride here.

228
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,729
You specifically said last Thursday...
Thursday...

229
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,704
that you wouldn't do that anymore.

230
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,640
I know. I just...
I got caught up in things. I'm sorry.

231
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,769
You know, maybe you should just
try balancing your life, okay?

232
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,473
And call me if you're
not gonna pick me up.

233
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,777
I had to get my dad to drive me
for the second time this week.

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,841
Do you know
how embarrassing that is?

235
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,408
All right.
I said I'm sorry, you know?

236
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:17,717
I don't wanna hear it.
Just drive me home now, okay?

237
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,818
God damn, this stuff is so fascinating.

238
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,089
Eve, babe, what'd I tell you?

239
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,825
You gotta come by my place
sometime and smoke hash, you know?

240
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,390
Let our souls dive into the stuff.

241
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,060
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

242
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,730
Yeah! I-I'm there.

243
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,775
Listen... Whoa, buddy.
Buddy, I can't help but notice

244
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,606
you're having a tough time
getting to class on time.

245
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,873
I happen to type up
all my notes on my laptop,

246
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:45,906
so if you wanna catch up,
you let me know, I'll burn you a disk.

247
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,475
What do you think?

248
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,748
No, I'm cool, man.
Thanks. Thanks for the offer.

249
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,848
Dude, don't be shy.
Why's he getting shy? Don't get shy.

250
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,086
- I'm not being shy.
- You're getting all shy.

251
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,287
I'm not, all right?
I'm not getting shy. I'm okay.

252
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,354
- I just don't want your...
- Mr. Brooks, may I have

253
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,864
a moment with you, please?

254
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,766
Ohh! Detention time.
You better go.

255
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,203
Jack, are you kidding me? I have to
work out with my sister in 20 minutes.

256
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,207
What do you want me to do?
He wants to talk to me.

257
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,765
Dude... Dude,
keep your cool head on.

258
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,403
I'll give her a lift.
I'm taking off right now anyway.

259
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,640
- No way!
- Uh, yeah way.

260
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,272
Perfect! Um, okay.

261
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,976
Well, I'll, um...

262
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,541
I don't know.
I'll call you later, Jack.

263
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,086
You better go.

264
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,621
So you work out.

265
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:24,781
You know, sometimes.

266
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,020
Sometimes.
Like, how many times a week?

267
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,325
That's it. That's it.

268
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,263
That's it. That's gotta be it.

[teacher muttering]

270
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,771
Uh, Jack... Jack, how are you?

271
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,433
I'm good, you know. How are you doing?

272
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:47,309
Uh... Uh, great. Spectacular.

273
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,507
Hey, you just barely
made it today, didn't you?

274
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:51,913
Yeah, you know, I'm sorry. I just...

275
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,748
I got caught up with things,
and I didn't expect to be that late.

00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,878
So...

277
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,150
You must be a pretty
busy guy, then, huh?

278
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,622
Not really.

279
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,321
Jack, uh, I noticed your van
out in the parking lot.

280
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,124
You're a plumber, right?

281
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,357
Yeah.

282
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,401
Well, uh, I'm having
this problem with my pipes.

283
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,437
I was wondering if perhaps
you could, uh, stop by my place

284
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,734
and, uh, take a look.

285
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,866
Sure. Yeah. When?

286
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,103
[chuckles]
Well, the sooner, the better.

287
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,874
Pipes are driving me nuts.

288
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,472
- I'll come by tonight, if you like.
- Oh, that'd be great. Great.

289
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,484
Listen, I'm about
a 20-minute drive from here.

290
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,419
Number 12 Watson Road.
Just past the old quarry trail.

291
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,853
You think you can find it?

292
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,891
Number 12 Watson Road.
Yeah, I got it.

293
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,324
[snaps fingers]
Thanks. Thank you very much.

294
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,988
I really appreciate it.
I'll see you later, Jack.

295
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,947
[animal howling]

296
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,779
Jack! Oh, am I glad to see you!

297
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,546
Come on in.

298
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,749
- So, this is it.
- [dog barking]

299
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,920
Totally secluded. No distractions.

300
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,055
- [barking continues]
- Just me and Waldo here.

301
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,861
Slowly getting around
to fixing the place up.

302
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:53,937
Well, it looks like it, uh,
certainly has potential.

303
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,339
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

304
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,743
Got the place real cheap, too.

305
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:04,647
Apparently, the old house
has some pretty nasty history.

306
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:08,743
Something about some crazy guy
that lived here way back in the day.

307
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,812
But, hell, I couldn't pass on the price.

308
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,517
You know what I mean?
Watch that first step.

309
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,496
So, anyway,
I figured I need a substance

310
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,862
that would promote coagulation

311
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,266
of the dispersed
colloidal contaminant.

312
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:28,363
So I purchased myself
a bottle of suitable flocculant,

313
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,635
and I went to town.

314
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,438
Yeah, like, uh, Draino.

315
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,775
Hmm. Liquid-Plumr.

316
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,678
[water bubbles]

317
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:41,617
Anyway, I-I-I discovered
a reduction in hydrocarbons,

318
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:45,020
which obviously resulted in
the formation of carbon residue.

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,251
- Yeah, well, you know... I mean, it...
- [bubbling continues]

320
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,157
It looks to me like
your main line is clogged.

321
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,287
Uh, main line, huh?

322
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:55,231
You see, uh, this pipe here
runs all the way out to a well.

323
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,198
Probably in your backyard.

324
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,293
With the pump
being shut off for so long,

325
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,668
you probably just built up
some rust on the insides.

326
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:04,140
- Rust, huh?
- It's typical of an older place like this.

327
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,575
So just a simple clogging, huh?

328
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,239
- Yeah. I mean, that's the way I see it.
- Hmm.

329
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,044
Look, uh, this
might actually take a bit,

330
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,449
so, uh, why don't you
go ahead upstairs?

331
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,249
And I'll do my best to fix it up.

332
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,619
And I'll call up on you
when I need you to try the sink.

333
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,490
Oh. Sure.

334
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,051
Uh, whatever you say, Jack.

335
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,393
You're the professional.
[chuckles]

336
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,229
I'll, uh... I'll just go upstairs.

337
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,270

all cleaned out down here!

Are you all right?

365
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,727
Jeez! Something zinged you
real good there.

366
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,235
Yeah, this goddamn valve blew

367
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,464
and popped me right in the head.

368
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,097
Here.

These pipes must be clogged
all over the place.

00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,375
Your pressure switch shorted
along with your switch box,

372
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,212
and looks like I'm going to have to get
a replacement for this valve now.

for a couple more days here.

00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,022
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, it's not like I got much choice.

376
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,423
Listen, I'm terribly sorry
about this, Jack,

377
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,257
but every step is progress.

378
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,890
I-I mean, at... at least you found
the heart of the problem, right?

379
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,957
Yeah, I guess.

380
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,596
Uh, what do I owe you
for the visit?

381
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,367
Nah, don't worry about it.
It's all right.

382
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,408
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, I insist.

383
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,502
Nah, it's all right. You know,
I'm not gonna charge my teacher.

00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,571
How else am I supposed
to get an A in your class, right?

But, uh,

413
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:09,700
I can't tell if it's that or,
you know, if I hate myself.

417
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,968
about just busting in here
the other day and being a total dick.

I just... Look, I appreciate the things
that you're doing for me.

So, you know, are you just gonna,
like, fix these problems

that I have somehow,
because I'm-I'm dying here, man.

Look, Jack,

00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,557
your anger comes out
very sporadically, very intense.

423

Maybe... just maybe...

424
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,660
you need to try to find
a method of relaxing.

I don't need to relax, all right?

how do I start relaxing?

437
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,452
Well, there are a lot of ways.

438
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,687
You could try meditation.

439
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,663
A lot of people find that that is

440
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,360
a way to control their emotions,
or you could try...

441
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,527
You could try playing a sport.

442
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,595
You know, that... that would get
your mind off of things.

443
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:25,040
You could try Tai Chi
or yoga or... or Pilates

444
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,045
or Yogalates,
which is like a fusion of the two.

445
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,745
Yeah, you know, maybe...
maybe the next time, uh,

446
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,808
some asshole cuts me off
on the highway,

447
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,354
I'll pull over, and I'll meditate.

448
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,356
Or maybe I'll just
join a badminton team,

449
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,086
and that'll make me stop, uh,
you know, headbutting people.

450
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,923
Or maybe the best thing is,
I can, uh...

451
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,826
I can pick up
some gay exercise tape,

452
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,626
and I can spend the night
with my sweet pea,

Right there.

480
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,781
Well, I'll be.

[barks]

482
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,305
Relax, boy.

483
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:24,102
There's nothing to be afraid of here.

484
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,309
Incredible.

Excuse me.

[snoring continues]

[clearing throat]

504
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,235
What can I do you for, boy?

505
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,714
I was hoping to get
a replacement for this valve.

506
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:15,241
I'll be a son of a bitch.

507
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,310
That's an Ironmaster.

508
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,661
One...

509
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:30,100
Two hundred.

510
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,633
I ain't seen one of them in,

511
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,195
oh, well,

512
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,970
uh, a hell of a long time.

513
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,569
I'll have to order one
in for you special.

514
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,979
It should be in tomorrow.

515
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,676
Say...

516
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,619
where you been plumbing, boy?

517
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:56,786
Uh, it's this, uh, big, old place
up on top of Watson Road.

518
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,128
Boy...

519
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,104
I'll tell you.

520
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:10,402
You don't want to go
messing around up there.

521
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,965
No, sir.

522
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,705
Bad idea.

523
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,543
That place is cursed.

524
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:21,312
All right.
What are you talking about?

525
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,546
Let me ask you this.

526
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,583
Do you believe in monsters, boy?

527
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,324
I don't got all day, Howard.

528
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,859
I'll tell you what.

529
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:41,063
Why don't you come on by
tomorrow evening

530
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,505
when things are quieter?

531
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,771
I'll have your valve by then.

532
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:51,076
Maybe I'll fill you in on the legend
on that cursed old place.

533
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,439
Next.

534
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:04,820
[burp]

535
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,568
Oh. Perfect. I want to talk
to you about something.

536
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,074
- Okay.
- Okay. Saturday night,

537
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,338
Jen's having a party.
I don't know how I feel about that,

538
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,572
but are you going?

539
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,910
[Girl]
I don't know. I don't really like Jen.

540
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,348
Neither do I. But I think
I'm gonna need a car.

541
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:01,407
Do you have yours?

542
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,316
[Girl]
Yeah. I think I can get mine, yeah.

543
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,755
And Friday night, um...

544
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,325
Oh, shit.

I think it's broken.

548
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,760
Oh, whatever. I don't care.

549
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,497
I really never use it anyway.

550
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,666
[chuckles]
I'm... I'm really just here for the credit.

551
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,175
[chuckles]
Well, you got me beat.

552
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,677
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

[chuckles]

554
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,517
So, uh...

555
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,746
this class is pretty lame, isn't it?

556
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,254
Yeah, I guess it is.

Sick. Sick, sick.

Just... sick. A little.

A little. A little sick. Lesson time.

A little sick. It's time for the lesson.

You're just like me.
You care about people.

00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,472
There's nothing you can do
about it. That's just...

593
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,412
It's the way we are, right?

Yeah!

595
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,777
You know, you're right.
You're right.

596
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,081
I know.
You get me.

I get you.
Eve.

Let's go.

Okay. Jack, I'm just
going to finish my cigarette.

Yeah.

00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,489
All right. Whatever.
I'll just wait in the van.

602

- See?
- Hold on. Hold on.

Hey. Hey, bro. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

604

Hold on a sec, bro.

605

Come on, man.
Why are you being like this?

What are you talking about?

608
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,878
Come on. Look at her.

609
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,310
Huh?

610
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,211
Look at what you're doing to her.

611
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,216
I mean, it's happening
right in front of you,

612
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,945
and you're not seeing it.

613
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,544
She is not okay.

614
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,283
I can tell when people aren't okay.

615
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,847
Are you listening to me?

616
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,860
Yeah. You are not okay.

617
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,691
It's making her not okay.
And you know what?

618
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,355
I think it's making me a little not okay,

619
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,060
and it's not okay, okay?

620
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,034
[chuckles]
Yeah.

621
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,571
All right. Okay. Yeah. Good talk.

622
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,799
Yeah.

623
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:43,862
So that's how it's gonna be?

624
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,499
You're j... You're gonna
walk away from me?

625
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,237
You are walking away from someone...

626
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,211
- Look, I'm trying to... Whoa!
- Take your hand off me, guy.

627
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,679
I'm just trying to help you relax.

628
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:51,976
Can you relax?

629
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:53,607
See, you gotta relax.

630
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:56,380
And maybe smoke some nice stuff,
right?

631
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,615
[snickers]
Look, Eve, can we get out of here?

632
00:40:58,689 --> 00:40:59,883
All right, this guy's a clown.

633
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,117
No. Eve. Eve, I'm not a clown.

634
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:02,318
Eve, you're staying right there.

635
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:06,989
Dude, she not going anywhere
until you calm down.

636
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,088
- Okay?
- All right, look,

637
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,996
you get out of my face.
Okay? You don't know me.

638
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,194
Jake, I know you. We know each other.

639
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,759
- It's "Jack."
- Jake,

640
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,635
calm down. Okay?

641
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,640
Hey. Big guy.

642
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:20,176
You just need to smoke
some hashish... Ooh!

643
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,609
Jack!

644
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,379
You're a monster!
What the hell is wrong with you?

Yeah? What's that?

I was thinking probably Brazil.

Why Brazil?

691
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,225
I don't know. I mean,
you know, it's far away.

694
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:57,556
Well. If you want to go really far away,
why don't you go to, uh, Australia?

I don't want to go to Australia.

696
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,539
All right, I know this guy that went there,
and he said it sucked.

697
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,371
So, you know,
why would I want to go there?

698
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:07,933
So you think by going to Brazil

699
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,537
you're gonna get away
from all your problems.

700
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:12,775
I didn't say that.
You know, I just figured

701
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,216
maybe a change of scenery
would be good.

702
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:16,377
Forget it.

00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,555
Look, Jack,

704
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:27,392
I know this is
a touchy subject for you.

705
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,062
But it really might help us
if we can at least

706
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:33,433
talk about the death of your family.

707
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,766
No.

708
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,398
All right? I told you.
I don't want to talk about that.

709
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,908
It's not healthy to ignore your past.

710
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,605
What do you remember?

711
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,711
Anything else.

712
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,288
You know, I used to
tell people what I saw.

713
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,328
And everyone just thought I was nuts.

714
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,197
So now I don't even know
what I believe anymore.

715
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:09,533
All I know is that my family's dead.

716
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:12,932
And I ran away.

717
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,140
Of course you ran away.
You were just a kid. Right?

718
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,412
Yeah, but I should've stayed.
You know. I could've done something.

719
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:22,679
What would you have done?

720
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,244
I don't know! All right.
But anything would've been better

721
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:26,949
than just running away like a little pussy!

722
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:28,982
Well, Jack...

723
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:32,119
I think we hit the nail on the head.

724
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:36,691
You see, sometimes
our anger and frustration

725
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,292
are cause by very real
and inescapable problems

726
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,631
that occur in our lives.

727
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:43,696
You ran away from something
you couldn't do anything about.

728
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,605
And now you hate yourself for it.

729
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,007
I know it's tough.

730
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,276
But at some point, you're gonna
have to confront that memory.

731
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:55,409
And you're gonna
have to try to find a way

732
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:57,078
and to forgive yourself.
