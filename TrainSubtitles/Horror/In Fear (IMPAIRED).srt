me up at the bar.

Yeah, so I was thinking
there was this festival

this weekend in Ireland
that I'm going to,

okay, I'll call later, actually.

about this weekend,

It's not like a date or anything.

a whole bunch of us camping.

00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:44,161
- What?
- Did you do this to me?

482
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:46,330
- He didn't do that to you.
- No, we were in the car.

483
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:48,132
Yeah, we were in the car.
We stopped.

484
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:49,967
I'm not talking about
when you knocked me over.

485
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:52,369
Talking about in that woods.
Did you drag me into that clearing,

486
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,004
and did you do this to me
with a knife?

487
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:56,840
- LUCY: No. We got attacked too.
- When? When?

488
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:58,542
Just before.

489
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:01,378
They're still out there, man.
They're out there now.

490
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:04,214
- We need to go now.
- Fuck. Tom, get in.

491
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:06,784
Hold on. Where...
how... where are you from?

492
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:08,786
- I'm from around here.
- LUCY: Get in the car.

493
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:10,387
I got attacked.
We need to get out of here now.

494
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:12,289
They're going to be looking for us.
We need to go now.

495
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:15,392
- We need to get out of here now.
- Okay, Tom. Tom. Tom!

496
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:18,596
- Please just get in the car.
- Do you want this to happen to you?

497
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:21,097
Do you want it to happen to her?
We need to go now.

498
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,234
- Tom. Tom, get in. Tom!
- I'm serious.

499
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,736
MAN: Can we go?
I don't care if you take me

500
00:43:25,737 --> 00:43:28,372
a mile down the road, even less.
Just get me out of here.

501
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:29,673
Drive.
We can talk about this later.

502
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:31,642
Please, can we just
get out of here now?

503
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,510
We need to go now.

504
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:35,145
- Can we go now?
- Tom, please.

505
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:37,613
Can we go now, please?

506
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:23,661
Listen... thank you.

507
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:26,163
I know you hit me and everything,

508
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:29,766
but if you guys hadn't come
around that corner there...

509
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:34,705
Ah, Jesus.

510
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:37,775
(MAN GROANING)

511
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:41,278
- LUCY: You need a doctor.
- Ah, don't worry about me.

512
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:43,881
I'm sure the car
took the most of it.

513
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:45,381
(MAN GROANS)

514
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,520
Did you see who attacked you?

515
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:51,522
I'm not quite sure. I'll be honest.

516
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,924
Could be a group of guys.

517
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:56,460
They drink at the local pub.

518
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:58,861
They're not right in the head.
I mean...

519
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,831
I don't understand what's going on.

520
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,003
I'm Max, by the way.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your names.

521
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,273
I'm Lucy.

522
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,575
- I'm Tom.
- MAX: Tom.

523
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,490
(MAX GASPS)

524
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,227
So are you... I forgot your name.

525
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,730
Linda? Lucy, is it?

526
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:33,997
Lucy.

527
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:35,933
Wanna do me a favor and just

528
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:38,034
tilt the mirror down there
just over here?

529
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,636
Just want to check something.

530
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,407
Just want to check my face.

531
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:49,246
Oh, Jesus. Is it bad? Is it bad?

532
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,613
TOM: No, it's not that bad.

533
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,284
Oh, that's even worse
than I thought it was.

534
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:56,452
That's a lot of blood.

535
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:58,655
We better get going.

536
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:01,125
There's a hotel not far from here.

537
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:03,827
- Yeah, Kilairney House Hotel.
- Kilairney House Hotel, yeah.

538
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:05,529
TOM: We just went past the sign.

539
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,465
MAX: We'll be able to get a
doctor from there or something.

540
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:09,732
Jesus, I...

541
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,837
I think I need to lie down.
Is that okay?

542
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:15,372
- TOM: What?
- Is it okay if I just lie down a bit?

543
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:17,241
TOM: Yeah. Yeah.

544
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:18,842
Do you know where we're
going, though, don't you?

545
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:20,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just go straight.

546
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:21,744
If you follow the signs...

547
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:49,173
- TOM: Max.
- Yeah?

548
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:52,074
- There's a sign there.
- Yeah, just follow it.

549
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,948
So are you guys a couple, or...?

550
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,219
No.

551
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:08,125
Yeah, we're going to a festival.
Just stopping off.

552
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:11,060
- Where's the festival?
- Eh, not too far.

553
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,499
Why are you staying
in the hotel, then?

554
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,407
It's none of my business,
anyway. I'm sorry.

555
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,715
You been drinking, Tom?

556
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:32,848
No.

557
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,057
(MAX LAUGHS)
No wonder you didn't see me.

558
00:47:40,058 --> 00:47:41,590
(LAUGHS)

559
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:48,130
I'm not giving you a hard
time, Tom. I'm just...

560
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,568
(GROANS)

561
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,176
TOM: Uh...

562
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:01,877
hey, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

563
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,150
Fucking sitting ducks here.
Go, go, go!

564
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:08,619
- Go back? Go back? Go back?
- No, go through.

565
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,654
- Go back?
- Go through it!

566
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:11,755
Tom, go through it!

567
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:13,090
- Go through. Don't stop.
- LUCY: No!

568
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,590
- Tom!
- Don't stop. Go through it.

569
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,197
I know who they are.

570
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:22,264
Butchers and hunters,
the lot of them.

571
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,636
- (GASPS)
- (SQUEAKING)

572
00:48:25,637 --> 00:48:27,638
MAX: Fuck's sake, Tom.

573
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:31,040
Just going to leave 'em there, Tom?
Fucking get rid of 'em.

574
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,346
I'll tell you who they are, and I
know exactly why they're after me.

575
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:38,782
- LUCY: Why?
- Ah, bad blood.

576
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:40,784
Been going on for years.

577
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:42,251
There's this one guy...

578
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:47,356
he'll be out there right now.
He's the ringleader.

579
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,026
When he was a kid...

580
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,931
took a notion to hide in the ditch
and wait for a car to come,

581
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:55,799
and just when it was approaching,

582
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,068
he stepped out in front of it
just to see what would happen.

583
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:04,474
Now, the driver hardly had time to brake.
I'm sure they tried.

584
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:07,576
But to avoid hitting the kid,
they swerved off the road...

585
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:13,315
crashed the car.
Driver was killed instantly.

586
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,727
Have we been here?

587
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,763
- Huh?
- Have we been here?

588
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,972
Why'd you bring us back here, Tom?

589
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:37,374
This is the last place
in the world I want to be.

590
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:40,177
You've told me you knew these roads.
Why are you blaming me?

591
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:41,678
There's no blame here, Tom.

592
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,246
I'm just trying
to figure out what happened.

593
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:45,615
I've been lying down here in
the back, bleeding to death

594
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:46,750
after you hit me with the car.

595
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,185
It's not why you're bleeding.

596
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:51,221
I mean, I'm not all
there right now.

597
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:53,490
I mean, my head's
been fucking cut open.

598
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,092
I got... you knocked me down.
I mean...

599
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,895
look, you don't
know the way, but I do.

600
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,135
Which way?

601
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:08,404
Go straight ahead, first right.

602
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,120
Yeah, right. Right, Tom.

603
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:36,198
Left. Go left.

604
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:45,508
Just keep going straight, Tom.

605
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,584
Left.

606
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:19,942
How the fuck did we come...?

607
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:24,581
They'll still be out there.
I thought they would have

608
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,016
given up by now and gone home.

609
00:51:26,017 --> 00:51:28,285
They've changed the signs around.

610
00:51:28,286 --> 00:51:31,121
Follow any of the signs, you'll come
back to exactly where you started.

611
00:51:31,122 --> 00:51:33,857
You brought us here.
I followed your directions.

612
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:35,192
You did this.

613
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:37,059
What did you do to piss them off?

614
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:39,463
What?

615
00:51:39,464 --> 00:51:41,498
You must have done something.
Something's happened.

616
00:51:41,499 --> 00:51:42,732
Now, what happened?

617
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,034
- We haven't done anything.
- What happened?

618
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:45,802
We haven't done anything.

619
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:49,339
- Did you provoke them?
- No, we didn't provoke anyone.

620
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,608
Nah, something's happened.
What's happened?

621
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,809
Nothing fucking happened.

622
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:57,780
What about the pub?

623
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,189
- What happened in the pub? Did...
- Nothing happened in the pub.

624
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,424
Did you say something to them?

625
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:09,326
Nothing happened in the pub,
all right? Leave it.

626
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:13,063
- Well, clearly something did.
- No, nothing happened in the pub.

627
00:52:13,064 --> 00:52:15,799
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

628
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,135
Lucy, what happened in the pub?

629
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:19,936
- Someone...
- Did you say something to them?

630
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:22,472
No, I didn't say anything to them.
Nothing happened in the pub.

631
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,241
So what? Now, clearly
something happened.

632
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:25,575
Tell him, Tom.

633
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:29,279
Why are we having... why are we
having this conversation? Huh?

634
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,548
- You said something, didn't you?
- Tom, please.

635
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:33,349
Lucy, tell me what happened.

636
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,119
Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.

637
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,156
You provoked 'em, Tom.
Tom, what happened in the pub?

638
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:40,624
Nothing happened in the pub.

639
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:42,058
Then, why don't you want Lucy
to say anything?

640
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:45,529
When it's going to be something
that's really stupid

641
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,798
- that you're going to be saying!
- What? I'm not saying anything...

642
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:50,267
- (YELLS)
- MAX: Tom!

643
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:51,689
- Tom!
- Tom, where are you going?

644
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,946
(SIGHING)

645
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,351
Wow.

646
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,653
Really exploring his
maleness there.

647
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:13,522
Is he always like that?

648
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:17,359
- We only met two weeks ago.
- Oh.

649
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,366
Well, he did piss off
those men in the pub.

650
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:26,903
They took offense, which is why
they're doing all this, of course.

651
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:29,406
You were in the pub?

652
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:32,408
I didn't say it earlier, 'cause I
didn't want to alarm anybody...

653
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,512
but I saw Tom,

654
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:37,581
and Tom spilled this man's pint.

655
00:53:37,582 --> 00:53:39,849
No.

656
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,651
No, no, no, no.
It was the other way around.

657
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:43,787
No.

658
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:46,022
Tom spilled a pint,

659
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:47,724
and he was refusing
to buy another one

660
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:52,261
until the man got real nasty
with your friend back there.

661
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,198
Tom's not like that.

662
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:57,667
He wouldn't...
he bought everyone a round.

663
00:53:57,668 --> 00:53:59,469
We joked about it.

664
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,237
Yeah, I know it's confusing.

665
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:10,112
Christ, this pain is getting worse.

666
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:14,351
You wouldn't have any water
on you, would you?

667
00:54:14,352 --> 00:54:16,652
Yeah, by your feet.

668
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,656
Lucy, could you...?

669
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:42,245
Thanks.

670
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:44,246
It's fine.

671
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,784
Couldn't open it for me, could you?

672
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:20,917
MAX: You feel better, Tom?

673
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:22,785
Do you want me to drive?

674
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:31,093
No.

675
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,004
I know where we are now.

676
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:45,073
I can get us out.

677
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,510
So let's go.

678
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:37,025
My... my head's
starting to bleed again.

679
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:40,430
Would you have
a handkerchief or something?

680
00:56:40,431 --> 00:56:41,965
I don't want to bleed
all over your seats.

681
00:56:41,966 --> 00:56:43,266
No, I haven't.

682
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:44,801
Oh, you wouldn't
check the glove box?

683
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:48,270
It's just that I don't want to
ruin all of your upholstery.

684
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,453
What's that, Lucy?

685
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,858
LUCY: It's a fire hazard warning.

686
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:11,161
Where'd you get that?

687
00:57:11,162 --> 00:57:13,062
Tom threw it out the window.

688
00:57:13,063 --> 00:57:15,664
Huh. That's strange.

689
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:19,334
LUCY:
Did you cut your own face, Max?

690
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,540
You took my clothes,
pulled my hair.

691
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:25,408
- I did it all.
- You dragged me out of the car.

692
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:27,043
I cut the tree.

693
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:29,811
I even wrote on the fucking wall.

Where are we going?

the back of her fucking skull.

Lucy, go on, tell him.
Can you feel that, Lucy?

704
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:54,571
- I can feel it.
- There you go.

705
00:57:54,572 --> 00:57:56,706
- Faster, Tom.
- I can't go any faster.

You're not trying, Tom.

- MAX: Look at the road, Tom.

- I can't go any faster.
- Yes, you can. You can.

710
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:11,688
I can't go any faster,
or else I'll crash the car.

You make that choice.
Do you want to crash the car,

or do you want Lucy to die?
You can do it.
