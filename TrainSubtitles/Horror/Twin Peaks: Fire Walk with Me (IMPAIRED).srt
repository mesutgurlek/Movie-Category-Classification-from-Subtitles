one hand in her pocket,

52

<i>which means they were
hiding something,</i>

made into a fist,

No.

No, I do not.

Her left arm.

It was numb.

I doubt it was a drug problem.

209
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,881
It was probably a nerve problem.

210
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,179
I could recheck the
arm for injuries,

211

but I'd have to take the body back to

it was and who stayed in it?
