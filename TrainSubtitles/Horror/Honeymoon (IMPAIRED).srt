[ cans clattering ]
[ music playing ]

2
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,622
I guess I'm
the first one to do this.

3
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:22,755
Well, I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to say.

4
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,527
I'm now a wife.

5
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,030
MAN: Okay,
wedding video.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,202
Let me introduce you
to our delicious food.

7
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,071
We got veggie korma,

8
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:39,438
lamb curry, samosas.

9
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:43,342
WOMAN: Oh, I am sitting
inside a tent of sorts,

10
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,747
because it is
inside a tent

11
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:48,047
similar to this one
where you proposed.

12
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,718
For our first date,

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,787
Bea chose
an Indian restaurant,

14
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:58,057
you know, one of
those little places
on Sixth Street

15
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,494
with the colored lights
and the fiber-optic lamps.

16
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:04,597
Yum, except that
halfway through the meal,

17
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,832
I start feeling
my stomach gurgle

18
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,368
in this horrible
food-poisoning-type way,

19
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,470
and I didn't even
have time to lie to her.

20
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,006
I spend 20 minutes
in the dirty
restaurant toilet

21
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,842
and the rest of the night
on Bea's bathroom floor,

22
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,478
because I couldn't make it
to the subway,

23
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,479
let alone Brooklyn.

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,647
Well, we'd been planning

25
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,482
on going camping upstate
for weeks,

26
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:23,716
but, as you know,
I got sick,

27
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,255
so we couldn't go.

28
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,324
I thought you were upset,

29
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,393
because you were
acting really weird,

30
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:34,994
but then you--you built,
like, this tent

31
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,267
over our bed
out of blankets,

32
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,602
and we made s'mores
on the stove,

33
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,805
and then inside the fort
on our bed,

34
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,440
you said, "Bea, this was
supposed to be romantic

35
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,477
"and under the stars,
not sheets,

36
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,416
"but you make me
the happiest.

37
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,885
Will you marry me?"

38
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,354
[ sighs ]

39
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:02,655
And now we're married.

40
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,525
So this, this is our,
"Fuck you, Indian food."

41
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,199
You tried
to keep us apart,

42
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,269
but fuck you.

43
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,571
We win.

44
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,941
So we didn't get
a regular wedding cake.

45
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:25,378
We decided on something
that was special
for us instead.

46
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,313
Mm-hmm, special

47
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,914
and cheap.
What?

48
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:29,749
BEA: No,
I think some people

49
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,752
are annoyed by no cake.

50
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,654
Who cares?

51
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,288
It's our wedding,

52
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,690
huh?

53
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,025
Before, I was alone,

54
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,029
but now I'm not.

55
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,741
I love you,
honeybee.

Whew.

60
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,697
It's not fancy.

61
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,200
Is it okay?

62
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,902
Do you like it?

63
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,370

64
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,375

Mm-hmm. I just want
it to be perfect.

68
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,382
And I just want
to be with you.

69
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,917
Blehh!

All right, come on.

71
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,222
So this is the famous

72
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,838
Mm.
Wait, wait, wait.

What? What? What? What?
Not so fast, okay?

74
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,541
First,
the grand tour.

75
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,977
So this is
the living room.

76
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:05,978
Watch your step.

77
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,514
You may notice
a slight tilt.

Uh-huh. This is
definitely unsafe.

Oh, yeah?
Well, you're unsafe.

You're unsafe.
You're unsafe.

and VCR from 1991.

a radioactive microwave

and an oven that probably
still uses hot coals.
