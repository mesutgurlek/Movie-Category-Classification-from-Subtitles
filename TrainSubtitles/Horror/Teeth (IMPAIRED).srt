1
00:01:48,257 --> 00:01:49,357
BILL: Hey, Brad!

2
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:51,408
Don't splash your sister.

3
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,759
She ain't my sister!

4
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,760
Well, it's my sincere hope
that she will be.

5
00:01:57,258 --> 00:01:58,339
BRAD: No!

6
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,781
Hey, try to be friends, okay?

7
00:02:00,861 --> 00:02:02,584
No, goddamn it!

8
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:04,345
- Hey!
- Bill.

9
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:07,389
Just...

10
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,430
cut him some slack.

11
00:02:26,888 --> 00:02:28,809
Let's see yours now.

12
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:35,537
Kim.

13
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:39,502
BRAD: Ow! Ow.

14
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:41,384
- Son?
- Ow!

15
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:43,185
What's wrong?

16
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:44,227
What happened?

17
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:45,347
KIM: Brad?

18
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:47,669
Bill, what is--

19
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:48,871
BILL: What is it?

20
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,432
Let me see.

21
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:52,235
KIM: Show your dad.

22
00:02:52,314 --> 00:02:53,596
Let me see it.

23
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:58,361
BILL: Oh!

24
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:00,003
KIM: Oh, God.

25
00:03:01,524 --> 00:03:03,285
Aw, that doesn't look good.

26
00:03:04,287 --> 00:03:07,769
KIM: Dawn, honey, are you okay?

27
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,212
BILL: Dawn, you all right?

28
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:10,532
KIM: Dawn?

29
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:12,655
Dawn?

30
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,156
We have a gift...

31
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,641
a very precious gift.

32
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:59,045
And... what do you do with gifts?

33
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:03,489
Do you go around giving them
to everyone you pass on the street?

34
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,132
ALL: No!

35
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:07,374
No, those wouldn't be gifts.

36
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:11,338
They'd be, like, a handout.

37
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,379
(assorted chuckles)

38
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:19,066
So... what about
the most precious gift of all?

39
00:05:19,146 --> 00:05:21,068
Are you gonna give that

40
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:25,513
to the first guy who buys you
a big bunch of roses?

41
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,394
GIRLS: No way!

42
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:29,917
No way?

43
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,081
- And, um...
- (mike feedback)

44
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:38,005
I'm not just talking to the, uh, girls.

45
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:39,087
You guys...

46
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:42,770
you have the same gift to give.

47
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:47,174
Are you gonna give that
to some girl

48
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:50,257
'cause she looks like
she just stepped out of a music video?

49
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:51,980
GUYS: No.

50
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:55,543
No, you're gonna hold onto it

51
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:58,587
and share it with
the mother of your children.

52
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:00,548
GUYS: Yeah, definitely.

53
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:03,511
I mean, that's
what the ring is all about.

54
00:06:13,642 --> 00:06:15,924
The way it wraps around your finger,

55
00:06:17,646 --> 00:06:20,889
that's to remind you
to keep your gift wrapped.

56
00:06:25,294 --> 00:06:26,696
Wrapped...

57
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:29,459
until the day...

58
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,622
you trade it in for that other ring...

59
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,026
that gold ring.

60
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:41,631
Get it?

61
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,193
(whispers) You were so good!

62
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:47,236
MR. VINCENT: Because you know
this goes way beyond sex.

63
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:51,681
If you used your hand on yourself,
do you think that's pure?

64
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:53,483
ALL: No way!

65
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:55,886
MR. VINCENT: And is any of this--
groping, touching-- okay?

66
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:57,807
- I missed you.
- I missed you!

67
00:06:57,887 --> 00:06:59,649
This whole break, I've been calling--

68
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,211
That job that I have--

69
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,133
Ugh, mine too.

70
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:04,854
MR. VINCENT:
Who thinks that oral sex...?

71
00:07:04,894 --> 00:07:07,738
And my-- my mom.

72
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:09,940
She's sick again, so, um...

73
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:13,063
MR. VINCENT: You see,
there are no loopholes

74
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:14,225
with the Promise.

75
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:16,467
- I'm sorry, Dawn.
- PHIL: Yeah, sorry.

76
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:19,670
MR. VINCENT: There is no back door.

77
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,791
Hey, guys.

78
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:22,313
- Hi, Tobey.
- PHIL: Oh, Tobey!

79
00:07:22,393 --> 00:07:26,717
This is our friend, Dawn O'Keefe.
Tobey Cobb.

80
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,124
Tobey just moved here.
We were best friends back home.

81
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:36,327
He starts school with us tomorrow.

82
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:38,930
Hi.

83
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:40,812
Hey.

84
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:46,218
(clears throat)

85
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:49,860
TOBEY: So, I hear there's gonna be
27 pledges tonight so far.

86
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:51,623
- GWEN: No way.
- PHIL: Phenomenal!

87
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:52,944
It's you, you know.

88
00:07:54,186 --> 00:07:55,507
(giggles)

89
00:07:56,948 --> 00:07:58,070
Oh, I don't know.

90
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,072
It is.

91
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:02,634
People really related
to what you said, but...

92
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:05,318
especially the way you said it.

93
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:13,605
(singing)

94
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:15,928
# My heart, my heart #

95
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:21,895
# Bye-bye, bye-bye,
bye-bye, my heart #

96
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:23,136
MRS. KITCHENS: Hey, Dawn!

97
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:24,336
Hi, Mrs. Kitchens!

98
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:27,539
# Oh, my heart, my heart,
my heart, my heart #

99
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,917
(country music playing faintly)

100
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:56,170
Hi, baby.

101
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,372
Come on in.

102
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:02,656
So, how'd it go?

103
00:09:02,737 --> 00:09:05,380
They asked me to come back
to the next one and speak.

104
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,180
Well, of course they did.

105
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,386
BILL: Hey, sweetheart.
Did you have fun?

106
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,789
Yeah, they had awesome music.

107
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:16,911
- Mm-hmm?
- And, uh, food. So...

108
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,552
Oh, Kim, you're warm, baby.

109
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:21,796
You have pain today?

110
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,961
Let's talk about young people stuff.

111
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:30,925
Uh, Gwen and Phil say hi.

112
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:33,608
(scratchily) They are so adorable.

113
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:34,649
(sniffs)

114
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:36,811
Wills of iron.

115
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:38,413
(Bill chuckles)

116
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:41,256
Well, things were a little different
when we were growing up.

117
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:42,897
Hey.

118
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:44,140
(both laugh)

119
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:45,821
It is different now.

120
00:09:48,063 --> 00:09:50,625
Hey, honey, we're not complaining.

121
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:52,828
You are a blessing.

122
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,991
(heavy metal music blares)

123
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:01,677
KIM: Both our children are blessings.

124
00:10:29,906 --> 00:10:32,789
- (growling)
- (shrieks)

125
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:33,990
DAWN: Brad!

126
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:35,752
I got you, bitch!

127
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,876
I got you so good! Whoo!

128
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:41,478
WOMAN: # To know what it's like #

129
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,640
# To dance with him... #

130
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,842
(thwack)

131
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:48,886
# He's so close I can feel him #

132
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:51,408
(thwack)

133
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:53,651
#...won't give in
to the feeling 'cause #

134
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,733
# Love is worth waiting for #

135
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:57,414
(thwack)

136
00:10:57,494 --> 00:11:01,259
# Love is worth waiting for #

137
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:03,302
(thwack)

138
00:11:03,341 --> 00:11:05,344
(heavy metal music playing)

139
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:08,906
(thwack)

140
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,270
(thwack)

141
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,232
DAWN: # My heart is... #

142
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:29,287
ELLIOT: All right,
here's your chance.

143
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:31,130
Make a move, stud.

144
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:34,653
Hmm... gimme.

145
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:35,735
Give me it.

146
00:11:35,814 --> 00:11:36,935
Mm-hmm.

147
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:38,456
(car starts)

148
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:40,499
(hip-hop music playing)

149
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:57,075
GIRL: (mocking)
Love is worth waiting for!

150
00:11:57,156 --> 00:12:01,560
Wait? Yeah, I'll wait
for the bitch to get her panties off.

151
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,002
What kind of soda
do you guys got, huh?

152
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,005
- We got cherry.
- Let's pop that cherry!

153
00:12:05,044 --> 00:12:06,846
(soda sprays)

154
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,487
- Go on!
- (laughing)

155
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,411
ELLIOT: Sorry!

156
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:14,053
- Hey, Tobey.
- Hey, Dawn.

157
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,135
Quite a welcome.

158
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:16,336
Dick.

159
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,099
Great. You're not allowed
to actively thwart it.

160
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,300
All's fair, dude.

161
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:21,822
Okay, dude.

162
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:24,985
(school bell rings)

163
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:28,028
MR. GRIFFITH:
So, questions?

164
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:30,269
That's it, then, for the penis.

165
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:32,192
Let's move on to the...

166
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:34,755
to the, ahem...

167
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:37,117
uh, the next page.

168
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,964
The female... privates.

169
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:50,731
- Um, there's something weird in my book.
- Leave it.

170
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,134
I have it too.

171
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:53,254
A sticker.

172
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:54,935
What's it hiding?

173
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:58,099
MR. GRIFFITH: The state school board
has rightly ordered it be concealed,

174
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:01,303
a detailed diagram of-- of the--

175
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:02,663
Vulva!

176
00:13:02,744 --> 00:13:03,945
- (laughing)
- GIRL: Oh, my God.

177
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:08,029
BOY: That's fucked up.

178
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:09,591
RYAN: Why are they covering that up?

179
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:11,553
MR. GRIFFITH: (sighs)
That should be obvious.

180
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:13,114
They showed the penis picture.

181
00:13:13,194 --> 00:13:14,717
- That's different.
- How so?

182
00:13:14,797 --> 00:13:17,838
ELLIOT: The sad thing is, Ryan,
you'll probably never know.

183
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,241
(laughing)

184
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:20,441
GIRL: Right?

185
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:22,124
Uh, Dawn.

186
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:24,686
I think I can tell you how it's different.

187
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:26,849
- Girls have a natural modesty.
- (scoffing)

188
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:29,250
It's built into our nature,
and so depicting...

189
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,413
(classroom laughing)

190
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:33,136
They do!

191
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:43,105
(chattering)

192
00:13:45,228 --> 00:13:47,109
Oh, great!
I read about that one.

193
00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:50,953
Phil, that's rated R.

194
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:52,636
Oh, I hear it's good.

195
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:58,241
I'm not saying we should see it.

196
00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:02,245
You know what, even the PG-13
is gonna have heavy making out.

197
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,971
Well, there's...

198
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:11,374
(cartoon music plays)

199
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:19,062
(cuckoo clock chirps)

200
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:20,183
(softly) Sorry.

201
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:21,345
(softly) It's okay.

202
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:24,788
ONSCREEN CHARACTER: Bunny.

203
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,275
(antique carhorn blares)

204
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:32,837
(exaggerated bouncing sounds)

205
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:48,813
(heavy metal music
playing indoors)

206
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:55,580
How'd that happen?

207
00:14:57,942 --> 00:14:59,304
I was a little kid.

208
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:01,587
No one ever told you?

209
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:04,750
No, they never figured it out.

210
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:11,035
What?

211
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:15,601
(sighs)

212
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,683
I think she bit it.

213
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:20,806
She... who?

214
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:24,850
Dawn.

215
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:28,534
A baby bit the end
of your finger off?

216
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:30,416
Here, hit this.

217
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:35,061
(lighter clicks)

218
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:37,144
(bubbling)

219
00:15:46,632 --> 00:15:48,154
DAWN: Hey, guys,
where are we going?

220
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:49,636
GWEN: You'll see!

221
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,718
(music playing)

222
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,759
(chattering)

223
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:59,685
(laughing)

224
00:16:06,894 --> 00:16:08,855
DAWN: Isn't this a big make-out spot?

225
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,178
GWEN: Only at night.

226
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:16,864
Do you think this is a good idea?

227
00:16:16,904 --> 00:16:18,266
PHIL: We're in a group.

228
00:16:19,507 --> 00:16:20,988
TOBEY: We'll police each other.

229
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:24,632
Right?

230
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:35,083
DAWN: Is this private property?

231
00:16:36,364 --> 00:16:38,567
GWEN: Watch out
for the poison ivy.

232
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:48,176
- Whoa.
- GWEN: Phil, what are you doing?

233
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:55,784
Whoa.

234
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:58,547
Wow.

235
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:00,990
Is that a cave?

236
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,391
Yeah.

237
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,315
People go there to... you know.

238
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:21,170
(alternative rock music playing)

239
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,372
You like that?

240
00:17:28,778 --> 00:17:31,901
You know, I do have
a perfectly good pussy.

241
00:17:31,981 --> 00:17:33,824
I'm sure you do.

242
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:36,906
Well, I do.
Other boys like it just fine.

243
00:17:36,987 --> 00:17:38,469
(grunts)

244
00:17:38,548 --> 00:17:39,869
Ow.

245
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,430
Well, fuck them, then.

246
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:56,728
Hey, Mother!

247
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:57,888
(barks)

248
00:17:57,968 --> 00:17:59,570
Hey, come over here.
Get in.

249
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:01,051
(chuckling) Come on, get in!

250
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:02,333
- (dog growls)
- Whoa!

251
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:06,137
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

252
00:18:06,177 --> 00:18:08,260
A little too close.

253
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,101
You get what you deserve.

254
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:16,908
Really?

255
00:18:49,822 --> 00:18:51,143
Knock it off!

256
00:18:51,222 --> 00:18:52,184
Ugh! (spits)

257
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,305
Brad!

258
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:55,908
(birds calling)

259
00:18:55,988 --> 00:18:57,349
DAWN: No, never.

260
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,431
It's never even been a big deal.

261
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:03,195
I just... always knew I wanted
to wait until marriage.

262
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:09,882
So, no one's ever even touched your...

263
00:19:09,963 --> 00:19:11,484
Absolutely not!

264
00:19:12,605 --> 00:19:13,806
Gosh.

265
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,412
Why, are...

266
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,455
- Aren't you?
- I'm a virgin.

267
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,538
- That's great.
- Mm.

268
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:30,183
In His eyes.

269
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:33,788
Oh.

270
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,554
It was just once...
about a year and a half ago.

271
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:41,594
Right.

272
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:48,002
Still dealing with the guilt.

273
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:57,330
Actually, you're...
probably stronger now.

274
00:19:58,773 --> 00:19:59,973
Your resolve.

275
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:02,656
Because you've been there.

276
00:20:02,696 --> 00:20:05,781
I mean, you've seen
the dangers firsthand.

277
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:29,244
- Where's the arroyo bridge?
- I'll show you.

278
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:31,287
(dog whimpers)

279
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:34,049
WOMAN ON TV (to dog):
What's happening to you tonight?

280
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:35,690
Keep quiet!

281
00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:46,743
WOMAN ON TV: Alive?

282
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:49,986
MAN ON TV: I can't believe it,
enduring for centuries like this.

283
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:51,948
MAN ON TV #2:
And under all that heat.

284
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,230
(screaming) Oh, no!

285
00:21:02,357 --> 00:21:04,920
(monster roars)

286
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:09,045
MAN ON TV: Yaah!

287
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,207
(turns off TV)

288
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,212
(thunder crashes)

289
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:10,188
(wedding bells chiming)

290
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,081
(church organ playing)

291
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:29,328
(choir singing in Latin)

292
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:39,818
(heart pounding)

293
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,662
(growling)

294
00:23:21,742 --> 00:23:24,265
(thunder rumbling)

295
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:28,749
What is wrong with me?

296
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:34,395
Purity.

297
00:23:35,636 --> 00:23:36,958
Purity.

298
00:23:38,238 --> 00:23:39,239
Tsk.

299
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:51,773
MS. DENNIS: Back then,
these snakes were born

300
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:55,817
into an environment
with very large mammals,

301
00:23:55,896 --> 00:23:58,580
so the diamondbacks
that developed a rattle

302
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,823
had a big advantage
over those that didn't.

303
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:03,704
They didn't get stepped on.

304
00:24:03,786 --> 00:24:05,747
You mean suddenly,
out of nowhere,

305
00:24:05,787 --> 00:24:08,190
a baby snake was born
with a big rattle?

306
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,510
(soft scoffing)

307
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:12,194
The prevailing theory
is that it would have been born

308
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:13,636
with an incipient...

309
00:24:13,716 --> 00:24:14,877
RYAN: Primitive.

310
00:24:14,956 --> 00:24:16,077
MS. DENNIS:
Thank you, Ryan.

311
00:24:16,157 --> 00:24:18,641
...rattle-like mutation

312
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,323
that would have developed
over thousands of years of evolution,

313
00:24:21,363 --> 00:24:22,766
but we don't know for sure.

314
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:24,126
Got that right.

315
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:27,050
It's also possible that it happened
exactly as you said,

316
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,932
and that one day
a baby diamondback was born

317
00:24:29,972 --> 00:24:31,975
with a fully formed mutation

318
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:35,378
that just happened to be
extremely beneficial to its survival.

319
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,139
(sighs)

320
00:24:38,943 --> 00:24:41,544
Does this seem irrelevant
to all of you?

321
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:42,746
Because it's not.

322
00:24:44,988 --> 00:24:48,031
Now, I know a lot of you
subscribe to other theories.

323
00:24:49,432 --> 00:24:52,035
But however you think
this was all set in motion...

324
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,597
-...it's about your life.
- Hey.

325
00:24:53,677 --> 00:24:56,881
It's about why you are
the way you are.

326
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,921
Dawn?

327
00:24:59,203 --> 00:25:00,924
This is about you.

328
00:25:01,926 --> 00:25:03,327
And you missed it.

329
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:13,417
(locker room hooting)

330
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:16,420
(cell phone ringing)

331
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:22,066
DAWN: Tobey, listen.

332
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,392
I was really weird this morning.

333
00:25:29,314 --> 00:25:30,916
I think I know why.

334
00:25:33,037 --> 00:25:35,198
I had a really nice time.

335
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,481
Me too.

336
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:40,805
My thoughts haven't been so pure.

337
00:25:42,046 --> 00:25:43,248
Look, I--

338
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,813
I think that we can't
go out together again...

339
00:25:49,654 --> 00:25:51,416
I mean, even in a group.

340
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:54,579
Even in a big group.

341
00:25:55,781 --> 00:25:57,663
I was thinking the same thing.

342
00:25:58,664 --> 00:26:00,064
Just...

343
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,228
didn't want it to be true.

344
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,872
We're so in sync.

345
00:26:13,078 --> 00:26:14,800
MELANIE: What is wrong with you?

346
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,843
BRAD: You look a lot better
with a dick in your mouth.

347
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:19,285
MELANIE: Fucking bastard!

348
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:22,329
Why can't we do it normal
like everybody else?

349
00:26:26,572 --> 00:26:29,896
Why do we always have
to do it that way, Brad? It hurts!

350
00:26:29,937 --> 00:26:33,459
I don't want to do it!
It hurts! You're not being fair!

351
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,661
BRAD:...what I wanna do...

352
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,703
MELANIE: Deep down,
I know you don't really like to try--

353
00:26:37,784 --> 00:26:39,305
BRAD: Fuck you!

354
00:26:39,385 --> 00:26:40,988
MELANIE: I love you!

355
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:42,308
BRAD: You love me?

356
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:45,072
MELANIE: (sobs) Yes.
And you love me too, you know you do.

357
00:26:45,112 --> 00:26:47,994
BRAD: (laughing)
And I love you too. I love your ass.

358
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:55,363
(knock on door)

359
00:26:56,362 --> 00:26:57,364
Yo.

360
00:26:57,445 --> 00:26:58,685
DAWN: Are you alone?

361
00:27:07,734 --> 00:27:09,217
(coughs)

362
00:27:13,862 --> 00:27:15,945
(sighs)

363
00:27:16,024 --> 00:27:18,106
Can I have a serious talk with you?

364
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:22,830
(Brad picking guitar listlessly)

365
00:27:26,835 --> 00:27:28,195
About you and Melanie.

366
00:27:28,276 --> 00:27:30,759
There's no me and any bitch.

367
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,801
Okay.

368
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:36,885
From what I heard last night--

369
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:38,606
Did that turn you on?

370
00:27:39,768 --> 00:27:41,050
You...

371
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:46,095
I know we've never been close.

372
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:48,217
We've never been
like sister and brother,

373
00:27:48,297 --> 00:27:49,738
and I really don't know why that is.

374
00:27:49,778 --> 00:27:50,860
Sure you do.

375
00:27:54,344 --> 00:27:56,024
You know.

376
00:27:56,105 --> 00:27:58,626
I really don't,

377
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:02,951
but whatever it is,
I'd like for it to change.

378
00:28:02,993 --> 00:28:06,154
You know, all that abstinence bullshit?

379
00:28:07,796 --> 00:28:10,120
We all knowhow you've
been saving yourself for.

380
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:14,323
And I've been real patient.

381
00:28:15,364 --> 00:28:17,807
You think I like living here
with these assholes?

382
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:20,330
Mom and Dad?

383
00:28:22,052 --> 00:28:24,855
So why don't you just
set that pretty ass down?

384
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:30,019
(slams door)

385
00:28:30,101 --> 00:28:32,062
(howls in frustration)

386
00:28:33,904 --> 00:28:34,944
(slams door)

387
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:42,993
(speed dials)

388
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:45,075
(ringing)

389
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:51,803
TOBEY: Dawn?

390
00:28:51,882 --> 00:28:53,322
I need to see you.

391
00:29:05,175 --> 00:29:07,539
I brought my bathing suit.

392
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:11,982
(laughing)

393
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:20,593
(unzipping)

394
00:29:50,703 --> 00:29:53,146
That's just how
I imagined you in my mind.

395
00:29:54,307 --> 00:29:55,268
You're beautiful.

396
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:57,670
You imagined me?

397
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:01,715
That's okay. I did too.

398
00:30:02,715 --> 00:30:04,236
You. Except...

399
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,881
with less.

400
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,133
(laughing)

401
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:04,380
This does not feel wrong at all.

402
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,316
(giggles)

403
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,762
(laughing)

404
00:31:28,443 --> 00:31:29,445
Uh!

405
00:31:42,738 --> 00:31:43,740
Purity.

406
00:32:16,653 --> 00:32:18,616
(waterfall gushing)

407
00:33:26,806 --> 00:33:28,007
No, stay in there.

408
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:29,648
I'm freezing!

409
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:40,981
Oh.

410
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:13,975
(both panting)

411
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:47,128
Uh.

412
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:49,851
Let's go back.

413
00:34:49,931 --> 00:34:50,933
Okay.

414
00:34:53,294 --> 00:34:54,336
(softly) Okay.

415
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:57,660
Can I just--?

416
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,143
TOBEY: Mmm. Mmm, wow.

417
00:35:01,223 --> 00:35:02,185
DAWN: Mm--

418
00:35:06,228 --> 00:35:07,749
We made a sacred promise.

419
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:11,033
Get off.

420
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:16,239
- You don't have to do anything.
- No. No, damn it.

421
00:35:16,318 --> 00:35:18,641
Stop-- damn it, Tobey! No!

422
00:35:18,721 --> 00:35:21,004
I haven't even jerked off
since Easter!

423
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:22,965
I am saying no!

424
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:26,168
Tobey, don't! No!

425
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:27,850
(screams)

426
00:35:27,931 --> 00:35:29,892
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

427
00:35:29,973 --> 00:35:32,015
(whispers) I'm sorry.

428
00:35:34,778 --> 00:35:36,059
Dawn?

429
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:37,140
(groans)

430
00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:04,249
- Oh...
- (gasps)

431
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:06,290
Stop it! What are you doing?!

432
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,813
- Oh, it's okay! It's okay.
- Tobey!

433
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:10,694
You're still pure in His eyes.

434
00:36:10,775 --> 00:36:13,578
(shrieks) No!

435
00:36:14,898 --> 00:36:16,421
(squelching sound)

436
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:18,503
(strangled cries)

437
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:21,546
(Tobey groans)

438
00:36:23,908 --> 00:36:24,870
(frightened cries)

439
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,230
What? What?

440
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,713
What?

441
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:29,755
(screams)

442
00:36:30,915 --> 00:36:32,998
Get off!

443
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:36,601
(frightened panting)

444
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,327
(screams)

445
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,411
(screams)

446
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,021
Get away!

447
00:36:56,102 --> 00:36:58,104
(continues screaming)

448
00:36:59,265 --> 00:37:00,547
(splash)

449
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:02,309
(crying)

450
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:02,490
Tobey?

451
00:38:46,896 --> 00:38:50,940
ELLA FITZGERALD:
# Throw out the lifeline #

452
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,865
# Throw out the lifeline #

453
00:38:55,946 --> 00:39:03,153
# Someone is drifting away #

454
00:39:04,914 --> 00:39:09,119
# Throw out the lifeline #

455
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:13,843
# Throw out the lifeline #

456
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:19,889
# Someone is sinking today #

457
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:31,822
# Throw out the lifeline
across the dark wave #

458
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:40,671
# There is a brother
whom someone should save #

459
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:49,000
# Somebody's brother,
oh, who then will dare #

460
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,563
- # To throw out... #
- KIM: That you, honey?

461
00:39:51,644 --> 00:39:52,684
It's me.

462
00:39:52,764 --> 00:39:54,806
BILL: There's dinner
if you want a bite.

463
00:39:54,886 --> 00:39:56,927
I ate.

464
00:39:57,009 --> 00:39:58,210
Thanks.

465
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:03,015
# Throw out the lifeline #

466
00:40:03,175 --> 00:40:07,300
# Throw out the lifeline #

467
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:14,146
# Someone is drifting away #

468
00:40:16,348 --> 00:40:19,071
# Throw out the life-- #

469
00:41:31,265 --> 00:41:33,747
(Dawn pulling objects
from wall)

470
00:42:00,335 --> 00:42:02,898
Just wing it, Dawn.
You'll be fine.

471
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,780
PHIL: Yeah, speak from the heart.

472
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,263
Huh?

473
00:42:11,026 --> 00:42:13,268
- Tobey'll be there.
- You've seen him?

474
00:42:13,348 --> 00:42:14,350
He said he wanted to come,
but wouldn't if--

475
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:15,390
When?

476
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,233
I don't know,
a couple of days ago?

477
00:42:17,312 --> 00:42:19,794
If it made you nervous,
he said he wouldn't come,

478
00:42:19,876 --> 00:42:23,439
but he really wants to support you.
You just always seem to get--

479
00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:25,481
(cheering)

480
00:42:26,483 --> 00:42:29,165
ALL: Dawn! Yay, Dawn!

481
00:42:43,499 --> 00:42:46,463
Mr. Vincent asked me
to talk about purity today.

482
00:42:46,504 --> 00:42:47,944
ALL: Purity, yes!

483
00:42:52,308 --> 00:42:53,269
Yeah?

484
00:42:56,393 --> 00:42:57,394
And...

485
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:01,839
yesterday...

486
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:07,045
I could have done that...

487
00:43:10,447 --> 00:43:12,089
because yesterday I was pure.

488
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:16,174
ALL: " 'She shall be called woman,
because she was taken out of man.' "

489
00:43:18,536 --> 00:43:19,617
Adam.

490
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:26,024
- Right.
- I can't make sense of it yet. I--

491
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,465
Uh...

492
00:43:28,747 --> 00:43:30,147
Is that it? Is...

493
00:43:31,228 --> 00:43:32,992
Is...

494
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:34,913
Is it the Adam inside?

495
00:43:34,993 --> 00:43:35,994
Inside--

496
00:43:36,073 --> 00:43:39,518
ALL: "'Bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh.'"

497
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,561
I don't know.

498
00:43:42,641 --> 00:43:44,002
DAWN: Phew, I don't know.

499
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:51,330
But there is something...

500
00:43:54,693 --> 00:43:56,094
There is something...

501
00:43:57,736 --> 00:44:00,339
inside of... me...

502
00:44:04,103 --> 00:44:05,344
that's lethal.

503
00:44:05,384 --> 00:44:08,386
- The serpent.

MR. VINCENT: I think
what Dawn is getting at

506
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:21,802
is so important, people--

Serpent. Serpent. Serpent.

not part of God's original plan...

thanks to Eve and the devil, we--

(instrumental music playing)

512
00:44:44,825 --> 00:44:45,906
Hey, Dawn!

513
00:44:47,308 --> 00:44:48,669
What are you doing here?

514
00:44:48,749 --> 00:44:50,591
Oh, you know, checking it out.

515
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,393
I thought if you were so into it,
it must be pretty cool.

516
00:44:53,434 --> 00:44:54,755
- Did you drive?
- Yeah.

517
00:44:54,835 --> 00:44:56,997
Yeah, my mom lent me her car.

518
00:44:57,038 --> 00:44:58,038
Oh!

519
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:12,614
Uh, listen.

520
00:45:14,215 --> 00:45:17,258
Um... do you want
to hang out sometime?

521
00:45:19,541 --> 00:45:21,383
I-- I mean, I know you're--

522
00:45:21,462 --> 00:45:23,425
you're not into,
you know, whatever,

523
00:45:23,465 --> 00:45:25,186
but, uh...

524
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,273
L-like a date?

(scoffs)

526
00:45:43,565 --> 00:45:44,727
That's funny.

527
00:45:50,291 --> 00:45:51,895
- It's not you.
- Mm-hmm.

528
00:45:53,336 --> 00:45:54,417
No big deal.

529
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:20,323
Oh, what's
so goddamn funny about it?

530
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:22,364
Damn.

Hey, Brad.

00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:47,151
Uh, I'm here for Dawn.

You're out of your league, pussy boy.

- Excuse me?
- Get the fuck off my property.

538

Uhh!

540
00:46:59,243 --> 00:47:01,367
If you want any more of that,

541
00:47:01,526 --> 00:47:02,326
you can come by
and see us again, yeah?

You'd like to start on birth control.

No, uh... I just...

586

wanna be... checked out.

You know, make sure
that there are no...

adaptations or anything.

589

I think there might be
something weird going on inside.

590
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:37,614
Indeed there is.

591
00:53:39,296 --> 00:53:43,341
What you're probably
adapting to is womanhood.

No.

00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:14,932
Deal?

601
00:54:18,216 --> 00:54:19,417
Okay, then.

602
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,031
How's this?

603
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,595
Shouldn't you tell me?

604
00:54:36,915 --> 00:54:38,357
It's good.

605
00:54:41,439 --> 00:54:43,123
Okay.

Ow!

609
00:55:05,986 --> 00:55:08,228
Just lie back and relax.

610
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:10,590
Just breathe.

611
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:11,871
(whimpers)

612
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:13,713
Breathe through the pain.

613
00:55:14,795 --> 00:55:16,515
I can't!

614
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:23,042
Oh!

615

617

Relax.

618
00:55:29,489 --> 00:55:31,691
Yes, now there we go.

619
00:55:33,373 --> 00:55:35,096
What? What's--

620
00:55:37,617 --> 00:55:39,259
What have you put in here?

621
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:40,862
Didn't--! Aah!

622

Dad, Mom?

Mom! No!

No! Help!

Oh, God, honey.

653
00:59:07,274 --> 00:59:10,317
Sweetheart, you gotta get home
and get some rest.

654
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,004
She's gonna need you
chipper tomorrow, hmm?

655
00:59:19,567 --> 00:59:20,568
You go.

656
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,133
Be careful.

657
00:59:27,335 --> 00:59:29,777
NURSE: Emergency room,
how may I help you?

658
00:59:38,306 --> 00:59:40,468
MELANIE: I don't even feel
like I know you right now.

659
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:42,711
I don't know what's in the ass
that makes you so excited.

660

BRAD: You know what?
Probably somebody's...

shut the fuck up!?

Elliot?

669
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:23,792
- Hi.
- (sobbing) There's no one--

670
01:00:23,873 --> 01:00:26,756
There's nobody else that I can talk to.

671
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:30,840
My mom is in the hospital.

672
01:00:32,082 --> 01:00:35,565
I have to go to the police
and turn myself in.

673
01:00:35,645 --> 01:00:36,687
Police?

674
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:44,174
I killed him.

675
01:00:44,254 --> 01:00:45,896
You killed someone?

676
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,699
Almost two.

677
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,182
(laughs nervously)

678
01:00:57,188 --> 01:01:00,711
(tribal drumming)

679
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,113
Dentata.

680
01:01:03,674 --> 01:01:05,155
What?

681
01:01:05,235 --> 01:01:07,598
It's Latin for "teeth."

682
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:10,281
A vagina that...

683
01:01:10,361 --> 01:01:12,444
Uh, yeah, I know what that is.

684
01:01:13,525 --> 01:01:15,567
I'm not following you.

685
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,808
What again?

686
01:01:16,847 --> 01:01:18,689
Vagina dentata.

687
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:22,093
It's what's inside me.

688
01:01:23,135 --> 01:01:24,295
The doctor said so.

689
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:28,259
A hero has to come and conquer them.
That's what they say.

690
01:01:28,339 --> 01:01:29,381
Who?

691
01:01:30,982 --> 01:01:35,506
The ancient Greeks and Egyptians
and early Christians and Jews

692
01:01:35,587 --> 01:01:40,232
and Polynesians
and lots of Native Americans.

693
01:01:40,311 --> 01:01:42,233
Shh, shh.

694
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:59,011
(knocking on door)

695
01:02:00,892 --> 01:02:02,014
(hinges creak)

696
01:02:02,095 --> 01:02:04,417
RYAN: Ahem.
Uh, I'm not looking.

697
01:02:04,497 --> 01:02:08,260
My mom takes these
for her nerves.

698
01:02:18,191 --> 01:02:21,394
(door creaks closed)

699
01:02:29,242 --> 01:02:30,643
(instrumental jazz music playing)

700
01:02:30,723 --> 01:02:33,286
Good. Okay.

701
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:36,490
All right.

702
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:57,432
Where are my clothes?

703
01:02:57,511 --> 01:02:58,553
Um...

704
01:02:58,632 --> 01:03:00,674
I have to go to the police.

705
01:03:00,755 --> 01:03:04,118
That pill might make you
a little fuzzy-headed.

706
01:03:04,158 --> 01:03:05,680
I have to confess.

707
01:03:05,759 --> 01:03:07,962
Yeah, but, uh,
tomorrow, tomorrow.

708
01:03:08,042 --> 01:03:10,524
You want them
to take you seriously, don't you?

709
01:03:11,885 --> 01:03:12,887
Come.

710
01:03:16,771 --> 01:03:18,013
Have a seat.

711
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,662
(cork pops)

712
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:30,264
(liquid pouring)

713
01:03:32,867 --> 01:03:34,108
Take it.

714
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,764
To the smartest, prettiest girl I know.

715
01:03:49,405 --> 01:03:50,407
(clink)

716
01:03:51,406 --> 01:03:53,448
(inhales) Oh.

717
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,262
This is how I always
dreamed it'd be.

718
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:13,750
Ooh!

719
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:18,195
Oh... oh.

720
01:04:18,235 --> 01:04:20,397
Hey, hey, relax.

721
01:04:20,477 --> 01:04:22,319
Relax. Just rest.

722
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,921
Just rest.

723
01:04:25,002 --> 01:04:26,163
I'm right here.

724
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:35,893
- (vibrator buzzing)
- DAWN: Oh.

725
01:04:46,463 --> 01:04:48,466
(vibrator continues buzzing)

726
01:05:05,804 --> 01:05:07,806
(vibration intensifies)

727
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:13,773
(moans softly)

728
01:05:26,544 --> 01:05:28,186
(tears wrapper)

729
01:05:42,121 --> 01:05:43,723
(Ryan moans shakily)

730
01:05:43,803 --> 01:05:45,285
(gasps) Oh.

731
01:05:46,326 --> 01:05:48,287
You can't.

732
01:05:48,368 --> 01:05:49,969
D-do you want me to stop?

733
01:05:55,295 --> 01:05:56,616
No.

734
01:05:58,938 --> 01:06:00,941
(laughs) Oh. Good.

735
01:06:03,143 --> 01:06:04,584
But-- they'll get you.

736
01:06:05,585 --> 01:06:06,586
Who?

737
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:07,908
The teeth.

738
01:06:07,987 --> 01:06:10,030
Oh, come on.

739
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:11,311
Seriously.

740
01:06:11,391 --> 01:06:13,835
No, no, look.

741
01:06:14,915 --> 01:06:17,278
I'm-- I'm conquering them.

742
01:06:18,279 --> 01:06:19,279
See? Yeah.

743
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:22,203
I'm-- I'm-- I'm the hero.

744
01:06:32,973 --> 01:06:36,257
We found this embedded
in the penile stump.

745
01:06:36,337 --> 01:06:37,898
So what's it from?

746
01:06:37,979 --> 01:06:41,102
Well, dentition is not an exact science.

747
01:06:41,182 --> 01:06:46,107
The root design would have led me
to ascribe it to the selachii,

748
01:06:46,187 --> 01:06:48,270
the sharks and the rays...

749
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:53,915
but the crown made me think
of the cyclostomes, the lamprey.

750
01:06:54,996 --> 01:06:57,478
See the serration near the tip?

751
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,324
So this comes from a cross
between a shark and an eel,

752
01:07:02,403 --> 01:07:03,845
something like that?

753
01:07:03,925 --> 01:07:08,130
No. Our tests show that it's human.

754
01:07:09,411 --> 01:07:11,373
(both moaning)

755
01:07:53,056 --> 01:07:54,818
Huh.

756
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:57,260
(giggles)

757
01:07:58,781 --> 01:07:59,783
What?

758
01:08:00,823 --> 01:08:03,025
Uh... noth-nothing.

759
01:08:05,148 --> 01:08:08,072
I just-- just can't believe it.

760
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:11,476
I can't either.

761
01:08:13,477 --> 01:08:15,600
I can't believe you're still alive.

762
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,441
(laughs)

763
01:08:17,521 --> 01:08:19,683
Uh, right.

764
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:21,245
(growls playfully)

765
01:08:33,737 --> 01:08:35,220
(monitor beeping)

766
01:08:35,299 --> 01:08:36,661
WOMAN: I got it. Thanks.

767
01:08:45,029 --> 01:08:46,512
(surgeon sighs)

768
01:08:49,394 --> 01:08:52,557
MAN: You sure you don't want
to tell us how this happened?

769
01:09:37,763 --> 01:09:39,126
Where you going?

770
01:09:40,126 --> 01:09:42,048
I do have to go to the police.

771
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:48,296
(vibrator buzzing)

772
01:10:00,267 --> 01:10:02,831
Mm, you are my hero.

773
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:04,552
(giggles)

774
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,642
(cell phone ringing)

775
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:21,609
Sweet.

776
01:10:25,373 --> 01:10:26,614
Hey, loser.

777
01:10:26,695 --> 01:10:28,096
As we speak.

778
01:10:29,418 --> 01:10:30,698
Oh, yeah?

779
01:10:30,778 --> 01:10:32,021
- ELLIOT: She's not there.
- Yeah?

780
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,501
- Prove it.
- Say something.

781
01:10:35,543 --> 01:10:36,986
- What?
- There's nobody there, man.

782
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:38,386
- No!
- You hear that?

783
01:10:38,426 --> 01:10:40,949
- What?!
- (laughs)

784
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:42,350
Yes.

785
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,953
(laughs)

786
01:10:44,033 --> 01:10:46,195
- Mmm...
- What was that?

787
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:47,595
Oh, nothing.

788
01:10:50,799 --> 01:10:52,841
We made a bet

789
01:10:52,921 --> 01:10:56,365
that I could, uh, you know.

790
01:10:56,445 --> 01:10:57,687
Unh-unh-unh.

791
01:10:59,248 --> 01:11:03,853
So... you made a bet about me

792
01:11:03,932 --> 01:11:06,856
when I had taken
a sacred vow of abstinence?

793
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:09,579
I had a hunch
that it wasn't all that sacred.

794
01:11:09,659 --> 01:11:10,981
It was, though.

795
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:14,144
Your mouth is saying
one thing, babe,

796
01:11:14,224 --> 01:11:18,629
but your sweet pussy
is saying something very...

797
01:11:18,669 --> 01:11:19,669
different.

798
01:11:22,472 --> 01:11:23,674
(squelching)

799
01:11:23,754 --> 01:11:24,754
(cries out)

800
01:11:26,395 --> 01:11:28,638
Uh, aah! Aah!

801
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:31,761
Oh... shit.

802
01:11:31,842 --> 01:11:34,805
(screaming)

803
01:11:46,817 --> 01:11:48,419
Some hero.

804
01:12:03,153 --> 01:12:04,475
Mom?

805
01:12:14,765 --> 01:12:15,968
You're the daughter?

806
01:12:20,011 --> 01:12:21,053
Just a moment.

807
01:12:24,336 --> 01:12:25,738
Have a seat, dear.

808
01:12:33,025 --> 01:12:35,027
(phone ringing)

809
01:12:36,428 --> 01:12:38,430
(heavy metal music playing)

810
01:12:51,564 --> 01:12:52,605
Son?

811
01:12:55,889 --> 01:12:57,730
- Son!
- (grunts)

812
01:12:57,771 --> 01:13:00,613
- Oh, what the fuck, Dad?
- (dog barking)

813
01:13:00,694 --> 01:13:01,934
Jesus.

814
01:13:01,975 --> 01:13:04,497
Would you excuse us,
miss, please?

815
01:13:04,577 --> 01:13:05,537
Okay.

816
01:13:10,342 --> 01:13:12,545
I want you out of here.

817
01:13:13,988 --> 01:13:15,148
Out.

818
01:13:16,389 --> 01:13:17,350
What?

819
01:13:22,355 --> 01:13:23,958
Oh, right, so...

820
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:27,161
it's Kim, huh?

821
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,963
Old cunt's making you kick me
to the curb, is that what's going on?

822
01:13:30,044 --> 01:13:31,044
Ow!

823
01:13:31,124 --> 01:13:33,127
MAN: When it rains, it pours.

824
01:13:33,206 --> 01:13:34,327
WOMAN: I know, right?

825
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:39,813
MAN: There has got to be a story here.

826
01:13:39,895 --> 01:13:41,536
WOMAN: He was in a delirium.

827
01:13:44,979 --> 01:13:46,581
MAN: Hardly seems worth it.

828
01:13:46,621 --> 01:13:47,742
(all chuckle)

829
01:13:51,306 --> 01:13:53,788
You want me out of here,
you're gonna have to throw me out.

830
01:13:53,868 --> 01:13:55,590
I should've done that
a long time ago.

831
01:13:56,631 --> 01:13:57,713
Yeah, you should have.

832
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:00,515
(both grunting)

833
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:06,200
- (Melanie shrieks)
- BRAD: Shit!

834
01:14:15,169 --> 01:14:16,532
- (whimpers)
- BRAD: Mother!

835
01:14:18,294 --> 01:14:19,734
- MELANIE: No, Brad, don't!
- BRAD: Aaahhhh!

836
01:14:19,814 --> 01:14:20,935
(dog barks)

837
01:14:21,017 --> 01:14:22,097
BRAD: Uhh.

838
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:25,140
BILL: Uhh!

839
01:14:26,782 --> 01:14:29,105
- Brad, you're a fucking--
- BRAD: Yeah!

840
01:14:29,184 --> 01:14:31,186
Yeah, who's kicking

841
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:32,748

(dog growls)

850

Please, son.

851
01:15:14,351 --> 01:15:16,834
Why'd you have to marry her?

852
01:15:16,914 --> 01:15:19,437
Look, I know you loved your mother.

853
01:15:19,516 --> 01:15:21,037
- I did too--
- My mother?

854
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:23,361
I don't even remember that bitch.

855
01:15:23,441 --> 01:15:24,601
What?

856
01:15:33,331 --> 01:15:35,093
You made her my sister.

857
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:41,219
(growling continues)

858
01:15:41,298 --> 01:15:42,820
I loved her, Dad.

(Melanie cries)

860
01:15:44,943 --> 01:15:47,106

861
01:15:49,027 --> 01:15:50,628
So very much.

862
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:52,350
She does.

(dog whimpering)

865
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:12,891
Mother, shut up.

866
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:15,614
- (yowls)
- Hey, get back in your cage!

867
01:16:17,016 --> 01:16:18,056
Get!

868
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:24,944
INTERCOM: Dr. Sanchez,
please report to the nurses' station.

869
01:16:26,106 --> 01:16:27,626
Dr. Sanchez...

870
01:16:28,627 --> 01:16:30,350
Oh... mm.

871
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:32,391

01:16:52,412 --> 01:16:53,774
I'm sorry.

876
01:16:55,816 --> 01:16:58,339
She was screaming,
but Brad said just to ignore it,

877
01:16:58,418 --> 01:17:00,100
that she did that all the time.

878
01:17:01,982 --> 01:17:03,303
I'm so sorry.

879
01:17:07,267 --> 01:17:09,269

881
01:19:17,441 --> 01:19:19,445
Why are you doing this now?.

882
01:19:22,647 --> 01:19:24,250
Are you afraid?

883
01:19:26,651 --> 01:19:29,014
(sighs shakily)

884
01:19:41,587 --> 01:19:42,588

886
01:19:43,789 --> 01:19:46,111
This is too fucking weird.

887

889
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,841
Wait.

Pshew. Okay.

891
01:20:01,487 --> 01:20:03,929
Ow. What are you--

892
01:20:04,009 --> 01:20:06,452
- All right, that's it.

893
01:20:06,532 --> 01:20:07,814
Aw, God!

894
01:20:34,161 --> 01:20:36,443
MAN ON TV: Why did you
want to come here?

Yeah. You see
what we've been missing?

(whimpering, scratching)

908
01:21:23,372 --> 01:21:27,215
We... always knew
it'd play out this way eventually,

909
01:21:27,295 --> 01:21:28,417
didn't we?

(panting)

911
