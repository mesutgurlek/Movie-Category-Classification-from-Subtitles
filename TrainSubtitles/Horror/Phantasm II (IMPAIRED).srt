[Thinking]
Eight years ago,

2
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,490
my visions began...

3
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,661
terrifying fantasies
of things to come.

4
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,291
Through them I found you, Mike,

5
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,500
and your friend, Reggie.

6
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,836
[Male]
First, he took Mom and Dad.

7
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,547
Then he took Jodie.

8
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,800
Now he's after me.

9
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:37,388
Mike, that Tall Man of yours
did not take Jodie away.

10
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,015
Jodie died in a car wreck.

11
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,060
He had a dream...

12
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,936
just a nightmare.

13
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,273
Seems so real.

14
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,612
You know, partner, what we need
is a change a scenery.

15
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,531
Where'll we go?

16
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,825
Well, I don't know.

17
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,411
I guess we can figure
that one out when we get there.

18
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,584
Okay.

19
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,961
Well, get on upstairs,
get your gear together.

20
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,465
'Cause we leave
when the sun comes up.

21
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,970
[Thinking]
But I also found him.

22
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,142
The Tall Man.

23
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:18,990
[Gasps]

24
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,492
Boy!

[Roaring]

29
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,773
[Shrieking]
Ow! Ow! Ow!

30
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,128
[Whispers]
Shit.

31
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,760
[Growls]

32
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,456
[Whispers]
Burn, you son of a bitch.

33
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,806
Shit!

34
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,274
[Yelling]

35
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,378
Stay down, it's okay.

36
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,180
[Clunk]

37
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,351
[Female] I don't know
where he comes from...

38
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,354
maybe another dimension.

39
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,400
His army of creatures.

40
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,569
He destroys towns

41
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,239
and plunders their graveyards
to enslave the dead.

42
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,826
Each day, I can feel him
coming closer.

43
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,745
He knows I see him.

44
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,958
We've both seen what he can do.

45
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,052
Mike, we've grown up together.

46
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,140
I know you're out there.

47
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,018
Soon, my grandfather will die.

48
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,813
And my visions will become real.

49
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,656
I need you.

50
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,159
Mike, help me.

51
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,542
[Male groaning]

52
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,343
[Male] Well,
I guess you could say I just

53
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,721
really went over the deep end.

54
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,723
I mean, I got to the point
where I couldn't distinguish

55
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,141
fantasy from reality.

56
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,018
[Male voice]
That's good, keep it up.

57
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,146
And I don't blame Redge anymore.

58
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,106
I mean... what could he do?

59
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,858
I mean, the dreams were really
just taking hold of me.

60
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,610
[Male voice] Just tell him
what he wants to hear.

61
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:51,280
And besides,
since... I lost my family,

62
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,325
Redge is really the only...
person I've got.

63
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,702
- He's the only one that stood by me.
- I gotta get outta here.

64
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,037
She needs me.

65
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,079
And now that I'm not having
these dreams,

66
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,206
I'm really looking forward

67
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,458
to just moving back in with him
and getting on with my life.

68
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,584
There are a lot of things
I want to do.

69
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,213
It's been a tough seven years.

70
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,175
But you've come a long way.

71
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,471
Be well, Michael.

72
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,391
And remember...
it was all in your imagination.

73
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,231
The fuck it was.

74
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,163
[Clunk]

75
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,049
[Clunk]
Uh!

76
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,890
I was afraid I'd find ya here.

77
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,228
Come on, Mike.

78
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,771
Get up outta there.

79
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,274
This whole place is empty.

80
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,694
So, uh, come on,
lets' go home.

81
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,404
Look at this,
God damn it!

82
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,533
Now, that's the third one
I dug up!

83
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,662
Now, does it strike you
a little strange, Redge,

84
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,707
that every single corpse
in this entire graveyard's missing?

85
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,459
Well, what do you want, Mike?

86
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,173
I wanna stop him.

87
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,258
The Tall Man?

88
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,095
That story about me
blowing up my own house

89
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,764
because it was infested
with midgets.

90
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,726
Mike, that wasn't real.

91
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,563
Your doctor said it was
your own paranoid delusion.

92
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,357
Hey, fuck the doctors and fuck you too,
if you don't want to help me!

93
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,234
God damn it, Mike,
I've tried to help ya!

94
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,694
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

95
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,781
He showed me things.

96
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,119
I think he wants me
to come to him.

97
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,579
Why you?

98
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,205
I'm not the only one,
there's others.

99
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,583
There's a girl.

100
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,877
She's drawn to him too.

101
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,006
But I'm telling you, man,
without our help, she's gonna die.

102
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,092
He's gotta be stopped
and I'm going after him.

103
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,218
I know I can find him.

104
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,765
But to kill him

105
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,351
I'm gonna need your help.

106
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,979
[Whispering]
Shit, Mike.

107
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,607
If they catch you here
diggin' up graves,

108
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,692
they'll put you away
and you'll never get out again.

109
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,902
Come on back to the house.

110
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,862
Come on, man,
we can talk it out there.

111
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,744
[Redge]
Dinner's waitin' for ya.

112
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,498
Aunt Martha came down
and Celeste baked a turkey.

113
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,668
And you know, little Bonnie,

114
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,504
she just can't wait
to meet her Uncle Mike.

115
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,381
God, she's been talkin'
about it all day.

116

Man, she's really,
really high on seein' ya.

117

[Male voice]
Welcome home, boy.

118
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,767
Redge, we gotta get the people
outta your house, man!

119
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,852
The gas in there's gonna go off
and it's gonna blow!

120
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,062
Ah!

121
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,032
No, no, no!

122
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,075
Redge!

123
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,119
Get 'em out.
Gotta get 'em out!

124
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,162
Come on,
we gotta get 'em out!

125
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,164
No, no, no!

126
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,294
You couldn't save 'em.

127
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,667
You knew.

128
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,086
Before it happened.

129
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,672
I'm so sorry, Redge.

130
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,302
[Sighs]

131
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,220
Let's go, Mike.

132
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,389
We got things to do.

133
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,858
[Redge] Mike didn't need
to ask me anymore.

134
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,903
I enlisted for the duration.

135
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,155
[Engine whirs]

136
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,996
He told me it might take us years
to find the Tall Man.

137
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,499
And if we did,
we'd probably die.

138
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,002
Yeah, maybe.

139
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,046
But not without a fight.

140
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,994
Lets' go shopping.

141
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,742
Redge, long guns are no good.

142
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,954
Let's go to work.

143
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,208
This guy worked
at close range.

144
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,016
There's no use tryin'
to tell anybody.

145
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,770
They'd lock us up
and throw away the key.

146
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,234
We'd spent a long time
on the road.

147
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,860
Northwest mostly.

148
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,071
It wasn't hard
to pick up his trail.

149
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,741
Places he'd been
always look the same.

150
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,999
Small towns are like people.

151
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,710
Some get old
and die a natural death.

152
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,381
Some are murdered.

153

[Heavy breath]

We have to be careful.

'Cause sometimes
he sets traps for us.

156

Too damn late.

157
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,230
Let's get the tools
and scope it out.

158

[Chainsaw revs]

159
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,637
[Whispers]
I'll check it out.

160
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:04,930
All right, I'll go this way.

161

Down here, Mike.

00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:33,078
[Whispering]
Hey, Mike, he left one.

167
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,313
Who are you?

168
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,832
[Whimpering]

169
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,335
[Whispering]
Where do we find him?

170
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,764
Oh, my God.

171
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,977
Liz, what has he done to you?

172
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,855
[Whines]

173
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,232
Redge,

174
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:46,276
this is the one
I was telling you about...

175
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,944
the... the girl in my...

176
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,405
well...

177
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,951
[crackling]

178
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:05,336
Ohh, you play
a good game, boy.

179
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,756
Come east, if you dare.

180
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,175
Get the fuck back!

181
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,927
[Groaning]

182
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,354
[Redge]
It wasn't the first time

183
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,191
the Tall Man had left
one of his calling cards.

184
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:30,111
But that one was
the worst, so far.

185
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:34,032
He must know we're on his trail
because that hunchback apparition

186
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,784
looked just like the girl
in Mike's head.

187
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,204
We're moving east

188
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,122
toward the state line.

189
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:45,084
There's one more town...
Perigord.

190
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:50,131
[Female] I buried my grandchild
and both of my children.

191
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,509
Now my husband.

192
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,929
It's so hard to live past
the ones you love.

193
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,972
Hey, Grandma,

194
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,974
you still got me and Jeri, okay?

195
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:05,563
I don't see much of Jeri,
but how are you?

196
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,857
Are you still having
those nightmares?

197
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,484
Um, no.

198
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,110
No, not any more.

199
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,446
Oh, I can't.

200
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,949
You've gotta be strong, Grandma.

201
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,159
You know Grandpa
would have wanted it that way.

202
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,579
I'll try.

203
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:25,518
In the name
of the Father and the Son

204
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,812
and the Holy Spirit.

205
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,273
Amen.

206
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,051
I know how hard it is for you.

207
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,510
But remember,

208
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,513
he's left a life of pain
and trouble.

209
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,973
And he's gone to God.

210
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,684
He's going to rest now.

211
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,728
The last train leaves at six.

212
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,313
I've gotta be on it.

213
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,315
Damn it, Jeri,
I need you to be here.

214
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,400
With us.

215
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,110
Just one more day.

216
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,112
I have to get back
to Bruce and Stevie.

217
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,323
I've gotta get going now.

218
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,824
It's 20 miles back
to the station.

219
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,453
[Whispering] Besides,
Grandma's a tough cookie.

220
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,621
Thanks, Jeri.

I'm sorry, hon,
I really do have to go.

Look, if there's
any problem, just call.

Okay?

It's not a dream.

00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,624
she's in danger.

Who?

234
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,794
The other, the girl.

235
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,755
Well, you said that
six months ago.

236
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:01,090
Yeah, well,
this time I'm certain.

237
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,469
We're close to her
and the Tall Man.

Come on, let's go.

Geez, I slept half
the day away.

240

I don't know, man, you say she's here,
you say she's there.

241
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,816
She's everywhere.

242
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:21,986
So, maybe so.

243
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,864
But I'm still not so sure
she's not just a wet dream.

244
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,950
Listen, Redge,

245
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,535
we're close.

246
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,120
And soon,
I'm gonna find her.

Oh, sorry to startle you, pal.

this girl's in my dreams.

Except, when she's in 'em,
she's dead.

295
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:55,267
I think, for her sake,
she shouldn't get involved with us.

Well, your dreams
always come true?

have you looked at her?

You know,

it gets hard on the road.

with your wrong head.

Okay, okay.

with us or without us.

Or at least with us
we can protect her, right?

to find a place to hold up.
