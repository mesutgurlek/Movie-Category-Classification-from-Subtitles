What are we like?

502
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,407
It was God chose us
to be this way.

503
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,561
If we don't do as He asks,

504

You can't hide a doubtful
mind from Him, honey.

507

Doc Barrow: Oh, excuse me.

520
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,641
Hey, Doc.

521
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,960
Mr. Anders.

522
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,846
What kind of bone
do you think that is?

523
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,251
Where'd you find this?

524
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,810
It washed down at the creek,

525
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,160
behind my house.

526
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,531
It's definitely not a deer.

527
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,285
My dad would have known,
he was real good with bones.

528
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,521
In my humble opinion,

529
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,171
I believe it's human remains.

530
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,451
Well... in that case...

531
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,881
I'll take your word for it.

532
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,200
You're a doctor.

533
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,728
Well, I'm here because
I went by to see Meeks.

534
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,040
I told him.

535
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,524
He just thinks
I'm some kind of a nutcase.

536
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,884
And he may be right.

537
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,764
But there's been three people
missing from this town

538
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,246
in the last 20 years,

539
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,481
one of which was my daughter.

540
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,721
I know.

541
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,086
I remember.

542
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,402
I was on the search party.

543
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,720
I know.

544
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,562
But if you extend the radius,

545
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,888
including
the towns within 50 miles,

546
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,883
there are 30 people
or more missing,

547
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,849
none of which
have been found.

548

I'm just a deputy.

549

Well, I know,
I'm just trying to help out.

550
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,006
I thought maybe it'd be
useful information.

551
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,410
A lot of good folk
in this town.

552

Dr. Barrow.

1009

Mr. Parker.

1010

You hungry, Doc?

1011
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,280
We have plenty.

No, thank you.

Well...

It's rather delicate.

1016
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,606
Leave me and the doctor
to have some privacy.

01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:15,010
How long have you had that
hand tremor, Mr. Parker?

1022
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:22,331
You didn't come here
to discuss my health,

1023
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,280
did you, Doc?

1024

No, I didn't.

1032
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:46,491
This morning.

1033
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,288
But he left.

1034
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:04,844
Is there anything else?

1035
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:07,930
Yes, as a matter of fact.

1036
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,888
Your wife suffered...

1037
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:16,050
from a rare disorder of
prion disease.

1038
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:22,123
It's usually found in

1039
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,123
the native tribes
of New Guinea.

1040
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,450
And it comes from
eating human flesh.

1041
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,284
(thunder rumbling)
No, no...

1042

What?

Your daughter's
wearing a hair clasp.

It was a gift to my girl
