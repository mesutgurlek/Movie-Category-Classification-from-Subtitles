not only because of the meticulously
collected physical evidence, um,

00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,000
So I believe, as a child,

486
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,520
Adam Saber began carrying around
a mental picture of David

487
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,480
so that no matter where he went,
no matter how horrific things became,

488
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,440
there was always someone
who had it worse -

489
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,320
David Bernburg
who was tortured to death

490
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,200
by Satan-worshipping
mountain witches.

491
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,960
But to benefit from this mental image,

492
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,040
he must be fully aware of it

493
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,396
and therefore
cannot be disassociated.

494
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,959
That is a very compelling diagnosis.
Thank you very much.

495
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,760
How are you gonna prove it?

Oh, oh, Dad, I'm not gonna prove it.

497

I'm gonna cure it.

Why do you do this to me?

630
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,680
Because you 've stopped
asking questions.

That's all I do, Dad.
No, no!

You 've stopped asking questions
of yourself, Caroline!

You 've developed
this fixed system of beliefs

which you refuse to submit
to any kind of introspection.

636
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,240
So what that means is
that you will never have

00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,160
a new thought in your professional life.

638
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,400
You have got to learn to
take those ideas, set them to one side

639
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,480
and try to move ahead with
one big question, which is, "Why?"!

640
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,360
And simply ask, "What?"
To just say, "I don't know."

641
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,400
Just because you 're older,
it doesn't mean you 're right.

642
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,595

What has been your motivation here?

644
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,400
Has it been to help Adam
to discover whatever...

645

...crisis it is that caused him
to fracture his psyche?

646
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:09,230
Or has it been to simply flat out
prove me wrong?

647

Honey!

651
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,760
OK, so, Wesley Crite was a frontman
for an underground rock band.

652
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,760
He died November 1994.

653
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,520
It was a possible suicide.

654
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:57,640
At this exact point,
Adam Saber is in prison.

655

He's just been placed
in solitary confinement.

656
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,880
So at this low, low moment in his life,

657
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,032
he assumes yet another person
who has a story worse than his own.

658

999
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,560
The Reverend Christian Moore.

1000
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,760
He was a self-proclaimed faith healer

1001
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,000
and he told the Holler folks that

1002
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,160
they didn't need their voodoo medicine.

1003

Just faith in the Lord.

1004
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,960
And he had a good number of Holler folk

1005
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,032
turn their backs on the Granny.

1006
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:31,640
You see, he used, as an example,
his own two children.

1007
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:36,040
They were full of health
and apparently immune

to the ravages of the disease.

1009
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:45,160
And they were strange children,
as I remember. Quiet.

1010

Turns out that their silence
was for a good reason.

1011
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:53,080
The Reverend had lost his faith

1012
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:58,760
and he had had his own kin inoculated
against the disease,

1013
