We got to get to the party.

Ben, this is a suicide mission.

bomb this whole town

Then what?

The police? They're gone.

Guys, we're the last line of defense.

And so what? Maybe we look
like dorks in these uniforms.

I thought I wanted out,
but I was just worried

what other people were gonna think.
The truth is,

it's the reason I met you guys.
