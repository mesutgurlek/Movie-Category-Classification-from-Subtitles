- Yes.
- Good.

Truth is very seldom understood

to the attic, perhaps.

624
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,940
- Alone.
- [ Laughs ]

625
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:09,035
- Is that all? They'll come to no harm.
- I can't.

626
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,047
I can't leave them alone,
not after the other night.

627
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,050
As for the other night, miss,
put it out of your mind.

628
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:18,553
- Pretend it was part of a dream,
which perhaps it was.
- A dream?

629
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,557
Don't you think
I want to believe that?

630
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,059
That it was just the darkness,
a nightmare?

631
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:28,222
But it's no longer dark.
It's daylight. And I know I saw him.

632
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,563
A man, or something
that once was a man...

633
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,105
peering in through the window,
looking for someone.

634
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:38,106
And if it isn't true,
if I didn't see him...

635
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,109
how could I have described him
so accurately?

636
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:44,442
Well,you had
seen his picture.

637
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:48,450
Really, miss, you're upsetting yourself
over nothing.

638
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,452
You said he was the valet?

639
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,454
Yes, but when the master left...

640
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:54,456
Quint was alone with us,
in charge.

641
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:57,459
Tell me, how did he die?

642
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,461
Quint?

643
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:02,396
Out there, miss,
on those very steps.

644
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:04,399
It was winter.

645
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,402
The coldest,
blackest winter's night.

646
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:09,404
The steps were icy.

647
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:12,407
Quint, he came home late,
after we were all abed.

648
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,409
Late, and full of drink.

649
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:17,412
There was a wound on his head,
as if he'd slipped...

650
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,642
as if he'd fallen
out there in the dark.

651
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,651
I can't forget his eyes.

652
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,881
They were open,
filled with surprise...

653
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:29,982
with pain, like the eyes of a fox
I once saw-

654
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:32,995
a fox the dogs had hunted down.

655
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,463
But it was an accident?

656
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,466
He was a peculiar man.

657
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,969
There were things in his life
that could account for violence done him...

658
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,971
vicious things-

659
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,406
Well, it doesn't do
to speak ill of the dead.

660
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,410
The children
never mention him?

661
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,640
Oh, no, miss, and neither must you-
not to them.

662
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,650
You see, miss, it was Master Miles
that found him.

663
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,652
Oh, that poor little boy.

664
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,654
If you could have
heard his screams...

665
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,589
seen the way he clung to him
and begged him to speak-

666
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,751
That poor little boy
worshipped Quint.

667
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:07,763
Worshipped him?
That man? Miles?

668
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:10,527
You didn't know Quint, miss.

669
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,432
Such power he had over people.

670
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,437
You can't blame the child.

671
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,439
A lonely boy with no father.

672
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,441
Quint took advantage,
that's all.

673
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:22,671
It made me sick to see
Miles trotting after him like a little dog.

674
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,680
They were always together.

675
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,315
- ##[ Music Box ]
- [ Miles ] Quiet, everyone.

676
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,680
- ##[ Music Box ]
- [ Miles ] Quiet, everyone.

677
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,446
The entertainment
is about to commence.

678
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,044
Oh, look, miss.

679
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,556
I borrowed your pin cushion.

680
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,785
I hope you don't mind.

681
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:41,396
Miss Giddens, dear,
would you sit there?

682
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:44,797
And, Mrs. Grose,
would you sit there too?

683
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,341
And now Miles will recite to you.

684
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:57,076
A poem.

685
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:01,311
What shall I sing to my lord
from my window?

686
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:04,854
What shall I sing,
for my lord will not stay?

687
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:08,891
What shall I sing,
for my lord will not listen?

688
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,758
Where shall I go,
for my lord is away?

689
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,698
Whom shall I love
when the moon is arisen?

690
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:20,235
Gone is my lord...

691
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:23,067
and the grave is his prison.

692
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:27,234
What shall I say
when my lord comes a-calling?

693
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:31,440
What shall I say
when he knocks on my door?

694
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:36,178
What shall I say
when his feet enter softly...

695
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:40,347
leaving the marks
ofhis grave on my floor?

696
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,448
Enter, my lord.

697
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,187
Come from your prison.

698
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:48,196
Come from your grave...

699
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:51,199
for the moon is arisen.

700
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,701
[ Whispers ]
Welcome, my lord.

701
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,046
[ Whispers ]
Look at that.

702
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,548
- What, miss?
- I was afraid for them.

703
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:10,552
But what if he knows?
What if Miles knows?

704
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,555
Knows what,
Miss Giddens, dear?

705
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,557
You think I'm imagining it...

706
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,560
and yet just now you yourself saw
and heard Miles-

707
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,062
Playing a game.

708
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:24,065
You told me
Quint and Miles were always together.

709
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:26,067
But Master Miles
wasn't to blame for that.

710
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:29,070
- Yes, but couldn't you have stopped it?
- I wasn't in charge, miss.

711
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:32,005
It wasn't for me to question
the master's arrangements.

712
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,009
The master
put Quint in charge here.

713
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:37,569
Besides, no one
could go against Quint.

714
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,583
You were afraid of him?

715
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:46,087
But what of Miss Jessel?

716
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,089
Couldn't she
have done something?

717
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,591
Or was she afraid of him too?

718
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,594
Not at first.
At least-

719
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:57,190
In the beginning, when she first came here,
she was always happy and smiling.

720
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,201
Very fond of music she was...

721
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,134
and dancing.

722
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:05,072
She and Miss Flora used to dance together,
dance by the hour.

723
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,075
But she changed.

724
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,077
Oh, yes, she changed.

725
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,079
'Twas hard to believe...

726
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:14,082
her being an educated young lady
and Quint being...

727
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:16,584
- [ Miles Laughing ]
- well, what he was.

728
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,587
[ Flora Screaming ]
Stop it, Miles.! Stop it.!

729
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,589
You see? I knew
they'd be overexcited.

730
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,591
It's long past their bedtime.

731
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:25,594
Yes, but what did you mean
about Quint and Miss Jessel?

732
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:28,130
Look, miss, they're dead, gone.

733
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,723
There's no point in telling tales
of what's over and done with.

734
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,775
Over and done with?

735
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,780
Yes, but is it?

736
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:12,575
[ Flora, Miles Laughing ]

737
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:17,044
[ Miles ]
Let go, Flora. You'll fall in.

738
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,240
[ Flora ]
But I want to row the boat.

739
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,374
Silly.
You know you can't.

740
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:24,045
Miss Giddens, tell Miles
to let me row.

741
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:26,554
I will,
when you're a little older.

742
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,886
But it's too heavy
for you now.

743
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:32,291
I don't care.
I've got a boat of my own anyway.

744
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:36,064
[ Goose Honking ]

745
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,066
[ Sighs ]

746
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,966
Heavenly, warm sun.

747
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,971
It's almost hot.

748
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,974
I like it when it's hot.

749
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:49,477
- Do you know what Miles told me once?
- No, dear. What?

750
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:53,037
He said that once, when he was on the lake,
he could see a hand waving on the bottom.

751
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,813
But Mrs. Grose said,
"Stuff and nonsense.! Stuff and nonsense.!''

752
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:05,093
Miss Giddens,
can tortoises swim?

753
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,095
No, dear.

754
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,165
I thought
perhaps they couldn't.

00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:24,247
Flora, where did you
learn that song?

758
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,709
I don't think I remember.

## [ Resumes Humming ]

760
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:35,082
It's the song
from the music box, isn't it?

761
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,785
Isn't it?

Over there.

766
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:46,457
Oh, goodness, miss, you gave me
quite a turn sitting there in the dark.

767
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:50,624
- And where are the children?
- Upstairs with Anna.

768
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:54,932
I wanted to be by myself
for a while, to think.

769
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:58,838
Well, miss, I'm sure a little light
will make your thoughts more cheerful.

770
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:03,709
Mrs. Grose?
There are two of them.

771
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,804
I beg your pardon?

772
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:10,216
Two of those abominations.

00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:15,549
Today, down by the lake...

00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,457
there in the broad sunlight...

775
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,621
I saw the other one.

776
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,530
- The other one?
- A woman dressed in black.

777
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:29,003
- Miss Jessel.
- Oh, but Miss Jessel's dead.

778
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,835
She died, why, almost a year ago.

779
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:35,241

in Master Miles wanting to be with Quint.

Perhaps it is, but to hear such filth
from a child's mouth...

- I never heard her speak like it before. Never.

Has she mentioned it?
Mentioned Miss Jessel?

1153
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:11,014
- Only to say there was no one there.
- You pretended to believe her.

I didn't have to pretend.

1155

Well, how can you say that?

1156

As though you-you too
were a complete innocent?

Well,you lived here.
You knew those two.

You knew them when they were alive,
and what influence they were on the children.

And it frightened you.
When I came here, you were still frightened.

Oh, you were.
I sensed it. And why?

1161

Because you felt
they weren't really dead.

but he wanted to.

and ask for my help.

And we must give him that chance.
Don't you understand that?

I doubt I shall ever understand you.

It was a cruel thing.
And if you're planning another cruelty-

is that a cruelty?

as many children as I have...

1189
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:07,658
you'd know that waking a child can sometimes
be worse than any bad dream.

- No.
- It's the shock.

The real reason, Miles.

It's beyond me why you go on asking
a fellow questions...

when every time he answers you
you tell him it isn't true.

1274
01:32:29,911 --> 01:32:32,311
Because you are not
telling the truth.

Don't shout.
Don't be so angry.

I'm not a cruel person.

I'm sometimes very foolish
and I make mistakes...

but I'm not cruel.

1282
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:56,663
My father taught me
to love people and help them.

Help them even if
they refuse my help.

Even if it hurt them sometimes.

And that's the only reason
I'm here is to help you.

It must be because I'm different.

You thanked my uncle
for trusting you.

You apologized for troubling him...

1308

for asking him to come down.

Go on, Miles.
What else did I say?

1310

That's all I read. I heard footsteps.
I threw it on the fire.

And did you take other things?

No, I'm not a thief.
