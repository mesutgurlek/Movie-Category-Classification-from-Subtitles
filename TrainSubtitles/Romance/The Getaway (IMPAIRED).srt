I can't. I-I've gotta watch the front desk. You know how it goes.

-How much money you make last year? -Twelve thousand.

1110
01:50:45,610 --> 01:50:49,569
I'll tell ya, I'll give ya 20,000 for the truck.

1111
01:50:49,612 --> 01:50:51,705
Are ya serious?

1112
01:50:53,514 --> 01:50:55,482
I sure am.

1113
01:50:57,684 --> 01:51:01,176
Whew! And, uh, I keep my mouth shut,

1114
01:51:01,285 --> 01:51:03,685
and I don't say nothin' about the truck.

1115
01:51:03,787 --> 01:51:05,982
I've never seen you two before. Right?

1116
01:51:06,021 --> 01:51:08,421
You got it.

1117
01:51:08,490 --> 01:51:10,890
Could, uh... Could you make it 30?

1118
01:51:10,924 --> 01:51:13,119
[Laughing]

1119
01:51:13,226 --> 01:51:16,753
-How about 40? -Damn!

1120
01:51:16,863 --> 01:51:20,890
Ma'am, you got a deal. She's all yours.

1121
01:51:20,965 --> 01:51:24,560
You're gonna have to make your own way back to the border, though.

1122
01:51:24,666 --> 01:51:27,066
Oh, I'll make it. Don't worry about me.

1123
01:51:27,168 --> 01:51:31,070
Vaya con Dios. Same to you.

1124
01:51:34,072 --> 01:51:36,233
She's a good old truck.

1125
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:40,835
She won't win any races, but she'll run forever.

1126
01:51:40,876 --> 01:51:45,176
-I just put new brakes in her. -Good.

1127
01:51:45,246 --> 01:51:48,238
-Y'all take care, ya hear? -Yeah.

1128
01:51:52,583 --> 01:51:54,676
Damn! [Laughs]

1129
01:51:54,785 --> 01:51:57,686
Adi¨®s, amigos!

1130
01:52:07,091 --> 01:52:09,651
[Grunts]

1131
01:52:09,692 --> 01:52:11,990
[Laughing]

1132
01:52:13,995 --> 01:52:15,963
Goddamn!

1133
01:52:28,970 --> 01:52:32,997
Whenever I'm weary

1134
01:52:33,072 --> 01:52:38,908
From the battles that rage in my head

1135
01:52:41,311 --> 01:52:45,213
You make sense of madness

1136
01:52:45,313 --> 01:52:51,309
When my sanity hangs by a thread

1137
01:52:53,919 --> 01:52:57,218
I lose my way but still

1138
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:02,917
You seem to understand

1139
01:53:03,024 --> 01:53:06,516
Now and forever

1140
01:53:08,127 --> 01:53:12,826
I will be your man

1141
01:53:17,998 --> 01:53:22,935
Sometimes I just hold you

1142
01:53:23,035 --> 01:53:28,302
Too caught up in me to see

1143
01:53:30,506 --> 01:53:34,840
I'm holding a fortune

1144
01:53:34,908 --> 01:53:40,540
That heaven has given to me

1145
01:53:43,113 --> 01:53:45,911
I'll try to show you

1146
01:53:45,949 --> 01:53:52,252
Each and every way I can

1147
01:53:52,352 --> 01:53:55,947
Now and forever

1148
01:53:57,355 --> 01:54:01,815
I will be your man

1149
01:54:04,726 --> 01:54:08,661
Now I can rest my worries

1150
01:54:08,661 --> 01:54:12,324
And always be sure

1151
01:54:12,663 --> 01:54:15,723
That I won't be alone

1152
01:54:15,765 --> 01:54:18,962
Anymore

1153
01:54:19,068 --> 01:54:23,528
If I'd only known you were there

1154
01:54:23,670 --> 01:54:26,468
All the time

1155
01:54:26,571 --> 01:54:32,976
All this time

1156
01:54:56,990 --> 01:55:01,188
Until the day the ocean

1157
01:55:01,259 --> 01:55:06,026
Doesn't touch the sand

1158
01:55:06,095 --> 01:55:09,724
Now and forever

1159
01:55:11,231 --> 01:55:16,225
I will be your man

1160
01:55:18,435 --> 01:55:22,132
Now and forever

1161
01:55:23,538 --> 01:55:27,998
I will be

1162
01:55:28,041 --> 01:55:33,138
Your man
