right in their hands.

615
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,750
Have you any connections
with Manchester?

616
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,149
We have a lot of good connections
in England.

617
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,959
- Actually...
- I mean, with the Manchester people.

618
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,510
Please, we are here to discuss the merger.
Let us begin at the beginning.

619
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,669
PREYSING: Thank you.

620
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,352
Is Baron von Geigern in?

621
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,675
Too bad.

622
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,718
PREYSING: Since June 11 this year,
when the first negotiation...

623
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,949
I met him yesterday.

624
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,634
PREYSING: Between
our respective firms...

625
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,909
I’ve got a date.

626
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,513
PREYSING: This merger can result...

627
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,033
About 5:00.

628
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,838
PREYSING: All of us.
FLAEMM: Dancing.

629
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,872
GERSTENKORN: Tell us about Manchester.
PREYSING: Just a second.

630
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,389
Before I get through,
I’m laying before you here...

631
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,675
the last general statement of the concern.

632
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,354
The capital, the plant, the machinery...

633
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,597
For instance, we'll take mop rags.

634
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,319
FLAEMM: I'll call back.
GERSTENKORN: Tell us about Manchester.

635
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,755
Yes, Mr. Preysing,
that's what we want to know.

636
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,229
I would rather wait for Justice Zinnowitz...

637
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,914
before I commit myself, please.

638
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,432
Now, to go ahead with the merger.

639
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,155
You realize...

640
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,711
that this merger is a great advantage
to the Saxonians, of course.

641
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,831
Now, let's talk like adults.

642

- When you first approached us...
- We did not approach you.

643

MAN: This letter filed in September
exhibits you approached us.

644
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,312
That letter is a response
to a tentative feeler sent out by you.

645
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,152
Tentative, my foot!

646
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,310
A month before this,
your old father-in-law...

647
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,029
- comes to me privately, and scratches...
- Scratched?

648
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,839
PREYSING: We didn't take the initiative!
GERSTENKORN: You did...

649
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,514
PREYSING: We did not!
GERSTENKORN: You did!

650
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,239
Gentlemen, I see the conference
has already begun.

651
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,312
- I'm glad you're here, Justice Zinnowitz.
- Good morning.

652
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,432
ZINNOWITZ: Thank you very much.
PREYSING: I beg your pardon, please.

653
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,593
Excuse me, please. I am glad you're here.

654
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,828
These gentlemen have cross words.
Would you try, Justice Zinnowitz...

655
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,990
- and iron out the situation here?
- Certainly.

656
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,116
- Right here, on the top.
- If you will allow me.

657
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,235
Thank you.

658
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,956
Well, gentlemen, the situation
seems to be perfectly clear.

659
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,112
- Yes. And how clear is Manchester?
- Manchester?

660
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,668
ZINNOWITZ: Have you said anything
about Manchester?

661
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,469
Why, no, sir. I cannot commit myself
at this time about Manchester.

662
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,917
Quite right. Well, gentlemen,
since June 11 of this year...

663
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,759
when the first negotiations for a merger
were entered...

664
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,274
Now we're going to begin
at the beginning again.

665
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,237
As you remember it,
when you approached us...

666
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,278
GERSTENKORN: We did not approach you.
PREYSING: I'm sorry, you did!

667
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,351
GERSTENKORN: We did not approach you.

668
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,715
GERSTENKORN: You approached us!
ZINNOWITZ: Wait.

669
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,720
Can you imagine 100 girls
in a ballet school...

670
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,713
each thinking she would become
the most famous dancer in the world?

671
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,118
I was ambitious then.

672
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,795
We were drilled like little soldiers.
No rest, no stopping.

673
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,475
I was little, slim, but hard as a diamond.

674
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,916
Then I became famous soon.

675
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,429
But why am I telling you all this?

676
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,629
Last night I didn't know you at all.

677
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,398
- Who are you, really?
- What?

678
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,516
I don't even know your name.

My mother called me Flix.

682
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,110
No. Flix.

683
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,078
That's sweet.

684
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,636
And how do you live?
What kind of person are you?

685
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,709
I'm a prodigal son,
the black sheep of a white flock.

686
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,039
I shall die on the gallows.

- Really.

688
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,638
I haven't a bit of character. None at all.

689

- No?
- No. Really.

690
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,871
You know, when I was a little boy
I was taught to ride and be a gentleman.

691
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,670
Then at school, to pray and lie.

692
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,352
And then in the war, to kill and hide.

693
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,159
That's all.

694
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,311
And what do you do now?

695
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,110
Now I’m a gambler...

that pleases me.

BARON: I'm also a criminal
and a hotel thief.

That's not a funny joke.

No.

That's horrible.

I don't want them.

That's why I wanted your pearls.

Yesterday?

922
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,997
No, perhaps not.

923
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,916
I fell in love last night.

924
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,999
The real thing.

925
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,989
There's no real thing. It just doesn't exist.

926
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,509
I thought that, too.

927
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,870
But now I know that it does.

928
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,752
It's wonderful.

929
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,313
Come along.

930
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,710
- Dance with old Kringelein?
- Of course. Anything for you.

931
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,630
BARON: You're sweet.

932
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,270
Here you are. I must speak with you.

933
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,796
- Presently, Mr. Preysing.
- No, now. This is very urgent.

934
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,111
This lady has urgent business with me
at the moment.

935
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,309
PREYSING: Insolence. Berlin manners.

936
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,110
Good evening, Mr. Preysing.
You're staying here, too?

937
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,193
- I'm sorry, but I cannot place you.
- Kringelein, at the plant.

938
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,793
One of our agents.

No. Assistant bookkeeper,
Room 23, Building C, third floor.

940
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,436
- I am away, sick.
- That's very interesting.

941
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,108
Good day.

[Band playing swing music]

943
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,949
FLAEMM: Would you like to dance,
Mr. Kringelein?

944
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,270
Miss Flaemm, I’ve never danced in public.

945
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,272
- Come along and try it.
- I'd be afraid.

946
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,954
There's nothing to be afraid of.
You'll love it.

947
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:17,035
Miss Flaemmchen, I must speak to you.
This is about a dictating job.

948
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:20,237
- When do we start? Tomorrow morning?
- No, right now.

949
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,390
We were just going to dance.

950
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,278
Do you know each other?
Mr. Kringelein, Mr. Preysing.

951
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,833
Mr. Kringelein would be a good friend
and not accept your invitation to dance.

952
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,871
I couldn't think of not accepting
the invitation to dance.

953
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,950
I understood you to say
that you reported to our plant ill...

954
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,952
and you're here in Berlin
indulging in diversions...

955
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,190
which are very much beyond your means?

956
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,199
This is very extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein.

957
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,111
I think we should look over your books.

958
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,158
Come along now, children. No fighting.
Save that for the office.

959
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,435
Does the world belong to you,
Mr. Preysing?

960
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,158
Haven't I got any right to live?

961
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,912
I will wait 10 minutes for you.

962
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,151
If you're not back, it will be necessary
to engage someone else.

963
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,071
BARON: What happened to your dance?

964
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,628
We're going now, thank you, Baron.
Come along.

965
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,908
I shall remember this, Mr. Kringelein.

966
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,197
Let the poor devil alone.
Death's staring him in the face.

967
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,510
I did not ask your advice.

968
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,470
I think you'd better go away.

969
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,949
We will see
who will remain here the longer.

970
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,076
BELLBOY: Baron von Geigern, please.

971
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,513
Mr. Kringelein, you must look at my face,
and not the floor.

972
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,669
Yes.

973
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:41,038
- Why, you're trembling.
- I never danced in public before.

974
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,834
- You dance beautifully.
- Thank you.

975
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,913
- That's right.
- I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.

976
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,831
Are you really?

977
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,719
For the first time in my life, I’m happy.

978
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,993
Are you all right?

979
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:59,152
Yes. Excuse me, I just stopped a second.

980
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,071
FLAEMM: All right. Here we go.

981
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,398
I'm very tired. Do you mind if we stop?

982
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,913
OTTO: Thank you.

983
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,915
- I must go back to Mr. Preysing now.
- Must you?

984
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,753
Yes, business.
One has to earn a living, you know.

985
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,592
Not you, Miss Flaemm.

986
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:27,148
Just another desk slave. Money.

987
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,270
PREYSING: I'm glad you're here.
FLAEMM: Here I am.

988
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,351
- Did you enjoy your dance?
- Yes, thank you.

989
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,193
- Excuse me. Go away, please.
- Where's the Louisiana Flip?

990
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,158
- Would you like a little cognac?
- Yes. You wanted to see me?

991
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,357
PREYSING: Yes.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.

992
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:45,149
Mr. Preysing, I am not taking orders
from you here.

993
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,151
What is this insolence? Please go away.

to be insulting?

996

1000
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:06,036
- Go away, please. You are annoying.
- You don't like to see me enjoying myself.

1001
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,556
When a man's working himself to death,
that's what he's paid for.

1002
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,473
You don't care if a man
can live on his wages or not.

1003
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,599
You have a very regular scale of wages,
and there's the sick fund for you.

1004
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,399
OTTO: What a scale, and what a fund.

1005
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,357
When I was sick for four weeks...

1006
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,749
you wrote me a letter
telling me I’d be discharged...

1007
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,637
if I were sick any longer.

1008
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,517
Did you write me that letter or not?

1009
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,478
I have no idea of the letters that I write.

1010
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,552
I know that you are here
in the Grand Hotel, living like a lord.

1011

You are probably an embezzler.

- An embezzler!
- Yes, an embezzler.

1013
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,515
You are going to take that back!

1014

Right here in the presence
of this young lady!

Who do you think you're talking to?
You think I’m dirt?

You can't discharge me. I'm sick.

I'm going to die. You understand?

1031
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:38,312
I'm going to die, and nobody
can do anything to me anymore.

1032

Nothing can happen to me anymore.

1033
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:46,110
Before I can be discharged, I’ll be dead!

1034
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:53,037

I don't know him. He's annoying.

- Excuse me.

- Poor old Kringelein. You're all right.

1038

- Give him some whiskey.
- No.

You wanted to see me?

01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,115
Yes. Pardon me. I must go to England.

1053
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:56,510
It's very important. I must go at once.
I have some very big deals...

involving hundreds of thousands
of marks...

1055

and I thought
I would take along a secretary...

01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,269
to take care of my correspondence.

1057
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,998
You know what I mean.

1058
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,072
I understood you to say
that you travelled and...

for such a trip?

PREYSING: Yes.

I don't know. I'd have to figure it up.

1064

I'd need clothes and shoes...

Yes, I thought you would.

01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,076
Would you like me
to get you a room here...

1072
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,350
at the hotel? Now?

1073
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,510
PREYSING: And that would...
FLAEMM: Hello, Baron.

1074
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,876
- Would you please pay some attention?
- I'm paying attention.

1075
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,994
BARON: How do you do?
PREYSING: Insolence.

1076
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,354
You mean the Baron?

1077
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,876
PREYSING: Baron what?
BARON: What?

1078
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,072
He's a gentleman.

1079
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,510
Is the Baron tired?

1080
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,358
No, not tired exactly.

1081
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,318
I thought this evening
we could go to the casino.

1082
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,551
That place we passed
with the wonderful bright lights.

1083
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,990
Kringelein, I’d adore it.
I can't go anywhere.

1084
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,156
- What?
- I'm broke.

1085
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,910
- No, you're joking.
- Yes. Isn't it odd?

1086
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,996
A baron, broke.

1087
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,758
Excuse me, old man.

1088
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,673
- I quit.
- You can't.

1089
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,751
I'm not getting those pearls,
neither are you.

1090
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,637
- What about the money?
- I'll pay you back.

1091
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,518
- How?
- I have an idea working in my head.

1092
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,750
You might find a bullet through that head.

1093
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,310
If you do that you'll get nothing,
except maybe the police after you.

1094
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,794
MAN: Mme. Grusinskaya's car!

1095
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,873
If you wait, I’ll pay you back your 5,000...

1096
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,432
I’ll see you later.

1097
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,633
Go on, Suzette.

1098
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,788
Are you coming to the theater?
I shall dance tonight. How I shall dance!

1099
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,836
I want to feel that you're there.

1100
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,991
<i>I came too far.</i>

1101
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,118
- I'm worried about you.
- Don't be.

1102
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,758
- You'll be on the train?
- Yes.

1103
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,831
- Until then.
- Bless you.

1104
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,913
- Was the Baron joking?
- What?

1105
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,629
- Is it really true?
- What are you talking about, Kringelein?

1106
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,792
Is the Baron really in financial straits?

1107
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,514
To tell you the truth, I must get
some money somehow right away.

1108
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,831
- If the Baron will permit me.
- What?

1109
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:43,119
I'd be awfully glad to oblige.
You've been very decent to me.

1110
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,315
Three hundred?

1111
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,869
If I could get into a game of some kind,
I think I might win.

1112
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,834
Gambling! I'd love that!

1113
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,390
I've got over 6,800 marks right here.

1114
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,436
If we could scare up some men to play.

1115
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,751
- We could go up to my room.
- That's a grand idea.

1116
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,195
Come on.

1117
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,512
- Cab, miss?
- What?

1118
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,592
- Cab?
- No, thanks. I'll walk.

1119
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,156
BARON: 4,000 marks.
DEALER: 4,000!

1120
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,150
BARON: Too high?

1121
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,113
DEALER: 4,000 marks.

1122
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,838
DEALER: Want a card?
BARON: Please.

1123
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,114
Thanks.

1124
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,480
PLAYER #1: 8,000 marks.
OTTO: 8,000!

1125
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,269
BARON: I take it all.
PLAYER #2: That's a lot of money.

1126
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,272
I need it, thanks.

1127
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,632
DEALER: Want a card?
BARON: Please.

1128
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,353
Baccarat.

1129
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,668
PLAYER #2: Too bad there.

1130
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,751
[Men chattering]

1131
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,593
- Now, Mr. Kringelein.
- Baron!

1132
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,756
Will you help me again, please?

1133
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,035
I think you'd better help me, Kringelein.

1134
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,317
- Make your bets, gentlemen.
- How much shall I bet?

1135
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,678
BARON: How much is left in the bank?
BANKER: 2,500 uncovered.

1136
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,553
- Do you feel like going that far?
- All that money, Baron?

1137
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:37,189
Come on, you're killing them tonight.
Go ahead, old man.

1138
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,349
Do you want a card?

1139
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,919
What have you got?

1140
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,030
The old highwayman. He has nine again.

1141
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,555
I win again!

1142
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,112
Come on, gentlemen. Please drink! Drink.

1143
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,470
It's wonderful and sweet champagne!

1144
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,348
Mr. Kringelein, care to take the bank?

1145
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,989
Yes! Surely. I'll take everything.
I'll take anything.

1146
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:03,993
Come on, now. Drink, gentlemen.
Please drink some champagne.

1147
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,911
It's expensive and good.

1148
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,156
What will I take the bank for?

1149
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,073
- I'll play for 500.
- Baron, all at once?

1150
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,434
Suppose you lose it?

1151
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,398
It's all the same thing, Kringelein.
Come on, now, old man.

1152
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,909
Deal me two cards.

1153
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,878
One to me first. One to yourself.

1154
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,037
One to me. One to yourself.

1155
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,349
Baron, if all that money...

1156
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,751
What have you got?

1157
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,594
I've got a nine!

1158
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,238
Isn't that a wonderful thing?

1159
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,154
Kringelein, you old robber,
you're hopeless.

1160
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,911
Baron! Baron, please.

1161
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:47,080
It's no use, old man. It's sweet of you...

1162
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,674
- but you have all the luck.
- It's true.

1163
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,673
I have luck, for the first time in my life!
I have luck!

1164
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:59,116
Baron, are you out?
Have you finished playing?

1165
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,599
Yes, thank you.

1166
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:04,719
I'll recover again presently,
in 10 or 20 years.

1167
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,917
OTTO: Look, Doctor. I've won again!

1168
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,353
PLAYER #3: There you are.

1169
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:13,194
OTTO: Baron, I win and drink,
and drink and win!

1170
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,873
Gentlemen, please don't go.

1171
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:21,077
Be my guests. Don't go. I beg your pardon.

1172
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:25,551
I know I oughtn't to presume,
but I’m so grateful to you.

1173
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,278
It's been so marvelous.

1174
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:31,956
For the first time in my life,
I’ve gambled and I’ve danced.

1175
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,792
You gentlemen can laugh...

1176
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:37,668
but for the first time in my life,
I’ve tasted life!

1177
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,673
- Splendid!
- Life is wonderful, but it's very dangerous.

1178
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,752
<i>If you have the courage to live it,</i>
<i>it's marvelous.</i>

1179
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,749
PLAYER #4: Wonderful!
OTTO: You don't know about that.

1180
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,469
<i>You're healthy and happy.</i>
<i>But l, believe me...</i>

1181
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:55,599
if a man doesn't know death,
he doesn't know life.

1182
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:59,958
PLAYER #5: It's a short life, but a gay one.
OTTO: Please, gentlemen, don't go.

1183
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,679
Come on. Drink to life...

1184
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,317
to the magnificent, dangerous...

1185
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,233
brief, wonderful life.

1186
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,959
BARON: Kringelein!
OTTO: And the courage to live it.

1187
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,952
You know, I’ve only lived since last night...

1188
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:20,070
but that little while seems longer
than all the time that's gone before.

1189
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:21,914
All of...

1190
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,151
Take him over to his bed.

1191
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,798
<i>Turn him around.</i>

1192
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,592
BARON: How is he, Doctor?

1193
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:35,110
DOCTOR: It will be over in a minute.
OTTO: Over?

1194
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:41,431
OTTO: It's only just begun.
DOCTOR: Quiet, Kringelein. Don't be afraid.

1195
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,715
I'm not afraid, Doc.

1196
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,833
- I'm not afraid to die.
- There, there.

1197
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:50,151
You'll be all right.
Too much iced champagne.

1198
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,157
- What?
- Hello, Baron.

1199
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,673
Hello, Kringelein.

1200
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,911
You old drunkard.

1201
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:07,918
It's late.

1202
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:27,757
DOCTOR: What is it?
OTTO: My pocketbook.

1203
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:33,191
I've lost my pocketbook.
14,000 marks in that pocketbook.

1204
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,839
OTTO: I've got to find it.
DOCTOR: No, stay where you are.

1205
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,512
OTTO: No, I’ve got to find that.

1206
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,955
DOCTOR: Kringelein!
OTTO: 14,000 marks.

1207
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:46,399
<i>14,000 marks were in that pocketbook.</i>

1208
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,915
<i>I can't see anything.</i>

1209
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,959
<i>You don't know what that money means</i>
<i>to a man like me.</i>

1210
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:57,635
You've never lived like a dog in a hole...

1211
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,752
and scrimped and saved.

1212
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,111
You did not see his pocketbook,
did you, Baron?

1213
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,349
No.

1214
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,073
My life hangs on that money, Baron.

1215
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,273
Nobody ever gives you anything
for nothing.

1216
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,750
You have to buy everything,
and pay cash for it.

1217
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:19,630
<i>I wanted to pay for my last days</i>
<i>with that money.</i>

1218
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,831
<i>I must find it!</i>

1219
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:28,230
I haven't anything in the world
but that pocketbook!

1220
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:33,030
