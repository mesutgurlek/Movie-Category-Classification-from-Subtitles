1
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:09,016
I used to think I was in
control of everything.

2
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:10,752
And now?

3
00:00:12,954 --> 00:00:20,060
now I think life happens, and it's our job to just...
To try to keep up,

4
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:23,329
to try to ride it out,
to try to survive.

5
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:25,465
You've had a lot
of disappointment lately.

6
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:28,433
(Laughing)

7
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:34,240
yeah.

8
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:37,743
(chuckles)

9
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:39,478
Yes, I have.

10
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:41,413
I think it's a bit excessive

11
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:43,382
for us to move all your stuff
back here just to prove

12
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:45,283
to some social worker
that I don't live with you.

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,985
Okay, fine.
Let's stay at your place.

14
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:48,787
I'm sure the social worker
would understand

15
00:00:48,854 --> 00:00:50,688
that we're in a committed,
loving relationship,

16
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:54,292
but that you refuse to acknowledge
the kid I'm trying to adopt.

17
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,963
I mean, I don't get it, but I'm
sure she's more evolved than I am.

18
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:01,131
I don't want
to fight anymore.

19
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,168
We're not fighting.
We're... disagreeing.

20
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:11,241
I'm gonna get
some more boxes.

21
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:16,612
(baby-talk voice) Hey.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,614
Hi, sweet boy. How are you?

23
00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:20,049
(Laughs)

24
00:01:20,117 --> 00:01:21,750
I thought, um...
Hi.

25
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:23,920
You weren't coming
till after work.

26
00:01:23,987 --> 00:01:26,322
(Normal voice) Uh, yeah,
but Lucas got invited

27
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:28,191
to this, um, puppy party
on Saturday,

28
00:01:28,258 --> 00:01:31,160
and I wanted to rsvp, and I
couldn't find the invitation.

29
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:33,195
You left it on the refrigerator.
I already rsvp'd.

30
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:35,063
Oh, thanks.

31
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:39,600
Hey, Violet, uh, I want to...
say something,

32
00:01:39,668 --> 00:01:42,704
and I-I need you to know that
I'm not trying to pick a fight.

33
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:44,706
(Lucas speaks indistinctly)

34
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:46,574
Okay.

35
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,111
We really need
to stick to our plan.

36
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:51,912
Which means?

37
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,547
That if you have a problem
with an invitation,

38
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:56,583
you call me up, and we deal with
it, but it's my time with Lucas,

39
00:01:56,652 --> 00:01:59,353
and you can't just,
you know, show up here.

40
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,656
To my own house?

41
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:04,191
To spend five minutes
with my son before work?

42
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,196
We made a deal and-- I know, I know, but...
Does it seem like it's working,

43
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:12,732
moving back and forth between
the house and the hotel?

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,135
I mean, don't--don't you feel
unsettled all the time?

45
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:17,070
(Lowered voice) I do, but we
agreed that we would try

46
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,173
to make this transition
as seamless as possible

47
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,873
for Lucas, so--
(Lowered voice)
I know, I know,

48
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,775
but if it's driving us crazy,
he's gonna sense it.

49
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,743
Okay,
what do you suggest?

50
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:29,048
Well, I think a better idea would be
for me to move back in here full-time

51
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,384
and for you to find
a place nearby.

52
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,055
Well, it's your house.

53
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,156
Well, just think about it.

54
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,257
Okay?

55
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,594
All right.

56
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,329
Mommy loves you.

57
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:45,697
(Kisses)

58
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:46,931
I'll see you tonight,
okay?

59
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:52,436
(Keys jangle)

60
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:54,438
(Door opens)
Okay, bud.

61
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:55,939
What's that?
That's coffee.

62
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:58,141
What's that?
Oh, that's a peach.

63
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,345
Kendra and I have been
together for six years.

64
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:04,948
We're ready, really ready,
to have children of our own.

65
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:07,951
And, Evan, I'm guessing
we'll be using your sperm?

66
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:10,052
It's the neighborly thing
to do.

67
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,689
So, uh, which one of you
is going to carry the baby?

68
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:14,056
I will.

69
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:15,425
And we'll use my egg.

70
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:17,893
That way we can both be
a part of the experience.

71
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:20,263
Okay. Well, I'll need
to examine you both.

72
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:22,198
And, uh, I also think
it's a good idea

73
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:25,400
if the three of you sit down
with one of our therapists.

74
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:26,901
Why?

75
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:29,338
Well, Evan isn't just
an anonymous sperm donor.

76
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:30,672
He's obviously a part
of your lives,

77
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,041
and presumably
will continue to be, right?

78
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:34,676
But isn't that better?

79
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:36,878
It's not about better
or worse.

80
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:39,381
It's about a situation that has
some potential complications.

81
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:41,982
The three of you are all going
to be involved in the pregnancy

82
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,184
and to some extent,
the child rearing.

83
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:46,454
I just want you to go into this
knowing what the stress points

84
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:49,223
are going to be
in an arrangement like this.

85
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,591
(Kendra) We appreciate that,
Dr. Reilly.

86
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,060
We do-- we can handle anything.

87
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:54,862
Whatever happens,
we'll work it out.

88
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:57,497
And a therapist will give you
a running start.

89
00:03:57,565 --> 00:04:01,100
Dr. Reilly-- guys, I'm not trying to
make you jump through hoops here.

90
00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:03,202
I really think this will
help you as parents.

91
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:05,372
I'm also not asking.

92
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:09,976
Cleaning supplies
secured under the sink?

93
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:12,811
Yes, all of the cabinets
in the house are secure.

94
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,780
You know where
the fire detector is?

95
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:16,315
Yep, right there
above the bed.

96
00:04:16,383 --> 00:04:18,317
Okay, you'll need
to test that monthly.

97
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:20,152
Change the batteries
once a year.

98
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,154
I have a reminder
set in my calendar.

99
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,690
Also,
I have made sure to, uh,

100
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:28,193
secure all of the balcony doors
with child-proof locks.

101
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:30,695
Good. Good.

102
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:35,466
How do you plan on dealing with the
drowning hazard the ocean presents?

103
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:41,472
Oh, uh... I can't imagine ever
letting that baby out of my arms,

104
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,610
but, uh, if I do, I will not
let her or him go outside.

105
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:48,612
I mean, the sun
is not our friend.

106
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,781
I don't know if you know
how many, uh,

107
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:53,717
cases of skin cancer are
reported each year, but...

108
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:57,854
Well, the sun is a bit
beyond my purview.

109
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,989
(Laughs)

110
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:04,694
That was a joke, right?

111
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:06,395
What?

112
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:14,870
Is there a man living here
you neglected to tell me about?

113
00:05:18,106 --> 00:05:19,474
(Chuckles)

114
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:22,310
Captioned by
closed captioning services, inc.

115
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:28,182
You sure you don't want me
to carry it?

116
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,451
I got it.

117
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:30,852
Okay.

118
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:32,153
Ooh!

119
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:33,420
What are these again?

120
00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:37,090
I seriously can't believe you've
never heard of tinkertoys.

121
00:05:37,158 --> 00:05:40,193
I spent, like, half my childhood
building forts and castles to play in.

122
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:42,028
You're gonna love it.

123
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:43,663
Oh, can we get these, too?

124
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:45,065
Why do you want to play
with cards?

125
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:46,199
We could build stuff.

126
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:48,434
Please, dad.

127
00:05:48,502 --> 00:05:50,803
Maybe next time, okay?

128
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:53,173
(Toy whirring)

129
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:57,077
(People speaking indistinctly)

130
00:05:57,144 --> 00:05:59,011
I'll meet you outside, dad.

131
00:06:01,414 --> 00:06:03,382
Can you add a pack of cards
to that, too, please?

132
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:04,616
(Cash register beeps)

133
00:06:04,684 --> 00:06:07,786
So, Evan, how do you see your
role in this baby's life?

134
00:06:07,854 --> 00:06:09,454
Donate the sperm,
build the crib,

135
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:12,091
and then I just kind of
want to be the fun uncle--

136
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:15,459
water fights and movie
nights, no diapers.

137
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:17,395
Which is great, because I'll
be home with the baby.

138
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:20,965
Rosie works, so...
And those roles are great for now,

139
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:23,301
but as a baby grows,
things do change.

140
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:26,170
Problems come up,
arguments happen,

141
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:29,007
and if Evan disagrees with
any of your parenting choices,

142
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:32,876
he would, as the biological
father, have legal standing

143
00:06:32,944 --> 00:06:34,244
unless you
specify otherwise now.

144
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:35,478
Like in a contract?

145
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:38,748
Yeah. Well, in most situations,
a contract is not a bad idea.

146
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,250
(Evan)
What would it say,

147
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:42,419
that I don't have any right
to be involved with the baby?

148
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:43,420
It can say
whatever you want.

149
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,488
It's just a formality.

150
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:50,492
But that feels so... Business-like
and this is not a business decision.

151
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,694
No, but if it's what
people normally do--

152
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:55,298
we're having a baby, rose,
not closing a deal.

153
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:56,933
Yeah, I agree
with kendra.

154
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,968
It feels impersonal.

155
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:02,304
R-rose, is there something you
would like to say to Evan?

156
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:03,838
No, not right now.

157
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:05,073
Come on, rose.

158
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:06,141
(Rose)
We'll talk about it later.

159
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,776
(Kendra) Rosie...
Guys, I'm a therapist.

160
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:11,712
There's very little that I
haven't seen or heard.

161
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,349
And this is not a place
of judgment.

162
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:18,753
But getting what you want has
to start with the truth.

163
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:20,220
So...

164
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,761
We're in love.

165
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:28,663
Okay.

166
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:33,200
We're... All in love.

167
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:39,706
(People speaking indistinctly)

168
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:41,140
Whatcha doin'?

169
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,410
Oh, I'm just trying to maximize
my ten minutes between patients.

170
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,280
I got kinda
jammed up today.

171
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:50,383
Feel like taking a break at
lunch for pizza and pins?

172
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:53,719
Greasy slices, slippery
bowling balls, my treat.

173
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:55,855
Well, that sounds like fun,
but I don't know

174
00:07:55,922 --> 00:08:00,325
if my digestive track could handle it, plus, uh...
I hate putting on shoes

175
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:03,095
that a hundred other people
have worn before me, you know--

176
00:08:03,162 --> 00:08:04,597
oh, come on.
It'll be fun.

177
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:07,299
I'll even buy
the pepto and purell.

178
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:10,035
Thanks, but, uh...
Maybe some other time.

179
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:14,572
(People speaking indistinctly)

180
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,608
Hey. I was
just looking for you.

181
00:08:16,675 --> 00:08:18,377
And now you found me.

182
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:19,611
You busy today?

183
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:21,146
I'm pretty much
caught up on my charts.

184
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:24,948
A couple of patients are coming
in-- are you ready to cut again?

185
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:28,352
A patient with an obstructive neurosarcoid
was scheduled for this afternoon,

186
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,056
but buddle's coming off an
all-nighter, and I need someone.

187
00:08:32,124 --> 00:08:33,757
Well, I thought I might
assist a few before I--

188
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:36,593
either you're ready to come back to
the hospital and work or you're not.

189
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:40,930
I'm ready.

190
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:42,732
I'm definitely ready.

191
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,966
Good.

192
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,107
We know it sounds crazy.

193
00:08:51,175 --> 00:08:53,076
I understand being in love.
I'm not judging.

194
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:54,844
You are.
Everyone judges us.

195
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:57,746
But we appreciate how hard
you're trying not to.

196
00:08:57,813 --> 00:08:59,381
(Laughs) Okay.

197
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:01,616
Well, tell me
about yourselves.

198
00:09:01,684 --> 00:09:04,553
The first night was... It was amazing.

199
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,887
The first night
usually is.

200
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:07,189
But so was the next morning.

201
00:09:07,257 --> 00:09:08,723
And every morning
after that.

202
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,824
Most mornings.

203
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:11,492
It--it sounds very easy.

204
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,494
It's not.
We have rules.

205
00:09:13,562 --> 00:09:15,696
Every decision
has to be unanimous.

206
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:19,233
We have to avoid the two against one
so no one feels ganged up on. Okay.

207
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:24,004
Y-you are talking about things that are
in the context of the relationship.

208
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:26,374
But there is a world
out there,

209
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:29,242
the world that you would be
raising your child in.

210
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,479
And that world is not quite as accepting
about things that don't appear--

211
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:34,581
normal?

212
00:09:34,648 --> 00:09:37,250
I come from a home where there
wasn't a lot of love.

213
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:42,456
There was a lot of...
Commitment-- 35 years of marriage--

214
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:46,425
and a lot of what people call
normal, but not much love.

215
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:48,794
Kendra and rose and me...

216
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:54,766
There's a lot of love here.

217
00:09:57,003 --> 00:09:58,070
A-a what?

218
00:09:58,138 --> 00:09:59,537
A polyamorous triad.

219
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:01,573
Three people in a committed,
monogamous relationship.

220
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,974
I can barely keep up
with one partner.

221
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,576
I can't imagine
trying to satisfy two.

222
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:06,844
There's no way that works.

223
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:08,279
Every couple, or triad,
is different.

224
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:09,714
You know,
you can't generalize.

225
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:11,316
It doesn't matter what they are.
They lied to me.

226
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:12,850
(Violet) Well, because their
lifestyle's unconventional,

227
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:14,952
they're probably used to
being criticized and mocked--

228
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,386
(Addison)
For good reason.

229
00:10:16,454 --> 00:10:18,489
I mean, hey, can we just pause
the moral and ethical debate

230
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:20,857
and criticize and mock them
for a minute?
(Laughs)

231
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:22,192
(Sam) It's just weird.

232
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,594
It's weird.

233
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:24,894
Four boobs, two geegers...
(Violet and Addison laugh)

234
00:10:24,962 --> 00:10:26,796
It's not weird.
It's fantastic.

235
00:10:26,864 --> 00:10:28,064
Wow.
Yeah, you know what?

236
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:29,699
You just brought it
to a whole other level.

237
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:31,101
Yep.
Life is already so difficult.
Why make it harder?

238
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:33,802
Yeah, but that's the same argument
that said that interracial

239
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,638
and same-sex couples
shouldn't have children.

240
00:10:35,705 --> 00:10:37,940
Hey, I was ready to help out
an honest lesbian couple.

241
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:41,377
So wait. Is it the dishonesty or the
polyamory that you take issue with?

242
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:42,612
The lying.

243
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,779
Okay, well,
separate that out.

244
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,080
These people
are in a tough spot.

245
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,915
Society is not ready
for them.

246
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:48,550
Oh, are we still talking about
this? Sam is right.

247
00:10:48,618 --> 00:10:49,684
(Cell phone rings)
It is just plain weird.

248
00:10:49,752 --> 00:10:50,818
Thank you, baby.

249
00:10:50,886 --> 00:10:53,121
Addison Montgomery.

250
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:54,389
Really?

251
00:10:54,457 --> 00:10:58,993
Is she... Uh, yes, yes, I do.
A-absolutely, I do.

252
00:10:59,061 --> 00:11:00,862
Thank you very much.
Good-bye.

253
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:01,963
Uh...
(Beeps)

254
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:05,932
That was my lawyer, and despite the fact
that I misled and slightly fibbed to

255
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,403
the social worker, she signed off,
and a birth mother wants to meet me.

256
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:10,771
(Violet) Wow.
You know what?

257
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,173
In a lot of places,
a single white woman

258
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,175
living with a single black man
who also happens to be

259
00:11:14,242 --> 00:11:16,943
the ex-husband of her best friend...
Oh, my... (Sam) Oh, wow.

260
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,479
(Sheldon) Trying to adopt
a child out of wedlock

261
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:19,646
without the interest
of her boyfriend...
Come on.

262
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,247
Would seem
just plain weird.

263
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:22,582
Okay, fine.
I take back the weird.

264
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,184
The triad has all my support.

265
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:27,086
In less than a month,
I could be a mother.

266
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,423
(Laughs)

267
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:38,278
Hey, you feelin' okay?

268
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:40,848
Yes.

269
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,815
You sure?
You want to talk?

270
00:11:42,883 --> 00:11:46,586
I'm a little nervous about meeting
the birth mother, you know?

271
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:50,289
So, yes, I would like to talk about it, but I'm...
Pretty sure you don't.

272
00:11:50,357 --> 00:11:51,724
Not about that.

273
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:56,696
Well... Good luck.

274
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:00,132
You're great.

275
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,435
And you're gonna do great.

276
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:09,775
(Exhales)

277
00:12:09,842 --> 00:12:12,445
How are you at... Forgiving?

278
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:13,912
I mean,
in your personal life.

279
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,115
I know we preach it, but...
can you do it?

280
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:18,683
Sometimes.

281
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,984
When?

282
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:22,720
Wh-when the relationship
is worth saving.

283
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:23,888
We talking about Amelia?

284
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:25,390
(Inhales deeply)

285
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,025
No. We're--we're just
talking about forgiveness.

286
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:29,494
Oh. (Chuckles)

287
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:30,727
Okay.

288
00:12:30,795 --> 00:12:33,763
Well, uh, I guess it would
depend on what the offense is.

289
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:38,068
She crushed me.

290
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:39,736
Yeah.

291
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:41,304
And when she was in crisis,
when she was in rehab,

292
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:44,507
it was easy for me to
put aside my own hurt feelings

293
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:46,308
and my own reactions,
you know?

294
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:49,478
It was easy
just to want to save her.

295
00:12:49,545 --> 00:12:51,680
But now, I, uh...

296
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:55,350
I don't want
to make it harder for her.

297
00:12:58,755 --> 00:13:00,756
Well, just give her time.

298
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:02,924
Is that what you're doing
with Pete?

299
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:05,260
(Exhales)

300
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,427
Yes.

301
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,329
Is it working?

302
00:13:08,397 --> 00:13:11,032
No.

303
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,005
(Water running without sound)

304
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:32,385
(Surgical team
speaking indistinctly)

305
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:33,620
(Door closes)

306
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,554
Dr. Shepherd,
it's good to see you.

307
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:36,823
We heard
you were on vacation.

308
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,124
Did you go somewhere amazing?

309
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,958
This isn't a tea party.

310
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:41,759
You all have a surgery
to do.

311
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:43,328
Dr. Shepherd
needs to concentrate.

312
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:44,629
You all do.

313
00:13:44,697 --> 00:13:46,298
Less talk. More focus.

314
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:50,302
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

315
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:01,545
Scalpel.

316
00:14:04,115 --> 00:14:09,920
I have one more semester,
then law school.

317
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:12,155
Yes, please.

318
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,390
(Exhales)

319
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,692
Ooh.

320
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:24,033
Do you think I'm an awful
person for giving my baby up?

321
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:28,503
Of course not.
I-- oh, please don't humor me.

322
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:31,240
Please just think about
the question.

323
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:33,041
Because I'm 20.

324
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:37,679
I'm not a teenager, and I
have the resources, you know?

325
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:39,481
You know,
this isn't necessity.

326
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:43,352
I'm not giving her up
out of necessity.

327
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:48,756
I'm giving her up because...
I don't want to be a mom at 20.

328
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:59,500
And I don't want to give her to anyone
who thinks I'm an awful person.

329
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:02,102
I had an abortion
when I was in my 30s.

330
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:05,705
I was already a surgeon.
My career was in place.

331
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:10,576
And, uh... I certainly had the resources, but...
I wasn't ready.

332
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:14,381
So... I'm not judging you.

333
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,317
Oh, God.

334
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,752
And now I really hope
that you're not judging me.

335
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,554
(Laughs)
I'm sorry. I probably
shouldn't have told you that.

336
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:25,457
Oh, no, no, no. It's not--I mean, I-I
don't want you to think that I-I--

337
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,992
I'm not judging you,
Dr. Montgomery.

338
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,961
(Exhales)

339
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,931
Wow. That's just... I've...
never met anyone

340
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,466
who just admitted
to an abortion like that.

341
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,002
It's just that no one
ever talks about that stuff.

342
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,104
Certainly not when they're
trying to impress someone.

343
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,772
Oh, not ever.

344
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:48,079
I mean... We all just pretend
like that stuff doesn't exist.

345
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,414
You're sort of amazing.

346
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,316
(Chuckles)

347
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:56,587
So... Have you met with any
other potential parents?

348
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:01,459
Well, there's this family at my
church that my mom had me meet.

349
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:06,228
And they were nice...
But kind of boring.

350
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:09,265
You know, the dad works,
the mom stays home.

351
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,534
They already have
a little boy.

352
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:13,002
Mm.

353
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,337
You're a fetal surgeon?

354
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:15,505
Yes, that's right.

355
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:17,106
That's pretty awesome.

356
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:18,407
Thank you.

357
00:16:18,476 --> 00:16:19,709
(Laughs)

358
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:25,747
Real estate listings?

359
00:16:25,815 --> 00:16:28,550
Yeah. Violet thinks
I should find my own place.

360
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:30,118
(Clicking keyboard keys)

361
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:32,387
Wow.

362
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:33,689
I'm sorry.

363
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:35,357
How do you feel about that?

364
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:36,757
I don't know.

365
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:39,594
I don't want to be
a part-time parent to Lucas--

366
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:44,231
not being with him every day, missing...
Wake up, bedtime, bath time, I...

367
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:46,200
And even if I do get
a place that's close by,

368
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:48,068
it still won't be
his house, you know?

369
00:16:48,136 --> 00:16:52,106
Mm-hmm. Maya used to call my place...
"Her weekend getaway."

370
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:54,307
Ugh.
(Pours liquid)

371
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,175
It's tough.
You miss a lot.

372
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:57,511
Kids kill you.

373
00:16:57,578 --> 00:16:59,012
One way or another.

374
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:01,080
You and Addison?

375
00:17:01,148 --> 00:17:03,416
Ugh. We're not even
pretending anymore.

376
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:07,888
It's like, uh, I don't know, one
of us just has to say the words,

377
00:17:07,955 --> 00:17:11,356
make official what we...
Both already know.

378
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:16,395
Yeah, well, before you say
the words, just... Be sure.

379
00:17:19,098 --> 00:17:22,034
In a few months, I could have
a son on that screen.

380
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:23,602
Or a daughter.
(Rose) Healthy baby.

381
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,837
Gender irrelevant.
Come on, guys.

382
00:17:25,905 --> 00:17:26,971
Rose is right.

383
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,239
Okay, kendra, I'm all done.

384
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:31,576
Rose,
you want to hop up here?

385
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:36,948
What?

386
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:41,018
No, nothing. It--it's sweet, the
way you all get along so well.

387
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:42,252
Seems like
it would be tricky.

388
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,587
He wants to know
about the sex.

389
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:45,155
No.

390
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:46,456
(Rose) It's okay.
Everyone does.
(Evan laughs)

391
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,425
(Kendra) We have one bed--
California king.

392
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:49,726
That's enough, kendra.

393
00:17:49,794 --> 00:17:52,095
Dr. Montgomery,
what is it?

394
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:58,768
I just don't understand
why he would do this?

395
00:17:58,835 --> 00:18:01,270
Because he's 8.
Because he wanted the cards.

396
00:18:01,337 --> 00:18:02,672
Because he's testing you.

397
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:03,940
I don't know.

398
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:07,977
Cooper, if a parent comes in and tells
you that their kid stole something,

399
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,478
what do you say?

400
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,248
I would ask if there had been any
other troubling behavior recently.

401
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:15,784
Has there been with Mason?

402
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:17,786
No, but--
then what else
do you ask 'em?

403
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:21,656
If there had been any problems at home
that the kid could be reacting to.

404
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:22,958
That the case with Mason?

405
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:24,525
I don't think so, no.

406
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:25,760
So then what?

407
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:29,930
A kid with no big problems swipes something
from a toy store, out of the blue.

408
00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:31,331
What do you tell
the parents to do?

409
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:35,936
It's just... I've never done this before...
(Chuckles)

410
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:37,605
Not with my own kid.

411
00:18:37,672 --> 00:18:39,807
It's different.

412
00:18:39,874 --> 00:18:41,809
(Sighs)

413
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:46,378
(Jake) So, rose, I'm afraid that, uh...
(Clears throat)

414
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:52,018
You have a scarred uterus and ovarian
failure secondary to pelvic t.B.

415
00:18:52,086 --> 00:18:54,621
Tuberculosis?

416
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:56,222
I'm not sick.

417
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:58,858
No, you're not. It's,
uh... it's not active.

418
00:18:58,926 --> 00:19:01,727
But if you've spent any time at all in
South America in the last ten years--

419
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:03,562
(kendra) She taught e.S.L.
In Chile after college.

420
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,564
(Evan)
What are you saying?

421
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:08,967
Unfortunately, rose's body is
incapable of producing viable eggs

422
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:11,504
or carrying a fetus.

423
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:18,543
I am so sorry, Rosie.

424
00:19:18,611 --> 00:19:21,346
But, um, we can still
have a family, right?

425
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:25,450
(Jake) Yes, in fact, kendra's tests
all came back perfectly normal.

426
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:27,885
So if Evan and--and kendra
were to try to conceive,

427
00:19:27,953 --> 00:19:29,487
they might not
even need I.V.F.

428
00:19:29,555 --> 00:19:30,821
What?

429
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,823
What about me?

430
00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:34,057
Rosie,
you'd be the mom, too.

431
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,160
This would be our child.

432
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:37,761
No, this would be
your child with Evan.

433
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,229
It's not the same.

434
00:19:39,297 --> 00:19:41,831
Well, I-in my experience,
once the baby shows up--

435
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:44,301
no, the whole point of this
was to have a baby together

436
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:46,102
so that we could all be
a part of the experience.

437
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:47,337
Dr. Reilly is right.

438
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:50,506
If the three of you really want a
baby, no matter where it comes from--

439
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:54,810
if I can't be a part of
this, we're not doing it.

440
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:58,181
Rose, you yourself said, the three
of you could handle anything.

441
00:19:58,248 --> 00:20:00,583
We are handling it.

442
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:05,353
We're just...
We're just not having a baby.

443
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:17,696
I'm saying that,
in a two-party relationship,

444
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:20,212
both parties have to agree
in order to have the baby.

445
00:20:20,482 --> 00:20:22,231
Well, the same rules apply
in the triad.

446
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:24,032
All decisions are
supposed to be unanimous.

447
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,201
Well, this one
clearly isn't.

448
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:27,603
And it's not like
one of them can leave.

449
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,902
I mean, they say
they're a family, right?

450
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,938
Well, families don't always
stay together.

451
00:20:31,006 --> 00:20:32,607
Look, the--the truth is

452
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:35,075
that kendra and rose and Evan
are not that different from us.

453
00:20:35,144 --> 00:20:36,477
They want to stay together,
they want to work it out,

454
00:20:36,545 --> 00:20:38,045
and this is just an obstacle.

455
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,548
Well, for most couples,
having or not having a baby,

456
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:42,183
it's not an obstacle,
it's a deal breaker.

457
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:43,717
That's because having a baby
is not rational.

458
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,018
Sam.

459
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:46,719
What? I'm not saying
it's irrational.

460
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,987
I'm just saying,
it's instinctive.

461
00:20:48,055 --> 00:20:50,590
You know, it's hormonal.
It's biological.

462
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:53,092
But wanting one--you either
do or you don't.

463
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:55,662
Look, you gave them a piece
of devastating news.

464
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:58,532
They need time
to process it.

465
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:02,234
Hopefully, their relationship
is strong enough to overcome it.

466
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:06,104
(Release the sunbird's
"we'll begin tomorrow" playing)

467
00:21:06,173 --> 00:21:08,340
(Knock on door)

468
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:10,108
I heard your surgery
yesterday went well.

469
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:12,311

okay with it, actually.

I mean, she's really lovely,

Did she choose you?
I don't know.

502

I mean, but she had
somebody page me.

That's a good sign, right?

504

Yeah, I should probably
just bite the bullet

507
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:29,415
and buy something instead of getting
some dinky apartment that Lucas hates.

508
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:32,485
I should get something with a
yard, room for all his stuff.

Yeah, probably better

630
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:12,205
Amazing.
Right?

631
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:14,540
Yeah. You c--you could totally
be that guy, Coop.

632
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,809
Or, uh, you could be
Mason's dad.

633
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:20,479
I mean, being a parent, like, a
real parent, day in, day out,

634
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:23,515
trying to make sure your kid
turns out okay, it's hard, man.

635
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,851
You gotta say "no" a lot.
You gotta hear "I hate you."

636
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:29,521
You gotta give up fun times
to--to reinforce values

637
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,021
that you think are important.

638
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,559
It's... It is the hardest
thing in the world.

639
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:38,429
So... I don't know, man.
It's up to you.

640
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:47,203
(Evan) I get that she's upset, but this is...
(Inhales deeply) It's wrong.

641
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:50,374
She just found out that she
can't be a mom biologically.

642
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:52,208
I mean, that's gonna take
some time.

643
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:54,978
I'm sure part of it is
rose's concern about the baby.

644
00:26:55,045 --> 00:26:57,514
But don't you think
she's also concerned

645
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,750
about what this might do
to the three of you?

646
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:01,117
In what sense?

647
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:02,685
Well, that the two of you
might share a bond

648
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:05,654
that she's not,
that she can't be, a part of.

649
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:07,623
No, that would never happen.

650
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:08,624
Ever.

651
00:27:08,692 --> 00:27:10,058
It's happening right now.

652
00:27:10,126 --> 00:27:11,394
You two are here
without her.

653
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:12,862
But we're trying
to fix it.

654
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:15,197
I mean, we want...
To fix it.

655
00:27:15,265 --> 00:27:16,799
Okay.

656
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:18,433
Are you willing
to compromise?

657
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:19,734
(Sighs)

658
00:27:19,802 --> 00:27:21,870
If there was some way
we could reassure rose,

659
00:27:21,937 --> 00:27:26,641
make her understand that we're
doing this for the three of us.

660
00:27:26,709 --> 00:27:31,679
You're the one who told me, this
relationship works because of the rules.

661
00:27:31,747 --> 00:27:34,548
All decisions
have to be unanimous.

662
00:27:37,084 --> 00:27:38,351
(Jenny o's "I'm gonna
love you too" playing)

663
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,220
No, Amelia started it.
She came on to me.

664
00:27:40,288 --> 00:27:42,055
Aim for the target,
Sheldon.

665
00:27:42,123 --> 00:27:46,026
And then just when I started
feeling something... Enter Ryan.

666
00:27:46,093 --> 00:27:49,830
(Sighs) Remember to use your
left hand to steady your right.

667
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:51,063
And I feel sorry for her.

668
00:27:51,131 --> 00:27:52,932
I mean, she loved him,
and he died.

669
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:55,668
And I know she feels bad
about humiliating me.

670
00:27:55,736 --> 00:27:57,870
I-I... I don't know. I...
Why can't I forgive her?

671
00:27:57,938 --> 00:28:00,205
Pull the trigger, Sheldon.

672
00:28:00,273 --> 00:28:01,541

673
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:03,075

00:28:03,143 --> 00:28:04,744

675
00:28:04,812 --> 00:28:06,378
I haven't shot a gun
in years.

676
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:08,713
Holy hell, that felt good.

677
00:28:08,781 --> 00:28:10,114
Yep.

678
00:28:10,182 --> 00:28:13,585
Shoot the target, let it all out there,
'cause I can pretty well promise you,

679
00:28:13,653 --> 00:28:18,457
Amelia's in no shape to take care of a
single one of your feelings right now.

680
00:28:18,524 --> 00:28:20,492
I know you love her,
Sheldon.

681
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,127
Love her enough
to leave her alone.

682
00:28:24,195 --> 00:28:25,663
Take aim.

683

00:28:54,161 --> 00:28:55,227
Hey.

692
00:28:55,295 --> 00:28:57,362
Morning.

693
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,965
What happened
to your hand?

694
00:28:59,032 --> 00:29:01,834
Ah, I strained it
at the shooting range.

695
00:29:01,902 --> 00:29:03,603
The shooting range,
really?

696
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,037
It might be
my new hobby.

697
00:29:05,105 --> 00:29:06,305
(Liquid pours)

698
00:29:06,372 --> 00:29:08,340
That...
Sounds kind of fun.

699
00:29:08,408 --> 00:29:10,976
Could I...
Could I go sometime?

700
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:12,110
(Inhales deeply)

701
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:13,377
Uh, no.

702
00:29:13,445 --> 00:29:18,083
I mean, just, uh...
Not any time really soon.

703
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,517
You understand?

704
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,087
I understand.

705
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:32,763
There's nothing that can be done to...
(Inhales deeply) Fix me?

706
00:29:32,831 --> 00:29:34,665
Rose, you--
you aren't broken.

707
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:38,702
I know it feels that way, but...
there are so many women

708
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,071
who have come to me,
unable to conceive,

709
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:45,808
and... yet we still find
a way to make them mothers.

710
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:47,409
Are you a father?

711
00:29:47,477 --> 00:29:51,514
Yes, I am, not biologically, but
regardless, the love I feel--

712
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,117
I don't want to lose them.

713
00:29:55,953 --> 00:29:57,987
What if a baby
changes everything?

714
00:29:58,055 --> 00:30:02,057
If the love is real, it
can withstand anything.

715
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,126
Do you really believe that?

716
00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:07,729
No.

717
00:30:09,932 --> 00:30:13,001
No, I... (Sighs)

718
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:16,303
I think love
is a powerful force.

719
00:30:16,371 --> 00:30:23,544
It puts up a hell of a fight, but, uh...
Sometimes life rises up and wins.

720
00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:29,083
That's what I'm afraid of...
That me being infertile...

721
00:30:29,151 --> 00:30:32,385
That's gonna be
life winning.

722
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:37,991
(Mason) So do you think you can finish
early so we can go to the pier?

723
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:40,226
Uh, we're not going
to the pier today.

724
00:30:40,294 --> 00:30:41,460
Really?

725
00:30:41,528 --> 00:30:43,029
Really.

726
00:30:43,097 --> 00:30:45,799
I need to talk to you,
so...

727
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:50,468
(Sighs)

728
00:30:50,536 --> 00:30:54,573
I saw you steal that pack of cards
from the toy store. But I d--

729
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,244
don't even start to tell me that
you didn't, because... I saw you.

730
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,980
I want to call my mom.

731
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:04,816
Just sit down and you're
gonna listen to me, okay?

732
00:31:04,883 --> 00:31:06,117
Says who?

733
00:31:06,185 --> 00:31:07,484
Says me.
I'm your father.

734
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:09,153
No.

735
00:31:09,221 --> 00:31:12,223
You're just the guy
who got my mom pregnant.

736
00:31:13,892 --> 00:31:17,729
Okay, here's what happens next-- tomorrow
after school, I'm gonna pick you up,

737
00:31:17,796 --> 00:31:20,598
I'm gonna take you to the toy store, and
you're gonna apologize to the owner.

738
00:31:20,665 --> 00:31:23,166
I am not gonna-- you're gonna
apologize to the owner.

739
00:31:23,235 --> 00:31:24,868
Then I'm gonna take you home.

740
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:26,970
You're gonna go to your room
and do your homework.

741
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:30,574
And you're gonna stay in there
till it's time to go to bed,

742
00:31:30,642 --> 00:31:33,744
and it's gonna be like that
for a week.

743
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:36,346
You think my mom's
gonna go along with this?

744
00:31:36,413 --> 00:31:38,715
I know she will.

745
00:31:38,782 --> 00:31:41,217
But... what about
the weekend?

746
00:31:41,285 --> 00:31:42,852
Are we still gonna go
to the movies?

747
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:44,787
No, the movies are out.

748
00:31:46,624 --> 00:31:49,559
But... am I even
gonna see you?

749
00:31:51,428 --> 00:31:52,928
Of course.

750
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:56,065
I am <i>never</i> going away.

751
00:31:58,034 --> 00:31:59,534
Okay?

752
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:05,040
(Indistinct conversations)

753
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,112
I want a baby.

754
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,983
Just... not this way.

755
00:32:16,418 --> 00:32:19,654
But I love you guys so
I guess I'll do it.

756
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:24,357
You two can make our baby, and
I will just have to trust us.

757
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:25,692
(Evan) Thank you, rose.

758
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,195
Thank you.

759
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:30,730
No.

760
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,366
I can't do that.

761
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:36,603
I really want a baby, too, but
the reason we work is the rules.

762
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:38,038
We need rules.

763
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:42,108
We need unanimous or someone's gonna get
hurt, and we can't have that happen.

764
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:46,779
So we can use a surrogate or
adopt or not have a baby at all,

765
00:32:46,847 --> 00:32:49,148
but... given the choice,
I choose you.

766
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:50,516
I choose the three of us.

767
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,885
This is crazy.
This isn't some little thing.

768
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:56,054
This is... not trivial.

769
00:32:56,122 --> 00:32:59,490
I want a child... My child.

770
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:04,595
Evan... I love you, both of you, but...

771
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:08,934
I'm not sure
I can choose you.

772
00:33:19,478 --> 00:33:21,412
<i>(Woman speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>over p.A.)</i>

773
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,913
(Knocks on door)

774
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:25,115
Hi.

775
00:33:25,183 --> 00:33:26,384
Hey.

776
00:33:28,253 --> 00:33:29,853
How are you?

777
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,088
Okay.

778
00:33:32,156 --> 00:33:40,230
I didn't want to hold her, but
then I did, and... (Sighs)

779
00:33:40,297 --> 00:33:43,099
Do you want to hold her?

780
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,800
(Exhales deeply)

781
00:33:46,202 --> 00:33:47,403
Yes.

782
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,073
(Snorts)

783
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,508
Oh.

784
00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:53,642
Ahh.

785
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,478

you get no baby.

952
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:08,591
How am I supposed
to believe that?

953
00:42:08,658 --> 00:42:12,695
How am I supposed to believe
in anything, ever again?

954
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:18,734
I mean, how... Is love not enough?

955
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,335
You have to face the loss.

956
00:42:20,403 --> 00:42:22,737
You have to deal
with the disappointment.

957
00:42:22,805 --> 00:42:24,639
Don't want to.
