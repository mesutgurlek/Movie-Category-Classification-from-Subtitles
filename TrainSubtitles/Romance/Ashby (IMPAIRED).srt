You know, I can't work you out.

it's envy maybe or something.

No. You get a name, an address or two,

493
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,566
No, it's not weird.

494
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,778
You realize I need to see your brain now.

495
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:23,988
Really? I'd be honored.

496
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,406
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

497
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:28,951
Music?

498
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:30,536
You got any Pilgrim?

499
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,288
Of course.

500
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,376
- (MUSIC PLAYING)
- (BUZZING)

501
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,764
My mom is dead, if you were wondering.

502
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:55,436
She had a cerebral hemorrhage
which is a bit like an IED in your brain.

503
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,773
She was standing in line at
The Cheesecake Factory one day

504
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,733
and boom.

505
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,115
Where were you?

506
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,619
Standing in line
at The Cheesecake Factory.

507
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,749
My dad really took it hard.

508
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,001
They were really in love.

509
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,836
Not like most people
who say they're in love

510
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:23,756
but then really never see each other.

511
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,051
They were loyal and tight and...

512
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,177
Like they saw each other brighter

513
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:30,054
than anything else in the whole world.

514
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,142
He mostly works now.

515
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,692
My neighbor killed people for the CIA.

516
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:43,818
Wow. Really?

517
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,529
I would love to see his brain.

518
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,448
What's he like?

519
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:50,908
He's strange.

520
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,910
He wears, like, really funny clothes

521
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:57,999
and he has all these tattoos
but not, like, hipster tattoos.

522
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:02,169
He has tattoos that I'm pretty sure
he got in a Russian prison.

523
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,338
- (CHUCKLES)
- I actually really like him.

524
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:08,759
But I found out that he killed 93 people.

525
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,555
Lot of blood on two little hands.

526
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:14,557
Who said that?

527
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,309
Me.

528
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,353
Really? Sounded like you were quoting.

529
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,773
Yeah, well, I do that sometimes.

530
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,109
So people will put my sayings
out into the lexicon,

531
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,028
- thereby rendering me...
- Immortal?

532
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,487
Exactly.

533
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,536
You're pretty strange.

534
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,289
How so?

535
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,667
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

536
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,974
All right, well.

537
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,936
Guess... Guess that's it.

538
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:03,189
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

539
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,734
Sign here. Just kidding.

540
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,571
All right.

541
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,698
Bye.

542
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,830
(GROANS)

543
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,416
Ow!

544
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,920
You're not coming to practice tomorrow.

545
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,255
You get that?

546
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,842
- Huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

547
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,525
Hey.

548
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:49,819
Howdy?

549
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,570
(KEYS JANGLING)

550
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:52,697
Let's go.

551
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,700
Where are we going?

552
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,869
ASHBY: He died for this.

553
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:02,623
You okay? What are you...

554
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,709
You gonna buy something?

555
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,544
Let's just get out of here.

556
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,549
Wow.
Somebody's really chatty today, isn't he?

557
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,679
Would you like
an ice cream or something?

558
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:18,806
What? No.

559
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,478
Let's go.

560
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:31,652
Is this a cassette?

561
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,237
I've literally
never seen a cassette before.

562
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,363
I've only heard about it.

563
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:36,657
Does it work?

564
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,618
Left here.

565
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,245
Who's Peter Frampton?

566
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,038
Slow down. Right here.

567
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:44,623
ED: Can I know where we're going?

568
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:45,708
ASHBY: To visit a friend.

569
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,493
ED: What're you doing, really?

570
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,170
You're gonna see a girl?

571
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,727
- No.
- Did you get all dressed up for her?

572
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,468
- I won't be long.
- It's a nice vest. You look nice.

573
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,954
Look.

574
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,664
Like a ghost.

575
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,417
- Ashby.
- Pete.

576
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,794
I didn't hear the bell.

577
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,379
- No. I didn't ring it.
- Oh. (CHUCKLES)

578
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,839
Of course.

579
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,008
You want some lemonade?

580
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,552
Or a whiskey?

581
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,056
It's early in the day,
but late in the life, right?

582
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,058
(SIGHS)

583
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,145
Garret Hughes.

584
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:53,901
What about him?

585
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,613
He wasn't an enemy
of the state, was he?

586
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:02,827
He was an enemy
of the state of my bank balance.

587
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,537
Jesus Christ, Peter.

588
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,330
Look. Come on, Ashby.

589
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,083
Are you getting squeamish now
after all you did?

590
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:10,668
We did?

591
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,421
I was meant to do it,
but I got stuck on that Honduras thing.

592
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:15,965
You used me.

593
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:19,385
In our world, it's an office prank, Ash.

594
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,762
Are you mad about the money?

595
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,597
You want a piece? I'll cut you in.

596
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,850
I'll cut you a check
and we'll have a whiskey.

597
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,143
I'd love to reminisce.
We'll have some dinner.

598
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,771
Marjorie's in Florida.
So, you don't get to see her pretty...

599
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,442
You're going to kill me, Ash?

600
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,404
I am.

601
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,114
Over some guy you didn't even know?

602
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,783
You'll forgive me if I don't believe...
(GASPS)

603
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:44,535
(THUDDING)

604
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,973
I don't think I can fix this.

605
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,812
How's your friend?

606
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,859
Sort of grown apart.

607
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:18,986
That's too bad.

608
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,990
Hey, I made the football team.

609
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,910
- (LAUGHS) Congratulations.
- Thanks.

610
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,578
- That's great.
- Thanks.

611
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,248
What happened?
They forgot to give you a helmet?

612
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,458
Uh...

613
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,877
This kid took umbrage at my presence.

614
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,670
'Cause he thinks I'm gonna take his spot.

615
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,174
Well, I hope you got a few punches in.

616
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,843
No, I kind of have
a pacifist view of these things.

617
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,346
I just think, violence begets violence.

618
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:47,711
Well, let me tell you something.

619
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:50,184
Beatings begets bruises.

620
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,270
Trust me. More beatings.

621
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,690
Hey, you wouldn't kill him for me,
would you?

622
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,028
Would you just kill him for me?

623
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,489
I'm retired.

624
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,199
That's a shame.

625
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,870
But, the thing is
I proved to myself that I can do it,

626
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,080
which is all I really wanted to do.

627
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,414
And I'm just happy
that I made the football team.

628
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:15,709
I don't even need to, actually, be on it.

629
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:19,463
I really do have a big workload
and SAT's to think about.

630
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,966
I'm really focusing on trying
to get into Northwestern.

631
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:23,504
Where did you go to college?

632
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,046
So you're going to just quit?

633
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,264
I dunno. I mean,
I have to balance up my pros and cons

634
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,516
and look at my goals.

635
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,642
Let me ask you something.

636
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,726
Yeah.

637
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:38,649
Is one of your goals
to bullshit yourself into submission?

638
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,444
You know, I don't have to drive you.

639
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:47,741
Oh, I know. Hey, I'm grateful. Okay?

640
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,076
Okay.

641
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:52,037
And I'm gonna repay you right now.

642
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,594
Wait, you're going to
teach me how to fight?

643
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,044
I ain't got that much time left.

644
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,588
What then?

645
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:05,300
If you're going to be a pacifist

646
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,928
and an irritating personality type,

647
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,431
then you can at least learn
how to take a punch,

648
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,976
as you'll, no doubt,
have to be taking many.

649
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,713
- Put 'em up.
- That's lovely, but...

650
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,650
Ow! Jesus!

651
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:22,901
- Stings a little.
- Why did...

652
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,820
I didn't think you were
actually gonna do it.

653
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,947
Slip to the right.
All right. Don't be a bitch.

654
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,032
Slip to the right. Come on.

655
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,200

But you don't want it to be.

dive underneath it and everything,

that your old man is just a piece of shit.

00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:15,074
Buh-bye.

983
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,578
Wow. One door closes, huh?

984
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,413
I think he's nice.

985
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:23,666
You okay?

986
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,251
How's Ashby?

987
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:31,299
Ed?

988
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:37,638
You're not like an
asshole who's touching

989
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,390
my son's privates, are you?

990
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,684
(CHUCKLES) No, I'm not.

991
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,104
You're a good guy, right? I mean...

992
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:47,023
Just...

993
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,067
Don't let him down.

994
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:55,323
Who the hell can promise that?

995
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:05,625
What're you doing?

996
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,143
- What were you doing over there?
- I thought something was wrong.

997
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:10,463
I... He's...

998
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:13,007
- He's not touching you, is he?
- Jesus Christ, Mom!

999
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,967
No, he's not touching me.
Stay out of my life, okay?

1000
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:16,052
I stay out of your...

- Yeah.
- What is that?

00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:23,476
Is that...

1005

Wait, I'm a slut, is that what you think?

1006
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,897
No. No, no.
I'm not saying that you're a slut.

1007
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,482
I go on dates, Ed.

1008
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,567
I'd like to find love, if that's all right.

1009
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:33,736
And if I have to
kiss a lot of frogs to do it...

1010
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,321
Okay, but do you have to fuck 'em?

1011
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:39,533
I like sex.

1012
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,910
Okay, Mom. That's enough. Thank you.

1013
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,245
No, it's not enough.

1014

I'm not done with you.

1015
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:45,164
I'm a sexual being.

1016
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,375
I enjoy having sex.

1017
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:49,669
They're assholes, Mom.
They're assholes.

1018
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:50,920
None of them deserve you.

1019
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,464
Okay? They don't deserve you.

1020
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,715
I know. But, I...

1021

Mom, they don't.

1022
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:58,664
I don't see how you don't see it.

1023
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,346
- I do see that.
- You don't see it.

01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:04,809
I've got to try.

1025

I'm also going inside.

- Give it to him. Give it to him!

- Really?
- He's just a pansy, man.

Catch the ball
and then turn it up the field!

All I saw out there were mistakes!

Coach Wally, I think
we need some tests.

Too fat, Coach Wally.

It's a neurolinguistic thing.

Just think coconuts,
and it'll taste like coconuts.

I can cure polio with my mind too,

to get an interim look at your heads.

It was Spain. I was in Spain.

1153
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:37,636
You know, when she was...

1154
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:44,435
When she was 19, she was...

1155
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:45,811
She was troubled.

1156
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:47,730
She...

1157
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,899
She couldn't find her place.

1158
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,863
Years and time went by,
she just needed me to hold her hand.

1159
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:58,198
You know, like when she was little.

1160

You know, she used to...

1161
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:04,663
Just hold on to my hand
and she'd grip it really tight.

1162
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:10,919
And she looked at me with,
with them, with them eyes that...

1163
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:16,008
That thanked me
for knowing how to keep her safe.

1164
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,513
Maybe she

1165
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,434
looked around for me like that,

1166
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:29,021

Yeah, like, in the way
that I have handled the Eloise situation.

1199
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:24,803
Like, if it'd gone any further with her,

1200
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:26,680
I would've stepped in for sure.

it about them or me with her,

1459
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:56,836
Just so you know...

1460
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:01,048
I think what you did was wrong.

1461
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,375
(SCATTERED CHATTER)

1462
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:40,046
Young fella.

1463
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:45,885
I'll just take that.

1464
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:52,183
Entwistle, two sugars, right?

1465
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,519
Well, Ashby.

1466
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:57,146
What a surprise.

1467
01:27:58,065 --> 01:27:59,398
You hear Pete got clipped?

1468
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:01,359
I did.

1469
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,070
Probably screwed around

1470
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:06,822
with the wrong guy's wife.

1471
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:10,201
He didn't deserve to die.

1472
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:14,747
- Garret Hughes.
- Well...

1473
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:15,957
What do we know about him? I mean,

1474
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,541
really what do we know about him?

1475
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:18,918
Maybe he was a pedophile.

1476
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:21,712
Liked young kids, young boys,
young girls, you don't know.

1477

What are you, God? You Moses?

1478
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,049
You have a tablet? You have a ledger?

1479
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:26,717
You know,

1480
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:29,929
you've always been
a self-righteous prick.

1481
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:31,305
We kill people.

1482
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:32,682
That's what we do.

1483
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:34,517
For our country.

1484
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:36,644
Bullshit.

1485
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,646
You like killing people.

1486
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:39,730
We all did.

1487
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:41,816
He was just another one.

1488
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:48,864
You remember these?

1489
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:51,909
Cuba.

1490
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:53,661
If only Fidel drank tea.

- I believe freedom needs to be protected.
- (WHEEZING)

1492
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:08,384
And costs will be borne.

1493
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:13,723
And scumbags like you will highjack that.

1494
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:17,268
And just grab it
for a big house and a big pool.

1495
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:28,612
It's just a green sticker.

1496
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:29,947
It's not poison.

1497
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:32,658
I'd love to kill you.

1498
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:37,955
But I promised somebody I wouldn't.

01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:16,368
"Where are these boys' brains?"

"Where are these boys' hearts?"

We need you to think about that.

Excuse me.

What did you say?

1513

I said...

1514
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:42,686
Fuck 'em.

Is this, this guy's fucking game? No.

stripped the gears anyway.

Be careful of what
and who you believe in.

1582
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:03,715
Find someone that you love fiercely.

1583
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:06,093
And who loves you back the same way.

1584
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:08,178
And you treat them well.

1585
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:10,431
And you know it's of value.
