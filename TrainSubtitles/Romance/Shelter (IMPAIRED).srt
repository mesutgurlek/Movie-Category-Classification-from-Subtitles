00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,320
见鬼 有这么糟吗?
Shit, dad's mad.

143
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,300
我才哄他睡着  I just put him to bed.
好啦 他不是睡着了么  Oh come on, he can sleep through anything.

144
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,910
小点声 知道吗?

145
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,550
他认真的？Did you get the cigarettes?

146
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,140
看来我逮住了你最新一次的不告而入
I thought your ghetto ass would be done breaking and entering by now.

147
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,770
那就改密码啊 混球
Change of code, bitch!

148
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,020
下次该把你绑车库里吗？
What are you gonna do,attack the garage next?

149
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,460
可能不用
That might not go over.

150
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,140
你也知道 根据太平洋房主唬烂公约你可能不会想跟法庭打交道
With the Pacific Bluff homeowners agreement,
wouldn't wanna set your dad in trouble with the board.

151
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,260
圆得好
Step-dad.

152
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,580
我把长板搁这儿了
I left my longboard here.

153
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,280
没关系 还好么 伙计

So I haven't seen you since your graduation.
What have you been up to?

156
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,600
工作喽 你呢？
Nothing. Working, you know.How about you?

157
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,300
我回来玩几星期 房子正好没人
I'm in town for a few weeks.House is empty, I could enjoy it.

158
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,310
我可以放松 理一下头绪
Clear my head a little bit.

159
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,810
我以为你讨厌回来呢
I thought you hated it down here?

160
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,720
我想念大海
I miss the ocean.

161
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,060
伙计 你住洛杉矶

我在那儿不玩水

冲浪？Surfing?
当然Uh... yeah.

165
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,670
我想我还是可以教你些什么的
I suppose there's still a few things I could teach you.

166
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,460
你有得学了 花小子
You will soon learn, butterfly.

167
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,600
吹牛大师 你低估你的学生了
Perhaps master underestimates student.

168
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,330
放马过来吧 都市男

Are you gonna play or are you just gonna talk shit about me?

209
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,500
扔得漂亮
Nice throw.

你们那次洗劫了红酒柜
I bought you guys wine coolers.

214

That's why you never tell a woman how to cook a chicken.

218
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,550
你就不能闭会儿嘴吗？
<i>I can't believe you got shot by a chick.</i>

你的电池快不行了

很帅的海扁他

289
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,320
他可以穿着那身漂亮正装去海扁他
He's wearing a sweet suit And he's gonna kick his ass.

290
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,920

Dude, it's a fucking circus out there.

298
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,740
我会挡在小朋友前保护你

299
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,290

302
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,460
-很适合玩冲浪The waves are great.

303
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,670
噢 那儿 就那儿
Oh right there!

304

307
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,110
抱歉从没告诉你和Gabe这里
Sorry I never told you and Gabe about this place, man.

308
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,830
我只是不想这儿成为每周日早上狼藉乱搞的地方
I just didn't want it to turn into the remnants of your keggers every Sunday morning.

309
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,470
我以前常来这儿躲避烦恼
This is my place I used to get away to come and just think.

310
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,220
冲浪吗？And surf?
嗯And surf.

311
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,600
咱们开始吧
Let's go.

312
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,930
你还在考虑申请艺术学院的事吗？
So you still thinking about applying to art school?

313
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,280
我现在搞街头艺术
I do street art now.

314
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,290
一样也很酷
It's cool though, you know.

315
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,430
你呢？
What are you working on?

316
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,090
呃 写书
A book.

317
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,900
怎么 追着上部写续集？
It's been like 3 years since the last one, right?

318
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,860
会更长篇吗？ Is is really long or something?
滚蛋 Fuck off.

319
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,480
像上部一样励志?
You sure didn't leave much out of the last one.

320
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:53,900
你读过?
You read it?

321
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,530
唔 太平洋的同志大暴乱太富戏剧性
Who knew there'd be so much drama inside the gates of Pacific Bluffs.

322
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,950
我不太懂
<i>I never knew.</i>

323
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,540
局外人永远不会了解内情的
You never really know what's happening inside.

324
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,250
这正是我乐见的
That's what I liked about it.

325
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,290
-我确实作了些润饰 到底是本小说
-就改几个名字？
<i>- I did embellish a little bit, it is fiction.
- You changed a couple of names?</i>

326
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,450
你什么时候看的？
When did you read it?

327
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,400
书刚一出来
When it came out.

328
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,690
奇怪Gabe从没提过
Funny, Gabe never mentioned anything.

329
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,010
我没跟他说过
I never told him.

330
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,640
他干嘛要跟你提
Why would he tell you?

331
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,190
呃 我只是一直不知道你有留意我
I just never knew that you knew about me.

332
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,110
新书写什么？
What's your new one about?

333
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,010
呃 我还在想
Still trying to figure that out.

334
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,040
主题还没选定
Don't really have a subject yet.

335
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,780
但我会有灵感的
But, I'll get it back.

336

希望是
I hope so.

338
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,570
-你真喜欢那本书？You really liked it?
-是的 Yeah.

339
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,770
你饿了吗？
You hungry?

340
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,450
-是啊　想去吃点什么吗?Yeah, you wanna go to the shack or something?
-当然 Yeah, definitely.

341

那么 你要在这儿待多久?
So, how long you staying around?

342
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,480
可能还有段时间
I'm gonna be here for a while.

我打算下月去巴塞罗那看朋友的  但是我没剩多少钱
I was supposed to go to Barcelona to meet a friend next month but I'm kinda broke.

344
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,590
找你父母借点钱啊
You should ask your stepfather for the cash.

345
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,660
唔 那不是我风格
That's not my style.

346
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,170
你有去过欧洲吗？
Have you ever been to Europe.

347
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,650
我去过佛罗里达一次
I've been to Florida once.

348
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,370
那阵子你父母带你去墨西哥了
And that time your parents took me to Mexico.

349
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,640
-我记得是那样That's about it.
-对噢That's right.

350
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,120

357
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,910
他就直接辗过停车牌...

422
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,440
你懂我意思 我不想让Cody受影响

429
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,180
你自己说呢

You've gotta fortify the corners of the moat first

447

00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,270
从没想过会有这么一天
Never thought I'd see the day.

705
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,640
是吗 过个十年你再跟我说这句
Give me 10 years and call me back about that.

706
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:14,060
是吗 我从没滑过长板(长板一般是慢划和初学者用)
Yeah, right. I'll never be on a longboard. Ever.

707
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,650
我都感到难为情
Alright, I'm getting beers.

708
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:20,920
怎样 宝贝?
What's up, babe?

709
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,880
Sean 你!
Shaun...

710
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,310
Sean 收敛些
Shaun, just chill.

711
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:46,800
嘿 Cods
Hey, Codes.

712
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:52,880
怎么了？
What's wrong?

713
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:55,590
Cody 你先回房间待会儿
Cody, go to your room for a second.

714
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,770
告诉我你只是有些困惑
Please tell me that he's just confused.

715
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,680
什么意思？
What do you mean?

716
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,310
Zach 为什么你不跟我说？
Zach, why didn't you tell me?

717
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,720
说什么？
Tell you what?

718
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:18,040
Ok 你的困惑是一回事
Ok, your confusion is one thing...

719
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:21,130
但把Cody也牵扯进来就太操蛋了
But bringing Cody into this is just totally fucked.

720
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,180
我没把他牵扯到任何里面!
I didn't bring him to anything!

721
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,860
－你带他去见Sean!You brought him to Shaun!
－他喜欢Sean!He likes Shaun!

722
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:25,860
Sean好过那个...
Shaun's better than...

723
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:28,580
不说那个了 不关Sean的事这是关于我们
You know what, forget it.It's not about Shaun, it's about us.

724
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,670
关于我们家
It is about our family.

725
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,120
有什么关系?
What about it?

726
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,860
Cody失去了父亲 他需要你 他需要一个正面的男人做楷模
Cody lost his father. He needs you. He needs a positive man in his life.

727
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:39,890
对不起 我不是Allen
I'm sorry I'm no Allen.

728
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:43,360
你什么都不懂 他只是个孩子
You don't know shit. He's a little kid.

729
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,120
他不会明白你那些
He's not gonna understand this.

730
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,260
在经过他妈的这么几年后?
You mother of the fucking year now?

731
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,610
噢 去你妈的
Oh fuck you.

732
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,050
没有我你早成什么样了
He'd be lost without me!

733
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,380
去你妈的 Zach
Fuck you, Zach!

734
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:55,240
Zach 你想把这个家搞垮么？
Zach, are you trying to fuck up our family?

735
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,640
是啊 Jeanne 这就是我想做的
Yeah, Jeanne.That's what I'm trying to do.

736
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,440
要知道Cody是因为我才知道什么叫家的
You know? Cody has a sense of family because of me.

737
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,630
妈妈死后我遗传了那该死的基因
Mom died and I got the family fucking gene.

738
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:07,350
哦 是家里的基因让你在外面搞同志的？
Oh, I see. So it's the 'family' gene that's making
you run off and have your big gay wedding?

739
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,140
你让这个家感到骄傲了?
You gonna make the family proud?

740
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,400
你在害怕什么?
Is that what you're scared of?

741
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,000
这跟Sean或者我无关
This isn't about Shaun, or me.

742
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,160
这是关于你被抛弃
This is about you being left.

743
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,720
而我是唯一没扔下你不管的人
I'm the only one who hasn't run off on you.

744
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,510
真贴心啊
Sweet.

745
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,920
继续啊 继续羞辱我啊
But go ahead, judge me.

746
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,920
我无所谓 你说对了
I don't care. You know? You're right.

747
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:33,960
没错 男人一个个抛弃我
Yeah, guys have left me.

748
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:39,260
但是Zach 现在你完全就是个混球
But, Zach, now you are just a Summer fuck, ok?

749
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:42,650
你跑去干男人的屁眼 好棒啊
You've reduced yourself to a little piece of ass

750
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,120
你对自己真不错啊
so, bravo! You are doing really well for yourself.

751
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:47,800
你有想过这会给他带来什么吗?
Do you think that is a good upbringing for him?

752
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,190
-我有Yes.
-有吗？ Do you?

753
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,900
不 我不知道 不知道
No, I don't know.

754
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,860
如果你有想过 你觉得会需要对我对Gabe 对Tori隐瞒么？
Well... if it is do you think you'd have to hide it from me, from Gabe, from Tori?

755
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:59,860
不 不 我不知道 行了吗?
I don't know!I don't fucking know, ok?

756
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,150
我只想知道什么对Cody最好
I just want what's best for Cody.

757
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,710
我也是
Well so do I!

758
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,680
对不起
Sorry.

759
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:03,300
上帝
Oh God.

760
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:06,400
嘿
Hey.

761
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,350
我需要点时间
I need some time.

762
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,580
我不知道这是不是我想要的
I just don't know if this is really what I want.

763
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,340
看上去像是你想要的
Seems like what you want.

764
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:25,910
我不知道这个...
I just don't know if this is what I want.

765
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,690
可不可以持久
For good.

766
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:32,950
这是什么意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

767
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,300
这对我并不像你那样轻松
It's not as easy for me as it is for you.

768
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:38,380
我对这完全陌生
You know, this is all totally new to me.

769
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:39,990
我们可以搞定Gabe...
We'll get through the Gabe thing...

770
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,150
不 不是那个 Sean
No it's not that, Shaun.

771
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,610
你不明白
You just don't get it, ok?

772
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:45,440
我不能要什么就提出什么 I can't just take whatever I want.
我的生活不是那样 My life is not like that.

773
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,900
你永远不知道要什么 除非你提出来
You'll never get what you want unless you take it.

774
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,230
提出来?
Take it...

775
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:53,520
你和Gabe习惯了指着什么提要求You and Gabe have always been able to point and take.
当然没问题No questions asked.

776
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:57,270
你不懂别人的生活不是那样  这真他妈的无知
You don't realize it's not like that for other people.It's fucking ignorant.

777
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,880
噢 那你和Jeanne就整天埋怨别人 因为你没法替自己着想?
Oh and you and Jeanne just blame everyone elsebecause you can't do anything for yourselves?

778
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,790
你管这叫什么?
What do you call that?

779
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:12,350
听我说 操
Look... fuck!

780
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:14,930
你干嘛这么对自己?
Why are you doing this?

781
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:18,750
因为我是个情绪化的同志 Ok?
Don't go all emotional and faggy on me, ok?

782
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,900
什么?
What?

783
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,870
我厌恶了做你的梦中情人 Sean
I'm sick of being your childhood wet dream, Shaun.

784
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:27,900
你另外找人性幻想去
Find another fucking fantasy!

785
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,430
知道吗 你是他妈的懦夫
You know what? You're a fucking coward!

786
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,510
我说完了
I'm done.

787
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,080
你是懦夫
You're a fucking coward.

788
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:33,680
我说完了
I'm done.

789
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:34,910
出去!
Get out!

790
01:01:58,610 --> 01:01:59,630
我们打烊了
We're closed!

791
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:07,460
怎么了 老兄
What's up, bro?

792
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,020
好啊 伙计
Good, brother.

793
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:12,070
妈的 我酒现在还没醒
I'm so hungover...

794
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:14,930
厨房收了 要不要来杯咖啡？
Kitchen's closed.Do you want a coffee?

795
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,010
好 谢谢
Yes, please.

796
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:19,730
你还好吧
So what's up?

797
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:24,180
你没说一声就走了 昨晚没见你离开
I'm taking off later today.Never saw you leave last night.

798
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,190
-那么...So...
-那么?So?

799
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,480
为什么你不告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me?

800
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:39,210
告诉你什么
Tell you what?

801
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:43,910
我不介意 一点也不
I don't care... at all.

802
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:46,890
我不懂你说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

803
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:53,680
你一直...都知道吗?
Have you always known?

804
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:54,990
说真的 伙计
Seriously, dude.

805
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:01,500
Ok
Ok.

806
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,390
其实上是我老哥怪的离谱
The fact that it's my brother is totally weird.

807
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:08,900
我知道
I know.

808
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:09,720
不 就是…
No, like...

809
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,040
是很怪很怪那种
really really fucking weird.

810
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,980
好了 我懂了 对不起
Alright, I got it.I'm sorry.

811
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:17,270
别说对不起
Don't be sorry.

812
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:19,180
别告诉别人 好吗?
Don't tell anyone, ok?

813
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:21,730
好
Ok.

814
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:24,500
这么说你有过其他男人了?
So are you going with other guys?

815
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:25,490
不是
No!

816
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,630
听说他们口技更好 他们口技是不是更好?
I heard they give better head.They give better head, don't they?

817
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,490
伙计 别说了
Dude, stop!

818
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,060
-他们做深喉吗?Do they swallow?
-Gabe

819
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,550
门外那个性感吗？
Do you think he's hot?

820
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,850
给我他妈闭嘴!
Shut the fuck up, dude!

821
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,230
好吧
Fine.

822
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:48,550
-那么 你昨晚去哪儿了So, where'd you go last night?
-睡我车里了I slept in my car.

823
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:50,410
你为什么不来我家?
Why didn't you just crash at mine?

824
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,060
这不一定改变什么
This doesn't have to change things.

825
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:58,270
不会改变什么? 你说得对 Gabe
Doesn't change things?You're right, Gabe.

826
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,770
我是你之前倾吐的对象 记得吗?
I used to be the guy you came and talked to, remember?

827
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,190
在Sean之前?
Before Shaun.

828
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:04,260
这对我来讲也不轻松
This isn't exactly easy on me.

829
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,400
你不轻松 没错
This isn't easy on you, right?

830
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,440
算了 已经结束就别再提了
You know what? It's over anyway.So just leave it, dude.

831
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,200
我还要收拾 你得走了
I've gotta clean up and you've gotta leave.

832
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:28,220
我们还是兄弟对吗?
Hey, we're still bros, alright?

833
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,520
我说真的
I mean it.

834
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:32,430
过来
Come here.

835
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:41,130
我能进来蹭一晚吗?
Can I please just come in and crash?

836
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:12,170
Jeanne
Jeanne?

837
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,190
什么事?
What?

838
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,340
你看见我的材料了吗? 我到处都找不到
Have you seen my portfolio?I can't find it anywhere.

839
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:17,400
我不知道
I don't know.

840
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,590
我申请加州艺术学院的材料
The portfolio I was putting together for CalArts.

841
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:20,950
没 我没看见
No, I haven't seen it.

842
