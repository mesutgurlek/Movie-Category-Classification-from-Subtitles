our favorite alumnus,

and the next senator from
the state of New York,

David Norris!

Thank you. Thank you.

00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,647
Well, hi, there.

9
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,315
My name is David Norris,

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,569
and I'd like to be the next senator
from the great state of New York.

11
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,072
Look at you. What's your name?

12
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,574
I'm going to go through
Yonkers, door to door

13
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,701
and take the city that way. We love you.

14
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,453
The recent endorsement by
the fire fighter's union

15
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,912
is another boost to Norris

16
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,706
who already had a six-point lead

17
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,249
over his opponent, Roger Linfield.

18
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,211
Whenever I see you on
C-Span, and you stand,

19
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,672
I always think you're
about to go, "Chug!"

20
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,258
Congressman, you certainly
started your career off,

21
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,553
eight years ago, with a
bang or should I say, a bust.

BLOOMBERG: For the last eight years,

24
00:01:56,033 --> 00:02:00,620
David Norris has represented
Brooklyn, New York City and America.

25
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,872
This is my campaign
chairman, Charlie Traynor.

These are voters.

27

Latest polls have you up 10 points.

28

DAVID: We're 10 points up?

29
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,670
This is not going to
be easy getting there.

30
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,172
I have some real opposition,

31
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,507
and what they're saying about me

32
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,592
is that I'm too young
to hold this office.

33
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,177
Win big, but run like you're 20 down.

34
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,386
Okay, you got it.

Thank you, Gary.

36

these are the same people

who say that young people don't vote,

38

young people don't care about politics,

but I'm here to tell you,

40

your future is about
your choices, not theirs.

So, today I'd like to put them on notice

because come November,
I want them to know

43

that it was young people like you,

NEWSCASTER: David Norris,

58
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,525
until recently, he was
way ahead in the polls.

59

Mary Matalin and James
Carville are here.

Mary, this is a surprise.

61
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,741
MARY: It is a surprise.
Such political promise.

62
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,410
This compelling story, he grew up
in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn.

63
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,454
He overcame the loss
of his entire family,

64
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,331
his mom and his brother when he was 10,

65
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,917
his father before he got to
high school, he got over that.

66
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,168
He had such promise.

67
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,879
And he was the youngest person

68
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,881
ever elected to the
House of Representatives.

69
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,675
JAMES: Yeah, he was elected
when he was actually 24,

70
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,803
but he gets in a bar room fight
the night that he's elected.

71
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,263
I like this, all right.

Then you have this photo
coming out of the New York Post.

00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,935
I think the accretion of this stuff

74

was just too much for the voters.

of immaturity here,

they want adults in Congress.

I heard you come in and say, "Hello,"

because it's the men's.

Then you started talking to yourself

Really? I could have used you on my team

174
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,212

175
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,379
I could help poll test

your mouth before you say it.

Oh, you like politicians?

00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,761
I like it when they do
stuff I can relate to.

even get elected to the student council.

My guy would know how
to tie his own tie.

Oh, I wish.

185
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,900
That would have been my other
favorite moment of your campaign.

186

Do you still have a chance?

187
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,989

been more convincing.

It's bullshit.

We didn't have that
saying in my neighborhood.

244
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,419
It's just one of those phrases

245
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,089
that had some traction
with the focus group

246
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,134
and so we kept using
it, but it's not true.

In 1998, I did a cover story for GQ.

The title was "Youngest
Congressman Ever."

249

And since then, every story has tried

250
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,145
to explain how I got here so fast.

251
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:57,359

kept using was "authentic."

This isn't even my tie.

Go get Jim for me. This
tie was selected for me

00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,460
by a group of specialists
in Tenafly, New Jersey

who chose it over 56
other ties we tested.

In fact, our data suggests
that I have to stick to

259
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:26,847
either a tie that is red
or a tie that is blue.

260

A yellow tie made it look as if
I was taking my situation lightly,

lawyers and bankers.

If you want to get a working man's vote,

268
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,164
you need to scuff up
your shoes a little bit.

269
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,665
But you can't scuff them up so much

270
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,334
that you alienate the
lawyers and the bankers

271
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,587
because you need them to pay for
the specialists back in Tenafly.

272
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,757
So, what is the proper scuffing amount?

273
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,969
Do you know we actually
paid a consultant $7,300...

Were you just staring
at my legs while I slept?

I was defenseless
against the small dress.

It's a skirt.

You have to run again.
You can't do that.

too high on these things.

00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,062
Your path through the world this morning

488
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,688
was supposed to have been adjusted.

489
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:07,607
You were supposed to spill your coffee

490
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,651
as you entered the park this morning.

491
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,277
You would have gone upstairs to change,

492
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,737
you would have missed the bus,

493
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,073
and you would have arrived at work

494
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,075
10 minutes later than you did,

495
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,785
and we would have been gone.

496
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,745
I was supposed to spill my coffee?

497
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,997
We call that an adjustment.

498
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,124
See, sometimes, when
people spill their coffee

499
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,459
or their Internet goes out

500
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,170
or they misplaced their
keys, they think it's chance.

501
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,089
And sometimes it is.

502
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,341
Sometimes it's us... (TIRES SQUEALING)

503
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,718
...nudging people back on plan.

504
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,013
Sometimes when nudging isn't enough,

505
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,100
management authorizes a recalibration.

506
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,894
We deploy our Intervention Team

507
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,146
and they change your mind for you,

508
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,691
like we did with your friend Charlie.

509
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,361
He's fine, by the way.

510
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,946
You don't need to worry about him.

511
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,447
Now...

512
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,618
There is something I need you to
understand if I'm going to let you go.

513
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,453
Okay.

514
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,247
Very few humans have seen
what you've seen today,

515
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,707
and we're determined
to keep it that way.

516
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,252
So, if you ever reveal our existence,

517
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,838
we'll erase your brain.

518
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,382
The Intervention Team will reset you.

519
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,884
Your emotions, your memories,

520
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,721
your entire personality
will be expunged.

521
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,973
Your friends and family
will think you've gone crazy.

522
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,852
You won't think anything.

523
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,234
You understand?

524
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,739
Not one word about us.

525
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,158
Okay.

526
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:43,870
Oh, one more thing, you bumped into
a woman this morning on the bus.

527
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,038
Elise?

528
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,874
What does that have to do with anything?

529
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,001
You were never supposed
to see her again.

530
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,088
What does that matter?

531
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,923
Because it matters.

532
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,344
McCRADY: It's in his
wallet. Hey, hey. God! Hey!

533
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,264
What's with you guys? Jesus!

534
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:09,354
Oh, come on. No! No!

535
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,564
What the hell?

536
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,275
Really?

537
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,528
What the hell?

538
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,198
Okay.

539
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,993
Okay. Take him back.

540
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,119
Enjoy the rest of your day.

541
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,622
I can walk. I'm capable of walking.

542
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,136
Dude, what are you doing on my floor?

543
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,972
You know, I called you like 10
times, you could have picked up.

544
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,937
Christine, I found
him. He's in my office.

545
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,355
What the hell are you doing?

546
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,235
Round up the guys, we're
going to do the meeting now.

547
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,654
You have a headache?

548
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,489
What is wrong with you?

549
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,954
Hey, we're in the big
conference room on 17. Let's go.

550
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,506
Morning, Congressman.

551
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,217
You sure you're okay?

552
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,927
Yeah, you?

553
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,137
I'm great, why?

554
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,847
You don't have a headache or anything?

555
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,765
No, I feel fantastic, man.

556
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,351
Is it me or this an odd conversation?

557
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,145
WOMAN: On David's solar panel deal,

558
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,563
our tech guy has serious doubts

559
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,690
about the efficiency
ratings they're claiming.

560
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,984
They'd need a 20-fold improvement
over anything anyone else

561
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:41,571
has been able to manufacture at that
price point to really be a game-changer.

562
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,866
MAN: You're opposed to this anyway,
Charlie. And with these financials...

563
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,034
CHARLIE: Whoa, whoa. I know it's a risk,

564
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,205
but if our company doesn't take a chance
on something like this, then who will?

565
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:55,293
I mean, I'm willing to take a fire on
something that could change the world.

566
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,547
Not to mention, be incredibly lucrative.

567
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,304
David?

568
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,561
Yeah, I mean, it's why
I took the job here.

569
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,481
CHARLIE: All right.

570
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,399
Let's do it.

571
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,322
Come into my office for a second.

572
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,953
Something is wrong.

573
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:34,499
A couple of hours ago you miraculously
reunite with the girl of your dreams.

574
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,418
Explain to me why you don't have
an ear-to-ear grin right now.

575
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,344
I lost her number.

576
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:47,512
What?

577
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,474
The woman on the bus.

578
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:56,562
I lost her phone number and all
I had was her first name, so,

579
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,483
I'm never going to see her again.

580
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,445
I'm sorry.

581
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,114
Wow, I'm really sorry.

582
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,787
HARRY: Your entire world
is turned upside down

583
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,123
and you're thinking about a woman.

584
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,751
Even if you could remember the number,

585
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,336
you'll never get through.

586
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,630
Lost cell phone, changed numbers,

587
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:07,008
whatever creates the fewest ripples.

588
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,260
My name is Harry, by the way.

589
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,722
The fewest ripples?

590
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:18,352
You freeze people. You froze my friend.

591
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,313
We need special authorization to...

592
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,939
Poke around in people's brains.

593
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,107
You make them think whatever you want...

594
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,400
Be quiet, David.

595
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,526
Can I get you something?

596
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,528
Just some water, please.

597
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,655
Your friend will be fine.

598
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,076
Recalibrations make tiny
changes in the way people reason.

599
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,787
It doesn't work on
emotion or personality.

600
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,456
That's too intrusive.

601
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,916
You said authorization.
Authorization from who?

602
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,251
The Chairman.

603
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,336
The Chairman?

604
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,462
(SHUSHING)

605
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,797
That's just a name we use.

606
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,634
You use many other names.

607
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,430
We can't talk here.

608
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:00,186
Meet me on the 4:00 p.m. boat
and I'll answer what I can.

609
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,649
If you reveal us, even
if it's unintentional...

610
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,484
I know. You'll bump me on the head.

611
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:10,571
Richardson has automatic
authority to reset you.

612
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,491
You mean lobotomize me?

613
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,534
Try not to forget it.

614
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,411
Be on the 4:00 p.m. boat.

615
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:37,390
Ask your questions,
I'll tell you what I can.

616
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,267
What were they doing to Charlie?

617
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,187
Just changing the way he
weighs investment risks

618
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:47,441
which will subtly shift the direction
of his company in the way upstairs wants.

619
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,694
So, Richardson could read my mind?

620
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,654
Richardson was trying to scare you.

621
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,365
No, he knew the number I
was thinking of, the color.

622
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,200
Because he set it up as a choice.

623
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,452
"Choose a color, choose a number."

624
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,497
We can't read your mind
or hear your thoughts.

625
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:05,209
When you make a decision,
your mind weighs options.

626
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,627
We can perceive them.

627
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,338
We know when you're going to
go off the plan or not because

628
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:10,965
if we're close enough,

629
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,967
we can sense when it's going to happen.

630
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,136
We're just here to keep you on plan.

631
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,096
That's all we're authorized to do.

632
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,390
Are you allowed to be
telling me this stuff?

633
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,350
Are they following me now?

634
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,477
We have to monitor the entire world.

635
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:27,523
We don't have the manpower to
follow everyone all the time.

636
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,526
And there is something about water.

637
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,487
It blocks our ability to
read your decision tree.

638
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,614
Are you an angel?

639
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,825
We've been called that.

640
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,202
We're more like case officers

641
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,038
who live a lot longer than humans.

642
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,707
Why are you helping me?

643
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,417
I have my reasons.

644
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,670
And why won't they let me be with Elise?

645
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,758
All I know is the amount
of resources they've used

646
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:57,511
keeping you from her is
pretty damn important to them.

647
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,807
You're going to look
for her, aren't you?

648
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,643
You won't find her.

649
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,854
They'll make sure of it.

650

Even if they weren't trying to stop you,

651

there are nine million
people in this city.

652
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,196
You'll never find her.

653
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,282
Forget about her.

654
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,367
Move on with your life.

00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,966
Elise? Elise, hi.

658
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,759
David.

659
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,805
You know, I rode the M6 to
work every day for three years

660
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,474
hoping that I'd bump into you.

661
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,936
Listen, is there a place
we could go and talk?

662
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,688
(SIGHING)

663
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,399
Don't you have to get
to work or something?

664
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,609
I just got sick.

665
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,485
"I haven't seen you in three
years, you make me sick."

666
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,446
That's not an ideal
come-on, just so you know.

667

What are you looking
for? (CELL PHONE RINGING)

668
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,657
I felt like someone was watching us.

669
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,327
Hey, Charlie, I'm going
to have to skip breakfast,

670
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,330
and I probably have to postpone the
speech, too. I just bumped into Elise.

671
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,915
You just hung up on your friend.

672
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,374
We've known each other
since we were kids.

673
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,751
What speech? It doesn't matter.

674
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,753
You want to take a walk? No.

675
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:36,879
We have a lot to catch up on.

676
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,255
I don't think you should
cancel your speech.

677
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,341
What if I don't like you
at the end of our walk?

678
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:41,800
I'll take my chances.

679
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,427
Seriously, my number hasn't changed,

680
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,512
just call me like you didn't last time.

681
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,349
Look, if you take a walk
with me, I'll explain why.

682
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,645
It's been years. How do you know
I don't have a nice boyfriend?

683
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,605
Do you have a nice boyfriend?

684
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,023
Would it matter if I did?

685
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,107
Yeah.

686
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,109
So you don't have any
real conviction then?

687
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,486
Okay, it wouldn't matter at all.

688
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,613
So, you don't mind
being a home-wrecker?

689

MAN: Congressman!

690
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,283
How are you doing, man? I'm
from Red Hook. You're the best.

691
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,327
Thank you. Good to see you.

692
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,789
If you were married,
then it would bother me.

693
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,959
But now you're just saying
what you think I want to hear.

694
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,961
I'm single.

695
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,964
Now let's hear your bullshit
excuse for not calling me.

696
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,090
I didn't have your number.

697
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,758
I gave it you on the
bus. Handed it to you.

698
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,760
I was mugged. It was taken from me.

699
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,011
No, come on.

700
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:28,389
My wallet was taken. Come on.

701
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,349
Why else would I fawn
all over you on a bus

702
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,809
three years ago and then never call you?

703
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,812
Because, I don't know! You have a
girlfriend and you felt terrible.

704
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:38,607
Listen, I swear to you that
I did not have your number.

705
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:39,733
All right.

706
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,361
No, on my parents' graves.

707
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,445
That's heavy.

708
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,905
That's too heavy, I know, but it's true.

709
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,573
I didn't have your number.

710
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,492
And I didn't even have
a last name to go by.

711
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,619
If you google just "Elise,"

712
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:53,914
you get 757,000 hits. You did not.

713
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,457
And none of them are you.

714
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,220
We have a problem.

715
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,596
What?

716
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,140
David Norris is off plan.

717
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,977
(SIGHS) Son of a bitch.
How did he find her?

718
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,813
Chance. Just spotted her on the street.

719
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,065
We never should have let him
meet her in the first place.

720
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,359
We followed protocol to the letter.

721
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:25,070
Guy rides the same bus
every day for three years.

722
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,655
Who does that?

00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,244
Three years later, I'm
still cleaning up your mess.

725
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,504
Let's cut the power at her dance studio.

726
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,506
I'm a dancer.

727
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:45,591
Oh.

728
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,301
Not like that, you pervert.

729
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,053
I'm in a contemporary ballet company.

730
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,763
I think you have the
wrong idea about me.

731
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,432
No, I think that was the first thing
that crossed your mind, actually.

732
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,976
I think you should invite me
to one of your performances.

733
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,853
The company is called Cedar Lake,

734
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,065
and there is actually a show
tomorrow night, if you want.

735
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,192
Is that an invitation?
No, it's information.

736
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,027
We're covering the
girl's artistic director

737
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,071
and we're still working
on Charlie Traynor.

738
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,989
This whole thing will
be over in an hour.

DAVID: Hi, how are you? Paul, right?

740
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:12,409
PAUL: How did you remember that?

741
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:13,911
DAVID: I'm a politician,
I'm good with names.

742
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,121
Her decision tree is
diverging from our models.

743
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:17,206
PAUL: It's just the two of you?

744

hours without contact,

746
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,376
she'll never speak to him again.

747
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,503
Look at her file.

748
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,838
It's the last thing in the
world she'll put up with.

749
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,050
No, something's wrong. I'm
already seeing inflection points.

You okay?

752
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,847
Yeah.

753
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,937
We're in motion on changing
the location of her rehearsal.

754
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,065
You have to be born with the right body

755
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,110
like very flexible hips
and shoulders and long neck.

756
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,194
And you weren't?

757
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,946
No, I was. I was lucky.

758
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,533
But after 15 years of that
precision and the training...

759
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,784
How is everything over here?

760
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,202
It's great. Thank you.

It's good, thank you.

ELISE: So, I wanted to try
something else just on my own,

763

Look.

766
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,469
What's this?

767
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:14,012
If they kiss.

768
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,807
A kiss? That's all it takes?

769
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:17,975
A real kiss.

770
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,685
If that happens, every
possible adjustment

771
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:20,853
strong enough to break them up

772
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:23,522
will cause ripples over your limit.

(SIGHING)

774
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,191
I think that everything
you go through in life

775
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,318
should come out in
the way that you dance.

I haven't found that to be
the case with my dancing.

Hi. Hi, nice to see you again, Elise.

How did you find me?

782
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,914
Does it matter?

783
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:42,833
Nice work.

You're announcing today?
You can't skip this for me.

787
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,341
I know. I told you I'm not
going to let you out of my sight.

788

David, what the hell?
Do you want to come?

789
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:54,511
Do you want to watch?

790
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,097
No. I can't, I have to go and rehearse.

Actually, I just heard that
they're moving my rehearsal

792
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,767
to Pier 17, right next to the bridge.

793
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,812
Why don't we just postpone it?
We'll do the speech another time.

794
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:05,272
No, David, come on, you can't do that.

795
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,356
Thank you.

You have to go. Check.

David, she's rehearsing so close.

It'll take you three minutes
to get there after the speech.

00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,542
the constant inflection points,

970
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,128
and the kicker, you
pulling them apart twice

971
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,881
only to have chance
put them back together.

972
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,550
Yeah, all that seemed a little much.

973
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:21,346
So, I asked Burdensky to do
some research this morning.

974
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,474
Have you been in here before?

975
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,184
No, of course not.

976
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,436
It seems like David
Norris and Elise Sellas

977
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:29,521
were meant to be together

978
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:32,440
because they were meant to be together.

979
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,651
Wait, what?

980
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,069
DONALDSON: In the '70s when he was born,

981
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,487
they were meant to be together,

982
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,948
same thing in the '80s, '90s.

983
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:42,575
Wasn't till 2005 that the plan changed

984
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,787
and she was supposed
to stay with Adrian.

985
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:54,879
The problem here is there are
remnants from all those old plans

986
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:57,423
that keep pushing them together.

987
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,718
They still feel like they belong with
each other even though they don't,

988
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:03,513
and we're about to
tear them apart again.

989
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,821
You spend your whole career

990
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,074
hoping, someday, you'll
get a red-letter case.

991
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:26,119
Something you can really
make a name for yourself with.

992
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,163
Finally you get one,

993
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:31,040
and it's booby-trapped.

994
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,792
What?

995
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:35,628
I'm saying, it wasn't your fault.

996
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,339
They were meant to be together.

997
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:39,883
What?

998
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,468
Were. In an earlier version of the plan.

999
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,804
Actually, a dozen earlier versions.

1000
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,267
I always wondered how
we had such bad luck

1001
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:53,980
that she was on that particular
bus on that particular day.

1002
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,608
How could a plan just change like that?

1003
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,651
I don't know.

1004
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,446
It's above my pay grade.

1005
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,323
So, we're going operational.

1006
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,908
This is exciting. It's been a while.

1007
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:08,369
We're not going operational.

1008
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:12,999
No one ever made it to my
job by taking stupid risks.

1009
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,792
So, what are we going to do?

1010
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,711
We're going to kick this case upstairs

1011
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,797
to someone with the latitude
to clean up this mess

1012
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,466
without breaking into a sweat.

1013
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,635
We're going to bring this to Thompson.

1014
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:24,969
Thompson?

1015
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,764
When he was in the
field, his nickname was...

1016
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,474
"The Hammer," yes.

1017
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:32,852
He'll crush this little
romance with a flick of his hand

1018
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,562
and force them back on plan again.

1019
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:36,606
I want to go to a club.

1020
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38,775
Oh! Why ruin a really nice day?

1021
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,610
Come on. No, I don't dance.

1022
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,613
Everyone can dance.
You just feel the music.

1023
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,407
Well, I've been told that
I have trouble feeling.

1024
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,951
Who told you that?

1025
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,953
A long list of women.

1026
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,204
That's gross.

1027
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,538
You know what?

1028
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:55,083
Let's race to that lamppost.

1029
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,585
You win, I dance for you.

1030
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:01,130
I win, you dance for me.

1031
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:02,757
On the pole?

1032
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,133
If you like, yeah.

1033
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:05,969
This is serious. What are the rules?

1034
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,387
There are no rules.

1035
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,722
Oh! You bastard! Oh, my gosh!

1036
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,475
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1037
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,143
You challenged me in those shoes?

1038
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:15,770
Okay, fine. I can't.

1039
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,439
You're right. These are the wrong
shoes. I'm going to twist an ankle.

1040
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:20,566
You said, "No rules." I avoided them.

1041
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:21,776
Ow!

1042
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,030
You said you had trouble feeling.

1043
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:28,866
Great.

1044
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,541
Hey, David.

1045
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,042
You're even cuter in person.

1046

DAVID: Hey, how you doing?

1051
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,553
Maybe I should go home and get my tux.

1052
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:51,097
Definitely don't do that. It's good.

1053
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,600
I should never have come back here
again without my backup dancers.

1054
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,731
I voted for you.

1055
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:00,982
How are you?

MAN 3: Norris, you're a rock star!

1058
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,377
Did you grow up over here?

1059
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:25,089
Yeah, three blocks over
that way. Pioneer Street.

1060
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:26,382
My whole childhood.

1061
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,509
What were you like as a kid?

1062
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:31,929
I've spent about half my
time in the principal's office

1063
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:33,181
up until the sixth grade.

1064
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,223
Wow.

1065
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:37,310
Yeah, that was when my
mother and my brother died

1066
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:38,811
within a month of each other.

1067
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:39,896
I'm sorry.

1068
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,814
No, it's fine.

1069
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,107
You know how I always tell that story

1070
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:45,818
about how I got inspired
to go into politics

1071
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,029
because my dad took me
to the Senate Gallery

1072
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,656
and we sat together and that's true.

1073
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,076
But what I leave out is

1074
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,161
he did that right after they died.

1075
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:58,414
And I was bottoming out.

1076
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:02,418
So, he wanted to get me out
of here for a little while

1077
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:05,296
and he planned this road trip to DC,

1078
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,507
and I think it's
because JFK was his idol.

1079
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:10,760
And we went and sat in the gallery.

1080
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:15,139
I remember watching him watch them,

1081
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:18,184
and I knew that that's
what I wanted to do.

1082
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,688
I wish they were here to see all this.

1083
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,819
I was...

1084
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:34,408
Didn't expect to tell you any of that.

No, I was...

Because I was sleeping.

Why are you calling?

Okay, well, I got to go.

No, I got to go. Okay.

I'm so sorry.

It's all right. Everything okay?

Yeah.

1103

Oh, my God. That was so weird.

1104
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,497
I woke up and you weren't here.

1105
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,583
And then the phone rang and it was my ex

1106
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:50,169
which is just so strange.

1107

Sorry, I guess we hadn't
gotten to any of that stuff yet.

1108

Right.

1109
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:56,175
You know, we broke up a while ago,

1110
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,679
and it's over and then he
calls four times in one morning.

1111
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,392
He called you four times this morning?

01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,496
I'm not some hopeless romantic.

1132
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,874
I've never allowed
myself to be that way.

1133
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,294
But once I felt,

1134
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,089
even for a moment, what I felt with you.

1135
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:23,429
You ruined me. I didn't
want to settle for less.

1136
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,349
I know the feeling.

1137

I'm not going to hurt you.

1141
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,573
This is the first time

1142
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:45,743

feel like I'm by myself.

me to give you a message.

1160
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:41,924
He was just called into a meeting.

1161
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,342
He says it's urgent. Okay.

1162
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,010
He said he'll call
you as soon as he's out

1165

This way, Congressman.

1166
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,916
Hello?

1167
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,715
Frustrating, isn't it?

1168
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,843
My name is Thompson.

1169
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,972
Whatever happened to free will?

1170
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,766
We actually tried free will before.

1171
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,394
After taking you from
hunting and gathering

1172
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:36,979
to the height of the Roman Empire,

1173
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:41,734
we stepped back to see how
you would do on your own.

1174
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:46,071
You gave us the Dark
Ages for five centuries

1175
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,825
until finally we decided
we should come back in.

1176
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:53,662
The Chairman thought that maybe
we just needed to do a better job

1177
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,748
with teaching you how to ride a bike

1178
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,833
before taking the
training wheels off again.

1179
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,878
So, we gave you the Renaissance,

1180
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:03,422
the Enlightenment,
scientific revolution.

1181
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,174
For 600 years we taught you

1182
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,510
to control your impulses with reason.

1183
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:12,181
Then in 1910, we stepped back again.

1184
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:16,936
Within 50 years, you had
brought us World War I,

1185
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:20,981
the Depression, Fascism, the Holocaust,

1186
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,317
and capped it off by
bringing the entire planet

1187
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,777
to the brink of destruction

1188
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:26,612
in the Cuban missile crisis.

1189
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,490
At that point a decision was
taken to step back in again

1190
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:33,661
before you did something
that even we couldn't fix.

1191
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,831
You don't have free will, David.

1192
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:41,335
You have the appearance of free will.

1193
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:43,837
You expect me to believe that?

1194
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:45,130
I make decisions every day.

1195
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:47,550
You have free will over
which toothpaste you use

1196
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,552
or which beverage to order at lunch.

1197
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,846
But humanity just isn't mature enough

1198
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,765
to control the important things.

1199
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,101
So, you handle the important things?

1200
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,562
The last time I checked, the
world is a pretty screwed-up place.

1201
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:01,981
It's still here.

1202
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:04,650
If we had left things in
your hands, it wouldn't be.

1203
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:06,569
Tell me why I can't be with Elise?

1204
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:09,154
Because the last guy didn't know.

1205
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:12,908
Meeting Elise at the Waldorf
three years ago wasn't chance.

1206
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:14,451
That was us.

1207
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:17,413
We knew she would inspire
you to give that speech.

1208
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:20,749
That speech that brought you
back from the edge of oblivion

1209
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:24,628
and overnight made you the
frontrunner in this coming election.

1210
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:26,714
What are you saying? You
want me to win the election?

1211
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:30,050
This one and four more after it.

1212

And I'm not just talking
about elections for Senate.

1213

took you to the Senate Gallery

when you were 10.

1216
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,025
What your brother wanted
when he made you promise

1217
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:47,860
the day before he overdosed

1218
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,987
that you wouldn't be like him.

1219
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:54,742
Why do you think you have that
yearning to be in front of people?

1220
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:59,330
That terrible emptiness when you're not.

1221
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:00,831
Don't do that.

1222
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,459
David, you can change the world,

1223
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:06,837
but that doesn't happen
if you stay with her.

1224
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,131
Why do you people care who I love?

1225
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:12,176
It's not about her, it's about you.

1226
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,970
What being with her does to you.

1227

I'm better when I'm with her!

Even you said it. The speech.

1230
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:22,811
In small doses, Elise was the cure.

1231
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,521
But in large doses,

1232
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:25,939
she rubs off on you.

1233
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:26,982
Stop.

can't be a loose cannon.

1235
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,529
Stop talking. It's not working.

1236
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:36,533
Why do you refuse to accept what
should be completely obvious by now?

01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:38,827
You've seen what we can do.

about what my fate is.

I know what I feel for her
and it's not going to change.

All I have are the choices that I make.

1244
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,107
And I choose her

1245

come what may.

Elise is about to become one of the

be better in a month or less.

1288
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:08,448
That's totally unexpected.

1289
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,325
(SIGHING) I'm so relieved.

1290
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,285
Great. Great.

1291
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:15,747
You're such a great dancer,

1292
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:21,044
and you'll heal up and
just get better and better.

1293
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,015
I'm going to go make
a couple phone calls.

1294
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:34,307
Okay.

1295
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,062
Okay.

1296
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:41,523
I'm so happy for you.

1297
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,309
RICHARDSON: It's done.
Thompson finished it.

1298
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:19,227
I know.

1299
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:23,648
You can't let it get to you

1300
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,151
like it did with his family.

1301
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,653
This is the job.

1302
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:39,331
HARRY: You ever wonder

1303
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,250
if it's right?

1304
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,503
I mean,

1305
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,297
if it's always right?

1306
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,343
RICHARDSON: Not like I used to.

1307
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:54,596
Look, Chairman has the plan.

1308
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,473
We only see part of it.

1309
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:24,960
I was talking to some friends of ours
over in Monroe County this morning,

1310
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:27,087
and I said something
to them that I think

1311
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:30,215
a lot of you may have heard me
say before but it bears repeating.

1312
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:34,261
David Norris, who has spent the last two
days campaigning in the Tri-Lakes area

1313
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:37,931
received some welcome news yesterday
when the latest New York Times poll

1314
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:40,392
gave him a 16-point
lead over his opponent

1315
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,727
less than a month before election day.

1316
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:45,230
Since his announcement 11 months ago,

1317
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,524
Norris has had a significant lead...

1318
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:50,193
Hi. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

1319
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,279
Yeah, thank you. I need it. Thank you.

1320
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:54,531
Who should I make it out
to? WOMAN: My nephew, Miles.

1321
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,074
There you go. Thank you so much.

1322
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,201
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

1323
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,079
MAN: Thank you. My pleasure. Pleasure.

1324
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:02,664
MAN 2: Can we get a picture with you?

1325
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,249
DAVID: Sure, come on.

1326
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,418
Thank you. Thanks.

1327
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:11,548
Hey.

1328
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,593
I want to show you this, because
you would find out eventually.

1329
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,428
I want to be here when you do.

1330
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:24,311
She's getting married to
that guy she was engaged to.

1331
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,732
You okay?

1332
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:31,109
I think I'm going to...

1333
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:32,903
Take a day off.

1334
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:35,614
Hell, take a couple. We're 16 points up.

1335
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,450
Yeah, even I can't blow a lead that big.

1336
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:49,646
BARTENDER: Congressman,
good to see you again.

1337
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:51,773
Your friend just left you this.

1338
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,358
He said you would be stopping by.

1339
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,715
Why would you want to see me?

1340
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,219
Thompson was lying when he said

1341
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:24,097
you couldn't be with Elise because
she brings out your reckless side.

1342
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:27,559
Then why? Why do they care so much?

1343
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,854
Because she's enough, David.

1344
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:32,731
If you have her,

1345
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,899
you won't need to fill
that void inside of you

1346
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,527
with applause and votes

1347
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:40,030
and dreams of one day
making it to the White House.

1348
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:43,950
That's important, but it's not
the only thing that matters.

1349
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,495
Why are you so different from them?

1350
01:17:56,756 --> 01:17:58,548
Your dad

1351
01:17:59,759 --> 01:18:02,260
was a very smart man.

1352
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:07,640
He could have been a
lot more. Wanted to be.

1353
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:11,186
Your brother, too.

1354
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,938
But the plan didn't call for it.

1355
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,524
What about my mother?

1356
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:17,942
That wasn't me.

1357
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:20,403
That wasn't us at all.

1358
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:22,572
It was just chance?

1359
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:27,660
I'm sorry.

1360
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:33,875
You know, Thompson is not lying.

1361
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:38,296
They're already talking about me
being a presidential candidate.

1362
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:41,508
I'm phoning in my speeches
and I'm 16 points up.

1363
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:43,468
The public loves you.

1364
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:46,596
Before I met Elise,
that's all I cared about.

1365
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:50,642
I don't even notice it now.

1366
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,483
I can't stop thinking about her.

1367
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,867
Do you know where she's getting married?

1368
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,997
In front of a judge tomorrow morning.

1369
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:15,166
Is she happy?

1370
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:20,547
Thompson won't let
you anywhere near her.

1371
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,091
Not tonight, not tomorrow, not ever.

1372
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:24,884
Harry.

1373
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,011
Is she happy?

1374
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,013
(SIGHS)

1375
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:32,684
I got to try and get her back.

1376
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:37,021
Will you help me? Will you
just help me get to her?

1377
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,274
They'll sense you coming a mile away.

1378
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:42,235
What if I could move as fast as you?

1379
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:45,989
Teach me about the doors.

1380
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:47,574
HARRY: The rain will
stop in the next hour,

1381
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:49,492
HARRY: The rain will
stop in the next hour,

1382
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,287
and that's the only thing keeping
them from seeing us right now.

1383
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:55,081
If we're going to do this,
we'll need all night to do it

1384
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:57,876
and a place surrounded
by water to do it in.

1385
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,671
Always turn the doorknob clockwise.

1386
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:03,965
What happens if I turn it the other way?

1387
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:06,843
You don't want to do
that. That's only for us.

1388
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,762
Put your hand on my shoulder

1389
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:12,182
and don't let go until
we cross the threshold.

1390
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:13,808
Are these ever locked?

1391
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:16,478
Not when you're wearing one of our hats.

1392
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,941
Keep moving, David.

1393
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,365
Is this...

1394
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,075
It's the Museum of Modern Art.

1395
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,327
Yeah.

1396
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:44,923
Close the door.

1397
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:55,183
This is the city's main pumping
station for downtown Manhattan.

1398
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,269
We're 10 blocks from the courthouse.

1399
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,026
Wait here.

1400
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:26,839
Hi, is the floor open?

1401
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,007
You okay, sweetie?

1402
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,093
Yeah, I just...

1403
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:34,305
I just feel like being on the floor.

1404
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:44,357
Lower Manhattan is layer
upon layer of substrate.

1405
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:47,360
That's what we call the doors
that have been added over time.

1406
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:51,823
Makes it a lot more complex to
navigate downtown than it is uptown

1407
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,324
and a lot slower.

1408
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:58,413
Your destination, 60 Centre
Street, Courtroom 300.

1409
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:04,752
There are thousands of different ways

1410
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,130
to get to the courthouse
using the doors.

1411
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:09,549
I want you to learn how
to stay in the substrate

1412
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:12,135
so Thompson won't be
able to get a fix on you.

1413
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:15,305
DAVID: Okay. Just south of
the diner, it's a red door.

1414
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:17,807
I come out on Broadway,
right by Leonard Street.

1415
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:19,726
That's good. Keep going.

1416
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:22,186
From Leonard, half a block down.

1417
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:23,896
Okay, suppose Thompson's there?

1418
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:26,357
Okay, I go east to Lafayette.

1419
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,192
No, it's Crosby Street there.

1420
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:30,278
Eight doors? I'm zigzagging
all over the place.

1421
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:31,446
That will take me too long.

1422
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,947
But every time you go through a door,

1423
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,742
their plan books will lose
track of you, so it's safer.

1424
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:39,245
HARRY: Look, I need you to understand
this has never been done before.

1425
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:42,790
So, the minute you go through that
first door, all hell will break loose.

1426
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:45,710
Assume everyone with
a hat on is a threat.

1427
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,170
I don't care if it's a Yankee cap,

1428
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:49,047
a bowler, or even a yarmulke.

1429
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,924
Assume everyone in a hat
is working with Thompson.

1430
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:54,761
Even you guys can't get through the
doors without your hats on, right?

1431
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:55,970
Right.

1432
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:58,431
It's one of the ways the
Chairman limits our power.

1433
01:22:58,515 --> 01:22:59,682
Water is another way.

1434
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:02,268
And you said before, what if Thompson's
in front of me on Crosby Street?

1435
01:23:02,353 --> 01:23:03,394
Right.

1436
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,355
Why don't I just knock
the hat off his head

1437
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:07,815
and then run by him before
he has time to pick it up?

1438
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,318
That's good, improvisation.
We have trouble with that.

1439
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:13,404
DAVID: The fastest way is actually
if I go right for the blue door.

1440
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,490
Yeah, but then you're
exposed the entire way there.

1441
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:17,742
That's a lot more dangerous
than leapfrogging through doors.

1442
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,827
But if I make it, I'll take
them completely by surprise.

1443
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:20,953
If you make it.

1444
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:28,961
Come on, we have a lot
more to get through.

1445
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:30,922
Whatever it takes.

1446
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:36,219
Your father used to say that.

1447
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:46,187
I guess you're not supposed
to identify with your subjects.

1448
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:47,772
You're not supposed to feel guilt.

1449
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:51,651
We're not built to lead with
our emotions like you are,

1450
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:55,196
but that doesn't mean
we don't have them.

1451
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,408
Some more than others.

1452
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:18,302
(RAIN PATTERING)

1453
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,474
You're lucky, it started raining again.

1454
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:25,518
We need to get going. The
wedding is in 10 minutes.

1455
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:28,855
We have time. Being early
is just as bad as being late.

1456
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:33,443
Is your fiancιe here?

1457
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:35,236
She's on her way in.

1458
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:38,322
Courtroom 300.

1459
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,328
You okay? Yeah.

1460
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:50,835
This is it. Okay.

1461
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:54,922
I'm going to go for the blue door.

1462
01:24:55,007 --> 01:24:56,174
Of course.

1463
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:01,095
Here is your way through
it. Don't lose it.

1464
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,390
Thanks, Harry.

1465
01:25:04,475 --> 01:25:06,184
Good luck.

1466
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,274
Okay.

1467
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:34,378
It looks like Mr. Norris is using
the rain to make a run for it.

1468
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:36,839
Call the proctor at the wedding.

1469
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:41,385
What's wrong? Nothing.
I'm just nervous, I guess.

1470
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:44,388
I just need a minute
in the bathroom, okay?

1471
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:08,162
Sir, he's got a hat.
He's in the substrate.

1472
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:09,956
He just went into the substrate.

1473
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:29,350
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

1474
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,352
It's an emergency. Sorry.

1475
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:34,188
Docket number 22, please come forward.

1476
01:26:34,273 --> 01:26:35,731
We're next. Will you go check on her?

1477
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:37,149
Yeah.

1478
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:45,741
You're David Norris! Yeah, I got to go.

1479
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:51,122
Nothing in the hat.

1480
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,290
SECURITY OFFICER: Go ahead.

1481
01:27:08,015 --> 01:27:09,640
She's not even in there.

1482
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:13,311
Where is she? Where is she?

1483
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:16,731
Elise.

1484
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:20,234
You're not marrying that guy.

1485
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:21,694
(PANTING)

1486
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:24,113
I'm so sorry,

1487
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:27,408
and I don't know what you must
think of me, but you can't marry him.

1488
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:29,702
You don't love him. I've
been terrible, I know.

1489
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:31,746
I'm getting married. No, you can't.

1490
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:34,081
Don't touch me! What are you doing?

1491
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:36,792
Do you know that no one has
ever hurt me as much as you did?

1492
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:38,586
I'm so sorry that I left
you the way that I did.

1493
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:41,339
David, you know what? You
left me in a fucking hospital.

1494
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:42,506
What are you doing?

1495
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:44,675
I know it seems terrible
but there was a reason.

1496
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,385
You don't know anything about me

1497
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,637
and what makes me happy.

1498
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:49,513
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

1499
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:52,683
Oh, my God.

1500
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:54,644
Don't worry about him, he's with them.

1501
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:56,604
Just listen to me. Oh,
my God, what did you do?

1502
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:58,522
Forget about him. What are you doing?

1503
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:02,610
Look at me, I know that you love me.

1504
01:28:06,073 --> 01:28:09,617
Okay, this says that you love me

1505
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:12,203
and that I love you and that
we're not supposed to be together.

1506
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:13,454
Because of this book.

1507
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:15,247
But I know that I'm
supposed to be with you

1508
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:16,499
because of the way I feel.

1509
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:18,376
I love you and I don't
care what happens.

1510
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:21,504
I want to spend the rest of my life with
you even if it's only a little while.

1511
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,091
He just revealed us.

1512
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:26,801
Call the Intervention Team.

1513
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:29,303
Tell them it's a square-one reset.

1514
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:38,312
Mr. Thompson has deployed
the Intervention Team.

1515
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:40,690
He's requesting an emergency
Reset Authorization.

1516
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:42,233
I'll carry it in.

1517
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:49,615
(PANTING)

1518
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:52,243
Why are they chasing you?

1519
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:56,330
They're going to reset me.

1520
01:28:56,415 --> 01:28:57,915
What are you talking about?

1521
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,584
I never lied to you.

1522
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:02,169
MAN: Down here.

1523
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,672
He's down here.

1524
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:06,632
I love you, Elise.

1525
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:10,511
I'm going to show you something.

1526
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,638
You deserve to know.

1527
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:14,473
What's going on?

1528
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:26,444
We got to keep moving.
There is another door here.

1529
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:58,642
Got them. Sixth Avenue.

1530
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:00,478
Contain this.

1531
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:04,857
Oh, my God. What's happening to me?

1532
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:07,068
All you need to know,
we're being chased.

1533
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:09,361
I need you to trust me.

1534
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:10,488
I need you to trust me.

1535
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,698
Okay. Okay, come on.

1536
01:30:23,794 --> 01:30:25,503
Door, door, door!

1537
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:29,507
Find another door!

1538
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:30,925
(GASPS)

1539
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,930
What the hell is going on?

1540
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:37,681
What the hell is going on, David?

1541
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:38,808
Okay, I'm sorry.

1542
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,101
How did we just do that?

1543
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:41,644
I'm so sorry.

1544
01:30:41,728 --> 01:30:44,063
These doors belong to the
people who are chasing us.

1545
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:46,232
Who are they? I don't
know what to call them,

1546
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:47,900
but they want to take you away from me.

1547
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:49,693
Why do they care about us?

1548
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:51,320
They hurt your ankle, Elise.

1549
01:30:51,404 --> 01:30:53,197
Everything you've worked
for your entire life,

1550
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,116
it doesn't happen if you stay with me.

1551
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,826
That's why I left you in the hospital.

1552
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:58,410
I don't understand.

1553
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:01,539
I don't understand.

1554
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:03,999
This can't be wrong.

1555
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,003
This can't be wrong.

1556
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:11,882
Why do they think it's wrong?

1557
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:14,301
The book... Their book.

1558
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:16,887
But what if I can find who wrote it?

1559
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:26,939
Okay, I can go through this door alone.

1560
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:29,441
You'll never see me or the
people chasing us again.

1561
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:36,407
Or you could come with me, and I
don't know what's on the other side,

1562
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:38,450
but I know you would be next to me,

1563
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:40,494
and that's all I've wanted
since the minute I met you.

I'm coming with you.

Okay.

1566
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:03,434
Take the other one.

1567
01:32:04,394 --> 01:32:05,978

Search the room!

1582
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:35,919
Shit!

1583
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:38,130
Go back.

Oh, my God.

1586
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,542
I love you. I love you.

1587
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:03,924
Did you really think you
could reach the Chairman?

1588
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,468
And change your fate if you did?

1589
01:36:06,553 --> 01:36:08,679
Or write your own?

1590
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:11,974
It doesn't work like
that and I told you why.

1591
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:17,229
I've got a message for you.

1592
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:28,157
I understand.

1593
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:40,043
Even Thompson has a boss.

1594
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:41,837
Harry?

1595
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:45,799
You're the Chairman?

1596
01:36:45,884 --> 01:36:47,301
(LAUGHS) No.

1597
01:36:48,011 --> 01:36:50,554
You've met him though, or her.

1598

Everybody has.

1599
01:36:53,016 --> 01:36:55,434
The Chairman comes in a
different form to everyone

1600
01:36:55,518 --> 01:36:58,061
so people rarely
realize when it happens.

1601
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:04,485
Is this some sort of test?

1602
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:06,737
In a way, it's all a test,

1603
01:37:07,614 --> 01:37:11,074
for everybody, even the members
of the Adjustment Bureau.

1604
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:15,078
David, you risked everything for Elise.

1605
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:18,540
And Elise, when you came through
that door at the Statue of Liberty,

1606
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:20,167
you risked everything, too.

1607
01:37:21,211 --> 01:37:22,711
But you inspired me.

1608
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:25,589
It seems like you
inspired the Chairman, too.

1609
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:30,177
Is that about us?

1610
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:31,720
Yes.

1611
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:34,681
What does it say?

1612
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:37,017
It says that this situation
between the two of you

1613
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:39,686
is a serious deviation from the plan.

1614
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:45,275
So, the Chairman rewrote it.

1615
01:37:53,493 --> 01:37:54,618
Okay.

1616
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:57,454
Now what?

1617
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:58,872
Now...

1618
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:04,169
You can take the stairs.

1619
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:20,477
HARRY: Most people live life
on the path we set for them.

1620
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,272
Too afraid to explore any other.

1621
01:38:24,983 --> 01:38:27,526
But once in a while,
people like you come along

1622
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:31,280
who knock down all the
obstacles we put in your way.

1623
01:38:31,781 --> 01:38:35,576
People who realize free will is a
gift you'll never know how to use

1624
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:37,536
until you fight for it.

1625
01:38:38,496 --> 01:38:41,123
I think that's the Chairman's real plan

1626
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:42,874
that maybe one day

1627
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,336
we won't write the plan.

1628
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:48,589
You will.

1629
01:38:55,171 --> 01:39:25,589
