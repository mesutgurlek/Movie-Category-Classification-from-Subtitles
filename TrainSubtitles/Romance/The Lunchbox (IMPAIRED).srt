804
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:44,672
It's my recipe, sir.

805
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:46,607
(IN ENGLISH)
I really don't want it.

806
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:48,446
You're not eating at all.

807
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:55,659
Sir, I wanted to ask you something.

808
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:57,655
(IN HINDI) Go ahead.

809
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:03,331
You asked just now
when we got married.

810
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:07,962
Actually,

811
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:10,040
her father said no.

812
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:15,037
He said: "The boy is an orphan,
short and dark-skinned."

813
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:23,682
So Meherunissa ran away from home.

814
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:32,162
But she doesn't want to get married
without her father's blessing.

815
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:35,890
I won't tell anyone.

816
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:37,695
No. It's not that.

817
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,331
Her father has agreed now.

818
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:43,572
We are getting married soon.

819
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:52,373
There'll be an army from
her side at the wedding.

820
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:55,714
Brothers and sisters,
their husbands, children,

will be there.

822
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:03,896
And there is no one from my side.

823
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:07,723
I'm alone.

824
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:11,096

you wouldn't mind,

01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:23,716
Yes, and if Madam
Ila can come too...

01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:40,866
(IN HINDI) Her father insists
on giving me a scooter.

833
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:42,998

834

make you my assistant.

839
