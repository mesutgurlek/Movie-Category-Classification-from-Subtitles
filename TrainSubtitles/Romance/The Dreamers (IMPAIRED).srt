1
00:01:47,284 --> 00:01:50,788
The first time I saw a movie
at the Cinematheque Francaise...

2
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:53,958
I thought, "Only the French...

3
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:57,670
Only the French would house
a cinema inside a palace. "

4
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:11,684
The movie was
Sam Fuller's Shock Corridor.

5
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:15,563
Its images were so powerful,
it was like being hypnotized.

6
00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:20,860
I was 20 years old.
It was the late '60s...

7
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:24,029
and I'd come to Paris
for a year to study French.

8
00:02:24,155 --> 00:02:26,157
But it was here
that I got my real education.

9
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:33,122
I became a member of what in those days
was kind of a free masonry..

10
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:35,332
A free masonry of cinephiles...

11
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,377
what we'd call "film buffs. "

12
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:45,011
I was one of the insatiables...

13
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:50,141
the ones you'd always find
sitting closest to the screen.

14
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:52,894
Why do we sit so close?

15
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:56,522
Maybe it was because we wanted
to receive the images first...

16
00:02:56,647 --> 00:02:59,317
when they were still new,
still fresh...

17
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,070
before they cleared the hurdles
of the rows behind us...

18
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:07,867
before they'd been relayed back
from row to row, spectator to spectator...

19
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,412
until worn-out, secondhand,
the size of a postage stamp...

20
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:13,539
it returned to the
projectionist's cabin.

21
00:03:13,623 --> 00:03:17,335
Doctor, I'm not nuts!
I'm here from the paper! I'm a plant!

22
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:20,338
Maybe, too, the screen
really was a screen.

23
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:23,758
It screened us...
from the world.

24
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:36,898
But there was one evening
in the spring of 1968...

25
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:40,235
when the world finally
burst through the screen.

26
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:42,904
The pawn of an obscure coalition...

27
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:44,531
of dubious interests...

28
00:03:44,614 --> 00:03:46,741
the Minister Malraux
has driven...

29
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:50,620
Henri Langlois out
of the French Cinematheque.

30
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:53,706
...if offered us all
a free and fair conception...

31
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,875
of French film culture.

32
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,587
Now, for bureaucratic reasons,
culture's arch-enemies...

33
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:02,215
have seized this bastion
of liberty.

34
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:05,218
Resist them!

35
00:04:05,301 --> 00:04:08,221
- Liberty isn't given!
- It's taken!

36
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:09,931
All those who love film...

37
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:11,558
- In France...
- And abroad.

38
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:12,767
...are with you.

39
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:16,104
And with Henry Langlois!

40
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:26,616
It was Henri Langlois,
who created the Cinematheque...

41
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,660
and it was because
he liked to show movies...

42
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:31,746
instead of letting them rot
in some underground vault...

43
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:34,791
to show any movies...
good, bad, old, new...

44
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,127
silents, Westerns, thrillers...

45
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:40,757
that all the New Wave filmmakers
came here to learn their craft..

46
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,969
This was where
modern cinema was born.

47
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,431
The police!

48
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:53,477
Langlois had been sacked
by the government...

49
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:58,023
and it seemed like every film buff
in Paris had turned out in protest.

50
00:04:58,148 --> 00:05:02,778
It was our very own
cultural revolution.

51
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:24,177
Excuse me.

52
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:29,182
Can you remove this?

53
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:32,143
It's stuck to my lips.

54
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:36,189
Can you remove my cigarette?
It's stuck.

55
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:38,399
Yes, yes...

56
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:39,984
of course.

57
00:05:41,694 --> 00:05:43,530
Sorry.

58
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:46,866
- What are you, English?
- No. I'm American.

59
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:49,869
You can put it out now.

60
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:55,084
- What's your name?
- Matthew.

61
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,503
You're here a lot, aren't you?
But you never talk to anyone.

62
00:05:57,587 --> 00:05:59,589
We've been wondering
why you're always alone.

63
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:02,717
I don't really know anybody.

64
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,886
How come you're
chained to the gates?

65
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:07,305
I'm not chained
to the gates.

66
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:14,228
- You're awfully clean.
- What?

67
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:16,856
For someone who likes
the cinema so much.

68
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,942
- Do you know Jacques?
- Jacques?

69
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:21,527
"If shit could shit,
it would smell just like Jacques. "

70
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:23,696
My brother's
gone to talk to him.

71
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,908
When he gets back, you'll be able
to smell Jacques on him.

72
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:29,619
It's like
being around pigs.

73
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:32,080
- You speak English really well.
- What?

74
00:06:32,164 --> 00:06:36,084
- You speak English really well.
- My mother's English.

75
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:40,255
- Here's Theo. When I introduce you, just give him a sniff.
- Come on.

76
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,924
Truffaut, Godard, Charbol, Rivette...

77
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:46,470
and Renoir,Jean Rouch,
Rohmerare here.

78
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:49,264
Signoret, Jean Marais
and God knows who else.

79
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:50,599
Marcel Carne too.

80
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:52,434
Why is Carne here?

81
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:55,771
What should we do?
Stay or leave?

82
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:58,231
I don't know.

83
00:06:58,315 --> 00:07:02,068
Theo, this is Matthew.

84
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:04,654
- You were right. He's American.
- Hi.

85
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:09,453
I've seen you around. You've been coming
to all the Nicholas Rays.

86
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:12,080
Yeah. I really like his movies.

87
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:15,751
- What? They Live By Night?
- Mm-mm. More like...

88
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:20,255
Johnny Guitar
and Rebel Without a Cause.

89
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,759
- You know what Godard wrote about him?
- No. What?

90
00:07:23,842 --> 00:07:25,928
"Nicholas Ray is cinema. "

91
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:29,014
- What's up with you?
- Me?

92
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:31,308
Come on, stick with me!

93
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,467
Fascists!

94
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:05,554
- Bastards!
- Assholes!

95
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:13,353
And that was how I first met
Theo and Isabelle.

96
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:21,905
I could hear my heart pounding.

97
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,325
I don't know if it was
because I'd just been chased by the police...

98
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:28,662
or because I was already
in love with my new friends.

99
00:08:28,745 --> 00:08:31,874
As we walked and talked
and talked and talked...

100
00:08:31,957 --> 00:08:34,585
about politics, about movies...

101
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,588
and why the French could never come
close to producing a good rock band...

102
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:40,716
- I'm starving.
- I forgot the sandwiches.

103
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,844
I didn't want that night
ever to end.

104
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:48,724
- Merci.
- Didn't you bring anything?

105
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:51,185
No. I'm okay.
Please eat.

106
00:08:51,268 --> 00:08:54,021
Don't mind me.

107
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:57,399
- No. I'm really not hungry.
- I've broken it now. Take it.

108
00:08:57,524 --> 00:09:00,736
- You're very kind, but I don't...
- For goodness sake, take it when you're offered it.

109
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:02,780
Thank you.

110
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:06,909
- Theo, don't you have something for Matthew?
- This is fine.

111
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:10,454
- I gave him a third of mine.
- Okay.

112
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:15,127
- Really, I didn't come here to eat your sandwiches.
- He doesn't want it.

113
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:18,714
Yes, he does! He's just too polite
to say he does.

114
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,258
- Aren't you, Matthew?
- You're very kind.

115
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:25,137
- So where are you from exactly?
- San Diego.

116
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:29,933
What about you two?
Were you both born in Paris?

117
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:34,605
I entered this world on
the Champs Elysees, 1959.

118
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,648
The pavement of the Champs-Elysees.

119
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:39,901
And you know what
my very first words were?

120
00:09:39,985 --> 00:09:41,987
No. What?

121
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,072
"New York Herald Tribune!"

122
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:46,950
New York Herald Tribune!

123
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:51,830
- New York Herald Tribune!
- New York Herald Tribune!

124
00:09:51,955 --> 00:09:55,667
Will you come to Rome with me?

125
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:00,173
Here! Right here! Here!

126
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:02,842
No, there!

127
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:05,345
- Good night, Matthew!
- Night.

128
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:55,230
"Dear Mom...

129
00:10:55,313 --> 00:11:00,193
"I've got some real news this time.

130
00:11:00,277 --> 00:11:03,822
I just met
my first French friends. "

131
00:11:43,574 --> 00:11:46,118
- Hello.
- Matthew?

132
00:11:46,243 --> 00:11:48,454
Who is this?

133
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:51,749
- Don't be suspicious. It's me.
- Theo?

134
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:54,752
- Don't tell me I woke you up.
- No, I...

135
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:58,088
- I've been up for ages.
- You don't sound as if you've been up for ages.

136
00:11:58,172 --> 00:12:00,758
I always sound like this
in the morning.

137
00:12:00,883 --> 00:12:03,636
Sorry. I had to call you early
because I go to class at 9:00.

138
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:09,892
- Right.
- Listen, you want to have dinner tomorrow night?

139
00:12:09,975 --> 00:12:15,314
Um, you mean like a real dinner
in a nice restaurant?

140
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:19,109
No, not in a restaurant.
Here at home.

141
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:22,404
Yeah, I'd...
Sure, that'd be great.

142
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:24,990
Yes? Okay, why don't you...

143
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:27,076
Theo, please get off the phone.
It's 9:00.

144
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:32,122
Yes, yes. Why don't you meet us
for a drink first at Le Raspail, 6:00?

145
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:34,249
You know where it is?

146
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,127
- Boulevard Saint-Germain?
- Be there are 6:00.

147
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,970
Hey!

148
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:46,806
Third floor!

149
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:49,266
You know, there's room
in here for all of us.

150
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,853
Theo and I are contagious!
- What?

151
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:55,731
- We're very contagious!
- Contagious?

152
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:57,692
You mustn't catch us.

153
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,713
- It's beautiful.
- You think so?

154
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:20,256
Good luck.

155
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:29,641
Evening, Mama.

156
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,562
What are you doing here?

157
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,856
- We're here for dinner.
- What?

158
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:37,733
With Matthew.

159
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,402
- Didn't Isabelle say?
- Which Matthew?

160
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:42,571
This Matthew.

161
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,991
He's our new friend.
Matthew, this is my mother.

162
00:13:46,074 --> 00:13:48,076
- Hi.
- Very pleased to meet you, Matthew.

163
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,705
- Likewise.
- Oh, you're American, are you?

164
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:54,041
- Yeah. I'm from California.
- Oh.

165
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,710
Matthew lives in that nasty student
Hotel Malebranche...

166
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,588
- so we invited him to dinner.
- Oh.

167
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,256
What's wrong?

168
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:04,676
What can I say, Isabelle?
I'm cooking for two...

169
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,345
and now there are
five of us.

170
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,554
Didn't Theo
tell you?

171
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,390
No, he didn't.
And neither did you.

172
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,644
Have you got mashed potatoes
for brains or what?

173
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:14,462
You were supposed
to tell her!

174
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:15,772
You're crazy!

175
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:17,842
Bitch, cow, slut...

176
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:21,092
Oh, for God's sake!
Put a sock in it, you two!

177
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:25,983
I must apologize for
my children's behavior, Matthew.

178
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:28,520
No. I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

179
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:32,106
Please don't put yourself out
on account of me.

180
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:34,775
That's very sweet of you,
seeing as you're completely blameless.

181
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,956
Let me look at you.

182
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:44,077
Okay. I want you to make
a good impression on Papa.

183
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:56,464
Papa, it's me.

184
00:14:56,548 --> 00:14:58,049
We're eating in.

185
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:00,510
And the cinematheque?

186
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:02,846
Closed until further
notice.

187
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:05,473
Papa, can't you see we have a guest?

188
00:15:05,557 --> 00:15:08,810
- This is Matthew.
- Oh.

189
00:15:09,228 --> 00:15:11,230
- Sir.
- Matthew.

190
00:15:11,314 --> 00:15:14,233
Matthew's dining
with us tonight.

191
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:18,738
My young Matthew,
inspiration is like a baby.

192
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:22,825
It does not choose a nice,
seemly hour to enter the world.

193
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:27,371
It has no consideration
for the poor poets. I know.

194
00:15:28,248 --> 00:15:30,542
But when it does come...

195
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:34,713
when it deigns to come,
then you know it's...

196
00:15:39,926 --> 00:15:44,764
Young man, I was speaking to you.
I imagine you were listening.

197
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:47,267
I was.
I'm... I'm sorry.

198
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:51,396
What?

199
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:54,441
Nothing.
I was just, um...

200
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:57,779
You seemed to be mesmerized
by this tin lighter.

201
00:15:57,904 --> 00:16:00,031
I'd like to know why.

202
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:03,868
- Well?
- George, please.

203
00:16:03,993 --> 00:16:07,455
- Matthew's our guest.
- No, no. I'm genuinely curious.

204
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,375
I'd like to know why.

205
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:16,047
I was just... I was fidgeting
with Isabelle's lighter...

206
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,132
and... I wasn't
really realizing it...

207
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:20,260
then I noticed,
and I thought it was rude...

208
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:22,303
so I put it down
on the table.

209
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:24,456
But I put it diagonally across
one of these squares.

210
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,142
Do you see?

211
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:29,269
Look.

212
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:32,064
That's when I noticed
that the lighter's length...

213
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:35,150
is exactly the same length
as the diagonal itself.

214
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:39,988
So I put it lengthwise,
along the outside edge.

215
00:16:40,113 --> 00:16:43,909
- Look. It fits there too.
- Yeah.

216
00:16:43,992 --> 00:16:46,620
But it fits there.

217
00:16:47,913 --> 00:16:51,250
And it fits like this
and like this...

218
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,628
and this way too.

219
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:57,965
And I bet you if
I just split it in half...

220
00:16:58,048 --> 00:17:01,927
you know, it's
got to fit somewhere.

221
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:04,430
I mean, it really
fits anywhere. Look.

222
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,600
See?

223
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:10,187
I was noticing that the more
you look at everything...

224
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:15,108
this table, the objects on it,
the refrigerator, this room...

225
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:18,320
your nose, the world...

226
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:19,489
suddenly...

227
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,869
you realize that there's some
sort of cosmic harmony...

228
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:28,707
of shapes and sizes.

229
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:32,794
I was just wondering why.
I don't know why that is.

230
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:35,464
I know that it is.

231
00:17:42,971 --> 00:17:45,641
You have an interesting
friend here.

232
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:49,019
More interesting, I suspect,
than you know.

233
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:56,193
I mean, when we look around us,
what is it we see?

234
00:17:56,276 --> 00:18:01,031
Complete chaos.

235
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:03,367
Yet viewed from above...

236
00:18:03,492 --> 00:18:06,703
viewed, as it were,
by God...

237
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:09,623
everything suddenly
fits together.

238
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:15,880
My children believe that
their demonstrations and sit-ins...

239
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:18,424
and happenings...

240
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:21,045
what, they believe that these possess
the capacity...

241
00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:25,008
not only to provoke society,
but also to transform it.

242
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:33,434
What is it you're saying? If Langlois
is dismissed, we shouldn't do anything?

243
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:39,315
If immigrants are deported, if students
are beaten up, we shouldn't do anything?

244
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,651
What I'm saying is that
a little lucidity would not go amiss.

245
00:18:42,777 --> 00:18:47,114
So, uh,
everyone's wrong but you?

246
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:49,825
In France, in Italy,
Germany, America?

247
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,286
Listen to me, Theo.
Before you can change the world...

248
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:55,456
you must realize
you yourself are part of it.

249
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:59,293
You cannot stand outside
looking in.

250
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:02,338
You're the one
who stands outside.

251
00:19:02,463 --> 00:19:05,633
You're the one who refused to sign
a petition against the Vietnam War.

252
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:08,928
Poets don't sign petitions.
They sign poems.

253
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:12,139
A petition is a poem.

254
00:19:12,223 --> 00:19:16,185
Yes! And a poem is a petition.
Thank you, but I'm not gaga yet.

255
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,270
I don't need you to remind me
of my own work!

256
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:21,649
- Hmm?
- That's right.

257
00:19:21,774 --> 00:19:24,777
A petition is a poem,
a poem is a petition.

258
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,907
- Yes.
- Those are the most famous lines you ever wrote.

259
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,669
And now look at you.

260
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:36,298
I hope I'll never be like him.

261
00:19:36,381 --> 00:19:37,734
Theo.

262
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,136
We should say goodnight, darling.

263
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,763
We got a long day
ahead of us tomorrow.

264
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:45,099
George.

265
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:47,477
Yes, sorry. You were saying?

266
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,103
We should go to bed.

267
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:54,484
You had something
to tell the children, didn't you?

268
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:56,945
Yes, of course.

269
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:58,530
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:00,823
The cheques
are on the mantelpiece.

271
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:03,493
Don't cash them
until you need them, all right?

272
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,581
Good night, everybody.

273
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:11,668
Good night, Papa. Have a safe journey.

274
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:15,797
Good night, dear.
Theo.

275
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,882
A very good night to you, Matthew.

276
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,885
It was a pleasure meeting you, sir.
A pleasure.

277
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,305
- Very nice meeting you, Matthew.
- You too.

278
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,391
- Thank you so much for dinner.
- It's my pleasure.

279
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,518
Why don't you invite Matthew
to spend the night?

280
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,938
I'm not sure I like the sound
of Hotel Malebranche.

281
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,356
Good night.

282
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:03,388
Why haven't you dazzled us with these
philosophical speculations of yours?

283
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:07,726
- I didn't know I was being philosophical.
- Papa was awfully impressed.

284
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:12,022
- Papa's full of shit.
- I think you're lucky.

285
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,900
I... I wish my parents
were that nice.

286
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:18,112
Other people's parents
are always nicer than our own.

287
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:20,698
And yet for some reason,
our own grandparents...

288
00:21:20,823 --> 00:21:23,534
are always nicer
than other people's.

289
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:27,080
You know, that's true.
That's... That's absolutely true.

290
00:21:27,164 --> 00:21:31,376
I never thought about it before,
but it's... it's true.

291
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,170
Matthew, you sweet...

292
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:36,882
This...

293
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:40,010
is double the length of...

294
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:44,806
Well, I'm for bed.

295
00:21:56,486 --> 00:21:59,280
Are you staying?

296
00:21:59,364 --> 00:22:03,493
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

297
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:06,496
Good night, Matthew.

298
00:22:15,422 --> 00:22:17,842
Everybody's got a father.

299
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:19,927
Yes.

300
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:22,930
But the fact that
God doesn't exist...

301
00:22:23,013 --> 00:22:26,350
doesn't mean
he can take his place.

302
00:23:09,561 --> 00:23:12,022
Okay?

303
00:23:12,105 --> 00:23:13,549
That's fine.

304
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:15,818
- Good night.
- Good night.

305
00:23:15,902 --> 00:23:18,196
- See you in the morning.
- See you.

306
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:20,323
Thank...

307
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:22,408
Thank you.

308
00:23:39,258 --> 00:23:40,426
No!

309
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:28,727
Good morning.

310
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,232
What was that all about?

311
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,568
I was removing the sleep
from your eyes.

312
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:39,697
Theo lets me do his
every morning.

313
00:26:39,822 --> 00:26:41,949
That's the strangest thing
to want to do.

314
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:45,078
Didn't you enjoy it?

315
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:48,498
- Was I supposed to?
- Naturally.

316
00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:56,132
Up, up, up, up, up!
What are you waiting for?

317
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:59,677
Isabelle,
I'm not dressed.

318
00:27:57,903 --> 00:28:00,990
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

319
00:28:01,115 --> 00:28:06,037
I've been memorizing this room.

320
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:08,664
In the future, in my memory...

321
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:10,793
I shall live a great deal in this room.

322
00:28:11,477 --> 00:28:12,479
Queen Christina...

323
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:15,564
where Greta Garbo
bids farewell to the room...

324
00:28:15,648 --> 00:28:17,650
where she spent the night
with John Gilbert.

325
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:20,152
Bravo!

326
00:28:20,277 --> 00:28:22,321
Alors.
We have a private wing to ourselves.

327
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:24,406
The bathroom's
at the end of the corridor.

328
00:28:24,531 --> 00:28:27,660
If you aren't there in one minute,
we're coming back to get you!

329
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:01,694
Come in.

330
00:29:03,071 --> 00:29:05,156
Good morning.

331
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:13,624
Oh, sorry. You want to use
my toothbrush?

332
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,710
- Uh, no.
- Sure?

333
00:29:15,793 --> 00:29:18,504
I'll use my finger.

334
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:26,054
- Sleep well?
- Yeah.

335
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:28,557
- I mean, fine.
- Good.

336
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:40,319
- You know, Matthew?
- Hmm.

337
00:29:40,444 --> 00:29:44,157
You really do have the most
beautiful pair of lips.

338
00:29:46,366 --> 00:29:48,503
Can I touch them?

339
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:52,373
- You... You wanna touch my lips?
- Uh-huh.

340
00:29:52,498 --> 00:29:56,252
Okay.

341
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:05,053
So red... and ripe
and luscious.

342
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,140
So sullen, brutal.

343
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:10,101
Let's see what you
look like with lipstick.

344
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:13,605
- I really should be going.
- You'd make such a pretty girl.

345
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,691
Ignore her, Matthew.
She sucks in all the air around her.

346
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:21,404
No, I... I really have to, um,
be getting back to my hotel.

347
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:24,032
No. Why? You have been
invited to stay.

348
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:27,118
- Really?
- Sure.

349
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:29,287
You know our parents
have left..

350
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:31,748
They're going to be
in Trouves for a month.

351
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:34,542
We thought you might like
to move your things here.

352
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:36,920
- R-Really?
- Sure.

353
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:40,715
But you just met me two days ago.
You barely even know me.

354
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,593
This way we get to know you. You
don't have to stay in a hotel, do you?

355
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:46,096
- No.
- Then we'll go and pick up what you need...

356
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:48,223
with my Mobilette, okay?

357
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:52,102
- Come on.
- But... what about you?

358
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,932
It was my idea.

359
00:30:56,057 --> 00:30:59,018
Whoa! You're scaring me right now!

360
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:04,566
Jesus.

361
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,089
I'm going to check out
the Cinematheque, just in case.

362
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:11,616
- Okay.
- Don't take too long.

363
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,528
Don't worry, I won't.
I don't have much stuff.

364
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:16,997
With us, you're not
going to need much.

365
00:31:17,122 --> 00:31:19,082
Okay.

366
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:26,756
Oh, just don't forget
your toothbrush!

367
00:31:27,924 --> 00:31:29,884
Okay.

368
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:40,187
"Dear Mom, I guess you're surprised
to be hearing from me...

369
00:31:40,313 --> 00:31:42,315
"so soon after my last letter.

370
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:44,692
"But I've just moved out of my hotel
and into an apartment...

371
00:31:44,817 --> 00:31:47,320
"belonging to a famous
French author...

372
00:31:47,403 --> 00:31:50,698
"whose children are the same age as me
and have the same interests.

373
00:31:50,823 --> 00:31:55,369
"I know how pleased you'll be to hear I'm
getting in with the right kind of people.

374
00:31:55,494 --> 00:31:58,164
Sayhello to Father.
I hope he's not still mad at me. "

375
00:31:58,247 --> 00:32:00,207
Listen to this, Matthew.

376
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:02,869
"The difference between
Keaton and Chaplin...

377
00:32:03,252 --> 00:32:05,813
"is the difference
between prose and poetry...

378
00:32:06,297 --> 00:32:08,616
"between the aristocrat
and the tramp...

379
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,118
"between eccentricity
and mysticism...

380
00:32:11,344 --> 00:32:13,830
between man as a machine
and man as animal. "

381
00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:15,682
Not bad, huh?

382
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:19,853
That's good. Except for me,
there's no comparison.

383
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:23,857
Why? 'Cause Chaplin's
incomparable?

384
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:28,712
No. Because Keaton
is incomparable.

385
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:31,408
Keaton? You think Keaton's
greater than Chaplin?

386
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,035
- Absolutely I do.
- Oh, you're not serious.

387
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,371
- Of course I am.
- You're crazy.

388
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:40,250
Come on. In the first place, you can't
deny that Keaton's funnier than Chaplin.

389
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,547
- Yes, I can.
- You don't think that Keaton is funnier than Chaplin?

390
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,816
- I don't think anyone's funnier than Chaplin.
- Keaton is!

391
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,903
Even when he's not doing anything,
he's funny. And he looks like Godard.

392
00:32:49,986 --> 00:32:53,907
Keaton is a real filmmaker. Chaplin, all
he cares about is his own performance...

393
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:56,659
- his own ego.
- That's bullshit.

394
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:59,496
- It's not bullshit.
- Yes, it is.

395
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:02,332
You Americans understand fuck-all
about your own culture.

396
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:07,012
- No wonder you never got the point of Jerry Lewis.
- Don't even get me started!

397
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:11,382
Listen, when Chaplin wanted
to have a beautiful shot, he knew how.

398
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:14,719
Better than Keaton,
better than anybody.

399
00:33:14,803 --> 00:33:16,721
You remember the last shot
of City Lights?

400
00:33:16,805 --> 00:33:21,059
He looks at the flower girl,
she looks at him...

401
00:33:21,184 --> 00:33:23,394
and don't forget,
she'd been blind...

402
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:26,439
so she was seeing him
for the very first time.

403
00:33:26,564 --> 00:33:30,235
It's as if, through her eyes,
we also see him for the very first time.

404
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,947
Charlie Chaplin, Charlot,
the most famous man in the world...

405
00:33:34,072 --> 00:33:37,867
and it's as if we've never
really seen him before.

406
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:46,619
Isa, if you play that fucking record again,
I'll break it in two, okay?

407
00:33:46,744 --> 00:33:48,688
But you like
Janis Joplin.

408
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,851
Stop it!

409
00:33:52,976 --> 00:33:55,895
I said stop it, Isabelle!

410
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:57,897
Stop!

411
00:33:58,022 --> 00:34:00,108
- Tell me, what film?
- Wha-What?

412
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:02,193
Name a film...
Let go!

413
00:34:02,318 --> 00:34:04,779
Name a film where someone
tap dancing drives someone else crazy!

414
00:34:04,904 --> 00:34:08,616
- Oh, I know this!
- Come on! Quick! Quick!

415
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:13,955
Top Hat! Top Hat! Fred Astaire's
dancing over Ginger Rogers's room.

416
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:19,711
And she's mad
because he wakes her up.

417
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:26,594
I'm right.

418
00:34:27,678 --> 00:34:29,221
He's good.

419
00:34:29,305 --> 00:34:31,932
You know what I'm thinking?

420
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:33,434
What?

421
00:34:33,517 --> 00:34:35,061
"Bande a part. "

422
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:36,604
You're right.

423
00:34:36,729 --> 00:34:40,441
Why are you two
looking at me like that?

424
00:34:40,524 --> 00:34:43,871
Well, you see,
my little Matthew...

425
00:34:45,154 --> 00:34:48,407
there's something Theo and I have
been meaning to do for a long time...

426
00:34:48,491 --> 00:34:50,727
but we've been waiting
for the right person to do it with.

427
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,822
- And I think you're finally it!
- To do what?

428
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:54,924
Try to be the record
of Bande a part.

429
00:34:55,007 --> 00:34:57,301
- What record?
- You've seen Bande a part, haven't you?

430
00:34:57,426 --> 00:35:00,304
- Yeah. - Remember the scene
where the three race through the Louvre?

431
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:03,557
- Uh, vaguely. Remind me.
- They try to beat the world record...

432
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:06,644
- of 9 minutes and 45 seconds.
- Oh, yeah! Of course.

433
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:08,270
We're going to beat
their record.

434
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,732
Uh, oh.

435
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:14,777
- What?
- What's the matter?

436
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,905
- Nothing, really, I'm...
- Not afraid, are you?

437
00:35:17,988 --> 00:35:21,617
- No. I'm not afraid.
- What, then?

438
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:25,454
It's easy for you two. I'm an American,
what you French call an alien.

439
00:35:25,538 --> 00:35:28,290
- So?
- So if I get caught, I get deported.

440
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:32,169
Well, don't worry, little man,
we're not going to get caught.

441
00:35:32,294 --> 00:35:34,755
- Yeah, you don't know that.
- They weren't caught in Bande a part.

442
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,100
- And if we beat their record...
- It's a movie!

443
00:35:37,184 --> 00:35:39,813
- Go get Papa's stopwatch.
- It's a great idea, but...

444
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,441
Matthew, this is a test.

445
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:47,069
Are you going to pass it
or fail it?

446
00:35:47,194 --> 00:35:51,741
Be careful. A lot depends
on how you answer.

447
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,003
He! Non! Arretez!

448
00:36:23,566 --> 00:36:25,818
Nine minutes
and 28 seconds.

449
00:36:25,943 --> 00:36:28,445
We beat the record
by 17 seconds!

450
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:33,659
Matthew!
My little Matthew!

451
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:35,786
You were wonderful!

452
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:42,626
- We accept him. One of us!
- One of us!

453
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,795
We accept him, one of us!

454
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:47,173
We accept him, one of us!

455
00:36:47,298 --> 00:36:49,175
We accept her,
we accept her.

456
00:36:49,258 --> 00:36:53,304
Gooble, gobble.
Gooble, gobble.

457
00:36:53,387 --> 00:36:56,307
- We accept him, one of us!
- One of us!

458
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,200
Hey!

459
00:37:13,283 --> 00:37:16,078
Theo. Isabelle.

460
00:37:17,913 --> 00:37:19,206
Theo.

461
00:37:27,508 --> 00:37:29,302
Hey!

462
00:37:39,645 --> 00:37:43,232
- We accept you, one of us!
One of us! One of us!

463
00:37:43,316 --> 00:37:45,276
One of us! One of us!

464
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:51,908
That's Mama.

465
00:37:53,535 --> 00:37:55,912
I'm too wet to answer.

466
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:03,712
Isa's smart, but she doesn't
know how to deal with parents.

467
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:07,924
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it's not enough to ignore them.

468
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,969
They should all be arrested...

469
00:38:11,094 --> 00:38:15,390
put on trial,
confess their crimes...

470
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:19,061
sent to the country
for self-criticism...

471
00:38:19,144 --> 00:38:22,147
and reeducation!

472
00:38:22,272 --> 00:38:26,693
- They're already in the country.
- They are at the seaside.

473
00:38:26,818 --> 00:38:28,487
That's different.

474
00:38:29,571 --> 00:38:33,033
Allo. Allo?

475
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,786
Too bad.

476
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:37,055
My parents never go anywhere.

477
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,050
At least you have
the house to yourselves.

478
00:38:42,377 --> 00:38:44,337
Where are you going?

479
00:38:44,462 --> 00:38:47,632
Uh, I gotta get
out of these clothes.

480
00:38:47,757 --> 00:38:50,844
It'll be cold in your room.
Come into mine.

481
00:38:51,888 --> 00:38:54,390
Okay.

482
00:39:17,164 --> 00:39:19,124
You can wear this.

483
00:39:21,084 --> 00:39:23,504
Thanks.

484
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,900
I'm going to get a Coca.
You want one?

485
00:39:44,025 --> 00:39:45,985
Okay.

486
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:34,402
- Matthew!
- Yeah!

487
00:40:34,485 --> 00:40:37,731
- Just open the door. My hands are full.
- Just a second.

488
00:40:41,076 --> 00:40:43,286
- Why didn't you open the door?
- I was...

489
00:40:43,411 --> 00:40:45,830
I was dressing.

490
00:41:02,098 --> 00:41:04,058
What film?

491
00:41:10,932 --> 00:41:13,976
In what film does a chorus line
dance like this...

492
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,088
with a singer
in a fur coat?

493
00:41:17,272 --> 00:41:19,925
- I've seen this film?
- We saw it together.

494
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,153
- We did? Give me a clue.
- Certainly not.

495
00:41:23,236 --> 00:41:25,947
- Come on. Be a sport. Director's name.
- No.

496
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:29,659
Number of words in the title.

497
00:41:29,784 --> 00:41:31,745
- I said no. Non!
- Isabelle!

498
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:36,833
- The first letter of the first word.
- God! You're pathetic.

499
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:40,003
Isn't he pathetic, Matthew?
Don't you think he's pathetic?

500
00:41:40,086 --> 00:41:42,981
- Matthew, I bet you know.
- Don't you dare help him.

501
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,852
Did the Sphinx
give Oedipus a clue?

502
00:41:46,177 --> 00:41:49,389
Fuck you.

503
00:41:49,472 --> 00:41:51,433
Give up?

504
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:54,769
Yeah.

505
00:42:03,611 --> 00:42:06,933
- Blonde Venus. Marlene Dietrich. 1932.

506
00:42:07,616 --> 00:42:10,077
I knew that.

507
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:14,623
- Forfeit.
- If you insist.

508
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:16,709
I dare you to do now...

509
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,794
in front of us...

510
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:22,548
what I've watched you do...
in front of her.

511
00:42:22,631 --> 00:42:24,091
Who?

512
00:42:24,216 --> 00:42:26,260
I don't know
what you're talking about.

513
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:28,429
Oh, yes, you do, my pet.

514
00:42:28,554 --> 00:42:31,432
Forfeit.

515
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,793
What a bitch you are.

516
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:36,345
A bitch and a sadist.

517
00:42:36,371 --> 00:42:39,457
Are you going to pay
the forfeit or not?

518
00:42:44,705 --> 00:42:46,465
Very well.

519
00:42:54,507 --> 00:42:57,218
Mm-mm-mm. I want you to do it
the way you did it...

520
00:42:57,301 --> 00:42:59,303
when you thought
no one was watching.

521
00:44:42,536 --> 00:44:46,499
Let's have a drink.
I'll meet you downstairs.

522
00:44:46,582 --> 00:44:49,293
- Matthew.
- Yes?

523
00:44:53,923 --> 00:44:55,925
Yes.

524
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,411
Why don't you admit
you were thrilled?

525
00:45:21,494 --> 00:45:23,579
Come on.
You can tell me.

526
00:45:23,705 --> 00:45:26,207
What?

527
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,334
Weren't you just
a tiny bit excited?

528
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:33,256
- What is it exactly you're trying to get me to say?
- I asked you a question.

529
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:35,341
Well, I suppose you know
who you sound like.

530
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,427
- Who?
- Isabelle.

531
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,554
Why not?
She's my twin sister.

532
00:45:39,637 --> 00:45:41,723
- You two are twins?
- Yes.

533
00:45:41,848 --> 00:45:43,891
She'd be me
if she were a man.

534
00:45:44,017 --> 00:45:46,519
- That's crap. You're not identical.
- Yes, we are.

535
00:45:46,644 --> 00:45:50,815
We're Siamese twins,
joined here.

536
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,611
You're a strange one, Theo.

537
00:45:55,737 --> 00:46:00,616
Half an hour ago, I saw you look at her
as though you wanted to strangle her.

538
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,702
I did.

539
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:04,055
I don't understand you.

540
00:46:04,538 --> 00:46:07,583
- Don't you have any brothers or sisters?
- I have two older sisters.

541
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:10,294
Didn't you ever
want to strangle them?

542
00:46:10,377 --> 00:46:14,431
Of course I did! But I never masturbated
in front of them, and I never...

543
00:46:14,515 --> 00:46:17,977
They never forced me to do
anything I never wanted to do.

544
00:46:19,062 --> 00:46:21,022
You think Isabelle
forced me, do you?

545
00:46:32,276 --> 00:46:35,746
Deep down I knew things
couldn't go on as before.

546
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,657
Now the stakes had been raised.

547
00:46:38,741 --> 00:46:43,829
But for a while, at least, there did seem to
be a kind of truce between Theo and Isabelle.

548
00:46:43,954 --> 00:46:47,666
And then one evening...

549
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:50,628
Theo!

550
00:47:02,932 --> 00:47:05,768
- What film?
- "What film?"

551
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:10,940
Name a film where a cross marks the
spot of a murder, or pay the forfeit.

552
00:47:13,401 --> 00:47:16,779
- You too, Matthew.
- Me?

553
00:47:16,904 --> 00:47:18,983
What... What have I done?

554
00:47:19,108 --> 00:47:22,403
Name a film
or pay the forfeit.

555
00:47:22,486 --> 00:47:26,032
- Uh, um...
- Time's up.

556
00:47:26,157 --> 00:47:30,494
- Time's up? You didn't even give me a chance.
- The film?

557
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,299
Scarface.
Howard Hawks, 1932.

558
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:37,519
And the forfeit?

559
00:47:38,044 --> 00:47:41,297
Well, now...

560
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:45,961
as you know, Isabelle,
I'm not a sadist.

561
00:47:46,086 --> 00:47:50,132
I just want to see everyone happy,
no one left out.

562
00:47:50,257 --> 00:47:53,468
So I'd like you...

563
00:47:54,511 --> 00:47:56,639
and Matthew...

564
00:47:56,764 --> 00:47:59,224
to make love
in front of me.

565
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,477
But not in here.

566
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,647
I don't fancy sleeping in someone
else's revolting sweat.

567
00:48:04,772 --> 00:48:07,775
- No offense, Matthew.
- Where?

568
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:10,152
In the spare room...

569
00:48:10,277 --> 00:48:12,821
in front of
the Delacroix.

570
00:48:12,947 --> 00:48:15,958
Maybe one reproduction
will inspire another.

571
00:48:16,042 --> 00:48:18,094
- Um, um...
- I won't do it.

572
00:48:18,177 --> 00:48:20,246
- Won't do it?
- You wouldn't.

573
00:48:20,271 --> 00:48:22,231
Matthew
isn't my type.

574
00:48:30,316 --> 00:48:32,276
Okay.

575
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:30,503
I gotta go to the bathroom.

576
00:49:36,926 --> 00:49:39,679
Matthew! Matthew.

577
00:50:16,927 --> 00:50:19,721
Matthew.

578
00:50:19,805 --> 00:50:21,807
Matthew.

579
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:23,892
Yes?

580
00:50:23,976 --> 00:50:27,062
This is silly.
Come out of there.

581
00:50:33,444 --> 00:50:36,238
Okay.

582
00:50:38,783 --> 00:50:41,702
Okay. All right.

583
00:50:41,786 --> 00:50:44,705
Look. Wait. Look.
You're hurting me!

584
00:50:44,789 --> 00:50:48,376
I'm not violent. I'm...
I'm against violence.

585
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:52,755
- I'm not gonna resist. Look.
- So shut up. Okay?

586
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,359
- Okay.
- Now, Matthew, you aren't being very gallant.

587
00:50:57,586 --> 00:51:00,839
Is the prospect of making love to me
so hateful?

588
00:51:03,341 --> 00:51:06,303
I've seen you.
I saw you in bed together.

589
00:51:06,428 --> 00:51:09,931
Oh. Our guest
has been spying on us.

590
00:51:10,056 --> 00:51:13,810
Hmm. Now, that wasn't
a friendly thing to do, Matthew.

591
00:51:13,894 --> 00:51:17,856
Especially when we've
been so hospitable.

592
00:51:19,058 --> 00:51:21,018
Okay, okay. Look...

593
00:51:21,102 --> 00:51:23,687
- Shh, shh.
- I'm not resisting! I'm not resisting!

594
00:51:38,828 --> 00:51:41,057
Oh, how sweet
of you, Matthew...

595
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,267
to keep my image
next to your heart.

596
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:45,436
I didn't mean...

597
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:48,564
Good.

598
00:51:50,558 --> 00:51:56,773
Oh, Matthew. Oh, come on.
Oh, wake up. Oh.

599
00:51:56,856 --> 00:51:59,651
Come on, wake up.

600
00:51:59,734 --> 00:52:01,694
Isabelle?

601
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:04,197
No. I'm Theo.

602
00:52:04,322 --> 00:52:07,200
Where is Isabelle?

603
00:52:50,952 --> 00:52:53,913
You have to help me.

604
00:53:13,892 --> 00:53:16,311
Sorry.

605
00:56:55,075 --> 00:56:57,369
Oh, that was the best one.

606
00:56:59,413 --> 00:57:01,832
What about yesterday?

607
00:57:01,915 --> 00:57:05,502
- Where?
- In Papa's study.

608
00:57:05,586 --> 00:57:08,297
You thought
that was better?

609
00:57:08,422 --> 00:57:11,433
Mm-hmm. Please, please,
please, please.

610
00:57:11,758 --> 00:57:13,769
- What?
- Stay inside.

611
00:57:16,097 --> 00:57:18,224
Matthew.

612
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:20,593
My love.

613
00:57:21,018 --> 00:57:23,529
My first love.

614
00:57:23,854 --> 00:57:27,526
My great love.
My great lover.

615
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,822
My Valentino.

616
00:57:32,905 --> 00:57:37,910
- ## [ Sings ]
- [ Laughs ]

617
00:57:38,035 --> 00:57:40,830
##[ "Man Singing In French,"
Indistinct ]

618
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:06,690
"You" k"now, I thought"
you had many lovers.

619
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,780
When I first saw you
at the Cinémathéque--

620
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:15,742
you and Theo--
you looked so cool.

621
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,205
So sophisticated.

622
00:58:21,149 --> 00:58:25,069
- Like a movie star.
- I was.

623
00:58:25,153 --> 00:58:27,405
