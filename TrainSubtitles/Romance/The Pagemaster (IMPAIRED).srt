1
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,099
(roars)

2
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,442
(gasps)

3
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:36,156
(gasping)

4
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,661
(woman) Alan, every
ten-year-old is afraid
of something.

5
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,164
(Alan) The kid's afraid
of tuna-fish sandwiches.

6
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,166
Mercury levels
in the tuna.

7
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,168
Whatever.

8
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,671
Alan, the world is
a frightening place
to him right now.

9
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,673
I think we could be
a little more supportive.

10
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,676
Supportive? I'm the most
supportive father on earth,

11
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,678
but I'm running out of
supportive things to do.

12
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,681
I signed him up
for Little League,
he drove everybody crazy

13
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,685
with statistics about how you
can develop tumors from being
hit in the head with a ball.

14
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,190
Did you know that shin splints
can lead to blood clots
in the legs?

15
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,694
Claire, he brought in
a medical journal. Nobody
wanted to play after that.

16
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:19,065
And now I'm building him
a tree house, in a tree
he refuses to climb.

17
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:22,202
You know he hates heights.

18
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:27,207
I don't know. I just
want to be a good father.

19
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,709
But you are
a good father.

20
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,632
(thunder rumbles)

21
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,218
(gasps) I'm OK! I'm OK!

22
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,337
(thunder crashes)

23
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:43,723
Aah! No, I'm not!

24
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,734
Hey, Rich!

25
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,237
(laughs) Well?

26
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,688
You like it?

27
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,240
Uh, yeah, it's great, Dad.

28
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,743
Hey, how about bringing
me up that bag of nails?

29
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,247
No, come on up!

30
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,699
Look. Solid as a rock.

31
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,753
Dad, 8% of all household
accidents involve ladders.

32
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,706
Another 3% involve trees.

33
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,259
We're looking at
11% probability here.

34
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,263
Fine. Just put the bag
in the bucket, OK?

35
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,270
(resumes hammering)

36
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,277
Rich.
Huh?

37
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,647
Ow! (yells)

38
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,282
Oh! Oh!

39
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,784
Dad! Do you have feeling
in your toes?

40
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,786
Yes, I have feeling
in my toes.

41
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,288
Oh, Alan, honey,
are you OK?

42
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,789
Yeah, I'm fine.

43
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,292
Fine. Oh!

44
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,294
Can't argue with
statistics, Dad.

45
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,797
Statistics. Here's
something you can do:

46
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,301
go down to
Gutman's Hardware Store,
buy a pound of these.

47
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,302
But, Dad --

48
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,305
Son, you can't
live your life
based on statistics.

49
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,307
You've gotta
take some chances.

50
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,808
Now come on, buddy.

51
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,760
You can do this.

52
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:21,270
This is not good.
Definitely not good.

53
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,331
(lights chirp)

54
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,836
(warning device beeps)

55
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,349
(boy #1) All right!
(boy #2) Whoa!

56
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,850
Good one!

57
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,354
(boy #3) You went further
that time.

58
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,355
All right! Way to go, dude!

59
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:56,356
All right, line it up.

60
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,360
(warning beep stops)

61
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,365
Hey, guys, look,
it's Richie Tyler.

62
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,866
Hey, check out
his clothes.

63
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,869
Hey, Tyler, where
you going, the moon?

64
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,371
Get cable in
that thing, Tyler?

65
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,375
Hey, what's the matter,
you chicken?
(makes chicken noises)

66
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,877
What's the matter, wuss,
forgot your training wheels?

67
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,881
(laughter)

68
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,896
(gasps)

69
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,407
Uhh!

70
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,413
Uhh!

71
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,423
(thunder crashes)

72
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,424
(grunts)

73
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,941
(yells)

74
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,943
(gasps)

75
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,148
No cranial damage.

76
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,457
(warning beep stops)

77
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,917
Oh!
(roars)

78
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,472
(pants)

79
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,990
Hello?

80
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,991
(gasps)

81
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,496
(squeaking)

82
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,016
(wind howling)

83
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,987
Welcome to the library,
young man.

84
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,041
Don't tell me. You're here
for a special book.

85
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,042
Mister --

86
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,545
Stop, stop, stop.
Allow me to guess.

87
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,548
I have a talent for
guessing what people need.

88
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,051
You're in need of...

89
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,003
a fantasy.

90
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,055
Brave knights,

91
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,560
mythical fairies,
ferocious dragons.

92
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,511
Look, all I want is --

93
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,563
Adventure!

94
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:28,067
Of course. You're a boy
who loves adventure!

95
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,069
Brimming with
wicked demons,

96
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,571
cutthroat pirates --

97
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,573
No, no, that's not it.

98
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,658
Horror!

99
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:41,581
Ah, horror! Evil demons!

100
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,084
Wretched monsters!
Haunted houses!

101
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,087
Graveyards!

102
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,039
Yes.

103
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,593
It's horror for you, boy.

104
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,596
I'm sure of it.

105
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,097
Your library card, please.

106
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,600
I don't have one.

107
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,602
You do now.

108
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,107
Sign here.

109
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,111
Richard Tyler.

110
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,614
Consider this your passport

111
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:22,620
to the wonderful,
quite unpredictable
world of books.

112
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,121
But I don't
want any books.

113
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:25,623
Hmm?
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

114
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:28,125
I only came in here
'cause of the storm.

115
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:29,627
You mean you don't need...

116
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:32,079
Oh.

117
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:34,632
I see.

118
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:42,640
Is there a phone where
I can call my parents?

119
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,142
Through there.

120
00:10:46,644 --> 00:10:49,146
Proceed in a
northeasterly direction

121
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:56,153
until you get to the rotunda,
and from there head west
through the fiction section.

122
00:10:56,153 --> 00:11:01,659
And you'll find it.
A public telephone.
You can't miss it.

123
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:06,664
(wind blows eerily)

124
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,172
Don't be afraid, boy.
If you lose your way,

125
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:20,177
merely direct yourself
back to the exit sign.

126
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:28,769
(thunder)

127
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:55,212
(shoes squeak)

128
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:59,216
Wow!

129
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:34,251
Jeez!

130
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:45,763
(thunder)

131
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:47,264
Whoa! Oh!

132
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:02,780
Hello?!

133
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,233
(voice echoing)

134
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:09,736
(swordplay)

135
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,244
(horse gallops/neighs)

136
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:19,246
Uh-oh.

137
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:22,749
(falling droplets)

138
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,259
Huh?

139
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,276
Oh! Uhh!

140
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:56,283
(yells)

141
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:03,290
(roars)

142
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,293
(yells)

143
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:12,299
Uhh!

144
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:14,801
(yelling) Help!

145
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:18,305
Mister, mister,
where's the exit?!

146
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:21,808
(screams)

147
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:24,811
Help!

148
00:14:25,062 --> 00:14:28,315
(yells)

149
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,822
(gasps)

150
00:14:35,822 --> 00:14:40,327
Wha...? (gasps)

151
00:14:40,827 --> 00:14:42,829
Huh?

152
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:46,800
I'm... I'm a cartoon!

153
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:51,338
You... are an illustration.

154
00:14:51,338 --> 00:14:54,341
Who... who are you?

155
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:58,345
I am the Pagemaster,

156
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:03,317
keeper of the books
and guardian of
the written word.

157
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,854
(gasps) You're the guy
from up there!

158
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:09,856
Where are the others?

159
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:16,330
Why, they're here, of course!
And all around.

160
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,332
Maybe you can show me
the way out?

161
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:20,834
Follow me.

162
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:23,337
I-Is that the way?

163
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:26,340
Oh, the only way.

164
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:33,847
Fiction, A to Z!
Where all is possible!

165
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:40,304
Where a boy's imagination
can take root and grow
to incredible heights!

166
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:46,810
(grunting)

167
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,315
Where a boy's courage
is a wind that moves
him to discovery!

168
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:56,320
(men continue grunting)

169
00:15:58,822 --> 00:16:02,326
And where
your journey begins!

170
00:16:02,826 --> 00:16:05,329
Uhh! Whoa!

171
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:09,833
To find your way home,
you must face three tests:

172
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:14,338
horror, adventure
and fantasy.

173
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:17,841
And remember this:
when in doubt,

174
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:20,844
look to the books!

175
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:24,848
Aah! How do you
stop this thing?!

176
00:16:24,848 --> 00:16:26,483
(man #1) I am the ghost
of Christmas past...

177
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:28,852
(man #2) All the pirates
shared a grave.

178
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:33,357
(crashing)

179
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:34,858
(phone off hook)

180
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:36,860
(moans)

181
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,864
(operator) Due to the storm,
all lines have been
temporarily disconnected.

182
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:42,866
Please try your
call again later.

183
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:45,869
(moaning) Oh! Ow!

184
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:51,375
(sighs) This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.

185
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,377
(grunts)
(yells)

186
00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:58,882
Where's the son of a sea biscuit
knocked me from me crow's nest?

187
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:01,852
Where's he be?! Where's he be?

188
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:07,891
So here be the lubber who
knocked me on me poop deck
and with no apologies, too!

189
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:10,394
(growls)

190
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:13,897
You fiction
or nonfiction?

191
00:17:13,897 --> 00:17:16,867
(gasps) Uh, Richard.
Richard Tyler.

192
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:18,902
What kind of a book
would that be?

193
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:19,903
Uh, I'm not a book.

194
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:23,407
Got any proof?
(grunts)

195
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,409
See? Here's my name!

196
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:26,910
(gasps)

197
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:28,912
A library card!

198
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:32,916
Oh, begging your pardon,
lad. I didn't know
you was a customer!

199
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:36,420
Uh, look, all I wanna do
is get outta here.

200
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,425
(laughing) Of course you do,
matey! We all do.

201
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:44,895
But this is a library, mate.
Not everything's as it seems.

202
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:46,897
(thunderclap)

203
00:17:46,897 --> 00:17:51,234
(librarian) Look to the books.
Look to the books.

204
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:54,905
(gasps)

205
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:56,907
You... you said you knew
the way out?

206
00:17:56,907 --> 00:18:00,911
I know these waters like
the back of me hook!

207
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:02,913
(mutters)

208
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:06,416
Uh... Uh. This way.

209
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:08,418
I gotta get home.

210
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:11,371
My parents are probably
worried sick about me.

211
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:15,876
Well, I'm afeard I've been
dry-docked in this library

212
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:17,878
far longer than
I'd like to remember.

213
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:21,882
As I sees it, you with
your library card are
me ticket out of here!

214
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:23,383
Is it a deal, matey?

215
00:18:23,383 --> 00:18:24,885
Ooh, I'm naked.

216
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:27,854
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

217
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:31,358
Ha ha ha ha ha!
That's the spirit, lad!

218
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:33,360
Can we get going now?

219
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,863
Aye aye!
Let's scale this mast
and get our bearings!

220
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:42,869
Mast? That's a ladder.
I kind of have this thing
about heights.

221
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:47,374
Huh. I'll take care of that.
(mutters)

222
00:18:47,874 --> 00:18:49,876
Mysterious Island. Yes.

223
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:51,378
Kidnapped.

224
00:18:51,378 --> 00:18:55,882
Ah, here we be!
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

225
00:18:55,882 --> 00:18:58,885
Ah, the squid, yes, that's it!

226
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:03,890
It's a giant squid!

227
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,393
(snarls)

228
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:09,896
Ah! Whoa!

229
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:12,899
Ooh! Jump, boy!

230
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:14,401
It's jump for your life!

231
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:15,902
(squid roars)

232
00:19:15,902 --> 00:19:18,405
Ohh!

233
00:19:18,905 --> 00:19:19,573
(gasping) Uhh!

234
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:24,911
(grunting)

235
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:31,418
(woman, muffled)
Let go of my face!
I can't breathe!

236
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:34,421
(muffled voice/gasps)

237
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:37,424
What are you doing,
grabbing me like that

238
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:39,426
and messing up
my pantyhose? Hmph.

239
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:44,931
Hmph. Now I gotta straighten
out my Little Mermaid underwear.

240
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:46,933
Who... who are you?

241
00:19:47,184 --> 00:19:49,936
(grumpily) I'm Fantasy. Oh!

242
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:50,937
(clears throat)

243
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:53,940
(sweetly) I'm Fantasy!
What is this?

244
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,442
Hmm.

245
00:19:55,725 --> 00:19:57,444
It's a library card.

246
00:19:57,444 --> 00:19:59,446
(sarcastically) I'm a book,
honey, I can read.

247
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:02,449
(clears throat)
Now tell me,

248
00:20:02,449 --> 00:20:06,453
what's the one thing
you wish for more than
anything in the world?

249
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:08,037
Anything in the world?

250
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:10,540
I-I'd like to get out of here.

251
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,545
I'll grant your wish, child.
But you must do me one small
kindness in return.

252
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:16,879
You gotta check me
outta here!

253
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:19,832
That's it? OK, let's go!

254
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:23,052
Do I have to click my heels
or something?

255
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:26,055
(laughs) Honey,
you in the wrong story.

256
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:29,559
That was a close one, lad. Lad?

257
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:34,564
Hold on there, missis!
The lad's with me!

258
00:20:34,564 --> 00:20:36,065
You know
that short story?

259
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:37,567
Yeah, he's adventure.

260
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:40,069
Honey, that's what they all say.

261
00:20:40,436 --> 00:20:44,023
I heard that! I'll have
you know I'm a classic!

262
00:20:44,106 --> 00:20:46,576
Mm-hmm. A classic... misprint.

263
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:52,081
Why, you old sea serpent!
I'll rip out your pages
and use them for... Oh, no!

264
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:53,583
Do something!

265
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,084
Hmm.

266
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:58,588
(Adventure yells)

267
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:04,594
Oops! (laughs) I forgot.
My wand doesn't always work
outside the fantasy section.

268
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:07,597
You mean you can't
wish us to the exit?

269
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:12,101
(groans) That overdue shrew's
never even seen the exit.

270
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:13,603
More than you have, shorty!

271
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:17,607
In fact, the exit's just beyond
my fantasy section. Hmph!

272
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:19,609
Then what are ye doing
in these parts?

273
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:22,111
There a witches' convention
around here, maybe?

274
00:21:22,445 --> 00:21:26,115
Look, I was misshelved. (laughs)

275
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:31,621
But that's over, now that
young Prince Charming here
has come to check me out.

276
00:21:31,621 --> 00:21:34,624
My good eye, he is.
The lad's checking me out!

277
00:21:34,957 --> 00:21:37,627
Come on, boy, we're
wasting time chumming off
this dinghy.

278
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:39,629
It's on to
the exit for us!

279
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:44,133
If he thinks the exit's in
that direction, you know
it's got to be in this one!

280
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:47,136
Don't listen to her,
mate. She's not sailing
with a full crew!

281
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,139
Ah-ah-ah! (sneezes)

282
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:54,143
Fantasy!
She's a bloody nightmare.

283
00:21:54,143 --> 00:21:57,647
Let's leave him. He doesn't
even know where we are now!

284
00:21:57,647 --> 00:22:00,650
Bilge water! Of course
I know where we are! We're...

285
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:05,154
Hound of the Baskervilles.
Ha! We're in Baskervilles.

286
00:22:05,154 --> 00:22:06,656
Have a look-see!

287
00:22:06,656 --> 00:22:08,157
Hmm. Huh?

288
00:22:08,658 --> 00:22:10,276
(barks/growls)

289
00:22:10,276 --> 00:22:14,947
(screams)

290
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:17,166
Hey, this way!
Through here!

291
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:19,669
Nice doggy! Good doggy!

292
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:22,672
Hurry!
(grunts)

293
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:24,173
(barks)

294
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:27,176
(all panting)

295
00:22:34,183 --> 00:22:36,185
(sighs) Oh, baby.

296
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:38,187
Are we still in the library?

297
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:41,190
Aye, lad,
the horror section.

298
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,192
It looks pretty scary.

299
00:22:43,192 --> 00:22:45,695
That it does.
Just stay close to me and...

300
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:47,697
and you got nothing
to worry about.

301
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:49,699
(sarcastically) Mm-hmm.

302
00:23:03,212 --> 00:23:08,217
There it is! The exit! (pants)

303
00:23:08,384 --> 00:23:10,720
(sighs)

304
00:23:15,224 --> 00:23:19,228
Looks like the only way
to reach the exit is
through that there house.

305
00:23:19,562 --> 00:23:21,230
No way I'm going in there.

306
00:23:21,564 --> 00:23:23,733
It's your only chance, boy.

307
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:25,234
It's just a house.

308
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:29,739
Yeah, but 70%
of all accidents
are household-related.

309
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:40,699
Dr. Jekyll. Mr. Hyde.
Must be a duplex.

310
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,701
Whoa!

311
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:44,703
Go ahead, matey. I'm...
I'm right behind ye.

312
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:45,704
(gasps)

313
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:52,711
Well? Ring the bell.

314
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:56,715
(pants)

315
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:57,716
(doorbell chimes)

316
00:23:57,716 --> 00:24:01,720
Ohh!

317
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,222
Good catch!

318
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:04,690
Here, take it.

319
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,194
Isn't he sweet?
(makes kissing sounds)

320
00:24:08,444 --> 00:24:10,696
Oh, I scared you.

321
00:24:11,113 --> 00:24:12,198
I'm sorry!

322
00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:14,700
You mustn't judge a book
by its cover.

323
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,703
Look, he's smiling!

324
00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:19,705
(laughing)

325
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:21,207
That's a smile?

326
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:22,708
All right, teatime's over.

327
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,212
Let's start
navigating this house.

328
00:24:26,212 --> 00:24:29,215
Huh? No, wait!
Don't go in there!

329
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:31,217
It's scary inside!

330
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:34,220
Ha! I ain't afeared of nothing!

331
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,671
I'm afraid.

332
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:36,722
Of what?

333
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,724
Of, of... (yells)

334
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:40,726
And... Aah!

335
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:42,728
And... (makes creepy noise)

336
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:46,182
And... (imitates
woman screaming)

337
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:48,184
Uh, I know how you feel.

338
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:52,188
Horror always has sad endings.

339
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:54,690
I come from a world
of happy endings.

340
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,692
Why don't you
come with us?

341
00:24:56,826 --> 00:24:59,695
Yeah! And maybe you could
help us through the house.

342
00:24:59,862 --> 00:25:04,200
Through the house? Hm. Uh.

343
00:25:04,366 --> 00:25:05,201
You can do it.

344
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:07,203
'Kay.

345
00:25:09,205 --> 00:25:10,206
Friend?

346
00:25:10,206 --> 00:25:12,208
(gulps)

347
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:15,711
(gasps) Oops!

348
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:19,215
Come on!

349
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:20,216
(laughs)

350
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:22,218
(sings indistinctly)

351
00:25:22,218 --> 00:25:25,221
(gasps)

352
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:27,223
Hmm?

353
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:29,225
(mutters indistinctly)

354
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,732
(shivers)

355
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:39,735
He-hello?

356
00:25:41,237 --> 00:25:43,739
A-anybody home?

357
00:25:52,915 --> 00:25:53,749
(door slams shut)

358
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:54,750
(all gasp)

359
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,253
What was that?

360
00:25:57,753 --> 00:26:01,257
(screeches) Nevermore!

361
00:26:01,257 --> 00:26:03,259
Get me out of here!

362
00:26:12,268 --> 00:26:15,771
May I assist you
in some way?

363
00:26:16,238 --> 00:26:18,774
Oh. Hello there, Mr...?

364
00:26:18,774 --> 00:26:22,278
Doctor. Dr. Jekyll.

365
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,784
Well, sir, we did
ring the bell.

366
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:30,786
It's all my fault.

367
00:26:30,786 --> 00:26:33,789
I was trying to help them
find their way to
the other side of the house.

368
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:36,292
The other side?

369
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:42,298
My boy, I derive no pleasure
in telling you that
you are in extreme danger.

370
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:43,299
Danger?

371
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:44,767
Even as we speak.

372
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:51,307
Lurking in this very room,
waiting to strike,
are forces of evil.

373
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:54,777
(gasps)

374
00:26:54,777 --> 00:26:57,813
(screams) Wait for me!
Wait for me!

375
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:08,824
Every man is possessed of
both good... and evil.

376
00:27:10,826 --> 00:27:13,329
(suavely) Oh, yes.

377
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:16,332
But enough of that.
Anyone care for a drink?

378
00:27:16,332 --> 00:27:18,834
Hmm?

379
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,841
Ah.

380
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:29,345
I'll have a go
with you, doc.

381
00:27:30,346 --> 00:27:31,847
Ooh!

382
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:33,849
Stay back!
This is a man's drink!

383
00:27:33,849 --> 00:27:37,853
(laughs) Can I have the olive?

384
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:39,355
Oh!

385
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:40,356
Uh-oh.

386
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:42,358
Now look what you've done!

387
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:45,861
Whoa!

388
00:27:45,861 --> 00:27:48,364
Ooh!

389
00:27:48,697 --> 00:27:53,335
No! No, no!
Don't drink it!
Don't, don't!

390
00:27:53,335 --> 00:27:56,338
(gasps)

391
00:27:56,338 --> 00:28:00,125
(yelling)

392
00:28:01,844 --> 00:28:06,849
(moaning)

393
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:07,850
(all gasp)

394
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:12,855
(moans)

395
00:28:12,855 --> 00:28:17,359
(laughs)

396
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,362
(laughs maniacally)

397
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:26,368
Dr... Jekyll?

398
00:28:26,368 --> 00:28:28,370
Dr. J?

399
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:33,375
My name is... Mr. Hyde!

400
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:35,878
(all gasp/scream)

401
00:28:38,247 --> 00:28:40,382
Easy, there!

402
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:54,396
(yelps)

403
00:28:54,396 --> 00:28:56,899
The stairs, mateys,
the stairs!

404
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:58,400
Ahh!

405
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,404
Help, master!
Don't leave me!

406
00:29:02,905 --> 00:29:06,909
This is no way to treat
a library book. Sanctuary!

407
00:29:07,242 --> 00:29:10,913
Sanctuary!

408
00:29:10,913 --> 00:29:13,916
(laughs maniacally)

409
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:16,418
Sanctuary!

410
00:29:16,418 --> 00:29:18,420
Honey, you got to help him!

411
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,922
But I-I...

412
00:29:19,922 --> 00:29:21,423
Oh!

413
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:26,929
At least this wand
is good for something.

414
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:35,437
Come on!

415
00:29:35,437 --> 00:29:36,939
Which way?

416
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:39,441
Down.
Definitely down.

417
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:43,445
No, up, definitely up!
Up, up, up!

418
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:44,897
Come on!

419
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:57,459
(gasping)

420
00:30:01,463 --> 00:30:03,465
What's going on?

421
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:06,919
Ghost stories.

422
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:09,471
(screaming)

423
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:10,973
Ha ha!

424
00:30:10,973 --> 00:30:14,476
Get me outta here!

425
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:18,346
Aah!

426
00:30:18,346 --> 00:30:21,349
Close the door!

427
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:23,351
Whoa!

428
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:26,354
Down there? I-I can't.

429
00:30:26,688 --> 00:30:31,359
Come on, boy!
Even books have spines.

430
00:30:31,526 --> 00:30:32,861
Come, master!

431
00:30:33,027 --> 00:30:34,362
I can do this.
I can do this.

432
00:30:36,865 --> 00:30:38,199
Aah!

433
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:40,869
Uhh! Uhh!

434
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:44,372
(growls)

435
00:30:44,372 --> 00:30:47,375
(Pagemaster's voice) Reach deep
within yourself, Richard.

436
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,877
Seize the courage.

437
00:30:48,877 --> 00:30:50,378
Uhh! Uhh!

438
00:30:50,378 --> 00:30:53,381
Whoa!

439
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:55,383
Yay! You did it!
You did it!

440
00:30:55,383 --> 00:30:57,886
Grand, boy!

441
00:30:58,052 --> 00:30:59,387
(laughing)

442
00:30:59,387 --> 00:31:03,391
Hooray, hooray, hooray.

443
00:31:03,858 --> 00:31:06,394
Wow.

444
00:31:08,897 --> 00:31:11,399
(chuckles)

445
00:31:13,902 --> 00:31:15,904
(breathes deeply)

446
00:31:15,904 --> 00:31:20,875
Do ya smell it?
Breathe it in, mateys.

447
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:27,382
Ha ha! The land
of adventure!

448
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:31,386
Look! There's the exit!

449
00:31:31,386 --> 00:31:34,389
(all chuckling)

450
00:31:42,897 --> 00:31:46,901
(chuckling)

451
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:49,904
Hey! Wait for me!

452
00:31:52,407 --> 00:31:56,411
Ha ha ha!
Home, sweet home!

453
00:31:56,411 --> 00:31:59,914
There's only room
for one up here.

454
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:06,921
From now on,
it'll be smooth sailin'!

455
00:32:07,422 --> 00:32:08,423
(laughing)

456
00:32:08,756 --> 00:32:10,375
What are ya laughin' at?

457
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:12,877
(laughing)

458
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:14,429
Whoa!

459
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:15,930
Uhh!

460
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,383
A boat!

461
00:32:20,885 --> 00:32:22,887
Is it... safe?

462
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:24,889
I wrote the book on sailin'.

463
00:32:24,889 --> 00:32:27,392
In fact, I am
the book on sailin'.

464
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,396
I'm impressed.

465
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:33,865
(laughing)

466
00:32:33,948 --> 00:32:35,900
We're sinking.
We're going down!

467
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,402
Somebody do something!

468
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:39,404
(wailing)

469
00:32:41,406 --> 00:32:43,908
Thank you.

470
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:46,411
Shove off, lads!

471
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:53,418
(dd accordion)

472
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:56,421
(Rich) Jeez, the water
looks kind of choppy.

473
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:59,924
Maybe we should've stayed
back there where it was safe.

474
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:08,933
(plays discordant note)

475
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:10,435
Whalin' men.

476
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:11,936
(men grunting)

477
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:14,939
(Adventure)
It's Cap'n Ahab, it is!

478
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:20,411
Another guy with a peg leg.

479
00:33:20,411 --> 00:33:24,415
Mm-hmm. Seems to be
a fashion statement
around here.

480
00:33:24,866 --> 00:33:27,919
Did you see it?!
(Rich) See what?!

481
00:33:28,202 --> 00:33:31,422
The devil of the deep.
The white whale.

482
00:33:31,422 --> 00:33:32,924
Hmm?
Moby Dick!

483
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:39,430
Thar she blows!

484
00:33:42,216 --> 00:33:46,437
I grin at thee,
thou grinning whale!

485
00:33:46,854 --> 00:33:48,940
(gasps) He's possessed!

486
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,441
He's insane!

487
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:52,443
He's my kind of guy!

488
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:55,446
(grunting)

489
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,948
Look!

490
00:33:56,948 --> 00:33:58,449
It's headed
straight for them!

491
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,453
Thou damned whale!

492
00:34:02,453 --> 00:34:05,456
Thus, I give up the spear!

493
00:34:05,456 --> 00:34:07,458
(growls)

494
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:14,465
So, you think
I scared it?

495
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:17,468
He shouldn't swim
right after eating,
you know.

496
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:19,470
He'll get cramps.

497
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,972
Where did he go?

498
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:23,975
Aah!

499
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:26,978
Row! Row for your lives!

500
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:33,818
(screaming)

501
00:34:43,494 --> 00:34:46,497
(coughing)

502
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:53,504
Guys! Where are you?!

503
00:34:55,506 --> 00:34:57,008
(panting)

504
00:34:57,008 --> 00:35:01,512
(screaming)

505
00:35:01,512 --> 00:35:04,515
(sputtering)

506
00:35:04,515 --> 00:35:08,019
Adventure? Boy, am I
ever glad to see you.

507
00:35:11,522 --> 00:35:14,025
Huh?

508
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:16,027
All right, all right!

509
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:18,029
Where's Horror?

510
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:20,531
And Fantasy?

511
00:35:24,952 --> 00:35:26,954
Where are they?

512
00:35:26,954 --> 00:35:29,490
I searched for 'em
as much as I could, mate.

513
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,995
I'm afraid...
I'm afraid they've gone
below with Davy Jones.

514
00:35:34,295 --> 00:35:36,497
No, it can't be.

515
00:35:44,972 --> 00:35:48,009
You guys are the only
friends I've ever had.

516
00:35:48,009 --> 00:35:51,512
(sniffling)

517
00:35:51,512 --> 00:35:54,015
She's a cruel sea, lad.

518
00:35:56,517 --> 00:35:59,520
They gotta be out there.

519
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:01,522
Horror!

520
00:36:03,024 --> 00:36:04,525
Fantasy!

521
00:36:07,028 --> 00:36:08,529
Sharks!

522
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:11,532
(gasping)

523
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:14,535
We may be joining them
other two sooner
than you think.

524
00:36:16,537 --> 00:36:18,539
Hey, look!

525
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:22,043
Help, help! Over here!

526
00:36:22,043 --> 00:36:25,546
Careful, mate. Not all sharks
are in the water.

527
00:36:25,546 --> 00:36:27,548
Get us out of here!

528
00:36:27,548 --> 00:36:28,549
(grunts)

529
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:30,551
This way! Help!

530
00:36:33,054 --> 00:36:35,556
(chuckling evilly)

531
00:36:35,556 --> 00:36:38,559
It's a good thing
you guys came along.

532
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:43,564
Ohh! We're missing
two others about his size.
Did you see 'em?

533
00:36:43,564 --> 00:36:46,067
He's all the catch
we've had today.

534
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:48,069
(growls)

535
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:52,573
(laughing)

536
00:36:53,574 --> 00:36:56,577
(blows whistle)

537
00:36:56,577 --> 00:36:59,080
Huh?

538
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:05,086
(whistle blows in distance)

539
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,102
I knew it! It's him!

540
00:37:21,102 --> 00:37:23,104
Who?

541
00:37:23,104 --> 00:37:27,608
The meanest, black-hearted
pirate that ever sailed
the seven seas.

542
00:37:27,608 --> 00:37:29,610
Long John Silver!

543
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:32,613
(cackling)

544
00:37:32,613 --> 00:37:34,615
(cocks gun)

545
00:37:34,782 --> 00:37:36,617
Just set your keel down, mate.

546
00:37:36,784 --> 00:37:39,620
John Silver's
expecting live company.

547
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,623
(cackling)

548
00:37:45,126 --> 00:37:47,128
Uhh!

549
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:54,635
Give the word,
Cap'n Silver, sir,

550
00:37:55,136 --> 00:37:57,138
and I'll show you
the color of his insides.

551
00:37:57,638 --> 00:37:59,640
Red! Red! They're red!

552
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,644
Stow your cutlass,
Tom Morgan.

553
00:38:04,145 --> 00:38:07,148
I want a better look
at his outsides first.

554
00:38:07,148 --> 00:38:09,150
Long John Silver!

555
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,652
Aye, lad,
the very same.

556
00:38:11,652 --> 00:38:15,156
Well, seeing as how
me men plucked you
out of the water

557
00:38:15,656 --> 00:38:17,158
like a drownin'
field rat,

558
00:38:17,158 --> 00:38:20,161
you'll be joinin'
our happy family

559
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:23,164
as our new cabin boy.

560
00:38:23,164 --> 00:38:26,667
Thanks, but I already
have a family.

561
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:29,170
I really should be
getting home now.

562
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:33,174
Oh, I think
you are home.
Heh heh heh heh.

563
00:38:33,674 --> 00:38:38,646
John Silver! Touch one hair
on that boy's head,
and you'll be answerin' to me!

564
00:38:38,646 --> 00:38:40,681
(laughs)

565
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:43,651
Well, come aboard,
matey! Ha ha.

566
00:38:43,651 --> 00:38:45,152
Uhh!

567
00:38:49,357 --> 00:38:53,194
You wouldn't happen to be
going after me treasure,
would you, now?

568
00:38:53,694 --> 00:38:56,697
You ain't got any treasure
worth goin' after!

569
00:38:56,864 --> 00:38:58,699
No treasure?
No treasure?

570
00:38:59,033 --> 00:39:01,952
He's lyin'! There's plenty
of treasure for all of ya!

571
00:39:02,203 --> 00:39:03,204
Search him!

572
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:05,206
The boy, too.

573
00:39:05,206 --> 00:39:06,791
(pirates laughing)

574
00:39:12,713 --> 00:39:14,215
(dd accordion)

575
00:39:14,215 --> 00:39:17,718
Hmm. Why, looky here.

576
00:39:17,718 --> 00:39:19,720
Here he be, Cap'n.

577
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:22,223
What might this here be?

578
00:39:22,223 --> 00:39:24,225
Money! It's yours! Keep it!

579
00:39:24,225 --> 00:39:26,227
Money, he says!

580
00:39:26,227 --> 00:39:28,229
Keep it, he says!

581
00:39:28,229 --> 00:39:31,232
(laughing hysterically)

582
00:39:31,232 --> 00:39:33,234
Hmm. Library card.

583
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:34,735
Library card?

584
00:39:35,236 --> 00:39:37,738
A cabin boy don't need
no library card.

585
00:39:37,738 --> 00:39:39,240
(laughs)
(screeches)

586
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,125
(gasping)

587
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,744
I'd like to get out of here!

588
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:49,250
Land ho!

589
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,753
Land ho!

There she be, mateys!

591
00:39:56,757 --> 00:39:59,260
Treasure Island!

592
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,763
(cheering)

593
00:40:02,763 --> 00:40:05,766
(laughing)

594
00:40:14,275 --> 00:40:15,776
Stay on your toes, mate.

595
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:18,279
When they go for the gold,
we'll make our break.

596
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:19,780
Quit your squawkin'!

597
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,249
Look to the map.
What's it say?

598
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:26,253
It's, uh, in the middle
by the waterfall.

599
00:40:26,253 --> 00:40:29,290
No, it's east
by some broccoli.

600
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,258
Give me that!
Broccoli.

601
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:34,762
You half-wits,
that's west by a tree!

602
00:40:34,845 --> 00:40:38,265
(muttering)
Oh, east by broccoli.

603
00:40:38,265 --> 00:40:41,268
(parrot) They're all idiots.

604
00:40:41,268 --> 00:40:44,271
(gasps)

605
00:40:44,438 --> 00:40:47,775
What sort of way is that
for bones to lie?

606
00:40:47,775 --> 00:40:49,777
It ain't natural.

607
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,780
This island's haunted.
It's accursed, it is!

608
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,282
Oh, you're all yellow dogs.

609
00:40:55,282 --> 00:40:57,785
Open your eyes.
The bones is the compass

610
00:40:58,285 --> 00:40:59,787
pointin' the way
to the doubloons.

611
00:40:59,787 --> 00:41:01,789
(all gasp)

612
00:41:01,789 --> 00:41:05,292
(laughing hysterically)

613
00:41:08,295 --> 00:41:10,297
It's gone!

614
00:41:10,297 --> 00:41:13,300
Dig deeper, boys!

615
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,805
(Long John) I say, dig deeper!
Find the treasure!

616
00:41:17,805 --> 00:41:22,309
One gold piece. This is
your treasure, is it?

617
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:25,262
Let's kill him
and eat his parrot.

618
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:26,814
Stand by for trouble.

619
00:41:27,014 --> 00:41:30,317
We mighta known
you'd double-cross us.

620
00:41:30,517 --> 00:41:31,318
(parrot squawks)

621
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:34,822
Throw down your weapons,
John Silver!

622
00:41:35,322 --> 00:41:38,826
Why, you pack of
back-bitin' dogs.

623
00:41:38,826 --> 00:41:41,829
You'll be regrettin' this,
George Merry.

624
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:46,283
Save your speeches.
Dead men don't bite.

625
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:54,341
(Horror) dd 16 men on
a dead man's stomach dd

626
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:56,844
(Fantasy) No! No!
Chest! Chest!

627
00:41:56,844 --> 00:41:58,345
Chest! Chest!

628
00:41:58,345 --> 00:42:00,347

dd Yo, ho, ho
and a bottle of rum dd

630
00:42:03,851 --> 00:42:07,354
Evil spirits.

631
00:42:07,354 --> 00:42:08,856
Sanctuary!

632
00:42:08,856 --> 00:42:10,357
(shouting)

633
00:42:10,691 --> 00:42:11,859
Ohh.

634
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:14,361
Horror! You're alive!

635
00:42:14,695 --> 00:42:17,865
Not for long.
Hee hee hee hee hee!

636
00:42:17,865 --> 00:42:18,866
Aah!

637
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:21,368
Ohh!

638
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:22,870
Ohh-ohh!

639
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,872
Ahchoo!

640
00:42:30,744 --> 00:42:31,879
Fantasy!

641
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:34,498
Naturally. But who were
you expecting, honey,

642
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:37,885
the tooth fairy? (laughs)

643
00:42:37,885 --> 00:42:38,886
Get them!

644
00:42:39,253 --> 00:42:42,389
Ha ha! At last, a good fight!

645
00:42:42,589 --> 00:42:44,391
Aah!

646
00:42:44,558 --> 00:42:45,392
Uhh!

647
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:47,394
(muffled) Get me outta here!

648
00:42:49,396 --> 00:42:52,399
(laughing)

649
00:42:52,399 --> 00:42:53,901
(waggling tongue)

(laughing)

651
00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:59,022
Hey!

652
00:42:59,022 --> 00:43:00,407
Why, you...!

653
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:02,859
(grunting)

654
00:43:02,943 --> 00:43:04,912
Hey!

656
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:09,917
Uhh!

657
00:43:10,284 --> 00:43:13,420
(parrot squawks)

658
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,924
Get the boat, boy.
We're gonna be shovin' off.

659
00:43:17,257 --> 00:43:18,425
I'm not going
with you.

660
00:43:18,926 --> 00:43:20,928
The sword, honey.
Get the sword.

661
00:43:21,261 --> 00:43:25,432
Don't even think it, boy.
He ain't got the heart.

662
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,434
(shivering)

663
00:43:27,434 --> 00:43:29,436
Hyah! Uhh!

664
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:30,938
(grunts)

665
00:43:31,138 --> 00:43:32,439
Stay back!

666
00:43:32,439 --> 00:43:34,441
Avast there, laddie.

667
00:43:34,441 --> 00:43:37,894
Somebody could get hurt
with that blade you got thar.

668
00:43:37,978 --> 00:43:39,446
Be careful, master.

669
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,448
(squawks) In the boat.

670
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:45,953
Huh? Easy now, matey.
Easy. I'm goin'.

671
00:43:45,953 --> 00:43:49,456
Right ye are.
Into the boat, aye aye.

672
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:52,960
Ye be a hard lad,
Richard Tyler.

673
00:43:54,962 --> 00:43:58,465
(grunting)

674
00:44:00,467 --> 00:44:02,970
Good sailin' to ya, shipmate.

675
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:06,974
dd 15 men on a dead man's chest

676
00:44:06,974 --> 00:44:09,977
dd Yo, ho, ho
and a bottle of rum dd

677
00:44:12,479 --> 00:44:13,981
Way to go, honey.
Yes!

678
00:44:13,981 --> 00:44:15,482
(laughing)

679
00:44:15,482 --> 00:44:19,987
Whew. Oh, I wish
my dad coulda seen me.

680
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,489
Boy, I thought
you two were goners.

681
00:44:22,489 --> 00:44:23,490
We almost were,

682
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,994
until this enchanting fellow
discovered he could float.

683
00:44:26,994 --> 00:44:29,997
It's hollow.

684
00:44:29,997 --> 00:44:33,000
(grunting)

685
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,501
Who's there?
Adventure!

686
00:44:35,002 --> 00:44:36,003
Adventure who?

687
00:44:36,003 --> 00:44:38,005
What do you mean,
Adventure who?!

688
00:44:38,005 --> 00:44:40,507
Open the blasted door,
you dog-eared...

689
00:44:40,507 --> 00:44:42,959
Aah!

690
00:44:43,043 --> 00:44:45,962
(chuckles) Perfect timing.

691
00:44:46,046 --> 00:44:49,516
I was just thanking
these guys for saving us.

692
00:44:49,516 --> 00:44:51,018
(growls)

693
00:44:51,018 --> 00:44:52,519
I coulda taken
the lot of 'em

694
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:55,022
with one hand
tied behind me back.

695
00:44:55,022 --> 00:44:58,025
That's just his way
of saying thanks.

696
00:45:00,527 --> 00:45:04,031
You're welcome!

697
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:08,535
Ahoy, matey!

698
00:45:08,535 --> 00:45:11,538
Aye, we're lusty
adventurous men.

699
00:45:11,538 --> 00:45:15,042
Go away. You don't know
what you're talkin' about.

700
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:18,495
I-I know I'm not
your favorite kind of book,

701
00:45:18,578 --> 00:45:20,047
but I could be
just like you.

702
00:45:20,047 --> 00:45:22,049
You'll never be Adventure!

703
00:45:22,049 --> 00:45:24,551
Ye ain't got
the spine for it.

704
00:45:24,551 --> 00:45:27,054
And take that
stupid thing off!

705
00:45:27,054 --> 00:45:29,005
Sorry.

706
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:31,007
(muttering) Oh, he thinks
he can be a pirate.

707
00:45:31,091 --> 00:45:33,560
(sighs)

708
00:45:44,771 --> 00:45:46,073
(sighs)

709
00:45:46,573 --> 00:45:52,579
(Pagemaster's voice)
Seize the courage, Richard,
then you will reach the exit.

710
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:54,581
I'll never get home.

711
00:45:54,581 --> 00:45:56,583
You did good, honey.

712
00:45:58,585 --> 00:46:02,589
I lost the library card.
I can't check anybody out.

713
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:05,092
I'll never get
to the exit now.

714
00:46:05,092 --> 00:46:08,095
Honey, never say "never"
around Fantasy,

715
00:46:08,095 --> 00:46:12,599
because sometimes
you've got to fight
to make a wish come true.

716
00:46:12,766 --> 00:46:15,602
So come on.
Don't quit on me now.

717
00:46:15,602 --> 00:46:17,104
Yeah.

718
00:46:19,106 --> 00:46:21,608
Huh! That crazy hunchbook. Ahh.

719
00:46:21,608 --> 00:46:24,111
You don't see me
pretending to be Horror.

720
00:46:27,614 --> 00:46:29,116
(groans)

721
00:46:30,617 --> 00:46:33,620
(gasps/grunts)

722
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:38,125
Why are you sittin' around
like a bunch of ol' wenches
at teatime?!

723
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:40,127
Pick one.

724
00:46:40,627 --> 00:46:42,129
Mmm...

725
00:46:42,129 --> 00:46:43,630
That one.

726
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,132
(chuckles)

727
00:46:45,132 --> 00:46:47,134
My library card!

728
00:46:47,134 --> 00:46:48,635
I wrestled it away
from three sharks

729
00:46:48,635 --> 00:46:50,137
who was eyein' it
for breakfast,

730
00:46:50,137 --> 00:46:52,639
at no small threat
to me life, neither.

731
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:54,141
Mm-hmm.

732
00:46:54,641 --> 00:46:57,644
Where's Horror?
Wasn't he with you?

733
00:46:57,978 --> 00:47:01,648
He was, but he, uh...
I mean, I sort of, uh...
He, uh...

734
00:47:01,648 --> 00:47:03,650
What did you say
to him now?!

735
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:06,653
Well, I, uh, I, uh,
I just, uh, uh...

736
00:47:06,653 --> 00:47:08,155
I'll go find him.

737
00:47:08,155 --> 00:47:11,608
Yeah, you better
go find him.
And be quick about it!

738
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,662
Horror!

739
00:47:15,662 --> 00:47:18,665
Horror!

740
00:47:18,665 --> 00:47:20,167
(gasps) Horror!

741
00:47:20,534 --> 00:47:22,669
(Adventure) Horror.

742
00:47:22,669 --> 00:47:25,121
(chattering)

743
00:47:31,678 --> 00:47:34,681
Hang on, mate! I'm coming!

744
00:47:34,681 --> 00:47:37,684
(shouting)

745
00:47:37,684 --> 00:47:42,189
You're lucky I was published
with a thick hide!

746
00:47:42,689 --> 00:47:44,191
Hmm?

747
00:47:44,191 --> 00:47:45,192
(shouts)

748
00:47:45,192 --> 00:47:47,194
(screaming)

749
00:47:47,194 --> 00:47:49,696
Come back, ya jellyfish!

750
00:47:49,696 --> 00:47:53,200
(sighing)

751
00:47:55,202 --> 00:47:58,205
Speak to me, mate.

752
00:47:58,205 --> 00:48:04,211
Ye had a good heart
and ye was braver
than ye knew.

753
00:48:04,711 --> 00:48:11,718
I'd walk the plank
if I thought it would
bring him back.

754
00:48:11,718 --> 00:48:13,720
That's beautiful.

755
00:48:14,221 --> 00:48:15,222
Huh?

756
00:48:15,222 --> 00:48:17,224
This is too cute.

757
00:48:17,224 --> 00:48:19,226
Uhh!

758
00:48:19,226 --> 00:48:20,227
Are you OK?

759
00:48:20,227 --> 00:48:22,729
Thanks to my friend here.

760
00:48:22,729 --> 00:48:25,232
Get off me!

761
00:48:25,232 --> 00:48:27,234
Did you see that?

762
00:48:27,234 --> 00:48:28,735
See what?

763
00:48:28,735 --> 00:48:30,737
My wand! It's blinkin'!

764
00:48:30,737 --> 00:48:32,739
That can only mean
one thing.

765
00:48:32,739 --> 00:48:33,740
The exit!

766
00:48:33,941 --> 00:48:35,943
The checkout!
A happy ending.

767
00:48:35,943 --> 00:48:37,444
Ohh!

768
00:48:37,444 --> 00:48:40,447
(Horror laughing)

769
00:48:43,951 --> 00:48:47,454
(laughs) Let's go!
Come on!

770
00:48:47,454 --> 00:48:51,458
Are you sure that
swizzle stick of yours
is workin' right?

771
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:55,963
Hmm. I don't know.
Maybe we should test it.

772
00:49:02,469 --> 00:49:05,973
You've gone overboard,
missis!

773
00:49:05,973 --> 00:49:07,474

774
00:49:07,474 --> 00:49:10,477

Hey! Don't go up there!

800
00:51:07,594 --> 00:51:11,098
What's the matter?
Is Adventure afraid
to go in?

801
00:51:11,264 --> 00:51:15,102
What?! I live for

00:53:04,177 --> 00:53:06,680
(grunting)

826
00:53:09,683 --> 00:53:12,385
(screaming)

827
00:53:21,228 --> 00:53:22,696
We're gonna make it!

828
00:53:22,696 --> 00:53:24,197
Hooray! We're gonna make --
Aah!

829
00:53:24,397 --> 00:53:27,200
My wand!

830
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,203
Oh, baby. I wish
that hadn't happened.

831
00:53:36,543 --> 00:53:39,963
(yelling)

832
00:53:45,218 --> 00:53:46,720
(crash)

833
00:53:48,388 --> 00:53:51,224
(grunting)

834
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,730
Come on, guys! The exit!

835
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:58,732
(all groaning)

836
00:53:58,898 --> 00:54:00,734
This way, guys!

837
00:54:06,573 --> 00:54:07,741
(gasps)

838
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:11,661
Aah!

839
00:54:13,747 --> 00:54:15,749
We're almost there!

840
00:54:25,759 --> 00:54:27,761
We made it!

841
00:54:30,263 --> 00:54:31,765
Guys?

842
00:54:36,269 --> 00:54:38,271
This dragon is history!

843
00:54:38,271 --> 00:54:41,725
Don't try to stop me!

844
00:54:42,776 --> 00:54:44,728
Be careful.

845
00:54:44,811 --> 00:54:46,780
Huh? Hmm.

846
00:54:51,785 --> 00:54:53,286
(giggles)

847
00:54:53,286 --> 00:54:55,288
You really are a classic.

848
00:54:55,288 --> 00:54:57,290
(gasps)

849
00:55:00,293 --> 00:55:02,796
(chuckles)

850
00:55:02,796 --> 00:55:06,299
Mmm!
(sighs)

851
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:10,804
How would you like
to curl up with
a good book?

852
00:55:10,804 --> 00:55:11,805
(smack)

853
00:55:11,805 --> 00:55:13,306
(grunting)

854
00:55:13,306 --> 00:55:14,808
Me binding!

855
00:55:14,808 --> 00:55:17,310
In your dreams!

856
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:19,312
Ooh!

857
00:55:19,312 --> 00:55:21,815
Adventure, up here!

858
00:55:21,815 --> 00:55:25,819
Go on, lad! Save yourself!

859
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:29,322
You think a bag of hot air
is enough to stop me?!

860
00:55:29,322 --> 00:55:33,326
Dragon. He's more like
a dragonfly, he is!
And with big teeth!

861
00:55:33,326 --> 00:55:34,828
Look out!

862
00:55:34,828 --> 00:55:37,831
(gasping)

863
00:55:37,831 --> 00:55:41,835
(growling)

864
00:55:43,336 --> 00:55:45,839
(humming)

865
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,340
Uhh.

866
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,794
Happy birthday.

867
00:55:50,877 --> 00:55:53,847
(sighs)

868
00:55:58,852 --> 00:55:59,853
(growls)

869
00:56:08,361 --> 00:56:11,865
Hang on, guys! I'm coming!

870
00:56:13,867 --> 00:56:14,868
A sword.

871
00:56:33,386 --> 00:56:34,888
Yes!

872
00:56:41,561 --> 00:56:44,898
Ha ha! That's it, boy!
Go for the gizzard!

873
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,902
Bite him, bite him!

874
00:56:48,902 --> 00:56:50,403
(barks)

875
00:56:54,908 --> 00:56:58,411
Aah!

876
00:56:58,411 --> 00:57:00,914
Yah!

877
00:57:02,282 --> 00:57:03,917
Watch out for his tail!

878
00:57:04,284 --> 00:57:05,418
(Adventure) You've got
him on the run!

879
00:57:05,752 --> 00:57:07,921
Aah!

880
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:10,924
(grunting)

881
00:57:16,262 --> 00:57:18,932
I'm not scared of you!

882
00:57:19,132 --> 00:57:20,934
Aah!

883
00:57:25,438 --> 00:57:28,441
Aah!

884
00:57:30,944 --> 00:57:32,445
Huh?

885
00:57:35,648 --> 00:57:36,950
(coughing)

886
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,451
Aah!

887
00:57:38,451 --> 00:57:40,954
(coughs)

888
00:57:40,954 --> 00:57:43,456
I gotta get out of here.

889
00:57:43,456 --> 00:57:46,459
(grunting)

890
00:57:46,459 --> 00:57:48,461
Aah!

891
00:57:49,963 --> 00:57:52,966
Fantasy's wand!

892
00:57:56,469 --> 00:58:00,473
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.

893
00:58:00,473 --> 00:58:01,474
Uh-oh.

894
00:58:01,474 --> 00:58:04,978
(ghostly voice)
Look to the books.
Look to the books.

895
00:58:04,978 --> 00:58:06,980
Look to the books.

896
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,982
Look to the books!

897
00:58:08,982 --> 00:58:12,986
Alice in Wonderland.

898
00:58:12,986 --> 00:58:15,488
Off with his head!

899
00:58:15,488 --> 00:58:17,991
Sheesh!

900
00:58:17,991 --> 00:58:20,994
Mnh-mnh.

901
00:58:20,994 --> 00:58:22,495
Mnh-mnh.

902
00:58:22,996 --> 00:58:24,998
Jack and the Beanstalk.

903
00:58:24,998 --> 00:58:27,500
Yeah! This is it!

904
00:58:30,003 --> 00:58:32,005
(gasping)

905
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:43,516
I hate heights!

906
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:48,521
Aah!

907
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:50,023
Matey!

908
00:58:50,523 --> 00:58:52,025
He's alive!

909
00:58:52,025 --> 00:58:54,527
Aah!

910
00:58:54,527 --> 00:58:56,529
Come on, guys!

911
00:58:56,529 --> 00:58:58,531
Uhh!

912
00:58:58,531 --> 00:59:01,534
(laughing)

913
00:59:07,624 --> 00:59:11,044
(grunting)

914
00:59:15,048 --> 00:59:18,001
Whew.
Are you all right?

915
00:59:18,084 --> 00:59:20,053
Wh-wha...?

916
00:59:20,053 --> 00:59:22,555
Master, you saved us!

917
00:59:22,555 --> 00:59:25,058
That ya did, matey.

918
00:59:25,058 --> 00:59:27,560
(gasps)

919
00:59:28,061 --> 00:59:31,064
Baby, you're the greatest.

920
00:59:31,064 --> 00:59:33,566
Mmwah!

921
00:59:59,592 --> 01:00:01,094
Who's there?

922
01:00:05,098 --> 01:00:08,101
The Pagemaster.

923
01:00:08,101 --> 01:00:11,104
Hey! How'd you get here?

924
01:00:11,304 --> 01:00:15,308
Quit it! We're in
the presence of
the Pagemaster.

925
01:00:15,808 --> 01:00:19,812
I know who he is!
He's the guy who did
all this to me!

926
01:00:19,812 --> 01:00:22,815
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

927
01:00:22,815 --> 01:00:24,317
Tell me.

928
01:00:24,317 --> 01:00:28,321
I was nearly torn apart
by a crazy doctor.

929
01:00:28,321 --> 01:00:31,324
I was made a slave by
a bunch of mangy pirates

930
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:33,326
and eaten -- got that?

931
01:00:33,326 --> 01:00:35,828
Eaten by
a fire-breathing dragon.

932
01:00:36,295 --> 01:00:40,299
He don't mean it,
my Pagemaster.
He don't mean it.

933
01:00:40,299 --> 01:00:46,339
Not to mention being
tossed, squashed and scared
practically to death.

934
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,809
Yet you stand before me.

935
01:00:49,809 --> 01:00:53,846
Well... yeah.

936
01:00:53,846 --> 01:00:57,850
Think, boy! What kind of
an adventure would you have had

937
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:01,237
if I brought you here
with a turn of a page?

938
01:01:01,237 --> 01:01:04,273
(cackling)

939
01:01:04,273 --> 01:01:05,358
(all gasp)

940
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:08,361
(laughing)

941
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:10,863
You prevailed over evil.

942
01:01:13,866 --> 01:01:17,370
Ah, you looked Moby Dick
in the eye, boy.

943
01:01:19,872 --> 01:01:26,879
Ah, you had pirates tough,
me lad, and don't no one
speak any different.

944
01:01:27,046 --> 01:01:29,382
If I had brought you
here from the start,

945
01:01:29,382 --> 01:01:33,386
you never would have
found the courage
to face your own fears.

946
01:01:38,391 --> 01:01:42,395
(roars)

947
01:01:42,395 --> 01:01:48,401
And in doing so,
you triumph here and always.

948
01:01:52,905 --> 01:01:55,408
Hey, is that... That's me!

949
01:01:55,408 --> 01:01:58,411
That was you.

950
01:01:58,577 --> 01:02:00,913
I'm ready to go home now.

951
01:02:00,913 --> 01:02:02,415
(sighs)

952
01:02:03,916 --> 01:02:06,919
I mean, we're ready.

953
01:02:10,923 --> 01:02:12,925
The world awaits.

954
01:02:12,925 --> 01:02:14,427
Whoa!

955
01:02:14,427 --> 01:02:16,429
Godspeed to you, boy!

956
01:02:16,929 --> 01:02:18,931
Wait for me!

957
01:02:20,933 --> 01:02:23,436
(yelling)

958
01:02:32,945 --> 01:02:34,447
Aah!

959
01:02:56,469 --> 01:02:58,971
(Pagemaster's voice)
You took quite a spill,
young man.

960
01:02:58,971 --> 01:03:01,974
Huh?

961
01:03:03,476 --> 01:03:05,478
Are you all right?

962
01:03:15,654 --> 01:03:17,490
Careful!
You'll slip again!

963
01:03:21,494 --> 01:03:24,497
Hey, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

964
01:03:24,497 --> 01:03:26,999
Wait! Uh, I forgot
something.

965
01:03:26,999 --> 01:03:29,502
Here.

966
01:03:33,005 --> 01:03:36,509
I'm afraid you can
only check out two.

967
01:03:37,843 --> 01:03:40,513
Horror? But I promised him.

968
01:03:40,513 --> 01:03:44,016
You promised whom?

969
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:48,020
Look, I need...
Just this once?

970
01:03:48,487 --> 01:03:49,522
Shh.

971
01:03:50,022 --> 01:03:53,526
(whispering) I have
a talent for guessing
what people need.

972
01:03:55,661 --> 01:03:57,530
Just this once.

973
01:04:00,165 --> 01:04:01,534
Shh.

974
01:04:53,218 --> 01:04:55,087
Yes!

975
01:05:00,593 --> 01:05:04,096
Good. That was definitely good.

976
01:05:07,566 --> 01:05:10,102
(Claire) I can't imagine
where he could be.

977
01:05:10,102 --> 01:05:12,104
Maybe we should
call the police.

978
01:05:12,104 --> 01:05:13,606
(gasps) Alan!

979
01:05:16,609 --> 01:05:18,110
He's home.

980
01:05:22,615 --> 01:05:24,617
Alan.

981
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:26,619
It's impossible.

982
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:30,122
(owl hooting)

983
01:05:35,628 --> 01:05:37,129
Rich?

984
01:05:49,642 --> 01:05:51,644
We probably should
put him in his bed.

985
01:05:51,644 --> 01:05:54,146
Let's let him sleep
up here tonight.

986
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:10,162
Love you, Richie.

987
01:06:25,678 --> 01:06:27,179
Good night, son.

988
01:06:39,191 --> 01:06:43,696
(Horror) It's dark out here.
I wish there was a night-light.

989
01:06:44,196 --> 01:06:46,699
(Fantasy) Honey,
wish granted.

990
01:06:46,699 --> 01:06:49,201
(gasps) Ooh.

991
01:06:49,701 --> 01:06:52,203
(laughing)

992
01:06:52,203 --> 01:06:54,205
Hooray! Hooray!

993
01:06:54,706 --> 01:06:55,707
(breathes deeply)

994
01:06:56,207 --> 01:06:58,710
