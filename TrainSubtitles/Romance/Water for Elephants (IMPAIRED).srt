there is no mistake, Mr. Jankowski.

The house and all their assets,
including your father's practice,

116
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,076
are property of the bank

to college, you'd still have a home.

But in light of the way your father
ran his business, that's unlikely.

My father was a good man.

And when people came to him for help,
he gave it.

126
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,430
Your father was an irresponsible man

who let people pay him
in chickens, and eggs,

There were a lot of men in those days

that there were jobs in the cities,

You seen our show?

319
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,714
Yes, sir.

320
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,796
Yeah? What's your favorite act?

321
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,798
I like the one
with the black and white horses.

322
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,719
You've got a good eye. My star attraction.

323

Well, I do believe we're looking for a boy

324
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,111
to carry water for the elephants.
Aren't we, Joe?

325
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,753
We don't have any elephants.

326
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,551

Yes, sir.

Why would a college boy
dirty his hands as a filthy roustabout?

331
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,993
I guess because
out of all that dirt and sweat,

332
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,829
working with these fellows you wouldn't
be caught dead in the daylight with,

333
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,393
comes so much beauty.

334

335
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,959
No. No, sir.

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,479
That was beautifully put.

337

Yet you ride my train,
you eat my food without my permission

338

while hard-working men labor all day
for the same privileges.

339
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,633
And these filthy roustabouts are my family.
You, you are an intruder.

340

-Probably studied poetry.
-(MEN LAUGHING)

342
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,830
I studied veterinary science, not poetry.

343
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,077
And I can tell you one thing.
That star attraction horse of yours?

344
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,078
It's not gonna be walking
in a few weeks, let alone performing.

345

-Cornell.

You're a Cornell graduate?

349
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,239
He did work the rubes for me
this afternoon. He was pretty good.

350
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,035

351

357
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,431
My star attraction is limping,

358
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,755
and I can't get a new liberty horse
midseason.

359
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,829
So you make sure the horse performs,
and the job is yours. Nine bucks a week.

360

370

Ivy League, no less,

372
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,876

in my estimation than you.

to offer him your cot.

-Yeah. Studied at Cornell University.

-It's an abscess.
-Darling.

You need a hoof tester?

No, I don't think so.

386

then it needs a salt wrap.

I didn't want to say anything
in front of Mrs. Rosenbluth.

394
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,398

English.

396
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,511
The connective tissue between the hoof
and the coffin bone has been compromised.

397
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,553
So when he walks, the coffin bone
rotates toward the sole of the hoof

398
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,749
until it punctures through.

399
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,349
But it hasn't punctured yet.

400
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,950
No, it hasn't, but it's just a matter of time.

401
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,069
And he's in a lot of pain.

403
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,389

No. It's pretty severe.

It's nothing really to worry about.

I'll be sorry to see you go.

479
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,755
Roll over. Turn around.

480
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,314

(JACOB GRUNTING)

483
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,116
This circus, my circus,
is a sovereign nation.

484
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,312
You break my law,
you have to pay a penalty.

485
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,476
I tell you to fix a horse, you shoot it?

486
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,239
That's breaking my law.
The penalty is red-lighting.

487
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,318
You need to get off the train.
Except we don't stop the train.

488
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,431
There's a chance you might survive,
although unlikely.

489
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,394
-Mr. Rosenbluth, just let me explain.
-No, no. No need!

490
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,193
You took initiative. I respect that.

491
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,675
But I'm a law-abiding man. Toss him.

492
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,073
-Wait!
-On three.

493
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,758
No, wait! No, no, no!

494
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,352
-MEN: One. Two.
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

495
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,799
Three!

496
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,239
The only reason you're not a permanent
part of this landscape right now

497
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,749
is because you probably saved
my Marlena from injury,

498
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,269
and you solved a great problem for me.

499
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,437
You saw what we fed the cats.
It wasn't right, was it?

500
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,879
But now because of you,

501
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,639
Silver Star will make sure
the cats will eat good fresh meat

502
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,193
until we can sell some tickets.

503
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,673
But you killed my star act,

504
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,189
so if we don't sell the tickets
and the men aren't paid,

505
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,278
they're going to be looking
for someone to blame.

506
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,356
Welcome to the circus, Cornell.

507
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,513
JACOB: We had to cancel shows
in three towns.

508
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,350
The rumor was, four men got tossed
to save money. And we might go belly up.

509
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,391
Dead circuses were common in '31.

510
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,511
Men tired of being mistreated
would mutiny,

511
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,393
or bosses would see the end coming
and pull a runner with all the money,

512
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,274
leaving a mess of animals and acts
like bones to be picked over.

513
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,680
Luckily, we found one in Goshen.

514
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,473
And August could get any act for a song.

515
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,309
The rest of them knew
they'd never work another show again.

516
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,558
When I saw their faces,
I thought to myself, August was right.

517
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,750
I'd never seen men hungry.

518
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,553
Darling! One second, please.

519
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,035
Erwin, over here. Joe, pour the champagne.

520
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,274
I want you all to experience
the earthquake impact

521
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,628
of what I'm about to show you.

522
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,833
I've made an acquisition that will make
Benzini Brothers a top-drawer tour.

523
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,712
-Darling.
-Yes.

524
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,159
I know I could never truly replace
Silver Star for you,

525
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,032
but I hope you'll give me a chance to try.

526
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,878
Oh, August, you didn't need to do that.

527
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,194
Joe, the doors?

528
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,915
Children, meet our salvation!

529
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,034
We got ourselves a guaranteed
sell-out, crowd-cheering bull!

530
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,470
Her name is Rosie,
she's 53, and she's brilliant.

531
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,238
What's that in her mouth?

532
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,715
She ran off.
They found her eating a cemetery plot.

533
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,389
I'm going to come up with a whole new
star act around you and her.

534
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,479
Darling, I'm not getting up on that.
I've never ridden an elephant in my life!

535
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,910
You didn't know how to stand on top
of a galloping horse until I showed you.

536
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,589
You're a fast learner.
This act will go through the roof!

are we gonna put it?

-We'll make room.
-How are we gonna pay for it?

539
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,273
I won't pay the men for a few weeks.
We've done it before.

540
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,355
Once we start selling out,

541
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,995
the men will have more cash
than they know what to do with.

542
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,997
She's gonna pack them in. I know it!

543
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,438
You the bull man?

544
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,959
He's my menagerie man.

545
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,991
You ain't got no bull man,
I gotta tell the township,

546
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,190
or else I can't sell her to you.

547
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,357
Well, I'm the bull man.

548
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,711
Well, speak up! I ain't got all day.

549

This here is the stupidest goddamn
animal on the face of God's good earth.

551

Here's your bull hook.
You're going to need it.

Good luck to you.

Maybe you should take care of that.

When I started with Benzini,
this show was nothing but grift.

A man couldn't walk
a straight line through the midway

without getting his pocket picked
half a dozen times.

Benzini was a cheap bastard.
He didn't invest a dime in new acts.

612
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,199
So when he pulled a runner,
everybody thought we were belly-up.

-And you were 19, right, darling?
-Uh-huh.

615
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,790
And August got rid of all
the pickpockets and the grift barkers,

616
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,559
and he sold off two deadbeat clowns
and a train car

617
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,353

00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,431
August taught me everything I know.

629
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,438
And he told me that one day
we'd be as big as Ringling Brothers.

630
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,437
Yeah.

631
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,438
Those damn brothers
had a stroke of genius.

632
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,109
They sold families the idea they wanted
a show their mother and sisters could see.

No sex, no grift. Safe for the kids.

But we're on our way.

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,396
Yeah, this bull?
This bull has got to be spectacular!

637
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,275
I take care of the spectacle. Now
I need someone to take care of the bull.

638
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,436
August wants you to be the bull man.

639
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,154
You'll have full charge of training Rosie.
With a raise.

640
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,669
Modest raise. You'll hardly notice it.

641
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,199
I don't know anything about elephants.

642
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,595
I'm going to tell him the truth.

643
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,556
Some outfit will be feeding off our carcass
if we don't bring in the people.

644
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:35,550
And I mean crowds falling over their feet
to get inside our big top.

645
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,673
This bull has got to work, Jacob.
She's got to.

646
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,596
I need to tell you something.

647
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,829
I'm not sure you'll trust me
after you hear it.

648
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,190
I never finished Cornell.

649
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,395
I'm not a real vet.

650
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,951
I didn't get my degree. I'm not licensed.

651

weighs 800 pounds?

She's 400 at the tops.

655
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,552
Do you think the Tattooed Woman
was tattooed by headhunters in Borneo?

656
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,477
MARLENA: She's from Pittsburgh!

657
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,718
It took her nine years to ink herself.
Tell him about the hippo, darling.

658
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,310
When she died, we swapped out her water
for formaldehyde, kept showing her.

659
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,193
For two weeks
we traveled with a pickled hippo!

something no degree can give you...
You have such a talent.

664
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,277
You knew with one look about Silver Star.

665

You must learn, my dear boy,

666
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,799
that the rules of these United States
of Suckers do not apply to us.

and clear the place out.

In fact, it gave me an idea for the show.

1137

A first dance. Two characters.

1140
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:56,077
A young awkward man, hopelessly in love
with a woman beyond his reach,

who teases his affections.

that sweeps them onto the dance floor.

He wraps his arms around her.

-August...
-Look at him!

She touches his cheek.

1152
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,717
And gently runs her hand down his neck,

1153
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,479
playing with his hair.

1154

Never leaving his eyes.
Never leaving his eyes.

Making him believe she's his.

1156
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,195
He slides his hand lower

1157
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,033
and lower, below her waist.

1158
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:12,631
But she slaps his wrist

1159

as if to protect her honor
against this rude Lothario.

tell me to fire him.

and they found Walter and Camel.

1265
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,997
They had hit the rocks.

1266
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:18,795
They didn't make it.

1267
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,397
Wade and Grady
are gonna take August down.

1268
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:27,193
I don't know how,
but you have to get out of here.

1269
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:30,232
I'll stay hidden until the matinee starts.

1270
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:33,352
Then I'll make my way to town.
There's got to be a church or something.

1271
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:35,596
There is.

1272
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:39,998
You do the Spec, but when the show starts,
come and meet me.

1273
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:42,236
August won't know you're gone
until the second act.

1274
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:44,396
-So we'll get a head start.
-I have to go.

1275
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:47,432
Marlena, just promise me you'll come.

1276
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:51,359
Or I'll come back for you. I swear it.

1277
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:54,193
I'll be there.

1278
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:01,715
I love you.

JACOB: The official report said
August had been trampled to death.

1316
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:28,839
Blackie was never seen again after Wade
and Grady dragged him out of that tent.

1317
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:31,838
And no one was charged with
letting the animals out of those cages.

1318
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:34,633
To the police, it could have been anyone.

1319
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:48,391
Benzini Brothers was officially belly up,
property of Altoona, Pennsylvania.

1320
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:50,590
Shows on the road would get the scent
soon enough

1321
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,950
and come to pick off our bones.

1322
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:55,196
I wouldn't leave Rosie to that.

1323
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:58,710
I wasn't gonna let anybody touch her
with that hook again.

1324
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:01,434
So like I planned, I took my finals.

1325
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:04,472
OLD JACOB: And with my degree,
our animals, and Marlena 's act,

1326
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:06,431
Ringling got themselves a sweet deal.

1327
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:07,913
A sweet deal.

1328
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,276
Our first son was born that season. Walter.

1329
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,436
He spent the first seven years
of his life with Ringling.

1330
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:17,915
That's why I cannot

1331
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:21,919
understand how he could forget
to show up today.

1332
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,791
There was a circus in town!

1333
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:29,596
By the time our third son came,
we'd had enough. Rosie was tired.

1334
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:34,430
Luckily, the vet at the Albany Zoo
dropped dead, so I got the job.

1335
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:38,314
We bought some property
so we could keep the horses, Rosie,

1336
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:40,715
and then five kids.

1337
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:44,596
Oh, before you know it, the kids
are borrowing the car and moving out.

1338
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:48,872
So then it was just Rosie and us.

1339
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,956
When Rosie passed on,

1340
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:56,879
Marlena cried for days.

1341
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:02,155
We owed Rosie our whole lives.

1342
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:04,992
And Marlena?

1343
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,630
My Marlena died in her bed.

1344
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:15,917
Still beautiful, though.

1345
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,434
We had a lot of years, though.

1346
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:32,792
I don't know how I did it, but I managed
to give her everything I promised.

1347
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:35,718
And, boy, that was the life!

1348
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:38,553
(CHUCKLING) Boy, I'm telling you!

1349
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,358
Are you hiring me?

1350
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:50,109
I don't know. What about your health?

1351
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:53,437
There's nothing wrong with me.
I'm just old.

1352
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:55,790
Work is the best thing for age.

1353
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,480
A man like me
ought to be working the ticket wicket,

1354
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:02,229
not some kid ringed up like a sideshow act.

1355
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:06,512
And if you don't think I'm carrying
my weight, you can call the home.

1356
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:08,232
I won't argue.

1357
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:11,358
You won't be sorry.

1358
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,793
Yeah, we'll get you in the record books.

1359
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,876
"Oldest man that ever ran away
with the circus."

(LAUGHS)

1361
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:21,357
I'm not running away.

1362
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:25,038
I'm coming home.

1363
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:32,874
