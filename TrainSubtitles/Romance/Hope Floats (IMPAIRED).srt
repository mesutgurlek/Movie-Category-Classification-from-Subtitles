Yes, sir. She sure is.

That's my daughter, Birdee.

She's marked for happiness.

And how do you know that?

Your mom called a while ago.

01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,119
She said she'd be home soon.

1253

Do you want me to tuck you in?

1254
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,124
Yeah? How tight?

1255
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:38,794
Tight.
Okay.

Snug as a bug in a rug.

You're so much like your mama.
She use to love me to tuck her in real tight.

1258
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:52,016
I'm not like her.

1259
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:55,519
We're different.
It's like we're not even relatives.

Relatives are trouble.
I couldn't agree more.

1263
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:10,534
I ever tell you about Walter,
my brother? No?

1264
01:28:11,328 --> 01:28:13,704
Well, what you have to go through
with your mama...

1265
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:16,958
...the suffering,
that's what l had to suffer with Walter.

1266
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:20,670
One day, we were playing out back,
down by the river...

1267
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:26,467
...and we came across
the most beautiful anthill you ever saw.

1268
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:30,721
And then Walter, he immediately kicked it
and stomped on it...

1269
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:33,766
...and just scattered it
to the four winds.

1270
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:36,727
I just started howling. I was just--

1271
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:39,355
I yelled for my mama.
I ran up and I grabbed her...

1272
01:28:39,523 --> 01:28:42,733
...and dragged her down there,
just crying and carrying on.

1273
01:28:43,193 --> 01:28:47,029
Anyway, my mama was trying to
calm me down, so she said:

1274
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:51,492
"Wait, wait. They're not finished.
Not by a long shot."

1275
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:55,371
And we waited and waited
and sure enough...

1276
01:28:55,539 --> 01:29:00,876
...those little black specks just started
scurrying every which way...

1277
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:04,839
...just working hard to build
their home back.

1278
01:29:05,007 --> 01:29:09,802
And l said, "Why did they do it?
I'd just give up. I mean, it's hopeless."

1279
01:29:10,721 --> 01:29:15,141
And my mama said, "Yeah, you know,
if there's just one of you.

1280
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:17,476
But there's lots of ants down there.

1281
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:22,440
And they're all relatives.
They're family, just like we are."

1282
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:28,362
Well, that's what families are for.
That's why they invented families.

1283
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:32,033
So hopeless didn't get the last word.

1284
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,703
So listen, if ants can do it,
I figure we can do it.
