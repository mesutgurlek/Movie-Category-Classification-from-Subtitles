1
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:31,242
Raphael, stop running, you'll fall.
We're a long way from the car!

2
00:00:35,038 --> 00:00:36,247
Pretty, isn't it?

3
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:38,416
It all seems so complicated.

4
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,710
You'll see.
This will change our lives.

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,836
If you say so.

6
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:37,201
We'll be happy in Cassis.

7
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,371
- We're not in Salon-de-Provence?
- Sure.

8
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:43,207
But we'll have the seashore!

9
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:47,545
- Don't, it's dangerous.
- I have an earplug.

10
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:49,088
Here I am. Hello?

11
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:54,427
Jean! Funny you should call.
We're just leaviing Cassis.

12
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:55,845
Not good news

13
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:57,597
about the transfer...

14
00:02:57,847 --> 00:02:59,265
I'll call you back.

15
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:01,100
What's going on?

16
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:03,811
- No need to quit your job.
- What?

17
00:03:04,228 --> 00:03:06,189
My transfer was denied.

18
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:09,817
No need to get upset.

19
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:12,570
I'm not upset. Do I seem upset?

20
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:15,823
Then stop saying that. Shit!

21
00:03:19,494 --> 00:03:20,328
Everything OK?.

22
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:25,875
I understand.
Just see what you can do.

23
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,418
Thanks again, Jean.

24
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:33,216
Why do you thank him?
The strings he pulled didn't help.

25
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:37,887
Not his fault. The handicapped
come before string-pullers.

26
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:40,348
The Riviiera is handicapped only?.

27
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,849
Of course not.

28
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,394
I was so happy to move.

29
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:45,853
You were tired of the idea.

30
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:48,272
Because I knew we were moviing.

31
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:51,067
Now that I know we're not,
I feel we missed out.

32
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:53,820
- This summer...
- No! The hell with vacation!

33
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:57,991
You said we'd move to the shore.
You worked so hard I never saw you.

34
00:03:58,282 --> 00:04:00,368
I want to live there,
Philippe Abrams!

35
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,911
Yes, darling.

36
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:03,788
- Are you upset?
- Yes, so?

37
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:05,790
Don't be. It won't help.

38
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,669
Why are you always against me?

39
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:35,778
You're crazy to come here!

40
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:39,824
Anybody follow you?

41
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:42,410
Were you seen entering?

42
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:45,496
You didn't talk to anyone?

43
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:47,665
Come on,
we work for the post office.

44
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:49,083
Quiet, my neck is on the line!

45
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:51,377
No it's not. I didn't get the job.

46
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:54,297
I'm an executive,
1 1 years busting my ass in Salon!

47
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:56,924
If you shout, I'm done for.

48
00:04:57,216 --> 00:04:59,636
I earned that transfer,
handicapped or not.

49
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,471
I'll reimburse you.

50
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:03,973
Find me a spot.
Julie's giviing me hell.

51
00:05:07,518 --> 00:05:11,939
In Sanary-On-The-Sea,
the director's retiring in a few weeks.

52
00:05:12,607 --> 00:05:14,359
Perfect. I must have it.

53
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:16,861
Keep your damn voice down.

54
00:05:19,822 --> 00:05:21,282
- There.
- There what?

55
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:24,202
Yes?

56
00:05:24,786 --> 00:05:25,662
No, I'm not busy.

57
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:26,954
The boss wants you.

58
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:28,414
Oh. Why?.

59
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:30,958
I don't know. You're busy?

60
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:32,585
Be right there.

61
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:37,840
Don't leave with me.

62
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:40,051
Say I'm handicapped on the request.

63
00:05:40,677 --> 00:05:41,386
Are you insane?

64
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:44,347
Why not? A mistake on a form.
What's the risk?.

65
00:05:44,597 --> 00:05:46,557
Big! Big risk!

66
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:50,853
If they find out, you're in trouble.
But I'm dead.

67
00:05:58,486 --> 00:05:59,278
One moment.

68
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,950
Thank you for coming, Doctor.

69
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,035
- Doctor?.
- No, I'm not taking sick leave.

70
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:07,704
It's very minor.

71
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:09,455
Goodbye, Doctor.

72
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:39,527
Julie!

73
00:06:49,412 --> 00:06:50,371
To Sanary!

74
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:53,333
Thanks. You still have me for 2 days.

75
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:56,002
Excuse me, sir.
An inspector wants to see you.

76
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:57,545
What inspector?.

77
00:06:57,837 --> 00:06:59,589
It's about your transfer.

78
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:01,049
- Where is he?
- In the lobby.

79
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,134
Stall him for five minutes!

80
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:12,101
Shit.

81
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,620
I should have tried it out!

82
00:07:45,718 --> 00:07:47,053
I'm Philippe Abrams.

83
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:51,432
Name's Lebic. Just a few questions
about your transfer request.

84
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:52,850
Of course.

85
00:07:58,564 --> 00:07:59,941
Those brats.

86
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:04,237
School kids slashed my tires.
I won't miss them.

87
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:06,906
- Need help?
- I must do it myself.

88
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:11,119
Sit down. I already am.

89
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:14,664
What can I do for you?

90
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:18,126
How long have you been
handicapped, Mr. Abrams?

91
00:08:19,502 --> 00:08:21,921
It's hard for me to remember.

92
00:08:22,797 --> 00:08:25,091
I was little. It's all a blur.

93
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,469
Reliviing it is traumatic.

94
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:32,724
Sorry.

95
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:34,892
Muscle spasms.

96
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,690
It's over. I'm fine.

97
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:48,072
Mr. Abrams. I have
two transfer requests in your name.

98
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:51,576
One, recently,
for a limited-mobility person,

99
00:08:51,826 --> 00:08:52,910
for the Sanary spot.

100
00:08:53,161 --> 00:08:56,289
The other, for Cassis,
6 months ago. No handicap.

101
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:59,250
Did you make both requests?

102
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,632
I made both requests.

103
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:08,426
Yes.

104
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:10,678
The first,

105
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:12,639
as non-handicapped,

106
00:09:12,972 --> 00:09:15,558
because I wanted to be
treated as normal.

107
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,310
Like anyone else.

108
00:09:17,894 --> 00:09:18,936
It's important to us,

109
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:20,647
the handicapped,

110
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:26,235
to be seen by people like you
as deserviing more than pity.

111
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:29,197
That's very laudable.

112
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:33,034
Of course,
if my transfer depends on it...

113
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:34,369
No, not at all.

114
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:37,538
This is just
an obligatory verification.

115
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:41,250
You know, I often
get false declarations

116
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:44,337
in requests for sought-after posts,
like the Riviiera.

117
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,255
- No!
- It's rampant.

118
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:48,633
How shameful!

119
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:50,677
You can say that again.

120
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:53,846
You'll love Sanary.

121
00:09:55,723 --> 00:09:57,433
I won't bother you anymore.

122
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,394
Not at all.
Goodbye, Mr. Lebic.

123
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:03,564
How shameful.

124
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:08,820
Nut job.

125
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:10,780
You're a total nut job.

126
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:15,410
You're my friend.
You'll fix this.

127
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,203
I'll fix nothing.

128
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,456
Don't you dare say we're friends.
Not here.

129
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:23,501
Not a handicap imposter.

130
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:27,964
I only did it for Julie.
I'm terribly sorry.

131
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:31,384
All right.

132
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:34,053
Good news and bad news.

133
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:35,513
I've been suspended?

134
00:10:36,681 --> 00:10:37,265
Worse.

135
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:38,641
Fired?

136
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,684
Worse.

137
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:42,395
- Worse than fired?
- Transferred up north.

138
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:44,188
North? Not Lyons!

139
00:10:44,564 --> 00:10:47,025
No, not Lyons. The north north.

140
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:49,235
Not Paris. Don't tell me.

141
00:10:49,902 --> 00:10:51,029
Not Paris.

142
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:52,488
Farther north.

143
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,573
Belgium?

144
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:56,159
No. Before Belgium, there's...

145
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:58,077
The North region. Near Lille.

146
00:10:58,369 --> 00:10:59,662
Little what?

147
00:10:59,954 --> 00:11:01,831
No! The city of Lille.

148
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:03,249
Lille? That's horrible.

149
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,251
Starts next Monday.

150
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,753
This coming Monday?.

151
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:10,923
I can't. I have no warm clothes.
No place to live.

152
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:14,510
There's an apartment
for the local manager.

153
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:16,804
What's the place?

154
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:18,222
Bergues.

155
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:22,435
I'll refuse it.

156
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:24,103
Can't. It's disciplinary.

157
00:11:26,272 --> 00:11:27,315
What's the good news?

158
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,067
That was it.

159
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:31,736
What's the bad news?

160
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:32,945
You stay there 2 years.

161
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:37,492
- Two years?
- Minimum.

162
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,327
Two years in the north. No!

163
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:42,622
It's the north or you're fired. Sorry.

164
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:45,458
How can I tell Julie?
She thinks it's Sanary.

165
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,253
You leave when the coast is clear.

166
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:57,345
Now!

167
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,062
Hi, honey.

168
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:12,527
I'm looking at apartments
in Sanary. Great.

169
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:14,070
We must hurry.

170
00:12:14,362 --> 00:12:15,446
Don't worry, it's off.

171
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:16,906
It fell through.

172
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:18,616
Another handicapped guy?.

173
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,493
Sort of.

174
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:22,495
- I can't believe it.
- Hang on.

175
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:24,706
They offered better.

176
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:27,583
You scared me. Where?

177
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:30,753
- Bergues.
- Where?

178
00:12:31,713 --> 00:12:32,797
Beautiful Bergues.

179
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,801
In the north.
Isn't that wonderful?

180
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:38,845
What did you do?

181
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:40,096
Me? Nothing.

182
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:41,556
I'm not an idiot.

183
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:45,226
If you do well, you stay south.
You must've screwed up big-time.

184
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,603
No, it's just the opposite.

185
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:50,398
They offered me 2 years up north.
I earn points,

186
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:53,067
get priority
for all the Riviiera jobs.

187
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:56,446
In terms of index,
after 2 years in the north,

188
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:58,156
it's like I'm handicapped!

189
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:00,533
Turn it down. I won't freeze.

190
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:03,953
Who's going to freeze?
We're not liviing outdoors up there.

191
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:04,912
Dad,

192
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:06,247
I'll lose my toes.

193
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:07,582
Why would you?

194
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:08,958
Not the North Pole.

195
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:11,627
Not the North Pole. The north!

196
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,755
The truth. What did you do?

197
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:16,549
I got a great promotion.
I don't get this.

198
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:18,635
I'll call Jean.

199
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:24,891
To get the Sanary job,
I said I was handicapped.

200
00:13:25,183 --> 00:13:26,809
You pretended you were handicapped?

201
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:27,977
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:30,104
Go to the North Pole alone!

203
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:07,725
What is it?

204
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:12,689
Recognize me?
I married Julie, your niece.

205
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:18,027
Right, she said you'd come bug me.
What do you want?

206
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,159
I have to go to the North region.

207
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:26,327
A transfer.

208
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:28,705
Julie said you know
the area near Lille.

209
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:34,377
In 1934, my mother
slept with a Sheutemi.

210
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:35,920
What?

211
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,256
I said, in 1934,

212
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:41,342
my mother slept with a Sheutemi.

213
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:42,468
A shut-in?

214
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,470
Not a shut-in!

215
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:46,014
A Sheutemi.

216
00:14:46,264 --> 00:14:51,060
That's what they call people up there.
Men, women, children! Sheutemi!

217
00:14:51,644 --> 00:14:52,645
Shutemies?

218
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:56,316
Even animals are Sheutemi! Dogs...

219
00:14:56,774 --> 00:14:59,652
Cats are sheutemi.

220
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:03,156
Cows, chickens, calves
are all sheutemi.

221
00:15:03,614 --> 00:15:04,949
And the language is sheutemi, too.

222
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,618
They say O instead of A,

223
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:10,997
SHKA instead of SH,
and they say SH...

224
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:13,708
but instead of S.
They're crackpots!

225
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,128
Just when you think you got it,

226
00:15:17,378 --> 00:15:21,174
they tell you a "mop"
is a wassingue!

227
00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:27,055
And what's life like there?

228
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,389
Pretty easy?.

229
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:31,225
Rough! Very rough!

230
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:34,520
Only the ones in coal
live well.

231
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:37,273
The others are just...

232
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:39,525
miserable.

233
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:42,445
They die very young there.

234
00:15:42,695 --> 00:15:45,365
Good thing my mother
came back south.

235
00:15:45,782 --> 00:15:49,243
I was ten.
I couldn't stand the cold.

236
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:51,204
It's cold up there?

237
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,833
Summer's all right.
About thirty degrees.

238
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,128
But in winter it goes
down, down, down.

239
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:02,507
Twenty, zero, minus twenty!
Minus fifty!

240
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:06,219
You figure you'll stay in bed.
It goes to minus 60!

241
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:07,553
Minus 60?

242
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:09,555
The north!

243
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:12,684
You asked, kid.

244
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:14,978
It's the north.

245
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:17,522
Got your answer?.

246
00:16:18,856 --> 00:16:20,066
Good.

247
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,140
See? Freezing fog.

248
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,767
- What's freezing fog?
- A horror.

249
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:59,397
Look. 40 in the morning,
fifty at midday. Not that cold!

250
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:01,441
Think those are real?

251
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:03,526
Aren't they?.

252
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:08,156
Open your eyes. Regional officials
pressure the weather serviice.

253
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:10,825
- Or no one would go there.
- Think so?

254
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:13,911
Freezing fog.

255
00:17:16,956 --> 00:17:18,082
Bergues.

256
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,834
Probably not in there.

257
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:21,794
Calculating route.

258
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:22,795
It is.

259
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:25,131
Shut up, bitch.

260
00:17:37,602 --> 00:17:39,604
I can't go.
I'm not strong enough.

261
00:17:40,063 --> 00:17:42,357
You're better off here,
with the boy.

262
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:44,734
Don't take that off.

263
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:47,278
I'll be too hot on the way up.

264
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:49,947
Better you get used to wearing it.

265
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,082
Raphael,

266
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:00,750
take care of Mom.

267
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:02,085
- I'm counting on you.
- OK, Dad.

268
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:18,810
All this is my fault.

269
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,270
No, Julie. It's destiny.

270
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:23,690
I'll call you when I get to...

271
00:18:24,732 --> 00:18:26,234
the North region.

272
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:53,094
Hello, Mr. Bailleul?

273
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,721
Philippe Abrams.

274
00:18:54,971 --> 00:18:57,015
Your new manager.

275
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:00,393
I'll arrive this evening.

276
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:02,562
Meet you at City Hall.

277
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:05,398
Can't hear you. Bad connection.

278
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:07,692
See you tonight.

279
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:17,035
With the North Sea

280
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:20,163
to wave our last goodbye,

281
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,168
and waves of dunes
to hold back the waves

282
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:28,713
and the backs of rocks
drowned by the tide,

283
00:19:29,964 --> 00:19:34,594
sunken is the heart
when the tide is low...

284
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:40,475
Shit!

285
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:55,698
Police. License and registration.

286
00:19:56,532 --> 00:20:00,203
Sorry, I was speeding.
I was preoccupied.

287
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:02,580
I know I'm in the wrong.

288
00:20:02,872 --> 00:20:04,415
You were doing thirty.

289
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:05,416
A hundred thirty?.

290
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,585
No, 30. 15 times 2.

291
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:10,004
30? Is that possible?

292
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:13,591
It's dangerous to drive slow
on the highway, Mr. Abrams.

293
00:20:14,884 --> 00:20:16,302
I'm writing you up.

294
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:22,141
I've been transferred to the north
so I'm in no hurry.

295
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:23,559
The North region?

296
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,315
Go ahead.

297
00:20:30,024 --> 00:20:30,984
Thanks.

298
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:33,152
But step on it a little.

299
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:35,947
Be brave.

300
00:20:36,864 --> 00:20:37,782
Jacques!

301
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,126
Oh fuck.

302
00:20:48,376 --> 00:20:50,044
The North region.

303
00:20:59,137 --> 00:21:00,805
WELCOME TO THE NORTH

304
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:21,951
You've reached your destination.

305
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,001
No, it can't be.

306
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:52,982
My God! You're not dead?

307
00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:55,693
Welcome, Mr. Abrams.

308
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:56,611
Mr. Bailleul?

309
00:21:57,195 --> 00:21:58,404
Yesh, it'sh me.

310
00:21:59,155 --> 00:21:59,947
Oh, vandeus!

311
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:02,200
Don't move. Better call for help.

312
00:22:02,617 --> 00:22:03,660
I'm jusht fine.

313
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:05,244
I might have killed you!

314
00:22:05,536 --> 00:22:06,954
It'sh all right.

315
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:09,874
I shaw your lishensh plate.
From out of town.

316
00:22:10,124 --> 00:22:13,419
I waved to you to shtop.
You didn't she me. I'm OK.

317
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:14,837
Your jaw is hurt.

318
00:22:15,838 --> 00:22:17,799
- Huh?
- It hurts you to talk?.

319
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:19,050
Whot?

320
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:20,259
Your jaw OK?.

321
00:22:21,594 --> 00:22:24,806
No. My ash shmartsh.
I fell on my ash.

322
00:22:25,098 --> 00:22:28,518
Your "ash"? This isn't good.
Wouldn't you like to see a doctor?.

323
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:31,437
No, I shed I'm fine!

324
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:34,440
Listen, you're really talking funny.

325
00:22:34,732 --> 00:22:36,359
Cosh I talk shti?.

326
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:38,695
- Talk what?
- I talk shti, that'sh ole.

327
00:22:39,112 --> 00:22:40,905
You mean that's sheteumi?.

328
00:22:42,865 --> 00:22:46,244
Your plashe is upshtairsh.
Over the posht offish.

329
00:22:54,168 --> 00:22:55,420
Here we are.

330
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:01,134
Great.

In here.

332
00:23:12,979 --> 00:23:13,813

333
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:16,149
Good night, shir.

00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:18,109

335
00:23:18,568 --> 00:23:20,361
Tomorrow, right.

336
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:25,950
Bailleul, wait!

337
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,536
No furniture!

338
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:31,456
Where's the furniture?

339
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:33,041
I don't get it.

340
00:23:34,709 --> 00:23:35,877
Isn't it furnished?

341
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:38,171
The ex-manager took it.

342
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,839
Why?.

343
00:23:40,214 --> 00:23:41,424
For hish new offish?

344
00:23:43,718 --> 00:23:44,844
- What fish?
- The furniture.

345
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:46,262
I don't get it.

346
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:47,764
For hish new offish.

347
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:50,183
New fish?
Why would fish need furniture?

348
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:51,726
Why give it to fish?

349
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:54,896
Offish! He didn't give it to fishkas.
He took it with him.

350
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,981
Why give it away?.

351
00:23:57,273 --> 00:23:58,107
I never shed dish.

352
00:23:58,566 --> 00:23:59,942
Why dish? You said fish.

353
00:24:01,152 --> 00:24:02,528
You said for his new fish.

354
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,364
Oh, all right.

355
00:24:04,614 --> 00:24:05,865
I shed, hish new offish.

356
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:07,116
That's what I said.

357
00:24:07,408 --> 00:24:08,493
Hish offish.

358
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:12,580
His office! Not his fish.

359
00:24:12,872 --> 00:24:13,956
His offish. Dish ish it.

360
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:16,292
You all talk like that here?

361
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:19,921
Yesh. The Shti all shpeak Shti.
Shome shpeak Flemishka.

362
00:24:21,923 --> 00:24:23,007

363
00:24:24,092 --> 00:24:26,636
- What will you do?
- Take me to a hotel.

364
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,889
In Bergues, at this hour?.

00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:34,602
Dish ish my housh.

366
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:37,230
Doesn't even sound like language.

367
00:24:37,814 --> 00:24:38,815
Nothing.

368
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:41,985
Not very big,
but at least it's furnished.

369
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:51,494
Nice of you
to inviite me to sleep over.

370
00:24:51,744 --> 00:24:53,955
My pleashure. Hungry?. Thirshty?.

371
00:24:54,205 --> 00:24:56,874
No, I want to sleep.
It was a long trip.

372
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,711
Go right to bed then.
Upshtairsh.

373
00:25:06,384 --> 00:25:07,468
Are you married?

374
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:10,888
Married? Me? No chance.
Me and women...

375
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:16,811
You live alone?

376
00:25:17,061 --> 00:25:19,397
- It's my mom's housh.
- Your mom?

377
00:25:19,647 --> 00:25:21,607
That'sh her room. She's shleeping.

378
00:25:21,858 --> 00:25:23,568
Bathroom down the hall.

379
00:25:23,818 --> 00:25:25,194
That'sh the room.

380
00:25:30,992 --> 00:25:32,660
We can't make noishe.

381
00:25:33,202 --> 00:25:34,662

382

383

00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:01,230
I see.

385
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:04,442
You southerners like lavender.

386
00:26:06,152 --> 00:26:08,196
Clean sheets, lavender schent.

387
00:26:11,324 --> 00:26:13,326
It shmellsh sho good.

388
00:26:13,826 --> 00:26:14,827
Should we make your bed?

389
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,580
I'll manage on my own.

390
00:26:19,165 --> 00:26:19,916
Good night.

391
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:22,377
Sleep...

392
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:24,837

393
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:26,381
You...

395
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,455
That takesh the cake!

396
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:06,713
Mr. Abramsh, it'sh time.

Tiime to wake up.

398
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:13,636
You frightened me.

399
00:27:13,928 --> 00:27:15,221
You frightened me.

400
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:16,347
What do you want?

401
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:17,974
No, what do you want?

402
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:19,225
What do you mean?

403
00:27:19,684 --> 00:27:20,935
For breakfast.

404
00:27:22,353 --> 00:27:25,440
- What time is it?
- 7.:15. Almosht time for work.

405
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:27,233

Yesh. It'sh a housh,

407
00:27:31,112 --> 00:27:32,155

408
00:27:32,947 --> 00:27:34,240
No tea, only coffee.

409
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:36,492

- Only coffee.

410

Mom, I couldn't put him

00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,565
He'sh my new bosh.

Quit it, Mom.
She'sh kidding.

425
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:35,843
I'm not kidding. He'sh your bosh,

430
00:28:46,729 --> 00:28:47,939
Chicory!

431
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:51,234
Tashte it, before critishizing.

432
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,615
- Not good?
- Sure, very good.

433
00:29:09,293 --> 00:29:10,962
What's on the bread you dip?

434
00:29:11,254 --> 00:29:12,046
That?

435
00:29:12,714 --> 00:29:13,756
It'sh maroilles.

436
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:15,174
What's that?

437
00:29:15,758 --> 00:29:19,178
Cheese. A little shtrong.
Like vieux-Lille.

438
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:21,180
Want to tashte?

439
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,518
Not ash shtrong in the mouth
as in the shmell.

440
00:29:31,774 --> 00:29:32,984
Good, huh?

441
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:34,485
Just as strong inside.

442
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:38,239
That's why we dunk it in coffee.
Takes the edge off.

443
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:39,574
Dunk it.

444
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:41,367
I'd rather not.

445
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:50,251
Good, huh?

446
00:29:54,255 --> 00:29:55,715
Young man!

447
00:29:56,507 --> 00:29:58,134
A brown sugar faluche.

448
00:29:58,384 --> 00:30:00,678
You hardly ate.

449
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,311
Thank you.

450
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:09,979
It's about time!

451
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:11,856
My shon, my shon.

452
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:14,192
- See you tonight.
- Not too late!

453
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:16,944
Promish?

454
00:30:19,697 --> 00:30:22,659
- Your mom's unusual.
- Not to me.

455
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:24,035
Maroilles in this?

456
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:26,454
No, the shmell lingersh.

457
00:30:26,704 --> 00:30:27,997
Everything stinks.

458
00:30:28,247 --> 00:30:30,625
Breathe through your mouth,
air it out.

459
00:30:32,502 --> 00:30:34,045
That's maroilles.

460
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:41,844
Strange. It's not so cold.

461
00:30:42,095 --> 00:30:43,763
For April, it's warm.

462
00:30:44,013 --> 00:30:45,223
That's what I thought.

463
00:30:45,556 --> 00:30:47,392
Must be global warming.

464
00:30:47,725 --> 00:30:49,352
Used to be harsh, right?

465
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:53,231
In April, we used to shkate,
make shnowmen.

466
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:54,065
Really?.

467
00:30:54,315 --> 00:30:58,778
The besht part ushed to be
delivering mail by shled.

468
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:00,822
Are you putting me on?

469
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:03,658
- Just a little.
- It's not funny.

470
00:31:03,908 --> 00:31:06,160
Why come north
if you fear the cold?

471
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:08,287
- Hey, Antoine.
- Hey! Zounds!

472
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,623
Mr. Abrams, the new P.O. manager.

473
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,375
Mr. Zounds.

474
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:14,002
Mr. Zounds!

475
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:16,754
That's a good one.

476
00:31:17,588 --> 00:31:19,757
Don't laugh at my ignorance!

477
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:21,050
We didn't mean it.

478
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:24,595
So smug with that accent,
smelly cheese and red brick houses!

479
00:31:25,555 --> 00:31:27,056
We're sorry.

480
00:31:27,515 --> 00:31:28,641
Where are you going?

481
00:31:28,891 --> 00:31:31,477
To work.
Laugh with your friend.

482
00:31:39,902 --> 00:31:43,781
Mr. Abrams, let me introduce

No, from the south, with an S.
Never heard of the shouth.

00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:05,511
What'sh dish?

557
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:36,074

00:37:02,976 --> 00:37:03,559
Picalily.

570
00:37:07,397 --> 00:37:08,815
Oh, it's gypsy food.

571
00:37:09,983 --> 00:37:12,652
No, it's a local delicashy.

572
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:19,826
It's good.

573

What's in it?

574
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,163
Can't ask what'sh in it.

575
00:37:24,414 --> 00:37:28,543
In the north, everyone knowsh
what'sh in the fricadelle.

576
00:37:29,002 --> 00:37:30,003
Nobody shays it.

577
00:37:31,421 --> 00:37:33,089
Like Americans and Coco.

578
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,799

Nice little square.

Charming little church.

585
00:37:55,153 --> 00:37:55,987
Not a church.

586
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:58,948
It'sh not religioush at all.
Our belfry.

587
00:37:59,282 --> 00:38:01,784
In the Middle Agesh,

588
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:05,455
- Of all kinds.

589
00:38:06,581 --> 00:38:08,458

Ashk Antoine to take you.
He'sh the carilloneur.

591
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:13,296
Carilloneur?.

592
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:18,176
Up there, there are over 50 chimes,
called a carillon.

593
00:38:18,384 --> 00:38:21,888
Only Antoine can play.
It's come down father-to-son.

594
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:24,557
When he plays, it's beautiful.

595
00:38:24,932 --> 00:38:26,351
It's heard for miles.

596
00:38:26,934 --> 00:38:27,810
True.

597
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:32,940
Fries and a beer.

598
00:38:33,232 --> 00:38:34,901
Antoine! We're talking about you!

599
00:38:36,027 --> 00:38:36,944

601
00:38:41,824 --> 00:38:42,659
Stop.

00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:48,206

I know him! The shoutherner.

605

Not frozen yet?

606
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:57,965
Something wrong?

607
00:38:58,758 --> 00:39:01,094

And he barricaded the door!
Afraid I would fall in love?

610
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:14,232
A little respect. I don't want
to cite you on my first day.

611
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:16,609
I'm sho afraid!

612
00:39:18,194 --> 00:39:19,195
Our treat.

613
00:39:21,364 --> 00:39:24,200
Don't they shay thank you
where you come from?

614
00:39:24,784 --> 00:39:27,620
Antoine, enough.
You should be ashamed.

615
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:29,288
He just arrived.

616
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,251
What if they shpoke to you
like that in the shouth?

617
00:39:53,229 --> 00:39:55,815
I know Antoine well.
He's a good guy.

618
00:39:56,065 --> 00:39:58,192
That's no reason to insult me.

619
00:39:58,443 --> 00:40:00,028
And there's no drinking on duty.

620
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:01,904
Hish mother is hard on him.

621
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:03,573
That's no excuse.

622
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:06,659
You're giviing him the citation?

623
00:40:08,244 --> 00:40:09,203
Forget something?

624
00:40:09,412 --> 00:40:10,788
- How are you?
- What is it?

625
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:12,498
We all got together.

626
00:40:12,749 --> 00:40:15,710
We all chipped in
to furnish your place.

627
00:40:17,754 --> 00:40:18,921
A shkair!

628
00:40:30,683 --> 00:40:32,894
Eclectic,
but it'sh an improvement.

629
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:35,146
A flea market
minush the pricetagsh.

630
00:40:35,938 --> 00:40:38,608
Very nice of you.
You shouldn't have.

631
00:40:39,442 --> 00:40:40,902
But I'm a little shad.

00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:42,028
Why?.

633
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,489
To shtop shleeping with you.

634
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:52,330
How can I thank you?
Outside of the fry shack.

635
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:55,083
We can have dinner in Vieux-Lille.

636
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:56,834
No, my back hurtsh.

637
00:40:57,085 --> 00:40:59,837
You eat with your mouth,
not your back!

638
00:41:00,088 --> 00:41:01,714
Know Vieux-Lille, sir?.

639
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:04,217
Another of your smelly cheeses?

640
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:07,178
Yesh, but also a nice town.

641
00:41:31,828 --> 00:41:33,579

643
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:38,167
I like the chicon au gratin.

644
00:41:38,418 --> 00:41:39,419
The shish-kebab?

645
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:43,256
No, the chicon au gratin.
Endives in white sauce and cheese.

646
00:41:43,548 --> 00:41:45,258
Alsho the maroilles pie.

647
00:41:45,508 --> 00:41:46,718
I know maroilles.

648
00:41:46,926 --> 00:41:50,263
He can't leave here
before he tastes the carbonade.

649
00:41:50,555 --> 00:41:51,889
- The what?
- The carbonade.

650
00:41:52,098 --> 00:41:54,392
It's like a shtew, but with beer.

651
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:56,311
Can't order everything!

652
00:41:56,602 --> 00:41:58,521
A little of each, and we'll share.

653
00:42:01,274 --> 00:42:02,400
There you go.

654
00:42:05,111 --> 00:42:07,947
It's not hard to speak shtimi.
For example,

655
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,451
we don't shay, "Sorry,
I didn't quite follow your drift."

656
00:42:11,701 --> 00:42:12,618
We say, "Huh? "

657
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:15,913
That shounds like ha, ha.

658

659

Great!

660
00:42:21,878 --> 00:42:23,629

of each sentence. Try it.

663
00:42:29,636 --> 00:42:30,720
I got it, huh?

664
00:42:31,054 --> 00:42:31,638
Perfect!

665
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:34,891
You're shpeaking Shti.

666
00:42:35,183 --> 00:42:35,850
Fuck.

667
00:42:36,142 --> 00:42:39,687
No, we don't shay "fuck" like you.
We shay "Vandeus!"

668
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:41,022
Vandeus, huh?

669
00:42:41,564 --> 00:42:42,815
Lovely, biloute.

670
00:42:43,107 --> 00:42:43,816
Who?

671
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:48,112
Biloute.
That'sh a generic nickname here.

672
00:42:48,905 --> 00:42:49,947
What does it mean?

673
00:42:51,991 --> 00:42:53,451
It means...

674
00:42:55,703 --> 00:42:56,871
It means nothing.

675
00:42:57,789 --> 00:42:59,332
It means little weenie.

676
00:43:02,502 --> 00:43:05,922
It doesn't mean weenie.
It's a term of endearment.

677
00:43:06,881 --> 00:43:08,216
Oh, I see.

678
00:43:08,466 --> 00:43:11,052
Teach me dirty words.
That's important to learn.

679
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:15,264
Instead of "shit,"
we say da braun.

680
00:43:15,723 --> 00:43:17,725
"Asshole" is boubourse.

681
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:20,728
Where I come from,
we say couillosti..

682
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,896
How pretty!

683
00:43:22,188 --> 00:43:23,606
"God damn" is millard.

684
00:43:23,856 --> 00:43:26,109
Millard! Da braun, huh?

685
00:43:26,985 --> 00:43:30,905
I also noticed that instead of "me"
you say "yo".

686
00:43:32,115 --> 00:43:34,200
No, I mean "me" is "mo"

687
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:36,411
and instead of "you" it's "yo".

688
00:43:37,537 --> 00:43:39,789
Like S is SH

689
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:41,416
and SH is shka.

690
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:45,044
Like for example,
fish are fishkas!

691
00:43:45,294 --> 00:43:46,379
Right!

692
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:48,047
You order.

693
00:43:49,173 --> 00:43:51,175
That way you can practish.

694
00:43:51,467 --> 00:43:53,303
Good idea. Sakadon.

695
00:43:53,845 --> 00:43:54,595
What?

696
00:43:55,888 --> 00:43:56,931
Sakadon.

697
00:43:57,223 --> 00:43:58,474
What's that mean?

698
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:00,977
It means, don't be afraid, boss.

699
00:44:03,229 --> 00:44:04,314
Excush me!

700
00:44:04,522 --> 00:44:06,190
From the gut.

701
00:44:11,654 --> 00:44:12,488
Good evening.

702
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:14,157
Evening, biloute.

703
00:44:16,034 --> 00:44:18,745
Mo and the posh offish shtaff want...

704
00:44:18,995 --> 00:44:20,163
Wont.

705
00:44:20,872 --> 00:44:22,415
We wont...

706
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:25,501
to order

707
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:28,629
the shame again pleash.

708
00:44:29,255 --> 00:44:32,508
Sorry, I'm not Shtimi.
I'm from Paris. I didn't get that.

709
00:44:58,701 --> 00:45:01,162
Philippe, are you all right?

710
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:02,413
What's the matter?.

711
00:45:03,122 --> 00:45:04,916
You were supposed to call
when you arrived.

712
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:07,001
Shit.

713
00:45:07,251 --> 00:45:09,128
I thought something happened.

714
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,089
I'm so sorry.

715
00:45:11,798 --> 00:45:13,466
It's just...

716
00:45:14,676 --> 00:45:16,094
a little complicated.

717
00:45:16,427 --> 00:45:19,722
- What did they do?
- Nothing. I didn't want to worry you.

718
00:45:19,973 --> 00:45:22,266
But now... all is well.

719
00:45:23,184 --> 00:45:24,352
Honey, you can tell me.

720
00:45:24,644 --> 00:45:25,812
Tell you what?

721
00:45:26,104 --> 00:45:27,105
It's horrible, right?

722
00:45:27,355 --> 00:45:29,357
It's actually not that bad.

723
00:45:29,565 --> 00:45:30,358
Sure,

724
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:35,071
it's the north. But it's not so cold
and people are very...

725
00:45:35,405 --> 00:45:36,656
What's the word?

726
00:45:36,948 --> 00:45:37,657
Friendly.

727
00:45:38,366 --> 00:45:40,034
Stop it, please.

728
00:45:40,368 --> 00:45:42,954
- Stop what?
- Don't lie to me again.

729
00:45:43,204 --> 00:45:45,373
Don't act strong to spare me.

730
00:45:45,915 --> 00:45:48,668
You can tell me the worst.
I'm your wife.

731
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:49,794
It's true.

732
00:45:50,086 --> 00:45:50,712
Philippe!

733
00:45:52,505 --> 00:45:54,841
It's true. It's terrible.
I'm suffering.

734
00:45:55,925 --> 00:45:56,634
It's horrible.

735
00:45:57,176 --> 00:45:58,553
See? I know you.

736
00:46:00,596 --> 00:46:01,472
My poor dear.

737
00:46:01,764 --> 00:46:04,017
Come home quick, I'll see to you.

738
00:46:05,685 --> 00:46:09,230
These two weeks will be long.
It's going to be a nightmare.

739
00:46:10,648 --> 00:46:12,900
I 'm proud of your sacrifice for us.

740
00:46:13,443 --> 00:46:14,694
I love you.

741
00:46:16,529 --> 00:46:18,156
I love you, too.

742
00:46:53,399 --> 00:46:54,525
You all right?

743
00:47:01,741 --> 00:47:03,034
Antoine, how are you?

744
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:04,535
Fine, and you?

745
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:06,037
Morning, Yann.

746
00:47:09,123 --> 00:47:09,916
Have a good day!

747
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:11,584
Rue Nationale.

748
00:47:12,627 --> 00:47:14,170
Have a good one.

749
00:47:22,303 --> 00:47:23,096
It's open.

750
00:47:27,558 --> 00:47:28,643
Two weeks flew by!

751
00:47:29,102 --> 00:47:31,646
Careful on the road.
It's a long trip.

752
00:47:32,146 --> 00:47:33,606
Drive carefully.

753
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:37,068
Call us when you get there.
Ring twice, we'll know it's you.

754
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:38,820
You're not his mother.

755
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,655
- See you Monday.
- Have a nice weekend.

756
00:47:40,947 --> 00:47:42,365
Thanks. Where's Antoine?

757
00:47:42,657 --> 00:47:44,117
It's his carillon day.

758
00:47:44,409 --> 00:47:45,910
Don't you hear him?

759
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,621
He's playing?

760
00:47:51,165 --> 00:47:52,166
He's very good.

761
00:47:53,668 --> 00:47:54,794
The besht.

762
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,583
Dad!

763
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,460
You're not in bed?

764
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:19,879
Mom said I could wait up.

765
00:49:20,129 --> 00:49:22,882
- Let's see your toes.
- I've got them all.

766
00:49:23,174 --> 00:49:24,175
Honey.

767
00:49:24,425 --> 00:49:25,760
How was the trip?

768
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:28,179
- You're wan, but not too thin.
- I'm fine.

769
00:49:28,429 --> 00:49:31,265
- I'll put Raphael to bed.
- Let me see your toes!

770
00:49:32,016 --> 00:49:33,768
I didn't lose any!

771
00:49:38,356 --> 00:49:40,316
It's all right, Mom, he's fine!

772
00:49:40,566 --> 00:49:41,943
- Night, pal.
- Night, Dad.

773
00:49:42,193 --> 00:49:44,112
Pleasant dreams, little man.

774
00:49:46,948 --> 00:49:49,784
Have some more bouillabaisse.
It's good. I made it yesterday.

775
00:49:50,034 --> 00:49:51,619
Always better the next day.

776
00:49:52,161 --> 00:49:53,746
Have some pistou soup.

777
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,790
Or some tapenade on bread?

778
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,084
- No, thanks.
- You love that.

779
00:49:58,334 --> 00:50:00,378
I'm not very hungry.

780
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:06,175
Cry. If you need to, go ahead.

781
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:15,727
I can't.

782
00:50:15,977 --> 00:50:17,353
What happened up there?

783
00:50:17,603 --> 00:50:19,731
It's hard to talk about it.

784
00:50:20,023 --> 00:50:21,691
Are they horrible to you?

785
00:50:21,983 --> 00:50:23,151
They're...

786
00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:26,279
Well, they drink.
All of them. A lot.

787
00:50:27,155 --> 00:50:28,531
That's all they have.

788
00:50:28,823 --> 00:50:31,200
The Middle Ages.
When they speak, it's all like...

789
00:50:34,495 --> 00:50:35,788
Sure, alcoholics.

790
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:40,877
Not really alcoholics.
They drink to keep warm.

791
00:50:41,169 --> 00:50:43,254
But it's always cold.

792
00:50:43,504 --> 00:50:45,048
What a nightmare.

793
00:50:46,215 --> 00:50:47,467
My darling.

794
00:50:54,098 --> 00:50:55,850
This will hold you 2 weeks.

795
00:50:56,142 --> 00:50:59,646
It went by so fast.
Wish I could stay one more day.

796
00:51:00,647 --> 00:51:01,773
Be strong.

797
00:51:03,066 --> 00:51:03,900
Present.

798
00:51:09,072 --> 00:51:10,031
Fleece-lined.

799
00:51:13,201 --> 00:51:14,118
Put it on.

800
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:16,704
It's not that cold up there.

801
00:51:17,372 --> 00:51:20,041
Don't be overprotective of me.
Put it on.

802
00:51:49,028 --> 00:51:51,906
100 miles an hour.
You're doing better.

803
00:51:52,156 --> 00:51:52,740
Yes, thanks.

804
00:51:52,991 --> 00:51:54,492
Not going to the north?

805
00:51:54,742 --> 00:51:56,869
Yes, but I actually like it.

806
00:51:57,495 --> 00:51:59,664
Good, I'm happy for you.

807
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:02,542
It'll cost you 150 euros.

808
00:52:03,084 --> 00:52:03,876
Da braun!

809
00:52:04,293 --> 00:52:05,003
What?

810
00:52:05,753 --> 00:52:06,713
Nothing.

811
00:52:07,463 --> 00:52:08,840
Step out.

812
00:52:11,634 --> 00:52:13,177
- Hello.
- Zounds!

813
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:17,390
- It'sh cloudish.
- Gonna muck!

814
00:52:21,019 --> 00:52:24,230
Antoine, for the sorting center manager.
It's urgent.

815
00:52:25,106 --> 00:52:27,400
Call me and tell me he has it.

816
00:52:27,692 --> 00:52:29,110
I'll call and shay whot.

817
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:31,654
That he has it.

818
00:52:32,071 --> 00:52:33,990
Right. I'll call and shay whot.

819
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,200
I just told you what.

820
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:38,661
- I got it.
- You'll call me.

821
00:52:39,078 --> 00:52:40,330
Yesh.

822
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:44,125
I give it to him, then call
and I'll shay whot.

823
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:45,960
I don't know.

824
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:48,546
Something like,
"Hi, it's Antoine.

825
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:52,675
"I just gave it to the manager."
Is that clear?.

826
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:55,970
Yesh. I'm no boubourse.
I'll call you.

827
00:52:56,262 --> 00:52:57,472
Good, call me.

828
00:52:57,764 --> 00:52:58,556
And shay whot.

829
00:53:00,475 --> 00:53:01,517
Look at me.

830
00:53:03,436 --> 00:53:04,103
Are you drunk?.

831
00:53:05,605 --> 00:53:10,276
Boss, "I'll shay whot" is Shtimi for
"I'll let you know what's up."

832
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:12,779
Oh, I see.

833
00:53:13,363 --> 00:53:14,322
Sorry, Bailleul.

834
00:53:14,947 --> 00:53:15,782
Forget it.

835
00:53:16,074 --> 00:53:17,325
Call me and say what.

836
00:53:17,742 --> 00:53:19,869
That he got the envelope, right?

837
00:54:01,703 --> 00:54:04,372
Thank you, fans.
The players are back!

838
00:54:27,603 --> 00:54:28,730
Take dish.

839
00:54:29,105 --> 00:54:30,690
My kid forgot his lunchka.

840
00:54:32,483 --> 00:54:34,569
My Antoine ish mighty impreshkonable.

841
00:54:34,819 --> 00:54:37,697
Don't lead him around
all the time with you.

842
00:54:38,114 --> 00:54:39,824
No fry shack every day.

843
00:54:41,993 --> 00:54:43,494
Can I count on you?

844
00:54:44,412 --> 00:54:45,288
Yes, ma'am.

845
00:54:55,006 --> 00:54:56,049
Dishgushting.

846
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:04,140
My lipsh are shealed
but don't ashk what I think.

847
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:05,475
Heavensh.

848
00:55:09,729 --> 00:55:12,607
There. Shorry it took a while.

849
00:55:13,024 --> 00:55:14,192
Bye.

850
00:55:14,859 --> 00:55:15,902
Next!

851
00:55:16,653 --> 00:55:18,196
Hello, can I help you?

852
00:55:18,446 --> 00:55:20,156
I need thish weighed and shtamped.

853
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:21,282
Pretty shtamps.

854
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:23,660
For my shon. He collectsh them.

855
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:25,036
How shweet.

856
00:55:26,621 --> 00:55:29,290
These all right? With a hedgehog.

857
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:31,250
Perfect.

858
00:55:31,834 --> 00:55:33,086
The envelope.

859
00:55:36,464 --> 00:55:38,383
Vandeus! 26 kilos!

860
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,469
Can't be. It's in grams.

861
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,514
Right. I was thinking, what'sh in it?

862
00:55:50,353 --> 00:55:52,522
17 hedgehogs.

863
00:55:52,814 --> 00:55:55,483
That can't be.
How much is each stamp?

864
00:55:57,735 --> 00:55:59,570
Mind if I mix owls in, too?

865
00:55:59,862 --> 00:56:00,863
I'm out of hedgehogs.

866
00:56:01,114 --> 00:56:02,782
You're making a mistake.

867
00:56:03,866 --> 00:56:07,412
There'sh not enough room
for all these hedgehogsh.

868
00:56:07,662 --> 00:56:10,081
I'll have to put shome
on the other side.

869
00:56:10,415 --> 00:56:12,375
17 stamps for 26 grams.

870
00:56:12,959 --> 00:56:15,044
It can't be. It's a mistake.

871
00:56:16,754 --> 00:56:19,966
I swallowed some owls.
I won't charge you.

872
00:56:20,216 --> 00:56:21,467
Stop it!

873
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:25,305
Give me that. Move.

874
00:56:26,431 --> 00:56:29,600
I'll take care of this.
We won't charge you. It's on us.

875
00:56:29,851 --> 00:56:31,394
I'll take care of it.

876
00:56:31,894 --> 00:56:33,104
Be right there.

877
00:56:48,911 --> 00:56:50,246
- Remember?.
- Stop.

878
00:56:50,496 --> 00:56:52,832
Go home and rest.

879
00:56:53,916 --> 00:56:55,752
What would I do without you?

880
00:56:58,046 --> 00:57:00,715
You wouldn't drink
and it would do you good.

881
00:57:28,493 --> 00:57:30,578
- Well?
- Fantastic!

882
00:57:44,509 --> 00:57:45,551
Nice, right?

883
00:57:46,511 --> 00:57:47,553
How are you doing?

884
00:57:47,804 --> 00:57:50,264
Always good by the shore.
I can't bray.

885
00:57:50,515 --> 00:57:52,850
- Bray?.
- It means cry.

886
00:57:53,518 --> 00:57:56,437
- How do you say laugh?
- Laugh is laugh.

887
00:57:56,854 --> 00:57:57,689
Same word.

888
00:57:57,939 --> 00:58:01,150
We got to shpeak a little Frenchka
now and then.

889
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:05,613
Everything OK at work?.

890
00:58:06,823 --> 00:58:08,157
Great.

891
00:58:08,908 --> 00:58:11,995
By the way, I'm speaking for all of us.

892
00:58:12,245 --> 00:58:14,747
We're happy you're our manager.

893
00:58:14,998 --> 00:58:16,541
Thanksh Antoine.

894
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:19,669
Your region is really very friendly.

895
00:58:19,919 --> 00:58:21,212
Maybe so,

896
00:58:21,462 --> 00:58:23,923
but with no one to welcome,
who cares?

897
00:58:24,173 --> 00:58:25,550
So we thank you.

898
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,343
Don't mention it. Huh?

899
00:58:29,887 --> 00:58:31,556
There's a Shtimi proverb.

900
00:58:31,806 --> 00:58:35,143
When a stranger comes north
he brays twice.

901
00:58:35,393 --> 00:58:37,562
When he arrives and when he leaves.

902
00:58:38,813 --> 00:58:40,398
I was a bit down at first.

903
00:58:40,648 --> 00:58:42,400
Just wait till you leave!

904
00:58:44,736 --> 00:58:46,029
We'll shee.

905
00:58:46,279 --> 00:58:47,697
The south is my home.

906
00:58:47,947 --> 00:58:49,782
We'll shee.

907
00:58:55,163 --> 00:58:56,748
And 30.

908
00:58:58,499 --> 00:58:59,417
Bye, Ma'am.

909
00:58:59,667 --> 00:59:02,003
What do we have on for tonight?

910
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:05,298
Sir, it's Friday.

911
00:59:05,548 --> 00:59:07,884
- Aren't you going home?
- To the shouth.

912
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:10,053
Friday already?.

913
00:59:11,846 --> 00:59:13,139
Vandeus!

914
00:59:26,778 --> 00:59:28,279
Surprise!

915
00:59:29,697 --> 00:59:31,908
Your friends came to cheer you up.

916
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:34,327
- Dad!
- Hey, little man.

917
00:59:37,622 --> 00:59:40,166
Julie told us how hard it is up there.

918
00:59:43,836 --> 00:59:47,548
When I open up it's still night.
Sunrise is at 1 1 :30.

919
00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:50,385
And at 5, boom!
Night falls again.

920
00:59:51,344 --> 00:59:55,014
They're all so...
All of them. Pale, white.

921
00:59:55,515 --> 00:59:57,016
They don't get much light.

922
00:59:57,266 --> 01:00:00,520
And the hygiene!
Last week, an epidemic started.

923
01:00:01,729 --> 01:00:03,439
Cholera.

924
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:08,778
You got vaccinated?

925
01:00:09,445 --> 01:00:10,863
I'm going to have to.

926
01:00:11,114 --> 01:00:12,448
We'll check your boosters.

927
01:00:12,699 --> 01:00:14,117
It's worse than hell.

928
01:00:14,742 --> 01:00:17,328
Strange. I worked up north.
I have good memories.

929
01:00:32,093 --> 01:00:33,636
Next weekend in Belgium?

930
01:00:33,886 --> 01:00:35,096
Could be nice.

931
01:00:37,223 --> 01:00:38,433
I have to work.

932
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:41,311
You don't like him seeing us?

933
01:00:41,561 --> 01:00:42,645
No, that's not it.

934
01:00:42,895 --> 01:00:44,022
So kish me.

935
01:00:44,272 --> 01:00:46,524
Don't be ridiculous.
See you tonight.

936
01:00:46,774 --> 01:00:48,234
- Kish me!
- That hurts!

937
01:00:48,609 --> 01:00:49,694
Problem, Annabelle?

938
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,321
No, I'm fine.

939
01:00:51,654 --> 01:00:52,488
What is it, mailman?

940
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:53,906
What you want?

941
01:00:54,198 --> 01:00:55,283
Got mail for me?

942
01:00:55,533 --> 01:00:56,784
Stop, Tony.

943
01:00:57,243 --> 01:00:58,953
No mail, but a text message.

944
01:00:59,203 --> 01:01:01,080
You can't read, so here it is.

945
01:01:01,372 --> 01:01:02,081
Stop.

946
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:07,462
No parking in front of the post office.
Signed, Postman.

947
01:01:07,712 --> 01:01:09,297
Where's your mother?.

948
01:01:10,089 --> 01:01:11,299
Picking up after you?

949
01:01:13,092 --> 01:01:14,302
Stop it!

950
01:01:14,552 --> 01:01:15,845
Chime boy, want to fight?

951
01:01:16,095 --> 01:01:18,389
I oppose viiolence
between humans.

952
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,350
However, with objects...

953
01:01:23,186 --> 01:01:24,437
You're sick!

954
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:27,190
Stop!

955
01:01:30,234 --> 01:01:32,528
Stop that.
Come on, give me a hand!

956
01:01:33,112 --> 01:01:33,863
Stop it.

957
01:01:40,495 --> 01:01:41,496
Mr. Abrams...

958
01:01:42,914 --> 01:01:44,457
- He's not well.
- He's fine.

959
01:01:44,707 --> 01:01:46,209
- He's not answering.
- He's fine.

960
01:01:46,459 --> 01:01:48,086
Come on, boss.

961
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:54,008
He can't shay no.

962
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,677
You know how it is.

963
01:01:55,927 --> 01:01:59,514
You go see people,
bring the mail,

964
01:01:59,764 --> 01:02:02,225
so it's "Have a little drink."

965
01:02:02,725 --> 01:02:03,685
Little by little...

966
01:02:03,977 --> 01:02:06,896
He winds up fighting outside,
in uniform. That's intolerable.

967
01:02:07,146 --> 01:02:08,606
He can't say no. I say stop!

968
01:02:08,898 --> 01:02:11,025
An official reprimand is a lot.

969
01:02:11,317 --> 01:02:12,735
Are you defending him?

970
01:02:13,027 --> 01:02:14,779
I'm not defending him.

971
01:02:15,738 --> 01:02:16,906
I want him to get better.

972
01:02:17,156 --> 01:02:19,367
Reprimanding him won't help.

973
01:02:19,659 --> 01:02:22,120
You know what Antoine's problem is?

974
01:02:22,453 --> 01:02:23,746
He's in love with you.

975
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:27,959
Well actually...

976
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:30,003
we were together for a year.

977
01:02:30,294 --> 01:02:31,170
Why'd you leave?

978
01:02:32,213 --> 01:02:33,214
He left me.

979
01:02:34,257 --> 01:02:35,258
I don't understand.

980
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,510
I was very much in love.

981
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,596
I stood up to his mother,
who's very overbearing.

982
01:02:41,514 --> 01:02:42,765
I got very mad.

983
01:02:43,558 --> 01:02:46,436
And I told Antoine to choose.
He chose her.

984
01:02:46,728 --> 01:02:49,897
So? I'm a postal manager,
not a social worker.

985
01:03:45,078 --> 01:03:47,288
Beautiful, Antoine. Keep playing.

986
01:03:54,545 --> 01:03:58,132
Are you here to give me
a music degree or a reprimand?

987
01:03:58,424 --> 01:04:00,426
Why don't you talk
to your mother?.

988
01:04:01,552 --> 01:04:05,139
I spoke to Annabelle.
Your mom's the source of the problem.

989
01:04:11,729 --> 01:04:15,024
I have to be kind to my mom.
She's had a hard life.

990
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,986
By not telling her
what's on your mind?

991
01:04:20,154 --> 01:04:21,656
We're all the same.

992
01:04:21,948 --> 01:04:24,784
I love my wife,
but I lie to her all weekend.

993
01:04:25,034 --> 01:04:25,660
Why?.

994
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,203
It's a long story.

995
01:04:27,996 --> 01:04:30,665
- I didn't know you were married.
- I am.

996
01:04:30,915 --> 01:04:34,043
Then why doesn't she come
and live here with you?

997
01:04:35,753 --> 01:04:37,255
My wife is...

998
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:41,843
Depressed. Clinically, even.

999
01:04:43,303 --> 01:04:45,346
If she came north, she'd get worse.

1000
01:04:45,763 --> 01:04:46,514
Why?.

1001
01:04:46,806 --> 01:04:50,268
I mean, it would be worse
for her to leave home.

1002
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,436
Wherever she went.

1003
01:04:52,895 --> 01:04:53,855
I see.

1004
01:04:54,147 --> 01:04:56,316
Antoine, all I'm asking

1005
01:04:56,566 --> 01:04:58,318
is to go easy at work.

1006
01:04:58,609 --> 01:05:02,280
Drinking won't make it better.
It can only get worse.

1007
01:05:02,613 --> 01:05:04,032
I acted like a babash.

1008
01:05:05,325 --> 01:05:06,284
We all make mistakes.

1009
01:05:06,534 --> 01:05:08,703
What counts is how you fix it.

1010
01:05:10,413 --> 01:05:11,456
It can't be fixed.

1011
01:05:11,748 --> 01:05:13,333
You can fix anything.

1012
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:15,168
Except maybe his motorcycle.

1013
01:05:17,962 --> 01:05:18,755
You want to try?.

1014
01:05:19,005 --> 01:05:20,965
- What?
- The carillon!

1015
01:05:22,717 --> 01:05:25,386
You must know a tune.
It's like a piano.

1016
01:05:26,638 --> 01:05:28,222
Everyone will hear.

1017
01:05:28,473 --> 01:05:30,350
Plug in the earphones.

1018
01:05:31,601 --> 01:05:32,894
Go ahead, biloute.

1019
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:35,813
Not that one.

1020
01:05:37,398 --> 01:05:38,399
Not easy.

1021
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:39,567
Higher.

1022
01:05:56,209 --> 01:05:57,543
Antoine, wait!

1023
01:05:58,378 --> 01:05:59,754
I'm coming with you.

1024
01:06:01,005 --> 01:06:02,215
I know my route.

1025
01:06:02,465 --> 01:06:05,468
I'm coming along.
You have to learn to say no.

1026
01:06:05,969 --> 01:06:07,387
You're the bosh.

1027
01:06:27,365 --> 01:06:28,241
Hey, biloute!

1028
01:06:28,533 --> 01:06:29,242
Mr. Mahieux.

1029
01:06:29,492 --> 01:06:32,161
Hi. Philippe Abrams,
the post office manager.

1030
01:06:32,453 --> 01:06:33,871
Nice of you to come.

1031
01:06:34,122 --> 01:06:35,248
Come in a minute.

1032
01:06:35,999 --> 01:06:39,252
No, thank you Mr. Mahieux.
We'll be moviing on.

1033
01:06:39,502 --> 01:06:40,878
Too early for cocktails.

1034
01:06:41,754 --> 01:06:45,091
- How about coffee?
- That's different. Fine.

1035
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:48,761
- A little juniper?.
- Not for me.

1036
01:06:49,429 --> 01:06:50,138
No, thank you.

1037
01:06:50,388 --> 01:06:53,266
It'll warm you up.
A southerner like yourshelf!

1038
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,730
I can't drink that.

1039
01:06:59,814 --> 01:07:02,025
It's a local specialty. Just taste.

1040
01:07:02,275 --> 01:07:03,860
It disinfects.

1041
01:07:04,444 --> 01:07:05,611
To your health!

1042
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:14,912
Sugar takes the edge off.

1043
01:07:15,204 --> 01:07:16,080
Sugar?.

1044
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:19,000
No sugar!

1045
01:07:26,215 --> 01:07:27,592
Thanks for the coffee.

1046
01:07:27,884 --> 01:07:28,885
Don't mention it.

1047
01:07:29,135 --> 01:07:31,137
Come back any time.

1048
01:07:31,387 --> 01:07:32,764
See you tomorrow.

1049
01:07:33,348 --> 01:07:35,016
Have a good day.

1050
01:07:41,105 --> 01:07:42,357
You see, Antoine,

1051
01:07:42,982 --> 01:07:45,818
how one can be cordial
with a customer,

1052
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:47,779
while drinking only coffee.

1053
01:07:48,029 --> 01:07:49,238
Yes, I see.

1054
01:07:49,489 --> 01:07:50,448
But that's it!

1055
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:51,783
There are limits!

1056
01:07:52,033 --> 01:07:54,952
- No more jennifer.
- Juniper.

1057
01:07:59,207 --> 01:08:02,627
Don't ring the bell!
They'll offer us a drink.

1058
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,170
It's registered.

1059
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:07,924
That's different.
But no going inside. No drinking.

1060
01:08:10,259 --> 01:08:11,010
Come in!

1061
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:15,056
No, we'll stay at the door.
It's too dangerous.

1062
01:08:20,103 --> 01:08:22,188
You. Voice sounded familiar.

1063
01:08:22,605 --> 01:08:24,774
Mr. Vasseur. What a nice surprise.

1064
01:08:25,024 --> 01:08:26,943
Registered letter. Sign here.

1065
01:08:27,193 --> 01:08:31,239
Guess what. I speak fluent Shtimi.
I understand you now.

1066
01:08:31,489 --> 01:08:33,950
Perfect Shtimi, written and oral!

1067
01:08:34,242 --> 01:08:35,284
Let's celebrate.

1068
01:08:35,535 --> 01:08:36,869
Come in, we'll toast.

1069
01:08:40,415 --> 01:08:42,583
- Any juniper?.
- Juniper?.

1070
01:08:42,834 --> 01:08:45,545
No. I never touch alcohol.

1071
01:08:45,962 --> 01:08:49,298
I might have a wee yellow,
like in your neck of the woods.

1072
01:08:49,549 --> 01:08:50,883
I got it as a gift.

1073
01:08:51,134 --> 01:08:52,927
- Yellow?.
- Pastis.

1074
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:56,347
Pastis, just like home.
A little yellow!

1075
01:08:56,597 --> 01:08:57,432
I won't drink.

1076
01:08:58,099 --> 01:08:59,767
A little pastis won't hurt you.

1077
01:09:00,351 --> 01:09:01,352
I better not.

1078
01:09:01,602 --> 01:09:03,354
Just one, I'll close my eyes.

1079
01:09:03,604 --> 01:09:04,480
I'd rather not.

1080
01:09:04,731 --> 01:09:08,359
Bailleul! It's an order.
Comes from upstairs!

1081
01:09:08,651 --> 01:09:10,695
- Lots of water.
- If you like.

1082
01:09:10,945 --> 01:09:12,113
Here kids.

1083
01:09:12,905 --> 01:09:15,616
Don't pour it higher than the glass.

1084
01:09:18,161 --> 01:09:20,121
Firm. Stop. Nyet.

1085
01:09:20,371 --> 01:09:23,166
- My block.
- Look out for your mother!

1086
01:09:29,255 --> 01:09:33,134

Thanksh.

1091
01:09:53,446 --> 01:09:54,614
That's lovely.

1092
01:09:55,323 --> 01:09:56,991
So beautiful.

1093
01:10:10,254 --> 01:10:12,674
Hi, biloutes!
It's the mailman!

1094
01:10:12,965 --> 01:10:15,093
No need to say hello each time.

1095
01:10:15,343 --> 01:10:16,594
I'm thirsty!

1096
01:10:20,848 --> 01:10:24,102
See how I turned down
that fifth beer, Antoine?

1097
01:10:24,352 --> 01:10:25,353
Firm!

1098
01:10:26,396 --> 01:10:27,647
Cordial, but firm.

1099
01:10:27,897 --> 01:10:30,358
You shouldn't have.
It was picon beer.

1100
01:10:31,734 --> 01:10:34,696
I love it,
and it doesn't get you drunk.

1101
01:10:34,946 --> 01:10:37,991
Now we have to stop.
Everything with moderation!

1102
01:10:38,241 --> 01:10:39,659
- The magic word?
- Thanksh.

1103
01:10:39,909 --> 01:10:41,411
No! The word is no!

1104
01:10:41,661 --> 01:10:42,578
No thanksh.

1105
01:10:42,829 --> 01:10:43,788
Right.

1106
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,712
I love your region, Antoine.
I love it.

1107
01:10:53,464 --> 01:10:55,341
I love the north!

1108
01:10:57,218 --> 01:10:59,595
And you too. I adore you.

1109
01:11:00,346 --> 01:11:02,348
I like you too, sir.

1110
01:11:10,857 --> 01:11:13,109
Call me Philippe, Antoine.

1111
01:11:15,069 --> 01:11:17,196
Vandeus! Da braun!

1112
01:11:19,741 --> 01:11:20,700
My stomach hurts.

1113
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:24,912
Long as it'sh not your ash,
you can shtill shkit!

1114
01:11:38,051 --> 01:11:39,469
Hi, Antoine. Sir.

1115
01:11:40,386 --> 01:11:42,847
It's OK. He opened the door.
You can stop ringing now.

1116
01:11:43,097 --> 01:11:46,559
Mr. Leborgne,
there's no mail for you.

1117
01:11:46,809 --> 01:11:48,061
But we'll have a drink.

1118
01:11:48,311 --> 01:11:49,979
To toast our friendship.

1119
01:11:51,689 --> 01:11:52,607
Come in.

1120
01:11:59,822 --> 01:12:00,990
Want to race, Antoine?

1121
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,367
No, no racing.

1122
01:12:02,617 --> 01:12:05,578
Last one to the post office
is a double boubourse!

1123
01:12:08,915 --> 01:12:11,084
Watch out! The stop sign!
Philippe!

1124
01:12:18,841 --> 01:12:20,843
Come on! We can lose them!

1125
01:12:24,472 --> 01:12:25,515
Stop!

1126
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:41,447
Goshk, my ash!

1127
01:12:41,656 --> 01:12:42,824
You all right?

1128
01:12:43,157 --> 01:12:44,617
- Who are you?
- Police.

1129
01:12:44,867 --> 01:12:47,870
I work for the government too.
Bergues Post Office.

1130
01:12:48,121 --> 01:12:49,914
Come on, we're taking you in.

1131
01:12:50,164 --> 01:12:52,709
Shtop it, biloute.
We're all Shti here.

1132
01:12:52,959 --> 01:12:54,127
I'm Shti now, right?

1133
01:12:57,630 --> 01:13:00,133
Hey, biloute. Don't be a babash!

1134
01:13:00,341 --> 01:13:01,759
Calm down, sir.

1135
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:03,886
Come on, aren't you shti?.

1136
01:13:04,137 --> 01:13:07,098
You're not. Let me see.
You're not a shti.

1137
01:13:07,557 --> 01:13:09,225
He's not shti.

1138
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,939
Let's all go to the french fry
shack for fricadelle!

1139
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:16,149
Momo!

1140
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:19,444
Four fricadelles, Momo!

1141
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,196
We haven't eaten yet!

1142
01:13:24,615 --> 01:13:26,451
No! Hang on, hang on.

1143
01:13:32,582 --> 01:13:33,166
Honey?.

1144
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:37,754
Can't come home tonight, hon.
I'm at the police station.

1145
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:39,922
Philippe, were you mugged?

1146
01:13:40,214 --> 01:13:43,468
No. I just had
a little to drink.

1147
01:13:44,135 --> 01:13:45,428
So I got arrested.

1148
01:13:45,678 --> 01:13:46,429
In your car?

1149
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:47,889
On a bicycle.

1150
01:13:48,181 --> 01:13:50,683
Why were you drunk, on a bicycle?

1151
01:13:55,647 --> 01:13:57,565
Saying no to liquor.

1152
01:13:57,857 --> 01:13:59,942
Oh my darling, what's going on?

1153
01:14:00,401 --> 01:14:02,445
Don't try to drown your sorrows.

1154
01:14:03,488 --> 01:14:05,406
I know it's hard. Be strong.

1155
01:14:05,657 --> 01:14:06,699
All right.

1156
01:14:08,326 --> 01:14:11,329
I have to go. They're sobering me up.
I love you.

1157
01:14:11,579 --> 01:14:13,498
Me too. More than anything.

1158
01:14:37,814 --> 01:14:38,940
Well?

1159
01:14:40,441 --> 01:14:41,567
Well what?

1160
01:14:42,443 --> 01:14:43,653
Let's see your hands.

1161
01:14:45,822 --> 01:14:48,408
No trembling. Two days sober.
No side effects?

1162
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:49,826
I'm fine.

1163
01:14:53,246 --> 01:14:54,372
Oh no!

1164
01:14:54,664 --> 01:14:55,748
What is it?

1165
01:14:58,543 --> 01:15:01,671
You drank my perfume?
I read where alcoholics do that.

1166
01:15:01,963 --> 01:15:03,172
No, I'm holding up.

1167
01:15:03,631 --> 01:15:07,343
I'd rather go get you a bottle
than have you drink my Givenchy.

1168
01:15:19,647 --> 01:15:20,940
What's this?

1169
01:15:23,693 --> 01:15:24,610
Julie.

1170
01:15:24,861 --> 01:15:26,988
I was weak. I'm sorry.

1171
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:28,323
What's all this?

1172
01:15:28,573 --> 01:15:30,491
My bags. I'm coming with you.

1173
01:15:31,367 --> 01:15:32,910
What about Raphael?

1174
01:15:33,369 --> 01:15:34,996
My parents will mind him.

1175
01:15:35,246 --> 01:15:37,582
We'll find him a school up north.

1176
01:15:38,124 --> 01:15:40,001
What about your store?
Your job?

1177
01:15:40,251 --> 01:15:43,212
I took a leave of absence.
I'm coming north with you.

1178
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,381
No, Julie.

1179
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:51,054
I'm scared, but I'm happy
to be going with you.

1180
01:15:51,304 --> 01:15:52,764
We'll stay together.

1181
01:15:54,849 --> 01:15:56,809
We'll be stronger together.

1182
01:16:03,608 --> 01:16:05,068
Got your seatbelt on?

1183
01:16:05,318 --> 01:16:06,569
Of course.

1184
01:16:08,237 --> 01:16:09,697
He's a maniac!

1185
01:16:31,803 --> 01:16:33,471
What speed were you doing?

1186
01:16:33,888 --> 01:16:34,639
The right one.

1187
01:16:34,931 --> 01:16:37,016
We're taking you for a blood test.

1188
01:16:37,266 --> 01:16:38,434
My husband didn't drink.

1189
01:16:38,726 --> 01:16:40,186
He may have perfumed his mouth.

1190
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:42,146
Don't worry.
Go with the tow truck.

1191
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:43,231
I'm staying with you.

1192
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:46,776
Go back, reassure everyone.
Take care of the insurance.

1193
01:16:47,026 --> 01:16:47,819
I'll take the train.

1194
01:16:48,486 --> 01:16:49,278
Good idea.

1195
01:16:49,779 --> 01:16:52,073
All right, but you be careful.

1196
01:16:52,323 --> 01:16:54,075
I'll come as soon as I can.

1197
01:16:54,325 --> 01:16:55,159
Great.

1198
01:16:56,786 --> 01:16:58,079
Come into my office.

1199
01:16:58,955 --> 01:17:00,206
We have to talk.

1200
01:17:02,083 --> 01:17:03,292
This is very serious.

1201
01:17:03,543 --> 01:17:04,419
What ish it?

1202
01:17:04,669 --> 01:17:05,795
My wife's coming tomorrow.

1203
01:17:06,045 --> 01:17:07,046
Good news.

1204
01:17:07,296 --> 01:17:08,589
Not really.

1205
01:17:09,007 --> 01:17:11,092
- Marriage not good?
- Yes it is.

1206
01:17:12,176 --> 01:17:14,804
Since we've been 700 miles apart,
it's great.

1207
01:17:16,723 --> 01:17:18,599
My wife is depressed.

1208
01:17:19,559 --> 01:17:22,353
It helps her
to know I'm in the north.

1209
01:17:22,854 --> 01:17:25,523
She focuses on a concrete problem.

1210
01:17:27,233 --> 01:17:29,444
I'm not sure I understand.

1211
01:17:30,194 --> 01:17:31,487
I lied about you.

1212
01:17:31,904 --> 01:17:34,782
She thinks I'm in a liviing hell.
The more I suffer,

1213
01:17:35,074 --> 01:17:36,909
the better she feels.

1214
01:17:37,327 --> 01:17:38,328
Pretty twisted.

1215
01:17:38,619 --> 01:17:39,704
Maybe, but it works.

1216
01:17:39,954 --> 01:17:42,040
We have never been so happy.

1217
01:17:43,541 --> 01:17:45,543
What did you tell her about us?

1218
01:17:51,007 --> 01:17:52,342
A few clichés.

1219
01:17:52,967 --> 01:17:56,012
General notions.
I didn't make anything up.

1220
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:59,474
I said you were a little...

1221
01:17:59,807 --> 01:18:00,892
basic.

1222
01:18:01,184 --> 01:18:02,560
A little...

1223
01:18:03,102 --> 01:18:04,395
simple,

1224
01:18:05,855 --> 01:18:07,607
a little rough.

1225
01:18:08,733 --> 01:18:10,485
At times vulgar.

1226
01:18:11,569 --> 01:18:12,862
Dense.

1227
01:18:14,447 --> 01:18:15,907
Backward, too.

1228
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,992
And a few other things.

1229
01:19:00,827 --> 01:19:01,619
Hello, my love.

1230
01:19:12,255 --> 01:19:13,715
This is very pretty.

1231
01:19:14,632 --> 01:19:17,343
Honey, I have something to confess.

1232
01:19:20,346 --> 01:19:22,181
Welcome to the north, Julie!

1233
01:19:31,941 --> 01:19:32,984
Welcome kish!

1234
01:19:33,234 --> 01:19:34,110
Welcome to the north!

1235
01:19:41,284 --> 01:19:42,285
Come on!

1236
01:20:02,221 --> 01:20:03,514
Drink up!

1237
01:20:04,349 --> 01:20:06,601
We'll take care of the bosh' wife.

1238
01:20:08,936 --> 01:20:10,271
That'sh for sure!

1239
01:20:17,862 --> 01:20:18,821
Get out of here!

1240
01:20:20,657 --> 01:20:24,077
Back to your shack!
Don't come back in the morn!

1241
01:20:25,495 --> 01:20:26,704
Where are we?

1242
01:20:26,954 --> 01:20:28,456
In Bergues, honey.

1243
01:20:29,207 --> 01:20:30,249
Evening.

1244
01:20:31,167 --> 01:20:33,753
Look at all these mushelsh!

1245
01:20:34,754 --> 01:20:37,423
What'sh the two looking at?
Never sheen me?

1246
01:20:37,715 --> 01:20:40,385
Shtop your crapping, Ma!

1247
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:46,849
Who are these people?

1248
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:49,310
They're miners, from the mine.

1249
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:52,772
Aren't they closed?

1250
01:20:53,022 --> 01:20:54,315
Not thish one.

1251
01:20:54,565 --> 01:20:58,444
Not much left, but even closed,
we live inshide it!

1252
01:20:58,695 --> 01:21:00,321
Where should we go?

1253
01:21:07,286 --> 01:21:09,706
Vandeus! Dirty kid!

1254
01:21:09,956 --> 01:21:11,249
All the shame.

1255
01:21:11,457 --> 01:21:13,418
I'll shlap him shilly!

1256
01:21:15,878 --> 01:21:18,214
Shee you later.

1257
01:21:25,638 --> 01:21:27,140
That'sh Shity Hall.

1258
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:31,936
Down there's the posht offish,
and ballroom. No more balls.

1259
01:21:32,603 --> 01:21:34,063
It's worse than you said.

1260
01:21:34,314 --> 01:21:37,900
I tried to warn you.
I didn't want you to see this.

1261
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:00,757
No! You live here?

1262
01:22:01,132 --> 01:22:02,050
Yes.

1263
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:04,719
It has southern exposure.
Good light.

1264
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:08,598
I forgot. Dinner ish at 9.

1265
01:22:08,806 --> 01:22:10,475
Don't be late!

1266
01:22:13,186 --> 01:22:14,145
Can't we eat alone?

1267
01:22:14,604 --> 01:22:18,274
No, it's the welcome meal.
If we don't go, I'll pay.

1268
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,417
Make conversation.

1269
01:22:45,301 --> 01:22:46,844
Nice eating outside.

1270
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:50,223
Can't stay late,
cause of the jackals.

1271
01:22:53,226 --> 01:22:54,435
What are we eating?

1272
01:22:54,686 --> 01:22:55,561
Meat.

1273
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:57,438
What kind?

1274
01:22:57,897 --> 01:22:59,565
Depends what we find.

1275
01:23:05,196 --> 01:23:06,239
Shit! Missed.

1276
01:23:06,572 --> 01:23:09,242
Fabrice, we got enough. Come eat.

1277
01:23:10,284 --> 01:23:11,077
Coming.

1278
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:19,544
Dinner's served!

1279
01:23:34,767 --> 01:23:35,852
I can't.

1280
01:23:37,186 --> 01:23:38,521
Pass me some bread.

1281
01:23:55,955 --> 01:23:56,998
Tomorrow,

1282
01:23:57,248 --> 01:23:59,959
we'll go to the mine
to play hide-and-seek.

1283
01:24:00,293 --> 01:24:01,294
Good.

1284
01:24:01,502 --> 01:24:02,628
Hide-and-seek.

1285
01:24:08,051 --> 01:24:10,386
Did they go sleep at the mine?

1286
01:24:14,307 --> 01:24:16,809
I doubt it. It's only 1 AM.

1287
01:24:20,146 --> 01:24:23,232
You can hear the neighbors.
What are they saying?

1288
01:24:24,651 --> 01:24:27,320
They're fighting.
Like almost every night.

1289
01:24:34,952 --> 01:24:37,121
There. It's settled.

1290
01:24:37,997 --> 01:24:39,290
Someone's dead?

1291
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,668
He fires to calm his wife down.

1292
01:24:43,002 --> 01:24:45,088
What a nightmare.

1293
01:24:45,546 --> 01:24:47,799
How could you ever make it
two years?

1294
01:24:49,092 --> 01:24:51,260
How could you stand it this long?

1295
01:24:53,096 --> 01:24:54,472
I could use a drink.

1296
01:24:54,806 --> 01:24:58,726
You have to go back. I'll take you
to the train in the morning.

1297
01:24:59,769 --> 01:25:00,645
All right.

1298
01:25:01,604 --> 01:25:03,648
To get the rest of my things.

1299
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:06,025
It's clear Raphael can't come.

1300
01:25:06,317 --> 01:25:08,987
He'll stay with my parents
2 years if necessary,

1301
01:25:09,153 --> 01:25:10,363
I'll stay with you.

1302
01:25:10,613 --> 01:25:12,115
You can't. I don't want you to.

1303
01:25:13,157 --> 01:25:16,035
I love you.
If it's your life, it's mine too.

1304
01:25:22,959 --> 01:25:23,710
Well?

1305
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:26,004
Nothing. Maybe they're sleeping.

1306
01:25:27,005 --> 01:25:29,799
Should we finish it off
with a fire?

1307
01:25:30,508 --> 01:25:31,467
Are you crazy?.

1308
01:25:31,718 --> 01:25:32,844
You're babash.

1309
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:35,680
Sure, if I shuggest it,
it's da braun.

1310
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:39,767
The shot was a good idea.

1311
01:25:40,018 --> 01:25:40,768
Another?.

1312
01:25:41,019 --> 01:25:43,479
No, Yann. That'sh enough now.

1313
01:25:44,147 --> 01:25:45,064
Let'sh go home.

1314
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:51,362
Not coming?

1315
01:25:52,196 --> 01:25:54,782
Shomeone hash to be here
in the morning.

1316
01:25:55,408 --> 01:25:56,826
Yeah, right.

1317
01:25:58,661 --> 01:25:59,412
Annabelle, wait.

1318
01:26:02,582 --> 01:26:04,625
Maybe you should sleep here too.

1319
01:26:05,585 --> 01:26:07,295
Antoine, please.

1320
01:26:08,254 --> 01:26:13,009
If I'm alone tomorrow morning,
she might get suspicious.

1321
01:26:14,177 --> 01:26:16,304
Right now, I'm suspicious.

1322
01:26:18,181 --> 01:26:21,643
For once, we're together in Bergues
without my mom.

1323
01:26:24,687 --> 01:26:25,772
Good night.

1324
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:12,193
- Did it go all right?
- No.

1325
01:27:12,986 --> 01:27:14,070
Me neither.

1326
01:27:14,278 --> 01:27:16,447
- She wants to stay.
- In the north?

1327
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:18,116
No. Right here.

1328
01:27:20,284 --> 01:27:24,163
We dissuaded her in every way,
she's still willing to stay.

1329
01:27:24,414 --> 01:27:25,581
Why?.

1330
01:27:26,082 --> 01:27:27,333
Because she loves me.

1331
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:29,210
Oh millard. Da braun.

1332
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:33,089
I fought to get to the Riviiera,
to save my couple

1333
01:27:33,339 --> 01:27:35,550
and here in the north,
it all works out!

1334
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,427
That's great if it works out.

1335
01:27:37,677 --> 01:27:40,179
But what now?.
She won't leave this dump!

1336
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:42,682
- Tell her the truth?
- No.

1337
01:27:43,182 --> 01:27:45,727
My wife loves me.
I should ruin that with truth?

1338
01:27:45,977 --> 01:27:47,562
- Coward.
- I'm not a coward.

1339
01:27:47,770 --> 01:27:49,897
You are. Your wife loves you.
You're here

1340
01:27:50,148 --> 01:27:52,567
and you can't level with her.
Be a Shti.

1341
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:57,697
I won't listen to a boubourse who's 35
and can't stand up to mom!

1342
01:27:58,364 --> 01:27:59,324
What did you shay?.

1343
01:27:59,615 --> 01:28:01,075
You're no braver than me.

1344
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:04,454
I can talk to my mom any time.

1345
01:28:04,746 --> 01:28:05,580
Then do it.

1346
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,249
Go talk to your wife and butt out.

1347
01:28:08,499 --> 01:28:10,543
Fine. You, your mother.
Me, my wife.

1348
01:28:22,055 --> 01:28:23,348
Mrs. Abrams!

1349
01:28:36,694 --> 01:28:37,737
Can I help you?

1350
01:28:38,404 --> 01:28:40,490
I'm lost. The Bergues post office?

1351
01:28:40,782 --> 01:28:41,658
Bergues?

1352
01:28:42,492 --> 01:28:43,993
This isn't Bergues.

1353
01:28:44,285 --> 01:28:45,203
It isn't?

1354
01:28:45,495 --> 01:28:47,955
No, it's the old mining viillage.

1355
01:28:48,164 --> 01:28:49,624
Bergue's over that way.

1356
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:51,209
Oh.

1357
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:53,044
Thanks.

1358
01:28:53,586 --> 01:28:54,629
Get on.

1359
01:28:55,088 --> 01:28:55,922
I'll drop you off.

1360
01:28:57,965 --> 01:28:59,676
Get on, I won't bite you.

1361
01:29:26,828 --> 01:29:28,162
My wife is missing.

1362
01:29:28,413 --> 01:29:30,790
No. She's waiting for you upstairs.

1363
01:29:31,916 --> 01:29:33,793
I had to tell her.

1364
01:29:50,601 --> 01:29:52,603
No palace, but it's livable.

1365
01:29:54,647 --> 01:29:57,191
The Shtis lent me furniture.
They're very nice.

1366
01:29:59,152 --> 01:30:00,903
You've been lying for months.

1367
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:03,740
I tried to tell you.
You wouldn't believe me.

1368
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:05,575
I said what you wanted to hear.

1369
01:30:06,034 --> 01:30:08,036
That whole act so I wouldn't stay.

1370
01:30:08,995 --> 01:30:10,872
It was going great between us.

1371
01:30:18,629 --> 01:30:21,424
We separated
so we'd be better together. No?

1372
01:30:25,928 --> 01:30:27,597
I'm going back south.

1373
01:30:32,185 --> 01:30:34,187
Ah, little biloute.

1374
01:30:34,562 --> 01:30:35,855
Mail for your mom?

1375
01:30:36,689 --> 01:30:38,232
No, we have to talk.

1376
01:30:38,524 --> 01:30:40,526
What'sh the matter?. You shick?.

1377
01:30:41,027 --> 01:30:42,445
You catchka something?

1378
01:30:48,326 --> 01:30:52,830
Jush lishen, don't talk.
Whatever you shay won't matter.

1379
01:30:53,081 --> 01:30:55,541
Becaush it ish the way it ish.
That'sh all. OK?.

1380
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:57,126
I didn't shay a word.

1381
01:30:59,962 --> 01:31:02,131
I'm leaviing the housh.

1382
01:31:03,132 --> 01:31:05,760
I'm getting my own plashe,
with Annabelle.

1383
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:08,304
Maybe you don't, but I love her.

1384
01:31:08,554 --> 01:31:11,140
And she's the one I chooshe.

1385
01:31:11,557 --> 01:31:13,351
Now, what do you shay?.

1386
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:15,520
It'sh about time!

1387
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:18,439
I wash wondering when
you would finally do it.

1388
01:31:20,984 --> 01:31:21,985
You're not mad?

1389
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:24,529
Why should I be mad?

1390
01:31:24,904 --> 01:31:26,489
That'sh all a mother could want.

1391
01:31:26,739 --> 01:31:29,033
For her shon to find happinesh.

1392
01:31:31,202 --> 01:31:33,121
I didn't raise you for myshelf.

1393
01:31:35,081 --> 01:31:36,791
And if one day,

1394
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:40,420

or a wee biloutesh,

1395
01:31:40,670 --> 01:31:42,171
I'd be very happy.

1396
01:31:47,343 --> 01:31:48,261
All right.

1397
01:31:49,512 --> 01:31:52,557
Anything elshe?
I have to finish my potatoesh.

1398
01:32:08,781 --> 01:32:10,658
Take some time to think.

1399
01:32:12,493 --> 01:32:15,038
Just know I'm right here,
if you need me.

1400
01:32:16,205 --> 01:32:18,499
I'll come, right away.

1401
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,091
My love to Raphael.

1402
01:32:47,737 --> 01:32:48,988
Hello, Annabelle.

1403
01:32:49,405 --> 01:32:51,240
Mrs. Bailleul. Can I help you?

1404
01:32:51,616 --> 01:32:54,452
I came to congratulate you.
Well done.

1405
01:32:55,119 --> 01:32:56,829
You won my shon.

1406
01:32:58,539 --> 01:32:59,999
I'm leaviing him alone now.

1407
01:33:02,001 --> 01:33:05,171
I'm done.
I don't watch him anymore.

1408
01:33:06,214 --> 01:33:07,882
From today on,

1409
01:33:08,883 --> 01:33:10,218
I'm watching both of you.

1410
01:33:10,468 --> 01:33:13,262
And you better be happy,
or you'll deal with me!

1411
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:14,764
Got it?

01:33:26,192 --> 01:33:27,193
All my besht.

1413
01:33:28,111 --> 01:33:29,404
Thanksh.

1414
01:33:42,542 --> 01:33:44,919
That wash playing
when I met Annabelle.

1415
01:33:46,379 --> 01:33:49,215
He'sh one of ush.
Shti Veewonder.

1416
01:33:50,425 --> 01:33:52,468
Sorry, don't feel like laughing.

1417
01:33:54,846 --> 01:33:57,432
I didn't even ask you
how it went for you?

1418
01:33:57,682 --> 01:33:59,684
Great. I talked to my mom.

1419
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:01,811
I shed I'm marrying Annabelle.

1420
01:34:02,103 --> 01:34:02,937
How'd she react?

1421
01:34:03,688 --> 01:34:06,190
She wantsh a wee bilout or biloutesh.

1422
01:34:07,025 --> 01:34:07,942
Fantastic.

1423
01:34:08,735 --> 01:34:10,820
Now I just have to tell Annabelle.

1424
01:34:12,322 --> 01:34:13,239
You haven't?

1425
01:34:13,823 --> 01:34:15,575
I'm afraid she'll say no.

1426
01:34:15,867 --> 01:34:16,951
Still with the biker?.

1427
01:34:17,285 --> 01:34:19,454
I don't know. I hope not.

1428
01:34:25,043 --> 01:34:26,836
It's you, sir?. What is it?

1429
01:34:27,128 --> 01:34:28,755
I need you. It's urgent.

1430
01:34:29,213 --> 01:34:31,257
At this hour?.
Can't it wait?

1431
01:34:31,591 --> 01:34:33,718
It's an order!
Come down, please.

1432
01:34:45,188 --> 01:34:47,315
Stay right there. Don't move.

1433
01:34:59,369 --> 01:35:00,912
She's downstairs. Ready?.

1434
01:35:01,162 --> 01:35:03,414
- I have stagefright.
- Go! Sakadon!

1435
01:35:28,523 --> 01:35:30,692
ANNABELLE,
I LOVE YOU

1436
01:35:31,109 --> 01:35:32,610
MARRY ME BILOUTE

1437
01:35:59,804 --> 01:36:03,683
Before you answer,
I left my mother.

1438
01:36:04,225 --> 01:36:05,310
I know.

1439
01:36:06,102 --> 01:36:07,145
She told me.

1440
01:36:14,235 --> 01:36:15,486
Then it's yesh?

1441
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:22,368
It'sh very pretty.

1442
01:36:23,161 --> 01:36:25,163
I have no shkeets now.

1443
01:36:25,413 --> 01:36:27,915
Took you long enough,
Antoine Bailleul.

1444
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:33,231
When we met, we could be anywhere.

1445
01:37:33,481 --> 01:37:35,608
We were happy, just being together.

1446
01:37:36,317 --> 01:37:37,777
How could we forget that?

1447
01:37:38,778 --> 01:37:40,029
I love you.

1448
01:37:42,699 --> 01:37:44,951
I want you to come live in the north.

1449
01:37:45,743 --> 01:37:47,578
I don't want us to be apart.

1450
01:37:47,996 --> 01:37:48,746
Ever again.

1451
01:38:02,802 --> 01:38:04,220
Dad, Mom...

1452
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:06,389
Why are you kissing in public?

1453
01:38:08,474 --> 01:38:10,059
Let's go lose some toes.

1454
01:38:42,508 --> 01:38:43,676
Mail.

1455
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:46,179
For you, Philippe.

1456
01:38:50,683 --> 01:38:52,393
Shit. It's H.R.

1457
01:38:53,102 --> 01:38:55,938
Been three yearsh.
Had to happen one day.

1458
01:39:06,824 --> 01:39:07,450
Well?

1459
01:39:09,661 --> 01:39:10,620
Porquerolles.

1460
01:39:10,912 --> 01:39:12,538
That's great.

1461
01:39:17,001 --> 01:39:18,252
See you tonight.

1462
01:39:22,423 --> 01:39:24,425
You managersh are all the shame.

1463
01:39:24,676 --> 01:39:27,720
Come out of nowhere.
Got to get ushed to you.

1464
01:39:28,137 --> 01:39:30,515
Jusht when everyone's happy,
you leave.

1465
01:39:30,765 --> 01:39:32,100
Quit bitching.

1466
01:39:33,935 --> 01:39:36,479
For the road. It's chicory.

1467
01:39:36,771 --> 01:39:38,982
And beer for you.

1468
01:39:49,575 --> 01:39:51,911
We'll see you for vacations. Right?

1469
01:39:52,161 --> 01:39:56,082
The shouth isn't good as the north.
But it'sh not half bad.

1470
01:40:09,637 --> 01:40:10,805
Thanks for everything.

1471
01:40:11,347 --> 01:40:13,016
You don't have to thank me.

1472
01:40:16,644 --> 01:40:17,770
Yes, I do.

1473
01:40:18,313 --> 01:40:19,522
See? I was right.

1474
01:40:19,897 --> 01:40:20,857
About what?

1475
01:40:21,691 --> 01:40:25,695
A stranger in the north brays twice.
When he arrives, when he leaves.

1476
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:28,656
I'm not crying.

1477
01:40:28,948 --> 01:40:29,949
Yesh you are.

1478
01:40:32,285 --> 01:40:33,202
No, I'm not.

1479
01:40:33,619 --> 01:40:35,204
Yesh, you are.

1480
01:40:38,791 --> 01:40:40,418
No, you're not crying.

1481
01:41:06,986 --> 01:41:10,823
for my mother, Danièle, a wonderful Shti

1482
01:41:55,118 --> 01:41:56,619
Took the furniture?

1483
01:41:56,869 --> 01:41:58,663
For hish offish.

1484
01:41:59,998 --> 01:42:01,040
What fish?

1485
01:42:03,084 --> 01:42:04,002
Not furnished?

1486
01:42:04,252 --> 01:42:07,171
The old manager
took it with him.

1487
01:42:08,798 --> 01:42:09,882
Why?.

1488
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:16,306
Why give furniture to fish?

1489
01:42:21,019 --> 01:42:23,062
Fish, dish.
You all talk like that?

1490
01:42:23,313 --> 01:42:25,565
The Shtimis all talk Shtimi.

1491
01:42:25,815 --> 01:42:27,734
And Flemish, but hey.

1492
01:42:27,984 --> 01:42:29,110
Sorry.

1493
01:42:30,153 --> 01:42:33,573
Boubourse. Where I come from
we say a custayi.

1494
01:42:43,541 --> 01:42:44,500
Hi, biloute!

1495
01:43:34,217 --> 01:43:36,886
You better be happy.

1496
01:43:37,637 --> 01:43:39,347

1497
01:43:49,649 --> 01:43:51,150

Nice of you to come shee me.
Come in a minute.

1499
01:43:55,571 --> 01:43:57,573
No thanks,
but we have to go.

1500
01:43:57,824 --> 01:43:59,784
A little early for cocktails.

1501
01:44:00,034 --> 01:44:01,202
Not even coffee?

1502
01:44:01,452 --> 01:44:02,704
What?

1503
01:44:03,997 --> 01:44:05,289
What is it?

1504
01:44:05,707 --> 01:44:07,291
It's not a commercial.

1505
01:44:08,751 --> 01:44:09,794
Come in a minute.

1506
01:44:29,314 --> 01:44:32,567
Hello, zounds.
Philippe Abrams, bank manager.

1507
01:44:34,027 --> 01:44:36,279
Pastis, like home.

1508
01:44:37,196 --> 01:44:38,614
I'm not drinking.

1509
01:44:41,951 --> 01:44:43,119
Cut!

1510
01:44:44,245 --> 01:44:45,079
We can't.

1511
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:47,373
Just one. I'll close my eyes.

1512
01:45:15,777 --> 01:45:19,113
Annabelle Deconink,
I'm at the rigis...

1513
01:45:21,115 --> 01:45:22,241
Try it again.

1514
01:45:31,417 --> 01:45:33,252
Hi, honey. Not too thin.

1515
01:45:34,671 --> 01:45:35,922
Dad,

1516
01:45:36,547 --> 01:45:38,299
I don't want to lose my toes.

1517
01:45:38,633 --> 01:45:40,385
Why would you lose them?

1518
01:45:40,927 --> 01:45:41,928
North Pole.

1519
01:45:42,178 --> 01:45:44,931
It's not the North Pole.
It's the north.

1520
01:45:45,890 --> 01:45:47,225
What an idiot.

1521
01:45:49,018 --> 01:45:50,061
I'm at risk here.

1522
01:45:50,311 --> 01:45:51,562
What risk?. I didn't get it.

1523
01:45:51,813 --> 01:45:55,733
I've been busting my ass
in Salon for 11 years.

1524
01:45:58,486 --> 01:45:59,487
What?

1525
01:46:05,076 --> 01:46:07,328
Long live the Shtimis!

1526
