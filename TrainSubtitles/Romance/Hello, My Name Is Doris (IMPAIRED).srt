That is nice.
Has anyone called dibs on this yet?

1396
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,888
- Oh, take it. Just take it, okay?
- Thank you.

- Goodbye, Anne.

Goodbye? Where do you think you're going?

There's plenty of work to be done.
The day has barely begun.

Anne, I quit. Effective immediately.

I'm taking all my office supplies.

one more thing. This ball...

I wanted to say goodbye.

- I've been here too long...

to move on.

And I know I owe you an apology
for Thanksgiving.

John, I...

I wanna thank you for your friendship.

You know? And all the time...

1416
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,770
we did spend together. It was great.

And, um...

1418
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,964
I never meant to hurt anyone.

1419

I don't know, maybe this sounds crazy...

but why shouldn't we try
to make this work?
