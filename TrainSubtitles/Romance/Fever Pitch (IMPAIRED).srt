Right, now push up!
Out! Out!

505
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:33,321
That's it! Good lads.

506
00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:34,517
Offside, referee!

507
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:36,512
Offside!

508
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:37,557
Ref!

509
00:25:38,842 --> 00:25:40,753
Oi, ref, he was miles off.

510
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:42,241
lt's not M Y fault.

511
00:25:42,322 --> 00:25:44,233
Too good a coach for this level.

512
00:25:44,322 --> 00:25:45,755
What's the score?

513
00:25:45,842 --> 00:25:46,797
One-all.

514
00:25:48,162 --> 00:25:51,552
lf you count that POXY GOAL
they just scored.

515
00:25:51,642 --> 00:25:53,075
What's this, Cup or League?

516
00:25:53,162 --> 00:25:54,561
Cup, quarter-final.

517
00:25:54,642 --> 00:25:56,155
- How long left?
- Fifteen.

518
00:25:57,442 --> 00:26:00,354
l wanted to talk to you
about a vacancy.

519
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:02,876
Rosie Hunter's
handed in her notice.

520
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:05,874
l wondered whether you'd be
interested in applying.

521
00:26:05,962 --> 00:26:07,361
Head of Year?

522
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:08,557
Um...well...

523
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:11,076
Obviously not the most
attractive offer

524
00:26:11,162 --> 00:26:12,595
you've ever had.

525
00:26:12,682 --> 00:26:14,593
Come on, Ben! Get back with him!

526
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:15,717
Sorry, Ted.

527
00:26:15,802 --> 00:26:18,191
l haven't fired you
with enthusiasm.

528
00:26:18,282 --> 00:26:19,681
lt's a lot of work.

529
00:26:19,762 --> 00:26:21,673
What do l wanna
do more work for?

530
00:26:21,762 --> 00:26:22,717
More money?

531
00:26:22,802 --> 00:26:24,713
l've got enough to pay my rent,

532
00:26:24,802 --> 00:26:26,201
enough for my season ticket

533
00:26:26,282 --> 00:26:28,193
and a couple of records a month.

534
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:29,681
Got no family.

535
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:31,673
l'd like you to think about it.

536
00:26:31,762 --> 00:26:33,957
Sorry. There's nothing
to think about.

537
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:35,953
Come on, Sam! Put it away!

538
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:38,992
YES!

539
00:26:46,442 --> 00:26:47,875
[Paul] Why aren't adults

540
00:26:47,962 --> 00:26:50,396
supposed to go mad
about anything?

541
00:26:50,482 --> 00:26:52,393
You've got to keep a lid on it.

542
00:26:52,482 --> 00:26:53,881
And if you don't,

543
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:55,873
then people
are apparently entitled

544
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:57,680
to say what they like.

545
00:26:57,762 --> 00:27:00,196
You haven't grown up,
you're a moron.

546
00:27:00,282 --> 00:27:02,671
Your conversation
is trivial and boorish.

547
00:27:02,762 --> 00:27:05,196
You can't express
your emotional needs.

548
00:27:05,282 --> 00:27:07,193
You can't relate
to your children

549
00:27:07,282 --> 00:27:09,477
and you die -
lonely and miserable.

550
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:11,280
But you know, what the hell?

551
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:13,273
Every cloud has a silver lining.

552
00:27:13,442 --> 00:27:16,195
Not on your own.
How many more times?

553
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:19,194
You'll have to wait
until your father's over.

554
00:27:19,282 --> 00:27:21,955
So l'll get to Highbury
five times a year?

555
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,954
lt's not my fault
your father lives abroad.

556
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:27,954
Mum, they play 21 times a year

557
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:29,475
plus Cup matches. That's...

558
00:27:29,562 --> 00:27:31,473
Mum, why is Crossroads a motel?

559
00:27:31,562 --> 00:27:32,995
What d'you mean?

560
00:27:33,082 --> 00:27:34,674
Why isn't it just a hotel?

561
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:38,152
29! lf they get to
the League Cup semi-final,

562
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:39,880
the FA Cup quarter-final...

563
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:41,680
You can take your car there.

564
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:43,161
You forgot Europe.

565
00:27:43,242 --> 00:27:45,756
l don't know how many
games last season.

566
00:27:45,842 --> 00:27:46,752
Oh, yeah.

567
00:27:46,842 --> 00:27:48,241
That's another five games.

568
00:27:48,322 --> 00:27:51,234
That hotel in Devon,
we took our car.

569
00:27:51,322 --> 00:27:53,233
Every round is home and away.

570
00:27:53,322 --> 00:27:55,756
We had to leave it
in the car park.

571
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:58,072
Fives into thirty-five
goes seven.

572
00:27:58,162 --> 00:28:01,074
One-seventh of all
the home games. Pathetic!

573
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:02,561
Paul, in a motel,

574
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:05,361
you drive a car into a room!

575
00:28:05,442 --> 00:28:08,354
Say you only went to one-seventh

576
00:28:08,442 --> 00:28:10,114
your Choral Society

577
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:11,601
They'd throw you out.

578
00:28:11,682 --> 00:28:14,276
Arsenal won't throw you out.
They want your money.

579
00:28:14,362 --> 00:28:15,795
l've looked it up.

580
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:18,271
l can catch the 1 2.53
to Paddington,

581
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:20,080
be at Paddington by 1 .36,

582
00:28:20,162 --> 00:28:21,595
get the Circle and District

583
00:28:21,682 --> 00:28:23,593
and Metropolitan Line
to Kings Cross.

584
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:26,071
Then it's Caledonian Road,
Holloway Road,

585
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,596
Arsenal, third stop.
Be there 2.1 5, easy.

586
00:28:28,682 --> 00:28:31,116
For Christ's sake,
go if you want to.

587
00:28:31,202 --> 00:28:32,635
Yes! Thanks, Mum.

588
00:28:32,722 --> 00:28:34,633
[Sings] Charlie, Charlie,

589
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:36,633
Charlie, Charlie,

590
00:28:36,722 --> 00:28:40,032
Charlie's the King of Highbury.

591
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:41,555
Don't come runnin' to me

592
00:28:41,642 --> 00:28:43,360
if you get stabbed to death.

593
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:44,352
l won't.

594
00:28:44,442 --> 00:28:45,841
Jimmy Husband! Brilliant.

595
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:47,321
[Paul] lt's not easy

596
00:28:47,402 --> 00:28:49,120
to become a football fan.

597
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:50,635
lt takes years.

598
00:28:50,722 --> 00:28:52,633
But if you put in the hours,

599
00:28:52,722 --> 00:28:54,633
you're welcomed,
without question,

600
00:28:54,722 --> 00:28:56,155
into a new family.

601
00:28:56,242 --> 00:28:57,675
Except in this family,

602
00:28:57,762 --> 00:28:59,673
you care about the same people

603
00:28:59,762 --> 00:29:01,673
and hope for the same things.

604
00:29:01,762 --> 00:29:03,161
What's childish about that?

605
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:08,276
A terrible foul
by McLintock on Rocastle.

606
00:29:08,362 --> 00:29:10,796
He'll be lucky
to stay on the pitch.

607
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,281
lt wasn't THAT bad.

608
00:29:12,362 --> 00:29:15,274
lt was mistiming,
it wasn't malicious.

609
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:16,431
Bollocks!

610
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:19,434
So, that's a free kick
to 1 989 Arsenal

611
00:29:19,522 --> 00:29:21,001
and...Davis takes it.

612
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:22,037
And...

613
00:29:23,082 --> 00:29:24,197
Goal!

614
00:29:24,282 --> 00:29:26,000
And that's 1 989 Arsenal four,

615
00:29:26,082 --> 00:29:27,515
1 971 Arsenal, nil.

616
00:29:27,602 --> 00:29:29,991
Bob Wilson will be
bitterly disappointed

617
00:29:30,082 --> 00:29:31,515
with that one.

618
00:29:31,602 --> 00:29:34,275
This lot would never beat
the Double team

619
00:29:34,362 --> 00:29:35,795
four-nil at Subbuteo.

620
00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:37,315
lt's just l'm crap at it!

621
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:38,835
Should've chosen someone else.

622
00:29:38,922 --> 00:29:41,834
Who else played in yellow
and blue away strip?

623
00:29:41,922 --> 00:29:43,355
- Everton?
- Be Everton, then.

624
00:29:43,442 --> 00:29:45,353
OK. But this game's abandoned.

625
00:29:45,442 --> 00:29:47,353
l can't start
suddenly pretending

626
00:29:47,442 --> 00:29:50,354
that John Radford's Joe Royle.
lt'd do my head in.

627
00:29:50,442 --> 00:29:51,875
Have to start again.

628
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:52,872
Nil-nil.

629
00:29:54,162 --> 00:29:56,073
All right. Go on, then.

630
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:57,072
Yes!

631
00:30:00,762 --> 00:30:02,673
What are you thinking about?

632
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:07,311
- Oh...stuff.
- What stuff?

633
00:30:07,402 --> 00:30:10,075
l was thinking about
DH Lawrence, actually.

634
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:11,072
Yeah?

635
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:12,561
What about him?

636
00:30:13,642 --> 00:30:14,597
Well...

637
00:30:16,562 --> 00:30:18,473
Well...about his books.

638
00:30:19,762 --> 00:30:21,195
What about his books?

639
00:30:21,282 --> 00:30:23,876
Just...which one's the longest.

640
00:30:28,762 --> 00:30:29,717
And?

641
00:30:31,762 --> 00:30:33,161
l-l couldn't remember.

642
00:30:33,242 --> 00:30:36,154
Well, which one did
you think it might be?

643
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:38,676
That's just it.
l couldn't decide.

644
00:30:38,762 --> 00:30:40,161
Between what and what?

645
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:41,152
Mm...

646
00:30:45,562 --> 00:30:47,473
Well, ''Lady
Chatterley's Lover''...

647
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:50,076
- And...?
- And, um...

648
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:54,674
l wasn't thinking
about DH Lawrence at all.

649
00:30:54,762 --> 00:30:56,161
You amaze me.

650
00:30:56,242 --> 00:30:57,960
l was thinking about Arsenal.

651
00:30:58,042 --> 00:30:59,157
l'm staggered.

652
00:30:59,242 --> 00:31:01,676
We might win
the League this year.

653
00:31:01,762 --> 00:31:04,674
We're half-way through
the season and we're top

654
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:06,480
and they'll fuck it up but...

655
00:31:06,562 --> 00:31:08,280
You're not impressed, are you?

656
00:31:08,362 --> 00:31:11,274
l am. l hope
they win the League.

657
00:31:11,362 --> 00:31:12,761
lt's just that...

658
00:31:12,842 --> 00:31:14,241
Why did you lie?

659
00:31:15,762 --> 00:31:17,673
l've got to vary the answers.

660
00:31:17,762 --> 00:31:19,673
l can't say Arsenal every time.

661
00:31:23,162 --> 00:31:25,471
l can't find any...''Bread''.

662
00:31:25,562 --> 00:31:27,473
Do l look like the sort of man

663
00:31:27,562 --> 00:31:29,280
who'd have a ''Bread'' album?

664
00:31:29,362 --> 00:31:31,796
No, you look like
the kind of man

665
00:31:31,882 --> 00:31:33,793
who has a ''Bollock Brothers''
album.

666
00:31:33,882 --> 00:31:35,315
l wouldn't put that on.

667
00:31:35,402 --> 00:31:38,314
lt's a bit...not the right mood.

668
00:31:38,402 --> 00:31:39,357
Oh?

669
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:42,993
And what's the right mood?

670
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:46,273
Well, l don't know, just...

671
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,795
something...you know.

672
00:31:47,882 --> 00:31:48,837
What?

673
00:31:50,282 --> 00:31:51,715
You know, just...

674
00:31:51,802 --> 00:31:54,521
something not as...
sweary and loud.

675
00:31:56,562 --> 00:31:58,951
Paul, that's the most
romantic thing

676
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,953
you've ever said to me.

677
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:02,157
Shut up.

678
00:32:03,602 --> 00:32:04,796
[They giggle]

679
00:32:06,762 --> 00:32:08,718
[Sarah] By the way,
congratulations.

680
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:11,361
[Paul] On what?

681
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:12,875
Two-nil. Quinn and Dixon.

682
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:14,395
Goal in each half.

683
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:17,201
Top of the League.
Nine games to go.

684
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:19,193
George Graham sees no reason

685
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:22,718
why Arsenal shouldn't bring
the title back to Highbury

686
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:24,713
for the first time in 1 6 years.

687
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:25,712
1 8 years.

688
00:32:25,802 --> 00:32:27,713
l'm sure he said 1 6.

689
00:32:27,802 --> 00:32:29,713
Oh, right. Maybe l'm wrong.

690
00:32:29,802 --> 00:32:31,713
Yeah, OK, OK. 1 8. Whatever.

691
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:35,673
So, when does it all end?

692
00:32:35,762 --> 00:32:36,797
May.

693
00:32:36,882 --> 00:32:39,680
And what happens
then, in the summer?

694
00:32:39,762 --> 00:32:41,195
Just sit in the park

695
00:32:41,282 --> 00:32:44,194
and wait for the fixture
list to come out.

696
00:32:44,282 --> 00:32:46,193
So what about this summer?

697
00:32:46,282 --> 00:32:47,681
That's a good point.

698
00:32:47,762 --> 00:32:50,674
We might be
in the Charity Shield.

699
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:53,196
That isn't the point
l was making.

700
00:32:54,282 --> 00:32:57,991
We've been...
seeing each other -

701
00:32:58,082 --> 00:32:59,993
well, we've been
sleeping together

702
00:33:00,082 --> 00:33:01,515
for six months now.

703
00:33:01,602 --> 00:33:03,513
And we've never even planned

704
00:33:03,602 --> 00:33:05,035
a holiday together.

705
00:33:05,122 --> 00:33:07,556
lt's a miracle
if we plan a weekend

706
00:33:07,642 --> 00:33:09,041
before Friday afternoon.

707
00:33:09,122 --> 00:33:12,034
And yet you know
what Arsenal are doing

708
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:13,555
for months in advance.

709
00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:15,553
They produce a fixture list.

710
00:33:15,642 --> 00:33:17,553
Well, l can do that for you.

711
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:19,041
Give me your diary

712
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,033
and l'll put some dates in it.

713
00:33:21,122 --> 00:33:22,521
Don't be daft.

714
00:33:22,602 --> 00:33:24,001
What's daft about it?

715
00:33:24,082 --> 00:33:26,471
l don't really see
the difference.

716
00:33:29,962 --> 00:33:32,396
How about Saturday,
October the 8th?

717
00:33:32,482 --> 00:33:33,915
Let's go away somewhere.

718
00:33:34,002 --> 00:33:36,914
l haven't got next season's
fixture list yet.

719
00:33:37,002 --> 00:33:39,470
You know you're seeing
Arsenal next year.

720
00:33:39,562 --> 00:33:42,201
You can't say whether
you'll be seeing me.

721
00:33:42,282 --> 00:33:44,193
So what? Everyone's like that.

722
00:33:44,282 --> 00:33:47,672
You know you'll be seeing
your sister next season.

723
00:33:47,762 --> 00:33:49,161
Sisters don't have seasons.

724
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:50,197
Whatever.

725
00:33:50,282 --> 00:33:52,637
Look, l know where this is going

726
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:54,155
and you're dead wrong.

727
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:57,154
l'm capable of commitment
and all that stuff.

728
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:58,960
lf it doesn't happen with you,

729
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:00,760
that's because of you, not me.

730
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:03,675
21 years l've been
going to Arsenal.

731
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:04,717
21 years.

732
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:08,874
Paul, l don't know
whether you've noticed

733
00:34:08,962 --> 00:34:11,601
but Arsenal are a football team.

734
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:14,071
And you think
there's a difference?

735
00:34:14,162 --> 00:34:15,561
Yes, l do.

736
00:34:15,642 --> 00:34:18,076
That shows what
you know about it.

737
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:22,873
[TV] '..Will need a fitness test

738
00:34:22,962 --> 00:34:24,395
'shortly before kick-off.'

739
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:25,915
That looked like Rocky.

740
00:34:26,002 --> 00:34:28,436
Jo, go back to
the news a minute.

741
00:34:28,522 --> 00:34:30,240
lt's only the local news.

742
00:34:30,322 --> 00:34:32,472
l know. lt looked like Rocky.

743
00:34:32,562 --> 00:34:34,359
Who looked like Rocky?

744
00:34:34,442 --> 00:34:36,160
Who the hell is Rocky?

745
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:38,676
Doesn't matter.
We've missed it now.

746
00:34:41,682 --> 00:34:44,116
that ''Rocky''
is an Arsenal player.

747
00:34:44,202 --> 00:34:45,601
Yeah, David Rocastle.

748
00:34:45,682 --> 00:34:49,072
And how do you know
what he looks like?

749
00:34:49,162 --> 00:34:50,595
Well, l don't know.

750
00:34:50,682 --> 00:34:52,593
lt sinks in after a while.

751
00:34:52,682 --> 00:34:54,115
What else has sunk in?

752
00:34:54,202 --> 00:34:57,319
D'you know where they are
in the Championship Cup

753
00:34:57,402 --> 00:34:59,313
and who their best
goal-hanger is?

754
00:34:59,402 --> 00:35:01,358
l'm not turning into a moron.

755
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:04,115
OK, l know they're
top of the League.

756
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,635
That's easy to remember.

757
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:08,156
And l know that
Alan ''Smudger'' Smith

758
00:35:08,242 --> 00:35:10,153
has scored most of the goals.

759
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:11,675
But it doesn't...

760
00:35:11,762 --> 00:35:13,195
l'm going next week.

761
00:35:13,282 --> 00:35:14,192
You're going?

762
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:15,192
Yeah.

763
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:16,681
To a football match?

764
00:35:16,762 --> 00:35:18,673
Yeah. l thought l should.

765
00:35:18,762 --> 00:35:20,480
Ooh. l tell you, girl,

766
00:35:20,562 --> 00:35:22,280
you'd better watch yourself.

767
00:35:22,362 --> 00:35:24,398
Soon after Tim and l split up,

768
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:25,915
l woke up one morning

769
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:28,914
and realised l could
remember his batting average

770
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,435
for the previous season.

771
00:35:30,522 --> 00:35:32,114
Harmless enough, isn't it?

772
00:35:32,202 --> 00:35:33,112
No!

773
00:35:33,202 --> 00:35:34,920
lt's all a sinister form

774
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:36,435
of male manipulation.

775
00:35:36,522 --> 00:35:37,557
Rubbish!

776
00:35:37,642 --> 00:35:39,075
lt's true!

777
00:35:39,162 --> 00:35:40,595
You get colonised.

778
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:43,116
Your native culture
gets driven out

779
00:35:43,202 --> 00:35:45,113
and it's replaced by stuff

780
00:35:45,202 --> 00:35:47,318
you don't even wanna know about.

781
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:49,313
They're like
bloody missionaries.

782
00:35:49,402 --> 00:35:52,314
They bore you stupid
until you cave in

783
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,835
then they fuck off!

784
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,233
[Paul imitates Clangers]

785
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,277
Shut up!

786
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:01,721
Did you get it?

787
00:36:04,242 --> 00:36:05,152
Yes.

788
00:36:05,242 --> 00:36:06,675
Can l see it?

789
00:36:08,762 --> 00:36:10,195
lt's in me purse.

790
00:36:10,282 --> 00:36:11,715
Brilliant. Thanks, Mum.

791
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,714
l've got to do
an extra hour tomorrow.

792
00:36:14,802 --> 00:36:16,713
Left the office at twelve,

793
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:18,713
l didn't get back till three.

794
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,316
They asked you
what end you wanted?

795
00:36:21,402 --> 00:36:24,121
No. l said, ''One, please''
and they gave me that.

796
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:27,833
How comes you got a ticket

797
00:36:27,922 --> 00:36:29,355
in the Reading end?

798
00:36:29,442 --> 00:36:31,353
Had to get it off a tout.

799
00:36:31,442 --> 00:36:33,353
How much did that cost you?

800
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:34,352
Fiver.

801
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,875
D'you live in lslington?

802
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:37,395
Well, near, yeah.

803
00:36:37,482 --> 00:36:39,393
[Man] How near is near?

804
00:36:39,482 --> 00:36:40,995
Place called Maidenhead.

805
00:36:41,082 --> 00:36:41,992
Maidenhead?

806
00:36:42,082 --> 00:36:43,481
Maidenhead in Berkshire?

807
00:36:43,562 --> 00:36:45,314
Two miles down the road?

808
00:36:45,402 --> 00:36:46,835
More like six.

809
00:36:46,922 --> 00:36:48,799
Bit nearer Reading than Arsenal.

810
00:36:48,882 --> 00:36:51,794
You should be
supporting your local team.

811
00:36:51,882 --> 00:36:52,792
Look...

812
00:36:52,882 --> 00:36:54,031
Excuse me.

813
00:36:54,122 --> 00:36:55,794
Just seen someone l know.

814
00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:02,958
And was the ticket
all right, in the end?

815
00:37:03,042 --> 00:37:04,441
l was standing with a load

816
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:05,921
of country bumpkins at first.

817
00:37:06,002 --> 00:37:07,913
Then l found Jenkins and them.

818
00:37:08,002 --> 00:37:09,958
So you stood with Jenkins?

819
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:11,475
What would YOU know?

820
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,315
You must've been sick
when they equalised.

821
00:37:14,402 --> 00:37:15,835
l heard it on the radio.

822
00:37:15,922 --> 00:37:17,355
The place went mad.

823
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:19,398
Just had to stand and take it.

824
00:37:19,482 --> 00:37:21,040
Good old Pat Rice, though.

825
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:23,636
- He never scores, Pat Rice.
- First of the season.

826
00:37:23,722 --> 00:37:26,395
We're good in the Cups,
aren't we?

827
00:37:30,162 --> 00:37:31,595
McNab won't play.

828
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,593
Bertie Mee wouldn't risk him.

829
00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:36,594
How long will it take
to get to Birmingham?

830
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:38,593
Couple of hours. Maybe three.

831
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:40,400
But we'll be there by two?

832
00:37:40,482 --> 00:37:41,437
Oh, sure.

833
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,998

that doesn't work like that.

A world that doesn't stop in May

and begin again in August.

1000
00:46:46,202 --> 00:46:49,114
There's some stuff
that just never comes back.

1001
00:46:49,202 --> 00:46:52,114
And some stuff
that just won't go away.

1002
00:46:52,202 --> 00:46:55,114
And some stuff
that you couldn't ignore

1003
00:46:55,202 --> 00:46:56,635
even if you wanted to.

00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:06,677
Hello.

1006
00:47:06,762 --> 00:47:08,161
[Paul] 'lt's me.'

1007
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,153
Do you know what time it is?

1008
00:47:10,242 --> 00:47:11,641
'Yeah, and l'm sorry.'

1009
00:47:13,882 --> 00:47:15,281
Listen, are you pregnant?

1010
00:48:07,162 --> 00:48:08,561
Are these for me?

1011
00:48:11,162 --> 00:48:12,072
Yeah.

1012
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:15,552

1013
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,394
l suppose they were,

1014
00:48:17,482 --> 00:48:18,915
once upon a time.

1015
00:48:19,002 --> 00:48:19,912
Thank you.

1016
00:48:22,762 --> 00:48:24,161
Come on, Jo.

1017
00:48:29,242 --> 00:48:30,197
Oh.

00:48:33,162 --> 00:48:34,515
And chocolates!

1019

lt's come just at
the right time for me.

1020
00:48:40,962 --> 00:48:43,112
lt's come just at
the right time for me.

1021
00:48:43,202 --> 00:48:46,638
l was gettin' bored with
that pub and football stuff.

1022
00:48:46,722 --> 00:48:48,633
You can only spend so much time

1023
00:48:48,722 --> 00:48:49,996
playing Subbuteo.

1024
00:48:50,082 --> 00:48:52,198
Having a kid's a brilliant idea.

1025
00:48:52,282 --> 00:48:54,193
lt wasn't really an idea.

1026
00:48:54,282 --> 00:48:56,193
lt might as well have been.

1027
00:48:56,282 --> 00:48:57,476
lt's perfect.

lt's not just the baby.

it's you as well.

Miss Jean Brodie.

l was wrong.
l've been thinking about this.

00:49:10,122 --> 00:49:11,555
You're George Graham.

1034
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:14,315
The Arsenal manager.

1035
00:49:14,402 --> 00:49:16,313
And that's good, is it?

1036
00:49:16,402 --> 00:49:17,312
lt's brilliant.

1037
00:49:17,402 --> 00:49:18,835
You're careful and organised

1038
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,480
and methodical and all that.

1039
00:49:20,562 --> 00:49:21,995
That's why we work.

1040
00:49:22,082 --> 00:49:23,754
l need somebody like that.

1041
00:49:23,842 --> 00:49:25,753
And you need somebody
like me....

1042
00:49:25,842 --> 00:49:27,241
Work well as a team.

1043
00:49:27,322 --> 00:49:29,040
Not even as a team, as a club.

1044
00:49:29,122 --> 00:49:31,955
Paul, you do talk
some terrible nonsense.

1045
00:49:32,042 --> 00:49:33,475
lt's not. lt's the truth.

1046

lt's all working out.

1047

Wife and baby, that'll do me.

1048
00:49:36,922 --> 00:49:39,231
Who said anything about a wife?

1049
00:49:39,322 --> 00:49:42,234
We'd want to do it
properly, wouldn't we?

1050
00:49:42,322 --> 00:49:43,755
Liam? lf it's a boy.

1051
00:49:43,842 --> 00:49:46,072
The greatest Arsenal player ever

1052
00:49:46,162 --> 00:49:47,595
but it's a nice name.

1053
00:49:47,682 --> 00:49:49,354
Better apply for the job.

1054
00:49:49,442 --> 00:49:50,477
What job?

1055
00:49:50,562 --> 00:49:52,951
Rosie's Head of Year
job. l said no -

1056
00:49:53,042 --> 00:49:55,158
but now, brilliant.
Perfect timing.

1057
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,153
We'll need a bit more money

1058
00:49:57,242 --> 00:49:58,960
'cause we'll need a house.

1059
00:49:59,042 --> 00:50:00,953
- Paul...
- Ted'll be pleased, anyway.

1060
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:02,475
- Liam, brilliant.
- Paul...

1061
00:50:02,562 --> 00:50:04,200
We could live near the ground.

1062
00:50:04,282 --> 00:50:07,672
lt's cheap 'cause no-one
wants a football stadium

1063
00:50:07,762 --> 00:50:09,673
on their doorstep.
l'd pay extra

1064
00:50:09,762 --> 00:50:11,673
but we won't tell
the estate agent.

1065

Mortgage, wife, kid - cool.

1066
00:50:13,242 --> 00:50:15,153
Paul, none of this is real.

1067
00:50:15,242 --> 00:50:17,631
You're behaving
like a little kid.

1068
00:50:17,722 --> 00:50:20,634
l've been impregnated
by a 1 2-year-old!

1069
00:50:28,322 --> 00:50:29,437
Oh, thanks.

1070
00:50:29,522 --> 00:50:30,955
Thanks very much.

1071
00:50:31,042 --> 00:50:32,441
Sorry about that.

1072
00:50:32,522 --> 00:50:33,921
No problem, sir.

1073
00:50:35,362 --> 00:50:36,795
Sorry, you were saying?

1074
00:50:36,882 --> 00:50:39,680
Paul, this is exactly
what l mean.

1075
00:50:39,762 --> 00:50:42,560
That was just a one-off.
Never happened before.

1076
00:50:42,642 --> 00:50:45,475
l promise it won't be
a regular feature of life.

1077
00:50:52,922 --> 00:50:53,832
Paul...

1078
00:50:53,922 --> 00:50:55,833
l haven't made up my mind

1079
00:50:55,922 --> 00:50:57,833
what l'm doing about this yet.

1080
00:50:59,442 --> 00:51:00,875
Do you understand?

1081
00:51:02,762 --> 00:51:03,717
Yes.

1082
00:51:05,682 --> 00:51:07,115
No, not really.

1083
00:51:07,202 --> 00:51:08,920
l can't see this working out.

1084
00:51:09,002 --> 00:51:11,436
- lt's my last chance.
- Don't be silly.

1085
00:51:11,522 --> 00:51:13,433
lt's just what it feels like.

1086
00:51:13,522 --> 00:51:16,434
Are you prepared
to be a one-parent family?

1087
00:51:16,522 --> 00:51:18,672
l think if we go
through with this,

1088
00:51:18,762 --> 00:51:20,673
one of us is gonna have to be.

1089
00:51:20,762 --> 00:51:22,195
No, it'll be brilliant.

1090
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:26,915
l don't think l've been

1091
00:51:27,002 --> 00:51:29,436
since George Eastham
was in the team.

1092
00:51:29,522 --> 00:51:30,955
Before my time.

1093
00:51:31,042 --> 00:51:32,760
He was a lovely player.

1094
00:51:32,842 --> 00:51:34,753
The sort you don't get
any more.

1095
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,753
Languid and thoughtful
and elegant.

1096
00:51:36,842 --> 00:51:39,754
You should come
and watch Tony Adams.

1097
00:51:39,842 --> 00:51:41,275
How can l help, anyway?

1098
00:51:41,362 --> 00:51:44,274
l changed my mind about
that Head of Year job,

1099
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:45,795
if it's not too late.

1100
00:51:45,882 --> 00:51:48,316
No. No, excellent.
l'm very pleased.

1101
00:51:48,402 --> 00:51:50,313
l've had a couple
of applications

1102
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:52,836
but l'd be glad
to add your name.

1103
00:51:52,922 --> 00:51:53,832
Thank you.

1104
00:51:53,922 --> 00:51:55,355
Any particular reason

1105
00:51:55,442 --> 00:51:56,955
for the change of mind?

1106
00:51:57,042 --> 00:51:58,475
There is, actually, yes.

1107
00:51:58,562 --> 00:51:59,995
Er, Miss, um...

1108
00:52:00,082 --> 00:52:01,993
Well, Miss Hughes is pregnant.

1109
00:52:03,082 --> 00:52:04,515
Sarah Hughes? History?

1110
00:52:04,602 --> 00:52:06,035
Yes, yes, of course.

1111
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,033
Um... Well, l didn't, um...

1112
00:52:08,122 --> 00:52:09,555
l mean, she...

1113
00:52:09,642 --> 00:52:11,553
How does this affect you?

1114
00:52:11,642 --> 00:52:13,553
Sorry, no. l left a bit out.

1115
00:52:13,642 --> 00:52:15,041
l'm the father.

1116
00:52:15,122 --> 00:52:17,033
l should've told you that

1117
00:52:17,122 --> 00:52:18,521
straight away, shouldn't l?

1118
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,991
Anyway, yes,
we're having a baby.

1119
00:52:21,082 --> 00:52:22,993
l haven't heard this from her.

1120
00:52:23,082 --> 00:52:24,993
You're hearing it
from me, now.

1121
00:52:25,082 --> 00:52:27,516
Sorry, Paul,
l can't share your joy.

1122
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:30,036
Sarah's been
with us five minutes

1123
00:52:30,122 --> 00:52:33,034
and a member of staff
has knocked her up!

1124
00:52:33,122 --> 00:52:36,034
l'm intending
to marry her and everything.

1125
00:52:36,122 --> 00:52:37,555
We won't embarrass the school.

1126
00:52:37,642 --> 00:52:40,031
You already have
embarrassed the school!

1127
00:52:40,122 --> 00:52:44,035
How on earth are we
supposed to talk to kids

1128
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:46,033
about responsibility
and contraception

1129
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:47,840
and...and the rest of it

1130
00:52:47,922 --> 00:52:49,355
when the staff themselves...

1131
00:52:51,162 --> 00:52:52,595
Words fail me!

1132
00:52:52,682 --> 00:52:54,957
- l thought you'd be pleased.
- About what?

1133
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:57,795
The clandestine affair?
The accidental pregnancy?

1134
00:52:57,882 --> 00:52:59,281
Not those bits, maybe,

1135
00:52:59,362 --> 00:53:01,080
but me applying for the job.

1136
00:53:01,162 --> 00:53:02,595
That's good, isn't it?

1137
00:53:02,682 --> 00:53:04,593
Are you a complete fool, Paul?

1138
00:53:06,962 --> 00:53:08,714
l'll talk to you later.

1139
00:53:10,842 --> 00:53:12,275
Yeah, OK, OK.

1140
00:53:12,362 --> 00:53:13,636
Calm down.

1141
00:53:13,722 --> 00:53:16,634
l want you to take
your foot off the gas

1142

of beating a team

00:53:23,562 --> 00:53:26,474
All right.
Just take it easy, eh?

1147
00:53:26,562 --> 00:53:27,995
You're like vultures.

1148
00:53:28,082 --> 00:53:29,515
Now go on!

1149
00:53:29,602 --> 00:53:31,035
Come on, lads!

1150
00:53:47,202 --> 00:53:48,112
Oh, hi.

Are you a complete fool?

1156
00:53:56,002 --> 00:53:57,435
You've been to see Ted.

1157
00:53:57,522 --> 00:53:59,433
He's not best pleased with us.

1158

Sorry, not about the job.

About what's going on
down the road.

Oh, right.

Well, er...so far, so good.

Er, North Bank.

Right, shall we, um...?

Who d'you think we should sign?

1338
01:01:35,122 --> 01:01:36,840
Think we need a new striker?

1339
01:01:36,922 --> 01:01:38,037
Er...

1340
01:01:38,122 --> 01:01:41,034

we should, um...

Oh, sorry, Ted.

1343

Once you get going,
it's hard to stop.

are you involved in?

1347

[Ray] Paul's just coached

1348
01:01:55,522 --> 01:01:57,433
the Under-1 4s to the Cup Final.

1349
01:01:57,522 --> 01:02:00,116
My Nigel thinks
you should be England Manager.

1350
01:02:00,202 --> 01:02:04,081
Might be a more suitable
position than Head of Year.

1351
01:02:04,162 --> 01:02:06,881
l did the school play
last summer and...

1352

Pretty good.

about that more?

No, you care more about one team

to comfort you about that?

anyone could say!

1464

isn't only a game.

01:06:39,002 --> 01:06:40,913
D'you know what you wanted

1470

1 8 years ago?

1471
01:06:42,482 --> 01:06:43,881
Or ten? Or five?

1472
01:06:43,962 --> 01:06:45,873

at a North London comprehensive?

1474
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:51,352

anything for that long.

1476

thinking that finally
you were gonna get it

1478

and just when
you think it's there,

Oh, yeah?

1969
01:30:00,722 --> 01:30:02,155
You're a lying bastard.

1970
01:30:02,242 --> 01:30:03,675
No, no, honestly.

1971
01:30:03,762 --> 01:30:05,195
On the surface,

1972
01:30:05,282 --> 01:30:07,193
l was all negativity and doubt.

1973
01:30:07,282 --> 01:30:10,399
But on the inside,
you gotta believe, haven't you?

PAUL!

01:31:46,962 --> 01:31:48,395
Friend of yours?

1994
01:31:49,482 --> 01:31:51,393
A guy l work with.

Yeah.

[Paul] When l think back

1999
01:32:34,562 --> 01:32:36,473
to the 26th of May, 1 989 now,

2000
01:32:36,562 --> 01:32:37,995
it's impossible to explain

2001
01:32:38,082 --> 01:32:40,516
exactly what happened
to either of us.

2002
01:32:40,602 --> 01:32:43,514
All three of us
if you count the team.

2003
01:32:43,602 --> 01:32:45,194
But l do know this -

2004
01:32:45,282 --> 01:32:48,194
my relationship
with Arsenal changed that night.

2005
01:32:48,282 --> 01:32:51,194
lt was as if l'd jumped on
to the shoulders of the team

2006
01:32:51,282 --> 01:32:53,716
and they'd carried me
into the light

2007
01:32:53,802 --> 01:32:56,714
that had suddenly
shone down on all of us.

2008
01:32:56,802 --> 01:32:58,520
And the lift they gave me

2009
01:32:58,602 --> 01:33:02,038
enabled be to part company
with them in some ways.

2010
01:33:02,122 --> 01:33:05,034
We still see
each other all the time

2011
01:33:05,122 --> 01:33:07,841
and l still love them
and hate them.

2012
01:33:07,922 --> 01:33:09,833
But l have my own life now.

2013
01:33:09,922 --> 01:33:11,355
My successes and failures

2014
01:33:11,442 --> 01:33:13,831
aren't necessarily
linked up with theirs.

2015
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:16,834
That's got to be
a good thing, l suppose.

2016
01:33:16,922 --> 01:33:19,641
Life's never
gonna be this good again.

2017

Fuck off. Don't start on me.

No, you don't get...

2019
01:33:23,202 --> 01:33:25,113
- What's his name?
- Michael Thomas.

2020
01:33:25,202 --> 01:33:28,114
You don't get Michael Thomas
moments in real life.

2021
01:33:28,202 --> 01:33:30,636
You don't get many
in football, either.

2022

l'm not in such a state, am l?

2023

l didn't need saving after all.

You're still
a tragic human being.

Do we look particularly
tragic tonight?

All too busy writing out
tomorrow's lesson plans.

2031

Where did you find
the term ''lesson plan''?

2032
01:33:52,682 --> 01:33:54,593
You've never planned a lesson.

No reason.

2038
01:34:07,962 --> 01:34:10,874
Has somebody else
noticed the resemblance?

2039
01:34:10,962 --> 01:34:12,361
Yeah. My fifth-formers.
