00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:04,277
First off, in our initial
conversations about exclusivity

160
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:08,081
I distinctly recall you saying
something about "staying casual," yeah?

161
00:08:08,082 --> 00:08:09,649
- I only said that...
- Most likely because you thought

162
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:11,084
that was what I wanted to hear, yes?

163
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:14,121
- Yes.
- Okay. Well, me taking you at your word

164
00:08:14,122 --> 00:08:16,923
doesn't make me an asshole, it
does however make you a liar.

165
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:18,657
Ugh! You're such a piece of shit...

166
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:21,560
Hey. Second... second point. Okay?

167
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:24,064
If you really, actually wanted monogamy

168
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:27,535
why have casual sex
with me for three months?

169
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:30,804
You know, I mean, If you wanna grow
flowers, you don't plant 'em in a closet.

170
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:35,975
So either you're stupid or deep down
inside you don't want monogamy either.

171
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:38,078
You fucked my best friend.

172
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:40,613
Which brings me to my
third and final point.

173
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:43,750
Your chief complaint is
not that I screwed someone

174
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:45,718
it is <i>who</i> I screwed.

175
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:47,621
That's what it's about, right?

176
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:50,623
So much like your, uh,
the counter-intuitive plan

177
00:08:50,624 --> 00:08:52,660
to secure an exclusive relationship

178
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:54,828
with a guy that you
don't actually wanna date.

179
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:57,130
<i>Moi.</i> Your issue with me and Sarah...

180
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:58,366
- Do not say her name.
- Was a lot...

181
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:02,803
Your issue with us is purely
driven by a societal insecurity.

182
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:06,740
Not to mention, a culturally
infused female competition.

183
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:09,043
Oh! My heart goes out to you ladies.

184
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:11,977
Baby, you're a bad liar.

185
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:14,346
You're not stupid.

186
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:18,017
And she can't hold a candle to you.

187
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:19,819
Can we please go home?

188
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,088
Please?

189
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:24,024
You know, get out of these wet clothes.

190
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:26,449
And dry each other off using friction.

191
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:30,896
Yeah?

192
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:33,732
- Yeah.
- Good.

193
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:34,790
Whoa!

194

[sirens wailing]

195
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,141
- You got a girlfriend, Charles?
- No.

196
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:45,044

197
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:47,714
Be careful.

198
00:09:47,715 --> 00:09:49,505
- You know?
- Why?

199
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:53,708
I don't know if I have time to answer that.

200
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:02,630
Wow. Bathroom fucking stinks.

201
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:05,932
Um, what were we talking
about? So I said to Jack.

202
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:09,302
I said, "Jack, Lainey and
I, we're looking to buy.

203
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:11,905
Maybe have a kid."

204
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:14,007
I hope it's okay that
I said that, by the way.

205
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:16,043
I mean, you haven't changed
your mind or anything, have you?

206
00:10:16,044 --> 00:10:18,211
Because I know you don't
wanna get married, but you know

207
00:10:18,212 --> 00:10:20,713
I do think it's important we make
some sort of commitment to each other

208
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:24,683
and I think buying a
place, maybe Kensington

209
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:26,686
maybe Prospect Heights.

210
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:29,054
What's up, little nugget, what
are you doing with the notebook?

211
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:31,724
Sam. I have to read you something.

212
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:34,261
You've been writing again?

213
00:10:34,262 --> 00:10:36,796
- Sweetie, that's great!
- No...

214
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:38,130
- I was never writing.
- Honey, yes!

215
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:40,400
- It was one short story...
- Yes! That is great!

00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:42,301
No, listen. Listen...

217

I wanna tell you something, look at me.

218

Look at me, okay? I know you love teaching.

219
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,176
But that's not a real thing. I
mean, this is great. This is...

220
00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:52,245
Can you please just not interrupt
me while I read this, please.

221
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:54,346
- Just listen to it. Let me get through all of it.
- I won't.

222
00:10:54,347 --> 00:10:56,149
I don't think I interrupt you, but go on.

- Don't.
- I don't.

- Please don't interrupt.
- I would love to hear it.

- Oh, I didn't do that.

No, alright. The problem isn't sex.

♪ And I know the party is over ♪♪

465
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:34,183
You have lipstick on your teeth.

466
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,564
- Thank you.
- This is my wife! This is Blainey.

467
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:40,865
- Lainey. Lainey... with an L.
- Oh.

468
00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:43,457
What's wrong with you?

469
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:45,970
- Never make it end.
- This is, uh, Lainey! Lainey, Naomi.

470
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:48,908
- Oh, may God.
- This is my wife.

471
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:51,811
Shots. I'm getting everybody shot. Shots
for all round. We're going to keep it going.

472
00:25:51,812 --> 00:25:54,046
Top shelf, bro, because
we're rich as shit now.

473
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:56,849
- Okay, stop screaming that.
- Rich as shit!

474
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,018
I'm telling you, someone's gonna
murder us if you keep screaming...

475
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:05,024
I don't care. We're in a cool
bar. I just bought a Tesla!

476
00:26:05,025 --> 00:26:07,927
That's not true. We are borrowing
a Tesla to see if we like it.

477
00:26:07,928 --> 00:26:10,862
- Yeah.
- Listen, are you guys, um...

478
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:13,165
- Are you guys sleeping with each other?
- No.

479
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:15,868
- Oh, good. Oh, my God, good.
- What're you guys talking about?

480
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:17,937
I'm telling her not to
have sex with you! Sorry.

481
00:26:17,938 --> 00:26:21,596
Oh, yeah, well you're too late! 'Cause
we lost our virginity to each other!

482
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:25,143
- Are you serious?
- You didn't know.

483
00:26:25,144 --> 00:26:28,380
- Yeah, I told him earlier.
- We all knew. You didn't know!

484
00:26:28,382 --> 00:26:30,616
- That's a beautiful story.
- Yeah.

485
00:26:30,617 --> 00:26:32,250
- So romantic.
- Right!

486
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:33,885
Here we go. Bring it in.

487
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:36,089
- To virginity!
- To virginity!

488
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,813
Get lost.

489
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,660
- Here we go.
- I gotta go. I just gonna go outside for a...

490
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:45,930
That was good. Naomi still
has her anal virginity.

491
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:48,634
That's not true. A lot of guys
have been up there, just not you.

492
00:26:48,635 --> 00:26:50,169
Oh, wait, wait. Girl, girl, girl...

493
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,104
- Lainey, her name's Lainey.
- Lainey. Lainey, I'm sorry.

494
00:26:52,105 --> 00:26:54,273
Quick question before
you walk out the door...

495
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:59,245
Are you the reason that my friend Jake
here is like, the biggest slut in the world?

496
00:26:59,246 --> 00:27:01,213
- What are you doing?
- I'm saying, like

497
00:27:01,214 --> 00:27:03,416
he puts his dick in like,
every sticky hole he finds.

498
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:05,217
- That's not true.
- It gross.

499
00:27:05,218 --> 00:27:06,352
- Xander.
- But like I'm jels.

500
00:27:06,353 --> 00:27:08,687
Come on.

501
00:27:08,688 --> 00:27:10,355
- No, I'm just kidding.
- I don't know. I don't know.

502
00:27:10,356 --> 00:27:12,056
I'm just kidding. I know it's
not you. I know it's not you.

503
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:14,360
- I know it's because his dad molested him.
- What?

504
00:27:14,361 --> 00:27:16,728
- What?
- Now everybody knows!

505
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:18,031
He was a boy scout leader.

506
00:27:18,032 --> 00:27:20,900
- Yeah.
- Bro, you're welcome. You're welcome.

507
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:23,135
- How am I welcome?
- I just set that up for you.

508
00:27:23,136 --> 00:27:25,271
- Wait a minute, where is she going?
- Yeah, don't let her get away.

509
00:27:25,272 --> 00:27:28,006
Dude, you gotta chase after her.

510
00:27:28,007 --> 00:27:31,075
- She's your lobster, man.
- I know. Okay, alright.

511
00:27:31,077 --> 00:27:33,211
She seems...

512
00:27:33,212 --> 00:27:34,313
- Awesome.
- Amazing.

513
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:37,149
Hey, Lainey!

514
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,084
- What are you doin'? Where are you going?
- Sorry, sorry, yeah.

515
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:42,921
I just... I wanna thank you
for tonight. It was great.

516
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:45,890
Just go... go in and have
fun with your friends.

517
00:27:45,891 --> 00:27:48,760
I just... I Facebooked
you because I thought...

518
00:27:48,761 --> 00:27:50,763
I should start dating again, I'm
trying to get over this guy...

519
00:27:50,764 --> 00:27:52,488
Was this supposed to be a date?

520
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:56,168
Oh shit, it was...

521
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:59,304
Oh hell. I'm an idiot,
I'm sorry, I'm a dick.

522
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:01,907
I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't know. I...

523
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:03,175
Well, hey... hey, how
about we go on a date?

524
00:28:03,176 --> 00:28:05,044
This is a date now. We'll go out.

525
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:07,112
- So now it's...
- Yeah, it's a date. Let's go on a date.

526
00:28:07,113 --> 00:28:09,915
This is good. I'll go inside,
I'm gonna get my jacket

527
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:13,986
then I'll come out and
we'll, uh... date it up.

528
00:28:13,987 --> 00:28:17,957
<i>Matthew Sobvechik? That guy had all
the charm of a broken Etch a sketch.</i>

529
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:21,494
It feels so freeing to tell someone
about it. Who actually knows him.

530
00:28:21,495 --> 00:28:24,764
Okay, you're gonna have to explain
this to me. I mean, is he packing? Huh?

531
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:26,931
Is that what's going on?
Does it tip in hundreds?

532
00:28:26,932 --> 00:28:28,801
Read you the Polar Express before bedtime?

533
00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:30,768
You know, it's pretty average actually.

534
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:34,106
Ah, Goddammit! Even his junk is boring.

535
00:28:34,107 --> 00:28:37,110
God damn boring dick!

536
00:28:37,111 --> 00:28:40,012
That's so weird, and
you're a catch! It's true.

537
00:28:40,013 --> 00:28:43,015
You know, I'm serious. You've
got a strong vocabulary.

538
00:28:43,016 --> 00:28:46,307
You look dynamite in a tank
top. It's just... what gives?

539
00:28:46,754 --> 00:28:47,842
I guess...

540
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:54,959
I guess, I just thought
eventually he'd choose me.

541
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,830
- Mm-hmm.
- And so I always chose him.

542
00:28:57,831 --> 00:29:00,999
If he texted I'd think of
an excuse. I'd lie, I'd...

543
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,003
- That's psychotic.
- Mm. Thanks.

544
00:29:04,004 --> 00:29:05,970
Well, I mean it's not your fault.

545
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:07,907
You know, little girls are told

546
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:10,176
that someday they're gonna find the one.

547
00:29:10,177 --> 00:29:11,811
What they don't tell
you guys is that the one

548
00:29:11,812 --> 00:29:13,079
might be a complete fucking dickhead

549
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,948
with a boring heroin penis that
turns you all into a sex addict

550
00:29:15,949 --> 00:29:17,016
that's what they leave
out in the Disney movies...

551
00:29:17,017 --> 00:29:18,217
I'm not sex addict.

552
00:29:18,218 --> 00:29:19,317
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Me neither.

553
00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:20,419
I went to a few meetings

554
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,986
because my therapist suggested

555
00:29:21,987 --> 00:29:24,055
that I go, that it... that it might help.

556
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:26,524
- But it didn't, so I stopped.
- Okay.

557
00:29:26,525 --> 00:29:28,259
What's your excuse?

558
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,829
- Me?
- Yeah.

559
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,862
My girlfriend said if I didn't go

560
00:29:30,863 --> 00:29:31,930
she'd break up with me.

561
00:29:31,931 --> 00:29:33,099
So I went to a meeting.

562
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,793
She broke up with me anyway. I'm cured.

563
00:29:35,794 --> 00:29:38,317
- Well why did she want you to go?
- I don't know.

564
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:46,512
She... some have suggested

565
00:29:46,513 --> 00:29:50,048
that I have a little bit of
a problem staying faithful

566
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:53,352
for long periods of
time... Or possibly at all.

567
00:29:53,353 --> 00:29:56,455
Oh. And it all comes out.

568
00:29:56,456 --> 00:30:01,193
Look, once I come to the
realization that I'm with...

569
00:30:01,194 --> 00:30:02,527
...the wrong girl...

570
00:30:02,528 --> 00:30:04,563
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't know how to end it.

571
00:30:04,564 --> 00:30:08,399
- So you sabotage it by sleeping with other people?
- Mm. Exactly.

572
00:30:08,401 --> 00:30:11,469
Yeah. Obviously they get upset

573
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,606
but then comes the whole rigmarole
of, like, "You're afraid to commit"

574
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:17,476
and it's like "No, I just
don't wanna commit to you."

575
00:30:17,477 --> 00:30:20,044
But I can't say that, because
that's, like, mean on top of mean.

576
00:30:20,045 --> 00:30:22,014
You know, so it's "No, no,
no. It's not you, it's me.

577
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:25,284
I don't like you."

578
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:27,186
- You know, like that.
- Yeah, that's harsh.

579
00:30:27,187 --> 00:30:28,888
- That's harsh, right You can't say that.
- That's pretty harsh.

580
00:30:28,889 --> 00:30:31,524
So instead I'd rather
just say something like...

581
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:32,891
"I fucked your sister."

582
00:30:32,892 --> 00:30:35,460
- Much better.
- Well, it's honest.

583
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:38,063
You have to fuck the sister
in order for it to work.

584
00:30:38,065 --> 00:30:40,064
- It's like I'd rather...
- Be the bad guy than tell the truth.

585
00:30:40,065 --> 00:30:43,357
- See. You get it.
- Oh, yeah. But I'm psychotic.

586
00:30:45,305 --> 00:30:47,473
But like an approachable psychotic.

587
00:30:47,474 --> 00:30:50,074
- That's the thing I don't think I mentioned earlier.
- You like it?

588
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:52,378
Yeah, it's like... it's
like Ted Bundy, you know.

589
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:54,979
You can't get him into a
van by just being a jerk.

590
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,181
You've got to have a certain...

591
00:30:56,182 --> 00:30:58,350
...way about you.

592
00:30:58,351 --> 00:31:00,919
- Appetite?
- That would be... that would be something.

593
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,189
- Yes, yes, yes.
- I'm hungry again.

594
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,056
Already?

595
00:31:05,057 --> 00:31:07,959
Well, you know, that's Dim Sum for you.

596
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,128
- I have snacks... I have snacks at home.
- Yeah.

597
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:11,596
I have, uh, this is
actually... This is my train.

598
00:31:11,597 --> 00:31:12,965
- What here? Oh, yeah, yeah.
- So...

599
00:31:12,966 --> 00:31:14,300
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Alright.

600
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:16,267
So, I'll probably gonna hit the road.

601
00:31:16,268 --> 00:31:18,670
- Yeah.
- Jake, thank you.

602
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:20,973
- Yeah.
- Oh.

603
00:31:20,974 --> 00:31:23,575
Hey, this was a... We did
it. That was a good date.

604
00:31:23,576 --> 00:31:26,312
- We did the date.
- You know, I think it was the first...

605
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:27,979
I think it might have been the
first date I've ever been on

606
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,114
so I don't really have
much to compare it to

607
00:31:29,115 --> 00:31:30,381
but, you know, it seemed solid.

608
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:31,417
- Good.
- Yeah.

609
00:31:31,418 --> 00:31:33,651
- Okay.
- Yeah.

610
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:35,220
Shit.

611
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:37,523
What?

612
00:31:37,524 --> 00:31:40,081
I, uh, I want to fuck you.

613
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:41,659
- What?
- I know.

614
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,362
- No!
- What do you mean no?

615
00:31:43,363 --> 00:31:46,297
What? What? What did I do?

616
00:31:46,298 --> 00:31:47,932
- Stop wanting to.
- I mean, are you kidding me?

617
00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:49,468
It's kinda hard. I mean, look at you.

618
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:51,704
I mean, you're so pretty
and you're vulnerable

619
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:53,538
and it's just like you might as
well be wearing a sign that says

620
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:54,672
"Solve my problems with your penis, Jake."

621
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:57,275
Jake, we just spent the
entire evening talking about

622
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:59,644
how we screw up every sexual
relationship we've ever have.

623
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:03,716
I know, I... I right. I mean, and yet
here I am like wanting... just now.

624
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:06,352
So, maybe... we gotta just be friends.

625
00:32:06,353 --> 00:32:10,588
Yes, that is the mature,
responsible thing to do, uh...

626
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:12,991
...for each other and
ourselves, yes I agree.

627
00:32:12,992 --> 00:32:14,592
Okay, but then we've got
to come up with a system.

628
00:32:14,593 --> 00:32:16,161
- If we're gonna be friends, you know...
- Okay.

629
00:32:16,162 --> 00:32:17,996
- And I want to be good friends...
- It's fair.

630
00:32:17,997 --> 00:32:22,066
So, maybe we come up with a safe word

631
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:24,335
for if we're having sexual tension
and then we'll stop whatever...

632
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:25,404
So, if you're doing something
sexy or I'm doing something sexy.

633
00:32:25,405 --> 00:32:27,672
- Or feeling attracted.
- Okay, but it's mutual?

634
00:32:27,673 --> 00:32:29,007
- So it is mutual?
- The word.

635
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:30,375
You're saying it's mutual?

636
00:32:30,376 --> 00:32:32,343
- It could be mutual.
- That's a yes.

637
00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:34,279
- I may or may not need to use the word.
- That's a yes.

638
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,414
- We'll have to see in the future...
- Hmm. Okay, alright.

639
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:37,550
Well, let's... well, alright.
Say, uh, say it for me.

640
00:32:37,551 --> 00:32:38,685
- Uh, yeah. Anything.
- Let's go, come up with one. What you got.

641
00:32:38,686 --> 00:32:40,986
I'll do anything. What do
you... You pick it, and yes.

642
00:32:40,987 --> 00:32:42,487
- It's Avocado.
- No. Can't do that.

643
00:32:42,488 --> 00:32:45,224
- No. It's an immediate veto?
- No, no, no.

644
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:47,025
Well, I mean, it's too
sexual. It's too sexual. Uh...

645
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:49,327
- "Avocado" is too sexual?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

646
00:32:49,328 --> 00:32:51,996
I mean... I mean you've got to see the
way I eat an avocado and you'll be like...

647
00:32:51,997 --> 00:32:53,666
That's like... You know, do that to me.

648
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:57,236
- It's like Guam.
- Guam? Like the country Guam? No!

649
00:32:57,237 --> 00:32:59,337
No, I knew a girl whose
father was from Guam

650
00:32:59,338 --> 00:33:01,439
and she literally had one
of the best natural bodies

651
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,341

652

Noodle salad.

653
00:33:03,641 --> 00:33:05,176
"Noodle salad?" that's a sex thing.

654
00:33:05,177 --> 00:33:06,276
- That's a... that's...
- What?

655
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:08,080
That's a bunch of guys putting

656
00:33:08,081 --> 00:33:09,280
flaccid dicks into someone's mouth.

657
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:10,516
That's... that's called a noddle salad.

658

be perceived as sexual.

- Mm-hmm, something extra.

about taking a road trip?

765
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:07,612
At least respond so I
know you're alive and okay.

Seriously, are you okay?

00:38:10,516 --> 00:38:11,817
I was on the subway, did you text me?

769
00:38:11,818 --> 00:38:13,886
Fuck me then ignore me. Nice one, Jake!

I have chlamydia. Okay, I was joking!

772
00:38:18,724 --> 00:38:20,359
I do have HPV though

773
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,392

that gives you dick cancer.

Well, that's sort of normal.

776
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:28,900
You actively stalked someone today

777
00:38:28,901 --> 00:38:31,337
your perception of normal might
be a little skewed, my dear.

778
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:33,105
- <i>Okay, you slept with her.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

779
00:38:33,106 --> 00:38:35,473
- Rocked her face.
- Mm-hmm.

780
00:38:35,474 --> 00:38:36,975
- Yes, with my body.
- You didn't call her.

781
00:38:36,976 --> 00:38:38,911
I lost my phone in a cab.

782
00:38:38,912 --> 00:38:42,381
- <i>And you unleashed her Khaleesi.</i>
- Yeah. Wait.

783
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:43,515
You mean like "Game of Thrones" Khaleesi?

784
00:38:43,516 --> 00:38:48,486
Yes. Either A, we make
multiple babies with you.

785
00:38:48,487 --> 00:38:51,489
Or B, we cut your dick off.

Jesus. I... I've got my fingers
crossed out here for an option C.

787
00:38:55,095 --> 00:38:58,129
C, you appease her.

788
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,399
And how do you appease your Khaleesi?

789

- Yeah.

791
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:10,942
I mean, you should
definitely wear stuff over it.

792

00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,877
- So tell me what happened.
- Oh, right.

804
00:39:45,878 --> 00:39:48,080
Okay, yeah, so, uh, I've been
seeing this girl Thea, alright?

Uh, she's Black.

00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:51,449
- And...
- <i>Wait stop.</i>

807
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:54,441
Does this story end with you
doing something super racist?

808
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,187
Oh, my God. No!

809
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:59,857
Why are you telling me she's Black?

810
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:03,251
I don't know. I... I'm just trying to
give you a mental picture that's all.

811
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:07,533
Okay. Racist. Keep going.

812
00:40:07,534 --> 00:40:09,634
<i>Okay. Well, we go see a
movie. During the day.</i>

813
00:40:09,635 --> 00:40:12,069
<i>And she's super smart and
cool and also gorgeous</i>

814
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,440
but I do what we talked
about. I do not sleep with her.

815
00:40:15,441 --> 00:40:17,842
You're so strong. I'm so proud.

816
00:40:17,843 --> 00:40:20,446
Hey. Not all of us can remain
celibate for a year, alright?

817
00:40:20,447 --> 00:40:22,647
I'm just waiting for the right guy.

818
00:40:22,648 --> 00:40:25,650
The white guy? Whose racist now?

819
00:40:25,651 --> 00:40:27,986
- The right guy.
- Oh, the right guy.

820
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:30,189
Oh, the one you waited for
10 years. That right guy?

00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,024
You know, he's married now, that one?

822
00:40:32,025 --> 00:40:33,057
What're we doing in this aisle?

823
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:35,627
Can I finish my story please?

824
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:38,730
I wait 4 days and then I
call her and we go out again.

Ugh!

834
00:40:50,577 --> 00:40:52,544
What? Well, and then she's like...

835
00:40:52,545 --> 00:40:54,679
Jake, what are you doing?

836
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,615
And I'm like, "Oh, of course
Wes Anderson is a such a stupid

837
00:40:57,616 --> 00:40:59,650

838
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:02,120
- Okay, racist. And also dumb. Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

839
00:41:02,121 --> 00:41:03,654
You two need any help?

840
00:41:03,655 --> 00:41:05,190
Uh, no, no, we're good.

841
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:06,990
She just takes a while to make a decision.

842
00:41:06,991 --> 00:41:08,794
- I do.
- Yeah, you got it. Yeah.

843
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:10,894
So I'm like "Well do you
wanna go see something else?"

844
00:41:10,895 --> 00:41:11,929
And then she says...

845
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,165
Why haven't we had sex yet?

846

Hey.

859
00:41:46,231 --> 00:41:48,288

- No.
- Oh.

861
00:41:50,603 --> 00:41:52,538
But don't take it personally.

862
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:54,762
I don't orgasm during sex that much.

863
00:41:55,775 --> 00:41:59,076
So? Lots of women don't cum during sex.

00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:06,050
But, what's your favorite position?

00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:08,553
I don't know. The regular one?

The regular. Come on.

00:42:11,724 --> 00:42:14,158
- From behind.
- Exactly. Because you hate your dad.

00:42:31,177 --> 00:42:32,709
- I'll meet you out front.
- Okay, great.

882
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,013
- I'll have to move the car seat.
- Mm-hmm.

883
00:42:34,014 --> 00:42:35,979
- And then there will be plenty of room.
- A whole thing.

You know, it's just
like... When do you orgasm?

887
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,656
You know what, when does it happen to you?

888
00:42:43,657 --> 00:42:46,624
- When I'm with Matthew.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

889
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:47,715
That's it.

890
00:42:48,927 --> 00:42:50,894
That's it?

891
00:42:50,895 --> 00:42:52,663
Okay, well, that just explained everything.

892
00:42:52,664 --> 00:42:56,835
That... that's... I mean you
haven't had an orgasm in a year.

893
00:42:56,836 --> 00:43:00,104
<i>Come on, that's bullshit.
Not even when you masturbate?</i>

<i>Lainey, you've got to be kidding me!</i>

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,308
What you don't mastur... Why not?

896
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:07,212
What... I don't kno...
I mean, I've tried to!

897
00:43:07,213 --> 00:43:10,616
I try. I just, I don't know, I... I...

898
00:43:10,617 --> 00:43:12,282
- I get bored.
- Bored?

899
00:43:12,283 --> 00:43:15,019
- But I feel good when I'm with Matthew.
- How's that boring?

900
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,188
I don't... I don't know. I don't
know how to recreate that myself.

901
00:43:17,189 --> 00:43:19,625
Okay. Well, fuck the TV.

902
00:43:19,626 --> 00:43:21,024
I'm gonna teach you how
to finger yourself today.

903
00:43:21,025 --> 00:43:23,060
Right now, okay?

904
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:26,131
- What?
- It's... it's go time, sister.

905
00:43:26,132 --> 00:43:28,899
- Alright. Let's go. Alright.
- Okay.

906
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,067
- No, no. This is a good thing.
- Oh, boy.

907
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:31,335
It's about time. Get it out.

908
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:32,669
- Okay.
- I'm excited.

909
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,739
For the purposes of today's tutorial

910
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,741
your vagina will be played by this

911
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:38,843
former bottle of green tea.

912
00:43:38,844 --> 00:43:40,344
- Looks just like it.
- Okay. Good to know.

913
00:43:40,345 --> 00:43:41,311
So, here's what we do.

914
00:43:41,312 --> 00:43:43,680
First thing, you take, uh, take this guy...

915
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:45,716
...this, uh, index finger
and you're gonna just, uh

916
00:43:45,717 --> 00:43:47,684
slide in there... like that, okay?

917
00:43:47,685 --> 00:43:48,654
And you're gonna curve it up a little bit

918
00:43:48,655 --> 00:43:50,922
and I want you to tap the roof like that.

919
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:53,323
You see that? That's your G
Spot alright, you got that?

920
00:43:53,324 --> 00:43:54,859
- Yeah. I'll check it out.
- Okay, good.

921
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,661
Alright, now, next move,
alright, you're gonna take

922
00:43:56,662 --> 00:43:58,663
the middle finger here, alright?
And you know, the bad boy, right?

923
00:43:58,664 --> 00:44:00,265
You're gonna have to pop that in as well

924
00:44:00,266 --> 00:44:01,832
and you're gonna have
that one tapping the roof

925
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:04,201
and then this one, the
middle finger is going to be

926
00:44:04,202 --> 00:44:07,672
you know, sort of circling, uh,
this, uh, just like fleshy gap area.

927
00:44:07,673 --> 00:44:09,706
- My cervix? Jesus.
- Yeah, sure.

928
00:44:09,707 --> 00:44:12,009
Okay, y-you know what it's
called. Wonderful. Good for you.

929
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,878
Okay, yes, so you're gonna
go after the cervix here.

930
00:44:13,879 --> 00:44:16,214
So you're gonna mind the
gap, right, tap the roof.

931
00:44:16,215 --> 00:44:19,451
- "Mind the gap. Tap the roof."
- You got it.

932
00:44:19,452 --> 00:44:21,953
Alright, now, at this point you wanna start
thinking about something, uh, arousing.

933
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:23,788
You know, like, uh, maybe
you wanna think about

934
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:25,690
the guy you lost your virginity to perhaps.

935
00:44:25,691 --> 00:44:27,426
- Gross.
- Okay, and then you're gonna start to get wet.

936
00:44:27,427 --> 00:44:28,460
You're gonna start to get wet

937
00:44:28,461 --> 00:44:30,861
and then you're gonna
start to feel some, uh...

938
00:44:30,862 --> 00:44:32,896
...contractions in your vagina, alright?

939
00:44:32,897 --> 00:44:35,232
At that point you're gonna
wanna squeeze your vagina harder

940
00:44:35,233 --> 00:44:37,435
than it wants to go, okay.

941
00:44:37,436 --> 00:44:39,471
- And that's called...
- Kegeling.

942
00:44:39,472 --> 00:44:41,806
Well, it's pronounced
"Kee-gul-ing," but it doesn't matter.

943
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:42,940
Uh, I got into med school!

944
00:44:42,941 --> 00:44:45,276
I think I know how it's pronounced.

945
00:44:45,277 --> 00:44:47,145
What? You did? You didn't tell me that.

946
00:44:47,146 --> 00:44:49,246
Oh yeah. I got in, uh, Michigan.

947
00:44:49,247 --> 00:44:52,984
- Wow! Lane, that's great.
- I know.

948
00:44:52,985 --> 00:44:55,120
Alright.

949
00:44:55,121 --> 00:44:57,921
Well, uh, are you... I mean, are
you gonna go? What are you thinking?

950
00:44:57,922 --> 00:45:00,058
Well, I... I mean, I have until
the end of the summer to decide.

951
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:01,225
- So, I just...
- Mm-hmm.

952
00:45:01,226 --> 00:45:03,428
- Keep going!
- Oh, right. Yeah, um...

953
00:45:03,429 --> 00:45:05,429
Okay, yeah, da, da, da. Okay, let's see.

954
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,866
So, uh, do you know what a dirty DJ is?

955
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:09,399
- No.
- You don't? Okay, great.

956
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,769
Okay, so the biggest
misconception that guys

957
00:45:11,771 --> 00:45:14,071
have about the clitoris,
uh, if they can find it

958
00:45:14,072 --> 00:45:16,039
- is that they're too nice to it. Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

959
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,076
Like... that's the problem.

960
00:45:17,077 --> 00:45:19,810
I mean, you know, the
trick is to be a little

961
00:45:19,811 --> 00:45:20,945
rude to the clitoris, okay?

962
00:45:20,946 --> 00:45:22,080
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

963
00:45:22,081 --> 00:45:24,815
Just go to town on this
little motherfucker right here.

964
00:45:24,816 --> 00:45:25,917
You just... like you
just... Tweet, tweet, tweet.

965
00:45:25,918 --> 00:45:27,118
You know, so that's the dirty DJ.

966
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,419
You know, like you're scratching
a record. You know, this...

967
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:30,844
Tweet tweet tweet.

968
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:33,024
Let... let... let the drummer...

969
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:35,893
Let... let... let the
drummer get wicked, right?

970
00:45:35,894 --> 00:45:37,261
And you just really wanna
work that little bugger.

971
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:39,464
You know, remember like
the old IBM ThinkPads?

972
00:45:39,465 --> 00:45:41,199
- Mm-hmm.
- And that little nub. Right?

973
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,100
Okay, so you just really
go after it like that.

974
00:45:43,101 --> 00:45:44,368
- Just like this. Yeah.
- Yeah.

975
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:47,338
Right, so, uh, you have that
that's... that's phase three.

976
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:49,841
- Mm-hmm.
- So, again, you know... Yeah, perfect.

977
00:45:49,842 --> 00:45:52,042
- Natural. Okay? Yeah, so tap the roof.
- I know.

978
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:54,379
Mind the gap. Oh, see.
Okay, yeah. Work all three.

979
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,413
- He's there.
- Look at that. It's like you're doing...

980
00:45:56,414 --> 00:45:58,015
- Right there.
- Oh boy, oh boy.

981
00:45:58,016 --> 00:46:01,118
It's like, I feel like
Anne Sullivan teaching

982
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,154
Helen Keller about water and
everything else is amazing.

983
00:46:03,155 --> 00:46:04,321
- What a breakthrough!
- Mm-hmm.

984
00:46:04,322 --> 00:46:05,356
- Yeah, that's it.
- Like that?

985
00:46:05,357 --> 00:46:06,857
Yeah, you know, just take a night

986
00:46:06,858 --> 00:46:09,928
crack open a bottle of rose and...

987
00:46:09,929 --> 00:46:12,496
...just have multiple orgasms.

988
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:15,590
If you want, you know... You know...

989
00:46:19,137 --> 00:46:21,506
Uh, primatologists actually
believed that... that

990
00:46:21,507 --> 00:46:26,111
women evolved this way so that, uh...

991
00:46:26,112 --> 00:46:29,435
...they could mate with as many
men in one session as possible.

992
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:32,417
- Fucking awesome. You know that's...
- Yeah.

993
00:46:32,418 --> 00:46:36,154
- That's neat.
- Multiple orgasms for multiple partners, you know.

994
00:46:36,155 --> 00:46:38,256
Sure, yeah.

995
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:41,124
Gang bangs, and such.

996
00:46:41,126 --> 00:46:42,616
Yeah.

997
00:46:44,963 --> 00:46:47,065
- I'm gonna go home.
- Yeah. Me too.

998
00:46:47,066 --> 00:46:48,899
- No, no. You live here.
- Yes I do!

999
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,934
- Okay.
- Bye!

1000
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:51,002
- Bye now.
- Thank you.

1001
00:46:51,003 --> 00:46:52,493
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1002
00:46:55,273 --> 00:46:57,107
<i>I think... I think
it's a little bit weird</i>

1003
00:46:57,108 --> 00:46:58,309
<i>that a straight dude had
to tell you all that.</i>

1004
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:00,511
I think it's sort of great.

1005
00:47:00,512 --> 00:47:02,881
I mean, he's... he's actually
dating. He's not cheating.

1006
00:47:02,882 --> 00:47:05,449
And I... and I hardly think
about Matthew. Like ever.

1007
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:07,352
Yeah, 'cause you're in a
relationship with each other.

1008
00:47:07,353 --> 00:47:09,220
No, we're not.

1009
00:47:09,221 --> 00:47:10,855
Oh, you're not out there!

1010
00:47:10,856 --> 00:47:13,257
I mean, this Jake guy
is taking up emotional

1011
00:47:13,258 --> 00:47:16,227
real estate that could be
occupied by a real option, okay?

1012
00:47:16,228 --> 00:47:17,562
You leased the space out to Matthew.

1013
00:47:17,563 --> 00:47:19,297
Rent free I might add.

1014
00:47:19,298 --> 00:47:21,565
And now, you... you just
replaced him with another

1015
00:47:21,566 --> 00:47:25,136
unavailable avoidant
breeder you don't fuck.

1016
00:47:25,137 --> 00:47:28,172
- Like where's the fucking...
- Hey babe. Sorry, I'm late.

1017
00:47:28,173 --> 00:47:29,540
Look at this little baby face.

1018
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:31,509
It's beautiful. Oh, my God.

1019
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,244
Very sick in the head though.

1020
00:47:33,245 --> 00:47:35,112
Very sick in the head.

1021
00:47:35,113 --> 00:47:37,915
- How's your fake boyfriend?
- Oh, my God!

1022
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:40,885
- We're just friends!
- Men and women can't be friends.

1023
00:47:40,886 --> 00:47:42,253
It's like life 101. Stop lying to yourself.

1024
00:47:42,254 --> 00:47:45,323
Come one! That's bullshit.
It's the 21st century.

1025
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:47,591
We know that's not true.
You and I are friends.

1026
00:47:47,592 --> 00:47:50,161
But sex doesn't get in
the way of our friendship.

1027
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:52,429
I'm not attracted to you.
And I have zero penises.

1028
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:55,365
- I am.
- Hi, George.

1029
00:47:55,366 --> 00:47:57,435
- Hi, it's me. Your girlfriend.
- What? Oh!

1030
00:47:57,436 --> 00:47:59,170
I like bad girls with daddy issues.

1031
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:00,971
She's 22, she'll fuck anyone.

1032
00:48:00,972 --> 00:48:02,907
- Wait. I'm sorry, no.
- You know.

1033
00:48:02,908 --> 00:48:05,999
Serious, she's probably fucked
everyone in here but I don't even care.

1034
00:48:09,381 --> 00:48:11,116
You got a minute?

1035
00:48:11,117 --> 00:48:13,906
Not really. I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

1036
00:48:14,652 --> 00:48:17,021
- I was thinking.
- Oh, yeah?

1037
00:48:17,022 --> 00:48:19,946
Do you wanna come to Henry's
birthday party this weekend?

1038
00:48:20,658 --> 00:48:22,594
- Really?
- <i>Yep.</i>

1039
00:48:22,595 --> 00:48:24,495
Xander, in the 8 years
I've known you as a father

1040
00:48:24,496 --> 00:48:27,598
you have never once invited me to
any function involving your children.

1041
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,133
- Hear me out. I was thinking.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1042
00:48:30,135 --> 00:48:32,202
Maybe you and Lainey...

1043
00:48:32,203 --> 00:48:35,239
Ah, I knew it! No. See,
Lainey and I are not dating.

1044
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,641
I know that. I'm not
saying you have to date her.

1045
00:48:37,642 --> 00:48:39,209
I'm not saying you have
to come as a couple.

1046
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:42,212
I'm just saying arrive
at the party together.

1047
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:44,549
Come as friends or whatever this
fucked up thing you guys have...

1048
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,984
- We're... we're best friends.
- <i>No, we're best friends!</i>

1049
00:48:46,985 --> 00:48:49,286
- That's not true.
- <i>What?</i>

1050
00:48:49,287 --> 00:48:51,689
Look, she's my best friend and I would say

1051
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,691
by circumstance and certainly duration

1052
00:48:53,692 --> 00:48:55,393
you would be my next best friend.

1053
00:48:55,394 --> 00:48:57,995
Okay, you know what, I'll even allow that.

1054
00:48:57,996 --> 00:49:02,000
- You're my last single friend, I can't have you...
- So what?

1055
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:03,100
- Hey.
- What are you talking about?

1056
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:05,536
- Yes.
- We have a meeting with group sales in 20.

1057
00:49:05,537 --> 00:49:06,370
- Are you two prepared.
- Huh?

1058
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:07,604
Not at all.

1059
00:49:07,605 --> 00:49:09,974
Should I reschedule the meeting

1060
00:49:09,975 --> 00:49:11,643
when you are ready? 5 or 6 months from now?

1061
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:13,545
I would make it a cool 7.

1062
00:49:13,546 --> 00:49:15,279
Yeah, 7 at least.

1063
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,049
Shit, I'm not available
then. Oh, well, I tried.

1064
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:19,484
See you in 20?

1065
00:49:19,485 --> 00:49:21,084
You got it, boss.

- What the fuck is that?

- That was repartee.
- That's... that's exactly why I can't have you at the party.

1068
00:49:27,425 --> 00:49:29,294
Because you have repartee with everybody.

Then they won't let their
kids play with my kids.

Then I have to play with my kids
because my kids have no friends.

01:02:28,907 --> 01:02:32,109
The Dirty DJ was our thing, okay?

1376
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:33,277
- Jake.
- That was our thing.

1377
01:02:33,278 --> 01:02:35,111
Okay, let me be super clear here.

1378
01:02:35,112 --> 01:02:36,547
Mm-hmm. Please.

1379
01:02:36,548 --> 01:02:39,482
We don't have things that are sexual.

1380
01:02:39,483 --> 01:02:44,053
We don't sleep with each
other, so we don't have things.

1381
01:02:44,054 --> 01:02:46,790
Okay, but you know what I mean, alright?

1382
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:49,258
I taught you that as a gift to you.

1383
01:02:49,259 --> 01:02:52,562
That was not a Chris Smith gift, okay?

1384
01:02:52,563 --> 01:02:54,531
So. I don't get mad when you bring
other chicks to our restaurant.

1385
01:02:54,532 --> 01:02:56,500
- Our restaurant?
- Yes.

1386
01:02:56,501 --> 01:02:59,102
Oh, thank you. Yeah. Our restaurant?

1387
01:02:59,103 --> 01:03:01,003
I didn't know we put a
down payment on this place.

1388
01:03:01,004 --> 01:03:02,372
Come on.

1389
01:03:02,373 --> 01:03:04,040
You know, I love it that you get ownership

1390
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:06,210
over a randomly selected dumpling spot

1391
01:03:06,211 --> 01:03:09,845
but me, I can't share with you
the slightest disappointment

1392
01:03:09,847 --> 01:03:11,481
over you co-opting an
original idea of mine.

1393
01:03:11,483 --> 01:03:12,515
- Co... Okay.
- Yeah.

1394
01:03:12,516 --> 01:03:13,550
First of all, you are not

1395
01:03:13,551 --> 01:03:15,552
the Mark Zuckerberg of vaginas.

1396
01:03:15,553 --> 01:03:16,620
I don't know who that is.

1397
01:03:16,621 --> 01:03:20,591
And secondly, do not
gaslight me with SAT words

1398
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:22,559
and sliding scale morality.

1399
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,361
- I'm not one of your dates.
- That is very true.

1400
01:03:24,362 --> 01:03:25,596
No. You are not one of my dates.

1401
01:03:25,597 --> 01:03:26,596
- And I'm glad. Thank you.
- Some water.

1402
01:03:26,597 --> 01:03:27,832
- No, the lady doesn't need it.
- Excuse me.

1403
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,566
- She doesn't deserve that.
- I would like that, please.

1404
01:03:29,567 --> 01:03:30,600
I actually would like the water.

1405
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:32,870
Sir, I-I can't stress enough

1406
01:03:32,871 --> 01:03:34,103
if we give her water I
don't know what happens.

1407
01:03:34,104 --> 01:03:35,037
You need to give me this water.

1408
01:03:35,038 --> 01:03:37,540
See she's addicted. This is an addict.

1409
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:39,575
This is... I've seen it
a hundred times with her.

1410
01:03:39,576 --> 01:03:41,410
You gotta trust me.

1411
01:03:41,411 --> 01:03:43,112
You have lost your mind.

1412
01:03:43,113 --> 01:03:46,015
Well, you have lost your water.

1413
01:03:46,016 --> 01:03:49,074
So... I guess we're tied.

1414
01:03:50,487 --> 01:03:52,890
I wanna be able to talk
you about this kinda thing.

1415
01:03:52,891 --> 01:03:55,192
I sense that. That's obvious.
I just don't know why.

1416
01:03:55,193 --> 01:03:57,361
You talk to me about chicks
you screw all the time.

1417
01:03:57,362 --> 01:03:59,618
That's different.

1418
01:04:00,964 --> 01:04:03,033
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm going inside them.

1419
01:04:03,034 --> 01:04:04,368
This you're talking
about someone inside you

1420
01:04:04,369 --> 01:04:05,902
that's just... ugh!

1421
01:04:05,903 --> 01:04:06,993
- Duh.
- Grody.

1422
01:04:09,474 --> 01:04:13,175
This is the Bieder contract that
has to go to legal for comments.

1423
01:04:13,177 --> 01:04:15,545
Knock knock. Hey, you got a minute?

1424
01:04:15,546 --> 01:04:19,149
Um... Ah, I mean... real minute?

1425
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:20,349
A New York minute. I don't
know... yeah, a real minute.

1426
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:22,018
60 seconds. Sure.

1427
01:04:22,019 --> 01:04:23,520
Okay.

1428
01:04:23,521 --> 01:04:25,454
Um, what was the other thing?

1429
01:04:25,455 --> 01:04:26,957
Oh, yeah, buzz me for the 3 o'clock.

1430
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:28,058
<i>And that's it. Okay.</i>

1431
01:04:28,059 --> 01:04:30,083
Yeah, don't fuck that up.

1432
01:04:30,561 --> 01:04:32,529
You got to let them have it.

1433
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:34,964
Hey, will you, uh, sign this for me please?

1434
01:04:34,965 --> 01:04:36,265
Well, I have to know what it is first.

1435
01:04:36,266 --> 01:04:38,935
Oh, it's a nullification of my contract.

1436
01:04:38,936 --> 01:04:43,472
It says I resign and forfeit any
vesting stock options to Xander.

1437
01:04:43,473 --> 01:04:46,410
And why would you do that?

1438
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:49,078
Oh, right, no. Because I
want to go on a date with you.

1439
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:52,648
Silly. Uh, if you can just
sign the back here. 3 places.

1440
01:04:52,649 --> 01:04:54,117
You can use my pen if you'd like.

1441
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:57,254
And as you can see I've
executed my half, so...

1442
01:04:57,255 --> 01:05:00,023
You stand to make over $5
million in the next 2 years.

1443
01:05:00,024 --> 01:05:03,492
No shit? Wow! That's great.

1444
01:05:03,494 --> 01:05:05,494
Uh, but I mean I never really factor

1445
01:05:05,496 --> 01:05:07,598
money in my decision making, so...

1446
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:09,032
...it doesn't change what I'm doing.

1447
01:05:09,033 --> 01:05:10,234
I appreciate the hardball

1448
01:05:10,235 --> 01:05:13,569
but obviously I can't take a
request like this seriously.

1449
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:14,671
But the seriousness of my request

1450
01:05:14,672 --> 01:05:17,207
is reflected in the hardball.

1451
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:20,098
So I don't... I don't know what to do here.

1452
01:05:21,211 --> 01:05:22,868
[chuckles]

1453
01:05:24,081 --> 01:05:25,314
Okay. I'll go on one date with you

1454
01:05:25,315 --> 01:05:27,250
if you answer a question truthfully.

1455
01:05:27,251 --> 01:05:29,085
Get the spanks. I love it. Yeah.

1456
01:05:29,086 --> 01:05:32,689
I answer all questions
truthfully, but fire away.

1457
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:36,959
What on earth makes you think
that I'm worth $5 million?

1458
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,652
What makes you think you're not?

1459
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:42,855
[instrumental music]

1460
01:05:44,635 --> 01:05:46,236
Get outta here. Get back to work.

1461
01:05:46,237 --> 01:05:47,471
- I'm on break.
- So take this...

1462
01:05:47,472 --> 01:05:49,506
- I'm on break.
- ...and get out of my office.

1463
01:05:49,507 --> 01:05:51,096
Okay.

1464
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:54,066
Alright. To be continued.

1465
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,768
TTFN.

1466
01:05:57,514 --> 01:06:00,283
<i>Um, you know, I mean...</i>

1467
01:06:00,284 --> 01:06:02,051
Ta-ta for now.

1468
01:06:02,052 --> 01:06:05,022
My ex has my son this weekend.

1469
01:06:05,023 --> 01:06:07,491
And I know a place with cheap tequila.

1470
01:06:07,492 --> 01:06:09,692
We should go there. That sounds great.

1471
01:06:09,693 --> 01:06:12,129
Can you keep your mouth shut?

1472
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:14,363
Yeah. I mean, not once we get there.

1473
01:06:14,364 --> 01:06:16,099
Tequila makes me so chatty.

1474
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,067
In a good way I think.

1475
01:06:18,068 --> 01:06:20,536
- You mean out here.
- <i>Just... Yes, mouth shut, please.</i>

1476
01:06:20,537 --> 01:06:23,129
- Not gonna say a peep.
- Get outta here!

1477
01:06:25,043 --> 01:06:27,642
Back to work, you.

1478
01:06:27,643 --> 01:06:29,134
<i>Yes!</i>

1479
01:06:31,782 --> 01:06:34,017
<i>There you are.</i>

1480
01:06:34,018 --> 01:06:35,786
Hey, thanks for comin', Lainey.

1481
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:38,653
Partners always have to
do these bullshit events.

1482
01:06:38,654 --> 01:06:40,122
I hope your heels are comfortable

1483
01:06:40,123 --> 01:06:41,023
'cause you're gonna be standing

1484
01:06:41,024 --> 01:06:43,460
and talking to boring people all night.

1485
01:06:43,461 --> 01:06:45,462
Chris, I'm having a great time.

1486
01:06:45,463 --> 01:06:47,330
Thank you for inviting me.

1487
01:06:47,331 --> 01:06:49,888
And these shoes are still uncomfortable.

1488
01:06:51,536 --> 01:06:53,024
<i>Elaine?</i>

1489
01:06:53,438 --> 01:06:55,071
Hi, Matthew.

1490
01:06:55,072 --> 01:06:57,506
- Good to see you.
- This is Chris.

1491
01:06:57,508 --> 01:06:59,508
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Matthew.

1492
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:02,111
Matthew and I were at
Columbia around the same time.

1493
01:07:02,112 --> 01:07:05,148
Oh. Your name is Elaine?

1494
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:07,718
- Lainey is a nickname.
- I didn't know that.

1495
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:11,120
Oh, Elaine, you've never
met my wife, have you?

1496
01:07:11,121 --> 01:07:13,257
- I haven't.
- Let me introduce you. Emma?

1497
01:07:13,258 --> 01:07:16,292
- Come here.
- Excuse me.

1498
01:07:16,293 --> 01:07:17,728
This is Elaine.

1499
01:07:17,729 --> 01:07:19,462
So nice to meet you, Emma.

1500
01:07:19,463 --> 01:07:20,663
- This is Chris.
- Hi.

1501
01:07:20,664 --> 01:07:22,598
- Hi.
- When are you due?

1502
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:25,201
- October.
- Congratulations.

1503
01:07:25,202 --> 01:07:27,603
- Your first?
- Yes. It's a boy.

1504
01:07:27,604 --> 01:07:30,306
We're so excited.

1505
01:07:30,307 --> 01:07:31,574
Matthew will be delivering him.

1506
01:07:31,575 --> 01:07:33,643
- Oh.
- Oh.

1507
01:07:33,644 --> 01:07:35,678
- OB-GYN?
- Yes. You?

1508
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:37,480
Uh, partner over at Garrison and Shingle.

1509
01:07:37,481 --> 01:07:39,415
- A man of the law.
- Yeah.

1510
01:07:39,416 --> 01:07:41,150
I've worked with you
guys when I was a mediator

1511
01:07:41,151 --> 01:07:42,518
on Thorpe V. Bronwin.

1512
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:45,121
- Sure.
- Elaine, what is it that you do?

1513
01:07:45,122 --> 01:07:46,456
- I teach kindergarten.
- That's right.

1514
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:48,356
I think I knew that.

1515
01:07:48,357 --> 01:07:50,818
Would you excuse me? I'm just
gonna run to the ladies' room.

1516
01:07:57,401 --> 01:07:58,435
<i>Okay, can I cut to the chase?</i>

1517
01:07:58,436 --> 01:07:59,468
<i>I would love that.</i>

1518
01:07:59,469 --> 01:08:00,836
I love cutting to chases. Do it.

1519
01:08:00,838 --> 01:08:02,873
Okay, so you're a womanizer.

1520
01:08:02,874 --> 01:08:04,474
Hey!

1521
01:08:04,476 --> 01:08:05,343
How did you know that?

1522
01:08:05,344 --> 01:08:07,210
- Everybody knows that.
- Everybody?

1523
01:08:07,211 --> 01:08:09,178
Your interns call you a Jump Back Jake.

1524
01:08:09,179 --> 01:08:10,279
- I have a nickname?
- A nickname.

1525
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,515
- That's how bad it is.
- Wow!

1526
01:08:11,516 --> 01:08:13,350
It's not bad. I...

1527
01:08:13,351 --> 01:08:14,317
Or that's how good it is!

1528
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:16,252
Right? Well, see, that's what I'm saying.

1529
01:08:16,253 --> 01:08:17,453

really bad, and weird.

- So no honeymoon?
- Oh, no, no.

2008
01:34:21,283 --> 01:34:22,817
There's gonna be a honeymoon.

2009
01:34:22,818 --> 01:34:23,786
I got us the penthouse suite

2010
01:34:23,787 --> 01:34:25,085
down at the plaza right down the road here.

2011
01:34:25,086 --> 01:34:26,454
- Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

2012
01:34:26,455 --> 01:34:27,755
But first I've gotta take you downtown

2013
01:34:27,756 --> 01:34:29,692
and make an honest woman out of you.

2014
01:34:29,693 --> 01:34:32,126
- Rings?
- Shit.

2015
01:34:32,127 --> 01:34:34,718
Kidding. Xander's got them.

2016
01:34:36,265 --> 01:34:38,198
I can't believe we lost our virginity

2017
01:34:38,199 --> 01:34:41,001
to each other and saved
ourselves for marriage.

2018
01:34:41,002 --> 01:34:42,836
- Yeah.
- That's pretty great.

2019
01:34:42,837 --> 01:34:43,906
I'm proud of us. Nicely done.

2020
01:34:43,907 --> 01:34:45,139
I mean...

2021
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:46,140
It's not like we haven't done it.

2022
01:34:46,141 --> 01:34:47,474
- Of course.
- I know what it looks like.

2023
01:34:47,475 --> 01:34:49,077
Yeah, yeah. It's been a while.

2024
01:34:49,078 --> 01:34:51,012
But I know what your
situation is down there.

2025
01:34:51,013 --> 01:34:53,938
Oh, really? Yeah, how's my situation?

2026
01:34:54,917 --> 01:34:57,941
Are you kidding? It's perfect.

2027
01:35:00,221 --> 01:35:04,448
Oh, well, I'm pretty
much a dream come true.

2028
01:35:07,931 --> 01:35:09,687
- Mousetrap.
- Mousetrap.

2029
01:35:11,834 --> 01:35:13,469
- Do we really have to...
- No, we don't.

2030
01:35:13,470 --> 01:35:14,937
...say that.

2031
01:35:14,938 --> 01:35:17,462
Well, from safe word to code word, I guess.

2032
01:35:18,773 --> 01:35:20,341

- Let's go fuck first.

2033
01:35:20,342 --> 01:35:21,943

Absolutely. How long shall
I tell him we're going to be?

2037
01:35:26,182 --> 01:35:29,784

have this whole sex thing.

- First of all...

2073
01:37:02,345 --> 01:37:04,411
...we had sex, at the last minute

2074
