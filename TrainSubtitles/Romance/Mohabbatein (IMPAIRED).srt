00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
My name is Karan... Karan Choudhry.

3
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Samir... Samir Sharma.

4
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,000
Hey guys ! Gurukul ?

5
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,100
This was their first meeting. Even they
did not know then that this...

6
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,100
little acquaintance at the station,
would lead to a lifetime of friendship.

7
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,100
Quite a big room.

8
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,900
First come first served, guys!
This bed is mine.

9
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,700
Oh God! ls this a bed or a rock...?
Can't do anything about it, can we ?

10
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,500
Now that we are in Gurukul,
We have to study.

11
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Even if the bed feels like a rock,
We have to sleep.

12
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,000
Hey guys! That was a cool poem,
wasn't it?

13
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,600
No one is listening. No reaction.

14
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,000
lf you guys snore at night,
just let me know. ..

15
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,800
so l can hustle up
some cotton for my ears.

16
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,300
That's because l really cherish my
eight hours of sleep,...

17
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,100
dreaming of pretty girls!
So let me know, thanks ....

18
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,300
What's that ? Who's voice is that ?

19
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,300
Who is that ?

20
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,700
That is the principal of Gurukul.
The one and only, Mr. Narayan Shankar.

21
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,600
Tradition, Honour and Discipline.

22
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,100
These are the three pillars
of Gurukul,...

23
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,200
the values with which
we shape your future.

24
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
Those who have been here...

25
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,200
have set very high standards for you.

26
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,000
Today, all of them are successful men
in their own respective fields

27
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,500
some are great writers, great
businessmen and some great politicians.

28
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,400
But all of them have one thing
in common. All their lives...

29
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,300
they have followed the principles
taught to them, by this Gurukul.

30
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,800
Today you have the opportunity
to be a part of this great lineage.

31
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,600
You have been selected from all over
the country, and brought here...

32
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,300
because we believe that you have
what it takes to be great men.

33
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,600
But success does not come so easily.

34
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,100
Behind every great success
lies a great sacrifice.

35
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,700
By entering this institution today,...

36
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:17,000
you have shut yourself
from the outside world.

37
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,000
We expect that you will work
with full concentration,...

38
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,200
and follow the rules and regulations of
t his institution with strict discipline.

39
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,000
lf any one is found
guilty of misconduct,...

40
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,100
he will be expelled immediately.
And remember one thing.

41
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,800
Once you are expelled from here the
doors of all other...

42
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,300
educational institutions would also
be shut for you, forever.

43
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,700
So if there is anyone here who is
not willing to make this sacrifice,...

44
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,200
then he is free to walk out
of that gate right now.

45
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,900
But if you have decided
to stay here,...

46
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,500
then that gate and the world outside
does not exist for you anymore.

47
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,800
Now l want all of you to close
your eyes, bow your heads...

48
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,200
and think of every word
l have said to you,...

49
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,900
and make your own decision.

50
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Vicky! That's my photograph!
. l can see that, my friend,...

51
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,900
but who is this lady in red with you?
. Nobody, give it back to me.

52
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,100
Stop it, Vicky...
what are you doing?

53
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,800
Oh God! lt's you.
You scared us.

54
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,300
Come here quickly.
l've got something to show you.

55
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,000
Who is this?

56
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,800
This? Romeo and Juliet,
Heer Ranjha,...

57
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,000
Samir and ...Samir and ...?

58
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,500
Sanjana! And it's nothing
like what you think.

59
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,700
She's just a good friend of mine...
actually, she was a friend.

60
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,600
She was a friend?

61
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,300
Sanju was my childhood friend.
We were best friends.

62
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,600
We were neighbours and
literally grew up together.

63
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,100
We had this photograph taken at
a funfair. lt was her birthday,...

64
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,400
and the next day, she was
supposed to leave. Forever.

65
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,000
Her father had been transferred and
that was the last time that l saw her.

66
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,500
That was six years ago.
l was just fourteen years old

67
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
But do you know where she is now?

68
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,500
l heard a few months ago that she
could be in this very town.

69
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,500
That's great! Which means that
you know where she lives?

70
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
No, l don't.
And l don't want to find out.

71
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,100
Why not?

72
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,000
Because it's been a long time and l do
not know if she will recognize me...

73
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,400
orwhether she would
like to meet me or not.

74
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,800
So, we'll meet if we are destined to.
Otherwise we won't.

75
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,100
Hey Samir! You really love this girl.

76
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,700
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
she's just an old friend.

77
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,200
Shut up! Just an old friend!

78
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,800
Tell me something. How many other
old friends' photographs...

79
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,500
have you been carrying with you
forthe last six years?

80
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,300
That's the bell for your love!

81
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,000
Come on, it's time to sleep.

82
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,800
Old friend, my foot!

83
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,900
l wish l had that photograph
in my pocket. By now,...

84
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,500
l'd have been in her house, relishing
the savouries she'd make for me.

85
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,300
And look at you! ''We'll meet if we're
destined to; otherwise, we won't''

86
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,100
Know what, Karan! There's a girls'
hostel behind our college?

87
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
So what do l do?
. Oh no. You don't do anything.

88
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,400
You just think.
And l'll do it.

89
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,600
Oh shit! l'm late.
Why do we have to begin so early?

90
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,800
Where is my sleeve...?

91
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,700
Who's that...?
Stop there!

92
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,700
Stop it! You theif.

93
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,700
lshika! Miss Monica is coming!
Hurry up!

94
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,800
lshika! . lshk....

95
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,700
We're through at last! Let's return...
l'm terribly hungry.

96
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,200
We've still got to buy mineral water.
. lt was there in the shop back there

97
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,900
You guys take the stuff to the jeep.
l 'll go and get it.

98
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,500
You're always thinking about food.
You know nothing else, do you.

99
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,100
How much is this for?
. ''dedh'' rupees

100
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,300
How can it be ''Dedh''?

101
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,700
The real price is
''dhai'' rupees.

102
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,200
No madam, it's for ''dedh'' rupees.

103
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,700
l know everything. The price is
''dhai'' rupees ...

104
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,000
and l will pay you accordingly . not
a penny more, not a penny less.

105
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,100
Please try to understand what l say...
. l will listen to nothing!

106
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,200
Do you want to give it or don't you?
Tell me clearly.

107
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,200
But ma'am... it costs ''dedh'' rupees,
Not ''dhai'' rupees!

108
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,000
Only last week my friend bought
the same thing from your shop...

109
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
at ''dhai'' rupees.
. Maybe,...

110
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,400
but the price now is ''dedh'' rupees.
. But l'll pay ''dhai'' Rupees.

111
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,200
Quickly pack it for me.
. Somebody, please make her see reason

112
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,300
''We'll meet, if we are destined to.''

113
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,800
Are you giving it or not?
. How can l charge...

114
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
''dhai'' rupees when it costs
''dedh'' rupees?

115
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,300
l don't know! l'll pay ''dhai''...
here's the money, if you want it.

116
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,400
By the way, ''dedh'' is lesserthan
''dhai'' Rupees.

117
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,000
ls it really...?
. That's just what l was...

118
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,700
trying to explain.
. How much is ''Dedh'' rupees?

119
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,900
Well... one and a half rupees.

120
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,700
Ok, so give it to me for
one and a half rupees.

121
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:21,000
As you wish.
Your bangles and change.

122
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,800
Show me these bangles, please.

123
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,900
For you?
. Yes

124
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,100
What?
. No, for a friend of mine...

125
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,300
that red one,...
yes, the green one...

126
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:44,600
Samir.....Samir Sharma !
. Sanju....

127
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,100
What are you doing here?
. Me ... l am a student at Gurukul.

128
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,700
Not bad, Mr. Sharma.
. Cool huh !

129
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,100
Which means you've been here
for so long,...

130
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,400
and did not even botherto call me!
. l didn't have yourtelephone number.

131
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
Stop making excuses!

132
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,600
The truth is that you
didn't even think of me,...

133
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,200
so it did not bother you whether
l was in this town or not.

134
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,000
What is my phone number !

135
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,300
Excuse me ma'am.
. This is mine. Thank you.

136
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,100
What is it?

137
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,300
Nothing... just the list
of things l had to buy.

138
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:24,500
Have you found everything?
. Yes... l've found everything.

139
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,100
So come with me!
l'm going to set you straight!

140
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,000
Who do you think you are...? Just
because you're a student at Gurukul...

141
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,200
you think you can act tough!
We're going home straight away.

142
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,400
Papa will be so happy to see you.
. Sanju, l cannot come now,...

143
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,200
l've got to return to Gurukul.
. Then promise you'll come on Sunday.

144
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,100
A true promise?
. True promise.

145
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,700
Khan Baba, when is the train from
Aligarh scheduled to arrive?

146
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,500
The train should be here any moment.
Whom have you come to recieve?

147
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,600
The professor of my college.
. l see...

148
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,300
the train should be here any moment.

149
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,100
Khan Baba, who's that girl?

150
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,100
That's Kiran.
She comes here quite often.

151
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:36,800
Kiran!

152
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,700
Hey! Gurukul. Are you from Gurukul?
...No, No, its OK.

153
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,300
Shall we leave?
. Yes sir...

154
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,400
Ok guys, this is it! l have decided!
The first thing tomorrow morning...

155
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,100
l'm going to cross that gate,
enterthat girls' hostel,...

156
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,400
and whereverthat girl is,
l am going to find her,...

157
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,800
and look deep into her eyes
and tell her . You're beautiful.

158
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,600
l am going to do it!

159
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,500
Now you guys tell me
what you'll have decided.

160
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,800
What say, Samir? ls she going to be
just a friend all your life.

161
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:18,800
For years, l have been
just a friend of hers.

162
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,300
But now it's time to move ahead.

163
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,900
Hey Karan! What have you thought ?

164
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,400
l am going to think of her as the most
beautiful dream l've ever had,...

165
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,500
and forget about her.
. What? Don't be such a sissy!

166
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,200
You guys must've have forgotten,
but l still remember every word ...

167
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,400
Narayan Shankar uttered: ''if you
break the rules of Gurukul...''

168
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,200
''you will be expelled immediately.''

169
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,000
Oh c'mon, Karan!
Don't be so scared!

170
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,200
People usually go overboard
during a speech...

171
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,500
that doesn't mean that one has to
take it so seriously.

172
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Narayan Shankar means
every word he says.

173
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,300
He has done it earlier,
and he can do it again.

174
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,200
What has he done earlier?

175
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,700
lt's a famous story.

176
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,400
There used to be this student here
a few years ago,

177
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,700
He was brilliant. Everyone thought
he would do something in life.

178
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,200
But he made the mistake of breaking
a rule of Gurukul . he fell in love.

179
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,100
Narayan Shankar expelled him without
even seeing him or meeting him.

180
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,100
And, as everyone knows,...

181
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,300
once you're expelled from here,
you cannot get admission elsewhere.

182
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:34,900
Today, no one knows where he is
orwhat has happened to him.

183
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:43,200
As forthe girl he loved,
she committed suicide.

184
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,500
She was Narayan Shankar's
one and only child!

185
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,800
Everyone thought that this incident
would soften Narayan Shankar.

186
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,800
lnstead, it only made him harder.

187
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,300
So l'm neither a sissy nor a coward...

188
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,500
but l am not strong enough to
fight Mr. Narayan Shankar.

189
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,400
l am not that strong.

190
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,900
l guess she is destined to be
just a friend of mine.

191
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,400
You will have to wait
a little, lshk...

192
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,600
till someone comes and
saves us from Narayan Shankar.

193
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,800
What do you want?
You can't get inside.

194
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,500
Go away... Go!

195
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,200
l can't do this on my own.
Where have you been?

196
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,200
l was at the market to
get all the stuff,...

197
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,000
and you are having
problems with the bulb.

198
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,800
Mr Seera, l had asked you for
some paperwork. ls it ready?

199
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,500
Yes, sir, it's ready.
. Please leave it on my table.,

200
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,400
What's happening here?

201
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,400
Good morning sir!
My name is Raj Aryan.

202
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,200
l have an appointment with you, sir.
. Don't you know...

203
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,900
that there are students here who are
trying to concentrate on theirwork?

204
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,100
Don't you understand that you mustn't
make noise in a place like this?

205
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,400
l'm sorry sir. lt's just that the
l ittle girl saw the violin in my hand..

206
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,300
and insisted on hearing it.
l just couldn't break her heart.

207
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,500
lt is more important
not to break rules here.

208
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,100
Follow me.

209
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:14,200
So you teach music.
. Yes sir.

210
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,000
And you want to be given the opportunity
t o teach music in this university.

211
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Yes sir.

212
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,800
Being fully aware of the
traditions of the Gurukul?

213
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,600
Yes.

214
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,000
Knowing for a fact that no form of
music has ever been taught here,...

215
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,100
nor probably will it ever be?
. Yes sir

216
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,100
l read here that you have already been
o ffered jobs in 3 other universiities..

217
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:48,900
and yet you have come here all
the way to seek a job . Why?

218
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,000
l was told that you would not
allow me to teach music here.

219
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,300
They said that it was impossible.

220
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:08,500
lt seemed like a challenge to me
and l like challenges.

221
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,200
And what makes you think that you
can make me change my mind.

222
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,400
From what l have
heard about you, sir...

223
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,100
l think even you
like challenges. Right sir?

224
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,400
How can your music help my students?

225
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,000
Students remain buried in their
books the whole day, sir.

226
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,500
Music will rejuvenate them and make
their learning process less stressful.

227
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,200
Besides, they will end up learning
music, which is a joy in itself.

228
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,000
Music is a wonderful thing sir!
lt's...

229
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
What happens if you do not find enough
students, who want to learn music?

230
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,900
That's no problem, sir.
l'll pack this small bag, and leave.

231
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,700
l'll be gone.

232
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,700
l like your self confidence Mr. Aryan.
. Thank you sir.

233
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,300
l will give you one opportunity.

234
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,600
lf you do find enough students wishing
to learn music in their spare time,...

235
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,700
you've got yourself a job.
Otherwise, you will leave.

236
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,700
Yes, set it here....
thank you.

237
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,600
That's quite a classroom you've
made for yourself, Mr. Aryan.

238
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,100
l'm sorry sir! l just thought,
that at the end of the day...

239
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,300
the students would feel much
better being outside. That's all.

240
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,800
You already have ten more students
registered since yesterday.

241
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,500
That's quite an achievement in one day.
. Thank you sir! As l said...

242
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
music is such a wonderful thing....sir

243
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,000
You have the job, Mr. Aryan.

244
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,900
This is the contract.
Please read it carefully and sign it.

245
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,100
Mr. Aryan, you're about to
become a part of Gurukul.

246
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:39,600
l would like to explain something.
. Please do.

247
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,300
Forthe last 25 years,...

248
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,400
l have run this place with tradition,
honour, and discipline.

249
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,000
Nothing has changed since then.

250
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,800
Which is why Gurkul has retained
its pristine glory.

251
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,300
Yesterday, you changed
the order of a few chairs.

252
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,300
Tomorrow, you might want
to change something else.

253
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,000
l do not like change of
any kind, Mr. Aryan.

254
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,900
l just don't like changes.

255
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,100
l understand sir.

256
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,600
Good. Welcome to Gurukul Mr. Aryan .

257
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,600
Love... the greatest inspiration
for music.

258
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,400
Love and music are very
closely connected to each other.

259
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,500
Both originate from the heart...

260
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,700
and the destinies of both depend on
whetherthe heart expresses it or not.

261
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:37,100
lf you love somebody...
just go and tell her.

262
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,100
Don't worry about whether
she accepts or refuses.

263
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,300
Similarily, if you feel like playing
the instrument in front of you,...

264
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:49,500
just pick it up and play it;
do not worry about being good or bad,

265
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,600
Just listen to your heart
and do what it says.

266
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,600
Now carefully look at that gate.
lt's the gate you look at everyday.

267
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,100
lt's the gate you guys
can never cross.

268
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,900
Look at that gate again and imagine.

269
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:21,200
That the girl you truly love,
is standing behind that gate...

270
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,200
waiting for you...
calling out to you!

271
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:04,100
Yes, yes! She's calling out to you!

272
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,300
She's asking you to come and
break down that gate,...

273
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,400
so that it never closes again.

274
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,600
She's not going to wait forever!
Listen to your heart.!

275
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,900
Go on! Get up and break
open that gate!

276
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,200
C'mon! Just listen to your heart
Get up! And get going!

277
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,700
Go on...!

278
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,100
There is so much of hatred
in this world.

279
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,000
Even then, the hearts are full of love.

280
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,200
Go forth and tell this universe,...

281
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,100
Nothing can stop these love stories.

282
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,900
''l stop in mid.walk''

283
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,000
''Left to myself l am lost''

284
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,200
''And midway, l lose my words''

285
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,800
''ls this love?''

286
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,100
''Yes, this is love''

287
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,800
''Why do l die to see you?''

288
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:12,300
''l don't know''

289
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,700
''Why do l do what l do?''

290
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,700
''l don't know''

291
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,900
''l try sometimes, to make my way
through blind alleys''

292
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,300
''Everything in the world
seems to startle me''

293
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,600
''Oh, what is this doing to me?''

294
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,200
''ls this love?''

295
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,300
''Yes, this is love''

296
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,000
''ln the way you are...''

297
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:41,100
''there's something very naughty''

298
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,900
''ln the way you are...''

299
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,900
''there's something very naughty''

300
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,900
''On my lips...''

301
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,900
''lingers something of a grievance''

302
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,900
''l am kissing your eyes with mine...''

303
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,600
''l hold you, l go into raptures''

304
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,200
''Oh, what is this doing to me?''

305
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,100
''ls this love?''

306
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:40,100
''Yes, this is love''

307
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,900
Mr. Aryan do you know
what you are asking for?

308
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,300
Have you forgotten the rules
o f Gurukul?

309
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,300
Please sir. Think about it
he has no other choice.

310
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,400
Mr. Aryan, you are asking me to allow
a student of Gurukul...

311
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,500
to do a part time job.

312
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,600
ut's impossibue!

313
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,300
Sir, Samir's father has passed away.

314
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,100
His motherworks day and
night to support him.

315
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,600
Thats why, he thinks by getting a job
he can share his mother's burden.

316
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,700
And l think...we should help him out.

317
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,200
You must be back before
10 every night.

318
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:34,900
Yes sir!

319
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:58,600
How can one live without love?
How can one die unloved?

320
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,500
Sweeterthan sugar!
Love, Love.

321
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,400
More sourthan tamarind.
Love, Love.

322
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,800
This is love. Yes love, love.

323
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,300
Oh, Kakeji, what happened
why did you stop?

324
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,100
Preeto's come.

325
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:30,300
You came close and smiled at me
You filled my life with sweet dreams...

326
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:43,400
Now my heart does'nt listen to me

327
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,200
Oh Jaggi, Preeto's coming here.

329
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,700
with a smile on her face
and not with her shoes in her hand.

330
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,300
What are you saying!

331
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,800
Excuse me . Kake ji

339
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,500
So, now something happens to you?
. No ma'am, nothing happens.

340
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,200
Jolly good!
. Very good ma'am.

341
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,200
Eat sugar and die! Stupid...

342
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,300
How many times have l told you
not to mess with me.

343
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,600
Oh, this is love, love.

344
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,800

00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:42,400
Yes, lshika come in
Your cousin Viren has come to see you.

347
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,200
l told him that l do not like visitors
who do not take prior permission...

348
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,400
but l believe there is
some sort of urgency...

349
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,800
so l have given him permission....

350
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,400
Excuse me... You!

351
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,100
How have you been, quickly put
your arm around me otherwise..

352
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:15,400
l will tell Miss Monica about your
morning visits to Gurukul.

353
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,700
l am seeing you after
so many years

354
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:27,900
and just look at how
you've really grown.

355
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,300
Keep smiling, keep smiling,
that's lovely.

356
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:38,200
Now you must be wondering what
the hell l am doing here, right....

357
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,900
The thing is that lshika,
ever since l've seen you

358
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,600
l see flashes of you all the time and

359
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,300
you've even started coming
in my dreams now...

360
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,500
and l am sure l must be in your
dreams too Right? l knew it...

361
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,600
l feel we should'nt waste
any time now...

362
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,000
There is no point just
looking at each other...

363
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
and not saying anything to
one another...lt's so stupid?

364
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,200
l feel we should take our
love story further.

365
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,200
So l will wait for you on Sunday...

366
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,900

Hi! u'm Karan!
What did you say your name was?

370
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,900
How do you end up hurting yourself
in the same place, all the time?

371
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,300
Sorry, what?

372

00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,300
hurting yourself in the same place
all the time?

374
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,600
l do not know, may be

375
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:59,800
Did you always want to be a doctor?

376
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,800
Oh, so you are a nurse in this hospital.

My father had built this hospital...

378
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,300
and he had left the decoration
of this room to me.

379
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:15,500
Since then l just come here
to spend some time with these kids.

380
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,300
So, what do you do?
. Nothing.

381
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:24,400
Wow! l wish l could do nothing.

382
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,100
Excuse me? l have been wanting
to ask you something....

383
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:35,000
the other night l saw you at the
station you were standing all alone...

384
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,700
the train came, and l turned to
look at you and you had walked away...

385
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:43,000
l could'nt understand anything
were you waiting for someone?

386
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,500
lf you do not want to talk
about it it's ok, no problem.

387
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,600
You saw the girl standing
at the station...

388
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,600
but you did not see her
red bridal dress....

can see, whose laughter he can hear...

450
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,700
l can't even do that.

451
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:52,100
Why not Sir?

452
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:57,000
Because the girl l love is no more.

453
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,800
She's dead!

454
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,800
l did not fall in love with her
on the condition...

455
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,100
that she would live longerthan me...

456
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:19,100
there are no conditions in love
so there should'nt be any regrets.

457
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:28,600
So what if today she is not with me
l still love herthe same way...

458
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:36,200
not because l can't find someone else to
love, but loving her makes me happy.

459
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,200
Whenever l miss her, l close my eyes
and she is with me.

460
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:52,100
You didn't fall in love with her on the
condition that she will love you too...

461
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,100
so just because she loves someone
else you want to forget her,

462
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:05,700
don't let go so easily.

463
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,600
Love is just like life,

464
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:14,000
its not always easy, and
it does not always bring happiness...

465
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,800
but when we do not stop living
why should we stop loving!

466
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:29,200
Sorry forthe long lecture anyway if
Mr. Narayan Shankar sees you'll here...

467
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:35,100
then all the love stories will come
to an end today itself.

468
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,200
Love is just like life its
not always easy...

469
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:47,800
and it does not always
bring happiness.

470
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:53,300
But when we do not stop living
why should we stop loving.

471
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,800
Made you wait for a long time?

472
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:18,700
This is for hugging me that day l know
what guys like you are all about...

473
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:24,200
but this time you have messed
with the wrong girl.

474
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,700
My name is lSHlKA DHANRAJGlR...

475
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,700
and l can employ hundred boys
like you as servants in my house.

476
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:38,600
So next time, before fooling around
with any girl rememberthis slap and me.

477
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:11,700
By slapping me you have
taught me a lesson.

478
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,400
But ma'am this really was
my first time

479
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,700
and l was unaware of
the rules of this game.

480
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:26,400
l did not know one had to exchange one's
bank accounts before asking a girl out.

481
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,200
lf l knew this, l would have introduced
myself much earlierto you...

482
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,200
my name is Vikram Oberoi,

483
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,200
and my father is one of the leading
industrialists of this nation...

484
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:43,000
and if he wants he can employ your
father but l am so stupid...

485
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,600
l was not aware of the
importance of all this.

486
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,500
l just knew that l had seen a
beautiful girl...

487
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:58,400
whom l wanted to get to know,
and become friends with.

488
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,100
l thought this was enough to ask someone
out for a date. How stupid l was...

489
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:09,300
but now l have understood.
Next time l won't get slapped.

490
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:36,100
You shut her up man, and l was not aware
that my friend is the son of a rich man.

491
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
What do you think
if l was the son of such a rich man...

492
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,200
would l be a waiter's friend?
. What? What do you mean?

493
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,800
My dad works in a bank.
. What?

494
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,700
Then .what was all this?

495
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,600
l had to shut the rich girl up...

496
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,400
so l just made myself richer
than her, and she shut up.

497
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:59,400
Ok, forget this .tell me
are all beautiful girls this snooty?

498
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:05,100
Well since they're beautiful
they are bound to be a little proud.

499
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,900
Not at all, she is very sweet.
. Then she must be very ugly.

500
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:22,200
l had seen Kiran forthe first time
on this very platform.

501
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,800
She had just got married and come...

502
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:30,600
and it was also the last time
l saw her happy...

503
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,500
because her husband had to leave
that very night...

504
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:44,700
due to some tension at the border,
and he was an Airforce pilot.

505
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:55,500
Since then she often comes here...

506
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:03,000
hoping to see her husband
get down from the train...

507
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:08,200
but everybody knows that is impossible
because two years back we got to hear..

508
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,300
that two planes were found
missing at the border.

509
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:15,600
l feel even she knows
that her husband is no more...

510
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:22,100
but she still comes here to please
one man her husbands father .

511
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,600
Major General Khanna...

512
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:30,800
a retired army officer and one of the
richest men in this town who believes...

513
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:35,500
that till he does not see the dead body
of his son, he is not dead ...

514
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:43,600
he insists that Kiran dutifully fulfills
all the traditions of a married girl.

515
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:49,900
Kiran's sister.in.law, Nandini,
is her only friend.

516
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:54,900
She is the wife of
Major Khanna's elder son...

517
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:00,100
who is a computer engineer in the
military and is away most of the time.

518
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,900
Nandini loves Kiran like a sister
and wants to see her happy.

519
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:09,300
She has a naughty son named Ayush.

520
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:12,700
He is the bright light in
Kiran's dark life...

521
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:18,000
they laugh, cry, play
and fight together.

522
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,100
Kiran forgets all her pains and sorrows
and she becomes a child with him.

523
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:28,200
She is after all just 19 years old.

524
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:34,100
This is Kiran .who had had come here
to laugh and love...

525
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,700
hope she gets her share of happiness.

526
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:44,300
l promise you Khan Baba she will
definitely get her share of happiness.

527
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:12,100
What exactly are you doing?
. The same thing that you are doing sir.

528
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,500
l am doing Suryanamaskar.

529
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:20,400
So am l. lts just that you do it
yourway and l do it my way.

530
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,600
l wanted to ask you,
why do you do it.

531
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:37,100
lt makes we feel good to stare
directly at the sun...

532
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,800
without having to blink my eyes.

533
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:46,400
l feel l am not weakerthan the sun.
l like it .why do you do it?

534
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,200
Just like that sir, unlike you,

535
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,400
l do not have a battle
going on with the sun..

536
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,700
l just enjoy basking in the sunshine
l call this suryanamaskar.

537
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:01,500
Excuse me sir
l wanted to ask you for something.

538
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:02,300
Yes.

539
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,500
Sir, l do not know if you are aware
that today is the festival of Holi...

540
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,700
and l wanted the students
to celebrate it.

541
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:11,700
But l have been told that Holi has
never been celebrated here in Gurukul.

542
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:16,300
Holi has never been celebrated here
forthe simple reason that....

543
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,100
no one has everwanted to
at least no one has asked me before.

544
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:23,500
Sir, no one has asked you because
everybody is scared of you.

545
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:27,300
And you are not scared of
me Mr. Aryan?

546
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:34,100
No sir, l have never been scared of
doing the right thing, so as long as...

547
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:39,100
l know that l am not asking for
anything wrong, l am not scared.

548
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:44,500
Holi has never been and neverwill be
celebrated inside Gurukul, however...

549
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,800
l have nothing against
this festival,

550
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,100
if some of the students
wish to celebrate....

551
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:53,700
they can go outside Gurukul
and do so.

552
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,500
From where l come there is
a tradition of starting this day...

553
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:16,100
with putting a teeka on the
eldest of the family...

554
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,400
if you do not mind, on behalf of....

555
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:25,400
me and my students l would like
to put this on you.

556
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:30,000
l'll just put a little sir,

557
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:49,800
''O' golden.eyed one...''

558
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:55,500
''whether you give me your heart,
orwhether you chide me''

559
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:09,600
''We're crazy about you''

560
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:14,000
''We're your playful paramours''

561
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,800
''You liars''

562
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:38,100
''Behind that innocent face,
there's hidden a black heart''

563
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:58,800
''They will break every heart''

564
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,500
''Go on lass''

565
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,300
''Do what you will''

566
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:06,900
''l've tainted you all over''

567
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,500
''Hey you...''

568
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,900
''l swear...''

569
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:16,800
''l'm going to have you spiked''

570
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:21,500
''l'll climb the spike for you.
Just tell me, l'll die right now''

571
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,600
''Shock me if you can''

572
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,000
''And l'm all yours''

573
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,200
''Remember my words''

574
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,000
''Some day, two hearts will meet''

575
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,700
''We're crazy about you''

576
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:41,000
''We're playful paramours''

577
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,500
''These Romeos are ruinous''

578
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:49,800
''They will break every heart''

579
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:53,400
''Why are you standing off?''

580
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,900
''Are you on a high?''

581
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,500
''Why are you standing off?
You're so close to my heart''

582
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:07,700
''Embrace me. Just find an excuse''

583
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:15,200
''ls it the stand.off
which sends you on a high?''

584
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,700
''lf you're calling me,
here l come''

585
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:22,700
''You should've thought
before taking the leap''

586
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:25,800
''Now that you've come,
don't go away''

587
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:30,200
''We're crazy about you''

588
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:35,100
''We're playful paramours''

589
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:39,800
''These Romeos are ruinous''

590
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:45,100
''They will break every heart''

591
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,200
''Be there sorrow, or come joy''

592
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:38,200
''The easterly still blows''

593
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:43,200
''One comes, one goes...''

594
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:48,300
''why are you holding
your heart back?''

595
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:54,200
''l'm not holding my heart back;
my heart holds me back''

596
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:05,600
''Will someone tell me, what's
the truth, what a mirage is...?''

597
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,600
''Everything in the world...''

598
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,900
''is so lovely''

599
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,600
''That's the only truth''

600
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,800
''Aren't the colours lively?''

601
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:22,200
''We're crazy about you''

602
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:27,100
''We're playful paramours''

603
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:31,800
''These Romeos are ruinous''

604
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:37,000
''They will break every heart''

605
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,600
''O' golden.eyed one...''

606
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:46,700
''either give me your heart,
or chide me''

607
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:51,100
''You liars''

608
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:55,300
''Behind that innocent face,
there's hidden a black heart''

609
01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:01,200
''We're crazy about you''

610
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:06,100
''We're playful paramours''

611
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:10,900
''These Romeos are ruinous''

612
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:16,200
''They will break every heart''

613
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:20,500
''l'm crazy about you''

614
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:25,200
''l'm your playful paramour''

615
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:29,800
''These Romeos are ruinous''

616
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:35,200
''They will break every heart''

617
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:43,000
My friends think that l was
very rude to you at the cafe...

618
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,400
the other day and l must apologise.

619
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:50,400
Oh! And what do you think?

620
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:55,600
l think they are right. l am sorry.

621
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,700
My friends think that you were
in the wrong too,

622
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:02,200
and you should also apologise.

623
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,700
Oh! And what do you think?

624
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:09,000
l think they are right.

625
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,700
Good. Now we are quits.

626
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:16,600
Oh no, we are not.
. Why not?

627
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:21,500
Because that day you slapped me
and l have still not hit you.

628
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:26,000
So, you want to slap me?

629
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:29,300
You want to hit a girl?

630
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:34,000
Well if the girl insists on
quitting things, what can l do.

631
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:39,700
Alright, l want to finish this,
once and for all.

632
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:45,200
Hit me. Come on hit me.

633
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,300
Actually, let it be,
my hands will get dirty.

634
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:06,100
my friends were totally wrong
about you and l was right.

635
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,600
You . how come you are here?

636
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,300
l have come to tell you something

637
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,100
Tell me?

638
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:32,900
Yes, but before that you will have to
promise me that you won't get angry.

639
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:35,600
Ok, l won't.

640
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:41,300
l found out everything about your life
about why you go to the station...

641
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:46,800
about your husband,
Major Khanna, everything.

642
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,800
l was brought up with the belief
that boys are the tough ones...

643
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:55,700
...and girls are weak, but you made
me realise how untrue it is.

644
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:00,200
You are very different from other girls
and it would make me proud if we...

645
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:05,000
could be friends, you promised me
that you will not get angry.

646
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:12,700
l am not angry . its just that...

647
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:18,600
l am not used to hearing
nice things about myself.

648
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,600
l am a married girl,

649
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:24,300
living in a small town here a boy
and a girl can never be friends...

650
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:29,100
it is considered wrong, and l do not
have the strength to prove it right.

651
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:37,400
You overestimated me,
l'm not that strong.

652
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:43,400
Who are you and me to decide
what is wrong and right?

653
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:47,400
Thats his job, lets leave it to him.

654
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:51,700
We can only follow our hearts
thats exactly what l am doing...

655
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:56,300
now its yourturn .
if your heart says that...

656
01:21:56,700 --> 01:22:00,600
...this is right then put
your hand forward...

657
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:06,200
otherwise walk away, and l promise
l''ll never come in yourway.

658
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:20,700
Hi! My name is Karan.
And yours ma'am?

659
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:24,700
Friends are not addressed
as ma'am. l am Kiran.

660
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:30,100
Great, lets go.
.Hey! At least do your prayers.

661
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:34,700
No need, my prayers are done.
Lets leave.

662
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:40,500
l don't believe this Samir
can't you find yourself a decent job?

663
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:44,300
Sanju, who is going to give
a student a part time job here?

664
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:47,600
And in any case, my mother says
that no work is big or small...

665
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,700
as long as you do it
with all your heart.

666
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:56,100
Okay, okay, stop giving me a lecture.
. l can't see Tom uncle, where is he?

667
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,500
Don't ask.
. Why?

668
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:01,800
Forthe past three hours
he has locked himself in the room...

669
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,300
opening all the old trunks and
whenever...

670
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:07,500
l ask him for a reason,
he does not answer.

671
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:21,400
Papa, what are you doing?

672
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:25,600
l can see that, but why are you
wearing this pre.historic costume.

673
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,900
Because l am going for a
date with Jenny.

674
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:33,000
Jenny aunty is going out with you.

675
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,400
Yes sir, after six months of wooing
her she has finally agreed.

676
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,800
But you neverwear a suit
so why today?

677
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,000
You see, Jenny likes
classy gentlemen...

678
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
thats why l thought
l'll impress herwith the suit.

679
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:47,900
How am l looking.

680
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:50,300
You are not looking good at all
Remove this.

681
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,300
What are you saying?

682
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:54,200
This was your mothers favourite
suit, wasn't it, tell me?

683
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,200
Papa, that was twenty years ago.

684
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,900
So what, does a suit change in
twenty years. What say Samir.

685
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:02,800
l think you are looking
terriffic Uncle. Smashing, superb

686
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,800
He does not know anything
you are not looking nice...

687
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,900
and you are not going out
like this, understood.

688
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:12,200
l am going my love . bye bye Samir

689
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:39,500
Relax uncle, Sanju just talks rubbish.
Would you like some chips?

690
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:44,200
Lift your arms up.

691
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:07,000
One should love you, the way you are,
Not the way she wants you to be...

692
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:13,400
lf someone tries to change you
then its not love but a compromise...

693
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:19,500
And darling, one doesn't
compromise in love, right.

694
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:41,800
Me and you locked in a room.

695
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,500
Samir, have you gone mad
Samir behave yourself.

696
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,900
And the key gets lost.

697
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:50,200
l'll be back from the conference by
tomorrow morning, make sure that...

698
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:55,500
everything is alright in Gurukul.
. Yes sir.

699
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:03,100
Morning Mr Aryan, what changes would
you like to make in Gurukul today.

700
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:07,400
Just a small change sir
l would like you to begin the day...

701
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:11,600
with some sweets . Today is
my birthday.

702
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,600
Congraluations Mr Aryan.

703
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,600
u'm sorry u am not auuowed
to have sweets...

704
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:23,500
Actually sir, there was something
l wanted to ask you for.

705
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,300
l knew you would ask me for something
tell me what can l do for you.

706
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,000
Sir, l was thinking of throwing a
small party forthe students...

707
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,200
they have given me so much respect
in such a small span of time.

708
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:41,600
l will be very happy to do something
forthem sir . only if you permit.

709
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,800
Alright Mr Aryan.
You can have the party.

710
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,900
But make sure that you
do not do anything...

711
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:55,500
...that will spoil the reputation
of Gurukul.

712
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:00,100
One more small request sir.

713
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:01,900
Now what Mr Aryan!

714
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,600
Sir, most of the students
are learning music...

715
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:09,300
...so l thought it would be really
nice to have a dance party.

716
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,700
l was wondering if l could invite
our neighbours,

717
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:15,600
Miss Monica's girls to join us...
that is only if you permit sir.

718
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,700
Till today girls have never
entered Gurukul Mr. Aryan...

719
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:23,800
and l would like to maintain
that tradition.

720
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:29,600
You are right sir, but we really cannot
have a dance party without girls sir...

721
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:33,700
and actually sir
l have sort of promised the boys.

722
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:38,600
Before making the promise
you should have asked me Mr Aryan!

723
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:44,400
You know l don't like changes.
Come on Ram Singh.

724
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,300
''There was this infatuated girl...''

725
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:43,000
''who loved a boy to death''

726
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
''Her eyes downcast...''

727
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
''she blushed...''

728
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,800
''as she traipsed down the alley''

729
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:54,800
''On the sly, she'd pen
her love.letters''

730
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:02,100
''Was it something she wished to say?
Oh, but whom was she afraid of?''

731
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:07,800
''And wheneverwe met,
she'd ask me...''

732
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,500
''How does love happen?''

733
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:13,800
''How does this love happen?''

734
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:17,700
''All l could tell herwas...''

735
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,900
''Whether your eyes
are open or shut...''

736
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:35,400
''you will always dream
of your loved one''

737
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:42,600
''Oh how do l tell you, my love...?''

738
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:47,900
''How love happens''

739
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:56,100
''Today, let's see what dying
for someone is like''

740
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:05,100
''Let's see how love happens''

741
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:12,400
''l was lost thinking of someone
when l wove my dreams''

742
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:21,500
''l was lost in someone's arms
when l fell in love with him''

743
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:37,500
''When you're in love,
you're never awake, nor asleep''

744
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:43,600
''Oh how do l tell you, my love,
how love happens?''

745
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:55,100
''Or is this some spell
that binds you?''

746
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:03,200
''A thousand hurdles
the heart will overcome''

747
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:10,500
''Far up, somewhere in the Heavens,
all this is decided''

748
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:19,600
''Who knows when, how, one will meet
the fellow traveller''

749
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:35,600
''The name that's writ on the heart
is the one you will fall for''

750
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:43,300
''Oh how do l tell you, my love,
how love happens?''

751
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:55,700
''Whether your eyes
are open or shut...''

752
01:35:55,700 --> 01:36:00,700
''you will always dream
of your loved one''

753
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:13,600
''Oh how do l tell you, my love,
how love happens?''

754
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:43,700
You will have to leave Mr. Aryan!

755
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:54,400
l am sorry that this had to happen,
because l had started liking you.

756
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,900
l thought that inspite of your
different ideas...

757
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:01,700
and non.traditional methods
you could...

758
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:06,300
become an important part of Gurukul
but l was wrong.

759
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:13,600
My first instinct about
you was correct...

760
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:17,900
you are a very arrogant and
indisciplined man...

761
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:22,000
and we do not need people
like you here.

762
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:27,300
l want your resignation on my table
first thing in the morning.

763
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:39,400
Why the sniggering Mr Aryan?

764
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:45,100
l'm sorry sir! Till today,
l had a lot of respect for you

765
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:50,500
. l thought you were a very
intelligent...

766
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:55,400
and sharp man . a man who would
never miss ...

767
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:58,600
anything but l am afraid
l am dissappointed.

768
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:03,000
What are you trying to say Mr Aryan?

769
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,500
Do you remember sir,
when l first came here for a job,

770
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:11,400
l told you my name . Raj Aryan...

771
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:15,700
today l am going to tell you
my full name...

772
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:22,100
Mr. Shankar, my full name is
Raj A Malhotra.

773
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:41,200
Yes, l am the same Raj Malhotra...

774
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:48,900
who had dared to fall in
love with your daughter...

775
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:55,500
the same Raj Malhotra whom your
daughter loved very much...

776
01:41:55,900 --> 01:42:00,000
the same Raj Malhotra whom you hated so
much that you threw him out of Gurukul.

777
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,300
without even seeing his face without
even giving him a chance to meet you...

778
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:11,500
without even hearing what
he had to say.

779
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:17,200
The same Raj Malhotra who could not get

780
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:19,700
...admission in any other educational
institution...

781
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:25,600
who could not get a decent job anywhere
but he worked on his own...

782
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:30,500
and today the country's most
prestigous...

783
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:32,700
...educational institution has
employed him.

784
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:37,000
Yes sir, the same man who promised...

785
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
to destroy me has welcomed
me with open arms.

786
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:50,800
And as far as my resignation goes
l am sorry, l cannot.

787
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:57,300
l have a contract in my hand which
clearly states that...

788
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:03,400
l cannot leave or be expelled...

789
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:08,500
till the end of the term .
signed Narayan Shankar.

790
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:15,400
And Mr Narayan Shankar .
by the time this term is over...

791
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:21,600
l promise you that Gurukul will
not be the same.

792
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:34,000
l loved only one woman all my life
and l will love her forever.

793
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:41,300
She gave up her life for you, believing
that it would make you kinder...

794
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:46,700
and bring love into this place and
that everything would change.

795
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:51,100
You denied me of my only love and...

796
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:56,400
this is a truth that l will have
to live with all my life.

797
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:03,400
But there is one more truth that
l cannot live with...

798
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:12,700
and that is the fact that the
girl l loved died in vain.

799
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:19,800
The fact that nothing has changed here
that l cannot bearto live with.

800
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:33,900
l promise you Mr. Shankar,
by the time l leave...

801
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:37,800
l will fill this place with so much
love that ...

802
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:42,600
it will take you ten lifetimes
to remove it.

803
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,800
l will fill this place with so
much sunshine....

804
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:52,100
that a man who has been staring at the
sun for 50 years, will have to blink.

805
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,400
What happened to us will
not happen to anyone else.

806
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:12,300
This l promise.

807
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:36,600
''Even afterthe lovers have died...''

808
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:41,800
''aftertheir beloveds
have perished...''

809
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:46,900
''their loves live on, forever

810
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:52,100
''Their loves live on, forever''

811
01:47:43,100 --> 01:47:47,200
Todays newspaper and yourtea
both are kept next to your chair.

812
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:51,000
l had made the tea ten minutes
back so its already cold,

813
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,500
just the way you like.

814
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:53,900
l am leaving early for college
today but...

815
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:56,200
l have told Bahadur for your
breakfast...

816
01:47:56,200 --> 01:48:00,400
and l have also given your clothes
for ironing . and by the way...

817
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:05,900
today is my birthday
you can wish me if you want.

818
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:13,100
l forgot once again. Come here.

819
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:31,500
l must be the worlds worst father.

820
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:36,800
No, not at all you are the
best father in the world.

821
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:42,000
Happy birthday my child.

822
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,900
l pray that you get everything you
everwant,

823
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:50,400
and all your dreams come true.

824
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:59,800
Pretty, but still not as
beautiful as mom.

825
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,400
Let me see.

826
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:05,400
Oh its you, papa when did you come
l was just...

827
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:09,700
Wait a minute, lets see

828
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:25,400
l think my daughter is more beautiful
than your mother. What do you think?

829
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:34,700
Do you know ever since you were
a kid you have been wearing your....

830
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:39,200
mother's mangalsutra and duppatta
and dressing up as a bride.

831
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:44,200
l think now the time has
come to get you married.

832
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:50,000
Stop it papa!
. Why?

833
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:55,500
Hello, Hi. l am busy now
l 'll phone you later . ok ...bye!

834
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:58,700
Who was that?

835
01:49:58,700 --> 01:50:02,000
That was Priya.
She keeps calling and boring me.

836
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,800
Now you go change your clothes and
l will make you some hot coffee.

837
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:36,900
Papa, papa
l have come to apologize to you.

838
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:43,500
Apologize! Forwhat?

839
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:52,900
Papa, you always taught me
neverto lie but l lied to you.

840
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:59,900
That day when you were in my room
and the phone rang....

841
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:06,800
l told you it was Priya but
it was not Priya papa .

842
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:10,100
. it was someone else.

843
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:13,800
Who was it?

844
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:19,000
lt was a boy.

845
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:27,000
A boy whom l have known for a
very long time . someone who has...

846
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:34,700
become much more than a friend
a boy who loves me very much...

847
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:42,000
someone who l love very much.

848
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:45,700
l know l should have told
you earlier...

849
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:51,200
but l was scared that
you would get angry.

850
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:58,000
You have always told me that love
leads to pain

851
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:06,500
but l do not know what
it was about him...

852
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:10,500
that l just could not stop myself.

853
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:16,000
When you meet him you will
realize that how different he is,

854
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,300
how sweet he is, how true he is.

855
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:30,600
You had hoped that all
my dreams come true...

856
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:40,600
he is my one and only dream and...

857
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:46,500
afterthis l do not want anything else.
. Whats his name?

858
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Raj...Raj Malhotra.
. What does he do?

859
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:01,000
He is a student in Gurukul.

860
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:10,900
You are not angry no papa!
Papa, please don't be angry.

861
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,500
l have come to tell you that...

862
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:56,100
Raj Malhotra has been expelled
from Gurukul.

863
01:53:56,100 --> 01:54:02,000
l did not meet him, l do not know
what he looks like,

864
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:07,200
and l hope l never see him.

865
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:10,100
l have sent him somewhere
far away from here,

866
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:14,900
and l would like you to forget him.

867
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:24,000
l know you must be thinking that my
decision is cruel, and wrong...

868
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:29,400
but l know that this is
the best thing for your future.

869
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:28,900
Yourtea is kept there but the
newspaper guy has still not come....

870
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:34,000
lts Sunday, so l think he is
running a little late by the way...

871
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:35,700
Bahadur is unwell.

872
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:40,600
So let me know what you will have for
breakfast, l will make it myself.

873
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:51,500
Are you alright?

874
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:56,800
l am absolutely fine papa
l am absolutely fine.

875
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:02,400
Thats enough, its quite late...

876
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:07,900
and you have to get up early
in the morning . open your mouth.

877
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:25,100
Do you know that you are
the world's best daughter.

878
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:29,500
Are you happy?

879
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:32,700
Are you happy, papa?
. Very much.

880
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:36,900
Then l am also very happy.
Good night, papa.

881
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:18,900
l'm sorry papa
l tried to forget him...

882
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:22,900
l tried very hard not
to think about him...

883
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:27,000
to stop loving him but
l just could not.

884
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:32,000
l love you very much, papa and

885
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:37,600
l can never hurt you,
but l love him too...

886
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:43,300
and l cannot live without him.

887
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:48,800
l hope someday you realise that
love is very beautiful...

888
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:53,200
even if it comes with
a little pain.

889
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:18,500
Ever since the day she told me
about you, l have hated you.

890
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:26,300
l hated you so much that
l neverwanted to see your face.

891
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:31,200
l never everwanted to hear
your voice...

892
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:35,900
and today you are standing in
front of me on my doorstep.

893
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:38,500
lf l want l can drag you out
of that gate...

894
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:40,200
and throw you out of this place...

895
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:47,000
and no piece of paper can stop me
but l am not going to do that...

896
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:51,100
because now l want you to stay.

897
01:59:51,900 --> 02:00:02,100
You have given a 55 year old man a
reason to fight again .

898
02:00:02,700 --> 02:00:08,500
he has to prove all over again,
that for25 years whatever...

899
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:13,600
he has stood for and believed in,
still holds true.

900
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:20,700
You were right about me Mr. Aryan
like you even l love challenges.

901
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:29,100
So, now you do what you have to and
l'll do ...

902
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:32,900
what l have been doing for
the last 25 years.

903
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:43,000
The foundation of this structure
is so strong that no Raj Aryan,

904
02:00:43,300 --> 02:00:46,400
with a violin in his hand
and a smile on his face...

905
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:50,900
will ever dare to walk in
here to change things around.

906
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:55,900
Never, Mr. Raj Aryan, never.

907
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:12,400
Megha, you were right.
lts not easy to win from your father.

908
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:23,100
He is one tough man .
but we are no less.

909
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:52,600
Vicky, Vicky, give it back.
Samir l am warning you.

910
02:01:56,900 --> 02:01:59,600
Do any of you know
how to play the piano?

911
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:03,800
lt's okay, it's okay.
l needed somebody to teach...

912
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:08,000
Major Khanna's grandson, but never
mind maybe someone else would know.

913
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:21,700
Vicky have'nt we heard
this name before, Major Khanna

914

917
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:16,500
Now Ayush, l want you to learn to play
the piano before your papa comes back.

918
02:03:17,700 --> 02:03:22,500

be playing even betterthan me.

919
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:28,000
Ok Karan, l am leaving

920
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:36,700

younger daughter in . law Kiran and...

921

922
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:51,000
Karan, if you do not mind, can you
teach hertoo, along with Ayush.

923
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:52,800
Sister . in . law!

924
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:56,700

925
02:03:56,700 --> 02:03:57,600
Sister . in . law!

926
02:03:57,600 --> 02:04:00,200
Ok, ok, she does not do it anymore.

Ramu kaka water!

02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:33,900
You nevertold me that
you used to dance?

934
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:40,600
Why?

935
02:04:41,300 --> 02:04:45,500
You ask too many questions.
. Thats because you never answer.

936
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:49,600
Have you come here to teach Ayush
piano lessons orto chat with me?

937
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:53,900
What do you think?

938
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:10,600
lshika my child, meet your new dance
partner Vikram, not Viren! . right.

939
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:15,200
Vikram l want you know that this
dance competition...

940
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:18,200
...is a matter of prestige for
our college and...

941
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:24,700
that is why on my request Mr.Raj Aryan
has sent you to help us out.

942
02:05:27,100 --> 02:05:32,700
lshika, l want you'll to become friends
and in one month, show me something...

943
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:38,400
really spectacular and special.

944
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:47,400
Wipe that stupid grin off your face
it makes you look even more stupid.

945
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:52,900
l have been winning this dance
competition forthe past three years...

946
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:57,500
and l am not going to end up loosing
this year because of an idiot like you

947
02:05:57,900 --> 02:06:02,900
. so if you do not wish to make a
fool of yourself just leave quietly.

948
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:04,800
No please, don't do that.

949
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:07,300
l have been waiting for
this all my life,

950
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:11,100
all l have everwanted is
to be able to dance with you.

951
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:20,100
Afterthis even if l die l will have
no regrets. Please dance with me.

952
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:26,700
Your sense of humour is just
like you sick and disgusting!

953
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:30,300
My name is lshika!

954
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:31,400
My friends feel that l was rude ...

955
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:36,200
to you the other day when
you had come to apologize.

956
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:39,100
And what do you feel?

957
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:43,400
l think they are right.
l am sorry.

958
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:49,900
Now, can you leave me?

959
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:54,300
l do not feel like.
. Do you feel like a slap you.

960
02:06:56,600 --> 02:07:01,500
lf the girl smiles then she's yours.
. What?

961
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:01,900
Nothing.

962
02:07:03,900 --> 02:07:09,300
Ok, leave me.
. Leave you?

963
02:07:49,700 --> 02:07:55,200
You did'nt join us.
. l am just.

964
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:12,600
l would like to remind you that
till you are a part of Gurukul....

965
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:16,100
it is your duty to follow the
traditions of this place.

966
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:20,700
Next time l do not want
to see you outside the temple

967
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:24,800
l'm sorry sir but
l will not come into the temple.

968
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:28,600
l have an old score to
settle with him...

969
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:33,000
he took the one person
who believed in him the most.

970
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:37,000
Challenging us mortals
was not enough for you,

971
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,600
that you have
decided to take on God.

972
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:43,500
No sir, My God is my consience.

973
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:50,300
l do not believe in any other God.

974
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:59,800
Take this .
for all your battles.

975
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:04,500
l'm sorry sir, but l cannot.

976
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:09,400
Because to take this l would have to
touch your feet, like the others...

977
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,000
and that is something that
my heart will not allow me to do.

978
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:20,400
l do not force anyone to touch my feet
Mr. Aryan .they do it out of respect.

979
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:25,500
They touch your feet out of fear and
you mistake their fear for respect

980
02:09:25,900 --> 02:09:27,100
. but l'm...

981
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:32,000
But you are not scared of me Mr. Aryan.
l know that...

982
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:36,300
the other day you had put at tika
on my forehead ..

983
02:09:36,300 --> 02:09:41,100
...that day l had nothing
to give you.

984
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:45,700
Today, accept this as a blessing...

985
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:48,700
and it would remove a burden
from my head...

986
02:09:48,700 --> 02:09:53,800
and make us quits and yes
you do not have to touch my feet.

987
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:05,700
lf this is about removing your burden
then l accept.

988
02:10:11,100 --> 02:10:16,300
You too sir.

989
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,300
Samir! What are you doing here?

990
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:53,000
Working, what else?

991
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:57,200
For 500 rupees on a Sunday and
the chance to see a Singhania party...

992
02:10:57,200 --> 02:11:00,800
...only a fool can
refuse such an offer.

993
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:02,100
l don't believe you,
anyway its great that ...

994
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:03,800
...i found you,
now just stay with me.

995
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:06,200
Sanjana, leave my hand
it does not look good

996
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:07,400
l am supposed to be working here
and besides this is...

997
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:11,300
your boyfriends party so l am sure
you know everyone here.

998
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:14,500
No, l do not .these are all Deepak's
friends. l do not know them that well.

999
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:19,300
l'm sorry Sanjana . but l do not want
to get fired because of you . Ok.

1000
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:24,300
Come let me introduce you to everyone.
Where have you been, come on, come on.

1001
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:29,100
What rubbish.

1002
02:11:56,400 --> 02:12:04,500
l was just kidding .
Come on give me your hand, c'mon

1003
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:45,800
Listen Sanjana l'm sorry, ok.
l should not have done that . please.

1004
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:49,600
Enough Deepak, enough.

1005
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:14,100
All guys are alike.

1006
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:16,700
You said something?

1007
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:19,200
You know, you boys are so stupid.

1008
02:13:19,200 --> 02:13:23,400
lts so easy for any girl
to draw your attention.

1009
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:27,000
All she needs to do is dress
suggestively like our dear friend...

1010
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:30,900
Sonia and she's got you'll all
wrapped around her little finger.

1011
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:33,800
Thats all you boys ever
think of, right.

1012
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:37,400
You'll neverthink of what kind of
person she is what is in her heart...

1013
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:40,200
...how she talks, do you'll?

1014
02:13:40,200 --> 02:13:45,000
You're right,
we neverthink of such things, never!

1015
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:53,700
Do you know what your problem is
you are jealous of Sonia.

1016
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:57,100
l am jealous of Sonia?

1017
02:13:57,100 --> 02:14:01,000
Yes. Because basically you
want to be just like Sonia,

1018
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,200
but you know that is impossible
lets face it,...

1019
02:14:03,200 --> 02:14:07,700
...you do not have what it takes and
that makes you hate her even more.

1020
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:13,600
l think you have a big complex and
you should deal with it.

1021
02:14:15,800 --> 02:14:19,900
Listen Mr Vikram Oberoi, Neither am l
jealous nor do l hate anyone.

1022
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:24,800
l am very happy the way
l am . as for your Sonia

1023
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:27,400
l can be like her anytime,
if l want to.

1024
02:14:27,400 --> 02:14:31,800
But she can never be like me,
ever . understand.

1025
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:36,900
Believe me lshika
You can never look like Sonia

1026
02:14:41,200 --> 02:14:45,200
Vicky, l am not getting this dance
step do help me please.

1027
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:04,900
Why are you not ready yet
we have to go to Mr. Sharma's house.

1028
02:15:04,900 --> 02:15:07,700
l do not feel like going.

1029
02:15:07,700 --> 02:15:13,800
Everytime the same excuse,
sometimes its good to go out...

1030
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:17,100
meet people, make friends.

1031
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:21,200
You cannot shut yourself from
the world, forever . can you?

1032
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,200
Ok, take yourtime...

1033
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:32,400
we will be late make sure
that Ayush sleeps on time...

1034
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:37,100
and no MTV orZTV for him.

1035
02:15:55,000 --> 02:16:00,500
A small gift, for a girl,
who is incomplete without this.

1036
02:16:03,100 --> 02:16:07,400
What happened?
You did not like the gift.

1037
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:10,100
You, what are you doing here?
Have you gone mad?

1038
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:12,200
lf somebody sees you,
do you know what will happen.

1039
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:13,900
Relax, no one has seen me.

1040
02:16:13,900 --> 02:16:15,100
l don't know anything,
just go from here.

1041
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:18,800
Ok, Ok, l will go on one condition.

1042
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:19,500
What?

1043
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:23,300
l want to see you dance
wearing these ghungroos, just once.

1044
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:24,200
l cannot do it.

1045
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:28,600
Hey, you can't say no,
its the first rule of friendship...

1046
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:32,000
you can never say no
to anything that a friend asks for.

1047
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,700
Karan stop it .
l am getting very scared.

1048
02:16:33,700 --> 02:16:37,800
Nandini, Nandini . hurry up,
we are getting late.

1049
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:39,500
Yes father, l am downstairs.

1050
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:42,100
Karan, you please go from here.

1051
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:43,400
First promise me.

1052
02:16:43,400 --> 02:16:48,400
l do not know how to dance . l used to
do it before, but now l have forgotten.

1053
02:16:49,100 --> 02:16:55,500
Listen, l wanted to make my friend
happy so l got her a gift.

1054
02:16:55,900 --> 02:16:59,900
Now if you feel like making your
friend happy then come to ...

1055
02:16:59,900 --> 02:17:05,000
...the terrace wearing those
ghungroos it's as simple as that.

1056
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:15,200
Why are you doing all this, Karan?

1057
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:19,200
Because there is this friend of
mine who is scared to be happy...

1058
02:17:19,900 --> 02:17:25,100
...l want to show her how easy
it is, to be happy.

1059
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:45,600
Why did this happen Samir
how could l make such a big mistake.

1060
02:17:47,900 --> 02:17:53,200
Do you really want to know?

1061
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:14,100
This was your mistake this is not
Sanjana, this is someone else.

1062
02:18:43,300 --> 02:18:48,400
This is my Sanju clumsy, messy, cute.

1063
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:53,900
You had forgotten yourself,
when you were with Deepak...

1064
02:18:55,300 --> 02:19:00,600
you had become the way he wanted
to see you .this was your mistake.

1065
02:19:10,300 --> 02:19:19,400
He should love you forwhat you are
and not forwhat he wants you to be...

1066
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:26,900
lf someone tries to change you,
then it is not love, but a compromise

1067
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:37,800
And darling, one does'nt compromise
in love. You forgot your own rule.

1068
02:19:43,700 --> 02:19:44,200
Lets go.

1069
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:55,800
Samir, can you hold me in your arms
please.

1070
02:28:19,900 --> 02:28:25,300
You won.
Their love stories have begun, you won.

1071
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:30,300
We won!

1072
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:05,700
''Come, steal me from my self''

1073
02:29:06,100 --> 02:29:10,200
''Hide me somewhere in your heart''

1074
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:26,900

1075

1078
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:50,800

1079
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:55,400

1080
02:29:56,400 --> 02:30:01,800

''Give me a shy smile''

1087
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:26,100
''Let the wind catch your veil''

1088
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:30,700
''l could let my hair spread,
but it could turn day into night''

1089
02:31:31,700 --> 02:31:36,700
''l could let my veil wave with the wind
but there could be a cloudburst of desire''

1090
02:31:37,400 --> 02:31:42,400
''Let it pour''

1091
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:48,200
''We have something
to talk about''

1092
02:31:48,700 --> 02:31:54,000
''Come to me.Take me in your arms''

1093
02:31:54,800 --> 02:31:59,600
''Come, steal me from my self''

1094
02:32:00,300 --> 02:32:05,200

''Come to me. Take me in your arms''

1098
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:40,200
''l could die for you''

1099
02:33:41,500 --> 02:33:46,300
''l'm going to die''

1100
02:33:47,100 --> 02:33:51,100
''They all say that''

1101
02:33:52,300 --> 02:33:57,100
''l'll do it''

1102
02:33:57,400 --> 02:34:00,000
''A little vermilion...''

1103
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,900
''fill in my hair''

1104
02:34:02,900 --> 02:34:05,800
''Who has seen tomorrow?''

1105
02:34:05,800 --> 02:34:09,000
''Do it all, today, now''

1106
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:13,900
''Whether or not, everyone agrees''

1107
02:34:13,900 --> 02:34:17,000
''When hearts avow''

1108
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:20,000

02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:42,300
''Come, steal me from my self''

1113
02:34:43,100 --> 02:34:48,300

1116
02:34:59,400 --> 02:35:03,700
''Come to me. Take me in your arms''

1117
02:36:44,200 --> 02:36:46,600
What is your name?

1118
02:36:46,600 --> 02:36:50,100
Sir, Vi ..Vi...Vic...Vikram , Sir.

1119
02:36:50,100 --> 02:36:53,300
Are you aware of the
rules of Gurukul?

1120
02:36:53,300 --> 02:36:53,700
Yes sir!

1121
02:36:55,300 --> 02:36:59,300
So you know that you have broken
one of the rules...

1122
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:03,200
...and that you can be
expelled for it.

1123
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:03,800
Yes sir!

1124
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:09,700
So tell me Vikram what is
the reason for your carelessness?

1125
02:37:10,300 --> 02:37:14,700
Sir, l was, l was....

1126
02:37:17,400 --> 02:37:28,600
Vicky...
Did you reach the station on time.

1127
02:37:30,100 --> 02:37:31,300
Station sir?

1128
02:37:31,300 --> 02:37:35,600
The parcel that l gave you did
the station master accept it?

1129
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:40,500
Parcel, yes sir. The station
master accepted your parcel sir.

1130
02:37:41,200 --> 02:37:46,100
Great . its very late, you go to
bed and Vicky thank you very much.

1131
02:38:05,400 --> 02:38:08,900
lts very late sir . you
should also go to sleep,

1132
02:38:08,900 --> 02:38:10,300
otherwise forthe first time...

1133
02:38:10,300 --> 02:38:17,000
the sun will rise before you do.
Good night.

1134
02:39:04,400 --> 02:39:08,000
l have called all of you here because

1135
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:09,900
l have found out that
a few students are...

1136
02:39:09,900 --> 02:39:12,800
trying to break the discipline of
Gurukul a few students have been...

1137
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:18,600
...leaving the campus regularly
and not returning on time.

1138
02:39:21,800 --> 02:39:25,800
l would like to remind them that
breaking the rules of Gurukul...

1139
02:39:25,800 --> 02:39:30,800
... will not be tolerated.

1140
02:39:33,400 --> 02:39:38,600
l think my silence has been
misunderstood to be my weakness.

1141
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:45,700
So from today, the Gurukul gate
will be shut at all times.

1142
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:50,700
From now on no one will leave the gates
of this campus, under any circumstance.

1143
02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:53,900
Anyone caught will be expelled
immediately l repeat...

1144
02:39:53,900 --> 02:40:08,200
...anyone caught will be expelled
immediately. You'll can go now.

1145
02:40:33,700 --> 02:40:39,100
Mr.Aryan l know everything
that goes on in Gurukul...

1146
02:40:39,700 --> 02:40:44,300
...nothing escapes my eyes.

1147
02:40:46,500 --> 02:40:52,000
Those three boys will
have to stop going out.

1148
02:40:55,400 --> 02:41:00,100
There will be no part time working
no piano playing, and no dancing.

1149
02:41:05,100 --> 02:41:09,500
l would like you to be the one
to break this news to them.

1150
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:14,800
Yes sir.

1151
02:41:41,600 --> 02:41:45,800
lts nice to see you smiling
Mr. Shankar.

1152
02:41:47,100 --> 02:41:49,900
lt must be a very special morning.

1153
02:41:49,900 --> 02:41:52,300
Definitely Mr. Aryan.

1154
02:41:52,300 --> 02:41:54,500
Do you see these blowing
winds these winds...

1155
02:41:54,500 --> 02:41:58,700
have been blowing from
the east for years.

1156
02:42:00,400 --> 02:42:07,200
Some time back they had changed their
direction to the west, but now...

1157
02:42:07,700 --> 02:42:12,700
they are back to normal.

1158
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:19,900
Today, everything is back to
normal Mr. Aryan.

1159
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,100
lt is a very special morning.

1160
02:42:23,100 --> 02:42:27,600
Congratulations Mr. Shankar,
even the winds are scared of you...

1161
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:31,100
even they know that you
do not like changes.

1162
02:42:31,100 --> 02:42:35,800
lt just shows the power of
your fear.

1163
02:42:37,100 --> 02:42:42,000
You were the one who made me aware
of the power of my fear Mr. Aryan.

1164
02:42:43,500 --> 02:42:48,200
You were the one who told me
that everyone is scared of me .

1165
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:51,300
that they love you,
and fear me . right.

1166
02:42:51,300 --> 02:42:55,400
But l want you to know something
Mr. Aryan...

1167
02:42:55,400 --> 02:43:00,800
...that in the battle of love and fear,
fearwill always win.

1168
02:43:01,400 --> 02:43:05,600
Till now you have only
seen the power of fear.

1169
02:43:07,400 --> 02:43:11,900
You have still not seen
the power of love.

1170
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:26,000
l would like to see such power,
Mr. Aryan.

1171
02:43:30,200 --> 02:43:34,800
l would really like to see
that happen.

1172
02:43:35,700 --> 02:43:41,100
Now you'll definitely see the power
of love you definitely will.

1173
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:07,300
Today is 14th February
Valentines Day ,the day of love.

1174
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:12,400
Today l am going to begin
by telling you a love story.

1175
02:44:12,400 --> 02:44:17,700
A story of a boy, a girl and a leaf
a story of one of you'll, a boy ...

1176
02:44:18,200 --> 02:44:24,100
from Gurukul, but there was one
difference he was in love,

1177
02:44:24,500 --> 02:44:27,300
and he had decided that on this day,

1178
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:33,900
he would tell her everything,
not worrying about the consequences.

1179
02:44:37,500 --> 02:44:40,300
She was standing at the bus stop
with her friends...

1180
02:44:40,300 --> 02:44:42,900
waiting to leave for
the college picnic.

1181
02:44:42,900 --> 02:44:46,500
The boy had sneaked out of Gurukul
and had come running to see her.

1182
02:44:46,500 --> 02:44:49,300
He saw her getting into the bus,

1183
02:44:49,300 --> 02:44:51,900
he immediately took out
a pen from his pocket...

1184
02:44:51,900 --> 02:44:54,200
and tried to find something
to write on.

1185
02:44:54,200 --> 02:44:57,900
Then he picked up a leaf from the
ground and wrote on it.

1186
02:44:57,900 --> 02:45:02,400
Dear Megha, l love you.
He gave it to a kid on the street...

1187
02:45:03,100 --> 02:45:04,900
and pointed towards the girl.

1188
02:45:04,900 --> 02:45:06,600
The kid ran with the leaf
towards the girl...

1189
02:45:06,600 --> 02:45:09,000
who was just about to enterthe bus.

1190
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:13,100
Just then there was a convoy of army
trucks which blocked his view,

1191
02:45:13,100 --> 02:45:15,200
and he could not see the girl.

1192
02:45:15,200 --> 02:45:19,900
When the last truck crossed him...

1193
02:45:20,300 --> 02:45:24,200
he saw that all the girls had
already got into the bus.

1194
02:45:25,300 --> 02:45:28,000
As he turned, he saw the same kid
standing in front of him...

1195
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:29,600
holding the leaf.

1196
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:32,100
There was something written on
the other side of the leaf...

1197
02:45:32,100 --> 02:45:36,100
l have waited so long to
hearthis . Megha.

1198
02:45:36,100 --> 02:45:38,100
But, by that time the bus had
already left.

1199
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:43,300
He ran behind the bus and
stopped in the middle of the road.

1200
02:45:47,300 --> 02:45:51,600
He turned, he saw her standing
in front of him.

1201
02:46:34,600 --> 02:46:42,400
So this was a true love story
that happened on Valentines Day.

1202
02:46:44,300 --> 02:46:46,200
Sir, what happened next?

1203
02:46:46,200 --> 02:46:51,100
Then, they got married and they
lived happily ever after, right sir?

1204
02:46:53,500 --> 02:46:57,900
Wrong! What happened next,
you all know.

1205
02:46:59,800 --> 02:47:02,900
Because this is the story of the one...

1206
02:47:02,900 --> 02:47:05,300
and only student who was
thrown out of Gurukul.

1207
02:47:05,300 --> 02:47:09,900
The one who some of
you'll call the crazy lover.

1208
02:47:10,400 --> 02:47:17,300
Was he crazy orwas he just mad,
orwas he a boy just like you'll...

1209
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:23,200
l do not know.

1210
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:27,900
But l know one thing that he
listened to his heart all his life.

1211
02:47:28,100 --> 02:47:32,200
l know that he gave up everything
forthe woman he loved...

1212
02:47:32,900 --> 02:47:40,900
and l know that he stills loves her...

1213
02:47:42,500 --> 02:47:54,900
and each day the love
deepens more and more.

1214
02:47:57,100 --> 02:48:01,800
How do you know so much about him?

1215
02:48:06,500 --> 02:48:14,100
How do l know so much about him
how do l know so much!

1216
02:49:32,900 --> 02:49:37,500
My name is not Vikram Oberoi,
but Vikram kapoor.

1217
02:49:37,500 --> 02:49:42,200
My father is not a rich industrialist
but is a bank accountant.

1218
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:47,200
And the friendship that l had
started with a lie...

1219
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:49,700
l want to end it with the truth...

1220
02:49:49,700 --> 02:49:56,700
and the truth is that
l am madly in love with you.

1221
02:50:03,200 --> 02:50:08,400
l know it is not easy to
love a stubborn,

1222
02:50:08,400 --> 02:50:14,800
and spoilt girl like you,
but l know that...

1223
02:50:15,400 --> 02:50:19,800
behind this stubborn girl,
is a cute little girl...

1224
02:50:21,300 --> 02:50:27,800
who reads love stories at night and
dreams about love, even in the day.

1225
02:50:30,100 --> 02:50:35,400
Behind this spoilt girl, there
is a girl with a clear consience...

1226
02:50:35,400 --> 02:50:39,500
who sweetly accepts her mistakes
and says ''sorry.''

1227
02:50:42,700 --> 02:50:46,700
Behind this lshika Dhanrajgir
is my cute,

1228
02:50:46,700 --> 02:50:51,600
stupid little lshq whom l love
and cannot live without.

1229
02:51:39,300 --> 02:51:43,000
You talk a lot.

1230
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:47,200
lf you quieten me like this,
l will never shut up.

1231
02:51:56,200 --> 02:52:01,100
l want you to leave Karan . for ever.

1232
02:52:01,100 --> 02:52:05,400
But why, what have l done?

1233
02:52:05,400 --> 02:52:11,700
You've not done anything Karan infact,
you have only given me happiness.

1234
02:52:12,300 --> 02:52:16,100
You brought back music and gave
me your friendship...

1235
02:52:16,100 --> 02:52:19,500
forwhich l will always be grateful .

1236
02:52:19,500 --> 02:52:24,800
but you also brought back those
dreams, desires, and hopes...

1237
02:52:25,300 --> 02:52:28,400
that l had shut out, and kept in
a little corner of my heart .

1238
02:52:28,400 --> 02:52:32,400
those dreams that belonged to a
seventeen year old Kiran...

1239
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:38,100
those dreams that have no place
in this Kiran's life.

1240
02:52:40,600 --> 02:52:47,100
l cannot be your friend anymore
please forgive me and forget me.

1241
02:52:53,200 --> 02:52:57,300
There is a rule of friendship Kiran
that once you put your hand forward...

1242
02:52:58,100 --> 02:53:00,100
it can never be taken back.

1243
02:53:00,100 --> 02:53:02,100
Please Karan, go from here.

1244
02:53:02,100 --> 02:53:05,100
Today l had come here to tell you
something Kiran...

1245
02:53:05,100 --> 02:53:09,600
and l am not going back
till l say it.

1246
02:53:26,500 --> 02:53:31,100
What did you want to tell her
even l would like to hear it.

1247
02:53:45,500 --> 02:53:50,100
Sir, l came here to tell herthat
l love her...

1248
02:53:52,600 --> 02:53:58,300
...that l love her very much
and l know that even she

1249
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:21,400
l think you have got your answer
now leave and never come back.

1250
02:54:35,300 --> 02:54:39,600
Wait, Karan!

1251
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:50,600
Do you love this boy?

1252
02:54:50,600 --> 02:54:54,900
Tell me the truth,
do you love him.

1253
02:54:55,400 --> 02:54:57,400
Nandini, do you realise
what you are saying?

1254
02:54:57,400 --> 02:55:00,400
For once in your life Kiran,
listen to your heart and...

1255
02:55:00,400 --> 02:55:02,100
tell me if you love Karan.

1256
02:55:02,100 --> 02:55:04,700
Nandini, you are talking
to a married girl.

1257
02:55:04,700 --> 02:55:06,000
No, Major General Khanna

1258
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:09,000
l am talking to a girl whose
husband is dead

1259
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:12,000
l am talking to a widow
Major General Khanna

1260
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:16,500
l am talking to a widow

1261
02:55:17,800 --> 02:55:19,600
Look at this girl closely,

1262
02:55:19,600 --> 02:55:26,300
and for once do not look at her
as the youngest daughter.in.law ...

1263
02:55:26,800 --> 02:55:29,700
of your family, but instead,
look at her as the young girl,

1264
02:55:29,700 --> 02:55:31,500
whom you had brought into this...

1265
02:55:31,500 --> 02:55:35,300
house with promises
and dreams of a happy life.

1266
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:40,000
Look at her as the girl, who has,
fortwo years...

1267
02:55:40,700 --> 02:55:42,800
quietly played the role of
a married girl just for you.

1268
02:55:42,800 --> 02:55:48,000
So that by seeing her, you can keep
believing that your son is alive.

1269
02:55:51,200 --> 02:55:56,100
Look at her, and ask yourself,

1270
02:56:00,300 --> 02:56:04,600
what is wrong if someone falls
in love with her...

1271
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:12,800
what is wrong if she falls in love
with someone, what is so wrong?

1272
02:56:16,700 --> 02:56:22,800
Your son is dead,
at least let her live.

1273
02:56:28,600 --> 02:56:33,900
My son is not dead.
My son is not dead.

1274
02:57:21,500 --> 02:57:27,800
Ever since we used to laugh and cry
about small things, l have loved you.

1275
02:57:28,300 --> 02:57:34,200
Ever since we used to dance
in the rains l have loved you.

1276
02:57:34,700 --> 02:57:40,000
When we used to sneak out to the
terrace and count the stars...

1277
02:57:40,500 --> 02:57:43,100
l have loved you.

1278
02:57:43,100 --> 02:57:48,400
Now, l myself, have forgotten
since when, l have loved you.

1279
02:57:49,200 --> 02:57:54,900
l can only say, that l have loved you
and only you.

1280
02:58:22,400 --> 02:58:26,200
You love me so much?

1281
02:58:29,200 --> 02:58:32,700
Since when?

1282
02:58:32,700 --> 02:58:33,800
Always.

1283
02:58:35,600 --> 02:58:39,700
And till today,
you never said a thing.

1284
02:58:41,700 --> 02:58:47,400
ldiot . Stupid . Now what are you
standing and staring at my face.

1285
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:52,800
Come on, take me in your arms.

1286
02:59:10,400 --> 02:59:16,800
Kakeji, you used to give me roses etc.
today am l not getting a leaf?

1287
02:59:19,100 --> 02:59:25,000
No Preetoji, from now on Kake
will nevertrouble you.

1288
02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:32,000
Seeing these kids, l have figured
out what a perfect pair looks like.

1289
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:41,800
You are very pretty, and smart and l'm
a stupid looking and uneducated.

1290
02:59:42,300 --> 02:59:45,600
This pair is all wrong.

1291
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:48,700
You need not worry, from today, you'll
never have to take your shoes in...

1292
02:59:48,700 --> 02:59:55,300
your hand, from today Kake will
nevertrouble you.

1293
02:59:57,200 --> 02:59:59,700
This is my final goodbye to you.

1294
02:59:59,700 --> 03:00:04,300
And what if aftertoday Preeto
starts troubling Kake.

1295
03:00:05,600 --> 03:00:06,200
What?

1296
03:00:07,800 --> 03:00:12,700
Then what. Eat sugar and die.
What do you think of yourself?

1297
03:00:13,600 --> 03:00:16,400
you have been giving me wierd stuff,
and saying rubbish...

1298
03:00:16,400 --> 03:00:20,800
and now you are saying, that from
today you will nevertrouble me.

1299
03:00:20,800 --> 03:00:24,500
Why will you not trouble me
you'll have to trouble me.

1300
03:00:24,500 --> 03:00:28,200
Because Preeto,
has gotten used to Kake nonsense.

1301
03:00:28,200 --> 03:00:33,000
And besides, Preeto likes Kake.

1302
03:00:33,600 --> 03:00:34,700
Likes ma'am?

1303

1347
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:38,100
''For all the hatred in the world...''

1348
03:09:38,200 --> 03:09:43,100
''hearts are still full of love''

1349
03:09:53,400 --> 03:09:57,900
''Even after lovers have died...''

1350
03:09:58,400 --> 03:10:02,800
''aftertheir beloveds have perished...''

1351
03:10:04,200 --> 03:10:08,200
''their loves live on, forever''

1352
03:11:01,300 --> 03:11:06,200
''Even after lovers have died...''

1353
03:11:06,200 --> 03:11:10,300
''aftertheir beloveds
have perished...''

1354
03:11:11,600 --> 03:11:16,600
''their loves live on, forever''

1355
03:11:16,600 --> 03:11:21,800
''Their loves live on, forever''

1356
03:12:01,900 --> 03:12:03,500
l know that this is not the first
time that the three of...

1357
03:12:03,500 --> 03:12:08,600
you'll have broken
the rules of Gurukul.

1358
03:12:08,800 --> 03:12:10,800
l also know that you'll are
responsible for...

1359
03:12:10,800 --> 03:12:15,700
the others behaving in a
similar fashion.

1360
03:12:25,300 --> 03:12:32,900
You'll have left me with no choice,
but before l take a decision,

1361
03:12:34,800 --> 03:12:37,500
l would like to ask you'll
one question,

1362
03:12:37,500 --> 03:12:42,800
and l would like you'll to think
very carefully before answering it...

1363
03:12:44,500 --> 03:12:48,700
...because whatever you will say,
will decide your fate.

1364
03:13:01,500 --> 03:13:05,800
Did you do this out of your
own free will

1365
03:13:06,100 --> 03:13:10,500
or is someone else
responsible forthis...

1366
03:13:10,500 --> 03:13:17,500
someone who encouraged and
forced you'll to do this,

1367
03:13:21,500 --> 03:13:26,700
think carefully and answer.

1368
03:13:30,800 --> 03:13:35,200
We take full responsibility
for our actions...

1369
03:13:35,200 --> 03:13:38,300
nobody else is responsible
forwhat we did.

1370
03:13:38,300 --> 03:13:42,800
We did what our hearts told
us to do.

1371
03:13:42,800 --> 03:13:45,500
And we do not regret
anything because...

1372
03:13:45,500 --> 03:13:50,200
we do not think we did
anything wrong.

1373
03:13:58,500 --> 03:14:03,000
This is your last day in Gurukul
start packing your bags.

1374
03:14:03,700 --> 03:14:07,600
You'll will be expelled in the
morning in front of everyone.

1375
03:16:04,700 --> 03:16:09,600
You won, l lost!

1376
03:16:10,600 --> 03:16:14,100
But do not punish them
for my mistakes...

1377
03:16:14,100 --> 03:16:16,800
do not do this to them, please.

1378
03:16:16,800 --> 03:16:21,400
l did not come here to make
another Raj Aryan.

1379
03:16:22,100 --> 03:16:26,400
l came here to make sure that
no one else becomes a Raj Aryan.

1380
03:16:28,300 --> 03:16:33,500
Forgive them, your battle is with
me and l am in front of you...

1381
03:16:36,600 --> 03:16:40,600
Defeated and lost.

1382
03:16:40,600 --> 03:16:45,300
l will do whatever you want
just forgive them.

1383
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:57,800
You won, l lost.

1384
03:17:19,500 --> 03:17:21,100
l want you to come tomorrow
morning...

1385
03:17:21,200 --> 03:17:23,400
and tell the students,
that whatever you...

1386
03:17:23,400 --> 03:17:33,400
have taught them, and
believed in, was wrong.

1387
03:17:37,200 --> 03:17:41,700
l want you to tell them, that you
do not believe in love and...

1388
03:17:43,600 --> 03:17:54,800
...that you are sorry for
misleading them...

1389
03:17:57,800 --> 03:18:04,000
...and then quietly leave Gurukul...

1390
03:18:07,600 --> 03:18:14,000
...and never come back.

1391
03:18:18,700 --> 03:18:19,400
Yes.

1392
03:18:25,500 --> 03:18:29,400
Good, you can go now.

1393
03:18:40,800 --> 03:18:46,000
l had told you Mr. Aryan,
in the battle of love and fear...

1394
03:18:47,300 --> 03:18:52,200
fearwill always win.

1395
03:19:10,100 --> 03:19:17,000
l am sorry sir, but from
where l see you lost.

1396
03:19:19,700 --> 03:19:24,900
Because from where l see, l see a
55 year old father standing below...

1397
03:19:26,100 --> 03:19:31,000
a garlanded photograph of his
19 year old daughter.

1398
03:19:33,700 --> 03:19:38,200
You lost then, and you lost now.

1399
03:19:46,400 --> 03:19:50,900
You everwondered Mr. Shankarthat
why did l ever come back to Gurukul?

1400
03:19:51,600 --> 03:19:59,000
Forwhom? The girl l loved
is no more...

1401
03:20:00,600 --> 03:20:05,000
who are Vicky, Samir,
and Karan to me.

1402
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:10,300
l did not even know them,
l did not know anyone here.

1403
03:20:13,900 --> 03:20:18,300
l came back for you, Mr. Shankar.

1404
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:26,400
l came back forthe father of
the girl, l loved.

1405
03:20:30,500 --> 03:20:35,200
l came back because she always told
me that you were a very loving man...

1406
03:20:37,700 --> 03:20:43,200
that you were just hard from the
outside but very soft from the inside.

1407
03:20:43,600 --> 03:20:48,200
l came to break that hardness.

1408
03:20:49,600 --> 03:20:54,600
Do you know, Mr. Shankar, l do not
have any photograph of Megha...

1409
03:20:56,600 --> 03:20:59,500
l never felt the need for it,

1410
03:20:59,500 --> 03:21:04,700
because l see Megha wherever
l see love.

1411
03:21:06,400 --> 03:21:11,900
l thought if l could make
just one love story

1412
03:21:12,600 --> 03:21:15,500
bloom in front of your eyes,
you too would see her...

1413
03:21:15,500 --> 03:21:21,700
and you would see how happy she is
and that will take your pain away.

1414
03:21:25,300 --> 03:21:29,200
l had come to share your
pain Mr. Shankar

1415
03:21:29,900 --> 03:21:34,600
l had come to show you love.

1416
03:21:34,600 --> 03:21:38,500
l came here because l
realised one thing...

1417
03:21:38,500 --> 03:21:42,500
that Megha was incomplete
without you...

1418
03:21:42,500 --> 03:21:47,800
but you failed to realise that she
was incomplete without me too...

1419
03:21:50,300 --> 03:21:54,300
we together made her complete.

1420
03:21:54,300 --> 03:22:00,400
l came to complete what we
could'nt do in her lifetime.

1421
03:22:02,200 --> 03:22:08,400
l came to complete her
l came to complete Megha.

1422
03:22:12,900 --> 03:22:16,800
You won every battle of life...

1423
03:22:17,700 --> 03:22:21,700
but you lost everything
that was worth living for.

1424
03:22:23,400 --> 03:22:29,100
You lost a daughterthen
and now you have lost a son.

1425
03:22:33,800 --> 03:22:41,400
l am sorry sir, but from where
l see you lost everything.

1426
03:22:43,900 --> 03:22:51,000
Because l see a stubborn man
standing with his backturned...

1427
03:22:52,500 --> 03:23:01,200
to the two people who
truly loved him.

1428
03:23:12,900 --> 03:23:17,000
l am sorry sir, l am sorry.

1429
03:25:17,200 --> 03:25:20,700
For25 years, l have been
very proud of the fact,

1430
03:25:20,700 --> 03:25:23,600
that l've run this
institution with...

1431
03:25:23,600 --> 03:25:28,000
tradition, honour, and discipline,

1432
03:25:28,900 --> 03:25:32,900
believing that l have made
my students....

1433
03:25:33,600 --> 03:25:40,800
stronger, fuller, and better men...

1434
03:25:42,800 --> 03:25:47,500
men who will always come out
as winners in the battle of life.

1435
03:25:48,700 --> 03:25:54,600
l have been very proud of the
fact that somewhere there is a...

1436
03:25:55,400 --> 03:26:00,600
Narayan Shankar in each
and every student of Gurukul.

1437
03:26:01,700 --> 03:26:07,200
But, today, as l stand before you
l am not feeling so proud.

1438
03:26:09,300 --> 03:26:13,500
Because, today, l do not
like the Narayan Shankar...

1439
03:26:13,700 --> 03:26:18,900
who is standing in front of you.

1440
03:26:19,300 --> 03:26:27,800
Because today Narayan Shankar is a
man who did not come out as a winner...

1441
03:26:29,900 --> 03:26:35,200
in the battle of life...

1442
03:26:35,700 --> 03:26:40,600
...he has lost.

1443
03:26:41,800 --> 03:26:45,800
He is a sad, stubborn,
and lonely man...

1444
03:26:46,800 --> 03:26:52,200
who just did not understand
the meaning of life.

1445
03:26:54,600 --> 03:26:59,400
And today, when he looks back, he
cannot help but feel that somewhere...

1446
03:27:00,100 --> 03:27:05,600
all his students, must be sad
and lonely, just like him...

1447
03:27:08,600 --> 03:27:16,500
because he knows, he never smiled
at them when they were scared...

1448
03:27:18,300 --> 03:27:23,900
he never patted their backs
when they did well...

1449
03:27:25,800 --> 03:27:31,000
he never held them in his arms,
when they were sad.

1450
03:27:33,600 --> 03:27:36,200
Because he always believed
that showing any kind of love

1451
03:27:36,200 --> 03:27:38,800
and affection leads to pain...

1452
03:27:38,800 --> 03:27:43,600
and pain leads to weakness.

1453
03:27:46,000 --> 03:27:52,300
And in this process he became so
hard, that he forgot how to love.

1454
03:27:57,200 --> 03:28:03,100
And today he wants to go back
to each of his students...

1455
03:28:05,300 --> 03:28:09,900
hold them in his arms
and apologise to them.

1456
03:28:10,400 --> 03:28:16,100
And tell them one simple thing,
that life is about giving and...

1457
03:28:16,600 --> 03:28:22,100
recieving love, and nothing else,
nothing else

1458
03:28:26,900 --> 03:28:32,900
But he knows he cannot do that
he cannot go back.

1459
03:28:36,100 --> 03:28:40,300
But there is something he can do.

1460
03:28:40,300 --> 03:28:44,400
Something that he has not
done for25 years...

1461
03:28:44,900 --> 03:28:47,900
something that he should have
done a long...

1462
03:28:47,900 --> 03:28:51,900
time back, and that is change.
He will have to change.

1463
03:28:56,000 --> 03:29:00,900
The old generation will have to change
their old traditions, so that..

1464
03:29:01,500 --> 03:29:06,700
a new generation can create
a new tradition.

1465
03:29:12,000 --> 03:29:17,300
Now its time for me to step down

1466
03:29:19,000 --> 03:29:23,300
and give you someone who has
shown me that...

1467
03:29:23,800 --> 03:29:29,000
...respect is not earned by fear,
but by love.

1468
03:29:36,000 --> 03:29:40,400
Mr. Aryan, please come up.

1469
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:28,300
l request you to please
take over...

1470
03:30:28,400 --> 03:30:32,400
and teach my students the
essence of love and life.

1471
03:30:42,200 --> 03:30:47,200
So that from now on
l can proudly say

1472
03:30:48,900 --> 03:30:55,400
that there is a Raj Aryan in each
and every student of Gurukul.

1473
03:30:58,700 --> 03:31:09,100
And probably then my
daughterwould forgive me.
