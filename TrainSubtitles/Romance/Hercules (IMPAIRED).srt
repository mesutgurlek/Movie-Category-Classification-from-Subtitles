<i>in the faraway land of ancient Greece,</i>

2
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:44,929
<i>there was a golden age of powerful
gods and extraordinary heroes.</i>

3
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:50,885
<i>And the greatest and strongest of all
these heroes was the mighty Hercules.</i>

4
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,472
<i>But what is the measure of a true hero?</i>

<i>- That is what our story is...</i>
- Will you listen to him?

6
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,565

some Greek tragedy.

We are the Muses, goddesses of
the arts and proclaimers of heroes.

some sweet music with him...

13

Our story actually begins long before
Hercules, many aeons ago.

<i>The planet Earth was down on its luck</i>

17
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:40,693
<i>And everywhere gigantic brutes
called Titans ran amok</i>

18
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,941
<i>It was a nasty place</i>

19
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,945
<i>There was a mess
wherever you stepped</i>

20
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:52,281
<i>Where chaos reigned and the
earthquakes and volcanoes never slept</i>

Say it, girlfriend!

22
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,074

25
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:05,418
<i>And on his own
stopped chaos in its tracks</i>

26
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,968
<i>And that's the gospel truth</i>

27

Meg.

01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:20,608
(SIGHS) There's some things
you just can't change.

(HADES YELLING)

1414
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:31,828
We were so close!

1415
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,412
So close.

1416
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:35,372
We tripped at the finish line. Why?

1417
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:39,427
Because our little nut, Meg,
has to go all noble.

1418

- Oh, look who's here.

1420
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,811
Wonderboy, you are too much.

1421
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:52,732
- Let her go.
- Get a grip.

1422
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:54,934
Come here, come here.
Let me show you around.

1423
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:59,398
Hmph. Well, well.
It's a small underworld after all. Huh?

1424
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,490
Meg! Ahhh!

1425
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,364
No, no, no. Mustn't touch.

1426
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,992
You see, Meg's
running with a new crowd these days.

1427
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,955
And not a very lively one, at that.

1428
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:14,037
You like making deals.
Take me in Meg's place.

1429
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:19,717
Well. The son of my hated rival
trapped forever in a river of death.

1430
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,215
- Going once.
- Is there a downside to this?

1431
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:25,389
- Going twice!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1432
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:28,934
You get her out. She goes, you stay.

1433
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,480
You know what slipped my mind?

1434
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,432
You'll be dead
before you can get to her.

1435
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,109
That's not a problem, is it?

1436
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,461
Oh!

1437
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,927
What's the matter with these scissors?

The thread won't cut.

This is... This is impossible!

You can't do this to me. You can't...

(MUFFLED) Fine. Okay. Listen.

Okay. Well, I deserved that.
Herc, Herc, Herc. Can we talk?

01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,127
Your dad, he's a fun guy, right?

1447
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,425
So maybe you could
put in a word with him,

1448
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,798
and he'd kinda blow this
whole thing off, you know?

1449
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:48,472
Meg, Meg, talk to him.

Don't touch me!

Get your slimy souls off me!

He's not gonna be happy
when he gets outta there.

1454
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,854
You mean, if he gets outta there.

1455
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:04,904
- If. If is good.
- HADES: Taxi!

1456
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,233
I don't feel so good. I feel a little...

Fine work, my boy! You've done it!

You're a true hero.

1473
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:42,377
You were willing to give your life
to rescue this young woman.

1474
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:46,207
For a true hero isn't measured
by the size of his strength,

1475
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:49,260
but by the strength of his heart.

1476

Now, at last, my son,

1477
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,642
you can come home.

But...

A life without Meg,
even an immortal life,
