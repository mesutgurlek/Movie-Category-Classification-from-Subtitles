773
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:36,496
...America see my hotel as a star
as you did with Smith Jerrod.

774
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,934
And suddenly, it's all about the couch.

775
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,579
Two years ago, we never even
uttered the word "couch."

776
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:46,580
And now, our entire universe
revolves around it.

777

Count your blessings.

778
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:51,110
Remember when you couldn't even
get him to sleep over?

779
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:52,412
Yeah, I know. I know.

780
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:56,025
We're out tonight. He could at least slap
on a smile and have a good time.

781
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:59,856
Already had a nervous breakdown.
No, believe me...

782
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,390
He seems to be having a good time now.

783

CARRION:
People think that Spaniards don't work...

784
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:08,594
...that we just take siestas
and drink Rioja and go to the beach.

785
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:12,264
There was a jumbo shrimp free-for-all
at the raw bar.

- I'm gonna be... I'll be right back.
- Okay.

787
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:19,942
Every night before bed,
I am on my knees praying:

788
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,312
"Please, God, let it stay up."

789
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:29,492
- Please let what stay up?
- Hi. The stock market.

790

00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,557
- Carrion.
- Very good.

792
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:36,789
She is the Senior Vice President
of the Bank of Madrid.

00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,271
Oh, Carrie Preston. Nice to meet you.
Your husband is very charming.

796
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:45,931
Isn't he?

797
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:50,576
So you were right about the catered food
and the shoving.

798
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,182
So I'm ready to go whenever you are.

799
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,977
Oh.

800
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:58,047
- Well, nice to meet you both.
- Nice to meet you.

801
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,746
I'll try to keep it up for you.

- He is.

803
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:03,985

00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,254
Bye. Good night.

What?

813
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:39,329
That was supposed to be
for black-and-white movies...

814
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,192
...and that
is not a black-and-white movie.

I'm not upset about the flirt.

I like the flirt. In fact, you could dial up

I'm sorry. Are we having a discussion
or watching television?

What is it with you and this television?

822
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,152
I don't wanna be one of those couples...

823

...lying in bed,
watching television and not talking.

824
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:20,503
That is not the relationship
I signed up for.

825
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,566
It's a television,
not the end of the world.

Well, maybe to you it's not.

830
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,217
Well, what do you want from me?

831
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,985
I put on the shirt, I went to the thing...

...and now you're hammering me
about lying in bed and watching a little TV?

I mean, what is the problem?

I don't know, about 6.

No, I just feel like I really need
to lock myself in a room...

You didn't think I was going
without my gals.

890
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,296
- What?
- I told the sheikh I'd go on one condition:

891
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,931
I'd get to bring my three best girlfriends.

892
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,899
- Get out of town.
- My point exactly.

893
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:50,506
And we are being flown
on the sheikh's own airline.

894
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:52,471
- He has his own airline?
- Mm-hm.

00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:56,476
- Oh, that is one chic sheikh.
SAMANTHA: Super, super, super first class.

SAMANTHA: All expenses paid for...

00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,887
...everything for all of us.
All we have to do is pick the week.

Yeah. All clear.

I have two children.

908
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,271
Yes, yes, but you have a husband.

909
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:35,009
And a full-time nanny. You said so yourself.
The kids love the nanny, right?

910
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,917
- Yes, but...
SAMANTHA: But what? What's the problem?

911
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,250
I mean, we haven't been
anywhere together...

914
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:50,490
Two years of bad business
and this bullshit economy, and I'm done.

915
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,067
We need to go somewhere rich.
