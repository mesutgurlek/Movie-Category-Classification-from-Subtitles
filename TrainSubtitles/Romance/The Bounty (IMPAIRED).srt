1
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:38,123
(Sound of drums)

2
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:11,451
This way.

3
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:53,957
Court is assembled

4
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:57,920
by the Right Honorable Lords,
Commissioners of the Admiralty

5
00:04:58,003 --> 00:05:03,592
and I quote: To enquire into the cause
and circumstances of the seizure

6
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:07,264
of His Majesty's armed vessel,
The Bounty,

7
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:10,142
commanded by
Lieutenant William Bligh

8
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:13,937
and to try the said
Lieutenant William Bligh

9
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,024
for his conduct
on that occasion.

10
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,987
Surrender your sword
and be seated.

11
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:47,308
Lieutenant Bligh.

12
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:51,687
Perhaps it would be useful if you
told the court in your own words

13
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:55,024
the events
of April 28th last year.

14
00:05:55,441 --> 00:06:01,991
Yes sir. If it please my Lords,
I will first read a list of the mutineers

15
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:03,534
who seized my ship.

16
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:08,873
The crew is not on trial here,
Mr Bligh. You, sir, are on trial.

17
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:13,169
The question at issue is
how you came to lose your ship.

18
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:18,384
To understand that, Captain Greetham,
it is essential to know

19
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,386
who were the mutineers
aboard that ship.

20
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:24,307
Alleged mutineers.
Continue Mr Bligh.

21
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:28,228
Fletcher Christian,
Masters Mate.

22
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:31,106
Wasn't this Christian
a friend of yours?

23
00:06:32,107 --> 00:06:33,192
He was, sir.

24
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:36,278
(Voices in crowd)
Fifty guineas says he's dead.

25
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:39,991
Sixty says he's alive.
I'll wager he's still alive.

26
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:41,576
(Voices in crowd)
How much?

27
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:43,244
We'll dine within the hour.

28
00:06:43,411 --> 00:06:45,664
- How much?
- Sixty guineas.

29
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,415
Taken.

30
00:06:52,504 --> 00:06:53,798
I'll be back to collect it.

31
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:58,344
Graham!

32
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:01,431
Fletcher!
What are you all doing?

33
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:03,350
One of our members collapsed.

34
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:05,393
We're betting
on whether or not he's dead.

35
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,396
What brings you
to this den of iniquity?

36
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,440
Is there somewhere we can talk?

37
00:07:20,077 --> 00:07:21,287
It's a breadfruit.

38
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:22,538
Breadfruit.

39
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:28,628
The Admiralty has instructed me to take
breadfruit plants from Tahiti to Jamaica.

40
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:30,714
Tahiti?

41
00:07:31,214 --> 00:07:33,759
Fletcher, I want you
to sail with me again.

42
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:35,385
In what capacity?

43
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:39,849
The Admiralty's already assigned a
Mr John Fryer as Master of the ship.

44
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:43,144
He's a good man I think.
But I want you to be Master's Mate.

45
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:45,689
- If you agree, that is.
- Agreed.

46
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:48,942
Good, splendid! Good.

47
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:50,694
Why take breadfruit to Jamaica?

48
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,239
Cheap fodder for the slaves
on the plantations there.

49
00:07:54,364 --> 00:07:56,367
Bananas are very expensive
there these days.

50
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:58,870
It lacks glory, William.

51
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,998
Well I don't have your connections,
you see Fletcher.

52
00:08:02,332 --> 00:08:04,543
I want to make a name for myself,
before I'm too old.

53
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:07,671
And this green grocery trip
will make your name?

54
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:14,762
Now look, we'll go around
Cape Horn to Tahiti.

55
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:18,349
We'll pick up the breadfruit
then continue on

56
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:22,021
through the Endeavour Straits around
the Cape of Good Hope to Jamaica.

57
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:25,191
And then back to England.
We'll circumnavigate the globe.

58
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:28,153
Yes, but why risk
going round the Horn?

59
00:08:28,236 --> 00:08:31,239
Because it is
the quicker route, Mr Fryer.

60
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,326
Quicker if we strike the one week
in a hundred

61
00:08:34,451 --> 00:08:36,077
when there isn't a storm raging.

62
00:08:36,202 --> 00:08:41,375
Oh. So you would have us go the long
way? Around Africa and Australia.

63
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:44,045
There and back.
Avoid the Horn altogether.

64
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:47,966
(Sound of clock chiming)

65
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:50,886
What conditions
do the plants need?

66
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:55,265
Warmth, light and water.
I shall be giving up my cabin to them.

67
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,060
We shall be like little pigs
in a stye. Shan't we?

68
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:02,065
No sir, we shall not.
I run a healthy ship, Mr Fryer.

69
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:04,525
I only say
the Bounty's too small.

70
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:07,195
We should have a frigate,
not a chamber pot.

71
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:10,282
Yes, and I should
have promotion to Captain.

72
00:09:11,242 --> 00:09:15,704
But the Navy Board would
not heed either request. See?

73
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,919
Quickly now, children.

74
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:22,754
Ah, my little ones.

75
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:24,464
They've come to say goodnight.

76
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:29,262
Oh, goodnight,
goodnight. Off you go...

77
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:34,600
Aren't you going to say goodnight to Mr
Christian, Mr Fryer? Don't I get a kiss?

78
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:40,065
(Children giggling)

79
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:41,317
Goodnight, young ladies.

80
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:42,776
Goodnight, goodnight.

81
00:09:46,614 --> 00:09:49,909
William a toast.
To circumnavigation.

82
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,578
To circumnavigation.

83
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:53,037
Circumnavigation.

84
00:09:53,497 --> 00:09:55,457
And your safe and speedy return.

85
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:56,459
(Bligh) Yes.

86
00:09:58,043 --> 00:10:00,379
(Crowd voices on quayside)

87
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:24,156
(Bligh voice over)
We set sail two days before Christmas,

88
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:26,951
23rd December 1787.

89
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,411
Stand by to set the mainsail.

90
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:46,972
What are you staring at me for? Aloft!
Loose that mizzen topsail, lively.

91
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:51,394
Remove some of these gussets!

92
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,521
Back down in the rigging!

93
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:55,815
Stand by, you crew gunners!

94
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,986
Away, you crew gunners.

95
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:12,083
Southwest by south.
That's your course.

96
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,544
Southwest by south. Aye aye sir.

97
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,629
(Cook)
Right men! Food up! Come on.

98
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,434
(Crew talking) What's the name
of the cook? Lamb?! Hey, Lamb!

99
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,980
I hope
you got some lamb in that stew.

100
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:14,694
Hey, is it true
what they say about Tahiti?

101
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:16,321
You mean the women.

102
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:19,282
Do they really go around
with no clothes on?

103
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:23,329
All they wear is tattoos.
In wonderful places.

104
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:24,705
True?

105
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:27,417
Cross my heart. Paradise.

106
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:30,628
Hey!
You're in my place, Quintel.

107
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:36,135
Move yourself.

108
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:41,850
Don't look at him.
There'll be trouble.

109
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,526
I said you're in my seat.

110
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,611
- Piss off.
- Bugger off.

111
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:56,324
- What did you say?
- Shut it, Churchill.

112
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:57,533
You keep out of this.

113
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:02,038
(Crew member)
Look out, he's got a knife.

114
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,041
Keep it quiet, Churchill.

115
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,668
(Crew member)
Keep it down, lads.

116
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:10,589
(Crew Member)
Churchill!

117
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:15,011
(Dog barking)

118
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:27,942
The King.

119
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:29,861
The King. God bless him.

120
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:34,241
To the ship. May she swim well.

121
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:35,450
The ship.

122
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,629
(Sounds of ship's timbers creaking)

123
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:54,513
The men are very quiet.

124
00:13:55,222 --> 00:13:58,851
(Sounds of heavy thuds
and timbers creaking)

125
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:03,565
(Sound of crew member singing)

126
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:07,569
(Bligh humming)

127
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:11,407
Charming tune.

128
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:16,871
And a fine musician.
We're lucky to have him.

129
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:22,753
Yes. He is not there
by chance, Mr Nelson.

130
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:25,464
Having him there
is good for morale.

131
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,219
Dr. Huggen. Another glass?

132
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:31,262
No thank you, sir.

133
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:34,558
You're uncommonly
abstemious tonight.

134
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:40,147
Well, more men have died
at sea from drink,

135
00:14:40,272 --> 00:14:43,234
disease and dirt than
ever died by drowning.

136
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:45,819
Depend upon it, gentlemen.

137
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:48,531
I'm determined the Bounty
shall not lose a single man.

138
00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:50,617
By heavens! I'll drink to that.

139
00:15:04,716 --> 00:15:08,178
Then came
to one soft push.

140
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:13,893
Then came
the sweetest flower to find.

141
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,695
- Striking a superior officer.
- No I didn't.

142
00:15:23,862 --> 00:15:25,990
- It's a hanging offence, sir.
- Sorry sir.

143
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:30,536
Can't be helped. We shall all get
to know each other pretty closely.

144
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:32,330
I wonder what we shall find out.

145
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:35,750
It depends how inquisitive
we are, Mr Young.

146
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:43,341
(Dog barking.
Heavy thuds, noise of fighting)

147
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:51,809
It doesn't sound quite right to me.

148
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,813
Do you think someone
had better go and look?

149
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:09,871
(Singing) There is a ship and
it sailed to sea. It's loaded deep. -

150
00:16:14,377 --> 00:16:16,503
Good evening, Mr Heywood.

151
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,130
Good evening, Adams.

152
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:19,840
Evening, Mr Adams, sir.

153
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:21,509
Everything alright here?

154
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:24,012
Couldn't be better, sir.

155
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:26,682
(Sound of coughing)

156
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:36,276
My place.

157
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:37,818
Stupid buggers.

158
00:16:38,904 --> 00:16:40,822
You watch
your mouth too, old man.

159
00:16:40,947 --> 00:16:44,743
Don't old man me, Churchill.
You haven't got a lucky face.

160
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,646
Seasick, Mr Heywood, sir?

161
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:12,399
Just leaving England.

162
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,776
Oh. Home sick.

163
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:20,407
- Feels you'll never see it again.
- Don't say that, sir. It's bad luck.

164
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:26,706
Sorry. Never been to sea before.
Two months ago I was still at school.

165
00:17:27,164 --> 00:17:28,875
Never been to school meself.

166
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:29,793
Oh.

167
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,295
Can't even read.

168
00:17:31,795 --> 00:17:33,380
I can't steer a ship.

169
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:37,760
Any fool can steer a ship, sir.
It's just knowing where to take it.

170
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,551
(Bligh's voice over)
23rd December 1787.

171
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:17,804
The end of our first day at sea.

172
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,487
Tot of rum, sir?

173
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,154
No, thank you, no.

174
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,407
Come on, sir. We don't cross
the Equator every day.

175
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:39,703
No. Thank you. No. Make sure
Mr Heywood has some, though.

176
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:46,460
OK. That'll do.
Haul him in. Away.

177
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:49,339
Coming up for sup,
Mr Heywood. Sir

178
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:12,406
Here you go sir. Have some of that.
Have some of that, sir.

179
00:19:12,573 --> 00:19:16,369
Revive the spirit as they say.
Have a sup of that. Go on.

180
00:19:19,956 --> 00:19:22,209
Get some
of this muck down you.

181
00:19:26,214 --> 00:19:27,298
Well done, sir.

182
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:29,216
Thank you, Quintel.

183
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:38,936
Lieutenant Bligh,
I have your log here before me.

184
00:19:39,186 --> 00:19:43,232
In it, there is the frequent entry
of a single word: dancing.

185
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,985
Can you explain that?

186
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:47,863
I can, sir.

187
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:52,701
A crew on a long voyage may easily
fall into melancholy and violence.

188
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:56,121
I believe this can be relieved
by regular exercise.

189
00:19:56,246 --> 00:20:00,168
So for 20 minutes each day, I had the
crew mustered and I had them dance.

190
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:02,754
- Dance?
- Yes. They danced.

191
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:05,799
An activity
they participated in wholeheartedly?

192
00:20:06,383 --> 00:20:07,509
I think so. Yes.

193
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:09,720
And yet Mr Bligh,
in your own log,

194
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:13,599
you admit that this rather
unorthodox form of exercise

195
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:15,560
led to grave discontent.

196
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:19,397
On one occasion only,
sir. And not grave.

197
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:43,799
Charlie. If you only had a frock on,
I'd ask you for a dance.

198
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,931
Get your knees up, Quintel.

199
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:51,642
I'm doing my best, sir.

200
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:52,893
Don't answer back.

201
00:20:56,313 --> 00:20:58,857
We're bloody sailors,
not bloody dancers.

202
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,487
Mr Christian. Mr Young.
Put a gag on Quintel.

203
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,406
It wasn't bloody me.

204
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:07,534
Don't make it worse, Quintel.

205
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,996
It wasn't him, sir. It was me.

206
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,706
Come along, Mr Christian.

207
00:21:12,832 --> 00:21:14,625
You've got the wrong man, sir.

208
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,711
Churchill said it was he
who made the remark.

209
00:21:24,052 --> 00:21:24,969
Gag them both.

210
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:26,346
Ah, Jesus Christ.

211
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,687
- Do as he says, Mr Christian.
- Sir!

212
00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:52,416
Fletcher.

213
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,380
William, don't you think those men
have been gagged there long enough?

214
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:58,841
They were both guilty
of an act of insubordination.

215
00:21:58,966 --> 00:22:02,094
I could have passed it off with
a laugh and have done less harm.

216
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:05,223
The Royal Navy is not
a humorous institution, sir.

217
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,851
And insubordination
is no laughing matter.

218
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,314
However, you may cut them loose,
Mr Christian.

219
00:22:13,356 --> 00:22:16,109
But mind they appreciate
the gravity of their offence.

220
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,320
Thank you, sir.

221
00:22:25,286 --> 00:22:26,288
Captain's orders.

222
00:22:26,455 --> 00:22:29,249
Ah, yes. Sure.

223
00:22:31,293 --> 00:22:33,754
You can close your mouth.
Or I'll put it back in.

224
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,832
I hadn't expected this from the Horn. Do
you think the weather will stay with us?

225
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:08,042
Perhaps.

226
00:23:14,632 --> 00:23:16,593
It doesn't look much. Does it?

227
00:23:17,552 --> 00:23:21,557
No, it doesn't, sir. But I've seen
the Horn when the waves

228
00:23:21,682 --> 00:23:25,645
were as high as three houses
one on top of the other.

229
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:30,192
I once saw six men washed
overboard on one wave.

230
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:34,404
Someone on this ship
is very lucky.

231
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:38,867
Mr Fryer! Close reef!

232
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:41,037
Close reef, sir?

233
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,873
Don't argue with me. Close reef.

234
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:50,172
Close reef, Mr Cole.

235
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,139
Stand by to close reef! All hands
on deck! Move yourselves!

236
00:23:59,724 --> 00:24:04,897
Hurry along and take those sails in!
Get further aloft!

237
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,067
Hurry up, move yourselves!
Get those sails in!

238
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:12,404
Doesn't seem to like
fair weather, does he?

239
00:24:15,784 --> 00:24:19,371
(Cole) Haul on that sheet!
Get those sails in!

240
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:09,760
Mr Fryer. I seem to have
made a misjudgement.

241
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:12,304
You don't make many, sir.

242
00:25:13,723 --> 00:25:14,766
Make sail.

243
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:18,269
Make sail, Mr Cole.

244
00:25:18,353 --> 00:25:25,945
Aye, Aye, sir. Prepare to make sail!
Let go sheets and tack!

245
00:25:42,838 --> 00:25:44,006
Square away!

246
00:25:55,268 --> 00:25:56,061
Get aloft!

247
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:10,702
(Sounds of crew screaming)

248
00:26:27,263 --> 00:26:29,222
Someone!

249
00:26:33,061 --> 00:26:34,937
Mr Christian!

250
00:26:52,207 --> 00:26:54,543
Pull! Pull!

251
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:14,106
Robert, mind those bloody pots! Robert,
he's on fire! Someone douse him.

252
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:23,032
We'll all be killed!

253
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:25,952
All hands on deck!

254
00:27:29,456 --> 00:27:30,498
Close the hatches!

255
00:27:34,712 --> 00:27:38,800
Take the wheel, man.
Steering to port side.

256
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:55,360
(Continuing shouts
of crew members)

257
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:46,124
Man those pumps!

258
00:28:47,001 --> 00:28:50,087
Jamie,
hold that board. Someone!

259
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:54,759
Don't let go on the pumps!

260
00:28:55,593 --> 00:28:57,387
Somebody get a bloody hammer.

261
00:28:59,723 --> 00:29:01,182
Sir! Sir!

262
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:03,685
Have the carpenter lash
those things down, now!

263
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:05,061
- We must turn back!
- What?

264
00:29:05,146 --> 00:29:06,605
In my opinion,
we should put about.

265
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,151
In my opinion we should not, sir.
We keep on our course.

266
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:14,323
(Fryer) You'll never make it
round the Horn. We must turn back.

267
00:29:14,448 --> 00:29:16,783
Mr Cole, Mr Cole!

268
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,577
I want my opinion in the log, sir.

269
00:29:18,744 --> 00:29:21,830
Mr Cole, have that lashed down.
And all the men on deck, now!

270
00:29:21,956 --> 00:29:23,833
I want my opinion in the log!

271
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,418
Very well, Mr Fryer. If that's what
you wish, you shall have it.

272
00:29:26,544 --> 00:29:27,378
The ship can't stand it

273
00:29:27,545 --> 00:29:29,297
The ship can stand it
very well, Mr Fryer!

274
00:29:29,422 --> 00:29:31,049
And how long do you think
the men can stand it?

275
00:29:31,174 --> 00:29:33,093
As long as the officers
can stand it, Mr Fryer!

276
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,470
Get these things
tied down now.

277
00:29:44,272 --> 00:29:46,232
Valentine! Come with me, boy!

278
00:29:52,614 --> 00:29:56,744
Mr Bligh. How long did you
attempt to round the Horn?

279
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,162
31 days.

280
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,458
And how far
did you travel in that time?

281
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:04,586
85 miles, sir.

282
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:08,632
85 miles
in 31 days, Mr Bligh.

283
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,428
You endangered your ship
and your crew for 31 days

284
00:30:12,595 --> 00:30:16,224
in order to satisfy your ambition
to circumnavigate the globe.

285
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:31,116
(Bligh's voice over)
My dearest Betsy,

286
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:36,246
Only to you in this bitter moment
can I reveal my heart.

287
00:30:36,622 --> 00:30:40,376
I have failed completely
in my attempt to round Cape Horn

288
00:30:40,501 --> 00:30:42,086
and circumnavigate the globe.

289
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:49,344
My doubts about Mr Fryer's
commitment to our endeavour

290
00:30:49,553 --> 00:30:51,137
have been confirmed.

291
00:30:54,474 --> 00:30:55,976
(Knock on door)
Enter.

292
00:31:00,022 --> 00:31:02,984
- The men are assembled, sir.
- Come in. Come in.

293
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:15,539
I'm very sorry, William.

294
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:18,668
Oh. It can't be helped.
Come along.

295
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,010
(Voice off camera)
Lads!

296
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:47,742
We will go about and run downwind
for Africa and the Indian Ocean.

297
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:50,370
- Mr Lamb!
- Here Sir.

298
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:55,125
As soon as we have put about it will be
safe to light your galley fires again.

299
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,544
Tonight I want as much hot mush
as every man can eat.

300
00:31:57,628 --> 00:32:00,047
(Cole) Let's hear it
for the Captain, lads! Hip-hip!

301
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:02,050
(Crew members)
Hooray! Hooray!

302
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:07,388
However. However. We're still
faced with a long hard voyage.

303
00:32:08,682 --> 00:32:11,685
I mean to make good use
of every hour of sailing time.

304
00:32:11,852 --> 00:32:16,273
And to assist me in this, I'm replacing
Mr Fryer with Mr Christian

305
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:18,776
who will now act
as executive second in command

306
00:32:18,943 --> 00:32:20,612
with the rank of
Acting Second Lieutenant.

307
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:23,657
Mr Fryer, come back here.
Mr Fryer, sir! Come back here!

308
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,917
You'll dismiss when I have done
with you, sir. Do you hear me?

309
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,127
- This is an outrage!
- Mr Fryer.

310
00:32:35,294 --> 00:32:36,212
In all my years at sea...

311
00:32:36,337 --> 00:32:37,922
Your years at sea?
Good Lord, man.

312
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:38,924
If I had known your nature,

313
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:41,760
I would not have accepted you
as boson of a river barge.

314
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:42,928
Must I suffer this before...

315
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,014
You'll suffer my correction,
whenever you're at fault, sir!

316
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:45,764
What fault?

317
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:48,434
Damn your eyes, man!
You turned your back on me!

318
00:32:48,893 --> 00:32:50,436
- Oh, for that I apologize.
- Very well.

319
00:32:50,645 --> 00:32:52,438
- But I protest.
- You protest, do you?

320
00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:53,815
I am Master of The Bounty.

321
00:32:53,982 --> 00:32:58,612
And I am Commander, by law!
I am the first. Do you understand?

322
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:00,239
God damn your hide.

323
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:05,661
And now you may dismiss, sir!

324
00:33:25,934 --> 00:33:27,894
- Mr Cole.
- Sir.

325
00:33:28,728 --> 00:33:30,856
All hands on deck. If you please.

326
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:43,328
Surely, Mr Bligh. It was unwise
to replace a professional sailor

327
00:33:43,495 --> 00:33:46,915
like Mr Fryer
with a relative novice?

328
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:50,127
Fletcher Christian could hardly
be called a novice, sir.

329
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,463
The fact that he was
a good friend of yours,

330
00:33:52,588 --> 00:33:55,425
was not of undue
influence upon you?

331
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,970
Let me know the intent
of your question, Mr Greetham.

332
00:33:58,095 --> 00:34:01,890
We're trying to establish, Mr Bligh,
how you came to lose your ship.

333
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:03,809
I did not lose my ship, sir!

334
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:08,105
It was taken from me by a gang of
mutineers led by Fletcher Christian.

335
00:34:08,189 --> 00:34:09,523
The man you promoted.

336
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:13,570
Yes. I promoted him because
John Fryer was grossly inefficient.

337
00:34:13,737 --> 00:34:17,824
And he was also a coward. Fletcher
Christian at least had courage.

338
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:21,828
More, perhaps, than you ultimately
found to be acceptable. Eh, Mr Bligh?

339
00:34:27,752 --> 00:34:30,004
(Bligh's voice over)
Friday, October 10th.

340
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:33,800
At half-past twelve today,
James Valentine departed this life

341
00:34:33,925 --> 00:34:38,264
as a result of illness and fatigue
sustained at Cape Horn.

342
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:41,559
This after all my care of the men

343
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:44,896
is surely a result
of our drunken surgeon's neglect.

344
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:49,610
Oh, God. By whose mercy
the souls of all men rest.

345
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:52,780
Bless these waters
and absolve from sin

346
00:34:52,905 --> 00:34:55,491
he whose body
we now confine to them.

347
00:34:55,658 --> 00:35:01,372
Eternal rest grant unto him.
And may he rest in peace. Amen.

348
00:35:01,622 --> 00:35:02,708
(Crew)
Amen.

349
00:35:06,045 --> 00:35:07,421
Commit the body to the deep.

350
00:35:13,302 --> 00:35:15,805
(Bligh's voice over)
At four o'clock, we buried Valentine

351
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,141
with all the decency in our power.

352
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:27,652
Twenty-five degrees.
Thirty-six minutes.

353
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:09,031
Land Ho! Land Ho!

354
00:36:10,115 --> 00:36:11,033
Where away?

355
00:36:12,243 --> 00:36:13,369
Dead ahead, sir.

356
00:37:15,312 --> 00:37:17,607
(Cries of welcome from natives)

357
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:44,511
Stand by to fire the salute!

358
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,976
Ready to fire the salute. Fire!

359
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,228
(Sound of canon fire)

360
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,587
Stand by for a second salute!

361
00:38:24,097 --> 00:38:25,849
Fire second salute!

362
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,271
(Excited voices
of natives and crew)

363
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:04,892
Hey. I'll have her.

364
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:18,240
Thank you.

365
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:29,794
(Sounds of drum beats and chanting)

366
00:40:09,923 --> 00:40:10,673
Quintel!

367
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:11,716
Sorry sir.

368
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:14,010
Have you ever seen
a woman before?

369
00:40:14,886 --> 00:40:17,389
Keep your mind
and your eyes on your work, man.

370
00:40:17,514 --> 00:40:19,058
Come on, get in line there.

371
00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:38,996
Oars!

372
00:40:40,915 --> 00:40:42,333
Prepare to toss oars.

373
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:43,752
Toss oars.

374
00:40:47,297 --> 00:40:48,756
Toss your oars.

375
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,656
Thank you.

376
00:42:08,178 --> 00:42:10,347
Hail, Capitan Bligh.

377
00:42:10,681 --> 00:42:12,725
Hail, King Tynah.

378
00:42:13,183 --> 00:42:14,686
(Chief replies in Tahitian)

379
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:15,812
Thank you, your Majesty.

380
00:42:26,114 --> 00:42:29,661
I bring you greetings from His Majesty,
King George of England.

381
00:42:30,495 --> 00:42:32,706
How is the great Captain Cook?

382
00:42:32,998 --> 00:42:37,544
Captain Cook! He's well
and he also sends his greetings.

383
00:42:37,752 --> 00:42:40,172
- He lives?
- Yes.

384
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:43,676
- He is my friend.
- I know.

385
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,431
Now you see.

386
00:42:49,932 --> 00:42:50,766
Ah!

387
00:42:50,976 --> 00:42:52,435
He gave me his picture.

388
00:42:52,644 --> 00:42:53,561
Yes.

389
00:42:53,686 --> 00:42:57,483
Some people say he was killed
by the people of Hawaii.

390
00:42:58,025 --> 00:43:01,987
No, er... Captain Cook
is very much alive.

391
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:06,785
And, er, he's in good health,
King Tynah. He's very much alive.

392
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,453
(Responds in Tahitian)

393
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,914
As I said,
he sends his greetings to you.

394
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,209
And, er, he always talks of you
as his very close friend.

395
00:43:14,376 --> 00:43:18,756
You told that
to this man... Tynah?

396
00:43:19,132 --> 00:43:20,258
King Tynah, sir.

397
00:43:20,675 --> 00:43:22,177
A savage King.

398
00:43:23,678 --> 00:43:26,473
A King, my lord.
Descended from many Kings.

399
00:43:26,598 --> 00:43:29,560
As our King George
is descended from many Kings.

400
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,229
Yes, in a way, sir.

401
00:43:31,395 --> 00:43:34,274
Then why did you lie to him?
Why did you not tell him

402
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:37,360
Captain Cook was murdered
in Hawaii 10 years before?

403
00:43:37,485 --> 00:43:40,489
Because they believe
that Captain Cook is immortal.

404
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:42,490
Literally?

405
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:47,413
They seem to regard
his likeness as a sacred image.

406
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:48,622
Interesting.

407
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:54,170
They also believe that every British
officer is more or less related to him.

408
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:58,008
So you were
more or less immortal too.

409
00:43:59,635 --> 00:44:05,391
It would appear so, sir. And-um -
I also needed their assistance.

410
00:44:05,683 --> 00:44:07,852
Captain Cook was our guarantor.

411
00:44:10,605 --> 00:44:12,649
How long you stay in Tahiti?

412
00:44:13,024 --> 00:44:15,110
About two months.
Round about the islands.

413
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:20,074
Stay here. Do not go to the other
islands. No welcome there for you.

414
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,452
Everything you need is here.

415
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,162
I'm much obliged to you.

416
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:28,416
His Majesty King George
has sent you many gifts,

417
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:31,671
King Tynah. Perhaps
I could carry back in return.

418
00:44:31,879 --> 00:44:34,799
Gifts from yourself
to His Majesty King George.

419
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:42,974
Anything for a King. Pigs.
Bananas. Coconuts. Breadfruit.

420
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:47,896
Breadfruit. Breadfruit's
a very good idea. Yes, breadfruit.

421
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:52,276
I think His Majesty likes breadfruit.
Isn't that true Mr Nelson?

422
00:44:52,443 --> 00:44:57,282
Indeed it is, sir.
His Majesty is a very keen gardener.

423
00:44:58,116 --> 00:45:00,494
He would appreciate
breadfruit greatly.

424
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:03,914
If you were to send him
little breadfruit plants.

425
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:06,083
He could grow them
in his own garden.

426
00:45:08,253 --> 00:45:10,504
(Sound of laughter)

427
00:45:16,636 --> 00:45:19,389
We shall grow him
many little plants.

428
00:45:19,723 --> 00:45:20,933
Thank you.

429
00:45:21,017 --> 00:45:23,436
- Mr Christian.
- Sir.

430
00:45:23,728 --> 00:45:29,233
Mr Cole. Would you distribute the gifts
to King Tynah and his good people.

431
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,405
These are gifts from His Majesty King
George of England to yourselves.

432
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:38,285
(Christian)
Sir.

433
00:46:04,856 --> 00:46:06,817
(Crew member)
Take it away, Mr Cole.

434
00:46:06,901 --> 00:46:07,901
Oh, dear God.

435
00:46:10,988 --> 00:46:13,491
- I hoped to avoid this.
- Avoid what, sir?

436
00:46:13,658 --> 00:46:16,161
Dammit all man,
I'm expected to sleep with her.

437
00:46:16,453 --> 00:46:21,375
She's one of King Tynah's wives. A gift
from one chief to another as it were.

438
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,211
Now look,
five minutes after I go below,

439
00:46:24,379 --> 00:46:26,755
you must call me up on some
important business. Alright?

440
00:46:26,922 --> 00:46:27,841
Yes sir. What business?

441
00:46:27,966 --> 00:46:29,509
Business, dammit.
Any bloody business.

442
00:46:30,217 --> 00:46:31,344
Welcome aboard, Ma'am.

443
00:46:35,432 --> 00:46:37,685
Yes. Get on with your work.

444
00:46:43,524 --> 00:46:45,986
She should soften
the old man up a bit.

445
00:47:03,546 --> 00:47:04,548
Hot.

446
00:47:39,378 --> 00:47:40,421
(Knock on door)

447
00:47:40,546 --> 00:47:41,297
Enter.

448
00:47:43,591 --> 00:47:45,134
Excuse me, sir. I...

449
00:47:45,301 --> 00:47:46,720
- Mr Christian.
- Sir.

450
00:47:46,845 --> 00:47:48,513
What demands
my immediate attention?

451
00:47:48,638 --> 00:47:50,265
It could wait until tomorrow.

452
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:51,349
What is it? Damn you.

453
00:47:51,474 --> 00:47:52,976
The ship is sinking, sir.

454
00:47:53,143 --> 00:47:53,852
Good.

455
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:03,321
Ma'am.

456
00:48:09,911 --> 00:48:14,417
(Greetham) Was Fletcher Christian
at this time still your friend and ally?

457
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,043
At that time, yes.

458
00:48:16,168 --> 00:48:19,422
There was no indication
of any resentment towards you?

459
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,466
No. None.

460
00:48:23,844 --> 00:48:27,473
Mr Bligh. When you planted
out your breadfruit,

461
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:31,018
did not the savages carry out
some sort of ceremony?

462
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:32,687
An indecent ceremony?

463
00:48:33,021 --> 00:48:35,357
Is this relevant, Captain Greetham?

464
00:48:35,732 --> 00:48:39,319
My Lord, if the crew
were allowed to witness it, yes.

465
00:48:39,486 --> 00:48:41,530
Were the crew present, Mr Bligh?

466
00:48:43,365 --> 00:48:44,157
Yes.

467
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:46,160
And was it indecent?

468
00:48:48,246 --> 00:48:49,830
It is their deep belief

469
00:48:49,997 --> 00:48:54,127
that the earth is rendered fruitful
by the coupling of their Gods.

470
00:48:54,294 --> 00:48:58,006
And that the Gods can be roused
by the coupling of men and women.

471
00:49:07,183 --> 00:49:09,811
(Sounds of drums
and native chanting)

472
00:52:26,195 --> 00:52:28,364
So it did begin at the ceremony?

473
00:52:28,447 --> 00:52:30,408
No sir. Not at the ceremony.

474
00:52:30,617 --> 00:52:33,787
No, it was Fletcher Christian
and the native girl.

475
00:52:34,621 --> 00:52:37,666
You misunderstood the depth
of the emotion between them?

476
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:39,877
Yes. I realise that now.

477
00:52:40,044 --> 00:52:43,297
I had assumed that it was
simply youthful passion.

478
00:52:43,756 --> 00:52:47,802
It takes more than an infatuated
youth to make a mutiny.

479
00:52:48,512 --> 00:52:50,555
It takes a discontented crew.

480
00:52:50,763 --> 00:52:53,391
The crew were anything
but discontented, sir.

481
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:55,269
Fletcher Christian corrupted them.

482
00:52:55,436 --> 00:52:58,397
Yes, but what made them
so easy to corrupt?

483
00:53:00,149 --> 00:53:03,027
I don't know.
It was the place itself.

484
00:53:15,165 --> 00:53:17,376
(Sounds of native girls
laughing and chattering)

485
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:37,482
Come here.

486
00:58:09,283 --> 00:58:10,367
(Fryer)
Mr, Christian.

487
00:58:11,285 --> 00:58:12,578
Come in, whoever you are.

488
00:58:20,671 --> 00:58:21,421
Faya!

489
00:58:24,967 --> 00:58:26,051
Captain Bligh's surprised

490
00:58:26,176 --> 00:58:29,889
that he hasn't had the pleasure of your
company at supper for some weeks.

491
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:31,474
Do you still do that?

492
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:34,144
And the Captain says
he'll expect you this evening.

493
00:58:34,602 --> 00:58:37,022
Today. Today's not Friday.

494
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,484
Six o'clock.
Prompt, if you please.

495
00:58:42,695 --> 00:58:43,946
Areya.

496
00:59:05,761 --> 00:59:07,514
Wait, Dr Huggen.

497
00:59:10,851 --> 00:59:15,022
I found the most extraordinary plant
today. On the west side of the island.

498
00:59:15,147 --> 00:59:16,983
Just by the mouth of the river.

499
00:59:25,284 --> 00:59:27,870
Mr Christian, it is half past seven.

500
00:59:28,871 --> 00:59:30,998
Well, you didn't wait for me. I hope.

501
00:59:31,082 --> 00:59:35,336
May I ask why you have come
to my table in a state of undress?

502
00:59:35,503 --> 00:59:38,882
Well, I couldn't wear the jacket.
The tattoo's too painful.

503
00:59:39,424 --> 00:59:40,425
Good God.

504
00:59:40,634 --> 00:59:42,928
Put on your jacket, Mr Christian.

505
00:59:43,262 --> 00:59:44,513
It's very painful, sir.

506
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:48,058
Put on your jacket,
Mr Christian. If you please.

507
01:00:06,037 --> 01:00:07,998
- May I serve now?
- Wait!

508
01:00:13,295 --> 01:00:14,505
Thank you, Mr Christian.

509
01:00:16,924 --> 01:00:18,550
Very well Smith,
you may serve now.

510
01:00:18,676 --> 01:00:19,761
Thank you sir.

511
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,944
- Mr Nelson.
- Sir.

512
01:00:35,111 --> 01:00:38,281
When did you last inspect
the breadfruit plants?

513
01:00:39,115 --> 01:00:40,116
Yesterday, sir.

514
01:00:40,324 --> 01:00:41,368
Not today?

515
01:00:41,535 --> 01:00:45,205
No sir. Mr Christian said a daily
inspection was not necessary.

516
01:00:45,372 --> 01:00:48,500
Oh, did he indeed?
Well, Mr Christian.

517
01:00:49,209 --> 01:00:53,423
And when do you think they will be
ready to transport in your opinion?

518
01:00:53,673 --> 01:00:55,174
They'll be some time yet, sir.

519
01:00:55,341 --> 01:00:58,136
We've already been here thirteen
weeks longer than we intended.

520
01:00:58,219 --> 01:00:59,555
Will we never leave this place?

521
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,515
Because we arrived
so late. The plants...

522
01:01:01,681 --> 01:01:05,561
I want to be advised of their progress
every day, Mr Christian.

523
01:01:05,686 --> 01:01:09,649
Unless you need the time to cover
the rest of your body in pretty pictures.

524
01:01:09,857 --> 01:01:10,525
Wait!

525
01:01:16,531 --> 01:01:19,409
The sooner
we are seamen again the better.

526
01:01:20,745 --> 01:01:22,413
Don't you agree, gentlemen?

527
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:31,631
Now perhaps you will join me in prayer.
Oh Lord, our heavenly father.

528
01:01:31,756 --> 01:01:33,967
Almighty and everlasting God.

529
01:01:34,134 --> 01:01:38,263
Most humbly do we thank thee
for what we're about to receive.

530
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:14,345
It won't be long now lads.
You'll all be on your way home.

531
01:02:15,806 --> 01:02:17,015
You're not coming?

532
01:02:17,766 --> 01:02:21,312
I fancy having a look at a few
of the other islands around here.

533
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:23,230
They'll hang you for desertion.

534
01:02:23,355 --> 01:02:24,399
Only if we're caught.

535
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:28,403
You with us, John?

536
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:34,743
No. I've got a wife
and three kids back home.

537
01:02:38,038 --> 01:02:41,959
There he goes.
Mr Bligh and bloody mighty.

538
01:02:43,253 --> 01:02:46,381
How do you fancy the Endeavour
Straits? The Indian Ocean?

539
01:02:46,548 --> 01:02:48,258
The South Atlantic?
The North Atlantic?

540
01:02:48,383 --> 01:02:50,802
Nothing
but rotten biscuits and pork.

541
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:54,682
And his bloody lordship on your back
morning, noon and night.

542
01:02:55,475 --> 01:02:57,434
Not me lads. Not me.

543
01:02:59,354 --> 01:03:00,981
When do we go then?

544
01:03:03,399 --> 01:03:05,319
Who's officer of the watch tonight?

545
01:03:06,653 --> 01:03:07,404
I am.

546
01:03:09,489 --> 01:03:10,283
Yeah?

547
01:03:11,617 --> 01:03:12,284
Yes.

548
01:03:14,662 --> 01:03:15,956
Well that's it, then.

549
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:44,821
Hey, Fletcher Christian.
Harami.

550
01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:50,869
Maieva.

551
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:58,586
Harahai.

552
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:00,087
Thank you.

553
01:04:05,427 --> 01:04:07,262
You wanted to see me, sir?

554
01:04:08,889 --> 01:04:12,351
My daughter...
She has something of yours.

555
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:13,895
Of mine?

556
01:04:19,902 --> 01:04:23,906
You are here now. Tamari.

557
01:04:25,198 --> 01:04:27,201
Well, I'm sorry, sir, I...

558
01:04:37,128 --> 01:04:39,089
Take this tusk.

559
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:45,429
When you see it, you'll remember
my daughter and my grandchild.

560
01:04:47,682 --> 01:04:49,892
You will never forget Tahiti.

561
01:04:52,103 --> 01:04:56,024
Fletcher Christian. Your wife.

562
01:05:01,947 --> 01:05:04,742
- Think we should go as well?
- No, I do not.

563
01:05:05,493 --> 01:05:08,246
Mr Heywood's going to have
to answer for this, you know.

564
01:05:08,329 --> 01:05:09,414
Poor Heywood.

565
01:05:15,421 --> 01:05:17,924
Hey, you bloody fools.

566
01:05:18,132 --> 01:05:20,969
The Hottentots out there aren't as
friendly as these ones, you know.

567
01:05:21,136 --> 01:05:22,762
Yeah. Come on lads.

568
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,268
Good luck to them
that's what I say.

569
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:29,978
They'll need it.

570
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:38,946
All hands.

571
01:05:41,032 --> 01:05:42,660
Thank you, Mr Fryer.

572
01:05:45,454 --> 01:05:49,709
Last night. Three men of
Mr Heywood's watch deserted ship.

573
01:05:50,334 --> 01:05:53,296
The penalty for which
is death by hanging.

574
01:05:53,671 --> 01:06:00,805
Mr Heywood, how is it you did not
see them? Were you asleep?

575
01:06:02,014 --> 01:06:03,307
Yes sir.

576
01:06:04,392 --> 01:06:08,021
Very well. You shall kiss
the gunner's daughter.

577
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,232
- Bosun.
- Sir.

578
01:06:11,816 --> 01:06:14,194
Put this man over the cannon.

579
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:15,780
Do it now!

580
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:17,323
Aye, aye, sir.

581
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,660
Now listen to me, all of you.

582
01:06:22,037 --> 01:06:23,454
In one week's time...

583
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:24,538
Hiya!

584
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:32,339
Stop that laughing!
Silence! You think this is funny?

585
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:36,218
You're a pitiful sight,
Dr. Huggen.

586
01:06:37,053 --> 01:06:39,013
Go below to your quarters...

587
01:06:46,605 --> 01:06:49,066
You think
this is a humorous occasion.

588
01:06:49,317 --> 01:06:54,280
You are mistaken. From now on there's
going to be discipline on this ship.

589
01:06:55,239 --> 01:06:59,536
We're going to have order.
And we're going to be like seamen.

590
01:07:00,245 --> 01:07:06,835
In one week's time we will put to sea.
There will be no more grog.

591
01:07:09,005 --> 01:07:14,052
There will be no more shore leave.
You've become a rabble, all of you.

592
01:07:14,428 --> 01:07:18,015
And you will clean up
this ship and yourselves.

593
01:07:21,268 --> 01:07:22,896
- Bosun.
- Sir!

594
01:07:23,062 --> 01:07:24,564
Administer the punishment now.

595
01:07:43,084 --> 01:07:44,252
Capitan Bligh.

596
01:07:51,885 --> 01:07:54,388
(Bligh)
Mr Christian! Mr Christian, sir.

597
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:55,389
Sir!

598
01:07:55,556 --> 01:07:58,434
(Bligh)
I wish to talk to you outside. Now!

599
01:07:58,601 --> 01:07:59,561
(Christian)
Coming sir.

600
01:07:59,728 --> 01:08:00,770
Thank you.

601
01:08:22,836 --> 01:08:24,213
Is there anything wrong, sir?

602
01:08:24,338 --> 01:08:28,009
Yes. Last night while the mate
of the watch was asleep, three...

603
01:08:28,176 --> 01:08:29,343
Stop that noise!

604
01:08:30,512 --> 01:08:31,304
Fiya!

605
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:43,192
Three men jumped ship last night.
Churchill was one of them.

606
01:08:44,485 --> 01:08:45,779
You don't seem surprised?

607
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:49,950
Now that it's happened, no.
No, I'm not surprised.

608
01:08:50,367 --> 01:08:52,327
I must say
I'm no longer surprised myself

609
01:08:52,453 --> 01:08:54,872
when I see the example being set
by my first officer.

610
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:56,874
Just look at yourself, man.
Look at the way you're dressed.

611
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:59,418
Come on. You're no better
than one of these natives.

612
01:09:00,378 --> 01:09:01,838
At least I am no worse.

613
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:04,216
I think your brain
has been overheated, sir.

614
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:06,301
And your body overindulged
in sexual excess.

615
01:09:06,385 --> 01:09:08,762
I have done no more than
any natural man would do.

616
01:09:08,887 --> 01:09:11,724
No. You have done no more
than any wild animal would do.

617
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:12,892
It always makes me laugh,

618
01:09:13,017 --> 01:09:15,729
but when men lose their self-restraint
they say they're natural.

619
01:09:15,854 --> 01:09:19,316
They are more natural than men
who have nothing to restrain.

620
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:22,778
Mr Christian, you will report
to the ship before sundown.

621
01:09:22,903 --> 01:09:23,695
Is that understood?

622
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:24,864
No. No.

623
01:09:25,614 --> 01:09:32,246
What did you say? You said no. Is that
what you said? Is that what you said?

624
01:09:32,538 --> 01:09:36,209
No. Alright. You will report to the ship
immediately. Do you understand me?

625
01:09:36,376 --> 01:09:37,586
And you will stay on ship.

626
01:09:37,753 --> 01:09:40,589
There will be no more mixing with the
degenerate natives of these islands.

627
01:09:40,756 --> 01:09:42,466
By any of my officers.
Or by any of my crew.

628
01:09:42,633 --> 01:09:44,719
You comprehend
my meaning, sir? Good.

629
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:07,327
(Crew member) Keep em' coming.
Move it along. Don't drop them.

630
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:12,082
Come on, Purcell. Remember
that's what we're here for.

631
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:14,752
And the next one please.

632
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:18,005
Come on. Keep them coming.
Good lads.

633
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:35,775
Alright. Where are they?

634
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,653
I don't know yet, sir.
We'll find them.

635
01:10:45,661 --> 01:10:48,748
Damn fools.
Don't make it worse for yourself.

636
01:10:52,001 --> 01:10:52,960
Stand up.

637
01:10:54,796 --> 01:10:55,797
Stand up!

638
01:10:56,965 --> 01:11:00,886
He can't, sir. Bit of trouble
with the locals out there.

639
01:11:02,138 --> 01:11:04,515
You know the penalty
for desertion, mister?

640
01:11:05,892 --> 01:11:08,353
We came back
of our own accord, sir.

641
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,397
You're a mindless animal,
Churchill.

642
01:11:10,897 --> 01:11:13,859
I will decide your punishment
when you're fit to receive it.

643
01:11:14,192 --> 01:11:17,070
Mr Cole!
Get Dr Huggen.

644
01:11:18,906 --> 01:11:20,074
Aye, aye, sir.

645
01:11:26,205 --> 01:11:27,749
(Sound of dog barking)

646
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,187
Sir. Over here.

647
01:11:55,238 --> 01:11:55,989
Is he dead?

648
01:11:56,114 --> 01:11:56,990
Yes sir.

649
01:11:57,366 --> 01:11:59,868
Poor bugger. Alright, bury him.

650
01:12:01,912 --> 01:12:04,123
Will you organise
that please, Mr Cole?

651
01:13:57,415 --> 01:13:58,457
Fletcher.

652
01:14:23,235 --> 01:14:24,862
I've come to say good-bye.

653
01:14:31,452 --> 01:14:33,955
You do not come back.
Do you?

654
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:37,376
Ever?

655
01:15:25,346 --> 01:15:27,306
- I must go now.
- No.

656
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:32,812
Not yet. Soon.

657
01:16:56,571 --> 01:16:58,490
Eyes front, Mr Christian!

658
01:17:05,748 --> 01:17:07,249
Off hats.

659
01:17:09,044 --> 01:17:11,004
Take the men below.

660
01:17:16,802 --> 01:17:19,680
- Make sail, Mr Fryer.
- Aye, sir.

661
01:17:21,599 --> 01:17:22,475
Stand aside.

662
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:27,439
Stand down.

663
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:35,948
Stand down!

664
01:17:38,368 --> 01:17:40,745
Come on, lads.
No sense in this.

665
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:16,810
(Sounds of ship's timbers creaking)

666
01:19:23,442 --> 01:19:30,616
Well, gentlemen, between ourselves
and home are 27,000 sea miles,

667
01:19:30,741 --> 01:19:34,163
the Endeavour Straits
and the Great Barrier Reef.

668
01:19:35,455 --> 01:19:38,292
Now the crew is deeply
demoralised, gentlemen.

669
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:42,171
And I must accept,
as every captain must accept,

670
01:19:42,379 --> 01:19:45,800
the inevitable and theoretical
responsibilty for that.

671
01:19:48,678 --> 01:19:52,933
The actual and immediate
responsibilty, however,

672
01:19:53,058 --> 01:19:55,561
I place on you,
my fellow officers,

673
01:19:55,686 --> 01:19:59,899
who met this crisis
with lethargy, impudence

674
01:20:00,024 --> 01:20:04,571
and flagrant defiance
publicly uttered.

675
01:20:07,783 --> 01:20:12,663
And perhaps also for that,
I am to blame.

676
01:20:13,832 --> 01:20:18,128
I counted on a strength of character
which you do not possess.

677
01:20:18,628 --> 01:20:24,968
However, the cure
for our predicament is discipline.

678
01:20:26,429 --> 01:20:30,433
And I shall apply it
with an even hand, of course,

679
01:20:30,558 --> 01:20:33,478
but most
where it is most required.

680
01:20:36,523 --> 01:20:38,942
Yes, well that will be all.
Thank you.

681
01:20:39,068 --> 01:20:42,071
You may leave now.
Not you, Mr Christian.

682
01:20:48,661 --> 01:20:51,665
Leave it. Now!

683
01:20:57,630 --> 01:21:01,133
Alright, Smith, you may
go and close the door, please.

684
01:21:06,348 --> 01:21:12,104
So. You think
I'm harsh with you, eh?

685
01:21:16,192 --> 01:21:20,739
Look, I've been at sea many years,
Fletcher. Since I was twelve.

686
01:21:20,864 --> 01:21:24,576
And I have seen many men,
many good men,

687
01:21:24,743 --> 01:21:28,038
Iose their heads over native
women in these waters.

688
01:21:28,205 --> 01:21:30,875
And I've never yet
seen it come out well.

689
01:21:32,543 --> 01:21:35,463
Of course I understand
the excitement and... um.

690
01:21:38,633 --> 01:21:40,594
But think to yourself, man.

691
01:21:41,136 --> 01:21:44,890
Could you take a woman like that back
home to your friends and family?

692
01:21:45,015 --> 01:21:47,351
No, of course you couldn't.

693
01:21:47,726 --> 01:21:51,857
They're not like us, Fletcher.
You think I was harsh with you.

694
01:21:51,982 --> 01:21:56,611
But you needed someone to show
you where your duty really lay.

695
01:21:57,530 --> 01:22:00,240
Because you were
at a loss, my friend.

696
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:03,411
You may not thank me now
but you will later.

697
01:22:05,329 --> 01:22:08,875
So, let's get the ship
running properly

698
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,047
and get back
to where we were before.

699
01:22:17,926 --> 01:22:19,012
Now look, Fletcher.

700
01:22:22,724 --> 01:22:24,017
Listen to me.

701
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:29,148
I am prepared to forgive
and I am prepared to forget.

702
01:22:29,398 --> 01:22:30,900
Do you understand me?

703
01:22:34,779 --> 01:22:36,113
Will that be all sir?

704
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,369
- Yes, that will be all.
- Thank you.

705
01:22:57,846 --> 01:22:59,181
You sent for me, sir?

706
01:22:59,973 --> 01:23:05,188
Yes I did. This ship is filthy,
Mr Christian.

707
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:08,566
Sir?

708
01:23:08,983 --> 01:23:12,404
The ship is filthy, Mr Christian!
Look for yourself.

709
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:16,116
Look! Filthy, sir! Filth there!

710
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:18,535
And there! And there!
Look at there!

711
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:22,916
I understand you dismissed
the swabbing party.

712
01:23:22,999 --> 01:23:26,419
You left these decks crusted
with grime. Look at it there!

713
01:23:27,879 --> 01:23:31,174
Bloody disgrace.
Now you'll be well advised, sir,

714
01:23:31,383 --> 01:23:34,971
to call them back again
and this time do it properly.

715
01:23:35,096 --> 01:23:36,472
Do you understand me?

716
01:23:43,021 --> 01:23:46,984
Filth Sir! Filthy Mr Christian.
Still filthy! Look!

717
01:23:48,193 --> 01:23:50,279
I see nothing, sir, but your finger.

718
01:23:50,404 --> 01:23:53,158
I'll not have your vile ways
brought aboard my ship, sir!

719
01:23:53,324 --> 01:23:54,617
Do you understand?

720
01:23:54,909 --> 01:23:57,203
Now you'll call up
the swabbing party, yet again!

721
01:23:57,328 --> 01:24:00,123
And this time you'll make bloody sure
that the decks are clean!

722
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:02,041
Or by God
you'll answer for it sir!

723
01:24:02,209 --> 01:24:05,713
I'll not have any of your filthy
gutter ways on board my ship!

724
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:10,134
Do you understand? Pigs in a sty
have more comprehension

725
01:24:10,259 --> 01:24:12,971
or cleanliness
than you buggers have.

726
01:24:13,888 --> 01:24:15,849
Now you'll get
these decks clean

727
01:24:15,932 --> 01:24:19,019
or by God I'll make you
lick them clean with your tongues

728
01:24:19,186 --> 01:24:21,147
if you don't mend your ways.

729
01:24:51,097 --> 01:24:52,931
There is a thief among us.

730
01:24:53,932 --> 01:24:57,312
Yes, there is a thief on board
this ship, which is unfortunate

731
01:24:57,437 --> 01:25:00,607
because you know what hardship
that means for honest men.

732
01:25:01,232 --> 01:25:03,735
Last night,
my personal store of coconuts

733
01:25:03,944 --> 01:25:05,779
was well up
to the top of the netting.

734
01:25:05,904 --> 01:25:09,409
This morning, I - Well
I mean look for yourselves. See.

735
01:25:09,826 --> 01:25:13,288
Now if the thief will declare himself,
I will punish him alone.

736
01:25:13,413 --> 01:25:14,872
And then
we can forget the matter.

737
01:25:14,997 --> 01:25:15,749
Sir.

738
01:25:15,874 --> 01:25:19,920
Hold your tongue, Goddamn you sir!
I'm addressing the crew, Mr Christian.

739
01:25:20,128 --> 01:25:21,797
Who do you think you are?

740
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:28,721
Now if the thief
will not declare himself.

741
01:25:28,805 --> 01:25:29,847
I took one.

742
01:25:31,433 --> 01:25:32,183
You?

743
01:25:33,852 --> 01:25:36,438
I was thirsty.
I took one of your coconuts.

744
01:25:36,563 --> 01:25:37,981
I thought it of no consequence.

745
01:25:38,148 --> 01:25:41,610
One coconut, Mr Christian?
A dozen were taken, man.

746
01:25:41,986 --> 01:25:43,738
I know nothing of a dozen.

747
01:25:48,701 --> 01:25:50,787
Then, unless you're a liar
as well as a thief,

748
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:53,332
the rest were taken
by other members of your watch

749
01:25:53,457 --> 01:25:55,876
who look to you
for their example do they not, sir?

750
01:25:56,418 --> 01:25:58,963
- Mr Cole.
- Sir.

751
01:25:59,297 --> 01:26:02,634
Impound the personal stores of
every man on Mr Christian's watch

752
01:26:02,759 --> 01:26:04,428
and put them on half rations.

753
01:26:04,553 --> 01:26:07,514
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Thank you. Stand down.

754
01:26:55,901 --> 01:26:58,528
(Sounds of movement on deck)

755
01:27:14,589 --> 01:27:17,300
That isn' t a raft,
it's a coffin.

756
01:27:18,676 --> 01:27:22,096
There's a five-knot current running
between here and that island.

757
01:27:23,181 --> 01:27:24,474
I'll take my chance.

758
01:27:26,894 --> 01:27:29,730
You think a lot of us
haven't thought of this?

759
01:27:29,897 --> 01:27:32,942
You're not the only one
to have left a woman behind.

760
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:36,613
Fletcher,
the men are ready for anything.

761
01:27:42,661 --> 01:27:45,790
What are you saying, Ned?
Are you inciting me to mutiny?

762
01:27:45,956 --> 01:27:48,793
If I were you,
I'd take the ship. That's all.

763
01:27:51,671 --> 01:27:53,047
Why don't you, then?

764
01:27:53,172 --> 01:27:56,134
I said if I were you. I'm not.

765
01:28:08,606 --> 01:28:12,653
What I have to say to you is
the result of considerable reflection.

766
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:15,656
Its consequences
would be two-fold.

767
01:28:16,782 --> 01:28:19,702
Firstly,
our journey will be shortened.

768
01:28:19,827 --> 01:28:23,289
Which I know is a consideration
that cannot distress you.

769
01:28:23,539 --> 01:28:27,085
And secondly,
upon its successful conclusion

770
01:28:27,293 --> 01:28:32,132
not one of you in later years
will look back without a surge of pride.

771
01:28:35,844 --> 01:28:40,225
We shall go with the winds
to Jamaica by way of Cape Horn.

772
01:28:42,686 --> 01:28:43,854
You'll kill us all.

773
01:28:49,235 --> 01:28:50,819
What did you say, Adams?

774
01:28:51,236 --> 01:28:55,200
We tried the Horn before.
It was almost the end of us.

775
01:28:58,036 --> 01:29:00,998
Damn you, man.
Don't you bloody cross me.

776
01:29:06,963 --> 01:29:09,465
Mr Cole, take this man below.

777
01:29:10,091 --> 01:29:13,553
And tomorrow we will assemble
to watch him receive punishment

778
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,388
for cowardice
and insubordination.

779
01:29:16,473 --> 01:29:18,392
Mr Cole.
Take him below, sir!

780
01:29:18,975 --> 01:29:21,186
You, Mr Fryer.
Give him the makings.

781
01:29:21,437 --> 01:29:22,230
Sir.

782
01:29:25,233 --> 01:29:32,199
Now. We set out to circumnavigate
the globe. And by God we shall do it.

783
01:29:33,367 --> 01:29:37,747
To the greater glory of us all.
Is that understood?

784
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:45,046
Thank you.
Now you may dismiss.

785
01:29:55,474 --> 01:29:58,060
(Murmurings among the crew)

786
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:04,109
(Knock on door)
Enter.

787
01:30:07,362 --> 01:30:10,324
- Can I have a word with you?
- I'm busy. Is it important?

788
01:30:11,034 --> 01:30:12,118
I think, yes.

789
01:30:13,661 --> 01:30:14,788
Be brief!

790
01:30:18,917 --> 01:30:21,503
William, about your decision
to go around the Horn.

791
01:30:21,628 --> 01:30:25,257
William? Not sir?
Not captain? William.

792
01:30:27,218 --> 01:30:28,969
I don't think the men will have it.

793
01:30:29,136 --> 01:30:32,766
Oh, the men won't have it.
Are they in charge of the Bounty?

794
01:30:34,184 --> 01:30:35,603
They might be if you insist.

795
01:30:35,728 --> 01:30:39,148
Again. Will you repeat that, please?
The men might be in charge.

796
01:30:39,273 --> 01:30:41,150
What are you threatening me with?

797
01:30:41,776 --> 01:30:43,653
It's not a threat, it's a warning.

798
01:30:43,778 --> 01:30:45,405
Oh. There are rumblings,
are there?

799
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:47,741
No. There is fear.

800
01:30:49,534 --> 01:30:51,995
Around the Horn
is the easiest way. The better way.

801
01:30:52,162 --> 01:30:54,665
And that is
how we will go. Anything more?

802
01:30:56,125 --> 01:30:57,585
Don't put Adams under the lash.

803
01:30:57,752 --> 01:31:00,296
He was insubordinate.
Cowardly and insubordinate.

804
01:31:00,505 --> 01:31:03,800
He frightened the men.
I did not put that fear there, he did.

805
01:31:04,467 --> 01:31:07,888
So he will be lashed
and we will go around the Horn.

806
01:31:10,516 --> 01:31:13,311
Are you frightened to go
around the Horn, Mr Christian?

807
01:31:13,477 --> 01:31:15,522
Are you a coward too, sir?

808
01:31:58,152 --> 01:32:00,029
There will be no killing.

809
01:32:01,114 --> 01:32:01,906
Except Bligh.

810
01:32:02,073 --> 01:32:06,285
There will be no killing.
We set him adrift.

811
01:32:16,172 --> 01:32:18,841
Hi. Christian's taking the ship.
Are you with us?

812
01:32:18,967 --> 01:32:21,928
(Seaman) Come on, wake up.
We're taking the ship.

813
01:32:23,763 --> 01:32:24,764
- Wake up.
- Mmm.

814
01:32:24,889 --> 01:32:25,724
- Wake up!
- Whaa!

815
01:32:25,891 --> 01:32:29,562
Shut up. Christian's taking the ship.
Christian's taking the ship.

816
01:32:30,437 --> 01:32:33,649
We're taking the ship. Are you with us?
Come on.

817
01:32:42,743 --> 01:32:46,873
Come on, Fryer. Wake up!
Get up! Come on, Fryer!

818
01:32:51,461 --> 01:32:55,423
Mr Bligh.
Will you get up? Get up.

819
01:32:57,217 --> 01:32:58,009
Get up!

820
01:33:02,098 --> 01:33:03,265
On your feet.

821
01:33:06,602 --> 01:33:08,063
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

822
01:33:08,188 --> 01:33:09,105
Tie him.

823
01:33:09,314 --> 01:33:10,440
What are you doing?

824
01:33:10,565 --> 01:33:12,359
Mr Cole! Mr Cole!

825
01:33:16,029 --> 01:33:17,782
Come on, get up on deck.

826
01:33:18,366 --> 01:33:20,535
Mr Cole! You'll hang, for this.

827
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:21,953
Mr Nelson.

828
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:29,086
We've taken the ship.
We've taken the ship.

829
01:33:29,336 --> 01:33:32,298
(Seaman) We've taken the ship.
We've got Bligh. Get on deck.

830
01:33:36,594 --> 01:33:38,180
Dance. Dance.

831
01:33:39,556 --> 01:33:40,306
Easy.

832
01:33:42,017 --> 01:33:43,143
Dance. Dance.

833
01:33:43,226 --> 01:33:45,479
You shut up. Dance. Dance.

834
01:33:51,194 --> 01:33:53,112
Come on. Get going.

835
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:56,700
You're a fool, Quintel.
You'll hang for this.

836
01:34:03,124 --> 01:34:05,334
- Are you in this, Norton?
- No, sir I'm not.

837
01:34:05,835 --> 01:34:07,503
Shut up your trap!

838
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:09,506
Desist this madness!

839
01:34:09,631 --> 01:34:10,965
Be quiet!

840
01:34:11,174 --> 01:34:13,551
Have you any conception
of what you're doing?

841
01:34:13,718 --> 01:34:15,220
Just shut your mouth!

842
01:34:15,554 --> 01:34:17,014
Are you in this, Adams?

843
01:34:17,097 --> 01:34:20,100
It's all you fault. There was
never a coward on this ship!

844
01:34:20,267 --> 01:34:20,810
You're a coward, sir!

845
01:34:20,977 --> 01:34:22,353
And that was your mistake!

846
01:34:22,561 --> 01:34:23,939
You're a blackhearted villian, sir!

847
01:34:24,147 --> 01:34:26,482
Pritchard, get over here.

848
01:34:27,067 --> 01:34:28,068
Stay there, Pritchard.

849
01:34:28,193 --> 01:34:30,446
Stay Pritchard, you're a man.

850
01:34:30,863 --> 01:34:32,739
Get over then.

851
01:34:35,451 --> 01:34:37,119
Allison, get over here!

852
01:34:38,496 --> 01:34:40,707
Shut up. I'm staying here.

853
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:42,334
Let's kill the bugger now, lads.

854
01:34:44,461 --> 01:34:46,713
I said leave him!
You sodding bastards!

855
01:34:47,589 --> 01:34:49,550
You take you hands off him!

856
01:34:49,633 --> 01:34:50,217
Let's kill him.

857
01:34:50,342 --> 01:34:51,552
Take your hands off him, now!

858
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:52,553
Kill him!

859
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,556
Get your hands off him. Now!

860
01:35:01,188 --> 01:35:03,231
Mr Christian,
I appeal to you sir.

861
01:35:03,356 --> 01:35:05,484
Put aside this madness and it will be
forgotten. I give you my word.

862
01:35:05,609 --> 01:35:06,527
It's too late.

863
01:35:06,652 --> 01:35:09,238
Think of my family and
my friendship. Think of my wife.

864
01:35:09,446 --> 01:35:16,330
I am in hell. Hell, sir! Why are you
being so damn reasonable, now?

865
01:35:19,291 --> 01:35:22,962
God damn your blood
to hell with mine, sir!

866
01:35:23,129 --> 01:35:24,463
God damn your blood!

867
01:35:24,588 --> 01:35:25,757
Mr Christian,
get a hold of yourself!

868
01:35:25,882 --> 01:35:27,884
You be quiet
or I will run you through.

869
01:35:28,051 --> 01:35:29,302
Do it, Christian. Kill him!

870
01:35:29,511 --> 01:35:34,683
Just shut your mouth! Shut
your mouth! I will run you through!

871
01:35:34,850 --> 01:35:38,812
And then I will kill myself after.
You get him dressed now.

872
01:35:39,063 --> 01:35:41,107
Get him dressed!

873
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:43,151
Bastard!

874
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:45,320
What's the matter with you all?

875
01:35:45,486 --> 01:35:46,446
You be quiet!

876
01:35:46,572 --> 01:35:48,156
Gun him down, damn you!
They're common criminals.

877
01:35:48,323 --> 01:35:50,159
Get out of it, Cole!

878
01:35:55,290 --> 01:35:59,044
You will be silent or
I will have you killed! You bastard!

879
01:35:59,294 --> 01:36:03,673
You do and you will have
my blood on your hands.

880
01:36:04,174 --> 01:36:05,509
Stop!

881
01:36:07,093 --> 01:36:13,643
Quiet! We will get him in the boat.
Set him adrift. Get him dressed!

882
01:36:16,855 --> 01:36:19,440
Will someone
give me my britches?

883
01:36:19,692 --> 01:36:21,902
Pass us your watch up here then.

884
01:36:22,027 --> 01:36:23,821
Come on, move yourselves.

885
01:36:31,704 --> 01:36:34,374
You blackguard! Traitors!

886
01:36:38,712 --> 01:36:40,756
Mr Bligh, come here, please.

887
01:36:43,134 --> 01:36:46,179
If you wish to leave some
of these men on the ship,

888
01:36:46,345 --> 01:36:48,681
I give you my word
they will not be harmed.

889
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:51,601
Lads. One of you will have
to come out. There's no room.

890
01:36:51,768 --> 01:36:54,229
Mr Fryer,
you come up here.

891
01:36:54,563 --> 01:36:56,023
(Seaman) We'll do without him.
We don't want you.

892
01:36:56,189 --> 01:36:57,316
Mr Fryer. Get up here.

893
01:36:57,441 --> 01:37:00,194
Stay where you are.
Or I'll blow your head off.

894
01:37:01,279 --> 01:37:03,740
God damn you!
You're the scum of the earth!

895
01:37:05,074 --> 01:37:06,326
Fulman. Get up here.

896
01:37:07,452 --> 01:37:09,246
Come on, Fulman.
Move yourself.

897
01:37:09,913 --> 01:37:10,872
Faster, man.

898
01:37:15,044 --> 01:37:18,340
It will be fairly reported that you were
not part of this rabble. Thank you.

899
01:37:21,593 --> 01:37:23,971
Smith bring that chest to me.

900
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:25,430
Do it now.

901
01:37:28,058 --> 01:37:29,018
Get in the boat.

902
01:37:35,984 --> 01:37:37,152
(Crew member laughing)

903
01:37:45,495 --> 01:37:47,455
What use is that without charts?

904
01:37:48,748 --> 01:37:51,710
I need the charts. Turn around.

905
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:56,840
You really think you'll be able
to command this rabble?

906
01:37:57,007 --> 01:37:57,925
I'll do my best.

907
01:37:58,634 --> 01:38:02,930
Well, I did my best
and I had the authority of the law.

908
01:38:03,848 --> 01:38:05,016
You're a dead man, Fletcher.

909
01:38:05,266 --> 01:38:07,060
(Crew members)
That's enough of that.

910
01:38:07,561 --> 01:38:08,895
Get on the boat, sir.

911
01:38:13,234 --> 01:38:13,859
Quickly.

912
01:38:13,984 --> 01:38:16,445
You've not seen the last of me,
Ned Young. Take my word for it.

913
01:38:16,654 --> 01:38:19,490
Thank you, Mr Lamb.
Or you, John Adams.

914
01:38:19,991 --> 01:38:20,950
You've not seen the last of me.

915
01:38:21,158 --> 01:38:23,745
- I wouldn't wager on it.
- We shall see, sir.

916
01:38:28,667 --> 01:38:29,793
I'll see you hanged.

917
01:38:31,462 --> 01:38:32,546
Veer them away.

918
01:38:33,213 --> 01:38:35,174
- Did you bring anything, Smith?
- Yeah I got a carpent...

919
01:38:35,299 --> 01:38:38,261
Veer them away...

920
01:38:40,097 --> 01:38:42,892
(Cole) Get ready, boys.
Get the oars out.

921
01:38:43,309 --> 01:38:45,227
(Mutineer)
Sorry to see you go.

922
01:38:45,519 --> 01:38:48,272
Isn't this what you came for?
Here you go.

923
01:38:49,691 --> 01:38:52,652
(Cheers and jeers
from the mutineers)

924
01:39:05,583 --> 01:39:09,962
(Mutineer) Goodbye, boys.
Hope I never see you again.

925
01:39:10,714 --> 01:39:12,966
If you get home,
tell my mother that I love her.

926
01:39:13,091 --> 01:39:15,177
She's got a lovely
little Tahitian grandson.

927
01:39:22,143 --> 01:39:25,522
Have a long ride, Tim.
I hope they bloody eat yer, Fryer.

928
01:39:59,101 --> 01:40:01,728
(Bligh's voice over) I hope never
to see Fletcher Christian again.

929
01:40:01,811 --> 01:40:03,605
Unless it is to see him hanged.

930
01:40:04,773 --> 01:40:08,068
How could he betray my friendship
and kindness to him?

931
01:40:08,903 --> 01:40:12,866
I can only assume he has decided
to return to a life in Tahiti.

932
01:40:15,661 --> 01:40:18,914
After taking stock of the meagre
provisions allowed us,

933
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:22,042
I have decided to make
for the island of Tafuha

934
01:40:22,293 --> 01:40:25,421
in the hope of supplementing
our supplies of food and water.

935
01:40:27,299 --> 01:40:29,760
By now,
there are many natives about us.

936
01:40:30,302 --> 01:40:34,598
And by their manner, we do not expect
our welcome to last much longer.

937
01:40:42,774 --> 01:40:44,650
- Mr Cole?
- Sir.

938
01:40:44,860 --> 01:40:46,861
You take charge of my log...

939
01:40:48,113 --> 01:40:53,452
and slowly make
your way out to the launch.

940
01:40:56,998 --> 01:40:59,417
- Easy, Mr Cole.
- Aye, aye, sir.

941
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:05,715
Go now?

942
01:41:06,467 --> 01:41:08,469
Now. That's right.

943
01:41:09,345 --> 01:41:13,266
(Sound of natives angry chanting)

944
01:41:21,525 --> 01:41:25,655
You give me no summer,
my boys. Nasty bugger.

945
01:41:25,905 --> 01:41:26,822
(Seaman)
Come on lads.

946
01:41:26,989 --> 01:41:32,120
Get in the boat! Lose that barrel.
Stop playing games.

947
01:41:40,046 --> 01:41:41,380
Is that what you want?

948
01:41:53,268 --> 01:41:55,896
Everybody in the boat!
Prepare to pull away!

949
01:41:57,856 --> 01:41:58,650
Mr Bligh.

950
01:41:58,733 --> 01:42:02,654
Where's the captain?
Where's Mr Bligh?

951
01:42:02,946 --> 01:42:03,905
Over there.

952
01:42:05,407 --> 01:42:08,285
Come on then.

953
01:42:08,535 --> 01:42:09,578
Norton come back. You fool.

954
01:42:10,288 --> 01:42:11,247
Mr Bligh!

955
01:42:11,414 --> 01:42:12,831
What are you doing?

956
01:42:13,416 --> 01:42:14,667
Get aboard, sir!

957
01:42:25,388 --> 01:42:26,472
Mr Bligh.

958
01:42:28,975 --> 01:42:33,187
Get back, you bastards!
Keep back, you bastards!

959
01:42:40,738 --> 01:42:42,156
I'll have your eyes for footballs!

960
01:42:42,323 --> 01:42:43,532
Get back in the boat!

961
01:42:53,085 --> 01:42:53,961
Help the man.

962
01:42:54,127 --> 01:42:56,130
Get in the boat, sir.

963
01:43:03,179 --> 01:43:05,015
My God, no!

964
01:43:10,645 --> 01:43:13,440
Row for your lives!
Take your clothes off.

965
01:43:17,404 --> 01:43:19,405
Throw your clothes over!
Bloody savages!

966
01:43:23,786 --> 01:43:26,747
We're chops and liver
to them if they catch us.

967
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:34,964
That's the spirit.
Come on, we'll do it.

968
01:43:55,946 --> 01:44:00,660
We cannot risk going ashore again.
What are we going to do, sir?

969
01:44:06,708 --> 01:44:09,336
Well, we shall just have
to try and reach Coupang.

970
01:44:09,503 --> 01:44:10,504
Without charts?

971
01:44:12,214 --> 01:44:15,259
Well, I shall have to navigate
from memory, Mr Fryer.

972
01:44:15,926 --> 01:44:20,306
It'll take us close to the most
savage islands in these waters.

973
01:44:20,514 --> 01:44:24,603
The Fiji islands where cannibalism
is perfected almost to a science.

974
01:44:25,270 --> 01:44:27,105
And from there,
my friends, God willing,

975
01:44:27,231 --> 01:44:30,066
we shall proceed onward
to the Great Barrier Reef itself.

976
01:44:30,234 --> 01:44:31,735
Then
to the coast of New Holland

977
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:33,946
and from there across
the Timor Sea to Coupang.

978
01:44:34,072 --> 01:44:36,198
Now it will take us
at least two months

979
01:44:36,366 --> 01:44:39,703
and we have provisions or more
enough to last us one week.

980
01:44:40,537 --> 01:44:43,373
So that is the situation,
gentlemen. Plain and simple.

981
01:44:49,088 --> 01:44:51,883
Well, we'll just have to make
the best of it. Won't we sir?

982
01:44:52,425 --> 01:44:54,385
Make the best of it, Smith?
Yes, but will you?

983
01:44:54,552 --> 01:44:57,138
That's what I ask myself.
Will you make the best of it?

984
01:44:57,263 --> 01:45:01,560
Do you hear me? Are you prepared
to make the best of it? All of you?

985
01:45:01,894 --> 01:45:05,564
Because all I can promise you, lads,
is relentless pain and hardship.

986
01:45:05,815 --> 01:45:09,777
Now, if you're prepared
to make do and make sacrifices

987
01:45:09,903 --> 01:45:13,073
and furthermore
are willing to swear by it,

988
01:45:13,282 --> 01:45:16,494
I promise you our chances
of survival are fair.

989
01:45:18,954 --> 01:45:21,540
You hear me?
You all say, aye.

990
01:45:22,375 --> 01:45:23,459
(Seaman)
Aye.

991
01:45:23,709 --> 01:45:24,627
Good.

992
01:45:27,338 --> 01:45:28,674
Mr Fryer, make way.

993
01:45:29,925 --> 01:45:33,762
Prepare to make way.
Make way.

994
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:40,854
(Bligh and crew
sing a sea shanty)

995
01:46:05,756 --> 01:46:06,757
Fletcher!

996
01:46:13,347 --> 01:46:14,558
Fletcher!

997
01:46:42,213 --> 01:46:46,009
In the box are gifts
for the people of Tahiti.

998
01:46:49,513 --> 01:46:53,893
We did not expect you back. We have
already given you everything.

999
01:46:55,603 --> 01:47:00,275
We only want our women. And perhaps
some men to help me sail the ship.

1000
01:47:01,401 --> 01:47:04,488
Where's Captain Bligh?
Why doesn't he come himself?

1001
01:47:05,656 --> 01:47:08,701
He's no longer with us.
I've taken the ship.

1002
01:47:10,036 --> 01:47:10,744
He's dead.

1003
01:47:10,911 --> 01:47:15,500
No. No, he's not dead. We set him
adrift with some of the crew.

1004
01:47:25,136 --> 01:47:30,517
You shame me by coming here.
You shame me.

1005
01:47:32,352 --> 01:47:33,979
King George
will send many ships

1006
01:47:34,062 --> 01:47:37,483
with many guns to punish us
for what you have done.

1007
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:41,820
We can give you nothing.
Go now.

1008
01:47:46,034 --> 01:47:50,163
Some of the men would like to remain
here and wait for the next ship.

1009
01:47:50,413 --> 01:47:53,583
Er, they wanted to go with Bligh
but there was no room in his boat.

1010
01:47:57,379 --> 01:47:59,965
(Chief and advisor speaks
in native dialect)

1011
01:48:02,969 --> 01:48:07,432
They can stay, but not you.
Take your gifts and go.

1012
01:48:08,892 --> 01:48:11,103
(Chief speaks in native tongue)

1013
01:48:11,437 --> 01:48:12,271
No!

1014
01:48:14,273 --> 01:48:16,234
(Chief speaks in native tongue)

1015
01:48:18,277 --> 01:48:20,989
Should she not be allowed
to choose for herself, sir?

1016
01:48:28,915 --> 01:48:29,665
Ah.

1017
01:49:02,869 --> 01:49:06,206
(Chief 's daughter
speaks in native tongue)

1018
01:49:29,774 --> 01:49:31,233
Where will you take her?

1019
01:49:33,986 --> 01:49:37,907
I don't know. Somewhere
the British ships won't find us.

1020
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:45,583
Take her. You will have
all the men you need. Go now.

1021
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:06,272
(Sounds of natives cheering)

1022
01:50:36,389 --> 01:50:37,181
Goodbye, Peter.

1023
01:50:37,306 --> 01:50:38,307
Good luck, sir.

1024
01:50:39,226 --> 01:50:41,060
I think you'll need it more than I.

1025
01:50:41,144 --> 01:50:41,728
Thank you.

1026
01:50:48,277 --> 01:50:54,701
I'm not coming, Fletcher.
I've thought it out. And I'm staying here.

1027
01:50:58,955 --> 01:50:59,706
Let's go.

1028
01:50:59,831 --> 01:51:01,750
I think I'll stay too, sir.

1029
01:51:03,628 --> 01:51:05,796
Get out. Let's go.

1030
01:51:06,506 --> 01:51:07,798
Come on lads.

1031
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:11,803
They'll hang you.

1032
01:51:13,430 --> 01:51:15,306
I might just have a lucky face.

1033
01:52:54,958 --> 01:52:58,087
(Crewmen)
Here they come. Get it. Good one.

1034
01:53:00,965 --> 01:53:03,718
Loads of them.
They're all over the place.

1035
01:53:17,484 --> 01:53:22,114
Here we go. There we go. Go on.
Sod it. Who loaded these things?

1036
01:53:26,493 --> 01:53:29,413
Come on, man.
Quick. Yeah!

1037
01:53:38,715 --> 01:53:41,928
(Christian's voice over)
The only one I wholly trust is Adams.

1038
01:53:42,011 --> 01:53:44,346
I go everywhere
with a loaded pistol.

1039
01:53:45,181 --> 01:53:49,561
And where we are to head beyond
the reach of justice, I know not.

1040
01:54:07,789 --> 01:54:10,250
(Bligh's voice over)
Thursday June 11th.

1041
01:54:10,834 --> 01:54:14,713
In the afternoon we saw gannets
and many other birds.

1042
01:54:14,922 --> 01:54:18,175
And at sunset
we caught one in our sail.

1043
01:54:18,510 --> 01:54:21,388
Which I reserved
for our dinner next day.

1044
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:23,181
Who shall have this?

1045
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:25,684
Smith.

1046
01:54:31,566 --> 01:54:33,275
And who shall have this?

1047
01:54:34,069 --> 01:54:34,903
Mr Fryer.

1048
01:54:43,537 --> 01:54:45,706
What about the rest of us?

1049
01:54:45,873 --> 01:54:49,210
You just have to wait your turn,
Purcell, like everyone else.

1050
01:54:49,377 --> 01:54:51,129
Some of us
haven't had nothing in days.

1051
01:54:51,254 --> 01:54:52,756
That's enough, Purcell.

1052
01:54:53,131 --> 01:54:57,094
Well, it's not enough for me, sir!
I'll tell you something.

1053
01:54:57,427 --> 01:54:59,763
The officers
and their lot get everything.

1054
01:54:59,888 --> 01:55:01,516
Shut your mouth, Purcell.

1055
01:55:01,766 --> 01:55:04,227
I'm as much a man
as you are, sir.

1056
01:55:04,352 --> 01:55:05,311
What did you say?

1057
01:55:05,436 --> 01:55:07,439
I said
I'm as much a man as you are!

1058
01:55:07,647 --> 01:55:10,150
Are you indeed?
I'm not so certain about that.

1059
01:55:11,318 --> 01:55:14,738
Sit down, damn you!
I'll knock you on the head with it.

1060
01:55:14,863 --> 01:55:16,866
Sit down! Sit down!

1061
01:55:21,787 --> 01:55:25,083
Mr Cole,
give this man my share of food.

1062
01:55:52,989 --> 01:55:56,159
(Christian's voice over) I am committed
to a desperate enterprise.

1063
01:55:56,451 --> 01:55:58,078
I have said farewell

1064
01:55:58,161 --> 01:56:01,164
to everything I've been accustomed
to regard as indispensable.

1065
01:56:01,456 --> 01:56:03,751
But I suppose
I have found freedom.

1066
01:56:11,343 --> 01:56:13,344
So you've found
freedom, have you?

1067
01:56:13,636 --> 01:56:16,807
Freedom, retribution,
that's what you want.

1068
01:56:17,767 --> 01:56:19,518
Isn't that
why you gave him your compass?

1069
01:56:19,643 --> 01:56:20,937
I wanted to give him a chance.

1070
01:56:21,104 --> 01:56:22,855
A chance to survive
so he'll come after us again.

1071
01:56:23,022 --> 01:56:26,318
How can he come after us?
He'll be marooned on some island.

1072
01:56:26,485 --> 01:56:30,447
I only wish to God I'd given
him muskets. Now get out.

1073
01:56:42,794 --> 01:56:45,923
(Christian's voice over) At least
ten times we have touched land.

1074
01:56:46,048 --> 01:56:49,009
Only to find either barren rocks
or hostile inhabitants.

1075
01:56:49,218 --> 01:56:52,221
And once nearly ran
a foul of an English frigate.

1076
01:56:52,430 --> 01:56:55,892
Our stores are low.
The spirit of the men, even lower.

1077
01:56:57,602 --> 01:57:00,064
His royal highness
woken up at last, has he?

1078
01:57:00,230 --> 01:57:02,232
Given you a rest, has he, darling?

1079
01:57:05,444 --> 01:57:07,029
Fletcher wants you.

1080
01:57:15,164 --> 01:57:17,832
Ned, I found it. Listen.

1081
01:57:19,918 --> 01:57:21,086
Where is it?

1082
01:57:21,337 --> 01:57:24,549
July 2nd, we discovered an island,
seeming uninhabited. It was

1083
01:57:24,632 --> 01:57:28,553
well timbered. But we did not linger
for we could find no anchorage.

1084
01:57:28,636 --> 01:57:29,595
That's perfect.

1085
01:57:29,887 --> 01:57:33,224
Every ship in the Royal Navy has a
copy of that book and those charts.

1086
01:57:33,308 --> 01:57:34,726
They never drew it on the charts.

1087
01:57:34,852 --> 01:57:37,480
All they give is a latitude,
25 degrees south.

1088
01:57:37,855 --> 01:57:41,400
Now it seems to me, all we have to do
is simply sail along this line of latitude.

1089
01:57:41,567 --> 01:57:42,986
We'll find the island.
Somewhere.

1090
01:57:43,111 --> 01:57:47,741
And if we don't? These men need a
home, Fletcher. They've mutinied once.

1091
01:57:48,491 --> 01:57:51,119
Oh, they'll have a home.
Pitcairn's Island.

1092
01:57:51,704 --> 01:57:52,872
They'd better.

1093
01:58:02,632 --> 01:58:06,386
(Bligh's voice over) I can
no longer write for lack of strength.

1094
01:58:06,511 --> 01:58:10,099
Commend me to your parents
and our loving daughters.

1095
01:58:11,684 --> 01:58:16,857
Mr Bligh,
when my spirit is gone,

1096
01:58:17,899 --> 01:58:21,653
there will be nothing
but flesh remaining.

1097
01:58:24,490 --> 01:58:32,165
I beg you use that poor flesh
to save the others.

1098
01:58:32,624 --> 01:58:36,795
No, no, Mr Nelson.
We're civilised men not savages.

1099
01:58:37,755 --> 01:58:41,634
And as civilised men we shall die.
Have no fear.

1100
01:59:21,511 --> 01:59:25,432
Sir, we'd like a word.
We've had it up to here.

1101
01:59:25,557 --> 01:59:29,270
There is no island.
We want to turn back to Tahiti.

1102
01:59:32,189 --> 01:59:33,358
And who'll navigate?

1103
01:59:34,734 --> 01:59:36,528
You. You're the navigator.

1104
01:59:41,534 --> 01:59:42,993
I'll navigate.

1105
01:59:50,418 --> 01:59:52,879
This ship's going to Pitcairn's Island.

1106
02:00:47,022 --> 02:00:47,940
Sir!

1107
02:00:51,820 --> 02:00:52,862
Sir!

1108
02:00:59,161 --> 02:01:00,162
Smith.

1109
02:01:00,955 --> 02:01:02,248
It's land.

1110
02:01:02,456 --> 02:01:05,168
- What?
- I think it's land.

1111
02:01:10,757 --> 02:01:13,677
Mr Cole, you'll hoist the Jack.

1112
02:01:15,262 --> 02:01:17,848
It's not proper
to land without identification.

1113
02:01:35,576 --> 02:01:37,829
(Cries and shouts of natives)

1114
02:02:21,210 --> 02:02:22,586
Oh. God.

1115
02:02:28,217 --> 02:02:35,643
Sir. I am Lieutenant William Bligh.
I'm a British naval officer

1116
02:02:37,269 --> 02:02:40,398
and I have
to report an act of piracy.

1117
02:02:47,990 --> 02:02:50,158
(Native talking in Tahitian)

1118
02:02:53,454 --> 02:02:55,247
(Christian answers in Tahitian)

1119
02:02:55,623 --> 02:02:57,625
(Native talking in Tahitian)

1120
02:02:58,209 --> 02:03:00,712
We've found it.
We've found it, Ned.

1121
02:03:03,215 --> 02:03:04,466
It's our island.

1122
02:03:05,718 --> 02:03:08,721
(Cries of excitement
from mutineers and natives)

1123
02:03:34,583 --> 02:03:36,377
We could easily have missed it.

1124
02:03:40,006 --> 02:03:41,006
Yes.

1125
02:05:40,847 --> 02:05:44,185
We'll never get off this island now,
will we sir?

1126
02:05:44,435 --> 02:05:46,353
Never see England again.

1127
02:05:52,777 --> 02:05:58,950
This court finds that the seizure of
His Majesty's armed vessel, Bounty,

1128
02:05:59,202 --> 02:06:05,417
was an act of mutiny by Fletcher
Christian and others of her crew.

1129
02:06:06,459 --> 02:06:12,966
And that her captain, Lieutenant William
Bligh, is in the opinion of this court,

1130
02:06:13,216 --> 02:06:16,970
to be exonerated
of all blame on this occasion.

1131
02:06:18,222 --> 02:06:24,187
Indeed, in the matter of his command
of the Bounty's open launch,

1132
02:06:24,563 --> 02:06:30,653
we commend Lieutenant Bligh for his
courage and exemplary seamanship.

1133
02:06:33,156 --> 02:06:35,532
Will you please
come forward Lieutenant?

1134
02:06:49,465 --> 02:06:54,846
My Lord. Thank you.
