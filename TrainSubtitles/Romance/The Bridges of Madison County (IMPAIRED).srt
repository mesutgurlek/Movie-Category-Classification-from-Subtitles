00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,730
Michael, if I could just get
you to sign this right...

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,967
Whoops.

5
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,246
Here, which gives you the
contents of the safe deposit box.

6
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,087
Fine. Thank you. And this
one, which clears the bank...

BETTY: It's kind of exciting, huh?

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,449
Maybe we'll find out that your
mother had secret millions.

11

Why don't we get started?
Your mother is interred...

12
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,601
at the Cedar Heights Funeral Home
until arrangements can be made.

13
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,246
I thought it was arranged.

14
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,488
- Well, there's a problem.
- What problem?

15
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,770
Well, your mother left explicit
instructions to be cremated.

16
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,007
- Cremated?
- Ew.

17
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,602
- I don't understand it either.
- When did she decide this?

18
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,531
Oh, apparently just
before her death.

19
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,566
- I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
- Lots of people do.

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,362
Nobody in my family did. Dad
bought plots at Prairie Hills...

21
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,130
one for him, one for Mom.

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,728
- The will clearly states...
- I don't care what it says.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,369
Maybe Mom was delirious. Maybe she
didn't know what she was saying.

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,049
If she wanted to be cremated, why the
hell did she let Dad buy two plots, huh?

25
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,163
She was very specific.

26
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,241
She wanted her ashes to be
thrown off Roseman Bridge.

27
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,204
- What?!
- Bizarre!

28
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,244
Mr. Peterson, are you
sure Mom wrote all this?

29
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,206
It was notarized and witnessed
by Mrs. Lucy Delaney.

30
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,607
- Maybe you could ask her.
- Who the hell is she?

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,848
I remember her, I just don't...

32
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,770
I don't care if it's legal. We're
not cremating her and throwing...

33
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,408
her ashes off some bridge
where we can't visit her...

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,251
because she'll be blown all over!

35
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,720
- And people driving all over her, dogs...
- We're not doing it.

36
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,402
I'm not even sure it's Christian.

37
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,723
Maybe it's an Italian thing.
She was Italian.

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,928
Doesn't matter!

39
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,925
Move on.

40
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,162
We can come back to this.

41
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,091
Why don't we open the box?

42
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,288
Michael, look at these.

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,281

Huh?

45

It was in this envelope from 1965.

46

She's not wearing a bra.

That's the Holliwell Bridge.

Oh, this is for the additional
acres he purchased in '59.

she could reach him through the
National Geographic magazine in D.C.
