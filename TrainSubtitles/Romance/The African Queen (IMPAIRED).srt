(BROTHER GROANING)

163
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:28,784
(THUD)

164
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:35,499
Brother. Brother. Dear.

165
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:49,138
Smite the Amalekites, O Lord.
Smite them, hip and thigh.

166
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:50,848
Amen.

167
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,810
Cold. Foggy.

168
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:56,812
Where's Rose?

169
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:57,897
(INAUDIBLE)

170
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,774
Rose, are you down there in the shop?

171
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:00,983
I'm here.

172
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,861
Bring me a nice, hot cup of tea.

173
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,197
I'm here, Brother, beside you.

174
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,325
I try so hard, you know, to study.

175
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,579
Hebrew, Greek. I've got no facility.

176
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:18,959
If I don't pass the examinations,
I shall volunteer as a missionary.

177
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,795
Rose, too.

178
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,590
Not comely among the maidens,
but she, too, can be a servant

179
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,759
in the house of the Lord.

180
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:30,346
Even for such as she,
God has a goodly purpose.

181
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,685
I'm going to put my books away.
I'm not going to work anymore.

182
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,773
If I don't pass, it'll just mean
that God has other work for me.

183
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,067
Thy will be done.

184
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:49,532
O Lord, if it be thy will,
let me distinguish myself.

185
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:54,745
Give me a call here in England at home.

186
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,998
Mother would be so proud.

187
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,462
O Lord, I've tried so hard.

188
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,938
(WHISTLE BLOWING)

189
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,620
So they been here, too, eh?

190
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,248
After I left here the other day,
the drums started in the forest.

191
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,877
Pretty soon, my boys was moaning
and rolling their eyes.

192
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,963
I asked them what the trouble was,
and they told me the drums said

193
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,090
the soldiers was rounding up
their people

194
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,218
and marching them off
and burning their villages

195
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,720
so they wouldn't have
no homes to come back to.

196
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,182
Sure enough, when I got to the mine,
everything was a shambles.

197
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,435
My boys took one look
and bolted into the forest.

198
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:46,398
The way I look at it,
they plan to make soldiers of the natives

199
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:50,236
and take over all Africa.
Where's the Reverend?

200
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,322
He's in there. He's dead.

201
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:55,824
Oh.

202
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,036
Well, now, ain't that awful?

203
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,665
If they'd up and shoot a reverend
couldn't do them a bit of harm,

204
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,961
- well, there ain't nobody safe.
- They didn't shoot him, Mr. Allnut,

205
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,338
but they may as well have done.

206
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:14,009
That's certainly too bad, miss.
That's all I can say.

207
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,764
- When'd he die, miss?
- He died early this morning.

208
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,103
Excuse me, miss. What I mean to say
is, what with the climate and all,

209
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,939
the quicker we get him
under the ground, the better.

210
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,609
If you don't mind my saying so.
You got a spade?

211
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,362
Behind the bungalow.

212
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,949
I expect he'd like to be buried
in the shade.

213
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,034
I'll tell you what.
While I'm digging the grave,

214
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,537
you get your things together,
all the things you want to carry,

215
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,955
and then we can clear out of here
in a hurry.

216
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,541
The Germans might come back anytime.

217
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,794
- Why should they?
- Oh, they'll be back, all right,

218
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,254
looking for the African Queen.

219
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,715
They'd give a lot to get their hands
on her, you bet.

220
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,049
And what's in her, too.

221
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,136
Blasting gelatin, tinned grub,
cylinders of oxygen and hydrogen,

222
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,723
heaps of things them Germans
could use. You can trust them for that.

223
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,016
The Germans.

224
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,894
See, I figure we could go somewheres
behind an island where it's quiet

225
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,731
- and we can talk about what to do.
- I'll get ready.

226
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,483
Fine. I'll be as quick as I can.

227
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,465
Let's go, miss.
Let's go while the going's good.

228
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,752
Pardon me.

229
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:36,151
Mind taking the tiller, miss? Come on.

230
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,154
- But I can't steer.
- Come on.

231
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,959
A little to starboard, miss.
No, no, the other way.

232
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:08,934
(SIGHING)

233
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,686
So far, so good.

234
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,272
Here we are, safe and sound,
as you might say.

235
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,774
- The question is, what next?
- Quite.

236
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,819
We got heaps of grub here, miss,
so we're all right as far as that goes.

237
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,530
Two thousand cigarettes.
Two cases of gin.

238
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,408
(LAUGHS) We could stay here
for months if we wanted to.

239
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,035
It's not a bad place to sit out a war,
then, is it, miss?

240
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:30,456
All the comforts of home,
including running water.

241
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,583
We simply can't remain here
in this backwater

242
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,793
until the war is over, Mr. Allnut.

243
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:37,504
Can't we, miss? You got the map.

244
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:39,381
Show me a way out and I'll take it.

245
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,300
The British will certainly
launch an attack.

246
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,635
The only question is,
which way will they come?

247
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,804
Maybe from the sea,
up the railway to Limbasi.

248
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,639
But that would put the Germans
between us and them.

249
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,142
Mightn't our soldiers
come in from British East, Mr. Allnut?

250
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,519
Yeah, they might,
but the war in Europe would be over

251
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:55,063
before they ever hacked their way
through that forest.

252
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,941
We're in a bit of a fix, miss,
no matter which way you look at it.

253
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,693
There's one thing certain.
They won't come up from the Congo,

254
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,321
not even if they wanted to.
They gotta cross that lake,

255
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,740
and nothing's going to cross that lake
while the Louisa's there.

256
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,326
- The Louisa? What's that?
- A hundred-ton steamer, miss.

257
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,536
The Germans brought her
overland in sections.

258
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:12,039
She's the boss of the lake
'cause she's got a six-pounder.

259
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,749
A six-pounder? What's that?

260
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,002
A gun, miss.
The biggest gun in Central Africa.

261
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,837
- I see.
- If it wasn't for the Louisa,

262
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,756
there wouldn't be nothing to it.

263
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,551
The Germans wouldn't last a month
if our men could get across the lake,

264
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:27,513
but all that don't get us
any closer to home, does it, miss?

265
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,517
This river, the Ulanga,
runs into the lake,

266
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,060
doesn't it, Mr. Allnut?

267
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:35,854
Well, yes, miss, it does,
but if you got any ideas

268
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,689
about going down to the lake
in this launch,

269
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,108
- you better get rid of them.
- Why?

270
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,153
Well, first off, there's Shona.

271
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:45,364
The Germans have a fort there
overlooking the river.

272
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,367
If we tried to pass under their guns,
they'd blow us right out of the water.

273
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,369
And then after that, miss,
there's the rapids.

274
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,788
A hundred miles of water
like it was coming out of a fire hose.

275
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,832
After that, why,
the river's even got a different name.

276
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,918
It's called the Bora.
That just goes to show you

277
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,461
they didn't even know
it was the same river

278
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:02,798
- until this fellow Spengler got...
- He got down it, I remember.

279
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:06,343
Yes, miss, in a dugout canoe.
He had a half a dozen Swahili paddlers.

280
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,428
Map-making, he was.
That was his map you was looking at.

281
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,347
- Mr. Allnut.
- Yes, miss?

282
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:14,268
What did you say is in these boxes
with the red lines on them?

283
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,396
Well, them, that's blasting gelatin, miss.

284
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,522
Is it dangerous?

285
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,732
Bless you, no, miss.
That's safety stuff, that is.

286
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,401
You can get it wet
and it don't do it any harm.

287
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,236
You set fire to it, and it just burns.

288
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,405
You can hit it with a hammer
and it won't go off.

289
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,240
At least, I don't think it will.

290
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,908
Takes a detonator to set it off.

291
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:31,535
I'll put it over the side, though,
if it worries you.

292
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:32,786
No, we may want it.

293
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,705
- Mr. Allnut.
- Yes, miss?

294
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:39,042
What are these long, round,
torpedo-like things?

295
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:42,754
Them? Them's oxygen
and hydrogen cylinders, miss.

296
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:45,632
- Mr. Allnut.
- I'm still right here, miss.

297
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:49,219
There ain't much of any other place
I could be on a 30-foot boat.

298
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:53,432
You're a machinist, aren't you? I mean,
wasn't that your position at the mine?

299
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:57,144
Yes, a kind of a fixer, jack of all trades
and master of none, like they say.

300
00:23:57,228 --> 00:24:00,772
- Could you make a torpedo?
- How's that, miss?

301
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:04,776
- Could you make a torpedo?
- A torpedo?

302
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,154
(CHUCKLING)

303
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,114
Ask me to make a dreadnought,
and do it up right.

304
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,407
A torpedo, miss...

305
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,451
You don't really know
what you're asking.

306
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:16,371
You see, there ain't nothing so
complicated as the insides of a torpedo.

307
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:19,458
It's got gyroscopes, compressed
air chambers, compensating...

308
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,668
But all those things,
those gyroscopes and things,

309
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:24,254
- they're only to make it go, aren't they?
- Yeah.

310
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,423
Yeah, go and hit what it's aimed at.

311
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:30,302
Well, we've got the African Queen.

312
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,928
How's that, miss?

313
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:35,849
If we were to fill those cylinders
with that blasting gelatin

314
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,809
and then fix them so that
they would stick out

315
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:38,894
over the end of the boat,

316
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,313
and then run the boat
against the side of a ship,

317
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:44,691
they would go off,
just like a torpedo, wouldn't they?

318
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:46,610
Yeah, yeah, if they had detonators
in the ends.

319
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,528
We could... What do you call it?
Get a good head of steam up,

320
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:51,490
and then point the launch toward a ship,
and just before she hits,

321
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,659
we could dive off, couldn't we?

322
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,828
Sure, miss, sure. Absolutely.

323
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:59,331
There's only one little thing wrong
with your idea.

324
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:03,669
- There ain't nothing to torpedo.
- Oh, yes, there is.

325
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:06,254
- There's what?
- Something to torpedo.

326
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,840
- What's that?
- The Louisa.

327
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:12,010
The Louisa? Now, don't talk silly, miss.

328
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,720
You can't do that. Honest, you can't.

329
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:15,681
I told you before,
we can't get down the Ulanga.

330
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:17,099
- Spengler did.
- In a canoe, miss...

331
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,767
- If a German did it, we can, too.
- Not in no launch.

332
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,018
How do you know? You never tried it.

333
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:23,188
I never tried shooting myself
in the head, neither.

334
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:28,276
The trouble with you, miss, is you...
You don't know anything about boats.

335
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:31,321
In other words,
you are refusing to help your country

336
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,740
in her hour of need, Mr. Allnut?

337
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,202
Well, I wouldn't put it that way.

338
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,913
Just how would you put it, Mr. Allnut?

339
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:44,376
All right, miss, have it your own way,
but don't blame me for what happens.

340
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,545
Very well, then. Let's get started.

341
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,839
- What, now, miss?
- Yes, now.

342
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,007
There ain't two hours
of daylight left, miss.

343
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,969
We can go a long way
in two hours, Mr. Allnut.

344
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,137
Uh...

345
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,639
I'll have to get
the old kettle to boiling and...

346
00:25:57,724 --> 00:26:00,308
Well, do so, Mr. Allnut.

347
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,822
"Could you make a torpedo?

348
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:17,200
"Well, do so, Mr. Allnut."

349
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,838
A little to starboard, miss. That's right.

350
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,299
Hey, you're doing fine, miss.

351
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:36,553
It's really quite easy,
isn't it, Mr. Allnut?

352
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:40,432
- Well, you gotta learn to read the river.
- Read the river?

353
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,976
Yeah. You see that
long thing over there,

354
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,605
looks kind of like a "V"?
That means a snag.

355
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:47,731
Oh.

356
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:51,443
Now, this choppy water over here,
that means shallow.

357
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:55,530
The Queen don't draw much water,
so we can go right over them.

358
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,866
Most boats would
get their bottoms tore up.

359
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:03,371
And when it's smooth and flat
like that over there,

360
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:07,501
- does that mean a rock, Mr. Allnut?
- Rock or hippo, miss.

361
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:12,005
But don't go bumping into no hippo.
Makes them awful mad.

362
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,758
This boat's only big enough
for the two of us.

363
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:15,967
(LAUGHS)

364
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:42,619
- What was the matter, Mr. Allnut?
- Feed pump's full of scum and rust.

365
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:46,289
She gets clogged up.
Kicking her starts her to working again.

366
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:49,376
I gotta act fast, 'cause one of my boys
dropped a screwdriver

367
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,044
down the safety valve.

368
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,046
What would happen
if you didn't kick her?

369
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,422
(LAUGHING)

370
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,758
Whole boiler would blow up.

371
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:00,095
But if we're going
downstream, Mr. Allnut,

372
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,347
why do we need the engine at all?

373
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,684
Boat's got to go faster than the water
or you can't steer.

374
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:09,980
If I was to let the engine die
going down the rapids, we'd be goners.

375
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,025
- Mr. Allnut?
- Yes, miss?

376
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,403
Why don't you dismantle
the safety valve

377
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,238
and remove the screwdriver?

378
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,699
You know, I'm going
to do that one of these days.

379
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,617
The only reason I ain't done it up to now

380
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:26,663
is that I kind of like kicking her.
She's all I've got.

381
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:00,572
(SIGHS) It's kind of hot work,
ain't it, miss?

382
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,073
(SIGHS)

383
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:04,910
I could do with a drink.
Excuse me, miss.

384
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,161
Oh.

385
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:33,521
- You going to have one, miss?
- No.

386
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,318
- What is it?
- Gin, miss.

387
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:49,537
- Something the matter, miss?
- No.

388
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:53,792
How'd you like a nice cup of tea?

389
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:57,045
I'd like a cup of tea.

390
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:17,315
Course, it'll taste a little rusty,

391
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,150
but then
we can't have everything, can we?

392
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:20,443
(CHUCKLES)

393
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,990
There you are.
I'll get this out of the way.

394
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,371
- Sugar, miss?
- Thank you.

395
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,081
Don't mention it.

396
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:47,429
- Have a bit of supper, miss?
- It's too hot to eat.

397
00:30:55,813 --> 00:31:00,316
- How long you been out here, miss?
- About 10 years.

398
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,901
And what part of England
do you come from?

399
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:04,529
- The Midlands.
- It sounds pretty, anyway.

400
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,740
Yes, it is. It's very pretty.

401
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:08,491
Ever get homesick?

402
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:13,038
It's Sunday afternoons I think of most.

403
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:14,247
The peace and the quiet.

404
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,665
(CHUCKLING)

405
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:20,253
On Sunday afternoons,
I was always sleeping one off.

406
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:26,217
- This is very, very good.
- Yes, it isn't half bad, is it?

407
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:29,721
- What brought you to Africa, Mr. Allnut?
- The Zambezi Bridge, miss.

408
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,098
A whole boatload of us Canucks
came over to work on it.

409
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:33,558
Don't know yet
what they wanted a bridge for,

410
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,393
both sides of the river being the same,

411
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:38,396
(LAUGHING) but why does
a chicken cross the road?

412
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,692
- I beg your pardon?
- Nothing, miss.

413
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,822
Sometimes I wish
I was back rubbing elbows, as they say.

414
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,949
You know, there's nothing
like the jostle and the noise

415
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:53,369
and the music of a Saturday night
for cheering a fellow up.

416
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:56,498
The rest of the week
I'd be taking orders from somebody.

417
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,793
Out here, I'm my own boss.
Anyway, I was, until...

418
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:05,340
You didn't see any crocodiles
in this arm, did you, miss?

419
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,008
Crocodiles? No.

420
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,637
There's no shallows for them.
The current's too swift.

421
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,932
I could do with a bath before I turn in.

422
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,059
I'd like a bath myself.

423
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,895
Well, then, I'll just go up in the bow
and hang off the anchor chain.

424
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:22,941
You can stay back here in the stern
and do whatever you have to.

425
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:26,820
Just so long as we don't look,
it won't matter, huh?

426
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:30,490
Well, how about it, miss?

427
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:34,244
Very well, Mr. Allnut.

428
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,037
That's the ticket.

429
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,195
- Mr. Allnut.
- ALLNUT: Right here.

430
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:54,699
- ROSE: I can't get back into the boat.
- I'll give you a hand.

431
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,327
Close your eyes, please, Mr. Allnut.

432
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,956
All right. I'm all right. Thank you.

433
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:32,714
ROSE: Mr. Allnut!

434
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,800
Hi. Sorry I woke you, miss.

435
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,593
What are you doing?

436
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:43,891
- I ain't doing nothing, miss.
- Well, get out this instant.

437
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,626
Mr. Allnut.

438
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:13,588
Mr. Allnut.

439
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,924
You may come in out of the rain.

440
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,100
Thank you, miss.

441
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:39,113
- Oh, miss.
- Yes, Mr. Allnut?

442
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:45,953
- I'm sorry I gave you such a turn.
- That's quite all right, Mr. Allnut.

443
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:50,458
- Good night, miss.
- Good night, Mr. Allnut.

444
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,954
- What a frightfully strong smell.
- What smell?

445
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:33,042
The river. It smells like marigolds.
Stale ones.

446
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:36,629
It does, huh?
Not a very good smell for a flower.

447
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:37,797
(LAUGHING)

448
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:42,301
- They're very pretty, though, marigolds.
- They are, huh?

449
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:46,597
- Mr. Allnut?
- Yes, miss?

450
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:49,122
The current's quite
strong here, isn't it?

451
00:37:49,123 --> 00:37:51,561
Yes.
We're getting near the rapids.

452
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:54,897
- Really? So soon?
- Just around that bend.

453
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:01,529
Kind of dangerous.
You better let me take over.

454
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,691
Here you are, miss.

455
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,541
- Well, miss?
- Yes, Mr. Allnut?

456
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,209
- How'd you like it?
- Like it?

457
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,878
- White water, rapids?
- I never dreamed.

458
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:43,965
I don't blame you for being scared, miss,
not one little bit.

459
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:47,009
Ain't no person in their right mind

I never dreamed
that any mere physical experience

461

- could be so stimulating.
- How's that, miss?

462
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:55,560
I've only known such excitement
a few times before.

463
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:57,687
A few times
in my dear brother's sermons,

464
00:39:57,771 --> 00:40:00,398
when the spirit was really upon him.

465

- You mean you want to go on?
- Naturally.

466
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:04,735
- Miss, you're crazy!
- I beg your pardon?

467
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,903
You know what would have happened

468
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:07,530
if we'd come up against
one of them rocks?

469

But we didn't.

I must say, I'm filled with admiration
for your skill, Mr. Allnut.

471
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,746
Do you suppose
after I've practiced steering a bit,

472
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:19,208
- that someday I might try?
- Miss, let me tell you something.

473
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:21,335
Them rapids ain't nothing
to what's out in front of us.

474
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,838
On second thoughts,
I wouldn't call them rapids at all.

475
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,674
- I can hardly wait.
- But, miss...

Now that I've had a taste of it,

477

I don't wonder
you love boating, Mr. Allnut.

478
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:54,869
Is something the matter, Mr. Allnut?
Tell me.

479
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,208
Nothing. Nothing you'd understand.

480
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,294
I simply can't imagine
what could be the matter.

- Yes, Mr. Allnut?
- All this foolish talk about the Louisa,

483
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,430
- going down the river.
- What do you mean?

00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,557
I mean we ain't going to do
nothing of the sort.

to go on, Mr. Allnut?

490
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,742
- The river and Shona.
- Shona?

491

You're darn right, Shona.

492
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:39,080
All it would take would be one bullet
in the blasting gelatin

493
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,957
and we'd be in little bits and pieces.

- Then we'll go by night.
- Oh, no, we won't.

495

After Shona, there's the rapids.

Nobody in their might rind would
tackle the rapids at night.

But then we'll go in the daylight.

498

We'll go on the far side
of the river from Shona,

499

- just as fast as ever we can.
- No, we won't.

if we was back in the slip at Limbasi.

We could pull this old tub out
and take the shaft down

and haul it over to the workshop
and forge it straight again.

Then we could write to the makers
for a new prop.

They might even have one in stock,

732

this boat's only 30 years old.

733
01:04:55,976 --> 01:05:00,313
Then while we was waiting, we could
clean her bottom and paint her up.

734
01:05:01,482 --> 01:05:03,941
Then we'd put the new
shaft in and the new prop

and go on our way

But this ain't Limbasi.

without taking the boat up on shore?

I don't know. I might.

739
01:05:16,872 --> 01:05:20,208
Means working underwater.
Could be done, maybe.

740

could you straighten it?

746
01:05:39,228 --> 01:05:42,688

Could make one easy enough.

Can't we go on the blades that are left?

754
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,169
No. The prop would be out of balance.

755
01:06:05,254 --> 01:06:08,840
The shaft would be all twisted up
like a corkscrew again.

756
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:10,800
We'll have to make a new blade, then.

773
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,852
- I'm going to go down there, too.
- Rosie, are you cracked?

774
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:04,979
The currents down there are fierce.

775
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:07,523
I don't want a drowned woman
on my hands.

776
01:07:07,608 --> 01:07:09,483
What will you be thinking of next?

777
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:13,613
Well, here goes.

778
01:07:35,302 --> 01:07:38,012
If my old dad had put me to
blacksmithing when I was a kid,

779
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:41,140
I don't think
I should have ever come to Africa.

780
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:44,227
I might have...

781
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:47,188
But then I wouldn't have met you,
Rosie, old girl.

782
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:48,522
(CHUCKLING) Charlie.

783
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:50,733
Now.

784
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,027
There.

785
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:55,238
Yeah, that's about as good
as I can get it.

786
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:57,031
Didn't take so long, neither.

787
01:07:57,115 --> 01:08:00,701
The blade will be a different thing.
I gotta make that.

788
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:29,313
It turns right enough,
but that don't mean nothing.

789
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:33,234
Question is, will she stand up
under a full head of steam?

790
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:36,779
Well, we'll get the answer out there,

791
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:39,949
but the Lord help us
if it ain't the right one.

792
01:09:22,576 --> 01:09:26,579
Looks like this old river got tired
of all the running and jumping she did

793
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:29,248
and decided to lay down
and rest for a while.

794
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:34,378
This must be where the river
changes her name from Ulanga to Bora.

795
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:37,214
(SQUAWKING)

796
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,343
Pinch me, Rosie.

797
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:43,179
Here we are, going down the river

798
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:46,640
like Antony and Cleopatra
on their barge.

799
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,976
(TRUMPETING)

800
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:58,069
If it hadn't been for you,
this couldn't be.

801
01:09:58,153 --> 01:10:01,280
- Don't you feel proud of yourself?
- Certainly not.

802
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:03,324
Look at the way
you kept the engine going.

803
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:07,203
Look at how you mended the propeller.
It wasn't me at all.

804
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:09,705
I don't think there's another man alive
who could've done it.

805
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:12,875
Right you are, Rosie,
'cause no other man alive's got you.

806
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:15,002
- Oh, Charlie.
- I'll never forget the way you looked

807
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:16,879
going over the falls.

808
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:20,216
Head up, chin out,
hair blowing in the wind.

809
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,718
The living picture of a heroine.

810
01:10:23,387 --> 01:10:25,721
Fancy me a heroine.

811
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:28,265
Charlie, you've lost your mind.

812
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:31,685
Lost my heart, too.

813
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:35,398
Shall we drop the anchor, sweetheart?

814
01:10:36,191 --> 01:10:39,985
If the river needs to rest for a while,
I suppose we do, too.

815
01:10:55,836 --> 01:10:57,503
Rosie, I got a feeling that pretty soon

816
01:10:57,587 --> 01:11:00,214
we're going to wish we was
back shooting the rapids.

817
01:11:00,549 --> 01:11:01,757
(GROANING)

818
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:04,760
This is awful. We gotta get out of here.

819
01:11:04,845 --> 01:11:05,845
(BUZZING)

820
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:07,471
- We ain't got no steam.
- I'm going in.

821
01:11:07,556 --> 01:11:10,599
- I'm going under the water.
- Yeah, that's it.

822
01:11:10,684 --> 01:11:13,102
- No.
- ROSE: But I'm being eaten alive!

823
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:14,770
ALLNUT: What's that you said
about being eaten alive?

824
01:11:14,855 --> 01:11:16,105
Look at that.

825
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:19,233
Get me out of here, Charlie!
I cannot stand it!

826
01:11:19,568 --> 01:11:21,026
(WHIMPERING)

827
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:25,865
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

828
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:29,452
Golly! Golly! My! Hurry!

829
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:32,371
(ROSE WHIMPERING)

830
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:34,748
Charlie!

831
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:46,469
Charlie!

832
01:11:49,598 --> 01:11:52,391
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

833
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:22,630
We got away from them.
You can come out now.

834
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:29,553
I'm ashamed of myself, Charlie,
acting this way,

835
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:32,890
but I couldn't help it. I was going mad.

836
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:34,099
Oh...

837
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:35,976
You're so bitten.

838
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:39,730
The bites themselves ain't so bad.
It's having them all around you.

839
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:43,234
I've heard of them driving buffalo
and native cattle stark-staring mad,

840
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:46,737
so they just run and run
till they fall down dead.

841
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:50,574
Will it be that way wherever we tie up?

842
01:12:50,659 --> 01:12:52,159
Probably.

843
01:12:52,244 --> 01:12:54,870
What are we going to do, Charlie?

844
01:12:54,955 --> 01:12:58,165
Well, if the river keeps straight
and deep and slow,

845
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,042
there ain't nothing much can hurt us.

846
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:03,087
I'll let the anchor out a way.
That'll keep us out of trouble.

847
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:16,141
How much further do you suppose
it is to the lake, Charlie?

848
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:18,185
Well, not so many miles,
as the crow flies.

849
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:20,271
No telling how many days.

850
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:24,149
All depends on how much
winding around this old river does.

851
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:28,237
(SIGHING)

852
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,447
What a time we've had, Rosie.

853
01:13:30,532 --> 01:13:31,657
(LAUGHS)

854
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:33,284
What a time.

855
01:13:34,244 --> 01:13:38,330
We'll never lack for stories
to tell our grandchildren, will we?

856
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:03,731
Nothing but grass and papyrus
as far as you can see.

857
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:06,066
Which is the main channel?

858
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:08,736
Don't look like there is one.

859
01:14:09,321 --> 01:14:12,156
What are we going to do, Charlie?

860
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,741
I don't know.

861
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:19,455
We can't just go round
and round here forever.

862
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:22,958
We can't just go round and round.

863
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:28,005
Well, if we get in there and the grass
closes in back of the stern,

864
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:29,965
there's no going back, Rosie.

865
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:34,678
If anything happens, we just sit there
till we go off our heads with fever.

866
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:36,889
I know it.

867
01:14:37,557 --> 01:14:38,891
All right.

868
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,102
You pays your money
and you takes your choice.

869
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:46,065
- That way.
- Put her over.

870
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,063
(GRUNTING)

871
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:51,046
We've come along by steam,
we've paddled and pushed

872
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:54,091
and pulled this old boat
along with the hook.

873
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:58,887
What we ain't done up to now
is get out and carry her.

874
01:15:58,972 --> 01:16:01,056
Looks like that'll come next.

875
01:16:01,141 --> 01:16:03,308
Hard to breathe, the air is so heavy.

876
01:16:03,393 --> 01:16:07,062
Yeah. You can't tell it from the water,

877
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:10,774
or the water from the land,
for that matter.

878
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:17,156
All the channels we've lost,
all the twisting and turning we've done.

879
01:16:18,867 --> 01:16:21,577
We may come out back
where we started, if we come out at all.

880
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:25,038
We've always followed the current,
what little there is of it.

881
01:16:25,123 --> 01:16:27,249
That don't mean nothing with this river.

882
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:30,627
This river's crazy, crazy as I am.

883
01:16:30,712 --> 01:16:35,466
- Charlie, Charlie.
- Sorry, old girl.

884
01:16:36,468 --> 01:16:37,926
Well...

885
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:43,015
The only thing that'll put the roses
back in our cheeks is to

886
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:45,309
get out of these reeds.

887
01:16:45,727 --> 01:16:46,935
(GRUNTING)

888
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:57,613
What I said about having to get out
and carry this old boat

889
01:16:57,697 --> 01:16:59,573
was meant to be a joke.

890
01:16:59,908 --> 01:17:02,868
It don't look like a joke now. Well...

891
01:17:48,456 --> 01:17:49,998
(SCREAMING)

892

The little beggars.

894
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:02,928
Pull them off me.

895
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:05,639
Oh, no, no.
The heads stay in, poison your blood.

896
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:07,933
Salt. Salt, salt.

Your legs.

If there's anything in the world I hate,
it's leeches.

900
01:18:42,135 --> 01:18:44,136
The filthy little devils.

901
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:19,189
There.

902
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:21,400
There, dear, there, there.

903
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:25,404
Fine specimen of a man I am, ain't I?

904
01:20:25,822 --> 01:20:28,448
You're the bravest man that ever lived.

905
01:20:28,783 --> 01:20:31,326
You just overdo, that's all.

906
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:34,037
What you need is a few hours' sleep.

907
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:41,712
There. Now, are you all comfortable?
Go to sleep, dear.

908
01:20:41,963 --> 01:20:45,507
When you wake up,
we'll be on our way again.

909
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:47,718
- Rosie.
- Yes, Charlie.

910
01:20:48,428 --> 01:20:51,138
You want to know the truth, don't you?

911
01:20:51,222 --> 01:20:54,016
Even if we had all our strength, we...

912
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:58,270
We'd never get her off this mud.
We're finished.

913
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,605
I know it.

914
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:04,860
But, Rosie, I'm not one bit sorry I came.

915
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:09,281
What I mean is, it was worth it.

916
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:25,547
Dear Lord,

917
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:30,510
we've come to the end of our journey.

918
01:21:31,137 --> 01:21:34,139
In a little while,
we will stand before you.

919
01:21:36,184 --> 01:21:38,435
I pray for you to be merciful.

920
01:21:39,437 --> 01:21:43,982
Judge us not for our weakness,
but for our love.

921
01:21:45,276 --> 01:21:49,321
And open the doors of heaven
for Charlie and me.

The rain did it,

931
01:25:22,827 --> 01:25:27,205
just lifted the old Queen up
and carried her over the mud.

932
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:30,542
We couldn't have been
100 yards from it last night.

933
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,919
Look. Look, Rosie.

934
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:41,886
Let's build the fire
and get the engine started

935
01:25:41,971 --> 01:25:43,221
and go right out into the middle,

936
01:25:43,306 --> 01:25:45,307
away from these reeds
where we can breathe.

937
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:48,476
Sure, sure.
We'll be out of here in a jiffy.

938
01:25:54,859 --> 01:25:56,109
(SIGHS)

939
01:25:58,696 --> 01:26:02,032
This air, isn't it wonderful?

940
01:26:02,116 --> 01:26:03,783
Yeah. It's like...

941
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:07,329
I know you don't approve,
but it's like a shot of gin.

942
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:11,041
It makes your blood race,
your face numb and your spirit soar.

943
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:13,668
I'm sorry I poured that gin out, Charlie.

944
01:26:13,753 --> 01:26:15,337
Forget it, Rosie.

945
01:26:15,421 --> 01:26:16,838
And just to show you
there's no hard feelings,

946
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:19,299
I'll make you another cup of tea.

947
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:24,220
(SIGHS)

948
01:26:24,305 --> 01:26:28,433
You carry on more over a cup of tea
than I do over a glass of gin.

949
01:26:31,771 --> 01:26:33,271
ROSE: Is it?

950
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:36,566
Yes, it's the Louisa,
and she's coming right toward us.

951
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,902
She must be doing a good 12 knots.

952
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:42,197
We've got to make a run for it,
back to the reeds.

953
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:45,927
She's coming right toward us.

954
01:27:58,524 --> 01:28:01,276
I thought for a minute they'd seen us.

955
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,028
They're going toward that island.

956
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:09,409
ALLNUT: They'll probably anchor there
for the night and leave in the morning.

957
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:12,996
Don't you worry, they'll be back again.
You know how the Germans are.

958
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:16,124
They lays down systems
and then they sticks to them.

959
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:18,084
Monday, they're one place,

960
01:28:18,169 --> 01:28:20,211
Tuesday, someplace else, and

961
01:28:21,172 --> 01:28:23,465
then Wednesday, they'll be back here.

962
01:28:23,549 --> 01:28:26,968
How long will it take
to get the torpedoes ready?

963
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:28,720
I don't know.

964
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:31,014
It depends on the detonators.

965
01:28:31,098 --> 01:28:33,391
We've got to devise something.

966
01:28:36,145 --> 01:28:38,688
I know what you're thinking, Rosie.

967
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:41,441
You're thinking of taking the Queen
out at night

968
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:44,402
when the Louisa comes back,
ain't you, old girl?

969
01:28:44,487 --> 01:28:47,822
Well, we ought to manage it.

970
01:28:50,743 --> 01:28:54,287
ALLNUT: There, that ought to work.
When we ram into it,

971
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:56,498
the ends of these nails
will hit the percussion caps

972
01:28:56,582 --> 01:28:58,500
and shoot the bullets into the gelatin.

973
01:28:58,584 --> 01:28:59,626
ROSE: Charlie, you're wonderful.

974
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:01,878
CHARLIE: (LAUGHS)
Can't put them in the cylinders yet.

975
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:03,004
They're pretty tricky.

976
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:05,465
We'll put them in
when we're ready to start.

977
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:07,008
It will be dark by then.

978
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:08,468
Do you think that you can do it
in the dark?

979
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:10,428
It's a case of have to.

980
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:12,680
You're quite sure
that they will come back

981
01:29:12,765 --> 01:29:14,015
with the Louisa, aren't you, Charlie?

982
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:16,017
Mmm-hmm. Dead sure.

983
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:19,604
Let me see, the lake's 100 miles long,
50 miles wide.

984
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:22,440
Louisa does about... About 12 knots.

985
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:25,944
That's 120 miles a day. Yep.

986
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:29,280
She'll be back here tomorrow.

987
01:29:30,741 --> 01:29:33,368
When she comes,
we'll be ready for her.

988
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:44,796
Charlie, let's make the Queen
as clean as we can,

989
01:29:45,381 --> 01:29:47,423
scrub her decks and polish her brass.

990
01:29:47,508 --> 01:29:49,717
Sure. She ought to look her best,

991
01:29:49,802 --> 01:29:52,595
representing, as she does,
the Royal Navy.

992
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:02,772
- You know, Rosie, I've been thinking.
- Yes, Charlie?

993
01:30:05,568 --> 01:30:07,777
Now, there ain't no use
of us both going to do it.

994
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:11,072
Now that I've had time to study it,
I can plainly see it's a one-man job.

995
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:13,283
You couldn't be more right,
Charlie dear.

996
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:15,159
Well now, Rosie,
I'm glad you agree with me.

997
01:30:15,244 --> 01:30:17,370
When the time comes,
I'll put you off on the east shore.

998
01:30:17,454 --> 01:30:19,581
You'll wait there for me
while I attend to the Louisa.

999
01:30:19,665 --> 01:30:21,791
Certainly not.
You're the one to be put ashore.

1000
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:23,001
- Me?
- This whole thing

1001
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:25,878
was my idea, wasn't it?
I'm the logical one to carry it out.

1002
01:30:25,963 --> 01:30:28,965
Why, Rosie, I'm surprised at you!
You're a very sensible woman as a rule.

1003
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:30,717
Now, we won't have any more talk
along those lines.

1004
01:30:30,801 --> 01:30:32,802
Now, look here, Charlie Allnut,
I can manage this boat

1005
01:30:32,886 --> 01:30:34,554
every bit as well as you can
and you know it.

1006
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:36,598
Rosie, you're cracked.

1007
01:30:36,682 --> 01:30:39,058
Didn't I steer going down the rapids?

1008
01:30:39,143 --> 01:30:41,269
You steer well enough, but you
don't know nothing about the engine.

1009
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:43,563
Suppose she broke down on you
out there? Wouldn't you look foolish?

1010
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:45,607
Now, me,
I'd just walk back from the tiller

1011
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:47,442
and do a thing or two to that old engine.

1012
01:30:47,526 --> 01:30:51,029
You know, spit on her, kick her in the
slats and she'd go right to work again.

1013
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:55,033
She knows who's boss, all right,
you bet that old engine does.

1014
01:30:55,117 --> 01:30:59,037
- I suppose you're right.
- Well, now, that's all settled.

1015
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:01,205
I'll dive off a second before the crash

1016
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,249
and swim over to where
you'll be waiting on the east shore

1017
01:31:03,334 --> 01:31:04,876
and we'll be off to Kenya together.

1018
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,837
No, I meant it may be necessary
for you to come along.

1019
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:09,464
Come along? What do you mean?

1020
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:11,966
Didn't we just agree
this was a one-man job?

1021
01:31:12,051 --> 01:31:15,637
But you convinced me that it isn't,
so now it's settled. We'll go together.

1022
01:31:15,721 --> 01:31:19,766
Oh, no, we won't.
You'll wait for me on the east shore.

1023
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:22,185
Who do you think you are,
ordering me about?

1024
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:24,354
I'm the captain, that's who.

1025
01:31:24,438 --> 01:31:26,648
And I ain't taking you along.
You'd only be in my way.

1026
01:31:26,732 --> 01:31:29,942
I suppose I was in your way
going down the rapids.

1027
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:33,029
Then what you said to me
back there on the river was a lie

1028
01:31:33,113 --> 01:31:36,157
about how you never
could have done it alone

1029
01:31:36,241 --> 01:31:40,078
and how you'd lost your heart
and everything.

1030
01:31:40,162 --> 01:31:41,621
You liar.

1031
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:48,086
Oh, Charlie,
we're having our first quarrel.

1032
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,214
Rosie.

1033
01:31:51,465 --> 01:31:54,676
It's only that
I just can't bear the thought of...

1034
01:31:55,761 --> 01:31:57,512
Well, what I mean is,
suppose something should happen,

1035
01:31:57,596 --> 01:31:59,222
not that anything will, but...

1036
01:31:59,306 --> 01:32:01,599
Don't you understand, Charlie?

1037
01:32:02,393 --> 01:32:05,603
I wouldn't want to go on to Kenya
without you.

1038
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:10,650
Oh, Rosie. All right.

1039
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,570
It'll be you at the tiller
and me at the engine,

1040
01:32:14,655 --> 01:32:17,073
just like it was from the start.

1041
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:23,162
And there's the Louisa, right on time.

1042
01:32:57,030 --> 01:33:00,825
It's blowing up a bit.
We'd better get started, all right?

1043
01:34:03,347 --> 01:34:08,059
Charlie. Charlie, I can't steer.
It's hard to steer.

1044
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:11,729
Too much water in the bow.
Screw's out of the water half the time.

1045
01:34:15,609 --> 01:34:18,903
We've got to get her nose up
or we'll be in trouble.

1046
01:34:25,828 --> 01:34:27,870
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

1047
01:34:47,766 --> 01:34:49,600
Rosie, we're sinking.

1048
01:35:31,602 --> 01:35:32,768
Rosie!

1049
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:37,648

OFFICER: What is your nationality?

1052
01:35:45,866 --> 01:35:49,911
French? Belgian? British?

1053
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:52,705
- ALLNUT: Yeah.
- Yes, what?

1054
01:35:54,124 --> 01:35:57,043
- ALLNUT: British.
- What were you doing on the island?

1055
01:35:58,045 --> 01:35:59,086
Oh...

1056
01:35:59,171 --> 01:36:00,338
Fishing.

1057
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:04,091
You are aware that the punishment
for giving false testimony

1058
01:36:04,176 --> 01:36:07,470
before this court is death by hanging?

1059
01:36:07,554 --> 01:36:09,096
Who cares?

1060
01:36:09,181 --> 01:36:11,682
What were you doing on the island?

1061
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:15,478
- I was fishing.
- How did you get there?

1062
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:17,939
I swam.

1063
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:19,690
OFFICER: Do you know
that you are in an area

1064
01:36:19,775 --> 01:36:22,109
prohibited to all
but members of the forces

Who cares?

1067
01:36:27,032 --> 01:36:29,158
You are accused of being a spy

1068
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:32,244
in the service
of the British Armed Forces.

1069
01:36:32,329 --> 01:36:37,041
Have you anything to say that might lead
this court to believe otherwise?

1070
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:39,335
I told you I was fishing.

(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1072

The court sentences you
to death by hanging.

Sentence to be carried out immediately.

Who's that woman?

1081

- I don't know.
- You just called her by name.

01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:48,154
I thought she was somebody else.

1083

- I ain't told him nothing, Rosie.

1092
01:38:18,477 --> 01:38:19,810
Silence!

1093
01:38:24,816 --> 01:38:28,319
- What were you doing on the lake?
- We were boating.

01:38:28,403 --> 01:38:30,613
Last night? In such weather?

1095
01:38:30,697 --> 01:38:33,407
We were not responsible
for the weather.

1096

As your fellow prisoner
has already learned,

the penalty for not
answering this court is death.

Stop that!

CAPTAIN: Order.

1100
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:47,254
Are they going to hang you, Charlie?

1101
01:38:47,339 --> 01:38:48,923
CAPTAIN: Frulein Sayer,
you will come to order

1102
01:38:49,007 --> 01:38:51,675
and answer the question of this court.

1103
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,302
Very well. Ask your questions.

1104
01:38:53,386 --> 01:38:54,929
What were you doing on the lake?

1105
01:38:55,013 --> 01:38:56,722
- We came here to sink this ship.
- Rosie!

1106
01:38:56,807 --> 01:38:58,307
- And we would have, too, except...
- Rosie!

1107
01:38:58,391 --> 01:39:00,559
Let's at least have the pleasure
of telling them about it, Charlie.

CAPTAIN: Sink this ship?

Don't you believe her, Your Honor.
She's touched, you know. Fever.

1110
01:39:04,106 --> 01:39:05,940
Stop that, Charlie.
We've been through all that.

1111
01:39:06,024 --> 01:39:09,026
I'm certainly not going to outlive you,
and that's all there is to it.

1112
01:39:09,111 --> 01:39:13,239
And just how, Frulein, did you propose
to sink the Knigin Louise?

1113
01:39:14,324 --> 01:39:15,908
With torpedoes.

1114
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:18,369
Torpedoes?

(OFFICER SPEAKS GERMAN)

1116
01:39:19,955 --> 01:39:22,748
Will you be so good as to tell us exactly

1117
01:39:22,833 --> 01:39:25,960
where and how
you acquired torpedoes?

1118
01:39:26,044 --> 01:39:30,172
- Mr. Allnut made them.
- OFFICER: How very interesting.

1119
01:39:30,257 --> 01:39:32,049
You don't believe me, do you?

1120
01:39:32,134 --> 01:39:35,219
Charlie, tell them
how you made the torpedoes.

1121
01:39:36,471 --> 01:39:38,889
Well, I... See, what I did, I...

1122
01:39:38,974 --> 01:39:41,725
I took the heads off
two cylinders of oxygen

1123
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:43,310
and I filled them up with live explosive.

1124
01:39:43,395 --> 01:39:45,479
You know, about two hundredweight.
That was easy enough.

1125
01:39:45,564 --> 01:39:47,481
It was the detonators
that took some doing.

1126
01:39:47,566 --> 01:39:49,275
And you know what I used?

1127
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:52,319
Cartridges and nails
and blocks of soft wood.

1128
01:39:52,404 --> 01:39:55,197
Then I took the two cylinders
and I put them in the bows

1129
01:39:55,282 --> 01:39:57,658
of the African Queen,
right down near the waterline,

1130
01:39:57,742 --> 01:39:59,952
so when we rammed you... Poof!

1131
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:01,662
And where is the African Queen?

1132
01:40:01,746 --> 01:40:03,664
She sank in the storm.

1133
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:05,332
CAPTAIN: But how did you get
onto the lake?

1134
01:40:05,417 --> 01:40:09,545
We came down the Ulanga,
the Bora, you call it down here.

1135
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:12,798
- That's impossible.
- Nevertheless.

1136
01:40:13,049 --> 01:40:15,384
But everyone knows
the river is unnavigable.

1137

That may be.

didn't we, Charlie?

- Will you grant us a last request?
- What is it?

1145
01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:16,487
- Marry us.
- What?

1146
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:22,826
We want to get married.
Ship captains can do that, can't they?

1147

- CAPTAIN: Yeah.
- Why, Charlie, what a lovely idea.

it'll only take a minute,
