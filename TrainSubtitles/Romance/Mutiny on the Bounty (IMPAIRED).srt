England's only an island,

Oh, Tommy, I'm afeard.
This ship's unlucky.

126
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,511
They've changed the name.

127
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,196
Well, I changed your name, didn't I?
Was that unlucky?

128

Oh, Tommy.

129
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,914
One, two...
Three of us in here?

130
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,878
My dog at home has a bigger
kennel all to himself.

131
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,999
I can see we shall be as friendly

133
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,712
Drop in anytime, Byam.
I'll be just 10 inches away from you.

- A pleasure, Mr. Stewart.
- I hope you'll like the ship.

Oh, yes, Mr. Byam,
the amiable Mr. Hayward.

137
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,199
- How do you do?
- Mr. Hayward has been two years at sea.

138
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,194
And a man who's been two years at sea
should know how to lash his hammock.

139

Yours looks like

All right. On deck, all of you.

This here Captain Bligh, sir.
Now, you being ship's clerk...

143
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,796
...would you call him a gentle officer?

144
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,191
If I was you, I wouldn't be
calling him anything.

145
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,989
Oh, no, no, no, Mr. Maggs, no.
Never call anybody anything.

146
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,597
But I do hope he is gentle because I'm
his messman and I frighten so easy.

147
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,955
It runs in our family, Mr. Maggs.

148
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,157
My mother was frightened by
my father before I was born...

149
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,311
...and I've been frightened ever since.

150
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,598
Do you know there's times when
I can hardly hold a glass in my hand?

00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,316
To lead up to it...

307
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,953
...ordinarily, the shortest distance
between two points is a straight line.

308
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,509
Uh, but this is not true of navigation.
We must consider winds and currents...

309
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,716
Yes. Suppose you considered
the problem.

310
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,509
STEWART: Yes, sir.
- Perhaps Mr. Stewart means that it's...

311
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,999
...like that lantern, sir.

312
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,676
We assume it should hang straight
down, but because the ship is rolling...

313
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,671
...it swings to and fro.

314
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,956
But by watching it closely...

315
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,917
You disagree with Byam, Mr. Hayward?

316
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,914
He knows the lantern makes me seasick.
He's doing it to break up the lesson.

317
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,392
- Stewart doesn't know his problem.
- Still, his original theory interests me.

318
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,598
Please, sir.

319
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,837
Proceed, Mr. Byam. You were saying,
by watching the lantern closely...

320
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,270
What seems to be the trouble,
Mr. Stewart?

321
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,949
Watch the wind, Mr. Stewart.

322
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,031
It's not there. It's there.

323
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,920
Is that the face that launched
a thousand ships?

Why, you ungrateful swab.

After I've given my all
for the honor of the class.

Byam!

330
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,394
It wasn't my fault.
He came behind and struck me.

331
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,028
- Is that true, Mr. Byam?
- I'd rather not say, sir.

So you want to fight?
I'll cool you off.

Get to the masthead and stay
there until I call you down.

BYAM: All the way, sir?
- All the way.

- Get below or go aloft!
- Yes, sir!

If you don't teach them, I will!

Look alive, you crawling caterpillar!

- Where's Byam?
- I couldn't help it, Stewart.

340

When the man looks at me,
I want to jump overboard.

Where's Byam?

Here, you use the ship's drinking water.
It would shrivel me wooden leg.

Did you ever hear how I lost my leg?

Well, I left my leg with

We came astern with a Yankee.

Up went our colors and our captain hails,
"What ship is that?"

"American ship <i>Ranger</i>," roars Jones,
and up go his colors.

"Louder, you Yankee pip-squeak,"
our captain yells.

"I can't hear you!"

00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,472
"Can you hear this?" says Jones,
and he lets go a broadside.

He apologized in French,

...we are at sea
under the articles of war.

420
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,550
Perhaps you are unaware
that the articles of war invest in me...

During the recent heavy weather, I've
watched you at work on deck and aloft.

You don't know wood from canvas, and
it seems that you don't want to learn.

Well, I'll have to give you a lesson.

Dartmoor Prison or the king's navy.

You may regret that choice
before this voyage is over. Your name?

The ship's company will remember that
I am your captain, judge and your jury.

You do your duty
and we may get along...

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,117
Who did that?

447
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,554
I can't tell you, sir.

448
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,039
- Mr. Morrison.
- Aye, sir.

449
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,794
- Report that man for two dozen lashes.
- But...

450
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,559
I done it, sir.

451
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,358
Pick it up.

452
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,592
Put it back.

453
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,513
- Mr. Morrison, lay on with a will.
- Aye, aye, sir.

454
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,319
Bligh, these men aren't
king-and-country volunteers.

455
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,596
They've been brought aboard
by press gangs.

456
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,399
In a week, I'll get some spirit
without flogging.

457
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,790
Teach them who's master
and never let them forget.

458
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,234
- Mr. Morrison!
MORRISON: Aye.

459
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,517
Before we see port, I'll make them
jump at a midshipman's jacket...

460
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,069
...even if it's hung
on a broomstick to dry.

461
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,279
Give this man his two dozen. When I ask
for information, I expect to get it.

462
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,314
- I didn't hear the watch call, sir.
- Why not?

463
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,789
Sorry, I was cleaning brass
for Mr. Byam.

464
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,234
That's true, sir.

465
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,073
Stretch this man over a gun
and give him two dozen lashes.

466
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,514
But I was responsible, sir.

467
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,035
Byam will be in charge
of the punishment.

468
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,510
Two dozen.
That's enough, Mr. Morrison.

MAN: Man overboard!
- Bring a line!

470

Idiot. I'll have to teach
my top men not to fall off the ship.

471
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,794
Mr. Morrison!

472
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,396
When you get him onboard,
stretch him with a rail to dry him off.

473
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,435
I can't stand it. I got to get water.

474
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,435
Get back to your work.

475
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,876
I wanted water for my knees, sir.
I can't stand it. Please, sir.

476
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,476
- What is it?
- This man left his work. Wants water.

477
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,473
Look, sir, it's the sand
worked in cruel.

478
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,632
- I wanted water to wash it.
- I'll give you water.

Mr. Morrison, keelhaul this man.

MAN:
Haul away!

- Well?
- The man is dead, Mr. Bligh.

482
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,159
Mr. Bligh, I've seen calms and doldrums,
but not one like this in 40 years.

483
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,630
- The men in the boats are worn-out.
- Not the way they're pulling.

484
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,439
- Put new men into the boats.
- Mr. Morrison, pipe the men.

485
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,716
Change the boat crews.

486

Dive in with your mess, lads.
The boats are alongside.

487
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,193
Mr. Byam, look at this bit
of meat, sir. It's alive.

488
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,996
I'm sorry, lad.
There's nothing I can do about it.

489
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,838
This bit of meat was
mined in a rock quarry.

490
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,232
- Here, I'll change with you, lad.
- Thanks.

491
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,951
It's alive, all right...

492
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,472
...but they're fresh meat anyway.

493
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,393
Mr. Byam, I'm reporting
these two men unfit for duty.

494
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,518
- Very good. You men are relieved.
BLIGH: What's the delay here?

495
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,036
You realize we're waiting
for these men to pull us into a wind?

496
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,510
The men haven't finished mess,
and these two are unfit for duty.

497

- Unfit?!
- My orders, sir.

498

If they can walk, they can work.

499
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,192
Put them in the boats and get
these other men out immediately.

500
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,031
Any sign of a breeze, sir?

501
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,838
I'm about at the end of my rope.

- No, and keep your hatch closed.

This is the cask with
only one cheese in, sir.

- Two cheeses are gone.

- What?
- Two 50-pound cheeses missing.

- Stolen, of course, sir.
- Thieves and jailbirds!

- What?
- A hundred pounds of cheese gone.

511
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,832
They'd steal canvas off a corpse.

512
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,276
- Strange. I checked the stores myself.
- Cheeses can't fly, fool!

513
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,237
They've been stolen, of course.

Stop allowance of cheese
until the theft is made up.

- Yes, sir.
- Pardon, sir. Back in Portsmouth...

...that cask was opened by you...

517
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,595
...and Mr. Maggs had the cheeses
carried ashore.

518
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,910
- Silence!
- Perhaps you'll recollect, sir.

There's nothing more
powerful than brandy.

I threw a brandy bottle overboard once,
empty one, off the coast of Madagascar.

Three years later, I picked it up
in a river in Portugal.

It had gone back
