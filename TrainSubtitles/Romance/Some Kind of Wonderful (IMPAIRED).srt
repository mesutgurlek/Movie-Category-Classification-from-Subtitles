on a school yet?

Well, uh, we're...
we're zeroing in on a few.

162
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,613

that he was interested

in a couple of art schools.

that's gonna happen.

what's he qualified to do?

a good head for business.

Well, uh,
the indications I've gotten

169
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:37,831
are that he's more
creatively inclined.

it's your mother's house

you really shouldn't
cut classes, Amanda,

even if it's just gym class.

it's incredibly nice of you
not to make me sit down there

329
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:57,450
with those guys.
I felt kind of weird,

330

you know, being the only girl.

331
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,587
I suppose it wouldn't matter

if you served out your
detention in my office.

I kind of had a better idea.

I was kind of wondering
if I... I wouldn't

have to serve detention at all,

I'd never ever do it again.

00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:56,355
Yeah. Nice.

480
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,991
And while we're on the topic
of the double-breasted
party machine,

481
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:01,160
congratulations
on your latest coup.

482
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,694
Yeah.

483
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:05,431
You know about Amanda Jones?
How?

484
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:08,767
You think I live here?
I have a personal life,
too, man.

485
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,436
How did you manage
to swing that one?

486
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:11,737
I don't know, Duncan.

487
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,139
You know, I... I asked her out.

488
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:14,606
She said yes. We're...?

489
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,845
Anytime somebody
from the outside
lifts a woman

490
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,881
from a gwat like Jenns, man,
we could all find
cause to rejoice.

491
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:24,616
I'm proud of you.

492
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,252
Gwat?
A gwat, man.

493
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:27,653
Punch her apron
one time for me, yeah?

Do you want me to kiss you
or feel you up or anything?

You wanna die young?

497
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:37,629
What kind of question is that?

498
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,299
Just sit here and shut up.

499
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,634
You don't have a boyfriend,
do you?

500
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:45,104
No.

501
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:48,274
See, a lot of guys I know
think that you're...

502
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:49,408
What?

503
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,944
Confused.
Oh.

504
00:31:51,978 --> 00:31:53,879
See,
but I know it's just an act.

505
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,381
Do you know how I know?

506
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,748
Enlighten me.

507
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:59,351
'Cause you radiate
this sexual vibe.

508
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:01,425
And if you wanted to
you could be
a girl like that.

509
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:06,392
Ray, this is 1987.

510
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,927
Did you know
that a girl can be
whatever she wants to be?

511
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:10,997
I know. My mom's a plumber.

512
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:14,366
That explains
a lot about you, Ray.

513
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,003
And I have an enormous amount
of respect for her.

514
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:19,972
WATTS: Just sit here
and act like you like me.

515
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,109
Okay. That'll be
absolutely no problem.

516
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:25,978
Hello.

517
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,247
Keith, hi. What's up?

518
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,782
Listen, are... are you busy now?

519
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,184
Oh, no, we were just talking.

520
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:34,252
Why?

521
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:37,656
'Cause I'd like
to borrow your car,
if I could.

522
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,925
If you... If you need...
If you have something to do

523
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,793
I could come back around
and pick you up
in about an hour or so.

524
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,795
But can I borrow your car?

525
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,031
Well, where are you going?

526
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:49,168
I'd like to give Amanda
a ride home.

527
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:50,569
Hey, by the way,
congratulations, dude.

528
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,338
Man, she's smoking, you know.
All right.

529
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,406
Thanks.

530
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,443
Is that... Is that okay?

531
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,378
I'd appreciate
a couple bucks for gas.

532
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:05,851
Well, sure.
Guess I'll come back
in about an hour?

533
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,719
It's just time.
Not like it means anything.

534
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,189
Thanks.

535
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,126
So, you gotta wait
around an hour?

536
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:17,429
(SIGHING)
If I want to.

537
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:20,266
Do you know how much damage
we could do to
each other in an hour?

538
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,303
It's kind of
a revolting thought, actually.

539
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,905
Really?
What's "revolting" mean?

540
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,540
Oh, my God.

541
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:31,910
Get your hands off me, man.
Does that mean
you want to come over?

542
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,745
For spring break?
Are you out of your mind?

543
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:37,149
All right, that's it.
I'm taking you to Aspen.

544
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,817
I won't take you to Aspen.
I'll take you to Chile.

548
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:46,792
Uh, well, I'm... I'm
I'm going home with Shayne.

549

00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,762

Hi.

553
00:33:56,235 --> 00:34:00,606
Uh, well, I was just
hoping we could talk.

554
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,141
Why don't you call me?

555
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:03,509
KEITH: Yeah?
Yeah.

556
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:06,312
Okay.

557
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:07,746
Oh. Why don't you go with him?

558
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,819
Okay. I'm... I'm sorry.
Uh, where's your car?

559
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,723
(STAMMERING)
Well, I'll pull around.

560
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:20,192
Okay.

561
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,795
Thanks a lot.
What?

562
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,431
Well, you made me
look really stupid.

563
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:26,898
I did not make you
look really stupid.

564
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,034
He's giving you
the perfect opportunity
to back out.

565
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,269
He wants to talk.
So, tell him.

566
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:31,403
Tell him you're back with Hardy.

567
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:33,038
I'm not back with Hardy.

568
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,306
Okay, then fine.
Tell him the truth.

569
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,541
Tell him that you used him.

570
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,643
I didn't use him.
Oh, really?

571
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,745
You didn't use him
to get away from Hardy?

572
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:42,314
It wasn't deliberate.
I was mad and he stepped in.

573
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:44,049
It was just bad circumstances,
okay?

574
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,851
Okay.

575
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:48,854
Regardless, the longer
you wait to kill it,
the worse it's gonna be.

576
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,322
You saw his face.

577
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:51,723
I mean, he's completely deluded.

578
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:55,194
Unless, of course,
you're really
interested in him.

No. I mean,
we just dropped him home.

he didn't mention anything

about our ancestral estate
in Scotland

644

how far are you going?

To the nearest gas station.

00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,550
Wonderful. How far is that,
Russia or something?

Don't worry about it.
You're young.

I wanted to talk to you.

Not about art.

Look, I'm totally cool
with the situation.

675
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:02,468
The truth is I was
looking for a way out
of the thing with Amanda

676
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,636
and you saved me a tough talk.

I'm supposed to
believe this, right?

678
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:09,374
It's true. I don't want
Amanda hating me.

679

I don't want anybody hating me.

So, I'd appreciate it
if you'd do me a favor.

you have planned for Saturday

I'd like you to
swing by my place.

Well, I don't know.

There's nothing wrong on my end.

You got
an inferiority complex
or something?

690
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:36,234
I've known Amanda a long time
and I'd like to
keep it that way.

If it's too much for me
to ask you to
bring her to a party,

to a party.

this makes me look good?

I've taken a lot of shit
over this.

That's why
I'm a little cautious

about it. But...

and she's fine with it.

You're going out
with lowlife
just to hurt me.

And you know what?
It's working. It hurts. Okay?

what a stud you are

Give me a little credit,
why don't you?

True, I invited him.
Not to beat him up.

805

what a good loser I am.

Hardy Jenns,
with two "n's." all right?

818
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,640
All right, that's it.
Get out. Go on, out!

appreciate this, lady.

Amanda,
your reputation's hanging
in the balance here.

823
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:26,217
You play me around
and you're gonna have
a real lonely year.

Just get out of here.

they have to accept you

Yeah.

with Hardy's people,

over there with them?

with you, twerp.

because you're false.

Her brother loathes her.

He'd never let her play
with his rep.

851
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,231
Amanda has to bring him.
What else can she do?

852
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:47,698
Not bring him.

853
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:50,201
She can't take the pressure,
she'll bring him. All right.

854

Now the party will go down
as expected, okay?

with her guy,
and we'll nail him.

01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:44,829
I wanna know what's wrong.

1112
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,596
Are you in trouble?

1113
01:02:49,033 --> 01:02:50,033
No.

1114
01:02:51,836 --> 01:02:53,276
Well, were you at
the bank recently?

1115
01:03:01,245 --> 01:03:02,980
You withdrew
the college money,
didn't you?

1116
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:07,784
Yeah.

1117
01:03:07,818 --> 01:03:09,086
Well, it's going back, pal.

1118
01:03:10,054 --> 01:03:12,456
Every last cent
of it's going back.

1119
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:14,825
You don't get this
close to something
and piss it away!

1120
01:03:14,859 --> 01:03:16,827
It's not going back
'cause I don't have it.

1121
01:03:17,327 --> 01:03:18,896
I spent it.

1122
01:03:18,929 --> 01:03:20,831
What did you buy, a car?

1123
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:23,133
Whatever you bought,
you can take back

1124
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:24,768
and you're gonna take it back.

1125
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,137
Dad, I can't.
I don't want to.

1126
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:29,006
I don't care what you want.

1127
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,208
The money's going back
in the bank and that's final!

1128
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:32,843
Look,
you're not listening to me.

1129
01:03:32,877 --> 01:03:34,912
I don't have the money.
I can't get it back.

1130
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:36,947
Look, you had no right
touching that money!

1131
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:38,815
I had every right!
I earned it!

1132
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:40,584
Where's the fucking money,
Keith?

1133
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:42,186
Dad, calm down. Listen to me.

1134
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:43,820
The money is not important here.

1135
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:45,055
You don't know what's important!

1136
01:03:45,089 --> 01:03:46,924
You don't know
what the hell
you're talking about!

1137
01:03:46,957 --> 01:03:48,458
I do know what the hell
I'm talking about!

1138
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:49,994
You just never listen to me!

1139
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:51,661
You only hear what you want!

1140
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:53,330
Will you listen to me for once?

1141
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:54,363
I'm listening.

1142
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,533
I'm not gonna go to college.

1143
01:03:57,935 --> 01:04:00,270
The money is gone.
You can't get it back.

1144
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:02,272
It's over. This whole dream.
It's not what I wanted.

1145
01:04:02,306 --> 01:04:03,974
It's what you wanted!
I never wanted it!

1146
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:05,542
I just didn't have
the guts to tell you!

1147
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,644
You're only 18 years old
for Christ's sake.

1148
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,246
Then I'm 19 and I'm 20!

1149
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:11,181
When does my life belong to me?

1150
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:15,719
Dad, listen.

1151
01:04:15,752 --> 01:04:18,622
I'm going out
with a girl tonight.
And she is beautiful.

1152
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:21,095
And everybody's
in love with her
and she's going out with me.

1153
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,161
Get it?

1154
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,475
See,
in the eyes of most people
around here, I'm a nothing.

1155
01:04:28,032 --> 01:04:29,799
And, so I don't
start agreeing with them,

1156
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,368
I'm gonna go through
with this date.

1157
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:37,274
I just... I wanna show
this girl that
I'm as good as anybody else.

1158
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,810
So, what, are you gonna
impress her with money?

1159
01:04:40,844 --> 01:04:43,147
Think that's the solution,
Keith?

1160
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,315
Dad, didn't you ever
have guys at your school

1161
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:46,350
that didn't fit in?

1162
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:48,885
Yeah, of course.

1163
01:04:49,186 --> 01:04:50,220
Yeah?

1164
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,590
Well, I'm one of those guys.

1165
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,994
I thought things
were going okay for you.

1166
01:04:58,595 --> 01:05:00,965
Yeah. Well, I like art.
I work in a gas station.

1167
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:02,967
My best friend is a tomboy.

1168

don't fly too well
in the American high school.

1169
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:07,437
I didn't know about this.

1170
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:09,573
Well,
how could you know about it?
You're my father.

1171
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:13,010
Jesus, Keith, how could you
blow all that money?

1172
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:15,012
Believe me,
there's a good reason
behind all this.

1173
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:17,381
You just got to trust me.

1174
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,883
Trust you?
There's a limit, Keith.

1175
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,651
How can you put
a limit on trust?

1176
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:26,923
Do you know any father
who would let his kid
do something like this?

1177
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,026
No.

1178
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:30,699
So why should I
have to go along with it?

1179
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,131
Because you believe in me.

1180
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:44,141
Listen,
I'm gonna replace the money.

1181
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:47,811
Think about it,
you know I will.
I'm not stupid.

1182
01:05:47,844 --> 01:05:50,580
I didn't work all this time
just to throw everything away

1183
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:51,681
without thinking about it.

1184
01:05:53,017 --> 01:05:54,384
I know what I'm doing.

1185
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,021
You sure?

1186
01:05:57,921 --> 01:05:59,123
Yeah.

01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:02,959
Okay.

ride your ass
about college, Keith,

1189
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,668
I'm not giving up on that.

listening at people's doors.

Yeah, you.

to tell Keith

01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:45,007
that Watts is downstairs
waiting for him.

1201

Well, don't get in his way.

1202
01:06:50,107 --> 01:06:51,841
Did he go apeshit?
No.

1203
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,210
Really?

1204
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:54,678

in kind of hurry now.

Thank you.

01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:06,356
He really didn't go apeshit?

1209
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:09,559
He's probably saving it for me.

right now?

I don't want to end it.

You have a lovely smile.

You should smile more often.

Okay.

more on the ball.
I was comatose.

Here, I brought you
something to eat.

Yeah.

you might be hungry.

Gee, thanks.

as skiing and doing your taxes.

1313

Well, maybe you can eat
at the next stop.

I'll drive so you guys
can talk." Remember?

I can't take these.

1428

You have to.

1429

I know you liked them.
I saw you wearing Shayne's,
remember?

1430

This is insane.
It doesn't make any sense.

1431
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,254
You shouldn't have
to borrow anything.

1432

You're too good for that.

1433

Why are you crying?

1434

I feel so terrible
for what I've been doing.

I didn't have to.

1441

You didn't.

1442
01:21:15,638 --> 01:21:17,373
So you won't do it again.

the crap out of you.

Well, if you wanna do that,
drive yourself.

sooner or later.

It's not just Hardy.
It's his friends.

I could beat

01:31:08,096 --> 01:31:10,065
Yeah, well, you're stupid.

1584
01:31:10,098 --> 01:31:11,667
I always knew you were stupid.

1585
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,202
Why didn't you tell me?

1586
01:31:15,237 --> 01:31:16,672
You never asked.

1587
01:31:19,374 --> 01:31:20,576
(CHUCKLES)

1588
01:31:23,546 --> 01:31:24,913
I wanted these.

1589
01:31:25,614 --> 01:31:26,915
I really wanted them.

1590
01:31:28,116 --> 01:31:29,552
They're yours.

1591
01:31:31,587 --> 01:31:33,055
You knew
you were gonna get these.

1592
01:31:33,088 --> 01:31:34,623
No, I didn't.

1593
01:31:34,657 --> 01:31:37,092
I hoped, but I didn't know.

1594
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:39,127
You knew.

1595
01:31:40,529 --> 01:31:41,964
I had a feeling.

1596
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:46,569
Well, how do they look?

1597
01:31:49,071 --> 01:31:52,107
You look good wearing my future.

1598
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:55,077
