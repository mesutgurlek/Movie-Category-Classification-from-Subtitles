1
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,900
Gimme a beer.

2
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:00,295
Frostier?

3
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:03,413
Charles Frostier.
Yes.

4
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,584
Georges Duroy.

5
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,375
With the Sixth Hussard's,
Algeria, '95.

6
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:13,122
Yes. Georges Duroy.
Yes.

7
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:15,707
You look terrible!

8
00:04:16,383 --> 00:04:17,407
Let me buy you a drink.

9
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,433
When's the last time you had a proper meal?

10
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,400
'Scuse me!

11
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,022
Champagne!

12
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,495
What have you been doing all these years?

13
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,112
I only just got out!

14
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:46,545
I'm hoping for better luck in Paris.

15
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,556
You couldn't look for a better time.
Paris is filthy with money.

16
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:52,900
Rotten with it.

17
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,142
If you can't succeed here,
you might as well lie down and die.
Yes!

18
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:02,000
Even the whores are getting rich!

19
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:04,798
And me, ex-soldier,

20
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:07,246
living on the Boulevard Hausseman.

21
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:10,596
Political editor of the
"La Vie Francaise".

22
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:13,837
We're going to be the newspaper
that brings down the government.

23
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:19,362
I'm working as a clerk at the railway office.

24
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:23,800
I don't have your connections, Charles.

25
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:26,190
Had to make money somehow.

26
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,800
And we can't go on looting spree anymore,
we're not in the desert.

27
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:35,200
Why don't you come to dinner.
Tomorrow night.

28
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,300
Come and meet my wife.

29
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:40,991
Well, the thing is, uh...

30
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:43,482
I don't have any evening clothes.

31
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:45,564
Well, here.

32
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,617
Buy some, hire some, come at 7:30, yes?

33
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:51,552
Yes.
- Good!

34
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:53,779
Georges Duroy.

35
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:57,277
What name shall I give?
- Georges Duroy.

36
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,467
<i>Mr. Georges Duroy.</i>

37
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,100
I am Madeleine Frostier.

38
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,400
You're married to Charles?

39
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:45,600
Of course.
Charles told me all about you.

40
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:49,757
Madame Francaise de Marelle.

41
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:52,597
Madeleine.
- Clotilde.

42
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,442
You look lovely.

43
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm Clotilde.

44
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:01,800
You can call me Clotilde.

45
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:04,400
Madame Pierre Rousset.

46
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:23,187
He's frail. Gout's going to his kidneys.

47
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:25,915
He'll become a member of the Academy
for the rest of his life.

48
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:28,400
And so everyone will be satisfied.

49
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:30,500
You're awful.

50
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,400
It's this knife, Duroy.

51
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:40,100
What?

52
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,400
He's not used to eating like this.

53
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,300
I believe you've only just returned
from your posting in North Africa.

54
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:51,400
You were in Algeria?

55
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:52,858
Yes.

56
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,400
Charles and I were first there together...

57
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,200
five - five years ago?
- Five years.

58
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,800
He was a little thinner then.

59
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:03,300
Where were you garrisoned?

60
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,500
I was garrisoned at the frontier.

61
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,550
Very edge of the Sahara.

62
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:11,100
I once heard a very foolish story
about the desert.

63
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:15,600
May well be a myth but I find it
rather romantic.

64
00:09:16,404 --> 00:09:19,237
I was told that the sands - sing?

65
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,107
Oh, it's true. It's an effect of the wind
on the dunes..

66
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:24,532
it makes kind of music.

67
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,507
And what does it sound like?

68
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:32,155
It sounds very sad and mournful.

69
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,727
At least it does to a lonely soldier.

70
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:39,207
Euw...

71
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:43,778
But how could you be lonely?
In there, the women are divine!

72
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:46,074
The women are ravishing,

73
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,300
and yet, I was still homesick.

74
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,200
Sand storms and mangy dogs,
that's what I remember.

75
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,627
You could run something extraordinary about this.

76
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,400
I think it would be timely.
- Timely? Why?

77
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,927
Don't you read the newspapers?
- No.

78
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,707
The government are trying to take Morocco.

79
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,714
Yes.

80
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,620
"For the good of the Moroccan people",
of course.

81
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:14,451
But surely, nobody wants war.
- That won't stop them.

82
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,180
No, but we will.

83
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:19,250
Think of it.
An eye-witness view.

84
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,500
A handsome young soldier
on the frontier.

85
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:24,500
Homesick and alone.

86
00:10:25,054 --> 00:10:26,400
His adventures,

87
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:28,200
his insights.

88
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,200
The diary of a cavalry officer.

89
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:36,500
What do you think, dearest?

90
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:40,500
What fish are we having?

91
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:43,277
Oh, yes, let's change the subject.

92
00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:45,012
I can't bear politics.

93
00:10:45,057 --> 00:10:48,817
Men talking about men,
fighting with men about men.

94
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:51,394
Bores me stupid.

95
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,000
What does interest you?

96
00:10:55,192 --> 00:10:56,313
Well...

97
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:59,900
I like enjoying myself.

98
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,281
What do you enjoy?

99
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:05,351
Well, I don't know...

100
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:10,700
Everything.

101
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:16,437
All right, you!

102
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,403
"Diary Of A Cavalry Officer."

103
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:21,578
I want the first article in the morning.

104
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:24,200
You realize he's never written a word?

105
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:27,162
I'll help him get started.

106
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:55,507
We'll write it as a letter to a friend.

107
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,869
<i>Dear<i/></i>

108
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,296
<i>Henri,</i>

109
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,272
<i>I'm sorry I haven't written for so long.<i/></i>

110
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:09,900
<i>It is almost a month</i>

111
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:11,492
<i>since I first set foot</i>

112
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:14,102
<i>in this glorious land.</i>

113
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:18,427
<i>I do not know that the heat
would agree with you, dear friend,</i>

114
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:22,877
<i>but I know you would share
my enthusiasm for the people.</i>

115
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:27,772
<i>If only I could convey to you
the true wonder of the souq.</i>

116
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:31,300
<i>The scent of cinnamon and saffron,</i>

117
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,450
<i>heavy on the warm air.</i>

118
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:35,729
<i>She was wearing a simple dress,</i>

119
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:37,900
<i>and a shawl against the sun.</i>

120
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:41,328
<i>The colour of...
pomegranate blossom.</i>

121
00:12:41,383 --> 00:12:43,326
<i>She needed no other ornament.</i>

122
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:47,790
<i>The simple perfection of her face
and the beauty of her smile</i>

123
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:50,700
<i>I cannot describe.</i>

124
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:54,500
<i>All I know is,
that with one look,</i>

125
00:12:55,497 --> 00:12:57,500
<i>and one look alone,</i>

126
00:12:57,632 --> 00:12:59,500
<i>I was hers.</i>

127
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,290
I like being a journalist.

128
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,489
I hope you don't think I'm going to write

129
00:13:07,492 --> 00:13:09,415
all your articles for you.

130
00:13:09,427 --> 00:13:10,600
No.

131
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:14,237
I would never presume...

132
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:16,827
I meant something quite different.

133
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:19,857
I know what you meant.

134
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:25,662
Let's be clear.

135
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:30,800
I have no interest in being your mistress.

136
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,102
There's nothing more boring to me
than an infatuated youth.

137
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:38,800
I know perfectly well that love
for you is an appetite.

138
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:41,000
Makes idiots of you all.

139
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:45,622
Look at me, please.

140
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,596
I will never be your mistress.

141
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:54,537
You understand?

142
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:58,737
Yes.
- Good.

143
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:01,357
Then we can be friends.

144
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,000
Real friends!

145
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:06,228
Now I can give you some advice.

146
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:09,207
The most important people in Paris
are not the men.

147
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:12,767
The most important people in Paris

148
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:14,807
are their wives.

149
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,737
Call on Madame Rousset.

150
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:21,757
She likes you.

151
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,419
Madame Rousset likes me?

152
00:14:24,432 --> 00:14:26,102
Not like that.

153
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,632
Never like that.

154
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:30,332
No.

155
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,500
Her husband values her opinion
above all others'.

156
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,645
One good word from her is worth
ten years of grovelling to him.

157
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:45,602
But you may very much enjoy
a visit to my friend Clotilde.

158
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:49,000
She's such wonderful company.

159
00:14:49,107 --> 00:14:51,450
And her husband is very often away.

160
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,250
If there's ever...

161
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:08,800
any way I can repay your kindness...

162
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:32,395
May I present Georges Duroy?

163
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,200
We're helping him get on his feet.

164
00:15:34,307 --> 00:15:36,342
This is the Comte de Vaudrec.

165
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,392
The Comte is our best and closest friend.

166
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,601
Duroy!

167
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:45,500
Mr. Rousset.

168
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:48,673
You remember Georges Duroy?

169
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,397
<i>"Diary Of A Cavalry Officer."</i>

170
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:55,405
Your article was a success.
Write me another.

171
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,588
Put him on a payroll, Frostier.

172
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,361
If you think so...

173
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:01,952
You'll get five francs for this article,

174
00:17:02,457 --> 00:17:04,522
five for the next.

175
00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:07,451
And two hundred a month.

176
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:09,397
Plus ten centimes a line,

177
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,793
any articles you manage to place.

178
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:16,357
Here.
Give this to the Chief Cashier.

179
00:17:19,343 --> 00:17:22,077
What's the matter?
Can't believe your luck?

180
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,400
Hello, I'm Laurine.
You're George.

181
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:41,887
Please sit down.
Maman will be down shortly.

182
00:17:56,613 --> 00:17:58,000
What's your favourite game?

183
00:17:58,296 --> 00:17:59,776
Tag.

184
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:01,330
Tag?

185
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,638
Well...

186
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:06,544
you...

187
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,191
are it!

188
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:24,247
Who's it?

189
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,652
You are!
- I'm going to catch you!

190
00:18:30,886 --> 00:18:32,400
Get Georges!

191
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:33,700
Tag!

192
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,800
Who's chasing who?
You're chasing us!

193
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:47,359
It is time for Laurine to take her lunch.
- I want to stay with Georges.

194
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:51,167
Well, perhaps you'll permit me
to call on you again.

195
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,228
Come soon, Bel Ami.

196
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:56,650
Kiss!

197
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:06,100
Bel Ami!
She never hugs anyone.

198
00:19:19,757 --> 00:19:23,829
I'm so glad you called.
- When can I see you again?

199
00:19:28,104 --> 00:19:30,637
I'll come to you.
Tomorrow.

200
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:33,000
You should come today.

201
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:17,784
Well, I hope you haven't gone
to too much trouble.

202
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,300
Would you like a drink?
- Yes.

203
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:28,500
Yes, I would.

204
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:32,100
I'm a bit nervous.
- So am I.

205
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,400
Do you think it'll take the both of us?

206
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:21,300
I'd like to do this again.
- I'd like to do this now.

207
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:25,900
I mustn't come to your room, you know.
Anyone might see.

208
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:29,647
I can't risk a divorce.
I would lose Laurine.

209
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,400
And I don't want to embarrass my husband.

210
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:35,600
He's a good man.

211
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,500
A love nest is what we need.

212
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,768
A little place where we can go to be alone.

213
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:52,600
From time to time?

214
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:55,877
<i>I would pay for it.</i>

215
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,233
<i>My money...</i>

216
00:21:59,508 --> 00:22:01,573
<i>to spend on me...</i>

217
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,608
<i>on something I want.</i>

218
00:23:32,617 --> 00:23:36,297
What you're reading?
It's a letter for my father.

219
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:41,492
Every week he puts on his best suit
and goes to the priest.

220
00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:44,082
And the priest writes a letter for him.

221
00:23:44,928 --> 00:23:47,082
And every week it's the same thing.

222
00:23:47,742 --> 00:23:50,014
Your mother sends her blessings...

223
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:52,811
Pigs have diarrhoea...

224
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:55,607
When you're getting married?

225
00:23:59,652 --> 00:24:01,837
My father's a peasant.

226
00:24:02,014 --> 00:24:03,877
He's never left his village.

227
00:24:08,385 --> 00:24:10,352
And he's asking me for money.

228
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:19,137
I'd like to see where you grew up.

229
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:22,662
I'd like to see you there.

230
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:34,717
Promise me something.

231
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:38,842
Don't bring your other women here.

232
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:43,465
I don't have other women.

233
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:45,957
All men have other women.

234
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:51,457
Not me.

235
00:24:52,507 --> 00:24:55,565
Honestly?
Don't lie to me.

236
00:24:56,114 --> 00:24:57,807
Honestly and truly.

237
00:25:40,198 --> 00:25:41,327
Champagne!

238
00:25:57,101 --> 00:25:59,734
Hello.
- Hello.

239
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,322
I was talking to your friend here.

240
00:26:03,454 --> 00:26:04,855
Georges.

241
00:26:06,327 --> 00:26:08,955
I think you've mistaken me for somebody else.

242
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,738
So I see.

243
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,635
Not so friendly after all, are we?

244
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:19,887
Now that you're not looking for a cheap fuck!

245
00:26:26,478 --> 00:26:27,681
Clo!

246
00:26:28,181 --> 00:26:32,090
Don't you dare touch me!
- That was before I knew you.

247
00:26:35,457 --> 00:26:36,901
Clotilde!

248
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,300
All you had to do was say hello to me.

249
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:01,032
Who are you to speak to me?

250
00:27:01,842 --> 00:27:03,900
Who am I?

251
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,000
Beggar!

252
00:27:53,154 --> 00:27:55,303
Duval.
- Yes?

253
00:27:58,797 --> 00:27:59,800
No!

254
00:27:59,817 --> 00:28:03,242
You still owe me forty.
I need to eat too.

255
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:09,647
Why don't you try earning it?

256
00:28:11,683 --> 00:28:14,000
<i>"Diary Of A Cavalry Officer."</i>

257
00:28:14,062 --> 00:28:16,300
Whatever happened to that?

258
00:28:19,036 --> 00:28:21,462
Perhaps you can get my wife to write it.

259
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:25,587
Perhaps you think you can draw your salary,

260
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,822
and she will do your job for you!

261
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:32,888
Now I - I brought you into my home,

262
00:28:32,892 --> 00:28:35,082
I fed you, I clothed you.

263
00:28:35,085 --> 00:28:36,220
And how do you repay me?

264
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,150
By learning to play Cap'n Bo-
I mean, My Go-

265
00:28:40,705 --> 00:28:42,777
You shut up, I'll write it now!

266
00:28:44,364 --> 00:28:45,986
You will, will you?

267
00:29:23,404 --> 00:29:25,465
There you go, Frostier.

268
00:29:48,802 --> 00:29:50,555
Did you really write this?

269
00:29:53,717 --> 00:29:54,839
Yes.

270
00:29:57,561 --> 00:29:59,827
You write like an errand boy.

271
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,300
Rousset shall see this.

272
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,657
Frostier!

273
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:15,042
Frostier!

274
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:22,390
Pompous idiot.

275
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,819
He can talk!

276
00:30:23,854 --> 00:30:25,117
Couldn't even write his own name

277
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,113
without his wife to spell it for him.

278
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,832
You know what they say about her.

279
00:30:32,449 --> 00:30:33,571
What?

280
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:35,586
You know,

281
00:30:35,852 --> 00:30:37,062
Vaudrec?

282
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:42,612
You shut your mouth!

283
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,917
You don't know her.

284
00:30:57,337 --> 00:30:59,037
Mr. Rousset regrets to inform you

285
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,700
that your services are no longer required.

286
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:03,983
Pack up and get out!

287
00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:06,057
You're on your own, Duroy.

288
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,542
No women to help you here.

289
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:28,900
Madame Rousset.

290
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:33,000
I hope you'll forgive me for intruding.

291
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:35,167
Mr. Duroy.

292
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:39,142
I wanted to make a gift to you,
these pears,

293
00:31:39,145 --> 00:31:42,600
I received from my parent's orchard
in Normandy today.

294
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:45,700
How very kind.

295
00:31:56,516 --> 00:31:58,700
Would you care to join us?

296
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,567
I would, thank you.

297
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:21,600
Will you eat a pear, Madame Rousset.

298
00:32:26,357 --> 00:32:30,000
Well, um... yes, I think I might.

299
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,000
Head of Gossip.

300
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,900
Head of Gossip?

301
00:33:36,856 --> 00:33:38,049
Ah, Duroy.

302
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:41,000
You remember my wife.

303
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,647
Mr. Duroy.

304
00:33:44,163 --> 00:33:46,449
Now, do you remember Madame de Marelle?

305
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,080
Of course.

306
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,630
Well, Bel Ami.

307
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,457
Don't you have a smile for your old friend?

308
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,363
Let's go in to dinner, ladies.

309
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:06,332
We have pages and pages of gossip for you.

310
00:34:09,128 --> 00:34:10,524
Madame Frostier.

311
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:12,265
Bel Ami.

312
00:34:13,002 --> 00:34:16,817
I thought you'd forgotten me.
- Impossible.

313
00:35:29,442 --> 00:35:31,287
I missed you so much.

314
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:33,252
Why didn't you come to me?

315
00:35:34,323 --> 00:35:36,400
I thought you didn't want me anymore.

316
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,700
I'll always want you.

317
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:53,107
I must go.

318
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:58,472
My husband will be wondering where I am.

319
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:02,300
My other husband.

320
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:06,600
Your rich husband.
- The father of my daughter.

321
00:36:13,747 --> 00:36:15,500
Will you lace me up?

322
00:36:16,496 --> 00:36:18,727
Don't forget to tie a double bow.

323
00:36:20,238 --> 00:36:21,937
Like your husband does it?

324
00:36:25,072 --> 00:36:26,373
Poor Charles.

325
00:36:26,778 --> 00:36:29,137
He won't live to see another spring.

326
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:33,610
Madeleine has taken him to the sea,
but it won't help.

327
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,823
Poor thing.

328
00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:38,200
She won't be a widow for long.

329
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,487
Thank you for coming.

330
00:37:07,029 --> 00:37:08,540
You're the only one.

331
00:37:09,348 --> 00:37:10,392
How is he?

332
00:37:10,822 --> 00:37:13,700
I brought him to Cannes to make him better.

333
00:37:14,021 --> 00:37:15,827
But I'll bury him here.

334
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:21,096
They're my favourite.

335
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,000
Thank you.

336
00:37:48,754 --> 00:37:51,700
You come to see me die?

337
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:54,184
No.

338
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,000
Just come to escape the city.

339
00:37:58,287 --> 00:38:01,800
Because I'm going to live.
- Yes.

340
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,182
I am.

341
00:38:05,903 --> 00:38:07,597
I'm going to live.
- Yes.

342
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:08,990
Help me!

343
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,688
I want to go...

344
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:12,700
for a drive!

345
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,000
You're not strong enough.
- Help, help...

346
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,357
I want you to listen to what I have to say.

347
00:41:11,384 --> 00:41:15,027
And try to understand.
Don't be angry.

348
00:41:16,144 --> 00:41:19,400
I only want you to know that with one word
you can make me happy.

349
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,700
You can make me your friend,

350
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,826
your brother,

351
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:26,977
or you can make me your husband.

352
00:41:27,848 --> 00:41:30,507
My heart and my body are yours.

353
00:41:34,613 --> 00:41:37,000
You have to understand,

354
00:41:37,505 --> 00:41:40,182
I am not like other women.

355
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:42,468
Marriage to me is...

356
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,949
partnership, contract between equals.

357
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:48,969
I will not accept authority,

358
00:41:49,214 --> 00:41:50,790
jealousy,

359
00:41:51,066 --> 00:41:53,257
questioning my conduct.

360
00:41:53,953 --> 00:41:57,800
I insist on being free.
- Of course.

361
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,900
You must give it more thought.

362
00:42:02,994 --> 00:42:06,500
It is an important decision for us both.

363
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:37,668
Clo.

364
00:42:52,724 --> 00:42:54,254
Just tell me.

365
00:42:55,233 --> 00:42:57,000
Tell me quickly.

366
00:42:58,857 --> 00:43:00,557
I'm getting married.

367
00:43:05,553 --> 00:43:07,172
Of course, you must.

368
00:43:14,409 --> 00:43:15,912
Who is she?

369
00:43:18,848 --> 00:43:21,515
Madeleine Frostier.

370
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:36,742
You've chosen exactly the woman you need.

371
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,650
Yes.

372
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:47,680
And you love her.

373
00:43:49,605 --> 00:43:51,161
Clo.
- No.

374
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:53,960
No. I'll be fine.

375
00:44:03,704 --> 00:44:07,366
<i>The government insists that it is
abandoning its set eyes on Morocco.</i>

376
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:09,107
<i>No, no, better.<i/></i>

377
00:44:09,164 --> 00:44:12,096
<i>The government insists that it's listened
to the will of its people </i>

378
00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:14,032
<i>and abandoned its set eyes on Morocco.</i>

379
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:17,900
Georges. The papers.

380
00:44:26,424 --> 00:44:29,345
This is so boring.
This endless to and fro.

381
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,067
They say this,
we say that.

382
00:44:31,072 --> 00:44:32,677
Yes, you're right.

383
00:44:33,065 --> 00:44:35,351
It's as stale as old bread.

384
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:39,682
Wasn't there a deputy? Who was it?
I know it's here somewhere.

385
00:44:40,528 --> 00:44:42,677
He bet his moustache
the government was lying.

386
00:44:43,217 --> 00:44:44,135
Sarazin.

387
00:44:45,377 --> 00:44:48,752
We should give Sarazin's moustache
a column of its own.

388
00:44:48,757 --> 00:44:50,308
Georges!

389
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:52,394
It's brilliant!

390
00:44:52,437 --> 00:44:54,303
That is brilliant!

391
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,617
Rousset will love it.

392
00:45:02,178 --> 00:45:03,689
I've been thinking...

393
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:06,794
the political editor

394
00:45:07,123 --> 00:45:09,225
of a leading newspaper,

395
00:45:09,443 --> 00:45:13,032
should have a more memorable name.

396
00:45:14,385 --> 00:45:15,786
Something...

397
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:20,058
a bit grand.

398
00:45:20,325 --> 00:45:22,713
Where are your parents from?

399
00:45:23,045 --> 00:45:26,239
My parents are from Cantelaux.

400
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,872
You remember?
We didn't have our honeymoon there.

401
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,506
Georges...

402
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,947
Duroy de Cantelaux.

403
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:42,508
No, it's not quite right.

404
00:45:42,776 --> 00:45:44,598
Duroy de Cantel.

405
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:47,225
Madeleine, I'm from Cantelaux.

406
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,828
I prefer that.

407
00:45:49,225 --> 00:45:51,364
No, no, no, listen.

408
00:45:53,454 --> 00:45:55,561
Georges

409
00:45:55,911 --> 00:45:57,534
Duroy

410
00:45:57,959 --> 00:45:59,769
de Cantel.

411
00:46:05,011 --> 00:46:06,755
Say it again.

412
00:46:08,734 --> 00:46:10,544
Georges

413
00:46:10,914 --> 00:46:12,035
Duroy

414
00:46:12,513 --> 00:46:13,635
de Cantel.

415
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,380
Madame

416
00:46:15,622 --> 00:46:16,744
Duroy

417
00:46:17,196 --> 00:46:18,998
de Cantel.

418
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:30,000
"Sarazin's moustache".

419
00:46:33,482 --> 00:46:36,000
This is exactly what we need.

420
00:46:36,705 --> 00:46:39,254
Originality of thought.
Print!

421
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:40,599
Sit!

422
00:46:58,038 --> 00:47:00,200
They're for my wife.

423
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:29,601
Georges!

424
00:47:33,172 --> 00:47:34,373
Oh! Thank you.

425
00:47:36,684 --> 00:47:38,506
You know how I love them.

426
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,049
One can never have too many.

427
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,872
The Comte was just leaving.

428
00:47:44,846 --> 00:47:47,208
Oh, not for my sake, I hope.
No, no.

429
00:47:47,217 --> 00:47:50,295
I have business to attend to.

430
00:47:50,548 --> 00:47:52,460
Thank you, Paul.
Thank you.

431
00:47:52,705 --> 00:47:54,984
And give my regards to your wife.

432
00:47:55,276 --> 00:47:58,952
I wish her better health.
You are too kind, Mr. de Comte.

433
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:06,000
That'll be all.

434
00:48:25,623 --> 00:48:27,120
What did he want?

435
00:48:27,592 --> 00:48:28,994
It's Tuesday!

436
00:48:30,438 --> 00:48:32,512
He always comes on Tuesday.

437
00:48:45,983 --> 00:48:48,482
And when are your politicians arriving?

438
00:48:51,284 --> 00:48:54,318
In half an hour.
- In half an hour!

439
00:48:55,245 --> 00:48:56,257
Yes.

440
00:48:56,607 --> 00:48:58,234
In half an hour.

441
00:48:58,524 --> 00:49:00,450
I invited  Laroche.

442
00:49:00,682 --> 00:49:02,667
You must pay special attention to him.

443
00:49:02,669 --> 00:49:05,700
He's going to be Foreign Minister one day,
I promise.

444
00:49:22,443 --> 00:49:23,845
Georges.

445
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,812
We are going to bring this government down.

446
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:59,759
I want the word on front page
of every newspaper.

447
00:49:59,762 --> 00:50:03,040
I want it on every wall.
On every shop window.

448
00:50:03,302 --> 00:50:07,663
I want every man, woman and child to know,
that this government is lying.

449
00:50:07,946 --> 00:50:09,607
Frostier can dig something up.

450
00:50:10,191 --> 00:50:11,997
What's that?
What?

451
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:14,360
You just called me Frostier.

452
00:50:14,566 --> 00:50:15,802
Ah, force of habit.

453
00:50:15,937 --> 00:50:19,800
Don't be offended.
It's easy mistake to make.

454
00:50:20,207 --> 00:50:21,800
How do you mean?
- And...

455
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,771
we should look into troop movements.

456
00:50:24,974 --> 00:50:26,138
Logistics.

457
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:27,287
Yes.

458
00:50:27,288 --> 00:50:29,297
Laroche, you can help us here.

459
00:50:29,332 --> 00:50:30,989
I know a couple of officers, who are

460
00:50:31,225 --> 00:50:33,075
sympathetic to our cause.

461
00:50:33,288 --> 00:50:34,965
You can talk to...

462
00:50:36,716 --> 00:50:38,857
Laroche will tell you what to write.

463
00:50:58,658 --> 00:51:01,734
Look at these exports to Algiers.

464
00:51:01,748 --> 00:51:05,545
Why are we going from shipping hundreds of tons
of grain here,

465
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,211
to...

466
00:51:08,592 --> 00:51:09,993
Look, look.

467
00:51:10,228 --> 00:51:12,690
Thousands of tons here.

468
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:13,819
Why?

469
00:51:16,738 --> 00:51:18,120
I don't know.

470
00:51:18,183 --> 00:51:21,800
To - to feed an army.

471
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:24,530
To feed an army.

472
00:51:33,777 --> 00:51:34,897
This is it!

473
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:37,389
This is it!

474
00:51:38,981 --> 00:51:40,927
Who is supplying the grain?

475
00:51:40,937 --> 00:51:42,977
Georges, that's the question!

476
00:51:45,205 --> 00:51:47,637
Georges, I need to work.

477
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,362
My brilliant wife.

478
00:51:52,457 --> 00:51:53,677
All right.

479
00:52:25,181 --> 00:52:26,795
Madeleine.

480
00:52:30,156 --> 00:52:32,544
Madeleine, slow down, slow down.

481
00:52:34,373 --> 00:52:35,494
Madeleine!

482
00:52:45,337 --> 00:52:46,458
Madeleine!

483
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:32,802
Look.

484
00:53:33,888 --> 00:53:37,199
The're going to invade.

485
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,326
<i>La Vie Francaise</i>

486
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:53,320
has found proof.

487
00:53:55,486 --> 00:53:57,287
Of course.

488
00:53:57,537 --> 00:53:59,558
It's Tuesday.

489
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:02,656
The Comte de Vaudrec must be arriving soon.

490
00:54:02,737 --> 00:54:04,617
Incontrovertible proof

491
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:08,000
of the government's true intentions
toward Morocco.

492
00:54:09,307 --> 00:54:11,300
We never talked about that,
have we?

493
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,000
Comte de Vaudrec.

494
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:15,637
Man,

495
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:17,921
who arrives unannounced.

496
00:54:18,195 --> 00:54:20,100
Who knows all the servants better than I.

497
00:54:20,205 --> 00:54:21,007
<i>buried...</i>

498
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:26,607
<i>deep amongst the dreary columns
of our trade finance.</i>

499
00:54:26,755 --> 00:54:28,141
What is he to you?

500
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:31,500
<i>Where no one will think to look.
- What is he to you?</i>

501
00:54:38,806 --> 00:54:40,628
Do you want to be the man,

502
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,464
who brought down a government?

503
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:46,243
Or do you want to be a fool?

504
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,000
Just waiting for Laroche.

505
00:55:43,111 --> 00:55:45,111
You know my daughter Suzanne?

506
00:55:45,385 --> 00:55:46,864
So pretty.

507
00:55:47,122 --> 00:55:49,057
And another for Bel Ami.

508
00:55:49,478 --> 00:55:51,572
It's what mamman calls you.

509
00:55:53,259 --> 00:55:56,672
Well, I have from time to time.
I hope you don't mind.

510
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:58,840
Call him whatever you like.

511
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,300
Our Foreign Minister!

512
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:12,509
Thank you! Thank you, my good friends!

513
00:56:12,562 --> 00:56:15,980
My excellent, hard-working friends!

514
00:56:15,984 --> 00:56:19,187
<i>'Coz I'm afraid I have bad news for you.</i>

515
00:56:19,528 --> 00:56:22,592
<i>Our work has only just begun!</i>

516
00:56:23,626 --> 00:56:25,973
<i>We have a great task ahead of us.</i>

517
00:56:25,976 --> 00:56:28,092
<i>Our achievements in government </i>

518
00:56:28,095 --> 00:56:30,907
<i>must dwarf our achievements in opposition.</i>

519
00:56:30,944 --> 00:56:34,707
<i>There will be battles.
There will be conflicts.</i>

520
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:38,497
<i>But they will be fought
not on the sands of Morocco,<i/></i>

521
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,946
<i>but on the floor of the Chamber.</i>

522
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,871
<i>My first act as Foreign Minister,</i>

523
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:46,770
<i> is to recall General Pertain from Algiers.</i>

524
00:56:46,773 --> 00:56:50,977
<i>There will be no Minister of War
in this government.</i>

525
00:56:51,621 --> 00:56:54,342
Hear this my friends,
people of France...

526
00:56:54,347 --> 00:56:56,356
I don't have to ask how you are...

527
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,901
I've been very pleased for you.

528
00:57:02,931 --> 00:57:06,603
How's Laurine?
- She still hasn't forgiven you.

529
00:57:06,794 --> 00:57:09,559
She calls you Mr. Frostier now.

530
00:57:10,154 --> 00:57:12,800
She's too young understand.

531
00:57:13,874 --> 00:57:14,995
And you?

532
00:57:16,305 --> 00:57:18,190
You made a good marriage.

533
00:57:18,466 --> 00:57:20,200
We all have to do it.

534
00:57:24,298 --> 00:57:25,943
And I miss you.

535
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:28,817
Our love nest feels cold without you.

536
00:57:30,183 --> 00:57:32,500
You kept it on.

537
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,272
I'm an optimist.

538
00:57:36,391 --> 00:57:38,787
<i>Morocco is safe!</i>

539
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:33,600
Come, play a hand.
Sit!

540
00:58:40,155 --> 00:58:42,150
Let my boy deal.

541
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:50,564
I'm warning you,
I'm on a winning streak.

542
00:59:10,476 --> 00:59:13,007
I'm more powerful than a king.

543
00:59:15,774 --> 00:59:17,772
Not as rich.

544
00:59:19,238 --> 00:59:21,500
Not yet anyway.

545
00:59:21,873 --> 00:59:23,774
In a mere morning,

546
00:59:23,777 --> 00:59:25,327
I empty the Chamber Of Deputies

547
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:27,657
and fill it again with men of my choosing,

548
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:31,757
with nothing more than words on a page.

549
00:59:33,074 --> 00:59:35,218
They're not your words, though.

550
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:39,653
Are they?

551
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,900
How's married life?

552
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:11,447
How do you get along with Vaudrec?

553
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:17,027
He visits quite often.

554
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:23,067
I dare say it's only fair, after all,
he does own the apartment.

555
01:00:26,275 --> 01:00:27,396
Duroy?

556
01:00:32,606 --> 01:00:34,501
Yes, he set them up at the apartment

557
01:00:34,504 --> 01:00:37,427
after he married Madeleine to Frostier.

558
01:00:38,611 --> 01:00:41,102
He married
Madeleine to Frostier?

559
01:00:41,382 --> 01:00:44,216
Well, he introduced them, and,

560
01:00:44,518 --> 01:00:46,367
then he paid the dowry.

561
01:00:46,627 --> 01:00:47,749
So...

562
01:00:47,941 --> 01:00:49,982
I suppose that's how you pull it...

563
01:00:50,007 --> 01:00:52,107
Vaudrec is a father to her.

564
01:00:55,932 --> 01:00:57,468
Perhaps.

565
01:00:59,725 --> 01:01:02,172
Why don't you go and enjoy the party.

566
01:01:02,177 --> 01:01:05,177
I'm sure the ladies will want to dance.

567
01:01:07,326 --> 01:01:08,727
Bel Ami.

568
01:02:47,038 --> 01:02:49,762
What brings you here?

569
01:02:50,756 --> 01:02:52,412
You were caught in the rain.

570
01:03:11,569 --> 01:03:13,807
No, I didn't come here by chance.

571
01:03:19,072 --> 01:03:21,518
I don't mean to frighten you.

572
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,341
I expect nothing.

573
01:03:25,607 --> 01:03:28,167
I ask for nothing.

574
01:03:28,506 --> 01:03:30,222
I don't even know what I'm doing.

575
01:03:33,164 --> 01:03:35,737
I'm sorry if I offended you.

576
01:03:39,228 --> 01:03:40,349
No.

577
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:43,743
No, you’re not offended me.

578
01:03:45,252 --> 01:03:48,109
But we must talk of it no longer.

579
01:03:49,591 --> 01:03:51,457
Shall I leave?

580
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:55,278
Shall I stay?

581
01:04:30,781 --> 01:04:33,192
Is there any hope for me?

582
01:04:48,435 --> 01:04:51,382
You are trying to seduce me in a church.

583
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:58,388
I've never h-

584
01:05:58,597 --> 01:06:00,472
had a lover, before.

585
01:06:29,971 --> 01:06:31,372
Look at me.

586
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:37,197
Does your husband tell you
you're beautiful?

587
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:06,000
Virginia.
Virginia!

588
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,840
Georges.

589
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:17,773
Whose arms are these?

590
01:07:17,978 --> 01:07:19,379
They're mine.

591
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:24,336
And whose lips...
- Virginia.

592
01:07:24,713 --> 01:07:26,054
Whose lips?

593
01:07:28,008 --> 01:07:29,657
They're my lips.

594
01:07:31,249 --> 01:07:32,479
Come on!

595
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:35,227
Get dressed!

596
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:40,552
When will I see you again?
- Please, leave.

597
01:07:40,699 --> 01:07:42,724
My beautiful Georges.

598
01:07:42,727 --> 01:07:45,184
My darling boy, please tell me.

599
01:07:46,569 --> 01:07:48,825
Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

600
01:07:49,716 --> 01:07:51,038
Yes, tomorrow.

601
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,761
Georges?

602
01:08:11,116 --> 01:08:12,236
Georges?

603
01:08:19,871 --> 01:08:20,991
Georges?

604
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,721
Georges.

605
01:08:25,905 --> 01:08:28,307
Madeleine will be wondering
where you are.

606
01:08:44,956 --> 01:08:46,000
Madeleine?

607
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:51,900
Madeleine!

608
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:02,717
Where's my wife?

609
01:09:03,033 --> 01:09:05,744
She's with the Comte de Vaudrec.

610
01:09:06,573 --> 01:09:07,694
What?

611
01:09:08,941 --> 01:09:11,007
He died, this morning.

612
01:09:15,507 --> 01:09:18,482
I have asked you here today
Madame Duroy de Contel,

613
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,007
to hear the will of the Comte de Vaudrec.

614
01:09:21,918 --> 01:09:24,042
The Comte has named you, Madame,

615
01:09:24,057 --> 01:09:27,107
as the sole inheritor of his estate.

616
01:09:27,745 --> 01:09:29,562
The value of which stands at

617
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:33,250
1 080 015 francs,

618
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:37,425
and 29 centimes.

619
01:09:39,244 --> 01:09:42,008
There is one complication.

620
01:09:42,364 --> 01:09:44,819
The nature of the legacy.

621
01:09:46,068 --> 01:09:48,191
The nature of the legacy?

622
01:09:52,985 --> 01:09:55,327
If you'll forgive me, sir...

623
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:59,287
it is unusual for an estate

624
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:01,798
to be left solely to a married woman.

625
01:10:02,096 --> 01:10:04,757
It would normally
be left to the husband.

626
01:10:09,261 --> 01:10:10,827
And why is that?

627
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:15,567
To avoid any suggestion of...

628
01:10:15,747 --> 01:10:17,569
forgive me,

629
01:10:18,408 --> 01:10:22,162
impropriety in the relationship.

630
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:31,198
What was he to you?

631
01:10:34,475 --> 01:10:38,059
What was he thinking,
the stupid old bastard?

632
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:41,465
He should have left it all to me.

633
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:48,011
That would have been much better for you.

634
01:10:56,396 --> 01:10:58,800
He must have known
what people would make of it.

635
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:02,227
He must have realized how it would
compromise you.

636
01:11:02,885 --> 01:11:04,950
Unless it was done in innocence.

637
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:07,017
The fatherly gesture?

638
01:11:08,301 --> 01:11:10,900
He was like a father to you,
wasn't he?

639
01:11:11,169 --> 01:11:12,732
A guardian.

640
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,600
I can't accept it.

641
01:11:22,334 --> 01:11:24,697
I must protect my reputation.

642
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:30,335
I don't want a million francs.

643
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:35,500
Come on, let's not be hasty.

644
01:11:36,444 --> 01:11:38,657
I'm sure we can reach some kind of...

645
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:48,557
But the will is there,
for all to see.

646
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:52,727
I can only redeem it by rejecting it.

647
01:11:57,825 --> 01:12:00,669
But if I, your husband,
chose to accept it,

648
01:12:01,813 --> 01:12:04,032
then who is to question me?

649
01:12:11,574 --> 01:12:13,360
Indeed,

650
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,892
to refuse,

651
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:17,222
is to admit the shame.

652
01:12:19,016 --> 01:12:20,838
Whereas,

653
01:12:21,565 --> 01:12:23,300
to accept,

654
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:25,282
is to deny it.

655
01:12:41,221 --> 01:12:42,343
Good.

656
01:12:50,723 --> 01:12:54,081
Perhaps your old man
wasn't so stupid after all.

657
01:12:54,445 --> 01:12:56,881
Don't speak of him.

658
01:13:02,965 --> 01:13:04,512
What was he to you?

659
01:13:07,733 --> 01:13:09,133
Tell me.

660
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:13,997
Tell me, I deserve an answer.

661
01:13:21,846 --> 01:13:23,247
He is...

662
01:13:23,676 --> 01:13:25,882
a man I have lost.

663
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:29,785
The man I am...

664
01:13:30,521 --> 01:13:32,347
grieving.

665
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:39,328
You wanted...

666
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:41,909
to be something small,

667
01:13:42,124 --> 01:13:44,237
something squalid,

668
01:13:44,243 --> 01:13:46,580
and contemptible.

669
01:13:52,533 --> 01:13:55,454
He was my friend.

670
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:01,586
My father,

671
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:06,287
and my lover.

672
01:14:14,789 --> 01:14:17,306
You loved him.

673
01:14:34,231 --> 01:14:37,157
How will I live...

674
01:14:37,782 --> 01:14:40,987
How will I live...

675
01:14:48,581 --> 01:14:50,860
You haven't been to see me for a while.

676
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:55,567
For a whole week I waited
for a word from you.

677
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:56,995
Georges.

678
01:14:57,258 --> 01:15:00,327
My beautiful boy.
- Don't call me that!

679
01:15:08,132 --> 01:15:09,753
They're not for you.

680
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:13,522
You're meeting someone else.

681
01:15:13,943 --> 01:15:15,958
Take me with you.
I need to talk to you.

682
01:15:16,424 --> 01:15:19,969
Just for a while.
Remember where you are!

683
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,422
You shouldn't have seduced me.

684
01:15:23,916 --> 01:15:25,404
You should have left me where I was.

685
01:15:25,406 --> 01:15:28,589
A happy and faithful wife.

686
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:31,800
Please, let me come with you.
Please, just for an hour.

687
01:15:31,802 --> 01:15:34,262
I've got something so important
to tell you.

688
01:15:34,578 --> 01:15:37,050
Something to your advantage.

689
01:15:37,482 --> 01:15:40,121
It's about my husband.

690
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:46,681
Please.

691
01:15:49,528 --> 01:15:52,100
If you're going to cry,
you should leave.

692
01:15:52,914 --> 01:15:54,736
Please, Georges.

693
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,890
Oh, my darling Georges.

694
01:15:59,197 --> 01:16:01,363
My beautiful boy.

695
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:04,000
I have been so clever.

696
01:16:04,598 --> 01:16:06,000
So discreet.

697
01:16:06,697 --> 01:16:09,360
I've asked all the right questions.

698
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,799
And listened carefully.

699
01:16:12,103 --> 01:16:13,553
Oh, come on!

700
01:16:17,463 --> 01:16:18,864
What?

701
01:16:21,099 --> 01:16:24,637
Our new government is going
to take Morocco.

702
01:16:37,278 --> 01:16:38,489
Virginia.

703
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:40,839
The new government came to power,

704
01:16:41,059 --> 01:16:43,042
I brought them to power,

705
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:45,047
on the promise that they would not.

706
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:47,315
That's the whole point.

707
01:16:47,716 --> 01:16:49,116
Don't you see?

708
01:16:49,973 --> 01:16:51,961
No one's expecting it.

709
01:16:52,234 --> 01:16:53,817
My husband and Laroche have been hatching

710
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:56,051
this plan for a long time.

711
01:16:56,304 --> 01:16:59,107
The first troops sail tonight.

712
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,661
Tonight?

713
01:17:02,176 --> 01:17:04,274
But they would have included me.

714
01:17:05,425 --> 01:17:06,837
They don't trust you.

715
01:17:07,072 --> 01:17:09,156
They think you're too impulsive.

716
01:17:09,392 --> 01:17:12,427
Too greedy, they say.
Not used to having money.

717
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:15,827
They think that you'll give them away.

718
01:17:16,357 --> 01:17:20,138
They think I'm too greedy?
- They don't know you as I do.

719
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:24,250
Over the past few weeks,
they've bought the entire Moroccan loan.

720
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,000
They've bought every copper mine in Morocco.
Every last one.

721
01:17:28,298 --> 01:17:31,587
They stand to make 70 million apiece.

722
01:17:34,289 --> 01:17:36,110
70 million?

723
01:17:36,381 --> 01:17:38,052
He's spending it already.

724
01:17:38,326 --> 01:17:41,004
He's going to buy The Ballet Saint-Honorary©.

725
01:17:41,349 --> 01:17:44,621
70 million and I've shamed myself for a pittance.

726
01:17:44,914 --> 01:17:47,059
Aren't you proud of me?

727
01:17:47,357 --> 01:17:48,759
Don't you love me?

728
01:17:48,993 --> 01:17:53,004
Haven't I done well
finding this out, my darling?

729
01:17:53,231 --> 01:17:55,754
I've bought shares for you too.

730
01:17:56,663 --> 01:18:00,230
And they'll make you at least
seventy thousand.

731
01:18:04,155 --> 01:18:05,782
I don't want your pennies!

732
01:18:06,071 --> 01:18:09,456
They're not worth the price
I've paid for them!

733
01:18:09,702 --> 01:18:10,823
No!

734
01:18:14,852 --> 01:18:17,436
You disgust me!
- But I love you!

735
01:18:17,628 --> 01:18:18,804
I don't want your love.

736
01:18:19,005 --> 01:18:21,108
I've never loved you.

737
01:18:21,515 --> 01:18:24,046
Your smell.
It turns my stomach!

738
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:26,436
Because you smell of him!

739
01:18:26,724 --> 01:18:28,485
Your filthy husband!

740
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:32,007
I used to laugh every time I'd had you
to think I'd sent you back

741
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:34,758
to him with my sweat on your skin,
when all the while,

742
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:36,418
it was me!

743
01:18:36,672 --> 01:18:38,974
I was the one getting fucked!

744
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:40,739
Me!

745
01:18:59,582 --> 01:19:02,409
Get out of my house!
- Just listen to them, Georges.

746
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:03,805
Get out!

747
01:19:03,984 --> 01:19:05,662
Get out of my house!

748
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:09,515
Listen to them, Georges.
Just listen to what they have to say!

749
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,814
I am going to ruin you.
Don't be a child.

750
01:19:12,817 --> 01:19:14,137
Consider your best interest.

751
01:19:14,139 --> 01:19:16,479
There's still money to be made.

752
01:19:18,247 --> 01:19:19,930
You think I've robbed you?

753
01:19:20,001 --> 01:19:21,640
You're not my responsibility.

754
01:19:21,874 --> 01:19:23,215
The opportunity was there

755
01:19:23,218 --> 01:19:25,023
for anyone who had eyes to see it.

756
01:19:27,361 --> 01:19:29,093
You!

757
01:19:33,796 --> 01:19:36,373
You are an embarrassment to Charles.

758
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:39,827
A failed soldier,
barely literate.

759
01:19:40,143 --> 01:19:43,063
He said you'd never amount to much.

760
01:19:43,397 --> 01:19:46,074
Seems he was right.

761
01:19:49,228 --> 01:19:52,132
Pity you didn't marry more wisely.

762
01:19:52,491 --> 01:19:54,694
You'll be missed.

763
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:08,651
You knew!

764
01:20:11,701 --> 01:20:13,788
Don't be absurd, Georges.

765
01:20:14,047 --> 01:20:16,107
How could I know?

766
01:20:16,346 --> 01:20:17,800
I'm a woman.

767
01:20:18,048 --> 01:20:21,700
I'm not invited to the card game.

768
01:20:27,251 --> 01:20:29,334
Who was it today, hm?

769
01:20:29,665 --> 01:20:31,066
Clotilde?

770
01:20:31,685 --> 01:20:33,193
Or Virginia?

771
01:20:33,506 --> 01:20:35,472
Or both!

772
01:20:35,811 --> 01:20:37,511
And yesterday?

773
01:20:37,882 --> 01:20:39,137
You stupid,

774
01:20:39,365 --> 01:20:41,000
stupid man!

775
01:20:41,717 --> 01:20:45,000
You, complete and perfect man!

776
01:20:48,821 --> 01:20:51,912
I poured my talent into you!

777
01:20:52,035 --> 01:20:53,197
My intelligence.

778
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:55,781
My vision into you!

779
01:20:56,053 --> 01:20:58,371
I had no conception

780
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,390
of the depths of your emptiness!

781
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:03,810
Nothing.

782
01:21:04,126 --> 01:21:06,006
There's nothing there.

783
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:08,659
Nothing but rage.

784
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:10,417
Like dumb animal.

785
01:21:12,614 --> 01:21:14,016
That's what you are.

786
01:21:14,345 --> 01:21:16,000
An animal.

787
01:21:16,207 --> 01:21:18,127
I thought I could teach you.

788
01:21:18,363 --> 01:21:20,982
But what I should have done
was train you!

789
01:22:54,911 --> 01:22:56,733
Excuse me.

790
01:23:17,387 --> 01:23:20,135
I always liked your audacity.

791
01:23:20,432 --> 01:23:23,172
I don't need to hide my face,
I'm not the criminal.

792
01:23:23,372 --> 01:23:25,667
You're not going to throw me out?
- No.

793
01:23:25,941 --> 01:23:29,652
Stay. Drink my champagne,
dance with my wife.

794
01:23:29,926 --> 01:23:31,967
Yours, I see,

795
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:34,333
is already spoken for.

796
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,315
Georges.

797
01:24:04,762 --> 01:24:05,789
Georges?

798
01:24:35,169 --> 01:24:37,300
I've been such a fool.

799
01:24:59,389 --> 01:25:02,231
Why do you come back to me?

800
01:25:05,065 --> 01:25:06,466
I don't know.

801
01:25:08,841 --> 01:25:11,492
Perhaps because you never
expect me to.

802
01:25:14,811 --> 01:25:17,333
I am sorry I hurt you.

803
01:25:17,617 --> 01:25:19,652
It is worth saying.

804
01:25:57,272 --> 01:26:00,985
I've never seen such a host
of bucktooth cretins.

805
01:26:01,262 --> 01:26:03,393
Everyone a noble bankrupt.

806
01:26:03,396 --> 01:26:07,187
All here for Suzanne
and her 30 million francs.

807
01:26:44,519 --> 01:26:48,037
Open this door or we will force it!
Who is it?

808
01:26:48,297 --> 01:26:50,183
Police.

809
01:26:52,751 --> 01:26:55,527
Madame, Madeleine Duroy
de Contel?

810
01:26:55,810 --> 01:26:58,675
Wife of Mr. Georges Duroy
de Contel?

811
01:26:59,012 --> 01:27:00,134
Yes.

812
01:27:11,361 --> 01:27:13,290
Madame Duroy de Contel.

813
01:27:13,293 --> 01:27:16,906
I have found you here in a place
that is not your home.

814
01:27:16,941 --> 01:27:19,352
With Mr. Francaise Laroche.

815
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:22,451
Do you admit to this man
as your lover?

816
01:27:22,734 --> 01:27:24,135
I admit it.

817
01:27:25,181 --> 01:27:28,389
Madame I have no choice
but to charge you with adultery.

818
01:27:28,821 --> 01:27:31,648
Is there anything you wish to say?
- No.

819
01:27:31,921 --> 01:27:33,364
Let's leave her in peace.

820
01:27:33,626 --> 01:27:35,843
We have no further business here.

821
01:27:38,334 --> 01:27:39,863
What should I do?

822
01:27:40,142 --> 01:27:41,504
Should I go?

823
01:27:41,539 --> 01:27:42,867
No, stay.

824
01:27:43,156 --> 01:27:45,290
Finish, if you like.

825
01:27:53,205 --> 01:27:54,325
Well,

826
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:58,000
you'll hear from my lawyer
in a few days.

827
01:28:00,014 --> 01:28:02,242
Good-bye, Georges.

828
01:28:03,229 --> 01:28:05,460
Good-bye.

829
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:27,983
I couldn't get away!
They were shouting and screaming on and on.

830
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:32,217
My mum wouldn't stop crying and wailing,
she was like a mad woman.

831
01:28:34,084 --> 01:28:37,007
I wish I could see their faces
when they find me gone!

832
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:38,915
Papa will turn blue.

833
01:28:58,991 --> 01:29:01,067
We'll need two rooms.

834
01:29:10,964 --> 01:29:13,747
Good night, Suzanne.
- But...

835
01:29:16,882 --> 01:29:19,702
I need a good-night kiss.

836
01:29:25,382 --> 01:29:27,130
You should get some sleep.

837
01:29:27,453 --> 01:29:30,459
But I...
- Get some sleep.

838
01:29:52,786 --> 01:29:53,908
Papa.

839
01:29:55,417 --> 01:29:56,539
Maman.

840
01:30:12,086 --> 01:30:15,262
He will not marry her.
- I should have seen it coming.

841
01:30:15,264 --> 01:30:18,553
He will not marry her!

842
01:30:18,839 --> 01:30:22,142
I will not...
Stop it!

843
01:30:22,157 --> 01:30:24,407
He will marry her!

844
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:26,771
He must marry her!

845
01:30:27,034 --> 01:30:29,669
And you will accept it, Virginia!

846
01:30:29,754 --> 01:30:31,987
This is as much your doing
as it is mine!

847
01:30:32,063 --> 01:30:33,294
My doing?

848
01:30:33,502 --> 01:30:37,721
Your infatuation for him
infected my daughter!

849
01:30:38,288 --> 01:30:41,809
He will marry her,
and I will be glad of it.

850
01:30:41,893 --> 01:30:45,372
What more can a father wish for,
than to see his daughter

851
01:30:45,375 --> 01:30:48,100
with a man he can respect?

852
01:31:03,603 --> 01:31:06,000
She's only a child.

853
01:31:07,429 --> 01:31:09,680
Do you love her?
- No.

854
01:31:13,263 --> 01:31:15,360
She's of no interest to me.

855
01:31:17,229 --> 01:31:19,100
Poor little Suzanne.

856
01:31:19,421 --> 01:31:21,300
Suzanne's her father.

857
01:31:21,546 --> 01:31:23,880
Just some perfect miniature.

858
01:31:24,353 --> 01:31:28,000
You've ruined her.
I haven't. I'm going to marry her.

859
01:31:30,095 --> 01:31:32,076
Did you sleep with her?

860
01:31:33,688 --> 01:31:34,809
No.

861
01:31:35,488 --> 01:31:37,211
You didn't sleep with her.

862
01:31:37,435 --> 01:31:38,761
I didn't touch her.

863
01:31:38,999 --> 01:31:40,559
I didn't need to.

864
01:31:40,843 --> 01:31:43,300
It was enough for people
to think I had.

865
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:46,081
I don't know you at all.

866
01:31:46,948 --> 01:31:48,069
You do.

867
01:31:48,302 --> 01:31:49,769
Oh, do I?

868
01:31:52,026 --> 01:31:54,100
He planned it.

869
01:31:55,098 --> 01:31:57,000
You planned it!

870
01:31:58,448 --> 01:32:00,453
You've ruined Laroche.

871
01:32:00,723 --> 01:32:03,361
You humiliated Madeleine.

872
01:32:03,622 --> 01:32:06,000
You humiliated her!

873
01:32:06,724 --> 01:32:09,000
All, so you could take Suzanne.

874
01:32:09,283 --> 01:32:10,657
Suzanne chose me because I was

875
01:32:10,659 --> 01:32:12,532
the only one she wasn't
allowed to have.

876
01:32:12,766 --> 01:32:13,888
And me?

877
01:32:14,099 --> 01:32:17,645
Did you ever think,
how this would hurt me?

878
01:32:17,859 --> 01:32:20,460
It has nothing to do with you.

879
01:32:21,175 --> 01:32:23,293
Then why am I in pain?

880
01:32:23,299 --> 01:32:24,847
I don't know.

881
01:32:25,115 --> 01:32:27,327
You didn't even tell me yourself.

882
01:32:27,441 --> 01:32:30,512
I had to hear it from my husband.

883
01:32:31,007 --> 01:32:32,822
You think I'll forgive you anything.

884
01:32:32,832 --> 01:32:35,942
I will not be stopped, Clotilde.

885
01:32:36,255 --> 01:32:38,250
I will marry her.

886
01:32:40,509 --> 01:32:42,947
You're just one of them, after all.

887
01:32:45,808 --> 01:32:47,339
Just another,

888
01:32:47,942 --> 01:32:50,627
selfish, brutal man.

889
01:32:51,172 --> 01:32:53,809
Just another thief.

890
01:32:54,124 --> 01:32:57,166
It's not enough to be loved, is it?

891
01:32:57,402 --> 01:33:00,000
Oh, you must be a king!

892
01:33:00,854 --> 01:33:01,974
No.

893
01:33:04,498 --> 01:33:06,921
It's not enough to be loved.

894
01:33:07,166 --> 01:33:09,195
Even by you.

895
01:33:11,061 --> 01:33:14,200
I loved you when you had nothing.

896
01:33:14,769 --> 01:33:18,467
I don't understand
why you must be so proud.

897
01:33:21,009 --> 01:33:24,637
I don't understand.
- It's because you've never been poor.

898
01:33:25,241 --> 01:33:29,280
Trying to scrape out some miserable
scrap of an existence!

899
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:33,774
I can't live like that.

900
01:33:34,555 --> 01:33:36,319
Like my father.

901
01:33:38,148 --> 01:33:40,302
Working to the bone,

902
01:33:40,936 --> 01:33:43,562
and then down on his knees,
every week,

903
01:33:44,537 --> 01:33:47,782
praying to God that the next
life will be better.

904
01:33:49,879 --> 01:33:52,440
Well, there is no next life.

905
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:54,750
The flesh,

906
01:33:55,001 --> 01:33:57,022
it rots in the earth.

907
01:33:57,759 --> 01:34:00,007
It rots.

908
01:34:02,016 --> 01:34:05,124
I have seen a man die.

909
01:34:05,496 --> 01:34:09,606
And I am going to live.

910
01:34:11,718 --> 01:34:14,300
It's so clear to me.

911
01:34:18,456 --> 01:34:21,000
I thought you'd understand.
