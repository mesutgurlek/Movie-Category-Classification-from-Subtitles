<i>[woman]
Publications like Rolling Stone and Spare Rib</i>

2
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,011
were created to feed the need

3
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:52,019
for alternative narratives from the
established newspapers of the day.

4
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:56,432
In much the same way, the Pauper <i>Press</i>
of the 1790s in England was developed

5
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,727
out of a need for mass representation
for the popular classes.

6
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,818
Those magazines and fanzines
of the '60s and '70s also provided

7
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,858
a means of reaching
beyond the official

8
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,449
and thus, ultimately,
beyond the ruling classes.

9
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,737
The Internet, in contrast,

10
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,248
no longer requires there to be
any notion of the group.

11
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,290
Its concern is wholly
with the individual.

12
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,040
It is with lucrative serendipity,
or perhaps just good branding,

13
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,004
that Myspace is so called.

14
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,589
The juxtaposition suggests
that the act of the individual

15
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,596
in defining their cyberspace
borders is more important

16
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,679
than what it is filled with.
It is simply 'your space.'.

17
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,015
For the end of monetized
mass communication

18
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,181
is the end of the press baron
champagne baths.

[man] Thank you, Anna.
Very provocative. Well done.

22
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,697
[man] All right, make sure you turn
in your final packet to Jacob.

23
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,831
And thank you very much.

24
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,412
Hi.

25
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,378
I don't need to give you mine,
because I've already done it.

26
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,962
[Jacob] Cool.
- Cool.

27
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,216

If she comes to invite
wearing the same dress as me,

- I will completely freak out!
- Hey, yeah... yeah.

30
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,807
No, it was OK.

31
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,983
It was fine.

Mum, can you just...

34
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,700
I'll speak to you in a minute. I have
someone waiting on the other line.

35
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,459

<i>- It's Jacob.
- Hi.</i>

40
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,063
[Anna] It didn't freak you out?

41
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,188
I guess you wouldn't
be here if it had.

42
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,229
No, it was nice.
And it was funny.

43
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:52,275
It was kind of great. I don't think
you're a nutcase, by the way, at all.

44
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,318
I thought I'd better
put that, just in case.

45
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,829
- That was a good disclaimer.
- Yeah, I just wanted to set that out.

46
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,082
- "No nutcases here."
- Yeah.

47
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,208
[laughs]
- Whoa.

48
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,753
These cups are huge.
They're like reservoirs.

49
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,715
It's almost bigger
than my face. [giggles]

50
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,591
Yeah, so what do you...
What's your major?

51
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,852
Furniture design.

52
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,808
That's why you're always drawing.

53
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,439
Yeah. You like to write then?

54
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,692
Yeah, yeah. I mean,

55
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,946
journalism is probably what I
would want to kind of go into

56
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,606
when I graduate. I don't know.

57
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:37,779
Who knows what we're going
to do when we leave.

58
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,788
You mean permanently when we leave?
Like when we're dead? We'll be dead.

59
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,370
[laughs] When we leave.
When we depart this planet.

[both laugh]

61
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,018
So are you going to
stay in LA after school?

62
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:04,555
Yeah, I'd like to,
if I can sort out my visa stuff.

63
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,642
So you grew up with
your mum and dad?

64
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,153
- My mom.
- And your dad?

65
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,279
He passed away when I was ten.

66
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:17,693
[Anna] Now, that's shitty.
- Yeah. It's quite shitty.

67
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,038
And what about you?

68
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,746
Yeah, my parents,
I'm very close to them.

69
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,502
It's only ever been...
I'm an only child, so...

70
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,504
Me, too.

71
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,126
Yeah, so I'm quite close to them.

72
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,044
But it's nice being away.

73
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,464
I think it's important to...

74
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,976
to get away from where you've
grown up for some of your life.

75
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,184
I was thinking about
leaving right now, actually.

Um, do you want to come up?

to go to bed early.

80

Oh, no, that's terrible!

81
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,541
So I try not to make too much noise.
Do you want a drink?

82
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,377
I only have whiskey.

83
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,758
Yeah.

84
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:22,474
- I don't drink much... actually.

- Is that the chair where you write?
- Yeah.

89

It's not very comfortable.

90

- Yeah.

- Do you?
- Yeah, I love Paul Simon.

OK.

Not really.

That the wholeness
was a rather luxurious idea.

Because it's the halves
that halve you in half.

Didn't know. Don't know

01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:08,026
And that, unfortunately is the...
comes down to the reason

775
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:12,989
that I can't process your application
for marriage visa, nor lift the ban.

It has to come from
the student visa office.

777

Yeah, but we've already applied several
times throughout the last couple years,

778
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,708
as you can see. So I don't know how
many times you expect us to do it.

I mean, I don't know how...

780
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:26,965
We were told...
I was told by my lawyer

781
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:30,048
that this would be dealt
with separately

782
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,963
from the visa violation,
which is why we're here.

- We've appealed four times.

784

- That is what is in the way.
- This is a separate situation.

785
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:41,222
Then I want to know who he spoke to,
because we speak to someone different

786
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,061
- every single time.
[Anna] Should there not be one person

who's dealing
with our particular application?

788

[woman] I wish I could
process this right now,

789
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,109
but it is not up to me,

790
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:53,742
and I will handle it as soon
as I get a lift on the ban.

- Why did you just walk off?

I didn't. I went to look at something,

and you were gone.

Sure.

You haven't touched your wine.
Would you like some other wine?

962

Could I get a whiskey?
Do you have any?

No, we haven't got any whiskey.

[Anna] No. We're cutting down.

[mother] New rules'?

970

- Place is on lockdown.

[Anna] It's good.
[Simon] Yeah, it's bad for your skin.

973
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:38,539

For the last two weeks.

- Every morning?
[mother] That's what it is!

980
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:55,802
You're glowing.
I have to say, you do...

981
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,436
- You do look different.
- Even more than usual.

982

[mother] You're the first person
that has ever

983

- got Anna to do any exercise.
[Simon] Really?

984
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,692
I thought it was the new promotion,
but all right.

985
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,603
[mother] I thought it was
the promotion, too.

986
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,444
[Simon] But she has a very...
She has a very healthy breakfast.

987
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:10,950
A bit of oats
and some egg whites in there.

988
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,031
- You have changed.
- A sprinkle of cinnamon, no sugar.

989
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:15,492
- You have changed!
- If you want to lose weight, no sugar.

990
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:19,158
That would be it. Everything's moving in
the right direction. I'm really happy.

991
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,836
- This is delicious.
[Anna] It's good, isn't it?

992
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,372
It's very, very good.

993
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:25,710
[mother] Are we going
to play Balderdash?

994
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:28,046
- Oh, yes!
- That'll keep us going.

995
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:30,837
- Actually, the night is young.
- Yeah, we can play Balderdash.

[Bernard] Oh, lovely!
- But just before, um...

997
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:37,393
I just want to say
thank you for coming over.

998
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:40,430
- It's been a really special evening.
[Anna] Thanks for coming.

999
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,145
[mother] Thanks to you for
inviting us, my goodness!

1000
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:47,486
I just...
You know, I like to think of life

1001
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,898
as a bit of a puzzle.

1002
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,819
- A jigsaw.
- Oh, no. He's going to make a speech.

1003
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:55,281
Just stick with me on this.

1004
01:16:57,113 --> 01:17:00,788
And, um, for the longest time
there was always one piece missing.

1005
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:04,500
A big piece in the middle.
And I looked around forever.

1006
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:07,882
And I just couldn't find it.

1007
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:12,795
So, um, along comes Anna.

1008
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:16,136
And can I just
commend you two on producing

1009
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,051
such a wonderful young woman?

1010

She's pretty exceptional.

I mean, we've only been
together, what, six months?

1012
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:27,815
But I've known
her almost three years,

1013
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:32,073

You're beautiful, driven, intelligent.

I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.
