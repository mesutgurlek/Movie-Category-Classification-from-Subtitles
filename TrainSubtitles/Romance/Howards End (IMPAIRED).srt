- Paul, my hat's in your hand.
- Good-bye.

158
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,536
See you there.

159
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,691
What astonishing bad luck...

160
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,111
that in the whole of London
they could find no flat to rent...

161
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,822
except the one bottled right up
against our library window.

162
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,075
Who could find no flat?

163
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,495
Tibby, the Wilcoxes.

164
00:15:55,579 --> 00:16:00,333
Surely even you remember that business
last summer with Helen and Paul Wilcox.

165
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,335
Paul Wilcox.

166
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,129
The one I was expected to thrash
within an inch of his life?

167
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,591
Oh, miss!

168
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,697
What is it? Is Tibby ill?

169
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,615
Tibby's making tea.

170
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,368
Oh, well.

171
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,830
- If it's nothing worse than that.
- Now. Helen —

172
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,458
Oh, dear.
Something odd has happened.

173
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,877
Promise me you won't mind.

174
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,339
It's the Wilcoxes.

175
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,635
They've taken the flat opposite
for the wedding of their son.

176
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,971
The other son.

177
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,977
You do mind.

178
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,153
Will Paul Wilcox point
at our house and say...

179
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,946
"There lives the girl
who tried to catch me"?

180
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,073
Ridiculous.

181
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,161
They've only taken the flat
for a few weeks, the porter said.

182
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,500
Do we bow,
or do we cut them dead?

183
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,754
Darling...

184
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,797
why don't you take up
Cousin Frieda's invitation...

185
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,300
and go to Hamburg
for those few weeks?

186
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,219
Yes. I think I shall.

187
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,597
Not that it matters. But...

188
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,349
one wouldn't want to keep
bumping into Wilcoxes.

189
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,065
Don't hog all
those scones. Tibby.

190
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,031
Is that young man for us.
Do you suppose?

191
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,327
He is for us.

192
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,878
Uh, if you'll pardon me, miss.
You took my umbrella.

193
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,464
Quite inadvertently, I'm sure.

194
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:15,218
At the Ethical Hall.
"Music and meaning."

195
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,680
I'm so sorry. I do nothing
but steal umbrellas.

196
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,724
Do come in and choose one.
It's all right. Annie.

197
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,561
Let's see, is yours
a hooky or a knobbly?

198
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,398
Mine's a knobbly. At least I think it is.
That's Tibby's. How about this one?

199
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,652
I suppose you really oughtn't
open these indoors. Never mind.

200
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,822
No. It's all gone along the seams.
It's an appalling umbrella.

201
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,865
It must be mine.

202
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:44,122
- Oh. I'm so sorry.
- Has my sister stolen your umbrella?

203
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,875
Oh, not again. Helen. She is
an incorrigible thief. I am so sorry.

204
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,337
- I say, do stay for tea. Mr. —
- Bast.

205
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,674
- Mr. Bast. Won't you stay for tea?
- Yes, do stay, Mr. Bast.

206
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,884
It's the least we can do
having made you all wet.

207
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,886
Our brother's upstairs.
So you'll have a chaperon.

208
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,640
- Look, he's soaked. Meg. Please come up.
- Helen. Put him upstairs.

209
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,603
What did you think of the lecture?
I don't agree about the goblins.

210
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,689
But I do about
the heroes and shipwreck.

211
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:13,317
You see, I'd always imagined a trio
of elephants dancing at that point.

212
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,527
Well, he obviously didn't.

213
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,737
- "Music and Meaning," Margaret.
- Oh. "Music and Meaning."

214
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,532
Does music have meaning?
Of the literary kind. I mean.

215
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,868
- That's pure slush.
- A guest.

216
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,121
- Mr. Bast. Won't you take off your coat?
- And trust us with your umbrella?

217
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,748
- And sit down.
- Have some tea, won't you?

218
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,917
How boring it would be
if it were only the score.

219
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,502
- China tea?
- Do you take sugar?

220
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,379
"Only the score"?
What an insidious "only."

221
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,381
We do have the other
kind of tea. If you prefer.

222
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,383
- Thank you, but. Uh —
- Don't you want that?

223
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,636
Here are some scones that
Tibby hasn't yet consumed.

224
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,605
We are so very sorry to have
put you to this inconvenience.

225
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,107
I hope you will
come another day.

226
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,151
Would you?

227
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,197
We should be so glad.
Do take our card.

228
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:03,242
Thank you. If you'll excuse me.
I really must be going.

229
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,418
I'll see you out. Are you sure you
don't want a scone for the journey?

230
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:17,340
No. No, thankyou.
I must be going. Good-bye.

231
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:44,575
Why didn't you make that
young man welcome, Tibby? Hmm?

232
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,328
You must do the host
a little, you know.

233
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,456
You could've coaxed him
into stopping...

234
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,709
instead of letting him
be swamped by screaming women.

That you, Len?

241
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,369
Where have you been?

242
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,789
- I'm off my head with worrying.
- About what?

243
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,458
- About you.
- Let go, Jacky.

244

Anymore, Jacky.

It's a I I right. I got it back.

00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,697
Have you had your tea?
I've kept you a bit of tongue in jelly.

252
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,782
- No.
- Sure?

253
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,787
I'll have it. Then.
Funny, isn't it?

254
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,458
Every time I worry,
I get starving hungry.

255
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:22,256
The thoughts that go through
my head. You'd laugh.

256
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,967
You listening. Len?

257
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,053
Not only accidents.

- Didyou?
- No.

260
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,187

You see, all that business
last summer at Howards End —

308
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,652
No. It goes further than that.

309
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,447
Since we met at Speyer.
Do you remember?

310
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:59,158
That restored cathedral
we all hated so.

311
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:03,078
What I remember
principally about Speyer...

312
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,582
was the great pleasure
of meeting you. Miss Schlegel.

313
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:14,048
- Helen's gone to Germany.
- And Paul's gone to Nigeria.

314
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,216
[Chuckling]
So...

315
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,553
you see, now we can meet.
Because they can't.

316
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,640
It's no use beating about the bush.
What happened in the summer...

317
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,476
was unfortunate
for both of them, don't you feel?

318
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,853
Because —
I'm sure you think the same way.

319
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:31,106
- Because they should not meet.
- Yes. I feel that.

320
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,693
They belong to types that can
fall in love. But can't live together.

321
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,113
I'm afraid that
in nine cases out of ten...

322
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,616
nature pulls one way
and human nature the other.

323
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,581
I do rattle on. I'm afraid
I shall tire you out in no time.

324
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:52,336
It is true I am not
particularly well just today.

325
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,634
But I'm so grateful for your visit.
Miss Schlegel. You see. I'm quite alone.

326
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:02,930
My husband and daughter have gone off
on a motoring tour in Yorkshire...

327
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,933
and the young couple
are on their honeymoon.

328
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:10,270
- Charles and Dolly.
- Oh. May I see? How lovely.

329
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:15,484
They've gone to Naples. I can hardly
imagine my Charles in Naples.

330
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:19,405
- Doesn't he like traveling?
- Oh. Yes. He likes travel.

331
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,074
But he does see through
foreigners so.

332
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:27,204
What he would enjoy most
is a motor tour through England.

333
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,249
Charles takes after me,
Miss Schlegel.

334
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,085
He truly loves England.

335
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:39,842
Not. Of course, London.
None of us love London.

336
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,681
It's so —

337
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:50,978
It makes one feel so unstable.
Impermanent...

338
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,149
with houses being torn down
on all sides.

339
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:01,280
Including,
in the foreseeable future, ours.

340
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:04,742
- Are you having to leave Wickham Place?
- Yes.

341
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,119
In 18 months or so
when the lease expires.

342
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:10,205
- Have you been there long?
- All our lives. We were born there.

343
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,958
Oh, the —

344
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,294
That is monstrous.

345
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,463
Oh, I do pity you,
from the bottom of my heart.

346
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,716
I had no idea this thing
was hanging over you.

347
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,802
- How dreadful.
- Oh, well —

348
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:27,139
- Oh. You poor, poor girls.
- Well, of course...

349
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:31,477
we are fond of the house.
But it is an ordinary London house.

350
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,730
- We shall easily find another.
- No.

351
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,399
Not in this world.

352
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,737
Not the house
that you were born in.

353
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,323
You'll never find that again.

354
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,408
Poor, poor girls.

355
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,745
[Sighs]

356
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,206
Howards End was almost
pulled down once.

357
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,709
It would have killed me.
It's my house. You know.

358
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,546
It was left to me by my brother
who died out in India.

359
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,465
I love it so.

360
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:05,219
I even resisted when Henry —
my husband —

361
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,388
wanted to make changes
to improve the property.

362
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,267
He knew best. Of course.

363
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,019
[Chuckles]

364
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,563
We even have a garage.

365
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,196
To the west of the house...

366
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,241
just beyond the chestnut tree...

367
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,912
in the paddock where
the pony used to be.

368
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,791
Where's the pony gone?

369
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:41,505
The pony?
Oh, dead, ever so long ago.

370
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:47,469
The vice of the pan-German mind is that
it only cares for what it can use.

371
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:51,056
- That is the vice of the imperial mind.
- No, that is the vice of the vulgar mind.

372
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,310
But, and this is the tremendous part.
They take poetry seriously.

373
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,105
- They do take poetry seriously.
- But is anything gained by that?

374
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,608
Yes, the Germans
are always striving for beauty.

375
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,863
Oh, but. Mrs. Wilcox, my father
was a German of the old school...

376
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,906
a philosopher. An idealist...

377
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,867
the countryman of Hegel and Kant.

378
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:13,412
- But isn't that your father's sword
you have upstairs in the drawing room?
- Oh, yes.

379
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,414
He was a soldier too when he had to be.

380
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:18,000
But he was so uncomfortable
about being on the winning side...

381
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,794
that he just hung up his sword
and never used it again.

382
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:26,174
- My idea has always been that...
- [Chatter Dies Down]

383
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:33,265
If we could bring the mothers...

384
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:38,020
of the various nations together...

385
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,481
then there would be no more war.

386
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,110
- Oh. Indeed. Yes.
- Absolutely.

387
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:48,780
If the mothers went to war.
There'd be no one left to defend.

388
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,533
- Mrs. Wilcox. Will you have another jelly?
- Thank you.

389
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,870
You are fortunate in your cook.

390
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:58,540
We have found it difficult to get
reliable servants in London.

391
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,960
- It is difficult.
- Servants have become as unreliable as we.

392
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,130
We can hardly expect them to listen to
radical discussions at the luncheon table.

393
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,174
Annie does very well.
Don't you. Annie?

394
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,967
You're very patient with us.

395
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:12,638
We never discuss at Howards End...

396
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,640
except perhaps sport.

397
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:18,101
Oh, but you should.
Discussion keeps a house alive.

398
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,646
You will laugh
at my old-fashioned ideas.

399
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,231
[Chuckles]
I will not.

400
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,401
I sometimes think...

401
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,532
it would be wiser to leave
action and discussion to men.

402
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,744
But. Then where would
we be with the suffrage?

403
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:41,750
I am only too thankful
not to have the vote myself.

404
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,758
Shall we go up for coffee?

405
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,429
Duncan. Will you lead the way?
Thank you.

406
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:58,558
[Chattering, Indistinct]

407
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:14,116
- What interesting lives you all lead.
- No. We don't.

408
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,120
It's no use pretending
you enjoyed lunch, for you loathed it.

409
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,039
But I hope you will forgive me...

410
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,084
by coming again. Alone.
Or by asking me to you.

411
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,713
I enjoyed my lunch very much.
Miss Schlegel, truly I did.

412
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,798
I only wish I could've joined in more.

413
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,259
You're —

414
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:36,722
You're so clever,
and yet, so good.

415
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:40,517
No, that's very kind of you,
but I am neither, I'm afraid.

416
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,645
You've been very good to me.
You've kept me from brooding.

417
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,858
- I'm too apt to brood.
- About what?

418
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,903
Well, I don't know.
I really don't know.

419
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:56,408
I think about my house a great deal.

420
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,786
You've never seen Howards End.
I want to show it to you.

421
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,606
[Margaret] Now. This is the scientific
approach to Christmas shopping: A list.

422
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,151
[Mrs. Wilcox]
A list. What a good idea.

423
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,112
Why don't you put your own name
at the top of the list?

424
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:38,366
Hurray. How very kind of you
to start with me.

425
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:43,371
"Schlegel." Now, next.
Shall I put Mr. Wilcox?

426
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:07,312
- Quite out of the ordinary, you know?
- I know. It's these.

427
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,815
Now. What do you think of that?
And a pretty box.

428
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:13,235
Oh. Yes.
Oh, thank you very much.

429
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,946
- Good. I'm glad.
- You are wonderfully efficient.

430
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,324
- Thank you. Could we
wrap that with a nice bow, please?
- Certainly, madam.

431
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:23,286
- But your name still remains
at the top of the list.
- [Chuckles] Yes.

432
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,288
So, Dolly. There she goes.

433
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:29,543
I would like to give you
something worth your friendship.

434
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,005
Couldn't you get it renewed?

435
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,425
- I beg your pardon?
- The lease of your house?

436
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,011
Oh, have you been thinking of that?
How very kind of you.

437
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:43,640
- Surely something could be done.
- No. Values have risen too enormously.

438
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:46,017
They mean to pull down Wickham Place
and build flats like yours.

439
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,020
- But how horrible.
- Landlords are horrible.

440
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,606
And so are the flats they build.

441
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:57,237
I fail to understand how people
can actually choose to live in them.

442
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,159
There we are.

443
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,412
Oh, dear. There, there we are.
Thank you.

444
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,706
[Chuckles]
Thank you.

445
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,383
Thank you.

446
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,472
[Groans]

447
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,225
Oh, I'm so sorry.
We shouldn't have done this today.

448
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,436
No. No, we had to do it before.

449
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:34,482
- Before?
- Before my operation.

450
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:38,695
I still haven't told my family yet,
Miss Schlegel. Everyone hates illnesses.

451
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,823
Ah, it's as it should be.

452
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:47,037
There's a chestnut tree
at Howards End...

453
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,081
that has pigs' teeth
stuck into the trunk...

454
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,376
about four feet from the ground.

455
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,962
Yes. The teeth of a pig.

456
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,424
The country people
put them there long ago...

457
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:03,511
and they think that if they chew
a piece of the bark...

458
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,807
it will cure the toothache.

459
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:14,147
I love folklore
and the old superstitions.

460
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,608
Isn't it is curious though.
That unlike Greece...

461
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,735
England has no true mythology.

462
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,279
All we have are
witches and fairies.

463
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,323
[Sighs]

464
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,660
Will you come with me to Howards End?

465
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:32,082
- Oh. I would so much like to.
- Come with me now, now.

466
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:36,294
- Now? But it is too late.
- There is a train from St. Pancras
at 5:00 if we hurry.

467
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,672
- I want you to see it.
- And I want to see it.

468
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,092
It sounds such a glorious place.
So redolent and —

469
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,804
Yes, yes. I lived there long,
long before I was married.

470
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,390
I was born there.

471
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,850
Well, might I come some other day?

472
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,604
Yes.

473
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,692
Some other day.

474
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,783
Well. A thousands thanks.
Miss Schlegel. For your help.

475
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:10,161
It is a comfort to have
the presents off my mind...

476
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,789
the Christmas cards especially.

477
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:16,042
- I do admire your choice.
- [Clock Chimes]

478
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:22,090
[Train Whistle]

479
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,433
Whoa.

480
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,450
Mrs. Wilcox.

481
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,494
- Miss Schlegel.
- I will come if I still may.

482
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,080
Return to Hilton. Please.

483
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,876
- We'll stop the night, my dear.
- Yes.

484
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,628
It's in the morning my house
looks most beautiful.

485
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,298
Two returns, please.

486
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,300
Thank you.

487
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:11,014
- This is yours?
- I can't show you my meadow
properly except in the sunrise.

488
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:14,726
- It was so romantic. It was in Italy.
- In Italy?

489
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,312
Yes. And the two trains
stopped on either side. You see...

490
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:20,231
and I opened the window...

491
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,275
and this man just
handed a rose across.

492
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,527
I don't know where he got it.

493
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,738
- Was he Italian?
- Yes, I think so. Italian.

494
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,823
Ah. He'd have to be
Italian, wouldn't he?

495
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:32,202
- Mother!
- Evie. My dearest girl.

496
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:35,580
- The motor's smashed.
- Ruth, what on earth are you doing here?

497
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,582
- We crashed the car.
- What?

498
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,335
- Are you going to Howards End? Why?
- Yes.

499
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,337
- How are you?
- It's such a lovely surprise.

500
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,923
I'm fit as a fiddle.
You remember Miss Schlegel?

501
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,300
Miss Schlegel?
Oh, yes. Helen's sister. Hello.

502
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,221
- Evie crashed the car in Yorkshire.
- How do you do?

503
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,766
We must go home. We can't go
to Howards End. It's ten to 5:00.

504
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:59,187
Miss Schlegel, I'm afraid our little outing
is going to have to be another day.

505
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,313
- Before I forget.
- Thank you.

506
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,067
- There's a German expression for that.
- Aufgeschoben ist nicht aufgehoben.

507
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,611
- Yes. Not canceled, but postponed.
- Postponed.

508
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,780
- Come home with us.
- No, no.

509
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,824
- You sure?
- Please. Good-bye.

510
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:15,203
- Till later.
- [Henry] How lovely to see you.

511
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,178
I've been thinking of you.

512
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,143
And ofour meadow.

513
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,228
Here.

514
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,568
The day you are strong enough...

515
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,362
I shall hold you
to your promise.

516
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,456
Oh, Miss Schlegel.

517
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,205
So, to repeat, we have here...

518
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:08,459
forwarded by the matron
of that nursing home...

519
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,545
sealed and addressed to me...

520
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,091
a note purporting to be
in your mother's handwriting.

521
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,135
And it says...

522
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,179
"I would like Miss Schlegel.
Margaret...

523
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,765
to have Howards End."

524
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,934
Mother never wrote that.

525
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,606
No date.

526
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,442
- No signature.
- Of course.

527
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,028
It's a forgery.

528
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,741
Not now. Please. Later.
Thank you.

529
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,079
The house was of course your mother's
to leave to whom she wished.

530
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,166
Let me see it.

531
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,631
Why, it's only in pencil.
Pencil never counts.

532
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,550
Yes. We know that it is not
legally binding, Dolly.

533
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,761
We are aware of that.

534
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,890
Of course, my dear,
we consideryou as one of the family.

535
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,268
But it will be better if you don't
interfere with what you don't understand.

536
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:11,522
The question is whether...

537
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,484
during the time that this Miss Schlegel
managed to befriend my mother —

538
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,861
I don't think it's a case
of undue influence.

539
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,822
To my mind the question is...

540
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,283
the invalid's condition
when the note was written.

541
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:25,286
My dear father,
consult an expert if you wish...

542
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,955
but I don't admit that it is
my mother's handwriting.

543
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,957
You just said it was.

544
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,502
Never mind if I did.

545
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,216
So we are all agreed then that
legally I would be quite justified...

546
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,301
in tearing this up and
throwing it into the fire.

547
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:46,224
All else aside, how is this gift
to be conveyed to Miss Schlegel?

548
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:49,143
Is she to have a life interest in it
or is she to own it absolutely?

549
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:52,605
She may be on her way down
this very minute to turn us all out.

550
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,568
I don't believe Miss Schlegel
knows anything about this. Uh...

551
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,320
this whim of your mother's.

552
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,573
Mother believed so in ancestors.

553
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,660
She would never have left
anything to an outsider.

554
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:10,206
If Miss Schlegel had been poor.
If she had wanted a house —

555
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,335
But she has a house.
Why should she want another?

556
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:20,675
She wouldn't have wanted us
to even see this thing.

557
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:23,261
No.

558
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:26,389
Your poor mother
would not have wanted it.

559
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:09,557
- Len, you coming in?
- In a minute.

560
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,559
Yeah, all right.

561
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,401
What are you looking at?

562
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:24,614
See that big one up there?
It's Ursa Major. The great bear.

563
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,284
You follow those two down
about four times...

564
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,286
and that one there
is the polestar.

565
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,998
- I'm fairly certain that's it.
And they all go round that one.
- They're just stars.

566
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,417
Jacky. Stop it.
It's important.

567
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,378
You'll catch your death.

568
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,470
[Chattering, Indistinct]

569
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,864
Yes. Sir.

570
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,784
When can I expect
to receive that?

571
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,495
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Purefour's policy.

572
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,497
Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.

573
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,708
That's all signed.
It seems fine with me. Thank you.

574
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,336
So may I expect
to receive that?

575
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,338
Oh, yes.

576
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:27,176
All right, Mr. Jackson.
You're all done.

577
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,564
Could you. Uh,
complete that?

578
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,566
Yes. Of course. Sir.

579
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,966
[Leonard] "The trees
reared in mighty columns...

580
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,428
"their tops still radiant
in sunlight which...

581
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,931
"spilling downward
through the wealth of leaves...

582
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,933
"dissolved at last...

583
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,227
"in the darkness
of the mossy earth.

584
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,441
"Their color slowly faded
from out of the flowers...

585
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:28,029
but their scent lingered
to honey the air he breathed."

586
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,856
There's a woman
to see you. Ma'am.

587
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,275
A woman and not a lady, Annie?

588
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,362
- She won't give her name.
- Well. Ask her to come up.

589
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,322
She says she won't come up.

590
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:14,408
Well, then we shall
have to go down.

591
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,960
- Good afternoon.
- I'm looking for my husband.

592
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,796
Here? Thankyou, Annie.

593
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,966
I have my reasons to believe
that he is here.

594
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,343
[Exhales] Well, you're
welcome to search for him.

595
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,762
I'm so sorry.
Your husband's name?

596
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,473
Leonard Bast.
As I'm sure you're aware of.

597
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,434
Margaret. Are we concealing
a Mr. Leonard Bast?

598
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,897
There appears to have been
some mistake. Mrs. Bast.

599
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,650
I do not think we are acquainted
with your husband.

600
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,860
Oh, no. There's no mistake.

601
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,154
I know for a fact
that he has visited in this house.

602
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,658
- He had his tea here.
- That is a grave allegation.

603
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,536
Yes. To have corrupted
a married man with giving him tea.

604
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,287
I wish we could help you. Mrs. Bast.

605
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,456
It seems you can't...

606
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,208
or won't...

607
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,711
except to have a laugh at my expense.

608
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,838
So I'm very sorry
to have troubled you...

609
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,007
and wish you
a very good afternoon.

610
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:19,348
You do what you can for the house.
The drawing room reeks of smoke.

611
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,434
If you start smoking too,
the house might be even more musty.

612
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,644
I doubt it.

613
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,396
This is lovely. Annie.

614
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,106
There's a Mr. Leonard Bast.

615
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,192
- Oh, no! I don't believe it.
- [Laughing] The missing husband.

616
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,820
- He must be brought in immediately.
- The one you corrupted with tea?

617
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,364
- I'll do the host.
- Thank you.

618
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,908
Mr. Bast, come this way.

619
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,745
Do come in, Mr. Bast.
Good evening.

620
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,997
Good evening. Do come in
and have some pudding with us.

621
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:46,083
- Yes. Or would you prefer some dinner?
- I've had my tea. Thank you.

622
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,794
- Have a chair. A glass of wine?
- No.

623
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,629
- Port?
- No, thank you.

624
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,923
Well. Do take a seat
in any case. Mr. Bast...

625
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,301
and let us know
how we can help you.

626
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,059
You wouldn't remember
giving me this?

627
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,188
- Not as such.
- Well. That was how it happened. You see.

628
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,940
- Uh. What?
- Where did we meet, Mr. Bast?

629
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,567
For the moment.
I don't remember.

630
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:15,863
It was more than a year ago.
At the Ethical Society.

631
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,698
The lecture was
on "Music and Meaning."

632
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,451
Oh, I see. So the mistake arose
out of my card. Did it?

633
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:24,497
The lady who called here yesterday
thought you were calling as well
and that she would find you here.

634
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:29,293
In the afternoon. I said to my wife —
I said to Mrs. Bast —

635
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:33,172
"I have to pay a call on some friends."
And Mrs. Bast said to me. "Do go."

636
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:37,468
But while I was gone, she wanted me
on important business...

637
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:40,387
and thought I had come here.
Owing to the card.

638
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,640
And I beg to tender
my apologies. And hers too...

639
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,850
for any inconvenience
we may have caused you.

640
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,937
- None at all, truly.
- I still don't understand.

641
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,940
When did you say you paid this call.
This afternoon call?

642
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:53,317
In the afternoon, of course.

643
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:55,361
Saturday afternoon or Sunday?

644
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,947
- Saturday.
- Really?

645
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:02,993
And you were still calling on Sunday
when your wife came here? A long visit.

646
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,246
[Margaret] It was very good of you
to come explain, Mr. Bast.

647
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,748
The rest is naturally
no concern of ours.

648
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:11,210
We are going to go upstairs for coffee.
I do hope that you will join us.

649
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:15,422
- Annie. Pour the coffee. Please.
- It's not what you think.

650
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,135
I was —

651
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,222
I left my office and walked...

652
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,349
right out of London.

653
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,518
I was walking
all Saturday night.

654
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:30,646
All night? In the dark?

655
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,523
It got so dark
I couldn't see my own hand.

656
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:36,610
Mr. Bast,
you must be a born explorer.

657
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,197
I tried to steer by the polestar.
But once out of doors...

658
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,907
everything gets so mixed
and I lost it.

659
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,034
Don't tell me about the polestar.
I know its little ways.

660
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,954
It goes round and round,
and you go round with it.

661
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,964
[Helen] Yes, but why?

662
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,800
Why didyou do it?

663
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,552
I wanted to...

664
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,554
just walk...

665
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,931
just get out.

666
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,766
I've been reading
The Ordeal ofRichard Feverel.

667
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,811
Yes, I remember. There's that chapter
where Richard walks all night.

668
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,480
- In a forest by moonlight.
- Yes. Margaret. What's that wonderful —

669
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,483
Oh, I know exactly what you mean.

670
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:20,279
[Both]
"The forest drooped glimmeringly."

671
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,364
Wait, I'll get it.

672
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,450
The chapter's called "Nature Speaks."

673
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:28,204
- Where do your people come from?
- London.

674
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,372
Yes. I know, but I mean before that.

675
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,667
They didn't always
live in a town.

676
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,920
No. They came
from around Shropshire.

677
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,297
They worked on the land.

678
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,049
They were agricultural laborers.

679
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,218
There. You see?

680
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,511
It was ancestral voices calling you.

681
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,933
Yes. Here it is.

682
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,352
"Richard was walking hurriedly.

683
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:55,231
"A pale gray light on the skirts of
the flying tempest displayed the dawn."

684
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,775
- Did you see the dawn?
- Yes, suddenly it got light.

685
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,486
- And was it wonderful?
- No.

686
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,405
- [Laughing]
- It was only gray.

687
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,658
And anyway, by that time
I was so tired and so hungry.

688
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,409
I didn't know when you're walking...

689
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:10,246
you want a breakfast and lunch and tea
during the night as well...

690
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:14,041
- and all I had was a packet ofWoodbines.
- [All Chuckling]

691
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:18,128
[Woman]
No. Money. Give Mr. Bast money.

692
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:21,548
- We really must go. Meg. Come on.
- Don't bother about his ideals.

693
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:25,135
Your Leonard Bast wouldn't know
what to do if you just gave him money.

694
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,847
Nonsense. Money is very educational.
Much more so than the things it buys.

695
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,267
Such crass materialism
out of your mouth, Margaret.

696
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,477
Give them money.
Let us give Mr. Bast money.

697
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,688
[All Chattering, Indistinct]

698
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,816
What if he gained the whole world.
But lost his own soul?

699
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,278
But he won't gain his soul until
he has enough money to do it with.

700
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,821
Give Mr. Bast money.

701
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:47,283
[All Chattering, Indistinct]

702
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,660
Good night.
Yes. Well. You worry about the first.

703
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:52,496
Good-bye. Good-bye.

704
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,999
Thank you.

705
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,001
- Good night.
- Good night.

706
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,882
[Tango]

707
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,975
So what do you think is the most
important thing in the world, then?

708
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,686
Well, I suppose...

709
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,356
- it is whatever matters to you most.
- What, like love, for instance?

710
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,818
- Yes, like love for instance
or Oxford if you're Tibby.
- Miss Schlegel?

711
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,820
- Henry Wilcox.
- Oh, hello.

712
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:27,364
- Hello. Good evening.
- How nice to see you.

713
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,117
What a wonderful surprise.
I heard two ladies talking of love.

714
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:33,871
- [Chuckling] Oh, no.
- No. We were continuing
a serious discussion.

715
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:36,623
- Yes?
- Yes. We belong to a sort of club...

716
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,543
which meets once a week
to discuss various subjects.

717
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:43,547
How are you? I would've thought
you would be down at Howards End.

718
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:46,258
Howards End is let.
We've bought a house in Mayfair.

719
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,594
Yes. Mr. Wilcox, supposing
you were a millionaire.

720
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,180
Oh, but I expect you are one.
[Chuckles]

721
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:55,559
We have met a young man who is very poor
and we think sensitive and intelligent...

722
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:58,979
and we wondered if one was a millionaire
how one could help him.

723
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:01,815
- What's his profession?
- He's a clerk in — What was it. Margaret?

724
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,693
- The Porphyrion Fire I nsurance Company.
- I nsurance.

725
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,404
- Porphyrion?
- Yes.

726
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:10,157
Ah, then Miss Schlegel...

727
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,242
if I were to help
your young clerk...

728
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:15,204
I'd advise him to clear out of
the Porphyrion with all possible speed.

729
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,206
- Why?
- Now, this is between friends...

730
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,209
but the Porphyrion is
insufficiently reinsured.

731
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,419
It'll be in the receivers' hands
before Christmas.

732
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,338
In other words. It will smash.

733
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:27,091
Do you hear? Helen.
The Porphyrion will smash.

734
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,301
We'll have to warn Mr. Bast.
He'll have to get another place.

735
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:32,888
- I hope he'll get one very quickly.
- But rather than wait to make sure?

736
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:35,933
Yes. Decidedly. You understand.
The man who is already in a situation...

737
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:37,935
when he applies for work...

738
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,937
stands a much better chance. Naturally.

739
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,022
This is letting you
into state secrets, of course...

740
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:45,567
but, uh. It does affect
an employer greatly.

741
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,277
Human nature, I'm afraid.

742
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,696
Well. Our human nature appears
to be quite the other way around.

743
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:52,449
We employ people
because they're unemployed —

744
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,660
- The bootman, for instance.
- How does he clean the boots?

745
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,662
- Not well.
- There you are.

746
00:56:56,746 --> 00:57:00,416
Mr. Wilcox, is it very difficult nowadays
for a clerk to get a situation?

747
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,293
- Yes. Extremely.
- I'm so sorry about Howards End.

748
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:06,046
- Hmm?
- I mean that you're not living there.

749
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:11,135
I think I have some idea of how much
her house meant to Mrs. Wilcox.

750
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:14,096
Yes. But to us. The family.
It has certain drawbacks.

751
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:18,475
Would you be able to help?
Our friend. Help him to a new situation?

752
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,479
Well, unfortunately. We have very few
positions and vacancies.

753
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,606
And when there is one. Of course...

754
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,901
- always hundreds of applicants.
- Of course.

755
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,903
- It has been a pleasure. Miss Schlegel.
- Yes, indeed.

756
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:33,490
Miss Schlegel. I hope
your young clerk finds success.

757
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,869
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

758
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,538
Well, he was in a hurry
to get away. Wasn't he?

759
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,628
- Ah. Wilcox.
- What was all that about?

760
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,675
Mr. Bast...

761
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,845
I fear you may have thought
our letter a little odd.

762
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,723
We're not odd. Really.
We're just over-expressive. That's all.

763
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:01,018
The more a lady has to say, the better.
Ladies brighten every conversation.

764
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:05,272
Yes. I know. The darlings are regular
sunbeams. Let me give you a plate.

765
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:11,028
Your company is the Porphyrion. Isn't it?
Would you call it a solid concern?

766
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:14,573
Cake? This big one
or one of these little deadlies?

767
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,159
It depends what you mean by solid.

768
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,745
We were told the Porphyrion's a no-go.

769
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,623
A friend of ours did think...

770
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:26,710
- that it's insufficiently reinsured.
- And advised you to clear out.

771
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:30,881
- You can tell your friend that he's wrong.
- Oh. Good! [Chuckling]

772
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:33,300
Wrong. So to speak.

773
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:36,053
How, so to speak?

774
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,138
I mean, I wouldn't say
he was right altogether.

775
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,307
Then he is right partly?

776
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:44,603
Tell your friend to mind
his own business.

777
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,980
- [Knocking, Door Opens]
- Annie.

778
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,816
Mr. Wilcox, Miss Wilcox.

779
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,860
Oh.

780
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,905
- What a surprise!
- [Helen Laughing]

781
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:57,950
Oh, they're beautiful.

782
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:02,246
- Mr. Wilcox. Do come in.
- Miss Schlegel, pray forgive us
for calling so unexpectedly.

783
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:07,501
- Mr. Bast. Come play with puppies.
- Mr. Wilcox. This is Mr. Bast.

784
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,670
- Aren't they beautiful?
- I must be going.

785
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,672
Oh, must you really?

786
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:12,881
Oh, come again.

787
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,175
No. I shan't. I shan't come again.

788
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:20,973
I call that a very rude remark. What do
you want to turn on me like that for?

789
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,434
I thought you invited me here as —
for a friendly chat.

790
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:27,187
Instead it turns out you want to pick
my brains about my place of business.

791
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,773
Oh. Yes. "Send for him.
Cross-question him. Pick his brains."

792
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,859
- No. No!
- Are we intruding, Miss Schlegel?
Shall we go?

793
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,195
No. No. Thank you.

794
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,698
Helen, go after him. Explain.

795
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:47,749
- What was all that about?
- I knew I shouldn't have come.

796
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,294
It was all right last time,
but things like that always get spoiled.

797
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,879
Things do. But people don't.

798
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,464
Don't you understand?

799
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,842
We really did want to warn you
about the Porphyrion.

800
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,219
We were worried about you.

801
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:02,973
- Why should you worry about me?
- Because we like you.

802
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:06,518
That's why...

803
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,478
you noodle.

804
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:13,859
- There's no cause to call a person names.
- Yes. There is when a person is being
tremendously stupid.

805
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:17,154
[Sighs]
Oh, listen. This is serious.

806
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:20,157
Our friend said you should be
looking around for another post now...

807
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,867
before anything happens.

808
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,119
- Will you?
- I'll think about it.

809
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:26,330
No. You must do more than think.

810
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:30,250
You must search for another place
while you still have one.

811
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:34,671
Now, promise you will
do that at least. Please.

812
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:38,091
All right. Thank you.
Miss Schlegel.

813
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,638
Come and tell us when you've found
another place, or just come anyway.

814
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:45,891
And don't say no.
Don't dare to say no.

815
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:50,729
And don't forget your umbrella
or you'll say we pinched it.

816
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,572
You ought to be more careful. Miss Schlegel.

817
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,824
Your servants ought to have orders
not to let such people in.

818
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,910
Oh, but we invited him in.

819
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:08,664
Yes. We wanted to see him again,
and talk to him and maybe help him...

820
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,875
- not only in a practical way.
- You're too kind.

821
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:15,045
You behave too well to people
and then they impose on you.

822
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,089
I know the world and that type of man.

823
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,174
Oh, but he is not a type. Mr. Wilcox.

824
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:22,719
- [Chuckles]
- No. I think he is a quite
unusualyoung man.

825
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:25,138
And he has something in him.
I don't know what it is.

826
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:28,558
Except that he wants
something better than he's got.

827
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:31,019
- Oh.
- Yes.

828
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,188
He has a sort of romantic ambition.

829
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,984
It is your view of him
that is romantic. Miss Schlegel.

830
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,782
Evie.

831
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,535
We wish you to have something
to remember Mrs. Wilcox by...

832
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:48,704
in return for your kindness
to her in those days.

833
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,957
Oh, thank you so much.

834
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,875
What a lovely thought.
Thank you.

835
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,461
She would want you to have it.
She spoke very fondly of you.

836
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,840
It's beautiful.
Are you sure?

837
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:02,634
Is it 18th century?
It must be crystal.

838
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,803
Thank you. Thank you. Evie.

839
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,934
- So what does she look like?
- A sort of an old-maid type.

840
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:12,936
Goodness knows why Father
wanted me to ask her.

841
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,730
She talks and talks —
Here she is.

842
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,774
- Miss Schlegel.
- Hello. Miss Wilcox.

843
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,235
How do you do?
This is my fiance, Percy Cahill.

844
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,987
How do you do?

845
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:28,034
- Ah, good afternoon.
- Hello. I didn't expect to see you.

846
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:31,121
Well. Evie told me of her little plot,
so I just slipped in and secured a table.

847
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,622
Always secure a table first.
Evie, sit there.

848
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,625
- Miss Schlegel. If you please. Here.
- Thank you very much.

849
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,503
Mr. Cahill, there.

850
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:42,549
Well, are you still worrying around
after your young clerks?

851
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,968
- I hope you're hungry.
- Famished. I want to eat heaps.

852
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:47,095
Good. What will you have?

853
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,973
- Fish pie.
- Ah. Fish pie.

854
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:53,560
Fancy coming for fish pie to Simpson's.
It's not a good thing to go for here.

855
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,563
- Go for something for me then.
- Right. Uh...

856
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:01,026
roast beef and
Yorkshire pudding and...

857
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,778
- What will you have?
- Cider to drink.

858
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,613
- That's the type of thing to go for.
- I'll have trout.

859
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,615
I like this place for a joke
once in a while.

860
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,742
It's so thoroughly old English.
Don't you agree?

861
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,914
I began an inventory
of our possessions.

862
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:16,041
There are over 300 things
in the drawing room alone —

863
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,793
Oh, thank you. Lovely.

864
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:21,254
And that's not counting the books.
Whatever shall I do?

865
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:24,341
- You see, modern ownership ofmoveables...
- [Whispering] I told you.

866
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:26,551
- Is reducing us again to a nomadic hoard.
- How awful.

867
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,596
We are reverting to a civilization
of luggage, Mr. Wilcox.

868
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,516
- [Chuckling]
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Sir.

869
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,727
Always tip the carver.
Tip everywhere is my motto.

870
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,397
- Perhaps it does make life more human.
- Then these fellows remember one again.

871
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,983
Especially in the East.
If you tip. They remember you
from year's end to year's end.

872
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,945
- Have you been in the East?
- Yes, Greece and the Levant.

873
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:47,864
I used to go for sport
and business to Cyprus.

874
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,951
A few piastres properly distributed
help to keep one's memory green.

875
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:54,371
- [Margaret] How shockingly cynical.
- Not a bit. Simply realistic.

876
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:55,997
Excuse me. Sir.
How would you like your beef done?

877
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,749
- Well done.
- Well done.

878
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:02,629
You don't like cheese.
You never take cheese.

879
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,631
- Percy, I adore cheese.
- You said you didn't like it.

880
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:08,218
That's the most despicable lie. Percy.
You've gone quite pink.

881
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:11,179
- I haven't gone pink.
- Your ears have gone pink about the tips.

882
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,889
- I have not.
- [Henry] Evie, I like that.

883
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,600
Miss Schlegel expects me to act
as house agent for her.

884
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:19,688
[Chuckling]
I want a new home in September.
And someone must find it. I can't.

885
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:21,648
Do you know of anything, Percy?

886
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:23,400
Can't say I do.

887
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:25,819
I wish you would give us Howards End.

888
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:32,701
- Howards End, I'm afraid, is let.
- Can't you turn out your tenant
and let it to us?

889
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:34,286
No.

890
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,790
[Sighs]
We're nearly demented.

891
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,710
Mr. Wilcox, I am demented.

892
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:47,883
One bit of advice: Fix your district.
Fix your price, then don't budge.

893
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,969
That's how I got Ducie Street
and Oniton.

894
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,598
Well, I shall, uh —

895
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:57,142
I shall look around a bit for you.

896
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,895
- Would you?
- Yes.

897
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,856
- Wouldyou really? How kind.
- Yes.

898
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,650
But I warn you.
The house has not been built...

899
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,903
that would suit the Schlegel family.

900
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,614
- It's no fun trying to help us.
- Fun?

901
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,616
No. But it's a pleasure
and a privilege...

902
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,035
to do whatever I can
for Miss Margaret Schlegel.

903
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:19,664
Thank you very much.

904
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,083
[Henry]
Dear Miss Schlegel...

905
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,294
dare I intrude
on your holiday in Devon...

906
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:26,296
and request you
to come up to London...

907
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,924
where, I may add,
you are greatly missed?

908
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,926
Matter is ofsome urgency.

909
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:35,138
But to interrupt your holiday.
Dear Margaret...

910
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:37,766
and before we have
undertaken our excursions.

911
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:40,477
You haven't been
to Nine Barrows Downs.

912
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:43,438
I know. Aunt Juley,
But I shall be back before long.

913
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:45,607
Let me go up to town today...

914
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,734
and take the house
if it's the least bit possible.

915
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:49,736
I don't understand.
Whose house is this?

916
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,155
Mr. Wilcox's, Tibby.
You are being remarkably obtuse.

917
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:54,157
Are you doing it on purpose?

918
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:56,201
Look. "Owing to
changed circumstances" —

919
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,703
He means that Evie's getting married.
That's his daughter.

920
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,957
"I no longer have need
for a London house of this size...

921
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,167
and am willing to let it
on a yearly tenancy."

922
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:07,087
- That's perfect.
- Out of all our hotel acquaintances...

923
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:11,299
Mr. Wilcox is the only one who's stuck,
yet we've met far more interesting people.

924
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:14,010
Interesting people
don't get one houses.

925
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,554
I shall never forget
that dreadful motor driver...

926
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,556
that perfectly dreadful Charles.

927
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:22,769
My one consolation is that for once
I was able to be useful to you girls.

928
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:25,271
Thank you. Aunt Juley.

929
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:29,317
And now it is
my turn to be useful.

930
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,604
This is the ballroom.

931
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,024
Goodness. Oh.

932
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,736
- Like it?
- Rather!

933
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:16,322
Even I know a good thing
when I see it.

934
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:23,705
Yes. But nowadays, with. Uh,
Evie always out with her fiance...

935
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:26,583
when I get home in the evenings.
I tell you I can't stand the place.

936
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:29,836
- It would be very lonely for you.
- Yes.

937
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,673
Do you ever get lonely, Miss Schlegel?

938
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,675
I soon shall, horribly.

939
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:39,679
It's heartbreaking
to leave one's old home.

940
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:44,184
Goodness. How high
this ceiling must be.

941
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:47,437
H mm?
Yes. It must be over 30 feet.

942
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:50,356
No. Maybe 40, I should think.

943
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,609
Perhaps even more.

944
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,865
Miss Schlegel. Uh...

945
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:01,493
I've had you here
on false pretenses.

946
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,579
I want to speak on a much more
serious matter than the house.

947
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:08,208
Uh...

948
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:15,048
do you think you could
be induced to share?

949
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:17,509
I mean, is it at all
probable that —

950
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,886
Oh, yes. I see.

951
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:28,645
Miss Schlegel.

952
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:30,814
Margaret.

953
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:34,400
- I don't think you quite understand.
- Oh, yes. I ndeed. Yes.

954
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:40,031
- I'm asking you to be my wife.
- Yes. I know. I know.

955
01:08:40,115 --> 01:08:43,076
- Are you offended?
- How could I be?

956
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,161
Well, perhaps I should've written first.

957
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:49,082
No. No. Rather, you will
receive a letter from me.

958
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:51,084
- Thankyou.
- Not at all.

959
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:52,794
And it's you I thank.

960
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:57,257
Uh...

961
01:08:58,425 --> 01:09:00,927
should I order
the motor round now?

962
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,056
That would be most kind.

963
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:35,420
[Charles] Warning you, Evie,
she will never set foot in this house!

964
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,923
- [Evie] It's not my fault!
- Of course it's your fault.

965
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:41,467
Going around hobnobbing
with those Schlegel girls.

966
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:43,887
- Girls? They're hardly girls.
- [Thunder Rumbling]

967
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:47,891
I never dreamt of such a thing.
Dad took me to call...

968
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:50,852
and then made me
ask her to Simpson's, that's all.

969
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:52,645
Well, I'm altogether off Dad.

970
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:56,065
- [Baby Crying]
- You've woken didums. I knew you would.

971
01:09:56,150 --> 01:10:00,612
Well. Miss Schlegel's
fairly got us on toast.

972
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:03,865
You know. She always meant
to get hold of Howards End.

973
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:06,910
Now. Thanks to you. She's got it.

974
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:10,580
- I call that most unfair.
- Oh. Evie.

975
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:12,582
Why don't you pretend
to break off your engagement?

976
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:16,127
Then perhaps your father will
also quarrel with Miss Schlegel.

977
01:10:16,211 --> 01:10:20,298
- Stop talking nonsense, darling.
- I'm jolly well going to get married
as soon as possible.

978
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:24,344
- And Dad can do what he likes.
- She's taking Mother's place.

979
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:30,183
- The idea!
- I could simply scratch
that woman's eyes out.

980
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:33,436
- Toto. Toto, play.
- Come on, Dolly.

981
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,272
I'll have a try.
Come on.

982
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:38,691
Well, it's no use talking.

983
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:41,861
We're in a bad hole
and must make the best of it.

984
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:46,616
But I'll keep my eye
on those Schlegels.

985
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,243
And if I find them putting on airs...

986
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:52,497
- with their artistic beastliness...
- [Baby Continues Crying]

987
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,499
I intend to put my foot down.

988
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:58,252
- Yes, firmly.
- [Thunderclap]

989
01:11:13,268 --> 01:11:15,812
[Henry]
I've had a letter too. Not a nice one.

990
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:17,814
I want to talk it over with you.

991
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:21,609
My letter is about Howards End.
The tenants have decamped.

992
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:25,446
And what is worse, he's trying
to sublet the house, Margaret.

993
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,157
Here, he's trying to sublet the house.
What are you laughing at?

994
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:30,159
Henry...

995
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,412
you haven't had a chance
for a talk with Helen yet, have you?

996
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:35,331
- What do you mean, a talk with her?
- Well, do before you go.

997
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,208
- Why? What's the matter?
- Oh. Nothing.

998
01:11:37,292 --> 01:11:41,129
- I'm just anxious you two should be friends.
- We've always hit it off together.

999
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:43,172
- [Margaret] Shh.
- Well, we do.

1000
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:45,550
There's no clause in the agreement
to allow subletting.

1001
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:48,136
There you are. Read it yourself.
That's awfully jolly.

1002
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,431
- Thank you.
- Yes. Especially that. Foxgloves.

1003
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:53,433
Yes. Dear old digitalis.

1004
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:57,103
- Digitalis, sounds like a sneeze.
- [Chuckling]

1005
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:02,525
- Margaret! Such nice news from Mr. Bast.
- Really? Good.

1006
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:05,069
Here we all are then.

1007
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:08,698
- Mr. Bast is now with Dempster's Bank.
That's his news.
- Good.

1008
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:11,868
Thanks to your hint,
he cleared out of the Porphyrion.

1009
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:14,412
Not a bad business, the Porphyrion.

1010
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,831
Margaret. I shall have to go
to Howards End and take charge.

1011
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:19,542
- And I would like you to come with me.
- Not a bad business?

1012
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:22,336
- Yes, I would like that very much.
- Good. What about tomorrow?

1013
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:25,214
- Tomorrow? Oh. No. I couldn't well do that.
- Why not?

1014
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,383
You told us the Porphyrion
would smash before Christmas.

1015
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,093
Did I? Yes.

1016
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,554
Well. It was outside
the tariff ring at the time.

1017
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:33,556
Took some rather bad policies.

1018
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,809
But, uh. Lately, it came in.
Safe as houses now.

1019
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:38,561
What's wrong with tomorrow?

1020
01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:40,730
Aunt Juley would be
so disappointed if I left now.

1021
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:45,318
- Didn't Mr. Wilcox clearly tell us
that the Porphyrion would —
- Yes, let's talk about it later, shall we?

1022
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:49,405
- Henry, Aunt Juley regards
this visit as a high solemnity —
- It turns out that it's safe as houses.

1023
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,574
And Mr. Bast need never have left
and taken another post...

1024
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:54,827
- at a greatly reduced salary.
- My dear Helen.

1025
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,413
I grieve for your clerk, I really do.

1026
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:59,499
But it is all part
of the battle of life.

1027
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,084
- Battle of life?
- Yes.

1028
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:03,211
A man who had little money
has less. Owing to us.

1029
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:06,172
Oh, come, come. You're not to blame.
No one is to blame.

1030
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:09,592
- No one? Is no one to blame for anything?
- I didn't say that.

1031
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:12,512
- You take things far too seriously.
- [AuntJuley] Margaret.

1032
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:13,805
There's your aunt.
I'll go and have a word with her.

1033
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,349
- [AuntJuley] Margaret!
- Helen.

1034
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:19,018
Helen, a word of advice.

1035
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,853
I require no more advice.

1036
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:24,273
Don't take up a sentimental
attitude over the poor.

1037
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,025
See that she doesn't, Margaret.

1038
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:30,488
The poor are poor.
One is sorry for them, but there it is.

1039
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,199
I'll talk to Aunt Juley about tomorrow.
Don't you bother.

1040
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:35,701
[Aunt Juley]
Girls, aren't you cold?

1041
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:41,833
Helen, I am very sorry about Mr. Bast.
But you must be civil to Henry.

1042
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:46,295
- You yourself are a witness.
- Yes, I know there may be another side
to this question.

1043
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:50,633
But Henry is my future husband...

1044
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:52,885
and I must be on his side.

1045
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,182
Why are you so bitter, dearie?

1046
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:01,435
- Hmm?
- Because I'm an old maid.

1047
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,188
Oh, Helen.

1048
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,232
No. Darling.

1049
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,362
Helen!

1050
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:16,325
- Margaret will explain.
- Margaret. Magsy.

1051
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:18,828
If it isn't true surely
what Mr. Wilcox is saying...

1052
01:14:18,912 --> 01:14:21,914
- that you want to go away tomorrow?
- Yes, we must leave tomorrow.

1053
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:24,584
[Henry]
I have business at Howards End...

1054
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:27,420
and my business is now also,
unfortunately, my Margaret's.

1055
01:14:27,504 --> 01:14:30,298
[Margaret] So we'll go
for our walk now. See you at tea time.

1056
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:33,176
Unless it rains. In which case.
We'll see you a great deal sooner. Bye.

1057
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,469
Have a good walk.

1058
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:50,860
- Yes. That's him.
- [Margaret] So this is the famous office?

1059
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:53,237
- What?
- I'd expected something more African.

1060
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,239
Oh, heavens. No.
[Laughs]

1061
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:59,744
Spears, animal skins and that sort of thing.
But I suppose this is the imperial part...

1062
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:02,163
of the Imperial and West African
Rubber Company.

1063
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:04,874
Yes. We haven't settled the question
of the London house, have we?

1064
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:07,126
- Well. It all depends, doesn't it?
- On what?

1065
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,545
- When do you want to marry me?
- [Chuckles] How you do fly around.

1066
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:13,299
- My head's in a whirl. Let's dance!
- [Both Laughing]

1067
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:16,010
- [Margaret] Be careful!
- [Henry Vocalizing]

1068
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:21,265
- Oh, Charles.
- I hope that my wife —

1069
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,559
How do you do —
will give you a decent lunch...

1070
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:25,811
after you've had a good look
at Howards End.

1071
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,731
I can hardly wait to see it,
although I almost feel I have.

1072
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:30,942
I don't know
in what state you'll find it.

1073
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:35,863
The tenant decamped without even arranging
for a charwoman to clear up after him.

1074
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:39,659
- Oh, dear.
- Yes. I've more than a little bone
to pick with that tenant.

1075
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:43,287
- Margaret, here's an idea.
- Yes?

1076
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:46,958
Why don't we use Howards End to store
your furniture from Wickham Place...

1077
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,043
tillyou decide what to do with it?

1078
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:51,504
- Oh, wouldyou? Wouldyou really?
- Good idea?

1079
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:53,506
Oh, how kind.

1080
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:56,133
Only until Helen and Tibby
are settled of course, Charles.

1081
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:02,515
I hope you won't be disappointed.
It's quite a measly little place.

1082
01:16:02,599 --> 01:16:06,644
- Never really suited us.
- Heavens, no.

1083
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:31,794
[Dolly Coughs]

1084
01:16:31,878 --> 01:16:33,796
- Oh. It's lovely.
- Margaret.

1085
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,548
- Oh. Dear.
- What?

1086
01:16:35,632 --> 01:16:37,550
- I seem to have forgotten the keys.
- What?

1087
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:39,802
- I've lost the keys.
- Crane. We'll have to go back.

1088
01:16:39,886 --> 01:16:41,512
- Won't you leave me here?
- You sure?

1089
01:16:41,596 --> 01:16:45,099
Yes, yes. I'll wait for you. Dolly.
Have a nice glass of milk at the farm.

1090
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:49,729
Henry. See that she gets a nice glass
of milk. I'll walk around in the garden.

1091
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:54,608
[Margaret] Good-bye.

1092
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,861
- Why did you forget the key?
- I'm sorry. I don't know.

1093
01:16:56,945 --> 01:17:00,656
- Where did you leave it?
- Well. It could be with didums.

1094
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,658
[Indistinct]

1095
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:23,489
[Thumping]

1096
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,997
Hello?

1097
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:36,710
I took you for Ruth Wilcox.

1098
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:39,380
I, like Mrs. Wilcox?

1099
01:18:41,007 --> 01:18:43,384
You have her way of walking...

1100
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:46,554
round the house.

1101
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:35,394
[Chuckles]

1102
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:41,984
Henry!

1103
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:43,986
Henry, I've found the teeth.

1104
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,988
- Yes, what?
- The pigs' teeth.

1105
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:49,033
- Teeth? Where?
- The pigs' teeth in the bark.

1106
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:51,285
Yes. look. Just here.

1107
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:53,704
You see? Four feet up.

1108
01:19:53,788 --> 01:19:55,789
- How extraordinary.
- Yes, and you chew the bark...

1109
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:58,501
- to cure the toothache.
- What a rum notion.

1110
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:00,294
Surely, you knew that.

1111
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:03,631
Did that silly old Miss Avery
give you a fright. Margaret?

1112
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:06,342
None of you girls has any nerve.
[Laughing]

1113
01:20:06,426 --> 01:20:08,761
Did you take her for a spook?
She's very odd.

1114
01:20:08,845 --> 01:20:11,222
She carries on as if
she owned Howards End.

1115
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:13,224
Miss Avery has always
lived on the place?

1116
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:16,185
Yes. She grew up there
on the farm like Mrs. Wilcox.

1117
01:20:16,269 --> 01:20:19,897
Weren't she and Mrs. Wilcox friends
when Howards End too was a farm?

1118
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:23,484
They do say that Mrs. Wilcox
had a brother, or was it an uncle?

1119
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:27,530
Anyhow, he popped the question.
And Miss Avery. She said no.

1120
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:31,450
Just imagine if she'd said yes.
She'd have been Charles's aunt.

1121
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:34,578
Oh, I say, that's rather good.
Charlie's aunt.

1122
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:36,622
I must chaff him about that.

1123
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,835
[Dolly]
She's so mad about Howards End.

1124
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,297
Goodness knows what she'll do when
your furniture gets there, Margaret.

1125
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:47,716
She might fling it all out.

1126
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:50,469
Or she might simply adopt it
for Howards End.

1127
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:38,350
Excuse me. Sir. Where would I go
to inquire about a position?

1128
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,519
What position
would that be, sir?

1129
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:42,563
I heard there was one.

1130
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:44,565
Not at this time.

1131
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,842
I thought it was you.
How do you do?

1132
01:22:11,926 --> 01:22:15,304
Why did you never come
to see us again? You promised.

1133
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:17,681
But this isn't your bank.
You took a situation with Dempster's.

1134
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,684
- I lost it.
- Sorry?

1135
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:23,187
I lost the situation.

1136
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:25,773
They cut back on their staff and
the last to join, like me...

1137
01:22:25,857 --> 01:22:27,900
were the first to be let go.

1138
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:30,819
I've been inquiring
for another place here.

1139
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:33,364
The way they look at you
when you come to ask.

1140
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:37,159
They're sure you've stolen something or why else
would any decent person be out of work?

1141
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:39,078
- It's our fault.
- No.

1142
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:42,373
No. We made you leave the Porphyrion.
I and my sister and Mr. Wilcox...

1143
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:45,459
who is at this very moment
celebrating his daughter's wedding...

1144
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:47,002
at his castle in Shropshire...

1145
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,129
with the maximum expense
and ostentation. Of course.

1146
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,131
I could murder him!

1147
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:55,469
"Murder will out, it is most foul."

1148
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:58,389
How have you been, Miss Schlegel?
Any interesting lectures?

1149
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:02,351
You know. He jolly well
owes you a situation.

1150
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:08,607
[Margaret] What nice houses you have
all over the place. I like this one too.

1151
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:11,694
[Henry] Oniton Grange.
Waiting to get it offmy hands.

1152
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:13,696
- Why?
- Well, what is one to do?

1153
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,948
The shooting is bad
and the fishing is even worse.

1154
01:23:16,032 --> 01:23:18,450
Anyway, it's in the wrong
part ofShropshire.

1155
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:21,036
Henry, are these all Wilcoxes?

1156
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:22,746
Heavens, no.

1157
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,748
I bought the place
lock, stock and barrel.

1158
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:28,293
The fellow just took the money
and cleared off to Italy, I think.

1159
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:30,713
I'm told some of these are rather good.
What do you think?

1160
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:32,756
- I think they're lovely.
- Rather good, isn't it?

1161
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,758
- Which one?
- Top one.

1162
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:37,594
- Yes, very grand. It's rather like you.
- [Chuckles]

1163
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:41,598
So, I'll show you the cellar.

1164
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,937
- It's very damp. Isn't it?
- [Chattering, Laughing]

1165
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:54,737
- Uh. Do you have enough ice now?
- Yes. Sir.

1166
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:56,447
- Second orders?
- Yes. Sir.

1167
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,574
- Good. All right.
- Good afternoon.

1168
01:23:58,658 --> 01:24:01,118
- It's this way.
- Right.

1169
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:03,162
Thank you.

1170
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:07,958
It is difficult to decide what to do
about the children. Yes. Here we are.

1171
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:11,587
Charles, as the eldest.
Will someday have Howards End.

1172
01:24:11,671 --> 01:24:13,672
I'm just anxious not to be
unjust to the others.

1173
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:15,841
Of course not.
You mean money?

1174
01:24:15,925 --> 01:24:18,260
- Yes, money. Since you put it so frankly.
- Goodness.

1175
01:24:18,344 --> 01:24:20,679
We'll never get through all this wine.

1176
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:23,098
- How much have you got?
- What?

1177
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,309
How much have you got
a year? I have 600.

1178
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:27,311
My income?

1179
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,730
- Don't you know your income? [Laughing]
- Of course I do.

1180
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:32,399
Don't you want to tell it me?

1181
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:35,110
Do it this way. If you were to
divide your income into 10 parts...

1182
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:38,530
how many parts would you give
to Charles. To Evie and to Paul?

1183
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:41,617
Go ahead. Give away
all you can. Be generous.

1184
01:24:41,701 --> 01:24:43,619
You don't beat
about the bush, do you?

1185
01:24:43,703 --> 01:24:46,163
- [Chuckles]
- No.

1186
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:02,221
[Charles] I suppose she'll get her hands
on this place as well as Howards End.

1187
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:05,307
It's only her furniture
that's gone there.

1188
01:25:05,391 --> 01:25:07,893
That's the thin edge
of the wedge.

1189
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:14,858
I don't know what's to happen to us, Dolly.
Two children to bring up.

1190
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:18,529
Charles, you are pleased
about the baby. Aren't you?

1191
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:22,324
What?
Oh, pleased as punch.

1192
01:25:23,326 --> 01:25:25,994
Pleased as punch.

1193
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:32,835
Though it's not
going to be easy.

1194
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:36,797
The pater wants to be fair.
But money isn't elastic.

1195
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:39,508
What if Evie has a family?

1196
01:25:39,592 --> 01:25:41,635
- Or the pater himself?
- [Chuckles]

1197
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:43,637
- What?
- Shh.

1198
01:25:48,142 --> 01:25:50,102
Who's there?

1199
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:54,982
Saxon or Celt?

1200
01:26:01,281 --> 01:26:03,282
[All Chattering]

1201
01:26:10,456 --> 01:26:13,584
Evie! Good-bye!

1202
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,838
Good-bye!

1203
01:26:17,922 --> 01:26:20,382
It went like clockwork.

1204
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:23,552
"Quite like a Durbar."
Lady Edser said.

1205
01:26:23,636 --> 01:26:26,972
Ah. You did awfully well.

1206
01:26:27,056 --> 01:26:30,350
I'm very proud of you.
Thank you.

1207
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:32,644
It was very successful.

1208
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:34,730
- [Henry] Who are those people?
- [Margaret] Well...

1209
01:26:34,814 --> 01:26:37,649
perhaps they're townspeople
come to see the wedding presents.

1210
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:41,069
If you'll gracefully vanish,
I'll deal with them.

1211
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:52,414
What is it?
What's wrong? Is Tibby ill?

1212
01:26:52,498 --> 01:26:54,333
They're starving!
I found them starving!

1213
01:26:54,417 --> 01:26:56,335
- Who's starving?
- The Basts.

1214
01:26:56,419 --> 01:26:58,670
He's lost his place because he's been
turned out of Dempster's bank.

1215
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:01,882
They reduced their staff,
and he was the first to go.

1216
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:03,842
Yes. Thanks to us, he's done for.

1217
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:05,761
- We've ruined him.
- Are you mad?

1218
01:27:05,845 --> 01:27:08,180
If you like. I'm mad.
But I'll stand for this no longer!

1219
01:27:08,264 --> 01:27:11,600
Two people starving.
And meanwhile all this vulgar show!

1220
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:19,066
Helen. Have you actually
brought two starving people...

1221
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:23,362
- from London to Shropshire?
- There was a restaurant car on the train.

1222
01:27:23,446 --> 01:27:26,573
Don't be absurd. I won't have
theatrical nonsense. How dare you?

1223
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:29,409
Yes, how dare you! Bursting
into Evie's wedding in this way.

1224
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:32,788
My goodness. But you've
a perverted notion of philanthropy.

1225
01:27:32,872 --> 01:27:35,791
Look at them.
They think it's some vulgar scandal...

1226
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:39,211
and I must explain, "Oh, no.
It's only my sister screaming...

1227
01:27:39,295 --> 01:27:42,381
and only two hangers-on of ours whom she has
brought here for no conceivable reason."

1228
01:27:42,465 --> 01:27:45,550
We want to see Mr. Wilcox.

1229
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:51,556
Mr. Bast, this is an odd business.
What view do you take of it?

1230
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:53,809
- There is Mrs. Bast too.
- Yes. How do you do?

1231
01:27:53,893 --> 01:27:55,978
- How do you do?
- She's not well.

1232
01:27:56,062 --> 01:27:58,730
- She fainted on the train.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1233
01:27:58,815 --> 01:28:01,483
- Won't you sit down for a minute?
- I'm sure we don't wish to intrude.

1234
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:03,819
But you have been so kind
in the past, you and your sister.

1235
01:28:03,903 --> 01:28:07,406
- My sister has put you in a false position, I'm afraid.
- Jacky. Let's go.

1236
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:09,408
Please. Helen. Offer them something.

1237
01:28:09,492 --> 01:28:13,328
Mrs. Bast. Please.
Won't you have something to eat, please?

1238
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:23,213
Now, Helen. I would like
to do something for them.

1239
01:28:23,297 --> 01:28:26,133
- Because I agree, we are in some way responsible.
- Via Mr. Wilcox.

1240
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:30,721
Let me tell you once and for all. If you take up
that attitude, I'll do nothing. So choose.

1241
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:37,519
If you promise to take them
to the hotel quietly as my guests...

1242
01:28:37,603 --> 01:28:40,272
then I will speak to Henry
about finding work for Mr. Bast.

1243
01:28:40,356 --> 01:28:45,527
In my own way. Mind. There is to be
no more of this absurd screaming.

1244
01:28:45,611 --> 01:28:49,239
- Well?
- All right. I promise.

1245
01:28:49,323 --> 01:28:51,825
Very well. Take them off
to the George. Then, and I'll try.

1246
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:53,827
But, Helen...

1247
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,497
you have been
most self-indulgent.

1248
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:59,875
You have less restraint,
rather than more. As you get older.

1249
01:28:59,959 --> 01:29:02,252
Think it over. Helen...

1250
01:29:02,336 --> 01:29:04,254
and alter yourself...

1251
01:29:04,338 --> 01:29:06,965
or we shan't have happy lives.

1252
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:13,472
[Chattering]

1253
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:16,308
Let's eat some cake, shall we?

1254
01:29:16,392 --> 01:29:18,769
[Band]

1255
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:27,778
[Helen] Mr. Wilcox has provided
all sorts of delicious things.

1256
01:29:31,365 --> 01:29:33,784
How about
some strawberries?

1257
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:41,917
[Leonard]
Sorry. Excuse me.

1258
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:44,836
- Now I must see to getting some rooms.
- No. We don't want to be any trouble.

1259
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:46,922
- We should come with you.
- Len —

1260
01:29:47,006 --> 01:29:49,925
- Perhaps you'd like to stay.
- Look. There's all this pudding.

1261
01:29:50,009 --> 01:29:53,720
- Mrs. Bast is extremely tired.
- I'm hungry.

1262
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:55,847
Perhaps you should
come back for her.

1263
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:58,934
- Will you be all right?
- I'll be all right.

1264
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:07,734
Ah.

1265
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:32,551
Charles. Charles. look!

1266
01:30:35,429 --> 01:30:38,056
- Whoever's that?
- [Charles] Where?
- Pink scarf.

1267
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:53,155
Charles Wilcox.
How do you do?

1268
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:55,490
Bride or groom?

1269
01:30:59,912 --> 01:31:03,039
Very pleased to have
made your acquaintance.

1270
01:31:05,585 --> 01:31:07,752
Champagne, madam?

1271
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:13,592
Helen? Here?

1272
01:31:13,676 --> 01:31:18,346
But, uh. She refused the invitation.
I thought she despised weddings.

1273
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:20,473
- Where is she now?
- She's gone now.

1274
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:22,475
I've bundled her off
to the George.

1275
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,936
George Hotel?
You shouldn't have done that.

1276
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:29,941
Well. She has two
of her proteges with her.

1277
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:34,112
Ah, yes. Her proteges.
Well, let them all come.

1278
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:40,160
No. But, um. Later on...

1279
01:31:40,244 --> 01:31:42,537
I would like to talk
to you about them.

1280
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:45,207
Well. Why not now?
No time like the present.

1281
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:49,878
- Shall I?
- Mm, yes. If it isn't too long a story.

1282
01:31:49,962 --> 01:31:52,505
- It's not five minutes.
- Yes.

1283
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:56,593
But there's a sting
at the end of it.

1284
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:58,762
Hmm?

1285
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:04,100
For I want you
to find the man some work in your office.

1286
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:06,311
[Laughing]

1287
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:12,484
Well, what are
his qualifications?

1288
01:32:12,568 --> 01:32:16,112
- [Margaret] He's a clerk, I think.
- [Henry] Yes. Where was he before?

1289
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:18,198
[Margaret]
Dempster's Bank.

1290
01:32:18,282 --> 01:32:21,201
[Henry]
Dempster's. Why did he leave?

1291
01:32:21,285 --> 01:32:24,579
- [Margaret] They reduced their staff.
- Oh.

1292
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:30,543
Yes. Um, all right.
I'll see what I can do.

1293
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:32,921
- [Margaret] Thankyou.
- Margaret.

1294
01:32:33,005 --> 01:32:35,131
This cannot be taken
as a precedent, you know.

1295
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:38,551
I can't fit in your proteges
or Helen's proteges every day.

1296
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:42,305
- You do understand?
- Of course. Of course not.

1297
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:46,434
But he's —
he's rather a special case.

1298
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:50,146
Yes. Well. Proteges always are.
Aren't they, hmm?

1299
01:32:52,358 --> 01:32:55,026
[Chattering]

1300
01:33:08,457 --> 01:33:12,127
[Woman] Well, good-bye.
Thank you so much.

1301
01:33:12,211 --> 01:33:15,964
- Good-bye.
- [Jacky] Why, if it isn't Henry.

1302
01:33:16,048 --> 01:33:18,758
[Laughing]

1303
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:24,264
Hello. Henry.
Fancy seeing you here.

1304
01:33:24,348 --> 01:33:27,726
Uh. This is Mrs. Bast.
Sorry. She's a little overtired.

1305
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:31,187
- She's drunk.
- Don't you rememberJacky?

1306
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:35,066
Henry, aren't you
gonna say hello?

1307
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:38,653
- Do you know — know Mrs. Bast?
- No, I don't!

1308
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:40,822
[Jacky]
Know Henry?

1309
01:33:40,906 --> 01:33:42,824
- Who doesn't know Henry?
- Henry?

1310
01:33:42,908 --> 01:33:46,328
- We've had some gay old times, haven't we. Hen?
- You're drunk.

1311
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:48,455
[Margaret]
Henry?

1312
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:53,501
- Henry? Henry.
- Are you satisfied now. Margaret?

1313
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:55,670
I can now understand
your keen interest in the Basts.

1314
01:33:55,755 --> 01:33:58,256
I must say I congratulate you
on your little plan to trap me.

1315
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:00,258
- Trap you?
- I release you from your engagement.

1316
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:02,886
Henry! Henry! Henry!

1317
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:13,021
- Here we are.
- Oh. Please don't bother, my dear.

1318
01:34:13,105 --> 01:34:15,231
I'm sure I can manage.

1319
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:17,567
[Henry]
That's all right. I'll do that. I'll do it.

1320
01:34:17,651 --> 01:34:19,778
Ah.

1321
01:34:19,862 --> 01:34:22,739
- So that's it.
- That is what?

1322
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:25,867
Thank you, dear chap.
You were saying?

1323
01:34:25,951 --> 01:34:30,163
No. Henry and I were just having the fiercest
argument. But I think he has forgiven me.

1324
01:34:30,247 --> 01:34:33,958
Oh, I don't expect
there's much to forgive.

1325
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:37,253
Well, I really must be going.
Or we shall be late.

1326
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,422
Thank you so much
for a lovely time.

1327
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,716
And hasn't the weather
been kind to us?

1328
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:43,885
- Glorious.
- A lovely day.

1329
01:34:43,969 --> 01:34:46,805
- Thank you. My dear. Very much.
- Safe journey.

1330
01:34:46,889 --> 01:34:49,140
- Thank you. Bye-bye. Dolly. Bless you.
- Bye-bye, Albert.

1331
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:51,184
- You take care of yourself.
- I shall.

1332
01:34:51,268 --> 01:34:53,395
- Bye-bye.
- I've forgotten my hat.

1333
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:57,065
- It's here, Father.
- Oh. Ah. Thank you, Albert.

1334
01:34:57,149 --> 01:34:59,150
Ah, are the womenfolk
all right then?

1335
01:34:59,235 --> 01:35:02,320
- Yes.
- Shut the doors and we're all ready.

1336
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:05,240
- Thank you. Uh, uh —
- [Engine Starts]

1337
01:35:05,324 --> 01:35:07,492
Oh. Oh. Drive on then.

1338
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:24,426
[Crying. Whimpering]

1339
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:31,850
[Sobbing]

1340
01:35:48,492 --> 01:35:51,786
- What's the matter. Jacky?
- [Crying]

1341
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:55,707
It was a shock, seeing him.

1342
01:35:55,791 --> 01:36:00,670
- Him? Seeing who?
- I don't want to talk about it.

1343
01:36:00,754 --> 01:36:04,132
- [Staff Giggling]
- What do you think you're looking at?

1344
01:36:04,216 --> 01:36:06,301
Len.

1345
01:36:17,563 --> 01:36:19,564
Henry.

1346
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:24,903
Henry, look at me.

1347
01:36:29,408 --> 01:36:32,535
So you were
that woman's lover.

1348
01:36:33,579 --> 01:36:36,206
Since you put it
with your usual delicacy, yes. I was.

1349
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:38,541
When?

1350
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:41,127
- When, please?
- Ten years ago!

1351
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,590
[Sighs]
I'm sorry. Ten years ago.

1352
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:55,600
Henry, dear,
it's not going to trouble us.

1353
01:37:00,856 --> 01:37:06,528
Ah. Yes. We fellows all fall
from grace once in our time.

1354
01:37:06,612 --> 01:37:09,364
- Do you believe that. Margaret?
- Yes. I do believe it.

1355
01:37:09,448 --> 01:37:12,325
You with your refined pursuits
and your books.

1356
01:37:12,409 --> 01:37:14,786
What can you guess
of any man's life?

1357
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:16,871
The temptations.

1358
01:37:17,873 --> 01:37:19,874
Temptations.

1359
01:37:20,876 --> 01:37:23,962
Well, that's enough.
I've spoken too much already.

1360
01:37:24,046 --> 01:37:27,465
- Yes, that's enough, dear.
- [Clock Ticking]

1361
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:30,677
It was in Cyprus.
It was very lonely.

1362
01:37:30,761 --> 01:37:33,972
- You can never forgive me, can you?
- I have forgiven you. Henry.

1363
01:37:35,808 --> 01:37:38,268
Well, I, uh —

1364
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:43,314
I could find an excuse.
But I won't.

1365
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:48,987
Let us speak no more
about it, dear. It is all behind us.

1366
01:37:49,071 --> 01:37:54,033
Really? You can really bring yourself
to forgive me?

1367
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:05,837
[Kissing] You've learned that
I'm far from a saint. In fact. The reverse.

1368
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:08,089
- Shh.
- No, no. No, no. No.

1369
01:38:08,173 --> 01:38:11,050
The reverse.

1370
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:14,387
- Where are those people now?
- Helen has taken them to the George.

1371
01:38:14,471 --> 01:38:17,432
Oh. Then let them leave
first thing in the morning...

1372
01:38:17,516 --> 01:38:20,560
because there must be no gossip
at the George.

1373
01:38:20,644 --> 01:38:23,062
And anyway,
Helen should be here with us...

1374
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:26,899
not stopping at a hotel
with some ragtags.

1375
01:38:30,487 --> 01:38:33,281
Tell you what. Margaret. Why don't you
kindly write a note to that effect...

1376
01:38:33,365 --> 01:38:37,535
and I'll have Burton send it out
to Helen straight away.

1377
01:38:39,288 --> 01:38:41,497
Burton!

1378
01:38:42,791 --> 01:38:45,793
- Burton!
- [Burton] Yes, sir.

1379
01:38:47,087 --> 01:38:49,505
I want you to take a note
over to the George Hotel straight away.

1380
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:54,093
- Yes, sir.
- There's far too much noise out there.

1381
01:38:57,765 --> 01:39:02,644
[Margaret] I'm sorry to tellyou
that Henry can do nothing for Mr. Bast.

1382
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:05,146
He feels the Basts are not at all...

1383
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:07,899
the type we should trouble about.

1384
01:39:10,736 --> 01:39:12,904
We found the woman drunk
on the lawn.

1385
01:39:12,988 --> 01:39:15,531
Please see that they leave
first thing in the morning...

1386
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:17,825
and come here yourself.

1387
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:20,453
He made her write it.
This isn't Margaret.

1388
01:39:20,537 --> 01:39:23,289
Would you put it in the fire?

1389
01:39:34,134 --> 01:39:36,594
Better let us be, Miss Schlegel.
You don't want to get mixed up in this.

1390
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:40,056
Mixed up in what?

1391
01:39:42,017 --> 01:39:46,229
What is it? You must
trust me that far. At least.

1392
01:39:50,275 --> 01:39:55,613
Mr. Wilcox met Jacky before,
out in Cyprus. When she was 16.

1393
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:01,661
I told you you didn't want
to hear about it.

1394
01:40:01,745 --> 01:40:05,289
Go on.
Why was she in Cyprus?

1395
01:40:05,374 --> 01:40:07,500
Her father was a clerk
in an export business.

1396
01:40:07,584 --> 01:40:09,836
So after her mother died,
she'd gone out to be with him.

1397
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,380
Then he died.

1398
01:40:12,464 --> 01:40:15,925
Accidentally drowned
because he couldn't swim.

1399
01:40:16,009 --> 01:40:19,053
Jacky was left having
to fend for herself...

1400
01:40:19,138 --> 01:40:21,806
till she managed
to get back home.

1401
01:40:57,176 --> 01:40:59,677
I didn't have to marry her.
But I did.

1402
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:01,679
My family wouldn't
have anything to do with us.

1403
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:05,558
They tried to stop me.
But I married her all the same.

1404
01:41:05,642 --> 01:41:09,353
Because I promised. If I hadn't.
Where would she be today...

1405
01:41:09,438 --> 01:41:11,939
after the Mr. Wilcoxes
of this world had finished with her?

1406
01:41:12,024 --> 01:41:14,859
It would never. Never.
Not in a thousand years...

1407
01:41:14,943 --> 01:41:18,321
enter that man's mind
that he'd done anything wrong.

1408
01:41:18,405 --> 01:41:22,200
Because there's nothing here
and nothing here.

1409
01:41:22,284 --> 01:41:25,912
And you're the opposite. You believe
in personal responsibility...

1410
01:41:25,996 --> 01:41:27,914
and personal everything.

1411
01:41:27,998 --> 01:41:32,168
Very nice. What good am I
to myself or to Jacky —

1412
01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:35,338
marrying her only to pull her down
with me so we can starve together?

1413
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:37,965
You'll find another position.
Surely.

1414
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:39,967
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1415
01:41:40,052 --> 01:41:43,930
If rich people fail at one profession.
They can try another.

1416
01:41:44,014 --> 01:41:49,769
But with us, once a man over 20
loses his own particular job. He's done for.

1417
01:41:52,898 --> 01:41:55,399
I'd do anything in the world
to help you.

1418
01:41:58,070 --> 01:42:01,113
Well, help me row then.
I'm tired.

1419
01:42:21,927 --> 01:42:25,179
You're the one person
who ever has helped me.

1420
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:29,559
You mean by passing on false information
to make you give up your job?

1421
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:33,062
I mean by being
the sort of person you are.

1422
01:42:34,314 --> 01:42:38,526
I didn't think people like you existed
except in books. And books aren't real.

1423
01:42:38,610 --> 01:42:40,903
Oh, no. They're more real
than anything.

1424
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:44,574
When people fail you,
there's still music and meaning.

1425
01:42:46,618 --> 01:42:50,288
That's for rich people. To make them
feel good after their dinner.

1426
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:57,545
Everything's got spoiled
for you. Hasn't it?

1427
01:43:30,829 --> 01:43:32,955
[Bells Chiming]

1428
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:38,085
Don't know what's
to be done, Tibby.

1429
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:40,588
Or what to say to Meg.

1430
01:43:40,672 --> 01:43:43,382
Don't want to face her
or even to go back to Wickham Place.

1431
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:48,512
You mean because of Mr. Wilcox
and the woman you say he seduced...

1432
01:43:48,597 --> 01:43:51,223
in between growing currants
in Cyprus?

1433
01:43:53,518 --> 01:43:56,103
I want you to give Meg my love
and tell her —

1434
01:43:56,188 --> 01:44:01,150
tell her I'm going away
to Germany... to Munich or else Bonn.

1435
01:44:01,234 --> 01:44:04,070
Such a message is easily given.

1436
01:44:05,197 --> 01:44:07,698
[Sighs] God. I wish I could escape
from Meg's wedding too.

1437
01:44:07,783 --> 01:44:12,203
Is she going through with it? How
is it possible for our Meg to be a Wilcox?

1438
01:44:12,287 --> 01:44:15,790
- And now, after all this?
- You'd much better go away to Germany.

1439
01:44:15,874 --> 01:44:18,125
- [Knocking]
- There's Martlett with the Apple Charlotte.

1440
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:20,878
Do you mind if I take it from him?
It spoils with waiting.

1441
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:25,383
Ah, Martlett.

1442
01:44:26,593 --> 01:44:29,470
- Shall I clear now?
- Not now. Um, later.

1443
01:44:29,554 --> 01:44:32,264
Thank you very much.

1444
01:44:34,559 --> 01:44:38,896
I feel — no, I know —
we owe the Basts some compensation.

1445
01:44:38,981 --> 01:44:41,816
- Those people again?
- Yes, those people again.

1446
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:45,027
Don't see who is to pay if I don't.
I'm placing what I consider...

1447
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:47,029
is a minimum amount
to your account...

1448
01:44:47,114 --> 01:44:50,491
and when I'm in Germany.
You'll pay it to the Basts.

1449
01:44:50,575 --> 01:44:53,828
I shall never forget your kindness.
Tibbikins. If you do this.

1450
01:44:53,912 --> 01:44:56,622
- What's the sum?
- 5.000.

1451
01:44:56,707 --> 01:45:00,167
- Good God!
- It's useless giving out driblets of charity...

1452
01:45:00,252 --> 01:45:02,753
just shillings and blankets.

1453
01:45:02,838 --> 01:45:05,089
No doubt people
will think me mad.

1454
01:45:05,173 --> 01:45:07,717
I don't give a damn
what people think...

1455
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:12,346
but I do mind if you ruin yourself
for some quixotic reason of your own.

1456
01:45:12,431 --> 01:45:14,724
I don't expect you
to understand me.

1457
01:45:14,808 --> 01:45:18,227
- I understand nobody.
- But you'll do it?

1458
01:45:19,271 --> 01:45:21,397
Apparently.

1459
01:45:32,951 --> 01:45:35,995
Are you writing to your brother?
He could send us another 10.

1460
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:37,997
Yes. And a long lecture
to go with it.

1461
01:45:38,081 --> 01:45:41,042
- Your sister could afford a fiver.
- Leave me alone!

1462
01:45:46,048 --> 01:45:49,050
Why are you taking it out on me?

1463
01:45:50,052 --> 01:45:52,344
You can see I'm busy.
Can't you?

1464
01:46:02,981 --> 01:46:05,691
[Bells Chiming]

1465
01:46:07,944 --> 01:46:10,780
[Leonard] Dear Mr. Schlegel,
I acknowledge receipt...

1466
01:46:10,864 --> 01:46:12,782
of your letter
dated second ofOctober...

1467
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:15,576
enclosing a check
for £5,000.

1468
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:18,746
I am very grateful foryour concern,
but having no immediate necessity...

1469
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:21,582
I have the honor
to return your check herewith.

1470
01:46:21,666 --> 01:46:25,586
Yours sincerely, Leonard Bast.

1471
01:46:25,670 --> 01:46:28,172
[Low Chattering]

1472
01:46:29,174 --> 01:46:32,802
[Leonard] Excuse me, sir.
Um, sorry to botheryou.

1473
01:46:32,886 --> 01:46:35,638
I worked in this office
for four years.

1474
01:46:35,722 --> 01:46:37,973
I was wondering if there were
any vacancies at the moment?

1475
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:40,559
No. No, I'm sorry.
I've nothing.

1476
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:42,728
- Nothing at all?
- Nothing at this time.

1477
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:45,189
Thank you for your time.

1478
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:35,573
[Henry] All right.
The servants will have the benefit...

1479
01:47:35,657 --> 01:47:39,827
of the central heating if we
keep them here instead of at the back.

1480
01:47:39,911 --> 01:47:43,998
- That's what the architect prefers.
- If only it would hurry up and get itself built.

1481
01:47:44,082 --> 01:47:46,167
All in good time.

1482
01:47:46,251 --> 01:47:48,377
- I'm getting tired of living in London.
- Are you?

1483
01:47:48,461 --> 01:47:51,005
- I can't be as young as I was.
- Yeah?

1484
01:47:51,089 --> 01:47:55,634
I'm perfectly happy to do without all
the new plays and discussion societies and —

1485
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:59,096
Mr. Shaw. Mr. Wells
and all your utopias.

1486
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:02,850
What I miss are trees
and mountains and meadows.

1487
01:48:02,934 --> 01:48:04,852
Yes.

1488
01:48:04,936 --> 01:48:09,607
- I also miss my own things.
- They're safe enough at Howards End.

1489
01:48:09,691 --> 01:48:12,193
And of course I'm very grateful
to have them there.

1490
01:48:12,277 --> 01:48:15,404
I would so like to see everything
in our own home.

1491
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:20,367
My share at least. Goodness only knows
what Tibby intends to do with his.

1492
01:48:20,452 --> 01:48:22,536
Or Helen.

1493
01:48:24,372 --> 01:48:26,916
There's been another postcard
from her.

1494
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:30,377
Still the same poste restante address
in Bavaria.

1495
01:48:30,462 --> 01:48:34,840
- But now she speaks of going to Italy.
- Is she never coming back to England?

1496
01:48:34,925 --> 01:48:38,385
She's been away now —
How long has it been?

1497
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:41,430
It will be four months
and three weeks on Tuesday.

1498
01:48:41,514 --> 01:48:43,891
Yes.

1499
01:48:43,975 --> 01:48:46,644
Your sister is odd.
She always has been.

1500
01:48:46,728 --> 01:48:49,104
There's no getting away from it.

1501
01:48:50,315 --> 01:48:54,777
What is this?
What you been reading now?

1502
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:56,737
- Theo —
- Theosophy.

1503
01:48:56,821 --> 01:48:58,822
Oh, yes.
[Laughing]

1504
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:05,412
Madame Blavatsky.
Now. What a clever little woman it is.

1505
01:49:05,497 --> 01:49:07,831
You see, that's
what I mean about Helen.

1506
01:49:07,916 --> 01:49:10,417
She reads these things,
and her mind gets addled.

1507
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:14,672
My Margaret,
she keeps her facts straight.

1508
01:49:14,756 --> 01:49:17,299
- What facts are those. Dear?
- Hmm?

1509
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:19,593
About men and women
and all that sort of thing.

1510
01:49:19,678 --> 01:49:24,348
Who is who and what is what.
Yes. Now, what is that?

1511
01:49:24,432 --> 01:49:27,643
Mr. Schlegel, sir,
you've forgotten these.

1512
01:49:27,727 --> 01:49:29,895
- Ah. Thank you, Martlett.
- Thank you. Sir.

1513
01:49:39,906 --> 01:49:42,324
Ah.

1514
01:49:42,409 --> 01:49:46,287
Oh. Dear. Annie.
Look. It's another one.

1515
01:49:49,332 --> 01:49:51,750
And no letter.

1516
01:50:00,343 --> 01:50:05,222
[Margaret] See, I just can't feel
that Helen's really alive.

1517
01:50:05,307 --> 01:50:07,808
These postcards and telegrams
don't seem to have come from her.

1518
01:50:07,892 --> 01:50:10,311
They're — That's not her.

1519
01:50:10,395 --> 01:50:12,563
I know what you mean.

1520
01:50:12,647 --> 01:50:14,815
You'll break that
if you keep fiddling with it.

1521
01:50:14,899 --> 01:50:16,650
- [Margaret] Well, put it on.
- Oh!

1522
01:50:16,735 --> 01:50:18,736
[Margaret]
Give me my card.

1523
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:23,991
[Helen] M.J. Schlegel, The Rise,
Straight Fleming, Devon.

1524
01:50:24,075 --> 01:50:27,369
Dearest Meg,
arriving London Thursday.

1525
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:30,581
Please telegraph, care my bank,
whetherAuntJuley is better...

1526
01:50:30,665 --> 01:50:33,000
or likely to become worse.

1527
01:50:33,084 --> 01:50:37,588
Give my love to the invalid
and keep some foryourselves. Helen.

1528
01:50:37,672 --> 01:50:41,175
If only you had a companion
to take your walks with.

1529
01:50:41,259 --> 01:50:44,303
I have Tibby. Dear Aunt Juley.

1530
01:50:46,264 --> 01:50:49,016
And it won't be long —
Thank you, Maggie —

1531
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:50,726
before you'll be up and about.

1532
01:50:50,810 --> 01:50:53,979
When is Helen coming?

1533
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:57,649
Very soon. Dear. She will already
have reached London.

1534
01:51:06,785 --> 01:51:08,494
[Whispering]
She's got to London all right.

1535
01:51:08,578 --> 01:51:12,706
- Yes, but —
- She says to telegraph ifAunt Juley is better.

1536
01:51:12,791 --> 01:51:16,251
Obviously, if you want to see her.
You must telegraph she's not better.

1537
01:51:16,336 --> 01:51:19,004
We can't start lying
to each other. Helen wouldn't —

1538
01:51:19,089 --> 01:51:21,924
- Shh!
- She couldn't stay away at such a time.

1539
01:51:27,639 --> 01:51:30,849
[Margaret]
Dearest Helen, AuntJuley better...

1540
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:33,102
and eagerly expectingyou,
as am I.

1541
01:51:33,186 --> 01:51:35,187
Your Meg.

1542
01:51:35,271 --> 01:51:37,189
[Helen]
Must return Germany at once.

1543
01:51:37,273 --> 01:51:41,068
Telegraph to bank whereabouts
our books and furniture. Helen.

1544
01:51:41,152 --> 01:51:44,029
Why did she have
to go back to Germany?

1545
01:51:44,114 --> 01:51:46,782
I'll explain it all to you
after your nap.

1546
01:51:46,866 --> 01:51:49,868
She might have come to see her old aunt.
I haven't been well.

1547
01:51:49,953 --> 01:51:53,414
Is cook doing the mackerel
the way Tibby likes them?

1548
01:51:53,498 --> 01:51:57,292
I know his whole day is spoiled
if his breakfast isn't right.

1549
01:51:57,377 --> 01:52:01,422
The mackerel were perfect. In fact. Tibby
particularly mentioned them this morning.

1550
01:52:01,506 --> 01:52:04,091
Don't tell me. Tibby,
that it is still that business...

1551
01:52:04,175 --> 01:52:06,635
over Henry and that woman.
Mrs. Bast.

1552
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:11,515
Goodness me. How morbid.
His wife forgives him...

1553
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:15,394
and his sister-in-law cannot bear
to look upon his face.

1554
01:52:15,478 --> 01:52:19,189
I don't believe it.
Not even of Helen.

1555
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:22,192
[Tibby]
We know to what extremes Helen goes.

1556
01:52:22,277 --> 01:52:23,944
We've all suffered
under her temperament.

1557
01:52:24,028 --> 01:52:29,450
But this is different. This is
not temperament, but a kind of madness —

1558
01:52:29,534 --> 01:52:31,910
as if she were mad.

1559
01:52:49,846 --> 01:52:53,807
Margaret. You've got black marks
again under your eyes.

1560
01:52:53,892 --> 01:52:56,393
You know that's strictly forbidden.
Don't you?

1561
01:52:56,478 --> 01:52:59,146
I'll not have my girl
looking as old as her husband.

1562
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:02,483
- You haven't quite seen our point.
- I don't suppose I ever shall.

1563
01:53:02,567 --> 01:53:05,444
Our point is this:
Our sister may be mad.

1564
01:53:07,822 --> 01:53:11,742
Oh, Charles, do come in.
We are again in trouble.

1565
01:53:11,826 --> 01:53:15,829
- Can you help us at all?
- No, I'm afraid I cannot.

1566
01:53:15,914 --> 01:53:19,333
What were the facts? We're all mad.
More or less. These days.

1567
01:53:19,417 --> 01:53:23,587
The facts are that our sister has been
in England three days and won't see us.

1568
01:53:23,671 --> 01:53:26,340
She's forbidden the bankers
to give us her address.

1569
01:53:26,424 --> 01:53:30,719
She refuses to answer any questions.
All we have are these telegrams.

1570
01:53:31,763 --> 01:53:34,765
And you want to get hold of her.
Is that it?

1571
01:53:34,849 --> 01:53:38,936
- Well... yes.
- [Henry] Perfectly easy, Margaret.

1572
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:40,938
She wants her books, yes?

1573
01:53:41,022 --> 01:53:45,108
Send her after them to Howards End.
When she's there. You just stroll in.

1574
01:53:45,193 --> 01:53:47,152
If there's nothing wrong
with her, so much the better.

1575
01:53:47,237 --> 01:53:50,155
But remember —
the motor will be around the corner.

1576
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:53,075
We quite simply run her
up to London to a specialist.

1577
01:53:53,159 --> 01:53:57,704
- That's impossible.
- Why is it impossible?

1578
01:53:57,789 --> 01:54:00,040
Because Helen and I, we...

1579
01:54:01,042 --> 01:54:03,877
don't speak that particular language...

1580
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:06,380
if you see my meaning.

1581
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:10,634
Yes. Because you have scruples.
And I understand perfectly.

1582
01:54:10,718 --> 01:54:13,554
I'm as scrupulous
as any man alive, I hope.

1583
01:54:13,638 --> 01:54:17,224
But when it is a case like this —
When it is a question of madness —

1584
01:54:17,308 --> 01:54:20,185
- I deny it's madness.
- You said yourself.

1585
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:22,437
It's madness when I say it.
But not when you say it.

1586
01:54:24,357 --> 01:54:27,526
Pater. You may as well
keep Howards End out of it.

1587
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:29,987
Why, Charles?

1588
01:54:31,864 --> 01:54:36,201
Well, the whole house is at sixes
and sevens. We don't want any more mess.

1589
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:38,287
And who is "we"?

1590
01:54:40,331 --> 01:54:44,918
- Pray, Charles. Who is "we"?
- Beg your pardon, I'm sure.

1591
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:48,005
Ah, I seem always
to be intruding.

1592
01:54:49,173 --> 01:54:52,009
No. Charles. Charles!

1593
01:54:53,052 --> 01:54:54,761
[Door Opens And Closes]

1594
01:54:54,846 --> 01:54:57,014
Let's send a telegram.

1595
01:54:58,725 --> 01:55:00,684
Come along. Let's do it.

1596
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:08,358
I can't have this sort
of behavior, Charles.

1597
01:55:08,443 --> 01:55:10,861
- What?
- Margaret.

1598
01:55:10,945 --> 01:55:15,532
She's far too sweet-natured
to mind, but I mind for her.

1599
01:55:21,748 --> 01:55:24,625
[Margaret]
Allyour books now at Howards End.

1600
01:55:24,709 --> 01:55:27,336
Miss Avery will
let you in 3:00 p.m. Monday.

1601
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:29,755
Meg.

1602
01:55:29,839 --> 01:55:34,468
Our main object is not to
frighten Miss Schlegel, you understand?

1603
01:55:34,552 --> 01:55:37,971
Trouble seems to be nervous.
Wouldn't you say so. Margaret?

1604
01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:40,432
Would you say
she was normal?

1605
01:55:40,516 --> 01:55:42,768
Well. She's always
been highly strung —

1606
01:55:42,852 --> 01:55:46,313
musical. Literary, artistic —
but quite normal.

1607
01:55:46,397 --> 01:55:48,607
Quite a charming girl. Really.

1608
01:55:48,691 --> 01:55:51,276
Would you say
there was anything congenital?

1609
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:53,570
- No, no.
- Or anything hereditary?

1610
01:55:53,655 --> 01:55:54,863
No.

1611
01:56:12,507 --> 01:56:15,967
- Margaret?
- Yes, Henry. Just wait here for a second.

1612
01:56:18,471 --> 01:56:21,890
Oh. My darling. Quickly —
Quickly just get inside please.

1613
01:56:21,974 --> 01:56:23,975
Just quickly.

1614
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:29,481
Miss Schlegel is managing.
You can go back to the motor. Margaret?

1615
01:56:29,565 --> 01:56:33,944
Henry, I shall need your advice later.
But now I must be alone with Helen.

1616
01:56:34,028 --> 01:56:36,613
- Certainly.
- Please, my dear, kind Henry.

1617
01:56:36,698 --> 01:56:39,199
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1618
01:56:57,677 --> 01:57:01,847
- Where are all our furniture?
- Ah, there's been a mistake.

1619
01:57:03,808 --> 01:57:06,226
How well the carpet fits.

1620
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:09,730
I'll be sending some milk round.
And we should be ordering coals.

1621
01:57:09,814 --> 01:57:12,107
There's been a mistake.
Miss Avery. You've been very kind.

1622
01:57:12,191 --> 01:57:15,026
But we are not going to live
at Howards End. This is not our house.

1623
01:57:20,825 --> 01:57:24,244
I think she may be
a little... touched.

1624
01:57:25,455 --> 01:57:29,082
I'm sorry. Helen.
I ought not to have —

1625
01:57:29,167 --> 01:57:31,835
No, you ought not
to have tricked me this way.

1626
01:57:31,919 --> 01:57:34,796
- We thought you were ill.
- As you see, I'm not ill...

1627
01:57:34,881 --> 01:57:37,674
but I'm expecting a child in June.

1628
01:57:37,759 --> 01:57:40,302
Is the coast clear?
I must leave.

1629
01:57:40,386 --> 01:57:42,637
I'm going back to Germany
in the morning.

1630
01:57:42,722 --> 01:57:44,639
Give my love to Aunt Juley
and to Tibby.

1631
01:57:44,724 --> 01:57:46,975
- Let me get that.
- Don't.

1632
01:57:47,059 --> 01:57:49,770
It's curious, isn't it.
That our carpet fits?

1633
01:57:51,063 --> 01:57:53,607
Yes. The sword
looks right too.

1634
01:57:54,609 --> 01:57:56,818
Yes. Doesn't it?

1635
01:58:01,699 --> 01:58:05,202
- Someone's polished it.
- Yes.

1636
01:58:07,038 --> 01:58:09,372
I'll carry this.

1637
01:58:13,252 --> 01:58:15,921
[Margaret] Even if you didn't want
to tell me, I understand that.

1638
01:58:16,005 --> 01:58:20,258
I thought I had to be by myself.
That's why I hid away in Germany.

1639
01:58:20,343 --> 01:58:22,636
- What about Tibby?
- You know, Meg. Really...

1640
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:26,890
I alone must be responsible
for myself and this child.

1641
01:58:26,974 --> 01:58:29,351
And I want to be.

1642
01:58:29,435 --> 01:58:31,394
Of course.
Leonard doesn't know.

1643
01:58:31,479 --> 01:58:34,147
Leonard?

1644
01:58:34,232 --> 01:58:37,943
- Leonard Bast?
- Yes.

1645
01:58:38,027 --> 01:58:40,403
- [Gasps]
- Oh, Meg...

1646
01:58:40,488 --> 01:58:43,907
did you ever hear
from him again?

1647
01:58:45,117 --> 01:58:49,996
[Sighs]
I have no idea what he's doing now...

1648
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:52,791
or what's happened
to either of them.

1649
01:58:57,839 --> 01:58:59,798
[Henry]
Dolly.

1650
01:58:59,882 --> 01:59:02,759
- Hello.
- [Dolly] Hello.

1651
01:59:03,970 --> 01:59:06,471
My dear. I must ask you.

1652
01:59:06,556 --> 01:59:10,058
- Was your sister wearing a wedding ring?
- No.

1653
01:59:10,142 --> 01:59:12,060
- What?
- No.

1654
01:59:13,062 --> 01:59:16,481
Henry, I really camejust
to ask a favor about Howards End.

1655
01:59:16,566 --> 01:59:19,276
Yes. One point at a time.
Please. Sit down.

1656
01:59:21,779 --> 01:59:24,030
Margaret...

1657
01:59:24,115 --> 01:59:28,410
I must now ask you
the name of her seducer.

1658
01:59:28,494 --> 01:59:31,580
You may have some inkling.
And the slightest hint would help us.

1659
01:59:31,664 --> 01:59:34,374
- "Us"? Who is "us"?
- Hmm?

1660
01:59:34,458 --> 01:59:37,752
Well, I thought it best
to ring Charles.

1661
01:59:37,837 --> 01:59:39,754
That was unnecessary.

1662
01:59:39,839 --> 01:59:42,173
My dear. Listen to me.

1663
01:59:42,258 --> 01:59:45,927
Charles and I wish to act
in your sister's best interests.

1664
01:59:46,012 --> 01:59:48,889
It's still not too late
to clear her name.

1665
01:59:48,973 --> 01:59:52,434
What are we —
to make her seducer marry her?

1666
01:59:52,518 --> 01:59:54,895
But Henry. Suppose he turned out
to be married already?

1667
01:59:54,979 --> 01:59:57,939
- One has heard of such cases.
- Margaret.

1668
02:00:02,361 --> 02:00:05,655
Then he must pay heavily
for his misconduct. Mustn't he?

1669
02:00:07,283 --> 02:00:09,784
Now. Stay calm.

1670
02:00:11,996 --> 02:00:14,164
I want to talk to you.

1671
02:00:14,248 --> 02:00:16,833
Listen to me. Margaret.

1672
02:00:17,877 --> 02:00:19,836
Come here.

1673
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:21,922
Look at me.

1674
02:00:22,006 --> 02:00:24,007
What's the matter?

1675
02:00:26,594 --> 02:00:29,387
- Hmm?
- May I ask you my question now?

1676
02:00:29,472 --> 02:00:32,766
- Certainly.
- Tomorrow Helen goes to Germany.

1677
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:34,768
- Yes.
- I'm fine.

1678
02:00:34,852 --> 02:00:37,604
- Tonight. With your permission...
- Yes?

1679
02:00:37,688 --> 02:00:40,106
She would like to sleep
at Howards End.

1680
02:00:40,191 --> 02:00:42,359
Heav —

1681
02:00:42,443 --> 02:00:44,903
But why at Howards End?
I don't understand.

1682
02:00:44,987 --> 02:00:48,782
It is an odd request, but you know
what women in her state are.

1683
02:00:48,866 --> 02:00:52,535
I could understand if it were
her own home — associations and so on.

1684
02:00:52,620 --> 02:00:54,955
But Helen has no associations
with Howards End.

1685
02:00:55,039 --> 02:00:58,291
I don't see why she wants to stay there.
She'll only catch cold anyway.

1686
02:00:58,376 --> 02:01:02,170
- Call it fancy. But she wants to.
- I don't understand.

1687
02:01:02,296 --> 02:01:05,215
- If she wants to sleep there one night.
She'll want to sleep there two.
- No, no. Just —

1688
02:01:05,299 --> 02:01:07,550
- And she'll never get out of the house.
- That matters so very much?

1689
02:01:07,635 --> 02:01:09,594
- Of course it would. It's Charles's —
- No, no.

1690
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:12,180
We will only trouble
Howards End for this one night.

1691
02:01:12,264 --> 02:01:15,058
- I shall stay with her —
- No. That's quite impossible.

1692
02:01:15,142 --> 02:01:17,686
- I want you here to meet Charles.
- What has Charles to do with this?

1693
02:01:17,770 --> 02:01:20,939
As the future owner of Howards End.
It has everything to do with Charles.

1694
02:01:21,065 --> 02:01:25,944
- In what way? Please answer me. Henry.
- [Henry] You're forgetting yourself.
There's Dolly and the servants.

1695
02:01:26,028 --> 02:01:28,655
In what way? Would Helen's condition
depreciate the property?

1696
02:01:28,739 --> 02:01:30,782
Margaret!

1697
02:01:30,866 --> 02:01:33,785
[Baby Cooing]

1698
02:01:35,413 --> 02:01:37,998
- [Panting]
- Margaret.

1699
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:43,586
I shall do what I can
for your sister...

1700
02:01:43,671 --> 02:01:46,006
but I cannot treat it
as if nothing has happened.

1701
02:01:46,090 --> 02:01:48,383
I should be forced
from my position in society if I did.

1702
02:01:48,467 --> 02:01:52,887
Tomorrow she will go to Germany
and trouble society no longer.

1703
02:01:52,972 --> 02:01:58,643
Tonight, she asks to sleep
in your empty house.

1704
02:01:58,728 --> 02:02:02,022
May she?
Will you give my sister leave?

1705
02:02:02,106 --> 02:02:04,607
Will you forgive her...

1706
02:02:06,193 --> 02:02:09,029
as you yourself
have been forgiven?

1707
02:02:10,072 --> 02:02:13,283
- As I myself have been —
- Please answer my question. Henry.

1708
02:02:15,202 --> 02:02:17,912
Your sister can sleep at the hotel.
I have my children...

1709
02:02:17,997 --> 02:02:20,999
and the memory
of my dear wife to consider.

1710
02:02:21,083 --> 02:02:24,044
You have mentioned
Mrs. Wilcox.

1711
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:27,672
In reply,
may I mention Mrs. Bast?

1712
02:02:29,925 --> 02:02:32,302
- You have not been yourself all day.
- Henry, listen.

1713
02:02:32,386 --> 02:02:34,304
You have had a mistress.
I forgave you.

1714
02:02:34,388 --> 02:02:37,974
My sister has a lover.
You drive her from the house!

1715
02:02:38,059 --> 02:02:40,852
Why can you not be honest
and say to yourself...

1716
02:02:40,936 --> 02:02:44,189
"What Helen has done.
I have done"?

1717
02:02:49,445 --> 02:02:51,863
I repeat what I said before.

1718
02:02:51,947 --> 02:02:54,532
I do not give your sister leave
to sleep at Howards End.

1719
02:02:56,202 --> 02:02:59,079
Now, do you understand?

1720
02:03:06,337 --> 02:03:08,421
[Bells Chiming]

1721
02:03:08,506 --> 02:03:12,258
[Charles] lfa man played about with
my sister, I'd send a bullet through him.

1722
02:03:12,343 --> 02:03:16,971
But I suppose you're sunk too deep
in books and rubbish.

1723
02:03:17,056 --> 02:03:19,265
Do you mind what happens
to your sister?

1724
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:23,812
As a matter of fact, I mind very much
what happens to my sister.

1725
02:03:23,896 --> 02:03:26,898
But I have a different way
of expressing it from yours.

1726
02:03:26,982 --> 02:03:31,152
- Not to speak of different manners.
- By Jove. I'm glad of my way!

1727
02:03:32,947 --> 02:03:36,199
I'm glad my father never sent me to
the varsity if this is what they teach you.

1728
02:03:37,868 --> 02:03:42,330
Look. You must know something
of your sister's life.

1729
02:03:43,749 --> 02:03:46,376
- Do you know of anyone?
- No.

1730
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:49,170
Whom do you suspect?

1731
02:03:51,006 --> 02:03:54,050
Did she mention anyone
by name?

1732
02:03:54,135 --> 02:03:56,886
Come on. Yes or no.
You're hiding something. Man. Speak up.

1733
02:03:56,971 --> 02:03:59,389
She did mention some friend
called Leonard Bast.

1734
02:03:59,473 --> 02:04:01,683
Leonard Bast, eh?

1735
02:04:02,685 --> 02:04:04,811
Leonard Bast.

1736
02:04:04,895 --> 02:04:07,272
Do you know him?

1737
02:04:07,356 --> 02:04:10,316
Have you had
any dealings with him?

1738
02:04:10,401 --> 02:04:13,027
Oh, what a family.

1739
02:04:13,112 --> 02:04:15,822
What a family!
God help the poor pater.

1740
02:04:15,906 --> 02:04:18,116
I'd say God help my poor sisters.

1741
02:04:23,914 --> 02:04:26,166
- [Woman] Admiring isn't purchasing.
- [Man] But they were ordered on approval.

1742
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:28,877
- [Woman] We do not accept things on approval.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

1743
02:04:28,961 --> 02:04:32,380
- [Woman] Wait.
- [Man] Ma'am.

1744
02:04:32,464 --> 02:04:34,883
Excuse me. I was looking
for Miss Schlegel.

1745
02:04:34,967 --> 02:04:37,594
- It's —
- Leonard Bast. I used to call at Wickham Place.

1746
02:04:37,678 --> 02:04:40,221
Is Miss Schlegel in?
Or Mrs. Wilcox?

1747
02:04:40,306 --> 02:04:44,517
- They're all down at Howards End.
- Where would that be now? Howards End?

1748
02:04:44,602 --> 02:04:47,395
It's at Hilton,
near Hilton Junction.

1749
02:04:49,106 --> 02:04:52,859
Are you all right?
Let me get you a drink ofwater.

1750
02:04:52,943 --> 02:04:55,445
No. Thank you.

1751
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:01,326
- Please take them. Ma'am. This is —
- Come on. Off you go.

1752
02:05:06,790 --> 02:05:10,043
I don't want you to conclude
that my wife and I...

1753
02:05:10,127 --> 02:05:12,879
have had anything like a quarrel.

1754
02:05:12,963 --> 02:05:15,506
She is overwrought,
as who would not be. Naturally.

1755
02:05:15,591 --> 02:05:17,550
Naturally.

1756
02:05:17,635 --> 02:05:20,720
The question in my mind
is connected to something far greater —

1757
02:05:20,804 --> 02:05:22,847
the rights of property itself.

1758
02:05:22,932 --> 02:05:27,560
- Absolutely.
- The house is mine and will be yours.

1759
02:05:27,645 --> 02:05:30,939
When I say I don't want anyone living
at Howards End...

1760
02:05:31,023 --> 02:05:33,816
I mean no one
is to live at Howards End.

1761
02:05:33,901 --> 02:05:36,569
Then I take it tomorrow morning
I may go up in the motor?

Mm.

1763
02:05:38,697 --> 02:05:41,950
Yes. Say that you're acting
as my representative...

1764
02:05:42,034 --> 02:05:45,036
and that they must
clear out at once.

1765
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:48,122
You must go to bed now.
I've kept you up far too late.

1766
02:05:50,584 --> 02:05:55,838
- Can I do anything for you, sir?
- H mm? No. Nothing.

1767
02:05:55,923 --> 02:05:57,924

- And was it wonderful?
- [Leonard] No.

1789
02:09:10,576 --> 02:09:13,619
- [Helen And Margaret Laughing]
- [Leonard] It was only gray.

1790
02:09:31,889 --> 02:09:34,140
[Leonard] Excuse me. Could you
direct me to Howards End?

1791
02:09:34,224 --> 02:09:37,226
[Boy]
This is Howards End.

1792
02:09:46,904 --> 02:09:49,113
Yes. Thank you very much.
Charles.

1793
02:09:49,198 --> 02:09:51,908
There are two boxes of books in the —

1794
02:09:58,749 --> 02:10:02,919
Miss Schlegel — Mrs. Wilcox.
You'll have forgotten me.

1795
02:10:03,003 --> 02:10:05,296
No. Mr. Bast,
I have not forgotten you.

1796
02:10:07,424 --> 02:10:11,052
I only want to know
where your sister is, where Helen is.

1797
02:10:11,136 --> 02:10:14,764
- [Charles] Who is it?
- Helen?

1798
02:10:14,848 --> 02:10:17,350
Leonard!

1799
02:10:17,434 --> 02:10:19,560
So this is Leonard Bast.

1800
02:10:21,772 --> 02:10:24,315
- This is for insulting the name of woman.
- [Margaret Screams] No!

1801
02:10:24,399 --> 02:10:26,025
- Get me a stick. Margaret. A stick.
- Will you please stop?

1802
02:10:26,109 --> 02:10:28,903
Charles. We are perfectly capable
of dealing with this.

1803
02:10:28,987 --> 02:10:32,114
- No!
- Get back!

1804
02:10:32,199 --> 02:10:34,825
- Stand up, man!
- [Women Screaming] Charles!

1805
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:36,953
- Stand up!
- Stop it. Charles!

1806
02:10:58,392 --> 02:11:01,852
[Henry] So it is your opinion that he
was in the last stages of heart disease?

1807
02:11:01,937 --> 02:11:05,231
It would not be professional
to say so before an autopsy...

1808
02:11:05,315 --> 02:11:10,528
but in private.
That could well be my diagnosis.

1809
02:11:10,612 --> 02:11:12,572
Obviously he was in the last stage...

1810
02:11:12,656 --> 02:11:16,617
because the moment I touched him
with the sword, he simply crumpled up.

1811
02:11:16,702 --> 02:11:19,662
Excuse me. Sir.
What sword would that have been?

1812
02:11:19,746 --> 02:11:24,000
U m, well. It's inside.
You'd better follow me.

1813
02:11:33,343 --> 02:11:36,345
It's their father's
old German sword.

1814
02:11:37,347 --> 02:11:40,224
Course. I only touched him
with the flat of it.

1815
02:11:40,309 --> 02:11:44,812
- Just once?
- Yes, once, perhaps twice.

1816
02:11:47,941 --> 02:11:50,901
I presume you will be staying
in Hilton, Mr. Wilcox. Sir?

1817
02:11:50,986 --> 02:11:54,905
Ah, yes. Yes. I'll be available
as long as is necessary.

1818
02:11:54,990 --> 02:11:59,285
And, Mr. Charles Wilcox.
We shall be requesting your presence...

1819
02:11:59,369 --> 02:12:02,079
at the inquest, sir.

1820
02:12:02,164 --> 02:12:06,709
Yes. Well. I did expect that. I shall
naturally be the most important witness.

1821
02:12:47,125 --> 02:12:49,543
Margaret?

1822
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:56,884
Good. Henry, I was going to come up
to Hilton to give you these.

1823
02:12:56,968 --> 02:12:59,095
Yes. I have something
to tell you. Margaret.

1824
02:12:59,179 --> 02:13:02,264
Never mind. Henry. I don't need
to hear it. I'm leaving you.

1825
02:13:02,349 --> 02:13:05,685
- My life is with Helen now.
- Yes.

1826
02:13:05,769 --> 02:13:10,940
I'm extremely tired.
Come and sit down for a moment.

1827
02:13:12,567 --> 02:13:14,819
Yes. For a moment. We'll have
to sit here on the grass then.

1828
02:13:14,903 --> 02:13:17,029
Yes.

1829
02:13:21,827 --> 02:13:26,664
Here are your keys. We shall be staying
with Miss Avery at the farm till we can leave.

1830
02:13:26,748 --> 02:13:29,917
Yes. Where are you going?

1831
02:13:30,001 --> 02:13:32,044
To Germany.

1832
02:13:32,129 --> 02:13:34,463
We'll start as soon as possible
after the inquest.

1833
02:13:34,548 --> 02:13:37,925
- After the inquest.
- If Helen is well enough.

1834
02:13:38,009 --> 02:13:41,554
You realize what
the verdict will be, don't you?

1835
02:13:41,638 --> 02:13:44,557
Yes. Heart disease.

1836
02:13:44,641 --> 02:13:48,686
No. Manslaughter.
If not worse.

1837
02:13:48,770 --> 02:13:52,815
Charles may go to prison.
I dare not tell him.

1838
02:13:52,899 --> 02:13:55,651
I don't know what to do.

1839
02:13:57,738 --> 02:14:00,740
[Crying]
I don't know what to do.

1840
02:14:02,242 --> 02:14:04,660
[Sniffling]

1841
02:14:05,871 --> 02:14:08,456
I'm sorry.

1842
02:15:42,551 --> 02:15:44,885
[Henry] Now, is this going
to suit everyone?

1843
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:47,012
Because I don't want you all
coming here later on...

1844
02:15:47,097 --> 02:15:49,265
and complaining
that I've been unfair.

1845
02:15:49,349 --> 02:15:51,225
- Paul?
- Apparently, it's got to suit us.

1846
02:15:51,309 --> 02:15:56,397
You've only to speak. My boy,
and I'll leave the house to you entirely.

1847
02:15:56,481 --> 02:16:01,068
Since I have to be at the business all week.
I'll find something that suits me better.

1848
02:16:01,152 --> 02:16:06,824
This place is not really the country.
And, well, it's certainly not the town.

1849
02:16:08,159 --> 02:16:10,578
Does my arrangement
suit you, Evie?

1850
02:16:10,662 --> 02:16:13,080
- Of course, Father.
- Good. You, Dolly?

1851
02:16:13,164 --> 02:16:17,001
I thought Charles wanted it
for the boys...

1852
02:16:17,085 --> 02:16:20,004
but last time I saw him.
He said no...

1853
02:16:20,088 --> 02:16:22,673
because we can't possibly live
in this part of England again.

1854
02:16:23,758 --> 02:16:25,885
Charles even says
we ought to change our name...

1855
02:16:25,969 --> 02:16:28,095
but I can't think what to.

1856
02:16:28,179 --> 02:16:30,890
Wilcox just suits Charles and me.

1857
02:16:30,974 --> 02:16:33,976
I can't think of any other name.

1858
02:16:35,061 --> 02:16:37,062
Yes.

1859
02:16:38,148 --> 02:16:40,983
Then I leave Howards End
to my wife absolutely.

1860
02:16:41,067 --> 02:16:43,819
Let everyone understand that.
And after I'm dead...

1861
02:16:43,904 --> 02:16:47,239
let there be no jealousy
and no surprise.

1862
02:16:47,324 --> 02:16:50,034
In consequence,
I leave my wife no money —

1863
02:16:50,118 --> 02:16:54,121
that is her own wish — and all
my other assets are to be divided among you.

1864
02:16:55,916 --> 02:17:00,169
This house, Howards End, she intends,
at her death, to leave to her nephew.

1865
02:17:05,800 --> 02:17:09,011
- Whoop!
- [Baby Coos]

1866
02:17:10,513 --> 02:17:14,099
It does seem curious. Mrs. Wilcox
wanted Margaret to have Howards —

1867
02:17:14,184 --> 02:17:17,603
- Shh!
- And now she gets it after all.

1868
02:17:17,687 --> 02:17:20,731
- Dolly.
- Did I put my foot in it?

1869
02:17:28,698 --> 02:17:33,243
Hmm? Yeah. Yeah.

1870
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:41,585
[Helen] Come on.
Let's get out of the way. Come on.

1871
02:17:42,963 --> 02:17:45,172
Take baby's hand.

1872
02:17:49,052 --> 02:17:51,887
Oh, look. What's over there?

1873
02:17:53,223 --> 02:17:55,849
I wonder what it is.

1874
02:17:55,934 --> 02:18:00,187
Oh, it's a sweet child. Rather
like didums was at that age.

1875
02:18:00,271 --> 02:18:02,648
Come along, Dolly.

1876
02:18:04,109 --> 02:18:06,402
- [Margaret] Safe journey.
- Good-bye.

1877
02:18:06,486 --> 02:18:09,113
Trapped.

1878
02:18:09,197 --> 02:18:12,157
Come on. It's time
away we came from the jungle.

1879
02:18:12,242 --> 02:18:15,411
Look.
Look who's there. Look.

1880
02:18:19,541 --> 02:18:22,167
What did Dolly mean
about Howards End?

1881
02:18:22,252 --> 02:18:24,253
Hmm?

1882
02:18:24,337 --> 02:18:27,631
My poor Ruth.
During her last days...

1883
02:18:27,716 --> 02:18:30,759
scribbled your name
on a piece of paper.

1884
02:18:30,844 --> 02:18:34,471
Knowing her not to be herself.
I set it aside.

1885
02:18:35,598 --> 02:18:37,599
Didn't do wrong. Did I?

1886
02:18:37,684 --> 02:18:39,810
- There. They're off.
- [Auto Passing]

1887
02:18:39,894 --> 02:18:41,979
There they go. Bye.

1888
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:45,441
Bye.
