[Thinking]
September 23.Journal entry one.

2
00:00:11,591 --> 00:00:15,027
I'm Liz Parker,
and five days ago I died.

3
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:18,292
After that,
things got really weird.

4
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:20,424
[Service Bell Dings]

5
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:26,062
Okay.

6
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:32,538
I have got one Sigourney Weaver.
That's for you.

7
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:36,571
And one Will Smith.
Can I get you guys anything else?

8
00:00:36,616 --> 00:00:39,915
Green Martian shake?
Blood of Alien smoothie?

9
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:41,419
- You... No.
- No.

10
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:44,753
- We're good. Thanks.
- Are you here for the Crash Festival?

11
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:46,759
- Yeah. Can't wait.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:46,827 --> 00:00:49,227
So, does your family come from Roswell?

13
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:52,424
- Just four generations.
- Really?

14
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:58,062
Uh, does anyone in your family have
some stories about the U.F.O. Crash or...

15
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:02,206
I guess it would be okay
to show you guys this.

16
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:10,350
[Man]
I don't wanna hear the words anymore.

17
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:12,352
I wanna see the money on the table.

18
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:15,582
- Refill? Hmm.
- No. Get outta here.

19
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:19,682
My grandmother took this picture at the crash
site right before the government cleans it up.

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,489
Do people know about this photograph?

21
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:24,928
I know about it.
And now you know about it.

22
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:26,158
- Whoa.
- Wow.

23
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:30,033
I'm gonna be right back.
Don't show that to anyone.

24
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:31,661
Yeah.

25
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:36,701
You are so bad, girl.

26
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:39,712
Oh, and Max Evans
is staring at you again.

27
00:01:39,813 --> 00:01:45,046
No way.
Maria, that is so in your imagination.

28
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:52,214
Max Evans? This?
No. Uh-uh. It's not...

29
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:54,418
And with those cheeks,
preciosita tan linda.

30
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:56,428
Maria, no, okay?

31
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:59,590
I mean, and even if it were,
I'm going out with Kyle.

32
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:03,966
He's steady and loyal
and he appreciates me.

33
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:06,471
Sounds like you're describing a poodle.

34
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,565
[Man Yelling]
That's your plan? Give you another day?

35
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:11,839
- You're running outta time.!
- Liz!

36
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:14,380
I was here to get the money today,
not tomorrow.!

37
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:16,881
- You won't need money if you're dead.
- Get down.!

38
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:25,056
Come on.
Come on, come on.!

39
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,491
Liz.

40
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,628
- What are you doing? Let got of me.
- Max, what are you gonna do?

41
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,725
- Liz?
- Call an ambulance.

42
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:41,940
- It's gonna be okay.
- Oh, my God.

43
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:45,000
Hey! Get back!

44
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:48,013
Liz. Liz?
You have to look at me.

45
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:50,344
- Um, I need an ambulance.
- You have to look at me.

- [Sirens Approaching]
- Keys! Now!

50
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:32,181
You broke the bottle and you fell,
spilled ketchup on yourself.

51
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:34,591
Don't say anything, please.

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,591
- Liz, are you okay?

Oh, my God.

54
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:57,679
No, Dad. Dad, look at this.
See? I'm fine.

55
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:00,515
I just spilled ketchup.
I'm really... I'm okay.

56
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:02,748
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

57
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:06,724
The guy with the gun, right, was kinda
like a muscular Beavis, you know?

58
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:10,058
And then the other one
was like a beefy Butt-head.

59
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,564
I'm gonna need
a better description than that.

60
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:15,567
I'm assuming
that they weren't actually cartoons.

61
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:19,265
Excuse me.

- You okay?
- Uh, yeah. Thanks.

65
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:35,721
L-I'm just a little shaken up.

66
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:40,522
Sheriff, the suspects ran out
right after the incident occurred.

67
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:43,324
Couple of outsiders.
There's no apparent robbery...

68
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:45,330
no injuries other than
the girl that fell.

69
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:48,890
Itjust seems like an argument
that got out ofhand.

70
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:51,800
Hey! I told you two to stay outta there.

71
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:54,840
- Couple of tourists in town for the Crash.
- Uh, Sheriff.

72
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:59,174
Hi. Um, I'm sorry. I really need to talk to you.
I think something happened here.

73
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:03,807
- What do you think happened?
- The gunman was standing right over there, right?

74
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:06,943
And the shot was fired
into this direction.

75
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,181
Now, Jen and I we searched
this entire place up and down.

76
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:11,849
And, I mean, there's...
Where's the bullet?

77
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:15,060
We haven't found a bullet hole yet,
Sheriff.

78
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:18,928
Yeah, and Sheriff, before it happened,
the girl gave me this.

79

Jeff.

80

- Yeah?

[Jack] I told you, no showing
the alien photos to the tourists.

82
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:42,186
There were two kids sitting over here
when it happened. Two boys about her age.

83
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:44,189
- Then one of them went...
- You know, that's right. There were.

84
00:05:44,257 --> 00:05:48,660
You know that I didn't recognize them,
so they must've been tourists.

85
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:51,492
No. No, it sure looked like
that she knew them to me.

00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:44,109
Okay. We spent the last week
talking about genus and phylum.

89
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:46,175
And now we're gonna
get a little more specific...

90
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:48,948
and talk about the difference
between species.

91
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:52,423
For today's experiment,
you'll be working in teams of two.

92
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:54,653
Mr. Evans.
So nice to have you join us.

93
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:59,222
Okay. Everyone on the right, prepare
a slide with a vegetable sampling.

94
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:02,996
Everyone on the left, take a toothpick
and get a sample from your cheek.

95
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:11,107
- Mr. Evans?
- Could I get a bathroom pass?

High-maintenance today, aren't we?

97
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:20,211
It's very easy to look on the outside
and say...

98
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:23,881
what differentiates humans
from other species.

99
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:26,391
But what about
what's on the inside?

100
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,121
Everyone look at the human cells...

101
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:32,562
and describe everything you see
on your lab sheets.

- Shaken up.

- Yeah. I am. It was just loud and then it was over.

So, Max, what I'm gonna suggest to you...

133
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:25,960
is that we just go back into the bio lab now
so that I can take a sample...

134

so that I can see
what I'm thinking is wrong, you know...

that I got the wrong cells.

No one.

156
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:05,960
You don't understand
what will happen if you do.

157
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,308
Liz, please.

158
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,009
Now my life is in your hands.

159
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:34,958
Well, it says right here that shots
were fired but no one was injured.

160
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:37,502
Then where's Liz?
I mean, why is she avoiding me?

161
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,504
Okay, first of all,
Liz is never late, right?

162
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:43,133
She walks into home room today
and goes and sits next to Pam Troy.

163
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:47,804
She, like, hates Pam Troy, and you know,
goes about admitting it openly and...

164
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:50,144
- Alex, are you listening to me?
- Uh, yeah.

165
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:52,150
Yeah, Maria.
I'm listening to you.

166
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:54,846
But this is just you being you,
all right?

167
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:58,084
Liz is fine. Nothing happened.
It's all right here in black and white.

168
00:12:58,157 --> 00:13:01,615
[Boy On P.A.] Hey, guys, don't forget your
costume for this weekend's Crash Festival.

169
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:03,889
Five hundred big bones
for the best costume.

170
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:08,332
Now, let's get down with our little
higgly-giggly and alien selves.

171
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:13,639
I can't believe this, Max.

172
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:16,368
You know, I finally feel like
I have a quasi-normal existence...

173
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:19,377
and you blow it all
with one random act of lunacy.

174
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:21,640
How did you let
my misguided brother do this?

175
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:24,615
Hey. Don't turn this around on me. I'm
not the one who thinks he's a superhero.

176
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:27,619
- Look. I said I was sorry.
- You're sorry?

177
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:30,622
You break a sacred pact
and that's all you have to say?

178
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,488
It's against the rules, Max,
the rules we made.

179
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,493
You use your powers all the time.

180

[Sighs]
Recreationally.

181

- [Sizzles]
- The important thing is to contain this.

182
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:45,162
We just have to figure out
what to say to Miss Scientist.

183
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,009
Oh, my God.
You told her.

184
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:54,179
I didn't have a choice.

185
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:56,181
It's gonna be okay.

186
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:58,217
Don't your realize
that everything has changed?

187
00:13:58,284 --> 00:14:00,252
- No, it hasn't.
- Max, she's right. We're screwed.

188
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:04,322
It's time to leave Roswell.

189
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:08,719
- Michael, we can't just leave.
- Yeah, we can.

190
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:12,389
We've always known this day would come.
We said when it did, we'd be prepared.

191
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:15,059
Michael, where are we gonna go?

192
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:17,136
You know, Roswell's home.

193
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:19,170
[Sighs]

194
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:23,174
Roswell's not home.
It's not even our solar system.

195
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:25,369
Well, this is the closest thing
we have to home right now.

196
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:29,540
For you two, maybe. It was you the Evanses
found on the side of the road, not me.

197
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:33,483
They're like real parents. My foster dad,
hejust keeps me around for the monthly check.

198
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:42,861
This is gonna be okay.
We should just lay low...

199
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:46,961
- go back to school and act normal.
- Act normal?

200
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:50,491
That's your big plan, Max? Don't you
realize it's only a matter of time...

201
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,801
before they find us and turn us over
to some government agency...

202
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:58,343
where they're gonna test us and prod us
and, oh, yeah, exterminate us.

- So I called, like, 37 times.

206
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:34,371
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Liz, what happened yesterday?

207
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:38,850
[Sighs] What do you mean, Maria?
You were there. You...

208
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,909
You saw everything.

209
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:44,252
Did I, 'cause, um, this isn't ketchup.

210
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:47,459
This looks a lot like blood to me.

211
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:51,088
What did Max do to you?

00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:09,244
- [Music Stops]
- Yeah, like listening to a C.D. Is the problem.

215
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:15,448

Max, go.
Let's get out of here.

218
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:23,018
We can't start acting guilty.

- Yeah. Nothing.

- Of course, Officer.

224
00:16:55,928 --> 00:17:00,388
Thank you, Mr. Evans. We had a little
trouble at the Crashdown Café yesterday.

225
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:02,696
You kids be careful out there.

- No, it won't.

Our cover is blown, and I'm not gonna hang
around and wait for them to catch us.

No one is caught yet. I mean,
we don't even know if there is a "them."

233
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:39,827
What happened to our parents?
What happened to everybody else on the ship?

234
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:44,672
They didn't disappear.
They were killed, and you know that.

235
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:49,475
Liz won't tell anyone.
She's different.

236
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:53,006
Really?
So how'd she react when you told her?

237
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:56,680
"Great. You're an alien.
That's fantastic. Excellent"?

238
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,115
Nah, I didn't think so.

- Oh. Right, right.

Listen, Liz,
you've been somewhere else all night.

244
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:30,386
I know. I'm sorry.

245
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:35,385
Kyle, do you ever wonder if...

246
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:39,125
Do I ever wonder what?

247
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:43,524
When you see me, do you...
do you feel things?

248
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:46,036
Yes, of course.

249
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:49,097
I feel things.
Like what?

250
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:53,038
Forget it.

251
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:55,376
I don't know what I was talking about.

252
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:57,712
I'm just gonna go get some sleep.

I have to talk to you.

00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:41,025
I can't imagine
how you must feel right now.

260
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:45,052
I mean, I've thought about
telling you a thousand times.

00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,894
You have? Me?

263
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:52,637
Sorry.

264
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:58,507
I just, uh... I just keep picturing you
in that dress with the, uh...

265
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:00,511
the cupcakes on it.

266
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,672
What?

267
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:05,876
Forget it.
It was a long time ago.

268
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:08,784
Oh, my God.
[Sighs]

269
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:12,324
That's... That's right. I can't believe
I actually wore that thing!

270
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:14,188
L...

271
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:18,660
I had that dress in kindergarten.

272
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:20,665
I didn't know you until the third grade.

273
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:24,396
- Did you, like, read my mind or something?
- No. I don't read minds.

274
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:28,801
When I healed you, I made this...
I don't know. This connection.

275
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:31,672
And I got this rush of... of images.

276
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:35,441
An image of that dress
flashed into my mind...

277
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:37,880
and I knew how you felt about it.

278
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:41,719
How did I feel about it?

279
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:45,747
It was the single supreme
embarrassment of your life.

280
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:48,993
But your mom made it for you.

281
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:52,462
She was so proud of it.
She never made a dress before.

282
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:56,365
So you wore it for her sake.

283
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:01,231
I've never tried this before, but...

284
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:04,208
maybe I could make the connection
go the other way...

285
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:07,368
so, you can see, you know, that...

286
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:10,982
that I'm still me.

287
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:15,580
I have to touch you.

288
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,933
Now, just take deep breaths...

289
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:33,096
and try and let your mind blank out.

290
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:50,144
[Liz]
I could feel everything he was feeling.

291
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:58,691
I could feel his loneliness.

292
00:21:58,764 --> 00:22:02,632
For the first time,
I was really seeing Max Evans.

293
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:07,296
I saw me as he saw me.

294
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:10,467
And the amazing thing was...

295
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:15,479
in his eyes, I was beautiful.

296
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,113
Did it work?

297
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:38,102
[Liz]
Max Evans has put a force on me.

298
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:44,172
It's like my whole life
changed in an instant.

299
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:50,182
It's just so ironic that when something
like this finally happened to me...

300
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,848
it was with an alien.

301
00:22:58,223 --> 00:23:00,123
Hey.

302
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:02,090
Oh. Hey, Alex.

303
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:04,857
[Sighs] Have you seen
my book bag anywhere?

304
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:09,026
No, I haven't.
Um, can I talk to you for a second?

305
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:11,035
Yeah. What's up?

306
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:15,199
Well, I'm your friend
and I'm Maria's friend too...

307
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:18,539
so if you lie to Maria,
it's sort of like lying to me.

308
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,475
Alex, what did Maria say to you?

309
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:24,880
Well, frankly, it's vague. I mean, everything
needs to be put through the Maria filter.

310
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,477
But she said something about
how she found blood on your order book.

311
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:30,919
What's going on?

312
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:34,720
Alex, Maria's a total drama queen.
You know that.

313
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:36,920
Nothing is going on.

314
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:40,192
Okay, well, look.
All I care about is that you're okay.

315
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:43,257
- So, you are, right? You're okay?
- I'm okay.

316
00:23:43,335 --> 00:23:45,599
- All right.
- Okay.

317
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:49,801
And whatever happened is over now?

318
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,309
Hey. It is totally over.

319
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:54,402
- Okay.
- Okay.

320
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:59,184
- There she is.
- Miss Parker...

321
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:01,276
the sheriff needs to
ask you some questions.

322
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:11,055
Afternoon, Miss Parker. Your father
said it'd be okay if I talked to you.

323
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,598
I'm sorry to have to show you these.

324
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:21,099
This man was found dead
with no apparent cause of death...

325
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:23,971
except that.

326
00:24:25,978 --> 00:24:28,378
What do you make of that mark?

327
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:34,047
I've never seen anything
like that before.

328
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:37,486
Kyle said he saw a similar mark
on your stomach.

329
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:41,118
He was wrong.

330
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:45,185
I'm sure.
Kyle's got a pretty wild imagination.

331
00:24:46,498 --> 00:24:48,489
Yeah.

332
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:52,433
I'm gonna need to see for myself, Liz.

333
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:55,166
Come on, Sheriff.
I mean...

334
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,903
I told you that I spilled ketchup
and l...

335
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:01,571
I said that, like, a thousand times.

336
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:04,275
Liz, please?

337
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:24,592
Mark faded on the corpse too.

338
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:28,496
What do you know about a kid
named Max Evans?

339
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:32,440
- Max Evans? Um...
- Mm-hmm.

340
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,114
I don't know him all that well.

341
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:40,242
- Was he one of the kids
at the Crashdown that day?
- No.

342
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,516
- I see.
- Can I go home now, Sheriff?

343
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,415
Just one more thing.

344
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:52,593
Somebody turned in this book bag.

345
00:25:52,664 --> 00:25:54,689
It is yours, isn't it?

346
00:25:57,903 --> 00:25:59,894
Good. Good, good.

347
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:05,840
[Valenti]
A shot was fired.

348
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:08,038
There's a bullet hole in the dress.

349
00:26:08,113 --> 00:26:11,674
I'm telling you. The girl was shot.

350
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:19,824
What are you doing?

351
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:23,156
I have a flying saucer sighting
in Phoenix...

352
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:26,686
an accountant in Barstow
who thinks he's Jesus.

353
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:28,824
Both cases are more solid than this one.

354
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:32,360
I'll have this checked out at the lab.

355
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:36,635
Call me, Sheriff,
if you ever have anything real.

356
00:26:38,143 --> 00:26:41,203
Listen, you guys told me to call you
if I saw anything.

357
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,214
Well, my son saw that handprint.

358
00:26:43,282 --> 00:26:45,216
I'm sure he did.

359
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:47,878
- What happens now?
- I'm gonna have the lab check out the dress.

360
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:50,887
I'm gonna handle this case in the proper
manner without getting too personal.

361
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:53,048
I suggest you do the same.

362
00:26:54,826 --> 00:26:58,592
I'm not walking away from this. I'm gonna be
a part of this investigation.

363
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:01,758
Sheriff, do you know what everyone
at the Agency used to call your father?

364
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,768
Sergeant Martian.
You don't wanna end up like him.

365
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,940
Agent Stevens...

366
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:15,639
I was eight years old
when my father discovered that corpse.

367
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:19,081
My whole life, I thought he was as crazy
as everybody else did...

368
00:27:19,151 --> 00:27:21,278
crazy to believe.

369
00:27:21,353 --> 00:27:23,617
Well, now I'm not so sure.

370
00:27:23,722 --> 00:27:26,953
Thank you, Sheriff.
Your work is done now. We'll take it from here.

371
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,027
[Engine Starts]

372
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:43,841
I need to know the truth, Max.

373
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:47,845
I need to know everything,
or else I'm just gonna go to Valenti...

374
00:27:47,913 --> 00:27:50,711
and I'm gonna tell him
everything I know.

375
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:52,545
Okay.

376
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,454
Okay.

377
00:27:57,656 --> 00:27:59,624
Okay.

378
00:28:01,693 --> 00:28:03,923
All right. Here we go.

379
00:28:05,864 --> 00:28:09,698
- Where did you come from?
- I don't know.

380
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:12,202
When the ship crashed,
I wasn't born yet.

381
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,965
So there was a crash?

382
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:17,531
All I know is it wasn't
a weather balloon that fell that night.

383
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:22,137
The ship crashed in 1947.
You're 16.

384
00:28:22,214 --> 00:28:25,377
We were in some kind of incubation pods.

385
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,975
We?

386
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:31,784
Isabel and Michael are, uh, also...

387
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,818
Okay.

388
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:40,387
Well, that answers, um, that question.

389
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:44,026
Um...

390
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:47,196
what powers do you have?

391
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:50,207
We can connect with people...

392
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:53,267
as, uh, you know.

393
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:56,872
We can manipulate molecular structures
and we can...

394
00:28:56,948 --> 00:28:58,882
Wait.
Um, what does that mean?

395
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:22,430
That's, uh...
That's how I healed you.

396
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:26,777
Max...

397
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:28,836
who else knows this?

398
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:32,008
- No one.
- What about your parents?

399
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:34,644
We don't tell anyone.

400
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:37,017
We sorta think our lives depend on it.

401
00:29:39,057 --> 00:29:42,356
So when you healed me, you risked all this
getting out, didn't you?

402
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:44,224
Yeah.

403
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:46,160
Why?

404
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:51,099
It was you.

405
00:29:56,942 --> 00:30:01,038
Um, Max, Valenti showed me
this photo of a corpse.

406
00:30:01,113 --> 00:30:05,072
A murder victim. It had the same
silver handprint on its chest.

407
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,947
That can't be.

408
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:10,749
- The photo was marked "1959."
- That's impossible.

409
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:12,790
Kyle saw the handprint
on my stomach...

410
00:30:12,891 --> 00:30:16,486
and Valenti found my waitress uniform
with the bullet hole in it.

411
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:19,689
He just asked me if you were in the café
during the shooting.

412
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:22,631
Max, he suspects you.

413
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:29,900
- Max.
- I have to go.

414
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:32,170
Wait, Max. Wait. Go where?
Where are you going?

- Max!

It's time to leave.

- I'm wearing it.

421
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:08,443
Before I go to this idiotic Crash Festival,
I want to know everything.

422
00:31:08,513 --> 00:31:11,539
And if you don't tell me
the truth right now...

423
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:15,108
I'm gonna go to Valenti myself
and tell him everything I know.

What do you know?

Well, [Huffs] l...

00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:23,190
I know that Max
was in the diner that day.

427
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:27,357
And I know that he went up to you when
you were shot, and, like, did something.

428
00:31:27,465 --> 00:31:33,335
And I know that the one person in the world
that I thought I could completely trust...

429
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:35,339
is lying to me.

You have to promise me
that you are not gonna flip out.

Hey. It's me.

- Maria.!

So with this picture,
what we're saying is there's more of us?

435
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,131
One more.
At least there was in 1959.

436
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:04,566
So then there's hope.
I mean, if we can find him...

437
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:06,603
he can tell us where we came from,
what we are...

Michael, calm down. We had
one potential relative 40 years ago.

439
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:12,535
All we know about him
is he was a potential killer.

whole, like, valedictorian path, you know?

to being a world-renowned scientist.
I was gonna be your wacky friend.

friend to someone who's already wacky.

maybe we can throw Valenti off.
