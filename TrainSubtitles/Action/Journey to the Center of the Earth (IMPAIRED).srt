01:25:16,627 --> 01:25:19,221
[SINGING "O CANADA"]

1110
01:25:21,532 --> 01:25:25,229
I'd say that was a lot of male bonding
packed into very little time.

1111
01:25:25,403 --> 01:25:28,770
What do you say
we take a couple weeks next time?

1112
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:30,407
A couple weeks?

1113
01:25:30,575 --> 01:25:33,043
- What are you doing over Christmas break?
- Nothing. I'm free.

1114
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:35,338
I just found this in your dad's stuff.

1115
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:37,374
Give it a read.

1116
01:25:37,548 --> 01:25:39,539
- <i>"Lost City of Atlantis."</i>
TREVOR: Mm-hm.

1117
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:41,275
We'll talk.

1118
01:25:44,355 --> 01:25:45,447
Sean, what is that?

1119
01:25:46,157 --> 01:25:48,250
- I'm just feeding my pet.
- What pet?

1120
01:25:48,426 --> 01:25:50,394
Sean.

1121
01:25:50,695 --> 01:25:53,186
- You think my mom will let me keep him?
- I don't know.

1122
01:25:53,364 --> 01:25:55,457
Might not even stay here.

1123
01:25:55,633 --> 01:25:57,430
- Look at it.
- Hey, come on.

1124
01:25:57,602 --> 01:25:59,797
- This is your problem.
- Where are you going?

1125
01:26:00,271 --> 01:26:03,007
I got some food for you. Come on.
Come back down here.

1126
01:26:03,274 --> 01:26:04,866
Come on.

1127
01:32:30,961 --> 01:32:32,952
