Nothing. He was calm the entire time.

336
00:22:06,036 --> 00:22:07,418
What about his heart?

337
00:22:07,454 --> 00:22:10,205
I heard it jump, but only
once, and only for a second.

338

That doesn't mean he was lying.

Not really.

When did it jump? What was I talking about?

342
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:21,766
It was when you said that
your dad was poisoned.

That could be something.

344

00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:28,389
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

346
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:30,775
So why would he be surprised
that my dad's still dying?

Oh, wait.

No.
