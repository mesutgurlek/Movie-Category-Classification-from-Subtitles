He killed people

That's what
soldiers do.

133
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,462
It doesn't mean
he's a thief.

<i>Did he say where</i>
<i>he got the money from?</i>

135

He said,
"Maybe God."

136
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,809
Anyway, what do you think
the police themselves

137
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,610
would do with it
if you handed it in?

138
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,113
<i>They'd just share it out</i>
<i>and drink it in the pub.</i>

139
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,751
or at Christmas,
get them all jumpers
or something.

140
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,158
Actually, he told me
to buy something for myself.

141
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:22,200
I thought perhaps maybe
I could use

142
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,502

<i>Hummingbird drone, over.</i>

177
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,313
<i>Yeah, he's got a weapon</i>

178
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,048
<i>Hummingbird can see it.</i>
<i>He's got a weapon.</i>

179
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,451

180

Sister.

188
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,003
I'm afraid you're
too late for soup.

189
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,472
I'm not hungry.

190
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,908
I need medicine.

191
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,109
You're hurt?

192
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,545
I need antibiotics.

193
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,847
I'm not allowed
to dispense antibiotics.

194
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,517
But you do it for people
who can't get into the system.

195
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,886
- <i>Go to emergency.</i>
<i>- I can't.</i>

196
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,723
Why not?
If you don't want
to give your name,

197
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:41,058
just call yourself
Smith or something.

198
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,693
That would be
a mistake.

199
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,129
- Why?
- My name <i>is</i> Smith.

200
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:46,997
Jones, then.

201
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:47,932
Sister...

202
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,536
I'm on the run
from a court-martial.

203
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,939
I was in
a Special Forces unit.

204
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,408
There'll be
no forgiveness.

205
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,847
How do you know
it's antibiotics you need?

206
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,448
I've got two broken ribs.

207
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,916
There's an infection
around one of the breaks.

208
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,518
If it spreads
to the bone, I'll die.

209
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,455
I've been
wounded before.

210
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,657
If you drink alcohol
with these, they won't work.

211
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,459
I'll need
painkillers.

212
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,695
Give me something
with dihydrocodeine.

213
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,764
Yes, sir.

214
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,935
I've asked around
about your friend Isabel.

215
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,173
How'd you know
about Isabel?

216
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,809
Last night,
don't you remember?

217
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,577
Did I come here
last night?

218
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,046
Do something stupid?

219
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:38,582
You said you'd
had some luck.

220
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,519
<i>"God," you said.</i>

221

222

You don't believe?

223
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,162
So how do you explain
those new clothes?

224
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:52,897
I don't.

225
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,734
So what'd you find out
about Isabel?

226
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:58,803
She doesn't come
for food anymore.

227
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:11,048
If you see her,
give her this.

228
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,151
Tell her she
can come to me.

229
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,620
Tell her
she can be safe.

230
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,757
- Who lives here?
- Me.

231
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,025
- Did you break in?
- I fell.

232
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:22,726
Did you hurt someone?

233
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,728
Only myself.

234
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,674
Do you know the boys
say you're an angel?

235
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,510
Good night, Joseph.

I got a lot
of businesses.

345
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,312
They say you're
a hard man.

346
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:43,814
It's a hard city.

347

350
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,821
Can we play
the animal game?

351
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:26,389
( sighs )
Go on, then.

352
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:29,593
- Um... has it got
four legs?
- Yes.

353
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:31,795
All right,
has it got fur?

354
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,330
Girl: <i>Yes.</i>

355
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,499
Woman:
<i>Um, give me</i>
<i>another clue.</i>

356
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,300
- <i>It's gray.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Gray?</i>

357
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,468
Yeah.

358
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,170
- Is it a dog?
- No.

359
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:43,173
<i>Um, could it eat me?</i>

360
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:44,241
<i>Probably.</i>

361
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:47,310
Right, so,
how many legs has it got?

362
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,546
- Two.
- You said four.

363
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:51,314
<i>Are you tricking me?</i>

364
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:22,612
I hear he wants
to see me.

366
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,504
What the fuck?

367
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,406
New rules.

368
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:51,608
No room service cards
anywhere between

369
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,842
Lisle Street
and The Crown.

370
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:55,312
What the fuck
are you talking about?

371
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:56,980
You're not even
a fucking Chink to be
giving out rules.

372
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:58,348

Can I help you?

381
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,505
I've got a delivery
for the Angel of the
Lord's Mission.

382
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:59,009
<i>45 Margheritas,</i>

<i>45 chicken dippers,</i>
<i>and 45 coleslaws.</i>

385

There must be
a mistake.

386
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:10,620
It's paid for
by Joey Jones.

387
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:13,023
Okay, it's not
a mistake.

388
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:14,024
Who wants pizza?

389
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,898
- ( speaking in
native language )
- ( baby crying )

390
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,012
Joey:
<i>Tell your boss</i>
<i>in fifteen minutes</i>

391
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,947
to have Mr. Choy's
envelope ready.

392
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,583
Also, I wanna order
takeaway for delivery.

393
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:43,353
It's very nice,
but I've no idea what it is.

394
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:44,754
I think
it's probably duck.

395
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,923
And there's fish
and chicken and pancakes.

396
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:49,759
- And this is from Crazy Joe
the angel, yeah?
- Next?

It's me.

406
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:48,685
Joe.

407
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,593
Nice suit.

408
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:58,428
Me and your daughter
live on £25 a week.

409
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,499
Since I lost my job,
I've been paying the landlord
with blowjobs.

410
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:07,670
What have you been doing
while they cut everything, Joey?

411
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,507
I've been fighting.

412
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:35,031
There's more
where this came from.

413
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,633
Lots more.

Joey:
<i>You got my invitation.</i>

418
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:23,513
Wasn't sure
you'd come.

419
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:25,048
Buying food for the boys,
it's okay,

420
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,016
but not this.

421
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,988
Giving me things puts me
in a very difficult position.

422
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,491
You're not vegetarian,
are ya?

423
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,895
Why are you lighting fires
on the pavement?

424
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,930
My Chinese boss
sends his people here

425
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,999
to buy meat
for his restaurants.

426
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,801
<i>I get three hours</i>

427

doing nothing.

428
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,941
So tonight I decided
to have a barbecue.

429
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,877
- <i>( cork pops )</i>
<i>- You used to feed me.</i>

430
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,847
Tonight, I feed you.

431
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,854
This is a very strange
thing to be doing.

432
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,293
I miss the smell
of woodsmoke.

433
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:13,563
I'm guessing that you have
psychological problems.

434
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:16,065
They put me
up a mountain

435
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:19,202
and told me
to kill people.

436
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:22,171
What'd they think would
come back down the mountain?

437
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,941
Joseph, I came here
because I might
have some news...

438
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,178
about Isabel.

439
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,648
<i>They found a girl.</i>

440
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,683
Last night,
my police liaison
officer

441
00:42:33,685 --> 00:42:35,218
gave me
this photograph.

442
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:37,954
She was found
in the river.

443
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:40,089
They need help
with identification.

444
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,760
<i>( spatula scrapes )</i>

445
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,082

446
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,692
She was from the north,
that's all I know.

447
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:18,361
Did you love her?

448
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:20,129
We shared a box.

449
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,965
We'd just keep
each other warm.

450
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,904
Will you talk
to the police?

451
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:29,172
Fuck the police.

452
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,782
Joseph, I'm really sorry
to bring such awful news.

453
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,185
Where in the river?

454
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:44,220
The city, near
to Canary Wharf.

455
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:46,356
One of those
rich guys.

456
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:48,057
Yes, they think she
was killed by a client.

457
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:50,259
- The police give a shit?
- Of course they do.

458
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:51,728
David is a good man.

459
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,697
Really?
He's a "good man."

460
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:57,734
Good, good.
Good for him.

461
00:43:57,736 --> 00:43:59,369

- ( yells )
- In the fucking river!

463
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:09,646
If you dare to be angry
about Isabel...

464
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:10,913
<i>you're a hypocrite.</i>

465
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,017
<i>I've asked around</i>
<i>about your job</i>

466
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:16,786
for the Chinese boss.

467
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:18,988
They say, "Crazy Joey
deals drugs."

468
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,257
I just deliver the stuff.
I don't touch the stuff.

469
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:25,728
The autopsy said Isabel
"touched the stuff."

470
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,731
Maybe stuff
you delivered.

471
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:31,300
You don't put those things
together in your head.

472
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:33,002
You know why she
ended up in the river?

473
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,672
Because that's what
the river's for.

474
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:38,775
To wash away girls when
they're finished with them.

475
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:41,711
I see what's happening
in this fucking city.

476
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:42,945
<i>How many people</i>
<i>you feed these days, huh?</i>

477
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:46,049
You give them soup.

478
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:47,850
They want
their lives back!

479
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,817
Joey, when you were
out of your head on drugs

480
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,952
a few months ago,
you gave me some money.

481
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,757
I've spent it on
something for myself.

482
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:30,493
I haven't been able
to sleep properly since.

483
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,930
I-- I called
my sister in Warsaw.

484
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,201
She sold some of
the possessions
I left behind.

485
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:46,843
I don't need this.

486
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,915
I'm really sorry
about Isabel.

487
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,517
I know you
cared for her,

488
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,788
but think about
all the other Isabels.

489
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:03,292
Start to do
the right thing.

490
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,997
It is honest money.
I cleaned it for you.

491
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:10,800
Use it to start
an honest life.

492
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,984
I want you
to have this.

493
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,288
I'm gonna do a lot
of good things
this summer.

494
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:34,557
Give people
what they want.

495
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:36,492
I thought you might
want a dress.

496
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:38,861
Joey, I'm a nun.

497
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:40,863
I used to wear
a uniform.

498
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:43,032
Don't mean a thing,
you just take it off.

499
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,804
If it looks
beautiful on you,

500
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:49,539
then God would say
it's okay, wouldn't He?

501
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,477
I will put it in
the bag of clothes
for Africa.

518
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:06,449
You've got a knife...

519
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,621
I've got a spoon.

520
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,025

522
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:20,930
Who killed Isabel?

523
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:23,366
- ( groans )
- ( yelling )

524
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:34,377
- <i>( cracks )</i>
<i>- ( yelling )</i>

525
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:40,283
Go on, Joey.
Show 'em. Show 'em!

526
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,221

527
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:57,166
( mumbles )

528
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:59,035
Who killed Isabel?

529
00:48:59,037 --> 00:49:01,003
I don't know.

530
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:02,705
( groans )

531
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,977
You're only alive
because I need information.

532
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,414
An eye for an eye.

533
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:16,719
You tell me
what happened to her,

534
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:19,655
or I'll kill you
with this spoon.

535
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:24,360
Some guy used to
rent her regular.

536
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:25,962
Beat her up.

537
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:28,030
He used to ask
for her.

538
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:30,132
He went too far.

539
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,667
Name.

540
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:33,269
We don't use names.

541
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:36,639
Describe him to me.

542
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,576
- Ah!
- Describe him to me.

543
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:44,013
He was about 30,
city boy,

544
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:45,681
scar over his eye.

545
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,350
That's all I know.

546
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,324
You get any trouble
from these two again,

547
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,259
you tell
Crazy Joe, okay?

548

<i>( music playing softly )</i>

552
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:32,088
Fuck.

553
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:34,657
You look--

554
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:36,092
Your note said
you had information

555
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:38,427
for the police
about Isabel's killer.

556
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,396
That is the only reason
I am here.

557
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:42,565
And I put on
this dress because

558
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:44,100
it is the only dress
I have.

559
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:47,770
And don't think I won't
send it to Africa,

560
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,271
because I will.

561
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,709
They think my name's Damon,
by the way.

562
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:55,377
Please don't remind me.

563
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:59,782
- I think I might faint.
- What?

564
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,817
I haven't eaten
anything all day...

565
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:04,120
worrying whether
or not I would come.

566
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,460
Also, I didn't realize

567
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,695
there would be
so many naked men.

568
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,301
( gasps )

569
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,472
Look, I arranged
to meet you here

570
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,441
because I thought
you might like the
photographs.

571
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:26,775
I didn't realize
there'd be photographs

572
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:28,644
of men's... penises.

573
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,413
Sorry.

574
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:34,216
Joey, actually,
I do like photographs.

575
00:52:34,218 --> 00:52:37,386
I take photographs--
usually of nature.

576
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:40,656
Penises are nature,
I suppose.

577
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,858
Yes, I suppose they are.

578
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,393
So what'd
you tell the mother?

579
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:47,263
I lied, I lied,
I lied.

580
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,766
So what information
do you have?

581
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:53,636
Tell your policeman
to look for a guy
around 30.

582
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:55,638
He has a scar
above his eye.

583
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,439
Works in the city.

584
00:52:57,441 --> 00:52:59,408
Should I
write this down?

585
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,477
That's all I have.

586
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:03,412
Okay...

587
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:06,682
30 years old,
scar above his eye,

588
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,918
works in the city.
Got it.

589
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,886
We haven't been
introduced.

590
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:12,755
I'm Karl.
What's your name?

591
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:16,525
Just looking around.

592
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,762
I'm told the invitation
you handed in at the desk

593
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:21,897
was addressed
to Damon Coldfield.

594
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:24,300
I happen to be Damon's
photographic agent.

595
00:53:24,302 --> 00:53:25,501
He's in New York.

596
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,637
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

597
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:43,786

598
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,256
I think you're
a bit drunk.

599
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:48,757
Yes.

600
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,662
I'm having
a crazy patch.

601
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,266
Starting when
I bought the ticket.

602
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:00,669
What ticket?

603
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,376
I used your money to buy
a ticket to a ballet.

604
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,451
That's a pretty
wicked thing to do.

605
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,825
( chuckles )

606
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:25,561
But, you see...

607
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:27,630
I've loved her
since I was a little girl.

608
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:30,899
Loved who?

609
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,004
Maria Zielinska.

610
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,675
She's 42
and still dancing.

611
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,579
She is who I always
wanted to be.

612
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:47,349
She is who
I should have been.

613
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,921
( speaking Polish )

614
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,626
I'm in a silk dress
in an alleyway...

615
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:58,761
with a gangster.

616
00:54:58,763 --> 00:55:00,963
- Whoa!
- Oop!

617
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:02,765
And I'm drunk.

618
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,470
Are you still
a gangster, Joey,
or did I change you?

619
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,476
Just having
a crazy patch, too.

620
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,014
There are things
that I have to do.

621
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,884
When the summer's over,
I'll stop.

622
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:24,386
Because of me, yes?

623
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:26,355
I have to think
I'm doing good.

624
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,726
Your excuse for wearing
a pretty dress.

625
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,067
When does Damon return?

626
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,036
October the first.

627
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:44,006
( scoffs )
Then it's fate.

628
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:46,575
What is?

629
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:48,977
<i>When I say</i>
<i>it's fate...</i>

630
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:52,448
I should really say
it's God, but I don't.

631
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,651
You know why?

632
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,490
Because I'm not so sure
that God is there anymore.

633
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,627
That's the truth.

634
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,066
( speaking Polish )

635
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,437
I think I'm going
to throw up.

636
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:17,740
Oh.

637
00:56:17,742 --> 00:56:19,408
No, I'm fine.

638
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:26,882
Sister,
I'm Catholic.

639
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:35,724
I'm not your sister.

640
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,762
I'm drunk and I'm
up against the wall.

Things are okay.

653
00:58:00,211 --> 00:58:01,643
Yeah, he's okay.

You seem
so together now.

I'm really
together now.

You're like
a different person.

So, Joey...

<i>Homeless Mission,</i>
<i>Covent Garden.</i>

696
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:51,980
Is there a problem?
You are scaring my clients.

697
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,316
We're looking
for someone.

698
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,385
<i>Calls himself</i>
<i>Joey Jones.</i>

699
01:00:56,387 --> 01:00:58,654
<i>( helicopter blades</i>
<i>whirring )</i>

700
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:00,389
We've been told
he used to come down here.

701
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,926
<i>They said you'd know</i>
<i>where to find him.</i>

702
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:16,872
<i>( church bell ringing )</i>

703
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,044
Let me help ya.

704
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,747
What are you
doing here?

705
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,826
I just lied
to the police.

706
01:01:37,828 --> 01:01:40,128
You haven't
changed at all.

707
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,097
If I could
do something else,
I would do it.

708
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,300
What did
the policeman say

709
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:47,836
when you gave him
the description?

710
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,940
He laughed at me.

711
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:53,842
He said it was
"too vague."

712
01:01:53,844 --> 01:01:55,944
He said, "Tell
Joey Jones to come

713
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:57,979
and speak
to us himself."

714
01:01:57,981 --> 01:01:59,981
You mean they
can't be bothered
to fucking look

715
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:02,150
'cause she was
a whore.

716
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:05,287
The truth is...

717
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:06,888
the police
are more interested

718
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,090
in finding out
more about <i>you.</i>

719
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:11,359
You're becoming
famous, Joey.

720
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:13,028
<i>And Isabel</i>
<i>isn't famous?</i>

721
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,932
You really are
a hypocrite.

722
01:02:16,934 --> 01:02:21,269
You beat Taxman so bad
he's still in hospital.

723
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:23,038
You're not
just an angel,

724
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,508
you're God Almighty
dispensing justice.

725
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:29,177
<i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>I believe in justice.</i>

726
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:31,780
Sometimes you have to
make it happen yourself.

727
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:34,816
I'm not the only
hypocrite here.

728
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:38,487
Want a kiss?

729
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:49,064
<i>( door opens )</i>

730
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,338
- Sorry.
- Get out of my car.

731
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,539
It's a van.

732
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:05,947
I suppose you think
it was very funny
that I got drunk.

733
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:08,784
I've been drunk myself
on occasion.

734
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:10,519
What exactly happened?

735
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:11,920
You don't remember?

736
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:15,557
It's all a blur.

737
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:17,959
You asked me to kiss you,
so I kissed you.

738
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,865
( sighs )

739
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:26,234
You didn't have
to kiss me

740
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:28,870
just because
I asked.

741
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:31,072
I wanted to.

742
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,584
Why did you want to?

743
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:44,486
That's a really
stupid question.

744
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,523
Look in the mirror.

745
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,360
It's not my fault
that I'm fucked up.

746
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:54,963
For a nun, your language
is pretty bad.

747
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:01,169
So whose fault is it?

748
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,192
He was my
gymnastics instructor.

749
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,600
It was in Warsaw.

750
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:39,541
It was my father
who made me do
gymnastics.

751
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:44,346
I wanted to be
a ballerina,

752
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:46,114
but he said no.

753
01:04:57,027 --> 01:05:00,528
Cristina:
<i>If I had become</i>
<i>a ballerina,</i>

754
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,663
<i>it wouldn't</i>
<i>have happened.</i>

755
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:13,575
My instructor
began to...

756
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,113
( shudders )

757
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:25,020
He began to do it
when I was 10 years old.

758
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,362
He did it 17 times.

759
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,035
<i>It was going to be</i>
<i>the 18th time.</i>

760
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:56,952
For a very long time,
I believed I belonged in hell.

761
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:01,690
Because I was
so young...

762
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:06,461
they decided not
to send me to prison.

763
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:15,337
Instead, they sent me
to a convent.

764
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:26,715
Joey, I...

765
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:34,556
I have never told this
to anyone before.

766
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,332
Want me to drive?

767
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:47,168
I want someone
to drive.

768
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:53,074
<i>( door signal beeps )</i>

769
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,586
Cristina:
<i>Here will be fine.</i>

770
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:15,130
<i>( engine stops )</i>

771
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:16,631
How will you
get home?

772
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,637
I'm a gangster.
I'll steal a car.

773
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,647
I'll walk.

774
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:34,816
It's a lovely
morning.

775
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:38,486
( sighs )

776
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:42,123
Cristina,
in the end,

777
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:44,559
I just took off
my uniform and ran.

778
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,098
And look
what happened to you.

779
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:05,380
Sister Cristina,
I am deeply shocked.

780
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:09,617
You filled in
the Africa application.

781
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:12,487
My preference is
for the Valley Mission
in Sierra Leone.

782
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:14,322
But what about
your work here

783
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:15,590
at the Soho Mission?

784
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:18,560
Africa was always
part of my life plan.

785
01:08:18,562 --> 01:08:20,762
Yes, in two years.

786
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:23,264
I want permission
to move it forward.

787
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:26,568
<i>But why?</i>

788
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:29,404
I am finding there are
too many distractions
here in London.

789
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:33,208
You're blushing.

790
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:35,110
It's very warm
in here.

791
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:36,611
It's even warmer
in Sierra Leone.

792
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,446
Hot, even.

793
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:41,182
I will wear a hat.

794
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,158
You have applied
to leave in this quarter.

795
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,294
I am ready to leave any time
after October the first.

796
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,834
<i>( car siren passes )</i>

797
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:08,443
Joey, they said you wanted
to speak to the boss.

798
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,348
Come with me.

799
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:15,717
( speaking Chinese )

800
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:22,757
Sit.

801
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:30,431
Madame, you know
everything that happens

802
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:31,833
in your back garden.

803
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:33,635
( speaking Chinese )

804
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:36,671
If a man pays for girls
and he's violent,

805
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,640
he soon becomes famous.

806
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:43,711
( speaking Chinese )

807
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:49,551
We refuse to deal
with them.

808
01:09:49,553 --> 01:09:51,920
<i>The Russians will</i>
<i>just charge double.</i>

809
01:09:51,922 --> 01:09:54,722
I understand you have
a blacklist of violent men.

810
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:00,528
Joey:
<i>I'm looking</i>
<i>for a very violent man</i>

811
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,730
who attacks girls.

812
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:07,669
He's young.
Around 30.

813
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:11,439
And he has a scar
above his eye.

814
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:18,279
He wears
very expensive suits.

815
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:19,681
We know him.

816
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:22,884
The description
is not too vague for you?

817
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:24,419
We have a business
to protect.

818
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:26,487
Madame,
would you be able to

819
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:27,522
find out the name
of this man?

820
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:41,302
Hmm.

821

They didn't
tell you.

No, no, stop!

833

tell you.

Some of them
are kids.

842
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:25,786
And some of them
are girls.
You want one?

843
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:31,926
I also asked
for information.

844
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:34,161
It's coming, okay?

845
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:37,765
( speaking Chinese )

846
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:00,848
It's the latest.
Do you know how to work it?

847
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:02,183
Yes, of course.

848
01:17:02,185 --> 01:17:06,153
You could afford to get
a professional to do this.

849
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:08,322
Yeah, but I wanted you.

850
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:15,997
So who are
the photographs for?

851
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:18,232
My daughter.

852
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:20,101
You have a daughter?

01:17:20,103 --> 01:17:21,702
Nine years old.

854
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:26,307
I came here with her once
when she was small.

855
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:28,409
<i>She might remember.</i>

856
01:17:28,411 --> 01:17:29,644
I want her to have
some photographs of me

857
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:31,145

a normal man.

858
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,883
What do you think?

859
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:39,120
Like this?

861
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:41,822
Smile.

862
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:45,326
Why?

863
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:47,662
Okay, actually,
you look okay.

864
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,265
Do I look like
a good man?

865
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:54,335
What do you mean?

866
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:58,039
I want her to think

You won't see her?

874
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:20,094
I don't think I'll look
like this for much longer.

875
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:26,767
Why not?

876
01:18:26,769 --> 01:18:28,736
Why shouldn't you
stay like this?

877
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:30,738
Just take a picture.

878
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:36,243
<i>( dog whining )</i>

879
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:39,313
You should have
one like this.

880
01:18:39,315 --> 01:18:41,082
More natural.

881
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:43,751
The businessman drinking
his morning coffee.

882
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:45,119
Such a successful man.

883
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:46,420
So rich.

884
01:18:46,422 --> 01:18:48,756
- Charitable.
- <i>Of course.</i>

885
01:18:48,758 --> 01:18:51,058
She will be
very proud of you.

886
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,193
Enough.

887
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,197
I said enough.

888
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:00,901
At last a laugh.

889
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:06,907
There.
I am changing you.

890
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,148
Send those ones to me.

891
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,950
I'll take them with me
to Africa.

892
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,458
You're going to Africa?

893
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:27,294
A valley in Sierra Leone
where there is no water.

894
01:19:27,296 --> 01:19:30,064
When do you leave?

895
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:31,932
Tomorrow.

896
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,442
So this is the end
of my crazy patch, Joey.

897
01:19:44,045 --> 01:19:46,914
And I've decided
I want to end it with you.

898
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:22,817

Joey:
<i>Cristina!</i>

911
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:19,039
Who the bloody
hell are you?

912
01:21:22,011 --> 01:21:25,880
I don't know who you are,
but open this door.

917
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:49,503
Cristina.

918
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:52,940
There's enough money in here
to get us away.

919
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:54,074
We could go anywhere
in the world.

920
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:55,009
No, Joey...

921
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,014
if you want to be
a good man,

922
01:22:00,016 --> 01:22:02,116
be a good man.

923
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:12,993
Joey, will you come with me
to the ballet tonight?

924
01:22:12,995 --> 01:22:16,397
I have a box.
There is room for two.

925
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:18,232
Tonight at 7:00.

926
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:36,250
Cristina:
<i>My time here</i>

927
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:38,285

929
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:43,991
Our mission has had
some failures.

Some tragedies...

931
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:49,496
the poor girl Isabel.

932
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:51,565
But we have also
had successes.

933
01:22:51,567 --> 01:22:54,301
And we have also
had some who,

934

Who are you?

938
01:23:18,728 --> 01:23:21,528
I've got something
for your mother.

939
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:28,469
And something
for you.

940
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:41,281
Can I just hold your hand
for a minute?

941
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:55,496

942

Max Forrester?

952

Yes.
Who are you?

953
01:26:56,612 --> 01:26:58,912
How was your bonus
this year? Was it good?

954
01:26:58,914 --> 01:27:01,648
It was very good.

955
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:03,417
Are you from Cisco
or American Eagle?

956
01:27:03,419 --> 01:27:05,919
No. I'm from down there.

957
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:10,357
Listen, can I talk to you
for a minute?

958
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:12,759
I was actually
just getting some drinks.

959
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:14,394
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

960
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:16,530
Let me think...

961
01:27:16,532 --> 01:27:18,298
- <i>( glass shatters )</i>
<i>- Oof!</i>

962

What the--
what the hell do you want?

964
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:26,740
I think you should know
how it feels to be down there.

965
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:28,442
What?
( whimpers )

966
01:27:28,444 --> 01:27:32,679

I'm waiting
for Maria Zielinska.

979
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:42,843
There was a party
after the show.

980

I want to see her
walk to her car.

981
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,833
Let me explain.

982
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,908
When I'm sober...

983
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:19,679
when I'm healthy
and well...

984
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:25,519
I hurt people.

985
01:30:27,655 --> 01:30:29,623
<i>I'm lethal.</i>

986
01:30:31,659 --> 01:30:34,194
I drink to weaken
the machine they made.

987
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:40,734
I've finished the work
I had to do.

988
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:57,517
And already, look.

989
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:01,922
You see 'em?

Hummingbirds.

five of theirs.

<i>The first five</i>
<i>I could find.</i>

1006

She is my witness.
