1
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,580
Let's be clear
about this.

2
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,384
<I>Humans were offered
a chance to assimilate

3
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:38,218
<I>but they refused.

4
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,454
<I>Therefore, they are enemies
of the state and will be

5
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:42,976
<I>captured and farmed for
blood supply.

6
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:49,100
<I>It's a disgrace that we
have reduced human

7
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:51,141
<I>beings to mere vessels
for blood supply.

8
00:03:51,142 --> 00:03:53,497
<I>We should be focusing on
finding a blood substitute...

9
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:57,668
<I>We always come back to
the magic potion solution.

10
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:58,948
<I>Where is it?

11
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,118
<I>With little or no population
remaining to sustain industry

12
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:24,686
<I>other Third World countries
throughout Asia have also...

13
00:05:38,144 --> 00:05:40,266
"Serving 20% blood"

14
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:03,385
CHIEF HEMATOLOGIST
EDWARD DALTON - APPROVED

15
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:14,396
All the material in this
meeting is classified

16
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:15,697
Commissioner?

17
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:20,700
Death row inmate 4705-B
was a vampire selected

18
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:22,840
for a month long study
on the effects of

19
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:24,157
blood deprivation.

20
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:25,354
What?

21
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:28,220
A complete lack of human
blood over this period

22
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:30,442
resulted in a massive
deterioration of the

23
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,017
frontal lobe.

24
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:35,059
First signs of physical
deformities began with

25
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,778
elongated ears. Mental
functions such as logic,

26
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,882
emotion, most parts of
speech then terminated

27
00:08:41,883 --> 00:08:43,875
much faster than you or
your team originally

28
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:45,695
speculated, Dr. Dalton.

29
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:48,805
Out on the streets these
creatures, these subsides,

30
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:51,064
are becoming a real problem.

31
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:52,781
Gentlemen, we are starving.

32
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,032
Our latest statistics show
that less than 5% of the

33
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,642
human population remains.

34
00:08:57,643 --> 00:09:00,408
What we're talking
about is the extinction

35
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:01,658
of the human race.

36
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:04,395
What we're talking about
is only having enough blood

37
00:09:04,396 --> 00:09:07,383
to sustain our population
until the end of the month.

38
00:09:07,385 --> 00:09:10,243
If a blood substitute
is not found immediately

39
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:13,387
this will happen to all of us.

40
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:17,184
Edward?

41
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:29,223
Enjoy your coffee, Sir.

42
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,136
Did I ever tell you about
my daughter Alison?

43
00:09:36,137 --> 00:09:40,210
In early 2008 I was
diagnosed with Sarcoma.

44
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:42,597
The shock of finding out
I had cancer was one thing,

45
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:45,054
but having to tell
my daughter...

46
00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:47,430
She was devastated.

47
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:52,737
I prayed for a miracle,
but was realistic.

48
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:56,326
And then the
world changed.

49
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,894
My prayers were answered.

50
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:02,257
Immortality gave
me my cure.

51
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:06,631
My daughter and I now
had all the time in the world.

52
00:10:06,632 --> 00:10:12,028
But she saw this
evolution as a disease,

53
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,112
worse than any cancer.

54
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,747
She refused to turn.

55
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:20,506
I was a monster to her.

56
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:27,557
She ran, like so many did.

57
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:30,267
No, we are blessed, Edward.

58
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:32,227
Blessed.

59
00:10:32,228 --> 00:10:34,123
And you have to stare
death in the face

60
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:36,511
to truly know that.

61
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:40,159
We are not ready
yet, Mr. Bromley.

62
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:46,260
Not a coffee drinker?

63
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:48,824
Not really.

64
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:55,079
You pity the humans,
don't you?

65
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:58,594
Well, me too.

66
00:10:58,595 --> 00:11:00,195
Me too.

67
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:05,291
These are desperate
times, Edward.

68
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:09,876
We must start testing
the blood substitute.

69
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:16,259
It is the only way to
help the human race.

70
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:20,253
He wants us to move
ahead again, doesn't he?

71
00:11:20,254 --> 00:11:21,254
Yeah.

72
00:11:23,158 --> 00:11:24,158
Okay.

73
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:29,760
Is there any change?

74
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:34,082
Hembicillin CBC and a
biochemical panel.

75
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,319
All stable.

76
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:39,757
The substitute is working.

77
00:11:40,997 --> 00:11:44,062
It's time to move
beyond animal testing.

78
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:47,034
You know the Vernon
Park Cemetery was

79
00:11:47,036 --> 00:11:50,345
raided by a bunch
of kids last night.

80
00:11:50,786 --> 00:11:52,545
They dug up a dozen
graves thinking

81
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,405
they'd find some
human blood.

82
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:59,042
It's nuts out there.

83
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:16,088
Now private, you may
feel a slight increase

84
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:18,400
in body temperature.
That's just the Hembicillin

85
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:20,733
entering your system,
it's to be expected.

86
00:12:20,734 --> 00:12:21,534
Yes, Sir.

87
00:12:31,514 --> 00:12:34,874
- How do you feel?
- No change, Sir.

88
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:53,478
6 degree increase.

89
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:56,702
Slightly more accelerated
than anticipated but...

90
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:58,104
you're fine.

91
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:13,544
68 degrees and holding.

92
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,294
Okay.

93
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,233
- Okay, how do you feel?
- I feel fine, Si...

94
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:25,805
Shit!

95
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,849
20 cc of Epimone!
Come on!

96
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:34,642
<I>Violent scenes in London
today, as police clashed

97
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:36,386
<I>with protesters over
the controversial

98
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:38,058
<I> new blood rationing schemes.

99
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:40,002
<I>Demonstrators argue
that the blood allowances

100
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:41,972
<I>are too strict and that
government bodies are

101
00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:44,077
<I>failing in their promise
to find alternatives.

102
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:45,976
<I>Similar scenes have been
occurring across Asia

103
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:48,111
<I>and the Middle East
in recent times.

104
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,994
<I>In local news, blood related
crime is on the rise

105
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:53,840
<I>with a staggering
1 in 10 people being

106
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:58,071
<I>confronted by subside
activity in the last month.

107
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,306
Oh, shit!

108
00:15:19,645 --> 00:15:20,982
Fuck.

109
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:33,483
You alright?

110
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:37,247
- What are you doing?
- Get back!

111
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:39,567
- Don't come any closer!
- Shoot him again!

112
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:40,968
Don't!

113
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:45,703
- You're human.
- Shoot!

114
00:15:45,704 --> 00:15:47,104
Don't shoot me again!

115
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:56,547
Listen, I can help you.
Come on! Get in my car.

116
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:58,866
I'll help you! Come on!
Let me help you!

117
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:00,168
Get in my car!

118
00:16:01,557 --> 00:16:03,644
Come on. Come on!

119
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:08,881
Come on, get in.

120
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:12,142
It's alright.

121
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,473
"Daytime Driving Mode

Shit.

125
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:52,661
- You okay, Sir?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

126
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:54,777
Did you get a good
look at them, Sir?

127
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:58,895
No, not really.
It happened so fast.

128
00:16:58,896 --> 00:17:01,214
They didn't wait around
to see how I was.

129
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:02,712
We believe they
may be humans, Sir.

130
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:04,630
Did you see where
they went?

131
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:09,850
I think they went that way.

132
00:17:13,729 --> 00:17:15,718
You take care, Sir.

133
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,005
Thank you.

134
00:17:32,006 --> 00:17:34,347
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

135
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:37,818
See you around.

136
00:17:38,536 --> 00:17:40,340
Somehow I doubt that.

137
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:42,546
Happy birthday, Ed.

Hey, Ed.

155
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:02,531
I hardly recognized you.

156
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:04,241
It's only been a few months.

157
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:06,866
I got something for you.

158
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:08,605
What's this?

159
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:10,215
What the fuck do
you think it is?

160
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,235
Some birthday party, bro.

161
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:17,987
Yeah. Well, I've turned
thirty-five ten times.

162
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,249
Birthdays are pointless.

163
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,766
Bullshit!

164
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:23,130
Let's have a drink.

165
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,693
It smells human.

166
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:32,067
100% pure.

167
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,665
That's one of the perks
of serving your country.

168
00:19:36,706 --> 00:19:38,469
I hear even that
pig shit you drink

169
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,520
is getting hard to find.

170
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,519
I can't.

171
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:47,138
Fuck that.

172
00:19:47,178 --> 00:19:48,618
You need it.

173
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:50,033
Yeah, well...

174
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,896
Life is a bitch and...

175
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:53,922
then you don't die.

176
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:56,117
Come on.

177
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:59,258
I don't touch human blood.

178
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:02,818
You don't touch human blood.

179
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:06,098
You work for a company that
uses humans like fucking' cattle.

180
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:07,897
Don't tell me how to live
my life, little brother.

181
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:10,334
Then don't act all high
and mighty, big brother.

182
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:12,545
Look Ed, your company
working on some type of

183
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:15,035
fake blood, that's one thing,
but we all know that

184
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:16,713
their money comes from
farming humans.

185
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:19,573
Are we going to pick up from
exactly where we left off?

186
00:20:19,574 --> 00:20:22,970
I don't hunt humans.
That is your job.

187
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,631
I find them. You farm them.

188
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,663
All right. Well...

189
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:29,506
- Let's just dump this shit.
- Nothing changes, does it?

190
00:20:29,507 --> 00:20:30,721
Does it?

191
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:32,982
You still don't get
why I joined.

192
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:35,132
What happens...

193
00:20:35,754 --> 00:20:39,115
when there isn't
a single drop left?

194
00:20:39,116 --> 00:20:41,100
When there isn't
a single human?

195
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:43,560
-A single anything?
-We will always find more.

196
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:46,632
A blood substitute means
the end of human hunting.

197
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:49,212
Fake blood. Doesn't
mean the end of shit.

198
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:51,686
Well, if I believed that,
let me drive a stake

199
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:53,587
through my heart
right now.

200
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:06,144
Shit!

201
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:28,117
Frankie. Frankie.

202
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:38,306
Shit!

203
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:40,079
Oh, my God!

204
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:55,727
Frankie.

205
00:22:06,774 --> 00:22:08,090
Frankie.

206
00:22:12,035 --> 00:22:13,351
Frankie.

207
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:10,707
This is the third home invasion
in this area in the last month.

208
00:23:10,832 --> 00:23:13,062
These things are
in the suburbs now.

209
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,406
So...

210
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:16,176
it's important that you
update your security.

211
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:24,078
Subsides. Strong bastards.

212
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,997
The same common traits
as all the others.

213
00:23:26,017 --> 00:23:27,727
The aggression is most
likely brought on by

214
00:23:27,755 --> 00:23:29,660
massive reductions
in Serotonin levels.

215
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,477
We need more patrols
aching these filthy rats.

216
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,055
Ugly son of a bitch.

217
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:43,805
"Together Forever.
Lillian and Carl".

218
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:46,776
Carl?

219
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,390
What? You knew him?

220
00:23:51,272 --> 00:23:54,288
Yeah, he was the
local gardener.

221
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:56,438
I saw him two weeks ago.

222
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,799
He's feeding off
other vamps.

223
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:01,060
Only takes a couple of weeks
to get this messed up.

224
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:03,783
Some of these wounds
look self inflected.

225
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,111
He fed on himself?

226
00:24:06,322 --> 00:24:07,685
Perhaps.

227
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:10,211
And that would speed up
mutation considerably.

228
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,560
Animals.

229
00:24:24,225 --> 00:24:27,498
<I>Security alert: Backdoor ajar.

230
00:25:03,464 --> 00:25:04,784
Hi.

231
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,377
Did you come
to finish me off?

232
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:13,902
We need your help.

233
00:25:14,448 --> 00:25:17,610
We've been searching for
vampires we can trust.

234
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:20,074
Trust?

235
00:25:27,106 --> 00:25:30,179
You're a blood doctor.
You can help us.

236
00:25:30,984 --> 00:25:32,380
Help you how?

237
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:36,151
A blood substitute is a
solution but not a cure.

238
00:25:36,152 --> 00:25:37,492
There's another way.

239
00:25:40,531 --> 00:25:41,635
Take it.

240
00:26:01,676 --> 00:26:04,136
"GORDON CREEK. NOON
WEDNESDAY. ALONE."

241
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:26,791
Who was that?

242
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,591
It's nothing.

243
00:26:37,172 --> 00:26:39,639
<I>With blood supplies
continuing to dwindle

244
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,843
<I>private investors are pulling
their human stock from the

245
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:44,074
<I>Bromley Marks harvesting facility.

246
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,527
<I>Many experts believe that
the company will no longer

247
00:26:46,528 --> 00:26:48,645
<I>be able to handle the
national blood demand.

248
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:51,011
<I>The FDA spokesperson
confirmed yesterday...

249
00:26:54,002 --> 00:26:55,943
How are you feeling, Edward?

250
00:26:56,204 --> 00:26:59,473
The break-in must have
been very traumatic.

251
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:01,668
I'm fine. Thank you.

252
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,128
Now, these attacks on
everyday citizens are

253
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:09,467
cause for great concern.

254
00:27:10,975 --> 00:27:14,108
All the more reason to push
forward, wouldn't you say?

255
00:27:15,057 --> 00:27:17,110
I'd just like your guarantee

256
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:22,045
that a substitute would replace
our need for a human supply, Sir.

257
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:25,801
Well, it's important
that we allow

258
00:27:25,803 --> 00:27:28,462
the human race
time to repopulate.

259
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,143
That's not exactly
what I asked.

260
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:35,125
The majority of the
population will be

261
00:27:35,126 --> 00:27:38,009
content with a blood
substitute, yes.

262
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,390
But there will always be
those who are willing to pay

263
00:27:40,545 --> 00:27:43,106
a little extra for the real thing.

264
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,486
Come on, Edward.
We have to be realistic.

265
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:53,270
If we don't cater
to all markets,

266
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,971
someone else will.

267
00:27:55,978 --> 00:27:57,364
How much do you
think they'd be

268
00:27:57,365 --> 00:27:59,578
willing to pay for
your daughter?

269
00:29:19,183 --> 00:29:21,003
He's waiting for you.

270
00:29:52,050 --> 00:30:08,535
<I>UV Warning.

271
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:33,803
Trees are the oldest
living things on earth.

272
00:30:35,582 --> 00:30:37,082
Did you know that?

273
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,038
They say, some are over
four thousand years old.

274
00:30:45,338 --> 00:30:47,028
Someday, though...

275
00:30:47,285 --> 00:30:48,957
this tree will die.

276
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,951
And so will you.

277
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:56,545
Maybe you won't die
of old age like her.

278
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:00,497
But the thing
you're holding on to,

279
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:03,678
that last breath
of humanity,

280
00:31:04,428 --> 00:31:07,168
will vanish as soon as
the blood does.

281
00:31:08,895 --> 00:31:10,503
What do you want?

282
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:12,447
Same thing you do.

283
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:14,759
A future.

284
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:32,247
I was like you once.

285
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,637
But not no more.

286
00:31:39,786 --> 00:31:41,599
Lionel Cormack.

287
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:44,101
My friends call me Elvis.

288
00:31:47,829 --> 00:31:50,370
I isn’t going to bite.

289
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:59,569
- Elvis?
- Yeah, you know like...

290
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:03,557
<I>Lord almighty, I feel
my temperature rising.

291
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:09,791
<I>Higher higher. It's burning
through to my soul.

292
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:16,246
Feel that?

293
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:19,392
Hadn't been beating
for nine years.

294
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,975
Seems impossible,
don't it?

295
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:25,610
It is impossible.

296
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,320
So is walking around
without a pulse.

297
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:31,281
But here you are.

298
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,128
How did you do it?

299
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:38,565
Audrey?

300
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:51,989
- Put the gun down.
- Frankie?

301
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:54,498
- Put the gun down!
- Frankie, what the...

302
00:32:54,499 --> 00:32:55,512
What the hell
are you doing?

303
00:32:55,513 --> 00:32:57,119
- Move away from him.
- Put the gun down!

304
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,338
Don't make things worse.

305
00:32:58,339 --> 00:32:59,482
- Stop pointing the gun!
- Move away from them!

306
00:32:59,483 --> 00:33:00,949
- Frankie!
- This is serious shit, Ed.

307
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,113
They can put you away
for a long time.

308
00:33:11,942 --> 00:33:13,083
Let's go.

309
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,006
Motherfuckers!

310
00:33:25,182 --> 00:33:26,921
Come on, get
in my car!

311
00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:49,590
Shit!

312
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:56,501
<I>UV warning.

313
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,130
Got it!

314
00:34:09,104 --> 00:34:11,029
"SIGNAL LOST"
- I can't...!

315
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,030
Move!

316
00:34:58,508 --> 00:35:00,520
Hang on.

317
00:35:23,594 --> 00:35:25,709
Everybody okay?

318
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,410
Yeah.

319
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:51,706
Motherfuckers.

320
00:35:52,573 --> 00:35:55,021
I loved that car.

321
00:36:40,438 --> 00:36:42,721
You did the right thing.

322
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:45,247
That was my brother.

323
00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:54,138
Come on.

324
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,857
Never been good
at science, Doc.

325
00:37:10,858 --> 00:37:13,275
Cars have always
been my thing.

326
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:17,104
Daylight modifications
are my specialty.

327
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:19,323
Or used to be.

328
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:23,417
Custom cameras, sun
shields, that kind of thing.

329
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:30,133
My garage was one of the
first in town to start doing them.

330
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:33,015
I had a shop right
near your place.

331
00:37:33,855 --> 00:37:37,595
Day time driving' man,
nothing' beats it.

332
00:37:37,596 --> 00:37:42,596
No traffic, no cops.
But if you isn’t careful

333
00:37:42,597 --> 00:37:47,225
you can get yourself
one hell of a sunburn.

334
00:37:57,565 --> 00:38:00,061
You can only go on
so long without blood

335
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:02,267
before it messes
with your head.

336
00:38:22,056 --> 00:38:25,932
It's amazing how quickly
your whole world can change.

337
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:27,833
Isn’t it, Doc?

338
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,089
We need to recreate
this. Safely.

339
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,690
That's why we
need you.

340
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:52,897
The Sun?

341
00:38:54,706 --> 00:38:57,788
You're human because
of the Sun?

342
00:38:58,095 --> 00:39:00,463
Hurt like hell.

343
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:19,325
Please, have a seat.

344
00:39:22,503 --> 00:39:24,856
Do you know who I am?

345
00:39:24,857 --> 00:39:27,630
My brother's mentioned
you before, Sir.

346
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:34,011
You did the right thing
reporting his actions.

347
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,735
You want to continue
to do the right thing,

348
00:39:36,736 --> 00:39:38,401
don't you son?

349
00:39:38,403 --> 00:39:41,429
I will do whatever
is asked of me, Sir.

350
00:39:43,226 --> 00:39:46,869
Edward is a valuable
member of our team,

351
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:50,600
and an essential part
of all our futures.

352
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:54,161
All we wish, is for him to
continue with his work.

353
00:39:54,162 --> 00:39:59,298
If he returns immediately,
no formal charges will be laid.

354
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:02,218
I don't know what you
think I can do, Sir.

355
00:40:05,515 --> 00:40:08,182
Do you like being
a vampire, son?

356
00:40:09,037 --> 00:40:10,037
Yes, Sir.

357
00:40:10,665 --> 00:40:12,065
Why?

358
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:17,076
I mean, your brother
clearly disapproves.

359
00:40:17,077 --> 00:40:20,727
I wonder if it's a common
trait in your family.

360
00:40:22,065 --> 00:40:24,365
I'm good at this.

361
00:40:24,367 --> 00:40:28,148
I was never very good
at being human, Sir.

362
00:40:28,382 --> 00:40:31,078
And I'm not
my brother.

363
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:33,291
Well...

364
00:40:34,758 --> 00:40:39,854
Good. Frankie.

365
00:40:42,636 --> 00:40:44,739
Every couple of
weeks we head out,

366
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,294
to search for others.

367
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,023
It's getting harder and
harder to find anybody.

368
00:40:51,024 --> 00:40:53,206
I only managed to
pick up three,

369
00:40:53,207 --> 00:40:56,452
when you drove us
off the road.

370
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,219
Stop the car!

371
00:41:04,104 --> 00:41:07,027
When was the last time
you drank human blood?

372
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:08,861
What's the matter?

373
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:14,075
I'm fine.

374
00:41:16,402 --> 00:41:20,130
Oh. You... don't...

375
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,377
We need you focused.

376
00:41:26,378 --> 00:41:30,486
- No! No, I'm not...
- She isn’t asking, Doc.

377
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,426
Where we're going...

378
00:41:39,427 --> 00:41:41,972
I can't afford to
worry about you,

379
00:41:41,973 --> 00:41:43,969
around the others.

380
00:42:30,372 --> 00:42:32,509
Well it's about
god damn time.

381
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,015
Stop worrying,
you'll live longer.

382
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:42,409
Travis, this is Ed.

383
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:43,344
Ed!

384
00:42:45,844 --> 00:42:47,778
Well isn’t this nothing.

385
00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:49,657
Usually when there's
a vampire around,

386
00:42:49,658 --> 00:42:52,778
I'm the one
shitting my pants.

387
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,977
You better be worth
the risk, man.

388
00:42:54,978 --> 00:42:56,623
Jar's made contact
with the largest

389
00:42:56,624 --> 00:43:00,009
human group we've
found in a long time.

390
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,177
And he's going to
bring them back here.

391
00:43:02,924 --> 00:43:04,981
I set up more cots
in the cellar.

392
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:08,493
We'll stay in radio contact
and keep you updated.

393
00:43:08,494 --> 00:43:10,096
Good luck.

394
00:43:12,062 --> 00:43:14,055
You too.

395
00:43:31,407 --> 00:43:33,640
Is this place safe?

396
00:43:33,641 --> 00:43:35,528
Being human in a
world full of vampires

397
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:39,092
is about as safe as
bare backing a 5$ whore.

398
00:43:40,165 --> 00:43:44,803
This is home, Doc.
But none of us are safe.

399
00:43:48,163 --> 00:43:50,262
This vineyard belonged
to my parents.

400
00:43:50,264 --> 00:43:51,952
They always wanted me
to run it someday, but,

401
00:43:51,953 --> 00:43:55,164
at the time I was more
interested in college.

402
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:59,775
Not long after the
outbreak I came back.

403
00:43:59,776 --> 00:44:02,682
It seemed like a
good place to hide.

404
00:44:09,126 --> 00:44:11,237
I owe that girl my life.

405
00:44:11,238 --> 00:44:13,034
She found me after I
was shacked-n-baked

406
00:44:13,036 --> 00:44:14,636
and brought me here.

407
00:44:17,997 --> 00:44:20,070
I want you to
meet someone.

408
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:25,706
Ed, this is senator
Wes Turner.

409
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:29,091
- Hey. You made it.
- Yeah. Barely.

410
00:44:29,092 --> 00:44:32,435
- More damn vampires.
- Back off, Colin.

411
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:33,436
They're trying to help.

412
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,470
Hey. Being a vampire
and a politician,

413
00:44:36,472 --> 00:44:38,692
it can be hard to
make friends.

414
00:44:39,315 --> 00:44:42,656
Wes knows enough vampires
in office that want this cure.

415
00:44:42,657 --> 00:44:46,228
And more importantly, will
use it for the right reasons.

416
00:44:46,229 --> 00:44:48,697
We want to rebuild
the human race.

417
00:44:48,698 --> 00:44:50,847
But a way back can be
a dangerous thing,

418
00:44:50,848 --> 00:44:52,071
in the wrong hands.

419
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:54,833
We're an endangered
species, Doc.

420
00:44:54,834 --> 00:44:56,689
It's time we changed
all that.

421
00:45:22,908 --> 00:45:24,952
<I>The escalating global
blood crisis has seen

422
00:45:24,953 --> 00:45:27,884
<I>prices skyrocket over
the past week.

423
00:45:30,055 --> 00:45:31,540
<I>Experts believe that
this will make blood

424
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:33,856
<I>unobtainable to many citizens
across the country,

425
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:35,809
<I>and create what could
only be described

426
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,415
<I> as a subside epidemic.

427
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:45,789
Excuse me.

428
00:45:47,802 --> 00:45:49,743
This is not what
I asked for.

429
00:45:49,744 --> 00:45:52,676
Read the sign, Sir. We're
now only permitted to

430
00:45:52,677 --> 00:45:54,729
serve 5% blood
with every coffee.

431
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:58,192
I don't care what
the signs says.

432
00:46:00,493 --> 00:46:03,803
Just put some more fucking
blood in my coffee.

433
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:05,104
I can't.

434
00:46:25,302 --> 00:46:26,470
Move!

435
00:46:49,865 --> 00:46:52,486
We've tested burning
extracted blood under UV light

436
00:46:52,631 --> 00:46:54,526
It always remains infected.

437
00:46:55,282 --> 00:46:57,501
How could yours
possibly be human?

438
00:46:57,509 --> 00:46:58,938
You tell me, Doc.

439
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:02,784
What did it feel like when
the sun hit your body?

440
00:47:03,046 --> 00:47:05,311
What do you mean
what did it feel like?

441
00:47:05,317 --> 00:47:08,687
I felt like a god-damned
piece of fried chicken.

442
00:47:08,956 --> 00:47:10,598
Can you remember anything
specific about it?

443
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:12,086
Anything at all.

444
00:47:12,087 --> 00:47:15,806
Well I remember when
the sunlight hit me.

445
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:18,775
It was like a bolt
of lightning

446
00:47:18,776 --> 00:47:20,557
kick-started my heart.

447
00:47:22,084 --> 00:47:23,559
It was like...

448
00:47:23,597 --> 00:47:26,337
someone let the
air back in the room.

449
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,349
Maybe the only way
to treat the blood

450
00:47:33,354 --> 00:47:35,405
is inside the body.

451
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:38,786
We need to control
a daylight burn.

452
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,749
- Pickup was successful.
- That's great Jarvis!

453
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,330
Total count is 15.

454
00:47:50,516 --> 00:47:51,691
We'll stay clear of
the interstates,

455
00:47:51,692 --> 00:47:53,434
so it might take us
a while to get back.

456
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:54,935
Be safe.

457
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:00,062
You okay?

458
00:48:02,532 --> 00:48:04,494
They may be frightened
of you, but...

459
00:48:04,512 --> 00:48:06,678
none of them doubt
that you can help us.

460
00:48:07,681 --> 00:48:10,586
I can't even remember
what it's like to be human.

461
00:48:13,111 --> 00:48:14,964
Are you afraid to die?

462
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,892
Yeah.

463
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:20,545
Most of us are too
scared of death to

464
00:48:20,546 --> 00:48:22,344
think of it as
an option.

465
00:48:22,345 --> 00:48:24,831
I guess that's why
so many turned.

466
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:29,061
How did it
happen to you?

467
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:32,172
I was betrayed.

468
00:48:34,305 --> 00:48:35,895
My brother...

469
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:47,191
What are these?

470
00:48:47,787 --> 00:48:49,593
Wine fermentation tanks.

471
00:48:49,911 --> 00:48:51,372
Fermentation.

472
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:54,217
- That's airtight, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

473
00:49:00,428 --> 00:49:03,733
- What's that?
- It's an extraction fan.

474
00:49:03,734 --> 00:49:06,889
Pulls air out of the tank to
stop the wine from oxidizing.

475
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:09,936
Okay, perfect. We use that
to put out the fire.

476
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:33,775
How far is it to the
winery, Jarvis?

477
00:49:33,777 --> 00:49:35,617
It's about two
hours from here.

478
00:49:35,986 --> 00:49:37,940
So, have you been
doing this for long?

479
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:40,153
Picking up humans,
giving them a home.

480
00:49:40,161 --> 00:49:41,852
Since the beginning.

481
00:49:42,407 --> 00:49:44,321
There's not many
of us left now.

482
00:49:44,873 --> 00:49:46,232
How long have you
been running?

483
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,708
Most of us have been on
the run together for years.

484
00:49:50,899 --> 00:49:52,355
I've never seen
it this bad.

485
00:49:52,546 --> 00:49:54,854
What made you come
all the way out here?

486
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,553
It's safer.

487
00:49:57,271 --> 00:50:00,612
There's lots of sun,
there's not a lot of shade.

488
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:03,060
Not much food
either, hmm?

489
00:50:03,878 --> 00:50:06,458
Yeah. Thanks.

490
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:11,488
Oh shit!

491
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:20,695
Dammed!

492
00:50:46,214 --> 00:50:47,540
Shit!

493
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,181
Tranq dart!
Move! Move!

494
00:51:17,088 --> 00:51:18,439
Oh shit!

495
00:51:20,633 --> 00:51:22,297
Move. Move!

496
00:51:22,906 --> 00:51:24,353
Go go go!

497
00:51:27,574 --> 00:51:28,898
Keep firing.

498
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:32,608
Fire!

499
00:51:34,566 --> 00:51:35,876
Fire!

500
00:51:57,466 --> 00:51:58,859
Can anyone hear me?

501
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,395
Hello? Is anyone there?

502
00:52:02,739 --> 00:52:04,539
We hear you,
who is this?

503
00:52:04,564 --> 00:52:06,904
They found us.
They're everywhere.

504
00:52:06,907 --> 00:52:08,281
Where are you?

505
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,292
Got another.

506
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:19,991
Are you still there?

507
00:52:31,444 --> 00:52:32,892
It's completely secluded.

508
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:34,860
It should be the safest
place for us to regroup.

509
00:52:34,879 --> 00:52:36,160
How long will it
take to get there?

510
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:37,584
If we stay off the main
highways and follow

511
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:39,139
the trails along the
Marshall River

512
00:52:39,173 --> 00:52:41,076
we should reach my
cabin before nightfall.

513
00:52:41,097 --> 00:52:42,406
Okay.

514
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,893
- You be careful.
- You too.

515
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:50,712
Come on, Ed.
We got to go.

516
00:52:50,884 --> 00:52:53,811
- I can't.
- They'll be here soon.

517
00:52:53,812 --> 00:52:56,475
The sun is about to come up,
we may never get a chance to

518
00:52:56,476 --> 00:52:58,784
set up this experiment
again, I've got to do it.

519
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:01,740
- That thing could kill you.
- I'm already dead.

520
00:53:05,522 --> 00:53:06,846
Fuck it.

521
00:53:08,278 --> 00:53:10,469
I do love a good BBQ.

522
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,367
You don't need that.

523
00:53:47,186 --> 00:53:49,026
You're safe here,
I promise.

524
00:53:49,579 --> 00:53:51,199
Where are my friends?

525
00:53:53,074 --> 00:53:55,668
Don't hurt them.
Please!

526
00:53:57,884 --> 00:54:00,130
You look so beautiful.

527
00:54:00,525 --> 00:54:02,745
You've grown
up so much.

528
00:54:07,401 --> 00:54:08,901
Dad, please.

529
00:54:10,429 --> 00:54:12,417
I'm so happy to see you.

530
00:54:12,823 --> 00:54:15,244
I never thought I'd see
you again, sweetheart.

531
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:18,320
You're safe now.

532
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,158
You're safe.

533
00:54:21,344 --> 00:54:23,211
But your friends...

534
00:54:23,417 --> 00:54:25,852
There's nothing I
can do, I'm sorry.

535
00:54:27,624 --> 00:54:29,439
You're not sorry.

536
00:54:31,581 --> 00:54:33,894
Ally, let me help
you, please!

537
00:54:53,893 --> 00:54:56,017
Are you sure you're
ready to do this?

538
00:54:56,829 --> 00:54:59,630
Yeah. What could
go wrong?

539
00:55:11,322 --> 00:55:13,446
You feel so warm.

540
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,268
Ready, Doc?

541
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:58,203
- Ready.
- Let's do it, Aud.

542
00:55:58,729 --> 00:56:00,650
Okay, on my count.

543
00:56:00,712 --> 00:56:05,118
3-2-1-Now!

544
00:56:21,902 --> 00:56:23,214
Ed?

545
00:56:24,373 --> 00:56:25,740
I'm alright.

546
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:27,534
He's okay, Aud.

547
00:56:27,562 --> 00:56:31,062
- Let's do it again.
- Again, let's do it again!

548
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:39,288
3-2-1-Now!

549
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:55,149
You okay?

550
00:56:55,882 --> 00:56:57,208
Ed?

551
00:56:57,252 --> 00:56:59,939
- Yeah. Again.
- He's fine!

552
00:57:07,582 --> 00:57:11,365
3-2-1-Now!

553
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,606
Ed!

554
00:57:50,095 --> 00:57:51,515
Lord almighty.

555
00:58:20,493 --> 00:58:21,909
Mr. Dalton.

556
00:58:22,727 --> 00:58:24,176
How is the shoulder, son?

557
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:27,495
It's healing quickly.
How about yourself, Sir?

558
00:58:27,934 --> 00:58:29,760
Oh, I'll survive.

559
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:33,124
You know...

560
00:58:33,845 --> 00:58:37,797
During the civil war,
General Sherman said:

561
00:58:37,835 --> 00:58:40,202
"I'm tired and sick of war"

562
00:58:40,603 --> 00:58:43,036
"It's glory is all moonshine"

563
00:58:43,188 --> 00:58:45,148
"War is hell."

564
00:58:46,636 --> 00:58:50,532
Less than 50 humans have
been captured the last week.

565
00:58:50,844 --> 00:58:53,932
Some believe hell
may well be coming.

566
00:58:55,045 --> 00:58:57,413
With dedicated soldiers
like yourself,

567
00:58:57,773 --> 00:58:59,965
we can prevent that
from happening.

568
00:59:03,645 --> 00:59:05,202
Frankie...

569
00:59:09,304 --> 00:59:11,916
I need you to do
something for me.

570
00:59:20,121 --> 00:59:21,719
Get away from me!

571
00:59:21,751 --> 00:59:23,816
You don't need to
be scared of me.

572
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:25,597
Stay away!

573
00:59:25,955 --> 00:59:27,362
Is this what you want?

574
00:59:27,846 --> 00:59:29,241
To live in fear?

575
00:59:29,964 --> 00:59:31,398
See, I can help you.

576
00:59:31,718 --> 00:59:33,260
Make you one of us.

577
00:59:33,295 --> 00:59:34,559
- Free.
- No

578
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,699
You can live forever.

579
00:59:36,772 --> 00:59:38,104
Fuck you.

580
01:01:16,014 --> 01:01:17,448
Welcome back.

581
01:01:29,584 --> 01:01:31,724
"FROM THE ASHES SPRINGS NEW LIFE"

582
01:01:59,851 --> 01:02:01,751
She won't drink
her blood ration, Sir.

583
01:02:03,643 --> 01:02:04,956
Okay.

584
01:02:15,888 --> 01:02:17,224
Ally.

585
01:02:20,534 --> 01:02:21,846
Baby.

586
01:02:25,795 --> 01:02:29,245
Oh, Ally. What are you doing?
That'll poison you.

587
01:02:33,371 --> 01:02:35,292
Is this what you wanted?

588
01:02:35,643 --> 01:02:37,889
- Sweetheart, stop that.
- Is this what you wanted?

589
01:02:37,896 --> 01:02:39,203
No.

590
01:02:40,205 --> 01:02:41,517
No.

591
01:02:42,921 --> 01:02:44,490
You did this.

592
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:46,649
- You did this.
- No.

593
01:02:49,134 --> 01:02:51,621
No. You did this.

594
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:15,858
<I>Military forces have been ordered
to most major cities around the country

595
01:03:15,859 --> 01:03:19,678
<I>in a bid to contain what is now being
described as the subside epidemic.

596
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,408
<I>Military leaders have announced
they will take a strict

597
01:03:22,409 --> 01:03:24,487
<I>no tolerance approach
to the crisis.

598
01:03:24,501 --> 01:03:26,814
<I>An order to commence
the immediate round-up

599
01:03:26,818 --> 01:03:29,961
<I>and capture of all Class 4
blood-deprived citizens

600
01:03:29,962 --> 01:03:31,352
<I>has been issued.

601
01:03:43,326 --> 01:03:44,438
Are we close?

602
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:46,342
The Senator's cabin
should be just up ahead.

603
01:04:47,618 --> 01:04:49,187
It's all gone.

604
01:04:51,646 --> 01:04:53,066
Everything.

605
01:04:54,772 --> 01:04:57,273
We'll start again.

606
01:04:58,007 --> 01:04:59,982
We can't keep running.

607
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:05,137
I know someone
who can help.

608
01:05:15,962 --> 01:05:18,591
<I>With the current military
round-up in full effect

609
01:05:18,592 --> 01:05:20,389
<I>it's likely we will
continue to see

610
01:05:20,413 --> 01:05:22,502
<I>a decreased subside
presence on our streets.

611
01:05:22,515 --> 01:05:24,512
<I>But the question has been
asked: "Now what?"

612
01:05:24,529 --> 01:05:26,066
<I>Our families are starving.

613
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,376
<I>We can't afford to feed
these creatures, too.

614
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:31,241
<I>I know it might be
wrong but, these things,

615
01:05:31,242 --> 01:05:32,986
<I>they've got to go.

616
01:07:42,089 --> 01:07:43,829
<I>Die.

617
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:45,363
<I>Yeah.

618
01:08:05,232 --> 01:08:06,548
Thank you.

619
01:08:07,221 --> 01:08:08,722
I know. I know.

620
01:08:08,961 --> 01:08:10,598
Well, I couldn't have
done it without you.

621
01:08:14,136 --> 01:08:15,530
Shit.

622
01:08:17,567 --> 01:08:19,122
I'll call you back.

623
01:08:23,049 --> 01:08:24,934
You're really human.

624
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:30,004
-This is unbelievable.
- Hold it.

625
01:08:32,315 --> 01:08:34,331
I'm sorry. Who are you?

626
01:08:34,688 --> 01:08:37,013
We're the folks with
the crossbows.

627
01:08:37,016 --> 01:08:38,948
It's a dangerous
time, Chris.

628
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:42,348
We can´t be too careful.
Alright? Sit down, please.

629
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:47,064
Ed, it's me.

630
01:08:47,599 --> 01:08:50,442
After the 6 years we've
spent working together.

631
01:08:50,443 --> 01:08:52,720
You know the sacrifices
I've made.

632
01:08:52,997 --> 01:08:55,673
I've been with you
100% of the way.

633
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:57,170
- Always.
- I know.

634
01:08:58,257 --> 01:08:59,565
Alright, listen.

635
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:03,563
We've got something better
than a blood substitute.

636
01:09:05,523 --> 01:09:07,160
We've got a cure.

637
01:09:07,459 --> 01:09:11,666
And I can repeat the procedure,
but I'm going to need your help.

638
01:09:12,018 --> 01:09:15,332
This is a chance to
change everything.

639
01:09:26,413 --> 01:09:28,052
How did you do it?

640
01:09:41,496 --> 01:09:42,984
Are you going to
answer that?

641
01:09:48,391 --> 01:09:49,704
Hello.

642
01:09:50,304 --> 01:09:51,667
No.

643
01:09:52,223 --> 01:09:53,536
Yeah.

644
01:09:54,988 --> 01:09:56,300
Hold on.

645
01:09:57,131 --> 01:09:58,741
Ex-wife.

646
01:09:58,773 --> 01:10:01,108
It's messy. Can you
give me a second?

647
01:10:02,276 --> 01:10:03,602
Yeah.

648
01:10:06,278 --> 01:10:09,187
<I>No. We didn't
agree on that, so...

649
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:10,902
<I>What are you
talking about?

650
01:10:13,189 --> 01:10:14,777
<I>That's all?

651
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:19,772
<I>No. I don't remember
agreeing to this...

652
01:10:20,853 --> 01:10:23,505
This is one fucking
ugly house.

653
01:10:31,301 --> 01:10:32,748
Where are you going?

654
01:10:33,223 --> 01:10:35,227
Check on your friend.

655
01:11:09,082 --> 01:11:10,394
Go.

656
01:11:11,135 --> 01:11:12,501
Go.

657
01:11:26,845 --> 01:11:29,091
If they find us,
we can't help her.

658
01:12:10,883 --> 01:12:12,267
Put it down.

659
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:18,713
I don't believe it.

660
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,836
Don't come any closer.

661
01:12:28,434 --> 01:12:31,421
Frankie, I found a cure.

662
01:12:31,552 --> 01:12:32,862
Alright?

663
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:34,946
I can change you back.

664
01:12:37,036 --> 01:12:38,345
No.

665
01:12:38,389 --> 01:12:40,674
- Put it down, kid.
- No. It's alright.

666
01:12:40,842 --> 01:12:42,412
Frankie, it's alright.

667
01:12:43,272 --> 01:12:46,178
Frankie, it's not
too late.

668
01:12:47,729 --> 01:12:50,150
Do you know why
I turned you, Ed?

669
01:12:55,912 --> 01:12:58,126
You used to say to me
that you'd rather die

670
01:12:58,127 --> 01:13:00,487
than be like the
rest of us.

671
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:05,631
I didn't turn you because
it was convenient, or

672
01:13:05,632 --> 01:13:08,549
because of some selfish
need for blood.

673
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:11,159
I turned you because...

674
01:13:11,681 --> 01:13:13,951
you would've died
if I didn't.

675
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:17,478
I couldn't lose you, Ed.

676
01:13:21,159 --> 01:13:23,091
I'm fucked up bad.

677
01:13:26,966 --> 01:13:28,878
I can get you
out of here.

678
01:13:29,052 --> 01:13:31,632
We're not going anywhere
without Audrey.

679
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:34,940
- The woman?
- Yes, the woman.

680
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:37,904
You'll never
get to her.

681
01:13:40,991 --> 01:13:42,618
You want to help us?

682
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:46,541
Please.

683
01:13:53,657 --> 01:13:54,969
Okay.

684
01:13:58,243 --> 01:13:59,569
Okay.

685
01:14:16,297 --> 01:14:17,691
God damn it.

686
01:15:18,628 --> 01:15:19,995
Edward.

687
01:15:20,865 --> 01:15:23,205
You've got a tan.
It suits you.

688
01:15:28,278 --> 01:15:29,723
You know, Edward.

689
01:15:30,872 --> 01:15:33,031
Her blood has a scent

690
01:15:33,042 --> 01:15:35,367
that no substitute
could ever replace.

691
01:15:37,547 --> 01:15:38,915
Fear.

692
01:15:48,553 --> 01:15:50,179
I don't want to die.

693
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:55,324
I can't do this...

694
01:15:55,796 --> 01:15:57,360
being human.

695
01:15:57,796 --> 01:15:59,487
Isn't that what you wanted?

696
01:15:59,516 --> 01:16:01,446
I don't want to be afraid.

697
01:16:01,619 --> 01:16:04,987
I can never be free like
this, I see that now.

698
01:16:05,566 --> 01:16:06,878
Please.

699
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,263
Help me.

700
01:16:11,217 --> 01:16:13,082
What is it that you want?

701
01:16:13,489 --> 01:16:15,140
Turn us both.

702
01:16:15,369 --> 01:16:16,762
Let us leave.

703
01:16:16,829 --> 01:16:20,816
And I'll show you a way to
repopulate your entire human supply.

704
01:16:20,818 --> 01:16:22,965
What the hell are you doing?

705
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:25,734
And you would give
me this cure?

706
01:16:25,735 --> 01:16:27,139
Yes.

707
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:29,467
As long as you allow
her to go free, too.

708
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:30,790
No.

709
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:35,124
She doesn't sound
that interested

710
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:37,279
in your proposition,
Edward.

711
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,310
In time she'll come
to understand.

712
01:16:39,325 --> 01:16:40,678
Will she?

713
01:16:43,188 --> 01:16:44,554
Thank you.

714
01:16:46,657 --> 01:16:49,432
You know, I won't deny
that things have gotten

715
01:16:49,433 --> 01:16:52,259
progressively worse
during your absence.

716
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:55,991
The public, the military;
Everyone seemed starving.

717
01:16:56,136 --> 01:17:00,029
Our blood supplies
are well, gone.

718
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:01,265
Ed.

719
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:04,169
I myself was feeling
the effects of deprivation.

720
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,576
But as of yesterday

721
01:17:08,152 --> 01:17:10,127
it's all a thing of the past.

722
01:17:13,524 --> 01:17:16,879
You know, I always
thought it would be you

723
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,486
that would come up
with a stable substitute.

724
01:17:19,728 --> 01:17:23,313
Not Christopher. But,
I guess I was wrong.

725
01:17:23,759 --> 01:17:28,440
Look. We go into mass
production in two days.

726
01:17:29,016 --> 01:17:31,965
It's never been about a cure.

727
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:35,445
It's about repeat business.

728
01:17:38,593 --> 01:17:40,189
And besides...

729
01:17:41,302 --> 01:17:43,554
what's to cure?

730
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:49,026
So you see, Edward.

731
01:17:51,661 --> 01:17:53,771
I don't need you anymore.

732
01:17:55,899 --> 01:17:58,510
Of course you couldn't
make it as a human.

733
01:17:59,289 --> 01:18:00,994
You're weak.

734
01:18:03,589 --> 01:18:05,023
The truth is:

735
01:18:05,721 --> 01:18:08,142
You've always been a coward.

736
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:14,836
What did it feel like to
turn your own daughter?

737
01:18:16,632 --> 01:18:18,651
Oh, you didn't do it, did you?

738
01:18:18,975 --> 01:18:20,607
You couldn't, could you?

739
01:18:20,608 --> 01:18:23,538
You had my brother
do it for you.

740
01:18:25,348 --> 01:18:28,121
So who's the fucking coward?

741
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:13,749
Your blood.
What have you done to me?

742
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:18,859
<I>Vampires think they
own this world.

743
01:19:20,424 --> 01:19:22,732
<I>That the humans
have to hide from them.

744
01:19:24,205 --> 01:19:25,788
<I>That isn’t true.

745
01:19:31,087 --> 01:19:34,451
<I>Every day, the sun comes up.

746
01:19:38,552 --> 01:19:41,582
<I>And every day
the vamps have to hide.

747
01:19:46,187 --> 01:19:48,167
<I>Vampires can never survive.

748
01:19:49,607 --> 01:19:51,005
<I>That's the truth.

749
01:19:55,779 --> 01:19:57,619
<I>Elvis Presley once said:

750
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,207
<I>"Truth is like the sun.

751
01:20:02,028 --> 01:20:03,977
<I>you can shut it
out for a time

752
01:20:06,913 --> 01:20:08,306
<I>but it isn’t going away".

753
01:20:13,026 --> 01:20:14,352
<I>Mr. Bromley.

754
01:20:14,767 --> 01:20:16,079
<I>Open up.

755
01:20:16,999 --> 01:20:18,991
Treated vampire blood.

756
01:20:19,162 --> 01:20:21,065
That's the cure.

757
01:20:21,409 --> 01:20:23,179
Welcome back to humanity.

758
01:20:24,084 --> 01:20:26,178
Now you get to die.

759
01:20:35,026 --> 01:20:36,846
<I>Move. Move.

760
01:21:52,932 --> 01:21:54,312
Let's go.

761
01:22:17,225 --> 01:22:18,551
Don't do this.

762
01:22:20,539 --> 01:22:22,039
There's a cure.

763
01:22:23,878 --> 01:22:25,325
Don't do this.

764
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:33,639
Run.

765
01:22:44,123 --> 01:22:45,434
Ed.

766
01:25:53,718 --> 01:25:55,378
They can't be the cure.

767
01:25:56,253 --> 01:25:58,193
I can't let you do it.

768
01:25:59,968 --> 01:26:01,321
I'm sorry.

769
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:30,553
We have a cure.

770
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:32,722
We can change you back.

771
01:27:32,993 --> 01:27:34,671
It's not too late.
