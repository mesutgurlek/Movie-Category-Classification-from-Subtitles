497

of not believing it, Moses?

499
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,776

500

501
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,746
MOSES: Mother.

502
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:52,952
The man is a thief.

503
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,373
My son discovers this.

504
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:55,992
Not you.

505
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,999
And he reports it
to your father,

506
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,438
who would have
hanged this thief...

507
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,456
if he hadn't
been dying himself.

508

self-serving lies.

is if it is true.

511
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,257
To talk about
this any longer...

512
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,640
would dignify it...

513
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,800

Sit down.

521

ask you some things...

522
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,577
that are going to seem
very strange to you.

523
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,619
I just would like you
to answer them truthfully.

524
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,661
How do you know Moses?

525
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,085
You know how I know him...

526
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,584
and you.

527
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,720
I helped raise you both.

528
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,639
So you are not
his sister, then?

529
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,759
Of course not.

530

531

537
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,794

on the table, Miriam.

538

Thank you.

539

540

don't take this any further.

541
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,300
Don't take this
any further, or what?

542

Do not take this
any further.

about that?

or use it, now.

to answer the question?

546
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,403
Then I'll proceed.

547
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,444
Miriam, I'm going
to ask you again...

548
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:55,891
and if your answer
is again no...

549
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,952
I apologize for
what happens next.

550
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,414
Are you his sister?

551

No.

kill him, but you have one.

This was treason.
How was it treason?

556
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,761
He just admitted he knew.

557

That wasn't an admission!

her arm lopped off!

He does not
believe this story.

561
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,656
I don't want to believe it!

562
