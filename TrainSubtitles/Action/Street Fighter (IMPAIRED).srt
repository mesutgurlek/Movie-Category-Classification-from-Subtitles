After seven months of fighting,
the civil war in Shadaloo...

3
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:51,809

the turning point.

This is Chun-Li Zang

A.N. forces are consolidating their hold
on Shadaloo City today...

8
00:01:17,473 --> 00:01:22,570
after a night of skirmishing that
secured this key Southeast Asian port.

the ragtag city militia is one thing.

with a power-mad dictator.

01:13:12,872 --> 01:13:16,501
Get the hostages free, and I'll get you
two first-class tickets home, okay?

799
01:13:16,575 --> 01:13:18,304
Go!

800
01:13:18,377 --> 01:13:20,504
Go, cowards!

801
01:13:20,579 --> 01:13:23,446
[Yelling]

802
01:13:27,853 --> 01:13:31,584
- [Growls]
- Ah-sah!

803
01:13:37,897 --> 01:13:40,297
Come on. Go!

804
01:13:46,205 --> 01:13:50,072
All that's left is revenge.

805
01:14:14,563 --> 01:14:17,657
Find Ken and Ryu,
and get the hostages out.

806
01:14:18,901 --> 01:14:21,028
Hey! Good-bye!

807
01:14:21,103 --> 01:14:23,799
We'll do what we can.

808
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:25,670
Okay. Go.

809
01:14:25,741 --> 01:14:27,675
[Computer]
Attention, all troopers.

810
01:14:27,743 --> 01:14:31,372
Remember that maintaining
your health plan benefits
is your responsibility.

811
01:14:33,983 --> 01:14:37,214
- Mainframe link has been severed.
- Where's Blanka?

812
01:14:37,286 --> 01:14:39,948
[Dee Jay] I don't know, General.
Everything's crossing!

813
01:14:41,057 --> 01:14:44,686
[Bison]
He's fighting my men!

814
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,991
The cerebral programming!
Quick, patch it in here!

815
01:14:49,999 --> 01:14:51,591
No!

816
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:27,268
Now! Keep movin'!
Let's rock and roll!

817
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:41,147
Hup, hup!
Watch your step!

818
01:15:44,453 --> 01:15:48,753
[Bison]
Then defeat is a possibility.
Very well.

819
01:15:48,824 --> 01:15:51,759
We shall face it together, Dee Jay,

820
01:15:51,827 --> 01:15:56,287
- [Man Screaming]
- With the stoicism...

821
01:15:56,365 --> 01:15:58,993
of the true warrior.

822
01:15:59,068 --> 01:16:01,366
[Computer]
Battle systems are compromised.

823
01:16:01,437 --> 01:16:05,635
Estimated repair time:
18 months, 24 days.

824
01:16:08,844 --> 01:16:10,471
- Sayonara, buddy.
- Come on. Let's go.

825
01:16:10,546 --> 01:16:13,379
- Where are you going, man?
- What are you, nuts?

826
01:16:13,449 --> 01:16:16,247
Ryu, Guile put a gun to our head.
We did our part.

827
01:16:16,318 --> 01:16:19,116
The real soldiers are here,
and we're gone.

828
01:16:19,188 --> 01:16:22,248
What's wrong with you? There's people
fighting upstairs, dying upstairs.

829
01:16:22,324 --> 01:16:24,485
And they get paid for it.
We don't!

830
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,494
Now, you comin' with me or not?

831
01:16:26,562 --> 01:16:28,792
Maybe before this place blows up,
we can find something worthwhile.

832
01:16:28,864 --> 01:16:33,927
No, thanks. I already found
something worthwhile.

833
01:16:34,003 --> 01:16:37,063
- I don't understand.
- I know you don't.

834
01:16:39,542 --> 01:16:42,340
Stop! Stop!

835
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:32,659
We're pushing back the enemy,
but there's skirmishes on every level.

836
01:17:32,728 --> 01:17:35,959
Still no sign of Bison.

837
01:17:40,336 --> 01:17:41,826
He's probably hiding.

838
01:17:44,807 --> 01:17:46,741
Hiding?

839
01:17:46,809 --> 01:17:49,539
What do I have
to fear from you?

840
01:17:49,612 --> 01:17:54,515
Worker ants scurrying about...

841
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:56,574
with their pitiful weapons,

842
01:17:56,652 --> 01:17:59,519
afraid of the purity...

843
01:17:59,588 --> 01:18:01,681
of unarmed combat.

844
01:18:01,757 --> 01:18:04,555
Come out from behind
the curtain, wizard!

845
01:18:04,627 --> 01:18:07,596
Let's see how pure
your combat really is.

846
01:18:07,663 --> 01:18:10,359
Come on!

847
01:18:10,432 --> 01:18:12,263
Sir, no!
That's exactly what he wants!

848
01:18:12,334 --> 01:18:15,064
No, T. Hawk.
That's what we both want.

849
01:18:15,137 --> 01:18:17,367
Am I right, Bison?

850
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:19,430
Are you man enough
to fight with me?

851
01:18:19,508 --> 01:18:22,477
Anyone who opposes me
will be destroyed.

852
01:18:22,544 --> 01:18:25,741
- Colonel, you can't!
- Oh, yes, I can.

853
01:18:25,814 --> 01:18:28,009
Just take the hostages out.

854
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:30,517
If I'm not topside
in 15 minutes,

855
01:18:30,586 --> 01:18:34,113
evacuate without me,
both of you.

856
01:18:34,189 --> 01:18:37,716
- That's an order!
- Move out!

857
01:18:37,793 --> 01:18:39,784
That's right, men.
Move out!

858
01:18:39,862 --> 01:18:42,092
Troopers, out!

859
01:18:42,164 --> 01:18:44,325
Throw the enemy
into the sea!

860
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,425
Leave us!

861
01:18:51,407 --> 01:18:54,069
You have made me a happy man.

862
01:18:54,143 --> 01:18:56,407
Next, I'll make you a dead one.

863
01:19:49,898 --> 01:19:53,061
- You'll have to do better than that.
- Okay.

864
01:19:53,135 --> 01:19:55,035
That's for Charlie.

865
01:19:55,104 --> 01:19:57,072
That's for his soldiers.

866
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,025
Aaah!

867
01:20:23,098 --> 01:20:24,565
Come on!

868
01:20:31,306 --> 01:20:33,365
[Chun-Li]
The hostages, where are they?

869
01:20:42,284 --> 01:20:45,549
Now then,
where are those hostages?

870
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:11,079
[Groaning]

871
01:21:35,137 --> 01:21:36,604
C.Q., this is Guile.

872
01:21:36,672 --> 01:21:39,232
Cammy here.
Colonel, are you all right?

873
01:21:39,308 --> 01:21:42,040
I'm okay.
I'm just half dead.

874
01:21:42,174 --> 01:21:45,302
- And Bison?
- All dead.

875
01:21:45,377 --> 01:21:48,835
- What's the situation?
- Fighting in every corridor, sir.

876
01:21:48,914 --> 01:21:51,747
What about our reserves?
Have they arrived yet?

877
01:21:51,817 --> 01:21:54,809
Sawada's reinforcements
are still hitting the beachhead.

878
01:21:54,886 --> 01:21:58,322
They have their hands full
with the enemy outside the fortress.

879
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:00,415
I'm afraid it could
still go either way.

880
01:22:00,492 --> 01:22:02,619
[Guile]
Well, it's gonna go our way.

881
01:22:02,694 --> 01:22:04,719
Have our troops
on the upper levels...

882
01:22:04,796 --> 01:22:06,957
fall back and turn on the enemy.

883
01:22:07,032 --> 01:22:11,765
- We'll trap the forces outside
between both of our columns.
- We'll do it, Colonel.

884
01:22:11,837 --> 01:22:14,806
But we still haven't
found the hostages yet.

885
01:22:14,873 --> 01:22:18,104
I've got some volunteers on it.

886
01:22:18,176 --> 01:22:22,408
And maybe they'll be...
able to help.

887
01:22:27,753 --> 01:22:31,120
Colonel, I didn't read the last part.
Colonel, are you there?

888
01:22:37,863 --> 01:22:40,195
Ah, yes!

889
01:22:40,265 --> 01:22:44,463
[Sighs]
My mama didn't raise no fool, baby.

890
01:22:44,536 --> 01:22:48,028
Oh, man!
I should have stayed at Microsoft.

891
01:22:48,106 --> 01:22:51,940
[Computer] All personnel,
report to battle stations.

892
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:56,208
Battle stations.
Report to battle stations at once.

893
01:22:57,115 --> 01:22:59,982
There's gotta be somethin'.

894
01:23:01,787 --> 01:23:03,914
Ahhh!

895
01:23:07,192 --> 01:23:09,353
Okay.

896
01:23:09,428 --> 01:23:11,055
Where's the old front door?

897
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:24,238
Ryu, where're you goin'?

898
01:23:27,612 --> 01:23:30,843
Ryu, hang a "U," amigo!

899
01:23:30,916 --> 01:23:33,180
You're walking into a trap!

900
01:23:34,753 --> 01:23:38,245
Ryu, get outta there!

901
01:23:38,323 --> 01:23:39,915
Ryu!

902
01:23:50,936 --> 01:23:53,166
- Vega!
- Where were we?

903
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:56,674
You were losing.

904
01:23:56,808 --> 01:23:59,003
[Guile]
No weapon, Bison.

905
01:23:59,077 --> 01:24:01,671
What happened to the purity
of unarmed combat?

906
01:24:01,747 --> 01:24:06,013
This is merely
superconductor electromagnetism.

907
01:24:06,084 --> 01:24:07,847
Surely you've heard of it.

908
01:24:07,919 --> 01:24:11,787
It levitates bullet trains
from Tokyo to Osaka.

909
01:24:11,857 --> 01:24:15,258
It levitates my desk,

910
01:24:15,327 --> 01:24:17,955
where I ride
the saddle of the world.

911
01:24:19,097 --> 01:24:22,032
And it levitates...

912
01:24:23,201 --> 01:24:24,725
me!

913
01:24:59,504 --> 01:25:01,938
Something wrong, Colonel?

914
01:25:02,007 --> 01:25:05,534
You come here prepared
to fight a madman,

915
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:08,010
and instead
you found a god?

916

Ken!

917
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,809
Die!

[Screaming]

919
01:27:05,130 --> 01:27:07,724
Here you go, Sagat.
I owe you.

920
01:27:09,134 --> 01:27:12,262
If I hadn't met you,
I might've become you.

921
01:27:25,116 --> 01:27:29,052
You still refuse
to accept... my godhood?

922
01:27:30,121 --> 01:27:32,487
Keep your own God!

923
01:27:32,557 --> 01:27:37,654
In fact, this might be
a good time to pray to him.

924
01:27:37,729 --> 01:27:40,425
For I beheld Satan,

925
01:27:40,498 --> 01:27:43,399
and he fell from heaven...

926
01:27:44,369 --> 01:27:47,964

Why you out of uniform?

he's a bad guy?

If you know this,
then why do you serve him?
