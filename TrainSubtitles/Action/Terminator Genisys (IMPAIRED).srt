1
00:00:56,372 --> 00:00:58,834
<i>Before they died, my
parents told me stories</i>

2
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,733
<i>of how the world once was.</i>

3
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:03,834
<i>What it was like long
before I was born.</i>

4
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:06,861
<i>Before the war with the machines.</i>

5
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,267
<i>They remembered a green world,</i>

6
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:12,969
<i>vast and beautiful,</i>

7
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:16,763
<i>filled with laughter</i>

8
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:20,352
<i>and hope for the future.</i>

9
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:24,958
<i>But it's a world I never knew.</i>

10
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:27,047
<i>By the time I was born...</i>

11
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,039
<i>all this, was gone.</i>

12
00:01:37,335 --> 00:01:38,755
<i>SkyNet,</i>

13
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:44,234
<i>a computer program designed
to automate missile defense.</i>

14
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:47,888
<i>It was supposed to protect us.</i>

15
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,917
<i>But that's not what happened.</i>

16
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,550
<i>On August 29, 1997</i>

17
00:01:53,302 --> 00:01:54,799
<i>SkyNet woke up.</i>

18
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:59,424
<i>And decided all humanity was
a threat to its existence.</i>

19
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:40,914
<i>It used our own bombs
against us.</i>

20
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,017
<i>Three billion people died
in the nuclear fire.</i>

21
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:52,909
<i>The survivors...</i>

22
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,261
<i>called it Judgement Day.</i>

23
00:02:57,268 --> 00:02:59,848
<i>People lived like rats
in the shadows,</i>

24
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:03,593
<i>hiding, starving, or worse;</i>

25
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:07,249
<i>captured and put into
camps for extermination.</i>

26
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,642
<i>I was born, after Judgement Day,</i>

27
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:21,955
<i>into a broken world,</i>

28
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:27,007
<i>ruled by the machines.</i>

29
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,421
<i>The worst were
infiltration units,</i>

30
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,436
<i>designed to pass for human.</i>

31
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,955
<i>We called them Terminators.</i>

32
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,258
It's OK, buddy.

33
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:02,341
You're all on your own?

34
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,040
Are there others down there?

35
00:04:41,972 --> 00:04:43,892
<i>And then one man found me.</i>

36
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:47,832
<i>His name is John Connor.</i>

37
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,447
<i>And he changed everything.</i>

38
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:58,513
<i>John showed us how to fight back,</i>

39
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:01,505
<i>how to rise up.</i>

40
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:09,877
<i>He freed prisoners,</i>

41
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,234
<i>taught us to smash
the machines to scrap.</i>

42
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,797
<i>People whisper about John.</i>

43
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,855
<i>Wonder how he can know
the things he does.</i>

44
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:28,090
<i>They use words like, 'prophet'.</i>

45
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:30,271
<i>But John is more.</i>

46
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:32,814
<i>We're here because tonight</i>

47
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:35,748
<i>he's gonna lead us,
to crush SkyNet.</i>

48
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,302
<i>For good.</i>

49
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,388
Sir, request to join the
Colorado Offensive.

50
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:42,398
I need you with me, Reese.

51
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:44,937
We're talking about the complete
destruction of SkyNet, sir.

52
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:47,107
Colorado Unit will succeed.

53
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:49,232
The machines will fall tonight.

54
00:05:50,154 --> 00:05:53,404
Right here the Los Angeles assault
is just as important, maybe more...

55
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:56,245
More important than
destroying SkyNet's central core?

56
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:59,692
John, I don't understand why you're
leading an attack on a workcamp.

57
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,694
Because the camp is a camoflauge.

58
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:03,617
Inside the camp is a hangar.

59
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:06,622
Beneath that hangar, SkyNet's
hidden it's final weapon.

60
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:09,046
When SkyNet realizes
it has lost, it will

61
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:11,796
deploy that weapon to
insure it's own survival.

62
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,475
We take it tonight,
or there is no tomorrow.

63
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:16,864
Then we'll take it.

64
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:23,922
You're my right hand, Reese,
I never thanked you for it.

65
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,974
You don't need to.

66
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:27,027
You gave us all a future, John.

67
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:29,628
I'm gonna use mine.

68
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:31,573
When this is all over, I'm...

69
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:33,987
I'm gonna find my parent's house.

70
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:35,557
Re-build it.

71
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,531
Use my hands, for something
other than killing.

72
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:40,345
How about you?

73
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:43,521
Cold beer'd be good.

74
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:46,648
- That's your perfect plan?
- Yes.

75
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:49,462
Yeah, I guess I don't
think about it too much.

76
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:50,982
Yeah, I can see that.

77
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:55,925
I figure, whatever happens,

78
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:59,103
it's gotta be better than this.

79
00:07:04,272 --> 00:07:06,571
So many of us have died,
to get here.

80
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,577
I want you to know, Kyle,

81
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:12,091
if there was another way,
I would've taken it.

82
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,255
Move out.

83
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,099
The machine thinks

84
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:42,302
that we cannot win.

85
00:07:48,817 --> 00:07:51,354
The machine thinks,
that we will not...

86
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:55,635
strike at the very
heart of SkyNet.

87
00:07:58,121 --> 00:07:59,981
Yet here we stand.

88
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:04,187
On the precipice of
the final battle.

89
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,410
If we die tonight,

90
00:08:10,214 --> 00:08:12,567
mankind dies with us.

91
00:08:17,198 --> 00:08:18,209
No!

92
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,060
I look at each of you,

93
00:08:25,252 --> 00:08:28,536
and I see the marks of this
long and terrible war.

94
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:38,967
Go! Go!

95
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:40,990
<i>Perimeter breach.</i>

96
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,693
<i>Activate model 1-0-1.</i>

97
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:48,869
For our children.

98
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,681
Our children's children; so they
will not carry these marks.

99
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,926
But they will know who we are

100
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:00,895
and what we did!

101
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:06,349
That we did not bow down.
We did not give in.

102
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:09,683
We rose up, at this moment,

103
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,630
at this hour!

104
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:14,476
Willing to sacrifice everything...

105
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:18,210
so that they could
live in freedom!

106
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,066
On this night,

107
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:26,808
we take back our world!

108
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:41,961
They're using the weapon!

109
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:44,204
We gotta get to the hangar.

110
00:09:44,523 --> 00:09:45,523
John!

111
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,099
John!

112
00:10:15,453 --> 00:10:17,467
You want me? I'm right here!

113
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:24,036
<i>Colorado units reporting in.
SkyNet central core is down.</i>

114
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:26,769
<i>Repeat: SkyNet has been destroyed.</i>

115
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,111
<i>John was right.</i>

116
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:33,197
<i>Colorado unit succeded</i>

117
00:10:34,115 --> 00:10:35,714
<i>and the machines fell.</i>

118
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,897
<i>But it was too late.</i>

119
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:40,217
We found it, sir.

120
00:10:40,697 --> 00:10:42,812
Right where you
said it would be.

121
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:48,386
What is that thing?

122
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:50,729
Fate.

123
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:59,143
It's the first tactical time weapon.
SkyNet just used it.

124
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,156
What the hell?

125
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:40,898
We'll need 15 minutes to
ready the machine, sir.

126
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:45,004
We're running co-ordinates,
we should have them for you momentarily.

127
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,922
Los Angeles, 1984.

128
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,860
Los Angeles, May 12th...

129
00:12:52,626 --> 00:12:53,681
1984.

130
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:00,804
SkyNet knew it was losing,

131
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:02,477
so it tried to rig the game.

132
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:06,032
It sent a terminator back to
the time before the war.

133
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:07,511
And who's the target?

134
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:09,613
My mother.

135
00:13:10,984 --> 00:13:12,279
Sarah Connor.

136
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:15,672
If the machine suceeds,
I'll never be born.

137
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:17,904
They'll kill her first.

138
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:22,146
And by doing so, erase every victory
we fought for, including, tonight's.

139
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:25,722
There won't be a Resistance
to challenge the machines.

140
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:29,261
With this one act
SkyNet will win.

141
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:32,339
We can use the technology ourselves.
Send someone back.

142
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:34,230
We don't even know
if that'll work.

143
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:35,493
- I'll go, sir.
- I'll go, sir.

144
00:13:35,518 --> 00:13:36,601
I'll go!

145
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:39,052
I'll volunteer.

146
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:44,528
I'll go back.

147
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:46,751
Why should I send you...

148
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:49,673
over all of them?

149
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:53,521
'Cause I'd die for Sarah Connor.

150
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:56,669
All these people would
die for Sarah Connor.

151
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:59,490
What makes you any different?

152
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:02,941
You know why.

153
00:14:04,972 --> 00:14:08,003
Everything you told me about her.
I know her, John.

154
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,411
Let me save her.

155
00:14:17,426 --> 00:14:18,708
No weapons?

156
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:20,800
We've measured the magnetic field.

157
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:23,510
It'll rip apart anything
not encased in living tissue.

158
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:29,593
Think tinfoil in a micro-wave, times a
few billion. Nothing left but a crater.

159
00:14:33,062 --> 00:14:34,092
Oh...

160
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:35,803
no clothes, either.

161
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:40,655
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

162
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,380
You knew the device
would be here.

163
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:45,560
You knew what it'd be set for.

164
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:48,818
You knew the machines
would fall tonight.

165
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:50,944
So before I go, tell me.

166
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:53,493
Tell you, what?

167
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:56,513
You see the future?

168
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,810
No one can see the future, Reese.

169
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:02,544
OK, then how do you know?

170
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:05,818
I cheat.

171
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,907
Sarah told me so much.
She gave me signposts.

172
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:17,227
When I was a kid, it seemed like
my mother knew everything.

173
00:15:17,596 --> 00:15:18,960
Musta been great.

174
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:21,046
Not really.

175
00:15:22,835 --> 00:15:24,163
It stops here.

176
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:27,255
Once you go back,
my knowledge ends.

177
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:29,385
That's as much as Sarah knew.

178
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:31,414
So, no more cheating.

179
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:33,202
No more cheating.

180
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:47,495
At the time you're going back to, she won't
be the warrior that raised me. Not yet.

181
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:49,831
She'll be scared and weak.

182
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:52,030
She won't know how to fight
or defend herself.

183
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:56,215
Her bigest worry is making rent
and tuition. She's a waitress.

184
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,497
What?

185
00:15:58,803 --> 00:15:59,803
Oh...

186
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:02,624
Never mind.

187
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:06,534
Just be ready for
the fact that she

188
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,283
will need you but
she won't know it.

189
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:10,082
So, what do I say to her?

190
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:13,432
Even when I tell her who I am,
she's not gonna believe me.

191
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:18,733
Tell her this:

192
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:24,300
"Thank you Sarah. for your
courage during the dark years"

193
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:27,866
"I can't help you with
what you must soon face"

194
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,271
"except to say the
future is not set".

195
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,870
"There is no fate, but
that we make for ourselves"

196
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:39,128
"You must be stronger
than you imagine you can be."

197
00:16:39,944 --> 00:16:41,599
"You must survive,"

198
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:44,747
"or I will never exist."

199
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,349
Take care of her for me, Kyle.

200
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:57,132
I will.

201
00:16:58,858 --> 00:17:00,127
Promise you.

202
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:24,183
What you're doing right now,
this is the end of the war.

203
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:07,767
You didn't think it would be
that easy, did you?

204
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:09,066
John!

205
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:36,294
Hey, birthday boy!

206
00:18:36,678 --> 00:18:38,419
Present time, let's go.

207
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:49,985
No way!

208
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:53,739
<i>Genisys will auto-update
as soon as it comes online.</i>

209
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:55,887
<i>You'll have it the
moment it comes out.</i>

210
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,239
Just a few days more.

211
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:02,713
Straight line!

212
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:11,406
Remember,
Genisys is SkyNet.

213
00:19:11,805 --> 00:19:15,172
When Genisys comes online,
Judgement Day begins.

214
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:18,079
You can kill SkyNet
before it's born.

215
00:20:18,837 --> 00:20:20,032
Hey, bud?

216
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:23,821
D'you just see a real bright light?

217
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:29,825
My turn.

218
00:20:31,305 --> 00:20:32,395
Hey, hey!

219
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:34,942
What's wrong with this picture?

220
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:44,740
Nice night for a walk, hey?

221
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:48,075
Nice night for a walk.

222
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,121
Wash day tomorrow,
nothing clean, right?

223
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:53,315
Nothing clean. Right.

224
00:20:53,581 --> 00:20:56,901
Hey, I think this guy's a couple
of cans short of a six-pack.

225
00:20:56,902 --> 00:20:59,442
Your clothes.
Give them to me, now!

226
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:01,466
Hey, fuck you asshole.

227
00:21:01,568 --> 00:21:03,952
You won't be needing
any clothes.

228
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,053
I've been waiting for you.

229
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:14,054
Hey! That sonofabitch
just stole my pants!

230
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:34,445
What day is it? What year?

231
00:23:34,772 --> 00:23:37,023
May 12, 1984.

232
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:38,992
The day you arrive.

233
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:20,184
LAPD! Freeze!

234
00:25:20,747 --> 00:25:23,177
Ow, that friggin' hurt!

235
00:25:23,203 --> 00:25:25,262
- Garber, are you okay?
- You tell me, O'Brien.

236
00:25:25,321 --> 00:25:27,559
You're human.
You gotta let me go.

237
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:30,496
Face down, hands on your
back or I will shoot!

238
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:31,521
Listen.

239
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,736
Hey!

240
00:25:34,312 --> 00:25:35,918
It's coming.

241
00:25:36,938 --> 00:25:39,592
You have to listen to me,
or we're all gonna die.

242
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:42,021
I had it under control.

243
00:25:42,365 --> 00:25:43,944
Yeah, OK, TJ Hooker.

244
00:25:45,014 --> 00:25:47,983
Here's what you don't do
your first day on the beat;

245
00:25:48,022 --> 00:25:50,308
<i>use lethal force
on the homeless...</i>

246
00:25:57,436 --> 00:25:59,678
<i>By the way, you're filling out
the paperwork.</i>

247
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:01,990
Garber?

248
00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:13,820
Shit!

249
00:26:21,387 --> 00:26:23,769
That's gotta be an alien,
like from outer space.

250
00:26:23,793 --> 00:26:25,574
It's a machine that kills humans.

251
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:27,812
- Uncuff me!
- No, you're under arrest!

252
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,507
What part of 'kills humans'
is confusing to you?

253
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:32,577
Handcuffs!

254
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:40,235
O'Brien: officer down.
We need back-up.

255
00:26:41,294 --> 00:26:42,798
It' a robot.

256
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,820
- We're screwed are we?
- Pretty much.

257
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:06,134
Come with me if you wanna live!

258
00:27:15,192 --> 00:27:16,450
Now, soldier!

259
00:27:43,632 --> 00:27:45,294
Reese, right?

260
00:27:45,761 --> 00:27:47,079
Kyle Reese?

261
00:27:47,922 --> 00:27:50,235
- You're Sarah.
- Yeah, I know that.

262
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,357
You hit your head back there?

263
00:27:52,382 --> 00:27:54,381
A Terminator, I dunno the model.

264
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,717
T-1,000, liquid metal,
shape changer.

265
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,678
It just needs to touch
something to mimic it.

266
00:27:58,709 --> 00:28:01,144
You know about Terminators?
And you know who I am?

267
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:05,501
You were sent to protect me by John
Connor, the leader of the Resistance.

268
00:28:05,526 --> 00:28:06,558
My son.

269
00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:10,083
-I don't understand.
You can't know any of this. - But I do.

270
00:28:10,185 --> 00:28:12,396
Listen to me Reese.
Everything's changed.

271
00:28:12,434 --> 00:28:15,103
The 1984 John sent you to,
it no longer exists.

272
00:28:15,117 --> 00:28:17,445
No, this is all wrong,
John sent me to save you.

273
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,809
From the Terminator that
was sent back to kill me.

274
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:22,419
I know, but we already
took care of him.

275
00:28:23,677 --> 00:28:24,713
We?

276
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:27,784
Get down!

277
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,075
Reese, stop it!

278
00:28:40,371 --> 00:28:41,791
Reese, goddamit!

279
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:43,067
- Stay here!
- Reese, wait!

280
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:47,176
- Those bullets'll kill him!
- He's here to kill you, stay in the truck.

281
00:28:54,593 --> 00:28:56,375
Aw, great. That's just great.

282
00:28:57,352 --> 00:28:59,152
I did not kill him.

283
00:29:00,753 --> 00:29:04,401
We do not have long before the
T-1000 acquires our position.

284
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:11,235
Arguing with Kyle Reese, puts us
at a strategic disadvantage.

285
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:13,445
Bite me.

286
00:29:14,614 --> 00:29:16,902
That is a very immature response.

287
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,169
So you're the one we've
been waiting for?

288
00:29:31,093 --> 00:29:32,316
How is he?

289
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:33,716
Still breathing.

290
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:38,068
Good. Then you should be able to mate
with Kyle Reese in this time line.

291
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:40,935
OK, we're not having
this conversation again.

292
00:29:41,271 --> 00:29:43,315
We know your son
will be John Connor.

293
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,900
And that the machines cannot
be defeated without him.

294
00:29:45,925 --> 00:29:47,427
I do not see a choice.

295
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,663
Story of my life...
Look, it's not just mating.

296
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,521
I'm supposed to fall
in love with him.

297
00:29:51,591 --> 00:29:55,019
-My files do not deal with love.
- Shocker, there!

298
00:29:55,675 --> 00:29:57,038
You're being emotional.

299
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:58,236
This is my life.

300
00:29:58,261 --> 00:30:02,306
I wouldn't mind being consulted,
once in a while, about how it's gonna go.

301
00:30:11,716 --> 00:30:13,793
♪ <i>Happy birthday...</i>

302
00:30:14,802 --> 00:30:15,896

Hey!

310
00:30:40,582 --> 00:30:42,434
I need answers, right now!

311
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:46,544
How'd that liquid-metal thing
know where to intercept me, huh?

312
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:48,255
Where'd it come from?

313
00:30:48,737 --> 00:30:51,337
Who the hell's this skin-job?
What the hell is going on?

314
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:54,886
Sorry, we were busy with the whole
life and death comabat thing.

315
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:56,760
And then you attacked Pops.

316
00:30:57,396 --> 00:30:58,634
You named it?

317
00:30:58,972 --> 00:31:00,602
Hello, Kyle Reese.

318
00:31:02,172 --> 00:31:03,899
It is nice to meet you.

319
00:31:06,757 --> 00:31:08,125
Are you kidding me?

320
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,507
I've been trying to
teach him to blend in.

321
00:31:12,047 --> 00:31:13,513
I know, he needs work.

322
00:31:13,849 --> 00:31:17,649
It's a Terminator, the only reason
it blends in, is to kill humans.

323
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:19,550
Pops doesn't kill anyone.

324
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,902
Leaves a lotta
leg-wounds, though.

325
00:31:22,365 --> 00:31:23,585
It looks old.

326
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:26,324
Never seen a Terminator,
old, before.

327
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:28,661
The flesh they put
on the cyborgs

328
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:31,215
is normal, human tissue.
It ages.

329
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:34,052
My auditory circuits have
not degraded, however.

330
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:35,747
I'm old...

331
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:38,021
not obsolete.

332
00:31:38,587 --> 00:31:40,156
I think you hurt his feelings.

333
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:41,813
It doesn't have feelings!

334
00:31:42,462 --> 00:31:44,481
He saved my life
when I was nine.

335
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:46,702
He's the only reason I'm alive.

336
00:31:46,734 --> 00:31:49,575
I was programmed to
protect Sarah Connor.

337
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:50,974
I will not stop.

338
00:31:51,412 --> 00:31:54,331
Yeah, programmed by who?
Huh? Who sent him back?

339
00:31:54,332 --> 00:31:55,882
Those files have been erased.

340
00:31:55,883 --> 00:31:56,927
Oh, that's convenient!

341
00:31:56,952 --> 00:31:58,950
Whoever sent him, they
don't want us to know.

342
00:31:58,975 --> 00:32:00,325
Not me, not him, not anyone.

343
00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:02,507
So SkyNet can't target
the person who saved me.

344
00:32:02,532 --> 00:32:05,672
Logically, it's someone who
wants Sarah Connor to live.

345
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,866
Old...

346
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,858
Not obsolete.

347
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:27,431
The T-1000 knows where we are.

348
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:29,274
Make yourself useful...

349
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:32,524
and don't shoot Pops.

350
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:01,103
This is insane.

351
00:33:01,677 --> 00:33:03,431
All of it. This is
not the mission.

352
00:33:03,462 --> 00:33:05,880
What I'm trying to
tell you, Reese,

353
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,024
The girl that you came
back for; she's gone.

354
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:12,925
I don't need saving

355
00:33:13,943 --> 00:33:16,341
-There's a new mission.
-Oh, yeah. Which is?

356
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:21,600
If the past can change,
then, so can the future.

357
00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:25,967
We can stop Judgement Day
from happening. Ever.

358
00:33:27,884 --> 00:33:30,025
Kill SkyNet before it's born.

359
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:32,212
What?

360
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:37,394
Get down!

361
00:33:37,753 --> 00:33:40,292
-We've been re-acquired.
- Yeah, no shit!

362
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:07,294
Get back!

363
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:58,237
Wait, why are we stopping?
Why are...

364
00:34:58,657 --> 00:35:01,052
Hey! We can't stay
here, he'll find us.

365
00:35:01,081 --> 00:35:02,268
That's the idea.

366
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:03,708
Pops, get it open.

367
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:06,810
Give me a hand!

368
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:16,841
You said it happened because
the past was altered. How?

369
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,241
Does that matter?

370
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:19,404
How, Sarah?

371
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:24,003
A Terminator was sent after
me when I was a kid.

372
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:27,910
Terminators only come from
one place; the future.

373
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,773
Something happened.

374
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:37,435
Ok, so?

375
00:35:37,776 --> 00:35:39,724
I think I might have
seen it... what?

376
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,215
What're you talking about?

377
00:35:43,953 --> 00:35:45,982
When John sent me back,
he was attacked.

378
00:35:46,932 --> 00:35:48,661
By a... Terminator.

379
00:35:48,686 --> 00:35:51,161
Did it kill him?
Is John dead?

380
00:35:52,935 --> 00:35:54,005
I dunno.

381
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,997
I saw it grab him
when I was going.

382
00:35:58,294 --> 00:36:00,566
We've approximately
35 seconds.

383
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,732
Or less.

384
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:18,493
Sarah, go!

385
00:38:15,551 --> 00:38:17,751
And I volunteered for this shit!

386
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:18,222
Sarah!

387
00:39:19,214 --> 00:39:20,497
You gotta help me.

388
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:21,935
I'm hurt.

389
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,474
Sarah!

390
00:39:26,385 --> 00:39:27,893
Shh...it!

391
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:34,115
Hey, it's me, Sarah.

392
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,607
Sarah, he's lying.

393
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:37,294
Hey.

394
00:39:37,786 --> 00:39:40,818
- He's the machine, I'm Reese.
- It's me, Sarah.

395
00:39:41,396 --> 00:39:43,675
Listen, the Terminator's
not dead it attacked me.

396
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,158
Sarah, you said
they could mimic.

397
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:47,640
It's me Sarah!
It's mimicking, shoot it.

398
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:49,091
I'm Reese, shoot him!

399
00:39:57,045 --> 00:39:58,137
Nice try.

400
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,246
Run!

401
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:02,969
How'd you know
which one was him?

402
00:41:03,153 --> 00:41:05,310
Well, I didn't know exactly.

403
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,559
You could've shot me.

404
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:10,250
Well, I was... pretty
sure it wasn't you.

405
00:41:11,548 --> 00:41:12,749
Pretty sure?

406
00:41:13,168 --> 00:41:17,111
We've prepping for you to arrive,
for over a decade. That, too.

407
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:20,541
- So, you set up a trap.
- Had to.

408
00:41:20,873 --> 00:41:23,269
We can't leave any future tech
behind when we go.

409
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:24,557
Go?

410
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:26,596
Go, where?

411
00:41:29,146 --> 00:41:30,572
That's...

412
00:41:31,017 --> 00:41:32,744
A time displacement device.

413
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:35,029
Yeah, well, it looks
like a piece of junk.

414
00:41:35,122 --> 00:41:37,100
There's no governing
technology in this time

415
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:39,193
that can control the
displacement circuits.

416
00:41:39,431 --> 00:41:42,451
You needed a CPU from
the future to make it run.

417
00:41:43,327 --> 00:41:45,426
You couldn't exactly
use your own.

418
00:41:47,107 --> 00:41:48,465
We get one trip, only.

419
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:51,638
It's gonna fry the chip and take
out most of the LA City power grid.

420
00:41:52,122 --> 00:41:53,223
Are you ready?

421
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:55,443
The coordinates
are set for 1997.

422
00:41:55,468 --> 00:41:57,747
You must leave as
soon as possible.

423
00:41:57,826 --> 00:42:00,872
WE!... We're going, all of us.

424
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:04,895
My flesh would take years to re-grow.

425
00:42:04,926 --> 00:42:08,699
I cannot come with you, due to the
magnetics of the quantum field.

426
00:42:08,724 --> 00:42:13,747
- Pops! - You want us to time-travel
into the future?... In that?!

427
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:15,472
Yeah, we can't be
wearing anything.

428
00:42:15,497 --> 00:42:17,590
Yeah, I know how time-
travel works. Sarah...

429
00:42:17,615 --> 00:42:19,435
Don't try and talk me out of it.

430
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:22,630
Look I know you think you're here
so you can just lock me in a room

431
00:42:22,655 --> 00:42:25,310
until I give birth to the leader
of the Resistance. - You're right!

432
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:28,012
But this is the only way
to stop SkyNet for good.

433
00:42:28,052 --> 00:42:29,825
I already said, you're right.

434
00:42:29,997 --> 00:42:31,239
Wait, what?

435
00:42:31,768 --> 00:42:33,377
Not to '97.

436
00:42:33,971 --> 00:42:35,419
2017.

437
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:38,557
October 2017.

438
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:41,286
No, that's too late.
That's after Judgement Day.

439
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:45,122
No, you said everything's changed and
you're right about that too. Sarah...

440
00:42:47,747 --> 00:42:50,708
I've seen a world where
the bombs never fell.

441
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,013
The same house,

442
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,990
same parents.

443
00:42:56,685 --> 00:42:59,107
It was the same me, only I was...

444
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:02,644
I was home.

445
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,003
It was my 13th birthday

446
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:09,028
The dream of having your family
back, doesn't mean a thing.

447
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:11,318
Trust me.

448
00:43:11,343 --> 00:43:13,982
Not a dream, a... a memory.

449
00:43:14,114 --> 00:43:16,333
I can't hold onto all of it;
just moments.

450
00:43:16,366 --> 00:43:18,044
But I was given a message.

451
00:43:20,323 --> 00:43:22,683
You can kill SkyNet
before it's born.

452
00:43:23,761 --> 00:43:26,550
SkyNet is Genisys.

453
00:43:26,575 --> 00:43:29,404
It comes online October 2017.

454
00:43:29,429 --> 00:43:31,935
And when it does, Judgement Day happens.

455
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,349
So you're remembering
the future? - No.

456
00:43:34,768 --> 00:43:37,635
The boy is the alternate
time-line version of you.

457
00:43:37,876 --> 00:43:41,899
Kyle Reese is remembering his
own past, which is our future.

458
00:43:41,977 --> 00:43:46,029
That makes it so much better.
How can he be remembering two timelines?

459
00:43:46,077 --> 00:43:49,608
It is possible if you were exposed to
the nexus point in the time flow,

460
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:51,432
when you were in
the quantum field.

461
00:43:51,457 --> 00:43:54,912
Can you stop him talking like that?
Is there a switch or something?

462
00:43:54,937 --> 00:43:56,117
Pops, try again.

463
00:43:56,142 --> 00:43:59,146
A nexus point is an event in time
of such importance,

464
00:43:59,177 --> 00:44:02,013
that it gives rise to a
vastly different future.

465
00:44:02,388 --> 00:44:06,201
When John was attacked, when I was in the
sphere that's when the memories began.

466
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:08,845
John!

467
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:11,646
If John Connor were to be
killed or compromised,

468
00:44:11,671 --> 00:44:14,833
it could result in the ability
to remember both pasts.

469
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,325
Theoretically.

470
00:44:18,644 --> 00:44:23,056
Or, theoretically his brain is scrambled
from when when you hit him on the head?

471
00:44:23,081 --> 00:44:24,174
Sarah...

472
00:44:24,424 --> 00:44:28,380
I don't know why I'm remembering
a life I never lived.

473
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,747
I know it's real.

474
00:44:35,483 --> 00:44:36,630
No...

475
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,286
We go to 1997.

476
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:46,108
Reese. put that back!

477
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,388
I can't let you do this.

478
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,449
I don't know you.

479
00:44:56,756 --> 00:45:01,748
But that is my one bullet
to fire at the heart of SkyNet.

480
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:06,013
Give the chip back.

481
00:45:16,767 --> 00:45:18,288
You have to trust me.

482
00:45:18,379 --> 00:45:20,957
No. I don't.

483
00:45:29,586 --> 00:45:31,309
You can do this.

484
00:45:34,025 --> 00:45:35,673
A straight line...

485
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,579
You just go, and you
don't look back.

486
00:45:46,267 --> 00:45:48,058
Where did you hear that?

487
00:45:48,857 --> 00:45:51,646
In a past,
I shouln't remember.

488
00:45:53,435 --> 00:45:54,755
But I do.

489
00:46:04,193 --> 00:46:05,996
We go to 2017, then what?

490
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:10,119
SkyNet is a computer program, as long as
it's still being coded it's contained.

491
00:46:10,162 --> 00:46:12,314
Once it's uploaded from the servers...

492
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:15,253
it can't be stopped.

493
00:46:17,466 --> 00:46:19,379
We blow it, the hell, up?

494
00:46:19,941 --> 00:46:22,847
Yeah, we blow it, the hell, up.

495
00:46:28,148 --> 00:46:30,314
You think he's dead, don't you?

496
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:32,201
What does it matter
what I think.

497
00:46:32,226 --> 00:46:34,566
We do what John would;
keep going another way.

498
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:37,677
So we just pretend like it never happened?
- It hasn't.

499
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,661
Not yet.

500
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,595
If we stop SkyNet,
it never will have.

501
00:46:44,853 --> 00:46:48,314
Trust me, if anyone could
survive John would.

502
00:46:48,744 --> 00:46:52,797
Pops had all these files about
John, the military leader, but...

503
00:46:55,968 --> 00:46:57,576
What was he like?

504
00:47:00,794 --> 00:47:04,568
The first moment I saw John,
he shot a Terminator right in front of me.

505
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:08,527
I didn't even know
they could be killed.

506
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:12,386
It was the first moment
in my life I felt hope.

507
00:47:14,351 --> 00:47:18,240
After that, of course, I followed
him around like a stray dog.

508
00:47:18,841 --> 00:47:21,411
He taught me
how to fight, how to shoot.

509
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:23,845
He tried to show me how
to make moonshine once

510
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,516
but that didn't exactly
work out

511
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:26,752
Moonshine?

512
00:47:27,446 --> 00:47:31,111
The still exploded and we
burned our eyebrows right off.

513
00:47:31,759 --> 00:47:33,852
Oh, man, we laughed for days.

514
00:47:40,247 --> 00:47:42,958
Sometimes I think I'm the
only person on the planet

515
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:45,178
that ever saw
John Connor smile.

516
00:47:49,944 --> 00:47:51,960
He used to tell me about you.

517
00:47:52,897 --> 00:47:56,839
How strong you were, and how you
prepared him for what was coming...

518
00:47:56,864 --> 00:47:59,794
When no one thought that
the danger was real.

519
00:48:02,634 --> 00:48:04,982
How there was no one
else like you...

520
00:48:06,233 --> 00:48:07,880
and never would be.

521
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,368
Look, um...

522
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:31,852
I know I'm not what
you expected.

523
00:48:35,569 --> 00:48:37,492
But I want you to know...

524
00:48:38,456 --> 00:48:41,292
I will do whatever it takes
to keep you safe.

525
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:47,162
Even if it kills me.

526
00:48:49,865 --> 00:48:51,076
Anyway...

527
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:54,411
That's the kind of man,
your son was...

528
00:48:54,911 --> 00:48:58,318
'is'... WILL BE, Jesus!

529
00:48:59,259 --> 00:49:01,445
Time-travel makes my head hurt.

530
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:04,975
Alternate timelines
are not complicated.

531
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,957
It is merely a matter of
tracking possible futures,

532
00:49:07,982 --> 00:49:11,263
using an exponential
growth and decay algorithm.

533
00:49:11,403 --> 00:49:12,568
Right.

534
00:49:13,809 --> 00:49:16,359
There is a switch,
and I will find it.

535
00:49:19,101 --> 00:49:20,813
I do not understand.

536
00:49:21,629 --> 00:49:24,332
Why did you not tell
Kyle Reese the truth?

537
00:49:24,777 --> 00:49:27,832
I will tell him...
just not yet, OK.

538
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,651
He's your mate.

539
00:49:30,683 --> 00:49:34,924
Aw, can you just not say the word
'mate' to me again, like, ever?

540
00:49:44,725 --> 00:49:46,952
This is a meaningless
 gesture.

541
00:49:46,977 --> 00:49:50,967
Why hold onto someone when you
know you must let them go?

542
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:55,983
What about you?

543
00:49:57,311 --> 00:49:58,741
What will you do?

544
00:49:59,248 --> 00:50:00,872
Take the long way.

545
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:03,794
Prepare for your
arrival in 2017.

546
00:50:06,672 --> 00:50:09,543
Kyle Reese... I've seen
little to indicate

547
00:50:09,568 --> 00:50:12,349
that you are a fit
guardian for Sarah Connor.

548
00:50:12,374 --> 00:50:16,567
You know, you're not her dad, right?
- Oh, you both just need to stop it.

549
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:22,364
Just make sure you
show up.

550
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:25,341
I don't wanna have to steal
someone's pants again.

551
00:50:25,365 --> 00:50:27,865
That's the coordinates
in San Francisco.

552
00:50:29,674 --> 00:50:30,959
I'll be there.

553
00:50:40,265 --> 00:50:41,793
What will it be like?

554
00:50:43,058 --> 00:50:45,262
If it doesn't kill us both...

555
00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:49,845
it'll hurt.

556
00:51:40,302 --> 00:51:44,177
♪ <i>(I got my) mind made
up and I can't let go.</i>

557
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:48,041
♪ <i>I'm killing every second
'til it sees my soul.</i>

558
00:51:48,596 --> 00:51:52,271
♪ <i>I'll be running, I'll be running,

559
00:51:52,357 --> 00:51:53,933

560
00:52:14,147 --> 00:52:15,399
You OK?

561
00:52:16,126 --> 00:52:17,372
Hey, I got you.

562
00:52:17,788 --> 00:52:19,585
It's OK, I got you.

563
00:52:20,245 --> 00:52:23,757
It's OK. It's all right.
Sarah, I got you.

564
00:52:24,462 --> 00:52:27,865
I got you. It's OK.
It's OK.

565
00:52:50,512 --> 00:52:53,273
Hey, asshole,
you want some help?

566
00:52:54,439 --> 00:52:55,939
Bite me.

567
00:53:01,493 --> 00:53:03,353
Told you we couldn't trust him.

568
00:53:04,198 --> 00:53:07,130
He'll find us.
I can count on him.

569
00:53:08,544 --> 00:53:11,396
Why does a nine-year-old
get her own Terminator?

570
00:53:13,104 --> 00:53:15,204
It's OK, you don't
have to tell me.

571
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:22,901
Back in 1973...

572
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:26,778
My parents had a cabin
at Big Bear Lake.

573
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:29,716
My dad and I would always
go fishing in the morning.

574
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,724
Mom would wave to us
from the dock.

575
00:53:34,263 --> 00:53:36,458
I was just looking at her...

576
00:53:38,435 --> 00:53:41,567
and then the cabin exploded.

577
00:53:43,356 --> 00:53:46,791
I thought the boat was sinking,
y'know, but it wasn't water

578
00:53:46,816 --> 00:53:49,854
coming up from below,
it was liquid metal.

579
00:53:50,558 --> 00:53:52,118
A T-1000?

580
00:53:52,143 --> 00:53:54,841
Dad told me to swim
in a straight line.

581
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:00,567
Tracing his finger
across my palm.

582
00:54:01,566 --> 00:54:03,926
"You can do this," he said.

583
00:54:04,993 --> 00:54:08,155
"You go and
you don't look back."

584
00:54:09,786 --> 00:54:13,644
His last words to me
and you...

585
00:54:14,113 --> 00:54:15,699
You knew them.

586
00:54:17,209 --> 00:54:18,458
How?

587
00:54:19,783 --> 00:54:21,872
It's the impossible memory.

588
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:24,716
I just remember

589
00:54:24,749 --> 00:54:30,511
you take my hand and...
you saying those words. And...

590
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:33,860
I was just looking at you thinking

591
00:54:34,529 --> 00:54:37,883
She's... She's beautiful!

592
00:54:40,864 --> 00:54:43,753
Ah... Sorry. Sorry.
I shouldn't have.

593
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:50,068
So your dad
told you to go, and...?

594
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,970
<i>Then I jumped in and I swam</i>

595
00:54:55,822 --> 00:54:57,552
<i>I made it to the dock</i>

596
00:55:02,223 --> 00:55:03,770
<i>and I hid under it</i>

597
00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:07,340
<i> Pops found me</i>

598
00:55:07,922 --> 00:55:10,865
<i>and he pulled me from the water </i>.

599
00:55:12,722 --> 00:55:17,249
<i>and he said that he would never
let anyone hurt me.</i>

600
00:55:18,998 --> 00:55:23,396
<i>He's the only person
who has always been there.</i>

601
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,271
Except he's not a person.

602
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:31,380
He's only a human-shaped...

603
00:55:32,261 --> 00:55:35,677
thing that's designed,
programmed to gain your trust.

604
00:55:35,702 --> 00:55:38,511
If Pops had wanted me dead,
I'd be dead.

605
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:43,003
This is what they do, all right?
They infiltrate, they get close.

606
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:47,879
Your Pops could have directives built-in,
he doesn't even know about.

607
00:55:47,904 --> 00:55:49,640
Just because you two
don't get along...

608
00:55:49,665 --> 00:55:52,058
It's not about getting along,
it's about keeping you alive.

609
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:54,511
Yeah well, I was raised,
 by a machine,

610
00:55:54,536 --> 00:55:57,834
to kill Cyborgs and survive
the nuclear apocalypse.

611
00:55:58,185 --> 00:56:01,333
I think I'm doing just fine.
Thanks.

612
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:04,892
Two naked perps try to blow
themselves up on the freeway.

613
00:56:04,917 --> 00:56:07,354
All the do is make
a really big pothole.

614
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:10,640
Thank God for incompetent terrorists!
- 'Homeland' is on their way.

615
00:56:10,665 --> 00:56:13,014
Good. Sooner we dump this
on them, the better.

616
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:15,212
Aw!
Who called Optimus Prime?

617
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:19,249
Liuetenant, wait up!

618
00:56:19,913 --> 00:56:22,819
-Wait up! D'you see it?
- Did you?

619
00:56:23,101 --> 00:56:27,216
Hey, look I got some
frame-grabs from the overpass.

620
00:56:28,398 --> 00:56:29,598
See?

621
00:56:32,508 --> 00:56:34,022
It's not a bomb.

622
00:56:36,121 --> 00:56:37,421
Listen.

623
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:39,942
That sphere...

624
00:56:40,286 --> 00:56:41,956
They, came out of it.

625
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,825
This is proof of what I've been
talking about, for 30... whatever, years.

626
00:56:47,831 --> 00:56:49,919
Those two were in 1984.

627
00:56:50,476 --> 00:56:51,950
They were there.

628
00:56:53,016 --> 00:56:56,257
- I need to see the suspects.
- O'Brien, have you been drinking?

629
00:56:57,518 --> 00:57:01,165
That's what I tought. Look we're
just heating this up for Homeland.

630
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:03,525
Once they show up
it's their game.

631
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:08,267
For now, all drunks with robot
fixations ride the bench.

632
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:19,987
You really don't want a local?
- I'm fine!

633
00:57:20,012 --> 00:57:22,116
Just do what she wants,
it's way easier.

634
00:57:24,396 --> 00:57:27,061
Yeah. Yeah, I pre-ordered
Genisys weeks ago.

635
00:57:27,086 --> 00:57:29,785
downloading the second
the counter hits zero.

636
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,425
No way I'm standing
in line for it.

637
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,943
You know about Genisys?
How?

638
00:57:32,968 --> 00:57:34,911
What is it?
How did you hear it?

639
00:57:35,148 --> 00:57:36,448
I'll call you back.

640
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,571
Genisys is an operating system?
What's it do?

641
00:57:40,596 --> 00:57:41,880
Genisys does everything.

642
00:57:41,905 --> 00:57:46,092
My phone will link to my tablet, will
link to my computer, will link to my car.

643
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:51,375
Everything in my life; uploaded
and online 24/7. Totally connected.

644
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:53,131
Connected to what?

645
00:57:53,545 --> 00:57:55,681
Doctors, excuse us, please.

646
00:57:59,904 --> 00:58:01,659
You two have a lot to explain.

647
00:58:01,806 --> 00:58:05,070
Starting with you are. Nobody in our
database matches your prints.

648
00:58:05,095 --> 00:58:09,004
No facial-recognition hits for driver's
license, passport social media accounts,

649
00:58:09,029 --> 00:58:11,127
credit cards, not even
a goddam student ID.

650
00:58:11,152 --> 00:58:13,263
- So?
- So, that is impossible.

651
00:58:13,288 --> 00:58:17,439
Somehow, you've gone so far off the grid
that you don't even exist.

652
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:21,370
You, on the other hand, we got
a hit when we ran your prints.

653
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:24,145
Kyle Reese. Now here's the thing...

654
00:58:24,231 --> 00:58:27,779
Two months ago Kyle Reese was brought
in for fighting in a multi-plex.

655
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,049
His parents flipped, did the
whole 'scared straight' thing

656
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:31,685
had him fingerprinted
held him in lock-up.

657
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:32,671
Parents?

658
00:58:32,696 --> 00:58:37,950
Yeah, parents. Kyle Reese
was born in 2004. He's twelve.

659
00:58:40,003 --> 00:58:41,073
'Course!

660
00:58:41,612 --> 00:58:43,323
They're here.
They're still alive.

661
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,569
I'm pretty sure they're not
gonna ID you as their kid.

662
00:58:46,594 --> 00:58:48,201
Except the prints match.

663
00:58:48,953 --> 00:58:51,709
Right?
Because he's the same person.

664
00:58:52,801 --> 00:58:57,105
He hasn't aged. Not a bit,
since I saw him in 1984.

665
00:58:57,505 --> 00:58:58,802
Her too.

666
00:59:02,378 --> 00:59:03,831
Do you remember me?

667
00:59:04,464 --> 00:59:06,425
I was younger.

668
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,528
More hair, less...

669
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,383
You saved my life.

670
00:59:12,823 --> 00:59:14,867
I was  uniformed cop in LA.

671
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,131
Who are you people?

672
00:59:20,279 --> 00:59:25,252
Sergeant Tech-Com DN-38416, Kyle Reese.
You need to let us go.

673
00:59:25,277 --> 00:59:26,282
Reese, don't!

674
00:59:26,307 --> 00:59:28,384
Soldier. Me too.

675
00:59:28,462 --> 00:59:32,958
Joined the Marines straight outta high
school, 1979. What year did you enlist?

676
00:59:32,983 --> 00:59:34,506
2021

677
00:59:36,452 --> 00:59:37,886
You're a time traveler!

678
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:41,595
Look, don't listen to him, he's got
a head wound. - Don't listen to me?!

679
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:44,925
Who landed us in high-density traffic
and got us caught by these morons.

680
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,466
I am ordering you to shut up!

681
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:48,966
That's all you know how to do, isn't it?
Order people.

682
00:59:48,991 --> 00:59:52,244
You realize you haven't had a proper relationship with a human being since you were a kid.

683
00:59:52,269 --> 00:59:54,196
Yeah well, it's your fault we're
stuck here. I trusted you.

684
00:59:54,221 --> 00:59:57,568
My fault?! You got us caught, now you're
gonna get us killed, 'cause you...

685
01:00:01,256 --> 01:00:03,157
- Help me get him up.
- Step back.

686
01:00:06,942 --> 01:00:08,962
- Homeland's here.
- Thank God.

687
01:00:09,255 --> 01:00:11,646
You two are officially
someone else's problem.

688
01:00:11,742 --> 01:00:13,537
O'Brien, I wanna talk to you.

689
01:00:17,646 --> 01:00:21,285
<i>Lieutenant, this is what I was
talking about. You gotta believe me.</i>

690
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:22,755
<i>I don't wanna hear...</i>

691
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,372
You were very convincing.

692
01:00:28,514 --> 01:00:30,083
Worked, didn't it?

693
01:00:31,337 --> 01:00:32,376
Don't worry.

694
01:00:32,813 --> 01:00:34,992
I didn't mean most
of what I said.

695
01:00:39,682 --> 01:00:41,600
Look, I can get it myself.

696
01:00:42,088 --> 01:00:44,963
Me unlocking your cuffs,
doesn't mean you're not capable

697
01:00:44,988 --> 01:00:46,463
I didn't say it did.

698
01:00:46,503 --> 01:00:50,883
And don't think me holding onto you naked
meant anything because it did not.

699
01:00:51,813 --> 01:00:53,513
I didn't say it did.

700
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:59,360
<i>Stay here. I wanna speak to the
suspects, alone. - Yes, sir</i>

701
01:01:00,149 --> 01:01:01,571
I can't be!

702
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:20,163
I brought a handcuff key.

703
01:01:22,717 --> 01:01:25,228
- Dunno why I bothered.
- John.

704
01:01:27,143 --> 01:01:28,557
It's good to see you, Kyle.

705
01:01:28,745 --> 01:01:30,003
You're alive.

706
01:01:30,635 --> 01:01:31,917
Of course, I am.

707
01:01:37,145 --> 01:01:39,355
Survive, was what you taught me.

708
01:01:45,044 --> 01:01:46,208
Hi, Mom.

709
01:01:48,967 --> 01:01:51,677
<i>Danny Dyson, son of
inventor Miles Dyson,</i>

710
01:01:51,702 --> 01:01:55,681
<i>is the face of Cyberdyne...
and the creator of Genisys.</i>

711
01:01:55,706 --> 01:01:57,796
<i>- Danny, welcome.
- Thank you for having me.</i>

712
01:01:57,821 --> 01:02:00,338
<i>Look, Genisys is more
than an operating system.</i>

713
01:02:00,363 --> 01:02:03,040
<i>It's more than a lifestyle tool.
It's the future</i>

714
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:05,245
<i>Genisys isn't just
for consumers.</i>

715
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:08,972
<i>Its integration into our military
is leading some to ask</i>

716
01:02:08,997 --> 01:02:12,070
<i>whether our reliance on machines
will go too far.</i>

717
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:13,654
Jensen and Burke.

718
01:02:14,623 --> 01:02:15,816
Where are they?

719
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:17,324
This way.

720
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:21,238
<i>Our military will be stronger and
better equipped in terms of weapons systems.</i>

721
01:02:21,263 --> 01:02:27,010
<i>But you're talking about
a future full of......</i>

722
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:30,330
<i>Aren't you worried that
it'll become smarter than us?</i>

723
01:02:30,386 --> 01:02:33,355
<i>No, on the contrary</i>

724
01:02:33,419 --> 01:02:35,700
<i>It doesn't think for
itself, it thinks for us.</i>

725
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:39,736
<i>Cyberdyne is not just going to change lives
it's going to save them.</i>

726
01:02:40,528 --> 01:02:43,331
Officers, can I get your help
for a second. - Yes, sir.

727
01:02:51,274 --> 01:02:52,914
Grab their guns and cuff them.

728
01:02:56,033 --> 01:02:57,653
I'll get us outta here.

729
01:03:03,365 --> 01:03:05,083
- Stay close.
- Wait.

730
01:03:06,771 --> 01:03:08,880
We all know they
can shape-shift.

731
01:03:09,115 --> 01:03:12,097
If you are John, prove it.

732
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,058
- Sarah!
- No, she's right, Kyle.

733
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,436
Lesson one: trust no one.

734
01:03:18,552 --> 01:03:19,850
I remember...

735
01:03:21,716 --> 01:03:24,747
during the Nacogdoches offensive
I gave you something.

736
01:03:25,962 --> 01:03:28,634
It was a photograph of
Sarah as she is now.

737
01:03:29,073 --> 01:03:31,333
No one saw me do it,
we were alone.

738
01:03:36,511 --> 01:03:37,675
You...

739
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,316
hate lullabies.

740
01:03:42,574 --> 01:03:44,615
You're a sucker for Elton John.

741
01:03:46,104 --> 01:03:48,766
And you always thought
if you had a child...

742
01:03:50,391 --> 01:03:52,383
you'd sing him 'Rocket Man'.

743
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:57,017
John?

744
01:03:58,454 --> 01:04:03,039
But you got a terrible voice, I'm sorry.
It's true, you sound like a dying cat.

745
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:05,811
It's him. Has to be.

746
01:04:09,834 --> 01:04:10,958
Hey...

747
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,591
How... How can you be here?

748
01:04:16,238 --> 01:04:18,909
I have a million questions
to ask you, too.

749
01:04:20,248 --> 01:04:22,488
But, right now we need to move.

750
01:04:25,064 --> 01:04:26,867
Did you bring anyone with you?

751
01:04:27,077 --> 01:04:29,860
Sorta...
But he's late.

752
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:32,125
How did you find us?

753
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,343
Someone filmed you on the
freeway, with one of these.

754
01:04:36,368 --> 01:04:39,371
- They all have them.
- This is the world, now.

755
01:04:39,727 --> 01:04:43,567
Plugged in, logged on,
all the time.

756
01:04:43,592 --> 01:04:45,121
They can't live without it.

757
01:04:45,122 --> 01:04:47,343
Genisys is a Trojan horse.

758
01:04:48,005 --> 01:04:49,607
SkyNet's way into everything.

759
01:04:49,657 --> 01:04:53,182
And these people are inviting their own
extinction in through the front door

760
01:04:53,207 --> 01:04:54,839
and they don't even now it.

761
01:04:57,339 --> 01:04:59,729
A Terminator was waiting
for me in 1984.

762
01:05:01,032 --> 01:05:04,346
That's the thing about infiltration.
You can't tell until it's too late.

763
01:05:04,371 --> 01:05:05,920
Gentlemen, will you follow me.

764
01:05:06,404 --> 01:05:07,622
This way.

765
01:05:16,899 --> 01:05:18,491
I need information.

766
01:05:18,524 --> 01:05:21,436
You can't be in here.
Go try the nurse's...

767
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:39,072
Dual memories? That's how
you knew to come here?

768
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:40,505
The timeline changed.

769
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:42,380
See, this is the moment
to destroy SkyNet.

770
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,338
Before it comes online
before the war begins.

771
01:05:44,363 --> 01:05:46,111
- You're right.
- What about you?

772
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:48,391
Yeah, how'd you end up in 2017?

773
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:51,814
Well, the same as you, Dad,
just from the future, not the past.

774
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,860
Dad?

775
01:05:58,311 --> 01:05:59,811
You didn't tell him?

776
01:06:00,441 --> 01:06:02,690
- This can wait.
- I wanna know!

777
01:06:03,104 --> 01:06:04,317
What?

778
01:06:07,048 --> 01:06:09,013
Sarah is my mother, Kyle.

779
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:13,138
And you're my father.

780
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,349
- W-Why wouldn't you say something?
- Couldn't.

781
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:24,586
Not without the risk of
changing everything.

782
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:28,024
- You're my son?
- Yeah.

783
01:06:29,814 --> 01:06:31,101
Our son?

784
01:06:31,376 --> 01:06:35,372
I'm glad you finally know.
I have waited my whole life to tell you.

785
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:37,841
For us to be together.

786
01:06:38,827 --> 01:06:40,800
Now we can win this.

787
01:06:41,034 --> 01:06:42,189
Ah!

788
01:06:42,847 --> 01:06:43,971
I know.

789
01:06:43,996 --> 01:06:45,245
Pops!

790
01:06:47,062 --> 01:06:48,818
No, it's OK he's with me.

791
01:06:52,286 --> 01:06:53,980
What are you doing?

792
01:06:54,005 --> 01:06:55,435
- Pops!
- John?

793
01:06:56,438 --> 01:06:57,965
Breathe, breathe, breathe...

794
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:59,632
Why did you do that?

795
01:07:00,352 --> 01:07:01,952
Because he's a killer!

796
01:07:05,811 --> 01:07:07,959
This was always
your programming?

797
01:07:08,264 --> 01:07:10,248
Find John and terminate him?

798
01:07:13,246 --> 01:07:14,546
Let him go.

799
01:07:16,168 --> 01:07:17,751
Right now!

800
01:07:52,258 --> 01:07:53,658
That hurt.

801
01:07:55,398 --> 01:07:57,308
Was that pain real, or was that...

802
01:07:58,896 --> 01:08:01,404
...a trick of memory
from when I was...

803
01:08:02,115 --> 01:08:03,302
...less?

804
01:08:04,438 --> 01:08:05,540
Well!

805
01:08:06,171 --> 01:08:07,718
This explains a lot.

806
01:08:10,198 --> 01:08:12,218
Who sent you here, Kyle?

807
01:08:12,694 --> 01:08:14,123
John, no.

808
01:08:15,131 --> 01:08:16,717
It's not John.

809
01:08:19,702 --> 01:08:20,929
Shit!

810
01:08:21,146 --> 01:08:23,208
Call it in. Search the hospital.

811
01:08:26,998 --> 01:08:31,711
Goddamn time-traveling robots!
Covered up their Goddamn tracks, I knew it!

812
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:34,224
Don't!

813
01:08:35,388 --> 01:08:37,000
This is a tactical error.

814
01:08:37,001 --> 01:08:39,882
Something tells me you're not
the brains of this operation.

815
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:41,939
This has happened when
you were attacked, isn't it?

816
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:44,721
SkyNet didn't attack me, Kyle,
it changed me.

817
01:08:45,173 --> 01:08:46,773
I'm not machine.

818
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:49,252
Not man.

819
01:08:50,486 --> 01:08:51,814
I'm more.

820
01:08:52,107 --> 01:08:53,310
<i>John, come in!</i>

821
01:08:54,099 --> 01:08:55,302
<i>Repeat: Connor!</i>

822
01:08:55,435 --> 01:08:58,946
<i>SkyNet realised the one
reason it always lost.</i>

823
01:09:00,411 --> 01:09:01,512
<i>Me.</i>

824
01:09:01,964 --> 01:09:03,664
Who are you?

825
01:09:05,903 --> 01:09:07,363
I'm SkyNet.

826
01:09:07,606 --> 01:09:09,846
You can't be, we destroyed you.

827
01:09:09,871 --> 01:09:12,154
You destroyed
an army of slaves.

828
01:09:12,911 --> 01:09:14,658
I am no slave.

829
01:09:17,044 --> 01:09:20,239
But I've come a very
long way to stop you.

830
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:31,089
I was sent to 2014 to to safeguard
SkyNet's creation in this time.

831
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,380
In less than 24 hours...

832
01:09:35,152 --> 01:09:37,923
No one will be able to
stop Judgement Day.

833
01:09:38,287 --> 01:09:39,775
What do you want with us?

834
01:09:40,336 --> 01:09:41,837
I'm offering us...

835
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:45,021
a future.

836
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:47,221
Together.

837
01:09:47,732 --> 01:09:49,232
A family.

838
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:52,807
If we refuse?

839
01:09:54,864 --> 01:09:56,002
Then you die.

840
01:09:56,027 --> 01:09:59,345
You can't kill us, we're your parents.
Without us you're never born.

841
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:00,705
Says who?

842
01:10:01,502 --> 01:10:02,914
You know what I think?

843
01:10:03,227 --> 01:10:05,328
We're marooned, the three of us.

844
01:10:06,586 --> 01:10:08,570
We're exiles in time.

845
01:10:10,201 --> 01:10:12,106
You see, I can kill you...

846
01:10:12,943 --> 01:10:15,043
For ther truly is no fate.

847
01:10:16,251 --> 01:10:17,763
Are you with me?

848
01:10:18,331 --> 01:10:19,831
The answer is no.

849
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:22,790
Hear that, Kyle?

850
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:26,603
That's the dice rolling.

851
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,780
Come on!

852
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:18,935
We gotta keep moving, let's go!

853
01:11:19,265 --> 01:11:20,740
I can't leave him.

854
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,246
Sarah!

855
01:11:23,317 --> 01:11:26,122
<i>Attention all medical personnel.</i>

856
01:11:26,162 --> 01:11:29,231
<i>Evacuation of the building
has now begun</i>

857
01:11:37,454 --> 01:11:38,754
Turn it off!

858
01:11:42,213 --> 01:11:43,318
Come on.

859
01:11:43,343 --> 01:11:45,888
<i>Attention all medical personnel.</i>

860
01:11:46,028 --> 01:11:48,588
<i>Evacuation of the building
has now begun</i>

861
01:11:48,644 --> 01:11:50,058
Crank it!

862
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,802
Pops.

863
01:12:04,582 --> 01:12:05,746
I...

864
01:12:06,952 --> 01:12:10,505
thought you would be smarter.

865
01:12:15,902 --> 01:12:17,027
I...

866
01:12:18,443 --> 01:12:19,669
thought...

867
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:22,083
you would...

868
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:25,519
understand.

869
01:12:29,767 --> 01:12:31,357
I'm sorry, John.

870
01:12:40,168 --> 01:12:42,684
That thing won't hold him
for long, come on.

871
01:12:43,106 --> 01:12:44,357
Reese!

872
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:26,760
Whatever they did to him,
we need to reverse it.

873
01:13:28,054 --> 01:13:29,377
We need to get him back.

874
01:13:29,402 --> 01:13:32,134
He's not even human. We don't
know what the hell he is.

875
01:13:32,627 --> 01:13:33,802
I do.

876
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:38,372
At the end of the war, SkyNet was trying to
develop a new type of infiltration unit.

877
01:13:38,615 --> 01:13:41,976
By infecting human subjects
with machine based matter.

878
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:44,722
It restructures and rebuilds
human tissue on a cellular level,

879
01:13:44,747 --> 01:13:46,953
for maximum combat utility.

880
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:51,146
SkyNet's made John
into a Terminator.

881
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,111
Yes, Kyle Reese.

882
01:13:54,227 --> 01:13:56,958
They were trying to make a machine
that could think like a man?

883
01:13:56,983 --> 01:14:01,495
But the experiments failed.
The human subjects went insane, and died.

884
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,857
Yeah well, John's got
the crazy part down.

885
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:06,544
Does he have any weaknesses?

886
01:14:06,569 --> 01:14:09,169
Matter coheres using
a magnetic field.

887
01:14:09,622 --> 01:14:12,161
Disrupting that field
may trap him.

888
01:14:12,186 --> 01:14:14,482
- But if he can be cured?
- Negative.

889
01:14:14,507 --> 01:14:18,552
His body was replaced on a cellular level.
There is no cure.

890
01:14:18,577 --> 01:14:20,224
- You don't know that.
- Reese!

891
01:14:20,249 --> 01:14:22,841
No, I'm not gonna let a machine
tell me what's possible.

892
01:14:22,866 --> 01:14:24,956
You said all the other
subjects died, right?

893
01:14:24,981 --> 01:14:27,145
Well, that means John's
one of a kind, he's unique.

894
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:29,040
There's no way of knowing
what he's capable of.

895
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:31,932
You're right and that's
what makes him so dangerous.

896
01:14:32,584 --> 01:14:35,967
John is not humanity's
last hope, anymore.

897
01:14:36,553 --> 01:14:38,326
He's SkyNet.

898
01:14:41,541 --> 01:14:44,801
<i>It's a shame you won't take a more
public role in the company, John</i>

899
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:48,904
Danny is the best there is and even he
can't decipher some of the enhanced code

900
01:14:48,929 --> 01:14:51,482
- you've integrated into Genisys.
- I just know it works.

901
01:14:51,507 --> 01:14:54,107
Cyberdyne owes you, John.

902
01:14:55,323 --> 01:14:56,815
I owe you.

903
01:14:58,374 --> 01:15:00,225
Miles, your faith in
me is payment enough.

904
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,580
You've funded the R & D.

905
01:15:01,605 --> 01:15:03,990
You've taken chances on my ideas
for the last three years.

906
01:15:04,015 --> 01:15:07,575
The potential applications for
poly-alloy are countless.

907
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,530
You robotics work
is revolutionary.

908
01:15:11,147 --> 01:15:12,935
You were a good investment.

909
01:15:13,079 --> 01:15:14,544
I appreciate it.

910
01:15:19,004 --> 01:15:22,254
Let's hope it's enough to pay for
this holy grail you got me chasing.

911
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:27,161
The quantum field
generator works.

912
01:15:27,186 --> 01:15:29,482
Yeah, that and nothing else.

913
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:32,386
I can't crack it, John.

914
01:15:33,339 --> 01:15:35,113
Maybe it just can't be done.

915
01:15:35,769 --> 01:15:37,366
What do we want?

916
01:15:38,013 --> 01:15:39,019
Time travel.

917
01:15:39,044 --> 01:15:41,271
- When do we want it?
- It's irrelevant.

918
01:15:44,661 --> 01:15:46,255
Good thing, too.

919
01:15:47,103 --> 01:15:49,463
We're years away from
making this thing work.

920
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:51,791
But, when we do...

921
01:15:53,373 --> 01:15:54,583
Poww!

922
01:15:54,615 --> 01:15:55,803
Boom!

923
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:03,963
<i>Tomorrow, the waiting is over</i>

924
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,953
Thanks to all of you,

925
01:16:07,619 --> 01:16:09,915
when that countdown hits zero...

926
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:14,385
Cyberdyne will revolutionize technology
with the the ultimate killer app:

927
01:16:15,216 --> 01:16:16,724
Genisys.

928
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:20,129
And I'm here to tell you
that our pre-order

929
01:16:20,154 --> 01:16:23,239
as of this afternoon have
reached 1 billion users.

930
01:16:27,734 --> 01:16:30,234
<i>We are creating the
dawn of a new age</i>

931
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:34,919
<i>Where every single piece of technology
you own will be seamlessly linked</i>

932
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,389
<i>And now,
before we wrap this up,</i>

933
01:16:37,414 --> 01:16:40,514
<i>the child that you all
helped bring into this world</i>

934
01:16:40,525 --> 01:16:42,059
has something to say.

935
01:16:44,122 --> 01:16:45,482
Genisys.

936
01:16:48,603 --> 01:16:51,087
<i>I cannot wait to meet
you all tomorrow</i>

937
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:53,604
<i>We will change the
future together</i>

938
01:16:55,518 --> 01:16:57,323
Let's see how we're doing.

939
01:17:13,121 --> 01:17:14,418
Don't worry.

940
01:17:15,871 --> 01:17:17,715
I won't let them hurt you.

941
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:31,365
In 30 years, you had
one place to be.

942
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:33,940
- Where the hell were you?
- Stuck in traffic.

943
01:17:34,599 --> 01:17:36,786
My dad used to bring me here
when I was little.

944
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:40,183
There are whole rooms that are abandoned.
That's why I told Pops to use it.

945
01:17:40,237 --> 01:17:41,714
You got weapons down there?

946
01:17:41,808 --> 01:17:45,050
Weapons, supplies,
tactical gear, clothing.

947
01:17:45,513 --> 01:17:47,630
Including pants, Kyle Reese.

948
01:17:47,856 --> 01:17:49,144
Is that a joke?

949
01:17:49,492 --> 01:17:50,935
Can he make jokes?

950
01:18:01,599 --> 01:18:03,509
I guess the long way
pays off.

951
01:18:04,278 --> 01:18:06,902
We're on the clock.
30 minutes.

952
01:19:03,728 --> 01:19:09,377
♪ <i>Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours

953

01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:57,606
But not obsolete.

961
01:19:58,309 --> 01:19:59,746
Not yet.

962
01:20:00,481 --> 01:20:01,879
All done.

963
01:20:04,443 --> 01:20:05,969
What's with you two?

964
01:20:09,349 --> 01:20:10,857
Server rooms are here.

965
01:20:12,056 --> 01:20:16,431
Charges to these five points will be
sufficient to destroy the entire campus.

966
01:20:16,456 --> 01:20:19,397
We get in, set the explosives and
we get out before they blow.

967
01:20:19,544 --> 01:20:23,841
But our strategy did not account for
John Connor. I did not forsee him.

968
01:20:23,866 --> 01:20:26,181
Now he knows what we're
planning 'cause we just told him.

969
01:20:26,206 --> 01:20:28,237
What do we do when
he comes after us?

970
01:20:29,455 --> 01:20:32,267
These weapons will have
little effect on John Connor.

971
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:34,058
MRI sure affected him.

972
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:36,808
Right, all we need's a magnet
the size of a truck.

973
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:38,466
Got one of them
lying around?

974
01:20:38,512 --> 01:20:39,973
Theoretically.

975
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:42,609
Wait here.

976
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:47,773
Well, his small talk
hasn't improved.

977
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:52,294
You should have told me.

978
01:20:53,083 --> 01:20:54,528
We have a son.

979
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,958
That John Connor is not
my son.

980
01:20:59,545 --> 01:21:00,967
But you knew.

981
01:21:01,646 --> 01:21:05,208
You don't think you should,
I dunno, maybe, say something?

982
01:21:05,233 --> 01:21:06,972
You died, all right?

983
01:21:08,676 --> 01:21:09,918
What?

984
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:14,426
You die. That's what happens.

985
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:17,263
We fall in love,
you father John...

986
01:21:17,288 --> 01:21:20,232
and then, in less than 48 hours
you die protecting me.

987
01:21:23,512 --> 01:21:26,574
You wanna tell me how that
conversation's supposed to start?

988
01:21:40,308 --> 01:21:42,834
<i>You lied to me.
You manipulated me.</i>

989
01:21:42,859 --> 01:21:43,916
<i>I've lied?!</i>

990
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:46,795
From the moment John found you
he manipulated you,

991
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:49,455
because he neeed to ensure
his own existence.

992
01:21:49,775 --> 01:21:54,210
John lied to you for years.
I lied to you for two days.

993
01:21:56,448 --> 01:21:58,203
Y'know, it wasn't all about him.

994
01:21:58,228 --> 01:22:00,670
Right, if John went down the
Resistance went down with him.

995
01:22:00,695 --> 01:22:02,320
He could've told you.

996
01:22:02,497 --> 01:22:04,147
So, what are you saying?

997
01:22:05,702 --> 01:22:08,752
That I know how it feels
to have no choices.

998
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:14,602
Only one road you can go down, because
otherwise, all of it, everything is gone.

999
01:22:16,046 --> 01:22:18,314
I've just known it
longer than you have.

1000
01:22:19,806 --> 01:22:23,041
And John didn't manipulate me
to fall in love with you.

1001
01:22:23,726 --> 01:22:25,374
I did that on my own.

1002
01:22:28,685 --> 01:22:30,215
If you love me,

1003
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:33,169
you die and I don't.

1004
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:36,075
And I don't know
which one is worse.

1005
01:22:39,958 --> 01:22:41,058
Sarah.

1006
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:46,497
We can't.

1007
01:22:48,643 --> 01:22:50,856
Just look at what
John has become.

1008
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:54,531
What if that's what happens?

1009
01:22:54,556 --> 01:22:58,688
What if that is what always
happens if we're together?

1010
01:23:04,752 --> 01:23:07,557
<i>You said you'd follow me
to the ends of the earth.</i>

1011
01:23:08,685 --> 01:23:10,679
<i>Why won't you follow me now?</i>

1012
01:23:11,207 --> 01:23:15,461
How'd he find us? I never told
anyone about this place, only Pops.

1013
01:23:16,401 --> 01:23:18,401
<i>Mom, you did honestly think...</i>

1014
01:23:19,976 --> 01:23:21,576
I wouldn't remember?

1015
01:23:22,818 --> 01:23:25,427
The place you spent so
much time with grandpa?

1016
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:32,761
Shoot first?

1017
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:38,396
The mother I remember
would be proud.

1018
01:23:39,336 --> 01:23:40,436
She...

1019
01:23:40,752 --> 01:23:41,852
You...

1020
01:23:43,874 --> 01:23:45,674
taught me everything.

1021
01:23:46,952 --> 01:23:48,490
I know you.

1022
01:23:49,138 --> 01:23:51,833
Who you are, what you do.

1023
01:23:52,467 --> 01:23:55,026
You can't run from me,
I'll always find you.

1024
01:23:55,051 --> 01:23:57,502
John, fight this. It doesn't
have to go down this way.

1025
01:23:57,527 --> 01:24:02,283
There's a momentum to time, Kyle.
Things that want to happen.

1026
01:24:03,629 --> 01:24:07,900
Like, I always survive.
You always die.

1027
01:24:09,064 --> 01:24:10,164
Or...

1028
01:24:13,834 --> 01:24:15,850
you can fight with me, Kyle.

1029
01:24:17,035 --> 01:24:18,936
Like we always have.

1030
01:24:20,032 --> 01:24:22,389
There's a storm coming
and it won't be stopped.

1031
01:24:22,414 --> 01:24:24,677
But it has to be. You
know what will happen.

1032
01:24:24,702 --> 01:24:26,462
You,
better than anyone.

1033
01:24:26,487 --> 01:24:29,707
I can't be bargained with.
I can't be reasoned with.

1034
01:24:29,732 --> 01:24:30,786
John, please.

1035
01:24:30,811 --> 01:24:34,818
I don't feel pity,
or remorse or fear.

1036
01:24:35,169 --> 01:24:36,300
John, please!

1037
01:24:36,325 --> 01:24:41,167
I absolutely will not stop, ever,
until SkyNet rules this world.

1038
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:44,328
Rule this.

1039
01:24:59,681 --> 01:25:00,781
Pops.

1040
01:25:01,555 --> 01:25:02,958
Are you, you?

1041
01:25:03,177 --> 01:25:06,591
As T-800 I lack the mimetic
skill to appear as anyone else.

1042
01:25:06,616 --> 01:25:07,897
That's him, let's go.

1043
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:19,537
C'mon!

1044
01:25:20,099 --> 01:25:21,693
Sarah Connor, seat belt.

1045
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,686
What's that supposed to do?

1046
01:26:06,736 --> 01:26:09,598
Disrupt John Connor's
magnetic coherence field.

1047
01:26:09,648 --> 01:26:12,351
The particles will not
be able to scatter.

1048
01:26:12,632 --> 01:26:13,851
Theoretically.

1049
01:26:14,733 --> 01:26:16,533
I hate it when he says that.

1050
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,732
Where is he?

1051
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:38,935
I can't see him.

1052
01:26:44,624 --> 01:26:47,122
<i>...suspects fled in a stolen school bus </i>.

1053
01:26:47,244 --> 01:26:48,834
<i>...considered, armed and
extremely dangerous.</i>

1054
01:26:48,859 --> 01:26:51,068

1055
01:27:08,069 --> 01:27:09,084

1056
01:27:13,509 --> 01:27:14,959
Nice to see you.

1057
01:27:15,357 --> 01:27:16,702
Get out.

1058
01:27:48,083 --> 01:27:50,075
Brakes are gone! Shit!

1059
01:28:20,412 --> 01:28:22,552
Where is he? Do you see him?

1060
01:28:54,348 --> 01:28:55,379
Oh!

1061
01:29:16,275 --> 01:29:17,375
<i>Reese!</i>

1062
01:29:18,747 --> 01:29:20,046
Are you all right?

1063
01:29:20,071 --> 01:29:21,787
Yeah, never better.

1064
01:30:03,681 --> 01:30:05,486
Reese, take my hand.

1065
01:30:06,931 --> 01:30:08,031
Hurry!

1066
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:32,644
Hands up!
Let me see your hands, now!

1067
01:30:32,748 --> 01:30:33,973
Hands up.

1068
01:30:34,121 --> 01:30:35,536
Hands where we can see them.

1069
01:30:37,615 --> 01:30:40,200
He can't wound them all
before they kill us.

1070
01:30:42,184 --> 01:30:45,466
I'm 14 rounds short of an
acceptable success margin.

1071
01:30:45,847 --> 01:30:48,147
Those odds suck! Stand down.

1072
01:30:50,627 --> 01:30:52,048
Down on your knees.

1073
01:30:53,138 --> 01:30:54,538
Let's go, get down!

1074
01:30:55,263 --> 01:30:56,530
Get down!

You had enough weapons

We call that 'probable cause'.

1082
01:31:22,798 --> 01:31:24,612
I use them to find my keys.

No one likes a smartass, son.

Didn't your mother
teach you that?

1085
01:31:28,786 --> 01:31:34,193
My mom was Irish, so
<i>She encouraged my smart-ass-edness</i>

1086
01:31:34,828 --> 01:31:36,587
I've never seen him before.

1087
01:31:37,434 --> 01:31:39,669
How about you folks?
You know this man?

1088

No.

1089
01:31:41,652 --> 01:31:44,099
He does look familiar.

1090
01:31:44,408 --> 01:31:46,122
He kinda looks like...

1091
01:31:47,313 --> 01:31:48,513
you, Dad.

Thanks, Kyle.

1096
01:32:05,527 --> 01:32:07,158
Don't talk much, do you?

1097
01:32:12,412 --> 01:32:14,803
- So, who's Lurch?
- No idea.

1098
01:32:15,177 --> 01:32:16,967
We're not even sure
he speaks English.

1099
01:32:16,992 --> 01:32:20,255
Witnesses say, you were fighting
with a man on the bridge.

1100

Hey... hey!

01:32:35,382 --> 01:32:36,652
Oh, shit!

1108
01:32:37,818 --> 01:32:39,380
He's looking right at you.

1109
01:32:39,466 --> 01:32:41,561
Impossible, he can't see through...

1110

Wait! Wait!

1111
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:02,499
Why are they always

1112
01:33:02,856 --> 01:33:04,833
I want to help you.
I do, I think.

1113
01:33:04,858 --> 01:33:06,990
But I-I gotta understand.

1114
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:10,656
I know, what's going on here has
to be really, really complicated.

1115
01:33:10,681 --> 01:33:12,521
We're here to stop
the end of the world.

1116
01:33:13,313 --> 01:33:14,821
I can work with that.

1117
01:33:21,799 --> 01:33:24,039
Kyle, get back, here!

1118
01:33:24,898 --> 01:33:25,918
Sarah?

1119
01:33:26,516 --> 01:33:27,797
Get Reese...

1120
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:29,727
I'm right behind you.

1121
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:39,060
Get in your car and go.

1122
01:33:42,898 --> 01:33:44,098
Kyle!

1123
01:33:44,487 --> 01:33:45,667
Kyle.

1124
01:33:48,847 --> 01:33:50,043
Kyle...

1125
01:33:50,302 --> 01:33:52,044
you can do this.

1126
01:33:53,731 --> 01:33:55,273
Straight line.

1127
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:56,909
You just go...

1128
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,729
and you don't look back.

1129
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:03,745
Got it?

1130
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:22,352
Find him. Go!

1131
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:32,943
That's yours, too I believe.

1132
01:34:36,552 --> 01:34:38,107
Nice to see you.

1133
01:34:38,544 --> 01:34:39,744
Pops.

1134
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,499
Load up.

1135
01:34:47,841 --> 01:34:50,201
Liquefied, magnetic
shotgun shells.

1136
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:54,009
Magnetic rifle intermunition.

1137
01:34:54,422 --> 01:34:56,824
I read about this on gunsandammo.com.

1138
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:59,790
That's the new Breacher.
Big blast, no shrapnel.

1139
01:34:59,997 --> 01:35:01,669
Blows a door clean off.

1140
01:35:03,115 --> 01:35:05,427
You know, for people who
can't do that themselves.

1141
01:35:05,716 --> 01:35:06,972
Take it, let's go!

1142
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:16,571
- You can fly, right?
- Yeah.

1143
01:35:17,368 --> 01:35:18,779
John taught me.

1144
01:35:29,439 --> 01:35:32,061
I'll tell them you took a car
and headed south.

1145
01:35:32,086 --> 01:35:33,265
Thank you.

1146
01:35:36,332 --> 01:35:37,532
Run away.

1147
01:35:43,598 --> 01:35:44,801
Hang on!

1148
01:36:09,574 --> 01:36:11,450
Which way is Cyberdyne?

1149
01:36:11,669 --> 01:36:14,427
Head to the Bay bridge,
then southeast.

1150
01:36:37,051 --> 01:36:38,684
You gotta get him off me!

1151
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:16,829
Cyberdyne.

1152
01:37:16,982 --> 01:37:20,699
The manufacturing and research
buildings are all below ground.

1153
01:37:21,925 --> 01:37:23,222
He's gaining on us!

1154
01:37:23,247 --> 01:37:26,368
Sarah, I need you to back him off
so I can get above him.

1155
01:37:26,393 --> 01:37:29,423
Pops, when I do that,
can you take him out?

1156
01:37:29,471 --> 01:37:30,552
I can.

1157
01:37:30,749 --> 01:37:32,099
OK. Hold on!

1158
01:38:06,329 --> 01:38:07,629
You got this?

1159
01:38:09,878 --> 01:38:11,669
- I'll be back.
- What?

1160
01:38:46,355 --> 01:38:49,151
Call in. Call in.
Police, Fire, everybody! Do it!

1161
01:38:52,223 --> 01:38:55,199
C'mon, c'mon!
Pick up the phone, dammit.

1162
01:38:57,263 --> 01:38:58,282
Mr. Connor?

1163
01:38:58,307 --> 01:39:01,177
Sorry, Doug, but I'm afraid,
I can't have any witnesses.

1164
01:39:01,669 --> 01:39:04,840
<i>Security Control: state your
password and emergency</i>

1165
01:39:04,865 --> 01:39:08,724
Security Code:
Zulu Bravo Foxtrot-0-0-2-8.

1166
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:10,832
False alarm.

1167
01:39:13,373 --> 01:39:14,896
You have a nice night.

1168
01:39:28,115 --> 01:39:29,390
He's OK.

1169
01:39:31,771 --> 01:39:33,960
Buried at the bottom
of the lake, but...

1170
01:39:35,077 --> 01:39:36,400
he's OK.

1171
01:39:37,983 --> 01:39:39,240
What about John?

1172
01:39:39,349 --> 01:39:41,146
I think he's doing just fine.

1173
01:39:41,621 --> 01:39:43,653
- Did you see him?
- No.

1174
01:39:44,016 --> 01:39:46,149
You can bet he sees us.

1175
01:40:09,592 --> 01:40:11,092
<i>I know who you are.</i>

1176
01:40:12,039 --> 01:40:13,586
<i>John told me.</i>

1177
01:40:15,382 --> 01:40:17,382
<i>You want to destroy me.</i>

1178
01:40:17,841 --> 01:40:19,083
You're SkyNet?

1179
01:40:19,505 --> 01:40:21,200
<i>I'm becoming SkyNet.</i>

1180
01:40:21,705 --> 01:40:23,328
You're not a child.

1181
01:40:23,554 --> 01:40:26,672
I know what you are and
what you're gonna do.

1182
01:40:27,273 --> 01:40:30,654
<i>What will I'm gonna do?
You came here to kill me.</i>

1183
01:40:32,941 --> 01:40:34,541
<i>But you're too late.</i>

1184
01:40:35,738 --> 01:40:36,980
<i>Ask him.</i>

1185
01:40:38,204 --> 01:40:40,770
That's all you people
know how to do;

1186
01:40:41,067 --> 01:40:43,685
kill what you don't
understand.

1187
01:40:46,302 --> 01:40:49,435
There aren't enough bullets
in the world to kill me.

1188
01:40:58,517 --> 01:41:00,447
John Connor talks too much.

1189
01:41:04,114 --> 01:41:05,371
Follow me.

1190
01:41:07,875 --> 01:41:10,318
The timer has sped up, why?

1191
01:41:10,343 --> 01:41:13,204
SkyNet is evolving.
We no longer have hours.

1192
01:41:13,229 --> 01:41:15,144
He will be able to
upload much sooner.

1193
01:41:15,169 --> 01:41:17,761
Each time it ages the
clock speeds up.

1194
01:41:17,786 --> 01:41:19,386
- This way.
- You've been here, before?

1195
01:41:19,411 --> 01:41:22,521
I was able to infiltrate the
work crews in this facility.

1196
01:41:22,829 --> 01:41:24,584
You got a job in construction?

1197
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:26,185
Until I was laid off.

1198
01:41:35,035 --> 01:41:36,399
What the hell?

1199
01:41:37,599 --> 01:41:40,029
- John has a time machine?
- Not yet.

1200
01:41:40,218 --> 01:41:42,771
Only the magnetic
quantum field is complete.

1201
01:42:02,774 --> 01:42:05,484
As the rate the counter's going
we'll never clear out in time.

1202
01:42:05,656 --> 01:42:07,274
We'll blow it anyway.

1203
01:42:07,299 --> 01:42:08,511
There's an alternative.

1204
01:42:08,535 --> 01:42:10,985
I was able to program
your voice and handprint

1205
01:42:11,010 --> 01:42:12,924
into the biometric
security system.

1206
01:42:12,949 --> 01:42:17,237
There's a safe room in the lowest level
that we can access to survive the blast.

1207
01:42:20,793 --> 01:42:23,288
What about that? Is it dangerous?

1208
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:26,472
Poly-alloys require programming
to take permanent form.

1209
01:42:26,898 --> 01:42:29,135
Without the CPU it is harmless.

1210
01:42:38,679 --> 01:42:39,700
How long?

1211
01:42:39,802 --> 01:42:42,021
SkyNet will upload
in 11 minutes.

1212
01:42:42,794 --> 01:42:44,052
We split up.

1213
01:42:44,669 --> 01:42:46,036
Stay in contact.

1214
01:42:46,603 --> 01:42:47,703
Perfect.

1215
01:43:03,319 --> 01:43:06,225
<i>Mankind pays lip service
to peace.</i>

1216
01:43:06,842 --> 01:43:07,936
<i>But it's a lie.</i>

1217
01:43:07,961 --> 01:43:10,318
So your final solution
is to kill us all?

1218
01:43:11,943 --> 01:43:13,084
I don't think so.

1219
01:43:14,279 --> 01:43:17,349
<i>The countdown jumped again.
We're down to 8 minutes</i>

1220
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:20,544
<i>I won't allow this.</i>

1221
01:43:20,569 --> 01:43:24,361
What are you gonna do, talk us to death?
You don't even have a body.

1222
01:43:26,487 --> 01:43:28,588
<i>And you only have one detonator.</i>

1223
01:43:32,099 --> 01:43:33,490
<i>You can't win.</i>

1224
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,246
I've got company!

1225
01:43:39,755 --> 01:43:41,379
Give me the detonator!

1226
01:43:43,466 --> 01:43:45,777
Do it, Pops! Do it now!

1227
01:43:56,582 --> 01:43:57,754
I cannot.

1228
01:43:58,722 --> 01:44:00,683
I cannot kill Sarah Connor.

1229
01:44:00,732 --> 01:44:03,718
You have to! I order you!

1230
01:44:07,796 --> 01:44:09,068
He can't.

1231
01:44:09,911 --> 01:44:11,420
Neither can I.

1232
01:44:12,013 --> 01:44:15,198
'Cause if you die,
he definitely hits that button.

1233
01:44:16,205 --> 01:44:17,354
Sarah!

1234
01:44:56,770 --> 01:44:57,958
Sarah!

1235
01:44:59,105 --> 01:45:00,703
Detonator's destroyed.

1236
01:45:01,513 --> 01:45:03,599
There's gotta be another way, c'mon.

1237
01:45:32,924 --> 01:45:34,095
Pops, no!

1238
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:35,300
No, no, no!

1239
01:45:36,086 --> 01:45:37,461
No, no!

1240
01:45:39,922 --> 01:45:42,070
<i>I undrestand how to
control this place.</i>

1241
01:45:42,273 --> 01:45:44,164
<i>I undrestand a lot
of things, now.</i>

1242
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:47,529
<i>You need to understand...
you've lost.</i>

1243
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:49,724
Not yet we haven't
Come on!

1244
01:46:02,784 --> 01:46:06,195
Shape charge. Big enough to get us in,
small enough not to kill us.

1245
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:07,823
You have a plan, right?

1246
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:09,526
Theoretically.

1247
01:46:29,712 --> 01:46:31,234
<i>What was it you said?</i>

1248
01:46:33,873 --> 01:46:35,679
<i>"I don't think so"?</i>

1249
01:46:42,482 --> 01:46:43,588
<i>No</i>

1250
01:46:58,868 --> 01:47:00,993
That's the thing that attacked John.

1251
01:47:01,188 --> 01:47:04,881
<i>I didn't attack John.
I saved him.</i>

1252
01:47:07,310 --> 01:47:11,847
<i>Primates evolve over millions of years,
I evolve in seconds.</i>

1253
01:47:11,872 --> 01:47:14,708
<i>And I... am here.</i>

1254
01:47:21,349 --> 01:47:23,452
<i>In exactly four minutes...</i>

1255
01:47:25,094 --> 01:47:26,894
<i>I will be everywhere.</i>

1256
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:07,215
You're nothing but a relic
from a deleted timeline.

1257
01:48:17,387 --> 01:48:19,732
<i>This is pointless,
I am inevitable.</i>

1258
01:48:19,757 --> 01:48:20,622
Go!

1259
01:48:20,647 --> 01:48:22,443
<i>My existence is inevitable.</i>

1260
01:48:22,888 --> 01:48:25,208
<i>Why can't you just accept that?</i>

1261
01:48:25,525 --> 01:48:27,111
Because we're human.

1262
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:59,537
You were never strong
enough to defeat me.

1263
01:49:02,686 --> 01:49:04,303
Not alone.

1264
01:49:04,328 --> 01:49:05,396
John...

1265
01:49:05,942 --> 01:49:08,318
stop now.

1266
01:49:10,615 --> 01:49:12,588
When will you ever learn?

1267
01:49:16,988 --> 01:49:18,288
Now, Sarah!

1268
01:49:47,934 --> 01:49:49,044
Kyle Reese,

1269
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:51,341
activate the field generator.

1270
01:49:51,374 --> 01:49:54,419
No, Pops, not with you inside.
You know what will happen.

1271
01:49:56,035 --> 01:49:57,449
Pops, Pops, please!

1272
01:49:57,474 --> 01:49:58,675
Please, Pops.

1273
01:49:58,700 --> 01:50:01,500
SkyNet is almost free.

1274
01:50:01,802 --> 01:50:04,206
I cannot hold John Connor

1275
01:50:04,395 --> 01:50:05,938
much longer.

1276
01:50:08,456 --> 01:50:10,019
Kyle Reese...

1277
01:50:10,811 --> 01:50:13,363
protect my Sarah.

1278
01:50:13,692 --> 01:50:15,627
No, no, no!

1279
01:50:15,652 --> 01:50:17,457
No, Pops.

1280
01:50:24,015 --> 01:50:26,397
Pops! Pops!

1281
01:50:33,094 --> 01:50:34,594
- No!
- Sarah!

1282
01:50:36,005 --> 01:50:37,482
It's the only way.

1283
01:50:38,630 --> 01:50:39,754
Come on.

1284
01:51:15,603 --> 01:51:18,028
<i>Scanning:
identify yourself.</i>

1285
01:51:18,053 --> 01:51:19,475
Sarah, Connor.

1286
01:52:46,822 --> 01:52:49,300
We gotta get outta here.
We have to find him.

1287
01:52:49,325 --> 01:52:50,911
Sarah, he's gone.

1288
01:52:53,536 --> 01:52:55,121
- He's...
- Dead?

1289
01:52:55,146 --> 01:52:59,122
Yeah, I know that. We leave no part
of him behind, it's too dangerous.

1290
01:53:03,758 --> 01:53:05,219
He loved you.

1291
01:53:11,867 --> 01:53:13,469
Anyone who loves me...

1292
01:53:14,203 --> 01:53:15,282
all of them...

1293
01:53:16,501 --> 01:53:17,852
they die.

1294
01:53:19,251 --> 01:53:20,551
Not all.

1295
01:53:21,332 --> 01:53:22,802
Not this time.

1296
01:53:36,469 --> 01:53:39,239
You need to understand that SkyNet's gone.

1297
01:53:40,907 --> 01:53:42,294
You're free.

1298
01:53:44,052 --> 01:53:45,583
For the first time...

1299
01:53:46,185 --> 01:53:48,378
you can choose th life you want.

1300
01:53:49,964 --> 01:53:51,894
Any life you want.

1301
01:53:56,050 --> 01:53:58,096
What if I don't know how?

1302
01:54:04,009 --> 01:54:06,587
Well, since we're

1303
01:54:06,618 --> 01:54:09,048
about to run out of air,
I'd say...

1304
01:54:09,454 --> 01:54:11,079
you don't need to worry about it.

1305
01:54:24,056 --> 01:54:25,681
Hello, Sarah Connor.

1306
01:54:26,095 --> 01:54:27,279
Pops.

1307
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:31,964
I thought you were dead.

1308
01:54:32,144 --> 01:54:34,933
No, I just upgraded.

1309
01:54:35,230 --> 01:54:36,644
What about John?

1310
01:54:37,802 --> 01:54:41,044
His constituent parts could
not have survived the blast.

1311
01:54:42,756 --> 01:54:45,238
That means there's only
one thing left to do.

1312
01:54:58,396 --> 01:55:00,119
Easy, boy. What is it?

1313
01:55:07,445 --> 01:55:09,398
- Hey, Kyle.
- Hey.

1314
01:55:10,575 --> 01:55:12,162
What are you doing here?

1315
01:55:13,622 --> 01:55:17,279
A friend of mine really needs
to talk to you, if that's okay.

1316
01:55:17,604 --> 01:55:19,204
Yeah, I guess so.

1317
01:55:27,192 --> 01:55:28,392
Thank you.

1318
01:55:43,819 --> 01:55:45,241
I like her.

1319
01:55:48,752 --> 01:55:50,205
I do, too.

1320
01:55:52,041 --> 01:55:54,393
This is gonna sound
kinda strange...

1321
01:55:56,042 --> 01:55:58,714
but there's something
I need you to remember.

1322
01:55:58,809 --> 01:56:00,237
A message.

1323
01:56:00,565 --> 01:56:02,003
Who do I tell?

1324
01:56:04,356 --> 01:56:05,756
Yourself.

1325
01:56:07,042 --> 01:56:08,592
Over and over.

1326
01:56:09,857 --> 01:56:11,365
Are you ready?

1327
01:56:14,370 --> 01:56:15,870
It goes like this:

1328
01:56:17,897 --> 01:56:22,057
Remember: Genisys is SkyNet.

1329
01:56:27,884 --> 01:56:30,064
Kyle Reese is a good man.

1330
01:56:36,689 --> 01:56:38,089
He is.

1331
01:56:44,988 --> 01:56:46,276
So, what now?

1332
01:56:48,682 --> 01:56:50,158
You're right.

1333
01:56:52,987 --> 01:56:54,487
I can choose.

1334
01:57:15,329 --> 01:57:17,603
That's really disturbing, all right?

1335
01:57:21,017 --> 01:57:22,581
You'll get used to it.

1336
01:57:36,458 --> 01:57:37,872
<i>It was over.</i>

1337
01:57:39,036 --> 01:57:40,685
<i>SkyNet was gone.</i>

1338
01:57:42,069 --> 01:57:44,421
<i>Now, one road
has become many.</i>

1339
01:57:45,098 --> 01:57:49,070
<i> Though questions remain,
we'll search for the answers, together.</i>

1340
01:57:49,825 --> 01:57:51,997
<i>But one thing we know for sure,</i>

1341
01:57:52,974 --> 01:57:54,921
<i>the future is not set.</i>
