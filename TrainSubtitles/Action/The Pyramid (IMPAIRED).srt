looking for us.

A soldier popped out of a hidden

have that long.

a gate here...

then behind those stones
there is a passage...

00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,886
and maybe another way out.

715
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,560
And if the gate has been standing
here for thousands of years...

716
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,205
maybe it's standing here
for a reason.

00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,011
or at least what the
bloody hell is after us.

945
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,607
This panel depicts
the final judgment,
the weighing of souls.

946
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,961
FITZIE: What?

947
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,122
HOLDEN: It's from the
Egyptian Book of the Dead.

948
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,160
When a person died,
they passed into a room.

949
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,807
They were brought before
Osiris and a panel of judges.

950
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,201
And next to them
was a massive scale.

951
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,050
Then the god Anubis
weighed their heart

952
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,203
against Maat,
the goddess of truth.

953
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,243
And if it balanced
perfectly,

954
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,209
they passed
into the afterlife.

955
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,405
NORA: They believed
they were sent to the sky

956

to dwell among the stars.

957
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,040
I thought
the Book of the Dead

958
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,680
was just full of spells
and incantations.

959

NORA: No,
it's more than that.

960
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,486
It's a guide
to immortality.

961
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,041
This was central
to Egyptian philosophy.

962
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,602

965
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,920
I think the priests
acted out this ritual.

966

this pyramid built

1421
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,720
for his journey
into the afterlife.

1422
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,166
Nora, I promise you,
look...

1423
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,288
I've got it all
down on tape. All right?

1424
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,647
You can watch it back
as soon as we're out.

1425
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,608
Anubis turned his wrath
on the people.

1426
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,007
He had hundreds
of them sacrificed...

1427
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,049
so he could join his father
in the afterlife.

1428
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,011
Since his soul
was corrupted,

1429
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,730
he was looking
for a pure one...

1430
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,928
a pure heart, if you will.

1431
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,082
The only way to enter
the final gate of heaven.

1432
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,084
My father was right.

1433
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,328
This pyramid
became a prison.

1434
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,440
Closed by the Egyptians
to get rid of their own god.

1435
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,285
Nora, does this thing
give us any clues

1436
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,850
on how to get out of here?

1437
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,485
It says something
about a star map.

1438
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,880
Then you got
to find it, okay?

1439
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:50,243
Because your friend Anubis is
gonna be back any minute now!

1440
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,489
The exit shaft
points to where the dead

1441
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,369
was supposed to be
resurrected.

1442
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,361
FITZIE: Well, then...

1443
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,847
There must be at least
six shafts in this room.

1444
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,480
How do we know
which is the right one?

1445
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,161
The stars...

1446
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,490
Look at the ceiling.

1447
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,410
Fitzie,
turn off your light.

1448
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,325
Look at the ceiling.

1449
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,608
In between the hieroglyphs,
all those dots.

1450
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,569
That's the star map!

1451
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,688
So what exactly
are we looking for?

1452
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,490
The tetrahedron.

1453
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,130
The three-sided
pyramid is also

1454
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,362
the hieroglyphic symbol
for the Sirius star.

1455
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,648
Look! There it is.

1456
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,490
The brightest one.

1457
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,810
It's right above
this shaft.

1458
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,200
It's got to be our way out!

1459
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,840
Okay. Well, let's go
check it out.

1460

NORA: Okay. Come on!

1461
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,530
