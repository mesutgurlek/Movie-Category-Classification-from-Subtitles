00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,334
Garona.

335
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,463
She calls herself Garona.

336
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,669
KING LLANE: What kind
of being are you?

337
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,762
She seems more like us
than those beasts we fought.

338
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,261
Orc.

339
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:48,933
KING LLANE: Orc?

340
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,347
That's what you are,
or the beast in
the cage was?

341
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,936
I know every race in
the Seven Kingdoms.
I've never heard of "orc".

342
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,526
Show me where
you come from?

343
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,160
GARONA: This is not orc world.

344
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,949
Orc world is dead.

345
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,294
Orcs take this world now.

346
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,117
Not from this world?

347
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,786
How did you get here?

348
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,666
The Great Gate.

349
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:23,965
Deep in ground...

350
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,802
lnto magic brought
us here.

351
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:27,798
But how did you
learn our language?

352
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,560
Orc take
prisoner for the gate.
I learn from them.

353
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,639
KING LLANE: Prisoners?

354
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,721
Our people?

355
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,563
Are they alive?

356
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,517
Yes. Many.

357
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:38,898
Why?

358
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,234
GARONA: To feed the gate.

359
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,146
To bring in the Horde.

360
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:43,988
To take your world.

361
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,282
You'll take us to them.

362
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,608
No.

363
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,491
You'll take us to them.

364
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,328
Or you'll end up like
your friend in the cage.

365
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,752
You think you're
fearsome?

366
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,418
Orc children have pets
more fearsome than you.

367
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,758
We're not trying to
be fearsome, Garona.

368
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:08,045
We're trying to
protect our people,
our families.

369
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,390
If you help us,
I give you my oath,

370
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,510
you will have
your freedom.

371
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,813
(lNDISTINCT CHATTER)

372
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,187
GUL'DAN: Fearsome Blackhand,

373
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,320
Warchief of the Horde.

374
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:30,032
You have allowed
the small-teeth
to kill your warriors.

375
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:35,541
Worse, you've shamed
your people by
running from an enemy.

376
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,828
Are you too weak
to talk, Destroyer?

377
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:44,213
The Horde has no
use for weakness.

378
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,878
Respect our tradition,
Warchief.

379
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,178
You know the penalty.

380
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,218
Death!

381
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,019
ORCS: For the Horde!

382
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:03,806
For the Horde!

383
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,227
For the Horde!

384
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,528
For the Horde!

385
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,076
GUL'DAN: Stop!

386
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,674
You dare interrupt
this judgment?

387
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,420
We fought hard.

388
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,127
Their warlock used
your Fel against us.

389
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,797
Only I can
control the Fel!

390
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:37,348
I see you and your
men have survived.

391
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,348
Perhaps Blackhand

392
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,188
kept you safely away
from the battlefield?

393
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,483
Maybe he knows
you're weak, too.

394
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:51,608
Do you wish
to challenge me,
little chieftain?

395
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,945
I do not question,
Gul'Dan.

396
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:01,331
But the Fel
is born of death.

397
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,455
It must have a price.

398
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,795
A price paid
in lives taken.

399
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,521
DRAKA: Will you
hold your son?

(COOING)

401
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,368
DRAKA: He will be
a great chieftain.

402
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,076
Like his father.

403
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,536
A born leader.

404
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,036
I was no leader today.

405
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,338
(GIGGLING)

406
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,183
He challenges
you already.

407
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,265
If Gul'Dan can infect
one as innocent as him,

408
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,978
what chance do
the rest of us have?

409
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,192
Whatever happens.

410
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,281
Whatever happens.

411
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,166
I see you.

412
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,996
This gate,

413
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,546
who showed it to Gul'Dan?

414
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,875
Who led him to Azeroth?

415
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,392
Gul'Dan called him
a demon.

416
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,507
Did you see it?

417
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,219
Not the face,

418
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,022
but the voice.

419
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,728
Like fire and ash.

420

(GATE OPENS)

(CAWING)

423
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,995
I'll be here
if you need me.

(LATCH CLANGING)

425
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:22,718
Your mate.

426
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,433
I could kill you
before he even reaches me.

427
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:29,732
Lothar?

428
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,357
(CHUCKLES)
He is my brother.

429
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,532
The king is my mate.

430
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,609
You're the chieftain's
wife then.

431
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,817
I suppose so.

432
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,288
Then killing you
would bring me
even greater honor.

433
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:46,865
Not among my kind.

434
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:49,705
It is a cold night.

435
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,422
I thought you might
use these.

436
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,313
It will warm you.

More of our villages
burn tonight.

439
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,645
One of them is
the village
of my birth.

440
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,909
I cannot imagine
what horrors you have
been through, Garona.

441
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,044
But this doesn't
need to happen.

442
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:33,214
We have had
peace in these lands
for many years now.

443
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,920
Peace between races
from all over the world.

444
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:43,469
What is...

445
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,679
I can have it removed.

446
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,607
There is a life
here for you, Garona.

447
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,444
With us.

448
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,743

Even from a distance.

Remember when we
would track blood ox
through the Frostwind Dunes?

always life.

You don't think it's strange

464

that we lost our home
when Gul'Dan came to power?

One orc cannot
kill a world, Durotan.

Are you sure?

467
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,606
Look around you.

468
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,188
Does it not remind
you of something?

469
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,162
Wherever Gul'Dan
works his magic,
the land dies.

470
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:33,365
If our people are
to make a home here,
my friend...

471
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,962
Gul'Dan must be stopped.

472
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,048
We are not powerful enough
to defeat Gul'Dan.

473

No.

474
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,301
No.

475
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,809
But with the humans' help,

476
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,521
we could be.

477
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,815
I want that weapon.

478
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,578
You'll have me
to protect you.

479
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,828
I need no one
to protect me!

My deepest apologies,
Khadgar.

484
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:14,973
You see,
I thought we bonded

485
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,640
when I didn't put
you in a prison cell

486
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,056
for breaking into
the Royal Barracks.

487
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,151
Now take the watch.

Well, at least
you're not reading.

489

He wishes to lie with me.

490
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,304
Beg your pardon?

491
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,257
You would be injured.

492
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,681
I don't want
to lie with you.

493
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,434
Good. You would not
be an effective mate.

Why do you laugh?

I can't see how you humans
survive such a thing.

Brittle bones that break.

00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,066
You don't look
that different to us.

500
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,362
How did you survive?

501
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,987
Broken bones
heal stronger.

502
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,702
Mine are very strong.

503
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,161
I'm sorry.

504
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,326
GARONA: Do not be.

505
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,134
My name...

506
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:31,133
Garona.

507
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,434
It means "cursed" in Orc.

508
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,979
My mother was burned alive
for giving birth to me.

509
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:48,899
They kept you alive, though.

510
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,986
Gul'Dan did.

511
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,662
He gave me her tusk.

512
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,121
To remember her.

513
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:11,706
My parents gave me
to the Kirin Tor when
I was six years old.

514
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,176
That's the last
time I saw them.

515
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,505
Or any of my
brothers and sisters.

516
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,143
It brings a family honor

517
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,267
to offer a child
to the Kirin Tor.

518
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,941
To have their son
taken up to the floating
city of Dalaran

519
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:33,074
and be trained by
the most powerful
mages in the land.

520
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,701
Less so, to have
them run away.

521
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,289
Well, that was cheerful.

522
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:50,919
GARONA: The Great Gate.

523
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,510
Why do they need
so many prisoners?

524
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,053
Like wood for a fire.

525
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,057
Green magic takes
life to open the gate.

526
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,142
LOTHAR: How many more orcs
are they planning on bringing?

527
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,226
GARONA: All of them.

528
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,726
This is just a warband.

529
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,062
When the portal
is opened,

530
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,396
Gul'Dan will bring
the Horde.

531
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,577
Get them back
to Stormwind.

532
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,619
We'll ride ahead.

533
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,343
KHADGAR: Garona.

534
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,087
We should go. it's not safe...

535
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,177
Durotan.

536
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:45,099
To the north,
there is a black rock
that touches the sky.

537
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,847
I would meet
with their leader.

538
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,694
To challenge him?

539
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,943
I saw you lead
the small-teeth to
our encampment.

540
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,439
They have seen
what is being built.

541
00:44:56,444 --> 00:45:00,284
But only you know
what Gul'Dan has
planned for my people.

542
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,910
This magic is death,
to all things.

543
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,544
Must be stopped.

544
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,791
Tell him.

545
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,296
The black rock,
when the sun is highest.

546
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:16,963
GARONA: I will.

547
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,296
Chieftain.

548
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,722
If I return,

549
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,224
would you take me
into your clan?

550
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,392
You're safer here.

551
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,096
With them.

552
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,307
(MUFFLED BREATHING)

553
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:24,874
Is it as you feared?

554
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,992
The Fel is everywhere.

555
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,408
Then you mustn't leave again.

556
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,119
They need a Guardian's help
now more than ever.

557
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,880
Maybe the boy can help.

558
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:44,085
We need solutions!

559
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,013
We need solutions!

560
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:46,178
Easy for you
to say that!

561
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,845
The Dwarven forges
must work overtime.

562
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:51,175
KING MAGNl: You treat us
no better than dogs.

563
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,310
We shall supply
you no more!

564
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:54,728
(SHOUTING) Enough!

565
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,730
You have all called on
Stormwind in the past.

566
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,607
Either for troops
or arbitration.

567
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,605
If we do not unite

568
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,360
to fight this enemy,

569
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,494
we will perish.

570
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,624
ALL: Hear, hear.

571
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,740
KING LLANE: Stormwind needs
soldiers, arms, horses.

572
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,035
KING MAGNl: We have our own
kingdoms to look after.

573
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:14,746
DELEGATE: Fight your own wars!
LOTHAR: Your Majesty.

574
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,380
Commander.

575
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,093
The orcs are
building a portal,

576
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,210
through which they
plan to bring an army.

577
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,380
If we do not stop them now,
we may never get
another opportunity.

578
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,434
ELF DELEGATE: Where is he?

579
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:28,974
Where is the protector
of Azeroth?

580
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:30,138
Where is the Guardian?

581
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:31,771
(SOFTLY)
Where is Medivh?

582
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:33,682
My liege.

583
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:34,851
I suggest
we take a recess.

584
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,307
LORDAERIAN DELEGATE:
Take as long as you like.

585
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:37,939
We're done.

586
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,900
(lNDISTINCT CHATTER)

587
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,493
Commander.

588
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,571
What's left of the
Fourth has retreated
from Stonewatch.

589
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:47,909
What's left?

590
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,410
Callan is among
the injured.

591
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,458
Dad?

592
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,512
I'm fine. it's fine.

593
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,100
You had me worried.

594
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,104
Where's the rest
of your troop?

595
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,350
They took most
of them alive.

596
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:21,856
We'll get them back.

597
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:24,444
Don't be in such a hurry.

598
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,240
You're all I have.

599
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,663
I know.

600
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,293
I'm a soldier.

601
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,014
He would not ask
for this meeting

602
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,046
if he thought he could
defeat Gul'Dan alone.

603
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,306
The Fel must
truly terrify him.

604
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,814
Durotan is scared
of nothing.

605
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:58,766
LOTHAR: The location.

606
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:02,111
The suddenness
of this meeting.

607
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:04,899
Sounds like a trap.

608
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,567
It is not.
Could be.

609
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,782
It is not!
Could be.

610
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:08,862
It is not!

611
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,490
What do you think?

612
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:13,164
It's too good
an opportunity to ignore.

613
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,581
I think we
have no choice.

614
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:19,621
We must stop the orcs
from opening the portal.

615
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,003
But we will need help.

616
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,042
And if he's lying?

617
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,208
Orcs do not lie.

618
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,419
What if he is?

619
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,417
There is no honor in it.
And where is the honor

620
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:30,299
in him betraying
his own people?

621
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,800
Durotan is
protecting his clan.

622
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,470
His enemy is the Fel.

623
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,139
Gul'Dan is the betrayer.

624
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,807
This orc, Durotan...

625
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,390
How do you know him?

626
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:41,561
GARONA: He freed me.

627
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,769
And he is loved
by his clan.

628
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,227
He is a strong chieftain.

629
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:49,569
LADY TARIA: Strong chiefs
must earn their clan's trust.

630
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,493
If we are to
expect you to join us,

631
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:56,197
we must earn yours.

632
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:07,087
To defend yourself.

633
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,762
With this?

634
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,724
Yes.

635
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,972
KING LLANE: Find the Guardian.

636
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:18,925
What is this?

637
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,227
Guardian?

638
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:28,111
The gate. We saw it,
in the Morass.

639
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,735
I've been putting
together all the clues
I can about it.

640
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:32,203
MEDIVH: This.

641
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,613
This drawing.
Where did you copy it from?

642
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:35,699
Guardian.

643
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:36,783
And this.

644
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:41,656
And this.

645
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:43,536
And this?

646
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,210
I've been researching
ever since I felt
the presence of the Fel.

647
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,843
I am the Guardian! Me.

648
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,086
Not you. Not yet.

649
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,716
I just thought you might
appreciate some help.

650
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,268
Don't presume
you can help me.

651
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,402
You have no idea the forces

652
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,074
I contend with.

653
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,407
If you want to help,

654
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,490
protect the king.

655
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,288
You leave the Fel to me.

656
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,837
Interesting choice.

657
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,219
Guardian.

658
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,470
STORMWIND GUARD:
Pack up and move
to the west gate!

659
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:45,942
(lNDISTINCT CHATTER)

660
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:50,773
You there!
Rise from your stall
and get moving. Now!

661
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,661
I need your help.
I found a book.

662
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:00,784

Burned all my research.

They were invited in.

And the Guardian
burned your research?

01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:37,989
If love is what you need,

829
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:42,924
you must be willing to
travel to the ends of
the world to find it.

830
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:50,509
You left your mate.

831
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,260
Go find Lothar.

832
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:16,532
Step inside the circle.

833
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:26,542
This

834
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:31,301
is my gift to you,
Garona.

835
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:04,328
ORGRIM: Whole world in
exchange for a statue.

836
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:07,536
Gods are strange
creatures.

837
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,327
(GUL'DAN LAUGHS)

838
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,503
Frostwolves.

839
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:15,382
You are
a practical people.

840
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:19,005
Those of us from
the south have always
admired that about you.

841
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,515
When the portal opens

842
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:30,404
and the rest of
the Horde join us,

843
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,610
we will gift them the Fel.

844
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,280
All of them.

845
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:37,065
Durotan did not
agree to this!

846
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,947
And why would you care
what that traitor thinks?

847
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:44,544
It is time for a new leader
of the Frostwolf clan.

848
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:47,581
One who has
the best interests
of his orcs in mind.

849
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:51,171
One who appreciates
Gul'Dan's vision.

850
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,217
His power.
(GROANING)

851
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:58,877
Come...

852
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,889
I will grant you
the Fel.

853
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:04,893
Durotan,

854
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:08,595
he has poisoned
the Frostwolves
against Fel.

855
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,935
Let me gather them.

856
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:13,233
Bring them here.

857
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,567
Grant me the Fel
in front of them.

858
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:19,202
Let them see how
much stronger I become.

859
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,830
As I said,

860
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,829
a practical people.

861
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,084
This is a new dawn.

862
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,575
The time of the Horde.

863
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:33,752
Be feared

864
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,260
or be fuel.
(GROANING)

865
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:51,306
I'm sorry.

866
01:09:53,982 --> 01:09:55,482
Callan's mother

867
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,493
died in childbirth.

868
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,029
I blamed him for it

869
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,083
for years.

870
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,792
I'm not gonna blame you.

871
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:21,467
He was so young.

872
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,188
In my entire life,

873
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:42,149
I've never felt as
much pain as I do now.

874
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:50,203
No...
(HOWLING)

875
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:52,664
No!

876
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,708
MALE ORC 1: Move out. Go!

877
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:58,921
Move!

878
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:02,085
Gul'Dan does not
want to waste his power
on the Frostwolves.

879
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:03,675
FEMALE ORC: Burn them!

880
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,845
Take the weak,
kill the strong!

881
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:17,731
(STRAINING)

882
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:23,653
MALE ORC 2: Get them!

883
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,788
I'll bathe in your blood!

884
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:31,945
Maybe.

885
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,208
But not now.

886
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:35,458
I can't give you long,

887
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,041
but I can give
you a head start.

888
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,714
For the sake of
your son, Draka.

889
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,546
Leave.

890
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:45,257
Now.

891
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,552
MALE ORC 3: Kill them all!

892
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:54,810
(BABY CRYING)

893
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:58,806
MALE ORC 4: Burn it down!

894
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:02,403
You should have
trusted in your Chieftain,

895
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,898
Orgrim Doomhammer.

896
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:17,245
MALE ORC 5:
She's getting away!

897
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:44,742
Wait for me.

898
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:45,902
ARCHMAGE: Khadgar!

899
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:47,857
ANTONIDAS:
How dare you return here!

900
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:48,947
FINDEN: Get out!

901
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:50,412
I come seeking
your wisdom.

902
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,241
ANTONIDAS: There is nothing
for you here now.

903
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,160
The Guardian
Medivh is unwell.

904
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,620
What?

905
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,458
He has been
poisoned by the Fel.

906
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,495
ARCHMAGE: What?
Ridiculous!

907
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,671
What do you know
of the Dark Portal?

908
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:03,206
You come back

909
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,629
and accuse the Guardian...

910
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:05,957
What is Alodi?

911
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:08,299
FINDEN: How does he know?

912
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,639
Alodi.

913
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,516
What is it?

914
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:22,732
An entity from
a time before the
Kirin Tor existed.

915
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:25,979
We think it served
a function similar to
that of the Guardian.

916
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:28,148
Protector.

917
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,775
No one beyond the
Arch Council knows
of its existence.

918
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,659
And it will stay
that way.

919
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:37,617
For you to mention it
in the same breath
as the Dark Portal

920
01:13:37,789 --> 01:13:39,209
is too much
to be mere...

921
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:44,214
Coincidence.

922
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:47,586
Do I go in?

923
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:50,757
I don't know.
It's never done
that before.

924
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:10,737
ALODl: Khadgar...

925
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:12,235
KHADGAR: I know you.

926
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:14,066
From the library.

927
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:17,160
You're Alodi?

928
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,457
I used

929
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:26,375
the last of my energies
to summon you here.

930
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:28,506
The Guardian has betrayed us.

931
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,383
Medivh.

932
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,218
I saw the Fel
in his eyes.

933
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,676
He is consumed by it.

934
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:37,717
If he is not stopped,

935
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,890
this world will burn.

936
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:43,019
I don't have the power
to defeat a Guardian.

937
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:46,111
Guardian is but a name.

938
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:49,276
The true guardians
of this world

939
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,650
are the people themselves.

940
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:54,701
I know you see what
the Kirin Tor cannot.

941
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:56,616
It's why you left them.

942
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:58,874
No one

943
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:02,498
can stand against the darkness

944
01:15:02,582 --> 01:15:03,922
alone.

945
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,460
I don't understand
what you want me to do.

946
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,590
Yes, you do.

947
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,762
Trust in your friends.

948
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:20,308
Together

949
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:21,981
you can save this world.

950
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:24,903
Always remember,

951
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:27,519
from light comes darkness

952
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:29,017
and from darkness...

953
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,065
Light.

954
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:43,580
Up, up.

955
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,383
Thank you, Moroes.

956
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,130
You'll recover, Guardian.

957
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:57,969
You always do.

958
01:15:58,679 --> 01:15:59,929
No.

959
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,055
Thank you.

960
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,689
For everything you've done.

961
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:24,121
I'm sorry, old friend.

962
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:30,041
Seems that I have let
the orcs into this world.

963
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,796
The Fel, it has twisted me.

964
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:37,465
I don't even know what
else I may have done.

965
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:42,264
I just don't remember.

966
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:50,313
Everything I've
thought to protect, I have...

967
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,357
Destroyed.

968
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:55,858
I can't control the Fel.

969
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:01,027
No one can.

970
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:15,712
KING LLANE: Five legions
to block Deadwind Pass.

971
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:20,551
Another 10 here,
here, and here,
along Redridge Mountains.

972
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,970
Supply lines here.

973
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:25,138
While the Eastern
Sea hems them in
both south and east.

974
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:30,062
If we hold these
positions, we will
be at our strongest.

975
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,310
Containment.

976
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,151
Until there is
a better option, yes.

977
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:37,607
And when there's
10 times as many?
What then?

978
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:41,202
If there were
easy answers...

979
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:44,162
Our priority must be
to stop the gate
from opening.

980
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,575
Fail there, and it's
just a matter of time

981
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:48,504
before they beat us
with sheer numbers.

982
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:50,251
What do you suggest?

983
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Send everything
we've got.

984
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,253
Destroy the gate,
free our people

985
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,759
and end the
immediate threat.

986
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,223
And the orcs that remain?

987
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:00,432
We'll take care
of them later.

988
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:02,643
After they've ravaged
the entire kingdom.

989
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:04,222
My lords.

990
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:06,005
KING LLANE: Medivh,
you are up and well.

991
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,518
I am.

992
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,930
I feel...

993
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:10,805
Restored.

994
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,098
KING LLANE: We need you.

995
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,021
We've been
agonizing over
our options.

996
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,270
Some of us believe
there are no options.

997
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:17,822
We need fresh eyes.
I have news.

998
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,244
I met with Durotan.

999
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:21,914
You met with Durotan?

1000
01:18:22,073 --> 01:18:23,623
MEDIVH: The rebellion
against Gul'Dan

1001
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:26,203
is gaining strength.

1002
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:28,365
With their help,
we can destroy
this gate.

1003
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:29,834
That doesn't change
my plan.

1004
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:30,914
MEDIVH: What plan?

1005
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:34,043
Anduin believes
we should attack
with full force.

1006
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,746
I'm concerned it
leaves the rest of the
kingdom defenseless.

1007
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,377
MEDIVH: How many
legions would you need

1008
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:39,924
to hold the orcs in place?

1009
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,549
Five for
Deadwind Pass.

1010
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:43,968
10 for the Redridge
Mountains,

1011
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,183
10 more to
protect the city.

1012
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:47,466
We've already
lost 18 legions.

1013
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,970
That leaves one,
two, three.

1014
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,179
Can it be done, Medivh?

1015
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:53,479
LOTHAR: No, it can't be done.

1016
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,401
With three legions,
Frostwolves
and my power...

1017
01:18:57,817 --> 01:18:59,477
With all due respect,
Guardian your powers

1018
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:01,322
have proven
unreliable at best,
recently.

1019
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:03,405
Llane, have I ever
let you down?

1020
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:04,531
LOTHAR: Let him down?

1021
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:06,828
Where have you even been
for the last six years?

1022
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,160
Please, Anduin...

1023
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:10,285
Medivh is the Guardian.

1024
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,251
Not the one
you remember.

1025
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,165
He's lost!

1026
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:15,333
He's unstable!

1027
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:17,501
And he won't be there
when you really need him.

1028
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,673
Find your bearings,
Anduin.

1029
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:21,839
I would march
into Hell for you

1030
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:24,587
if I thought there was
the slightest
chance of victory.

1031
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:27,097
But there isn't.
This is suicide.

1032
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:28,219
Is this about Callan?

1033
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,600
It was a tragedy.

1034
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:34,444
If he hadn't
been trying so hard
to win your approval

1035
01:19:34,562 --> 01:19:35,772
he might still
be with us today.

1036
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,106
Medivh.

1037
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,113
Callan wasn't ready,
you knew it.

1038
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:40,855
And you let him
play soldier anyway.

1039
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:42,356
Anduin, stop! No!

1040
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:43,528
You killed him!

1041
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:44,777
Just save it!

1042
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:46,277
Commander, please, sir!
Please!

1043
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:47,777
KING LLANE: Varis.

1044
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,537
Take him to
a cell to calm down.

1045
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,664
You are no use
to us like this.

1046
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,968
MEDIVH: We'll protect
the kingdom, my lord.

1047
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,051
You and l.

(GATE OPENS)

1049
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:24,614
Why are you here?

1050
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:26,240
The King.

1051
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:29,156
He goes to fight
the Horde.

1052
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:33,039
With your Guardian's help

1053
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,079
Durotan will kill Gul'Dan.

1054
01:20:35,206 --> 01:20:36,456
Don't trust him.

1055
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,212
I have told you,
orcs do not lie.

1056
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:39,667
Not Durotan.

1057
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:44,842
Don't trust Medivh.

1058
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,425
I will try to
protect your king.

1059
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,100
Don't go with them.

1060
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:55,430
Why?

1061
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:00,225
I don't want you
to get hurt.

1062
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:15,871
Come back alive.

1063
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,633
MAN 1: Free us.
WOMAN 1: We're thirsty!

1064
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,390
MAN 2: Spare us! Spare us!

1065
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,773
WOMAN 2: Please!
We need your help!

1066
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:40,442
ORC GUARD: Hey! Frostwolf!

1067
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:45,976
Now, you're
enemies with all sides.

1068
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:47,741
I'll tell them
it was you.

(GROANS)

1070
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:03,539
What happened?

1071
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:08,125
I'm sorry, Durotan.

1072
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:12,261
I did not see
how we could side
with the humans,

1073
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,224
against our own kind.

1074
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,184
I was wrong.

1075
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,353
Gul'Dan's Fel
magic is destroying us.

1076
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:31,275
Where's Draka?
Safe.

1077
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:33,359
But the rest...

1078
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:39,865
They wouldn't follow him
if they could see
what he has become.

1079
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,381
Then I'll show them.

1080
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,147
There is no other
man I would entrust

1081
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,990
the safety of my
family to, Varian.

1082
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:18,368
Keep them safe
while I'm gone.

1083
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:33,127
Ready?

1084
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,719
I would feel better
if Lothar were
riding with us.

1085
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:38,434
We'll be fine.

1086
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,684
I will return to Karazhan,
get ready for battle.

1087
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:44,352
Find me at the portal.

1088
01:23:58,283 --> 01:23:59,743
KHADGAR: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1089
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:06,325
Psst.

1090
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:08,079
Guard!

1091
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:12,634
I know you're
just doing your job.
And a good one at that.

1092
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:15,683
But I've cooled down now.

1093
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,761
So, if you'd just come
and open this gate...

1094
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:20,845
So I can protect the King.

1095
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:25,563
(YELLING)
Open the gates!

1096

Where the hell
have you been?
The Kirin Tor.

It only works on

Sorry.

They have a full
day ahead of us.

1103
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:53,296
I just hope
we're not too late.

1104
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:54,422
We can't go after them.

1105
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,173
Not if you want
to save Azeroth.

1106
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,338
My King needs me!
Azeroth needs you more!

1107
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:02,761
If you want to save your King,
we need to stop Medivh first.

you are the son of
