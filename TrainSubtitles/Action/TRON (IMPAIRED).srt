[ MCP ] I was planning to
hit the Pentagon next week.

The Pentagon?

302
00:24:21,487 --> 00:24:24,285
It shouldn't be harder
than any other big company.

303
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:27,165
But now this is what I get
for using humans.

Wait a minute.
I wrote you!

00:55:36,806 --> 00:55:40,242
30, 56, 99
are correct.

608
00:55:40,326 --> 00:55:43,636
Limited four and eight
are missing.

609
00:55:48,246 --> 00:55:51,602
Don't scream.
Yori!

610
00:55:51,686 --> 00:55:54,154
30, 56, 99
are correct.

611
00:55:54,246 --> 00:55:56,555
Limited four and eight
are missing.

612
00:55:56,646 --> 00:55:58,477
No, I--

613
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:02,997
Tron!

614
00:56:03,086 --> 00:56:05,475
Oh!

615
00:56:05,566 --> 00:56:08,000
Yori.

616
00:56:09,046 --> 00:56:11,924
I knew you'd escape.

617
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:14,440
They haven't built a circuit
that could hold you.

618
00:56:14,526 --> 00:56:17,677
Listen!
We have to make plans.

619
00:56:17,766 --> 00:56:20,075
Where can we go?

620
00:56:24,606 --> 00:56:27,074
This way, quickly.

621
00:56:33,886 --> 00:56:35,763
Hey!

622
00:56:38,406 --> 00:56:40,795
Hold it right there!

623
00:56:40,886 --> 00:56:42,797
- Yes?
<i>- What do you mean, "yes"?</i>

624
00:56:42,886 --> 00:56:44,717
Yes.

625
00:56:44,806 --> 00:56:47,718
Is that all
you can say?

626
00:56:48,806 --> 00:56:50,637
No.

627
00:56:50,726 --> 00:56:53,365
- Anything else?
<i>- Yes.</i>

628
00:56:55,326 --> 00:56:57,521
Positive and negative, huh?
You're a bit.

629
00:56:57,606 --> 00:57:00,245
<i>Yes.</i>

630
00:57:00,326 --> 00:57:02,886
Where's your program?
Isn't he gonna miss you?

631
00:57:02,966 --> 00:57:06,481
- No.
- I'm your program.

632
00:57:06,566 --> 00:57:10,241
- Yes.
- Another mouth to feed.

633
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:13,716
<i>Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes!</i>

634
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:24,404
Watch out
for nested macros.

635
00:57:26,246 --> 00:57:28,885
- Who are these weirdos?
- Inoperative data pushers.

636
00:57:28,966 --> 00:57:31,526
[ Tron ]
Control programs! Come on.

637
00:57:32,886 --> 00:57:35,275
Pretty good drivin',
huh? Oh!

638
00:57:38,846 --> 00:57:42,600
<i>- [ Bit ] No!</i>
- Who asked you?

639
00:57:51,686 --> 00:57:54,041
<i>[ Warning Siren ]</i>

640
00:57:56,326 --> 00:57:58,965
<i>[ Bit ]</i>
<i>No-no-no-no!</i>

641
00:57:59,046 --> 00:58:01,685
Aah!

642
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:19,920
- This baby doesn't
handle so good in town.
<i>- No.</i>

643
00:58:23,526 --> 00:58:26,165
- What's this do?
How 'bout this one?
<i>- No. No.</i>

644
00:58:28,326 --> 00:58:30,965
<i>[ Flynn ]</i>
<i>Here comes a headache.</i>

645
00:58:32,806 --> 00:58:35,240
- Aah!
<i>- No-no-no-no!</i>

646
00:58:37,766 --> 00:58:40,644
- We gotta stop this thing!
<i>- Yes!</i>

647
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:44,002
<i>[ Flynn ]</i>
<i>I'm glad you agree!</i>

648
00:59:04,806 --> 00:59:07,639
Uh, I'm fine.
No problem.

649
00:59:10,606 --> 00:59:13,643
Oh, this town
is full of live ones.

650
00:59:25,526 --> 00:59:27,801
This is where Tron
said he was going.

651
00:59:30,726 --> 00:59:32,842
Losing Flynn.

652
01:00:01,486 --> 01:00:03,556
I don't believe this.

653
01:00:14,846 --> 01:00:16,359
Halt!

654
01:00:23,606 --> 01:00:25,437
More guards.

655
01:01:19,006 --> 01:01:21,964
They don't see us.
I'll go first.

656
01:01:43,686 --> 01:01:45,517
Are you all right?

657
01:01:45,606 --> 01:01:47,801
Yeah. Let's do
that some more.

658
01:01:47,886 --> 01:01:49,842
I think the guard saw me.

659
01:01:49,926 --> 01:01:51,803
Come on!

660
01:01:58,246 --> 01:02:01,443
- Halt.
- Dumont.

661
01:02:01,526 --> 01:02:03,915
I can't stand this commotion.
What do you want?

662
01:02:04,006 --> 01:02:06,236
I've come to communicate
with my User.

663
01:02:06,326 --> 01:02:10,683
Difficult proposition.
Difficult proposition at best.

664
01:02:10,766 --> 01:02:13,678
<i>Why, I could be de-rezzed</i>
<i>just for letting you in here.</i>

665
01:02:13,766 --> 01:02:18,965
They hate this tower.
They'd close it down if they dared.

666
01:02:19,046 --> 01:02:20,957
They keep me around
just in case one of them...

667
01:02:21,046 --> 01:02:23,514
wants to deal with the other world
once in a while.

668
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:26,484
Dumont!

669
01:02:26,566 --> 01:02:30,479
My User has information
that could--

670
01:02:30,566 --> 01:02:32,796
could make this
a free system again.

671
01:02:32,886 --> 01:02:34,478
- [ Chuckle ]
<i>- No, really!</i>

672
01:02:34,566 --> 01:02:38,161
You'd have programs
lined up to use this place,

673
01:02:38,246 --> 01:02:40,885
and no MCP looking
over your shoulder.

674
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,082
When you've been in the system
as long as I have,

675
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:45,316
you hear many promises,
many reassurances,

676
01:02:45,406 --> 01:02:48,239
<i>- many brave plans.</i>
- Please, Dumont!

677
01:02:49,606 --> 01:02:52,723
The guards are coming.

678
01:02:52,806 --> 01:02:54,762
There they are
with the guardian.

679
01:02:54,846 --> 01:02:57,235
All right, Yori.
All right.

680
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,994
Who is your User, program?

681
01:03:03,686 --> 01:03:05,517
Alan-1 .

682
01:03:05,606 --> 01:03:07,756
He calls me.
May I pass?

683
01:03:07,846 --> 01:03:10,804
All that is visible...

684
01:03:10,886 --> 01:03:13,036
must grow beyond itself,

685
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:15,765
and extend into
the realm of the invisible.

686
01:03:15,846 --> 01:03:18,724
You may pass, my friend.

687
01:03:27,766 --> 01:03:30,234
The tower guardian
is helping him.

688
01:03:30,326 --> 01:03:32,317
He thinks.

689
01:03:32,406 --> 01:03:34,556
Bring in
the logic probe.

690
01:03:51,486 --> 01:03:54,523
<i>[ Sark ]</i>
<i>More power!</i>

691
01:04:52,406 --> 01:04:54,237
It's begun.

692
01:04:55,646 --> 01:04:58,114
<i>[ Alan ]</i>
<i>Tron, location query. Confirm.</i>

693
01:04:58,206 --> 01:05:00,356
Confirmed, Alan-1.

694
01:05:00,446 --> 01:05:02,482
<i>[ Alan ] I am creating</i>
<i>the information on your disk...</i>

695
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:06,115

<i>and change the system.</i>

696
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:08,162
<i>Dedicate yourself to getting</i>
<i>the disk into the heart...</i>

697
01:05:08,246 --> 01:05:10,077
<i>of the MCP.</i>

698
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:12,521
<i>This interface is</i>
<i>located at its base.</i>

699
01:05:12,606 --> 01:05:16,519
<i>We will not be able to communicate</i>
<i>again unless you succeed.</i>

700
01:05:16,606 --> 01:05:18,437
<i>Go!</i>

701
01:05:28,046 --> 01:05:31,118
This is the key
to a new order.

702
01:05:31,206 --> 01:05:34,994
This code disk
means freedom.

703
01:05:36,326 --> 01:05:39,079
I think they're
breaking in.

704
01:05:46,486 --> 01:05:49,523
- Thank you, Dumont.
- Hurry! The Users are waiting.

705
01:06:04,286 --> 01:06:05,958
[ Sark ]
Dumont?

706
01:06:09,246 --> 01:06:11,919
Where's the program?

707
01:06:12,006 --> 01:06:13,997
What program?

708
01:06:15,366 --> 01:06:17,243
Take him!

709
01:06:26,326 --> 01:06:28,556
Stay close.

710
01:06:37,686 --> 01:06:41,565
If I can just get us
on the scanning transport beam,

711
01:06:41,646 --> 01:06:45,195
this solar sail simulation
will take us across the game sea,

712
01:06:45,286 --> 01:06:47,356
out of this domain,
back into the central computer.

713
01:06:55,366 --> 01:06:57,197
Look out!

714
01:07:05,086 --> 01:07:07,316
Aah!

715
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:13,317
Aah!

716
01:08:14,086 --> 01:08:18,637

<i>I wonder how you'd take to</i>
<i>working in a pocket calculator.</i>

718
01:08:22,526 --> 01:08:24,756
We did take care of

<i>in a stolen simulation.</i>

721
01:08:30,566 --> 01:08:34,275
We'll get them.
It's only a matter of time.

722
01:08:34,366 --> 01:08:36,880
You've almost reached
your decision gate,

<i>Barely.</i>
<i>Yeah, I, uh--</i>

728

Where's Ram?

729
01:09:14,406 --> 01:09:16,601
He didn't make it.

730
01:09:25,206 --> 01:09:27,037
Come on.

01:09:39,526 --> 01:09:42,324
Lora.

This is Flynn.
The one who busted me out.

733
01:09:45,446 --> 01:09:46,799
Lora?

734
01:09:46,886 --> 01:09:49,320
Well, then I
owe him some thanks.

735
01:09:51,446 --> 01:09:54,199
<i>No, it's, uh,</i>
<i>no big deal.</i>

736
01:09:54,286 --> 01:09:57,198
I ought to know my way around
the Lightcycle. I wrote the program.

737
01:09:57,286 --> 01:10:00,244
- You wrote the program?
<i>- It's time I level with you.</i>

738
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:04,399
- I'm what you guys call a User.
- You're a User?

739
01:10:04,486 --> 01:10:06,442
I took a wrong turn
somewhere.

740
01:10:06,526 --> 01:10:08,994
If you are a User,

741
01:10:09,086 --> 01:10:11,122
everything you've done has been
according to a plan, right?

742
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:13,276
[ Laughs ]
You wish.

743
01:10:13,366 --> 01:10:16,199
<i>You guys know</i>
<i>what it's like.</i>

744
01:10:16,286 --> 01:10:19,437
You keep doing what it looks
like you're supposed to,
no matter how crazy it seems.

745
01:10:19,526 --> 01:10:22,165
That's the way it is
for programs, yes.

746
01:10:22,246 --> 01:10:26,000
Hate to disappoint you, pal,
but most of the time, that's
the way it is for Users too.

747
01:10:26,086 --> 01:10:28,520
Stranger and stranger.

748
01:10:28,606 --> 01:10:31,996
So, nice-looking ship
you got here.

749
01:10:50,886 --> 01:10:53,400
What do you want done with
the tower guardian-- Dumont?

750
01:10:53,486 --> 01:10:55,681
Put him with
the others?

751
01:10:55,766 --> 01:10:58,326
No, bit brain, prepare
him for inquisition.

752
01:10:58,406 --> 01:11:00,237
I need a little bit
of relaxation.

753
01:11:00,326 --> 01:11:02,203
First, rezz up
the carrier for pursuit.

754
01:11:02,286 --> 01:11:05,323
One other thing.
Don't think any more.

755
01:11:05,406 --> 01:11:07,522
I do the thinking
around here.

756
01:11:13,046 --> 01:11:14,877
<i>[ Yori ]</i>

Busy dying, you worn out

Yes, I'm old.

01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:53,355
Old enough to remember the MCP
when it was a chess program.

763
01:11:53,446 --> 01:11:55,914
<i>He started small,</i>
<i>and he'll end small.</i>

764
01:11:56,006 --> 01:11:59,965
Very funny, Dumont. Maybe I should
keep you around just to make me laugh.

765
01:12:10,366 --> 01:12:12,721
- What's happening?
- Power surge in the MCP.

766
01:12:12,806 --> 01:12:15,081
<i>- We have to get off this beam.</i>
- I can't.

767
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:17,202
There isn't another junction
for seven or eight nanoseconds.

768
01:12:18,326 --> 01:12:20,521
- There's another beam!
- It's too far.

769
01:12:39,006 --> 01:12:40,564
He's creating a junction.

770
01:13:02,406 --> 01:13:04,397
Did we make it?

771
01:13:04,486 --> 01:13:06,317
Yeah.

772
01:13:06,406 --> 01:13:08,442
Hooray for our side.

773
01:13:31,646 --> 01:13:33,796
Is he de-rezzing?

774
01:13:33,886 --> 01:13:36,958
<i>No, but I couldn't</i>
<i>tell you why not.</i>

775
01:13:39,606 --> 01:13:42,518
I'm all in one piece.

776
01:13:42,606 --> 01:13:44,676
I guess
I'm still with you.

777
01:13:46,486 --> 01:13:50,081
[ Groans ] Tell the guy
with the jackhammer to lay off.

778
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:52,999
- How'd you do that?
- Elementary physics--

779
01:13:53,086 --> 01:13:54,917
a beam of energy
can always be diverted.

780
01:13:55,006 --> 01:13:57,122
Are we there yet, Mommy?

781
01:14:49,246 --> 01:14:51,282
Sark!

782
01:15:04,726 --> 01:15:07,240
- Dumont!
- Yori!

783
01:15:08,966 --> 01:15:10,877
Tron?

784
01:15:12,486 --> 01:15:14,681
Tron's dead.

785
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:19,844
<i>- Who's that?</i>
<i>- That is a User, Dumont.</i>

786
01:15:19,926 --> 01:15:23,282
He came here to help us.

787
01:15:23,366 --> 01:15:26,642
<i>Tron believed in him.</i>

788
01:15:27,846 --> 01:15:30,963
If the Users can no longer
help us, we're lost.

789
01:15:31,046 --> 01:15:33,685
So, we have erased
that program--

790
01:15:33,766 --> 01:15:35,563
No.

791
01:15:35,646 --> 01:15:38,319
<i>- You were de-rezzed.</i>
- Not me, Sark.

792
01:15:38,406 --> 01:15:41,523
There's nothing special about you.
You're just an ordinary program.

793
01:15:41,606 --> 01:15:44,200
So are you, one that
should have been erased.

794
01:15:44,286 --> 01:15:46,800
You're nothing.

795
01:15:46,886 --> 01:15:49,798
Take that program
to the holding pit.

796
01:15:58,006 --> 01:16:00,566
Please, don't take--

797
01:16:00,646 --> 01:16:02,477
<i>I'm taking</i>
<i>our friend here...</i>

798
01:16:02,566 --> 01:16:05,399
and some other religious
fanatics to Master Control.

799
01:16:07,006 --> 01:16:08,837
When I disembark,

800
01:16:08,926 --> 01:16:11,804
this ship and everything
that remains on board...

801
01:16:11,886 --> 01:16:14,320
will automatically de-rezz.

802
01:16:16,726 --> 01:16:19,445
This means you.

803
01:16:24,966 --> 01:16:26,797
Move on!

804
01:16:53,726 --> 01:16:56,035
Immediate vectors
detached.

805
01:16:56,126 --> 01:16:57,957
Route us
to the MCP.

806
01:16:58,046 --> 01:17:00,321
I want to get rid
of this dead weight,

807
01:17:00,406 --> 01:17:02,874
<i>and catch a transport beam</i>
<i>to the game domain.</i>

808
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:15,637
These walls--
Yori, something's happening.

809
01:18:14,086 --> 01:18:15,917
Hey.

810
01:18:17,246 --> 01:18:20,204
You all right?

811
01:18:20,286 --> 01:18:22,675
I still have power.
Sark doesn't know that.

812
01:18:24,126 --> 01:18:25,957
Leave me alone.
We've failed.

813
01:18:26,046 --> 01:18:29,482
We're only gonna fail if we give up!
Come on, look, the wall!

814
01:18:31,526 --> 01:18:33,323
Yori.

815
01:18:41,046 --> 01:18:43,879
You brought me back.

816
01:18:43,966 --> 01:18:47,038
How? Why did
you bring me back?

817
01:18:47,126 --> 01:18:49,242
I need your help.
Come on!

818
01:19:17,846 --> 01:19:19,757
Do something with
these controls!

819
01:19:19,846 --> 01:19:22,201
I'm on it.

820
01:19:22,286 --> 01:19:24,163
The MCP, it's the heart
of the whole system.

821
01:19:47,206 --> 01:19:50,755
I feel a presence.
Another warrior is on the mesa.

822
01:19:53,646 --> 01:19:55,477
<i>[ Tron ]</i>
<i>Sark!</i>

823
01:19:57,966 --> 01:20:00,639
We're getting closer.

824
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:05,997
I don't know
how you survived.

825
01:20:06,086 --> 01:20:09,078
<i>Slave,</i>
<i>it doesn't matter.</i>

826
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:12,283
Prepare to terminate.

827
01:20:23,726 --> 01:20:26,843
<i>All programs have</i>
<i>a desire to be useful.</i>

828
01:20:26,926 --> 01:20:29,679
But in moments, you will
no longer seek communication...

829
01:20:29,766 --> 01:20:33,395
<i>with each other or</i>
<i>your superfluous Users.</i>

830
01:20:33,486 --> 01:20:37,115
You will each be part of me.
Together, we will be complete.

831
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:47,039
<i>You should havejoined me.</i>
<i>We'd have made a great team.</i>

832
01:20:50,766 --> 01:20:53,997
- You're very persistent.
- I'm also better than you.

833
01:21:07,846 --> 01:21:09,996
<i>[ MCP]</i>
<i>Sark?</i>

834
01:21:10,086 --> 01:21:13,795
<i>All my functions are</i>
<i>now yours. Take them.</i>

835
01:21:15,726 --> 01:21:17,205
Sark?

836
01:21:20,846 --> 01:21:22,518
Sark?

837
01:21:28,366 --> 01:21:30,755
Look at that!

838
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:48,841
Your User can't help you now,
my little program.

839
01:21:59,406 --> 01:22:01,681
I got it.
Steer us over by the beam.

840
01:22:01,766 --> 01:22:03,757
<i>Right next to it.</i>

841
01:22:03,846 --> 01:22:06,235
What good will that do?

842
01:22:06,326 --> 01:22:08,203
I'm gonna jump.

843
01:22:09,646 --> 01:22:11,796
It's the only way
to help Tron.

844
01:22:11,886 --> 01:22:13,763
Don't.
You'll be de-rezzed.

845
01:22:31,726 --> 01:22:33,637
Don't worry.

846
01:23:38,126 --> 01:23:41,118
Come on, let's go!

847
01:24:21,966 --> 01:24:23,957
We did it!

848
01:24:32,726 --> 01:24:34,557
That's nice.

849
01:24:34,646 --> 01:24:37,558
We thought you
were dead.

850
01:24:37,646 --> 01:24:39,796
- Where's Flynn?
- It was incredible.

851
01:24:39,886 --> 01:24:42,275
He threw himself into the beam
and distracted the MCP...

852
01:24:42,366 --> 01:24:45,324
just long enough for you
to get the disk in.

853
01:24:45,406 --> 01:24:48,045
He saved us.
He really did it.

854
01:24:48,126 --> 01:24:50,959
<i>Video warriors,</i>
<i>look at the I/ O towers.</i>

855
01:24:53,326 --> 01:24:56,079

856
01:25:47,406 --> 01:25:49,442
<i>Priority one!</i>

857
01:25:52,526 --> 01:25:54,562
[ Laughing ]

858
01:26:44,006 --> 01:26:46,759
Try to look official.
Here comes the boss.

859
01:27:02,806 --> 01:27:05,718
Pick me up in an hour.
Thanks.

860
01:27:05,806 --> 01:27:08,195
Greetings, programs.
