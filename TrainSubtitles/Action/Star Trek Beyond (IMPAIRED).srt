My name is Captain James Tiberius Kirk.

00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:15,653
United Federation of Planets

3
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:19,347
I came here before you as a neutral representative

4
00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:21,432
of the Fabonane Republic.

5
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:23,781
And bring you a message of good will

6
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:27,259
And present to you, esteemed members of the teenaxiene delegation

7
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:32,278
A gift from Fabonan
High Council with the highest regard.

8
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:36,915
What's wrong with it?

9
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:40,435
- Excuse me?
- Why the don't they want it anymore?

10
00:01:40,936 --> 00:01:41,776
Well...

11
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,139
This was once a piece of an ancient weapon

12
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,225
And now they offer it as a symbol, of...

13
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:48,070
... of peace.

14
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:51,075
In the Fabonan culture
this surrendal weapon

15
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:52,147
is an offer of truth.

16
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:53,663
How they got it?

17
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,161
They told me, they acquired it
long time ago.

18
00:01:56,162 --> 00:01:57,769
So they stole it, then!

19
00:01:58,232 --> 00:02:00,631
No, uhm...

20
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:04,136
It's not like they were familiar with the Fabonan.
I know us.

21
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:06,630
You have a point.
Your excellency, this gift...

22
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:09,094
There are a nations of thieves

23
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,756
who want to kill us.

24
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:15,610
This beloved artifact is a symbol of trust and peace.

25
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:19,499
You will cut us into pieces,
and roast us over a fire...

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,600
I do not think that's true...

27
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:22,657
... and eat us !!

28
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:25,596
What?

29
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,848
Scotty, get me out of here!

30
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,323
<i>Well, that was quick.</i>

31
00:02:53,402 --> 00:02:56,034
<i>There are many
interference on the surface, sir.</i>

32
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:12,485
I ripped my shirt again.

33
00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:14,365
How'd it go?

34
00:03:16,808 --> 00:03:19,276
Captain, did you manage to broke
a treaty with diplomacy?

35
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:21,545
Let's just say we came out short.

36
00:03:21,593 --> 00:03:26,250
You look... move this back into the vault, Spock.
Thank you.

37
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:29,070
- Jim, you look like crap.
- Thank you, Bones.

38
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:31,632
You have a little vein popin out of your tremble again. You okay?

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,757
It's better.
It's just a another day in fleet.

43

<i>More time you spend out here, the harder it is</i>

44

<i>to tell when one day ends and the next one begins.</i>

45
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:10,426
<i>It can be a challenge

46

70
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:39,355
<i>...not from mysteries, the unknown.</i>

71
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:55,891
Sorry, I'm late.

72
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:58,710
Keenser's weakend by some hallious seed green flu...

73
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:01,632
...and Scotty is terrified, he's gonna sneeze on warp core

74
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,107

What the hell are you drink?

76
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:09,385
Pretty sure it's the rest of that Saurian brandy
we picked up on Thasus.

77
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,152
My god man! Are you trying to go blind?

78

That stuff's illegal.

79
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:18,527
Besides, I found this in Chekov's locker.

80
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:20,283
Wow!

81
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:22,459
Right, I mean I always assumed he would be Vodka guy...

82
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,402
Vodka guy. Exactly.

83
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:27,303
I wanted to have something appropriate for your birthday.

84
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:30,091
It's a couple of days, you know I don't care about that.

85
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:32,898
I know. You don't like celebrating it to on the day...

86
00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:35,595
...because it's also the day your pop bit the dust.

87
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:36,865
I was being sensitive.

88
00:06:36,884 --> 00:06:39,975
Did they teach you about better manner at medical school?

89
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:42,927
Or it's just a sudden charm?

90
00:06:54,271 --> 00:06:56,100
- It's good.
- Hordy.

91
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,608
You're gonna call your mom?

92
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,809
Yeah, of course I'll call on the day.

93
00:07:06,544 --> 00:07:08,061
I'm an year older.

94
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:11,044
Yeah, that's usually how it works.

95
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:15,301
A year older than he ever got to be.

96
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:20,490
He joined the Starfleet because he...

97
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,441
...he believed in it.

98
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:26,861
I joined on a dare.

99
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:30,609
You joined this if you can live up to him.

100
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:35,245
It's been all this time, you are trying to be George Kirk...

101
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:38,620
...and now you're wondering just what it means to be Jim...

102
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:40,704
...why you're out here.

103
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:46,708
To prove that aside and a full head of hair.

104
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,743
- Kirk here.
- Captain.

105
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:56,698
- Approaching Yorktown base.
- I'm on my way, Mr. Sulu.

106
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:00,833

Mr. Sensitive.

108

Aaah, that is impressive.

109
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:13,550
Aye. She is a beauty, isn't she?

110
00:08:13,897 --> 00:08:16,143
What a damn monstrosity.

111
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:18,300
Can't we just wrap some space on a planet?

112
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:21,334
Sharing geographical favouritism among conducted Federation worlds

113
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:23,091
could cause diplomatic tension.

114
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:24,692
Oh, you don't think that looks tense?

115
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:28,044
Looks like a damn snow globe in space
just waiting to break.

116

00:09:57,427 --> 00:09:58,511
Of course, Nyota.

120
00:09:59,376 --> 00:10:01,471

121

123
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:08,992

We were on a science mission
inside the nebula.

145
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:07,004
Our ship suffered a critical malfunction.

162
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,417
here at this installation.

163
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,885
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:15,192
If I may, I would recommend
Commander Spock...

165
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:17,231
to replace me as a Captain of the Enteprise.

166
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:21,972
He is an exemplary Starfleet officer.
He'll make a great Captain.

167
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:25,649
It isn't uncommon, you know.

168
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:29,878
Even for a captain,
to want to leave.

169
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:34,341
There's no relative direction
in the vastness of space...

170
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:37,256
...there's only yourself.

171
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:39,627
Your ship, your crew.

172
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:44,127
It's easier than you think to get lost.

173
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:46,553
I'll really talk with the General Council.

174
00:14:46,588 --> 00:14:48,170
We'll discuss it, when you return.

175
00:15:00,758 --> 00:15:02,547
- Mr. Spock.
- Captain.

176
00:15:05,142 --> 00:15:06,316
- I have something...
- Perhaps there...

177
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:09,373
- No, please.
- Captain, after you.

178
00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:10,924
I insist.

179
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:14,100
After this mission, we should...

180
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:17,075
...we should sit down.
There is something I need to talk about.

181
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:19,082
I, as well, have something to share.

182
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:26,970
We make a good team, right?

183
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:30,708
I believe we do.

184
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:36,334
I insist.

185
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:57,307
Lt. Uhura, open a ship wide channel.

186
00:15:57,313 --> 00:15:58,337
Yes, Captain.

187
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,765
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.

188
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,696
Our mission is straightforward.

189
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,974
The rescue of a crew stranded
on a planet in uncharted space.

190
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:14,442
Our trajectory will take us through
 an unstable nebula...

191
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:17,929
...one which will disable
all communication with Starfleet.

192
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:20,433
We will be on our own.

193
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,069
The Enteprise has something no other ship
in the fleet has.

194
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:26,245
You.

195
00:16:27,214 --> 00:16:30,847
As we can't understand
there's no such space, the unknown.

196
00:16:32,598 --> 00:16:34,876
We'll be temporarily hidden.

197
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:36,573
Kirk out.

198
00:16:56,094 --> 00:16:59,318
Readings indicate
cloud density deminishing, sir.

199
00:17:03,503 --> 00:17:06,270
This is Altamid.
Our ship is stranded here.

200
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,173
Approaching Altamid.

201
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,879
Class M planet.

202
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:29,126
Massive subterranean fauna, with unlimited
unknown life forms on the surface...

203
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:30,637
Proximity alert, sir.

204
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:32,820
We have an unknown ship heading right on us.

205
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:34,313
- Lt. Uhura, hail them.
- Yes, Captain.

206
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:41,712
No response.

207
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:43,874
I have readings on some kind of a signal.

208
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:48,617
They are jamming us.

209
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:51,082
Magnify, Mr. Sulu.

210
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:58,413
What is this?

211
00:18:01,604 --> 00:18:03,204
Shields up! Red alert!

212
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,017
Fire at will!

213
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,442
Sir, our phasers are having minimal effect

214
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,346
and our torpedoes can't track the movement.

215
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:23,847
Fire everything we've got.

216
00:18:23,848 --> 00:18:26,290
Captain, we are not equipped
for this matteral engadgement.

217
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:39,171
Shields frequency has no effect, sir.

218
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:40,372
They got the DITCH.

219
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:41,805
Shields are offline.

220
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,477
- Get us out of here, Mr. Sulu.
- Yes, sir.

221
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:56,597
- Why the hell aren't we moving?
- I can not engage the warp drive, sir.

222
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:02,528
Scotty, I need warp now.

223
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,838
I can not, sir.

224
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:16,528
...they are gone.

225
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:20,101
Security, engage
all emergency procedures.

226
00:19:22,636 --> 00:19:24,769
All personnel to emergency stations.

227
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:49,824
I have hull breaches in levels 12 to 15,

228
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:53,326
6, 9, 31 and 21, sir.

229
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:56,644
Captain, in a 10 sec I could reroute
the energy from the warp core

230
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:58,388
to the impulse engines.

231
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,188
Evacuating have no need,
we have to do it.

232
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,834
Do whatever you have to, Scotty.

233
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:04,411
Keenser let's go.

234
00:20:29,193 --> 00:20:30,647
The door is opened, Krall.

235
00:21:13,835 --> 00:21:16,647
Connecting plasma pipes,
stand by then you start it on my mark!

236
00:21:31,314 --> 00:21:35,802
Missing piece of Abornath.
Weapon will be complete.

237
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:42,111
- Captain.
- Aye, Spock.

238
00:21:42,123 --> 00:21:45,534
We have an unidentified intruders,
with an attack party.

239
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:48,326
They infiltrated the archive vault,
and removed the artifact

240
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:49,539
from our mission on Teenax.

241
00:21:49,595 --> 00:21:50,916
*something*

242
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:53,895
Spock! Spock!

243
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:57,012
You two, with me.
Sulu, you are commanding officer.

244
00:21:57,013 --> 00:21:58,113
Yes, sir.

245
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:23,301
My god!

246
00:22:27,086 --> 00:22:28,350
...the hell?

247
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,380
Doctor?

248
00:22:36,915 --> 00:22:38,755
Doctor, we must evacuate now!

249
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:18,033
Captain

250
00:23:18,257 --> 00:23:20,257
Kirk

251
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,273
Yes!
We have 100% impulse.

252
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:43,078
Great work, Mr. Scott!

253
00:23:43,113 --> 00:23:44,928
Maximum impulse towards the nebula!

254
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:45,981
Aye!

255
00:24:05,174 --> 00:24:06,717
Krall, the ship runs into nebula.

256
00:24:08,252 --> 00:24:10,246
Cut it's neck.

257
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,505
Kirk to bridge.

258
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,616
We are losing the innertial dampers.

259
00:25:23,617 --> 00:25:25,642
Systems are failing throughout the ship, Captain.

260
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:27,440
The emergency blockades are sealing...

261
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:30,710
...but the structural integrity
is at 18% and falling, sir.

262
00:25:31,934 --> 00:25:33,868
Abandon ship, Mr. Sulu.

263
00:25:36,057 --> 00:25:37,741
Sound the alarm.

264
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:45,984
Maybe in those Pods it's a chance to escape

265
00:25:46,185 --> 00:25:47,673
Can you lead the ship to way?

266
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:51,145
The impulse engines are still trying
to draw power from the warp reserve.

267
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,148
We can not move until
the SAUCER is separated.

268
00:25:55,605 --> 00:25:56,798
I'll handle it.

269
00:25:56,803 --> 00:25:58,071
Aye aye, sir.

270
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:14,629
We got to get you guys to escape pod. Go.

271
00:26:15,184 --> 00:26:16,368
Ensign. Syl.

272
00:26:17,948 --> 00:26:19,364
I need your help.

273
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,280
Yes, sir.

274
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:54,784
My god!

275
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:57,112
Spock, they are taking the crew.

276
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:35,611
Are you okay?

277
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:37,008
SAUCER should be free by now.

278
00:27:37,243 --> 00:27:39,679
I know, Mr. Sulu.
The Captain should be there.

279
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,327
<i>SAUCER SEPARATION</i>

280
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:39,141
The impulse engines
drawing power from auxiliary generators.

281
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:50,376
Captain.

282
00:29:53,545 --> 00:29:55,597
How many of the crew is still pod disposal?

283
00:29:57,188 --> 00:29:58,342
None.

284
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,115
If I read this correctly...

285
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:02,813
...the intruders are taking them.

286
00:30:03,173 --> 00:30:05,943
Captain, we're caught
in the planet's gravity.

287
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:08,295
We can not pull away.

288
00:30:13,218 --> 00:30:14,909
Get your damn pods.

289
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,039
- Yes, sir.
- Aye, Captain.

290
00:30:17,074 --> 00:30:18,298
Come on! Let's go!

291
00:33:02,293 --> 00:33:03,293
You knew...

292
00:33:03,318 --> 00:33:05,097
You knew we would be attacked.

293
00:33:05,646 --> 00:33:06,676
You don't understand.

294
00:33:07,605 --> 00:33:08,771
Captain Kirk.

295
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,334
Yes, I lied.

296
00:33:19,045 --> 00:33:21,634
Our ship was attacked.

297
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:25,577
Chekov, check your comms for survivors.

298
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:26,901
Aye aye, aye Captain.

299
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:29,679
- Who is he?
- His name is Krall.

300
00:33:31,265 --> 00:33:34,621
He took my crew,
like he took yours.

301
00:33:35,095 --> 00:33:36,971
How did he know so much
about the Enterprise?

302
00:33:37,006 --> 00:33:40,523
All I know is that if I did this...

303
00:33:42,847 --> 00:33:44,821
...he'll set them free.

304
00:33:45,053 --> 00:33:47,669
Chekov, are you picking
anything upon those scanners?

305
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,709
Nothing.

306
00:33:52,095 --> 00:33:54,260
- What if he...
- No, no.

307
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:56,700
He was taking them.

308
00:33:56,988 --> 00:33:58,845
We have to find that SAUCER even

309
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,096
minimal scanning systems
will have longer range than tricorders.

310
00:34:02,131 --> 00:34:03,871
Aye, Captain. It's possible.

311
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:08,616
Captain, I was protecting my crew.

312
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:09,122
What is your name?

313
00:35:11,448 --> 00:35:13,127
How do you know our language?

314
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:16,386
I know your kind.

315
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:20,794
I'm Lt. Nyota Uhura
of the USS Enteprise.

316
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:23,589
And you have committed an act of war against Fede...

317
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:25,434
Federation.

318
00:35:27,443 --> 00:35:30,590
That always is an act of war.

319
00:35:30,943 --> 00:35:33,333
You've attacked us.

320
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:39,962
Your captain...

321
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:45,137
Why have you sacrificed yourself for him?

322
00:35:45,382 --> 00:35:46,743
He would have done the same.

323
00:35:47,931 --> 00:35:50,994
And if he made it off that ship,
he will come for us.

324
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:57,443
I'm counting on it, Lt. Uhura.

325
00:36:26,755 --> 00:36:28,885
I can't believe it.

326
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,459
My god, Spock!

327
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:46,439
Sit down over here.

328
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,818
Okay, easy, easy.

329
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:56,801
I'll just a...

330
00:36:57,064 --> 00:36:58,736
Try to relax.
Your're going to be okay.

331
00:36:58,737 --> 00:37:00,556
The forced optimism in your voice suggests

332
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:02,906
you are trying to enlist essensive calm in order...

333
00:37:02,907 --> 00:37:04,007
Cut the horse shit.

334
00:37:04,008 --> 00:37:07,424
Doctor. I failed to see
how excrement of any kind feels relevance

335
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:08,875
in our current situation.

336
00:37:09,287 --> 00:37:11,616
- What the hell are you doing?
- We must keep moving, doctor.

337
00:37:11,817 --> 00:37:13,913
Spock, this thing punched your
iliac region.

338
00:37:13,914 --> 00:37:16,452
- Time is a critical factor.
- That's exactly what I am trying to tell you.

339
00:37:16,453 --> 00:37:18,633
Look, I can't take this out.
You are gonna die.

340
00:37:18,868 --> 00:37:21,942
Okay, if I take it out and can't stop
the bleeding, you are gonna die.

341
00:37:22,129 --> 00:37:24,276
I can't see no appealing in neither option.

342
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,012
Yea well believe it or not,
but neither can I.

343
00:37:27,988 --> 00:37:31,084
So, if I remember correctly

344
00:37:32,022 --> 00:37:37,032
Tha uh Vulcans, have their hearts,
where humans have their livers.

345
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:38,353
That is correct, doctor.

346
00:37:39,518 --> 00:37:41,183
That explains some things.

347
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,100
You know, you are lucky.
Two centimeters to the left...

348
00:37:49,787 --> 00:37:51,282
...and you would be dead already.

349
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:54,459
I just don't get it, Spock.

350
00:37:56,248 --> 00:37:58,501
What, what did they attack us for?
I mean...

351
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:03,460
They do all this for some
dude and a tiny crystal we didn't want?

352
00:38:03,495 --> 00:38:07,348
It is unwise to trivialize that
which one simply does not understand, Doctor.

353
00:38:07,808 --> 00:38:10,700
We can simply assume that
it's more important than a douchebag.

354
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:14,025
I think you just managed
to insult me twice, Spock.

355
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:24,858
Alright, Spock.

356
00:38:24,956 --> 00:38:26,829
There's only one question.

357
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,518
- What's your favorite color?
- I failed to see the relevance...

358
00:38:35,495 --> 00:38:37,899
Yeah, they say it hurts less
if it's a surprise.

359
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,530
I made an after part
with which you are familiar...

360
00:38:41,565 --> 00:38:45,168
...I can confirm your theory to be horse shit.

361
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:49,855
We gotta get out of here.

362
00:39:22,304 --> 00:39:24,041
You're kidding me, aren't you?

363
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,827
Hello there.

364
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:33,414
My name is Montgomery Scott...

365
00:39:34,186 --> 00:39:35,550
...and who might you be?

366
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,471
Aren't ya silly,
I am pretty handy when I want you to be *what?*

367
00:40:27,753 --> 00:40:29,265
Don't come back.

368
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:31,984
I am pretty sure they won't show mercy.

369
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,512
Hey! That's not fleet...
You can not just take them and....

370
00:40:35,513 --> 00:40:38,412
I'm back, I'm feeling generous today so have at it.

371
00:40:40,275 --> 00:40:41,445
Where did you get that?

372
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,248
- Is that English?
- I learned it from my house. Where did you get that ?

373
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:46,810
- This is my Starfleet insignia.
- What does it mean ?

374
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:50,245
Means that I am an officer of a Starfleet, 
uh engineering division.

375
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:54,313
- Engineering?
- Aye yes, I fix things.

376
00:40:54,314 --> 00:40:56,362
I know what is engineering.

377
00:40:58,651 --> 00:41:01,266
You are not with those who killed my ship are ya?

378
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:03,539
 I take that as a no.

379
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:08,509
He is Krall. Him and his...

380
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:10,956
...bees.

381
00:41:10,957 --> 00:41:13,276
They searched the stars for ya.
Death machine.

382
00:41:13,497 --> 00:41:16,545
They are the reason why you are here,
why we are all here.

383
00:41:17,303 --> 00:41:18,932
Even those 3 scanners?

384
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:23,332
They have fallen from the sky,
like me and you.

385
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:28,110
Come with me. Now!

386
00:41:28,638 --> 00:41:31,208
Wait, hang on a minute.
I had a difficult day here.

387
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:33,934
I gotta find my crewmates.

388
00:41:35,297 --> 00:41:37,191
I will help you find your mates...

389
00:41:37,354 --> 00:41:39,047
...and then you will help me.

390
00:41:40,194 --> 00:41:41,448
With what?

391
00:41:43,072 --> 00:41:45,057
- You want me to fix something?
- Yes.

392
00:41:45,163 --> 00:41:46,784
You help me and I help you.

393
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:51,194
Alright, well things have been nasty all day,
and I won't get better offer today.

394
00:41:51,395 --> 00:41:52,874
So lead the way.

395
00:41:52,975 --> 00:41:53,975
Good.

396
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:55,418
I am Jaylah.

397
00:41:55,988 --> 00:41:58,626
- And you're Montgomery Scott.
- Aye, Scotty.

398
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:02,278
Come now, Montgomery Scotty.

399
00:42:04,807 --> 00:42:05,895
Right, hold up.

400
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:25,492
The Enterprise.

401
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:30,304
It may not even have power
to the bridge, Captain.

402
00:42:33,447 --> 00:42:36,223
She still has a few tricks up her sleeve.

403
00:42:38,411 --> 00:42:39,955
I bet on it.

404
00:42:42,082 --> 00:42:43,930
McCoy to Enterprise, come in.

405
00:42:45,012 --> 00:42:46,605
McCoy to Enterprise.

406
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:53,350
Hey, take it easy there, Spock.
That was just a temporary fix back there.

407
00:42:53,385 --> 00:42:54,698
I understand, Doctor.

408
00:43:01,074 --> 00:43:02,359
Fascinating.

409
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:04,540
Ominus, dark, dangerous.

410
00:43:08,327 --> 00:43:09,686
We are going in.

411
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,098
Intriguing.

412
00:43:33,133 --> 00:43:37,168
These symbols are the same as those
that we picked on the artifact.

413
00:43:37,203 --> 00:43:38,416
You think it came from here?

414
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,490
It would seem so.

415
00:43:45,488 --> 00:43:46,810
Spock!

416
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:57,136
Hurry.

417
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,776
- Aren't we there yet?
- Stop asking that.

418
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:03,120
- Sorry.
- This is the way, come.

419
00:44:04,779 --> 00:44:07,724
Watch your steps,
you do not want to set up my traps.

420
00:44:09,176 --> 00:44:11,176
Oh, that's clever.

421
00:44:12,601 --> 00:44:14,320
What is this place?

422
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:17,251
- This is my house.
- Your house ?

423
00:44:19,172 --> 00:44:20,295
Is this a ship?

424
00:44:20,387 --> 00:44:23,315
I hope you find your friends
and you help me fix it.

425
00:44:23,907 --> 00:44:26,085
So I can leave this planet forever.

426
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:30,077
Is this your ship?

427
00:44:30,431 --> 00:44:32,438
No, Montgomery Scotty.

428
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:35,698
It's yours.

429
00:44:36,422 --> 00:44:38,422
Oh boy.

430
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,124
Captain, it looks like there is power.

431
00:44:48,655 --> 00:44:51,705
Alright, let's get to the bridge
and find the crew.

432
00:45:31,449 --> 00:45:33,296
The console is intacted, and I will...

433
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,600
...try to reroute power to it.

434
00:45:36,623 --> 00:45:37,640
Work fast.

435
00:45:37,718 --> 00:45:40,792
Once we get this place run,
we are gonna draw a lot of attention.

436
00:45:42,013 --> 00:45:43,455
What do you think? You can find them?

437
00:45:43,484 --> 00:45:44,412
Aye, Captain.

438
00:45:44,487 --> 00:45:48,117
I am reconfiguring scanners
to modulate for the crews sequence.

439
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:54,673
You with me.
I left something behind.

440
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,342
That is one heck of a cold.

441
00:46:07,393 --> 00:46:08,957
Nice job, Keenser.

442
00:46:10,704 --> 00:46:13,253
Alright, we got about 15 minutes
until the next guard rotation.

443
00:46:13,488 --> 00:46:14,544
Come on.

444
00:46:21,753 --> 00:46:22,918
Let's go.

445
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:40,760
This is a Magellan probe.

446
00:46:41,313 --> 00:46:44,085
Federation is using these to find a way through the nebula.

447
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:46,278
What he is using it for?

448
00:47:13,115 --> 00:47:13,957
What do you see?

449
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:20,403
He's been pinging back in a subspace
links between the probes.

450
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:23,036
Well, use it to send a distress signal.

451
00:47:24,021 --> 00:47:25,268
I am trying.

452
00:47:30,155 --> 00:47:31,224
Sent.

453
00:47:31,352 --> 00:47:33,217
He's got the access to the Yorktown database.

454
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:34,969
What?

455
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,770
I start to identify the files, ship files...

456
00:47:38,494 --> 00:47:40,494
...including the Enterprise.

457
00:47:42,095 --> 00:47:44,342
He's been watching us this whole time.

458
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:00,370
Captain...

459
00:48:00,395 --> 00:48:02,567
...the artifact was on the ship the whole time?

460
00:48:03,443 --> 00:48:05,515
We did not want to get caught with it.

461
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,116
I hid it here.

462
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:15,409
Tell Krall, I have the Abornath.

463
00:48:16,864 --> 00:48:19,347
It's a really sad story you hear.

464
00:48:22,273 --> 00:48:23,633
Not every.

465
00:48:24,253 --> 00:48:27,538
Put the phaser down. Please.

466
00:48:31,939 --> 00:48:33,559
You did it, Chekov?

467
00:48:33,818 --> 00:48:36,373
Aye, Captain. I've traced her
location of her comm.

468
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:44,427
What does Krall want with this thing?

469
00:48:45,236 --> 00:48:47,166
To save you.

470
00:48:47,567 --> 00:48:49,166
From yourselves.

471
00:48:49,167 --> 00:48:50,167
Captain!

472
00:49:33,577 --> 00:49:36,937
- You all right?
- Aye, Captain, but we are trapped.

473
00:49:46,611 --> 00:49:48,233
Can you get it started?

474
00:49:48,234 --> 00:49:51,144
Are you intending to engage the thrusters?

475
00:49:51,214 --> 00:49:53,225
I am open up for suggestions.

476
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,284
Okay.

477
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,891
- There's the problem, sir.
- What?

478
00:49:58,937 --> 00:50:01,503
It's a pipe.
I can not get it to combust.

479
00:50:02,242 --> 00:50:05,220
Captain, we are basically
standing on a very large bomb.

480
00:50:05,226 --> 00:50:06,694
If you miss the combustion compressor.

481
00:50:06,706 --> 00:50:07,817
I am not gonna miss, come on.

482
00:50:07,907 --> 00:50:09,699
Do you even know how the compressor looks like?

483
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:11,333
Yea is squared, right?

484
00:50:11,418 --> 00:50:13,152
No, it's round.

485
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,752
That's what I said.

486
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,096
Chekov!

487
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:37,406
Chekov, move!

488
00:52:29,803 --> 00:52:32,194
You think you know...

489
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:36,828
...what sacrifice means?

490
00:52:40,055 --> 00:52:42,634
Federation has taught you...

491
00:52:42,669 --> 00:52:45,964
...that conflict should not exist!

492
00:52:51,017 --> 00:52:53,380
But without stronger,

493
00:52:54,587 --> 00:52:58,593
You will never know who you truly are.

494
00:52:59,081 --> 00:53:00,678
You have no idea who we are.

495
00:53:02,283 --> 00:53:04,318
But you'll soon find out.

496
00:53:04,608 --> 00:53:09,040
You mean the distress signal
you thought you sent?

497
00:53:12,163 --> 00:53:14,453
The coordinates were altered.

498
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:18,484
Your rescue ships
will be stranded in the nebula...

499
00:53:18,485 --> 00:53:21,628
...and your base left, full open.

500
00:53:22,285 --> 00:53:24,133
You go to attack Yorktown.

501
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:28,340
Millions of souls from every Federation world...

502
00:53:28,341 --> 00:53:30,074
...holding hands.

503
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,900
It's a perfect target.

504
00:53:32,926 --> 00:53:34,588
You're wrong.

505
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:36,612
We have strength in unity.

506
00:53:41,023 --> 00:53:43,323
The strength of others...

507
00:53:44,862 --> 00:53:48,044
... is what has kept me alive.

508
00:53:48,081 --> 00:53:49,945
No!

509
00:54:13,071 --> 00:54:14,071
Spock!

510
00:54:15,096 --> 00:54:16,509
Spock, wake up damn it!

511
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,872
I am entirely conscious, doctor.

512
00:54:22,753 --> 00:54:25,029
I am simply contemplating the nature of mortality.

513
00:54:26,549 --> 00:54:28,322
Feeling philosophical, huh?

514
00:54:30,581 --> 00:54:32,853
Mass blood loss and do that thrill ya.

515
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:38,871
You asked me why Lt. Uhura
and I parted ways.

516
00:54:40,297 --> 00:54:42,381
I became concerned...

517
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:44,381
...in the light of Vulcans demise

518
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:46,949
and would have had a duty to my species.

519
00:54:48,529 --> 00:54:51,056
You thought you should be off
making little Vulcans, huh?

520
00:54:53,095 --> 00:54:55,733
Yup, I can see how that'd upset her.

521
00:54:56,452 --> 00:54:58,317
I intended to discuss it with her further

522
00:54:58,352 --> 00:55:01,383
but I received some news which
affected me unexpectedly.

523
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:05,486
What news?

524
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,235
Ambassador Spock has died.

525
00:55:13,645 --> 00:55:15,429
Spock, I'm so sorry.

526
00:55:18,653 --> 00:55:22,041
I can not imagine what that must feel like.

527
00:55:27,804 --> 00:55:30,744
When you lived this many lifes as he...

528
00:55:31,818 --> 00:55:33,871
Fear of death is illogical.

529
00:55:36,201 --> 00:55:41,166
Fear of death is what keeps us alive.

530
00:55:45,544 --> 00:55:47,409
I want to live as he did.

531
00:55:50,802 --> 00:55:54,603
That is why I decided, to redirect my efforts...

532
00:55:54,638 --> 00:55:56,150
...and continue his work...

533
00:55:57,385 --> 00:55:58,853
...On New Vulcan.

534
00:56:02,243 --> 00:56:04,016
You are leaving Starfleet?

535
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:09,915
What did Jim had to say about that?

536
00:56:11,783 --> 00:56:16,104
I could not find the time to tell him.

537
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:18,191
Oh, I can tell you he is not gonna like that.

538
00:56:19,256 --> 00:56:21,475
Hell, I don't know what he'll do without ya.

539
00:56:22,595 --> 00:56:25,890
I mean, you know, me on the other hand.
I would...I would throw a party.

540
00:56:34,292 --> 00:56:36,574
My god, you get delirious.

541
00:56:42,789 --> 00:56:44,517
How far are we from the coordinates
from that call?

542
00:56:44,846 --> 00:56:46,261
Still a way, sir.

543
00:56:47,221 --> 00:56:48,393
Captain?

544
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,359
When did you begin to suspect her?

545
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:54,919
Not soon enough.

546
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:56,891
How did you know?

547
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:02,529
I guess you can say I got a...
...good knowledge for danger.

548
00:57:05,817 --> 00:57:07,290
Run!

549
00:57:16,413 --> 00:57:19,135
Is that music?
Where the hell is that coming from?

550
00:57:20,316 --> 00:57:21,568
There.

551
00:57:23,078 --> 00:57:26,564
I connected the middle box into the
power cell with a little mouth to make it sing.

552
00:57:27,523 --> 00:57:28,789
That's very clever.

553
00:57:29,295 --> 00:57:30,963
The music is classic, out of my taste...

554
00:57:30,998 --> 00:57:32,570
...not to mention very loud and distracting...

555
00:57:32,605 --> 00:57:34,130
...but hey, well played.

556
00:57:35,113 --> 00:57:37,099
I like the beats and shouting.

557
00:57:37,134 --> 00:57:38,245
Well you do.

558
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,223
- Put it off.
- Ah, it's okay.

559
00:57:44,224 --> 00:57:45,397
Put it off!

560
00:57:48,724 --> 00:57:50,504
Someone set the foot on my traps.

561
00:58:13,466 --> 00:58:14,715
Captain?

562
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:16,955
- You know these men?
- Aye, Classy.

563
00:58:16,956 --> 00:58:18,950
That's Michael Pavel Chekov...

564
00:58:19,299 --> 00:58:21,438
and that handsome is James T. Kirk.
They're my mates

565
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,738
It's good to see you sir.

566
00:58:25,974 --> 00:58:27,442
What is she doing Scotty?

567
00:58:27,443 --> 00:58:29,393
You could harm them with this thing.

568
00:58:33,099 --> 00:58:34,823
You're free, James T.

569
00:58:36,651 --> 00:58:38,008
Mr. Scott.

570
00:58:42,796 --> 00:58:44,255
Who's your new friend here?

571
00:58:44,997 --> 00:58:47,302
- She should have throw out the welcome mat.
- This is Jaylah.

572
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:50,051
I do not know what is a welcome mat.

573
00:58:50,242 --> 00:58:51,819
- You found anyone else?
- No, sir.

574
00:58:52,684 --> 00:58:54,169
I'm sorry. You are the only ones.

575
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:56,138
What the hell happened up there, Jim?
Why were we attacked?

576
00:58:56,256 --> 00:58:58,523
They were after the artifact
we brought back from Teenax.

577
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,477
- Did they get it?
- No.

578
00:58:59,632 --> 00:59:00,932
- Have you got it?
- No.

579
00:59:00,933 --> 00:59:02,712
It did get off the Enterprise
when it was in the shuttle.

580
00:59:02,896 --> 00:59:04,931
- You put it into shuttle.
- Yes.

581
00:59:05,602 --> 00:59:07,463
And no.

582
00:59:20,197 --> 00:59:22,979
This is the USS Franklin, sir.
Can you believe it?

583
00:59:23,382 --> 00:59:25,717
The first Earth ship capable of warp 4.

584
00:59:25,754 --> 00:59:28,531
Lost in
Gagarin radiation belt in 2160.

585
00:59:28,674 --> 00:59:31,847
I learned about it from the Academy.
Captain Balthazar Edison.

586
00:59:32,204 --> 00:59:35,427
It was his first year in Starfleet.
How the hell did the ship end up here?

587
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:36,703
There is a lot of theories, sir.

588
00:59:36,766 --> 00:59:38,148
Surrended to the Romulans,

589
00:59:38,248 --> 00:59:40,081
Captured by a giant green space hand.

590
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:42,296
This matter, must be a
wormhole displacement.

591
00:59:42,389 --> 00:59:43,396
Can you fly it?

592
00:59:43,685 --> 00:59:46,630
She is missing a few drive decoyls
and EPS conduits are fried...

593
00:59:46,646 --> 00:59:50,369
but Jaylah has done a marvelous job
getting the ship systems back online.

594
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,533
Thank you, Montgomery Scotty.

595
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:57,266
Mr. Chekov, Can you plug in the coordinates...

596
00:59:57,375 --> 00:59:59,798
if you can track the crews location
through the ship's sensors?

597
00:59:59,864 --> 01:00:00,890
Aye, Captain.

598
01:00:00,961 --> 01:00:02,035
He likes that seat.

599
01:00:02,046 --> 01:00:03,582
Mr. Scott, tour her.

600
01:00:03,635 --> 01:00:05,581
Yes. The mess hall. Jaylah, get up.

601
01:00:05,765 --> 01:00:06,973
Yes.

602
01:00:28,078 --> 01:00:29,870
No clue what happend to the crew, right?

603
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:32,473
No, sir. They would be
dead 100 years by now.

604
01:00:36,964 --> 01:00:38,233
Is that...?

605
01:00:38,738 --> 01:00:40,427
That's a PX-70.

606
01:00:45,176 --> 01:00:48,129
My dad used to have one when I was a kid.

607
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:51,593
Mom saying back there it was driving her nuts.

608
01:00:54,927 --> 01:00:56,296
Sir.

609
01:01:00,043 --> 01:01:03,998
The ship has been here this whole time
and none has ever noticed it?

610
01:01:14,266 --> 01:01:16,542
She stand out the image reflectors.

611
01:01:18,865 --> 01:01:22,661
-Alright, some sort of holographic camouflage.
- Aye, sir.

612
01:01:25,261 --> 01:01:26,261
Captain!

613
01:01:26,286 --> 01:01:29,259
I intercepted a weak communication
transmission, sir,

614
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,225
It's a Starfleet frequency.

615
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,020
<i>TRANSMISSION DETECTED</i>

616
01:01:34,045 --> 01:01:35,362
Can you lock on to the signal?

617
01:01:35,751 --> 01:01:37,908
Yes, but how do we get to them?

618
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:42,181
I have an idea, sir,
but I'm gonna need your permission.

619
01:01:42,535 --> 01:01:43,532
Why would you need my permission?

620
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:44,862
Because if I'm gonna screw up,

621
01:01:44,886 --> 01:01:46,886
I don't want it to be just my fault.

622
01:01:49,825 --> 01:01:53,330
McCoy and Spock Enteprise crew.
Come in, Enterprise crew.

623
01:01:53,331 --> 01:01:54,331
Anyone.

624
01:01:59,264 --> 01:02:00,709
Come on, Spock.

625
01:02:01,182 --> 01:02:03,046
Come on, we can make it.

626
01:02:04,881 --> 01:02:08,452
Leaving me behind will significantly
increase your chances of survival, doctor.

627
01:02:08,553 --> 01:02:11,238
Ah that's damn sure
still leaving is completly out of question.

628
01:02:11,339 --> 01:02:14,483
It is imperative  that you locate
any surviving crew.

629
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:16,195
We're all seeking who care.

630
01:02:23,562 --> 01:02:26,183
Looks like care arrived

631
01:02:27,779 --> 01:02:30,402
I always assumed my respect for you was clear.

632
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,515
Dialogue we have had across the years...

633
01:02:35,516 --> 01:02:39,329
It's okay, Spock.
You don't have to say it.

634
01:02:43,308 --> 01:02:45,284
Well, at least I won't die alone.

635
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,646
Well, that's just typical.

636
01:02:56,872 --> 01:02:58,116
Come on...

637
01:03:06,056 --> 01:03:07,828
Good to see you in one piece doctor!

638
01:03:07,863 --> 01:03:09,290
Oh, am I?

639
01:03:09,356 --> 01:03:11,158
I feel like my entrails
were at barn days.

640
01:03:11,293 --> 01:03:13,580
I released old transporters
only ever used for cargo

641
01:03:13,615 --> 01:03:15,365
but a few modifications seems to do the trick.

642
01:03:15,577 --> 01:03:17,340
I thought it's best opinion when I

643
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:19,359
You know, he should get displaced.

644
01:03:21,228 --> 01:03:22,864
Oh, I couldn't imagine a worse scenario.

645
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:24,509
Good to have you back.
You all right?

646
01:03:24,544 --> 01:03:25,900
Yeah, I'm fine. He's hurt.

647
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:27,373
I am functioning adequately, Captain.

648
01:03:27,543 --> 01:03:28,784
In a pigs eye, you are.

649
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:32,874
Captain, we discovered that a stolen
artifact appears to come from this planet.

650
01:03:33,396 --> 01:03:34,727
Damn it, Spock!

651
01:03:35,504 --> 01:03:37,747
- Are there any medical supplies on this thing.
- This way.

652
01:03:44,663 --> 01:03:46,169
Lie down, come on.

653
01:03:46,593 --> 01:03:47,593
There you go.

654
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:51,491
How are we gonna get out of this hole, Spock?

655
01:03:51,492 --> 01:03:52,190
We got...

656
01:03:52,715 --> 01:03:53,891
...no ship, no crew.

657
01:03:53,892 --> 01:03:54,904
Knocked us out

658
01:03:55,005 --> 01:03:56,623
We will do what we have always done, Jim.

659
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:59,013
We will find hope in the impossible.

660
01:03:59,014 --> 01:04:00,725
Let's get you patched up first, okay?

661
01:04:00,726 --> 01:04:01,726
Captain.

662
01:04:02,024 --> 01:04:04,020
You must focus your efforts on helping the crew.

663
01:04:04,021 --> 01:04:05,772
That's why I need you around Spock.

664
01:04:09,142 --> 01:04:10,644
This things are from the dark ages.

665
01:04:11,656 --> 01:04:12,795
Bones.

666
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:16,749
I am pretty sure this protoplaser

667
01:04:17,196 --> 01:04:20,284
will stop the internal haemorrhage.
At least that's my hope.

668
01:04:20,498 --> 01:04:24,255
The miserable have no other medicine
but only hope.

669
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:27,033
That's *?* is quoting Shakespeare.

670
01:04:29,831 --> 01:04:33,076
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 2263.2
</i>

671
01:04:36,258 --> 01:04:40,396
Losing time with them and we still do not know where the captain is.

672
01:04:44,011 --> 01:04:47,787
Let me take care of them.

673
01:04:57,893 --> 01:04:59,851
Tell me where it is.

674
01:05:00,048 --> 01:05:01,052
Now!

675
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,671
No!

676
01:05:04,995 --> 01:05:06,195
Stop!

677
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,802
I have it, I will give you want.

678
01:05:10,003 --> 01:05:11,354
No, Syl! Don't!

679
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:38,514
Lieutenant.

680
01:05:38,549 --> 01:05:42,335
Unity is not your strength,

681
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,992
it's your weakness.

682
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:26,274
We should wait until we are absolutely sure.

683
01:06:26,861 --> 01:06:29,133
No, we have to get the crew back, now.

684
01:06:30,055 --> 01:06:32,769
Chekov has the coordinates that
can lead us to Krall's base, so we go.

685
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:36,091
With respect, sir, how do we know
that Krall was at the base when she called.

686
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:38,129
And even if he was, we do not know if
and the crew is with them.

687
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:39,130
Or still alive.

688
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,597
Mr. Chekov, Can you reconfigure the search parameters

689
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:43,497
in order to compensate for this formula?

690
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:47,542
Aye, I can handle it. What is this forumla?

691
01:06:49,076 --> 01:06:51,874
It is vokaya, Mr. Chekov.
A mineral unique to Vulcan

692
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,375
which emits a low-level radiation.

693
01:06:53,595 --> 01:06:56,416
I'll have to find if
there are any energy emissions.

694
01:06:56,617 --> 01:06:59,594
Spock, what the hell would a Vulcan
mineral be doing way out here?

695
01:06:59,595 --> 01:07:00,595
Where are you going with this?

696
01:07:00,596 --> 01:07:02,340
Lt. Uhura wears a vokaya amulet

697
01:07:02,341 --> 01:07:05,424
which I presented to her
as a token of my affection and respect.

698
01:07:05,932 --> 01:07:07,857
You gave your girlfriend
a radioactive jewelery?

699
01:07:07,998 --> 01:07:09,444
The emissions is harmless, Doctor.

700
01:07:09,445 --> 01:07:11,779
But it's unique signature makes it very easy to identify.

701
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,543
You gave your girlfriend
a tracking device?

702
01:07:18,365 --> 01:07:20,115
That was not my intention.

703
01:07:21,174 --> 01:07:23,294
I am glad he doesn't respect me.

704
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,692
I am detecting a very trace of vokaya.

705
01:07:40,151 --> 01:07:43,739
Does the location match the coordinates you acquired from Kalari, Mr. Chekov?

706
01:07:44,005 --> 01:07:45,220
It is a match, sir.

707
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:48,113
It's presence suggest that Lt. Uhura
and there by the rest of the crew

708
01:07:48,114 --> 01:07:49,953
are being held at Krall's base of operation.

709
01:07:50,477 --> 01:07:52,238
Can we beam them out?

710
01:07:52,394 --> 01:07:55,495
No, sir. There is some geological interference

711
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:57,793
that is blocking transporter signal.

712
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,157
Well I guess are gonna have to break in
the old fashion way.

713
01:08:01,192 --> 01:08:03,403
You can not go to this place.

714
01:08:04,772 --> 01:08:07,132
Everyone who goes there, he kills.

715
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:10,965
You've been there? You've seen it?

716
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:12,899
Why did you say something, Classy?

717
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,239
Because I knew you will ask me
to take you there.

718
01:08:17,706 --> 01:08:21,035
Your friends are there then they will die,
just like my family.

719
01:08:21,776 --> 01:08:24,120
And I will not go back to that death place.

720
01:08:24,121 --> 01:08:26,930
If you escaped than you can show us
the way in and the way out.

721
01:08:26,931 --> 01:08:27,931
No!

722
01:08:27,932 --> 01:08:30,252
This is not the deal we made, Montgomery Scotty.

723
01:08:32,544 --> 01:08:34,935
If you choose to do this,
you are on your own.

724
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:37,640
- Wait, wait.
- Let her go.

725
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:40,085
And she's lost people too, Captain.

726
01:08:49,682 --> 01:08:53,389
Listen, that's our friends out there Classy,
and we can not just leave them behind.

727
01:08:54,638 --> 01:08:57,168
We could really use your help.

728
01:08:57,705 --> 01:08:59,888
You just needed to be brave as all.

729
01:09:01,643 --> 01:09:03,684
When we run in that place...

730
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:06,435
... Krall will come in and take someone.

731
01:09:07,782 --> 01:09:11,245
There were screams, I can still hear them.

732
01:09:12,826 --> 01:09:14,600
And we would not see that person again...

733
01:09:14,624 --> 01:09:16,624
... it did not know who would be next.

734
01:09:23,445 --> 01:09:25,516
My father planed to escape.

735
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:26,886
But we were seen by the...

736
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:28,910
...by the one they call Manas.

737
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:36,247
My father fought him so I could get out.

738
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,532
He was brave...

739
01:09:38,556 --> 01:09:40,556
and Manas killed him.

740
01:09:42,771 --> 01:09:44,553
What you want is impossible.

741
01:09:47,916 --> 01:09:49,664
Maybe is not.

742
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:54,064
My wee Granny used to say,
ye canna' break a stick in a bundle.

743
01:09:55,664 --> 01:09:57,353
You're part of something bigger now, Classy.

744
01:09:57,744 --> 01:09:58,862
They never gave up on you.

745
01:09:59,004 --> 01:10:01,969
That is what being part of crew
is all about.

746
01:10:03,364 --> 01:10:05,169
Is that why you believe in James T.?

747
01:10:08,321 --> 01:10:10,997
All I know is, we stand
a better chance with you.

748
01:10:13,556 --> 01:10:16,610
The digging machines improved a tunnel
that goes into the crater.

749
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:17,749
That's how we get out.

750
01:10:17,784 --> 01:10:19,392
So that'll be our way in?

751
01:10:19,539 --> 01:10:21,583
Away team at the othe side of the tunnel

752
01:10:21,618 --> 01:10:24,800
Follow to cross the base, get to the side of the
building, to break out the crew.

753
01:10:25,261 --> 01:10:28,766
Captain, we can not locate anyone inside the crater

754
01:10:28,801 --> 01:10:29,935
in order to beam them out.

755
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:31,988
Oh, I can bring up pulse beacons to path enhancers

756
01:10:32,023 --> 01:10:33,812
- That I get signal into the crater.
- Alright.

757
01:10:34,047 --> 01:10:36,000
How many people can Franklin transport at the time?

758
01:10:36,035 --> 01:10:38,336
With a little modification,
20, max...

759
01:10:38,371 --> 01:10:39,587
But I am not sure how long it will hold out.

760
01:10:40,789 --> 01:10:43,294
Bones, Mr. Chekov and Jaylah,
would be in the away team.

761
01:10:43,329 --> 01:10:45,226
Mr Scott, modify the transporter

762
01:10:45,261 --> 01:10:47,282
and do whatever you can
to make this ship operational.

763
01:10:47,517 --> 01:10:49,290
Captain, Mr. Chekov's technical acumen

764
01:10:49,325 --> 01:10:51,976
makes him more valuable onboard
the Franklin with Mr. Scott.

765
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,691
Is there by logical that I would replace him.

766
01:10:54,715 --> 01:10:57,060
Why is that logical Spock?
You just got back on your feet.

767
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:00,548
Lt. Uhura's in that facility, Jim.

768
01:11:03,394 --> 01:11:05,061
I'll keep an eye on him.

769
01:11:06,068 --> 01:11:07,390
Understood.

770
01:11:07,425 --> 01:11:11,072
His soldiers are everywhere.
We won't pass unseen.

771
01:11:11,274 --> 01:11:13,131
What we require is a diversion.

772
01:11:19,369 --> 01:11:21,130
I think I have an idea.

773
01:11:47,326 --> 01:11:49,988
This is Abornath.

774
01:11:51,183 --> 01:11:54,530
It was used by the ancient once as a weapon

775
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:58,078
But when they could not control its deadly power...

776
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:01,022
...they split it into two...

777
01:12:01,057 --> 01:12:04,088
And ejected the halves into space.

778
01:12:04,123 --> 01:12:06,654
Hoping it will be lost forever.

779
01:12:10,676 --> 01:12:12,673
But I am grateful

780
01:12:13,308 --> 01:12:17,395
I have spent lifetime searching for

781
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:22,011
And only to have you find it for me.

782
01:12:26,694 --> 01:12:29,173
The poetry of fate.

783
01:12:32,093 --> 01:12:34,694
The world that I was born into...

784
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:38,080
...is very different from yours, Lieutenant.

785
01:12:38,115 --> 01:12:40,470
We knew pain, we knew terror.

786
01:12:40,505 --> 01:12:43,933
Struggle, made us strong.

787
01:12:43,968 --> 01:12:47,172
Not peace, not unity.

788
01:12:47,207 --> 01:12:50,985
These are myths the Federation make you believe.

789
01:12:56,009 --> 01:12:57,611
Those are strong words.

790
01:12:57,835 --> 01:12:59,311
You may even believe them.

791
01:12:59,312 --> 01:13:01,320
But there's something else
going on with you.

792
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:03,168
Something underneath.

793
01:13:07,367 --> 01:13:08,507
Wait.

794
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:10,692
What are you doing with her?

795
01:13:11,881 --> 01:13:14,376
You already got what you want
then let her go!

796
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:16,563
No!

797
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:54,099
Manas.

798
01:13:54,323 --> 01:13:56,323
It's time.

799
01:13:58,286 --> 01:14:01,892
The Federation has pushed
the frontier for centuries.

800
01:14:01,927 --> 01:14:03,303
But no longer.

801
01:14:03,876 --> 01:14:06,106
This is where it begins, Lieutenant.

802
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:13,183
This is where the frontier,
pushes back.

803
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,510
This way.

804
01:14:46,012 --> 01:14:47,604
Where is she?

805
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,000
My god, this is hell of a distraction.

806
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Your friends are over there.

807
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Come on.

808
01:15:20,214 --> 01:15:22,000
Commander wait!

809
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:26,349
Krall, take the weapon
and continue the mission.

810
01:15:33,673 --> 01:15:34,673
Go!

811
01:16:09,102 --> 01:16:11,597
Commander, Uhura, they took her.

812
01:16:14,363 --> 01:16:16,360
Get ready and take the crew to safety.

813
01:16:17,478 --> 01:16:18,924
Come on. Let's go. Move.

814
01:16:27,126 --> 01:16:28,930
- I've got them, Mr Scott.
- Okay, Mr. Chekov.

815
01:16:28,965 --> 01:16:31,424
Release the signal.
We are gonna grab them 20 at a time.

816
01:16:31,459 --> 01:16:33,470
- Aye.
- Let's hope this doesn't get messy.

817
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:34,701
Energize!

818
01:17:11,075 --> 01:17:12,157
Spock!

819
01:17:12,681 --> 01:17:14,681
What are you doing here?

820
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:19,249
Clearly,
I am here to rescue you.

821
01:17:19,831 --> 01:17:21,058
Let's go.

822
01:17:29,302 --> 01:17:30,569
Good to see you good man.

823
01:17:58,311 --> 01:18:02,038
You'll die here as your father.

824
01:18:55,285 --> 01:18:57,431
Ten seconds
until transporters recharged, doctor.

825
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:58,739
Wait for my signal.

826
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:00,825
- Doctor!
- Damn it man, we are not leaving without them!

827
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:05,111
Hang on! Let's go!

828
01:19:05,135 --> 01:19:05,935
Move! move!

829
01:19:34,623 --> 01:19:36,941
We are ready for you next captain,
just turn on your beacon.

830
01:19:37,076 --> 01:19:38,929
- Scotty, you have everybody?
- Aye, sir.

831
01:19:38,964 --> 01:19:39,988
Everyones here except you and Jeylah.

832
01:19:40,223 --> 01:19:42,084
Start the beacon and we will grab ya.

833
01:19:51,018 --> 01:19:54,752
Your friends abandoned you.

834
01:19:58,348 --> 01:19:59,567
Captain, your beacon!

835
01:20:31,758 --> 01:20:33,105
- There it is!
- Energize!

836
01:20:36,487 --> 01:20:38,475
Jaylah!

837
01:20:54,041 --> 01:20:55,429
Okay, let's never do that again.

838
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:57,283
Aye, James T.

839
01:21:01,328 --> 01:21:01,828
You all right?

840
01:21:02,253 --> 01:21:04,300
Captain this thing he has...

841
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:08,950
Yorktown. He's gonna destroy Yorktown.

842
01:21:10,009 --> 01:21:11,706
You take my house...

843
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:14,930
...and you make it fly.

844
01:21:17,747 --> 01:21:19,272
Mr. Scotty, can you get this thing started?

845
01:21:19,373 --> 01:21:21,809
Well start it, yes.
Flying sir, that's a different thing.

846
01:21:21,844 --> 01:21:23,749
These old vessel, they were built in space.

847
01:21:23,784 --> 01:21:25,620
They were never supposed
to take off from the atmosphere.

848
01:21:26,067 --> 01:21:27,450
Make it happen.

849
01:21:27,485 --> 01:21:29,775
They are called Starships sir,
for a reason.

850
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:30,822
Why you tell me this now?

851
01:21:30,857 --> 01:21:34,215
Because I didn't want to disappoint ya.
You know, in case we didn't make it back.

852
01:21:34,847 --> 01:21:35,994
How thoughtful, Mr. Scott.

853
01:21:35,995 --> 01:21:36,995
Captain.

854
01:21:44,213 --> 01:21:45,407
He is launching.

855
01:21:52,642 --> 01:21:55,126
The attack at the Yorktown may be just the beginning.

856
01:21:56,061 --> 01:21:57,464
With this bioweapon...

857
01:21:57,465 --> 01:21:58,843
...he could get rid of all life...

858
01:21:58,844 --> 01:22:00,447
...and use the bases advanced technology...

859
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:02,838
...to attack an untold number of Federation planets.

860
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,383
We are just gonna have to get this thing flying.

861
01:22:07,418 --> 01:22:09,442
We can not just junk start it, sir.

862
01:22:14,801 --> 01:22:16,991
Okay, all systems are online.

863
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:20,977
Dilithium chambers
at 70% and raising.

864
01:22:21,012 --> 01:22:23,705
Main *something* subwarp engines standing by.

865
01:22:25,963 --> 01:22:27,279
Mr. Sulu.

866
01:22:27,329 --> 01:22:28,564
You can...

867
01:22:28,588 --> 01:22:29,788
You know...

868
01:22:29,812 --> 01:22:31,812
...fly this thing, right?

869
01:22:32,815 --> 01:22:33,931
You kidding me, sir?

870
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:35,970
Fantastic.

871
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:37,995
Scotty, how are we looking?

872
01:22:38,722 --> 01:22:40,309
Ready as she will never be, sir.

873
01:22:40,344 --> 01:22:41,921
That's what I like to hear.
Alright.

874
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:43,647
Bones, where are we with the crew?

875
01:22:43,739 --> 01:22:45,454
I could use a functioning med bay,

876
01:22:45,489 --> 01:22:47,185
but otherwise we are secure and clear.

877
01:22:47,628 --> 01:22:49,145
Mr. Sulu.

878
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:51,227
We have to achieve a terminal velocity,

879
01:22:51,228 --> 01:22:53,700
in order for the stabilizers
to provide lift.

880
01:22:53,991 --> 01:22:56,508
Are you sure this drop is high enough to do that?

881
01:22:58,049 --> 01:22:59,537
We'll find out.

882
01:23:08,757 --> 01:23:10,707
Call it, Mr. Sulu.

883
01:23:10,742 --> 01:23:11,916
Aye aye, Captain.

884
01:23:12,548 --> 01:23:14,633
Mr. Chekov, be ready to hit the front stabilizers

885
01:23:14,668 --> 01:23:16,786
full on my mark. One quarter Impulse

886
01:23:16,821 --> 01:23:17,855
Right.

887
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:42,707
- One half impulse, Mr. Chekov.
- Aye.

888
01:23:45,263 --> 01:23:46,650
We should belt down. Come on, move move!

889
01:23:57,256 --> 01:23:59,288
Easy, Mr. Sulu.
Let's not break her now.

890
01:24:35,841 --> 01:24:38,424
Anytime, Mr. Sulu.

891
01:24:43,372 --> 01:24:44,669
Now, Mr. Chekov.

892
01:25:59,963 --> 01:26:01,883
I have an alert on incoming vessel.

893
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:05,766
No reply on all frequency ID request.

894
01:26:05,767 --> 01:26:06,967
Visual.

895
01:26:21,041 --> 01:26:22,737
Red alert! Red alert!

896
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:35,979
Look how far they've come.

897
01:26:36,003 --> 01:26:38,003
<i>*Some kind of alert*</i>

898
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,564
We received distress signals on all frequencies from Yorktown.

899
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:56,919
Krall is already starting the attack.

900
01:26:57,605 --> 01:26:59,524
Mr. Scott, what kind of weapons do we have?

901
01:27:00,047 --> 01:27:03,730
We have pulse phased cannons
and spatial torpedoes.

902
01:27:03,765 --> 01:27:05,240
Great. Lock and load.

903
01:27:05,275 --> 01:27:07,529
That does not matter.
You can no defeat the bees.

904
01:27:08,051 --> 01:27:10,414
Maybe, maybe we will lore them away.

905
01:27:10,449 --> 01:27:13,145
How do we get Yorktown time
to get people to safety?

906
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:15,000
We are on course and buggy competitors.

907
01:27:15,035 --> 01:27:17,103
We are barely holding together as it is, Captain.

908
01:27:17,138 --> 01:27:18,130
Captain.

909
01:27:18,165 --> 01:27:20,814
The flight paterns of bees are determined by individual decisions.

910
01:27:21,207 --> 01:27:23,192
Krall's form formations are to complex...

911
01:27:23,227 --> 01:27:26,315
...not to rely on some form of unified
psychopathic coordination.

912
01:27:26,703 --> 01:27:28,411
- I suggest that...
- Spock.

913
01:27:28,444 --> 01:27:29,254
Skip to the end.

914
01:27:29,255 --> 01:27:31,384
What he is saying that
if we disorient the swarm...

915
01:27:31,385 --> 01:27:32,553
...we can kick it's ass.

916
01:27:33,568 --> 01:27:34,680
Precisely.

917
01:27:35,855 --> 01:27:37,834
Scotty, can you beam me onto
one of those swarm ships?

918
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:39,251
Have you gone completly mad?

919
01:27:39,252 --> 01:27:40,727
- Yes or no?
- No.

920
01:27:40,776 --> 01:27:41,619
Yes.

921
01:27:41,843 --> 01:27:42,687
Maybe.

922
01:27:42,688 --> 01:27:46,616
Captain, my familiarity with the interior
of those ships, however brave

923
01:27:46,651 --> 01:27:48,723
makes me more qualified
for this away mission.

924
01:27:48,937 --> 01:27:50,525
Spock, you're still hurt.

925
01:27:50,873 --> 01:27:52,471
She's right, Spock.

926
01:27:53,818 --> 01:27:55,825
I acknowledge with respect your concerns.

927
01:27:56,805 --> 01:27:59,346
Perhaps you will feel more confident
if I were accompanied by someone

928
01:27:59,347 --> 01:28:02,570
with familiarity of both the ship
and my injury.

929
01:28:03,857 --> 01:28:05,457
He's gonna love this.

930
01:28:07,303 --> 01:28:08,527
You want me to do what?

931
01:28:10,108 --> 01:28:11,279
Come along, doctor.

932
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,598
Whoo, wait a minute.

933
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:15,851
Wait you green blooded alien.
This was your idea.

934
01:28:16,482 --> 01:28:17,596
It's a good idea, Bones.

935
01:28:17,665 --> 01:28:20,383
You know, next time you have piece of pipes
stuck in your trousers.

936
01:28:20,683 --> 01:28:21,714
Call a plumber.

937
01:28:21,809 --> 01:28:23,661
Let's make sure you find a way
to break these things.

938
01:28:23,662 --> 01:28:25,746
If it gets heady
I'll beam ya straight back.

939
01:28:25,747 --> 01:28:26,747
Energize.

940
01:28:27,271 --> 01:28:28,871
It will be great!

941
01:28:29,101 --> 01:28:31,152
Damn it, Jim.
I'm a doctor, not...

942
01:28:38,386 --> 01:28:41,358
You do realize the last time I've gone
over one of these things

943
01:28:41,593 --> 01:28:42,623
we crashed!

944
01:28:43,092 --> 01:28:45,164
So don't blame me, Jim

945
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,100
Hit something.

946
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:52,392
Spock to Franklin.

947
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:53,800
Spock, we read you.

948
01:28:53,801 --> 01:28:57,041
Captain, from what I can undertake,
the ships share the phychopathic language

949
01:28:57,042 --> 01:28:58,468
... that coordinates their actions.

950
01:28:58,632 --> 01:28:59,864
Patching through now.

951
01:29:00,724 --> 01:29:02,395
That's what they signalize.

952
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:06,180
They weren't jamming us,
they were talking to each other.

953
01:29:06,181 --> 01:29:08,323
How do we get them to stop talking?

954
01:29:08,424 --> 01:29:10,119
What about an electromagnetic focusing?

955
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:12,029
We can use the transporters to disturb their network.

956
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:13,320
Focus might be too specific.

957
01:29:13,647 --> 01:29:16,407
If you can play some sort of disruptive communication signal
inside the swarm

958
01:29:16,408 --> 01:29:18,618
it might reversevily effect capacity the way it coordinates.

959
01:29:18,919 --> 01:29:21,680
It will have to be the frequency
they will not anticipate.

960
01:29:21,724 --> 01:29:24,366
It will cause a chain reaction
that will wipe out the whole swarm.

961
01:29:24,367 --> 01:29:28,151
Sir, a closed network like that might
be susceptible to very high frequency.

962
01:29:28,649 --> 01:29:30,162
VHF.

963
01:29:30,317 --> 01:29:30,837
Radio.

964
01:29:30,861 --> 01:29:32,861
We can...
We can broadcast something from the ship

965
01:29:32,938 --> 01:29:33,938
to wire out the links.

966
01:29:33,939 --> 01:29:35,259
Something loud and distracting.

967
01:29:35,283 --> 01:29:36,783
Loud and distracting?

968
01:29:38,463 --> 01:29:40,090
I've got just the thing.

969
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:41,969
Do not break my music.

970
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:44,335
Break it?
It will get an upgrade.

971
01:29:57,071 --> 01:29:59,065
Swarm ships in 60 seconds
will break in through.

972
01:29:59,466 --> 01:30:02,537
I just got to reconfigure the VHF
array range *something something*.

973
01:30:02,892 --> 01:30:04,505
- Let me do it.
- No, Classy I am in a hurry.

974
01:30:04,506 --> 01:30:05,506
*something*

975
01:30:11,402 --> 01:30:12,122
There, see?

976
01:30:12,346 --> 01:30:13,346
Simple.

977
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:14,238
Alright.

978
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:15,784
Captain, we are ready to broadcast.

979
01:30:15,967 --> 01:30:18,349
The signal won't travel far,
we have to get closer.

980
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:20,678
- How close?
- Very.

981
01:30:20,779 --> 01:30:22,330
Intercept course, Mr. Sulu.

982
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,040
- *something*

983
01:30:37,983 --> 01:30:39,726
My old friend.

984
01:30:50,527 --> 01:30:54,022
Ships swarm are gathering back
and forming an attack wave, sir.

985
01:30:54,023 --> 01:30:55,353
We have got their attention.

986
01:30:55,454 --> 01:30:56,477
Hold steady, Mr. Sulu.

987
01:30:56,678 --> 01:30:57,784
Brace yourselves, everybody.

988
01:30:57,785 --> 01:30:59,566
Spock, stand by to drop out
of formation.

989
01:30:59,567 --> 01:31:01,559
- Scotty, all queued up back there?
- Aye, sir.

990
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,187
Ready to broadcast at 57.7 MHz.

991
01:31:04,188 --> 01:31:06,650
- Made your choice, Classy?
- I have the beat and shouting.

992
01:31:30,732 --> 01:31:32,583
Let's make some noise.

993
01:31:40,853 --> 01:31:42,215
That's a good choice.

994
01:31:55,447 --> 01:31:57,006
Faster, Doc. We risk to be consumed

995
01:31:57,041 --> 01:31:58,523
by the *something* detectors.

996
01:31:58,710 --> 01:32:00,205
*something*

997
01:32:00,676 --> 01:32:03,283
- *something*, Doctor!
- God damn, I see it!

998
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:24,575
Classical music?

999
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:27,813
Yes, Doctor.
It seems to be.

1000
01:32:28,253 --> 01:32:31,730
Lt. Uhura, make sure Yorktown
has the frequency to broadcast.

1001
01:32:34,433 --> 01:32:36,362
Sir, we have the distraction frequency.

1002
01:32:36,783 --> 01:32:38,128
Broadcast!

1003
01:32:58,889 --> 01:33:00,312
You're all right, Spock?

1004
01:33:00,313 --> 01:33:01,437
We are fine, Captain.

1005
01:33:01,461 --> 01:33:03,461
But there are still three ships
heading into Yorktown.

1006
01:33:03,538 --> 01:33:04,538
That's got to be Krall.

1007
01:33:04,539 --> 01:33:05,589
Keep on him, Spock.

1008
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:08,413
Do whatever it takes to stop him
from using that weapon.

1009
01:33:27,954 --> 01:33:30,048
My house is breaking!

1010
01:33:30,049 --> 01:33:31,867
Mass depolarization of the hull.

1011
01:33:31,868 --> 01:33:34,486
Maybe I can redirect the power,
*something * I need *something*.

1012
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:37,879
I need you, Jaylah.
Let's go!

1013
01:34:03,077 --> 01:34:04,242
Do not lose them, Doctor.

1014
01:34:04,443 --> 01:34:06,816
We can always change places
if you want, Spock.

1015
01:34:27,925 --> 01:34:31,431
Captain, intercepting all three ships
is an impossibility.

1016
01:34:35,602 --> 01:34:37,520
Give me schematic of Yorktown.

1017
01:34:38,889 --> 01:34:40,966
There. Yorktown headquarters.

1018
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:43,453
Mr. Chekov, can you do a bioscan
on central plaza?

1019
01:34:43,643 --> 01:34:44,724
Aye.

1020
01:34:44,748 --> 01:34:46,517
They are clearing civilians.

1021
01:34:46,518 --> 01:34:48,416
Bones, there's a city plaza coming up.

1022
01:34:48,417 --> 01:34:50,484
You have to make sure Krall heads for it.

1023
01:34:50,794 --> 01:34:52,487
- Why?
- Just do it!

1024
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:09,542
Sulu, get us up there!

1025
01:35:09,543 --> 01:35:11,029
Hold onto something!

1026
01:36:05,557 --> 01:36:07,916
- Great work, Bones.
- Thanks, Captain.

1027
01:36:08,317 --> 01:36:10,651
Now I just need to figure out how to land.

1028
01:36:16,812 --> 01:36:19,562
Captain, I have 3 hull breaches
from the impact.

1029
01:36:19,763 --> 01:36:22,526
Deck 3, the cargo bay and the engine room.

1030
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:26,033
Alright, Sulu, Chekov, check the cargo bay and deck 3.

1031
01:36:26,034 --> 01:36:29,155
I want confirmation that the weapon has been neutralized and that Krall is dead.

1032
01:36:47,521 --> 01:36:49,093
Captain.

1033
01:36:55,413 --> 01:36:57,683
It's Krall. I've seen him do this.

1034
01:36:57,945 --> 01:37:01,419
It's a somekind of energy transfer,
and it physically changes him.

1035
01:37:01,591 --> 01:37:04,983
He must still be on board.
No one seen him leave.

1036
01:37:06,815 --> 01:37:09,069
Sulu, contact Yorktown security...

1037
01:37:09,070 --> 01:37:10,104
...to lockdown the ship.

1038
01:37:10,105 --> 01:37:11,105
Let's go.

1039
01:37:43,942 --> 01:37:45,436
Captain.

1040
01:37:46,346 --> 01:37:48,346
<i>...expand the frontier...</i>

1041
01:37:52,627 --> 01:37:55,278
<i>...expand the frontier...</i>

1042
01:38:12,368 --> 01:38:13,509
It's him.

1043
01:38:14,798 --> 01:38:17,433
Scotty, I need you
to link to Franklin database.

1044
01:38:17,652 --> 01:38:19,903
Find out what you can about Balthazar Edison.

1045
01:38:20,104 --> 01:38:21,767
- What the Captain on a Franklin?
- Yes.

1046
01:38:21,768 --> 01:38:22,900
He is long dead.

1047
01:38:23,001 --> 01:38:26,457
No he is not. I do not know how,
but Edison is Krall.

1048
01:38:37,239 --> 01:38:38,329
What did you find?

1049
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:41,263
Well, his records goes back
when Federation didn't even exist .

1050
01:38:41,264 --> 01:38:44,280
He was a major
in the United Earth Military Assault Command Operation.

1051
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:45,941
Along in the offworld combat.

1052
01:38:45,942 --> 01:38:48,337
- He was a soldier.
- Aye, sir. And pretty good one.

1053
01:38:48,338 --> 01:38:50,923
His military service came to an end
when *something something*.

1054
01:38:50,924 --> 01:38:51,924
Why? What happened ?

1055
01:38:51,925 --> 01:38:54,735
The Federation sir, Starfleet.
We are not a military agency.

1056
01:38:54,736 --> 01:38:56,442
They made him captain and gave him a Franklin.

1057
01:38:56,658 --> 01:38:58,199
- Scotty, bring up his logs.
- Aye, sir.

1058
01:39:00,035 --> 01:39:01,086
<i>Captain's Log...</i>

1059
01:39:01,121 --> 01:39:02,386
The last record.

1060
01:39:02,763 --> 01:39:06,570
<i>Captain's Log....
I don't remember the Stardate.</i>

1061
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:10,486
<i>All distress calls are nonsense.</i>

1062
01:39:11,167 --> 01:39:15,327
<i>Of the crew, only 3 remain.</i>

1063
01:39:15,524 --> 01:39:17,589
<i>I will only die.</i>

1064
01:39:20,163 --> 01:39:23,571
<i>The entities abandoned this planet long ago.</i>

1065
01:39:23,861 --> 01:39:26,932
<i>They left behind sophisticated mining equipment
</i>

1066
01:39:26,933 --> 01:39:29,311
<i>and a drone platforms.</i>

1067
01:39:29,312 --> 01:39:32,347
<i>They had some sort of technology...</i>

1068
01:39:32,686 --> 01:39:33,900
<i>...that prolongs...</i>

1069
01:39:34,924 --> 01:39:36,424
<i>...life.</i>

1070
01:39:36,464 --> 01:39:39,460
<i>I'll do whatever it takes for me and my crew.</i>

1071
01:39:39,644 --> 01:39:42,669
<i>The Federation do not care about us.</i>

1072
01:39:48,083 --> 01:39:50,584
<i>Probably never see me again...</i>

1073
01:39:50,913 --> 01:39:52,881
<i>...but if you do...</i>

1074
01:39:54,059 --> 01:39:55,399
<i>...be ready.</i>

1075
01:39:57,133 --> 01:39:59,087
Why has he not used his weapon yet?

1076
01:39:59,272 --> 01:40:01,832
Because he wants to find somewhere
to impact with maximum damage.

1077
01:40:01,833 --> 01:40:03,847
He needs a ventilation system.

1078
01:40:04,645 --> 01:40:06,138
Circulating area, right?

1079
01:40:06,139 --> 01:40:08,930
Aye, sir. There's a atmospheric regulator core.

1080
01:40:08,931 --> 01:40:10,077
Lieutenant, contact Yorktown...

1081
01:40:10,078 --> 01:40:12,089
...make sure they shut it down before it finds Krall.

1082
01:40:12,841 --> 01:40:13,976
How we access the core?

1083
01:40:15,193 --> 01:40:17,687
Well, there is a maintenance tower
at the stations gravitational nexus.

1084
01:40:17,688 --> 01:40:18,762
That's the only way.

1085
01:40:18,763 --> 01:40:21,069
Scotty,
get over there and make sure it gets shutdown.

1086
01:40:21,214 --> 01:40:22,813
Classy, with me.

1087
01:40:35,998 --> 01:40:38,094
That mechanism is impossible to shut down.

1088
01:40:38,317 --> 01:40:39,355
Alright, well.

1089
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:43,248
Let's see about that.

1090
01:40:50,895 --> 01:40:52,967
Mr. Scott,
why is that thing still on?

1091
01:40:53,002 --> 01:40:55,892
I'm working on that, sir, but as you can imagine
there's a lot of safety protocols, so...

1092
01:40:55,927 --> 01:40:58,342
I need to think that you know keeps everybody alive.

1093
01:40:58,377 --> 01:40:59,614
Find something out.

1094
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:02,594
Be careful captain.
A gravity is gonna get a bit screwy...

1095
01:41:02,629 --> 01:41:03,966
...the closer you get to the center.

1096
01:41:04,754 --> 01:41:07,588
We should scan the operations schematics.
See if there is a backdoor.

1097
01:41:07,623 --> 01:41:09,047
Classy, I'm gonna need your eyes.

1098
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:29,425
What happened when you were out there...

1099
01:41:29,449 --> 01:41:31,449
Edison.

1100
01:41:32,193 --> 01:41:33,803
Edison?

1101
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:39,614
I have to say Kirk

1102
01:41:40,838 --> 01:41:43,189
I missed being me.

1103
01:41:44,497 --> 01:41:47,129
We lost ourselves,

1104
01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:48,779
But gained a purpose.

1105
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:52,761
It means to bring the galaxy a struggle

1106
01:41:53,162 --> 01:41:55,626
that made humanity strong.

1107
01:41:56,476 --> 01:41:58,294
I think you underestimate humanity.

1108
01:41:58,295 --> 01:41:59,813
I fought for humanity!

1109
01:42:00,783 --> 01:42:05,430
We lost millions with the Xindi
and Romulan wars.

1110
01:42:05,531 --> 01:42:06,862
And for what?

1111
01:42:07,089 --> 01:42:10,664
For the Federation to sit
in the captain's chair.

1112
01:42:10,665 --> 01:42:13,703
And play brat with the enemy?

1113
01:42:14,089 --> 01:42:16,616
We change. We have to.

1114
01:42:17,567 --> 01:42:20,363
We spend the rest of our lives
fighting the same battles.

1115
01:42:57,769 --> 01:42:58,957
You've lost!

1116
01:42:59,843 --> 01:43:01,547
You know you can not get back there.

1117
01:43:04,823 --> 01:43:06,411
You are out.

1118
01:43:07,296 --> 01:43:08,934
Like you did?

1119
01:43:11,057 --> 01:43:13,098
I read your simple log.

1120
01:43:13,521 --> 01:43:15,737
Captain James T. Kirk.

1121
01:43:15,738 --> 01:43:17,576
At least I know who I am.

1122
01:43:18,982 --> 01:43:20,374
I'm a soldier.

1123
01:43:21,054 --> 01:43:23,583
You won the war, Edison.

1124
01:43:23,999 --> 01:43:25,443
You gave us peace.

1125
01:43:26,463 --> 01:43:27,742
Peace...

1126
01:43:28,699 --> 01:43:31,073
It's not a world I was born into.

1127
01:43:34,432 --> 01:43:35,627
- Scotty.
- Captain.

1128
01:43:35,662 --> 01:43:39,135
He is using the gravitational slitch
to get back to the center.

1129
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:22,481
No!

1130
01:44:33,582 --> 01:44:34,659
Weapon's in the chamber.

1131
01:44:34,694 --> 01:44:36,514
Captain we have to stop the processor

1132
01:44:36,549 --> 01:44:39,128
or everything breathing
in Yorktown is dead.

1133
01:44:48,104 --> 01:44:50,550
You can't stop it.

1134
01:44:52,543 --> 01:44:54,096
You will die.

1135
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:55,843
I'd rather die saving lives

1136
01:44:57,496 --> 01:44:59,158
Than to live with taking them.

1137
01:45:00,574 --> 01:45:02,153
That's what I was born into.

1138
01:45:03,781 --> 01:45:06,122
- Scotty.
- Captain, I think we can redirect it.

1139
01:45:06,157 --> 01:45:07,951
There's a seal construction, perhaps

1140
01:45:07,986 --> 01:45:09,514
that will let you vent the weapon into space.

1141
01:45:09,549 --> 01:45:13,163
Now we can override the locks, from out here,
but you have to activate the hatch.

1142
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:15,073
- Isn't there any button?
- It's not a button.

1143
01:45:15,108 --> 01:45:16,914
It's a simple lever under the white panel.

1144
01:45:18,201 --> 01:45:19,944
- Got it.
- And there's 4 of them.

1145
01:45:20,956 --> 01:45:24,040
Once you have activated lock,
there should quitting immediately.

1146
01:45:24,075 --> 01:45:26,201
If the hatch is opened when the CPU starts next cycle

1147
01:45:26,236 --> 01:45:27,771
you are gonna get sucked into space.

1148
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:30,259
What happens when the hatch isn't opened?

1149
01:45:30,294 --> 01:45:31,981
You are gonna get sucked into big fan.

1150
01:45:32,016 --> 01:45:33,850
With the weapon and we all die.

1151
01:45:35,863 --> 01:45:37,769
Dammit, Jim, you won't make it out on time.

1152
01:45:47,617 --> 01:45:48,893
The fan.

1153
01:45:50,289 --> 01:45:52,026
Get out of there, James T.

1154
01:45:53,336 --> 01:45:55,521
Scotty, the last hatch won't open.

1155
01:46:02,635 --> 01:46:05,251
- Scotty.
- Work fast, Captain. Time is running out.

1156
01:46:05,403 --> 01:46:06,903
He is not gonna make it.

1157
01:47:21,144 --> 01:47:23,204
What would I do without you, Spock?

1158
01:47:56,227 --> 01:47:59,228
For decades,
the Federation thought that he was a hero.

1159
01:47:59,601 --> 01:48:01,968
I guess time would judge us all.

1160
01:48:04,090 --> 01:48:05,562
He just got lost.

1161
01:48:05,876 --> 01:48:08,135
You saved this entire base, Kirk.

1162
01:48:09,428 --> 01:48:12,398
Millions of souls. Thank you.

1163
01:48:12,754 --> 01:48:15,594
It wasn't just me. Never is.

1164
01:48:16,096 --> 01:48:19,939
It's easy to say that
the position of Vice Admiral, it's yours.

1165
01:48:20,823 --> 01:48:22,740
No one deserves it more.

1166
01:48:26,091 --> 01:48:28,215
Vice Admirals don't fly do they?

1167
01:48:29,267 --> 01:48:30,290
No.

1168
01:48:30,314 --> 01:48:31,714
They don't.

1169
01:48:34,314 --> 01:48:35,904
No offense, ma'am but...

1170
01:48:37,593 --> 01:48:39,039
...where's the fun in that?

1171
01:49:41,638 --> 01:49:43,774
You didn't even try to get our time reduced?

1172
01:49:44,109 --> 01:49:45,315
Why would I get it reduced?

1173
01:49:45,350 --> 01:49:47,656
Bones, we know our way
through the nebula now.

1174
01:49:48,014 --> 01:49:49,632
Can you imagine, what we'll find?

1175
01:49:49,633 --> 01:49:51,823
Alien deathspots,
Calvenom killing us.

1176
01:49:52,116 --> 01:49:54,361
Deadly space worm, viruses and bacteria.

1177
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:58,255
Incomprehensible cosmic anomalies
that could wipe us out in an instant.

1178
01:49:58,754 --> 01:50:00,621
It's gonna be so much fun.

1179
01:50:02,216 --> 01:50:04,416
By the way, where're we going?
I thought we were gonna get drink.

1180
01:50:04,803 --> 01:50:07,407
I know you told me to keep it
under wraps, but...

1181
01:50:07,442 --> 01:50:09,361
Happy birthday!

1182
01:50:12,514 --> 01:50:14,259
This was it?

1183
01:50:14,829 --> 01:50:16,359
Thanks, Scotty.

1184
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:22,086
Everybody raise your glass
to Captain James T. Kirk.

1185
01:50:23,719 --> 01:50:25,037
- Captain Kirk.
- Thanks, everybody.

1186
01:50:25,671 --> 01:50:27,963
- To the Enterprise...
- To the Enterprise.

1187
01:50:28,404 --> 01:50:31,626
...and to absent friends.

1188
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:34,922
Cheers.

1189
01:50:36,034 --> 01:50:38,418
Alright, let's get this party started.

1190
01:50:43,823 --> 01:50:45,843
I thought you have to finish your mission report.

1191
01:50:46,814 --> 01:50:48,084
I do.

1192
01:50:48,218 --> 01:50:51,225
But I thought it would be more pleasing
to engage with you socially.

1193
01:50:53,645 --> 01:50:55,339
You old romantic.

1194
01:51:03,425 --> 01:51:07,655
Do you know that scotch was actually
invented by little lady in Russia?

1195
01:51:09,279 --> 01:51:10,779
Excuse me.

1196
01:51:13,121 --> 01:51:15,717
Did you drink all those yourself?
I am impressed.

1197
01:51:16,131 --> 01:51:18,018
Someone said that it will take my edge off.

1198
01:51:19,005 --> 01:51:20,792
My edge is still not off.

1199
01:51:21,338 --> 01:51:22,904
Alright, gold, maybe this will help.

1200
01:51:24,483 --> 01:51:26,309
Captain pulled a few strings.

1201
01:51:26,695 --> 01:51:30,315
That is the acceptance to the Starfleet Academy,
if you want to.

1202
01:51:30,371 --> 01:51:33,120
We have a lot rules.
No less, no more.

1203
01:51:33,366 --> 01:51:35,328
Will I have to wear that uniform?

1204
01:51:36,717 --> 01:51:38,406
I'm afraid so.

1205
01:51:40,675 --> 01:51:41,765
Hey, Keenser.

1206
01:51:41,813 --> 01:51:43,928
Kevin, is there no way you wear pants?

1207
01:51:50,882 --> 01:51:52,697
I heard about Ambassador Spock.

1208
01:51:54,919 --> 01:51:57,154
Is that what you wanted to mention that...

1209
01:51:57,278 --> 01:51:59,278
... time during the tribunal?

1210
01:52:01,675 --> 01:52:02,861
More or less.

1211
01:52:05,321 --> 01:52:07,817
I trust your meeting with Commodore
Paris went well.

1212
01:52:11,653 --> 01:52:13,258
More or less.

1213
01:52:21,189 --> 01:52:22,720
You really want to head back out there, huh?

1214
01:52:50,386 --> 01:52:53,156
Space, the final frontier.

1215
01:52:54,844 --> 01:52:57,830
These are voyagers
of the starship Enterprise.

1216
01:52:58,449 --> 01:53:02,339
It's continuing mission to explore strange new worlds...

1217
01:53:02,758 --> 01:53:06,150
... To seek out new life and new civilizations...

1218
01:53:06,217 --> 01:53:09,798
... To boldly where no man has gone before.

1219
01:53:12,022 --> 01:53:20,022
