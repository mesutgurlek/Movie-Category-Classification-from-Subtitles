1
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,542
Look at yourselves.

2
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:37,253
Unplug from your chairs,
get up and look in the mirror.

3
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:41,246
What you see is how God made you.

4
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:45,969
We're not meant to experience the
world through a machine.

5
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,170
Surrogates

6
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:57,445
14 years ago

7
00:00:58,672 --> 00:01:01,760
What you're telling me is -
a monkey is operating this arm

8
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,574
with nothing but his thoughts?

9
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,939
Absolutely.

10
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,205
There are 100 sensors,

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,113
each listening to a different brain cell
or neuron.

12
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:19,221
Physicaly disabed people
will be able to operate

13
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:21,711
fully synthetic bodies.

14
00:01:21,827 --> 00:01:24,383
It provides a tremendous amount of hope for the future.

15
00:01:24,924 --> 00:01:26,558
11 years ago

16
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:31,269
Because of the technology that
we have, at a time of war

17
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:33,293
we're going to start seeing this more and more.

18
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:37,260
As manufacturing capacity expanded for military/industrial use

19
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,987
Surrogates became affordable to the general public

20
00:01:40,102 --> 00:01:42,388
Causing a revolution in how
in how we live.

21
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:46,542
The ability to leave your home
without risk of disease or injury

22
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:50,206
To have perfect looks without trips to the gym
or plastic surgery

23
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:53,361
There is no question that at some
point they will be persons like anyone else

24
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:56,337
They will not be human, but that they will be part
of our community?

25
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:58,044
There is no question
in my mind.

26
00:01:58,314 --> 00:02:00,569
The decision came down 5 to 4

27
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:04,310
That the Supreme Court ruled in favor
of the use of surrogates in daily life.

28
00:02:08,865 --> 00:02:11,513
Right now, we are witnessing an
event

29
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:13,700
That is of an evolutionary significance

30
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:15,729
7 years ago

31
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:19,539
According to VSI, the industries
leading manufacturer,

32
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:22,136
over 98% of world population

33
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:25,417
uses a surrogate in all
facets of their daily life

34
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:33,143
We're in the midst of profound changes that are things
that were once unimaginable have become inevitable

35
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:35,803
Since the global embrace of surrogacy

36
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:38,075
crime rates have dropped
to record lows

37
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:41,177
We have witnessed and incredible
reduction in violent crime

38
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:43,810
communicable disease and discrimination.

39
00:02:43,926 --> 00:02:46,516
Problems that have plagued
societies for centuries

40
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,403
solved almost overnight.

41
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:49,945
We are the creators.

42
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,118
We will be making them

43
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:53,930
Do everything for us.All in one machine.

44
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:56,031
3 years ago

45
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,816
But there is a minority who
actively oppose Surrogates

46
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:01,809
And are moving to limit their use.

47
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:06,022
Many people will see this

48
00:03:06,138 --> 00:03:09,494
as the invasion of the inhuman.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,419
They've established reservations or
Surrogacy free zones

50
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:15,601
in major cities around the country.

51
00:03:19,902 --> 00:03:21,444
They are led by Zaire Powell

52
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,464
or as he is better known
to his followers

53
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,474
The Prophet.

54
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:26,894
Those machines walking around out there

55
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:28,409
They're a lie.

56
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:34,730
You have been sold a lie.

57
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:36,695
Presend Day

58
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:47,180
You're going to love Tosca

59
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:50,147
-Alright, but don't tell me how it ends.
- The way they all end.

60
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:52,176
Everyone dies.

61
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:56,812
I'm so glad you could
come back east for a visit.

62
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:59,436
Well... anything for a break from exams.

63
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:01,420
We're almost there.

64
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:03,829
Listen... thanks for lending it to me.

65
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:05,687
Have a wonderful time.

66
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,707
I love you.

67
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,546
I love you too Dad.

68
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:19,412
You know Armando

69
00:04:19,602 --> 00:04:21,216
I'm not really in the mood for opera

70
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:23,630
Four Point?

71
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:26,208
You read my mind.

72
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:12,043
Get lost meat bag

73
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:57,509
I'm agent Peters.

74
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,494
This is Agent Greer... FBI.

75
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:04,471
Yeah... some jackass on a motorcycle
wiped out a bunch of units

76
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:05,988
So what do you need us for?

77
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:08,829
Well I was going to file just a vandalism report

78
00:07:08,944 --> 00:07:10,984
but it turns out this unit's unregistered.

79
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:19,822
Looks like it's going to need new optics

80
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:21,517
No shit

81
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:36,105
The memory chip is completely fried.

82
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:38,083
Whatya got on the girl?

83
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:40,355
Registered to a
Cameron McAllister.

84
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:42,645
He file a report?

85
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,476
No, that's just it, no calls, no nothin'

86
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,508
Come on.

87
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:02,898
Let's go talk to
our operator.

88
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:14,785
Cam?

89
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:18,098
Maybe nobody's home.

90
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:24,491
My Surries in for an upgrade

91
00:08:24,606 --> 00:08:25,799
and they gave me this crappy loaner.

92
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:26,916
Could you?

93
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:28,132
Certainly.

94
00:08:36,844 --> 00:08:37,827
Cam?

95
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:43,526
Cam's a good tenant you know,
pays the rent on time, never leaves the apartment.

96
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:00,361
Cam?

97
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,518
Cam?

98
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:06,484
[Screams] Oh my God!

99
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:10,512
Don't touch anything, please.

100
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,255
I'll call it in.

101
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:24,205
- You're sure this is Cameron McAllister?
- Yes!

102
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,684
This is Agent Peters, we
tracked down the operator.

103
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:36,662
Yeah

104
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:39,700
Better send a coroner

105
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,780
Connection interrupted.

106
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:49,171
Have you ever seen anything like this?

107
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,596
Morning

108
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:41,707
Where's your....

109
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,584
In the... charge room.

110
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:57,594
You pull another all nighter?

111
00:12:58,586 --> 00:12:59,389
Yes I did

112
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:03,888
Why don't you think about taking a break?

113
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:05,953
- A break?
- Mmmmhmmm

114
00:13:06,856 --> 00:13:08,578
I got some vacation time saved up

115
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:10,174
How about Hawaii?

116
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:12,257
Lisa said she got an amazing deal

117
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:13,348
Hawaii would be great

118
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:17,577
She had this totally buff Surrie in Maui,
She took it surfing, parasailing, deep sea diving.

119
00:13:18,203 --> 00:13:20,206
You know that rental place on Boilston?

120
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:23,507
I was thinking about US.
You and me going away some place together.

121
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,821
And leave our units at home?
Are you kidding?

122
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:32,635
- We could take a drive out to the Cape? We haven't done that for a while...
- Could talk about this another time?

123
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:36,856
You now I should get to work, the shops
been really busy, everyone wants me to look for somewhere and...

124
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:42,119
Yeah... I was just thinking that...
Ummm...

125
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,563
It just feels like we...

126
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:50,682
- Haven't really spent much time together lately.
- We're together every day.

127
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:55,307
Surrogates...
Not the same...

128
00:13:58,134 --> 00:13:59,350
It's better.

129
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:14,360
College West, San Diego.

130
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:16,975
Yo Canter?

131
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:18,542
He's been in there all weekend.

132
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,662
He's gonna miss the Psych final.

133
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:26,427
Jesus!

134
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,204
Someone call the cops!

135
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:32,045
We are confronted by an unprecedented situation.

136
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:36,393
Two people have died while
connected to their stim chairs.

137
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:41,497
According to the pathologist,
their brains were liquefied in their skulls.

138
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,730
What ever happened to
their surrogates, killed them.

139
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:47,580
Sir?

140
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:50,438
- How's it even possible?
- We don't know.

141
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,720
I'm imposing a total media blackout.

142
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:58,259
No one in this office is going to be responsible
for setting off a nationwide panic.

143
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:03,119
The public cannot be allowed to get the idea
that using a surrogate can be fatal.

144
00:15:07,918 --> 00:15:10,316
Tuxedo boys last moments.

145
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:14,041
Get lost meat bag.

146
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:19,886
- Looks like we got ourselves a witness.
- Mmmmhmm.

147
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,611
Hang on...

148
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,185
- What is that?
- Exactly...

149
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:39,694
- Some kind of weapon.
- Anything yet?

150
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:43,896
Hang on to yourself, I think
we may actually have a homicide here.

151
00:15:44,758 --> 00:15:46,598
Come here and look at this.

152
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,131
- Are you serious?
- No we don't know that for sure.

153
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:51,981
Yeah but what if it is a homicide?
When was the last one?

154
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:54,262
This could be huge.

155
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:00,454
- Yeah, Lee go.
- We got your next of kin.

156
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,149
I hope you're sitting down.

157
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,694
The kids father is Lionel Canter.

158
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:07,463
As in the inventor of surrogates, Lionel Canter.

159
00:16:10,215 --> 00:16:13,452
Jarid Canter, son of Dr. Lionel Canter was found dead

160
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,013
In his Southern California
dormitory this morning

161
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:18,088
Cause of death
remains unknown.

162
00:16:18,203 --> 00:16:20,450
A college sophmore, Jarid
was the only son

163
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:23,580
of the man known around the world
as the father of surrogacy.

164
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:25,889
The Former Chairman of VSI

165
00:16:26,004 --> 00:16:29,180
Shaped it into one of the largest
corporations in the world.

166
00:16:29,295 --> 00:16:32,173
However, a split between
Canter and his VSI partners

167
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:34,077
Over the direction of the company

168
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:36,421
Led to Canters firing
seven years ago.

169
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:40,298
Publicly humiliated and forced out
of the company he helped to build

170
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:43,499
Canter has since remained
absent from the public eye.

171
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:47,006
Dr. Canter's expecting you.

172
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,918
He actually lives here?

173
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:49,956
I didn't say that.

174
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,343
You'll be speaking with
one of his surrogates.

175
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:57,230
I work for Dr. Canter.

176
00:16:58,366 --> 00:16:59,991
His private elevator is this way.

177
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:17,286
Please, wait in here.

178
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:22,249
What a nice place.

179
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:24,187
It should be.

180
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:27,623
It's a piece of every surrogate they sell.

181
00:17:35,356 --> 00:17:36,258
Dr. Canter?

182
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,520
That's right.

183
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:39,197
You're with the FBI?

184
00:17:39,991 --> 00:17:40,892
Yes we are.

185
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:42,414
This way.

186
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:45,713
I can't help but notice the similarities between

187
00:17:45,828 --> 00:17:48,716
your surrogate... and the
one your son Jared was using.

188
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:52,119
I never really knew
Jarid as a child.

189
00:17:53,512 --> 00:17:56,425
He grew up with his mother in California
Who kept him from me.

190
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,491
When he went to college I encourage him
to borrow my surrogates whenever he wanted.

191
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:02,096
How did you managed to do that?

192
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:04,588
A Surrie has to be coded
to your neural signature.

193
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:07,302
I am not exactly your
average VSI consumer.

194
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,284
This was just a way for me
to spend time with my son.

195
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,828
It's a felony to inhabit a surrogate
registered to another operator.

196
00:18:18,323 --> 00:18:21,489
No offense Dr. Canter.
We're just trying to straighten out our facts.

197
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:23,206
What is this?

198
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:26,082
- Some kind of Good Cop, Bad Cop routine?
- No sir.

199
00:18:26,197 --> 00:18:27,435
- You tryin' to handle me?
- No sir.

200
00:18:27,624 --> 00:18:29,076
Because I'm not going to be handled.

201
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:30,365
Dr Canter...

202
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:32,998
- I know how you must feel.
- Do you?

203
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:34,828
Yes, sir.

204
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:37,524
I lost a son myself.

205
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:51,172
Do you have any idea why
someone might want to harm Jared?

206
00:18:57,194 --> 00:18:57,915
No.

207
00:18:58,853 --> 00:18:59,755
Or yourself?

208
00:19:05,225 --> 00:19:06,371
Oh my God.

209
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:09,545
If it was me they were after...

210
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,180
I'm responsible for my sons death.

211
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:23,788
Well... I guess the interview's over.

212
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:43,567
[Sobbing]
No!

213
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:50,357
<i> Robotic surrogates combine
the durability of machines</i>

214
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:52,930
<i>With the grace and beauty
of the human form</i>

215
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,842
<i>To make your life safer</i>

216
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,960
<i>And better.</i>

00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,361
<i>Whether you're....</i>

00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:02,952
<i> Get ready to live your life without any

<i> You can live your life

<i> And become anyone you want to be.</i>

221
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:11,973
<i> From the comfort and

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,621
<i> VSI, where it all began.</i>

<i> Do what you want.
Be what you want.</i>

224
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:21,392
Agents Greer and Peters?
I'm Victor Welsh.

225
00:20:21,812 --> 00:20:23,273
VP of corporate relations.

226
00:20:23,913 --> 00:20:25,031
Please Sit.

227
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:28,241
- Thanks for taking the time to see us.
- No problem.

228
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:31,336
You uh... You must know Andy Stone?

229
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:32,878
Our immediate superior.

230
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:34,393
Do give him my regards.

231
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,630
- We're from the legal department.
- Hope you don't mind if we sit in.

232
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:38,588
Not at all.

233
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:42,122
The two of you might be interested in a free software
upgrade we're offering all law enforcement officials.

234
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:45,793
Better night vision.
Improved pursuit capability.

235
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:50,113
You have any idea how a surrogates
head would explode from the inside?

236
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:56,281
Mr. Welsh isn't qualified
to answer that question.

237
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,905
What do the operators say?

238
00:20:58,248 --> 00:20:59,249
Not much.

239
00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:00,781
They're dead.

240
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:04,821
If you're trying to imply a link between VSI
products and an operators accidental death...

241
00:21:04,937 --> 00:21:06,147
I'm not implying anything.

242
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,576
I just want to know how an operator
can be killed by signals from it's surrogate.

243
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:12,217
This idea itself is absurd.

244
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:15,364
If it were possible it would defeat
the entire purpose of surrogacy.

245
00:21:15,803 --> 00:21:18,454
Surries have jumped from bridges...
Been shot....

246
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:21,330
Even... blown to bits without the
least bit of harm to their operators.

247
00:21:22,043 --> 00:21:23,719
The failsafes always kick in.

248
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:27,635
I can assure you VSI's products have the most
stringent safety standards in the industry.

249
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,493
What about a human head?

250
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:31,964
What would cause one of them to blow up?

251
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:33,506
Agent Greer...

252
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,814
We're not doctors.

253
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:36,599
Honey...

254
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:38,357
I don't know WHAT you are.

255
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,597
I mean for all I know you could be some big fat dude
sitting in a stim chair with his dick hanging out.

256
00:22:02,202 --> 00:22:03,915
Interesting technique.

257
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:06,109
I hate lawyers.

258
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,772
[Click]

259
00:22:12,142 --> 00:22:13,287
What are you doing?

260
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:29,504
Mr. Steinberg?

261
00:22:30,811 --> 00:22:32,452
Seth Steinberg?

262
00:22:35,902 --> 00:22:36,750
Hello.

263
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:37,878
Sorry.

264
00:22:38,075 --> 00:22:39,104
I was in the can.

265
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:41,403
Agent Peters, I'm Agent Greer with the FBI.

266
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:42,890
Really?

267
00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:47,915
You know with any chip this damaged...

268
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:50,412
Every circuit must have fired off at once.

269
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:51,791
Kablooey!

270
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:54,281
Have you ever seen anything like this before?

271
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:58,299
Last week a truck load of GI Joes
did come back for re-conditioning.

272
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,275
And a couple of the
Surries were missing optics.

273
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:03,078
Mind if we take a look at them?

274
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,758
Here we go.

275
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,303
No bullet holes?
No blast damage?

276
00:23:33,072 --> 00:23:35,398
No scratches.
No dirt. No mud.

277
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:37,797
Mind if I check out the identity chip?

278
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:40,240
- Heh. Yeah.
- Why not?

279
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,611
Didn't come back with one.

280
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,488
I'm down!

281
00:24:02,764 --> 00:24:03,567
I'm down.

282
00:24:03,982 --> 00:24:06,786
Damn things aren't free Polaski!
Take the snipers from behind this time.

283
00:24:06,901 --> 00:24:07,751
Yes sir!

284
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,474
Back online.

285
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:25,639
Follow me.

286
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,650
- Keep an eye on Bravo Company.
- Go kick some ass sir!

287
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,365
Agent Greer you're wasting
your time with these questions.

288
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:35,794
Why on earth would the Defense Department want to develop
a weapon that could wipe out our own troops?

289
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:38,392
So no such weapon exists...

290
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:40,411
If it did, I'd know about it.

291
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,461
And the soldier that we saw?

292
00:24:42,576 --> 00:24:45,571
We routinely remove motherboards
and optics for analysis.

293
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:48,313
Now if you'll excuse me.

294
00:24:48,701 --> 00:24:50,341
I've got to move a Peace Keeping operation.

295
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:59,053
- Check your screen
- What?

296
00:24:59,168 --> 00:25:00,217
Myles Strickland.

297
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:00,965
Who?

298
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,111
Myles Strickland, beat that!

299
00:25:03,598 --> 00:25:06,709
I did a run on criminal records

300
00:25:06,824 --> 00:25:07,899
Guess what I found?

301
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:09,783
He's already in the system.

302
00:25:10,036 --> 00:25:13,021
He was arrested a month ago
for multiple counts of armed robbery.

303
00:25:13,715 --> 00:25:15,329
And what's really weird about this...

304
00:25:15,924 --> 00:25:18,313
After he was busted...
They let him off.

305
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:20,694
Someone on the inside's protecting him.

306
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:22,885
But I put out an APB anyway.

307
00:25:37,825 --> 00:25:39,511
Visual matching.

308
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:54,078
- Cameras caught your guy.
- Where?

309
00:25:54,193 --> 00:25:56,134
Dorchester, Gore Park and Adams.

310
00:25:56,249 --> 00:25:57,885
Not far from the reservation.

311
00:25:58,076 --> 00:26:00,140
Boston PD is on its way.

312
00:26:00,654 --> 00:26:02,205
Stay here.
Keep tabs on him.

313
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,838
Wait a minute where are you going?

314
00:26:04,027 --> 00:26:05,434
Dorchester.

315
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:07,944
It wasn't too difficult.

316
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:10,910
I put his face in the system and... Bingo!
We found him in an alley.

317
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:13,823
K33 over there brought it to my attention.

318
00:26:14,057 --> 00:26:15,265
Thanks Jerry.

319
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:18,139
He's one of our best watchers.

320
00:26:18,492 --> 00:26:19,718
He's semi-retired.

321
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,126
So he gets to work out of
his beach house in Maine.

322
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,803
- Pretty sweet huh?
- Yeah, it's a nice setup you have here.

323
00:26:25,128 --> 00:26:27,319
Yeah, we can access every
Surrie on the grid here.

324
00:26:28,234 --> 00:26:29,569
Touch a button.

325
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:31,724
I can tap into anyone's feed.

326
00:26:32,312 --> 00:26:34,296
It's kinda like being inside Gods head.

327
00:26:35,964 --> 00:26:38,038
[Burps]
Ooooooh Boy... I felt that one coming.

328
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:40,274
My name's Saunders by the way.

329
00:26:42,062 --> 00:26:43,325
Jennifer Peters.

330
00:26:43,838 --> 00:26:46,174
Yeah... Yeah you are aren't you?

331
00:26:47,422 --> 00:26:48,730
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hmmm?

332
00:26:49,803 --> 00:26:50,930
Why no surrogate?

333
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,237
Me?
[Laughs]

334
00:26:53,148 --> 00:26:54,844
They've been trying to puppet me for years.

335
00:26:55,862 --> 00:26:58,044
But they ain't built a machine
that can handle this big puppy yet.

336
00:26:58,692 --> 00:27:00,198
[Alarm Sounds]
Excuse me a second...

337
00:27:02,146 --> 00:27:03,849
We have an assault and
battery in progress.

338
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:05,977
I need warrants to shut
them down immediately.

339
00:27:06,404 --> 00:27:08,658
Charlie 4639er.

340
00:27:08,892 --> 00:27:11,030
Sierra 7855

341
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:14,672
Let's see if they have a
security camera in the hotel...

342
00:27:16,485 --> 00:27:17,685
Looks like there is one.

343
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:21,508
Warrant recieved.

344
00:27:22,112 --> 00:27:23,284
Agent Peters...

345
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,916
Watch this.

346
00:27:25,617 --> 00:27:26,217
Boom.

347
00:27:26,618 --> 00:27:27,618
Boom.

348
00:27:28,782 --> 00:27:30,693
Since when have you been
able to cut off operators?

349
00:27:31,054 --> 00:27:33,480
It's brand new software.
I call it buffering.

350
00:27:33,595 --> 00:27:35,472
Let's me disconnect anyone
from their surrogate.

351
00:27:35,588 --> 00:27:37,256
Well that can't be legal?

352
00:27:37,371 --> 00:27:38,807
Ahhh... It's a grey area.

353
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:40,719
They don't ask, we don't tell.

354
00:27:42,017 --> 00:27:42,900
It's pretty cool huh?

355
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,379
Awww C'mon.

356
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:47,187
Relax, we're the
good guys.

357
00:28:00,343 --> 00:28:06,052
Suspect on a bike heading east of
South Hampton up a mile from the Res'

358
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:10,118
Greer, be careful, you're heading straight towards
Dread territory.  We don't have jurisdiction to fly over there.

359
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:11,483
It's restricted air space.

360
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:13,782
Greer are you there?

361
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,820
Freeze!

362
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,566
What was that?

363
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:26,125
Agghhh!!!

364
00:30:59,304 --> 00:31:01,054
Fire! Fire!

365
00:32:50,338 --> 00:32:52,656
I ain't done nothin'!
I ain't done nothin'!

366
00:32:54,547 --> 00:32:55,835
Give me the bag.

367
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:58,748
Throw it over here.

368
00:33:00,362 --> 00:33:01,995
Throw it over here.
Now!

369
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:30,796
You're an abomination.

370
00:33:31,544 --> 00:33:32,645
Oh god.

371
00:33:58,284 --> 00:34:00,097
Maggie.

372
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,766
Maggie!

373
00:34:04,852 --> 00:34:07,341
Lionel Canter is on the phone.
He's called for Greer a half dozen times.

374
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:08,937
I can't deal with this right now.

375
00:34:09,052 --> 00:34:11,408
- He's pretty upset.
- Just tell him someone will call him back.

376
00:34:11,523 --> 00:34:12,165
Peters!

377
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,584
You gotta believe me
I tried to stop him.

378
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,676
Well you didn't try hard enough.
You're done for the day.

379
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:17,640
Clock out.

380
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,259
Oh you're kidding!

381
00:34:56,274 --> 00:34:57,248
God.

382
00:34:58,919 --> 00:34:59,569
Tom?

383
00:35:01,697 --> 00:35:02,571
Oh my God!

384
00:35:02,779 --> 00:35:04,069
Call an ambulance!

385
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,902
Myles Strickland is it?

386
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,040
Why are you...

387
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:32,750
What's goin' on?

388
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:33,805
Who was it?

389
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:35,770
Who gave you the weapon?

390
00:35:36,374 --> 00:35:37,691
And paid you to use it?

391
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:40,100
I don't know!

392
00:35:40,215 --> 00:35:41,786
Myles you can't lie to me.

393
00:35:42,264 --> 00:35:43,292
I'm not lyin'.

394
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,032
I swear to God sir, I'm not lying.

395
00:35:45,747 --> 00:35:47,099
He never told me his name.

396
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:48,993
We talked on disposable cell phones.

397
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:50,463
I never saw
his face.

398
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:53,502
I couldn't tell you who he
was if my life depended on it!

399
00:35:57,318 --> 00:35:59,148
A Police chase through Dorchester concluded

400
00:35:59,263 --> 00:36:01,961
with an FBI helicopter crash landing

401
00:36:02,178 --> 00:36:04,261
inside Bostons' Dread Reservation

402
00:36:04,376 --> 00:36:06,768
Residents of the Reservation are outraged

403
00:36:06,884 --> 00:36:08,400
over what they're calling

404
00:36:08,515 --> 00:36:11,808
a gross violation of their territorial sovereignity.

405
00:36:11,923 --> 00:36:13,999
Human Coalition Leader, The Prophet

406
00:36:14,229 --> 00:36:17,538
responded in a statement made earlier today.

407
00:36:17,863 --> 00:36:19,306
They've attacked us.

408
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:23,111
Declared War on our way of
life and left us with one option:

409
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:24,639
Revolution!

410
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:28,463
We did not throw the first stone.
But we will throw the last.

411
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:36,133
Hi.

412
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:38,838
Hey.

413
00:36:40,623 --> 00:36:41,714
How's the headache?

414
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,616
Still there.

415
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:47,844
- Thanks for being here.
- Of course.

416
00:36:48,294 --> 00:36:50,188
<i>Imagine a World where
children are always safe.</i>

417
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,488
<i> a world where every child</i>

418
00:36:52,603 --> 00:36:54,651
<i> and every parent is secure.</i>

419
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:57,633
<i> Make every childhood a happy one.</i>

<i> Surrogates for kids.</i>

00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:04,166
<i> Exclusively from VSI.
Where it all Beg...</i>

422
00:37:09,273 --> 00:37:11,569
- Knock Knock.  Hey.
- Andy.  Hi.

423
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:13,156
Oh my gosh.

424
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:15,526
- I haven't seen you forever.
- I know.

425
00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:17,122
I should let you guys talk.

426
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:19,475
- Will you be okay?
- Mmmhmm

427
00:37:21,017 --> 00:37:22,180
See you tomorrow morning.

428
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:24,000
Bye.

429
00:37:24,323 --> 00:37:25,053
Bye.

430
00:37:30,437 --> 00:37:31,493
How bad?

431
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:33,990
The doctor said you're
lucky to be alive.

432
00:37:34,472 --> 00:37:35,951
Good thing you unplugged.

433
00:37:37,628 --> 00:37:39,116
You gotta go get him.

434
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:41,082
Stricklands got that weapon.

435
00:37:41,571 --> 00:37:42,779
You just get a court order...

436
00:37:42,895 --> 00:37:45,458
There won't be any court
orders, you've been suspended.

437
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:46,702
For what?

438
00:37:46,817 --> 00:37:50,029
- Tom, you violated our treaty with the Dreads.
- Forget the Treaty!

439
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:51,439
He killed 5 cops!

440
00:37:51,555 --> 00:37:54,297
Look... I'm gonna take care
of this case myself personally.  Alright?

441
00:37:55,163 --> 00:37:59,473
Now... I'm afraid the bureau won't be able to supply
you with a new surrogate until after the official inquiry.

442
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,070
Same goes for your
gun and your badge.

443
00:38:02,819 --> 00:38:04,288
Don't think about this now.

444
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:12,624
He killed 5 cops Andy.

445
00:38:16,348 --> 00:38:18,079
Take some time to heal.

446
00:38:49,634 --> 00:38:50,329
Hey.

447
00:38:51,077 --> 00:38:52,741
- Hey.
- Sorry I'm late.

448
00:38:52,842 --> 00:38:53,742
That's ok.

449
00:38:56,188 --> 00:38:57,829
Wow... You look a lot
like your synth.

450
00:38:58,406 --> 00:38:59,100
Yeah

451
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:00,796
Should we go?

452
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:09,858
How long has it been since you've
been out without a Surrie?

453
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,130
I can't even remember.

454
00:39:16,379 --> 00:39:18,733
I can't believe they didn't give
you something for the axiety.

455
00:39:33,453 --> 00:39:34,202
Greer?

456
00:39:35,077 --> 00:39:36,483
- Look... This isn't gonna work.
- I'm fine.

457
00:39:37,238 --> 00:39:38,491
I have an idea.

458
00:40:01,518 --> 00:40:02,916
Come on... This is
a really bad idea...

459
00:40:03,123 --> 00:40:05,288
It's gonna be alright.  I'm sure
we'll find you something decent.

460
00:40:13,634 --> 00:40:16,132
Now we're gonna have you
back on your feet in a sec.

461
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,583
Sync looks good.

462
00:40:19,844 --> 00:40:21,287
It's responding well to signal, right?

463
00:40:23,244 --> 00:40:24,353
It feels numb.

464
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:25,922
It's only a base model.

465
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,455
It comes with vision and hearing.

466
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,494
If you want other senses
they're extra.

467
00:40:29,738 --> 00:40:33,029
Of course if you like seeing your own
face when you look in the mirror, no problem.

468
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,734
I'll just scan your head, cast the thermo plastic

469
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,411
and you're good to go
in less than an hour.

470
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,293
Hey no charge on the improvements.

471
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,684
I'm sure you wouldn't mind taking yourself back

472
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:44,100
5, 10 years, huh?
What do you think of that?

473
00:40:44,902 --> 00:40:46,219
- Hmmm?
- I think we're done here.

474
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,847
Greer.

475
00:40:59,662 --> 00:41:00,582
Tom.

476
00:41:01,383 --> 00:41:02,183
Tom.

477
00:41:02,864 --> 00:41:05,488
Tom you can't come out
here by yourself.  It's not safe.

478
00:41:05,603 --> 00:41:07,273
- I'm fine.
- Let me take you home.

479
00:41:07,388 --> 00:41:09,108
I'm not going home.

480
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,760
Tom.  We gotta forget the case.

481
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:14,230
Stone is going to run things his way

482
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,683
and as far as we're concerned, it's over.

483
00:41:16,798 --> 00:41:19,659
It's not over until we
get that weapon back.

484
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,961
Then you gotta let me help you.

485
00:41:25,576 --> 00:41:27,670
I'm not gonna let you win.

486
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,238
Take care of yourself Peters.

487
00:42:15,892 --> 00:42:18,624
Death came to Myles Strickland

488
00:42:19,932 --> 00:42:22,574
As death comes to all men.

489
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:24,765
But for Myles

490
00:42:25,847 --> 00:42:27,307
It's not an ending.

491
00:42:28,777 --> 00:42:30,481
It's a new beginning.

492
00:42:32,113 --> 00:42:35,666
When you sacrifice your
own personal desires

493
00:42:37,498 --> 00:42:38,940
for a greater cause, a greater good.

494
00:42:40,483 --> 00:42:41,890
You never die.

495
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,649
You never disappear.

496
00:42:45,701 --> 00:42:48,226
That is what it means to be human.

497
00:42:49,723 --> 00:42:51,354
There is no alternative

498
00:42:51,851 --> 00:42:54,682
You can try to escape by
living through a puppet

499
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:56,942
Through a machine.

500
00:42:57,572 --> 00:43:01,514
But deep down inside, you
know you're living a lie

501
00:43:03,632 --> 00:43:05,823
Here, inside these walls

502
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:07,823
We understand the truth.

503
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:17,573
We sacrifice many modern
pleasures and conveniences

504
00:43:17,688 --> 00:43:19,746
to feel truly connected.

505
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,271
Not with machines

506
00:43:24,657 --> 00:43:25,766
But with ourselves.

507
00:43:30,761 --> 00:43:32,628
This is the human condition.

508
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:35,006
This is what gives life meaning.

509
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:36,864
My friends.

510
00:43:37,288 --> 00:43:40,786
Soon the day will come
when surrogacy must end.

511
00:43:41,463 --> 00:43:43,320
That day, I promise you

512
00:43:43,974 --> 00:43:45,173
Is close at hand.

513
00:43:45,804 --> 00:43:48,653
The day... we get a second chance.

514
00:44:17,594 --> 00:44:18,641
Excuse me.

515
00:44:20,435 --> 00:44:21,760
- Can I help you?
- Yeah

516
00:44:22,004 --> 00:44:23,861
I'd like to speak to
The Prohet for a minute.

517
00:44:24,113 --> 00:44:25,510
You and everybody else bud, no.

518
00:44:25,826 --> 00:44:27,413
You some kind of cop or somethin'?

519
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,361
You have no jurisdiction here.

520
00:44:29,476 --> 00:44:31,345
Can I talk to you
about Myles Strickland please?

521
00:44:36,386 --> 00:44:37,341
Enough.

522
00:44:40,768 --> 00:44:43,185
It's different when you actually feel the pain.

523
00:44:43,842 --> 00:44:44,663
Isn't it?

524
00:44:46,782 --> 00:44:48,378
What happened to Strickland?

525
00:44:50,399 --> 00:44:51,913
Was he a friend of yours?

526
00:44:52,409 --> 00:44:53,455
He had a weapon.

527
00:44:53,879 --> 00:44:55,519
A very dangerous weapon.

528
00:44:56,881 --> 00:44:59,288
My people will do
anything to get this back.

529
00:45:01,988 --> 00:45:06,324
[Laughs]
Well... if I happen to come
across such a weapon

530
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:10,192
I promise to have it
delivered to your door.

531
00:45:11,825 --> 00:45:13,529
Show him to the gates.

532
00:45:15,225 --> 00:45:16,279
Gently.

533
00:45:57,987 --> 00:45:59,019
Agent Greer.

534
00:45:59,587 --> 00:46:01,319
May I offer you a ride?

535
00:46:04,752 --> 00:46:06,537
You'll have to excuse my appearance.

536
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:09,377
It's not safe for me to
use my usual surrogates.

537
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:11,748
Dr. Canter.

538
00:46:11,864 --> 00:46:13,642
This is one of VSI's newer models.

539
00:46:14,643 --> 00:46:15,978
How long have you been following me?

540
00:46:16,093 --> 00:46:19,458
Long enough to know you're getting
nowhere solving my sons murder.

541
00:46:22,644 --> 00:46:24,294
You lost a child Agent Greer?

542
00:46:25,818 --> 00:46:26,548
How?

543
00:46:29,984 --> 00:46:31,426
Car accident.

544
00:46:36,354 --> 00:46:37,823
It was just an accident.

545
00:46:39,473 --> 00:46:40,447
I'm sorry.

546
00:46:45,205 --> 00:46:48,731
I can think of no worse tragedy
than a parent outliving a child.

547
00:46:53,006 --> 00:46:54,350
All I can tell you

548
00:46:55,793 --> 00:46:57,569
is that the man who killed your son is dead.

549
00:46:58,281 --> 00:46:59,760
His name was Myles Strickland.

550
00:47:00,483 --> 00:47:01,944
Lived on the Res'.

551
00:47:03,874 --> 00:47:05,343
He was killed by his own people.

552
00:47:05,902 --> 00:47:06,886
And that's it?

553
00:47:07,373 --> 00:47:08,391
Case solved?

554
00:47:09,533 --> 00:47:11,688
One man didn't act on his own.

555
00:47:12,906 --> 00:47:14,358
Whatever killed my son

556
00:47:14,473 --> 00:47:17,441
was an extraordinary
sophisticated technology.

557
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,110
Far beyond the capabilites of the Dreads.

558
00:47:20,707 --> 00:47:23,429
We're talking about a
billion dollar weapons project.

559
00:47:24,268 --> 00:47:26,468
Who do you know spends money like that?

560
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,849
Focus on the weapon, where it came from.

561
00:47:55,496 --> 00:47:56,759
Mmmm do me.

562
00:48:02,608 --> 00:48:04,439
How was it?

563
00:48:14,281 --> 00:48:16,662
- Hey Maggie?
- No, thank you.

564
00:48:17,086 --> 00:48:18,800
Come on... it'll take the edge off.

565
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:29,459
Tom?
Honey?

566
00:48:33,691 --> 00:48:35,287
I thought you were still in the hospital?

567
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:36,324
Yeah...

568
00:48:37,379 --> 00:48:38,497
I can see that.

569
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:39,922
What happened?

570
00:48:41,704 --> 00:48:45,049
Tom I don't want you going out
without your Surrie ever again.

571
00:48:45,144 --> 00:48:48,376
- Tom?
- You look very nice, Sexy.

572
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,784
Ok... Don't start.
I'm sorry, those guys...

573
00:48:50,982 --> 00:48:54,062
They're friends of Brigettes, she
brought them over, she wanted to go to this party...

574
00:48:54,261 --> 00:48:55,390
I didn't even want to go.

575
00:48:55,506 --> 00:48:57,113
How long have you been jacking?

576
00:48:57,228 --> 00:48:58,393
I don't.

577
00:48:59,973 --> 00:49:01,244
I don't do it Tom.

578
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,391
And what does it matter if I did?
Why are you being like this?

579
00:49:04,157 --> 00:49:05,492
Okay go have a good time.

580
00:49:40,876 --> 00:49:42,274
Tom stop it!

581
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:04,246
Tom?

582
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,518
Tom, what was that?

583
00:50:08,315 --> 00:50:10,199
- What?
- What you want from me?

584
00:50:17,151 --> 00:50:18,269
I want you...

585
00:50:19,663 --> 00:50:20,934
...My wife.

586
00:50:22,494 --> 00:50:23,930
I am your wife.

587
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:25,433
And you won't see it.

588
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:27,002
No. God.

589
00:50:28,247 --> 00:50:29,085
No you're not.

590
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:34,675
Not...
Not... this.

591
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:37,756
Not this... thing...
This...

592
00:50:41,988 --> 00:50:43,159
I just want you.

593
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,124
And I want the woman that's in that room.

594
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,440
My wife.

595
00:50:52,536 --> 00:50:54,188
Things have changed Tom.

596
00:50:54,303 --> 00:50:56,359
You're... No you've changed.
You're just scared.

597
00:50:56,474 --> 00:50:58,487
You're just scared...
We could go talk to somebody...

598
00:50:59,561 --> 00:51:02,412
Maggie...
Maggie your my wife.

599
00:52:00,694 --> 00:52:03,282
Agent Greer?
Is that... Is that you?

600
00:52:03,742 --> 00:52:04,445
Yeah.

601
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:08,512
- You look... You look terrible.
- Thanks you too.

602
00:52:50,956 --> 00:52:53,897
The chips completely fried.
What do you got on the girl?

603
00:52:54,267 --> 00:52:56,196
Come on...
Let's go talk to her Op.

604
00:52:57,642 --> 00:52:59,634
We can we access any Surrie in the grid.

605
00:53:00,364 --> 00:53:03,069
Touch of a Button, I can
tap into anyones feed.

606
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,456
Transfer to remote operator.

607
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:41,793
I wish I could help.

608
00:53:42,189 --> 00:53:43,587
This thing killed 5 cops.

609
00:53:43,984 --> 00:53:46,482
One of my men.
Almost put me in the ground.

610
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:49,994
I know it's a weapon.
I want to know what kind.

611
00:53:50,046 --> 00:53:53,138
- You're asking me to compromise highly
classified information...
- I know where it is.

612
00:53:53,905 --> 00:53:54,807
Where is it?

613
00:53:55,843 --> 00:53:56,529
Right...

614
00:54:04,155 --> 00:54:05,508
Is called an O.D.

615
00:54:06,229 --> 00:54:07,735
Overload Device.

616
00:54:09,298 --> 00:54:12,030
The idea was to end
the battle with one shot.

617
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,555
Giving the software virus straight to the CPU.

618
00:54:15,908 --> 00:54:17,846
Disables the Surries instantly.

619
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:21,419
We didn't know the virus would
defeat the built in failsafes.

620
00:54:22,754 --> 00:54:23,980
...kill the operators.

621
00:54:24,287 --> 00:54:25,523
Who makes it?

622
00:54:27,362 --> 00:54:28,417
VSI.

623
00:54:30,426 --> 00:54:31,517
After the test

624
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:34,636
the project was scrapped.

625
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:37,062
Every unit was destroyed.

626
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:38,905
Except this one right?

627
00:54:41,655 --> 00:54:42,592
Where is it?

628
00:54:43,503 --> 00:54:45,406
Right now it's in the hands of the Human Coalition.

629
00:54:45,521 --> 00:54:47,137
- How long have they had it?
- A day...

630
00:54:47,252 --> 00:54:48,499
Maybe two.

631
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:51,484
This is out of your hands.

632
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,620
Military will handle this.

633
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:03,059
- You called for us?
- Take this to

634
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,214
the federal building downtown.

635
00:55:06,224 --> 00:55:07,622
A woman will meet you there.

636
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:10,149
Agent Jennifer Peters.

637
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:13,539
You're to give it to her... and her alone.

638
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:22,222
Peters.

639
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:24,270
What are you doing?

640
00:55:24,936 --> 00:55:26,848
Just a background check on VSI.

641
00:55:27,443 --> 00:55:28,625
Structural stuff.

642
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,774
Those are internal financial records.

643
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:32,776
Talk to Jenkins in corporate.

644
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:34,399
6th Floor.

645
00:55:39,397 --> 00:55:40,903
Don't forget the cheek bones.

646
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,853
Okay, honey.
Face off.

647
00:55:56,699 --> 00:55:57,646
Maggs.

648
00:56:04,849 --> 00:56:05,876
Hiya Tom.

649
00:56:08,423 --> 00:56:11,083
Those ugh... Smile muscles need to set.

650
00:56:14,077 --> 00:56:15,690
- Hey.
- Hi.

651
00:56:17,097 --> 00:56:18,496
I'm sorry about last night.

652
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:20,439
I'm at work Tom.

653
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,720
- I didn't come here to argue.
- Good.

654
00:56:27,075 --> 00:56:29,213
See I feel like I've gone crazy.

655
00:56:32,926 --> 00:56:34,278
It's...
I just...

656
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,317
I love you.

657
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:41,017
I love this smart, beautiful

658
00:56:41,774 --> 00:56:43,541
Intelligent, funny

659
00:56:44,795 --> 00:56:45,840
Woman... And...

660
00:56:48,022 --> 00:56:49,294
I can't sleep.

661
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:53,171
And when I do... I have these dreams that are...

662
00:56:58,737 --> 00:57:00,703
And I can't stop
thinking about him.

663
00:57:01,753 --> 00:57:03,499
Tom... don't...

664
00:57:04,031 --> 00:57:05,573
Don't you ever think about him?

665
00:57:06,321 --> 00:57:07,999
Of course I think about him Tom.

666
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,651
You say you don't sleep?

667
00:57:09,767 --> 00:57:11,130
You say you have nightmares?

668
00:57:11,245 --> 00:57:14,485
That girl who you say
is funny and charming and whitty...

669
00:57:14,881 --> 00:57:17,145
And has a great smile...
she doesn't smile anymore.

670
00:57:17,948 --> 00:57:19,020
I don't believe that.

671
00:57:19,263 --> 00:57:21,706
The only reason I can get up in the
morning and get out of the house

672
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:23,555
Is because THIS is who I am now.

673
00:57:23,772 --> 00:57:25,214
- That's okay, honey.
- No, no.

674
00:57:25,611 --> 00:57:27,180
- No.
- Maggie.
- NO!

675
00:57:27,669 --> 00:57:28,958
Maggie wait.

676
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:28,750
Brothers and sisters gather
close and prepare yourselves.

677
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,707
The day of the resurrection is upon us.

678
00:58:31,822 --> 00:58:35,513
The day we make history.
The day we launch the revolution!

679
00:58:42,271 --> 00:58:44,047
We all know what we're looking for.

680
00:58:44,162 --> 00:58:47,167
Remember...  Do not fire
unless absolutely necessary.

681
00:58:49,403 --> 00:58:50,972
Biologicals here.

682
00:58:58,013 --> 00:58:59,113
Over there!

683
00:59:07,387 --> 00:59:11,855
- Cease fire!
- Hands on your head.
- Cease fire.

684
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:22,754
My God.

685
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:49,469
I couldn't figure out why
the cops let Strickland off.

686
00:59:49,866 --> 00:59:51,733
So I started going
through the payroll records.

687
00:59:53,002 --> 00:59:54,292
You won't believe this.

688
00:59:54,407 --> 00:59:56,745
- For the last 16 months...
- He was working for us.

689
00:59:57,168 --> 00:59:57,980
That's right.

690
00:59:58,935 --> 01:00:00,640
Which means Stones
gotta be dirty.

691
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:03,862
Looks like he hired Strickland to kill Canter.

692
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:12,340
Hey Tom.
I thought you were on leave?

693
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:13,738
Oh yeah... I am.

694
01:00:14,676 --> 01:00:16,750
Actually I was just suspended.

695
01:00:17,176 --> 01:00:19,584
Another investigation,
I'll just clear my desk out.

696
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,098
You should be home.

697
01:00:21,213 --> 01:00:22,731
Recuperating Ok?

698
01:00:22,955 --> 01:00:24,759
Not walking around here in the flesh...

699
01:00:25,194 --> 01:00:27,782
I was at home then I came
here to clean out my desk.

700
01:00:27,897 --> 01:00:30,415
And you know... before the
medication kicks in... Hopefully...

701
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:34,514
I can find a box...
And... Oh...

702
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,902
Victor Welsh wanted me to say hello.

703
01:00:38,988 --> 01:00:39,791
I'm sorry?

704
01:00:39,906 --> 01:00:42,180
Victor Welsh, VSI, the good looking kid?

705
01:00:42,295 --> 01:00:45,408
Very excited you coming over there, finally
moving into the private sector

706
01:00:45,524 --> 01:00:46,652
You must be excited.

707
01:00:47,095 --> 01:00:49,385
Why don't you come into my
office, you're not looking too sharp.

708
01:00:50,268 --> 01:00:51,522
Yeah Yeah... I got a minute.

709
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:55,688
It's a good move for you.
It's a really good group over there.

710
01:00:56,265 --> 01:00:57,130
Smart.
Talented.

711
01:00:57,806 --> 01:00:59,276
Great legal department.

712
01:01:00,225 --> 01:01:01,849
Great working environment.

713
01:01:03,066 --> 01:01:06,313
You gotta be happy with those
first year stock options huh?

714
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:08,178
What are you talkin' about?

715
01:01:09,118 --> 01:01:11,706
Myles Strickland, the guy I was chasing...

716
01:01:12,346 --> 01:01:14,302
The guy you hired to kill Canter.

717
01:01:14,418 --> 01:01:17,116
- Tom you got it all wrong.
- You gave him the weapon.

718
01:01:17,431 --> 01:01:18,702
VSI makes them.

719
01:01:18,915 --> 01:01:22,224
They give one to you, you give it to
Strickland so he can go out and kill Canter.

720
01:01:22,339 --> 01:01:24,514
The only problem is, he
killed his son by mistake.

721
01:01:24,785 --> 01:01:27,562
- Something is wrong with you.
- Why are you doing this?

722
01:01:28,608 --> 01:01:30,448
Money? Is that what it is?

723
01:01:31,097 --> 01:01:32,730
You need help.

724
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:29,454
This is Stone.  That son of a
bitch Greer disabled my unit!

725
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:30,383
Stop him!

726
01:02:33,828 --> 01:02:34,927
Go... Go!

727
01:02:46,476 --> 01:02:49,245
Jesus.  No wonder VSI
wants Canter dead.

728
01:02:49,659 --> 01:02:51,147
He's in bed with The Prophet.

729
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:53,563
He's funding the
Anti-Surrogacy Movement.

730
01:02:53,944 --> 01:02:55,153
He's given them names.

731
01:02:55,495 --> 01:02:58,913
Crazy bastard invents surragotes and
does everything he can to destroy them.

732
01:02:59,572 --> 01:03:02,818
It doesn't connect Stone to the murder.
We need to link him to the weapon.

733
01:03:03,194 --> 01:03:04,700
He needed codes to use it.

734
01:03:05,024 --> 01:03:06,900
I want you to look for access codes.

735
01:03:08,126 --> 01:03:10,714
You get the codes... You nail Stone.

736
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:22,101
Good job Agent Greer.
Thank you.

737
01:03:22,425 --> 01:03:24,851
This is Agent Peters.  I found Greer.

738
01:03:24,966 --> 01:03:27,304
He's been in an accident at
Market and Hanover.

739
01:05:21,936 --> 01:05:24,308
- FBI!!!
- Get out of the car!

740
01:05:25,561 --> 01:05:26,562
He's gone.

741
01:05:26,677 --> 01:05:28,004
Scanning for identity chip.

742
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:29,790
He doesn't have one, he's a meatbag!

743
01:05:29,906 --> 01:05:31,408
There's and exit in the back!

744
01:05:59,784 --> 01:06:01,479
Hey! Where you going?!
HEY!!!

745
01:06:05,418 --> 01:06:07,780
Bobby it's Greer.
I need a remote shutdown.

746
01:06:07,896 --> 01:06:09,890
Agent Peters has been hijacked.

747
01:06:10,005 --> 01:06:11,784
You gotta disconnect her.

748
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:14,255
Bobby?
Hello Bobby?

749
01:06:14,479 --> 01:06:15,742
Peters.

750
01:06:16,608 --> 01:06:17,879
Have you gone insane?

751
01:06:18,113 --> 01:06:21,116
Why don't you put the gun down? huh?
What are you trying to prove?

752
01:06:21,822 --> 01:06:24,365
She's grabbing into the entire 3rd network!

753
01:06:35,853 --> 01:06:38,269
Maggie get offline right away, as
soon as you get this message.

754
01:06:38,612 --> 01:06:40,632
Something is going to
happen to the surrogates.

755
01:06:41,828 --> 01:06:45,047
- She'll only speak to you sir.
- Why don't you just move in and take her down huh?

756
01:06:45,696 --> 01:06:46,904
She has a human hostage.

757
01:06:48,483 --> 01:06:49,917
Uh... the slob Saunders...

758
01:07:00,776 --> 01:07:01,596
Peters?

759
01:07:08,334 --> 01:07:10,272
Peters it's me Andy Stone.

760
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:12,485
That's far enough Stone.

761
01:07:15,804 --> 01:07:17,697
I know who hired you to kill me.

762
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:22,505
I hope my old partners
at VSI paid you well.

763
01:07:23,822 --> 01:07:28,231
Did you feel even a second of remorse
when you found out you murdered an innocent boy?

764
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:30,201
Canter?

765
01:07:31,743 --> 01:07:32,934
I don't believe it.

766
01:07:33,853 --> 01:07:37,679
Ok... How about you tell me something Doctor. Huh?

767
01:07:38,274 --> 01:07:40,295
What did you expect VSI to do?

768
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:43,469
Just stand by while you tore
down everything they built?

769
01:07:43,766 --> 01:07:45,840
You left us no choice
but to take you out.

770
01:07:46,618 --> 01:07:49,873
You created the technology, you changed
the world and now want to destroy it?

771
01:07:50,765 --> 01:07:51,505
So what?

772
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:53,858
So you can take us backwards?

773
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:56,654
So we can all live like Dreads?

774
01:08:00,236 --> 01:08:02,147
So we can live like
human beings.

775
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:05,474
Really Doctor?

776
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:08,594
You should learn
how to live with your regrets.

777
01:08:10,526 --> 01:08:11,797
Now give me the gun.

778
01:08:37,995 --> 01:08:39,573
That's for my son.

779
01:08:52,443 --> 01:08:53,940
I need to see your boss.

780
01:08:54,055 --> 01:08:55,725
I need to see Dr. Canter right away!

781
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:58,259
Oh good... Listen to me... I
gotta to see your boss.  Dr. Canter he...

782
01:09:10,178 --> 01:09:11,693
Device connected.

783
01:09:16,517 --> 01:09:18,338
Over here officers, this way.

784
01:09:37,995 --> 01:09:40,492
<i>Warning!  Commencing Upload.</i>

785
01:11:17,616 --> 01:11:18,734
Hello Tom.

786
01:11:22,392 --> 01:11:24,097
Nice to finally meet you.

787
01:11:24,826 --> 01:11:25,882
In the flesh.

788
01:11:32,702 --> 01:11:35,623
Now... Lie on the floor, face down.

789
01:11:38,036 --> 01:11:40,867
It's a little different when you have
to kill somebody with your own hands.

790
01:11:41,995 --> 01:11:44,871
You're going to have to squeeze the trigger.
You don't have a machine to do your dirty work.

791
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:47,909
Feel that?

792
01:11:49,024 --> 01:11:51,414
An accelerated pulse, the
heightened awareness...

793
01:11:51,864 --> 01:11:54,037
Savouring each breath
as if it were your last.

794
01:11:54,551 --> 01:11:55,750
That what you've been missing.

795
01:11:56,463 --> 01:11:57,851
That's what everbodys been missing.

796
01:11:58,186 --> 01:12:02,424
- So you kill millions of people?
- I changed the course of human
history when I invented surrogates.

797
01:12:03,812 --> 01:12:05,472
Now I'm going to change it back.

798
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:07,672
You can't change what's been done.

799
01:12:09,175 --> 01:12:10,934
You and I know that
better than most people.

800
01:12:12,053 --> 01:12:14,775
My son's death will not
have been in vain.

801
01:12:15,849 --> 01:12:17,769
Not if it heals mankind.

802
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:19,819
Heals mankind?

803
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,155
That what you want to do?
You want to kill everyone?

804
01:12:23,524 --> 01:12:26,166
- And that's going to heal mankind?
- They're already dead.

805
01:12:26,282 --> 01:12:28,465
They died the minute they
plugged into those machines.

806
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,767
This is not the solution.

807
01:12:29,883 --> 01:12:31,817
- That's the way it is.
- That's not the way it is!

808
01:12:31,913 --> 01:12:34,889
I had a vision.  I was going
to empower the powerless.

809
01:12:35,421 --> 01:12:38,027
To enable other like me to walk, to feel.

810
01:12:38,679 --> 01:12:42,611
- To live a normal life.

a murderer!  That is what you're doing!

811
01:12:42,726 --> 01:12:44,441
Surrogacy is a perversion.

812
01:12:44,766 --> 01:12:45,911
It's an addiction.

813
01:12:46,026 --> 01:12:48,995
And you have to kill the
addict to kill the addiction.

Bobby it's Greer.
Tom Greer.

823

Jesus... He's trying to kill everyone.

01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:52,441
Listen... That thing has just uploaded a virus into the system
that's going to kill anyone who's using a surrogate.

827
01:13:52,982 --> 01:13:54,137
It's already started.

828
01:13:54,334 --> 01:13:57,446
Bobby we need to
unplug everyone... Now!

829
01:13:58,283 --> 01:13:59,239
Think!

830
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,240
Uh.... Uh....

831
01:14:04,637 --> 01:14:07,093
I... Ok... Move over to
the terminal on the left!

832
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,420
Type in password:
RED253

833
01:14:09,889 --> 01:14:12,982
We can't unplug them
but maybe we can buffer the operators.

Oh God... Ok... we've got 10 seconds!

835
01:14:19,842 --> 01:14:21,186
Ok look... there are three passes.

836
01:14:21,555 --> 01:14:23,151
Type in Tango in the first.

839
01:14:26,343 --> 01:14:27,397
Hit Enter.

840
01:14:30,498 --> 01:14:32,998
HIT ENTER!!! What
happe... Ah.. Shit!

841
01:14:33,126 --> 01:14:35,516
SHIFT and Enter!
SHIFT and Enter!

Uh... You just saved about
billion lives there.

844
01:14:47,918 --> 01:14:50,411
Ok... Now we gotta keep
the surrogates from getting fried.

845
01:14:50,526 --> 01:14:52,566
Please go back to the first
terminal hit the Enter key.

846
01:14:53,215 --> 01:14:54,938
Hit the Enter key please!

847
01:14:56,056 --> 01:14:58,202
Good... Now press Yes.

848

849

Everyone's safe?

850
01:15:06,493 --> 01:15:07,776
- What?
- All the people?

851
01:15:07,891 --> 01:15:10,553
Yes... Yes... Of course yes.
All the operators are safe.

852
01:15:10,669 --> 01:15:13,800
But if you don't press abort, all the
surrogates are going to be destroyed.

853
01:15:16,938 --> 01:15:19,246
We don't have a lot
of time man... Hit Yes.

854
01:15:20,218 --> 01:15:22,305
Hi? Hello?  Hit Yes Greer!
