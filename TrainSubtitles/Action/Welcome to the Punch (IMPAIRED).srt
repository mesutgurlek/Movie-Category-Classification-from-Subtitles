he walks, all right?

at the container yard?

180

found nothing.

- You know why he was
thrown out of the army, Nathan?

182

the container yard is clean,

Last night,
Jacob Sternwood's son,

Ruan Sternwood,
was picked up at City Airport

suffering from a gunshot wound
to the stomach.

Before Ruan collapsed,
he made a call

to shoot to disable.

- It won't work.
- Why?

- Because it won't.
They need to hold off...

we haven't clocked on.

331
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,397
in the last 12 months.

332
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,735
- I'm not gonna get
into a debate about statistics.

333
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,399
No more relevant questions,

334
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,817
I'll bid you all
a good morning.

335
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,610
Thank you.

336
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,490
- Tough questions.

337
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,079
- I've heard worse.

338
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,039
- You ducked them like a pro.

339
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,909
- I'd take that
as a compliment...

340
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,251
if you weren't

341
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,245
the shadow home secretary's
campaign manager.

342
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,496
- We win this election,

343
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,918
and you'll get
the backing you need,

344
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,917
but for now, the questions
are gonna get tougher.

345
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,636
- Well, I'm sure you'll
spin it to your own agenda.

346
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:52,879
- The kid at the airport,

347
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,801
any truth
he's Jacob Sternwood's son?

348
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,265
- Where did you get that?

349
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,479
- Come on.

350
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,394
I ran your press for five years.

351
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,653
Could be useful.

352
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,773
- If it's handled well.

353
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:12,945
- Yeah.

354
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:23,201
- See you, Jane.
- See you.

355
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,794
- I've got a meeting
with the anti-gun lobby.

356
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,958
I've got two minutes.

357
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,956
- Max and I were
just discussing this Blake case,

358
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,878
and we thought
there may be a way in

359
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,046
through Ruan Sternwood.

360
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,885
Didn't we, Max?

361
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,219
- Uh, yeah.

362
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:37,557
Look, I don't know
about a Blake case, but...

363
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,015
if it was me,
and it's not me,

364
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,180
but if it was,

365
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,144
I'd put Ruan
in an open hospital, public,

366
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,729
man it 'round the clock,
dangle the hooks,

367
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,847
see if Sternwood bites.

368
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,893
That's it.

369
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,187
- You think
you two are up to this?

370
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,481
- Yeah, of course we are.

371
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,320
Aren't we?

372
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,313

- Max?

374
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,363
- He's still reeling
from last time.

375
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,156
- He was bang on
about Iceland, wasn't he?

376
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,325
- Look, um...

377

[chuckling]
I'm up to it, all right?

378
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:04,033
- You leave the Blake case
to Nathan,

379
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,955
and you stay out of his way,
do you understand?

380
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,000
I take your point.

381
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,999
You get the hospital,
but that's all.

382
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,375
- Thom, he's too close to it.

383
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,172
- Nathan, fuck off.
- [chuckles]

384

385
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,342
I'm just over it.

386
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,135
- You won't have a problem,
then, will you?

387
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,477
- Do you want me
to start on row two?

388
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,649
- No, no, just start
with the "A" class, son.

389
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,021
- Yes, boss.

390
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,160
- Jesus, Jake.

391
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,126
Why don't we
just let off some fireworks

392
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,164
while we're at it?

393
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,163
- I wouldn't be here
if I wasn't a thousand percent.

394
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,006
You know that.

395
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,127
- Come here.

396
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,014
Car was run-of-the-mill?

397
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,308
- It was perfect.

398
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,680
- Took a few knocks?

399
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,852
- I've had worse.

400
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,645
- So why did you
level the house?

401
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,268
- Became just another place
to hide.

402
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,565
I'd rather see it burn.

403
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,357

404
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:19,901
you're looking good.

405

- Great outdoors.
- Mm.

00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,326
- What's that?

407
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,789
- Karen says I carry it off.

408
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:26,999
- Oh, does she now?

409
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,367
Well, you look like
Kenny Rogers.

410
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,664
- Mm, I can shave,

411
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,754
and you'll still look like
a bag of smashed crabs.

- How is he?

414
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,514
- They've taken him
to St. Bart's.

415
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,426
<i>"</i> And?

416
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,396
- Apparently Ruan was involved
in some low-level stuff,

417
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,356
nothing serious.

418
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,569
But he started hanging out
with a kid called Otis Blake.

All mouth, no muscle.

420

Ruan raised the cash,

00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,317
using the family name
as leverage.

422
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,113
Otis did the deals.

423
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:08,199
And that's where
it gets complicated.

424
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,792
Four days ago,
Otis was found

floating in the Thames
with a bullet in his head.

at City Airport
suffering from a gunshot wound.

428

They know who he is, Jake.

429
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,797
They're going to make
an example of him

Punch 1-1-9.

That place is separated

Turk, Acorn,
and the Punch.

Says they pay you straight

Janey, you listening to me?

Your little project
came apart at the seams.

Max is an inch away

you're referring to, Thom.

I'm referring to.

I'm afraid.

because of this,

1174

Now, you stop this now,

You can't settle

Ah!

came here on the night
of the 7th

1205

with Bartnick and Crown.

1208
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,700
And one of the boys, Blake,
recognized Crown.

1209
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:52,497
He'd been arrested by him
a year ago.

And that compromised the deal.

Blake died,

Bartnick and Crown

looking for their money
and come across Sternwood,

and you suddenly get worried

that I'm gonna
piece things together.

1218

You, Thom,

1219
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:14,645

This can't just be about money.

Not for you.

- Policemen
weren't meant to die.

It was all gonna be simple.

Just one more gun scandal,

01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:43,969

would win the next election.

1230
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:50,760

1231
01:25:50,771 --> 01:25:52,307
He shipped in the guns,

1232

set up Otis and Ruan
as buyers.

1233
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:59,944
I provided some manpower,
turned a blind eye, you know.

1234
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:02,153
Then a new squad would come in,

1235
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,114
arrest the two boys
with the guns.

1236

Big public outcry,

1237

Jane handles the PR.

And Wiseman
takes the next election.

1240

Kincade'd get
the multimillion-pound contract

01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,127
to supply body armor,
