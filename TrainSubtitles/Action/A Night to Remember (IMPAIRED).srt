The pumps are keeping the water
down in this boiler room...

498

but the first five compartments
are flooding.

499
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,544
Well, what's the answer?

500
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,297
She's going to sink, Captain.

501
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,553
But she can't sink.

502
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,016
- She's unsinkable.
- She can't float.

503
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,350
Look.

504
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:17,396
She could float with any three of her
first five watertight compartments flooded.

505
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,606
She could even float
with four of them gone.

506
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,650
- But she can't float with all five full up.
- Yes, but -

507
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:24,737
These watertight bulkheads here
only go as high as E Deck.

508
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,573
The weight of water in the bow
is going to pull her down by the head.

509
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:30,284
So you're going to get the fifth watertight
compartment overflowing into the sixth...

510
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,912
the sixth into the seventh and so on
as she gets lower.

511
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,831
It's a mathematical certainty.

512
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,542
With that amount of underwater damage,
she can't stay afloat.

513

How long will she last?

Just trying to work that out now.

515
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,552
As far as I can see,
she made 14 feet of water...

516
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,679
in the first 10 minutes
after the collision.
