since Batman's defeat of the Mutant leader...

2
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:09,676
...at the west River drainage site.

3
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,637
WOMAN [ON TV]: The Mutants have adopted
Batman's methods as their own...

4
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:15,265
...leading to a series of brutal attacks
on criminals.

MAN 3 [ON TV]:
And in these strange times, people ask:

8
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,275
"Has Gotham traded one evil
for another?"

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,615
This is the face of the future.
Let Gotham's criminals beware.

10

Gotham City belongs to the Batman.

11
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:37,787
That statement came from the self-named
Sons of Batman...

12
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:41,249
...shortly after the body of a known
drug dealer was found murdered...

13
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:44,836
...in an East Side tenement.
One of several splinter groups that formed...

14
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:48,256
...from the Mutant gang after their leader
was defeated by the Batman.

15
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:49,466
They're using his name.

16
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:52,928
He could at least release a clear statement
against what they're doing.

17
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:56,556
The Batman doesn't exactly come out
with statements to the press.

18
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,309
No, he can't, because he's an outlaw.

19
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,728
How are the Sons of Batman
his responsibility?

20

-He didn't create them.
-He absolutely did.

21
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,734
They exist because
Batman broke up the larger gang.

22
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,236
And we're better off for it.

23

Would you prefer the Mutant leader
still be running things?

24
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,157
This Sons of Batman thing is exactly...

25
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:17,535
...why we didn't want these
costumed heroes around 1 0 years ago...

26
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,663

shouldn't have come back.
