And if you catch me ...

30
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,200
I will not care to fall one
besides me.

31
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200

I guess I did a good job.

39
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,700
They are a safe target.

40
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,500
I do not want to be
around you will catch me.

We are gathered here to
of a lead on the last road

72
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,800
on our sister, Letty.

73
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,900
Let us recall the words Psalm 23.

74
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,000
The identification of the facial
they have recognized Toretto.

75
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,600
In ten minutes or
after crossing the border.

76
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Not understand.

77
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
I thought that I would come.

78
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,100
I told you not to come.
We supravegheaþi if you find ...

79
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
There will.

80
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,300
Relax.

81
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,300
Look at you.

82
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,500
Letty was not left to destroy.

83
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,800
Although it is a fucking curse.

84
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,600
When he came back, was always here,

85
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,500
working at it day and night.

86
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,800
It was weird.

87
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Like the people that you come back.

88
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,800
I want to see the site of the accident.

89
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,300
Just what I was on the phone
Deputy director Lawson.

90
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,600
If in 72 hours
not doing any progress in Braga

91
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,800
will close.

92
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,500
I know that are new
but that is the reason ultimatum?

93
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,300
Because the past two years,

94
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,600
and the three agents infiltraþi
returned in plastic bags.

95
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,500
He walked over border more heroin
Escobar than ten years.

96
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,900
It is the largest national threat
and we have no even a picture with him.

97
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,900
We do not have fingerprints.
Not even a facial description.

98
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,600
How we David Park?

99
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,400
There is someone important
the organization's Braga?

100
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,200
I searched the name
all databases.

101
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,400
We have 500 results.

102
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,400
Park is unimportant.
It's a ragamuffin, in my opinion.

103
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,700
No Park, Braga and would provide
to that stuff.

104
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,500
Check the data traffic.
Changes illegal.

105
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,200
Illegal racing. Search
history. I find it.

106
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,200
It would be good to you a.

107
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,100
What do you think? We found the Chevrolet
Toretto's in his old garage.

108
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,900
I will arrest.

109
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,900
With your car you doubt me about this.

110
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,100
It's right in front.

111
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,700
You saw something there.

112
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,000
Were residual traces on the asphalt.

113
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,900
Traces that could be left only
of nitromethane.

114
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,000
There is one man
selling you something in the U.S..

115
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,800
None of what you do
will not bring back, Dom.

116
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,700
If you have Letty you so request,

117
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,600
no, I beg you
to and from everything behind.

118
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,200
Before too late.

119
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,800
Already too late.

120
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200

A green Ford Torino.

00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,200
Please let me go.

144
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,100
Good afternoon.

145
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,800
Tell me why did you bring me here, Brian.

146
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,000
I know that I did not arrested Dom.

147
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,900
I even did the reverse.

148
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,500
I do not want to be involved in this
stay away from him.

149
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,800
That's all you can say
after five years?

150
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,900
Suddenly I started to care
what happens with me.

151
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,900
What I did was gre º it.

152
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,900
I'm sorry. He was the most difficult
thing that had to do it.

153
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,100
And I'm sorry, Brian.

154
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,700
I'm so sorry that you came in
my home and you pretend to love me and you.

155
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,600
I'm very sorry
that you destroyed my family!

156
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,800
I'm sorry that you were so hard!

157
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,500
I minþit.

158
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,200
I minþit the Dom,
I minþit everyone.

159
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,400
I am the best.
That's why I recruited feds.

160
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,900
Maybe you minþi sure.

161
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,800
Maybe you're not the good kind
claiming that it is bad.

162
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,900
Maybe you're the bad guy
who claims that is not good.

163
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,500
You think of that?

164
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,100
Every day.

165
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,500
I always wondered ...

166
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,800
Why did you left my brother
to go that day?

167
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
I do not know.

168
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,200
Damn.

169
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,800
Hi.

170
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,800
We received results for David Park.
Analyze all possibilities.

171
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,900
What have you found?

172
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,300
Man of 46 years owner of a
Scion's 2006 fine for imprudenþã.

173
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,500

175
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,900
Two Mini Cooper,
Peugeot 607, a Toyota hybrid.

176
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,700
No.

177
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,500
A Senator in'98. One of the'95 Sebring.

178
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,200
One of the'98 Nissan 240.
Changes illegal.

179
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,700
That is, 240's with illegal modifications.

180
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,300
Would lead you to something.

181
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,200
A green Turin.
Nitromethane.

182
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,800
- Who was your car?
- I do not know. I'm just an intermediary.

183
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,100
I do not know! I swear!

184
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,200
A wait. I do not know anything, man.
I swear.

185
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,900
I'm just a man link.

186
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,700
I can not you just entered in races.
That's all we do.

187
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,700
What curse?

188
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,500
Get him, Dom.

189
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,800
God, this is all I know.

190
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,900
Raises it.

191
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,100
I will arrest O'Conner?

192
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,300
Damn!

193
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,400
Shut up!

194
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,800
Letty was and my friend.

195
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,900
You have been a friend to anybody.

196
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,200
You can discutaþi
about it later?

197
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Letty headed for Braga
when things went wrong.

198
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,900
Please.

199
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
I'll catch, Dom.

200
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,200
Let me do my job and raises him.

201
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,400
I will kill this Braga ...

202
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,800
and everyone will stand in my way.

203
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,800
I let go.

204
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,100
O'Conner!

205
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,200
If you'll ever release
one of my witnesses ...

206
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,800
- Enough!
- Take your hand!

207
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,400
It is enough.

208
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,300
- He finished O'Conner!
- I said that's enough!

209
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,500
Stasiak, go to cureþi.

210
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,100
What? He hit me first!

211
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,300
We are not in kindergarten!

212
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,900
So I go at once!
Bleeding on my floor!

213
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,900
O'Conner, you know the difference between
a police and a criminal?

214
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,400
- What is it?
- A decision and gre ita.

215
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,600
Control your exit irile, son.

216
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,700
Fun fun.

217
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,600
I eazã up.

218
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,000
You are good. Lieutenant
of Braga, Ramon Campos,

219
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,900
Tomorrow will race in a neighborhood
Korea to form a team.

220
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Have chosen and provide three
in previous races.

221
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,500
Our informant, Mr. David Park,
was courteous and he entered and us.

222
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,100
O'Conner ...

223
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,300
Your turn.

224
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,400
Let me guess.
As tigãtorul occupy the post.

225
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,400
These are cars
imports were confiscated.

226
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,400
- And to me.
- Choose one.

227
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,400
Nr. 2206.
A your car without equal.

228
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,100
Nr. 3148 and i. ..

229
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,800
2765.

230
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,400
Okay, you want?

231
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,100
All three.

232
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,000
It is a standard transmiþãtor.

233
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,800
ª efu 'wants you to where you always are.

234
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,000
Want to bet on it?

235
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Uiþi What are you, stupid?

236
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,900
I do not know. You tell me.

237
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,200
Drive it like you are Dwight.
But Dwight is already in the team.

238
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Must be quickly
like to work for Braga.

239
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,700
We have a problem?

240
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,500
No.

241
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,900
- You are one of the Park to offer?
- Yes.

242
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,300
Follow me.

243
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,700
See you later, you idiot.

244
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,900
And you.

245
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,700
Right on! Get banu!

246
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,200
I could þin to you all day.

247
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,000
With all sure why you are here.

248
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,400
I give good ...

249
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,000
are available on all roads.

250
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,100
Every corner of every street is
an idiot who organizes races.

251
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,900
Not what you look like Braga.

252
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,500
Braga wants and someone who would sell
bunicuþa like to be behind the steering wheel.

253
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,900
People who drive and your car
"ten seconds" does not line up right

254
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,900
but go to the limit and get
in places where nobody has ever passed.

255
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,800
You give real.

256
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,300
What do we carry?

257
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,100
How many money to give Braga,
should not you know.

258
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,200
You do that and give real.

259
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,400
A true driver's exact tie
Why is your car.

260
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,700
Listen, "and really oferule"

261
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,200
no one commits to attend
the race.

262
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,900
You are the head?

263
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,800
Talk to the head now?

264
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,300
It appears that you look like a head and?

265
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,600
My job is to find
and the best offer. Period.

266
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,200
At that race as a pan
receives the information.

267
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,000
The so-good?

268
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,200
The so-good?

269
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,900
Yeah, so okay.

270
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,900
No, it's not good.

271
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,100
Who will block the streets?

272
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,200
Nobody.
That 's the idea.

273
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,800

00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,200
Listen here: horses always power bat
me and inile import.

330
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,000
You know what I say? Always!

331
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,800
Girls, let's go
with "daddy" Dwight!

332
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,200
"Daddy" like Dwight
to remove your shoes.

333
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,400
Dwight likes his feet.
Down shoes.

334
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,700
What beauty.

335
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,900
Dwight likes him more
President picioru that.

336
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,400
What do? I did nothing?
Dwight has never done anything!

337
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,500
Staþi! Where plecaþi?

338
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,200
What I did?

339
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,700
You are arrested for distribution
of methamphetamine.

340
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,500
What? Dwight does not achieve any
of shit, frãþicã!

341
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,100
Dwight does now.

342
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,700
Not mine!

343
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,700
I know that will not accept any
as evidence, right?

344
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,400
Nor needed.

345
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,400
A Corona.

346
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,800
Too bad for Dwight. To be arrested
just when the team entered ...

347
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,200
How unfortunate.

348
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,700
I wish I could say
you are surprised to see you here.

349
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,000
What you stop me to say
that the police are you?

350
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,600
The same me that you stop me
to say why you're here.

351
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,100
- How you doing, boys?
- What are you doing?

352
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,800
- Okay. We distraþi?
- Yes.

353
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,900
Come to have fun and better.

354
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,100
What do you make your car?
Was hit soundly.

355
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,700
Will be ready.

356
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,000
I heard that you just exit it
in limbo.

357
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,700
Yes.

358
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,200
Can you know the one, Jim Garcia?

359
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:44,400
No. It's a great place.
Many names, many faces.

360
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,800
And you
you looking great world.

361
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,000
That may not be profitable
for business.

362
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,800
Depends on how things are concerned.

363
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,000
If you are caught
go to jail.

364
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,600
Years heavy.

365
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,000
I do not know how others are and provide

366
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,700
but I, you see police lights
in the mirror,

367
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,600
not stop me.

368
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,600
Teþi your knowledge?

369
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,300
See the sor'mea.

370
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,100
Understand.

371
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,300
- You are lucky.
- Why?

372
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
Still breathing.

373
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,600
For the ladies that I loved and
for the ladies that we have lost.

374
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,500
Cheers.

375
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,100
How's Braga?

376
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,800
It is of us.

377
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,900
She grew up on the streets.
It's faithful people.

378
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,500
Now big cocky.

379
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,400
And the head efilor.

380
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,700
I see all the guys ã º tia?

381
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,200
Whatever die for Braga.

382
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,700
Including you?

383
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,800
Especially me.

384
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,100
Enjoy the party.

385
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,700
Take drink, women.
Any want.

386
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,100
Braga is mine.

387
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,800
I will put organization on Earth.

388
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,500
Cheers.

389
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,300
Are you interested in something that your car?

390
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,700
I just admire bodywork.

391
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,300
You are one of those who
put before me and inile women?

392
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,300
I am one of those who appreciate
a body to move,

393
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,000
regardless of the brand and model.

394
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,300
Your car is yours?

395
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,200
It's your car's Fenix.

396
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,000
One can see
at the meeting.

397
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,200
It will open you up.

398
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,800
Now ...

399
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,500
I know what you like me and initially,

400
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,600
tell me how I like women.

401
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,700
Everything starts with the eyes.

402
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,200
Must have eyes to see that
lies beyond.

403
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,900
To see the good in someone.

404
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,000
20% angel 80% devil.

405
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,300
Realistic.

406
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Not to forbid the least
Vaseline under your fingernails.

407
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,300
You are not you a.

408
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,000
I know.

409
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,000
I have a small gift for you.

410
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,500
A dirty glass.
Just what I always wanted.

411
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,800
I took last night from the club.

412
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,900
Has two sets of fingerprints.
Processes them.

413
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,200
Some are of Campos.
But others could be his Braga.

414
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,400
You'll have to get over Interpol.

415
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,500
To contact individual agencies?
It could take weeks.

416
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,700
Well.

417
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,600
UNLOADING Coordinates

418
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,200
Yes.

419
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,300
You are the third breach of rules
road in less than three streets.

420
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,900
More easily, O'Conner.

421
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,400
Sure, Dad.

422
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,200
Signal
Latitude / longitude

423
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,800
It stopped.

424
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,600
I lost.

425
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,600
- It destroyed emiþãtorul.
- We are like that.

426
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,800
- He destroyed.
- We like you to know that yet.

427
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,400
Send the helicopter.

428

<i> I head north,

Damn!

434
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,900
Overdraw

435
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,900
This is not good. They have not said anything
I will tuck into a truck.

436
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,000
No kidding.

437
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,800
Where do we go?

438
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,400
No matter.

439
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,400
Just to enjoy the journey.

440
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,100
Welcome in Mexico, boys.

441
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:20,200
Border and helicopters are rooms
you will scan the heat signature.

442
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:24,400
But you can direcþiona satellite
to secure some points.

443
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,300
We can not tolerate
strecoare to an error,

444
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,800
so that I will have to follow
instructions without deviation.

445
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,100
Do you have any questions?

446
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,400
Fenix that I will be here.

447
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,400
We will meet there.

448
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,900
Well. Let us Sync.

449
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,600

00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,200
We detected a heat signature

I said that only poponarii
using nitromethane.

493
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,700
Have you looked under my hood?

494
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,300
Talk to you.

495
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,500
Got something to say?

496
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,200
70 in Plymouth.

497
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,800
A call Letty.

498
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,500
Hey!

499
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,600
Where is my money?

500
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,700
Somebody has destroyed your car.

501
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,000
I ruined your car.

502
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,000
I remember you face them?

503
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,400
Because I do not remember me.

504
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:10,400
Last time I saw her
burn.

505
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,900
Now what?

506
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,500
I would like to follow.

507
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,000
Get, Dom!

508
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,700
Get up!

509
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:12,400
Get the hell in your car!
Let's go!

510
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,600
Grab it Now!

511
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,000
What are you, trình?

512
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,400
Get in touch with agencies
in several countries.

513
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,800
Unfortunately most
must manually process the prints.

514
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,300
O'Conner you search on line five.

515
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,400
You should see this.

516
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,100
Thanks.

517
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:07,900
Says O'Conner.

518
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,100
<i> - Where are you?
- Got stuff. </ I>

519

521
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,900
Cameras for monitoring traffic
in the area

522
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,200
recorded images
with you and Toretto, together.

523
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,800
Listen, O'Conner.

524
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,800
Teaching and merchandise on Toretto.

525
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,400
I think the idea is to catch it
on Braga. Now we have a chance.

526
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,100
Brian, time has elapsed.

529
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,300
So you like 60 million dollars.

530
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,600
You need a doctor.

531
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,200
You can find a place
to hide ã º tia.

532
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,000
I know my part.

533
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,300
Garage and INI OF MA

534
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:16,300
502, drunk driver.
It raises your car 48 hours.

535
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,000
In the back, where find place.

536
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,000
You are sure?

537
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:31,200
Yes. Last
they will find

538
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,500
is their garage
ma and the initial high. Believe me.

539
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:44,800
When you have your car thrown into the air,
exploded and mine.

540
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,200
Yes?

541
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,100
Yes.

542
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,900
Now you are you owe to your car
"10 seconds".

543
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,200
Really?

544
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,100
Yes.

545
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,000
Now we're even.

546
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,700
That's your idea
to keep me away from him?

547
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:28,100
- I do not knew who to call.
- It's my brother. Sure.

548
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,200
Glonþul is not here.

549
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:49,700
I will clean the wound and I sew.
It will hurt.

550
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,900
I'm sure you'll do it gladly.

551
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:54,100
A little.

552
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,800
- Do you?
- Yes.

553
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,200
It's spicy. Take care.

554
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,500
A I love you.

555
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:07,800
Dom, how are you?

556
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,400
You should say your prayer.

557
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,000
Thank you, Lord,

558
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,400
bless you for
this table.

559
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,300
For food, family

560
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,100
and friendship.

561
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,500
Do you wonder why
I let go of Dom.

562
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,100
Maybe because at this time

563
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,200
I respect more than I respect
myself.

564
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,600
What I learned from that is Dom

565
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,500
nothing matters unless you
a code of honor.

566
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,300
And that code is yours, Brian?

567
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,700
Him now.

01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,400

Shit!
Hey, Dom ...

- When were you going to tell me?
- Dom ...

573
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,300
I use the agent as Letty.

574
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:21,000
- Let me explain you.
- When?

575
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:28,300
Ends, Dom!

576
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,500
- I understand.
- Do not understand?

577
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,700
Stop!

578
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,600
Dom, stop!
Please, stop it up!

579
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,900
He did it for you, Dom!

580
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,800
He did it for you.

581
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:04,300
Letty came to me to make you exempt
in exchange for his arrest Braga.

582
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,900
Just wanted to go home!

583
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,300
I'm sorry, Dom!
I'm sorry!

584
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,500
It would be good to have an explanation
very good.

585
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,800
You violated a direct order.

586
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,600
- Where is the merchandise?
- In security.

587
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,400
Safely.

588
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,400
We can use that stuff to show
Press

589
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,200
I am caught
several kilograms of heroin

590
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,300
Braga but will send a shipment
next week

591
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,800
and the one that will follow.

592
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:19,100
Let's use it to remove the Braga
cartel and his millions of dollars.

593
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:21,500
and suggest how to do this?

594
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,400
Through an exchange with Braga.

595
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,900
We are not that really.

596
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,900
Not and can allow
refuse to exchange.

597
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,400
Do you have any plan?

598
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,200
There is a price.

599
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,300
If it arrested Braga
is exempt on Toretto.

600
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,900
<i> - Yes.
- I'm Dom. </ I>

Put him on the phone Campos.

610
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,800
They are.

611
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,800
To do so, and provides Braga

Then it explains how he disappeared
cargo of 60 million dollars.

619
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,100
I know sure that this
is not profitable.

620
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,300
What?

621
01:13:55,300 --> 01:14:00,500

Yes.

- Yes.

638

- No, Dom.

640

You mean stuff

You see when you see Braga.
He was so understanding.

01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,100
Do not you worry.

to intervene.

656
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,500
We have confirmation. Main Suspect
wearing a gray suit.

657
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,900
To intervene.

658
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,600
Sir, no O'Conner gave us yet
signal.

659
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,600
I just received confirmation.
Do it!

660
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:25,800
Arestaþi main suspect
in the gray suit. Repeat.

661
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,800
<i> Arestaþi main suspect
in the gray suit. </ i>

662
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,600
I Think what you think
and me?

663
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,600
Not Braga.

664
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,400
Shit!

665
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,200
- Dispose of weapons!
- FBI!

666
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,200
Down!

667
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,000
Clear out of here!

668
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,000
Get outta here, Dom!

669
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,300
Get outta here.

670
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,900
Fuge!

671
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:19,700
Campos Braga is the!

672
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,500
Come on.

673
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,800
Approaching the main objective.

674
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,200
Suspect is secure.

675
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,900
Let's go.

676
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:43,200
Stand up.

677
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,500
He was always
right under your nose.

678
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,100
Now Braga fled.

679
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:50,100
Toretto is certainly now
over border.

680
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,600
Any idea how many of the problems, O'Conner?

681
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,200
I'm just busy.

682
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:57,400
There is the first offender
You have I left to escape.

683
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:01,500
Now you're suspended
and are subject to internal investigations.

684
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,000
What will happen to Braga?

685
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:08,800
Stop your concerns.

686
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,500
We know where Braga?

687
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,700
Satellite tracking has shown us
home that is in Tecato, Mexico.

688
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:27,200
Mexico is not in our jurisdicþia.

689
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,500
The truth is

690
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,900
that superiors will be so for ocupaþi
with conferinþele Press

691
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,200
captures about drugs

692
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,800
that can act
without-and give them out.

693
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,400
Park start
to do what is right.

694
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,300
Everyone is looking for you.

695
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,400
I'm right here.

696
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:28,100
I'm glad to see that you have adapted
and you got the injection electronics.

697
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:33,200
Informer know now
and to me the ini.

698
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,500
Come with you.

699
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:45,500
I 'm
to bring anybody back.

700
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,600
I know.

701
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,700
Click on that pedal.

702
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:10,000
How do I get to say goodbye
only from your brother?

703
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,800
Do not do it.

704
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:51,000
FRONTIER USA - MEXICO
5 Kilometers

705
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,900
I thought that you were coming.

706
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,000
You saved my life.

707
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,900
I want to return the service.

708
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,800
This will help
to get to Braga.

709
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:40,900
Dom.

710
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,900
It's suicide to go there.

711
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,800
I have no choice.

712
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,600
I think you loved her very much.

713
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:12,100
<i> Go with God. </ i>

714
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,800
This is the limit
My jurisdicþiei.

715
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:29,500
Yes. And here begins my.

716
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,400
<i> Welcome to the house of God. </ i>

717
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,900
<i> Do not worry you, father. </ i>

718
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,000
<i> Everything will be fine. </ i>

719
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:35,600
<i> great. </ i>

720
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,400
<i> For Holy Church. </ i>

721
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,600
<i> - Thanks.
- For less. </ I>

722
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,300
<i> Be blessed. </ i>

723
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:05,500
<i> In the name of the Father, the Son
and of the Holy Spirit. </ i>

724
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,500
<i> Amen. </ i>

725
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,900
No you're forgiven.

726
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,400
Arestaþi want to go?

727
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,100
<i> Right here </ i>

728
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,500
We have that option.

729
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,500
This will not escape with the money.

730
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:57,100
Frãþioare, two of us ...

731
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:01,400
Two of us are not so different.

732
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:04,300
No you're a hero.

733
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:17,000
You're right.

734
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:23,600
That's why you come back
abroad.

735
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,300
But Fenix is mine.

736
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,300
Sure.

737
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,300
Shit!

738
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:04,500
If we are lucky, we move
about three kilometers.

739
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,600
You know where to go?

740
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,900
Want to your loan
My GPS?

741
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:09,000
Where are your friends?
They intend to appear or what?

742
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,700
Premiums are fixed what you wanted.

743
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,000
Stop it up.
You stop your car.

744
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:54,400
Are behind.

745
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,500
Dom, take it to the tunnel!
To go through the tunnel!

746
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,800
Clear it away, Brian.

747
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:52,300
I know where are the tunnels?
You are sure?

748
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:53,800
I'm fine.

749
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:58,800
You might hurt.

750
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,000
Now you're in my world!

751
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:44,900
This is the end of the road.

752
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:46,600
Now what?

753
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:49,200
- End of the road.
- No.

754
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,200
Faster!

755
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,200
Get me outta here!

756
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:14,300
Gay.

757
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:32,800
Let me see.

758
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:36,800
Apply pressure there.

759
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:39,800
You'll be fine.

760
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:48,000
You must go.

761
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,100
No longer run.

762
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:00,500
You need to ask you something.

763
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:07,400
If I would like tigat race
do not you be stretched a trap, right?

764
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:11,900
You hit your head.

765
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,600
Do not make me laugh.

766
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,800
Ridicaþi sure.

767
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,800
Please take a seat.

768
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,500
Get up, sir Toretto.

769
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,700
I listened to the testimonies

770
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:50,800
and we took into account

771
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:54,500
clemenþã the call to Mr. O'Conner
on behalf of Mr. Toretto

772
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:59,000
because of its direct contribuþiei
in arrest

773
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,600
well-known drug dealer
Arturo Braga.

774
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:04,200
Nevertheless,

775
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,800
this court considers

776
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:12,800
that an act as not compensated
an entire lifetime and acts gre ite.

777
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:14,400
and therefore

778
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:19,500
are obliged to give sentinþa
maximum imposed by law.

779
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:23,900
Dominic Toretto,

780
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:28,800
you're sentenced to 25 years
prison

781
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:32,100

782
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:35,300

release conditioning.

783
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:37,600
