00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,981
I bet I can tell you about yourself.
You like to run barefoot on the beach.

153
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,275
Why are you so wired?

154
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,985
It's my birthday.
I haven't worked in two years.

155
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,570
That's it? Nothing more?

156
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,991
Yeah, it hurts me. Be the last one to
take your coat tonight. We'll talk.

157
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,493
Fine. All right.

158
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,911
Will you? Serious?

159
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,287
Give me a hug.
Okay.

160
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,456
Thank you for liking me.

161
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,167
I don't like it when people
come up after my plays and say,

162
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,628
"I really dug
your message, man."

163
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,423
Or, "I really dug
your play, man. I cried."

164
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,384
You know?

165
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,428
I like it when people
come up to me

166
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,930
the next day,

167
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,140
or a week later, and they say:

168
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,017
"I saw your play.

169
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,853
What happened?"

170
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:09,066
I've got it under control. I'll feed
my cats and be back in an hour.

171
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,486
I can't make it. My roommate
wants to work on the third act.

172
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,531
You can't make it?
He wants to work.

173
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,075
Give me your phone number.
I already did.

174
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,452
I thought you changed it.
Since an hour ago?

175
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,290
Oh, you didn't. Good point.
Let me talk to him. I'll call you.

176
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,169
Didn't anybody hear me?
No, guess not.

177
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,463
I've been trapped in that
bathroom for half an hour.

178
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,340
What kind of a party
is this?

179
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,051
God, you guys are having
a good time, huh?

180
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,553
Sorry.

181
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,557
I'll remember that if I ever
do a scene where I'm trapped.

182
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,144
That's nice, Michael.
Thanks.

183
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,105
Who is that?

184
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,233
Mallory. She's married to John.
Oh, yeah.

185
00:10:55,864 --> 00:11:00,200
I did a thing about suicides
of the American Indian.

186
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,537
And nobody cared.
Nobody showed.

187
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:08,250
And I think the American Indian
is as American

188
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,627
as John and Ethel Barrymore

189
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,130
and Donny and Marie Osmond.

190
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,341
I think it's really sad,

191
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,469
but I think that, nowadays,
when people dream

192
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,348
they don't even dream in their
own country anymore.

193
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,099
And that's sick.

194
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,935
MICHAEL: I had a good time. I
just didn't know half the people.

195
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,396
JEFF: It was late, and I wanted it
to be a surprise.

196
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,107
I invited 10 people.
They all invited 10 people.

197
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,902
You met 40 new people.
They all liked you.

198
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,154
I heard a lot of nice things
about you.

199
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,781
Thanks, Jeff.
Good night.

200

Happy birthday.
Thank you, Sam.

Great party.

Miss Right?

204
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,261
Good night, Michael.
It was a wonderful party.

205
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:06,016
My date left with someone else. I had fun.
Do you have any Seconal?

207

SANDY: I did have a good time.
I really did.

208
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,108
No, you didn't. Wait. I didn't
bring enough money for cab fare.

209
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,902
That's okay. It's cheaper to
get mugged. Let's walk.

210
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,446
The fares are really
insane now anyway.

211
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,825
Why didn't you have a good time?
I did have a good time.

212
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,910
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.

What?

214
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,749
What?
Nothing! I'm perfectly fine.

215
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,043
I just cry like this,
like a tic.

Tell me what's wrong,
or I'll kill you.

217

Nothing's wrong, Michael.
I'm really very up.

218
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,136
You're worried about your audition
tomorrow, aren't you? Why?

219
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,347
No. Because I'm not gonna get it.
Why not?

220
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:49,685
Because I'm completely wrong for it.

You don't have a man,
so you wanna act like one.

You're wrong, Dr. Brewster.
I'm proud of being a woman.

Wait a minute. This guy
treats you like dirt

225
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,781
because you're a woman
and he's a big doctor, right?

226
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,576
But don't take that.
Talk to him on his level.

You're doing a Southern accent?

[IN SOUTHERN ACCENT] You're wrong, Dr. Brewster.
I'm very proud of being a woman!

I can't do it as good as you.

Yes, you can! Just turn the tables on him.
Come on, now, will you?

[IN NORMAL VOICE]
I'm playing rage. I'm enraged.

You told me to turn the tables.
I'm playing rage.

236
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,768
This is rage?

237
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,812
I have a problem with anger.

238
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,191
Yeah, you certainly do. But there's 100
other actresses reading for this part

239
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,776
who don't have a problem with anger,
who aren't afraid of working.

Who aren't afraid to stick everything
out on the line and do it!

Don't get mad at me!
Stop being a doormat!

I'm not a doormat!
Act right now! Do it!

You're wrong, Dr. Brewster. I am...
Go on.

You're wrong, Dr. Brewster...
Do I have to hit you with a stick?

245
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,586
[IN SOUTHERN ACCENT] You're wrong.
I am very proud to be a woman.

And I'm proud of this hospital.

by your petty tyrannies,

Good day, Dr. Brewster.

Now, wait a minute.
You can't just go in there!

303
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,812
Michael, he's tied up
right now. I swear!

304
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,233
Hang on. Will you wait outside?
I'm talking to the Coast.

305
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,527
This is a coast too.
New York is a coast too.

306
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:09,903
Oh, boy.

307
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,738
Sy, are you...?

308
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,324
God... Look what you...
Margaret?

309
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,451
Get him back, will you?
I cut myself off.

310
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:17,869
What is it, Michael?

311
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:22,249
Terry Bishop's doing Iceman. You
promised to send me up for that part.

312
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,002
You told me I'd get a reading for that.
Aren't you my agent?

313
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,797
Stuart Pressman wants a name.
Terry Bishop is a name?

314
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,093
Michael Dorsey is a name. When you want to
send a steak back, Michael Dorsey is a name.

315
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,430
Wait, wait, wait!
You always do this to me.

316
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,349
It was a rotten thing to say.
Let me start again.

317
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,686
Terry Bishop is on a soap opera. Millions
of people watch him every day. He's known.

318
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:46,815
That qualifies him to ruin Iceman?
I can act circles around him.

319
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:51,570
I played that part in Minneapolis.
If Stuart wants a name, it's his affair.

320
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,447
People are in this business
to make money.

321
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,284
I'm in it to make money too.
Really?

322
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:01,037
The Harlem Theatre for the Blind? Strindberg in the Park?
The People's Workshop at Syracuse?

323
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,957
Wait a minute. I did nine plays
in eight months up at Syracuse.

324
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,711
I got great reviews from the critics.
Not that that's why I did it.

325
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,547
God forbid you should lose
your standing as a cult failure.

326
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,716
You think I'm a failure?

327
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,469
I will not get sucked
into this conversation.

328
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,678
I will not.

329
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,849
I sent you my roommate's play to read.
It had a great part in it for me.

330
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,394
Where do you come off sending
me a play for you to star in?

331
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,814
I'm not your mother. I don't
find plays for you to star in.

332
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,025
I field offers.
That's what I do.

333
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,194
Field offers? Who told you that?
The agent fairy?

334
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,529
I could have been terrific
in that part.

335
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,239
Nobody's gonna do that play.
Why?

336
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:40,911
Because it's a downer about a couple
that move back to Love Canal.

337
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,247
But that actually happened.
Nobody wants to watch people

338
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,751
living next to chemical waste!
They can see that in New Jersey.

339
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,005
I don't want to argue about it. I'll
raise $8000 and produce his play.

340
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,299
Send me up for anything.
I don't care.

341
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,761
I'll do dog commercials.
I'll do radio voiceovers.

342
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,888
I can't put you up for any of that.
Why not?

343
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,849
Because no one will hire you.

344
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,519
I bust my ass
to get a part right!

345
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,188
And you bust
everybody else's ass too!

346
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,149
Four weeks to put on a play, who
wants to argue about whether Tolstoy

347
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,444
can walk when he's dying
or walk when he's talking...?

348
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,239
That was two years ago,
and that guy's an idiot!

349
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,325
They can't all be idiots.
You argue with everybody!

350
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,079
You've got one of the worst
reputations in this town.

351
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,748
Nobody will hire you.

352
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,752
Are you saying that nobody
in New York will work with me?

353
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,257
Nobody in Hollywood will either.
I can't even get you a commercial.

354
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:39,719
You played a tomato for 30 seconds, and they went
over schedule because you wouldn't sit down.

355
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,555
Yes, it wasn't logical.

356
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,600
You were a tomato! A tomato
doesn't have logic. It can't move!

357
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,854
So if he can't move,
how's he gonna sit down?

358
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,232
I was a stand-up tomato.
A juicy, sexy, beefsteak tomato!

359
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,610
Nobody does vegetables like me!
I did vegetables off-Broadway!

360
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,821
I did the best tomato,
the best cucumber!

361
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:01,825
I did an endive salad that knocked
the critics on their ass!

362
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,744
Michael, I'm trying to
stay calm here.

363
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,622
You are a wonderful actor.

364
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,710
Thank you.
But you're too much trouble.

365
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,628
Get some therapy.

366
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:18,049
Okay, thanks. I'm gonna raise
$8000 to do Jeff's play.

367
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,720
Michael, you're not
gonna raise 25 cents.

368
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,556
No one will hire you.

369
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,433
Oh, yeah?

Dorothy Michaels?

372
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,341
[IN FEMININE VOICE] Yes?
George Fields is your agent?

373
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,343
Yes.
Okay, ladies.

374
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,929
Please bring your pages
and follow me.

375
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,852
I hate this line, "You have
every right to happiness."

376
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,688
This is Dorothy Michaels.
Our director, Ron Carlysle.

377
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:18,401
That's our producer, Rita Marshall. No résumé,
but George Fields is Dorothy's agent.

378
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:19,778
That's very impressive.

379
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,660
I'm afraid you're not right for this role.
Thanks for coming by.

380
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,162
Page 205, you want
camera one or two?

381
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,707
RON: Camera two, and tell Art.
Why am I not right?

382
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,502
I'm trying to make
a certain statement,

383
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,838
and I'm looking for
a specific physical type.

384
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:44,344
Mr. Carlysle, I'm a character actress.
I can play it any way you want.

385
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,638
I'm sure you're
a very good actress.

386
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,724
It's just that you're not
threatening enough.

387
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,059
DOROTHY:
Not threatening enough?

388
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,521
Take your hands off me or I'll knee your
balls through the roof of your mouth!

389
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,232
Is that enough of a threat?
It's a start.

390
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:01,486
DOROTHY: I think I know what you want.
You want a caricature of a woman.

391
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,031
To prove some idiotic point like
power makes a woman masculine,

392
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,908
or masculine women are ugly.

393
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:10,578
Well, shame on any woman
that lets you do that.

394
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,872
And that means you, dear,
Miss Marshall.

395
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,292
Shame on you,
you macho shithead.

396
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,420
Jesus!

397
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,842
What is idiotic about power
making a woman masculine?

398
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,846
Not that that was my point.

399
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,767
RITA: Miss Michaels,
just a minute.

400
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,771
Was that for real
or were you auditioning?

401
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,941
Which answer will get me
a reading, Miss Marshall?

402
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,944
Well, good for you. Come.

403
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,906
JO: Miss Michaels.
DOROTHY: Yes. Oh, thank you.

404
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,704
You really think she's worth
testing for this, huh?

405
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:57,417
She told me no director had ever
communicated a part to her so fast.

406
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,836
She said that?
Mm-hm.

407
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,463
I like her...

408
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,089
accent.

They'll never know the difference.

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,945
I'm a little nervous.

412
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:30,575
Just think of them as something
friendly, like a firing squad.

413

RON [ON SPEAKER]: Miss Michaels,
we're gonna do a camera test now.

414
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,125
Yes.
RON: Uh...

415
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:43,296
Let me have a right profile, camera 1.
Camera 3, give me a left profile.

416
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,757
What side?
Left side.

417
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,759
Which way for your left?

418
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,762
What?
Is that my left or your left?

419
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,765
Wait. What are you
talking about? My left.

420
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:55,391
Your left.

421
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,269
Miss Michaels,
nobody's talking to you.

422
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,438
I'm sorry. I thought
you wanted my profile.

423
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,483
Not so close on camera 3.
Camera 3, back off.

424
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,654
Make her look a little more attractive.
How far can you pull back?

425
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,823
How do you feel about Cleveland?
Knock it off.

right there, Herbie.

00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,495
Okay?
Yes.

you showed us a while ago.

you are, Emily.

a man, so you want to act like one."

Shut your mouth right now. When you
talk to me, talk professionally.

You don't get personal.
That is inappropriate behaviour.

about her bothers me. Does it bother you?

One more thing, Miss Michaels.
I forgot to give you these.

Yes.

Dorothy is me.

You are Michael.
You're acting Dorothy.

There's a woman in me.

1061

I'm experiencing these feelings.
Let's not get carried away.

Why can't you get me a special?
I can sing, do some monologues.

I feel I have something
to say to women.

Listen to me, Michael. You
have nothing to say to women.

That's not true!
I've plenty to say to women.

I've been an unemployed actor for
20 years, George! You know that.

I know what it's like to sit by
the phone waiting for it to ring!

1068

Then when I finally get a job,
I have no control!

Everybody else has
the power, and I got zip!

to other women like me...

You're a man!

Yes, I realise that, of course.
But I'm also an actress.

Michael, I don't think we
should argue about this.

I'm a potentially
great actress.

1076

I could do Medea, Ophelia.

1077

I could do Lady Macbeth, just like
they did in Shakespeare's day.

Why don't you get
the writers at the agency to...?

I could do a great Eleanor Roosevelt.
I got a terrific idea.

We could do the Eleanor
Roosevelt story!

01:33:21,972 --> 01:33:24,223
I can't let her
see me like this.

1660
01:33:24,474 --> 01:33:25,975
SANDY:
I hear you in there.

1661
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:29,937
Jeff, open the door.
It's me, Sandy. Open the door!

1662
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:31,730
Sandy, is that you?
SANDY: Yes! It's me!

1663
01:33:31,982 --> 01:33:35,150
What time is it?
I fell asleep, I guess.

1664
01:33:35,402 --> 01:33:38,070
I was having a nightmare
and you were in it.

1665
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:39,446
Mike's in the shower.

1666
01:33:39,656 --> 01:33:42,449
I'm in the shower! I got soap in my eyes!
I'll be right out.

1667
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:44,910
I'm not dressed. All my clothes
are in the other room.

1668
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:46,120
I was asleep. I was dreaming.

1669
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:49,290
Funny, you were in my dream. You had real big
teeth, but you were still a nice person.

1670
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:50,499
I had big what?

1671
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:53,168
I gotta get something on.
SANDY: Are you having a party?

1672
01:33:54,212 --> 01:33:56,255
I'm in the shower!
Turn on the water!

1673
01:33:56,506 --> 01:34:01,385
It's stuck! I got soap in my eyes,
and there's no water coming out!

1674
01:34:01,594 --> 01:34:03,679
I can't come out,
I got soap in my eyes!

1675
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:05,973
Jeff, open the door!

1676
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:11,145
I can hear you in there, you guys.
Open the door! Michael!

1677
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:12,813
Open this door.

1678
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:14,565
The door was open.

1679
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:16,650
You must think I'm really
stupid or something.

1680
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,736
No one would call
you stupid to your face.

1681
01:34:18,945 --> 01:34:20,654
Jeff, I've been out
there for 10 minutes.

1682
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:23,115
It sounded like you guys were having
a party in here or something.

1683
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:26,035
Well, Michael's
in the shower. You know.

1684
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:29,163
Hi, I was taking a shower.
He was in the shower.

1685
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:31,040
Good shower?
Good shower.

1686
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:33,542
Why haven't you returned
my phone calls, Michael?

1687
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:36,587
Since I'm awake, I think I'll
go do some writing. Excuse me.

1688
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:39,381
Wait, I'll be right back.
I got a present for you.

1689
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:40,883
Pigs!

1690
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:44,845
I'm glad you came over. I've been meaning
to give this to you. Here, it's for you.

1691
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:47,139
I suppose this means
nothing's wrong?

1692
01:34:47,307 --> 01:34:48,640
Nothing is. Is it?

1693
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:51,101
Well, Michael, I've called you
every night this week,

1694
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:52,311
you haven't returned my calls.
Really?

1695
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:54,480
You treat me like I'm a jerk.
What are you talking about?

1696
01:34:54,647 --> 01:34:56,899
I called, and you didn't call back!
No, it's...

1697
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:59,109
My new answering
machine is no good.

1698
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:01,070
I'm gonna answer
my own phone calls.

1699
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:06,283
I went to six stores for your favourite.
Chocolate-covered cherries?

1700
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:08,619
That's sweet.
Oh, and a card.

1701
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:11,497
Oh, yeah. No, no!
Don't, don't read it!

1702
01:35:11,748 --> 01:35:13,707
I was very angry
when I wrote that!

1703
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:16,794
"Thank you for the lovely
night in front of the fire.

1704
01:35:17,003 --> 01:35:18,670
Missing you, Les."

1705
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:24,009
This isn't for me.
This is another girl's candy.

1706
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:26,720
I wouldn't give you
another girl's candy, I swear.

1707
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:28,597
Then whose is it?
Mine.

1708
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:31,558
A guy named Les
is sending you candy?

1709
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:35,604
Yes. He's a friend of mine.
He can't eat candy. He's diabetic.

1710
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:39,441
Why is he thanking you for
a lovely night in front of the fire?

1711
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:42,069
My mind's a blank.

1712
01:35:43,363 --> 01:35:45,114
Michael...

1713
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:47,324
are you gay?

1714
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:50,411
In what sense?

1715
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:52,121
Just be honest with me.
Tell me the truth!

1716
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:54,081
For once in your life,
tell me the truth!

1717
01:35:54,332 --> 01:35:57,793
Because these stories
are very demeaning to me.

1718
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,587
No matter how bad the truth is,

1719
01:36:00,797 --> 01:36:03,715
it doesn't tear you apart
inside like dishonesty.

1720
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:07,803
At least it leaves you with some
self-respect and some dignity.

1721
01:36:08,638 --> 01:36:10,097
You're right.

1722
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:15,519
Okay. Okay.

1723
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:18,439
I'm not gonna lie
to you anymore.

1724
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:22,234
I'm gonna tell you
the truth. Sandy...

1725
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:25,362
I'm in love with
another woman.

1726
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:27,114
[SCREAMING]

1727
01:36:27,657 --> 01:36:28,991
What are you saying to me?!

1728
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:31,201
Sandy, please. Don't...
You liar! You liar!

1729
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:33,036
Sandy, we never said
we loved each other.

1730
01:36:33,246 --> 01:36:35,414
We went to bed one time.
I don't care.

1731
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:38,876
You're a dear friend. But let's not
pretend it was something else!

1732
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:41,753
We're gonna lose everything we had.
I never said, "I love you."

1733
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:44,339
I don't care about "I love you."
I read The Second Sex.

1734
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:47,968
I read The Cinderella Complex!
I'm responsible for my own orgasm!

1735
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:50,679
I don't care!
I just don't like to be lied to!

1736
01:36:50,889 --> 01:36:53,265
You asked me
to be straight with you.

1737
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:55,476
I didn't tell you how
I'd feel about it, did I?

1738
01:36:55,727 --> 01:36:58,645
Please, tell me, what can I do?
There's nothing you can do for me.

1739
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:01,148
I just have to feel like this until
I don't feel like this anymore,

1740
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:03,942
and you have to know you made
me feel this way! Schmuck!

1741
01:37:04,194 --> 01:37:05,861
Aren't we still friends?
No, we are not friends.

1742
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:09,114
I don't take this shit from friends,
only from lovers.

1743
01:37:09,365 --> 01:37:11,033
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What about the play?

1744
01:37:11,201 --> 01:37:12,242
Yes, what about the play?

1745
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:14,369
I think I should tell you
to shove your play.

1746
01:37:14,621 --> 01:37:17,706
But I won't, because
I never allow personal despair

1747
01:37:17,916 --> 01:37:20,000
to interfere with my
professional commitments.

1748
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:22,628
I am a professional actress!

1749
01:37:24,339 --> 01:37:27,966
So are these real
chocolate-covered cherries?

1750
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:30,177
I think so.

1751
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:33,972
See you at rehearsal.
Oh, Sandy...

1752
01:37:34,224 --> 01:37:36,016
Don't call me.

1753
01:37:37,477 --> 01:37:39,561
It's 2:00 in the morning.
Can't this wait?

1754
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:42,773
I don't care what time it is. Man, you've
got 10 days to get me off this show.

1755
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:45,025
It's impossible.
Then I'm getting a new agent, George.

1756
01:37:45,193 --> 01:37:46,777
I've had it with you.
You hurt my feelings.

1757
01:37:46,945 --> 01:37:48,028
What happened?
I'm sorry.

1758
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:51,365
I told her about Julie.
She thinks I'm gay.

1759
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:54,201
Julie thinks you're gay?
No, my friend Sandy.

1760
01:37:54,452 --> 01:37:55,702
Well, sleep with her.

1761
01:37:55,912 --> 01:37:57,913
I slept with her once,
she still thinks I'm gay.

1762
01:37:58,081 --> 01:37:59,331
Oh, that's not so good.

1763
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:02,751
I gotta get back to my life. You got
wall-to-wall lawyers in that office.

1764
01:38:03,002 --> 01:38:05,712
There must be some kind of way
to get me out of this show.

1765
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:06,922
We've been through this.

1766
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:09,424
Why can't I die? Why can't
Dorothy have an accident?

1767
01:38:09,676 --> 01:38:11,969
I mean, we can use our imaginations.
This isn't too tough.

1768
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:14,346
You want to kill somebody
and bring back the stiff,

1769
01:38:14,514 --> 01:38:16,014
that's okay, but she'd
better look exactly like you.

1770
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:20,227
Those people don't miss a trick.
These are nice, good people.

1771
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:24,439
Something is weird about you. Since when do you
care so much about what other people feel?

1772
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:25,983
I mean, if I didn't
love Julie before,

1773
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:28,860
you should have seen the look on her
face when she thought I was a lesbian.

1774
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:30,779
Lesbian? You just said "gay."

1775
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:33,574
Sandy thinks I'm gay.
Julie thinks I'm a lesbian.

1776
01:38:33,783 --> 01:38:35,117
I thought Dorothy was
supposed to be straight.

1777
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:36,493
Dorothy is straight.

1778
01:38:36,661 --> 01:38:39,871
Les, the sweetest, nicest man
in the world, asked me to marry him.

1779
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:41,999
A guy named Les
wants you to marry him?

1780
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:44,042
Yeah.
No, wants to marry Dorothy.

1781
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:46,503
Does he know she's a lesbian?
Dorothy's not a lesbian!

1782
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:48,880
I know that, but does he?
Know what?

1783
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:51,341
That... Well, I don't know.

1784
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:54,595
You know he gave me a ring?
He gave me a diamond ring.

1785
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:56,888
What did you say?
What do you mean? I said,

1786
01:38:57,098 --> 01:38:58,599
"I gotta think it over."

1787
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:02,352
I went in the ladies' room and almost
pissed in the sink. I'm in trouble, man!

1788
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:04,688
Thirteen's up.
Ready 14.

1789
01:39:04,897 --> 01:39:07,649
MAN:
Widen E. Pull three to 130.

1790
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:09,735
Cut it.
Stop tape.

1791
01:39:09,902 --> 01:39:13,196
MAN [ON SPEAKER]: We're gonna
take a short break, people.

1792
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:17,618
RITA: Hold it, hold it! Slight
change of plans, children.

1793
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:21,371
Our future ex-tape editor has just
spilled a bottle of celery tonic

1794
01:39:21,581 --> 01:39:24,249
all over the second reel
of the show airing today.

1795
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:27,002
So we have to redo
Emily's party scene, live.

1796
01:39:27,253 --> 01:39:29,087
JOHN: Live?
Quick, like bunnies.

1797
01:39:29,339 --> 01:39:31,214
You have 26 minutes.
Get into wardrobe.

1798
01:39:31,382 --> 01:39:32,758
But, Rita...
RITA: Don't worry, John,

1799
01:39:32,925 --> 01:39:34,384
you've only got a few lines.

1800
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:37,179
Well, I don't see
why we can't use the tape.

1801
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:39,848
Just because
it's a little sticky.

1802
01:39:46,856 --> 01:39:50,984
JULIE: Explain to them that the
hours have to be flexible.

1803
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:53,028
No...

1804

I know what you meant.

1960
01:51:18,756 --> 01:51:21,215
So you're pretty hot
after your unveiling.

1961
01:51:21,467 --> 01:51:22,884
What's your next triumph?

1962
01:51:23,135 --> 01:51:25,345
I'm gonna do this play
with a couple of friends...

1963
01:51:25,512 --> 01:51:28,514
Good. I gotta catch a cab, Michael.
Julie.

1964
01:51:28,974 --> 01:51:32,810
Can I call you sometime?

1965
01:51:37,524 --> 01:51:39,734
Look, I don't want
to hold you up.

1966
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:44,947
I just did it for the work.
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

1967
01:51:45,741 --> 01:51:47,241
Especially you.

1968
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:01,005
I miss Dorothy.

1969
01:52:03,801 --> 01:52:05,843
You don't have to.

1970
01:52:06,053 --> 01:52:07,178
She's right here.

1971
01:52:10,015 --> 01:52:11,557
And she misses you.

1972
01:52:16,021 --> 01:52:18,523
Look, you don't
know me from Adam.

1973
01:52:19,358 --> 01:52:23,569
But I was a better man
with you as a woman

1974
01:52:23,821 --> 01:52:26,489
than I ever was
with a woman as a man.

1975
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,366
You know what I mean?

1976
01:52:31,328 --> 01:52:35,331
I just gotta learn to do it
without the dress.

1977
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:41,337
At this point in our relationship,

1978
01:52:41,505 --> 01:52:44,507
there might be an advantage
to my wearing pants.

1979
01:52:49,263 --> 01:52:52,515
The hard part's over, you know?

1980
01:52:53,434 --> 01:52:55,643
We were already...

1981
01:52:56,311 --> 01:52:57,937
good friends.

1982
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:10,825
Will you loan me
that little yellow outfit?

1983
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:12,034
[♪♪♪]

1984
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:14,036
Which one?

1985
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:16,914
The Halston.
The Halston?

1986
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:19,125
Oh, no!

1987
01:53:19,293 --> 01:53:21,669
You'll ruin it.
Michael!

1988
01:53:21,837 --> 01:53:24,338
You'll spill wine all over it.
I will not.

1989
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:29,051
I'll loan it to you, but you gotta
give it back. It's my favourite.

1990
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:30,970
What are you gonna use it for?

1991
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:35,349
