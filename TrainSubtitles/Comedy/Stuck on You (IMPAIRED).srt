[Thinking]
Dear May, thanks for the latest photo.

150
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,352
- I look at it whenever I'm in need of a smile.
- [Debbie] Ride Mama home.!

151
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,691
- I'm sending a picture of me at work.
- [Walt Moaning]

152
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:01,597
- Hope you like it. Yours, Bob.
- [Debbie Chuckles]

153
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,929
[Debbie]
I'm starting to cramp.

154
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,965
- Hey.
- Hey.

155
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,263
- How's the letter coming?
- Uh, good.

156
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,535
- Yeah? What do you got?
- Uh, it's personal.

157
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,578
- I don't go nosin' into your business.
- [Debbie Chuckles]

158
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:19,208
- I'm sorry. Mind typing on your knees?
- Okay.

159
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,845
[Walt] Here we go.
There you go, sweetie. Turn around.

160
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,425
[Bob] Hey, shouldn't you
be studying your lines?

161
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,257
- [Walt] Not necessary. Locked and loaded.
- Then help me stack the wood.

162
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,332
I can't. I could pull something.
It's a performance day.

163
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,458
Nice.

164
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,436
Aren't you a little bit nervous?

165
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,669
Uh-uh. What's a four-letter word
for "snatch"?

166
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,847
- "Grab."
- Oh. [Chuckles]

167
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,917
Oopsie.

168
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,386
You're not even
a little bit nervous?

169
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,788
What's there
to be nervous about?

170
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,860
Well, you're up there,
you know, in a one-man show...

171
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,963
in front of all those people.

172
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,732
- I'd be crappin' myself.
- Yeah?

173
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,267
This is my ninth year.
I think I'm just kind of...

174
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,735
I feel like I'm over it,
you know?

175
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,671
- I guess that's how you have to be.
- Yeah.

176
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,278
You're doin' that blinkin' thing.

177
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,212
- You're not gonna have a panic attack on me?
- No. I'm cool.

178
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,283
- You all right? You all right?
- Yeah.

179
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,784
No, I'm not gonna...
I'm... I'm gonna...

180
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,252
- [Hyperventilating]
- Oh, God. Take it easy.

181
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,290
- Calm down. Calm down.
- I think I'm dying.

182
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,359
- I'm dying. Oh, God.
- No, you're not.

183
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,791
You're not dying.
You're having a panic attack.

184
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,897
- Get my bag.
- Come on. Take it easy. Take it easy.

185
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,966
Wait. I'm having an arrhythmia.

186
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,360
Here you go. Here you go.
Breathe into the bag.

187
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,494
Short breaths. Here we go.
Concentrate on the breathing.

188
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,665
- It's nine years in a row. I don't wanna go onstage.
- I know you don't.

189
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,777
- Why do I have to go onstage with you?
- Look at me.

190
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,711
- You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine.
- I need the bag.

191
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:59,478
Hey. You're gonna
have fun tonight. All right?

192
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,483
You're gonna have fun.

193
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:06,217
[Walt] Any normal person with
a normal sense of self-preservation...

194
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:10,852
would understand that
all an artist has is his life...

195
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:14,899
and what he observes
as he passes through his life.

196
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,232
And any serious writer
hanging out for years with the rich...

197
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:23,798
well, my God, you'd have to be deluded
to the point of derangement...

198
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:28,869
- not to realize that that writer was taking notes.!
- [Audience Chuckling]

199
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,978
My God, I even told them.

200
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,414
They all knew
I was writing this book.

201
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:41,925
What did they think I was there for?
The intellectual stimulation?

202
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,458
The wit?
The spiritual uplift?

203
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,658
I'm the one that brought
the intellect and the wit to the party.

204
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,962
[Audience Applauding]

205
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,728
- Okay, okay. He's coming. He's coming.
- [Giggling]

206

[Cheering]

207
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,568
Bravo!

208
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,806
- From the gang.
You were just wonderful. Wonderful.
- Thank you.

209
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,916
Yeah, Walt, you were great.

210
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,414
- Bob, you sucked.
- [Bob] Hey.

211
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,819
- Come on, Rocket. I'm not an actor.
- So what's up for next year?

212
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,518
Oh, uh, I don't know.

213
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,288
- Come on. Tell them the big idea.
- What is it?

214
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,863
He wants to do a musical version
of Bonnie and Clyde.

215

[Horn Blaring]

217
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,946
- You were awesome last night.
You know that, right?
- Thanks.

218
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,875
Is everything all right?
You seem a little...

219
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,986
Bob, you remember
when we were little...

220
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,222
and we first found out
we'd never be separated?

221
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,851
- Sure.
- We made a blood pact that day, remember?

222
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,360
Yeah. We promised we'd never
hold each other back, no matter what.

223
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,297
And we never have. Right off the bat,
we made a hell of a team, didn't we?

224
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,301
[Together]
Trick or treat!

225

[Pop]

226
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,482

00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,456
Man, those freaks are fast.

230
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:27,555
- [Kid] Hey, batter, batter.!
- Over here!

231
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,930
- [Singing Continues]
- Strike one!

232
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,899
- Let's do it! Come on! Get out there!
- [Bell Dings]

- Go get 'em!

Okay. Come on, Red.
You keep it clean now.

- [Crowd Cheering]

- [Boy] Hey, Bob, Walt.!
- Ralphie!

241
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,942
[Bob]
So what's your point?

242
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,649
Here, sit down.

243
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,950
Oh, geez.

244
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,190
I wanna be an actor.

245
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,226
Oh, yeah. Of course.

246
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,320
Look, I'm sorry, man.
I know I freaked out yesterday.

247
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,932
But I'll go onstage
with you again next year.

248
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:39,694
- You can even sing if you want.
I'd never stop you from doing that.
- No, no...

249
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:43,501
I mean, I wanna be a real actor.

250
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,837
- I wanna move to Hollywood.
- What?

251
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,946
Hey, I think I got
the chops for it.

252
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,578
- You saw those people last night.
They were moved.
- Come on.

253
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,707
- I got to 'em.
- Those were your friends.

254
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,714
What's that
supposed to mean?

255
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,849
Look, I just meant...

256
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,491
Look, man, we're from
Martha's Vineyard, okay?

257
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,893
You know, people here...

258
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,598
We're lifeguards
and fishermen.

259
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,827
We own restaurants.

260
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,165
We do not star in movies.

261
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,275
What about Meryl Streep?

262
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,810
Meryl Streep's not from the Vineyard.
She shot one movie here.

263
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:23,540
Right. But she stayed on a couple
extra weeks because she liked it, right?

264
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,809
What are you...
What is your point?

265
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,284
Well...

266
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,856
Okay, look,
I'm gonna put it to you this way.

267
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,418
Who were the last conjoined twins
who were nominated for an Oscar?

268
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:42,228
Whoa, whoa. I can't believe
I'm hearing this from you of all people.

269
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,201
Hey, isn't that what people
told us our whole lives?

270
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,864
That we couldn't do what normal people did.
Never stopped us before.

271
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,738
By the way, Hollywood just happens
to be in L.A., where May Fong lives.

272
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,811
- Huh!
- No, I'm not ready for that.

273
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,880
- She's crowding me as it is.
- Crowding you?

274
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,882
For God's sakes, you've been
her Internet pal for three years!

275
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,578
You haven't even met her!

276
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,655
Look, man, what about me?
I have a business here.

277
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,725
If things work out,
we can open a Quikee Burger in L.A.

278
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,828
- [Scoffs]
- Yeah. Or better yet...

279
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,522
maybe you can get
in the movie biz too.

280
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,690
What am I gonna do
in the movie business?

281
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,395
I don't know. You could be my...
my stunt double.

282
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,471
- Your stunt double?
- Yeah.

283
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,575
If I gotta do, like,
a dangerous stunt...

284
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,508
you could do it
so that I don't get hurt.

285
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,871
Huh? Come on.

286
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,207
I need to do this while I still can.
I'm getting old, Bob.

287
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,445
- Walt, you're 32.
- Going on 50.

288
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,579
I can't help it you got
most of our liver, okay?

289
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,182
I'm aging faster than you. I got bags
under my eyes. What about you?

290
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:45,593
Time's passing. You got nothing to show for it
except for a couple of pictures on the wall.

291
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:49,929
- Cripes, you haven't been laid in five years.
- Hey, how would you know?

292
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,735
I don't know, Walt.

293
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:59,241
You know, we got a great thing
going here.

294
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:02,142
- It might not be the same someplace else.
- It might be better!

295
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,442
Have you ever thought
about that? Huh?

Maybe you were right, Bob.

- Maybe this is a pipe dream.
- Yeah.

in the first 72 hours...

- you should probably just pack it in.

You know who's
gonna get the part now?

422
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,829
Those Schappell sisters from Oregon
who are stuck together at the forehead.

423
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,463
Why are they gonna get it?
They're country singers. They're not actors.

424
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,374

about anything.

All right. You're
a great brother, Bob.

00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,790

[Walt] Retirement home?
Are you sure we got the right address?

438
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,824
This is what he gave me.
Maybe we should try someone else.

439
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:46,419
April said this Morty guy's
a total sleaze.

440
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:50,295
But you said he was the only one
that would give us an appointment.

441
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:55,272
I wanna let you boys know
right up front that Morty O'Reilly...

442
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:58,467
only represents actors who are
truly committed to their craft.

443
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:02,273
Th-That's me, Mr. O'Reilly.
I am fully committed.

444
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:05,713
Committed enough to pay
my $200 up-front service fee?

Which, of course, is used
to defray the costs...

446
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:13,247
of registration fees, entitlement,
uh, paperwork and what have you.

447
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,656
- What are you doing?
- I'm showing him how committed I am.

448
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:20,925
You're showing him
how stupid you are. Here.

449
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:26,192
We'll give you $100, 'cause
you're only representing one of us.

450
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:30,570
Look, I'm gonna level with you. Siamese twins
ain't the easiest sell I've ever had.

451
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,166
- We're not Siamese. We're American.
- [Stammers]

452
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,269
I think what
my brother's saying is...

453
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,905
he'd prefer the term
"conjoined twins."

454
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,444
Okay, but I should also
let you know...

455
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,850
I'm not one of those
run-of-the-mill suits.

456
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:46,753
- I'm a full-service agent.
- Wow.

457
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,553
- Meaning?
- I get 25 percent.

458
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:53,391
- Well, what does he get in return?
- Seventy-five percent.

459
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:57,901
Well, I gotta tell you,
I think he seemed like a real player.

460
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,294
- I guess.
- [Chattering]

461
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:01,170
- I guess.
- [Chattering]

462
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:05,140
- Oh, my God. It's her.
- Who?

463
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,235
D-D-Don't...
Don't gawk.

464
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:11,542
Don't do that. She's famous.
She probably hates when people gawk.

465
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:15,483
[Soft Jazz]

466
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,714
- I like that part, but...
- [Chattering, Indistinct]

467
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,849
I think we gotta at least
go by and say hi.

468
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:25,856
A minute ago, we couldn't even look at her,
and now we're gonna go say hello?

469
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:29,365
Hey, Bob, relax.
It would be rude not to.

470
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,799
I'll do all the talking.

471
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,442
Excuse me.
Uh, Miss Streep?

472
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,806
Sorry to, uh,
interrupt your lunch.

473
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,381
I know this is completely inappropriate,
but... [Clears Throat]

474
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:49,650
my... my brother, Bob,
is, uh, a big fan of yours.

475
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:53,485
He just... He wanted
to come by and say hi.

476
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:55,616
Hi.

477
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,524
[Chuckles]
Hi, Bob.

478
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,191
We're from Oak Bluffs
on Martha's Vineyard.

479
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,359
Oh. I've been there.

480
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,494
Yeah, I know.
I know you have.

481
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,870
Actually, w-we... we're friends
with Timmy Sheehan.

482
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,637
- Who?
- Timmy Sheehan.

483
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:18,977
Remember, he waited on you one time
atJimmy C's restaurant?

484
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:23,414
- Remember, you autographed his menu for him?
- I did. Huh.

485
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,989
Yeah, I know,
because I read it, and it said, uh...

486
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,987
"To Timmy, a good waiter.
From Meryl Streep."

487
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,263
But the way you had signed the "P,"
it looked like an "L."

488
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,299
So, we used to call Timmy
all the time and say...

489
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,731
- "Hello. This is Meryl Streel calling."
- Streel.

490
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,860
But, you know,
we were just busting his nuts.

491
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,996
- True story.
- Yeah.

492
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:45,936
I think I
remember him. Uh...

493
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,508
I ordered some food,
and he brought it to me.

494
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,707
That would be him.
[Laughs]

495
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,875
He's a real character.

496
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:58,284
I can't believe you can just come to
a restaurant and nobody bugs ya.

497
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,723
[Chuckles]
Well...

498
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,294
- Huh?
- Let's go.

499
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:08,263
Well, let me go.
Nice meeting you.

500
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,596
- All right.
- [Conversation Resumes]

501
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,696
You know, by the way,
if you ever just wanna...

502
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,365
you know, get away,
have a little hang time...

503
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,342
we're staying over at
the Rising Star Apartments.

504
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,937
It is a pretty sweet setup.

505
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,682
We got a, uh,
barbecue pit there.

506
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:30,720
Gas. He does steaks and chops.
We got a pool, a little grassy knoll area.

507
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:33,380
And feel free to just
come by anytime.

508
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,685
Okay. I'll keep it in mind.

509
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,761
Great.
And bring the posse.

510
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,228
- [Streep] Okay.
- Bring the posse.

511
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:47,703
Hey, wait a minute.

512
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,000
l-I do remember you guys.

513
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,903
Homecoming '87.
Oh, my God, I was at that game!

514
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,239
[Together]
Break!

515
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,247
[Man On P.A.] With seconds on the clock,
it's fourth down with one yard to go.

516
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:01,875
Down! [Shouting]
Check! Check!

517
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,452
Check! Check!
Apache 36! Apache 36!

518
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,492
- Apache 36! Apache 36!
- [Players Shouting]

519
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:12,721
Okay, let's go!
Protect the ball!

520
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,492
Hut! Hike!

521
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,863
[Bob]
I'm wide open!

522
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:25,568
[Man On P.A.]
Touchdown, Vineyard.! Sharks win. 22-21.

523
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:30,579
- That was you!
- He actually is the one who
scored the winning touchdown.

524
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:34,276
- Well, you threw him a hell of a block.
- I've always told you that.

525
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,217
- You never give yourself enough credit.
- No. No.

526
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,391
As you can see,
I'm on crutches.

527
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,686
I was wounded
during the Vietnam War.

528
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:46,991
- Had a hunting accident while hiding in Canada.
- [Crowd Chuckling]

529
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,732
Tried that Viagra stuff the other day.

530
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:53,268
I didn't get an erection,
but I could walk for three hours.

531
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,601
- Did a benefit forJehovah Witnesses.
- [Men Singing]

532
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,903
All they wanted to hear
were knock-knock jokes.

533
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:06,643
And then the three of us just sat there
and talked for, like, an hour.

534
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,810
Meryl said... She asked me
to call her Meryl.

535
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,183
Very knowledgeable
on the film industry, by the way.

536
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,223
She says I should just
keep plugging away...

537
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,293
because I have twice the presence
of most actors she's met.

538
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,225
- Well, you do.
- Thanks.

539
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,595
Anyway, I told her my first love's
the theater back home...

540
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,634
and I felt like I had to come to Hollywood
to give it a crack.

541
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,261
But if I ever go back,
she said that I should give her a call.

542
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,306
She's dying for an excuse
to go back to the Vineyard.

543
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,408
Said she might even
star in a show with me.

544
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:32,839
- Really?
- Yeah.

545
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,911
- Walt, that's great!
- I know.

546
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,578
I love it when famous people turn out
not to be dick-wads.

547
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,309
That's her. That's the Streeper.
Perfectly normal.

548
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,386
As normal as you and me.

549
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:45,752
Oh. Stop. Anyway...
[Laughs]

550
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,585
Can I ask you
a personal question?

551
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,853
Nine inches.

552
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,589
I wasn't gonna ask that.
Nine inches?

553
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,326
Yeah, it's about
nine inches across.

554
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,799
No, actually,
what I was gonna ask you is...

555
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:02,771
if you guys ever considered,
you know, getting separated?

556
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:07,174
There's a lot of great plastic surgeons here.
A lot. Just look at these.

557
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,303
Well, the thing is...

558
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,644
our problem can't really be fixed
through a simple cosmetic surgery.

559
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,775
Bob and I share a liver.
He's got most of it.

560
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:19,220
So, there's no way that they can just,
like, nip and tuck so you both get some?

561
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,622
There is and there isn't.
The doctors at Mass General...

562
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,228
told us they could split us up
at no risk to Bob...

563
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,854
but there's a... a...
I don't know...

564
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,490
a 50-50 chance that
I wouldn't make it, so...

565
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,468
Oh, God. No, no, no.
I don't blame you for not doing it.

566
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:36,732
No, no, no. l-I wanted to do it.
Bob wouldn't allow it.

567
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,801
Oh, Bob.

568
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,841
Yeah.
He's really something.

[Chuckles]

570
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:52,282
Hey, are you even sure
you need a liver?

571
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,653
My friend had his appendix out,
and he's okay.

572
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,625
Okay.

573
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,731
I'm gonna take
a little sleepy now.

574
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,265
Good night.

Uh, no, he is
currently unavailable.

579
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:21,379
Uh, can I take a message?

580
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,646
- Oh, hey, Morty.
- I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:28,248
Um, you know, l... He is, uh,
waking up from his afternoon nap.

582
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,360
Hold on, please.

583
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,452
Hello.

584
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,623
You're kidding me. Wh...

585
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,735
Of course I'll be there.

586
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,331
Thank you, Mr. O'Reilly.
Thanks a lot.

587
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,473
I got a job.
[Chuckling]

588
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,546
What?

589
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,308
It's a feature-length motion picture.
It's called Pavlov's Dog.

590
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,385
- I start tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.
- [Laughing]

Do you hear that, Bob?
I'm a working actor!

592
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,020
- Great!
- [Laughs] Hey, it gets even better.

- Cool.
- [Altered Voice] I'm Pavlov.

746
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,287
- Hey, great makeup job, fellas.
- Thanks.

747
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,400
You too.

748
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:41,494
[Cher] Am I just talking
to hear my brains rattle?

749
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:44,334
I'm hot!
Do you hear me?

750
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,466
I am hot.
Look what it says here.

751
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,204
Okay. "Who's hot! Who's not!
Cher... red hot!"

752
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:55,874
Of course you're hot. You're hotter
than hot. You're on fire. No question.

753
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:59,853
Then answer me this.
Why am I doing this lame-ass TV show...

754
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,187
when I should be doing movies?

755
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,352
Because you signed a contract,
and the network's holding you to it.

756
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,192
Besides, Honey and the Beaze
isn't lame-ass.

757
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:12,634
You're playing a sassy lawyer who uses DNA
evidence to free wrongly-convicted minorities.

758
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,738
I mean, this is
cutting-edge stuff, Cher.

759
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:17,272
Oh, cut the crap, Howard.

760
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:21,174
Come on. This TV show makes Touched
by an Angel look like Trainspotting.

761
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:24,474
Can I remind you that before I
busted my nut to get you this gig...

762
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,674
you were, like, two weeks away
from being the corner square?

763
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,547
Center square.

764
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:32,211
You... You told me they
wanted me for center square.

765
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,551
[Stammering]
I did say that.

766
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:37,387
And... And, y-y-you see,
what happened is...

767
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:40,793
Alf was able to free up his schedule and,
you know... [Stammering]

768
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:44,230
The point is, if you didn't get lucky
with one lousy indie film...

769
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,928
you'd be begging
for this job right now.

770
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,432
Let me explain something
to you, okay?

771
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,499
First of all, that lousy little indie film
has grossed over 200 million dollars.

772
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,669
And secondly, I don't beg.

773
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,407
- And you know why I don't beg?
- Yeah?

774
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:01,882
Because I am
a fucking Oscar winner!

775
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,153
Uh, Cher.

776
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,414
Oh, hi.
Can I help you?

777
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:13,223
Sorry. We're looking for Stage 32,
and a little lost.

778
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:16,594
Thirty... There's no 30...
Let me have a look at that.

779
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,226
Here's your problem.
You're on the wrong lot.

780
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,771
You want Stage 32 at Half Mast Studios.
That's across the street.

781
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:27,775
Oh. So that would explain
why the guard was shooting at us.

782
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,871
Sorry to bother you.

783
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,950
What?

784
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:36,448
You're Cher.

785
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:42,222
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm just a big... I'm a big fan.

786
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:45,887
- He is.
- A big fan of your work. And I'm an actor too.

787
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,226
You guys are an actor?

788
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,631
N... No, no, no.
Not him. Not him. Just me.

789
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:53,736
- I'm a short-order cook back East.
- Yeah.

790
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:56,328
He does that.
And I'm out here right now...

791
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,566
just kind of going
through it, you know?

792
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,574
Living it right now.
It's going well too.

793
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,804
I got a couple of things going on.
Couple of irons in the fire.

794
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:06,677
I'm doing a gig across the street,
actually. I have an agent.

795
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:10,753
- I was wondering, could l-I
trouble you for an autograph?
- We're busy.

796
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:13,789
Right. Okay.

797
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:16,290
No... No, uh,
no heat on that.

798
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,690
All right. Well, just keep on
keepin' on.

799
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,786
Do what you do.

800
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:28,865
Well, that really puts things
into perspective, doesn't it?

801
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:31,338
[Annoying Voice] "That really puts th..."
[Gibberish]

802
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:35,172
Just get me out of
the stinkin' show!

803
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:39,179
So, this is your first job, huh?

804
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:43,377
Yes. Yes, it is. Actually,
I was wondering, is, uh...

805
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,715
there somebody around here
who might have a script?

806
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,915
- I haven't gone over my lines.
- [Chuckles]

807
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,453
They're not gonna be using a script.
They're gonna set up the scenes...

808
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,528
and then they're gonna let you all
just kind of wing it.

809
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:55,564
Oh. Improv.

810
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,657
This director
sounds very progressive.

811
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,735
[Chuckles]
I guess.

812
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,498
Who exactly is, uh, in this film?

813
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,631
Phil Rupp...

814
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,471
Lolly Gagger, uh,
Marianna Trench...

815
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,841
and Rebecca Romijn-Staymoist.

816
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,246
Phil Rupp.
Never heard of him.

817
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:18,185
You're kiddin'.
[Scoffs]

818
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:21,519
You never heard of Phil Rupp?
He's done over 500 films.

819
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:27,327
What exactly is
Pavlov's Dog about anyway?

820
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:32,497
Pavlov's Dog?
It isn't Pavlov's Dog.

821
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,570
- It's Pavlov's...
- Dong.

822
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,730
Scene 14, take one.

823
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:39,205
And action.

824
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,538
That's it, Phil.
You spring to life now.

825
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:43,612
- Good. Excellent. A little more.
- [Mattress Springs Squeaking]

826
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,545
Give me some more.
I want some more. Nice.

827
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:49,174
Okay, freeze.
Phil, you disappear now.

828
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:53,518
The freaks are gonna jump in, and we discover
the whole scene's a horrible nightmare.

829
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,394
Wait, look... Look, Cher.

830
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,760
If you break this contract,
they'll blackball the both of us.

831
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:03,799
You'll be finished in this town!

832
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:07,461
I don't give a goat's bobo
what it says on that thing.

833
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:12,833
I knew we shouldn't have
trusted that bastard Morty.

834
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,467
Well, maybe he didn't know
what the movie was about.

835
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:19,879
- Walt, he was the executive producer!
- Yeah.

836
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:24,215
Wait a minute. Doesn't that contract say I
have the right to choose my own costar?

837
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,687
Yeah. So what?

838
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:30,623
I just found my leading man... men.

839
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,628
What are you, friggin'nuts?
The Siamese twins?

840
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,631
- The network will never go for that.
- Exactly.

841
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,759
That way, they'll break
the contract and not me.

842
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,838
Don't... Don't...
Cher, please, don't do this.

843
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,497
Hey, guys. Guys?

844
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:49,669
I just want to say that l... I am really sorry
for being a bitch back there, but...

845
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:55,752
I was in the middle of being bawled out
by my creepy manager, and, um...

846
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:58,946
I guess I took it out
on the wrong people.

847
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:06,696
[Woman Singing]

848
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:09,187
[Woman Singing]

849
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,271
Hi, Bob.

850
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,204
[Singing Continues]

851
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:20,208
Hi, May.

852
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,245
Walt, what happened
to your foot?

853
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:26,611
Ah, I fell off my unicycle. Mm!

854
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,583
Ah! I sprained it pretty bad.

855
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,381
Uh, this is our friend, uh, April.

856
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,457
- Hi, May.
- Nice to meet you!

857
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,617
- God, you're a doll! Good going.
- Thanks.

858
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,729
So, we're all here.
What's the big news?

859
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:42,957
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Okay. Well...

860
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,700
as of tomorrow, my brother...

861
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,669
Walter L. Tenor, the thespian...

862
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,707
will be costarring
in his very own...

863
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:54,368
- major network television series!
- Oh, my God!

864
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:58,003
- That's incredible!
- It's called Honey and the Beaze.

865
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,715
Cher plays Honey,
and I have the role of Mack Beasley.

866
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:03,376
- Cher, Cher?
- One of the nicest women
you'd ever want to meet.

867
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,717
- As classy as they come.
- You must've been great in the audition.

868
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,382
- No, that was the thing. He didn't even have to.
- Nothing.

869
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:12,223
We bumped into Cher
on the studio lot...

870
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,330
and she invited us out for coffee.

871
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,898
Actually, yerba mates,
which is this very soothing tea drink.

872
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,634
- Six bucks, though.
- Yeah. Um, so anyway...

873
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,703
she starts telling us
all this very personal stuff...

874
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:24,500
like, she's been in this relationship
for the last three years...

875
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,836
with a very, very
high-profile actor...

876
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:30,504
- but they've totally managed
to keep it out of the press.
- Who?

877
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,945
Well, how would we know?
That's way too personal.

878
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,308
- You didn't ask her?
- No, no. I asked a lot...

879
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:38,216
and she said,
"That's way too personal."

880
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:42,725
We had it goin' on, bro!
And I was goin', "Ooh"!

[Men Laughing, Whooping]

Mikey! Whoo!
Good to see you, man.

883
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,989
Uh, to-to Bob...

884
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,703
- my best friend, who I'm just getting to know.
- Aw.

885
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,272
- Hello, May.
- Wes!

886
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:00,899
Oh, aren't you gonna, uh,
introduce me to your best friend?

887
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:03,338
Hi. Name's Bob Tenor.

888
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,448
Yeah. I know who you are.

889
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:08,643
You're, uh,
holdthepickle@hotmail.com.

890
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:12,279
I came up with that.
It's a double entendre.

891
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:15,550
I'm sorry, Bob. He hacked into my computer
at work and read my mail.

892
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,252
Yeah, well, don't be, uh,
pissed there, lover boy, okay?

893
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,829
Think I had a right
to check up on my girl.

894
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:22,898
I am not your girl!

895
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,967
Not my girlfriend, huh?

896
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:27,964
Then what was that all about
up on Mulholland when you sucked...

897
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:30,205
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

898
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,207
- I think we've heard enough, okay?
- Bob, let him finish.

899
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,507
When you sucked down a six-pack of beer
with me and said how much you cared for me.

900
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,843
What is that? What was that?
[Stammering]

901
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:41,747
I said I cared for you
as a coworker.

902
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:45,514
You have good business sense.
That's all.

903
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:50,582
Hey, Wes? Why don't you go drown
your sorrows somewhere else, okay?

904
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:55,664
I have a better idea. You and me...
Why don't we step outside?

905
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,858
Let's go. Come on. No, no, no.
You stay out of this.

906
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,367
This is between him and me.

907
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:03,598
Well, come on, there,
burger boy. Stand up.

908
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:06,471
What the hell's wrong with you two?
You can't fight fair?

909
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:11,513
Uh, uh, Bob... Do not fight him.
He's a black belt.

910
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,616
Bah!
[Scoffs]

911
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:17,676
Just like I thought.
You're a pussy.

912
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:35,638
Let's not let that... [Chinese]
ruin our night.

913
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,706
Come on. Let's dance.

914
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:40,207
Oh, no, no.
I'm a terrible dancer. l...

915
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:45,374
Walt, should you be dancing
on a sprained ankle?

916
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:49,474
Uh, gonna take more than a sprain
to keep me off this dance floor.

917
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,448
You were right
about your brother, Walt.

918
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,960
- He really doesn't give you much rope, does he?
- Huh?

919
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,289
She's not talking to you.

920
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:08,329
Hey, the weather's been
just unbelievable, isn't it?

921
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,803
It's just, like, incr-credible.

922
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,602
Um, 'cause I bet back home
that it's snowing still.

923
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:15,677
But snow is beautiful too.

924
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:19,873
Oh, no, no, no. Snow's my favorite.
I love snow. It's awesome.

925
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,479
Hey, and we don't have
earthquakes there either.

926

Oh, yeah.
Earthquakes scare me.

927
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,691
Oh, no, no. Me too.
They, like, freak me out. Yeah.

Hey, what's with all these maniacs who,
like, you know, live on the cliffs...

- I mean, these people are out of their minds!
- I couldn't do that.

931
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:41,470
My dream house
would have to have a yard.

932
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,596
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You definitely have to have a yard.

933
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:46,301
That way... That way
we could have dogs.

934
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,471
I meant, me and my wife
could have dogs.

Not you.

- See ya.

make out?

Oh, I'm scared.

Isn't that right, Howard?

She's trying to force us to pull the plug
on the show rather than to hire these guys.

No. Come on. Terry.
Hey, look at me.

I swear on my kids
it's got nothing to do with that.

Well, I got a message for Cher.

first thing Monday morning.

you looking for, Morty?

for Kitty Carlisle in What's My Line?

$1,250?

All right, Mr. Beasley.
You have five minutes.

Well, I appreciate
you taking the time.

Well, Mr. Beasley,
what are your qualifications?

Well, I'm a Rhodes scholar.
I have a PhD in bioanalysis.

990
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:45,436
I trained with the Navy SEALs
for, let's see, seven years.

Twice.

Hmm.

Fantastic. Let me tell you something...
You won't regret this.

It's just very, very important
that you stay on your mark.

Yeah, I'm just... I'm a little nervous.
I have some opening-day jitters.

01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,457
It's okay, kid. It's okay.
And I know you're gonna get it.

1006
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:32,584
- It's just, you have to stay out of frame. Okay?
- Okay. Gotcha.

1007
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:34,856
- Otherwise, the whole show won't work.
- Right.

01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:36,932
I don't want to tell you
how to handle this, Griffin...

1009
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:39,427
but back home, at the Oak Bluffs Playhouse,
we used to disguise him...

1010
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:41,833
- as different props in order to hide him.
- That's a great idea, Walt.

1011
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:45,304
- We'll just turn Bob into a bush.
- It might not be such a bad idea.

1012
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:48,639
It's a terrible idea! The network
has made it very clear...

1013
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,339
that the kid stays
out of the picture.

1014
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:56,885
This way, we don't have to explain why Beaze
is followed around by a juniper bush.

1015
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,784
Still gotta explain
the suck-y dialogue.

Hey, hey, hey...

1017
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:05,860
Uh, I'm sorry, Bob. Do you now have
a problem with the script?

1018
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,795
Uh, no, no. No. The script is awesome, sir.
It's just, the dialogue.

1019
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:11,957
I mean, look. Come on.
Every guy knows...

1020
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,759
that Archie Griffin's the only guy
who won the Heisman twice.

01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:18,568
- Archie who?

Hey, B-Bob, just cool it, okay?
He didn't mean it.

1023
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:24,342
The kid's right.
This script sucks.

1024
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:29,544
Griffin, come here. Look, why don't we
just give Bob a chance to write the script?

1025
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,620
[Scoffs]
Yeah, right.

1026
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:34,245
- Bob, have you ever written for television?
- No.

1027
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:38,293
You see how perfect this is? We can get rid
of the old hacks that wrote this crap...

1028
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,362
and we can get
some fresh blood.

1029
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:43,260
Are you... Are you... Are you
suggesting we bring in the bush...

1030
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,960
- to punch up the script?
- Yeah, that's exactly what I'm suggesting.

1031
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:48,601
Look, you got to go with me on this.
I got a good feeling about this guy.

Well, good to see you.
Thanks for coming.

- Let's get right to it.

How do you iron and fold
a pair of pants with four legs on it?

1186
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:47,766
- We take turns.
- He thinks we do.

1187
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,600
His memory's so bad,
I just always tell him it's his turn.

1188
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:53,300
- Really? Okay.
- My memory's not bad.

1189
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:56,468
Oh, come on. Sometimes I think he'd forget
his own brother if I wasn't sewed on.

[Laughing, Applauding]

1191
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:05,820
Now, I understand
you're quite an athlete. I'm told...

1192
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:08,821
that you were all-state hockey...
Oh, you were!

1193
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:12,291
Oh, okay. You were
an all-state hockey player.

1194
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:15,864
- Walt was honorable mention.
- [Leno] Okay. Okay.

- [Jesse Ventura] I gotta ask.
- Yes?

1197
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:23,933
What happens if you guys have to go
to the bathroom at the same time?

1198
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:27,231
[Bob] Well, it's actually harder
when only one of us has to go.

We're all big fans
of your work.

1210
01:13:56,298 --> 01:14:00,166
Oh, well, forward on a big thank-you
on to the management from the Beaze.

I'm really happy
for you, Walt.

1214

Hey. Look at the chickadee passing
through the room there.

1215

She thinks she's so hot.

- Mmm.
- Hey.

1217

Maybe you ought to go over there
and work some of your magic.

1218
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,424
Huh? Come on.
Just go over and say hi.

1219
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,586
Listen, you're a free bird now. You need
to start taking advantage of this. Come on.

1220
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:29,697
- No, I don't want to.
- Just go over. She's checking you out.

- Walt, seriously. I don't want to.
- Just go over there.

- Go over there and say hi to her.
- Stop it!

I said I don't want to.
What is the matter with you?

Yeah? About?

should do it.

Okay.

What are we
gonna do?

1232
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,403
The operation.

- What?
- Yeah. Yeah.

- You have a career!

not an actor.

We've been over this a million times.
Forget it.

1240

I'm perfectly happy with how I am.

you can learn to stand on your own two feet.

if that's how she feels...

then she can, you know...
The hell with her.

No, no, no.
This isn't how she feels, Bob.

1246

This is about how
you feel, remember?

1247
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,660
You're the one who couldn't
tell her the truth.

- Now, okay...
- L-L-Let me finish. Just think about this.

Imagine playing
a round of golf alone.

Slow-dancing with a woman
without me breathing down your neck.

Masturbating in private,
the way the good Lord intended.

What are you
talking about?

Come on. Last night
was like sleeping next to a paint shaker.

please, over here?

We'll do it your way.
But I'll tell you what...

1265
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:38,718
You better sit back,
take your foot off the brake...

Thank you, dear.

with the former champ,
Mike Tyson.

1338
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:04,171
- How does it feel?
- [As Tyson] My defense is impregnable.

1339
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:06,338
- My offense is "impetrable."

No, come on. It's not...
It was my fault.

You lied to me
for three years.

about this a lot.
