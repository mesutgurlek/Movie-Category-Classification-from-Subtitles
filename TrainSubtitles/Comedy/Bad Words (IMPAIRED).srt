<i>[Guy Narrating]
I'm not that good at a lot of stuff.</i>

2
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,971
<i>Especially thinking things through.</i>

3
00:01:13,897 --> 00:01:16,232
<i>And that's why this plan was so shitty.</i>

4
00:01:20,752 --> 00:01:22,657
<i>But my feelings were hurt...</i>

5
00:01:22,704 --> 00:01:25,438
<i>and I'm glad I at least did something about it.</i>

6
00:01:30,336 --> 00:01:33,069
<i>Making bad decisions is nothing new to me.</i>

7
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:37,074
<i>After all I live alone, at 40...</i>

8
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:39,326
<i>and I make my living proofreading...</i>

9
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,435
<i>product warranties.</i>

10
00:01:42,731 --> 00:01:44,464
<i>A few weeks ago I took a break from that however...</i>

11
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:46,379
<i>so I could do this whole thing.</i>

12
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:49,058
<i>And it's pretty ironic that what I did...</i>

13
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:51,251
<i>was exactly what a child would do.</i>

14
00:01:52,143 --> 00:01:55,193
<i>I threw a tantrum just to get attention.</i>

15
00:01:56,447 --> 00:01:57,947
<i>[Parent at bee]
Really proud.</i>

16
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,533
I mean I am...

17
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,922
and excited.

18
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:06,028
Meet the big man, right.

19
00:02:07,984 --> 00:02:09,084
But...

20
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:11,412
you know, proud either way, of course.

21
00:02:13,936 --> 00:02:15,336
Aren't they amazing?

22
00:02:15,374 --> 00:02:17,693
- Which ones yours? Mine's the...
- No thank you!

23
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:18,919
What's that?

24
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:20,643
This chat, I'm all set.

25
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:23,575
Just trying to get some food in my face
before I get stuck on that stage, okay?!

26
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:28,746
Oh, right, my bad. You must be our
host for today.

27
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,594
No, I'm not.

28
00:02:31,128 --> 00:02:32,627
I'm the winner!

29
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:38,002
Everyone, it's time for the 15th
annual regional spelling bee to begin.

30
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:40,692
Take your seats please all of our noble contestants.

31
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:44,235
Please take your seats up on the stage.

32
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:45,848
Right on schedule.

33
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,794
I love the way a hush comes
over the crowd before we start.

34
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:05,810
What are you doing up on the stage weirdo?!

35
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,000
Your chair called me for help.

36
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:15,232
Help me.

37
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:17,837
He's too heavy.

38
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:21,853
You didn't hear that?
I heard it.

39
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:25,193
I'm sorry sir.

40
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:28,595
Those seats are for competitors only.

41
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:31,120
Great! I'm in the right spot.

42
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,105
Mr. Trilby, I won't allow it. You're
not eligible in any fashion...

43
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:40,232
way, shape or manner.

44
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:43,998
Page 39 of the Golden Quill National
Spelling Bee rule book.

45
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,121
This is rule number 24, this is sub point B.

46
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:48,667
This is a quote...

47
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,877
Speller must not have passed beyond the 8th grade...

48
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,781
on or before February 1st, 2011.

49
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,500
That is a rule written by the governing institute...

50
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:59,094
and if you want you can continue to ogle my transcript...

51
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:00,614
just please don't wrinkle it any further...

52
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:01,899
but you can see that unfortunately...

53
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:06,208
I have not passed the 8th grade on or
before Feb. 1st. Not ever.

54
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:08,233
- That may be.
- Sir I can go on...

55
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:12,820
I can go on and on and on. There are
83 paragraphs, 581 lines of rules...

56
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:15,975
in the rulebook. But let me assure you I'm
compliant with every single one of them.

57
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:18,565
The spelling bee, isn't it for kids...

58
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:22,492
not adults that couldn't even graduate 8th grade!

59
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:25,615
Oh boy. Are we passed the rules and
into the insults now...

60
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:26,762
- is it insult time...
- Well I'm sorry.

61
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:30,377
...because your pot-holder vest is about
to take heavy fire. You ready for that?

62
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,720
You know what, enough!

63
00:04:31,752 --> 00:04:33,669
This is all just a moot point.

64
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,861
Every contestant must be sponsored by...

65
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:38,875
a nationally recognized news service.

66
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:39,673
The end!

67
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:41,560
I understand, but that doesn't end the conversation...

68
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:43,210
- Guess what.
- [Jenny] Hello.

69
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:44,454
- Hey.
- Perfect timing.

70
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:45,292
- What's going on here?
- Well...

71
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:46,847
- Who's this?
- This is my sponsor.

72
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:48,820
From a nationally recognized news service.

73
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,520
Jenny Widgeon, the Click and Scroll.

74
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:51,333
The What?!

75
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:52,790
What's that? Is it something on
the computer?

76
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:54,145
Yes we're an online paper.

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,505
Said differently, a nationally recognized news service.

78
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:58,834
They don't want to let me participate.

79
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:00,898
Go ahead, set it in motion.
I love your vest.

80
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:03,731
In about a half an hour, you're gonna be receiving...

81
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:05,285
a temporary restraining order and...

82
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:07,210
a preliminary injunction prohibiting...

83
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:08,764
the continuation of this competition...

84
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:10,302
until we clear this legal matter up!

85
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,418
- Plus, and this is a selfish one for me...
- Legal matter?!

86
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:14,777
- It's gonna make one hell of a story.
- How dare you try to hijack...

87
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:15,903
this spelling bee contest!

88
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,019
What did you call me?!

89
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:19,226
- Hijack!
- Hijack? I'm a hijacker now?

90
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:20,603
You're on the hook for defamation too.

91
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,390
My attorney's will be in touch with both of you...

92
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:24,013
Let's get out of here. But before we
go actually...

93
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,416
I'd like to watch the both of you address
those poor wonderful children...

94
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,991
and their very supportive parents, when you tell them...

95
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,101
that they have no shot at the national bee...

96
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:34,017
or an opportunity to meet the big man.

97
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,381
That I want to see. They're going to
be crestfallen.

98
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:37,085
I know of one father in particular
who's gonna have to find...

99
00:05:37,156 --> 00:05:38,656
a whole new way to empty out his ball bag.

100
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:40,963
Let's do it. Bullies and insulters
first. You lead the way.

101
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:41,986
Or should I go first?

102
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,778
The idiot hijacker. Should I lead?

103
00:05:43,825 --> 00:05:45,761
- You lead.
- No one called you an idiot.

104
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:47,317
While you decide I'm gonna bang out a couple of prayers.

105
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:48,372
Which way is Mecca?

106
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,709
Oleaginous.

107
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:51,037
Oleaginous?

108
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:52,396
Oleaginous!

109
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:53,909
Oleaginous?

110
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:55,505
Can I have the definition please?

111
00:05:55,783 --> 00:05:59,302
Having the nature or quality of oil...

112
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:00,441
or...

113
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:03,628
unctuous, prawning, smarmy.

114
00:06:06,226 --> 00:06:07,626
Oleaginous.

115
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,179
Oleaginous.

116
00:06:09,406 --> 00:06:11,623
Does it come from the Latin Oleo meaning olive?

117
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:13,553
It does.

118
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,380
Oleaginous.

119
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:16,927
Can I have the part of speech?

120
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,467
It's an adjective.

121
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,059
Am I right?

122
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:22,864
Yes.

123
00:06:22,903 --> 00:06:24,757
- Any other pronunciations?
- No!

124
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:28,505
Oleaginous.

125
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:32,606
O-L-E-A-G-I-N-O-U-S.

126
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:34,760
- That is correct!
- [Guy] You got it!

127
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:44,422
Hi.

128
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,593
Absquatulate.

129
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:52,420
A-B-S-Q-U-A-T-U-L-A-T-E

130
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,110
That's...

131
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:56,857
Correct!

132
00:06:57,743 --> 00:06:59,294
- Correct.
- Thank you.

133
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:02,030
Hey moms, let's break out the rubber
pillowcases tonight...

134
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:04,900
little pricks are gonna be counting tears, not sheep.

135
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:07,760
Who's next!

136
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:12,588
BAD WORDS

137
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:33,696
Not now, please.

138
00:08:33,963 --> 00:08:36,644
- Guy, I need some more.
- No!

139
00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:38,978
- Why at the age of 40...
- C'mon.

140
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:41,937
...have you decided to annoy educators,
parents and children...

141
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:44,252
by forcing your way into a kids spelling bee?

142
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:45,545
Can't you see I'm trying to sleep?!

143
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:47,686
Guy, I get at least one answer per tournament.

144
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:50,344
I have 3, very paltry answers...

145
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:51,510
it's time for my 4th.

146
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:53,279
[Guy]
Shh.

147
00:08:54,763 --> 00:08:56,263
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

148
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:58,420
While I'm gone I want you to ask yourself this...

149
00:08:58,482 --> 00:09:02,652
will, when all of this is over, a 5 answer article...

150
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:05,339
be equal compensation for 8 weeks...

151
00:09:05,386 --> 00:09:07,395
of covered hotel room accommodations...

152
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,177
qualifying tournament entry fees...

153
00:09:09,246 --> 00:09:11,505
rental car damage, not to mention emotional expense.

154
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,353
- Are you not gonna get up?!
- What? Go you got room.

155
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:15,719
- Jesus... Christ!
- If you'd given me the window...

156
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:17,354
- I wouldn't have to move.
- Yeah.

157
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,954
- Don't drag that thing across me!
- Excuse me.

158
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:25,210
It's full. You just told me it's full.
I don't want it on me.

159
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:36,421
Hi, I'm Chaitanya Chopra.

160
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:42,497
Was that English?

161
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:44,163
My name is Chaitanya.

162
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:45,588
Oh.

163
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:46,997
Congratulations.

164
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,239
- What's yours?
- No!

165
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:49,994
- What's your name?
- Spin it around!

166
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:52,363
- I'm going to Quill.
- Good for you.

167
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,025
My dad's up in first class.

168
00:09:54,072 --> 00:09:56,345
- Great.
- My dad says that economy class...

169
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,947
- builds character.
- Amazing.

170
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:00,039
I was in last years tournament.

171
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,184
I overheard you say you're going too.

172
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:04,042
You're the one who's competing, huh?

173
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:07,124
I read about you. What was the
winning word?

174
00:10:07,632 --> 00:10:08,756
I don't know.

175
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,905
What was the word you spelled to win your regional?

176
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:13,427
- To get here.
- I don't fucking remember!

177
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:14,944
Do you see my eyes closed?!

178
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:16,435
Mine was intelligentsia.

179
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:18,452
- Awesome.
- C'mon, try.

180
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:21,090
How could you forget. It's such a
special word.

181
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:33,764
It was auto-fellatio. Okay?

182
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:37,135
- I never heard of that word.
- Yeah.

183
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:38,781
What is the origin?

184
00:10:39,124 --> 00:10:40,624
Loneliness.

185
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:43,002
Well, that can't be right!

186
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:43,948
It is.

187
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:47,181
I know "auto" is of Greek origin meaning self, right?

188
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:52,225
Fellatio, fellatio, fellatio...

189
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:56,726
Is that derived from the Latin "fellare" meaning to suck?

190
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:58,562
Little man...

191
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,959
the woman I'm sitting next to...

192
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:01,522
knows her way around that subject real well...

193
00:11:01,565 --> 00:11:03,462
so why don't you ask her when she
gets back from dropping her deuce...

194
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,942
Meanwhile, if you don't point that curry hole...

195
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:08,433
that way and sit your fucking ass down in that seat...

196
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:10,635
I'm gonna tell the captain that your bags ticking.

197
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,760
Think you'll have a situation.

198
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:14,618
Goodnight.

199
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:40,308
Have a seat.

200
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:44,465
I'm Bernice Deagan...

201
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,188
director of the Golden Quill national spelling bee.

202
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:49,761
Struthious.

203
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:51,707
What'd she say?

204
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,745
S-T-R-U-T-H-I-O-U-S, struthious.

205
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:57,509
That was my winning word.

206
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:58,594
Oh.

207
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:00,900
1973, national champion.

208
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,900
Just thought you should know that in
case you didn't already.

209
00:12:03,978 --> 00:12:05,477
No I didn't.

210
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:07,509
Guy...

211
00:12:07,553 --> 00:12:08,695
I don't like you.

212
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:10,237
- [Jenny] Look.
- Quiet!

213
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:13,115
You know when I was a little girl...

214
00:12:13,454 --> 00:12:15,372
I was always picked last in PE.

215
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,108
I hated sports.

216
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:18,593
That's what probably, thankfully...

217
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:20,979
thrusted me into the welcoming bosom
of the spelling bee...

218
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:23,933
of which I am the director and have
been for over 20 years now.

219
00:12:24,152 --> 00:12:25,651
How did I accomplish that?

220
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:28,574
Elbow grease, yes, hard work, maybe...

221
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:30,673
integrity, oh you betcha.

222
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:34,254
But what I didn't do is use slimy
gimmicks as you have done.

223
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:36,712
Well you don't know me and you don't know why I'm here.

224
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,298
Would you like to tell me?

225
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,608
No thank you.

226
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,133
Do you know why he's here?

227
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,999
Oh, I have been trying for weeks.

228
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:45,533
Alright.

229
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:48,292
Well whatever issue it is you're here to work out...

230
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,749
perhaps painful 5th grade spelling bee or...

231
00:12:50,843 --> 00:12:51,473
It's not that.

232
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:52,826
I'm not asking!

233
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:55,296
I'm simply telling you you're in the wrong place.

234
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:57,110
No this is the spot.

235
00:12:57,188 --> 00:12:59,117
I'm gonna be out of your hair in 3 days though.

236
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:01,224
Perhaps sooner.

237
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:04,318
Because however smart you think you are
with this loophole your snaking through...

238
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:07,801
I'll bet you're not half as smart as
even our worst speller.

239
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:11,157
So B-R-A-V-O Mr. Trilby.

240
00:13:11,297 --> 00:13:12,353
You've made it.

241
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:14,236
That one I know. It's bravo.

242
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,766
All the way to your own hanging.

243
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:20,254
Your noose. Enjoy.

244
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:22,421
Can I ask you a question?

245
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:25,442
On your wife’s birthday, does she
get to wear the strap-on...

246
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:27,905
or do you hog that thing 365?

247
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:30,333
- That's yours right. You hold onto that.
- Good day!

248
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,768
- You don't share that with anybody.
- Good day!

249
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:36,606
- I thank you very much.
- Oh you can thank Dr. Bowman.

250
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:39,634
He was very disappointed he couldn't
personally place that...

251
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,934
around your throat.

252
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:44,189
Oh yeah. Is he busy doing
something more pleasurable...

253
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:45,363
with another guy's throat?

254
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,301
He is in the middle of a very
important media training session.

255
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,571
Surely you're aware that your little stunt has landed...

256
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,292
on the very first year we're televising this tournament!

257
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:54,986
Hang on...

258
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,839
That is a coincidence.

259
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:58,734
It doesn't bother you that...

260
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:01,694
a few million people will witness your embarrassment?

261

I'm not gonna be the one with the red
face. Trust me.

262
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:05,568
I'm not here for that.

263
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,990
Okay.

264
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:09,544
Okay.

265
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:12,161
See you later.

266
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,614
Oh, and I personally arranged your hotel accommodations.

267
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:18,032
- I bet they're not awesome.
- They're not!

268
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:20,977
Nice to meet you.

I had plenty of opportunities to stop what I was doing.</i>

270
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:29,698
<i>To make a good decision.</i>

271

<i>But that would have required the kind
of lessons I was never taught.</i>

272

Oh, um, there's an ice-cream social
at 5:30 p.m.

273
00:14:41,655 --> 00:14:42,436
You gonna be there?

274
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:43,780
Ok, no, well...

275
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,757
I could be pretty late to that.

276
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:46,972
Really late.

277
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:48,515
Super late!

- Thank you.

- Ma’am, I'll be right back with yours.
- Oh, bummer.

281
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,720

Hey, pool side too.

I'm Chaitanya, remember?

How about just your favorite word.

Subjugate.

Subjugate.

296
00:15:35,522 --> 00:15:36,922
What's yours?

297
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:38,810
Can we shut the fuck up?!

298
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,518
Well, that's four words. A
sentence really.

299
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:44,603
Pretend you're on a desert island...

300
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:46,160
and this gorilla comes out of the jungle...

301
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:47,780
he holds a gun to your head and says...

302
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,870
hoo hoo, tell me what your favorite word is.

303
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,117
- What would you say?
- Sweet fuck!

304
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:53,723
- We got a gorilla with a gun!
- Yeah a gorilla with a gun.

305
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:56,283
- And he's on a desert island?
- He's standing right there.

306
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:58,378
Here's what I'd do. I'd kick some sand
in the monkey's face...

307
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,649
I'd take his gun and hunt you down...

308
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:01,187
I'd stick it in your mouth and I'd tell you...

309

to stop trying to get all up in my kitchen, kid.

310
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,744
Again, that's a sentence. We can
finish that later.

Bye bye.

Unfortunately the hotel is completely sold out.

Actually make that two.

322
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,898
No mini-bar huh?

323
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,228
They put me in a storage closet.

324
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,024
I think the queen bee is sending you a message.

325
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,572
Whatever.

326
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:15,672
Oh, god.

327
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:18,688
A lot of parents around here.

328
00:17:20,663 --> 00:17:23,279
I'm bursting at the seems with parents.

329
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:26,279
[Bartender]
Here you go.

330
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,180
- Where are your parents?
- Jenny, c'mon.

331
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:30,744
I just wanna have a drink in peace.

332
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:33,544
Okay? And can I give you a little
journalistic advice?

333
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:35,690
Don't try so hard.

334
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:37,546
Get on the clock. We're here 3 days.

335
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,317
So just, you know...

336
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:41,293
Difficult to talk when you're being smothered.

337
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,846
You're an insolent child.

338
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:46,947
Hiding secrets from his mommy.

339
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:49,752
Really, you're not half the broad my mother was, so...

340
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:51,907
or is.

341
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,233
Seat opened up.

342
00:18:00,861 --> 00:18:04,178
I don't wanna talk and I don't wanna
drink I'm dead serious.

343
00:18:04,226 --> 00:18:06,302
Either you leave or I'm going to.

344
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,776
Or you could stay. I could buy you
yet another dinner.

345
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:11,539
No!

346
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:15,754
You could expand on those 3 measely
answers that you've given me this far.

347
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,398
You know too much already.

348
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:23,200
Hold on a second.

349
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:28,202
Wild turkey. Olive green. 32A.

350
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:33,923
Favorite drink, color and breast size,
are first date questions.

351
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,997
Or maybe you've never been on one of those?

352
00:18:37,114 --> 00:18:38,739
Can you leave me alone.

353
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:40,296
I've asked you like 4 or 5 times.

354
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,467
Why don't you tell me why you're so angry with the world.

355
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,319
Just, c'mon. Go ahead.

356
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:47,474
Screw! Please.

357
00:18:55,131 --> 00:18:57,090
- Screw?
- Screw!

358
00:18:58,191 --> 00:18:59,795
Fuck off. Did it.

359
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:03,772
Did you just tire of the words, "fuck off"?

360
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:07,799
Because I know you're not suggesting
I let you fuck me again.

361
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:12,844
First of all, you're welcome.

362
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,240
If you'd like me to consider another "event"...

363
00:19:17,763 --> 00:19:20,080
with you, you can ask me nicely.

364
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:26,021
And secondly, "fuck off" works just
great if that's what you prefer.

365
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,729
Does that sound better to you?

366
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:30,545
Or does "screw" sound pretty nice?

367
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,894
- Alright?
- We're doing great.

368
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,454
Okay.

369
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:52,809
Ooh, yeah.

370
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:54,372
- Do not look at me!
- Okay.

371
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,765
Do not look at me!

372
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,128
You're fucking staring at me, you know.

373
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,656
It's kinda creepy.

374
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:05,371
Don't look at me. DON'T LOOK AT ME!

375
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:07,620
Don't look at me. I'll have to start
again.

376
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:08,663
I understand.

377
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:10,419
- Faster!
- Okay.

378
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:12,192
We could be here all night.

379
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:13,739
Build it up.

380
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:15,628
Climbing a mountain.

381
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:19,371
One foot in front of the other.

382
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:24,198
Now we're jogging.

383
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:26,408
Now we're jogging.

384
00:20:26,954 --> 00:20:27,954
Who wants to run?

385
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,854
DON'T LOOK AT ME! Do you want me
to grab your balls?

386
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:32,056
Do you want me to stick my fingers in your asshole?

387
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,687
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

388
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:42,543
Don't look at me!

389
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,146
Ugh... Wow!

390
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:48,926
So, second time.

391
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:50,067
Shame on me.

392
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:52,568
Well I had a good time too. Thanks.

393
00:20:55,191 --> 00:20:56,592
So if I need fresh towels in the morning...

394
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:58,290
I should just, put my name on this?

395
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:01,852
Okay.

396
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:03,324
I'll see you tomorrow.

397
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:05,374
- So whatever, yeah.
- Bye.

398
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:32,130
You know, if you really had it all together...

399
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:33,988
you wouldn't be leaving your under...

400
00:21:34,262 --> 00:21:37,264
Sorry to bother you, but the lady
said you were still awake.

401
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:40,107
Would you mind helping me open this jar of pretzels?

402
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:42,571
Wow!

403
00:21:42,642 --> 00:21:44,359
Small room.

404
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:49,798
Can you help me? I haven't had
anything to eat all night.

405
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:51,292
I was studying my words all night...

406
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:52,635
but I missed room service hours...

407
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,695
and this jar is too hard for me to open.

408
00:22:03,203 --> 00:22:05,727
Are you opening it now, or have you taken it?

409
00:22:07,341 --> 00:22:08,540
Great.

410
00:22:08,598 --> 00:22:09,898
Thanks.

411
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:12,764
I was also wondering if you wanted to be my friend?

412
00:22:13,035 --> 00:22:14,636
Why would I want to be friends with a 9 year old?

413
00:22:14,972 --> 00:22:17,387
Ten but... ok it's cool.

414
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,000
I just thought it would be fun to study
together before tomorrow.

415
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:23,305
Drink soda pop from the mini-bar
and stuff.

416
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:26,595
- You have a mini-bar in there?
- I do.

417
00:22:28,344 --> 00:22:29,644
What about mom and dad?

418
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,311
My dad believes I should learn how to be my own man.

419
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,437
And that means...

420
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:35,785
staying in my own hotel room myself this weekend.

421
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:39,007
So you're just staying in a different
room down here, is it?

422
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:42,976
He's staying at a fancier hotel a few blocks away.

423
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:45,301
Nice guy.

424
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:46,525
It's kinda neat...

425
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:48,321
I get to jump on the bed as much as I want.

426
00:22:48,656 --> 00:22:51,608
But tonight, I messed up and missed room service.

427
00:22:52,926 --> 00:22:54,425
Have you named your binder?

428
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:56,483
Yes. Todd.

429
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:59,229
It has all the words I've ever memorized in them.

430
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:00,948
And their origins.

431
00:23:01,617 --> 00:23:03,736
Todd's my key to success.

432
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,896
I think I've spent more hours with
Todd than even my parents.

433
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:10,383
He's cool and he's smart and that's why I named him, Todd.

434
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,702
No, that makes sense.

435
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,611
Have you figured out your favorite word?

436
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:18,256
No I sure haven't.

437
00:23:19,162 --> 00:23:20,761
Is it the "F" word?

438
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:23,055
It's up there.

439
00:23:23,061 --> 00:23:24,360
Cause you say it a lot.

440
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:25,912
Everyone should.

441
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:28,841
Not me. My father says bad words.

442
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:30,887
What about your dad?

443
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,622
Never met him. But my mom said bad
words, a lot.

444
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,972
But you can say bad words. Who
gives a shit.

445
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:37,769
- I shouldn't.
- Why not?

446
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:40,508
You just say what you feel, you know.
That's a good effort. Why don't you try one.

447
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:43,265
I feel the opposite of bad wordy right now.

448
00:23:44,314 --> 00:23:46,736
Will you just say something bad you fucking Quaker.

449
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:51,343
- Mother fucker!?
- Great!

450
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:52,961
Perfect. That's a good one.

451
00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:55,570
And did your soul burst into
flames? No.

452
00:23:55,898 --> 00:23:56,998
Nope.

453
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,561
I'm okay.

454
00:23:59,142 --> 00:24:01,540
You're a little weirdo, you know that?

455
00:24:20,744 --> 00:24:22,244
Hey. Hey.

456
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,812
It's morning.

457
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:27,626
You passed out last night and I was scared to wake you.

458
00:24:27,864 --> 00:24:30,039
My dad will be here any minute. You
should go.

459
00:24:30,086 --> 00:24:31,586
Okay.

460
00:24:36,956 --> 00:24:39,065
You sleep good, dick head?

461
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:45,840
<i>[Jenny]
So what do you want to know about this morning?</i>

462
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:47,954
Nothing, unless it's really important.

463
00:24:47,997 --> 00:24:50,824
You're going to be seated next to Braden Aftergood.

464
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:52,391
He comes from bee royalty.

465
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:54,761
- Consider me warned.
- Good because he is awesome.

466
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:56,451
- Is he?
- Yeah.

467
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,727
Is he a great speller?

468
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,066
Did I leave my underpants in your room last night?

469
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:03,822
Oh as a matter of fact. You... I don't know.

470
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:05,848
Would you look for me, please?

471
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,264
- I only brought three pairs.
- I probably would have seen them, Jenny.

472
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:10,589
My room has no sink, shower or toilet.

473
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:13,049
Score one for Deagan.

474
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:15,585
And you can put me on the board too.

475
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:23,777
<i>[Guy narrating] Obviously if I could
figure out a way to be less stubborn...</i>

476
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:26,401
<i>the right way to fix things would be easier to see.</i>

477
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:28,404
Window! Window! Right there!

478
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:25,331
Pretty impressive.

479
00:26:25,337 --> 00:26:28,444
<i>[Announcer in background]
All right everybody... we've got 5 minutes.</i>

480
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:30,905
<i>[Usher]
Press. Pick and Scroll.</i>

481
00:26:31,242 --> 00:26:32,475
<i>[Bernice]
Yeah, I understand all that.</i>

482
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:34,966
Here's the randomized list for this round.

483
00:26:35,062 --> 00:26:38,452
Do me a favor and enunciate this year.

484
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,650
Well...

485
00:26:41,686 --> 00:26:43,261
look who's here.

486
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:45,115
Hook around your chair or something?

487
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:46,935
Good luck.

488
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:50,052
- [Usher] Hold on.
- [Guy] I'm a contestant.

489
00:26:51,684 --> 00:26:53,183
How you doing?

490
00:26:57,965 --> 00:26:59,265
Guy.

491
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:01,162
Oh, look who's here. Hi.

492
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:06,580
Where's me? Is this me?

493
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:08,726
Excuse me.

494
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:27,521
Welcome everyone to the 111th annual
Golden Quill national spelling bee.

495
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,840
I'm Pete Fowler coming to you live from
historic Figeroa Auditorium...

496
00:27:32,106 --> 00:27:34,459
here in sunny Los Angeles, California.

497
00:27:34,576 --> 00:27:37,466
This year marks the first year that the Golden Quill...

498
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:38,928
has been nationally televised...

499
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:42,288
and we can think of no better captain
for such a maiden voyage...

500
00:27:42,366 --> 00:27:45,393
then the president of the Quill Institute itself...

501
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:47,985
welcome to your tournament, Professor William Bowman...

502
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,531
or should I say, Dr. Bowman.

503
00:27:50,793 --> 00:27:52,905
That all depends on whether your sick or confused.

504
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:55,014
Otherwise, just Bill.

505
00:27:55,295 --> 00:27:57,496
Well, let's get started shall we?

506
00:27:57,615 --> 00:28:01,114
We have all 50 competitors in the room
and we're ready to begin.

507
00:28:01,187 --> 00:28:03,831
Our first competitor is Ling Quan.

508
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:07,772
Ling says that when she grows up she'd like
to be president of the United States...

509
00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:10,387
making it your 4th to reach the office, would it not?

510
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:12,862
It would. Best of luck, Ling.

511
00:28:14,565 --> 00:28:16,065
Dactylogram.

512
00:28:16,546 --> 00:28:18,252
Dactylogram?

513
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:20,236
Dactylogram.

514
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,166
Dactylogram?!

515
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:25,821
Dactylogram!

516
00:28:27,094 --> 00:28:28,973
Can I have the definition, please.

517
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:32,634
A fingerprint.

518
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:35,797
Dactylogram.

519
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:38,524
May I have the origin, please.

520
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:42,162
From the Greek combination "Dactylo".

521
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:43,903
I'm Guy.

522
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,342
And your Braden, right, Braden Aftergood?

523
00:28:48,238 --> 00:28:50,538
- I'm not supposed to talk to you.
<i>- [Ling in background] Dactylogram.</i>

524
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:52,601
Why not?

525
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:56,310
Because my dad says you're probably
just an unemployed bum...

526
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:58,955
trying to steal the prize money that I deserve.

527
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:00,777
And that you're a cheater.

528
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:02,637
<i>[Ling in background]
Dactylogram.</i>

529
00:29:03,852 --> 00:29:05,352
He said that, huh?

530
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:07,915
He did.

531
00:29:08,187 --> 00:29:09,967
<i>[Proctor]
It is a noun.</i>

532
00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:14,711
<i>[Ling]
Dactylogram</i>

533
00:29:14,772 --> 00:29:17,452
Can you tell your dad that I don't
blame him for being angry.

534
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:19,584
And then can you do me another favor?

535
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,500
Can you give these to your mother?

536
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:23,838
She left those in my room last night.

537
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,352
I would do it myself, but your
dad? His mood...

538
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:29,483
I don't want to kick the nest.

539
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:31,480
Do you know what I mean?

540
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:35,180
Oh buddy, good luck with that divorce, they get so nasty.

541
00:29:35,252 --> 00:29:37,055
What are you talking about?

542
00:29:37,128 --> 00:29:39,869
I'm talking about probably a very dysfunctional marriage.

543
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:41,792
I'm glad I was there for her.

544
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,830
It's just animal instinct too you know.

545
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:45,493
<i>[Ling in background]
D-A-</i>

546
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:48,297
She can't help it, she's just human, okay.

547
00:29:48,407 --> 00:29:50,531
And she was very sweet. I want you
to know that.

548
00:29:50,703 --> 00:29:52,649
<i>[Ling spelling in background]</i>

549
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,936
She held me afterward. Nice woman.

550
00:29:55,983 --> 00:29:58,138
- [Proctor] That is correct.
- Hey!

551
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,640
You're up dog.

552
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,590
<i>[Dr. Bowman] Brave, intelligent.
You've got my vote.</i>

553
00:30:06,193 --> 00:30:08,795
Next up we have probably one of this
years strongest competitors...

554
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:09,880
Braden Aftergood.

555
00:30:09,972 --> 00:30:12,745
Oh that reminds me. My very first
spelling bee...

556
00:30:12,815 --> 00:30:14,961
I had my lucky bottle cap in my back pocket.

557
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,485
Looks like he's got his good luck hanky there.

558
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:20,663
Noctivagant.

559
00:30:25,168 --> 00:30:27,970
I'm sorry, definition?

560
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:31,373
Going about in the night...

561
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:32,916
night wandering.

562
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:40,591
- Noctivagant.
- [Proctor] Noctivagant.

563
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,277
Can you use it in a sentence?

564
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:46,457
The noctivagant alley cat...

565
00:30:46,777 --> 00:30:50,120
kept the entire neighborhood up all night...

566
00:30:50,202 --> 00:30:54,904
by sitting on a fence, yowling out to her many suitors.

567
00:30:56,496 --> 00:30:58,173
Noctivagant.

568
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:06,827
Noctivagant.

569
00:31:07,593 --> 00:31:10,449
N-O-C

570
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:12,787
T-I-V-I

571
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,239
G-A-N-T

572
00:31:15,282 --> 00:31:16,781
Noctivagant.

573
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:20,976
God.

574
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:22,652
<i>- [Pete] Well we have our first elimination...</i>
- [Guy] I'll be right back.

575
00:31:22,695 --> 00:31:23,513
<i>...of the tournament.</i>

576
00:31:23,556 --> 00:31:25,470
<i>[Dr. Bowman]
Yes and surprisingly early too.</i>

577
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:29,817
<i>[Pete] Next up is Mr. Guy Trilby. He's
40 years old, lives in Columbus, Ohio...</i>

578
00:31:29,863 --> 00:31:32,972
<i>Now clearly Mr. Trilby has found a
loophole in the rules of entry...</i>

579
00:31:33,015 --> 00:31:34,515
and is exploiting it.

580
00:31:34,581 --> 00:31:37,055
Needless to say this is beyond unfortunate.

581
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,985
My staff and I are making all the efforts necessary to...

582
00:31:40,052 --> 00:31:43,634
rectify the problem for the tournaments
in the years that follow.

583
00:31:43,953 --> 00:31:47,311
With that addressed, on with the
competition and the man himself...

584
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:48,922
Guy Trilby.

585
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:50,742
My turn.

586
00:31:51,842 --> 00:31:53,342
Frabjous.

587
00:31:54,952 --> 00:31:56,151
F-R-A-B

588
00:31:56,154 --> 00:31:57,654
J-O-U-S

589
00:31:58,318 --> 00:31:59,818
That is correct.

590
00:32:05,742 --> 00:32:08,300
<i>- [Angry crowd murmuring]
- [Bernice] Thank you. That's enough!</i>

591
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:10,082
<i>[Bernice]
Listen! Listen!</i>

592
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:14,204
We are doing all we can to find a happy
resolution... to this situation.

593
00:32:14,246 --> 00:32:15,546
<i>[Angry parent]
Aren't you embarrassed?!</i>

594
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:17,564
This is gonna go down in history as the most...

595
00:32:17,658 --> 00:32:19,408
ridiculous spelling bee ever...

596
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,475
and it's gonna be on your head. He's
a grown man.

597
00:32:22,518 --> 00:32:25,351
Do you know how much money I've spent on goddamn coaches.

598
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:27,664
- I'm sure it's a lot.
- A ton!

599
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,950
He's a lunatic.

600
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,940
Yes he is.

601
00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:34,023
So fix it or I swear on my childs
life with God as my witness...

602
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:36,099
this will be the last year you're the
director of this bee!

603
00:32:36,142 --> 00:32:38,013
Alright. There's no need for threats.

604
00:32:38,107 --> 00:32:41,751
Now if we can all just leave my office I can assure you...

605
00:32:41,801 --> 00:32:44,207
this matter is in very capable hands.

606
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:47,855
Now keep in mind Mr. Trilby doesn't
have the discipline and practice...

607
00:32:47,906 --> 00:32:49,312
that all of your children have.

608
00:32:49,406 --> 00:32:52,034
He's made it through the first round.

609
00:32:52,081 --> 00:32:54,721
But Dr. Bowman and I are extremely
confidant...

610
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,788
he's not going to make it much farther.

611
00:32:56,861 --> 00:33:00,416
And I also swear on your children's lives...

612
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:02,262
if he makes it to the final round...

613
00:33:02,335 --> 00:33:05,074
I'll step down as the director of the bee, immediately.

614
00:33:05,258 --> 00:33:06,758
Good day!

615
00:33:13,975 --> 00:33:16,514
I'll jump in the shower as soon as this buzz kicks in.

616
00:33:21,814 --> 00:33:23,549
Let me ask you a question.

617
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:26,057
What's the grammatical significance...

618
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:29,153
of the sentence "why run from fire ants"?

619
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:34,546
Is this a test?

620
00:33:34,603 --> 00:33:36,713
No. This isn't a que... uh...

621
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,180
I was wondering what the grammatical
significance of that sentence was...

622
00:33:39,244 --> 00:33:41,412
- "why run from fire ants"
- Right.

623
00:33:41,455 --> 00:33:44,024
Well, every vowels in there.

624
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,008
Starting with the "u" going to the "a".

625
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:48,860
Right, it's backwards.

626
00:33:48,912 --> 00:33:50,412
I guess it's easy...

627
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:53,163
you know, for a sentence. I
mean I wish there was...

628
00:33:53,576 --> 00:33:56,185
one word that had all the vowels in it...

629
00:33:56,358 --> 00:33:58,190
but in alphabetical order.

630
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:01,536
- "Facetious".
- Son of a bitch!

631
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,982
- I got it?
- You're brilliant.

632
00:34:03,064 --> 00:34:04,781
- Give me another on.
- You're a genius.

633
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:06,989
These questions are from the test they give the geniuses.

634
00:34:07,032 --> 00:34:09,800
I got a hold of your school records, Guy Trilby.

635
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,097
Your 8th grade counselor made a note...

636
00:34:12,308 --> 00:34:14,663
on your file just before you dropped out saying...

637
00:34:14,749 --> 00:34:17,093
that you showed signs of being a genius.

638
00:34:17,381 --> 00:34:19,009
FedEx was waiting for me when I got here.

639
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:20,667
I told you I was good.

640
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,820
Mr. Leavenworth. What a dick he was.

641
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:26,368
Told me I was a useless loser and
then he makes secret notes saying...

642
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:28,251
that he thinks that I'm smart?!

643
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:31,810
Glad I stole his bike and shaved his cat.

644
00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:35,921
You just never had a chance to shine in this school.

645
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:38,657
- You just never had a chance to realize...
- Who didn't have a shitty upbringing.

646
00:34:38,682 --> 00:34:41,677
My dad wasn't around. I mean it goes
on and on and on.

647
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,304
Who skated through their adolescence?

648
00:34:43,441 --> 00:34:45,421
- Where was your father?
- I don't know.

649
00:34:47,238 --> 00:34:49,916
You got something there. Where's
your pen?

650
00:34:49,986 --> 00:34:52,436
Or maybe he was brilliant. Maybe
your mom was.

651
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:55,126
They say that sometimes a brilliance
and photographic memory...

652
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:56,189
which you have are inherited.

653
00:34:56,197 --> 00:34:58,595
Well it didn't come from mom. She hated
everything to do with education.

654
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,852
This one time when I was a kid...

655
00:34:59,895 --> 00:35:01,611
I tried to get into this local spelling
bee ironically enough...

656
00:35:01,657 --> 00:35:03,657
and she burnt my favorite dictionary.

657
00:35:03,953 --> 00:35:05,453
Is that why your here?

658
00:35:06,047 --> 00:35:08,556
A chance to do something you weren't
able to do while she was alive?

659
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:10,666
Are we in interview mode, now,
c'mon. I mean...

660
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:13,623
we can't just have a normal conversation
without turning it into an interview.

661
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,255
- I'm a reporter.
- That's a good point.

662
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:16,865
Can't you talk, too?

663
00:35:17,237 --> 00:35:19,623
You know, you have problems, Guy Trilby.

664
00:35:19,771 --> 00:35:22,713
You're a shrink too? A shrink
on top of being a reporter?

665
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:23,894
I don't know how you crammed it all in.

666
00:35:23,948 --> 00:35:25,458
You're the one with the problem.

667
00:35:25,525 --> 00:35:28,431
You have to be blindfolded to get off.
That's a problem.

668
00:35:28,611 --> 00:35:31,377
Oh! Well don't worry about that, Guy...

669
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,252
cause that's never gonna happen again.

670
00:35:33,307 --> 00:35:35,486
- Great.
- Oh, yeah great.

671
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:36,456
You promise?

672
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:40,159
I wouldn't let you near my vagina
again if you paid me a million dollars.

673
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:42,880
- [Jenny] Don't look at me!
- Yeah [mumbles]...

674
00:35:43,692 --> 00:35:46,445
Be quiet your voice eats hard-ons.

675
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:47,814
I'm sorry.

676
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:49,702
??

677
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:53,745
Okay... Ooh... Okay! You are sorry.

678
00:35:54,415 --> 00:35:55,515
Now that's generous.

679
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:57,036
- We're okay?
- Uh huh.

680
00:35:57,408 --> 00:36:01,089
Hang on. This might be easier? Hold on,
hold on, hold on...

681
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:03,429
- Now hold still.
- That's easier, right?

682
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:05,486
Don't look at me. I get it.

683
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:08,103
I get it. Don't look at me!

684
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:13,179
Hey did you get locked out?

685
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,464
I was wondering if you wanted to grab
some alimentation [food]...

686
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,800
for you hyperphagia [hunger].
I'm hungry.

687
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:20,899
Well I just got pretty hungry myself.

688
00:36:21,321 --> 00:36:22,985
Sure, let's go for it.

689
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:25,685
I can't believe you can't find any other
pre-masturbators to hang out with.

690
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,030
The place is crawling with them.

691
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,717
You know, you can actually study for
this spelling bee anywhere.

692
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:32,189
Thank you. Is that right?

693
00:36:33,249 --> 00:36:36,068
Try spelling "Rigatoni" without looking.

694
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,028
I don't want to. I don't need to study.
You need to study.

695
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,660
Because I'm gonna slaughter you like the sacred cow.

696
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:43,700
Not everything is about winning.

697
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,769
Closure's pretty nice too.

698
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:48,837
To me it's about fun.

699
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:51,786
Well, you probably deserve a little bit better than that.

700
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:53,356
Excuse me, uh...

701
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:55,955
I'm the mother of one of the competitors competing here.

702
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:57,182
Okay.

703
00:36:57,204 --> 00:37:00,641
What you're doing is an insult to every honest child...

704
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:03,118
that's worked so hard to be here.

705
00:37:03,898 --> 00:37:05,397
Including my son.

706
00:37:06,554 --> 00:37:09,569
I've worked very hard to get here too
madam and I'm well within the rules.

707
00:37:10,435 --> 00:37:12,663
You're an asshole. That's all.

708
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:15,014
- That's a child.
- It is.

709
00:37:15,304 --> 00:37:17,453
And I'm sure he's heard even worse from you.

710
00:37:17,552 --> 00:37:19,052
I don't speak like that in front of him.

711
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:21,643
- Oh is that right.
- Yes that's right!

712
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:24,216
So why don't you take your potty mouth...

713
00:37:24,396 --> 00:37:27,207
go locate your pre-teen cocksucker son...

714
00:37:27,253 --> 00:37:28,753
and stuff him back up that old...

715
00:37:28,759 --> 00:37:30,689
blown out sweat sock of a vagina and scoot off to...

716
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,577
whatever shit kicking town you came
from. Can you do that for me?

717
00:37:35,752 --> 00:37:37,690
Like an elephants trunk I'll bet.

718
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:41,998
Gray and distended.

719
00:37:43,446 --> 00:37:44,646
- Good night.
- Good day.

720
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:46,157
Thank you.

721
00:37:48,234 --> 00:37:49,634
Mothers!

722
00:37:49,732 --> 00:37:52,392
Let's get out of this restaurant. It's
a little depressing don't you think?

723
00:37:52,658 --> 00:37:54,851
My dad doesn't ever allow me to leave the hotel.

724
00:37:54,894 --> 00:37:57,665
Well daddies not here and he sounds
like he could be an asshole so...

725
00:37:57,727 --> 00:38:00,505
so let's not listen to him. Let's go
find you some real fun.

726
00:38:01,004 --> 00:38:02,504
Side door.

727
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:13,813
<i>[Jeremy]
Glad I was in town to catch your call.</i>

728
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:16,849
You look really, really good.

729
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:20,144
I appreciate that. I've been staying
away from sugar.

730
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:21,802
- Cold turkey.
- Wow.

731
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:24,429
Do you feel as good as you look?

732
00:40:25,196 --> 00:40:26,496
Are you happy?

733
00:40:26,528 --> 00:40:28,525
How's federal agent life treating you?

734
00:40:28,568 --> 00:40:31,264
You know it's not as fun as
it used to be. Yeah.

735
00:40:31,311 --> 00:40:35,045
I kind of miss you dinging around where you shouldn't be.

736
00:40:36,857 --> 00:40:39,965
- Yes. Yeah.
- There you go.

737
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:43,339
That's one background check on one Guy Trilby.

738
00:40:47,026 --> 00:40:48,994
Is this for a story or something?

739
00:40:51,928 --> 00:40:53,427
Something good?

740
00:40:57,142 --> 00:40:58,872
Did you do this background yourself?

741
00:40:58,993 --> 00:41:01,604
Of course I did. What kind of guy
repays a favor by delegating.

742
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,167
I did it.

743
00:41:04,476 --> 00:41:08,836
- This is incredible. Thank you, so much.
- Yeah.

744
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,873
So, is that it?

745
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:15,460
Oh yeah, this is... huge.

746
00:41:15,503 --> 00:41:18,599
That's a relief. This has been hanging
over my head for years and...

747
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,778
I'm the kind of guy, I like to keep a debt free lifestyle.

748
00:41:20,864 --> 00:41:23,004
- Oh well consider yourself...
- Yeah.

749
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:23,874
...free and clear.

750
00:41:23,945 --> 00:41:26,113
I just expected to have to do so much more you know?

751
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,030
It seems like it's not enough...

752
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:28,596
No!

753
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:30,626
Cause I mean, you saved my ass you know.

754
00:41:30,774 --> 00:41:31,974
- My career.
- Wow.

755
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:33,789
- I feel I'm getting off easy.
- No!

756
00:41:33,836 --> 00:41:36,834
You know. You did me a solid.

757
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:39,949
No we uh, we're square.

758
00:41:40,028 --> 00:41:42,618
- You don't want anything more in return?
- Uh uh.

759
00:41:43,316 --> 00:41:44,906
You don't want anything...

760
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:49,655
solid...

761
00:41:53,165 --> 00:41:54,664
in return.

762
00:41:59,465 --> 00:42:00,965
No.

763
00:42:03,043 --> 00:42:05,621
Are you familiar with the phrase "eatin and cheatin"

764
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:08,169
- Thanks so much.
- It's a popular phrase.

765
00:42:10,164 --> 00:42:12,182
<i>[Guy]
Aren't these guys incredible.</i>

766
00:42:12,882 --> 00:42:14,381
<i>Was I right about the cherry?</i>

767
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,980
Yeah but...

768
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,295
Well you might want to slow down a little bit Swami...

769
00:42:18,571 --> 00:42:21,133
Looks like you got into the wrong dudes ass, here.

770
00:42:21,176 --> 00:42:23,402
Hah! Funny!

771
00:42:25,482 --> 00:42:27,991
You look like you're a person who pooped your underwear...

772
00:42:28,038 --> 00:42:29,889
then you used it for a bank robber's mask.

773
00:42:29,936 --> 00:42:31,840
And you?

774
00:42:31,904 --> 00:42:34,465
And forgot to wash your face.

775
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:37,232
You shouldn't insult people. You're
no good at it.

776
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:41,202
This soda pop is so delicious.

777
00:42:41,257 --> 00:42:43,672
I'd just say "soda" otherwise you're gonna get raped.

778
00:42:45,506 --> 00:42:47,237
I like having you as a friend.

779
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,678
Although, I'm not your friend.

780
00:42:53,733 --> 00:42:55,645
You got friends. I'm like four times
your age.

781
00:42:55,747 --> 00:42:57,509
I really don't have any friends.

782
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,133
I thought being good in spelling would get me friends....

783
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:02,264
but kids just make fun of me more.

784
00:43:03,554 --> 00:43:05,755
Well who needs them. You've got
Todd, right?

785
00:43:06,186 --> 00:43:07,842
And you too maybe, huh?

786
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,990
No. Buddy I work alone.

787
00:43:11,711 --> 00:43:16,041
Always have. My mom always kept me
running around with her, avoiding rent.

788
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:19,411
I never gathered a bunch of friends.

789
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,677
And it's fine, it's good. You'll
be alright.

790
00:43:35,552 --> 00:43:36,597
What's that?

791
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:38,793
I borrowed it when you borrowed the lobster.

792
00:43:40,197 --> 00:43:41,697
Really.

793
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:43,698
Let me see it.

794
00:43:45,742 --> 00:43:48,522
Your fingers get a little sticky
when you get all boozed up.

795
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:54,005
Toys are fun to have when you can't play with other kids.

796
00:43:54,054 --> 00:43:55,662
That's true.

797
00:43:55,857 --> 00:43:58,684
What was your favorite toy when you were a kid?

798
00:44:00,356 --> 00:44:03,464
Well I did love a little toy car once.

799
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,507
Kind of like this. It was a shitty little
black and white police car.

800
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,151
Never left my pocket.

801
00:44:09,585 --> 00:44:13,541
I lost it one night I think. I must
have dropped it or something.

802
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:15,828
I never saw it again.

803
00:44:17,743 --> 00:44:22,242
Had a little Kojak light right on top.

804
00:44:22,403 --> 00:44:24,375
Right there. A little single bubble.

805
00:44:26,108 --> 00:44:27,875
Chasing down bad guys.

806
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:38,576
Alright so you're a little thief...

807
00:44:38,658 --> 00:44:40,473
and you don't have any friends.

808
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:44,155
Kind of like a real loser. Bet
you crack ass though right?

809
00:44:44,202 --> 00:44:45,702
You make up for it with the women?

810
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:48,064
No.

811
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:50,737
No girlfriend for you? You can't find
one little...

812
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:55,389
chicken Tika that gets your shrimp can going all up in?

813
00:44:55,657 --> 00:44:56,679
Nope.

814
00:44:56,722 --> 00:45:00,081
But when I do get one, it's going to
be a girl with nipples.

815
00:45:00,379 --> 00:45:03,210
Is that right, well lucky for you
they all have nipples, pal.

816
00:45:03,281 --> 00:45:05,139
Every girl does not have nipples.

817
00:45:05,264 --> 00:45:06,974
- They do.
- No they don't.

818
00:45:07,106 --> 00:45:09,629
- Buddy I promise you they do.
- No they don't.

819
00:45:09,826 --> 00:45:12,593
Alright. I don't know how I missed that.

820
00:45:13,073 --> 00:45:14,573
You look at their shirts.

821
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:17,101
On some you can see the little nipples.

822
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,998
Poking through their shirts.
On others, nothing.

823
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:23,628
Oh I see. I got it.

824
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:26,097
Buddy you're in bad shape.

825
00:45:26,534 --> 00:45:29,346
You know what. I'm gonna do
you a favor. C'mon.

826
00:45:30,342 --> 00:45:32,017
Let's go. You done here?

827
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,876
- Where we going?
- Just c'mon. Let's go.

828
00:45:34,919 --> 00:45:38,016
My dad had been around it's something
I wish he'd have done with me.

829
00:45:39,942 --> 00:45:41,563
I hope it's not a workout.

830
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:44,847
- I hope it's a sundae.
- Yeah, it's not.

831
00:45:44,913 --> 00:45:47,328
A desert would follow that chili dog really well.

832
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,880
No ice-cream pal.

833
00:45:55,755 --> 00:45:57,270
[Guy]
Hey!

834
00:45:59,293 --> 00:46:02,792
Slum-dog I want you to meet Marzipan.
Marzipan, slum-dog.

835
00:46:02,906 --> 00:46:03,806
Hi.

836
00:46:03,868 --> 00:46:05,215
You said he was sixteen.

837
00:46:05,258 --> 00:46:08,307
Yeah he is 16. He's got a hydro-thyroid
retention problem.

838
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:09,871
Remember Gary Coleman?

839
00:46:10,676 --> 00:46:12,729
God rest his sweet, funny soul.

840
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:14,183
Amen, okay, let's do this.

841
00:46:14,226 --> 00:46:16,891
Chaiwalla, all I can say is your welcome.

842
00:46:17,157 --> 00:46:18,556
For what?

843
00:46:18,602 --> 00:46:20,102
Hit it!

844
00:46:25,444 --> 00:46:35,344
3,4,5,6,7,8...

845
00:46:36,606 --> 00:46:38,452
- 9...
- Play it.

846
00:46:40,033 --> 00:46:41,533
10.

847
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:45,164
Nice? Huh?

848
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:49,877
Good right?

849
00:46:50,689 --> 00:46:52,291
- No tip.
- No tip.

850
00:46:52,815 --> 00:46:53,915
Asshole!

851
00:46:53,975 --> 00:46:56,560
Well don't ask me for my last 10, Marzipan...

852
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:58,726
and then expect me to tip you. There's
your tip.

853
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,446
Bye sweetie. Good luck with your
glands and shit.

854
00:47:01,502 --> 00:47:03,486
Thank you. Wasn't that good?!

855
00:47:04,253 --> 00:47:05,153
I liked her.

856
00:47:05,173 --> 00:47:07,285
I still have a couple of bucks. Do you
wanna get the ice-cream now?

857
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:09,046
Fuck the ice-cream. I want to
touch them.

858
00:47:11,641 --> 00:47:13,528
I don't know.

859
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:17,067
Which way did she go. She turn right?
Let's go ask her.

860
00:47:17,686 --> 00:47:19,214
Marzipan!

861
00:47:20,847 --> 00:47:22,379
[Guy]
Well that might be true but...

862
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:24,506
I still think a person your age should be carrying...

863
00:47:24,555 --> 00:47:26,646
at least a dollar in his pocket and if you had...

864
00:47:26,689 --> 00:47:27,689
that would have been the difference.

865
00:47:27,784 --> 00:47:29,083
You would have gotten yourself a little bit of skin.

866
00:47:29,165 --> 00:47:31,149
But it was still the best time of my life.

867
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:33,579
Are we friends now?

868
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:39,523
Cool!

869
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,057
I'd like it if you could block out a
little bit of private time for me...

870
00:47:55,191 --> 00:47:56,691
after today's round.

871
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,504
If you don't mind.

872
00:48:01,261 --> 00:48:03,629
You saying you want to come over and fuck off again?

873
00:48:05,604 --> 00:48:06,704
No that's not what...

874
00:48:06,737 --> 00:48:08,893
Wanna look for your underwear?

875
00:48:09,142 --> 00:48:09,943
Just give me 10 minutes.

876
00:48:09,975 --> 00:48:11,075
Guy.

877
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:14,091
I wanted to give you something before the round starts.

878
00:48:15,656 --> 00:48:19,155
A little white-out and a Lego piece
and you got your car back.

879
00:48:20,213 --> 00:48:21,815
Thanks buddy.

880
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:24,366
But I'm still gonna totally bust your nut.

881
00:48:25,397 --> 00:48:27,507
Ow. I don't think you need to say that.

882
00:48:27,575 --> 00:48:28,809
- I do.
- No, no.

883
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:30,704
- Say you're gonna kick my ass.
- Okay.

884
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:31,933
- That!
- Alright.

885
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,662
- See you there.
- See you there.

886
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,460
You're a?

887
00:48:37,465 --> 00:48:39,081
I don't know. Kids are weird.

888
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:04,670
<i>Stand by in 5,4,3,2...</i>

889
00:49:05,498 --> 00:49:09,879
<i>[Pete] Welcome America to round 2 of the
Golden Quill national spelling bee.</i>

890
00:49:09,941 --> 00:49:12,836
It is a point where, sadly, many have already gone home.

891
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:16,620
But the fighting spirit remains for
those who have survived.

892
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:19,984
And that number is 30. Thirty brave
determined... [fades out]

893
00:49:22,006 --> 00:49:23,506
Here are this rounds words.

894
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,591
Let's remember this competition is
in English, not marble mouth!

895
00:49:33,665 --> 00:49:35,307
[Proctor]
Rhapsodize.

896
00:49:36,929 --> 00:49:38,495
Rhapsodize.

897
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:41,858
Rhapsodize.

898
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:46,717
Rhapsodize

899
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:50,832
Rhapsodize.

900
00:49:52,604 --> 00:49:54,696
<i>- [Contest continues in background]</i>
- Joyce.

901
00:49:55,144 --> 00:49:57,002
I'm wondering if that's your...

902
00:49:57,331 --> 00:49:59,673
It's like a hair-clip or something
over there.

903
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:01,943
- Where?
- Underneath that seat. Can you see it?

904
00:50:02,223 --> 00:50:03,323
It's certainly not mine.

905
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:05,767
I just don't want you to lose something
that might cost... there you go.

906
00:50:06,377 --> 00:50:07,877
Give it a look.

907
00:50:08,043 --> 00:50:10,814
<i>[Guy narrating]
My behavior was ridiculous at best.</i>

908
00:50:12,453 --> 00:50:15,303
<i>I'm incredibly lucky I wasn't beaten
to death by the parents...</i>

909
00:50:15,771 --> 00:50:17,720
- There's nothing down there.
- Okay.

910
00:50:18,046 --> 00:50:19,546
<i>Or their children.</i>

911
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,499
That's a big never mind now.

912
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:25,349
Okay I want you to get ready to get super happy.

913
00:50:25,615 --> 00:50:27,507
We've got a celebration on our hands.

914
00:50:27,616 --> 00:50:29,232
What are you talking about?

915
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,473
It seems that...

916
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,530
your friend...

917
00:50:33,582 --> 00:50:35,239
has finally come to town.

918
00:50:35,411 --> 00:50:36,610
- My what?
- Yeah.

919
00:50:36,682 --> 00:50:38,389
Somebody's a woman today.

920
00:50:40,573 --> 00:50:42,343
I don't know what you're saying to me.

921
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:46,706
When you got up...

922
00:50:46,854 --> 00:50:48,424
I saw...

923
00:50:49,258 --> 00:50:51,270
your adulthood.

924
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:53,488
Adulthood?!

925
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:07,177
Congratulations. You must be vibrating.
That's so exciting.

926
00:51:07,384 --> 00:51:10,565
But you can celebrate later. Right now
you've got a tournament to win...

927
00:51:10,653 --> 00:51:11,752
you've got words to spell...

928
00:51:11,762 --> 00:51:15,474
even though your situation might not
be very camera friendly.

929
00:51:15,622 --> 00:51:16,821
Screw them!

930
00:51:16,871 --> 00:51:19,261
You get up there and you take this
tournament. You take what's yours.

931
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,885
You have a long walk to make up there
to excellence unfortunately...

932
00:51:23,018 --> 00:51:25,129
it is all the way up there...

933
00:51:25,205 --> 00:51:28,459
- <i>[Proctor] That is correct.</i>
- <i>[Pete] Next up is Joyce Sacks.</i>

934
00:51:28,562 --> 00:51:29,796
- [Proctor] She's from...
- [Joyce]?

935
00:51:29,821 --> 00:51:31,922
I know, I know. God so many
people watching...

936
00:51:31,993 --> 00:51:33,908
and I don't have so much as a sweatshirt to give you...

937
00:51:33,961 --> 00:51:36,577
but I don't so instead I want you to just keep thinking...

938
00:51:36,623 --> 00:51:38,187
these are not light pants...

939
00:51:38,234 --> 00:51:40,999
these are not light pants. You just
keep saying that to yourself.

940
00:51:41,084 --> 00:51:43,270
Competitor 1124.

941
00:51:43,318 --> 00:51:45,441
That's you. These are not light pants.

942
00:51:46,533 --> 00:51:48,717
Competitor 1124.

943
00:51:50,243 --> 00:51:51,993
[Proctor]
1124.

944
00:51:52,102 --> 00:51:55,411
Clearly we have a case of stage fright
brewing in the back row.

945
00:51:55,465 --> 00:51:56,964
[Joyce's mother]
Sweetheart?!

946
00:51:58,035 --> 00:52:00,143
- Sweetheart.
- Momma I can't.

947
00:52:00,237 --> 00:52:02,487
Oh baby girl.

948
00:52:02,534 --> 00:52:04,381
- I can't do it.
- I don't blame you.

949
00:52:04,444 --> 00:52:05,369
Looks like a super heavy flow.

950
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:10,224
Competitor 1124, you must make your
way to the microphone now...

951
00:52:10,567 --> 00:52:12,066
or be disqualified.

952
00:52:12,151 --> 00:52:14,312
Why don't you try and do like a

01:01:35,695 --> 01:01:37,872
No way, it wasn't. You're a
little liar.

1113
01:01:37,928 --> 01:01:39,771
- He thought you were the biggest threat.
- Great.

1114
01:01:39,814 --> 01:01:41,314
- And you were.
- Yep.

1115
01:01:43,313 --> 01:01:45,087
Dad I really like him.

1116
01:01:45,192 --> 01:01:46,901
You make me sick, you know that.

1117
01:01:46,949 --> 01:01:50,260
I'm not doing the plan anymore. I'm
just being friends.

1118
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,214
- Because we are now.
- No we're not.

1119
01:01:52,257 --> 01:01:53,657
I didn't know we would be.

1120
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,306
Really? I thought winning
wasn't everything.

1121
01:01:55,381 --> 01:01:56,978
It isn't everything, not now.

1122
01:01:57,048 --> 01:01:59,011
Sure sounds like it. You're a liar.

1123
01:01:59,088 --> 01:02:01,798
Guy, you showed me my first boobs.

1124
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,311
- What did he say?
- Another lie.

1125
01:02:06,476 --> 01:02:07,976
He's a lying machine.

1126

1127
01:02:10,179 --> 01:02:11,008
Please what?

1128
01:02:11,051 --> 01:02:13,481
My dad will be so disappointed in me if I lose.

1129
01:02:13,812 --> 01:02:15,311
I don't want that.

1130
01:02:15,404 --> 01:02:16,704
Well tough shit.

1131
01:02:16,741 --> 01:02:18,765
I guess you're just gonna have
to try and beat me now, huh.

1132
01:02:19,638 --> 01:02:21,137

- Yes this is an emergency.

1144

Please send the police to the

1145
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:03,831
What's the problem?

1146
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,243
I just saw a man drag a teenager into his room.

1147
01:05:06,286 --> 01:05:07,785
And she was screaming for help.

1148
01:05:07,901 --> 01:05:10,761
But as soon as the door shut, the
screaming suddenly stopped.

1149
01:05:11,925 --> 01:05:13,519
LAPD, open up!

1150
01:05:24,788 --> 01:05:27,217
What are you trying to do to me you little bitch.

1151
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,759
He's still got her in there.

Well at least they didn't press charges.

1159
01:05:48,488 --> 01:05:51,539
I'll be pressing the fucking charges.
It almost broke my goddamn face.

1160
01:05:51,591 --> 01:05:53,009

1161

1162

I'm getting it said right now.

you stop walking for one second!

Jesus Christ I'm kind of all you have.

1165
01:06:02,637 --> 01:06:04,206
We can't walk and talk!

1166
01:06:06,383 --> 01:06:07,883
What's wrong?

1167
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:11,288
I found out who your father is.

1168
01:06:12,678 --> 01:06:14,177
Oh, okay.

1169
01:06:17,076 --> 01:06:17,928
Good for you.

1170
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,853
I guess you're not as bad a reporter
as I thought you were.

1171
01:06:19,902 --> 01:06:22,018
Took you a while though, don't you think?

1172
01:06:22,505 --> 01:06:24,162
It was right there.

1173
01:06:31,137 --> 01:06:32,909
So that's what you're up to?

1174
01:06:33,955 --> 01:06:35,455
Yep.

1175
01:06:39,398 --> 01:06:42,431
Couple months ago the day my mom died
she finally told me who he was...

1176
01:06:42,724 --> 01:06:44,594
and where he was and...

1177
01:06:45,312 --> 01:06:46,812
and um...

1178
01:06:50,609 --> 01:06:53,187
Just pissed me off, obviously, so...

1179
01:06:54,277 --> 01:06:56,191
Here I am.

1180
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:04,122
He was just a traveling encyclopedia salesman and...

1181
01:07:04,161 --> 01:07:05,994
she was a waitress...

1182
01:07:06,096 --> 01:07:08,247
at a diner. And they...

1183
01:07:09,168 --> 01:07:12,589
She got pregnant and she told him and he took off.

1184
01:07:13,737 --> 01:07:15,666
That's it he never returned?

1185
01:07:16,236 --> 01:07:17,736
Nope.

1186
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:20,264
- He never called?
- Nothing.

1187
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,306
So he has no idea who you are!?

1188
01:07:24,706 --> 01:07:27,852
He has no clue. But he will.

1189
01:07:30,093 --> 01:07:33,351
As soon as I'm done embarrassing him and
his precious spelling bee, Bill Bowman...

1190
01:07:33,769 --> 01:07:36,346
will never forget who I am.

1191
01:07:37,076 --> 01:07:39,461
And I think that is just the bare minimum...

1192
01:07:39,537 --> 01:07:42,167
that a son can expect from his father, don't you?

1193
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:52,417
Well, good digging.

1194
01:07:53,572 --> 01:07:55,541
- Did you park up here?
- Uh huh.

1195

<i>[Pete] Dr. Bowman, I know that
Director Deagans resignation...</i>

1196
01:08:01,734 --> 01:08:04,600
was as difficult for you as it was
for her. Your thoughts?

1197
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:07,407
She served this tournament well for many years.

1198
01:08:08,325 --> 01:08:11,121
It's a tragedy that the frayed
integrity of this year's tournament...

1199
01:08:11,351 --> 01:08:13,436
has touched her post as well.

1200
01:08:13,724 --> 01:08:16,881
I hope we can finish up now without anymore casualties.

1201
01:08:17,223 --> 01:08:18,880
Profoundly stated.

1202
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:21,848
Now, let's begin this, the final round.

1203
01:08:22,212 --> 01:08:24,270

First up. Eric Tai from
Sorwood Wisconsin.

1205

Fear of exhaustion...

otherwise known as "Lexicographer's Curse".

1279
01:12:44,812 --> 01:12:47,901
Is it derived from the Greek "kopo" meaning fatigue?

Yes.

01:21:36,847 --> 01:21:38,847
<i>Maybe there should have been a screaming match.</i>

1422
01:21:41,776 --> 01:21:43,276
<i>Or fight.</i>

1423
01:21:44,245 --> 01:21:45,939
<i>Maybe some tears.</i>

1424
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:55,032
<i>But I guess I just wanna move on.</i>

1425
01:21:57,414 --> 01:21:59,482
<i>And let you do the same.</i>

1426
01:22:07,685 --> 01:22:09,333
<i>What's done is done.</i>

1427
01:22:10,794 --> 01:22:12,432
<i>I can't change what happened.</i>

1428
01:22:15,699 --> 01:22:17,437
<i>All I can do...</i>

1429
01:22:18,932 --> 01:22:20,782
<i>all I wanna do...</i>

1430
01:22:26,619 --> 01:22:29,049
<i>Is leave you with this apology.</i>

1431
01:22:30,274 --> 01:22:31,935
<i>This note.</i>

1432
01:22:33,454 --> 01:22:36,742
<i>Which started with me telling you my feelings were hurt.</i>

1433
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:43,736
What the hell can you possibly write...

1434
01:22:43,865 --> 01:22:46,592
that I would be interested in reading!?

1435
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:52,933
There was a bit in there about me being your son.

1436
01:23:40,026 --> 01:23:42,675
[Guy narrating] And as much as I'd
like to hurt your feelings...

1437
01:23:43,642 --> 01:23:45,444
<i>and call you names...</i>

1438
01:23:45,993 --> 01:23:47,529
<i>they're just words...</i>

1439
01:23:47,951 --> 01:23:49,450
<i>and it wouldn't change a thing.</i>

1440
01:23:51,228 --> 01:23:52,999
<i>That's not what this note was for.</i>

1441
01:23:58,757 --> 01:24:01,600
<i>Hopefully it has explained why I did what I did.</i>

1442
01:24:02,824 --> 01:24:05,347
<i>And maybe even have you understand.</i>

1443
01:24:06,857 --> 01:24:09,028
<i>If not, that's fine.</i>

1444
01:24:14,058 --> 01:24:15,894
<i>Yours literally...</i>

1445
01:24:16,113 --> 01:24:17,613
<i>Guy Trilby.</i>

1446
01:24:33,376 --> 01:24:35,613
- Hey spelling nerd.
- Yes?

1447
01:24:35,656 --> 01:24:38,526
- Can you spell "douche bag"?
- Of course.

1448
01:24:41,053 --> 01:24:44,706
- How do you spell "pick up your books"?
- That's a sentence!

1449
01:24:53,644 --> 01:24:55,270
Hey slum-dog.

1450
01:24:57,709 --> 01:24:58,520
Wow!

1451
01:24:58,563 --> 01:25:00,277
Right! Get over here!

1452
01:25:06,064 --> 01:25:07,464
Where'd you get this?

1453
01:25:07,468 --> 01:25:09,550
I got this old police car at an auction...

1454
01:25:09,635 --> 01:25:11,924
with my half of your winnings. So
thank you very much.

1455
01:25:11,967 --> 01:25:15,088
You got me two cars in one month.
You're a nice guy.

1456
01:25:15,218 --> 01:25:16,797
Now to pay you back...

1457
01:25:17,773 --> 01:25:19,641
how about we go chase some bad guys.

1458
01:25:19,932 --> 01:25:21,432
Love too!

1459
01:25:27,487 --> 01:25:29,260
We're coming to get you!

1460
01:25:32,926 --> 01:25:34,615
<i>[Chaitanya]
Get the bad guys!</i>
