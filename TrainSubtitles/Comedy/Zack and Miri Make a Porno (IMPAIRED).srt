00:26:38,618 --> 00:26:40,617
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?

444
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:44,258
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me? That's a rad idea.

445
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:48,176
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's
Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend,

446
00:26:48,177 --> 00:26:50,058
he said he makes
a hundred grand a year

447
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:53,698
because he shoots and distributes
his own porno flicks.

448
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:56,057
If it's so easy,
how come everybody doesn't do it?

449
00:26:56,058 --> 00:26:59,379
Because other people have options
and dignity, which we do not have,

450
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,500
which puts us in an amazingly
advantageous position.

451
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:04,099
Fuck you, I have dignity.

452
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,380
Where? Is it hidden
in your gigantic underpants

453
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:09,980
that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?

454
00:27:09,981 --> 00:27:13,901
Every woman has a pair of those
period panties. That's, like, a fact.

455
00:27:13,902 --> 00:27:15,021
Okay. Families.

456
00:27:15,022 --> 00:27:17,860
I bet people don't make porno,
because they have families.

457
00:27:17,861 --> 00:27:22,702
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry. My grandparents are dead.

458
00:27:22,703 --> 00:27:24,501
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

459
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:27,868
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.

460
00:27:27,903 --> 00:27:32,422
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks
in it. Look at Paris Hilton.

461
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:34,703
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision,

462
00:27:34,704 --> 00:27:37,023
now she's selling fragrances
to tweens.

463
00:27:37,024 --> 00:27:39,303
And I'm pretty sure
she's legally retarded.

464
00:27:39,304 --> 00:27:40,463
That's for tweens?

465
00:27:40,464 --> 00:27:43,264
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy
who made Girls Gone Wild?

466
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:46,224
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot
piece of shit in the world

467
00:27:46,225 --> 00:27:48,465
and he has a jet and a fucking island.

468
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:53,344
Look, there's got to be a less extreme
solution to our financial woes here.

469
00:27:53,345 --> 00:27:55,985
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.

470
00:27:55,986 --> 00:27:57,866
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.

471
00:27:57,867 --> 00:28:01,544
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?

472
00:28:01,545 --> 00:28:03,987
I would not eat food that you gave me,
that's true.

473
00:28:03,988 --> 00:28:06,386
MIRl: I mean, nobody
wants to see us fuck, Zack.

474
00:28:06,387 --> 00:28:10,028
ZACK: Everybody wants to see
anybody fuck. I hate Rosie O'Donnell,

475
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:13,586
but if someone said' "I got a tape of
Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"

476
00:28:13,587 --> 00:28:16,308
I'd be like, "Why aren't we
watching that right now?"

477
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:17,707
Because she's famous. Hello.

478
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,868
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.

479
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:23,346
My underwear and your ass
are famous' we're not.

480
00:28:23,347 --> 00:28:25,908
So who the F
would wanna watch us fuck?

481
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:28,708
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?

482
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:30,508
- Are you serious?
- Of course.

483
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,548
If you heard
that someone we graduated with

484
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:35,028
was in a fucking porno movie,
you'd watch it, right?

485
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:37,590
I'd watch that guy Brandon
suck a cock, I just met him.

486
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,230
With this mailing list,
we have almost a thousand people

487
00:28:40,231 --> 00:28:43,070
that would definitely buy a porno
we were in just to be like,

488
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:46,391
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick. "

489
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:51,192
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks
a pop, bam' we have paid off our bills.

490
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:55,671
ZACK: So' what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.

491
00:28:55,672 --> 00:28:58,232
Oh' wow,
like you've never done that before.

492
00:28:58,233 --> 00:29:01,712
How many guys have you met in a bar,
taken home,

493
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:05,392
banged with your mouth
and then never talked to again?

494
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:06,991
That's what we call a stranger.

495
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:11,033
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck
anybody that I pick up in bars.

496
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:16,233
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the
porno movie for some weird reason.

497
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:17,753
I guess...

498
00:29:20,274 --> 00:29:21,755
We could fuck.

499
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:24,314
- Ew.
- Fuck you.

500
00:29:24,315 --> 00:29:27,515
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking
guy and everything-

501
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,434
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.

502
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,635
- How does that feel?
- Dude' I'm just saying

503
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:35,395
it'd be weird and wrong, you know,
like fucking my brother.

504
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:38,196
Okay, seriously,
we're just talking about sex, okay?

505
00:29:38,197 --> 00:29:42,556
It's for a purpose. It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy

506
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:46,717
would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.

507
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:49,756
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,

508
00:29:49,757 --> 00:29:53,277
"Look' this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash. "

509
00:29:53,438 --> 00:29:55,838
- Oh, my God.
- What?

510
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,959
You're just doing this because you've
always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?

511
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:05,279
Yes. I've gone my whole life pretending
that I want nothing to do with you,

512
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,600
just hoping one day
we'd be in such dire financial straits

513
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:12,480
that I could use it
to finally make my move on you.

514

MIRl: You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.

515

See' I was pretending to cry
right there.

516
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:24,320
MIRl:
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy,

517
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:28,241
like if we got way too drunk one night
and accidentally fucked, you know?

518
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:32,803
No. We'd be going in
with the understanding that it's-

519
00:30:32,804 --> 00:30:34,242
A business decision.

520
00:30:34,243 --> 00:30:36,883
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.

521
00:30:36,884 --> 00:30:38,368
- Right.
- And by end,

522

I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.

Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.

524
00:30:43,684 --> 00:30:47,523
I've seen your ass and the rest of you
naked around a billion times already.

525

- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.

You've never seen my dick.

where you got blasted,

528
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:57,924
and Houls dared you
to give yourself head,

529
00:30:57,925 --> 00:31:00,284
and we all watched you try for,
like, an hour.

530

Oh' yeah. Thanks by the way, for
fucking letting me do that. Thank you.

about each other.

just be one more thing.

and we're huddled around a flaming

like a couple of steno bums.

535

to pay off our debt, pay our bills,

to spend on the flat screen.

Fuck that.

No, no, no. With your cut of the profits,
you're gonna get two flat screens.

One in your living room,
one in your bathroom.

- Yeah.

there ain't no moles on there?

I know that
because I'm not a fucking idiot.

702

In our movie,

Hold up, hold up. So who's all having
sex with who in this movie?

708
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:21,544
As of last night,
I was having sex with Zack.

What? Han Solo ain't never had no sex
with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.

00:40:26,547 --> 00:40:29,065
ZACK: Guys' this isn't
a literal adaptation here.

711
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,225
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.

712
00:40:32,226 --> 00:40:35,826
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.

713
00:40:35,827 --> 00:40:38,867
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?

714
00:40:38,868 --> 00:40:43,267
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her
and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?

715
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:47,066
Uh, no, because
they're brother and sister,

716
00:40:47,067 --> 00:40:49,787
and according to Miri'
brothers and sisters can't fuck.

717
00:40:49,788 --> 00:40:52,268
But you said,
that this wasn't a literal translation,

718
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:56,189
so that means Lester's character
could have sex with Miri's character.

719
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:00,309
Because I would love to fucking eat
her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.

720
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,789
Dream on, pal,
it's never gonna happen, okay?

721
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,669
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See' she's fine- Wait, what?

722
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,790
Yep. I mean, everyone else is having
sex with more than one person

723
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:10,629
in this movie all of a sudden,

724
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:16,191
so I think it's' you know'
not fair if I'm only fucking you.

725
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:19,712
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?

726
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:21,751
Look, Miri,

727
00:41:21,752 --> 00:41:25,191
we got plenty of sex going on in this
thing, you don't have to do that.

728
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:28,791
Zack, it's fine. I mean I have slept with
way worse-looking guys than Lester.

729
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:31,512
I just wanna do my part for the movie
like everyone else.

730

You're having sex in the movie,
you don't need to fuck someone else.

- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you' though.

732
00:41:37,808 --> 00:41:40,873
So don't we need to vary it up
to keep it fair?

00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:43,234
Fair for-? I don't- What?
Fair for who?

01:21:09,287 --> 01:21:11,807
You already left one white boy
down in my basement

1333
01:21:11,808 --> 01:21:14,726
while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker

1334
01:21:14,727 --> 01:21:18,087
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.

1335
01:21:18,088 --> 01:21:20,967
Oh' what in the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1336
01:21:20,968 --> 01:21:24,087
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
WIFE: White boys love me.

1337
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,569
White boy.

1338
01:21:26,529 --> 01:21:28,649
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?

1339
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,490
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?

1340
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:32,328
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.

1341
01:21:32,329 --> 01:21:34,408
Yeah.

1342
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:40,209
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.

1343
01:21:40,244 --> 01:21:41,810
It's just through this hallway.

1344
01:21:41,811 --> 01:21:44,249
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1345
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:47,851
What the fuck you looking at?

1346
01:21:47,852 --> 01:21:50,410
Why you gotta be yelling at me
in front of my director?

1347
01:21:50,411 --> 01:21:51,851
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.

1348
01:21:51,852 --> 01:21:53,931
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.

1349
01:21:53,932 --> 01:21:57,851
WelI' why don't he direct my ass to a
new husband? How about that shit?

1350
01:21:57,852 --> 01:22:00,333
- That's the bedroom.
DELANEY: Keep talking, maybe he will.

1351
01:22:00,334 --> 01:22:02,451
Oh' don't nobody
want them saggy-ass balls!

1352
01:22:02,452 --> 01:22:05,573
Saggy balls? Look at these
sagging-ass titties you got around here.

1353
01:22:05,574 --> 01:22:08,572
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.

1354
01:22:11,534 --> 01:22:13,414
Oh' shit.

1355
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:16,134
Where's my paintball gun at?

1356
01:22:16,135 --> 01:22:18,894
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.

1357
01:22:18,895 --> 01:22:23,294
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered"
to me again.

1358
01:22:24,175 --> 01:22:27,974
Roll the film for the man, please,
so we can see what he thinks.

1359
01:22:27,975 --> 01:22:31,496
Just jump through it. I ain't
got all night. The bitch is on me.

"Nigga Rich Productions. " Classy.

1361

- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?

1362
01:22:37,697 --> 01:22:40,416
Plus' it sounds like an underground
gay fuck club.

1363
01:22:40,417 --> 01:22:42,216
"I met a guy at DreamWorks. " Yeah.

1364
01:22:42,217 --> 01:22:46,577
All right, so we got
Lester and Stacey fucking.

1365
01:22:46,578 --> 01:22:48,777
Then we got
Barry and Bubbles fucking.

1366
01:22:49,617 --> 01:22:52,257
And then this boring bullshit.

1367
01:22:56,658 --> 01:23:00,377
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene,
would you?

1368
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:02,377
Uh...

1369
01:23:02,378 --> 01:23:05,579
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?

1370
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,899
We never shot it.

1371
01:23:08,019 --> 01:23:10,578
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,

1372
01:23:10,579 --> 01:23:13,539
Miri came out of the backroom
and said she couldn't do it.

1373
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:17,860
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped? So...

1374
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:21,780
- Wait, so Miri-
- Never fucked nobody.

1375
01:23:21,781 --> 01:23:23,300
Just you.

1376
01:23:24,342 --> 01:23:28,020
Now, I wonder why she did that.

1377
01:23:28,021 --> 01:23:30,701
- Hm.
- Hm.

1378
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:35,782
You see, there was a time when I was
just a bitter old fuck making coffees,

1379
01:23:35,783 --> 01:23:37,822
and Stacey was just a lap dancer

1380
01:23:37,823 --> 01:23:39,903
and Barry and Bubbles
didn't know each other

1381
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:43,222
and this fooI here,
hell, I don't even know what he was.

1382
01:23:43,223 --> 01:23:46,343
- A white supremacist.
- Man' fuck you.

1383
01:23:46,344 --> 01:23:48,263
Then two people come along

1384
01:23:48,264 --> 01:23:51,504
and showed us something
we didn't know existed.

1385
01:23:51,505 --> 01:23:56,464
A world of possibilities
where plain old people just like us

1386
01:23:56,499 --> 01:23:58,750
could do something speciaI.

1387
01:23:58,785 --> 01:24:02,865
Even if it's something as simple
as filming people fucking.

1388
01:24:12,787 --> 01:24:16,106
Sometimes we just need someone

1389
01:24:16,107 --> 01:24:20,427
to show us something
we can't see for ourselves

1390
01:24:22,468 --> 01:24:25,266
and then we're changed forever.

1391
01:24:35,549 --> 01:24:39,149
So as you can see'
our movie ain't got no ending.

1392
01:24:40,189 --> 01:24:42,630
Every movie needs an ending'
don't it?

1393
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:48,151
Peace.

1394
01:24:50,071 --> 01:24:54,111
Delaney,
you're a slick cupid motherfucker.

1395
01:24:54,112 --> 01:24:56,070
Ain't love grand?

1396
01:24:56,071 --> 01:24:59,151

running through my goddamn house?

[DOOR SLAMS]

1398

1399
01:25:14,394 --> 01:25:16,434
Miri.

1400
01:25:16,634 --> 01:25:19,433
- Miri.
MIRl: Zack?

1401
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:21,633
ZACK: Miri. I'm sorry.
MIRl: Get out.

1402
01:25:21,634 --> 01:25:23,233
- Close the door.
- It was closed.

1403
01:25:23,234 --> 01:25:26,474
- It was closed over-
- Just close the fucking door' Zack.

1404
01:25:26,475 --> 01:25:31,114
I never slept with Stacey that night,
okay? I swear to God.

1405
01:25:31,115 --> 01:25:33,314
When we got into my room,
you know what we did?

1406
01:25:33,315 --> 01:25:37,875
We talked about you, and us
and how things were different

1407
01:25:37,876 --> 01:25:40,916
and how I was
too much of a fucking pussy

1408
01:25:40,917 --> 01:25:43,876
to just tell you how I felt about you.

1409
01:25:44,076 --> 01:25:48,436
And I know- I know that that's only
because of all the stupid shit we said

1410
01:25:48,437 --> 01:25:53,998
about how we wouldn't let sex
change us, but it did. It changed me.

1411
01:25:54,277 --> 01:25:56,917
That has to be love, right?

1412
01:25:56,952 --> 01:25:59,565
It has to be love

1413
01:25:59,598 --> 01:26:04,038
and just so you know, I can't go back
to being just friends anymore,

1414
01:26:04,839 --> 01:26:06,758
- because I just can't.
- Good.

1415
01:26:06,759 --> 01:26:09,118
And I think-

1416
01:26:09,919 --> 01:26:11,960
I think that you feel the same way.

1417
01:26:12,278 --> 01:26:17,480
Because that night after I left,
you didn't fuck Lester.

1418
01:26:20,361 --> 01:26:22,600
What's up, Zack?

1419
01:26:32,081 --> 01:26:33,241
You know what?

1420
01:26:33,242 --> 01:26:36,000
I don't care that you're fucking
Lester, okay? How's that?

1421
01:26:36,001 --> 01:26:38,761
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.

1422
01:26:38,762 --> 01:26:43,521
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life

1423
01:26:43,522 --> 01:26:47,163
because I love you, and I have
for as long as I can remember.

1424
01:26:47,284 --> 01:26:50,563
And I would rather die
than be without you, Miriam Linky.

1425
01:26:50,564 --> 01:26:52,603
Miri's last name is Linky?

1426
01:26:52,924 --> 01:26:55,562
You're gonna fuck a guy
who doesn't know your last name?

1427
01:26:55,563 --> 01:26:58,443
Or that you beat up Carl Roth
in the sixth grade? I know that.

1428
01:26:58,444 --> 01:27:01,404
Or what your senior prom dress
would've looked like had we gone

1429
01:27:01,405 --> 01:27:04,364
but we decided not to,
and we got drunk alone instead.

1430
01:27:04,365 --> 01:27:06,444
Or that you washed your hair
in the toilet.

1431
01:27:06,445 --> 01:27:07,724
We're not fucking' Zack.

1432
01:27:07,725 --> 01:27:09,724
Or that you're not fucking Zack-
What?

1433
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,884
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.

1434
01:27:11,885 --> 01:27:14,925
I even tried to talk her into giving me
the fucking Dutch rudder.

1435
01:27:14,926 --> 01:27:17,047
Shot me down on that too.

1436
01:27:17,646 --> 01:27:20,686
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder-?

1437
01:27:20,687 --> 01:27:22,286
All right, you grab your dick,

1438
01:27:22,287 --> 01:27:24,406
then you have someone else
work your arm.

1439
01:27:24,407 --> 01:27:25,807
Here, let me show you.

1440
01:27:25,808 --> 01:27:29,007
All right, grab my arm. I'm grabbing
my dick, you're grabbing my arm.

1441
01:27:29,008 --> 01:27:32,207
Now work it. Work my arm.
See that shit? Work it up and down.

1442
01:27:32,208 --> 01:27:34,328
It's like someone else
is jerking you off.

1443
01:27:34,329 --> 01:27:35,452
Okay.

1444
01:27:35,487 --> 01:27:37,208
There's the double Dutch rudder,

1445
01:27:37,209 --> 01:27:39,567
which' I grab my dick,
you grab your dick,

1446
01:27:39,568 --> 01:27:42,207
you work my arm, I work your arm'
same time.

1447
01:27:42,208 --> 01:27:44,648
It's like jerking off together
but not gay.

1448
01:27:44,649 --> 01:27:47,209
We're not touching dicks,
each other's dicks anyway.

1449
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:50,168
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.

01:27:50,169 --> 01:27:53,130
It feels good, sir. Try me, come on.

Sorry to change the subject on you,
Lester,

1452
01:27:55,770 --> 01:28:01,370
but if you're not fucking Miri,
why is your dick out right now?

1453
01:28:01,371 --> 01:28:04,772
Because I live here now,
and I like to be naked.

1454
01:28:04,852 --> 01:28:06,450
- What?
- When you moved out,

1455
01:28:06,451 --> 01:28:10,092
she couldn't afford to pay her rent
by herself, so I moved in to help.

1456
01:28:10,093 --> 01:28:12,051
But you just came out of her room.

1457
01:28:12,052 --> 01:28:14,292
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.

1458
01:28:14,293 --> 01:28:17,011
Wait, wait, wait. She changed rooms?

1459
01:28:17,012 --> 01:28:20,692
Yeah, she said she did it because she
missed the smell of you or some shit.

[SNIFFS]

1461
01:28:22,773 --> 01:28:24,612
I don't smell anything.

1462

But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.

1463
01:28:29,174 --> 01:28:32,574
- Night, Zack.
- Night.

1464
01:28:36,214 --> 01:28:37,775
Do you?

1465
01:28:40,095 --> 01:28:41,735
Then why are you crying?

1466
01:28:42,054 --> 01:28:44,896
Because I missed you so much.

1467
01:28:45,176 --> 01:28:47,255

Me too.

1468
01:28:47,976 --> 01:28:50,416
I love you.

- I love you, I love you.
ZACK: I love you.

I don't mean to alarm you

1471
01:28:57,337 --> 01:29:00,216
but I think I just jerked off Lester
a little bit.

1472
01:29:00,777 --> 01:29:03,177

- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?

Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.

- Yeah.

- Like fucking a flashlight.
