00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,231
- l thought he straightened out.
- Not that Charlie.

163
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,430
My Charlie. My son Charlie?
He's on the naughty list?

164
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,835
[shrieking]

165
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,792
- There's gotta be a mistake.
- We don't make mistakes.

166
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,151
l'm sorry, Santa.
Please excuse me.

167
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,836
How could this happen? ls this
what you were trying to tell me?

168
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,997
Great! You told him! Let's get
you dressed for that meeting.

169
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,556
l can't have the meeting here.
l'm gonna have to see Charlie.

170
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,912
- Number two, tell him now.
- Tell me what, guys? Come clean.

171
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,474
- Santa, there's a clause.
- That would be me.

172
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,194
No, l mean there's another
Santa clause.

173
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,788
Curtis, in case you haven't
noticed - this time of year,

174
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,275
the malls are filled with
other ''Santa Clauses''.

175
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,994
Yes, but there's another
Santa clause.

176
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,795
There was a first clause,
but also a second clause.

177
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,353
Get on with it!

178
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,192
When the last Santa fell off your roof
and you put on his coat, you found this.

179
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,477
Right. ''He who wears the coat

180
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,794
takes on the responsibilities
of Santa Claus.''

181
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,876
And the rest
would be history, right?

182
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,879
But it seems our number two elf,
the keeper of the handbook,

183
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,873
overlooked the single
most important detail

184
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,877
in the history of Christmas!

185
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,392
Wow! One mistake in 900 years.

186
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,072
Look.

187
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,996
- l can't see that.
- Better now?

188
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,349
- Or now?
- Well...

189
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,791
- Better now?
- lt's gettin' there.

190
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,275
- Or now?
- l can't see anything.

191
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,075
l see. Good, good, good.
l see it. OK.

192
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,189
''The card holder acknowledges
a woman of his choosing...''

193
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,552
''True love... Not valid
in the state of Utah...''

194
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,268
''Holy...

195
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,833
matrimony?!''

196
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,349
- l gotta get married!
- Yes.

197
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,108
lt's... the Mrs clause.

198
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,714
[they sing
''Here Comes The Bride'']

199
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,350
What if l don't want
to get married?

200
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,478
Oh, dear. The de-Santification
process has begun!

201
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,034
The de-Santification?

202
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,199
Are you telling me that clause
says if l don't get married...

203
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,796
l don't get to be
Santa any more?

204
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,153
Wh-... what about the kids?

205
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,917
What about the elves?

206
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,518
- What about you guys?
- lt's not completely hopeless.

207
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,835
You still have time
to find a wife.

208
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,395
- How much time do l have?
- 28 days.

209
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,950
28 days? So l've gotta...
find a wife by Christmas.

210
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,954
Actually, Christmas Eve.

211
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,070
- l guess it's over.
- No! You can't think that way!

212
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,430
Please, don't give up hope.

213
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,391
Cos if you do, then we have to.

214
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,834
- [delighted cries]
- Whoa!

215
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,468
Christmas is getting
very complicated.

216
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,152
[faintly] Santa?

217
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,475
Santa?

218
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,756
- Are you with us?
- l'm sorry, yes. Yes, l am.

219
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,034
Well, on behalf of Father Time and
the Council of Legendary Figures,

220
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,839
l'd like to thank you for being
such a gracious host.

221
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,235
- Hear, hear.
- What a lovely place.

222
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,678
Without further ado, let us
convene the year-end conference.

223
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,553
- Tooth Fairy.
- Thank you, Mother Nature.

224
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,238
Fellow Council members,

225
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,828
l'd like to again propose
a new name for myself.

226
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,791
- Oh, please!
- Good heavens!

227
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,597
ln the past, you have rejected
Tooth Man, Tooth Guy and Tooth.

228
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,951
- Because they stunk.
- Today, l'd like to submit...

229
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,513
- Captain Floss.
- Nice!

230
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,834
- Plaque Man.
- [snorts]

231
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,270
- And Roy.
- [laughs] Roy! No.

232
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,517
No kid's gonna put a tooth under
a pillow for a man named Roy.

233
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,313
This from someone in a diaper
who shoots people's butts!

234
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,396
Wait a minute. l got it.
l got it. l got it.

235
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,750
Now, how about this?
The Molarnator.

236
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,440
The Molarnator! l like it.

237
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,949
Thank you, Santa. Can we
vote now on the Molarnator?

238
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,038
All in favour of a name change
for Tooth Fairy?

239
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,838
All right. And all opposed?

240
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,512
Easter Bunny?

241
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,596
- Sandman?
- [snores] Wha-...?

242
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,075
What happened?
Was l asleep again?

243
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,793
Name change for the Tooth Fairy.
Yes or no?

244
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,752
No. l'm sorry.

245
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,877
All right. Next item on the
agenda. Santa? Status report.

246
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,959
OK. First, welcome to the North
Pole. Great to have you here.

247
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,958
This is our big time of year,
so things are busy as usual.

248
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,152
There's a little speed bump
in the road this year.

249
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,158
- You all know Charlie.
- l love Charlie!

250
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,793
- Great kid.
- Good boy.

251
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,558
- Sweet kid.
- Good teeth.

252
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,070
Well, Charlie...
got himself on the naughty list.

253
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,799
- What?!
- Oh, my!

254
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,514
l'm struggling with the timing,
cos it's...

255
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,712
l gotta be up here and l've also
got to take care of Charlie...

256
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,956
That's every parent's dilemma:

257
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,555
how to balance
work and children.

258
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,991
Most people lose sleep over that.

259
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,910
Tell me about it! l have 33,000
offspring. All in private school.

260
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,079
Well, to top it off... l have to get
married by Christmas Eve.

261
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,794
- What?!
- Otherwise l stop being Santa.

262
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,194
- What?!
- No!

263
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,788
The de-Santification process
has already begun.

264
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,672
Wait a minute.

265
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,678
You do look thinner, and...

266
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,872
- Your beard is shorter! Right?
- [others] You're right!

267
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,673
Apparently,
it's called the Mrs clause.

268
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,036
Don't mess with me, Santa.
l'm pre-El Nino.

269
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,675
No, l'm not messing with
anybody. What l'm saying is...

270
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,313
l have to find a wife in...

271
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,592
27 days, 20 hours
and 1 7 minutes.

272
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,518
- Wow!
- lt's what l do.

273
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,550
[chuckles]

274
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,148
Wait a minute. Cupid!
Cupid, come over here.

275
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,316
- What do you need?
- Shoot me with a dart.

276
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,591
- Then l'll fall in love.
- First of all, they're arrows.

277
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,278
Second of all, no can do.

278
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,670
- Why not?
- Arrows have no effect on us.

279
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,076
lf they did, l would have shot
myself, met a nice girl,

280
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,872
left the business years ago.

281
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,798
- Enough with the questions.
- You can't stop being Santa.

282
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,239
l don't want to.

283
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,158
Kids are 86 per cent happier
since you've taken the job.

284
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,271
- He's right.
- This is all l want to do.

285
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,590
But what am l gonna do?

286
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,552
Well, you...

287
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,555
You can't be two places at once.

288
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,189
Maybe you can be.

289
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,276
OK, everyone, can l get the
room for a minute? Thank you.

290
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,960
Can l just...? One minute.
Take a cocoa break.

291
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,548
Have a nice long break.
Relax, everyone.

292
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,389
l want to show Santa some improvements
on the pantograph. Thanks.

293
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,548
Walk with me. l've tripled the RAM
and reconfigured the circuitry.

294
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,513
l see you've externalised
the power source

295
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,108
to make better use of
the electromagnetic energy.

296
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,595
No, it's just there
cos it looks really cool.

297
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,438
Yeah, it does. [chuckles]

298
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,155
Wait a minute.
You tripled the RAM.

299
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,872
l see where this is going. l am
not getting in that machine.

300
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,874
Besides, creating a copy of
Santa won't solve our problems.

301
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,754
- The elves'll know.
- But this would be a special toy!

302
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,350
- How's that, Curtis?
- l added a fuzzy logic circuit.

303
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,675
The duplicate will look
and think just like you.

304
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,270
When you're with your family, dealing
with Charlie, looking for a wife...

305
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,392
The toy will be up here melting
in front of my fireplace.

306
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,318
No, the toy Santa will be
dealing with business up here.

307
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,396
l can deal with
business up here.

308
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,512
Santa, if the elves find out
we've made a switch... Aaggh!

309
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,949
No! No!
This machine is not the answer.

310
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,878
[clattering and squeaking]

311
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,276
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You! You! Shoo!

312

Look, you can't get
much better than that.

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,430
And l promise -
it won't hurt a bit.

317
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,593

lt's perfect!

That's because it's me,
Einstein.

322
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,039
- Santa, are you all right?
- Yeah, l got a shock in there.

323
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,957
ls there supposed to be a shock?

324
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,798
Aagghh!

- Not bad yourself.

about you that l like.

There's something
about you that l like!

- Bernard, l need your help.
- What do you mean?

343
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,038
What l mean is
l gotta go see Charlie

344
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,549
and l want you to
convince the elves...

that... toy Santa is me.

346
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,192
- Hm. Have you seen that thing?
- l've seen it.

347
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,231
Keep the elves
at a distance and say

348
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,555
that l've changed my look,
it'll work.

349
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,194
Santa, we're in
way over our heads here.

350
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,675
lf anybody can do this,
it's you, number one.

l... l'm not gonna lie to all the elves.

352
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,033
l myself think he looks
absolutely terrific!

353
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,311
Better and fresher somehow
than he has in years.

354
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,433
There's now a more supple
veneer to his skin

355
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,869
and an added lustre
to the thickness of his hair.

356
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,195
You could almost say
there's a...

357
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,558
a toy-like quality to him.

358
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,238
Most importantly, he's very
happy with his new look,

359
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,432
and l would caution you all
not to point or stare

360
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,598
or use the word ''plastic''.

361
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,273
OK? OK.

[irritable grumbling]

Comet, because l don't
want to take Prancer.

365
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,396
l want to take a trip with you.
When's the last time we had a cruise?

366
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,158
l love you, buddy.

367
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,949
Besides, Prancer had too many
apples. We know what that means.

368
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,355
Before you go,
take a look at your watch.

369
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,550
Hey! Can't go anywhere
without that.

370
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,990
- l've done some work on it.
- lt's beautiful. lt really is.

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,635
- You like it?
- The workmanship's fabulous.

372
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,877
lt has a power reserve that measures
how much magic you have left.

373
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,718
- lt's at ten.
- That should be enough.

374
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,549
But if you use up any magic
for any reason the level drops.

375

Santa, if it gets to zero - you won't
be able to return to the Pole.

Uh-oh.

377
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,750
Then let's not let it get to zero!

378
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,077
- Now, look at me.
- Mm-hm?

379
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,355
What's the most important thing?

380
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,678
For you not to touch Santa?

381
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,311
For you to come back!

chill out a little bit, OK?

Come on! lt's not like we're
pullin' the sleigh. Right?

There's no packages.
lt's one stop.

we're gonna go see Charlie.

weight there, huh?

- Slim-Fast?
- You don't know how fast.

- We should get going.
- Oh, OK.

395

How do you always know
when there's a problem?

l see you when you're sleepin'.
l know when you're awake.

Which is a pretty frightening
concept when you think about it.

398
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,915
We're really worried
about Charlie.

399
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,316
He keeps upping the ante. This
time he defaced school property.

- lt's classic acting out.
- l'm blaming myself for this.

- We're both his parents.
- Where is he?

402
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,873
He's waiting for us
in Principal Newman's office.

403
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,595
Something about her makes me
want to deface public property.

404
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,756
Hello, Mr Calvin. Laura, Neil.

405
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,475
- Miss Newman.
- Principal Newman.

406
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,719
Haven't seen you since the last
time Charlie was in trouble.

407
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,876
l've been travelling for work.

408
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,152
lf you spent more time with your
son there'd be fewer problems.

409
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,316
Then l wouldn't spend
so much time with you,

410
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,317
which is always
such a pleasure.

411
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,876
A battle of wits. lt's a shame
you come unarmed. Excuse me.

412
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,793
Ouch!

413
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,838
Good morning, Principal Newman.

414
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,475
Mr Picardo, l want you to look into
my eyes. What do you see?

415
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,350
lt's dark. And it's cold.

416
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,949
lt's your future, Mr Picardo -
keep this up

417
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,310
and you will spend
your life stabbing trash.

418
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,237
- Do l make myself clear?
- Yes.

419
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,511
- So what are you gonna do?
- l'm going to geometry.

420
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,596
Have a nice trip.

421
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,835
lt's an affront to authority and
blatant disrespect for property.

422
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,838
lf this continues l'll have no
other recourse than to suspend..

423
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,873
Excuse me. ls there a rest stop between
here and the end of the lecture?

424
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,753
l'm more interested in why this
happened in the first place.

425
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,872
So am l. Charlie, we're all
worried about you.

426
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,029
lt feels like you're trying to
get someone's attention.

427
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,156
What's bothering you?

428
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,473
- Dr Miller?
- Neil.

429
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,229
- Neil, any theories?
- Well, frankly l have several.

430
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,950
Here we go.
Let's just order a pizza.

431
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,718
Scott, you're not helping.

432
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,231
l was listening to a tape series
on child development last night.

433
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,473
You know what the problem is?
Excuse me, Neil.

434
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,755
lt's four weeks until Christmas.

435
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,315
- That's a holiday in December.
- Oh.

436
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,916
Have you noticed the hallways?
Not a decoration, not a twinkle light,

437
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,999
not an expression of the joy
kids are supposed to be feeling.

438
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,312
- What kind of school is this?
- A public school.

439
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,036
A top-rated public school.
That takes effort. And money.

440
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,238
Spending any of that money
on holiday decorations

441
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,635
would take away from
the things that truly matter.

442
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,320
Forgive me, but l think
holiday cheer really matters.

443
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,476
What are we going to do?
We are worried...

444
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,070
Let me handle this. You know
what you did is wrong. Right?

445
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,918
- l guess so.
- There's no guessing.

446
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,235
Guessing is gone.
lt was wrong what you did.

447
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,033
And you're not gonna
do it again. Promise me.

448
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,639
- OK.
- There you go.

449
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,588
He won't do it again.
Meeting is adjourned.

450
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,995
lt most certainly is not!
Charlie...

451
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,236
You know what else?
Here's a little donation.

452
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,954
Why don't you
buy yourself a wreath?

453
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,993
l am Santa Claus.

454
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,075
Boo!

455
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,068
Yeah. No, no,
l think that this is gonna work.

456
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,350
Good... Good job, Curtis.

457
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,192
Would it kill you to give
a wholehearted compliment?

458
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,275
Ho, ho, ho.

459
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,832
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Santa?

460
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,432
- l need you to look at this.
- All right!

461
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,679
Nice!

462
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,438
No. l mean,
l need you to read it.

463
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,233
Well, let's try to be
specific, shall we?

464
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,315
Ha-ha!

465
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,035
l'll take a look at it
over at my desk.

466
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,879
- How does he know where it is?
- l programmed him that way.

467
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,116
He has most of Santa's memories.

468
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,469
OK, we need you to study
everything that's in that book

469
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,995
because it is the key
to being Santa.

470
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,152
Right! l'll memorise
everything in the book.

471
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,714
l'll follow all the rules.

472
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,478
Cos rules are very important!

473
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,350
- l like this guy.
- l can barely read this.

474
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,435
Hi, Santa.

475
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,835
Uh...

476
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,033
- Hi.
- Oh. You look...

477
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,799
Like he got
a good night's sleep.

478
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,194
Like you got a very
good night's sleep.

479
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,872
How about a nice
chocolatey cocoa?

480
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,518
- Careful, it's hot.
- Of course it is.

481
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,434
Aagh!

482
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,635
Whoo!

483
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,990
That's delicious! l like cocoa!

484
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,879
Cocoa's superior refreshment!
[laughs]

485
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,036
Get me some more cocoa!

486
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,156
Whoo!

487
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,508
Right away, Santa.

488
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,755
Ho, whoa!

489
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,234
l think Santa feels
a little buzz!

490
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,955
Whoooo!

491
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,639
Let me get this straight.
You were de-Santified?

492
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,309
And you only have 27 days
to find a wife or you're out?

493
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,673
Yeah.

494
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,109
What are you gonna do?
We dated for three years

495
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,356
before you got up
the courage to propose.

496
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,597
That's a pretty serious
commitment issue, isn't it?

497
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,393
Yes, Sigmund. l was afraid
l'd mess up the first time.

498
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,750
- l'm more afraid now.
- Dad, you can't give up.

499
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,757
There's never been
a better Santa.

500
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,598
l appreciate that.

501
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,154
lt's for the best. lf l
had spent more time with you,

502
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,669
you'd spend less time in
the spray paint industry.

503
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,189
Don't do that to yourself.
You have been a great dad.

504
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,880
And being Santa has made you
an even better man.

505
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,036
l'm gonna go out
on an emotional limb.

506
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,912
Don't try to make me cry.

507
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,510
Believe it or not, you have
a great capacity for love.

508
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,557
l know you can
find someone wonderful

509
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,591
to spend the rest of
your life with.

510
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,076
Don't let the facts that you
have no time, no prospects

511
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,112
and a paralysing fear of
intimacy get you down.

512
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,195
Hm.

513
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,751
Have you ever
helped anyone? Ever?

514
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,077
You know what l'm gonna do? l am
gonna look through my phone book

515
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,714
and see who's still single out
there and not too bitter.

516
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,037
There's divorced moms at school
who'll go out with anybody.

517
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,516
As promising as this sounds,
l don't need help with this area.

518
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,916
Your old man was a high-school
legend. A double letterman.

519
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,678
l had a Mustang.

520
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,552
So as far as dating goes,

521
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,389
l think if anybody can stir up
the old mojo it would be moi.

522
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,234
Come on! l don't think
there's a woman out there

523
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,316
that doesn't want
a piece of this.

524
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,352
- Hi, Mom!
- Lucy!

525
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,713
- Uncle Scott!
- How's my little sweet pea?

526
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,437
Ohh! l haven't seen you in a long time.

527
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,996
- Tell me what's been happenin'.
- l learned to swim underwater.

528
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,634
- And l'm not afraid!
- That's amazing!

529
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,751
Maybe we'll have to go to the mall
and... get some ice cream.

530
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,993
- Plenty of women at the mall.
- Charlie...!

531
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,312
Santa, look forward and
put on a smiley face.

532
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,716
- Say hello to your elves.
- Ho, ho, ho!

533
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,195
You're doing a wonderful job!

534
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,556
Santa, when you said the bigger
wheels, is this what you meant?

535
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,635
Ho, ho, ho!

536
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,716
You're doing a wonderful job!

537
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,120
You're doing great.
Dial it down on the ho-ho-ho's,

538
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,037
but otherwise you're gold.

539
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,235
Ho, ho ho!

540
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,630
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

541
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,795
Why don't you just say it? ''You
were right, Curtis. l was wrong.''

542
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,069
OK, OK, l admit it.

543
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,710
They're happy.
They're working hard.

544
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,717
Everything's going to be fine.

545
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,717
This book is very
interesting reading.

546
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,434
There's a lot of rules
they're not following.

547
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,551
That's what l've been
saying all along.

548
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,831
Things have gotten
a little too sloppy around here.

549
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,112
Yes! Sloppiness means mistakes.
Mistakes aren't a good thing!

550
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,076
l might have to
make some changes here.

551
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,953
- What do you have in mind?
- Let me show you.

552
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,270
There's many things.
Look here...

553
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,837
Neil, are you sure you don't have
any other clothes l can borrow?

554
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,110
l mean, the idea tonight
is to attract a woman.

555
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,277
- What are you talking about?
- l look like a limesicle.

556
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,277
l think it makes you look hot.

557
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,148
What do you think, Laura?
Honestly, what do you think?

558
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,077
Doesn't he look hot, Laura?

559
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,078
l think it's what's inside
that really counts.

560
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,555
- Thought you liked the sweater.
- We'll talk later.

561
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,398
l'm off.
l may need to borrow a car.

562
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,956
l'm parked behind Neil. The
minivan - l just had it washed.

563
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,518
The minivan.

564
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,517
OK, then. Well, wish me luck.

565
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,072
l got a needlepoint sweater,
and a minivan...

566
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,716
See ya in about eight minutes.

567
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,638
Scott? Hey.

568
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,069
- Tracy!
- Yes!

569
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,873
- lt's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

570
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,954
- Here, why don't you sit down?
- Oh, thank you.

571
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,036
Thank you very much.

572
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,831
So, l'm so glad
we finally got to do this.

573
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,235
- l'm pretty nervous.
- Oh, are you?

574
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,352
Laura says
we have a lot in common.

575
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,596
l hear that you love
this time of year also?

576
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,280
lt's my favourite time of year
and my busiest time of year.

577
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,789
- Whoa, look at the sweater!
- Yeah!

578
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,196
Some sweater.
Like l should talk!

579
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,315
l also have my Christmas
charm bracelet.

580
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,149
- That's beautiful. Look at 'em!
- Yeah.

581
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,635
l wear it all year long
just to keep the spirit alive.

582
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,550
That's gorgeous. A little teddy bear
and packages. That's very nice.

583
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,712
- So what work do you do?
- l'm in the toy business.

584
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,796
- No way!
- Way!

585
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,634
- That sounds so creative.
- l love it.

586
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,876
- l love creative people.
- Yeah?

587
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,713
Yeah.

588
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,439
So what do you do?

589
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,358
l'm hoping someday to break
into the music business.

590
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,357
- As a singer-songwriter.
- No way!

591
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,833
Way!

592
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,108
- What's your favourite music?
- Country-western.

593
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,878
- [enthusiastically] Ohh!
- Yeah.

594
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,195
- Do you like Shania Twain?
- Yeah!

595
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,993
* The best thing about
singing at Christmas

596

* ls the cocoa,
carolling and fun

597

598
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,192

Whew!

You hated it?

616
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,675
lt kind of scared me
a little bit.

617

for a performance, so if l...

00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,190
l put myself out and that was
not an easy thing to do.

620
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,630
lf you can't support
a woman's ambition,

621
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,718
then l don't think there's any
reason to continue this date.

- Hey, sport.

How'd it go?

Well...

Let's just say
l'm not bookin' a church yet.

627

Boy, l'll tell ya,
women are hard to figure out.

628
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,392
- Tell me about it.
- You too, huh? Girl trouble?

629
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,837
Well, there's this one girl.

630
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,719
We just used to be friends and
hang out at the mall and stuff.

631
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,558
Then one day l looked at her

632
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,194
and l got this weird feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

633
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,515
l started worrying about
what to wear

634
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,676
and what my hair
looked like...

635
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,476
And then l wanted to kiss her.

636

How did she do that?

But they all can do that.

638

Oh, look at that.

Uh-huh.

642
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,833
Now, all you have to do
is yell down the hall.

643
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,030
And l'm there
whenever you need me.

644

Hey, Lucy,

Uncle Scott,
are you Santa Claus?

661
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,915
What? Why would you ask me
something like that?

662
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,634
Cos you have a reindeer,
and only Santa has reindeer.

663
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,035
Nonsense.
A lot of people have reindeer.

664
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,116
Name five.

665
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,557
Well... most of them
live in Finland.

666
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,956
l can't pronounce their names.

667
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,670
Besides, reindeer are too stupid
to make good pets.

668
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,832
Well, l think you're very smart.

669

Well, l think he's learning
at an excellent rate.

Oh, really? This morning
he ate a bowl of waxed fruit.

naughty-and-nice list.

No.

674

lt says l'm supposed to
check it twice.

675

- No, l didn't.

- l check the list twice.

That's the rule.

- You know how l feel.
- You're misunderstanding.

681

No, l'm the rule-maker. l like
the rules. Santa likes rules.

682

How about we have some fun?

683
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,875
Huh?

- lt's good to have fun.
- Right.

Santa, look over there.
See those elves?

686
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,000
Go ahead.
Go play some tinsel football.

687
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,473
Break!

688
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,755
- What's the object of tinsel football?
- Come on down.

gonna do? Who's gonna stop me?

695
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,074
Come on!

696
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,509
This is a lot of fun!

this as you, but isn't there

takin' him out of school?

- We could...

718

That's not a bad idea.

l want everything
off of there by tonight.

off every locker in this hallway.

- Do as she says, Charlie.

tests to study for.

727

Not my problem. l have a
detention group on Saturday.

728
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,030
So we will all get together
at the rec centre

729
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,151
and scrape off graffiti at 8am.

730

We'll talk about the suspension.

lt's been checked. Don't worry.

There's a lot of mistakes.

named Sven Halstrom right here.

He's a Dane. He was wiping
his nose on his sister's shirt.

742
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,993
Yuk! That's not very nice!
And yet he's on the nice list.

743
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,317
We try to cut most children
slack this time of year.

744
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,353
l don't understand that!
Kids are misbehaving everywhere.

745

They're sticky.

''Brush your teeth!''
''Pick up those clothes!''

But they're just kids!
Everybody misbehaves some time.

But according to
The Santa Handbook,

751
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,111
naughty kids get lumps of coal
in their stockings. Right?

752
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,231
We will make stockings.

753
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,239
ln my opinion, they should all
get coal in their stockings.

- Don't you?
- No! That's not how it works!

772
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,438
- Dad, it doesn't come off.
- lt's not supposed to come off.

773
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,755
Hence you've got to be
careful where you put it.

774
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,350
Hence tagging is serious.
Hence your presence here.

775
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,872
Don't say ''hence'' any more, Dad.
lt's really annoying.

00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,835
[school bell]

777
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,238
Nicely done!

778
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,558
How do you do it? l have trouble
with one. You have hundreds.

779
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,756
- Hi.
- Hi.

780
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,709
- l was really good this year.
- [chuckles]

781
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,628
ls that so? Are you absolutely
sure about that, Pamela?

782
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,513
l want a doll house
and a swimming pool.

783
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,632
A swimming pool?

784
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,830
l'm sorry. She insisted
on talking to you.

785
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,315
- lt's not a problem.
- OK.

786
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,076
l'll tell you what. lf you can
promise me you'll be good,

787
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,509
l can guarantee
you'll have a great Christmas.

788
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,200
- OK! Yeah!
- [mother laughs] Come on.

789
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,070
Kids get so nutty
this time of year.

790
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,040
- ls she a neighbour?
- No.

791
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,991
Oh. How did you know her name?

792
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,190
Oh, the... necklace,
it said Pamela on it.

793
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,869
Oh, l guess l missed that. l'm
gonna go check on this group.

794
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,396
You cost me, Pamela.

795
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,837
l just couldn't sleep
thinking about all those rules.

796
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,394
Am l wrong? Am l right?
Does it matter?

797
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,279
Couldn't have been the three
gallons of cocoa l had!

798
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,029
But you understand rules, don't
you? You're highly decorated.

799
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,435
And look at that face.
There you go.

800
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,870
There's a face
only a mom would like.

801
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,958
l don't have a mom,
so l wouldn't know about that.

802
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,196
Now, it's time
for the big event.

803
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,152
Guess what?

804
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,716
Son, it's show time!

805
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,595
You're in the spotlight.
Get bigger with it.

806
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,439
lt's your big chance.
l need a little help.

807
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,472
l need a little muscle.
l need a little nudge.

808
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,910
Let's call yourself
the little nudge!

809
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,794
This won't hurt - except for the
electric shock through you.

810
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,478
See ya on the other side!

811
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,990
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi. Uh...

812
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,192
lt looks like you're going out.

813
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,914
- Sorry. l should have called.
- No, it's OK. Come in.

814
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,598
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

815
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,469
- ls there a problem?
- No, no. l just...

816
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,431
l wondered if, um...

817
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,077
lf you would... [stammers]

818
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,520
Do you want to go
get some noodles?

819
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,032
Or pie?

820
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,435
But l don't want to
keep you from your date, so...

821
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,632
Oh, it's not a date. lt's the
faculty Christmas party.

822
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,794
ls that your idea of
a night on the town?

823
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,957
Noodles and pie? [giggles]

824
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,953
- Yes. What would be your idea?
- Pizza and a movie.

825
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,638
- Thick or thin crust?
- Thin.

826
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,318
Good! Movie?

827
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,068
Two For The Road.
Audrey Hepburn, Albert Finney.

828
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,192
Movie's OK, but the car
was the star. '53 MGTD.

829
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,630
Racing green, wire wheels...
Beautiful.

830
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,911
l'm impressed. That is
a great car. My favourite car.

831
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,837
Didn't like driving 'em
in the rain.

832
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,276
You have to push it to start it.
Other than that it's perfect.

833
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,956
lt's perfect, though.

834
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,633
- l could drive you to your party.
- That would be great.

835
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,991
Except for, eventually,
l'm going to have to get home.

836
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,112
Well, l... l could pick you up.

837
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,710
So you're going to drop me off,
then come back and pick me up?

838
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,592
- Yeah.
- Why don't you just stay?

839
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,393
- All right, l'll stay.
- l'll get my coat.

840
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,434
So, Mr Andretti,
what are you driving?

841
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,512
You know...
l think you're gonna like it.

842
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,798
[laughs]

843

[clop of hooves]

844
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,517
Mind if l ask you
something personal?

845
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,073
Please.

846
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,668
- You look really different.
- The weight.

847
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,554
lt's lndian teas and it's a lot
of salves and stuff. lt's...

848
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,716
- Do you want some cocoa?
- Uh, yes.

849
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,709
Cocoa.
You have thought of everything.

850
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,991
Well, this time of year,
l... l really shine.

851
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,590
Yeah, l can't wait
till it's over, though.

852
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,836
Streets are crowded,
the malls are jammed,

853
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,872
people max out their credit cards...
lt's noisy.

854
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,958
When did you become
such a cynic?

855
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,469
Oh. l don't know.

856
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,516
l used to love Christmas, too.

857
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,831
lt was the only day
that my parents didn't fight.

858
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,195
- Oh.
- Oh.

859
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,356
They were at each other
all the time.

860
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,155
But on Christmas, they tried
to make the holiday special.

861
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,716
My dad went through this charade
so l'd believe in Santa Claus.

862
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,276
He put a cot by the fireplace
so Santa could take a nap...

863
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,197
Like he has time to take a nap!

864
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,596
Consider the amount of gifts
he would have to... deliver.

865
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,393
Why would he nap? He
would probably need some coffee.

866
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,796
Yeah. And there was
cocoa and cookies.

867
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,516
And carrots for the reindeer.

868
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,508
That's a good gesture.
The reindeer love carrots.

869
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,790
And the thought is
important to them, too.

870
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,596
Yeah. And l'd wake up and the cocoa
and cookies would be gone

871
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,951
and the cot would be mussed
and the carrots gnawed.

872
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,629
They swallow them. lf they're
fresh they'll eat 'em like that.

873
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,716
They love red bell peppers, too.

874
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,717
You know the stories.
lf you read...

875
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,269
And there would be incredible
presents under the tree.

876
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,030
One year was a rocking horse,
and l named it Harvey.

877
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,068
And the next year was
a little red wagon,

878
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,919
which l made a lemonade stand,
which was great.

879
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,678
And the last year was...

880
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,117
lt was just... a Baby Doll. She was
pink and soft and beautiful.

881
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,949
- Beautiful?
- Yes.

882
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,354
l believed in Santa so much
l'd get in fights at school

883
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,869
with kids who tried to tell me
that he didn't exist.

884
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,673
And one day
l came home with a bloody nose.

885
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,992
That's when my parents
decided to tell me to...

886
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,997
grow up.

887
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,191
l was devastated, and...

888
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,110
Good, Carol! This is great
sleigh-riding conversation!

889
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,915
- l'm a terrible sleigh con-..
- lt's fine conversation.

890
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,350
A person just wants something
to believe in, you know?

891
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,835
Yes, l know. Yes, l know.

892
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,157
OK, we have cocoa.

893
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,714
We have a blanket.
We have a horse-drawn sleigh.

894
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,558
The only thing that's...

895
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,793
- What?
- [laughs]

896
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,399
- lt's snowing.
- Oh.

897
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,353
As if by magic?

898
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,392
That's what l was gonna say,
that it should be snowing!

Your attention, please!

00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:29,636
There we go. Hi. l'm Scott Calvin and
l just thought l'd step up here and...

916
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,150
and say the word that we've all
been longing to hear.

Fire!

918
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,591
OK. What l think, folks, is
that a lot of you have forgotten

what the true spirit
of Christmas is all about.

Mm?

lf you're not willing
to dance or laugh or flirt

or risk the buffet, l don't
think we have much choice.

923
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,717

here l say we rock this house

00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,232
Carol - happy, happy Christmas!

926
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,830
l think they're just
decorations for the carollers.

927
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,958
She's afraid these are
decorations for the carolling.

928
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,799
l think Carol is right
about the carolling!

929
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,310
l'm talking about the packages
that [whispers] are backstage.

930
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,510
There aren't any
packages backstage.

931
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,596
Ohh! There's none back there.

932
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,395
[sighs] So l was mistaken
when l saw this bag of gifts.

933
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,478
Maybe l'm wrong, but it sure
looks like a bag of gifts.

934
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,636
Ohh! lt's heavy
like a bag of gifts.

935
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,908
Look at this! What's in here?

936
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,756
lt's very heavy, very heavy.

937
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,238
John Pierce.

938
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,796
Doesn't your mom call you JJ?

939
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,076
Merry Christmas, JJ.

940
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,436
No way.

941
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,879
This is Toss Across!

942
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,671
l used to love this
when l was a kid!

943
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,518
But l never told anybody.

944
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,070
Where did...? Who did this?

945
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,679
Grace Kim.

946
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,111
Yes, there you are!
Merry Christmas.

947
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,798

949
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,274

This is incredible!

The Holly Hobbie Oven!

954
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,633
Come on up and get
the rest of your presents.

955

956
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,552
There she is. Katie. Jerry.

No, l mean
the secret Santa thing.

965
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,518
Someone tracked down all those
wonderful antique toys.

966
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,870
Probably someone who knows
his way around eBay.

- Yeah.
- Yep.

lt was you. l know it was you.

l just can't figure out...
How did you do it?

970
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,113
Sometimes you don't need
to know all the answers.

971

Speaking of which...

Merry Christmas.

- Did you investigate us?
- No, l wouldn't do that.

981
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,349
Did you...? l told you about
Baby Doll an hour ago, and...

982
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,398
Did you send someone to...?

- No.
- No.

Well... l don't know
how you did it.

lt's like some kind of magic.

986
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,630
Yeah, sort of like
some kind of magic.

987

And... and pretty much
the last that l have.

What? Well, what...?
You know what?

l don't want to know.

What you did in there tonight
for everyone was wonderful.

Thank you.

That's nice. l have a little

Milk wouldn't do it,
cocoa is a little sweet,

01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,712
so l decided to make
an army of toy soldiers.

They don't have
a good sense of humour like me.

- Shut up.

There are things about me you
should know. Personal things.

1051

We don't need to
rush things, Scott.

know these things.

Um...

1055

Remember the mistletoe,
how it just showed up?

1056
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,872
- Yes.
- And the sleigh.

1057
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,877
- How magical that was?
- Yes.

- l work a long way from home.

1064
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,595
When l get back home,
l sleep for a long time.

1065
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,280
See? OK.
lt's not so bad so far.

1066
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,948
You work far away from home
and you sleep a lot.

1067
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,470
You've never been to prison
and you don't wear socks with sandals.

1068
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,715
Well...

l'm Santa Claus.

What?

1071
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,590
The suit, the red suit's real.
The North Pole is a place.

1072
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:35,077
There are elves. They make toys.
They're beautiful and it's real.

1073
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,992
- l exist.
- That's not funny.

- lt's magical.
- Cut it out.

l'm telling the truth.

1076
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,270
l told you something personal
from my childhood

1077
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,949
and now you're making a joke
out of it and it's not funny. lt hurts.

1078
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:50,790
l know how hard this is to
believe, but connect the dots.

1079
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,434
- Think what's happened.
- l know what's going on.

1080
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,597
- Think about the little girl.
- You felt something for me.

1081
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,757
Now you're acting like a mental
patient because you're scared.

1082
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:03,316
- l deliver gifts in a sleigh.
- lncredible.

1083
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,716
l go down chimneys with burning
logs and l still deliver gifts.

1084
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,751
l'm not scared.
That's not what this is.

1085
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,110
lf you're trying to
push me away, it's working.

1086
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,958
Carol, don't make me leave.

1087
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,396
Please.

1088
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,911
- How could you pick her?
- l didn't.

1089
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,359
You don't care any more.

1090
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,516
l care more about you
than anybody.

1091
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,358
But it's a two-way street.

1092
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,871
- You won't confide in me.
- You want it? Here it is.

1093
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,914
- What? Talk to me.
- l don't live a normal life.

1094
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,474
- You live a great life here.
- Just listen to me!

1095
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,398
My friends get to go around
saying, ''My dad's a plumber.''

1096
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:05,398
''My dad's a pilot.'' ''My dad's
a dentist.'' You know what?

1097
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,910
My dad is the best thing of all
and l can't tell anyone.

1098
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,759
You have no idea how hard it is,
walking around with that secret.

1099
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,952
And now you're going out
with Principal Newman!

1100
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,196
And you don't even
tell me about it.

1101
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,551
My whole life has become
about secrets, and l hate it!

1102
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,636
l'm sorry.

1103
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,795
Forget about
Principal Newman, all right?

1104
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,911
And forget about Santa.
l'm done.

1105
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,112
My time's up.

1106
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,915
Who cares any more?

1107
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,355
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Lucy.

1108
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,075
- What are you doing?
- Just shovelling.

1109
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,155
Oh.

1110
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,034
Charlie, is Uncle Scott
Santa Claus?

1111
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,552
No.
Why would you think that?

1112
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,511
l don't know.

1113
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,594
- How come Uncle Scott was sad?
- What makes you think that?

1114
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,631
l asked him to stick
a straw in his nose

1115
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,591
and blow bubbles
in his milk.

1116
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,995
- And he said no.
- Whatever.

1117
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,593
- Can you talk to him?
- l don't think so, Lucy.

1118
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,756
- Did you have a fight?
- Sort of.

1119
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,632
- Are you gonna make up?
- l don't know!

1120
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,751
- Are you gonna be mad forever?
- Lucy!

1121
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,950
- What?
- These are hard questions.

1122
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,718
No, they're not. They're easy.

1123
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,195
And you can't be mad
at him forever, Charlie.

1124
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,356
He's your daddy
and you love him.

1125
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,119
* ln a strip-mining machine

1126
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,719
* Flatten the hills we go

1127
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,479
Come on!

1128
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,194
Put a smile on that face,
little troll!

1129
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,273
Wait a minute. l got a joke.
This'll cheer you up.

1130
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,038
- Knock, knock!
- Who's there?

1131
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,115
[laughs]

1132
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,558
- Aren't you?
- Aren't you who?

1133
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,750
Aren't you supposed to
get back to work?!

1134
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,633
All of ya! You little idiots!
Back to work!

1135
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,476
Got any twos?

1136
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,993
Hm.

1137
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,196
Go fish.

1138
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,433
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1139
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,796
Whooaahh!

1140
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,756
- What was that?
- l don't know.

1141
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,751
- Want some more hot chocolate?
- Mm-hm.

1142
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,233
OK.

1143

[door bell]

1144
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,669
- Would you get that, honey?
- Yeah, sure.

- Who are you?
- Uh...

1147
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,796
Curtis, a friend from...
Buffalo.

1148
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,516
- Are you an elf?
- Of course not!

1149
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,751
Why would you ask
such a silly question?

1150
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,632
How come you have pointy ears?

1151
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,556
lt's... because l never
ate my green vegetables.

1152
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,512
Do you eat
your green vegetables?

1153
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,031
Uncle Scott!

1154
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,675
Yeah, l'm right here.
What's wrong?

1155
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,276
Oh... Curtis! What are you doin' here?

1156
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,356
There's a little
trouble at the...

1157
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,913
plant.

1158
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,592
lt's OK.
Curtis is a very old friend.

1159
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:19,359
We have a large, uh... firm.
We work together in...

We work together in Buffalo.
So... we're gonna talk business.

1162
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,552
- What business?
- lt's none of your business.

1163
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,638
Soon l'm gonna be seven.
And then l can know things.

1164

- What's up?
- Toy Santa's out of control.

1167
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,548
He's locked up the elves,
shut down the workshop,

1168
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,752
he thinks everybody's naughty
and he's gonna give everyone coal!

1169
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,633
- Why didn't Bernard tell me?
- He's under house arrest.

1170
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,749
Bernard?!

1171
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,917
Fly back with me to the North
Pole to save Christmas!

01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,072
Who did?

1186
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,278
A squirrel?!

1187
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,353
Get this. You gotta fly both

What? The old toaster trick?

1211
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,390
When we were kids we used to do
this to get a little extra cash.

Should l put it
under my pillow?

Yes!

1224

By cuspids!

1225

Shhh.

lt's a Tooth Fairy ambush.

What do you people want?
l only carry $20 in change.

1229
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,597
Tooth Fairy, it's me, Santa.

1230
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,830
l've lost the weight
and the beard, but it's me.

1231
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,758

And you, sir, are no Santa.

1232

l am too.

1233
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:25,749
How did l know l could capture
you by holdin' on to a wing?

1234
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:28,838
You wanted to change your name
to Captain Floss or Plaque Man.

1235
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,518
Or, as l recall, Roy.

1236
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,712
And it was Santa's idea
to call you the Molarnator.

1237
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,558
- Who's the kid?
- One of my elves. He's an elf.

1238
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,235
Ow.

1239
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,718
Santa!

1240
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,558
The Molarnator at your service!

1241
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:50,315
- A little altitude, please!
- What?

1242
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,989
Could you possibly
fly a little higher?

1243
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,075
Oof!

1244
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,357
- What?
- Never mind!

1245
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,432
Principal Newman?

1246
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,271
What is it, Charlie?

1247
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:14,596
You keep asking me if there's
something bothering me.

1248
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,676
Well, there is. l...

1249
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,669
l couldn't talk
about it before, but...

1250
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,910
l want to talk about it now.

1251
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,551
OK. Go ahead.

1252
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,192
- My dad is Santa.
- Oh, please. Not you too.

1253
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,878
Hold on.

1254
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,118
lf you have no feelings
for my dad, then fine.

1255
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,470
But if the only reason
for not being with him is

1256
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,512
that you don't believe in him,
you're making a big mistake.

1257
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,073
Oh, Charlie...

1258
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,878
Here.

1259
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:48,518
l want you to take this.
Look into this and...

1260
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,439
try to remember what it was like
when you were little

1261
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,949
and you still
believed in Christmas.

1262
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,512
Seeing isn't believing.
Believing is seeing.

1263
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,150
You haven't seen anything yet!

1264
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,837
- Curtis?
- What? [thump] Ow!

1265
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,838
- What do l do?
- Slow down.

1266
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:33,915
OK.

1267
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,350
Piece of cake. Attaboy.
There you go.

1268
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,118
Why can't you fly higher?

1269
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,032
Tooth Fairy, l want to thank
you. l'll never forget this.

1270
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,832
l wish l could do more,
but l gotta go.

1271
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,190
Denver just started
a new pee-wee hockey league.

1272
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,356
Before you go,
l want you to know that nobody,

1273
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,948
nobody was
braver than you were today.

1274
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,275
You should be
proud of your wings.

1275
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,831
- They're not too girly?
- Not on you.

1276
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,108
[chuckles]

1277
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,189
Wouldn't it be easier
to go through the workshop?

1278
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,278
No. That way Santa and his
soldiers would be expecting us.

1279
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,710
Sound military strategy involves
taking your enemy by surprise.

1280
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,796
lt's good strategy.

1281
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,878
Sometimes being a despot
is a tough business.

1282
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:21,955
[laughs]

1283
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,515
Come on.

1284
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,516
[hums]

1285
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,871
lt's Scott, isn't it?

1286
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,071
Yeah. What are you
supposed to be?

1287
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,431
A better, stronger version
of what you used to be -

1288
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,076
with a flawless complexion,
l might add.

1289
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,556
- Look, it just glistens.
- Listen to me. l'm back now.

1290
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:45,672
So untie us. Let the elves go
and give me back the coat.

1291
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,278
[mumbles]

1292
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,156
No can do! lt's Christmas Eve!
l have coal to deliver!

1293
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,919
And l don't want those
naughty kids to suffer! [laughs]

1294
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,600
Boys! One, two, three!

1295
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,271
And... one, two!

1296
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,675
Try to keep up!
Let's go. Move it on!

1297
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,476
Try to...
This is just too tight.

1298
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,075
[sighs]

1299
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,317
This is all my fault.

1300
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,869
l thought l could
create another Santa.

1301
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,992
My elfin pride
blinded me to all reason.

1302
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,076
There's only one Santa.

1303
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,397
Well, l've done
a pretty rotten job.

1304
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,192
l didn't check the list twice.

1305
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,675
My kid thinks l betrayed him.

1306
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,672
l hurt the woman l love.

1307
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,796
l ruined Christmas.

1308
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,515
Charlie!

1309
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,076
How'd you get up here?

1310
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:51,675
Scott!

1311
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,395
l got to fly in
with the Tooth Fairy.

1312
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,551
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1313
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,478
Brush between meals
and don't forget the floss.

1314
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,034
And if anybody cares,
l'm exhausted.

1315
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,995
And she...
has a beautiful smile.

1316
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,274
- Thank you for everything.
- No. Thank you.

1317
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,590
l am... [laughs] the Molarnator!

1318
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,275
Whoo!

1319
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:19,799
Come on!

1320
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,518
Hyah!

1321
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,796
[whistles]

1322
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,392
Get out of the way!

1323
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:53,994
What are you doing?

1324
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,793
- You gotta save Christmas.
- How am supposed to save...?

1325
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,315
[crash]

1326
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,315
- No, no, no.
- Please. Don't worry.

1327
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,712
[elves] Whoa!

1328
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,792
Slow down.

1329
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,433
Stay.

1330
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:14,629
[elves] Whoah!

1331
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,551
[Chet] Oh, Chet...

1332
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,715
Ouch! Ow! Oh, oh, oh!

1333
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,556
Thanks. Excuse me, pork chop.

1334
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,752
OK. Chet, this is it.
You ready to rock and roll?

1335
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,874
- Chet?
- Yeah. He's still in training.

1336
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:34,635
- Has he had much flight time?
- About a minute and a half.

1337
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:37,194
- He's had a lot of crash time!
- Curtis...!

1338
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,880
- He's just a baby.
- All right.

1339
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,996
Let's see what this baby can do.

1340
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,759
- [Chet hums]
- Oh, boy.

1341
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,674
Ready to go, buddy?
You know what we gotta do.

1342
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,358
Hyah!

1343
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:54,315
Chet! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Chet, Chet.

[Chet cackles wildly]

1345
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:00,151
You gotta focus, Chet.

1346
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,831
OK, everybody! Outside, now!

1347
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,596
Almost there, boys. Let's go!

1348
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,309

[cheering]

1351
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,796
Snowballs, on three!

OK, elves...

Let's get 'em!

01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,719
Whoa, whoa! Not so far!

- Whoa, Chet!
- Whooh!

Back for more action,
eh, scooter?

1360
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,958

[Chet babbles]

1362
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,478
Cut the chitchat, Chet!

1363
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,831
Why is this such a problem?
Come on!

1364
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:31,951
Where do you think you're going?

1365
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,878
- Go, go!
- Hyah, boy! Come on!

Faster!

The lead.
The one in the front, Chet!

1368
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,995
Leave my reindeer alone!

Come on! We got to get them
before they get out the hole.

What are you doin' up there?
l can't see where l'm driving.

You are a sad,
strange little man.

Whoa!

You're gonna fall... l hope!

That's a good way
to lose an eye!

Look out! You're scaring me!

1381

Can l help you?

1382
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,756

Hey, l'm supposed to wear this
coat! How about a little elbow?

1387
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,354
There you are.
That's gotta feel good.

1388
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:02,038
You want the shoe?
Take it off. Go ahead. Go on!

Uh?

What are we gonna do now,
smartypants?

1391

Watch out!
The building! Left, left!

1392

Oh, well.
The town'll break the fall.

1393
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,673
Look out!

1394
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,557
Yo, Tony! Hey, Brian, stop me!

1395
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:35,909
Oof!

1396
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:41,197
Get off of me! Now remember,
rules are very, very important!

1398
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:46,716
[Scott] Hey, guys, back up. l've
got a special place for him.

1399
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,715
You idiot! Wait a minute,
something's shocking me.

1400
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,751
- You were great.
- Sounds like you were too.

1401
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,871
- We've got ten minutes.
- Where is Carol?

1402
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,799
- Carol! Are you all right?
- Yes!

1403
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,037
- Where are you going?
- l gotta deliver gifts.

1404
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,912
Aren't you forgetting something?

1405
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,917
- No.
- You gotta get married.

1406
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,996
Excuse me?

1407
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,033
Carol, l...

1408
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:17,475
l cannot continue being Santa...
unless l find a Mrs Claus.

1409
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,190
Oh. So that's what the whole
noodles and pie thing...

1410
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,880
- You just needed a wife.
- No.

1411
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,834
No?

1412
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,998
- Yes.
- Yes?

1413
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,597
Yes, l was looking for a wife.

1414
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,876
No, l didn't figure on
falling... in love.

1415
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,592
You love me?

1416
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:47,754
- This is all happening so fast.
- Well, there's no pressure.

1417
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,034
Good.

1418
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:53,232
l mean, if l don't get married
l just won't deliver the gifts

1419
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,272
and children everywhere
will stop believing,

1420
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:00,154
the elves will lose their jobs,
the North Pole will disappear

1421
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,236
and Christmas will be gone.

1422
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,998
- Get down on one knee.
- Hm?

1423
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,351
Do it. Now.

1424
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,116
Say ''Carol.''

1425
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,512
- Carol.
- Uh-huh?

1426
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,074
Yeah?

1427
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,873
You say this is happening
all so fast.

1428
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:27,354
You say this is happening
all so fast.

1429
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,755
But you've known me
your whole life.

1430
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,951
But you've known me
your whole life.

1431
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,196
When you were
little and alone...

1432
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,389
[Scott repeats]

1433
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:39,273
- [both] Santa...
- l can take it from here.

1434
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,231
..Santa was always
there for you.

1435
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,830
And l will be, as long as you
continue to believe in me.

1436
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,594
l know l'm asking you
to leave everything at home,

1437
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,154
but l can guarantee you
that this is worth it.

1438
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:51,838
This place...

1439
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,877
This place is all about magic

1440
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:58,274
and love... and wonder.

1441
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,994
And occasionally
a thin-crust pizza

1442
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,829
and a movie and
a long winter night.

1443
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,716
ls there a school here?

1444
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:14,074
Yeah, we have one, a school, but
the elves need a new principal.

1445
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:17,909
Cos as of late some of the elves
have been acting a bit impish.

1446
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:26,236
Carol...

1447
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,636
- l love you.
- You do?

1448
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,955
Would you be my wife?

1449
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,159
[whispers] l will.

1450
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,999
[whispers] Thank you.
l've got it from here.

1451
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,518
l will.

1452
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,478
By the powers vested in me
by me,

1453
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,358
l now pronounce you Santa

1454
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,799
and Mrs Claus.

1455
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,509
Well, go on now. Kiss her!

1456
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:12,835
Awwww!

1457
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,756
[gurgling]

1458
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,717
- Dad, we gotta go.
- Walk me to my sleigh.

1459
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,669
We gotta go! When we get back,
we start making some more toys.

1460
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:51,279
All right. Well, Mrs Claus,
you might want to get some rest.

1461
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:54,837
You see, tomorrow begins
vacation season for me,

1462
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,396
which means a three-month
honeymoon for us.

1463
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:03,596
Nothing tropical. You do not
want to see this in a Speedo.

1464
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,992
Don't be home too late.

1465
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:09,712
And so it begins.

1466
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:12,314
Boys, we've got
some toys to deliver!

1467

What, Charlie?

1470
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:42,439
Come downstairs.
l want you to see something.

1472

1473
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:13,358
Uncle Scott?!

1474
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,959
- Do you have any twos?
- Go fish!

1475
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:23,834
You are Santa!
l knew it was you all along.

1476
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,394
- And you were right.
- Uncle Scott...

1477
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,953
You look all rosy.
Are you feeling better?

1478
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,436
l'm feeling much, much better.

1479
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:35,074
ls there anything else
l should know about?

1480
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:39,113
l don't know. But Charlie has
something he wants to tell you.

1481
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,719
OK.

1482
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:46,711
You know, l was exactly your age
when l found out my dad was Santa.

1483
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:50,116
- But l couldn't tell anybody.
- l can't tell anybody either?

1484
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:53,073
No. But knowing it
isn't a burden.

1485
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,719
lt's a gift.

1486
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:00,277
Most kids stop believing in
Santa when they grow up.

1487
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,550
But l get to
believe in him forever.

1488
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:05,399
l love you, Charlie. Thank you.

1489
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,918
