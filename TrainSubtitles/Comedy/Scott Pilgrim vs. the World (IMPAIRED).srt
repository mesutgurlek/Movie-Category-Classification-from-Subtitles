164
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,690
Well, I knew
I personally rocked,

165
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:28,361
but I never suspected
that we rocked as a unit.

166
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:29,596
So, thank you, Knives.

167
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:31,935
I mean, you guys
are gonna be huge.

168
00:08:32,374 --> 00:08:33,773
Well, we're already
pretty big,

169
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:35,366
but, yeah, I guess
it'd be cool

170
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:37,673
if cool people started wearing
our T-shirt or whatever.

171
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:39,475
Cool.
Yeah, yeah.

172
00:08:39,548 --> 00:08:42,881
Excuse me, do you have anything
by The Clash at Demonhead?

173
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:46,387
Have you tried the section
marked "The Clash at Demonhead"?

174
00:08:46,454 --> 00:08:47,921
Thank you, Julie.

175
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:49,546
Are you coming
to my party Friday,

176
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:52,491
or will you be
busy babysitting?

177
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:55,256
Thank you, Julie.

178
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,888
You don't want
to listen to her.

179
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,765
And you definitely don't
want to listen to them.

180
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,529
Oh, I heart them so much.

181
00:09:01,603 --> 00:09:05,130
Yeah, I hearted them, too, until
they signed to a major label,

182
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:08,938
and the lead singer turned into a
total bitch and ruined my life forever.

183
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,534
But that's just me.

184
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:14,048
Envy Adams is so cool.
Do you read her blog?

185
00:09:14,115 --> 00:09:15,673
Sorry, you were
saying about me?

186
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,685
I mean, I've never gone
out with anyone so talented.

187
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,080
Go out with
a lot of guys?

188
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:21,144
No.

189
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:23,551
Yeah, so, whatever, man.

190
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,490
I've never even
kissed a guy.

191
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:30,525
Hey,

192
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,561
me, neither.

193
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:46,210
Here you go.

194
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,646
So, this is
your secret lair?

195
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:49,445
Yeah, yeah.
Can I come in?

196
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:52,511
My secret lair
is one of those

197
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:54,350
"No girls allowed"- type
deals.

198
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:55,681
Okay.

199
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:57,247
But do you wanna see the
house where I grew up?

200
00:09:57,325 --> 00:09:58,917
Sure!
Come on.

201
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:02,186
There you go.

202
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:04,995
Wow.

203
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:06,356
Yeah.

204
00:10:07,402 --> 00:10:08,699
Wow.

205
00:10:16,244 --> 00:10:17,711
Oh, God.

206
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:21,975
So alone.

207
00:10:23,652 --> 00:10:25,017
You're not alone.

208
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:26,515
What?

209
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:29,318
You're just having
some idiotic dream.

210
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:31,986
Does that mean
we can make out?

211
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,857
Oh, God!

212
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:34,952
What is it, Scott?

213
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,190
I had this
totally weird dream.

214
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:37,492
Oh, God.

215
00:10:37,565 --> 00:10:38,793
What is it,
Other Scott?

216
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:42,198
Can we skip the dream time?
Color me not interested.

217
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,532
But there was this girl.

218
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:44,934
Girl?

219
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:46,496
Was this
an Envy-related dream?

220
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:48,166
We don't use
the E-word in this house.

221
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:51,303
No, it wasn't her.
It was somebody new.

222
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:53,370
Yay for that.

223
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:54,642
Speaking of new,

224
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:56,616
weren't you supposed to take
your fake high-school girlfriend

225
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:58,277
to the library
a half-hour ago?

226
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,850
What? It's like 6:00
in the morning.

227
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:02,615
(SCREAMS)

228
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,050
MAN: Shh!

229
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:06,724
It's weird.

230
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:08,353
What's weird?

231
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,194
Libraries remind me
of grade school.

232
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:13,700
That must seem like
a really long time ago.

233
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:16,396
Yeah, let's talk
about something else.

234
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,987
Do you know that girl?

235
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,993
Scott!
What?

236
00:11:40,462 --> 00:11:42,862
You only played one note
for that entire song.

237
00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:44,957
My hand slipped.

238
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:46,762
Is your girlfriend
distracting you?

239
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:48,630
My girlfriend?

240
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:50,034
I'll be quieter.

241
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:52,400
Let's do that one again.

242
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,768
Sorry, what are we doing?

243
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:55,173
I told you, like, 50 times!

244
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:57,074
We're going
to this party, retard.

245
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:59,306
Party?
At Julie's.

246
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:00,405
I thought
you guys split up.

247
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:02,950
We did, but there might be some
label guys there, so, you know...

248
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:04,917
Oh, man, this is gonna suck. Suck!

249
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:07,147
At least it'll give us
something to complain about.

250
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:08,314
Oh, man!

251
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,516
This sucks!

252
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:10,683
Sucks!

253
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,785
I'm gonna go pee
due to boredom.

254
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:16,363
I have to pee.

255
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:18,023
You know, so I told him
you've got a really good sound,

256
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:19,566
and I think that you
should market your sound

257
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:22,125
to deaf people, because... Scott! Hey!

258
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:23,192
Hey, Comeau.

259
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:25,102
How about this party? You
getting your drink on here?

260
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:27,004
No, I don't drink.
This is just Coke Zero.

261
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:28,372
What do you mean,
you don't drink?

262
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:30,809
I distinctly remember you being very
drunk off a couple of G-and-T's...

263
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,244
Hey, Comeau,
you know everyone, right?

264
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:34,372
Yeah, pretty much, I do.

265
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:36,139
You know this one girl
with hair like this?

266
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:37,650
Yes, that's Ramona Flowers.

267
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:39,710
Somebody said she was gonna
be here tonight, actually.

268
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:41,085
What?
Oh, Scott.

269
00:12:41,156 --> 00:12:43,283
You have the hots for her or
something? I gotta tell you though,

270
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:44,791
I hear that she's
a little hardcore.

271
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:08,638
(ALL CHATTERING)

272
00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:27,831
Hey, what's up?

273
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:29,258
Nothing.

274
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:30,668
<i>Hey, you know Pac-Man?</i>

275
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:32,228
I know of him.

276
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:35,874
<i>Well, Pac-Man was
originally called Puck-Man.</i>

277
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:38,472
They changed it because...

278
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:40,673
Not because Pac-Man looks
like a hockey puck.

279
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:43,182
<i>"Paku-paku" means
"flap your mouth,"</i>

280
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:45,811
and that they were afraid
people would change...

281
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:49,687
Scratch out the "P" and
turn it into an "F," like...

282
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:51,823
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

283
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:53,554
Yeah, that's amazing.

284
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:55,117
Um...

285
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:57,491
Am I dreaming?

286
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:01,558
I'll leave you alone
forever now.

287
00:14:01,636 --> 00:14:02,694
Thanks.

288
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:11,235
Dude!
What?

289
00:14:11,312 --> 00:14:12,574
She's totally real!
Who?

290
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:14,205
Ramona Flowers.
What?

291
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:16,341
Dude! What do you know
about Ramona Flowers?

292
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,078
All I know is
that she is American.

293
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:19,210
American.

294
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:20,720
Why don't you go talk
to Sandra and Monique?

295
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:21,846
They know a lot more.

296
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:24,050
Lady-dudes. What do you
know about Ramona Flowers?

297
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,422
I heard she has
a boyfriend.

298
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:26,892
Yeah. Some guy
back in New York.

299
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:28,686
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What else?

300
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:31,197
I heard she kicks
all kinds of ass.

301
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:33,791
She's on another level.

302
00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:35,768
She has men
dying at her feet.

303
00:14:35,837 --> 00:14:38,465
She's got some
battle scars, dude.

304
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,063
What about Ramona Flowers?

305
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:41,130
You know her?
Tell me now.

306
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:42,198
She just moved here.

307
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:43,835
Got a job at Amazon.
Comes into my work.

308
00:14:43,912 --> 00:14:44,901
Does she really?

309
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:46,640
Didn't you say she just
broke up with someone?

310
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:47,772
Did she really?

311
00:14:47,849 --> 00:14:49,111
They had a huge fight,
or whatever.

312
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:50,172
Did they really?

313
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:52,651
Yes! But I didn't want Scott
to know that, Stephen.

314
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,688
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.

315
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:56,951
Scott, I forbid you
from hitting on Ramona,

316
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:59,152
even if you haven't had a
real girlfriend in over a year.

317
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:00,251
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

318
00:15:00,328 --> 00:15:03,456
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Scott's
mourning period is officially over.

319
00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:05,490
He's totally dating
a high-schooler.

320
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,535
Dating a high-schooler
is the mourning period.

321
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:08,762
She's got a point.

322
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:09,928
I thought
you guys broke up.

323
00:15:10,004 --> 00:15:12,768
I don't want you scaring off the

00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:28,505
Yeah, if that's cool.

483
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:31,850
If I say yes, will you sign
for your damn package?

484
00:21:33,387 --> 00:21:34,752
So, yeah, 8:00?

485
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:39,852
Why are you just
standing there?

486
00:21:40,094 --> 00:21:42,028
Dude, I'm totally
waiting on you.

487
00:21:42,096 --> 00:21:44,587
I'm sorry, I just assumed you
were too cool to be here on time.

488
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:46,496
Oh, you assumed wrong.

489
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:49,898
So, how did you
end up in Toronto?

490
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:51,302
Just needed
to escape, I guess.

Yeah.

492
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,467
I got this job here,
and Gideon had always said

493
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:57,033
Toronto was one of
the great cities, so...

494
00:21:57,111 --> 00:21:59,136
Is Gideon your boyfriend?

495
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,210
He's a friend.

496
00:22:03,284 --> 00:22:04,979
Was he your boyfriend?

497
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,514
Do you mind if I don't
get into that right now?

498
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:09,954
It's so not
interesting to me.

499
00:22:10,424 --> 00:22:12,790
So, what about you?
What do you do?

500
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,885
I'm in between jobs
at the moment.

501
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:17,054
Between what and what?

502
00:22:17,131 --> 00:22:22,228
Well, my last job was a
long story filled with sighs.

503
00:22:22,636 --> 00:22:24,433
I know plenty of those.

504
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:25,767
Is that why you
left New York?

505
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,432
Pretty much.

506
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:29,533
It was just time to head
somewhere a little more chilled.

507
00:22:30,077 --> 00:22:31,738
Well, it's certainly
chilled here.

508
00:22:31,812 --> 00:22:33,006
Yeah.

509
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,412
It's chilled, as in cold.

510
00:22:35,683 --> 00:22:36,945
Yeah.

511
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:42,413
This is ridiculous.
Isn't it, like, April?

512
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,582
I know.

513
00:22:43,657 --> 00:22:45,625
I can barely see you.

514
00:22:45,693 --> 00:22:48,389
This whole thing is
an unmitigated disaster.

515
00:22:48,462 --> 00:22:52,296
I think act of God is a pretty
decent excuse for a lousy date.

516
00:22:52,366 --> 00:22:54,231
So this is a date, eh?

517
00:22:54,368 --> 00:22:56,268
Did I say date?

518
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:58,261
Slip of the tongue.

519
00:22:58,339 --> 00:22:59,897

over here, somewhere.

Yeah, that's very warm.
What is that?

Okay.

Were you just gonna bring
the blanket from your bed?

I guess.

547
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:45,503
Maybe we should both get
under it, since we're so cold.

From what?

you, Pilgrim. Not right now.

my mind about the sex later.

Do you mind if we don't
get into it right now?

She wanted to move
to Montreal,

because she missed
her best friend.

Are you gay?

1237

Right. I'm not going
to let her toy with me.

From this moment on,

1245
00:58:18,757 --> 00:58:21,521
I will think of
Envy Adams no more!

1246

1247
00:58:24,196 --> 00:58:27,165
Is it news that we suck, because
I really don't think I can take it.

1248
00:58:27,232 --> 00:58:30,258
No. The Clash at Demonhead are
doing a secret show tomorrow night

1249
00:58:30,335 --> 00:58:32,428

your history aside

Can't we do our
own secret shows?

1257
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:45,677

are secret shows.

and they wanted you
to open for them?

1264

If my ex was in a band?

1265
00:59:08,574 --> 00:59:09,563
Mmm-hmm.

1266
00:59:10,175 --> 00:59:11,665
Might be a little
awkward, but maybe

1267
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,404
it's the grown-up
thing to do.

00:59:31,396 --> 00:59:33,330
I think you mentioned
she was fat.

about grammar.

1440
01:07:08,353 --> 01:07:10,253
<i>I dislike you, capisce?</i>

1441
01:07:10,321 --> 01:07:12,050
Tell it to the cleaning lady on Monday.

1442
01:07:12,123 --> 01:07:13,215
What?

1443
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:14,781
Because you'll be dust
by Monday.

1444
01:07:15,493 --> 01:07:16,517
Um...

1445
01:07:16,594 --> 01:07:18,653
Because you'll be
pulverized in two seconds.

1446
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:21,961
And the cleaning lady,
she cleans up dust.

1447
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,124
She dusts.

1448
01:07:26,337 --> 01:07:27,736
So, what's on Monday?

1449
01:07:28,773 --> 01:07:32,903
Because it's Friday now. She
has the weekends off, so...

1450
01:07:33,511 --> 01:07:35,445
Monday. Right?

1451
01:07:36,114 --> 01:07:37,479
Basically, you can't
win this fight.

1452
01:07:37,549 --> 01:07:38,709
You're gonna have
to give up this girl,

1453
01:07:38,783 --> 01:07:40,114
because Todd's
gonna kill you.

1454
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:42,418
You used to be so nice!

1455
01:07:46,524 --> 01:07:47,650
(SCREAMING)

1456
01:07:54,666 --> 01:07:57,692
Scott, we're gonna go
to Pizza Pizza for a slice.

1457
01:07:57,769 --> 01:07:59,202
Call us when you're done.

1458
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:01,864
He'll be done.
Real soon.

1459
01:08:05,276 --> 01:08:08,507
Sounds like someone
wants to get funky.

1460
01:08:09,247 --> 01:08:10,236
(BASS GUITAR PLAYING)

1461

(GROANING)

1463
01:09:31,663 --> 01:09:35,759
I can read your thoughts. Your
will is broken. You're through.

1464
01:09:36,267 --> 01:09:38,132
What say we drink
to my memory?

1465
01:09:38,269 --> 01:09:40,169
Fair trade blend
with soy milk?

1466
01:09:40,738 --> 01:09:42,672
(SCOFFS) I'm sorry,
but that's pathetic.

1467
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,765
Dude, I can see
in your mind's eye.

1468
01:09:44,843 --> 01:09:46,970
You put half-and-half
into one of those coffees

1469
01:09:47,045 --> 01:09:49,275
in an attempt to
make me break vegan edge.

1470
01:09:49,347 --> 01:09:51,144
I'll take the one with soy.

1471
01:09:53,985 --> 01:09:55,782
Thanks, tool.

1472
01:09:57,155 --> 01:10:00,386
<i>Actually, muchacho,
I poured the soy in this cup.</i>

1473
01:10:00,458 --> 01:10:03,291
But I thought real hard
about pouring it in that cup.

1474
01:10:03,361 --> 01:10:06,262
You know, in my mind's eye or whatever.

1475
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:08,822
What are you talking about?

1476
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,333
You just drank
half-and-half, baby.

1477
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,467
Freeze! Vegan police!

1478
01:10:13,538 --> 01:10:14,732
Vegan police!

1479
01:10:14,806 --> 01:10:18,333
Todd Ingram, you're under
arrest for veganity violation,

1480
01:10:18,409 --> 01:10:21,640
code number 827,
imbibement of half-and-half.

1481
01:10:22,213 --> 01:10:23,305
That's bullroar!

1482
01:10:23,381 --> 01:10:25,315
No vegan diet,
no vegan powers!

1483
01:10:25,383 --> 01:10:27,544
But it's only
my first offense.

1484
01:10:27,619 --> 01:10:28,779
Don't I get three strikes?
I mean...

1485
01:10:28,853 --> 01:10:30,218
Take it.

1486
01:10:31,122 --> 01:10:33,750
At 12:27 a.m.
On February 1st,

1487
01:10:33,825 --> 01:10:35,122
you knowingly
ingested gelato.

1488
01:10:35,994 --> 01:10:37,120
Gelato isn't vegan?

1489
01:10:37,195 --> 01:10:38,628
It's milk and eggs, bitch.

1490
01:10:38,696 --> 01:10:41,824
On April 4th, 7:30 p.m. You
partook a plate of chicken parmesan.

1491
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:42,889
(GASPS)

1492
01:10:43,468 --> 01:10:44,662
Chicken isn't vegan?

1493
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:47,361
The de-veganizing ray.
Hit him.

1494
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,029
(SCREAMING)

1495
01:11:03,488 --> 01:11:04,978
ENVY: Oh, my God!

1496
01:11:05,056 --> 01:11:07,581
No. No.

1497
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:11,060
You once were a vegone,

1498
01:11:11,129 --> 01:11:13,324
but now you will be gone.

1499
01:11:13,531 --> 01:11:14,657
Vegone?

1500
01:11:29,614 --> 01:11:31,775
Yeah!
Yeah!

1501
01:11:37,722 --> 01:11:39,713
Sorry, I guess.

1502
01:11:40,925 --> 01:11:42,722
Sorry?

1503
01:11:42,994 --> 01:11:46,259
You just headbutted my
boyfriend so hard he burst.

1504
01:11:47,332 --> 01:11:50,927
You kicked my heart in the
ass, so I guess we're even.

1505
01:11:52,403 --> 01:11:53,893
Natalie.

1506
01:11:54,839 --> 01:11:59,071
Natalie? No one
calls me that anymore.

1507
01:12:00,778 --> 01:12:01,870
Maybe they should.

1508
01:12:04,882 --> 01:12:06,611
Let's get out of here.

1509
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:17,093
For the record, I am so
pissed off for you, right now.

1510
01:12:17,161 --> 01:12:18,992
Shut the (BLEEP) up, Julie.

1511
01:12:19,063 --> 01:12:20,360
Okay.

1512
01:12:21,532 --> 01:12:23,227
We're still going to
the after-party, right?

1513
01:12:23,301 --> 01:12:25,098
KIM: I'm not sure there's
going to be much of a party.

1514
01:12:25,169 --> 01:12:26,830
I think a third of the band
just went "poom.''

1515
01:12:26,904 --> 01:12:29,566
Yeah, cool bands never go
to their own after-parties.

1516
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,404
Just the desperate people trying
to rub elbows with the label guys.

1517
01:12:32,477 --> 01:12:34,445
Then why would we... Oh.

1518
01:12:34,512 --> 01:12:36,605
Neil, you down?

1519
01:12:36,681 --> 01:12:37,978
Scott, you're in, right?

1520
01:12:38,983 --> 01:12:40,109
You wanna go?

1521
01:12:40,184 --> 01:12:43,483
Well, I kind of
almost died back there.

1522
01:12:43,554 --> 01:12:44,612
I'm not saying
I want to go.

1523
01:12:44,756 --> 01:12:45,814
Yeah. We can totally go.

1524
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:46,914
I'll do whatever
you want to do.

1525
01:12:46,991 --> 01:12:47,980
So, let's go.

1526
01:12:49,227 --> 01:12:50,956
RAMONA: We really don't
have to go to this thing.

1527
01:12:51,029 --> 01:12:52,826
It'll probably be
a bad scene all around.

1528
01:12:52,897 --> 01:12:55,422
No, I'm fine.
It's just...

1529
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,933
It's just...
Well...

1530
01:12:58,169 --> 01:13:01,229
Have you ever dated someone
that wasn't a total ass?

1531
01:13:01,305 --> 01:13:03,034
So far,
you're not a total ass.

1532
01:13:03,107 --> 01:13:04,301
But I'm part ass?

1533
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:06,502
If it makes you feel better,
you're the nicest guy I've dated.

1534
01:13:06,577 --> 01:13:07,601
Wait, is that good?

1535
01:13:07,678 --> 01:13:08,838
It's what I need right now.

1536
01:13:08,913 --> 01:13:09,937
But not later?

1537
01:13:10,014 --> 01:13:11,845
Scott, I don't have
all the answers, okay?

1538
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:14,646
I'd just like to try and
live in the moment if I can.

1539
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:16,311
I'd just like to live.

1540
01:13:16,754 --> 01:13:18,221
RAMONA: Look, I know
Todd was bad news,

1541
01:13:18,289 --> 01:13:19,722
but are you saying
Envy wasn't?

1542
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:21,156
We all have baggage.

1543
01:13:21,225 --> 01:13:24,285
Well, my baggage doesn't try
and kill me every five minutes.

1544
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:26,227
What did you do to make
your ex-boyfriend so insane?

1545
01:13:26,297 --> 01:13:27,628
Exes.
Whatever.

1546
01:13:27,698 --> 01:13:29,859
No breakup is painless,
somebody always gets hurt.

1547
01:13:29,934 --> 01:13:32,494
What about you and that girl,
Knives? Who broke up with who?

1548
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:35,164
I believe
I broke up with her.

1549
01:13:35,239 --> 01:13:36,536
And was she cool with that?

1550
01:13:36,607 --> 01:13:39,098
Knives is with Young Neil now.
She's totally cool with it.

1551
01:13:39,177 --> 01:13:40,166
You sure about that?

1552
01:13:40,244 --> 01:13:41,802
Yeah, she's very mature
for her age.

1553
01:13:41,879 --> 01:13:43,141
We had a very
healthy breakup.

1554
01:13:43,214 --> 01:13:44,408
We're all peaches and gravy.

1555
01:13:44,549 --> 01:13:45,777
KNIVES: (ECHOING) No!

1556
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:47,440
What about you and Kim?

1557
01:13:47,518 --> 01:13:49,679
Me and Kim?
I can barely remember.

1558
01:13:49,754 --> 01:13:51,745
It was high school.
She had freckles.

1559
01:13:51,956 --> 01:13:53,014
That's it?

1560
01:13:53,091 --> 01:13:56,083
Yeah, it kind of ended.
We changed.

1561
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,286
That's really
the whole story?

1562
01:13:57,361 --> 01:13:59,226
Okay, fine, I had to fight
a guy to be with her. Okay?

1563
01:13:59,297 --> 01:14:01,925
I fought a crazy,
80-foot-tall, purple-suited dude

1564
01:14:01,999 --> 01:14:04,126
and I had to fight
96 guys to get to him.

1565
01:14:04,202 --> 01:14:06,830
He was flying and shooting
lightning bolts from his eyes, okay?

1566
01:14:06,904 --> 01:14:09,338
And I kicked him so hard that he
saw the curvature of the earth.

1567
01:14:09,407 --> 01:14:11,841
Does that make
you feel any better?

1568
01:14:11,909 --> 01:14:14,707
Well, now you are being a
total ass. Welcome to the club.

1569
01:14:15,513 --> 01:14:17,743
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.

1570
01:14:17,815 --> 01:14:21,342
Hey, don't worry. I don't even
know what I'm like anymore.

1571
01:14:22,253 --> 01:14:25,051
I think this ex-boyfriends
thing is messing with my head.

1572
01:14:25,123 --> 01:14:26,522
Exes.
Why do you keep saying that?

1573
01:14:26,591 --> 01:14:27,580
(GRUNTING)

1574
01:14:34,098 --> 01:14:35,725
<i>SCOTT: The girl from earlier?</i>

1575
01:14:36,367 --> 01:14:38,301
Roxy?
You know this girl?

1576
01:14:38,369 --> 01:14:41,395
Boy, does she know me.

1577
01:14:41,606 --> 01:14:43,801
What is she talking about?

1578
01:14:44,008 --> 01:14:45,600
He really doesn't know?

1579
01:14:47,011 --> 01:14:48,035
Wait.

1580
01:14:48,946 --> 01:14:49,935
Hmm?

1581
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:54,818
You and her?
It was just a phase.

1582
01:14:54,886 --> 01:14:56,547
Just a phase?
You had a sexy phase?

1583
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:58,111
It meant nothing. I didn't
think it would count.

1584
01:14:58,189 --> 01:14:59,247
It meant nothing?

1585
01:14:59,323 --> 01:15:00,551
I was just
a little bi-curious.

1586
01:15:00,625 --> 01:15:02,183
Well, honey,

1587
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:05,127
I'm a little bi-furious.

1588
01:15:16,807 --> 01:15:18,900
Do that again
and I will end you.

1589
01:15:18,976 --> 01:15:20,443
Back off, hasbian.

1590
01:15:20,945 --> 01:15:23,413
If Gideon can't have you,
no one can.

1591
01:15:25,149 --> 01:15:27,174
The League has spoken.

1592
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:30,383
Well, then Gideon best get
his pretentious ass up here

1593
01:15:30,454 --> 01:15:33,082
because I'm about to kick yours
