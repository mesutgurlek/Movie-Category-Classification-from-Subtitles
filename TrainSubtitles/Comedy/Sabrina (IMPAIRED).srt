1
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,592
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

2
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,032
<i>on the North Shore of Long Island,
some 30 miles from New York,</i>

3
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,470
<i>there lived a small girl
on a large estate.</i>

4
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,151
<i>The estate was very large indeed
and had many servants.</i>

5
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,272
<i>There were gardeners
to take care of the gardens</i>

6
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,960
<i>and a tree surgeon on a retainer.</i>

7
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,756
<i>There was a boatman to put the boats
in the water in the spring</i>

8
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,758
<i>and scrape their bottoms
in the winter.</i>

9
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,190
<i>There were specialists
to take care of the grounds,</i>

10
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,836
<i>the outdoor tennis court
and the indoor tennis court,</i>

11
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,556
<i>the outdoor swimming pool
and the indoor swimming pool.</i>

12
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,319
<i>And a man of no particular title</i>

13
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,072
<i>took care of a small pool in the
garden for a goldfish named George.</i>

14
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,238
<i>Also on the estate there was
a chauffeur by the name of Fairchild,</i>

15
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,352
<i>who had been imported from England
years ago,</i>

16
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,438
<i>together with a new Rolls-Royce.</i>

17
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,872
<i>Fairchild was a fine chauffeur
of considerable polish,</i>

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,639
<i>like the eight cars in his care.</i>

19
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,469
<i>And he had a daughter
by the name of... Sabrina.</i>

20
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,158
<i>It was the eve of
the annual six-metre-yacht races</i>

21
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,193
<i>and, as had been traditional
for the past 30 years,</i>

22
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,312
<i>the Larrabees were giving a party.</i>

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,591
<i>It never rained on the night
of the Larrabee party.</i>

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,439
<i>The Larrabees
wouldn't have stood for it.</i>

25
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,317
<i>There were four Larrabees in all -
father, mother and two sons.</i>

26
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,719
<i>Maude and Oliver Larrabee
were married in 1906.</i>

27
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,118
<i>Among their many wedding presents
was a town house in New York</i>

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,390
<i>and this estate for weekends.</i>

29
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,310
<i>The town house has since been
converted into Saks Fifth Avenue.</i>

30
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,991
<i>Linus Larrabee, the elder son,
graduated from Yale,</i>

31
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,111
<i>where his classmates voted him</i>

32
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,711
<i>the man most likely
to leave his alma mater $50 million.</i>

33
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,073
<i>His brother, David, went through
several of the best Eastern colleges</i>

34
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,509
<i>for short periods of time,</i>

35
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,873
<i>and through several marriages
for even shorter periods of time.</i>

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,310
<i>He is now a successful
six-goal polo player</i>

37
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,195
<i>and is listed on Linus's tax return
as a $600 deduction.</i>

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,195
<i>Life was pleasant among
the Larrabees,</i>

39
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,757
<i>for this was as close to heaven
as one could get on Long Island.</i>

Come on down from there, Sabrina.
Come on.

49
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,995
You'd better go and finish packing.

50
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,795
Who's that girl, Father,
dancing with David?

51
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,512
(woman giggles)

52
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,077
Her name is Gretchen Van Horn.
Chase National Bank.

53
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,760
I hate girls that giggle
all the time.

54
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,474
You hate every girl David looks at.

55
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,435
You can't go on like this about
David. You've got to get over it.

56
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,073
Yes, Father.

57
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,317
It's good you're going away.
I only hope it's far enough.

58
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,035
Yes, Father.

59
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,116
Come along, Sabrina.

60
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,310
In a minute, Father. You go ahead.
I'll be up soon.

(giggles)

64
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,398
- Oh, it's you, Sabrina.
- Hello, David.

65
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,397
I thought I heard somebody.

66
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,996
No, it's nobody.

67
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,876
Gretchen! Yoo-hoo!
Tennis, anyone?

68
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,594
- Gretchen?
- (giggles)

What is this, mixed singles?

(Gretchen giggles)

71
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,353
No! Whatever you do, you have to stay
on your side of the net.

72
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,675
That'll be a little difficult,
Gretchen.

73
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,191
- You know the rules of the game.
- OK, I'll serve.

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,836
Sabrina...

79
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,435
Yes, Father?

80
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,758
- Don't leave your passport tomorrow.
- No, Father.

81
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,589
It's not every girl
that's lucky enough to go to Paris.

82
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,792
And it's the best cooking school
in the world.

83
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,674
If your mother were alive,
she'd be happy you were going there.

84
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,678
After all, she was the best cook
on Long Island.

85
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,997
I'm not saying
you have to be a cook, as she was,

86
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,509
or that I want you to marry
a chauffeur.

87
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,392
But you know how I feel.

88
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,434
Your mother and I
had a good life together.

89
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,710
We were respected by everyone.

90
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,115
That's as much as anyone can want.

91
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,436
Don't reach for the moon, child.

92
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,955
No, Father.

93
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,153
Besides, it never hurt a young girl
to learn how to cook, did it?

94
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,756
I'll wake you at seven.
The boat goes at noon. Good night.

95
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,518
Good night.

Hello.

What are you doing here?

137
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,036
Just checking the spark plugs.

138

The what?

139
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,037
Father was worried
because a spark plug was missing.

140
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,549
I wanted to find out
which one it was.

141
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,035
So you started the motors
and closed the doors.

142
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,675
- I didn't want to disturb anyone.
- You might never have done so again.

143
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,032
- Does your father know?
- No! I wanted to surprise him.

144
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,836
We'd better get out.

145
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,079
There now. Breathe deep.

146
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,836
That's right. Now, deep breath.

147
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,393
Mmmm...

148
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,594
- What happened?
- You passed out.

149
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,876
I'm alright.
You don't have to carry me.

150
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,434
Of all the idiotic things...

151
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,348
Haven't you ever heard of carbon
monoxide? It kills people.

152
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,115
It does?

153
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,549
What would have happened
if I hadn't come along?

154
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,829
I'd have died.

155
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,713
And fast. Eight cars!
One would have done it.

asked me to drive her home.

- Uh-huh.

158
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,991
- Why didn't she drive her home?
- We can't find Gretchen.

159
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,076
- She...
- She what?

160
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,472
Nothing.

161
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,674
The next time you start a car, leave
the garage doors open. Understand?

162
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,399
A chauffeur's daughter
should know better.

163
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,952
Yes, sir.

164
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,715
Bonjour, mesdames et messieurs!

165
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,913
Yesterday we have learnt
the correct way how to boil water.

166
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,511
Today we will learn the correct way
how to crack an egg.

167
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,596
Voilà, an egg!

168
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,316
Now an egg is not a stone.
It is not made of wood.

169
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,113
It is a living thing with a heart.

170
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,550
So when we crack it
we must not torment it.

171
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,071
We must be merciful and execute it
quickly, like with the guillotine.

172
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,509
It is done with one hand.
Kindly watch the wrist.

173
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,514
Voilà. One, two, three, crack!

174
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,758
You see? It is all in the wrist.

175
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,356
And now, everybody, take an egg.

176
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,232
One, two, three, crack!

177
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,753
New egg.

178
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,836
One, two, three, crack!

179
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,517
New egg. One, two, three, crack!

180
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,272
New egg. One, two, three, crack!

181
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,156
Take an egg. Crack!

182
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,118
The wrist, huh? Like a whip.
You watch.

183
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,232
One, two, three, crack! New egg.

184
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,276
One, two, three, crack!

185
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,798
New egg. One, two, three, crack!

186
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,038
New egg. One, two...

187
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,669
"Dear Father, or Cher Papa
as we say over here".

188
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,756
"Isn't my French getting good?"

189
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,953
"We finally finished our four-week
course in sauces, thank goodness!"

190
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,356
"Soups were tough
but sauces just about killed me".

191
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,189
"I almost flunked my hollandaise.
It kept separating on me".

192
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,754
Too much vinegar.
Does she mention David?

193
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,759
- (buzzer)
- Mr Linus is ready to go into town.

194
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,953
- What does she say about David?
- Not a word.

195
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,036
No, wait. Here's something.

196
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,197
- "I don't think of David very much".
- That's good.

197
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,151
- "Except at night".
- That's bad.

198
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,670
"I decided to be sensible
and tore up his picture".

199
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,755
That's good.

200
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,589
- "Please mail me some Scotch tape".
- That's bad.

201
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,919
- Morning, Fairchild.
- Morning, sir. Beautiful day, sir.

202
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,157
Take the Parkway.
Two windows open. 35 miles an hour.

203
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,430
- Yes, sir.
- (tyres squeal)

204
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,997
Morning. Where are you off to?

205
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,873
- The office, where do you think?
- On Sunday?

206
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,992
- Today is Wednesday.
- Wednesday?

207
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,951
This is KL 75263.
Get me Bowling Green 91099.

208
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,150
Good morning, Miss McCardle.
How did the market open?

209
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,319
Industrials, 247.63.
Up a dollar, ten.

210
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,637
Rails, 94.7. Up 58 cents.

211
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,718
Utilities, 47.23. Off 11 cents.

212
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,832
I'm just leaving.
Put the coffee on in 45 minutes.

213
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,600
Inter- office memo to David Larrabee.

214
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,191
Dear David, you are a junior partner
of Larrabee Industries,

215
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,914
located at 30 Broad Street, New York.

216
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,429
Your office is on the 22nd floor.

217
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,953
Our normal week is Monday to Friday.
Our working day is nine to five.

218
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,356
If this is inconvenient
you may retire with your pension.

219
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,754
Having been with us one year,

220
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,839
your entitlement is 65 cents
a month for the rest of your life.

221
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,871
What do you hear from your daughter?

222
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,594
- She still loves him.
- I beg your pardon?

223
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,076
I mean
she loves the cooking school, sir.

224
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,916
But she'll get over it.

225
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,276
And now, mesdames et messieurs,

226
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,552
soon we will see how you have learnt
the lesson of the soufflé.

227
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,832
The soufflé, it must be gay.

228
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,279
Gay.

229
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,396
Like two butterflies dancing
the waltz in the summer breeze.

230
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,033
# Tra la la-la...

231
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,516
Very well. You have five seconds!

232
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,073
Four seconds.

233
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,315
Three seconds.

234
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,509
Two seconds.

235
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,835
One second.

236
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,916
To the ovens!

237
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,913
Too low.

238
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,996
Too pale.

239
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,836
Too heavy.

240
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,552
Too low.

241
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,636
Too high. You are exaggerating.

242
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,672
Fair.

243
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,755
So-so.

244
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,795
Sloppy.

245
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,996
Mmm! Superb! My dear Baron,
you have not lost your touch.

246
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,836
Much too low.

247
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,031
- I don't know what happened.
- I will tell you.

248
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,152
You forgot to turn on the oven.

249
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,714
I have been watching you.

250
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,355
Your mind has not been on the
cooking. It has been elsewhere.

251
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,473
You're in love. And I will venture
to go a step further.

252
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,956
- You are unhappily in love.
- Does it show?

253
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,949
Very clearly. A woman happily
in love, she burns the soufflé.

254
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,359
A woman unhappily in love,
she forgets to turn on the oven.

255
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,951
- Am I correct?
- Yes. But I'm trying to get over it.

256
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,676
Why try to get over it? You speak
of love like it was a bad cough.

257
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,475
He doesn't even know I exist.

258
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,034
I might as well be reaching
for the moon.

259
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,674
The moon? (chuckles)

260
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,758
Oh, you young people
are so old-fashioned!

261
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,351
Have you not heard? We are building
rockets to reach the moon.

262
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,788
To begin with, you must stop looking
like a horse.

263
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,273
Horse?

264
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,236
"His name is Baron Saint Fontanel".

265
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,752
Baron!

266
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,509
"He came here for a refresher course
in soufflés

267
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,599
and liked me so much he decided
to stay on for the fish".

268
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,679
- What does she say about David?
- David? She's got a baron!

269
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,395
- "The Baron is 74 years old...
- (all sigh)

270
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,636
...and very sweet and very wise".

271
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,719
"He has a box at the opera,
a racing stable, wonderful paintings

272
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,273
and his own vineyards".

273
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,951
"Tomorrow night he is taking me
to a very fashionable charity ball

274
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,231
and I have a dress
just for the occasion".

275
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,396
"If David could only see me in it".

276
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,274
"Yards of skirt
and way off the shoulders".

277
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,549
(all) Good morning, sir.

278
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,990
- Morning. What's going on?
- A letter from Sabrina.

279
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,874
Wouldn't you like to read it?
There's something about you.

280
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,874
- Poor Sabrina.
- What's wrong with him?

281
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,309
He's getting married again.

282
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,749
- He is?
- Mm-hm. Number four.

283
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,552
Who says so?

284
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,912
Cholly Knickerbocker. Don't you
people ever read the society columns?

285
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,998
(typewriters clatter)

286
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,952
- Is my brother in?
- Yes, Mr David, but he's very busy.

287
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,038
- I want to see him.
- How about 3:30?

288
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,152
- I want to see him now!
- I'm sorry. I have my orders.

289
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,157
He's working on the plastics deal.

290
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,793
Press that button,

291
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,992
or I'll break that door down
using you as a battering ram!

292
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,475
- Mr David!
- Make up your mind!

293
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,435
Linus, I want to talk to you!

294
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,749
- Ask for an appointment.
- Don't give me that! I'm mad!

295
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,474
Alright, gentlemen,
I'll be ten minutes.

296
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,956
Now what's the trouble?

297
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,876
How did this get in the paper?

298
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,956
"David Larrabee is to marry again".

299
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,152
"The girl is Elizabeth Tyson
of the Oyster Bay Tysons".

300
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,840
- Congratulations.
- Did you plant this?

301
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,998
It's common knowledge about you and
Elizabeth Tyson. Don't you like her?

302
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,430
I like her a lot.
I like a lot of girls a lot.

303
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,757
- You can say that again.
- What are you doing with that gun?

304
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,594
Put that thing away, Linus!

305
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,633
Look at that. The greatest plastic
ever made. Not a scratch.

306
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,594
I wonder how this would stand up
against a bazooka.

307
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,032
Miss McCardle, ask General Stanton
if we can borrow a bazooka.

308
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,513
Yes, Mr Larrabee.

309
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,677
- To get back to my problem...
- Lend me your lighter.

310
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,349
Linus, I have no intention
of marrying Elizabeth Tyson!

311
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,156
Doesn't burn, doesn't scorch,
doesn't melt. How about that!

312
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,078
I've been married before.
I've had it three times.

313
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,156
This time the family approves.

314
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,352
You're going to do
something constructive. Taste it.

315
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,710
What's constructive
about marrying her?

316
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,149
- Taste it.
- It's sweet.

317
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,236
It's made of sugar cane.

318
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,874
Sugar cane.

319
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,513
Wait a minute.

320
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,589
The Tysons own the largest holdings
of sugar cane in Puerto Rico!

321
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,678
Second largest.
The largest have no daughter.

322
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,268
It's all beginning to make sense.

323
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,995
Mr Tyson owns the sugar cane,
you own the formula for the plastics

324
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,989
and I'm offered as a sacrifice
on the altar of industrial progress!

325
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,590
You make it sound as if the son
of the hot-dog dynasty

326
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,393
had to marry the daughter
of the mustard king.

327
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,911
Surely you don't object to Elizabeth
because her father has $20 million?

328
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,917
That's very narrow-minded of you.

329
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,555
Just one thing. I haven't proposed
and she hasn't accepted.

330
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,355
Oh, don't worry.
I proposed and Mr Tyson accepted.

331
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,519
- Did you kiss him?
- Elizabeth is a lovely girl.

332
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,076
Sooner or later you'll propose.
I'm helping you make up your mind.

333
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,794
- Then you marry her.
- Me?

334
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,876
What's so funny?

335
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,471
If I got married, I'd have to take
a Dictaphone, two secretaries

336
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,956
and four corporation counsellors
along on the honeymoon.

337
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,878
I'd be unfaithful to my wife
every night

338
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,993
with vice presidents, boards of
directors, slide- rule accountants...

339
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,193
This... this is my home.
No wife would ever understand it.

340
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,629
Nor me. You've got all the money
in the world.

341
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,596
Making money isn't the main point
of business. Money is a by-product.

342
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,191
- What's the main objective? Power?
- Ah! That's become a dirty word.

343
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,079
What's the urge? You're going into
plastics. What will that prove?

344
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,994
Prove? Nothing much.

345
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,476
A new product has been found,
something of use to the world.

346
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,353
A new industry moves into
an undeveloped area.

347
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,677
Factories go up, machines go in
and you're in business.

348
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,918
It's coincidental that people who've
never seen a dime now have a dollar

349
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,999
and barefooted kids wear shoes
and have their faces washed.

350
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,314
What's wrong with an urge

351
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,671
that gives people libraries,
hospitals, baseball diamonds

352
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,030
and movies on a Saturday night?

353
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,549
- Send in the secretaries.
- Yes, Mr Larrabee.

354
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,511
You make me feel like a heel.

355
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,713
If I don't marry her, some kid
will run around Puerto Rico barefoot!

356
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,992
Look at this stuff.
Planes and suits will be made of it

357
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,793
and you'll probably be able
to eat it.

358
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,674
We're organising Larrabee Plastics.
Larrabee Construction has the plans.

359
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,509
Larrabee Shipping bought nine more
freighters to handle the traffic.

360
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,110
- The wheels are in motion already?
- That's what I mean.

361
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,279
Would you demonstrate the weight test
to Mr David, please?

362
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,233
- Linus, I believe you.
- Up you go.

363
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,193
I want you to see
how resilient it is.

364
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,276
Bounce, please, ladies.

365
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,636
Some plastic, eh?

366
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,355
We'd like a summer wedding
to get in on this year's sugar crop.

367
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,233
Yeah.

368
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,753
I think
you're going to be very happy.

369
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,439
(accordion plays La Vie En Rose)

370
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,357
Dearest Father,

371
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,315
we shall be graduating next week
and I shall be getting my diploma.

372
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,195
I want to thank you now for the two
most wonderful years of my life.

373
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,357
I shall always love you
for sending me here.

374
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,476
It is late at night

375
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,718
and someone across the way
is playing "La Vie En Rose".

376
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,876
It is the French way of saying,

377
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,232
I am looking at the world
through rose-coloured glasses.

378
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,113
It says everything I feel.

379
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,677
I have learnt so many things,
Father.

380
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:20,352
Notjust how to make vichyssoise or
calf's head with sauce vinaigrette,

381
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,074
but a much more important recipe.

382
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,111
I have learnt how to live,

383
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,119
how to be in the world
and of the world...

384
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,998
...and notjust to stand aside
and watch.

385
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,996
And I will never, never again
run away from life,

386
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,076
or from love, either.

387
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,749
I am taking the plane home
on Friday, Father.

388
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,394
You needn't pick me up
at the airport.

389
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,114
I'll just take
the Long Island Rail Road

390
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,949
and you can meet me at the train -
the 4:15.

391
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,914
If you should have any difficulty
recognising your daughter,

392
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,511
I shall be the most sophisticated
woman at the Glen Cove station.

393
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,396
(whistles Isn't It Romantic?)

394
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,076
(car engine)

395
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,316
Taxi, miss?
Cheapest rates in Glen Cove.

396
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,038
Hello! How are you?

397
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,116
Well, I'm fine. How are you?
And I might add, who are you?

398
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,753
- Who am I?
- Am I supposed to know?

399
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,516
No, you're not supposed to know.

400
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,599
- Are you stranded?
- My father was meant to pick me up.

401
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,678
Whoever your father is,
I'll be eternally grateful.

402
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,679
- That is if I can give you a lift.
- You can drive me home.

403
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,756
Good! I'll get your bags.

404
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,598
- Where do you live?
- Dosoris Lane.

405
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,917
Dosoris Lane?
Say, that's where I live!

406
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,759
- Really?
- Sure. We must be neighbours.

407
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,678
And I believe in
loving thy neighbour.

408
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,234
Oh, so do I.

409
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,316
Come on, David.

410
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,035
- David? Is his name David?
- Yes, it is.

411
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,355
That's funny. My name's David, too.

412
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,356
That is funny, isn't it?

413
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,594
Sure you don't want
to tell me your name?

414
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,837
Positive.
I'm having much too much fun.

415
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,190
Alright, if you want to play games...

416
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,108
- Have you always lived here?
- Most of my life.

417
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,993
I'd swear I know every pretty girl
on the North Shore.

418
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,714
You take in more territory than that.

419
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,798
This is maddening.
I've seen that face before.

420
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,115
Let me see your profile again.

421
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,711
I know I know you.

422
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,799
I have a feeling I've seen you...
with your father.

423
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,229
Wait!
Is your father Admiral Starratt?

424
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,396
Hardly.

425
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,318
Funny.
I keep seeing him in a uniform.

426
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,716
Give us a hint.
What does your father do?

427
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,230
- He's in transportation.
- Transportation?

428
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,430
- Railroads. New York Central.
- No.

429
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,516
- Planes. TWA.
- No.

430
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,791
- Boats. United States Lines.
- No.

431
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,990
- I pass.
- Automobiles.

432
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,911
Oh? Chrysler?

433
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,470
Yes, Chrysler and Ford
and General Motors and Rolls-Royce.

434
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,114
Is he on the board
of all those companies?

435
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,590
You might say he runs things.

436
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,708
- I bet my brother Linus knows him.
- He certainly does.

437
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,673
They often drive into town together.

438
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,199
They do?

439
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,039
Straight through to the garage,
please.

440
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,833
I feel so stupid I could kill myself.

441
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,155
You'll be alright in a minute.

442
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,548
Here we are.

443
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,435
I'm not just pretending we've met
somewhere before. We have met some...

444
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,991
You don't live here. I live here.

445
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,076
Hi, neighbour!

446
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,433
(horn)

447
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,516
Sabrina!

448
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,916
Hello, Margaret!
It's so good to be home!

449
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,669
Look at you! You've come home
such a beautiful lady!

450
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,791
Oh, welcome home, Sabrina!

451
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,229
Ernest! Jenny! How are you?

452
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,277
Don't cry, Margaret.
It's nothing to cry about.

453
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,269
I bought you a hat, a Paris hat
for you to wear to church on Sundays.

454
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,437
- Jenny, I have something for you...
- (car engine)

455
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,556
Father!

456
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,796
I'm sorry. I had to take Mrs Larrabee
to the hairdresser.

457
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,115
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

458
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,111
I wouldn't have recognised you
anyway.

459
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,629
David had a little trouble,
didn't you?

460
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,391
Yes. Yes, I did.

461
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,875
I'll make coffee.
Will you come to the kitchen?

462
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,755
- As soon as I've opened my bags.
- I'll take them upstairs.

463
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,839
As old neighbours
the two of us should have a reunion.

464
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,791
- It's only fair.
- Tonight?

465
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,036
- Do you really want to see me?
- Very much.

466
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,310
- Sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

467
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,396
- Alright.
- We'll go out on the town.

468
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,308
We'll drive to New York, have
a quick drink, then go for dinner.

469
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,591
I know a wonderful French restaurant
on First Avenue.

470
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,076
I guess you wouldn't think
so much of it after Paris.

471
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,155
I'll love it!

472
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,838
We'll go dancing.

473
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,509
When they throw us out of El Morocco,
we'll go to the Village.

474
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,950
You like Dixieland bands?
I know the greatest. It's...

475
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,789
Wait, I forgot.
We're having a party here tonight.

476
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,071
With an orchestra and dancing?
That'll be even more fun.

477
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,912
I don't know.
A lot of dull people. Family stuff.

478
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,837
I don't mind if you're there.

479
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,194
- Sabrina?
- In a minute, Father.

480
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,039
I have a lovely evening dress
with yards of skirt.

481
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,549
- Shall I wear it?
- Why, yes, of course.

482
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,716
This couldn't be nicer.
A homecoming party!

483
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,752
I'II... get the dress out
and press it.

484
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,836
See you tonight.

485
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,152
Hello, Linus. I'm back!

486
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,752
It's Sabrina.
Would you have recognised her?

487
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,031
That scrawny kid who'd run away
when she saw us,

488
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,754
her knees painted with Mercurochrome.

489
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,395
How do you like those legs now?
Aren't they something?

490
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,717
David, the last pair of legs
that were something

491
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,195
cost the family $25,000.

492
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,678
Look what I brought you from Paris.

493
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,832
Sabrina, I should have mentioned it
in a letter...

494
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,669
- Here. Do you like it?
- But I didn't want to upset you.

495
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,109
Aren't they gaudy?

496
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,596
Sabrina, David is engaged.
He's getting married again.

497
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,438
I know. Margaret wrote me.

498
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,109
Brandy. And this is for you to wear
on your day off.

499
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,472
- Then you don't care?
- Not too much. He's not married yet.

500
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,194
I don't like that.
I don't like the sound of it.

501
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,276
Father, everything has changed.

502
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,233
Nothing's changed.
He's still David Larrabee.

503
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,555
And you're still
the chauffeur's daughter.

504
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,478
And you're still reaching for
the moon.

505
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,990
No, Father.
The moon's reaching for me.

506
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,396
(band plays)

507
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,832
I wish the wedding were tomorrow,
David.

508
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,155
- Don't you?
- Yes, dear.

509
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,273
Ten more days.
It'll seem more like ten years.

510
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,197
Yes, dear.

511
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,393
Father had planned for us to fly
to Honolulu afterwards. I said not.

512
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,798
I don't want to spend the first
18 hours of my honeymoon in a plane.

513
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,751
- Do you?
- Yes, dear.

514
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,077
- David!
- What? I mean, no. What did you say?

515
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,510
- Aren't you interested?
- Of course, dear.

516
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,949
- Aren't they a sweet couple!
- Charming. Elizabeth is lovely.

517
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,038
Why do young men wear white jackets
in the evening?

518
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,116
They look like barbers!

519
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,070
- Now, Oliver...
- My throat's dry.

520
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,431
- Have you been smoking?
- I've stopped smoking.

521
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,028
It's sad
that after 48 years of marriage

522
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,628
distrust should creep
into our relationship.

523
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,354
I'll join the men in the library.

524
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,191
David? I think I ought to have
a talk with your chauffeur.

525
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,753
What for?

526
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,351
Father wants to give me a car
and your chauffeur could tell me...

527
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,436
Sure, sure. Of course.

528
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,393
- What's his name?
- Sabrina.

529
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,956
I mean Fairchild.
I'll talk to him. Don't bother.

530
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,390
Alright, darling. I know
you'll take care of everything.

531
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,756
What is it, David?

532
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,475
- Would you like to get some food?
- No, thank you.

533
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,556
- A drink?
- No.

534
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,911
- I'm terribly sorry!
- It's my fault. I didn't see you.

535
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,076
- Will it wash out?
- Yes.

536
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,034
- You'd better do it now.
- Come on, Elizabeth. I'll help you.

537
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,952
Sabrina!

538
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,513
David!

539
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,876
- Hello.
- You look wonderful.

540
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,468
- Thank you. I'm a bit late.
- I worried.

541
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,909
Were you afraid I'd forgotten
the address?

542
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,758
It crossed my mind.

543
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,474
- Shall we dance?
- Right here?

544
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,434
- Who is that girl?
- I don't know.

545
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,233
I wonder what happened to Elizabeth.

546
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,757
- What a lovely party.
- It is now.

547
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,873
The nicest one you've ever had.
And I've been to all your parties.

548
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,310
- You have?
- Standing up there in that tree.

549
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,795
Sabrina, if I'd only known.

550
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,073
Oh, Sabrina, Sabrina,
where have you been all my life?

551
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,909
- Right over the garage.
- Right over my car.

552
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,749
Right up in that tree.
What a fool I was.

553
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,230
And what a crush I had on you.

554
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,355
It's not too late, is it?

555
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,675
I don't know, David. Is it?

556
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,873
You should see her!
You should see Sabrina!

557
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,673
The prettiest girl.
The prettiest dress. The best dancer.

558
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,279
The belle of the ball.

559
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,710
- It's as if she belonged up there.
- I don't like it.

560
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,432
- Is she dancing with David?
- That's right.

561
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,792
He's holding her so close
I don't see how she can breathe.

562
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,718
And the way they look
into each other's eyes...

563
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,037
- I don't like it.
- Tom, be happy for her.

564
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,993
This is what she wanted.
It's where she belongs.

565
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,190
It's not.
And it's not where I belong.

566
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,675
Remember the chauffeur
on the Harrington estate?

567
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,836
His daughter fell in love
with the son.

568
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,475
Next he was driving the family
to the church, changing his uniform

569
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,113
and giving the bride away.

570
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,313
- That's not for me. I don't like it.
- That was 25 years ago.

571
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,396
Come on. Let's sneak up and see her.

572
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,675
David?

573
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,958
- Hello, Mother.
- I don't know this lady.

574
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,753
- You do.
- Good evening, Mrs Larrabee.

575
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,713
- Mother, this is Miss Fairchild.
- Sabrina?

576
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,239
Yes, of course.

577
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,033
Yes, of course.

578
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,839
Of course. Sabrina.

579
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,350
You didn't recognise me, did you?
Have I changed?

580
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,711
You certainly have.
You look lovely, Sabrina.

581
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,630
I thought it would be fun to ask her
to the party as a welcome home.

582
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,558
David's been wonderful.
He met me at the station.

583
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,148
Did he? How nice of him.

584
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,272
- She's been to Paris.
- Yes, I know.

585
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,710
Come and cook something
very special for us, Sabrina.

586
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,150
- I want to see what you've learnt.
- I've learnt a lot.

587
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,236
(band plays)

588
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,155
Bye.

589
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:59,035
This is such fun. So much more fun
than just watching from that tree.

590
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,516
I'm glad you came home.
I'll never let you go away again.

591
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,312
- Never?
- Never.

592
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,953
Would you like to kiss me?

593
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,638
- Would I?
- Yes. A nice, steady kiss.

594
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,991
- Not on roller skates this time.
- Roller skates?

595
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,078
- You don't remember?
- I remember I had a pair.

596
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,873
I was nine
and you had your arms around me

597
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,992
because you were teaching me
to skate backwards.

598
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,510
Suddenly, you kissed me.
I've never forgotten.

599
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,392
- Sabrina, let's get out of here.
- Yes, let's.

600
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,876
I tell you what. You slip away first.
I'll meet you at...

601
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,319
The indoor tennis court.

602
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,273
- And you'll bring champagne.
- Of course.

603
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,916
You saw a lot from that tree!

604
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,590
Will you have the orchestra play
Isn't It Romantic?

605
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,597
Naturally.

606
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,874
- Where's David?
- He's being a good host.

607
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,390
I'll get him out of circulation.
Thank you.

608
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,356
(music stops / applause)

609
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,390
Got a minute, David?

610
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,795
- Not now.
- The old man wants to see you.

611
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,514
- I'm busy.
- He's frothing at the mouth.

612
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,756
- What about?
- You guess.

613
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,838
- Animal, vegetable or mineral?
- Definitely animal.

614
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,189
Linus, this boy should be drummed out
of the family!

615
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,833
What have I done now?

616
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,554
I'm not saying
all Larrabees have been saints.

617
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:14,639
Thomas Larrabee was hung for piracy.
Benjamin Larrabee was a slave trader.

618
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,958
And Joshua Larrabee was shot
while attempting to rob a train.

619
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,550
But no Larrabee has behaved
as you have behaved tonight!

620
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,353
- Exactly what have I done?
- Done?

621
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,391
Father,
remember your basal metabolism.

622
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,715
Making love to a servant
in your mother's house!

623
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,479
- She is not a servant.
- She's a servant's daughter.

624
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,831
You have embarrassed
your mother and our chauffeur.

625
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,475
I've too much respect for Fairchild
to intrude on his personal life.

626
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,511
You should have that respect for her.

627
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,313
I have so much respect for her
I invited her.

628
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,556
- That's overdoing it.
- I love her!

629
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,633
He loves her!

630
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,912
Next thing he'll elope with the girl
in the middle of the night!

631
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,268
Maybe!

632
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,516
I'll overlook you're an engaged man

633
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,632
and remind you of your marital record
to date.

634
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,354
I know, Father.
I made three mistakes.

635
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,712
First, that Hungarian countess, who
married you to bring her family over.

636
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:11,789
Her parents and five brothers, all of
them needing costly dental repairs!

637
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,196
- Do we have to go through it again?
- Then that Twyman girl.

638
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,709
Her family 50 years
on the social register.

639
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:22,197
She wore on her wedding dress not
a corsage but a Stevenson button!

640
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,958
You promised not to swear.

641
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,877
Then that great actress!

642
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,118
All she does is commercials on
television for an underarm deodorant.

643
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,231
Poof-poof! Poof-poof!

644
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,032
And now our chauffeur's daughter!

645
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,879
- Father, are you through?
- I am not through!

646
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,514
I'm sure Linus
has a few words to say.

647
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,995
I do.
But you won't like them, Father.

648
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,588
- You're being unfair to David.
- I'm what?

649
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,676
David's old enough to live his life.

650
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,109
- If she's the girl for him...
- Nonsense!

651
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,596
You really mean that?
It would knock your plans.

652
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,599
The plastics merger? Forget it.
If you love her, take her.

653
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,154
- This is the 20th century.
- The 20th century?

654
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,670
I could pick a century out of a hat
and get a better one!

655
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,588
You will get rid of that girl
and apologise to your fiancée!

656
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,430
Now, Father, don't push him. Let's
discuss this like civilised people.

657
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,518
- Sit down, David.
- Thank you, Linus.

658
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,996
I have to go. You two work it out.

659
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,554
- Do you want me to help you?
- Of course.

660
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,432
Then sit down.

661
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,471
You're the only one who understands.

662
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,717
- (glass shatters)
- Ow!

663
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,356
- What is it? What happened?
- Champagne glasses. I sat on them.

664
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,118
- On the chair?
- No. In my pocket!

665
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,718
(band plays in distance)

666
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,155
Sabrina?

667
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,630
Hello.

668
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,190
You did order champagne, didn't you?

669
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,276
- What are you doing here?
- David sent me.

670
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,472
- Isn't he coming?
- I don't think he can make it.

671
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,194
- What happened?
- He got stuck.

672
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,594
Stuck?

673
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,029
Nothing serious.
One of those things.

674
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,672
Shall I serve it up there
or will you come down?

675
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,997
- Up there? Alright.
- No, I'll come down.

676
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,918
We meet under the most peculiar
circumstances.

677
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,112
Either you're under eight cars
looking for a spark plug

678
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:04,314
or you're up here umpiring a tennis
match between two imaginary players.

679
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,750
Oh, you look lovely, Sabrina.
And very grown up.

680
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,111
- I'll get back to the party.
- And leave me here?

681
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,468
What did David say?

682
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,670
I haven't seen him in such a state

683
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,076
since he was kicked in the head
by a polo pony.

684
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,317
- That's nice.
- Amnesia has definitely set in.

685
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,876
He's completely forgotten
he's engaged. He wants you.

686
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,391
And I want him. I've been in love
with him all my life.

687
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,114
- There goes the engagement!
- You don't object?

688
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,518
Object? To you? It's as though
a window had been thrown open

689
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,677
and a lovely breeze swept through
this stuffy house.

690
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,233
How could I object?

691
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,750
Even though the breeze
comes from the garage?

692
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,075
This is the 20th century, Sabrina.

693
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,395
Thank you. Let's drink to that.

694
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,518
Sorry it isn't David here instead
of me. But it's all in the family.

695
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,237
When you walked in

696
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,909
I was sure you'd been sent
by the family to deal with me.

697
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,350
- To deal with you?
- Like in a Viennese operetta.

698
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,438
The young prince falls in love
with a waitress

699
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,869
and the prime minister is sent
to buy her off.

700
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,036
- Buy her off?
- Yes.

701
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,391
He offers her 5,000 kronen.
"No," she says.

702
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,715
"10,000?" "No".

703
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,796
- 15,000 kronen?
- No.

704
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,876
- 25,000 kronen?
- No.

705
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,113
- 25,000 dollars?
- No. How did dollars get into this?

706
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,357
25,000 dollars after taxes,
that's a lot of money.

707
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,833
What are you saying?

708
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,952
I'm making it worthwhile.
What's a krone these days?

709
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,117
No self-respecting prime minister
would offer kronen.

710
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,872
No self-respecting waitress
would take dollars.

711
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,149
Good girl.

712
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:49,559
Say, how does this operetta end?
What's the last act?

713
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,036
I don't know. I guess they run away
to America on a zeppelin

714
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,390
with everybody singing like mad.

715
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,239
- They open a brewery in Milwaukee?
- Yes.

716
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,158
- A love that made Milwaukee famous.
- Prosit.

717
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,236
(band plays)

718
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,438
There it is.

719
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:17,033
The song they were playing
the night before I went away.

720
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,837
David was right here,
dancing it with somebody else.

721
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,195
Tonight, I wanted it to be me.

722
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,797
It's all in the family.

723
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,276
(music continues)

724
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,753
Ow!

725
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,199
How can we make sure that
all the fragments have been removed?

726
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,630
Simple. We will reconstruct
the two champagne glasses.

727
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:11,151
I cannot possibly be hurting you.
The area has been anaesthetised.

728
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,555
It's not you. It's that song.

729
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,229
- Sabrina?
- Hmm?

730
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,239
If David were here now, you'd expect
him to kiss you, wouldn't you?

731
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,679
Hmm.

732
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,191
Here's a kiss from David.

733
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,276
It's all in the family.

734
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,157
(groans)

735
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,952
(knock at door)

736
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,635
- Come in.
- Hi!

737
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,319
How do you feel?

738
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,795
I never felt better in my life.

739
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,514
You look fine.
Has the anaesthetic worn off?

740
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,709
Ow!

741
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,638
I guess it has.
I brought you a present.

742
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,435
What happened last night? Was Sabrina
mad because I didn't show up?

743
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,357
Not mad, just disappointed.

744
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,358
- Poor kid. What did you tell her?
- The truth.

745
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,870
That the family objected to her,
but you stood up like a man,

746
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,956
and sat down like a jerk.

747
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,676
23 stitches.

748
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,234
This ought to make you feel better.

749
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,556
- A plastic hammock?
- Uh-huh.

750
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:18,673
With a trap door. I designed it
and ran it off this morning.

751
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,755
On Sunday?

752
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,350
Why not? You were in pain,
so I had 'em open up the plant.

753
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,549
What a brother!

754
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:28,878
Let's try it on for size.
Come on. On your feet.

755
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,956
(groans)

756
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,436
I'll never drink champagne again.

757
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,794
- What do you think of Sabrina?
- Wonderful girl.

758
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,593
- Were you nice to her?
- As nice as I could be.

759
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:45,714
What a brother. I'm still trying
to finish my poem to her.

760
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,831
What rhymes with glass?

761
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,916
Glass... Glass...

762
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,429
- Alas.
- Of course.

763
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,635
- Right on the nose.
- Linus!

764
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,512
Sorry, David.

765
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,990
If Sabrina were only here.

766
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,990
Hey, how about smuggling her up here?

767
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,031
What if Father sees her?

768
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,632
Yeah, we wouldn't want to spoil it.

769
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:22,036
- No, we sure wouldn't.
- Linus, do me a favour.

770
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,115
Any time.

771
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,471
It's a bore for you,
but could you keep an eye on Sabrina?

772
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,354
I already am. We're going sailing
this afternoon.

773
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,755
- Sailing?
- In your boat.

774
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:38,034
Honest? Oh, Sabrina... Tell her
we'll be off, just the two of us,

775
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,116
the moment the stitches are out.

776
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,028
- You've already made up your mind?
- Absolutely. This is it.

777
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,358
I wanted to make sure.
It's been it three times before.

778
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,517
I was blind. It's been Sabrina
since we were kids.

779
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,039
I just couldn't see it.

780
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,355
What about Elizabeth,
Father and Mother?

781
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,029
Elizabeth will be so broken up
she'll buy three new hats.

782
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:02,630
Mother will go to bed
with a severe headache.

783
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,478
Father will take to the bottle

784
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:08,275
then threaten to exile me
to Larrabee Copper in Butte, Montana.

785
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,358
- That's where you come in.
- How?

786
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:15,155
I don't want to go to Montana.
You are going to help me?

787
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,990
Oh, yes, I'm going to help you,
aren't I...?

788
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,270
What a brother...

789
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,355
(knock at door)

790
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,517
How's my poor darling?

791
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,595
(groans)

792
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,109
I brought you six books and Scrabble.

793
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,276
I'm in no condition to play
Scrabble!

794
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,595
That's all you are
in a condition to do.

795
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,109
Why were those glasses
in your pocket?

796
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:40,676
I was taking them to the tennis
court. Somebody was waiting.

797
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,631
Er, there was a game going on.

798
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,671
In the middle of the night?

799
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,836
That's why he needed the glasses.

800
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,235
Yes, that's why I needed the glasses.

801
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,833
Ow!

802
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,836
- Shall we play three- handed?
- No, I've got to go sailing.

803
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,794
- Yes, he's got to go sailing.
- No more false moves now.

804
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,390
- Yes, Linus.
- We don't want any complications.

805
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,476
So long, Elizabeth.
So long, Scarface.

806
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,679
- Good afternoon, Father.
- I thought it was your mother.

807
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,951
I don't mind your smoking in my room,
but not in my closet.

808
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,550
It's good for the moths.
Now, that girl over the garage...

809
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,990
- David wants to run off with her.
- With the chauffeur's daughter?

810
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:54,671
I don't care who he runs off with so
long as it's not the plastics merger.

811
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:59,999
- It's simple. We'll fire Fairchild.
- Not after 25 years.

812
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,032
Then a nice cheque
will make her forget David.

813
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,913
She doesn't want money,
she wants love.

814
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,076
Didn't they discontinue that model?

815
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,192
The last of the romantics.
L'amour, toujours I'amour.

816
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,756
Why pick on David?
Why not someone else?

817
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,436
We will do our best.

818
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,836
Is that the idea?
Have you got someone in mind for her?

819
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,393
- Yep.
- Who?

820
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,832
# Boola boo-la! Boola boo-la!
Boola boo-la...

821
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,554
- Oh, no!
- What's the matter?

822
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,635
(chuckles)

823
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,638
- Not you, Linus?
- It's no fun for me.

824
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:40,351
I've got a whole deskful of work.
There's the sulphur deal.

825
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,836
The Puerto Rican operation
has to be set in motion.

826
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:48,590
And I'm about to make
an ass of myself with a girl of 22.

827
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,076
Look at me! Joe College,
with a touch of arthritis.

828
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,519
Could you use this,
sailing into the sunset?

829
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,235
- I wish I were dead.
- Just a thought.

830
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,829
Music might help. I had a portable
phonograph in my freshman days.

831
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,633
I only hope you remember
what to do with a girl.

832
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:14,116
It'll come back to me.
It's like riding a bicycle.

833
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:19,035
(man) # Yes, we have no bananas

834
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,431
# We have no bananas today

835
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:28,353
# We've string beans and onions,
cabbages and scallions

836
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,359
# And all kinds of fruit and say...

837
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,278
This is a very unusual song.
Is it popular?

838
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,437
- Oh, yes.
- Why haven't I heard it?

839
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,869
You've been in Paris for two years.

840
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,037
# Yes, we have no bananas

841
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,995
# We have no bananas today

842
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:52,109
- How did they think of those words?
- They are clever, aren't they?

843
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,071
- May I play another?
- Of course.

844
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,112
- You need dusting.
- I beg your pardon?

845
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,470
- I didn't mean you, Linus!
- Thank you.

846
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:04,435
- How's David?
- Better, now he's flat on his back.

847
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:08,189
I miss him.
Not that I'm not having a good time.

848
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,794
(jazz band plays on phonograph)

849
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,276
Sabrina, would you mind if we...
turned this off?

850
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,436
- Why?
- Because.

851
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,558
- Don't you like it?
- I used to like it.

852
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,114
(music stops)

853
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,919
Certain songs
bring back memories to me, too.

854
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,675
Did you love her?

855
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,153
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- I'm sorry.

856
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,554
That's alright.

857
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:45,715
So strange to think of you
being touched by a woman.

858
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,236
I always thought you walked alone.

859
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,870
No man walks alone from choice.

860
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,959
As a child, I used to watch you
from the window over the garage.

861
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,277
Coming and going,
always wearing your black homburg,

862
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,516
carrying a briefcase and an umbrella.

863
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,915
I thought you could never belong
to anyone, never care for anyone.

864
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:12,916
Oh, yes, the cold businessman,
way up in his executive suite.

865
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:17,272
Just ice water in his veins,
ticker tape coming from his heart.

866
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,630
And yet one day,
that same cold businessman,

867
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,591
high up in a skyscraper,

868
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,075
opens the window,
steps out on a ledge,

869
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,471
stands there for three hours,
wondering... if he should jump.

870
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,956
- Because of her?
- No, that was another woman.

871
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:39,152
Sabrina, do you find it
hard to believe

872
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,636
someone might want to blot out
everything, for sentimental reasons?

873
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:47,238
I believe it! It was
for sentimental reasons that I...

874
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,956
I went to Paris to blot it out.

875
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,075
Maybe you should go to Paris.

876
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,077
It helped me.
Have you ever been there?

877
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,988
Oh, yes. Once.
I was there for 35 minutes.

878
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,235
35 minutes?

879
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,999
Changing planes
on my way to Iraq on an oil deal.

880
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,192
But Paris isn't for changing planes.
It's for changing your outlook.

881
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:13,233
For throwing open the windows
and letting in...

882
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,396
letting in
la vie en rose.

883
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:20,992
Paris is for lovers. Maybe
that's why I stayed only 35 minutes.

884
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,354
(dog whines)

885
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,357
Shh!

886
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,675
Hi, David. Hello, Father.

887
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,711
Margaret has some dinner for you
in the kitchen.

888
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,149
Funny. I used to be so afraid of him.

889
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,910
Aren't you hungry?

890
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:18,148
Father, you've driven Linus
for so many years.

891
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,632
What do you know about him?

892
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,354
A chauffeur
keeps his eyes on the road.

893
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:26,836
Only once in a while does he glimpse
in the rear-view mirror.

894
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:31,153
If you looked a little longer,
Father, you'd find him nice.

895
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,232
And quite human.

896
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:48,117
# We have no bananas today...

897
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,194
Good morning, Miss McCardle. First,
a wire to Hannegang, Fort Worth.

898
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:59,751
Unable to attend Larrabee Sulphur
board meeting.

899
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:03,555
Slight hitch plastics merger.
Got that?

900
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:07,514
Next. Here's the itinerary
for tonight.

901
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,551
I want two tickets to
The Seven Year Itch.

902
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,319
Table for two at The Colony
before the show,

903
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:17,719
table for two at The Persian Room
after the show. A corner table, dark.

904
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:23,113
I'm just passing La Guardia field.
Put the coffee on in ten minutes.

905
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,039
- Fairchild, I need you tonight.
- Yes, sir.

906
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:30,152
- I'm taking Sabrina out again.
- Yes, sir.

907
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,271
Would you have her at my office
at seven?

908
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,356
Yes, sir.

909
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,271
Anything wrong, Fairchild?

910
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,996
I would prefer not to be involved
in these dates with my daughter.

911
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,793
It makes for
a rather awkward situation.

912
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:49,038
- That never occurred to me. Sorry.
- It's just not right, sir.

913
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,720
I like to think of life
as a limousine.

914
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,311
We're all driving together, but
there's a front seat, a back seat

915
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,032
and a window in between.

916
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,835
Fairchild, I never realised it,
but you're a terrible snob.

917
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,029
Yes, sir.

918
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:07,790
Alright, have her drive
in herself, in David's car.

919
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,753
Thank you, sir.
It's all so distressing.

920
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,396
First Mr David, now you. I wish
Sabrina had stayed in Paris.

921
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,919
So do I.

922
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:21,158
May I ask, sir,
what exactly are your intentions?

923
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:25,068
My intentions? Unethical,
reprehensible but very practical.

924
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,155
I beg your pardon?

925
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:29,636
With your permission, I'm shipping
your daughter back to Paris.

926
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,274
- You are, sir?
- I'm going to try to.

927
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,958
May I ask how, sir?

928
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,709
First class, of course.
Don't worry about money.

929
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,150
It's not money I'm worried about.
It's Sabrina.

930
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,989
- I don't want her to get hurt.
- I'll be as gentle as I can.

931
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,715
I hope so.
She's just a displaced person.

932
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,876
She doesn't belong in a mansion

933
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,833
but then she doesn't belong
above a garage either.

934
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,833
Alright!

935
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:07,670
The meeting of the board of directors
will now come to order.

936
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,873
As chairman, I would like to say
at the outset...

937
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,273
The chairman is so dizzy.

938
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,628
(giggles)

939
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:20,478
Meeting adjourned.
Have a frozen daiquiri.

940
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:26,315
I once saw an office like this in
Fortune magazine at my dentist's.

941
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,396
Has David got an office like this?

942
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:31,114
- Something like this, only larger.
- Larger?

943
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,674
Instead of a desk,
he has a putting green.

944
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,758
Please,
before my fingers get frostbitten.

945
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,439
- Is this the ledge?
- What ledge?

946
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,319
You know, the ledge. That woman.
When you almost...

947
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:59,428
Oh, the ledge. Yes.
Yes, that's the ledge alright.

948
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,869
What made you not do it?

949
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,992
There were some children playing
hopscotch on the sidewalk.

950
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,588
I'm very fond of those children.

951
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:13,078
Look at all these gadgets. You press
a button and factories go up.

952
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:17,751
Or you pick up a telephone
and 100 tankers set out for Persia.

953
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,598
Or through a Dictaphone you say,

954
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:23,030
"Buy all of Cleveland
and move it to Pittsburgh".

955
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,354
You must be clever.

956
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,155
It's just a knack,
like juggling three oranges.

957
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,909
It isn't oranges, it's millions.
Suppose you dropped one?

958
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:37,194
Suppose I did? What's at the end
of a million? Nothing. A circle.

959
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,271
- Sabrina...
- Yes, Linus?

960
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:45,154
Can you keep a secret?
Yes, of course you can.

961
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,356
I want you to look out there. Uptown.

962
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,878
- You see the French Line pier?
- Yes.

963
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,389
- You see the boat?
- Yes.

964
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:02,433
That's the Liberté. It sails on
Thursday. I'm going to be on it.

965
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,510
- You are?
- Yes, I am.

966
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:09,553
I'm sick of pushing buttons in this
office. I'm breaking out, Sabrina.

967
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,830
- I'm running away.
- Good for you!

968
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,316
I've been thinking about Paris
ever since you mentioned it.

969
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:19,638
It'll make a new person out of you.
You'll double your money back.

970
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,398
I'm so glad you're going.

971
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,315
Or am I?

972
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:34,630
It's 7:35, Mr Larrabee. You have
a reservation at The Colony.

973
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,716
Thank you.

974
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,549
Ready, Sabrina?

975
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,636
Tout de suite,
as they say in Paris.

976
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:46,435
Curtain is at 8:40. I used your
brother's name at The Colony,

977
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,632
to get the darkest corner!
(titters)

978
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,069
I'm sorry, Mr Larrabee.

979
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,631
This is what you do
on your very first day in Paris.

980
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,799
You get yourself, not a drizzle,
but some honest-to-goodness rain,

981
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,718
and you find yourself
someone really nice

982
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:16,310
and drive her through
the Bois de Boulogne in a taxi.

983
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,829
The rain's very important.

984
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,713
That's when Paris smells
its sweetest.

985
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,196
- It's the damp chestnut trees.
- I see.

986
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,914
You're very clever, Linus,
and very rich.

987
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,190
You can order yourself some rain.

988
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:35,633
Sure. I can order myself some rain,
I can get myself a taxi.

989
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,478
That's easy.

990
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,309
But can I find myself
someone really nice?

991
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,396
That's not so easy, Sabrina.

992
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,116
(band plays La Vie En Rose)

993
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:16,072
How do you say in French,
my sister has a yellow pencil?

994
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,836
Ma soeur a un crayon jaune.

995
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:23,635
How do you say,
my brother has a lovely girl?

996
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:27,955
Mon frère a une gentille petite amie.

997
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,436
And how do you say,
I wish I were my brother?

998
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,915
(band plays La Vie En Rose)

999
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:47,358
# II me dit des mots d'amour

1000
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:51,314
# Des mots de tous les jours

1001
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:56,958
# Et ça me fait quelque chose

1002
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:02,557
# II est entré dans mon coeur

1003
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:06,229
# Une part de bonheur...

1004
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,396
Why are you looking at me that way?

1005
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,796
All night I've had a terrible impulse
to do something.

1006
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:16,072
Never resist an impulse, Sabrina,
especially if it's terrible.

1007
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,156
I'm going to do it.

1008
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,832
- There.
- What's that for?

1009
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,428
You can't go walking up
the Champs Elysées

1010
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,710
looking like a tourist undertaker!

1011
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,434
And another thing,
never a briefcase in Paris

1012
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,676
and never an umbrella. There's a law.

1013
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:35,911
How will I get along in Paris
without someone like you?

1014
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,315
Who'll be there
to help me with my French,

1015
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:40,795
to turn down the brim of my hat?

1016
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:46,358
Suppose you meet someone on the boat,
the first day? A perfect stranger.

1017
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,270
I have a better suppose, Sabrina.

1018
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:55,550
Suppose I were ten years younger
and you weren't in love with David.

1019
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,558
Suppose I asked you to...

1020
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,950
I suppose I'm just talking nonsense.

1021
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,353
I suppose so.

1022
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,799
Suppose you sing that song again.
Slowly.

1023
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:21,909
# Quand il me prend dans ses bras

1024
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,230
# Et me parle tout bas

1025
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,874
# Je vois la vie en rose

1026
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:36,439
# II me dit des mots d'amour

1027
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,516
(continues song)

1028
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,912
# II est entré dans mon coeur

1029
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:57,512
# Une part de bonheur dontje...

1030
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,229
Hi! I thought you two had eloped.
I wouldn't mind, but not in my car.

1031
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,952
- Hello, David.
- Did you have a good time?

1032
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,513
- So-so.
- Where did you go?

1033
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,313
We saw The Seven Year Itch
and went on to The Persian Room.

1034
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,034
- Lousy dancer, isn't he?
- So-so.

1035
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,038
I bet he slept through the show
then bent your ears

1036
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:22,197
about Dow Jones averages
and profits taxes.

1037
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,276
We talked about a lot of things.

1038
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,951
How's your little, er, mishap?

1039
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:32,473
Shaping up beautifully. Dr Calaway
wants to show it to his class.

1040
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,915
- I'm sorry, Sabrina.
- It's very funny.

1041
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:39,874
Say, Linus, while I was lying
in that hammock I got a great idea.

1042
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,878
He thinks I'm an idiot.
How does this strike you?

1043
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,070
Plastic champagne glasses,
just in case.

1044
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,272
Brilliant.
What else did Dr Calaway say?

1045
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,960
- Stitches come out Thursday.
- Thursday?

1046
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,071
- I'm a fast healer.
- You sure are.

1047
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,077
So if you two
have long-range plans...

1048
01:19:55,200 --> 01:20:00,513
I thought she'd like to see the
Stock Exchange and our Jersey plant.

1049
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,312
Oh, I don't think so.

1050
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,874
Then we'll just have dinner
and go to a show.

1051
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,356
But that's all. Come Thursday,
the first team takes over.

1052
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,152
What's with the homburg?

1053
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,475
I guess the undertaker
had better turn in.

1054
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,479
You'd better crawl back
into that hole in your hammock.

1055
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,717
- Au revoir, Sabrina.
- Good night, Linus.

1056
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:38,713
He's a little on the dull side,
but you can't help liking him.

1057
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,351
- Kiss me, David.
- I'd love to, Sabrina.

1058
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,473
Again.

1059
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:53,915
That's better.

1060
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:57,715
What's the matter?
You're not worried about us? I'm not.

1061
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,910
There'll be a big stink. Who cares?

1062
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:03,749
David, I don't think
I'm going to have dinner with Linus.

1063
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,440
- I don't want to go out with him.
- Why not?

1064
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,879
I want to be near you.

1065
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,639
I know how you feel.
It must be an awful bore.

1066
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:13,558
But if Linus wants to take you out,
be nice about it.

1067
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:15,915
It's important. He's our only ally.

1068
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,315
Father will try
to cut off my allowance

1069
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,954
and send me to Larrabee Copper
in Butte, Montana.

1070
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,753
We don't want to go
to Butte, Montana, do we?

1071
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,836
Hold me close, David.

1072
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,960
We'll have a wonderful time, darling.

1073
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:34,278
We'll build a raft and drift
across the Pacific like Kon-Tiki.

1074
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,358
Or climb the highest mountain,
like Annapurna,

1075
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,072
just the two of us.

1076
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:42,237
Keep talking, David.

1077
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:51,954
We thought pink roses for the cherubs
and white gardenias for the names.

1078
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:55,595
It'll take 2,000 gardenias.
We'll float it in our pool.

1079
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,756
- Indoor or outdoor?
- Outdoor.

1080
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,474
We drained the indoor
to make room for presents.

1081
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,352
Where's the provision determining

1082
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,358
the ratio of investment
to controlling interest?

1083
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:08,199
Page 62, paragraph six,
subdivision B.

1084
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:11,278
- Father, where's the list?
- Here you are, darling.

1085
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,789
Would you like to see
the invitation list?

1086
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,716
(Tyson mumbles)

1087
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,796
(banging)

1088
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,077
...740 under trust of Illinois, 550...

1089
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,436
The way this merger's worked out,

1090
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:02,518
I have all the titles
and you have all the controls.

1091
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,995
I always make it a point
to have controls.

1092
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,953
It's your good luck
the kids are fond of each other.

1093
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,957
I make it a point to be lucky, too.

1094
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,709
Come along, Father. Linus,
you won't forget the gardenias?

1095
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,193
Tony has a sweet idea.

1096
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,357
He'll fly over the chapel
and throw rice from his plane.

1097
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:22,393
With David the bridegroom,
maybe he'd better use wild rice.

1098
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:42,709
All I can say is
David better show up at this wedding.

1099
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,637
I have a horrible vision
of Elizabeth waiting at the altar,

1100
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:50,673
and 2,000 gardenias floating
in the pool spelling "disaster".

1101
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,952
Memo to Miss McCardle. First,
call Brunson in Larrabee Shipping.

1102
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,672
We need 2,000 gardenias.

1103
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,439
Tell him to start
cornering the market.

1104
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,516
We're not having trouble with...

1105
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,790
I can't remember
that garage girl's name.

1106
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:04,955
Sabrina.

1107
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,719
What right has a chauffeur got
to call her that?

1108
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,512
What would you suggest? Ethel?

1109
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:13,349
You've taken her out three nights in
a row. Is that situation in hand?

1110
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:17,029
I think so. It's resolving itself
into a straight export deal.

1111
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,720
I want two accommodations
on the Liberté.

1112
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,230
One in the name of Sabrina Fairchild.
One in my name.

1113
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,397
What? You and that girl
going off on a boat together?

1114
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,988
Have I spawned two idiot sons?

1115
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:33,193
Who said I was going? She is going.
She'll think I am, but I'm not.

1116
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,470
- Is that clear?
- It is not!

1117
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,239
I'll tell Sabrina
that I'll meet her on the boat.

1118
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:42,114
When the boat is ten miles out,
she'll find out I'm not on the boat.

1119
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:44,629
My cabin will be empty.
Just a note of apology

1120
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,830
and a few presents
to soften the blow.

1121
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,758
- Excellent.
- Yes, I thought you'd like it.

1122
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:53,475
Miss McCardle, I want flowers
in Miss Fairchild's cabin.

1123
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,068
Candy, fruit
and the usual what-have- yous.

1124
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,829
Cable Michot to get her
a car in Paris. Also an apartment.

1125
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:02,349
A letter of credit on our Paris bank.

1126
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,835
- She can draw up to 50,000.
- Easy, now.

1127
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:09,272
Transfer to Thomas Fairchild
1,000 shares, Larrabee Common.

1128
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,913
1,000 shares?

1129
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,634
Make it 1,500 shares,
Larrabee Preferred.

1130
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,830
There must be a less extravagant way

1131
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:18,872
of getting a chauffeur's daughter
out of one's hair.

1132
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,595
How would you do it? You can't even
get a little olive out of a jar.

1133
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,388
Eat it.

1134
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,318
Going up?

1135
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:09,873
No, thank you.

1136
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,472
(buzzer)

1137
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,795
- Yes?
- Miss Fairchild for you.

1138
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:36,196
- Send her in.
- She's on the phone. It's on five.

1139
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,671
Sabrina? What happened to you?
It's twenty past eight.

1140
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,314
Good evening, Linus. I know I'm late.

1141
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,159
I guess I should have
called you earlier.

1142
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:49,872
I can't see you tonight.

1143
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,516
I'm sorry. I just can't make it.
I tried but I'm all tied up.

1144
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:57,552
No, I'm not in Long Island.
I'm in New York.

1145
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,155
Downtown in a phone booth.
In a building.

1146
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:06,191
What difference does it make
what building?

1147
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,072
I can't see you tonight.

1148
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:12,670
Alright, it's the Larrabee Building,
but I'm not coming up.

1149
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,712
Look, Sabrina, suppose you tell me

1150
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,196
exactly what's on your mind,
slowly and clearly?

1151
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,311
You talk and I'll listen.

1152
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:26,393
It was really David's idea
I go out with you.

1153
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,556
He wants you to help him.

1154
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:31,877
But it's not helping me.
I shouldn't have been seeing you.

1155
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,230
I shouldn't be talking to you
on the phone.

1156
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:37,557
In fact, I'm really only calling
to say goodbye.

1157
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,558
Tomorrow,
you'll be on the boat to Paris.

1158
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:43,478
In a way, I'm glad you're going.

1159
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,955
You do know what I mean,
don't you?

1160
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,674
Linus? Hello, Linus?

1161
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,113
Where are you?

1162
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:56,192
- Your three minutes are up.
- Hello.

1163
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:00,392
It's silly. I was talking to myself.

1164
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,875
You've wasted a dime, too. Come on.

1165
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:09,639
You're not angry? I have a perfectly
good reason why I shouldn't see you.

1166
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,716
Not here, Sabrina.

1167
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:28,475
Alright, Sabrina,

1168
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:32,878
what is that perfectly good reason
why you shouldn't see me?

1169
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:43,913
What is it? What's bothering you?

1170
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,396
It's me that's bothering me.

1171
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,518
Please don't.

1172
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,512
I'm sorry.

1173
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,999
I know I'm not making much sense,
Linus.

1174
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:05,954
- Would you like a drink?
- I don't think I want a drink.

1175
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,436
I think I do.

1176
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,875
- Why don't you sit down?
- I can only stay a minute.

1177
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,992
- Mind if I turn on this little one?
- If you want.

1178
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:26,518
I'd hate to fix myself a martini
with crème de menthe.

1179
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,596
(buzzer)

1180
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,075
Yes?

1181
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:36,829
I cancelled your dinner reservation.
What about the theatre tickets?

1182
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,239
I couldn't possibly go anywhere.

1183
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,631
They're all yours, Miss McCardle.
Good night.

1184
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:51,196
You're sure you won't have even one?

1185
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:54,153
- No, thanks.
- You must be hungry.

1186
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:58,755
- I hadn't thought about it.
- Well, I'm starved.

1187
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:02,270
I was sort of saving myself
for 21 tonight.

1188
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,391
I've spoiled your evening.

1189
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,318
No, you haven't.
We can have dinner right here.

1190
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,954
Let's see what Miss McCardle
is hoarding.

1191
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:13,629
Probably maraschino cherries
and stale crackers.

1192
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:17,750
Tomato juice, puffed rice, sardines,

1193
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,836
tomato juice.

1194
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:22,155
That's an awful lot
of tomato juice.

1195
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,316
Could you fix something
out of this?

1196
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:27,989
I suppose so. I'm a graduate cook.
I have a diploma.

1197
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:30,076
It'll take a diploma.

1198
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:43,990
I wanted to be so sure
I couldn't go out with you tonight.

1199
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,793
And here I am cooking for you.

1200
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,593
I guess
maybe I should have worn an apron.

1201
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,836
One apron, coming up.

1202
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:58,159
Pots. Pans. Can opener. Stove.

1203
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:00,635
All the comforts of home.

1204
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:04,196
Miss McCardle cooked dinner here
for the board of directors.

1205
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,039
After the first course,
there was a move to adjourn.

1206
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,515
It was passed unanimously.

1207
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,752
What do we start with?

1208
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,400
I haven't decided yet. (sniffs)

1209
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:26,030
Now, Sabrina,
let's have none of those.

1210
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,835
- I'm so ashamed, Linus.
- You have no reason to be.

1211
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:38,789
I've known you
just a few days, really.

1212
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,992
And I've been in love with David
all my life.

1213
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:46,431
I can't understand
what's the matter with me.

1214
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:50,950
I went away to grow up
and I thought I had grown up.

1215
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,230
I guess I haven't, really.

1216
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:56,477
I just got myself a new hairdo,
that's all.

1217
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:02,597
- Please say something.
- Like what?

1218
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:06,872
I don't know.
Tell me I'm imagining things.

1219
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:12,475
Tell me you never thought of taking
me on the boat to Paris with you.

1220
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,670
Tell me to put on my coat
and go home

1221
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:17,234
before I make a complete fool
of myself.

1222
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:24,191
Don't let me go home.
I couldn't bear it.

1223
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:26,993
This is the last time
we'll see each other.

1224
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:34,714
- I'll behave. I'm alright now.
- That's good. How about dinner?

1225
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:39,391
I just remembered I didn't have
any lunch today. Or any breakfast.

1226
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,988
That may account for a lot of things.

1227
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,875
Would you like a soufflé for dessert?

1228
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,513
Out of tomato juice?

1229
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:50,428
- Out of crackers, of course.
- Not too soggy.

1230
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,028
You'd better get out of the kitchen.

1231
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,236
Which one is the Liberté?

1232
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:25,397
- The one on the right.
- Are you sure?

1233
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,717
- You mustn't take the wrong boat.
- I'll try not to.

1234
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:32,276
You haven't forgotten
my instructions, have you?

1235
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,436
Never an umbrella in Paris,

1236
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,870
and under all circumstances
rain the very first day.

1237
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,560
I haven't forgotten a word, Sabrina.

1238
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,716
My sister has a yellow pencil.

1239
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:45,638
Ma soeur a un crayon jaune.

1240
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,716
Very good. Très bien.

1241
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,996
Watch. One, two, three, crack.

1242
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,910
New egg. It's all in the wrist.

1243
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:07,399
There must be an egg beater
somewhere.

1244
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,193
Linus!

1245
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:47,837
Why didn't you tell me? You do want
to take me with you, don't you?

1246
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:56,236
These don't mean
what you think they mean.

1247
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:59,272
I know why you didn't tell me.
You think it's wrong.

1248
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,039
They'll say I'm too young,
there'll be a scandal,

1249
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,071
and the market will go down.

1250
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:08,193
Linus Larrabee Esquire
is taking me to Paris.

1251
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:14,874
Sabrina, I... wasn't going
to take you to Paris.

1252
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,352
I was going to send you.

1253
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:23,478
- Alone?
- Yes, all alone.

1254
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:28,958
But there's a ticket for you.

1255
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:31,036
For an empty cabin.

1256
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,116
- You were joining me in Paris?
- I'm afraid not.

1257
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:45,319
- I think I understand.
- I'm sorry.

1258
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:50,518
But why? Why did you do it, Linus?

1259
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:53,837
High finance. Expansion.
Marriage. A merger.

1260
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:57,509
A new plaque on the Larrabee
Building. You got in the way.

1261
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:59,232
- David?
- That's right.

1262
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:05,156
How inconsiderate of me.

1263
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,914
And how inconvenient for you,

1264
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:12,919
such a busy man, having to waste
so much time to get me on a boat.

1265
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,593
I'm ashamed to say
I enjoyed every minute of it.

1266
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,710
And I suppose, in your empty cabin,

1267
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:23,115
there would have been
a farewell note,

1268
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:26,710
dictated to and typed by
Miss McCardle?

1269
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,388
- And perhaps a few flowers.
- A little more than that.

1270
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,475
A letter of credit.
An apartment in Paris. A car.

1271
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:48,593
1,500 shares of Larrabee Preferred
for your father.

1272
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,278
You're very generous.

1273
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:53,790
We regard it
as a necessary business expense.

1274
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:57,515
I'll just take one of those tickets.

1275
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,676
I was happy in Paris.

1276
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:07,755
I think you would have been, too.

1277
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:18,316
Good night, Mr Larrabee.

1278
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,558
I'm sorry I can't stay
to do the dishes.

1279
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:46,199
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1280
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,476
(buzzing)

1281
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,511
- Mr Larrabee?
- Come in, Miss McCardle.

1282
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:09,556
- Good morning.
- You're late.

1283
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:12,069
I had to make my own coffee.
Worst ever.

1284
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:16,432
- Sorry. I had a very bad night.
- I know exactly how you feel.

1285
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,870
You better get that pad.
We have things to do.

1286
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,116
I used your theatre tickets
and took my mother.

1287
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:24,879
Are you ready?
Call Larrabee Shipping.

1288
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,356
Tell them to radio our tankers
bound for Puerto Rico to turn back.

1289
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:31,751
Tell Larrabee Construction
to stop work on the plant.

1290
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:35,350
- We're cancelling the merger.
- We are?

1291
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,391
I want Mr Larrabee Senior,

1292
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:40,956
Mr Tyson and Miss Elizabeth Tyson
here in this office.

1293
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:43,275
Get a large bottle
of smelling salts.

1294
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,675
- We're calling off the wedding.
- We are?

1295
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:49,839
When's your mother's birthday?
I'm sending her 2,000 gardenias.

1296
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,757
Here's a ticket for the Liberté.

1297
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:54,030
Transfer it to the name
of David Larrabee.

1298
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:56,628
Get his passport out.
Make sure it's in order.

1299
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:59,672
Locate David. The boat sails at noon.

1300
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,189
I've called the house
and he isn't there.

1301
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,232
Try Dr Calaway.
Try everywhere, but get him.

1302
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:08,272
Do you want me to send those presents
to Miss Fairchild's cabin?

1303
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:12,109
- No. We're sending David instead.
- Good morning.

1304
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:17,032
The stitches are out.
It's as good as new.

1305
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:19,515
Congratulations.
I've been looking for you.

1306
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:21,312
I've been looking for you.

1307
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:24,591
- You're leaving for Paris today.
- No kidding?

1308
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:27,518
With Sabrina.
She's going to be on the boat.

1309
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:31,557
Uh-huh?
Does she have to be in here?

1310
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:35,116
Alright, Miss McCardle.
You've got a lot of work to do.

1311
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:37,674
Aren't you pleased?
What's the matter?

1312
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:41,873
I saw Sabrina when she came home
last night. Found her packing.

1313
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,115
What did she say?

1314
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:45,800
- Nothing. She just kissed me.
- What's wrong with that?

1315
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,196
I may know nothing about Dow Jones
but I know about kisses.

1316
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:52,039
You could lecture on that at Vassar.

1317
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:54,628
This one tasted like a goodbye kiss.

1318
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:58,958
- You're just imagining things.
- No, it had a few tears in it.

1319
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:03,957
It took me until this morning
to add two and two together,

1320
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:07,914
like two champagne glasses
and the plastics deal and Sabrina.

1321
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,598
- You know what I got?
- What?

1322
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:14,474
Sorry to do it
to a tired businessman.

1323
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:18,479
That's alright.
Well, now we're even.

1324
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:23,557
Go home and start packing.
I'll take care of Elizabeth.

1325
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,113
I'm calling off the merger.

1326
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:27,754
Miss McCardle has your passport
and ticket.

1327
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:29,279
Let her know if you need money.

1328
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:33,757
I want you and Sabrina to have
a good time in Paris. Goodbye.

1329
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:36,474
What makes you so sure
Sabrina still wants me?

1330
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,716
She's wanted you all her life.

1331
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:41,035
Until you came along
in that silly homburg.

1332
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:44,436
Straighten that silly hat and go.
You'll miss the boat.

1333
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:48,477
Don't worry, I won't miss the boat.
I'm going.

1334
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,753
Funniest thing.

1335
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:55,190
Linus Larrabee, the man
who doesn't burn, scorch or melt,

1336
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:58,630
throws a $20-million deal
out the window.

1337
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,516
Are you sure
you don't want to go with her?

1338
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,358
Why should I want to go with her?

1339
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,672
You're in love with her.

1340
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:18,956
You won't be annoyed if I cry
at the boat, will you, Sabrina?

1341
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:21,674
I'll be disappointed
if you don't, Father.

1342
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:25,679
I'd feel better if you'd be angry
with me for allowing this to happen.

1343
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:28,758
It wasn't your fault, Father.
It was mine.

1344
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,272
I should have believed you.

1345
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:35,868
There's a front seat
and a back seat

1346
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,070
(both) and a window in between.

1347
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:42,756
If it's any consolation,
one good thing's come out of it.

1348
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:45,440
You did get over David, didn't you?

1349
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:50,475
Dear David.
Yes, I did get over that. I'm cured.

1350
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:53,996
Now, how to get over the cure!

1351
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,990
It wouldn't have worked out really.

1352
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:00,918
The papers would have said
how fine and democratic

1353
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,838
for a Larrabee
to marry the chauffeur's daughter.

1354
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:07,077
But would they praise
the chauffeur's daughter? No.

1355
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:11,193
Democracy can be
a wickedly unfair thing.

1356
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:14,437
Nobody poor
was ever called democratic

1357
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,516
for marrying somebody rich.

1358
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:42,432
Why don't we start this meeting
and sign the papers?

1359
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,630
We're waiting for David, of course.

1360
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:47,399
That boy has no sense of time,
of direction.

1361
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,637
As a matter of fact,
he has no sense. Where is he?

1362
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:52,716
We'll get to that in a minute.

1363
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:57,159
Here are the smelling salts.
I got you the largest size.

1364
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:59,232
(ship's horn)

1365
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:03,834
Look what I bought him
for Waikiki Beach.

1366
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:05,632
I hope they're loud enough.

1367
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:09,677
- I hope they're returnable.
- (ship's horn)

1368
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:21,519
I see no need for any further delay.
Suppose we get down to business?

1369
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:23,551
What about David?

1370
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:26,114
That's a very good question. Not yet.

1371
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:31,392
Mr Tyson, members of the board...
Are you with us, Father?

1372
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:33,713
Present.

1373
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:39,716
We are here to put our signatures
to the Larrabee- Tyson merger.

1374
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,991
Much effort has gone into making
this union possible.

1375
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:46,556
Long hours.
Many obstacles to overcome.

1376
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:48,989
Nobody knows better than I.

1377
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:51,270
However... Not yet.

1378
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:56,035
However, sometimes even the most
conscientious of businessmen

1379
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:59,391
can botch up a deal
for one reason or another.

1380
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:04,150
Understand, I don't mean to say
that our merger has hit a snag,

1381
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:05,872
or failed to gel,

1382
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,310
or gone up in smoke,
or fallen through.

1383
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:13,319
Let me put it this way, gentlemen.
It has sailed away.

1384
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,396
(ship's horn)

1385
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:20,993
I seem to have missed something.
Would you mind starting again?

1386
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:24,954
Now, Miss McCardle.
Elizabeth, I hate to break the news,

1387
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:28,277
but at this very moment,
your fiancé, David Larrabee...

1388
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,356
Is late, as usual.

1389
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:38,393
Hello, everybody. Hello, darling.
Hello, Linus. How are you?

1390
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,431
What are you doing here?

1391
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:44,439
I heard there was a board meeting.
Where are the contracts?

1392
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,711
- Where's Sabrina?
- Sabrina? Who's Sabrina?

1393
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:50,638
- That name!
- She's on the boat, I guess.

1394
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:53,228
- But the boat has sailed.
- (ship's horn)

1395
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,112
- And there she goes.
- Who goes?

1396
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:57,276
- Sabrina.
- Who is Sabrina?

1397
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:00,039
- Why did you do it?
- Do what?

1398
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,912
She's all alone out there.

1399
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:04,554
Not according
to the afternoon papers.

1400
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:07,240
It says here that Linus Larrabee,
that's you,

1401
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:09,396
and Sabrina Fairchild, that's she,

1402
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:13,149
have reserved adjacent deck chairs
on the Liberté, sailing today.

1403
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:16,909
All columnists should be beaten
to a pulp and converted into paper.

1404
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:18,473
Did you plant this?

1405
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:22,195
Me? I thought it was common knowledge
about you and Sabrina.

1406
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:23,992
Who is Sabrina?

1407
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:28,918
Our chauffeur's daughter,
that's who. How about that?

1408
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:33,158
Linus Larrabee, wizard of finance,
chairman of the board,

1409
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:36,033
getting mixed up
with his chauffeur's daughter.

1410
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:37,593
That's enough, David.

1411
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:40,518
She went after me,
but she switched to Linus.

1412
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:43,234
I guess it's because
he's got more money.

1413
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,157
We know about those kind of girls.

1414
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:48,716
Believe me, this one is no different,
just seems to be.

1415
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:50,478
I said that's enough.

1416
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:53,637
Maybe you got smart.
Or maybe you just got lucky,

1417
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:57,036
because you're here
and she's out there.

1418
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:59,469
She would have taken you for plenty.

1419
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:06,879
I was just helping you
make up your mind.

1420
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,956
You are in love with her!

1421
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:13,756
What are you waiting for?

1422
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:18,758
There's an elevator outside,
a police escort downstairs

1423
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,552
and a tugboat standing by.

1424
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,072
Get moving!

1425
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:28,990
If you'll excuse me, it appears
I have a previous engagement.

1426
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:32,999
That's the 20th century for you.
Automobiles. Garages.

1427
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:35,634
Chauffeurs. Chauffeurs' daughters!

1428
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:43,033
Inasmuch as I seem to be the only
member of the Larrabee family

1429
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:44,718
who is not out of his mind,

1430
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:48,515
I will take it upon myself
to call this meeting back to order

1431
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:52,713
as soon as David Larrabee
removes his carcass from this table.

1432
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:54,717
Sit down, Father.

1433
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:56,193
(glass shatters)

1434
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:58,593
The olives!

1435
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:06,479
(boat's horn)

1436
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,276
(ship's horn)

1437
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,994
Miss Fairchild?
II y a un monsieur sur le bateau

1438
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:52,635
qui voudrait bien que vous lui
arrangiez son chapeau.

1439
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:05,196
- Voilà.
- Merci beaucoup.
