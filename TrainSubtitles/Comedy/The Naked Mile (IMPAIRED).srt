What? Why?

Because, if she would just give up
a little ass,

then maybe you wouldn't be killing

Nothing's wrong.

I don't know why you think
you have this psychic ability to read me.

Because I do. What is it?

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,557
You're gonna think I'm an asshole.
Let's just forget about it.

Come on, Erik, you know you can talk to me
about anything.

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,993
All right.

140
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,473
It's the sex.

141
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,715
I mean,

142
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,872
we've been together for two years.
Two years, Trace.

143
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,235
I mean, when we were juniors,
it was one thing,

144
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,912
but we're seniors now,
and this whole virgin thing

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,389
is starting to have
some serious consequences.

146
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,391
I mean, people are dying.

147
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,238
I told you, I'm not ready yet.

148
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,276
I am so ready.

149
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,795
Can't I be ready enough for the both of us?

150
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,711
It doesn't work that way.

151
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,313
It should.

152
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,229
I'm sorry, Erik.
I know how patient you've been.

153
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,550
I know. It's just sometimes...

154
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,029
What?

155
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,029
Well, you're a girl.
It's a lot easier for you to be a virgin

156
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,918
because the longer you stay a virgin,
the more pure and innocent you seem.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,319
The longer I stay a virgin,

158
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,836
the more I become the laughingstock
of the entire school.

159
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,077
I'm sorry, but... I mean...

160
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,912
I'm sorry I brought it up.

161
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,632
(BELL RINGING)

162
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,995
I gotta go. I'll see you after school.

163
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,115
Okay.

164
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,349
Bye.

165
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,078
I'm telling you, his dick was this big.

166
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,029
NATALIE: What about Erik?
I bet he's got a big one.

167
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,997
Well, Tracy wouldn't know.

168
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,069
Whatever.

169
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,719
Yeah, I guess it's pretty hard
to figure out dick size from dry humping.

170
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,074
Brooke, that's mean.

171
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,072
Just because I don't have a catalog
of the school's dick sizes like you,

172
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,116
doesn't mean I don't know a thing or two.

173
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,998
Okay, so how big is Erik's?

174
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,635
See? Told you.

175
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,039
Come on, Brooke.

176
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,553
It's not like that with us.

177
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,835
I mean, Erik's different.
He respects my boundaries.

178
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,876
Well, you better give that boy
a reason to stick around,

179
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,474
or he's gonna find a girl
with looser boundaries.

180
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,995
Erik would never do that.

181
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,638
Yeah, that's what you said about Trent.

182
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,076
He broke up with you over sex,
and that was sophomore year.

183
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,038
Yeah, this just isn't gonna
work without the sex.

184
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,434
God, Trent is cute,
and I heard he just broke up with Holly.

185
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,279
Look, Tracy, we love you, and we love Erik,
but let's get real.

186
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,109
He's a guy, and guys have certain needs.

187
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,875
They really do.
It's like a caveman thing or something.

188
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,350
Yeah, I can't believe
you've kept him tied up this long.

189
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,310
Hey, Erik, guess who I just talked to?

190
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,435
Who?

191
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,476
Your cousin Stifler up at Michigan.

192
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,913
Why are you talking to my cousin Dwight?

193
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,991
Oh, we talk all the time.

194
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,399
What? We have a lot in common.

195
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,232
What's that crazy bastard up to?

196
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,915
He's in some fraternity,
and all those guys do is drink and fuck.

197
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,639
And it just so happens that they're throwing
a monster party this weekend

198
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,755
for the Naked Mile.

199
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,909
What's the Naked Mile?

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,718
Oh, dude, it's this thing
where thousands of students

201
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,119
run naked through campus.

202
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,316
It's the way of blowing off
steam after exams.

203
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,118
Thousands of naked chicks?

204
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,078
Stifler says that this party is gonna be epic.

205
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,230
Bottom line is, this place is played out.

206
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,594
High school's over for us.

207
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,557
It's time to plant our flag in a new land.

208
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,350
Porn, cumshot, dead grandmother,
grounded forever?

209
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,475
Don't worry.

210
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,711
Just tell your parents that, you know,
you're thinking about going to school there.

211
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,631
- I don't know, man.
- Oh, please.

212
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,234
Your mom cried when you told her
you were going to school in Boston.

213
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,914
She'll probably help you pack
if she thinks it'll keep you close to home.

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,194
I'll help you pack.

215
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,874
I'll make sandwiches.

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,035
Chicken salad?

217
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,155
Of course.

218
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,151
Are you gonna get a chance
to see your cousin?

219
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,993
Yeah. We might stop by and say hello.

220
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,833
Now, there's someone you
should definitely look up to.

221
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,195
I bet he doesn't have time
to blow his load on his family.

222
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,952
- Harry, please.
- HARRY: I don't understand.

223
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,112
When I was your age,
I was up to my neck in poontang.

224
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,556
I didn't have time to spank my monkey.

225
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,871
Thank you for that very
disturbing image, Dad.

226
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,669
I mean, Stiflers do not fake
being sick to stay home and pull dick.

227
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,829
We cut class to get ass.

228
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,195
Yes, I know.
That saying is on our family crest.

229
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,077
Oh, don't let me forget
to pack the Imodium AD.

230
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,434
You know, just in case you get diarrhea.

231
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,351
- Mom.
- I am so excited.

232
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,429
Aren't you excited, Harry?

233
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,158
I'm very excited.

234
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,672
Don't you get excited.

235
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,079
<i>ERIK: It worked
just like you said.</i>

236
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,993
She's helping me pack,
and she's even making us sandwiches.

237
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,479
<i>- Chicken salad?
- Yup.</i>

238
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,629
Sweet.

239
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,392
See, I told you. Never doubt me.

240
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,036
<i>RYAN: Man, this weekend is gonna be tits.
I can't wait to see Stifler.</i>

241
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,359
Hey, how come you never call me Stifler?

242
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,273
You're more of an Erik.

243
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,469
(BEEPING)

244
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,754
Hold on.

245
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,839
That's Tracy. I'd better take it.

246
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,955
All right, later.

247
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,149
Hey, sweetie.
Listen, about today, I'm really...

248
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,276
Erik, I wanna have sex.

249
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,195
Excuse me?

250
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,830
<i>TRACY: I wanna have sex.</i>

251
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,989
Are you serious?

252
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,354
Absolutely.

253
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,913
Do you have me on a conference call?
Because if you do, that is so not cool.

254
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,592
Erik, this isn't a joke.

255
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,350
I want to have sex.

256
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,308
Yes! Yes, yes.

257
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,875
<i>TRACY: Tonight.</i>

258
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,995
What?

259
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,389
Tonight. I wanna have sex tonight.

260
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,393
How am I supposed to get out of my house?

261
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,833
<i>That's up to you.</i>

262
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,555
But at midnight, I'll be in my basement

263
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,198
waiting to be ravished.

264
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,834
I'll be there.

265
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,434
Hypocrite.

266
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,073
So you get the beer and the weed,
and I'll handle the nitrous.

267
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,957
You got it. What's Erik bringing?

268
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,155
Sandwiches.

269
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,710
Nice. Chicken salad and college pussy.

270
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,358
My favorite combination.

271
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,158
Yeah, well, at least you'll get to taste
the chicken salad.

272
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,355
<i>Ow.</i>

273
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,192
Hey, what do you think Erik's doing
right now?

274
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,396
Probably beating off to dumpster porn.

275
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,470
No more beating off to dumpster porn.
No more virgin jokes.

276
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,790
Tonight, Erik Stifler becomes a man.

277
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,112
- Hi.
- Come on in.

278
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,194
- All right, listen.
- No.

279
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,353
No talking.

280
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,632
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

281
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,675
Wait.

282
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,795
What?

283
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,233
Did you hear something?

284
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,835
No. Don't worry, my parents are passed out.

285
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,873
Are you sure?
You know how my stomach gets.

286
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,108
Here, I'll help you relax.

287
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,276
You brought something, right?

288
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,436
Oh, shit. I left it at home.

289
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,996
I can run back and get it.
I'll be back in like five...

290
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,514
No, no, don't worry. I've got one.

291
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,469
Do you wanna put it on or should I?

292
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,438
Let's put it on together.

293

294
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,669

Why don't you take an Alka-Seltzer?

301
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,192
Alka-Seltzer is for babies.

I just need a nightcap.

Sounds like you could use an Alka-Seltzer.

What was what?

313
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,309
I didn't hear anything.

314
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,958
There was a noise
coming from the laundry room.

I must be hearing things.

See, Daddy? I told you.

801
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,031
Come on, baby, let's dance.

802
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,511
That did not just happen.

803
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,993
Time for a Stifler blowjob!

804
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,390
Oh, get sexy, ladies, I love it.
Oh, I feel a stirring in my loins.

805
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,118
You've gotta meet my roommate.

806
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,075
I would love to.

807
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,193
Dude, the fucking midgets
just stole our women.

808
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,599
RYAN: Yeah, those fuckers are
out of hand.

809
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,231
I told you guys,
don't underestimate those little bastards.

810
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,276
That midget quarterback
stole my girlfriend last year.

811
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,515
Slut!

812
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,431
ROCK: Out of my goddamn way.

813
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,959
Holy shit!

814
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,196
I thought this place had a no-loser policy.
What are you assholes doing here?

815
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,633
Fuck off, Mighty Mouse.

816
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,269
Man, don't take it out on me
because your ladies like it short and thick,

817
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,396
rather than tall and skinny.

818
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,069
Rock, don't you know, baby?
This bar is like a roller coaster.

819
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,713
Yeah, it has a height requirement,

820
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,759
- and I'm afraid you just don't measure up!
- Motherfucker.

821
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,754
- Easy! Easy! Easy!
- Whoa!

822
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,068
This isn't over, Shitler.

823
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,957
Oh, you got that right!

824
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,313
Never get in my way, woman.

825
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,559
What's up?

826
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,595
Bitch.

827
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,275
BRANDY: That did not happen.

828
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,432
I swear to God, I was running
through the streets with nylons on my head

829
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,431
and the condom still on.

830
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,398
I can't believe I just told you that story.

831
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,799
I think it's great.

832
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,350
I mean, think of it this way,
you'll never forget your first time.

833
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,998
Well, it wasn't...

834
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,349
Technically...

835
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,873
Oh, no, wait.

836
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,316
- You mean you didn't even get to...
- He came down too fast.

837
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,031
Thank you.
Thank you for laughing at my misfortune.

838
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,595
I think you're a sweetheart.
And you're really cute.

839
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,039
This is me.

840
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,311
So, are you guys
running the Mile tomorrow?

841
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,790
I don't know. There's something about
running naked down the street

842
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,757
while you're still a virgin...

843
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,239
Didn't stop you before.

844
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,719
Touch.

845
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,634
You never know, that virgin thing,

846
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,312
it could totally change
by the end of the weekend.

847
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,278
Thanks for walking me home.

848
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,519
What the hell happened to you last night?

849
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,755
What's up, fellas?

850
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,989
What's up?

851
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:37,516
What's up is we got
cock-blocked by some midgets at the bar.

852
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,558
Cooze, never mind that.
Where the hell were you?

853
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,157
Well, Mother,
if you must know, I was with a girl.

854
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,398
Bullshit. What girl?

855
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,948
Her name is Brandy.
She's in a sorority and she's hot,

856
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,349
and I'm supposed to meet her
at the Mile tonight.

857
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,758
Dude, I don't get it.

858
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,038
We come to college,
we get blown off by chicks for midgets,

859
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,873
and you're hanging out with a sorority girl?

860
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,269
What the fuck is going on here?

861
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,915
So, what are you gonna do?

862
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,673
What do you mean?
He's gonna bang that chick.

863
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,508
Aren't you?

864
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,828
What?

865
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,269
Yeah.

866
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,069
Yeah, of course I will.
I'm on a guilt-free pass, why wouldn't I?

867
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,037
Why the hesitation, man?

868
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,958
- Oh, shit! You're not gonna do it.
- I said I'll do it.

869
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,589
Erik, you've been given a gift from above.
Don't fuck it up.

870
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,789
I won't.

871
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,949
Yes, you will.

872
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,029
No.

873
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,870
I... I gotta get out of here.

Calling to see how you're doing.

879
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,074
I'm fine,

880
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,196
<i>- I'm just studying.
- Okay.</i>

881
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,829
Cool.

882
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,071
So, did you guys decide
if you're gonna run in the Naked Mile?

883
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,116
No, not yet.
But you know me, I'll probably just wimp out.

884
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,913
I mean, you don't have to.

885
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,954
Yeah, I know.

886
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,995
Are you okay?
I mean, you sound a little weird.

887
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,748
I'm fine.

888
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,189
I'm fine. I just wanted to call and say hello.

889
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,751
Thanks, but you don't need to check in.
I mean, go, have fun.

890
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,115
That's what this weekend's all about.

891

894
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,269
- Hey, Mr. Levenstein.
- Hello, Erik, good to see you.

895
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,830
Yeah. Wow, I haven't seen you
since my parents' New Year's party, right?

896
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,549
Yes, well, your folks really,
really know how to ring in the new year.

897
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,349
Look, I'm sorry about my dad
giving you that wedgie in front of everybody.

898
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,591
Well, your dad's been doing
that to me since we were kids,

899
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,035
and strangely enough, I enjoy it.

900
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,435
So, what are you doing up here?

901
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,080
Oh, well, I went to school here

902
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,789
and, you know, I like to come
back every now and then

903
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,639
and check out the campus.

904
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,759
That's the only reason I'm here.
No other reason that I can think of.

905
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,513
And what about you?
What are you doing here?

906
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,991
Actually, it's kind of personal.

907
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,310
- Oh. Well, say no more.
- Okay.

908
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,515
Okay, listen, good seeing you.

909
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,272
Yeah, for sure.

910
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,990
Mr. Levenstein, you were a counselor

911
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,196
at Tall Oaks Band Camp
with my cousin, Matt, right?

912
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,590
Yes. Yes, I was. And your cousin Matt
needed some counseling...

913
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,309
- Yeah.
...I might add. I gave him some advice.

914
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,233
Advice. Do you think I could

915
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,551
confide something in you?

916
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,559
Well, sure. Yes, Erik, anything. Anything.

917
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,755
Okay.

918
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,589
I'm a virgin.

919
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,954
Okay, can I stop you there?

920
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,077
You're a Stifler and a virgin?

921
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,629
Yeah.

922
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,830
Well, so you're a virgin. What's the big deal?

923
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,917
Well, the other night, my girlfriend and I...
We tried to, you know...

924
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,316
Right. But her father
came down before we had the chance to.

925
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,630
So she changed her mind
completely about the sex,

926
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,678
but she gave me a guilt-free
pass for the weekend.

927
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,990
You got the guilt-free pass?

928
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,118
What do you mean?

929
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:56,115
Well, I mean,
you've got the old guilt-free pass dilemma.

930
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,912
- Yeah.
- It's a tough one.

931
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,116
I didn't think people your age
knew about that kind of stuff.

932
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,158
I believe I know more
about this than you think.

933
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,353
Good, because I just
don't know what to do here.

934
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,955
I mean, I've got
this smoking-hot sorority girl all over me.

935
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,037
Well, you know, my son Jim

936
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,236
went through kind of a similar dilemma.

937
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,117
He was going out with this very attractive

938
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,077
foreign-exchange student named Nadia.

939
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,436
Right, right, yeah. That's the one he blew his
load too early with, right?

940
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,589
- Yes.
- Twice.

941
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,954
- Yes.
- Over the Internet.

942
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,632
- Yes, that's the one.
- Yeah.

943
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,917
Well, blowing loads aside...

944
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,035
Yeah.

945
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,350
The next summer Nadia came
to visit Jim at the beach,

946
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,839
and he turned her down

947
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,151
because he had fallen in love with Michelle,

948
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,794
who he later married,
and is now the mother of my grandchild.

949
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,669
So you're saying
I shouldn't hook up with this sorority girl?

950
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,037
I'm saying I think
only you know the answer to that, Erik.

951
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,033
Well, gotta run.

952
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,475
Oh, Erik, I was sorry to hear
about your grandmother.

953
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,631
Last night was amazing.

954
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,116
Yeah, it was.

955
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,998
The three of us should
do it again sometime.

956
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,679

1428
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,352
Where are the girls?

1429
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:55,228
They all split this morning. Said they had to
drive to State for some big party.

1430
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:56,878
That must make you feel pretty special.

1431
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,235
"Special"? Who cares about special?

1432
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,356
All I care about is the sex.

1433
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:05,319
And, baby, I had plenty. Yeah.

1434
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,479
And just how out of hand
was this sex, Cooze?

1435
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,949
I don't wanna talk about it. Ever.

1436
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:17,716
Speaking of which,
did you seal the deal with that Brandy chick?

1437
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,348
No.

1438
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,317
I told you. Pay up.

1439
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,713
But I did have sex with Tracy last night.

1440
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:31,989
What are you talking about?

1441
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,479
Tracy.

1442
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,189
I drove home
in the middle of the night, I ran out of gas,

1443
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:39,352
stole a horse, rode over to Allison's party...

1444
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,510
- We had sex in the guest room.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1445
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,238
- You stole a horse?
- Yup.

1446
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,072
A real horse?
Like the kind you ride and shit?

1447
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,513
Yeah, a real horse.

1448
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,828
That's fucking fantastic.

1449
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,672
I didn't think you had the
balls for something like that.

1450
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:52,149
- Neither did I.
- Where did you find a horse?

1451
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:54,310
Are there horses in Great Falls?

1452
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:57,799
Proud of you,

1453
01:32:58,760 --> 01:32:59,909
Stifler.

1454
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:04,358
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
But call me Erik.

1455
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:15,638
- RYAN: So, how do you feel?
- Best night of my entire life.

1456
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:18,029
COOZE: See you in a year,
college pussy!

1457
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:35,232
Mail call, bitches.

1458
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:37,875
Scooter.

1459
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,149
Scratchy.

1460
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,349
Tripod.

1461
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:48,515
What the hell?

1462
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:49,999
What is it, man?

1463
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,319
I don't know.

1464
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,711
<i>Smile for the camera, baby.</i>

1465
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,320
Oh, man. That is fucked up.

1466
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,553
Stifler!

1467
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,918
(TOP OF THE WORLD PLAYING)

1468
01:37:26,919 --> 01:37:35,919
