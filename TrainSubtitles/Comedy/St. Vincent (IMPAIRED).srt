Oliver, you know, goes over there
for a few hours after school

1280
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,300
when I'm still at work.

1281
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,580
He's the babysitter, Your Honor,
of sorts. A paid position.

1282
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,940
May I ask why this is relevant?

1283
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,180
Is your client aware that Mr. MacKenna

1284
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,740
takes her son to the racetrack,
and they gamble?

1285
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,227
He also takes him to a local bar.

1286
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,700
We went to the horses a few times.

1287
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,789
A few times? Was that fun?

1288
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,471
- Well, a little.
- Yeah, good.

1289
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,820
This is completely news to me.
I've never heard this before.

1290
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,500
My client is unaware of these events,
as am I,

1291
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:10,220
which is a big surprise right now.

1292
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,100
I'll bet there are quite a few surprises
in this folder, then.

1293
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,667
- Oh, God.
- Daka Parimova?

1294
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,988
Are you aware of her occupation?

1295
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,300
She works for Vin.

1296
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,468
She works for Vince, right?

1297
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:30,300
- She's a lady of the night.
- What?

1298
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,309
Do you know what that means?

1299
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,949
She works at night?

1300
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,300
(WHISPERING) She may be a prostitute.

1301
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,060
(STIFLED LAUGHTER)

1302
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:50,060
Your Honor, I need a few minutes to, uh,
(CLEARS THROAT) confer with my client.

1303
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,910
I imagine you do.

1304
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:57,660
I guess gambling and a racetrack
is like a math class, huh?

1305
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,020
- You got to learn how to bet?
- The odds.

1306
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,060
The bar. Guess that could fall
under current events, right?

1307
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,262
More like social studies.

1308
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,708
It's the strip club hooker
that I can't seem to get my head around.

1309
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,031
Commerce?

1310
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,781
Biology?

1311
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,351
Just stop talking. Don't talk.

1312
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:26,389
Vin!

1313
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,421
Vin!

1314
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,227
(TURNS OFF HOSE)

1315
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:36,500
Why do you people think
my people can't hear?

1316
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,260
What kind of a man takes a child
to a bar and to the racetrack?

1317
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,460
And has him hanging out
with a prostitute?

1318
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,420
What kind of mother

1319
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,820
lets her son hang out

1320
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,100
with a man l-l-l-like that?

1321
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,140
You're an asshole, Vin.

1322
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:56,620
50-50 custody with his asshole dad,
and I have you to thank for that.

1323
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:02,100
You have no one
but yourself to blame for that.

1324
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,143
He needs more than...

1325
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,864
a deadbeat mother.

1326
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:12,260
Good one, and maybe I deserve that.

1327
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,500
I don't know what I was thinking
letting him hang out with you.

1328
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,700
My sentiments exactly.

1329
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,660
Well, he's not coming over there
anymore. That's a given.

1330
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,540
I'll get you your money
for your stupid tree.

1331
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,780
VINCENT: There'll be some interest.

1332
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,311
Yeah, good luck with that.

1333
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,823
Oh, I'm sorry! Sorry!

1334
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,380
My reaction time is much slower
these days.

1335
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,070
Yeah, you were never fast, just stupid.

1336
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:46,860
(BEEPS)

1337
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,064
(AUTOMATED VOICE)
You have seven new messages.

1338
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:51,660
(BEEPS)

1339
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,980
Hello, Vin.
This is Ana here at Sunnyside.

1340
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,500
I'm afraid we have some bad
news regarding your wife, Sandy, sir.

1341
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,385
Please call us as soon as you get this.

1342
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,060
- (CRYING)
- (ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS)

1343
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:10,860
Vin, hello, it's Ana again at Sunnyside.

1344
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,900
We haven't heard back from you
regarding Sandy.

1345
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,626
Please call us right away.

1346
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,260
(BEEP)

1347
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:25,620
Vincent, uh, we've left a few messages
for you. We haven't heard back.

1348
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,460
We really need to hear from you
about Sandy.

1349
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,583
Please call or come by
as soon as possible.

1350
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,700
ANA: Feeling OK?

1351
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,380
- WOMAN: It's a bit chilly.
- Yes, it is.

1352
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,420
SHIRLEY: OK.

1353
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,190
Here we go, Vin.

1354
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,305
All of Sandy's personal items
are in there.

1355
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,820
My wife, where is she?

1356
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,060
She died, Vin.

1357
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,220
I know that.

1358
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,940
Where is she?

1359
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,029
She's in there.

1360
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:23,980
Where?

1361
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,060
In the box.

1362
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,705
Her remains, Vin.

1363
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,420
She died a few weeks ago.

1364
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,660
We tried contacting you several times.

1365
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,540
And when we didn't hear back from you,

1366
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,260
we decided to go ahead
with your death directives.

1367
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,541
You wanted her cremated.

1368
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,220
She's in that box?

1369
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,660
Her remains are, Vin, yes.

1370
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,182
In a box inside that box.

1371
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,543
I am sorry for your loss, Vin.

1372
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,180
This place is peace.

1373
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:09,748
It... w-w-w-was.

1374
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,820
ROBERT: Nah, I didn't study.
I never study.

1375
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,590
- OK, see you later.
- See you around, man.

1376
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,420
- All right.
- Later, Oliver.

1377
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,380
- Hey, you got a lot of homework?
- Hey.

1378
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,100
Art, some math.

1379
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,381
OK.

1380
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,660
Is she with us?

1381
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:36,140
Yeah, she's your father's idea
of safer child care.

1382
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,300
What's her name?

1383
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,980
You have a voice, you ask her.

1384
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,740
Excuse me, what's your name?

1385
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,100
Amelda.

1386
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,580
Hi, Amelda.

1387
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,900
Hola, Mr. Oliver.

1388
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,580
Is she every day?

1389
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,500
And every other weekend
when you're gonna go to your dad's.

1390
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,980
That's what it's gonna be now, bub.

1391
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,660
You're gonna get shuffled back
and forth between me and him.

1392
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,140
Well, he is my dad.

1393
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:01,260
I know he cheated on you
a bunch of times, and...

1394
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,740
that's why we left him.

1395
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,102
Really?

1396
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,220
How do you know that?

1397
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,820
You'll tell anybody who'll listen.

1398
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,620
Grandma, Aunt Judy, all the cousins.

1399
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,948
It's also your Facebook status.

1400
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,390
I know. I've been meaning
to change that.

1401
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,500
I should just say I'm single.

1402
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,190
Yeah, that's better.

1403
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,271
Hey, Vin.

1404
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,940
M-My replacement?

1405
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,660
Yeah, I guess so.

1406
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:46,940
I'd hate to have to report your mother
to immigration and Natur...

1407
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,551
I am a citizen.

1408
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:54,024
Mr. Oliver, one minute.

1409
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,140
What's in the box?

1410
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,308
My wife.

1411
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,220
She died?

1412
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,940
No.

1413
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,260
Sh...

1414
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,900
She shrunk herself.

1415
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,943
She's living in there now.

1416
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,151
Rent-free.

1417
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,630
Sorry, Vin, for your loss.

1418
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,744
(CHUCKLES) Never understood...

1419
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,986
wh-wh-why people say that.

1420
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,220
They don't know what else to say.

1421
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,620
How about, "What was she like?

1422
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:34,269
Do you miss her?"
Or "What are you gonna do now?"

1423
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,860
Do yourself a favor.

1424
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,260
Get a life.

1425
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,906
Stop living mine.

1426
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,180
Take my word.

1427
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,020
It's not working for shit for me.

1428
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,260
That's not true.

1429
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,462
What the he...

1430
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,063
hell do you know about me?

1431
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,547
You don't know me.

1432
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,548
You're just stupid.

1433
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,781
Of course I'm stupid.

1434
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,180
(MUMBLING)

1435
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,060
Mostly for thinking

1436
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:20,424
you're more than just
a drunk, mean old man.

1437
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,861

1548
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,860
I chose a man who shares
many of the same qualities

1549

as Saint William of Rochester.

is the least likely candidate

He doesn't like people,
and not many people like him.

He's grumpy, angry,

and I'm sure full of regrets.

Mr. Vincent MacKenna was born in 1946

1562
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,020
in Sheepshead Bay,

1563
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:16,144
the son of first-generation
Irish immigrants.

1564
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,940
Growing up poor
on the streets of Brooklyn,

1565
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:24,260
Vincent learned all the things
that kids shouldn't need to know:

1566
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:27,860
fighting, cursing and gambling.

1567
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:32,860
In 1965, as a member of the
United States Army's Fifth Regiment,

1568
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,900
Vincent was among the 450 soldiers

1569
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,220
dropped into the La Drang Valley
and immediately ambushed

1570
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,020
by 2,000 enemy troops.

1571
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:44,860
There he heroically saved the lives
of two wounded officers

1572
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:48,780
pinned down by enemy fire
and carried them to safety.

1573
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,540
He was awarded the Bronze Star
for his bravery.

1574
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,420
I imagine the best way I can tell you

1575
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:56,260
who Mr. Vincent MacKenna is

1576
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:59,500
is to tell you what he's done for me.

1577
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,700
When me and my mom first moved here,
we knew no one,

1578
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,460
and Mr. MacKenna took me in
when he didn't have to,

1579
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,300
and most likely didn't want to.

1580
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:11,231
But he did it anyhow,
'cause that's what saints do.

1581
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:16,980
We visited his wife, Sandy,
of 40 years, who recently passed away.

1582
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:20,420
Vin's done her laundry every week
for the past eight years,

1583
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,380
long after she no longer recognized him.

1584
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,340
Because saints never give up.

1585
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,980
He taught me how to fight,

1586
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,060
how to stand my ground and be brave,

1587
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:31,180
how to speak up and be bold.

1588
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,780
Because saints fight
for themselves and others,

1589
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,780
so that they might be heard.

1590
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,540
He taught me how to gamble,
horse racing,

1591
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,620
Keno, the over and under,

1592
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:43,740
which is a big reason
why I'm grounded till I'm 18.
