Okay. Let's see where we are.

00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,823
We could move this, get
rid of that, kill that.

4
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:27,491
That kind of freaks me out.
Don't need her. We can get rid of that.

5
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,993
That's done. Okay,
we could start with this.

I know it's a hard-hitting piece, but
come on, you guys, it's the Internet.

How about this? Perfect.

Now, doesn't she look smart and
knowledgeable about immigration reform?

10
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,801
ALL: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
She does, right?

No! Not even close.

Where are you?
I'm here. So am I.

So many people.
What are you wearing?

28

I'm wearing the only clothes
outside the theater,

because I'm the only person
outside the theater!

I love that outfit.
You look so sexy in that.

You know that
I love this movie.

If a prostitute and a ruthless
businessman can fall in love,

of being late, just shit on my face.

51
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,725
'Cause that's kind of the same thing
as missing Your Body Is a Wonderland.

I did? When?

61

When we were at that bed
and breakfast having sex.

I was tied up at
work. I'm sorry.

65

Maybe you should care a
little bit less about work

66

and a little more about the
girl that you're dating.

Not your issue any more.

and a hoodie. Yeah.

take the SATS after this?

Wait, is this a trick? No.

Just pure anthropological
research.

Okay. You want someone to
sweep you off your feet,

90

but you're more interested in
getting swept off your feet

91
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,856
than the someone who's
doing the sweeping.

You seem like you've
got it totally together,

really emotionally damaged.

Welcome to New York. Thank you.

157
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,883
You're not exactly what comes to
mind when you think headhunter.

158
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,182
Yeah, I prefer "executive recruiter.
" Headhunter sounds a little creepy.

159
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,802
You did stalk me for six months.
Kind of creepy.

160
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,561
Here, here, here, I'll take it.

161
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,523
You're really gonna carry my bag?
You're that girl?

162
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,727
No. I'm gonna change your life.
I'm that girl.

163
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,062
My life is already
pretty great.

164
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,490
Oh, really? 'Cause you wouldn't be here
if your life were already pretty great.

165
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,326
A free trip to New York.
I'd be an idiot to turn that down.

166
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,280
Well, then I guess you must have been
an idiot for the past six months.

167
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,492
Ooh, yeah, a lot of people
would say longer than that.

It's a huge opportunity, Dylan.

I could put up a video of me
mixing cake batter with my boobs

173
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,547

eight million hits.

Well, look, there's no question that
you are talented at what you do,

177
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,519
but this is GQ.

178
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,441
New York's so crowded.

179
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,566
Look around. I'm from LA, okay?

180

I like my open spaces.
What are you, a gazelle?

181
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,075
Come on, what's really
worrying you about this?

182
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:10,202
I don't know. I don't want to be the
guy who took something legendary

183
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,034
and shit the bed with it.
Excuse the expression.

184
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,087
Well, then don't be the guy who shit the bed.
Excuse the expression.

185
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,254
Be the guy who made
the bed legendary again.

Listen, we'll get some coffee in you
before the interview. You'll be fine.

I'm sorry, not coffee.

DYLAN: Really hot in New York.

189
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,558
Doesn't it get hot in LA?

190
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,514
Yeah, it gets hot in LA,
but it's the humidity.

191
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,396
In LA, if it's 90 degrees, it
feels like 90 degrees. But...

192
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,936
Right. If it's hot in New York,

193
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,900
it's 90 degrees, it's
like 100,000 degrees.

00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,152
This conversation about weather
is really fascinating,

but lucky for me, we are here.

196
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,490
So, good luck.

Whatever happens, happens.
I told you, I don't really want it.

198
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,411
Just do me a favor?
Act like you do so that I look good.

199
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,791
I can do that.
Okay. Go get 'em.

gonna shit the bed.

I've seen your work.
It's amazing.

It's a huge move.

220

Would you uproot your entire
life for a job? Be honest.

221

Well, no. For a job,
probably not.

Yeah, I would.

BOTH: Swear.

626
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,307
Okay.

627
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,318
So I guess we
should just start.

628
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,817
Okay.

629
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:34,982
I'll serve.

630
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,405
That's really...
That's enough of the tennis.

631
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,576
Let's go to the bedroom.

632
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,654
What's wrong with the couch?
It's less emotional.

633
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,122
The bedroom has better light.

634
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,913
And since we're just friends, I don't
have to be insecure about my body.

635
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,994
Come on, okay?
You're beautiful.

636
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,167
You have nothing to
be insecure about.

637
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,209
No, you see, that is way
too emotionally supportive

638
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,301
and you need to
just lock that down.

639
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,640
Your ass is a little bony.
Much better.

640
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,684
My nipples are sensitive,
I don't like dirty talk,

641
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,805
and had I known this was gonna happen, I
would have shaved my legs this morning.

642
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,436
My chin is ticklish, I sneeze
sometimes after I come,

643
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,983
and if I'd have known
this was gonna happen,

644
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,275
I wouldn't have shaved
my legs this morning.

I can't believe I'm doing this.

653
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,301
Should we stop?
We could just go for a run.

654
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,923

getting too old for this?

a little emasculated.

you and you feel emasculated?

that word means, right?

795
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,810
Yes, I know what it
means, and I feel it.

00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,581
I have to go to the bathroom.

is to pee with a hard-on?

No, actually.

It's a timesaver.

Well, then you think you could use
that time to shave your stubble.

couldn't tell you to shut up right now.

that if you don't start shaving up here,
I'm gonna stop shaving down there.

The whole reason you go to the market

is to buy the produce,

00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:17,099
One day, you'll meet someone and it'll
literally take your breath away.

937
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:21,357
Like you can't breathe.
Like no oxygen to the lungs.

938
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,860
Like a fish...
Yeah, I get it, Tommy.

939
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,444
Yeah, you don't.

940
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,356
Nice work on that new
online site, by the way.

941
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,317
What was the font
on that headline?

942
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,700
It was Times Roman.

943
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,116
Times Roman. Inspired. I'm out.

944
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,707
You have a boat?

945
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,169
I live in Jersey.
And I ain't taking no ferry.

946
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,460
Unless it's out to
dinner and a show. Bam!

947
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,017
Hey. Yeah.

948
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:10,445
You and that Dylan? Way to go.
I mean the whole friendship-sex thing.

949
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,196
Kudos, baby, kudos.

950
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,363
(LAUGHS)

951
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,036
It's not that big of a deal.

952
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,658
It's just surprising.

953
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,365
I always thought you were
a true-love kind of girl.

954
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,539
Whatever, Mom. It's not like
it's stopping me from anything.

955
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,545
That's what I thought
back in '78,

956
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,672
And every year since.

957
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,258
I'm just...
I'm flattered, actually.

958
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,878
The apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

959
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,009
It's just surprising.

960
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,225
There, done. It's...
There we go. Okay.

961
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,848
You look great! You look great.
You look like a princess.

962
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,728
Yeah! Really?

963
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,234
Yeah. Okay.

964
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,196
Hey, my friend gave me his
house in Montauk for July 4th.

965
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:53,150
Let's you and me go away together.
No men, no bullshit.

966
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,744
Just mother-daughter.
Like a Nora Ephron movie. (SCOFFS)

967
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,410
When was the last time we spent
a full weekend together?

968
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,576
When I was eight, that time in Vermont.
We got snowed in with the ski instructor.

969
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,792
Demitri. Bill.

970
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,253
He reminded me a lot
of your father.

971
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,923
Dark curls, olive skin,
Cold War accent.

972
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,883
My father was Russian?
I don't remember.

973
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,091
But what I do remember is we drank a
lot of vodka and shot a lot of guns.

974
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,757
Mom, this "who's your daddy"
game is getting really old.

975
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,601
I know I haven't been the
best mother in the world...

976
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,064
I'm sorry, were you waiting
for me to jump in?

977
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,393
Come on! Go away with me.
Come on!

978
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,070
Come on. Come on. (LAUGHING)

979
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,323
Okay, we'll do it.
It'll be fun, yeah?

980
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:36,943
(SIGHS)

981
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:40,871
(GASPS)

982
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,949
Mom... I was trying to bond!

983
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,452
It was either this or sniff glue.
(LAUGHS)

984
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,251
Sorry about my mom.
I thought she was funny.

985
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,133
Yeah, she's really funny
when she's asking for money,

986
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,803
and she's hilarious when
she needs a place to stay.

987
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,265
Dylan, I think I wanna
start dating again.

988
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,144
Listen, I think
we should stop this.

989
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,444
Hmm. Yeah?

990
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,195
I kind of think you're right.

991
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,317
Right?

992
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:24,033
♪ Every new beginning comes from
some other beginning's end ♪

993
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,916
That actually makes sense
right here.

994
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,960
Who would've thought Third Eye
Blind could be so prophetic?

995
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,161
Not Third Eye Blind.

996
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,005
I'm pretty sure
that's Third Eye Blind.

997
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,289
Do you wanna go
grab some lunch?

998
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,499
Yes. Okay.

999
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,301
You're buying. What?

1000
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,637
Okay.

1001
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:40,639
Oh.

1002
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,008
Pants. Shirt.

1003
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,847
So this is the end of this?

1004
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,887
I guess so. But it's good. Yeah.

1005
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,389
And We did it.
With no bullshit.

1006
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,560
Shirt. Sweater.

1007
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,316
We managed to actually
stay friends.

1008
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:52,810
Yup. Yeah.

1009
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,029
Okay. So, what is
your type, anyway?

1010
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,193
No, I don't have a type.

1011
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,579
It's more about what's inside.
Oh, please!

1012
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:05,414
Okay, what about her?

1013
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,038
DYLAN: Yeah. I could get
to know her inside.

1014
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,206
And she's reading a book.

1015
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:11,333
It's probably Nicholas Sparks.

1016
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,669
I'm gonna go talk to her. What?

1017
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,917
What do you mean, "What?
" We said we wanted to date again.

1018
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,715
I'm gonna go talk to her. Now?

1019
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,337
Here, in front of
all of these people?

1020
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,723
I didn't say I was gonna rape her.
I said I was gonna go talk to her.

1021
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:29,393
Excuse me. I'm Dylan.
Nice to meet you.

1022
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,015
Oh, The Notebook.

1023
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,059
(INAUDIBLE)

1024
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,564
DYLAN: Nice meeting you.

1025
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,825
Well? We talked. We laughed.

1026
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,030
Yeah.

1027
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,411
She's Belgian.
Explains the reading.

1028
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,163
I showed her
where the balcony was,

1029
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,916
because that's where she is
meeting up with her husband.

1030
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,584
Oh! (LAUGHING)

1031
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,086
DYLAN: Anniversary trip
to New York.

1032
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:59,378
Three kids.
Christof, Karlina and Pepijn.

1033
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:01,550
Shut up.

1034
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,432
Why are you still laughing?
At least I gave it a shot.

1035
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,268
Fine. I'll go next.

1036
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,938
See if I still have game. Okay.

1037
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,440
Okay. Oh, okay.

1038
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,024
Yes. Right here. Eleven o'clock.

1039
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,860
Iced coffee.
Handsome, but doesn't know it.

1040
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:20,444
Staring at a tree, which means he's
actually in the park for nature

1041
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:22,116
and not to watch
women sunbathe.

1042
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,867
Or he's retarded. Don't care.

1043
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,069
I'm going in.

1044
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,038
(SCATTING)

1045
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,377
Excuse me. Yes?

1046
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,961
Hi. Hello.

1047
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,751
I'm Jamie.

1048
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,626
Yeah. Yeah, that works.

1049
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,629
Oh, hi.

1050
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,136
Okay.

1051
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,390
Nice to meet you. Oh, my God!

1052
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,935
(SCATTING)

1053
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:56,894
Okay. His name is Parker.
He's a children's oncologist.

1054
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:57,977
(SCATTING)

1055
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,817
And I have a date
this Saturday.

1056
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,984
(SCATTING A FAN FARE)

1057
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:02,319
Nice. Thank you.

1058
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:04,947
Why'd you wave to me?

1059
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:08,408
I told him you were
my gay best friend,

1060
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,239
so he wants to set you up
with his brother.

1061
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,162
(SCATTING MOCKINGLY)

1062
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:16,792
PARKER: College, med school,
and I haven't slept since.

1063
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,206
JAMIE: I can't believe
you actually cure cancer.

1064
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,542
Well, me and God.

1065
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,844
What? I'm kidding.

1066
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,673
Can you imagine someone who would
actually say that? (EXHALING DEEPLY)

1067
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,845
Yeah, I could.
I've been out with a lot of them.

1068
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,676
Cancer doctors? No, assholes.

1069
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,390
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

1070
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,683
Well, hopefully you're
all done with that.

1071
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:38,351
Although, I gotta warn you, lot
of cancer doctors, big assholes.

1072
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,477
Really? Yeah.

1073
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,484
And brain surgeons,
huge perverts.

1074
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,404
While they're doing this,
a little bit of that.

1075
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,027
Hey.

1076
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,241
(JAMIE LAUGHING)

1077
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,700
Thank you.

1078
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,581
When can I see you again?

1079
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,703
Right now.

1080
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:58,917
Ah.

1081
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,582
I'm just kidding. Okay.

1082
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,379
Can you imagine someone
who would actually say that?

1083
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,711
JAMIE: I played the tuba
in high school.

1084
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,047
World's stupidest instrument.

1085
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,097
Especially when you move
eight times.

1086
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,886
Why'd you move? My mom really
likes to break up with guys,

1087
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,429
and she was really good at it.

1088
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,848
Was your dad one of them?
No, no, he was long before that.

1089
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,561
I actually never knew my dad.

1090
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,268
I'm sorry. That sucks.

1091
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,573
All right, look, I think I should

00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:34,876
No problem.

1247
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,995
As long as you get your feet off my bed.
They're disgusting.

1248
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,381
What are you doing?

1249
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:41,796
Why are you doing that?
Why are you doing that?

1250
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,211
You're an animal. Stop doing that.
An animal. Stop.

1251
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,808
Hey, Ma.

1252
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,557
Ma. Come on,
we gotta get on the road.

1253
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,355
Come on.

1254
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,894
Ma?

1255
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,832
Ouch.

1256
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,411
Why did I think that this
time would be any different?

1257
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:19,163
Come with me to LA. What?

1258
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,965
What else are you gonna do?
It's 4th of July, everybody's left the city.

1259
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,792
You're very sweet for asking,
but it's fine.

1260
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,548
You know what, I'll just stay here.
I'll be fine alone.

1261
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,888
I know you'll be fine alone.
You're not a baby in a hot car.

1262
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,723
I'm actually asking you to
come because it would help me.

1263
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,767
You'd be a great distraction
for my family.

1264
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:35,057
They'd forget all about
drilling me for being single.

1265
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,392
Won't they think
that we're together?

1266
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,561
Not if I tell them we're not.
And they'll believe you?

1267
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:41,060
Yeah, we're one of these crazy families
that doesn't lie to each other.

1268
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,527
PBS is doing
a documentary on us.

1269
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:43,775
Come on, they'll love you.

1270
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:46,364
All fast-talking and brusque,
like I'm bringing home a carny.

1271
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,535
You're really nice to ask,
but I'm just gonna stay here.

1272
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,861
Go to the gym.

1273
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:54,035
I just got you a ticket with my
miles, it's done. Meet me at JFK.

1274
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,536
But... No buts.

1275
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,459
Like you were gonna go to the gym.
I wasn't.

1276
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,255
(SUCH A COLORFUL WORLD PLAYING)

1277
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,516
LA's so nice.

1278
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,970
Hmm. And everyone's so
genuine and level-headed.

1279
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,228
(LAUGHING)

1280
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:20,600
Thanks for this.
You're good peeps.

1281
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:22,393
You're the good peeps, dude.

1282
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:25,104
You haven't met my family.
You don't know what you're in for.

1283
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,069
Okay.

1284
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,158
(SIGHING) You know these planes
pretty much land themselves?

1285
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:33,154
Nobody cares.
You sound like an asshole.

1286
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:35,990
She's from New York.

1287
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,457
I'm sorry.

1288
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,424
Wow. This looks normal.

1289
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:51,756
It is.

1290
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:53,757
Thank you.

1291
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,846
Wow, you grew up here?

1292
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,474
It was my grandfather's.

1293
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:04,268
He bought it when there
was nothing else here.

1294
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,653
My dad and my sister
and her son live here now.

1295
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:09,986
What...
Why would you move to New York?

1296
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,651
I was conned by some headhunter.
(LAUGHS)

1297
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:14,320
You're here. Sammy!

1298
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:15,487
Hey, Uncle Dylan.

1299
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:16,871
What's up, buddy? (GRUNTS)

1300
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:18,915
How are you?

1301
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,709
Jamie, this is my nephew,
Sam the Magnificent.

1302
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,580
Hello. May I offer you a
light for your cigarette?

1303
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:26,336
I'm sorry, I don't smoke.

1304
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,254
Just pretend. He's a magician.

1305
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,212
Of course I'll have a cigarette.
Smoking is great for you.

1306
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,385
(GASPS)

1307
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:38,886
Wow. Thank you, good sir.
My pleasure, my lady.

1308
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,146
Oh, my God. I got it, I got it.

1309
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,394
Sammy. I got it, I got it.
Just stay still. I got it, I got it.

1310
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:45,142
Sammy! Are you okay?

1311
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:46,477
(ANNIE EXHALING DEEPLY)
All part of the illusion.

1312
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,187
Jet Skis later? Definitely.

1313
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,446
DYLAN: Still into magic, huh?

1314
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:53,696
Yep. But I'll take that over him
sexting his friends any day.

1315
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,745
Dilbert! Banannie.

(GRUNTING)

1317
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,574
Jamie,
this is my sister, Annie.

1318
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:02,121
Hi. Thank you for having me.

1319
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,168
Oh, please. It's nice to have
Dylan bring a girl home.

1320
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:05,837
We're just friends.
Oh, no, I know.

1321
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,085
If you were his girlfriend, he
never would've brought you here.

1322
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:10,880
This one has intimacy issues.
I know.

1323
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,089
Dylan. Dad.

1324
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,837
Dylan. Oh, man. Hey.

1325
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,298
How you doing, buddy? I'm good.

1326
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,349
I miss you guys, but I'm good.

1327
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:19,517
Oh!

1328
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:20,765
Dede Spencer?

1329
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:23,096
Jamie. Dylan's friend.

1330
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,017
I'm sorry. I... That's okay.

1331
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,068
No, for a minute you reminded
me of a girl I used to know.

1332
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,571
No, that's okay. It happens.
Nice to meet you.

1333
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,782
Pleasure meeting you.
You have a beautiful house.

1334
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:34,900
Thank you.

1335
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:38,366
Pool's a little cold, but it's
very expensive to heat, so...

1336
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,406
I think I'm gonna go in
and check the tide tables

1337
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,124
'cause I'm gonna take the boat
out early in the morning.

1338
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,743
You should come.
I would love to.

1339
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,461
We sold the boat.

1340
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:48,580
The doctor doesn't want you
driving the boat any more.

1341
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:49,748
(SIGHS)

1342
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,751
Turning to mush. No.

1343
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,596
It's good to see you, buddy.

1344
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:58,382
Nice to meet you.
It was nice meeting you, too.

1345
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:00,217
Jamie. See? Yes.

1346
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:08,066
What's with the pants?
He doesn't like them any more.

1347
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,109
He's getting worse.

1348
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,229
It's so good to have you here.

1349
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:14,485
Go show her the beach.

1350
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,989
Let me show you the beach.
Come on. Okay.

1351
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,953
Go, get sandy.
Get all messed up. Okay.

1352
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,551
JAMIE: Dylan never told
me about your dad.

1353
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,349
Yeah, it's been tough on him.
They were real close.

1354
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,885
Dylan doesn't quite know how
to deal with the Alzheimer's.

1355
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:45,186
I'm sorry.

1356
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,897
He'll be his regular old self
and everything seems fine,

1357
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:50,647
and then just in a flash,
he's gone.

1358
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,105
That's Dylan when he was nine.
Are those braids?

1359
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:57,983
He was going through a Kris Kross phase.
Remember them?

1360

(LAUGHING)

1362
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,199
Is that your mom?
No, that's Dylan's speech therapist.

1363
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:10,295
He had a stutter.
It got real bad when he was nervous.

1364
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:12,005
He had a rough childhood.

1365
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:15,167
His math tutor called it
"character-building." Math tutor?

1366
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:19,138
No, we're talking, like,
8 times 6 equals 1,200.

1367
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,306
But he's very visual,
thank God.

1368
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,676
Can you please explain
to me this photo?

1369
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,053
That is my 12th-birthday
surprise party.

1370
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,225
Hey. Amazing moment.

1371
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,064
I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna go to bed.

1372
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,230
Jamie, you all good with your room?
Yeah. No, it's perfect.

1373
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,395
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

(MOANING SOFTLY)

1375
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,159
Sammy and I built
a saw-a-girl-in-half box,

1376
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,407
so just be careful
on your way to bed.

1377
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:44,996
He's not using a real saw,
is he?

1378
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,744
Of course he is.
He's magnificent.

1379
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:50,536
I'll make sure he brushes his teeth, and
you, don't believe anything she says.

1380
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,662
She's a liar. (LAUGHING)

1381
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,673
He's a pretty special guy.
Yeah, I think so.

You up? Yeah. Come in.

01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,639
I thought you were going to bed.
I was.

01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:09,392
But then I realized we were
both single again, so...

Oopsy. (GASPS)

1388
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:12,436
Oopsy.

1389
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,726
Dude, no. Why not?

1390
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,728
I washed my hands.
With soap this time.

1391
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,772
Are you serious?
Why would you just assume?

1392
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:22,613
You cracked your neck on the porch.
This thing. That's your tell, remember?

1393
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:26,076
I cracked my neck because we
were on a flight for six hours,

1394
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:29,617
and you were yapping my ear off about
how planes all fly themselves,

1395
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:31,243
and it actually kinked
my neck a bit.

1396
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:34,087
So, no?

01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:10,989
I'm a little over 6 foot.

1549
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:14,409
Looks like it's about three of me.
So six times three...

1550
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:17,166
Ninety-two feet.

1551
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:21,041
Ninety-two feet.
That's really tall, right? Yeah.

1552
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,503
But they don't want you to get up
there, so I guess that makes sense.

1553
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:29,341
Wait. Six times three...
Oh, God, you poor kid.

1554
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,059
What's up? Come on.

1555
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,057
What? What?
Where are you going?

1556
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:37,398
Jamie, no, no, no, no, no, wait.
They take this shit seriously, okay?

1557
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,516
Look at all the cameras.

1558
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:41,978
This is the only landmark this city has
other than the Scientology Center.

1559
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:45,156
And if any of these cameras are hooked
up to the actual Scientology Center,

1560
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:47,108
that was an inappropriate joke
and I apologize.

1561
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,785
I believe in the freedom
of science fiction.

1562

(COUGHING) Pussy! Oh, sorry.

1563
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,077
Pussy!

1564
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,540
Come on!

1565
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:04,671
JAMIE: You really never been
up here before? DYLAN: No.

1566
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,219
I've also never transferred
heroin in my rectum,

1567
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:09,092
'cause it's against the law.

1568
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:13,222
You know, sometimes a simple
yes or no answer is adequate.

1569
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:15,057
Hey, why didn't you tell me
about your mom?

1570
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:17,555
She's not worth talking about.

1571
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:19,223
That's rough.

1572

So is leaving
your husband and kids.

1573
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:24,107
Yeah, you never told me
about him either.

1574
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:26,151
You know, there's a lot of
stuff you didn't tell me.

1575
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,819
I don't want your pity.

1576
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:33,071
I can handle anything except
that look in people's eyes.

1577
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:38,413
That one.
Who cares what anybody thinks?

1578
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,248
He's the smartest man
I've ever known.

1579
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:42,295
He's the only person
I'd ever go to for advice.

1580
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:43,665
He's my dad.

1581
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,211
Dylan, he's still the same man.

1582
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,634
When I see the way
people look at him now...

1583
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:49,925
It doesn't matter
how people look at him.

1584
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:51,256
All that matters
is how you look at him.

1585
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:54,182
Yeah, but he's walking around without his pants.
Everyone's staring.

1586
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,893
So what? It's embarrassing.

1587
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,641
He needs to know
that nothing has changed.

1588
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:59,639
That he's still that
same man to you.

1589
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:01,766
Can we stop talking about this?

1590
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:06,563
Yeah, that's really smart.
Let's just not talk about our feelings.

1591
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:07,771
I'm trying not to.

1592
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:12,869
Come on. Is something going on here?
You've been acting really weird.

1593
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,946
No, I haven't. Yeah, you have.

1594
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:16,826
Is this about what happened
the other night?

1595
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:19,041
What, sex? That doesn't mean anything.
You know that.

1596
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:23,333
Right.

1597
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:25,627
And I haven't been acting weird.
Okay.

Oh, my God! Oh, shit!

You are trespassing. Get down from the sign.

(STUTTERING) And also helicopters!
They don't make sense to me!

What do you mean
you have a fear of heights?

1609

Why would you come up here?

this afternoon in the Southland.

The LAPD rescued a local man
from the Hollywood sign,

1613

the city's only real landmark.

in a foil blanket!

before this?

Okay. Give me... No!

No, no. I wanna save it.
I gotta save it. No. That's enough!

No, I wanna watch it over and over.

to take Dad that week

for Sam's class trip, right?

Yeah, he's gonna stay with
me in New York. Oh, good.

So, when are we gonna
see Jamie again?

Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?

She's not my girlfriend.
Why don't you believe me?

I would believe you
if you didn't lie to me.

01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,833
I saw you creeping out
of her room the other night.

1632
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,960

if you know what I mean.

It doesn't matter, it's over.
Why?

each other like that.

great together?

Because you're actually
friends with each other?

I have ever seen you?

You liked her enough
to have sex with her.

It's just physical.

01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:31,356
Come on, ladies. Hop to.

1854
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:36,233
Girls, girls. Okay, look.
Just blend in.

1855
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:38,905
Okay, let's go
boy, girl, boy...

1856
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:40,865
Dylan...Boy, boy, boy, boys.

1857
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,534
What are you doing here?
You met for another job!

1858
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:44,862
What, are you gonna leave now?

1859
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:46,242
I don't know. Yeah,
I took one meeting.

1860
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:47,572
I can't believe you.

1861
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:49,286
Come here. (SIGHS)

1862
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,918
Is this your way of
getting back at me? What?

1863
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:54,037
You know that if you leave before
a year is up, I get screwed.

1864
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:55,922
Oh, right.

1865
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:57,256
If I did leave,

1866
01:28:57,374 --> 01:29:00,173
which I don't know yet because
all I did was take one meeting,

1867
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,095
I'd write you a check
for your bonus.

1868
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:05,883
Whatever it is, I'll pay for it.
Happy now? We good?

1869
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:07,096
Why didn't you tell
me you were looking?

1870
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:08,218
That's personal.

1871
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:09,723
And we're not friends any more.

1872
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:10,975
You made that pretty clear.

1873
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:15,813
See, all I wanted to do was
have sex with you. Remember?

1874
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,153
Pretend you were the best
friend I'd ever had.

1875
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:20,071
Open up to you like I've
never done with anyone ever.

1876
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:21,649
And then when the sex stopped,

1877
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:23,904
invite you to LA
for the weekend to,

1878
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:25,068
(SCATTING DRAMATICALLY)

1879
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:26,786
introduce you to my family.

1880
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:29,447
I'll send you a check
if I take the job.

1881
01:29:29,614 --> 01:29:30,740
Don't bother.

1882
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,835
TOMMY: Why don't you
pick him up?

1883
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:40,842
Yeah. Just pick him on up.

1884
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:43,254
Oh, you little
Christ figure, you!

1885

(BOYS DON'T CRY PLAYING)

(PHONE RINGING)

1887
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:08,445
Hey, Dyl.

1888
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:09,779
Dad's coming into
Newark Airport, right?

1889
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:11,615
Yeah, he leaves
at 9:00 our time.

1890
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:14,625
9:00. So it's a five-hour flight,
three-hour time difference,

1891
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,169
so he gets in at

1892
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:17,461
322007

1893
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:20,632
5:00. Be there at 5:00, Dylan.

1894
01:30:20,707 --> 01:30:22,675
Right. How is Dad?

1895
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,006
Ah.

1896
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,839
He's lost more
often than not now.

1897
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:29,967
But then he has these moments of real clarity.
It's hit or miss.

1898
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:31,222
Okay. How's Jamie?

1899
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,313
That's over. Oh, Dylan!

1900
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:36,519
Okay, we're done.

1901
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,233
Don't be an idiot, please.

1902
01:30:38,308 --> 01:30:40,652
Thank you, Annie.
I'll pick up Dad tomorrow at the airport.

1903
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:42,813
32:00 sharp. I love you.

1904
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:47,860
JAMIE: I don't know what it is.

1905
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:50,487
I just can't get myself to start
looking for a replacement for him,

1906
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:51,662
assuming that he leaves.

1907
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:53,581
Do you want some
motherly love advice?

1908
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:55,037
Not really.

1909
01:30:55,158 --> 01:30:56,785
Oh, good, 'cause
I don't know how to do that.

1910
01:30:56,868 --> 01:31:00,463
What I do know is that
it's no great goddamn secret

1911
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:03,257
you live in fear of
repeating my mistakes.

1912
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:05,427
And you're not wrong,
so learn from me.

1913
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:08,673
Do you know how many men in my life
I thought were really perfect?

1914
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,006
Eighty. One.

1915
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:11,846
Eighty-one? One.

1916
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:14,394
Oh. It was your dad.
Greatest man I ever met.

1917
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:16,267
Obviously. Look at you.

1918
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:19,566
How smart you are, how great,
how funny, how driven.

1919
01:31:19,683 --> 01:31:21,026
Your vaguely
Middle Eastern beauty.

1920
01:31:21,101 --> 01:31:23,524
Sure as hell
didn't all come from me.

1921
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:26,281
Okay, but, seriously, Mom,

1922
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:28,700
do you really not remember
where my dad's from?

1923
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,447
Or is it like
a coping mechanism?

1924
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:31,574
A little of both.

1925
01:31:31,695 --> 01:31:32,696
(LAUGHING) Okay.

1926
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:34,656
But I'm pretty
sure he's Eurasian.

1927
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:35,786
(LAUGHING)

1928
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:37,917
I mean, we all have
our Prince Charming,

1929
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:39,874
you just gotta know
him when you see him.

1930
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:42,539
Mom, it's Prince Charming.
You should just know.

1931
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:44,215
Well, your Prince
Charming isn't coming

1932
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:45,876
to rescue you in
a horse and carriage.

1933
01:31:45,959 --> 01:31:47,211
That's not who you want.

1934
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:51,636
I mean, you're looking
for a man to be your partner.

1935
01:31:52,549 --> 01:31:54,267
To take on the world with.

1936
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:56,762
You gotta update
your fairytale, baby.

1937
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,605
My Prince Charming?

1938
01:32:00,306 --> 01:32:01,649
You.

1939
01:32:01,808 --> 01:32:02,900

Hey.

A wheelchair.
Like I'm an invalid.

1942
01:32:28,918 --> 01:32:30,465
How was the flight? I'm hungry.

1943
01:32:30,587 --> 01:32:32,305
You know they don't serve
food in coach any more?

1944
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:33,514
You'd think with
these new planes,

1945
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:34,682
they practically
fly themselves,

1946
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:37,307
they could get rid of a pilot and
use his salary for a hot lunch.

1947
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:38,599
I know, right?
Let's get you some food.

1948
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:39,850
God.

1949
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:42,524
DYLAN: The engineering on
these planes is so advanced.

1950
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:43,816
Completely computerized.

1951
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:45,935
It's like playing a video game.
Exactly.

1952
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:48,946
God. How long have we been waiting here?
It's ridiculous.

1953
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:51,153
I'll be right back, okay?

1954
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:55,991
Excuse me.
We've been waiting a while.

1955
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:57,785
Harper. Yeah, I got you.
I got you.

1956
01:32:57,864 --> 01:32:59,491
I have to seat people
in the order they came.

1957
01:32:59,616 --> 01:33:01,493
I totally understand that,
but I'm with my dad

1958
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:03,495
and he's not in the best shape.
Oh, I'm sorry.

1959
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:05,459
Is there no way we could,
like, squeeze a table?

1960
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:08,379
No, I gotta go
by the list. Sorry.

1961
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:13,467
Dad?

1962
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:21,475
Dad?

1963
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:24,308
Shit. Dad?

1964
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:38,496
You gonna join me?

1965
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:49,833
Absolutely.

1966

Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry,
you cannot do this.

1967

Could I get a steak,
medium, please?

1968
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:00,685
Sir, this is the Daily Grill.
Make that two.

1969
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:11,230
Dede? Dede!

1970
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:21,368
Dad.

1971
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,208
Dad.

(SIGHS)

1973
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:28,128
Who is Dede?

1974
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:33,214
Jesus. She's just a girl
that I met in the Navy.

1975
01:34:34,294 --> 01:34:35,716
Was...

1976
01:34:35,879 --> 01:34:36,880
(CLEARS THROAT)

1977
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:39,807
She was the love of my life.

1978
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:42,431
Okay?

1979
01:34:43,553 --> 01:34:44,896
Why didn't you tell
me about her before?

1980
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:47,398
This is not something you
discuss with your children.

1981
01:34:47,974 --> 01:34:50,853
And besides, I have you and Annie.
I have no regrets.

1982
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:51,982
So tell me now.

1983
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:55,607
She was the love of my life.

1984
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:56,984
And I was too
stupid to realize it,

1985
01:34:57,066 --> 01:35:00,161
and I lost her because of something
so dumb I don't even remember.

1986
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:02,326
And I never
really got over her.

1987
01:35:02,906 --> 01:35:06,581
And I think that may be one
of the reasons your mom left.

1988
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:09,413
You know, my friends
used to say

1989
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,414
that when Dede and I
looked at each other,

1990
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:12,753
it was electric.

1991
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:14,084
And I let her go.

1992
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,843
I just let her go.

1993
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:19,469
Because I was too damn proud to tell
her how I really felt about her.

1994
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:22,767
I'll tell you something that I
wish I Knew when I was your age.

1995
01:35:22,926 --> 01:35:24,769
And I know you've heard a
million times, "life is short."

1996
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:28,439
But let me tell you something,
what this is teaching me

1997
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:31,643
is that life is goddamn short and
you can't waste a minute of it.

1998
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:36,113
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1999
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:44,456
The girl I brought
home to LA, Jamie?

2000
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:45,782
Yeah, what's going on with her?

2001
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:47,451
I think I messed it up.

2002
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,293
Fix it. She won't talk to me.

2003
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:51,747
Maybe she'll listen.
There's always a way.

2004
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:54,127
If you think
there's even a chance

2005
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:56,509
that she could
be it, you fix it.

2006
01:35:58,878 --> 01:36:00,300
Did Annie put you up to this?

2007
01:36:00,546 --> 01:36:01,638
Who's Annie?

2008
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:03,512
I'm kidding.

2009
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:04,634
What, I can't joke about this?

2010
01:36:04,801 --> 01:36:05,802
(LAUGHING)

2011
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,182

2012
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:08,517
I don't know what else to do.

2013
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:11,474
Let's go.

2014
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:13,647
You don't want to
finish your steak?

2015
01:36:13,977 --> 01:36:15,320
We're eating in
the goddamn airport.

2016
01:36:15,478 --> 01:36:16,855
I can leave the steak. Come on.

2017
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:19,232
Yeah, hey, this is
Dylan Harper from GQ.

2018
01:36:19,399 --> 01:36:21,026
We met a few
weeks ago at the...

2019
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:23,995
Right. Hey, can I ask you
a huge favor?

2020
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:25,412
Oh. I am so sorry, sir.

2021
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:26,614
It's my fault.

2022
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:28,364
You just scared me. No, no.
My fault. You all right?

2023
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:29,868
Yeah, I'm good.
Here, let me help you with that.

2024
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:31,165
Thanks, man.
You're really nice.

2025
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:32,579
All right. Hey, safe travels.

2026
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:33,914
All right, thanks, man.
Okay, thank you.

2027
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:35,044
Oh.

2028
01:36:35,164 --> 01:36:36,837
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

2029
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:38,759
All right, let's
dance, Clowny Brown.

2030
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:40,135
What's your problem with me?

2031
01:36:40,211 --> 01:36:41,758
I saw you at
that bar with Jamie.

2032
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:44,341
How could such an awesome
girl be with this

2033
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:45,850
over this?

2034
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:49,019
I've been trying to take that little
monkey to pound-town for years.

2035
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:51,355
I'll tell her you say hello.
What?

2036
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:53,604
You missed a little.
There you go.

2037
01:36:53,683 --> 01:36:55,356
Dylan! I got a cab. Come on.

2038
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:56,857
I ever run into you again,

2039
01:36:56,936 --> 01:36:59,359
I'll crush your earlobes and
make soup stock out of them.

2040
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:01,524
You have a vivid imagination.
I do!

2041
01:37:01,607 --> 01:37:02,699
I'm gonna get in the cab now.

2042
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:03,951
I'm gonna go make soup!

2043
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:05,904
What's the matter with her?
I don't know.

2044
01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:13,378
God! I thought LA was bad.
This traffic is terrible.

2045
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:14,788
Is there another
way into the city?

2046
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:27,308
DYLAN: I owe you
big time, Tommy.

2047
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:31,763
You'll make it up to me.
Actually, I was heading into town anyway.

2048
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:36,564
Tonight's the Butterfly Ball.
Great place to pick up dudes.

2049
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:37,773
You okay, Dad?

2050
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:38,986
Are you kidding?

2051
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:42,362
1937 Chris-Craft?
Couldn't get any better, buddy.

2052
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,566
Nice.

2053
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:47,991
Yeah. Hi, this is Dylan.
We met at...

2054
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:51,166
Right.
Can I ask you a huge favor?

2055
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:58,005
My number. Here's the remote.

2056
01:37:58,247 --> 01:37:59,749
My friend Dave
from across the hall,

2057
01:37:59,916 --> 01:38:01,418
his oven broke, so
he'll be using the kitchen.

2058
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:04,505
Your friend Dave is here using
the Kitchen or watching me?

2059
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:06,426
Go.

2060
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:08,303
Holy... What?

2061
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:10,267
"How to wear white
pants to a cookout."

2062
01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:13,521
Did you scoop the Times on this?
I smell Pulitzer.

2063
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:15,314
All right, all right.

2064
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:16,853
Just say hello to
her for me, will you?

2065
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,272
See you, Dad.

2066
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:21,191
Thanks, man.

2067
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:23,693
Hi, Dave from across the hall.

2068
01:38:23,773 --> 01:38:27,494
(SLOWLY AND LOUDLY) Hi, Mr.
Harper. How are you?

2069
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:29,954
And now we know
why you're here.

2070
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:34,542
Mom, I'm over by the Lexington exit.
Where are you?

2071
01:38:34,617 --> 01:38:36,745
LORNA: I'm standing right
by the guy in the tie.

2072
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:38,626
There are a million
guys in ties.

2073
01:38:38,788 --> 01:38:40,506
So look for the guy
I'm standing next to.

2074
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:43,467
You never do what you say you're gonna do.
When am I gonna learn?

2075
01:38:43,668 --> 01:38:45,170
Just hang on, baby.

2076

2077

What?

2078
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:55,142
I don? Think I'm gonna be
able to make it after all.

2079
01:38:55,221 --> 01:38:57,349
Something came up.
Let's meet tomorrow.

2080
01:38:57,473 --> 01:39:00,568
I'll be on the stairs.
Right across from you.

2081
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:06,490
Oh, my God.

2082
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:08,326
Have a great night, baby.

2083

(MOUTHING THE WORDS)

2085
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:29,259
What is this?

2086
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:32,054
It's Closing Time,
by the band Semisonic!

2087
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:34,639
It's not Third Eye Blind.
Can you believe that?

2088
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,518
No, no, no. Not the song. This.

2089
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:39,724
You said you wanted your life
to be like a movie.

2090
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:44,278
Sorry I had to use the real Grand
Central instead of the fake one.

2091
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:52,119
Listen, Jamie, I'm...

2092
01:39:52,195 --> 01:39:54,368
I'm having trouble hearing you!

2093
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:56,324
Yeah, I didn't
really think this through.

2094
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,751
I guess in the movies
the guy pours his heart out

2095
01:39:58,868 --> 01:40:00,245
and they put
the music in later.

2096
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:01,583
What?

2097
01:40:04,874 --> 01:40:06,046
I messed up.

2098
01:40:07,043 --> 01:40:08,545
I was scared.

2099
01:40:09,378 --> 01:40:11,096
Look at what happened
with my mom and my dad.

2100
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:12,306
Of course I was scared.

2101
01:40:13,466 --> 01:40:14,763
So I ruined it.

2102
01:40:15,718 --> 01:40:17,516
Everything that
happens in the day,

2103
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:20,769
all I can think to myself is, "I can't
wait to tell Jamie about this."

2104
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:24,895
When I see someone cursing, all
I picture is you blinking.

2105
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,947
And when I hear a kid's
been cured of cancer,

2106
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:30,324
I pray it's not
by that douchebag,

2107
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:33,323
tree-hugging fucking doctor
who ran out on you.

2108
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:35,663
I mean, cancer
being cured is awesome,

2109
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:37,949
but, you know,
I wish someone else did it.

2110
01:40:38,824 --> 01:40:40,121
Come on.

2111
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:47,425
Hey, I miss you.

2112
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:49,176
Yeah, I miss you, too.

2113
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:51,595
But you're not wrong,
I am damaged.

2114
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:53,973
So am I. Who isn't?

2115
01:40:54,257 --> 01:40:55,975
That's what
makes us so awesome.

2116
01:40:56,259 --> 01:40:57,932
And our tattoos. Yeah.

2117
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:01,268
No, no, no.

2118
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:02,602
Oh, shut up.
It's not what you think.

2119
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:05,609
Jamie, will you be
my best friend again?

2120
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:07,691
That is so lame.

2121
01:41:07,853 --> 01:41:08,945
I know.

2122
01:41:10,106 --> 01:41:11,733
That's some Prince Charming
shit, though, right?

2123
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:13,033
Get up. Okay.

2124
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,705
Look, I can live without ever
having sex with you again.

2125
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:19,289
It'd be really hard.

2127
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:23,370

best friend back,

Anything.

2131

Kiss me.

In public?
In front of all these people?

2133
01:41:34,964 --> 01:41:36,181
I did not ask you to...

2134
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:57,536
You can all go home now.

2135
01:42:04,076 --> 01:42:06,044
Okay. So...

What do we do now?

Didn't really ask, but go on.

I'm on a first date. So...

This isn't weird at all.

Look, the crew's laughing.

2164
01:49:16,258 --> 01:49:17,259
Oh!

2165
01:49:17,342 --> 01:49:18,889
They made me do it!
They made me do it.

2166
01:49:18,969 --> 01:49:20,016
(EVERYONE LAUGHING
AND CHEERING)

2167
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:22,272
It's my favorite part.

2168
01:49:22,598 --> 01:49:23,599
(GRUMBLING)
