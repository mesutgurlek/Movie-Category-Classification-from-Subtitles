(Audience talking)

00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:06,318
(Orchestra tuning up)

00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:12,158
(Baton tapping)

7
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,270
(People whispering...shhh)

8
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:18,600
(Feet pitter pattering on floor)

9
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:19,703
(Clears throat)

10
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:22,708
The story you are about to see,
has been told before.

11
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:24,352
A lot.

12
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:26,833
And now we are going to tell it, again.

13
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:28,349
But different.

14
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:30,693
It's about two star crossed lovers,

15
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:32,503
kept apart by a big feud.

16
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:35,179
No one knows how this feud started,

17
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,652
but it's all quite entertaining.

18
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:40,106
Unfortunately, before we begin.

19
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:43,944
There is a rather long boring prologue,
which I will read to you now.

20
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:46,135
(Clears throat)

21
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:47,962
Two households.

22
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:49,862
Both alike in dignity.

23
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:51,429
In fair Verona.

24
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:54,971
Where we lay our scene.

25
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:57,670
From ancient grudge.
Break to new mutiny.

26
00:01:57,675 --> 00:02:00,730
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

27
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:06,319
From forth the fatal loins of these two...AHHH.

28
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:29,360
Mr. Capulet: Ah Miss. Montague.
How you just love to ruin my day.

29
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:33,310
Miss Montague: My Sisters dear cardigan.
Mr. Capulet, it suits you.

30
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,195
-Capulet: Feisty old hag.
-Montague: Grumbly old codger.

31
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:40,206
(Horns honk)

32
00:02:44,258 --> 00:02:45,258
Oink...oink

33
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:48,149
(Rooster crows)

34
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:52,112
(Rooster crows in distance)

35
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,582
(Grunts)

36
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:56,374
Oh, great.

37
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:11,469
(Man shouts, falls from roof)

38
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,123
Sniff...sniff.

39
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:16,155
(Stretching sounds)

40
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:19,502
I got one! I got one!

41
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:25,277
I got one! I got one!

42
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:26,429
(Moans) Oh.

43
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:29,616
Hey, Winston. Throw us the ball.

44
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,847
*Background music 'Crocodile Rock'*

45
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:44,269
(Gagging)

46
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,250
Huh, Tybalt!

47
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,625
(Choking)

48
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,554
Hold on. Blues are at it again.

49
00:03:52,663 --> 00:03:53,663
(Pop!)

50
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,382
Lady Blueberry: Top of the morning, Lord Redbrick.

51
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:00,833
Lady Blueberry

52
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:04,996
Your tulips are looking a little limp this
year, aren't they.

53
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:07,758
Oh, I don't like what you're incinerating.

54
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,573
The proper word is 'insinuating'.

55
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,046
Illiterate.

56
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:13,456
I am not illiterate.

57
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:15,749
My parents were married!
(Clunk!)

58
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:22,832
(Sound of stone on stone)

59
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,150
Benny, come on. Let's go give those Reds
another lesson on how it's done.

60
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:29,596
(Giggles)

61
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:31,011
'Shroom all clear?

62
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:35,811
Lady Blueberry sings: Gnomeo, Gnomeo.

63
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,334
Benny: Gnomeo, it's your mum.

64
00:04:37,335 --> 00:04:39,094
Gnomeo: Oh no. Just get this out into the Alley.

65
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:40,716
-I'll catch up with you.
-Okay.

66
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:42,969
-Gnomeo, I can't..
-Have you ever seen,

67
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,607
...our beautiful, beautiful garden,

68
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:46,998
from this angle?

69
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:51,275
Oh. Oh yes, it's beautiful. The Wisteria.

70
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,993
Lady Blueberry: That tree was your
father's pride and joy.

71
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:57,270
May he rest in pieces.

72
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:01,120
Oh, how you remind me of him.

73
00:05:01,273 --> 00:05:03,078
Oh which is why I wanted to say.

74
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,197
I know, I know. My chores.

75
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:08,420
-Gnomeo...
-Edging trimming, planting, pruning,
consider it all done.

76
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:10,560
-Done, done, it's all like it....
-Gnomeo!

77
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,556
...done.

78
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:13,174
All I wanted to say was...

79
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:15,285
Good luck.

80
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:19,529
Thanks, mom.
(Foot steps sound like stone on stone)

81
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,596
Go out there and show them we
Blues are better than any Reds.

82
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,297
Red, I hate the word.

83
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:28,669
(Slamming door)

84
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:32,482
Wow.

85
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:35,014
Juliet: A 'Cupids Arrow' orchid.

86
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,771
Oh, Juliet!

87
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,457
Oh!
Whoa!

88
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,926
Hiya Dad. You won't believe what I found.

89
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,241
Oh, you want to get smashed?

90
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:52,928
A flower that will put that
blue garden to shame.

91
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:56,177
-Just across the alley.
-This feud business, is none of your concern.

92
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:59,436
And as leader of this garden it's up to me...

93
00:05:59,437 --> 00:06:01,706
Uh, I am a Red after all.

94
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:04,276
Oh, you're just as impulsivated
as your mother was.

95
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,360
Bless her to bits.

96
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:07,337
Now, back where you belong.

97
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,166
I  can't just stay tucked away on
this pedestal all my life.

98
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,557
Don't you see.

99
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,062
When will you realize you're delicate.

100
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:15,963
I'm not delicate.

101
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,899
She's definitely not delicate.

102
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,880
Lord Redbrick: Stubborn girl.

103
00:06:23,242 --> 00:06:24,934
Oh, right.

104
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,228
Delicate, hmm.

105
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:30,159
I'll show him who's delicate.

106
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:34,282
(Gnomes cheering)

107
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:41,015
Blue Gnomes chanting: Gnomeo, Gnomeo, Gnomeo.

108
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:43,867
Red Gnomes chanting: Tybalt, Tybalt, Tybalt.

109
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:47,510
-Gnomeo, Gnomeo.
-Okay boys,  ya all know the rules.

110
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:50,289
And I don't need to repeat them, but I'm gonna.

111
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,628
'Cus I wanna.

112
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:52,674
And here they are.

113
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,767
No biting, no scratching, no kicking.

114
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:57,358
No burping, no slurping, no prancing.

115
00:06:57,359 --> 00:07:00,704
No squalling, no laughing,
no heeing, no hawing.

116
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:02,358
And more than anything...

117
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,169
nooo cheating!

118
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,769
No cheating?
Hey, that's not fair.

119
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,956
*Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)*
-On your marks.

120
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:10,752

*It's getting late have you seen my mates.
Ma tell me when the boys get here.*

122

*It's seven o'clock and I want to rock.
Want to get a belly full of beer.*

123
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:30,477
*My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys.
And my old lady she don't care.*

124
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:36,077
*My sister looks cute in her braces and boots.
A handful of grease in her hair.*

125
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:45,643
*Whoa, don't give us none of your aggravation.
We had it with your discipline.*

126
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:51,354
*Whoa, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in.*

127
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:57,365
*Get about as oiled as a diesel train.
Gonna set this dance alight.*

128
00:07:58,322 --> 00:08:05,328
*Cause Saturday night's the night I like.

*Saturday night's all right.*

134
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:22,216
Whoa!

135

*Saturday...*

136
00:08:29,328 --> 00:08:30,328
(Taunting laugh)

137
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,580
(Wheels rumble on sidewalk)

138
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,813
-(Laughs)
-You're the greatest boss. The greatest by far.

139
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:47,546
All together: The greatest, the greatest by far.

140
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:52,282
Oh please, please my friends.
Tell me something I don't already know.

141
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,618
-A cheat, a cheat. That's what you are.
............-Huh?......................................

142
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:56,721
All together: A cheat, a cheat. That's what you are.

143
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,551
-All together: Umh!
-Well Benny.

144
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:02,983
I didn't think it was possible. But your mouth
is getting even bigger than your hat.

145
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,633
Tybalt, you just crossed the line.

146
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:09,517
Yeah, the 'finish' line.

147
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:12,811
Adios, loser.

148
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,261
(Taunting laughter)

149
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:17,876
Benny: Hey, come on out and fight, like a Gnome.

150
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:20,208
No body won't come out.

151
00:09:21,684 --> 00:09:23,685
-You'd better do something.
-This can't go on.

152
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:25,901
(Crowd angrily shouting)

153
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,894
Well if he won't come out.

154
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,908
-I guess we'll just have to go in.
-(Benny gasps in shock)

155
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:33,831
(Crowd gasps in shock.)

156
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:35,935
The Red garden. No one's ever been in there.

157
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:38,485
Then I say. It's about time someone did.

158
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,199
And payback is gonna be fun.

159
00:09:44,232 --> 00:09:45,232
(Sound of ripping tape.)

160

'Shroom, let's go kick some grass.

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,719
This mission into Red garden territory,

163
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,351
is gonna require maximum stealth.

164
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:13,996
Benny in deep voice: Well you won't get
much stealthier than this.

165
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:15,796
(High pitched voice) Hello.

166
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,666
(Ball in spray can rattles)
(Benny giggles)

167
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,218
(Snoring)
Mumbles: I got one.

168
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:37,991
(Snores)
Mumbles: I got one.

169
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:44,369
-Swim away , be free.
-Thank you.

170
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:50,990
(Whines) Oh.

171
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:55,840
(Snores)
Mumbles: I got one.

172
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,858
(Dog growling)

173
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,061
Oh, all this for some daffy flower.

174
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:19,836
Yes, it's the only way I'll ever
be taken seriously around here.

175
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:21,225
And I'm going to need you to cover me.

176
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:24,116
If my dad asks.
Just tell him I'm washing my hair.

177
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:26,965
I'm washing my hair.
I don't have hair.

178
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:28,273
He'll know it's a lie.

179
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:31,307
-No, my hair.
-Got it. I'm washing your hair.

180
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:33,949
Okay, okay. Whatever you say.

181
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,951
I'll be quick.

182
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,980
-(Gasps in fright)
-Growling.

183
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:39,905
-(Barking)
-(Juliet screams)

184
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,370
Out, out!

185
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:43,236
Man: Ben stop, over here boy.

186
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:45,792
Wow! That was quick.

187
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:47,129
I'm to easy to see.

188
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:49,007
I'm going to need some kind of disguise.

189
00:11:49,103 --> 00:11:51,167
Oooo, a new outfit.

190
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:52,276
I'm on it.

191
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:58,099
Here.

192
00:11:58,186 --> 00:11:59,481
That is cute.

193
00:11:59,697 --> 00:12:00,963
Give it a turn.

194
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:03,979
Ah, huh. Ah huh.
Nice junk in the trunk.

195
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:06,426
Now go get your flower.

196
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,861
Uh, maybe a tad less florescent pink?

197
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,237
How much less?

198
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:12,723
Try black.

199
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:18,779
Aaaaaaah!

200
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:24,286
(Happily giggles)

201
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:30,002
Trust me, nobody is going to pay you
any attention in that.

202
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:31,196
Then it's perfect.

203
00:12:36,974 --> 00:12:41,456
Oooo,
(Speaking Japanese)

204
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:44,556
I'm going in.

205
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:54,995
Take care.

206
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:57,351
(Shouts) I'm telling your Dad
you're doing your hair.

207
00:12:57,352 --> 00:12:58,353
(Tiredly sighs)

208
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,359
Let's play a game.

209
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,353
I'm thinking of a movie.

210
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:04,173
It's a...it's one word.

211
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:06,841
And it starts with a...'spider'.

212
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:08,349
All: Is it, Spiderman?

213
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,621
Oh you're good, okay.

214
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:16,602
(Snores)

215
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:21,441
(Small gnomes giggling)

216
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:30,234
Great, I love going commando.

217
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:32,179
Shh, I know, just the key.

218
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:42,731
(Ball in can rattling)

219
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,057
(Can rattles)

220
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:47,347
Shhh.

221
00:13:55,983 --> 00:13:56,983
(Can rattle's loudly)

222
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,508
Okay, I have another one.

223
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,732
Two words.
The first word is, 'Spiderman'.

224
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:06,890
All: Spiderman Two?

225
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:09,069
Okay, who's cheating?

226
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:13,542
(Door creaks)

227
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,352
Benny, give me the paint.

228
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,609
Benny?

229
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:23,858
Gnomeo whispers: No!

230
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:27,892
(Snoring.)

231
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:31,514
(Shakes can, ball rattling.)
-Benny!

232
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:32,518
Benny!

233
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:43,991
-Huh?
-Huh?

234
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:47,633
-Tybalt!
-Get them you idiots.

235
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:49,475
Run for it, now.

236
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:51,622
(Sound of dropping bowling pins)

237
00:14:56,107 --> 00:14:57,422
Tybalt: Where did he go?

238
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:58,928
Small red Gnome: He's in the begonia's.

239
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:02,135
-Well, do I look like a begonia?
-No, more like a pansy.

240
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:03,155
Find him!

241
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:05,556
-Not here.
-Not here, either.

242
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:09,608
Nothing but Pansies here.

243
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Come on.

244
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:19,969
Hold on.

245
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,947
Whoa, whoooa!

246
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:22,970
-Hey, Benny
-What?

247
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:25,140
-See you on the other side.
-Benny: Gnomeo!

248
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,159
Benny: Nooo!

249
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,554
Ah, ha, ha.

250
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:40,999
(Both angrily shouting)

251
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:52,546
Capulet: Hmm.

252
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:55,844
(Growls in anger)

253
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:04,234
I wish I could stay but...

254
00:16:04,235 --> 00:16:06,316
...gotta fly.

255
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:18,433
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Whoooa!

256
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,189
(Sound of branches breaking)

257
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:24,908
Huh!

258
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:33,132
(Birds chirping)

259
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,540
*Elton John, Lady Gaga: Hello, Hello*

260
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:45,568
*Feel I'm feeling light*

261
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:48,771
(Stone feet tapping on wall)

262
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:52,668
*I like to see the sights.*

263
00:16:56,133 --> 00:17:00,227
*Ain't life a many splendored thing?*

264
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:05,916
*Ducking up and down*

265
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:08,669
*All these crazy sights and sounds*

266
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,874
*Bounce around like puppets on a string.*

267
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:20,120
*Never gonna find, anything to change my mind.*

268
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:24,269
*Famous last lines of a fool*

269
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,104
*Just when you think.*

270
00:17:28,105 --> 00:17:30,872
*Your chain is just one link.*

271
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:35,371
*Something comes to tip you off your stool.*

272
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:39,310
*Hello, hello.
Hello, hello.*

273
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:42,062
*My, my, my what have we here?*

274
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:46,183
*What a surprise.
What a surprise!*

275
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:48,712
*Hello, hello.
Hello, hello.*

276
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:51,734
*I'm not alone, it's good to know.*

277
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:56,206
*Someone's out there saying hello.*

278
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,834
*Heeeellooooo.*

279
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:03,505
Um, you're probably wondering what I'm doing
on the roof of your greenhouse.

280
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:06,208
It's just that, well I thought no one lived here.

281
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:09,777
Yeah, they don't. I mean I don't.
This isn't...this isn't my garden.

282
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:12,782
Oh, well that's good.
Because I just came to get that Orchid.

283
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:15,225
-Oh, this?
-Yes.

284
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:16,226
(Sniffs)

285
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,555
I don't know. I think I'm going to
have to keep ahold of this one.

286
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,762
What? But I saw it first.

287
00:18:20,763 --> 00:18:22,866
So why don't you just hand it over.

288
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:24,441
Well I grabbed it first.

289
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:26,252
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.

290
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:27,602
But if you want it.

291
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:29,546
-Come and get it.
-All right.

292
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,950
Thanks.

293
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:32,006
Aaaah!

294
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:34,401
-Nice greenhouse, hey.
-Oh yeah. You should see it from here.

295
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:35,420
What, and miss this view?

296
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:42,865
-Who's your Gno-me.
-Who's your Gno-me?

297
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,910
Whoa!

298
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,519
((Clang))

299
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:47,095
Who's your Gno-me now?

300
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:52,665
*Hello, Hello.*
-Hey!

301
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:55,573
*My, my, my what have we here?*

302
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:59,886
*What a surprise.
What a surprise!*

303
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:02,092
*Hello, Hello.
Hello, Hello*

304
00:19:02,093 --> 00:19:05,360
*I'm not alone, it's good to know*

305
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:10,074
*Someone's out there saying, hello*

306
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:12,420
*Hello.*

307
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:18,577
*-Helloooooooooooooooooooooo
...................................-Heeeello.*

308
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:21,145
*Hello, hello.*

309
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:23,755
*Heeeellooooo.*

310

*Hello,
hellooooooooooo.*

311
00:19:27,671 --> 00:19:29,123
(Sound of branch breaking)

312
00:19:43,234 --> 00:19:45,257
Oh no, he's a blue.

313
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:46,345
Not a blue.

314
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:58,179
(Gasps)

315
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:08,035
Juliet. You're not off of your pedestal.
What are you doing out here?

316
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:12,446
I'm...oh, well I can ask you the same
question, Tybalt.

317
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:14,036
We're looking for a blue Gnome.

318
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:15,640
Yeah, he's an ugly little fellow.

319
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:17,613
Got a scratch, right here.

320
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:19,430
And his name's Gnomeo.

321
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:21,551
You haven't seen him, have you?

322
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:23,248
Uhhhhooo, um.

323
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:26,435
Uhh, he sounds awful, no.

324
00:20:26,436 --> 00:20:29,766
I...I...uh...certainly haven't seen him.
I haven't seen him at all.

325
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:30,986
Well lucky you.

326
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,850
Come on, let's get inside.

327
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,612
Juliet.

328
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:53,234
Gnomeo: A red.

329
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:57,329
Why of all things, did she have to be a red?

330
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,382
Sooo, where is the oh so important,
life changing orchid?

331
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:07,389
Juliet: Um...

332
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:09,345
Um...

333
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:11,717
What, what orchid?

334
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:20,688
What?

335
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,115
Hmmm?

336
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:24,766
Shut up!

337
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:27,110
You met a boy.

338
00:21:27,156 --> 00:21:29,693
What? No! Well maybe...

339
00:21:29,694 --> 00:21:32,537
Sort of, um...yes!

340
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:33,786
Yes I did.

341
00:21:33,787 --> 00:21:35,793
I need details.

342
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,606
And go slowly, is he totally gorgeous?

343
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:41,184
-Totally.
-Does he have a nice rotund belly?

344
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:42,921
Well let's call it sturdy.

345
00:21:42,922 --> 00:21:45,274
And his uh..(Whistles up)

346
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:48,201
-His hat, is um..
-Big and pointy?

347
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:51,296
And, you know I suppose in a certain light.

348
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:53,516
You might say it looks sort of...

349
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:54,868
...blue.

350
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:00,096
Blue.

351
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:03,616
Ah, this is one of your little jokes.

352
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:05,768
(Madly laughs)

353
00:22:06,214 --> 00:22:07,508
No, I don't get it.

354
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:12,923
(Gasps) Oh flipping, flaming Dora's sheep,
you cannot take with a blue.

355
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:14,883
Shh, shush Nanette, just zip it.

356
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:15,980
Zzzzip.

357
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:21,803
Oh Juliet, this is fantastic!

358
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:24,430
-Is it?
-It's doomed.

359
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:26,952
-What?
-A red and a blue.

360
00:22:26,953 --> 00:22:28,949
*Romantic music*
It just can't be.

361
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,297
So it's a doomed love.

362
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:33,405
And that's the best kind.

363
00:22:33,574 --> 00:22:34,913
You'll never see him again.

364
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:39,184
And then one day when he dies, you'll be all,
"Oh, my true love".

365
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,098
"I only saw him once".

366
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,119
(Gasps and moans with sorrow)

367
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,920
(Whines, moans, and groans with longing and pain)

368
00:22:49,728 --> 00:22:51,580
I'll only see...what do you mean?

369
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:54,549
What are you talking about, once?
I'll only see him once.

370
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:57,674
How romantically tragic.

371
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:00,544
Your love is doomed.

372
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,869
Your love is dead.

373
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,115
Your love is doomed.

374
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,378
Your love is dead.

375
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:05,847
It's doomed.

376
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:08,195
-It's dead.
-I'll only see him...once?

377
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:09,233
Nanette: Dooomed!

378
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,239
Conjoined Gnome: I've never seen
Lord Redbrick so riled up.

379
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,592
We have to find Gnomeo.

380
00:23:23,814 --> 00:23:24,814
Let's split up.

381
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:30,173
(Sighs) I wish I could quit ya.

382
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,356
Both: Hmm.

383
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:32,397
Oh well.

384
00:23:32,398 --> 00:23:33,445
Let's go fishing.

385
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:36,086
(Gate creeks)

386
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:38,996
((Sniffs))

387
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:40,814
All right, mate.

388
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:45,908
Go find, Gnomeo.

389
00:23:51,448 --> 00:23:53,400
Nanette: Doomed!
Dead!

390
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:57,493
Doomed, dead.
Doomed, dead.

391
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:06,888
Oh, Gnomeo.

392
00:24:07,098 --> 00:24:09,956
Gnomeo, are we really doomed, Gnomeo.

393
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:11,558
To never see each other again?

394
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,754
Why must you wear a blue hat?

395
00:24:13,755 --> 00:24:16,207
Why couldn't it be red like my father, or...

396
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,580
green like a leprechaun, or...

397
00:24:18,581 --> 00:24:20,346
or purple like, um...

398
00:24:20,347 --> 00:24:23,621
like uh, like some weird guy.

399
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:24,808
I mean what's in a Gnome?

400
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:27,780
Because you're blue my father sees red,
and because I'm red I'm feeling blue.

401
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:30,982
Oh at any rate, that shouldn't be the thing
to keep us apart.

402
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:33,413
-Should it?
-Gnomeo: No, no! It shouldn't.

403
00:24:33,414 --> 00:24:35,058
I couldn't have said it better myself.

404
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,587
Oh my giddy aunt, did you just hear all of that?

405
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:39,781
-What are you doing here?
-I don't know, um...

406
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:41,903
I came here, to...

407
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:44,751
Well... I don't know,
I just wanted to see you again.

408
00:24:44,752 --> 00:24:46,097
Are you crazy?

409
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:48,914
If dad finds you, he'll bury you under the patio.

410
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:51,806
Find me, are you kidding?
Stealth is my middle name.

411
00:24:52,873 --> 00:24:53,873
(Creaking and Tiki room song slowly starting)

412
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:56,329
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*

413
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,229
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
-Turn it off.

414
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,939
I'm trying.

415
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,926
*In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*

416
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:07,923
*Welcome to our tropical hideaway,*
-Juliet: Do something.
-The button's stuck.

417
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,390
*If we weren't in the show starting right away,*

418
00:25:11,394 --> 00:25:13,120
Ah, Juliet!

419
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:16,318
*All together! In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room*
Come on man, off.

420
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:17,633
There's somebody behind you!

421
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:18,891
Gnomeo: Shroom!

422
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:20,012
Whoa, whoa...whoaaa!

423
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,141
Juliet! What's the big....

424
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:26,050
Oooo, you look like a fun guy.

425
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:27,896
Excuse me, little help here.

426
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:29,629
Juliet: My dad's coming.

427
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:31,704
So, you must be, Gnomeo.

428
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:32,968
Lovely to meet you.

429
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:35,157
Even though it's seconds,
before you're discovered and killed.

430
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,494
-Quick, hide.
-Lord Redbrick: Juliet!

431
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:40,570
I told you before, no music in the
grotto after ten o'clock.

432
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,540
What's going on here?

433
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:46,178
Um, It was a...

434
00:25:46,231 --> 00:25:48,006
Um, ...I saw a squirrel.

435
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:50,066
And he...he...

436
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:51,148
...dropped his nuts.

437
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,239
Yes, nuts.
The size of...boulders.

438
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,341
Yes, all right. Thank you, Nanette.

439
00:25:56,342 --> 00:25:58,944
Well, okay. But no mucking about.

440
00:25:58,945 --> 00:26:00,184
Especially not tonight.

441
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,259
We've been attacked.
By a blue!

442
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,530
And if I ever get my hands on the blue?

443
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,560
He'll be sleeping with the fishes.

444
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,486
Now I'm not a man who is rounded up easily.

445
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,267
Lord Redbrick, I've been having
problems with my...(Mumbles incoherently)

446
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:15,575
-Your what?
-(Mumbles incoherently)

447
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:17,791
I guess this isn't the best time to talk.

448
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:18,833
It's not ideal.

449
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:19,953
-But I...
-Just go.

450
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,136
-Please go.
-...just came here to say I.

451
00:26:22,137 --> 00:26:23,553
-Um...
-What?

452
00:26:23,554 --> 00:26:25,709
What did you want?
Oh, sorry!

453
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,217
Juliet, is there something wrong with the pond?

454
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,642
The pond? No, what this pond?
No it's fine.

455
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:31,553
I mean it's just as pondy as ever.
(Nervously laughs)

456
00:26:31,554 --> 00:26:33,848
Oh my gosh, what is that thing over there?

457
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:35,087
Lord Redbrick: What? What was it?

458
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:37,182
-Juliet: That thing, over there.
-Lord Redbrick: What did it look like?

459
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:40,412
-Juliet: Oh, it looked like a really, uh.
-Okay. Goodbye then, off you go.

460
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:45,483
Thanks for popping by. Goodnight sweet prince,
and flights of angels, or pigeons or sparrows, or whatever.

461
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:48,873
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

462
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:54,269
(Dejected) Oh!

463
00:26:57,185 --> 00:26:58,185
(Hopeful) Oh.

464
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:00,200
Nanette, where's Gnomeo?

465
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,928
-Is he gone?
-Yep, gone forever.

466
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:02,984
What?

467
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:06,928
Whoa!

468
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:11,016
I think you'll find this 'does' actually belong to you.

469
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,673
Thank you.

470
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,337
-I can't go.
-I know  how you feel.

471
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:31,246
No, really. I'm stuck.

472
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:35,693
(Both Laugh)

473
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:38,677
So, uh, heh...

474
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:40,071
Can I see you again tomorrow?

475
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:41,503
Yes, but not here.

476
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:42,972
Back in the old Lawrence place then?

477
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:44,426
-Noon?
-Not soon enough.

478
00:27:44,427 --> 00:27:45,573
I can do 11:45.

479
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:46,523
Done.

480
00:27:46,524 --> 00:27:48,053
That frog was right.

481
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:50,889
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

482
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,385
-Thanks Nanette.
-You know he's going to ditch you,
when he finds how much you weigh.

483
00:28:04,536 --> 00:28:06,043
Shroom, you see this face?

484
00:28:06,044 --> 00:28:07,783
It's a happy Gnome face.

485
00:28:08,211 --> 00:28:09,211
Now come here.

486
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:10,550
Come on.

487
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:17,656
(Wild birds singing)

488
00:28:22,046 --> 00:28:28,016
(Miss Montague singing happily)

489
00:28:31,716 --> 00:28:33,755
(((Crash)))
(Miss Montague screams)

490
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,237
Mr. Capulet: Outrage, infamy!

491
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:39,235
Mr. Capulet: The gardening gloves
are off then, are they?

492
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:40,782
Miss Montague: You, wrecking my mower.

493
00:28:40,783 --> 00:28:43,963
Mr. Capulet: Dear lady,
you are insane in the brain.

494
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,123
Miss Montague: I never thought that even you'd
stoop to such levels.

495
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:51,251
Mr. Capulet: Oh, and by the way, kindly stop
stealing my underwear.

496
00:28:51,252 --> 00:28:54,803
Miss Montague: In your dreams,
you jacked off cabbage.

497
00:28:54,804 --> 00:28:58,265
Mr. Capulet: Oh, how could she do this
to Tybalts wishing well?

498
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,775
Mmm, my sweet little flower boy.

499
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:03,044
Why would anyone ever pick on you?

500
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:07,952
Miss Montague: Who thinks I should
order the best, new lawnmower?

501
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,846
Money can buy.

502
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,834
(Laughs)

503
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:15,619
(scrubbing)

504
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:20,151
Why would anyone do this to, Tybalt?

505
00:29:20,152 --> 00:29:21,885
All: Because nobody likes him.

506
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:25,111
-(Growls)
-So what are we going to do?

507
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,745
Find their weak spot.

508
00:29:29,474 --> 00:29:30,972
Then what are we going to do?

509
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,250
Damage.

510
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,950
Lot's and lot's of damage.

511
00:29:40,135 --> 00:29:43,388
(Both evilly laughing)

512
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:51,909
(Minions continue to laugh)

513
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:56,967
(Keys tapping)
Miss Montague: Right.

514
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:59,533
Mess with me will you, Capulet.

515
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,785
I'll show him what, that old pompous.

516
00:30:02,827 --> 00:30:05,533
It's not over, not by a long shot.

517
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:11,947
Miss Montague: Yeah, uh, right.
What have we got here?

518
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:14,009
Show the world the mighty web.

519
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,439
Miss Montague: Oh, no. No, no, not good.

520
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:17,857
Pick one.

521
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:19,830
-Yes, that one.
-Miss Montague: No.

522
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,789
Benny: Oh, yes that one.

523
00:30:22,627 --> 00:30:23,627
Miss Montague: What's this?

524
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:26,179
<i>(Excited Male announcer) Are you losing the war in your garden?</i>

525
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,558
<i>Well brother maybe it's time
for a secret weapon.</i>

526
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:31,572
<i>Terrafirminator!</i>

527
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:34,444
<i>It's the most useless, 500 horse power...</i>

528
00:30:34,445 --> 00:30:38,030
<i>ground dominating piece of hardware,
the world has ever seen.</i>

529
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,962
<i>TERRAFIRMINATOR!!</i>

530
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,156
<i>It's unnecessarily volatile.</i>

531
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,186
<i>Now with 75% more power!</i>

532
00:30:46,187 --> 00:30:48,110
<i>It clears
Echoes: Clears.</i>

533
00:30:48,111 --> 00:30:49,698
<i>It digs
Echoes: Digs.</i>

534
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:51,309
<i>It mow's
Echo: Mow's.</i>

535
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,841
<i>Your lawn will be afraid to grow.</i>

536
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:56,020
<i>Terrafirminator!</i>

537
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,604
<i>Get the weapon that plans destruction!</i>

538
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:02,237
(Babbling side effects and disclaimers)

539
00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:04,983
(Greedily Laughs) That one.

540
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:06,221
Miss Montague: Oh my.

541
00:31:06,802 --> 00:31:09,653
Benny pleads: Pick, pick that one.
Please, please pick that one.

542
00:31:10,157 --> 00:31:11,553
Benny: Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

543
00:31:12,185 --> 00:31:14,180
Miss Montague: That's a bit in-your-face.

544
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:16,452
Miss Montague: This is more my speed.

545
00:31:16,972 --> 00:31:17,972
(Meow)

546
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:20,447
Oh, not the Kitten Clipper.

547
00:31:20,448 --> 00:31:22,289
Oh, no.

548
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:27,061
*Elton John and Kiki Dee:
Don't go breaking my heart*

549
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,347
Definitely not.

550
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:41,259
*Don't go breaking my heart.
I couldn't if I tried.*

551
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:48,320
*Oh honey if I get restless.
Baby you're not that kind.*

552
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:49,353
(Strong wind)

553
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:56,860
*Don't go breaking my heart.
You take the weight off of me.*

554
00:31:58,381 --> 00:32:04,109
*Oh Honey when you knocked on my door.
Ooo, I gave you my key*

555
00:32:06,211 --> 00:32:11,322
*Wooo, hoo Nobody knows it.*

556
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:14,855
*When I was down*

557
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:16,778
*I was your clown*

558
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,254
*Right from the start.
I gave you my heart.*

559
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:25,656
*Whoooooa oh, I gave you my heart.*

560
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:33,388
*Don't go breaking my heart.
I won't go breaking your heart*

561
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:36,253
*Don't go breaking my,
don't go breaking my...*

562
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,663
*Don't go breaking my heart.*

563

I won't go breaking your heart.*

570
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:03,398
Lord Redbrick: Juliet. There you are.

571
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:07,496
-Hi dad.
-I've been ruminating about our
little discussion yesterday.

572
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:10,843
-But I was just...
-What you need is companionship.

573
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:12,387
-Huh?
-Someone to look after you.

574
00:33:12,388 --> 00:33:13,631
Who'll keep you safe.

575
00:33:13,632 --> 00:33:15,254
-What?
-You know Paris, don't you.

576
00:33:15,255 --> 00:33:16,686
Yes, yes of course, why?

577
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:18,918
Well he's come to pay you a visitation.

578
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:20,497
-Dad!
-All right, all right.

579
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,199
No one will ever say I don't
know when I'm not wanted.

580
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,907
-Lord Redbrick: Toodles.
-Uh, got something for you.

581
00:33:24,908 --> 00:33:26,561
Here it is, gypsaphilla.

582
00:33:26,562 --> 00:33:29,123
Lovely, what does it mean?
It means love woodchuck.

583
00:33:29,124 --> 00:33:32,180
Although ironically it grows better in a clay soil.
It's weird isn't it.

584
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:35,115
You think you got it down and bram,
you do some readings and it turns out it's clay soil.

585
00:33:35,116 --> 00:33:36,544
Even though you thought
it was a level of chalk.

586
00:33:36,545 --> 00:33:37,551
Weird.

587
00:33:37,695 --> 00:33:41,328
-Right, well it's been terribly nice meeting you.
-Where are you going, stop, no.

588
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:44,209
You can obviously do what you want.
But my point is it's surely a bit,

589
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,081
rude to leave me on a first date.

590
00:33:46,082 --> 00:33:48,770
-First date?
-Yeah, and I thought what does a boyfriend.

591
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:50,072
-Boyfriend?
-Get his girlfriend.

592
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:53,676
-Girlfriend?
-Oooo, this is good.

593
00:33:53,677 --> 00:33:55,757
A small token of my affection.

594
00:33:56,062 --> 00:33:57,914
Oh, wow!

595
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,663
Juliet, do you realize what this is?

596
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,825
It is my own hybrid, a foxglove and buttercup.

597
00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:06,062
Oh, a love triangle.

598
00:34:06,063 --> 00:34:07,366
Which I call, Foxcup.

599
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:10,617
And you. I never knew you were such a devil.

600
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:14,504
Well, I mean I know,
I've got my dark side, sure.

601
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:16,664
Hey there, Juliet.

602
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:18,190
What a name, it's a great name.

603
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:19,846
Goes with your, eyes.

604
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:22,570
You're looking really cool.
You're looking good.

605
00:34:22,571 --> 00:34:24,865
Did it hurt when you fell down from heaven?

606
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:26,477
That's a killer, man.

607
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:28,474
Yeah, uh, no. You're looking cool.

608
00:34:28,475 --> 00:34:30,269
Yeah, so how's it going with you, baby?

609
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,507
-Oh I'm fine, Baby. How are you?
-Gaaahh!

610
00:34:32,508 --> 00:34:34,991
Uh, (uneasy laugh) never better.

611
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:36,208
(Wood pile creaks)

612
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:41,589
Do you think anyone heard that?

613
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,855
(whispers) There's nobody here.

614
00:34:42,856 --> 00:34:44,376
(Whispers) Then why are you whispering?

615
00:34:44,377 --> 00:34:46,263
(Softly) Why are you whispering.

616
00:34:46,457 --> 00:34:47,457
(Giggles)

617
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,294
Oh, look at that.

618
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,798
Guess we're done with the whispering thing.

619
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:58,405
It's a 1950's Macalister Ranger.

620
00:34:58,574 --> 00:34:59,829
Let's start her up.

621
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,123
Yeah, okay.

622
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:03,347
Check out the power on this beauty.

623
00:35:03,429 --> 00:35:04,429
(Engine sputters)

624
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:08,750
She's empty.

625
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:10,750
Bingo!

626
00:35:13,651 --> 00:35:15,350
-Juliet: Hey, try this.
-Thanks.

627
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:23,867
(Breeze blowing out)

628
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:26,661
(Both coughing)

629
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:36,525
(Creaks, door slams)

630
00:35:43,278 --> 00:35:44,994
-Is that you?
-Yeah.

631
00:35:44,995 --> 00:35:46,063
Yeah, it's me.

632
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:47,571
(Unknown voice) It's me, too!

633
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:49,589
(Both screaming)

634
00:35:52,446 --> 00:35:53,446
What was that?

635
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:54,785
I have no idea.

636
00:35:56,176 --> 00:35:59,098
Okay, whatever you are.
Come out, slowly.

637
00:35:59,265 --> 00:36:01,725
I have a loaded stic...uh, weapon.

638
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,602
And...and I'm not afraid to use it.

639
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:06,477
Do you think I scared it?

640
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:08,992
(Spanish accent)
Oh definitely, I know I'm scared.

641
00:36:10,484 --> 00:36:13,127
Look at that baby, huh.
Watch me now.

642
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:16,321
(Scats) Ooo...uh...ooo....aah.

643
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:18,937
Oh by the way, thanks for finding my leg.

644
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,361
And setting me free.

645
00:36:20,531 --> 00:36:22,187
I love you!

646
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:25,920
Do you know what it's like to
be trapped for thirty years?

647
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:27,821
All alone, by yourself.

648
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:29,721
No one for to talk at.

649
00:36:29,722 --> 00:36:32,817
Hola, Featherstone,
como esta usted? (How are you?)

650
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:36,718
Ah, bueno, Featherstone,
how's the other leg?

651
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:39,605
I don't know Featherstone, remember
I don't have it.

652
00:36:39,606 --> 00:36:42,407
You see, I'm not exactly
terrific company, am I?

653
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,519
Sorry but, we didn't think anybody lived here.

654
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,468
Yeah, we shouldn't be here.
We'll be going.

655
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,754
-What if he follows us?
-Then our parents find out.

656
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:52,624
Oh no. Nanette was right, we're doomed.

657
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:58,583
Oh, oh, oh. Pup, pup, pup.
You cannot ever pull the wools
over these beady eyes.

658
00:36:58,585 --> 00:37:02,319
Oh, ho. I think that you two are on a date.

659
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:04,512
Both: Date! No, no not dating.

660
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,470
-Fighting, yeah.
-Yeah, that's what it is. To the death.

661
00:37:06,471 --> 00:37:08,141
-Juliet: Mortal enemies here.
-Yeah, don't you see it?

662
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,963
-He's a blue.
-And she's a red.

663
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:11,540
And I'm pink!

664
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:12,875
Who cares?

665
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,584
Anyway, I got to ask.

666
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:18,102
Why are you bringing her
to a dumpy place like this?

667
00:37:18,813 --> 00:37:20,068
Ohh, I know, I know.

668
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:22,356
Un momento, I'll be right back.

669
00:37:25,926 --> 00:37:26,926
(Engine starts)

670
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:28,833
Juliet, wait.

671
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:32,424
Oh, here it comes.
I'm to delicate, right?

672
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:35,450
No, no I was going to say.
Don't hold back, let her rip.

673
00:37:35,451 --> 00:37:36,602
Oh, really?

674
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:37,692
Yeah.

675
00:37:38,211 --> 00:37:39,211
(Laughs with joy)

676
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:41,353
Gnomeo: GO!

677
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:44,821
Whoo, hoo, hoo!

678
00:37:58,425 --> 00:37:59,425
Ta da!

679
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,189
Featherstone: Whoo, look at that.
This is definite improvement.

680
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,905
Fantastic penmanship, too.
But you know...

681
00:38:05,906 --> 00:38:08,578
We still got to do something about these weeds.

682
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,941
They're not weeds.
Those dandelions are wishes.

683
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,544
Well I don't know. A weed
by any other name is still a weed.

684
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:16,300
Go on, make a wish.
And then blow on it.

685
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,129
(Takes in deep breath. Blows over it)

686
00:38:19,316 --> 00:38:20,316
(Takes in deep breath)

687
00:38:22,286 --> 00:38:24,171
It's kinda hard with a beak, huh?

688
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:28,514
Kinda pass you out, huh?

689
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,014
I going to sit down now.

690
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:32,036
(Both laughing)

691
00:38:32,465 --> 00:38:34,161
I've got a confession to make.

692
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:37,142
I've never actually driven a mower.

693
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:38,535
No, you're a natural.

694
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:42,331
Well my dad, he's a little over protective.

695
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:51,510
You know this is crazy, right?

696
00:38:52,202 --> 00:38:53,202
Yeah.

697
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:56,055
I just never imagined that I could fall for a red.

698
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:57,369
Oh and me a blue.

699
00:38:57,774 --> 00:38:59,027
No way.

700
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,227
My whole life my mom raised me to
hate you guys. You reds.

701
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,142
So, this could never work.

702
00:39:05,774 --> 00:39:06,774
Could it?

703
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:09,765
Well a red and a blue.
It just can't be.

704
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:11,383
Can it?

705
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:16,385
(Featherstone blowing)
Look it's kinda like snowing, but it's not.

706
00:39:16,902 --> 00:39:19,385
Oh baby, you know I
getting into this now.

707
00:39:19,386 --> 00:39:20,940
See the trick is to go like... (Blows sharp)

708
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,237
Then you get them all with one.
You don't have to...(Blow's short)

709
00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:28,928
Ah, I wish that we could all come back.
And do this tomorrow.

710
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:32,131
And uh, I promise.

711
00:39:32,655 --> 00:39:35,030
Your secret is safe with me.

712
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:37,420
Well, should we?

713
00:39:37,671 --> 00:39:39,565
I can do 11:45.

714
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:41,309
Not soon enough.

715
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:57,863
(Sighs contentedly)

716
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:03,021
Oomph! Hey Shroom, what's up buddy.

717
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:05,233
Careful there, you're going to kick something.

718
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:06,531
What's eating you?

719
00:40:08,086 --> 00:40:09,086
Huh?

720
00:40:11,562 --> 00:40:12,834
(Lady Blueberry Crying) How?

721
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,120
Lady Blueberry: How?

722
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:17,276
-Mom
-So beautiful...Gnomeo.

723
00:40:17,523 --> 00:40:19,626
How could this have happened?

724
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:21,505
Well, where were you?

725
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:22,661
I was...

726
00:40:23,076 --> 00:40:24,076
(Sniffles)

727
00:40:24,164 --> 00:40:25,591
I was nowhere.

728
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,242
Don't worry mom, I'll make it up to you.

729
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:32,465
How, Redbrick and his hoodlums have destroyed,

730
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:35,486
the most beautiful thing we blues have.

731
00:40:37,027 --> 00:40:39,314
Your father planted her.

732
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:42,566
We raised her from a seedling.

(Sobs)

735
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:51,292
Those blasted Reds, come on.

736
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:53,214
We'll make them pay.

737
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:54,542
(Gnomes shouting for revenge)

738
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,032
Every last one of them.

739
00:40:58,282 --> 00:40:59,282
(Shouts in anger)

740
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,550
Every last one?

-My dad can really pick them.
-Can he just.

It's  not as bad as all that.

Is that your big move on a second date?

774
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:46,580
You wine them, dine them and
then spray them with weed killer?

775

You got to admit, it is original.

...after incident 'Wisteria'.
How do you think that looks?

Just a toilet in the middle of a yard,
with nothing growing out of it.

I'm sorry.

00:45:31,737 --> 00:45:32,737
*Elton John: Love builds a garden*

801
00:45:33,058 --> 00:45:39,166
*You hear it every day
Once upon a time they say*

802
00:45:39,701 --> 00:45:46,713
*Once upon a time in this place
I looked and saw on your face*

803
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:52,113
*A smile that spoke to me in oh so many ways*

804
00:45:52,644 --> 00:45:53,644
*Then*

805
00:46:00,573 --> 00:46:06,335
*We'd get a little rain
Then the sun came out again*

806
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:13,200
*But a frost, it's hard to fight
Once it takes hold flowers die*

807
00:46:13,201 --> 00:46:18,687
*There's only so much you can do,
to keep some things alive*

808
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:25,606
*That love built a garden.
Grew it from the ground up*

809
00:46:26,467 --> 00:46:32,242
*Each one of us knowing,
every inch of it was us.*

810
00:46:32,648 --> 00:46:39,019
*We pulled it all together,
hoping and believing.*

811
00:46:39,267 --> 00:46:45,736
*That love built this garden
for the two of us to dream in.*

812
00:47:00,366 --> 00:47:06,166
You know, other people's hate, destroyed my love.

813
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,532
And...

814
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:10,193
I couldn't do nothing about it.

815
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:14,981
But you...

816
00:47:15,117 --> 00:47:16,758
...you can.

817
00:47:25,215 --> 00:47:29,107
You know I think that crazy pink
plastic bird might be right.

818
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:31,038
What if we never went back?

819
00:47:31,714 --> 00:47:33,479
Never go back?

820
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:35,205
But what about my Dad?

821
00:47:35,332 --> 00:47:37,044
And Nanette and the red garden?

822
00:47:37,045 --> 00:47:40,276
You see the truth is, over there, we're enemies.

823
00:47:40,377 --> 00:47:43,086
But here, here we're a matching pair.

824
00:47:44,812 --> 00:47:49,320
Juliet, will you stay here, and
build a garden with me?

825
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:51,935
I'd love to.

826
00:48:11,432 --> 00:48:12,432
*Solemn music*

827
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,070
Benny: GNOMEO!

828
00:48:24,675 --> 00:48:27,248
What are you doing?

829
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:31,233
Benny, listen mate, I can explain.

830
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:33,515
BENNY!
Benny, wait.

831
00:48:38,966 --> 00:48:40,629
Well, well, well.

832
00:48:40,749 --> 00:48:43,413
If it isn't little-big-hat, Benny.

833
00:48:44,959 --> 00:48:47,287
Mess with the red garden, will ya.

834
00:48:49,563 --> 00:48:50,563
(Chuckles)

835
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:55,866
Gnomeo: BENNY!

836
00:48:56,866 --> 00:48:58,046
(Crash!)
NO!

837
00:49:02,948 --> 00:49:05,029
Ooo, that felt good.
(Blows)

838
00:49:06,228 --> 00:49:07,963
Oh no!
Oh, no.

839
00:49:09,424 --> 00:49:10,424
(Whimpers)

840
00:49:10,493 --> 00:49:11,493
Tybalt!

841
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:12,716
(Revs lawnmower)

842
00:49:16,205 --> 00:49:17,799
A hat for a hat.

843
00:49:20,493 --> 00:49:21,781
Gnomeo, no!

844
00:49:33,996 --> 00:49:36,662
You wouldn't attack an
unarmed Gnome, would ya?

845
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,209
Sucker.

846
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,125
Pity.

847
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:45,922
Tybalt, the wall.

848
00:49:45,923 --> 00:49:47,944
You don't I'm going to fall
for that old trick, do ya?

849
00:49:48,174 --> 00:49:49,582
Ha, ha, what wall?

850
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:56,895
Ut oh, that wall.

851
00:49:57,595 --> 00:49:58,940
(Shatter)
Blast!

852
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:02,589
What was that?

853
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,614
What's happened?

854
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:08,716
Tybalt?

855
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:10,430
Tybalt.

856
00:50:11,331 --> 00:50:12,331
Tybalt?

857
00:50:15,686 --> 00:50:18,540
Tybalt can't be with us anymore.

858
00:50:25,757 --> 00:50:27,644
(Gasps) Ooo.

859
00:50:28,498 --> 00:50:30,006
Smash him hat.

860
00:50:30,984 --> 00:50:34,105
-No!
-What is the meaning of all this constipation?

861
00:50:34,106 --> 00:50:35,792
Gnomeo smashed, Tybalt.

862
00:50:35,793 --> 00:50:37,097
No, he didn't do it.

863
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:38,813
-Juliet.
-Gnomeo.

864
00:50:38,814 --> 00:50:40,500
-Mom.
-A gnome for a gnome.

865
00:50:43,506 --> 00:50:44,934
-Catch.
-What?

866
00:50:45,774 --> 00:50:47,320
((Clang...clang))

867
00:50:51,355 --> 00:50:52,682
Smash him back.

868
00:50:53,107 --> 00:50:54,906
Run, Gnomeo.
Run!

869
00:50:56,744 --> 00:50:57,744
(Crowd angrily shouting)

870
00:50:58,051 --> 00:50:59,481
Stop, stop that.

871
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:10,690
Revenge!

872
00:51:11,817 --> 00:51:12,817
Whup!

873
00:51:24,161 --> 00:51:25,804
(Panting, gasping in shock)

874
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,620
Woman: Woo...

875
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:39,371
(Cars whizzing by)

876
00:51:45,783 --> 00:51:47,185
-What were you doing?
-No!

877
00:51:47,281 --> 00:51:48,830
-I love him.
-What?

878
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:50,373
Doomed.

879
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,370
Oh, someone do something.

880
00:51:54,226 --> 00:51:55,226
(Shattering)

881
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:58,713
(Gasp in shock)

882
00:52:00,137 --> 00:52:01,137
Gnomeo!

883
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,319
Are you mad?
There's been enough smashing for one day.

884
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,817
(Juliet crying)
Now get her on her pedestal.
And keep her there.

885
00:52:10,678 --> 00:52:12,069
(Sobs) He's gone.

886
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:23,131
(Crying) Oh Gnomeo.
(Sobs) No, no not Gnomeo.

887
00:52:23,132 --> 00:52:25,257
Let's get you home now.

888
00:52:25,258 --> 00:52:29,127
Lady Blueberry sobbing:
Oh, my poor, poor boy.

889

891
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:54,451
Hmm?

892
00:52:55,908 --> 00:52:57,401
Stay, stay!

893
00:52:57,402 --> 00:52:58,416
Gnomeo: Good boy.

894
00:52:58,669 --> 00:53:00,138
(Gasps...moans)

895
00:53:00,915 --> 00:53:03,711
Gnomeo: Shroom!
Shroooooom!

896
00:53:14,376 --> 00:53:15,376
Duhhhh!

897
00:53:27,901 --> 00:53:28,901
(Dog panting)

898
00:53:37,304 --> 00:53:38,304

Gnomeo: No!

902
00:54:12,592 --> 00:54:14,187
-First boy: A gnome?
-Second Boy: Yeah, Mate.

903
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:15,459
Second boy: It looks like your sister.

904
00:54:16,357 --> 00:54:17,357
(Boys laughing)

905
00:54:41,396 --> 00:54:43,630
Lord Redbrick: You left me no choice, Juliet.

906
00:54:44,273 --> 00:54:45,702
I've lost your mother.

907
00:54:45,914 --> 00:54:47,917
I am not going to lose you.

908
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,902
(Thunder rumbles in distance)

909

(Lady Blueberry softly crying)

912
00:55:54,636 --> 00:55:55,636
(Sadly) Mmmm.

913
00:55:58,192 --> 00:55:59,192
Hmm?

914
00:56:05,266 --> 00:56:07,469
Psst, psst, bunnies, fall in.

915
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:10,190
All right, we've got to
avenge, Gnomeo.

916
00:56:10,191 --> 00:56:11,555
Here's what we're going to do.

917
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,429
Now...(Mumbles softly)

918
00:56:14,891 --> 00:56:16,647
No, not now Shroom.

919

(Continues to softly confer)

920
00:56:18,428 --> 00:56:19,478
Right, got it.

Okay, okay you're a mushroom
Dude I coming.

922
00:56:37,904 --> 00:56:39,404
What, what you trying to say?

923
00:56:40,644 --> 00:56:43,648
Sooo, little Timmy has fallen down the well?

924
00:56:43,649 --> 00:56:44,964
No, did he jump?

925
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:46,153
Little Mustafa?

926
00:56:46,154 --> 00:56:47,457
Little Richard, what?

927
00:56:51,009 --> 00:56:53,694
Oh, a teapot fell down the well.

928
00:56:55,386 --> 00:56:56,764
Well what?

929
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,728
Featherstone: Oh, no.

930
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,544
You say Gnomeo fell down the well?

931
00:57:02,174 --> 00:57:04,083
No, little mushroom.

932
00:57:04,161 --> 00:57:05,770
He was a smashed.

933
00:57:05,775 --> 00:57:07,257
I saw it myself.

934
00:57:09,742 --> 00:57:12,695
What, you want I still to follow
you some more. Okay fine.

935
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:14,247
I go with you, I go.

936
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,402
Well what this has to do with,
Gnomeo, I don't know.

937
00:57:17,697 --> 00:57:20,698
And where is this well
everyone has fallen into?

938
00:57:29,335 --> 00:57:30,335
(Creaking)

939
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,753

941

01:00:16,304 --> 01:00:18,030
(Frantically taps ears)

967
01:00:20,223 --> 01:00:21,452
Benny: Hah, hah, yeah.

968
01:00:23,532 --> 01:00:24,532
Huh?

969
01:00:25,826 --> 01:00:26,826
(Worriedly whines)

970
01:00:28,943 --> 01:00:29,943
(Whines) Come on.

971
01:00:30,553 --> 01:00:31,553
Ohhh!

972
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:35,495
Miss Montague: Oh, ruddy purse.

973
01:00:39,118 --> 01:00:40,118
(Door slams)

974
01:00:43,637 --> 01:00:44,637
Call me.

975
01:00:47,859 --> 01:00:51,247
Gnomeo: So Juliet and me we decided that we
wouldn't carry on this horrible feud.

976
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:54,808
It was great, but then my
best mate Benny found out.

977
01:00:54,957 --> 01:00:57,403
And Tybalt, who's a right
piece of bad gnome, mate.

978
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,773
Crashed a trowel through Bennies hat.

979
01:00:59,774 --> 01:01:04,356
I was so livid that I attacked Tybalt
and he ended up getting smashed.

980
01:01:04,357 --> 01:01:05,996
Which wasn't my fault.

981
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:08,060
Then I was chased down.

982
01:01:08,061 --> 01:01:09,626
Exiled.

983
01:01:09,627 --> 01:01:11,347
Stuck up here on your head.

984
01:01:11,562 --> 01:01:13,044
Far away from, Juliet.

985
01:01:14,312 --> 01:01:16,013
Extraordinary.

986
01:01:16,014 --> 01:01:17,482
Your story,

987
01:01:17,589 --> 01:01:20,614
it does put me in mind of another.

988
01:01:20,615 --> 01:01:22,621
-It does?
-Oh indeed, yes.

989
01:01:22,622 --> 01:01:25,076
There are remarkable similarities.

990
01:01:25,077 --> 01:01:26,579
What happens?
Did they get back together then?

991
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:27,743
Get back together?

992
01:01:27,744 --> 01:01:29,332
Um, no.

993
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:30,752
Not exactly.

994
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,456
What exactly do you mean?

995
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,825
-Well now, it really is quite good.
-Whoa, whoa!

996
01:01:36,049 --> 01:01:37,840
-She feigns her death.
-Whoa!

997
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:40,582
He finds her.
Thinks her dead.

998
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:42,028
Takes his own life.

999
01:01:42,029 --> 01:01:43,762
She wakes, finds him dead.

1000
01:01:43,763 --> 01:01:45,588
Takes her life, both dead!

1001
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:48,754
Exium omnis, the end, curtain!

1002
01:01:48,754 --> 01:01:51,690
Standing ovation.
Bravo, bravo!

1003
01:01:51,691 --> 01:01:53,767
Author, author!

1004
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:55,912
Hmm?

1005
01:01:56,056 --> 01:01:57,185
Gnomeo: What did you say?

1006
01:01:57,186 --> 01:01:59,761
They both die?
What kind of an ending is that?

1007
01:01:59,961 --> 01:02:02,444
Shakespeare: My dear boy, this is a tragedy.

1008
01:02:02,445 --> 01:02:04,287
Yeah, you're telling me, mate.
It's rubbish.

1009
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:06,638
-Rubbish?
-There's got to be a better ending than that.

1010
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:11,193
Well I suppose that he could have made
it back in time to prevent disaster.

1011
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:14,314
But I like the whole death part better.

1012
01:02:15,186 --> 01:02:16,186
Oh dear.

1013
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:17,501
Aaaaahh!

1014
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,155

Whoo hooo!

1015
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:25,159
Featherstone.

1016
01:02:26,544 --> 01:02:27,544
One word.

1017
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,350
Plastic.

1018
01:02:30,351 --> 01:02:31,959
How'd you find me?
Shroom!

1019
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,875
He sniffed you out, and he doesn't have a nose.

1020
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:35,876
Whispers: Not yet.

1021
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,286
Yeah, I knew I could count on you,
you little button head.

1022
01:02:38,822 --> 01:02:40,230
What is it, boy?

1023
01:02:40,231 --> 01:02:42,828
Oh he hasn't stopped.
Yakity, yakity, yak.

1024
01:02:42,829 --> 01:02:44,981
Featherstone: He's been going on and on
and on since the alley.

1025
01:02:44,982 --> 01:02:48,983
Chocolates and strangers, chocolates and strangers,
chocolates and strangers....

1026
01:02:48,983 --> 01:02:50,237
Juliet's in danger.

1027
01:02:50,238 --> 01:02:51,441
No, that's not it.

1028
01:02:51,783 --> 01:02:54,273
Juliet's in danger!

1029
01:02:54,274 --> 01:02:56,372
-Told you so.
-Come on, boys.

1030
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:58,972
I've got to get back to Juliet,
and save her.

1031
01:02:58,973 --> 01:03:02,777
That's what he said, but she was
dead before he got home.

1032
01:03:02,778 --> 01:03:04,781
Gnomeo distantly shouts: We'll see about that.

1033
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:08,021
Whoa...

1034

-Benny.
-What do you think, Lady B.?

1038
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,482
This baby is fully equipped.

1039
01:03:37,483 --> 01:03:38,751
Equipped for what?

1040
01:03:38,752 --> 01:03:40,588
It has settings for edging,

1041
01:03:40,589 --> 01:03:42,170
trimming, mulching,

1042
01:03:42,171 --> 01:03:44,170
and revenge!

(Gnomes cheer agreement)

1044
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:47,997
Do it, Benny.

1045
01:03:47,998 --> 01:03:49,827
Do anything it takes.

1046
01:03:49,828 --> 01:03:53,672

1047

01:09:47,465 --> 01:09:49,956
I was just trying to keep her safe.

1132
01:09:50,576 --> 01:09:52,001
And, now...

1133
01:09:52,247 --> 01:09:54,715
The whole thing, is my fault.

1134
01:09:56,427 --> 01:09:57,923
Our fault.

1135
01:10:18,644 --> 01:10:21,527
-This feud.
-Is over.

1136
01:10:22,574 --> 01:10:23,574
((ZAP))

1137
01:10:26,029 --> 01:10:27,029
(Struggling moaning)

1138
01:10:27,102 --> 01:10:29,154
*Tiiiiki, tiiiki, tiikii, tiki rooom.*

1139
01:10:29,155 --> 01:10:31,987
*The tiiiiki, tiiki, tiki, tiiiki, room.*

1140
01:10:31,988 --> 01:10:37,238
*The birds and the flowers croon. Tiki, tiki, tiki room.*

1141
01:10:37,469 --> 01:10:38,469
(Music dies)

1142
01:10:46,908 --> 01:10:47,908
(Gasps)

1143
01:10:58,778 --> 01:10:59,778
(Both laugh with joy)

1144
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:01,723
(Gnomes cheer)

1145
01:11:14,517 --> 01:11:16,041
I don’t' know about you.

1146
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:18,727
But, I think this ending is much better.

1147
01:11:24,919 --> 01:11:27,584
(Rooster crows)
(Pig squeals)

1148
01:11:28,807 --> 01:11:31,967
-Mr. Capulet: Good afternoon, witch.
-Miss Montague: Nitwit.

1149
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:35,901
(Footsteps...back doors opening)

1150
01:11:36,345 --> 01:11:39,471
(Both gasp in shock.)
Both: AAAAAHHHH!

1151
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,250

*Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
