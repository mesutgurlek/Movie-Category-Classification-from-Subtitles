1129
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:57,770
He opened a karaoke bar.

1130
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:02,040
Said he needed a change.

1131
01:37:02,110 --> 01:37:04,440
So I took over here.
Didn't he tell you?

1132
01:37:05,950 --> 01:37:08,850
I haven't seen him.

1133
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:12,380
He has great business sense.

1134
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:14,890
First he sold me
fish and chips...

1135
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,720
then the whole thing.

1136
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:18,280
What?

1137
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,160
I said, he has
great business sense!

1138
01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:29,100
When did you
get into this music?

1139
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,200
It takes time
to get used to things.

1140
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:38,140
Did you go to California?
Was it fun?

1141
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:40,150
Huh?

1142

1143
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:50,820
Nothing special.

1145
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:05,230
You look good in uniform.

1146
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:09,780
You look nice like that too.

1147
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:12,180
Fancy a bite to eat?

1148
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:16,810
No, I fly out
very early tomorrow.

1149
01:38:19,490 --> 01:38:21,850
When will you get back?

1150
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,590
My grand opening
is two days away.

1151
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:30,130
Don't know.
This might be a long trip.

1152
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:37,430
Write to me when you reach
wherever it is.

1153
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:42,270
Would you read it if I did?

1154
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:44,570
Hey.

1155
01:38:44,650 --> 01:38:46,710
One thing I must ask you.

1156
01:38:57,630 --> 01:38:59,560
Would you let
a person on board...

1157
01:38:59,630 --> 01:39:01,620
with a boarding pass like this?

1158
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:10,370
It's dated today,
but it got blurred in the rain.

1159
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:14,840
I don't know
where it's taking me. Do you?

1160
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:21,880
No idea,
but I'll give you another.

1161
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:27,720
Great.

1162
01:39:39,070 --> 01:39:40,830
Where do you want to go?

1163
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:44,840
Wherever you want to take me.
