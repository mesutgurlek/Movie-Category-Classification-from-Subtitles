Victor, have I ever talked to you
about what I do for a living?

166
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,681
You're a travel agent?

167
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,530
I sell dreams.

168
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,048
I tell people, "You can sail to Italy."

169
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,123
"You can do the hula in Hawaii."

170
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,611
- Will you sign my form?
- I'm getting to that.

171
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,281
Okay.

172
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,442
In my job, sometimes you have people

173
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,046
who don't want quite
the same thing, right?

174
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,126
Say a husband wants to
play golf in Scotland

175
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,488
but the wife wants to
paddle down the Amazon.

176
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,122
All right, you've got two
conflicting ideas here.

177
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,490
And it's my job, Victor,
to help them meet halfway.

178
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,644
Say... Scottsdale, Arizona.

179
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,280
He gets to golf, she gets Indians.

180
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,886
But there's no river. And no jungle.

181
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,611
- Nobody gets what they want.
- Exactly.

182
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,881
And wrong.

183
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,971

because they compromise.
