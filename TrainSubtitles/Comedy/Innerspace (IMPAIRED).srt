Pendleton. Tuck Pendleton.

173

174
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,128

about Tuck Pendleton.

177
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,972
He could have been one of the best.
But he hates authority,

178
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,850

he likes to make up his own rules.

to fail long before

Now it's talking about God.

00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:45,340
Jack... you seem to be experiencing
some sort of theistic hysteria.

482
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,551
How do you treat that?

483
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,179
Well, the medieval remedy

484
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,474
was to flay the skin off your body
with brands of fire.

485
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,186
I have no idea
what the current thinking is.

486
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:09,364
It's just a little theistic hysteria,
which is nothing.

- Jack, we have to talk.
- (PANTING) No!

Jack, we have ourselves
a little problem here.

494
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:52,949
I wonder what's on the television?
TV is so much fun around now.

495
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,619
- Jack! Pay attention!
- Oh, good. This is a good one.

496
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,873
Jack, you can't watch TV.
We have to talk.

Oh, no, I'm inside a guy

Believe it, Jack.
Believe it because it's true.

Yes. And I can talk to him.

And also, he's able
to see everything that I see.

All right, look directly at them.
Don't turn your head.

PETE: Explain it to me then.

We're not the only ones
working towards miniaturization.

608

Don't you think I know that, Niles?

609
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,491
- Hey, I can hear them.
- TUCK: I know. Shut up and listen.

00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,826
Sorry.

611
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:55,204
But we are the first to perfect
the tricky re-enlargement process...

612
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,624
by using two chips.
One of the chips is in the pod.

613
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,126
And the other has been stolen.

614
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,878
Now, what do we do to we save Pendleton?

615
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,463
- Recover the stolen chip.
- Don't you have duplicates?

616
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,132
No! They're prototypes!

617
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,009
That's thinking ahead, Niles.

618
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,635
NILES: We can make duplicates,
of course.

By nine o' clock,
his air supply runs out.

621
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,978
PETE: That is no problem.

622
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,647
All he's gotta do is take the pod
to the guy's lungs,

623
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,274
open the hatch and breathe in
all the air he needs.

624
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,984
NILES: He can't open the hatch!

625
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,944
The sudden change in the cabin pressure

626
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,988
would cause the pod
to explode like a balloon.

- Nothing. I just hate this.

Why can't we tell her the truth?
She might even believe us.

No, besides it's
humiliating being this small.

01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,672
Hold it! Hold it right there.

1099
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,468
COMPUTER: emulation systems activated.

1100
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:47,012
Contour analysis, stage one.

1101
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:49,181
Move over, Picasso. Look at this.

1102
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:51,517
Grid-mapping ectodermal contours.

1103
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:53,060
Okay, go to the mirror.

1104
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:55,896
Mirror, oh... What are we gonna do?

1105
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:57,815
I'm going to attempt
an electronic stimulation

1106
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,151
- of your nerves and muscles.
- What's that mean?

1107
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:02,737
- I'm gonna alter your face.
- My face?

1108
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:04,447
Change my face? How do you do that?

1109
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:06,949
Uh... Eh... It's complicated.

1110
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:10,536
I don't even understand it myself.
But just... trust me.

1111
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:11,996
Will it hurt?

1112
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:14,123
Uh... yeah.

1113
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:15,791
Well, let's not do it then.

Are you okay?

1117
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,261
We're getting there, Jack!

1118
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:30,765
Hang on.
This might pinch just a little bit.

Jack?

Is that a five or a six?

1122
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:45,279
No, I'm right, it's a five.

- (LYDIA SCREAMS)
- What?

1125
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:57,792
- What did you do to him?
- Who?

1126
01:19:57,959 --> 01:19:59,919
- Jack!
- Jack?

1127
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:02,588
- I'm Jack.
- No! You get away from me!

1128
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:05,800
I'm Jack. Listen to my voice. It's me.

1129
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:07,593
Then who's in the bathroom?

1130
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,553
- He is.
- Who is?

1131
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:10,930
- Him.
- Who?

1132
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:12,598
The Cowboy.

1133
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,267
Sorry. I know it's hard to understand.

1134
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:17,520
It's hard for me to understand.
But you just have to believe me

1135
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:19,355
- and... and trust me.
- Jack?

1136

I can explain it later,
but now is not the time...

1137
01:20:23,026 --> 01:20:25,402
- How did you get Jack's hair?
- I'm not too sure about that one.

1138
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:26,737
Jack?

1139
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,657
Go see for yourself.

1140
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:33,118
Yeah, I'll go in and see for myself.
I'm not stupid.

1141
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:47,550
- Jack?
- Oh, my God.

1142
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:52,137
How?

1143
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,188
Don't ask, okay?

01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,190
Just... just trust me.

Tuck used to say he did the things
that I only write about.

Now I want to do the things
I only write about.

All right, what do you say?

Never beg. Never beg!

1157
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:06,670
- Hello, Cowboy.
- (MIMICKING COWBOY) Howdy.

Welcome. Come in. Sit down. Join us.

My friend, we have been waiting for you.

- Do you think we're close friends?
- TUCK: God, I hope not.

01:22:14,387 --> 01:22:16,388
How long has it been, Cowboy?

1162
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:19,099
- Uh, you tell me.
- Almost six years.

1163
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:21,435
- Ah.
- Don't you remember?

1164
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:24,396
- Idi Amin's barbecue.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

Oh, yes. How could I forgot? The sauce.

01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:31,236
You haven't forgotten the last time
we saw each other, have you?

1167
01:22:31,404 --> 01:22:34,573
Um... speaking of which,
we seem to have a rather...

1168
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:37,117
attractive added starter
here this morning.

1169

Yes, my sister.

You know, Cowboy, I don't know what
is, but there's something about you.

01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,635
Please.

You have changed, you're different.

Uh, yes... I've been sick.

- SCRIMSHAW: Have some champagne.

I believe that these are the kind
you like. Cuban?

Cuban?

Jack, you're in luck,
Cuban are the best.

1183
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:18,409
I save this for later.

Cowboy...

1186
01:23:26,292 --> 01:23:28,752
what happened to your hair?

1187
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:32,297
Uh... Um... I...

1188
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:34,299
I had it done.

1189
01:23:34,467 --> 01:23:35,926
Clint Eastwood style.

1190
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:38,887
You see Outlaw Josey Wales?
What a flick.

1191
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:42,683
So much for the pleasantries.
Now, let's get down to business.

1192
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,184
Dr. Canker.

1193
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:49,273
Yes, well... Miniaturization works
on a dual-chip system.

1194
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:51,191
Don't play with your food.

1195
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:52,860
We have one in our
possession at the moment

1196
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:56,697
and we'll have the other one...
very soon.

1197
01:23:56,865 --> 01:24:00,451
- Take what they got.
- Fine. I take what your got.

1198
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,287
You do understand,

1199
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:06,165
the first chip only miniaturizes.

1200
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:09,877
Both are required for re-enlargement.

1201
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:13,547
Right. We whet their appetites
with what we got.

1202
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,299
- Good point, Cowboy.
- Thank you.

1203
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:17,384
- Good point, Jack.
- Thank you.

1204
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:20,929
Doctor. The chip, please.

1205
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:26,935
Easy. Easy.

1206
01:24:27,103 --> 01:24:29,021
There it is.

1207
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:35,694
Hang on, now, Jack.
Now, I want you to reach out...

1208
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:37,654
and put it in your pocket.

1209
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:42,451
Gee, it's so tiny. Who would think?

1210
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:47,623
Jack, what are you doing?

1211
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:50,417
Take the chip.
Come on, don't freeze up on me.

1212
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:57,049
I wonder, miss,
if Cowboy's ever told you

1213
01:24:57,217 --> 01:24:59,051
of his incredible tolerance for pain?

1214
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:00,344
- His what?
- His what?

1215
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:03,889
- His what?
- His ability to withstand pain.

1216
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:07,434
Why, his stoicism is legendary.

1217
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:10,229
Hiding your light under a bushel,
Cowboy?

1218
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:11,855
That is so unlike you.

1219
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:15,067
- If that is who you are.
- Uh-oh.

1220
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:18,195
You mind satisfying my curiosity
on that point?

1221
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:22,908
In lieu of champagne,
how about some real pain?

1222

Jack? You all right, Jack?

1225
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,846
- Igoe?
- No!

1226
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:46,473
Don't worry, Cowboy,
Dr. Canker here has pioneered

1227
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:48,267
the field of limb replacement.

1228
01:25:48,434 --> 01:25:50,102
Jack, you're generating too much
electrical energy.

1229

- I can't hold the balance!
