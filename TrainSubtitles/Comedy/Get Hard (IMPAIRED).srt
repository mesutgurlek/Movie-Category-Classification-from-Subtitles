I just can't imagine what you
must be goin' through.

Ahh. It is so nice
to talk to you.

So, what's the latest
from the investigators?

The investigators?
Uh, Chinese hackers.

Didn't I tell you
to get off the phone?

I'll call you back.

Hang it up!
Hopefully, if I get
more phone time.

That was important to me!

to somebody.

Oh, no, no,

No, stop it, Peter!
Stop it!

This is your fault!
What?

Well, you couldn't get him to
take the plea deal, right?

860
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,399
Instead of him
goin' to prison,

you got him 30 days to be out
there, runnin' around...

Look, you're gonna get in
a fight on the inside. Okay?

Now, you don't need to win
these fights,

to show these guys

that you're not afraid
to fight back.

Being that you can't fight,

Get up, go over there,

1110
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:32,976
and politely ask that man,
can you suck his dick?

1111
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:34,377
[ Sighing ]
Oh, my gosh.

1112
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:36,045
I can't believe
I'm about to do this.

1114
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,049
Go survive.

1115
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,452
All right.
I'll just go do it.

1116
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:43,720
Yes, go do it.

1117
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:49,425
James: [ Exhales sharply ]
Okay. Come on.

1118
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,728
Are we doing this
or not, okay?

1119
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,596
Yes,
we're definitely doing it.

1120
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:57,066
Hey, I was nervous the first
time I did karaoke, right?

1121
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:59,068
Yeah.
Just get up there and sing.

1122
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,971
This is terrible foreplay.
Come on.

1123
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,973
I'm gonna put it
in my mouth.
Yeah.

I'm gonna suck your di...
Your di...

I'm gonna suck your di...

1126
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:09,979
Yeah,
that's what we're here for.

1127
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,614
I'll gonna put your di...
In my mouth.

1128

1133
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:27,597
I just thought you could use
some company.

1134
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,100
Oh. O-okay,
I see what this is.

1135
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:34,604
You... you think that you can...
That you can get with me?

1136
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:37,874
Ooh, interesting topic
of conversation.
Wait. No.

1137
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:40,610
That wasn't a sit-down
invitation.

1138

You're like...
You're like a 6.

1139
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,882
Thank you.
No, it's not a compliment.

That's not a...
That's not a good number.

1141

into this game...

You know, the gay game...
Uh-huh.

1144
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:56,626
By the way, the gay game
is a game you can win.

1145
00:44:56,628 --> 00:44:58,494
No, I-it's not,
'cause I don't wanna play.

I'm saying "if."
If I were to...

for ya, if you decide to join.

Look, you're gonna find
you someone, man.

1164
00:45:49,848 --> 00:45:51,514
You just gotta
set your sights

00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:53,549
on something more realistic,
you know?

Yes! Yes.

You have to train me.
It's my last chance.

1171

Are you ready to train harder
than you've ever trained before?

1172
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,530
Because once we go,
we do not hold back.

We do it,
and we do it hard!

to get hard?

I'm so glad to be back in
crenshaw where it's safe.

1889
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:33,374
My heart is just now
finally settling.

1890
01:13:33,376 --> 01:13:36,944
Yeah.
We're... we're alive.

1891
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:40,515
How 'bout we make a toast
to escaping fucking Nazis.

1892
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:41,983
Yes.

1893
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,925
You really are innocent,
aren't you?

1894
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,861
Yes. Absolutely.

1895
01:13:53,863 --> 01:13:55,563
Okay, so, James,
if that's the case,

1896
01:13:55,565 --> 01:13:57,265
then why aren't you tryin'
to find the guy that framed you?

1897
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:58,800
We are.

1898
01:13:58,802 --> 01:14:01,135
Who are?

1899
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:04,138
James: Now, Martin has a team
of investigators

1900
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,773
working around the clock.

1901
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,542
He's keeping me up to date.

1902
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:09,110
But the million-dollar
question is:

1903
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:11,245
Who falsified
my transaction records?

1904
01:14:11,247 --> 01:14:12,980
All right, lay it on me.
All right.

1905
01:14:12,982 --> 01:14:14,949
Now, this is very complicated
to follow.

1906
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:17,318
I don't expect you to get it
on the first pass,

1907
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,753
so listen very
carefully.

1908
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:20,054
The one thing you need
to understand

1909
01:14:20,056 --> 01:14:21,389
at the wealthrop fund

1910
01:14:21,391 --> 01:14:23,891
is that everything flows
through Martin.

1911
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:25,827
Okay?
Okay.

1912
01:14:25,829 --> 01:14:28,930
Any sort of contact with the
clearing house, the traders,

1913
01:14:28,932 --> 01:14:31,632
access to trading records
and client information,

1914
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:33,801
international accounts,
institutions,

1915
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,937
and, of course, the doling out
of commissions

1916
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:39,073
all goes through Martin.

1917
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:41,142
So it's Martin.

1918
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:43,277
No.
Are you fucking ki...

1919
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:45,179
It's common sense, James.
Look!

1920
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:48,015
All arrows
point to Martin!

1921
01:14:48,017 --> 01:14:50,985
The only name on the board
is fuckin' Martin!

1922
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,520
Martin!
Martin!

[ Sighs ]
Come on!

1924
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:55,790
James, you need to focus.

1925
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:57,124
You're goin' to prison

1926
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:58,659
unless you can prove
that Martin did it.

1927
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,695
Then we'd need to get a hold
of the master records,

1928
01:15:00,697 --> 01:15:02,463
which is a log of all
transactions made

1929
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:03,431
by anyone in the firm.

1930
01:15:03,433 --> 01:15:04,665
Okay, how do we get it?

1931
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,334
Martin has the original copy

1932
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:09,103
on the same computer that he had
when he started the company.

1933
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:11,839
You got to be the dumbest genius
I've... get up, James!

1934
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,941
All right.
Fuck the board!

1935
01:15:13,943 --> 01:15:16,711
Let's go, James!
We're going to Martin's office.

1936
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:26,187
Act natural, James.
You walkin' like you guilty.

1937
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:27,989
Hey, big guy,
you catch the game?

1938
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:29,223
Yeah.

1939
01:15:29,225 --> 01:15:30,558
Hey, big guy,
my name is Ken.

[ Shushing ]

Okay. Okay.
It's in this cabinet.

1943
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:42,970
We just have to figure out
a way to

1944
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:45,106
get the door open.
Watch out.

Ah. There it is.

1947
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,847
Same computer he had
when he started the company.

1948
01:15:52,849 --> 01:15:55,049
It's a good luck charm.
Good luck charm, my ass.

It has no connection
to the outside world.

No e-mails, no Internet,
no trace.

There it is!
The master records!

1952
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:06,060
That's what we need.
This will clear my name.

1953
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,962
Oh, well, then let's not waste
time. Get it.

1954
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:12,900
Yes!
I'm not going to prison.

1955
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:15,403
More importantly, I'm not gonna
be anyone's bitch.
