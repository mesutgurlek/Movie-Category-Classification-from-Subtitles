Well, I was expecting

I am Mrs. Arness' attorney,

posted regarding dogs,

that means there is
no policy toward dogs.

00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,340

I'm a little dangerous?

[Wind whistling,

651
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,946
? Girl, I'd love to show ya,
Show ya?

652
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,417
? My jungle love?

00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,249
- ? Whoo!?
- ? Oh-wee-oh-wee-oh?

00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,879
? Ye-e-e-e-ah?

655
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,423
Uh, money.

656
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,450
She'll take money.

657
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,519
Hi, hi. Here, just...
Here's whatever.

658
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,589
And there's more where that came
from if you just leave now.

No. Unh-unh, boyfriend.
We got business.

Boyfriend?

661
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,798
Oh, didn't I tell you?
We're dating now.

662
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,135
It's some kind of street talk.

663
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,937
It's street for
"I'm not going nowhere

664
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,636
until you help my problem
go away."

665
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:49,805
Look, Mrs. Arness,
a very important client,

666

is due here any minute.

Good afternoon.

Good afternoon.
Mr. Sanderson?

Oh, yes.
He's in the dining room.

670
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,260
Thank you.

671
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,354
Charlene, how 'bout you and I

672
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,423
havin' a smart cocktail
down by the pool?

673
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,762
Who is this fool?

674
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,235
That's a good idea.
Just put it on my bill.

675
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:16,000
I don't want no smart cocktail.
I need your help.

Ashley,
she doesn't work here.

680

If she isn't here to work,
then what is she here for?

681
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:28,277
Oh, hells no, Miss Thing.
You best pump your brakes.

682
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,684
She's my ex-wife's sister.

683
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,745
I would have killed her
myself years ago.

Yes. You have to go.

You like raw oysters,
Charlene?

688
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:48,271
Yeah. I guess
I can hang out for a bit.

689

They got any hot wings
around here?

690

All right.
Whatever you want. Yes.

- You give me a place to stay?
- Yes.

692
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,637
- And you work on my case?
- Around the clock.

693
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,113
I'll leave
when you expunge my record.

694
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,809
Consider it expunged.

695
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,943
All right.

Mrs. Arness.

00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,397
Who is your associate?

701
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,060
This is Howie Rottman,
the attorney I told you about.

702
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,661
A great pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Arness.

703

Her is... her...

She is our... our nanny.

Now I'm gonna go on down
to the pool with the child'n.

719
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,677
Maybe we make fun of the white
folks again, huh, kids?

Ooh-hoo!

by the pool.

I'd ever seen.

- What is it?
- I found the deposition.

The prosecution interviewed
an eyewitness,

821

that the perpetrator

didn't have a tattoo
on the chest.

They never told my lawyer
about this shit.

I compromise the way I act?

1123
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:30,953
? Yeah, yeah?

1124
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,120
? Whoo!?

1125
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,001
? Captured effortlessly?

1126
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,128
? That's the way it was?

1127
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,637
Come on, let's go dance.

1128
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,832
Ha ha ha ha... no.

1129
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:46,967
Come on. When is
the last time you danced?

1130
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,511
At my wedding.

1131
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:51,672
Don't worry, I can dance.
It's just that I don't wanna.

1132
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:54,114
Come on, smooth. Show me
what you're workin' with.

1133
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,015
I can dance.
I just don't want to dance.

1134
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,383
Man, you can't dance.

1135
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,684
- Well, I got moves.
- Let me see.

1136
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,417
All right, all right.

1137
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:04,221
Okay, one last
little drink here.

1138
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,353
- ? Ain't nobody?
- ? Ohh?

1139
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,921
- ? Loves me better?
- ? Loves me better?

1140
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,933
? Makes me happy?

1141
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,263
What, you got to pee?

1142
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:14,098
This was big in high school.

1143
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,696
Man, look, you can't dance
from your brain.

1144
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,365
You gotta feel it.
Now, come on.

1145
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,171
Show me how
you made them kids.

1146
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,608
? Makes me feel this way?

1147
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:23,612
? O-O-Ooh?

1148
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,113
- What the hell...
- How's this?

1149
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,207
That's great for an epileptic.
Come on, now.

1150
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,013
You gotta move your pelvis
with it.

1151
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,680
More hips.
There you go.

1152
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,416
Get smooth with it.

1153
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:37,051
? I can't resist
This sweet surrender?

1154
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:40,221
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't help it. I miss him.

1155
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,458
Oh, snap out of it, already.

1156
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,558
I'm snapped. I'm snappy.

1157
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,630
? And what we see
Is no surprise?

1158
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,674
[Exhales sharply]

1159
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:53,572
Oh, God, Ash.

1160
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:56,009
I still can't believe
you were hit by a car.

1161
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,980
Did you call a lawyer?

1162
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,483
Oh, I can't talk to a lawyer.
I was jaywalking.

1163
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:02,984
So, can we just stop...

1164
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:04,350
[Gasps]

1165
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:06,184
- What?
- Oh, my God.

1166
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:07,883
? Makes me feel this way?

1167
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,516
[Gasps]

1168
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:11,254
What?

1169
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,353
? Loves me better?

1170
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,692
? Makes me happy?

1171
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:16,391
- ? Makes me happy?
- [Gasps]

1172
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,865
Look at that!

1173
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:22,329
Oh, my God, it's true.
Look at that! Look at that!

1174
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:23,872
? Makes me happy?

1175
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,874
He never danced like that
with me.

1176
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,342
I'm gonna go talk to him.

1177
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,910
No! Sit!

1178
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,039
Why?

1179
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,378
I can't tell you.

1180
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:35,850
If I talk about it,

1181
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:39,082
gangster people will come
to my house and cut me.

1182
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,625
Oh.

1183
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:45,058
[Exhales deeply]

1184
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:48,461
Oh, he almost looks
like a fun person.

1185
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:51,160
[Sobs]

1186
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,895
[Sobbing]
Must've been me.

1187
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,630
Was it me?

1188
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,934
No. Stop beating yourself up.
It's him.

1189
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,975
Can we just
get out of here? Now?

1190
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,033
[Sobs]
You know what they say...

1191
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,944
once you go black,
you never go back.

1192
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,209
[Sobbing]

1193
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,046
Can we get the check, please?

1194
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:09,312
[Sobs]

1195
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,445
? I feel like no one
Could feel?

1196
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,751
? I must be dreamin'?

1197
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:16,291
? I want this dream
To be real?

1198
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,986
? I need this feelin'?

1199
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,791
? I make my wish upon a star?

1200
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,857
? And hope this night
Will last forever?

1201
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:27,836
? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh?

1202
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,098
? Ain't nobody?

1203
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:30,230
? Nobody?

1204
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,298
- ? Loves me better?
- ? No one love me?

1205
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,637
? Makes me happy?

1206
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,642
? Yeah?

1207
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,236
? Makes me feel this way?

1208
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,441
- ? Ain't nobody?
- ? Hey, hey?

1209
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,547
And that's why
I worked so hard,

1210
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,452
so I could give Kate a good
life, then it backfired!

1211
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,649
Man, bitches don't care
nothin' about that shit.

1212
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,284
Oh, bitches do too care.

1213
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,987
I'm gonna
tell you a secret...

1214
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,929
sometimes I drive by our old
house, and I just look at it,

1215
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,432
and I just remember our life,
and it just hurts!

1216
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,525
Man, that is so pathetic,
P. Diddy.

1217
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:02,037
But you know what?
I'm gonna help you get her back.

1218
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:03,163
How?

1219
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,265
Well, first,
we gotta create a mood.

1220
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,640
["I'm Gonna Love You Just
a Little More, Babe" plays]

1221
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:10,271
Just like at
the restaurant, baby.

1222
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:11,609
I'm already there.

1223
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,672
Yeah.
Now, feel the Barry.

- Okay, that's Barry.
- Yeah.

1226
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:19,545
This is Kate.

1227
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:21,215
Hey, Kate. Yeah.

1228
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,225
I want you to talk nasty
to her!

1229
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,124
Talk nasty!

1230

[Slurred]
I'd like to kiss you a lot.

Cut that sensitive shit,
Nancy Boy!

00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:32,700
What?

1233

- You gotta be a beast!

Yeah!

1235
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,199
In the bedroom,
a woman wants a man

1236
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,208
that knows how to ride her
when she bucks.

Ride 'em when she bucks!
Ride 'em!

Yeah, Mama! You gonna be
my tawdry little woman?

You ain't just
no king of the jungle,

you own that jungle!

That's your pride!

1275

You own that jungle,

1437
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,102
and eating them.

1438
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:43,270
Wow.

1439
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:46,440
But other than that...
nothing went wrong with your...

1440
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:47,846
Oh, no, no.
He's great.

1441
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:49,407
Yeah, I liked him.

1442
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:54,245
So, how's your...

1443
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:56,086
My what?

1444
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:57,716
Your life?

1445
01:04:57,793 --> 01:05:00,523
Anything hip and new?

1446
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:02,154
No.

1447
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,191
Um...

1448
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,759
I'm having a good time
with the kids.

1449
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:09,429
Good. Glad you're having
fun with her.

1450
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:11,604
Them.

1451
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:18,345
[Scoffs] What?

1452
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:20,905
You look, um...

1453
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:21,972
Yeah.

1454
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:23,143
Rested.

[Scoffs]

1456
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,713
Nice. You look nice.

1457
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:30,156
So, um, I guess I'll come by
later and pick up the kids.

1458
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:33,457
Oh, I was wondering if I could
keep them through Friday.

1459
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,862
Really?
You're not too busy?

1460
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,332
No.

1461
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:43,104
Well, yes, it's okay.

1462
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:45,538
It's wonderful, Peter.

You know, if you wanted
to come ov...

01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:57,316
Sorry.

- [Beeps]
- Hello?

CHARLENE:
Yo, get your butt home, dog.

1470
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,321
I will be home in my own
sweet time, girlfriend.

1471
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:09,228
You gotta come now. Arness said
she on her way over here.

1472
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,823
Oh, I forgot all about that.

1473
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:14,665
Oh, I'm sorry.
L-l-I have to go.

1474
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:16,136
I just forgot
about something,

1475
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:18,571
but I want to continue
this conversation,

1476
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,735
so I will call you, or you can
call me on my cell.

1477
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:22,869
Bye!

Hey, get upstairs
and get ready!

01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:05,386

there's somethin' I really

[Chopping]

Kids! She's here!

1496
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,280
Mrs. Arness?

01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:37,182
Oh!

1498
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:41,155
I'll get right to the point,
Mr. Sanderson.

1499
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,418
There are rumors circulating

1500
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:48,759
that your personal life
and your home are in disarray,

1501
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:51,527
and this makes me feel
very unsettled.

1502
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,795
I don't know who misinformed
you, but please, come in.

1503
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:55,928
I'd hate to think you're
under any misapprehension

01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:57,597
about me or my family.

You remember Mrs. Arness?

01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:07,113
So lovely to see you again.

1509
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:09,014
Um, Father,
when you have a moment,

1510
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,885
would you mind helping me with
my report on Queen Victoria?

1511
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:14,616
Sure, kitten.

1512
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,524
And don't forget, Pop, tomorrow
you have to come to school

1513
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,789
and help hand out the food
to the poor kids.

1514
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,730
Have I ever forgotten
to help the poor kids?

1515
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:25,596
No, Pop. Never.

1516
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:32,738
In truth, Mr. Sanderson,
you have a lovely home.

1517
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:33,866
Thank you.

1518
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,138
And your children
are very well-behaved.

1519
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,077
- They're angels.
- [Chuckles]

- Oh, William.

Oh, look!

to your boy.

[Laughs]
That's so sweet.

1524
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:46,718
Anyway, we can go to the den
and get the contracts...

1525
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,780
What is that heavenly smell?

1526
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:51,656
[Sniffs] Ah, that would be
Charlene preparing dinner.

1527
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,558
Anyway, the contracts...

1528
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:56,962
I haven't smelled home cooking
like that since I was a child.

1529
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:58,590
Really? Anyway...

1530
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,692
Brings back
such happy memories.

1531
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:04,227
Does it? Anyway, actually,
the den is closer...

1532
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,900
Your table looks so inviting.

1533
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,571
Yes. It's too bad
it's so small.

1534
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,045
Small?

1535
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,605
Well, actually,
it's big, isn't it?

1536
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,378
It's a big table, so...

1537
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,682
there would be room
for one more.

1538
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:21,518
Oh, well, if it's not
an imposition...

1539
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:22,887
Oh... oh.

1540
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:25,518
Well, let me just go check
if there's enough food.

1541
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:27,027
I'm not... I'm not sure,

1542
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:29,087
because, uh, actually,
this is the night of, uh,

1543
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:32,862
Yiminum, the, uh...
the holiday where

1544
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:34,766
white people eat
very little portions

1545
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,930
because that was the night
the Lord came down,

1546
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,166
and he was given food,

1547
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,470
and there was just too much,
and he said, "No."

1548
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:42,511
And so, he had
a smaller portion,

1549
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:44,739
and that's why we might not
have enough.

1550
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:47,782
So, I'll just go check on, uh,
what the Lord would say.

1551
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,216
Just one second.

1552
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:51,548
SARAH: Come here, William.

1553
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,884
Hey, come here.
Are you hungry?

1554
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:57,785
Charlene...

1555
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,192
If there was ever a time
I needed a favor, it's now.

1556
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:01,593
You got it, baby.
Anything.

1557
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:03,097

01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:17,142
Yes? Oh, yes.

[Sighs]

1563
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:21,177
My family and I are pleased
to invite you for dinner.

1564
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,308
Yeah, oh.

1565
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,443
Well, very well.
I wasn't expecting this.

1566
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,010
Uh, but if you insist.

1567
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:28,648
And then afterwards,
we can sign the contracts.

1568
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:29,520
Of course.

1569
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:31,457
Dinner is served.

1570
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:35,795
I was raised
in the South, you know.

1571
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:39,265
That smells just like
our Ivy's jambalaya.

1572
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:42,600
She was so wonderful.

1573
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:45,367
We paid her nothing,
of course, you know.

1574
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:48,501
But, then, people had standards
of service in those days.

1575
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:51,444
And, of course, Ivy did know

1576
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:56,541
that you serve from the left
and collect from the right.

1577
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:00,780
Don't...

1578
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:03,882
stop at that story, because
I love hearing about your past.

1579
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:05,290
That is fascinating.

01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,120
Oh, yes.

1582
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:11,166
Well, anyway,
as I was saying...

1583
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:14,031
[Speaking indistinctly]

1584
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,128
[Laughing] Yeah.

Ooh, I'm gonna get you.

1589
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:25,746
I'm gonna get you.

1590
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:28,146
Uh-huh.
I'll serve your food right.

1591
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,151
Was it the left?
Was it the right?

1592
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:33,814
Father's work with the
Pasadena Republican Youth Group

1593
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:36,016
has truly been invaluable.

1594
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,356
I hope y'all brought
y'all appetites.

1595

Is it some kind of herb
like sage?

No, it's sort of more
like a milk of mint.
