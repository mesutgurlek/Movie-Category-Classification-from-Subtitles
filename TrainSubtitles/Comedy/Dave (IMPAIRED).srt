319
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,679
...is in the car.

320
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:14,183
The entire United States of America.

321
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,395
- In the car?
- In the car.

322
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,688
I see what you mean.

323
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,149
Dave.

324
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,069
The country is sick.

325
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,156
And you're gonna get it to the hospital.

326
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,744
These are the private quarters.

327
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,998
The president's bedroom is on that
side, the first lady's is over there.

328
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,459
- First lady?
- Don't worry, you won't even see her.

329
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,044
They barely talk anymore.

330
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,380
DAVE: You're kidding.
BOB: It happens.

331
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,304
And this is where you'll be sleeping.

332
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,478
- Hmm.
- You all right?

333
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,356
- It's very nice.
- Come this way.

334
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,025
I'm sure you'll be comfortable here.

335
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,362
We'll be back to get you first thing
in the morning.

336
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,282
The Secret Service man
is right outside the door.

337
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,784
Good night, Mr. President.

338
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,619
Good night.

339
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,038
ALAN:
Sleep tight.

340
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,379
DAVE:
Thank you.

341
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,147
Whoa.

342
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,114
MAN [OVER PHONE]: - Yes, Mr. President.
- Uh, nothing. Good night.

343
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,171
Nothing.

344
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,797
Good night.

345
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:37,368
ALAN: At 10:45 last night, President Mitchell,
coming home from the Monroe Hotel...

346
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,496
...where he was giving a speech
to the American Legal Counsel...

347
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:44,708
...suffered what doctors describe
as a minor circulatory problem of the head.

348
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,546
Reports that he had suffered
a severe stroke are erroneous.

349
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,091
Doctors report that he should be up
and back to his normal schedule soon.

350
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,719
Now, let me stress again,
this is a minor medical problem.

351
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,681
The president has complete use
of his faculties...

352
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,350
...and retains full executive authority.

353
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,601
Any questions?

354
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,271
The White House classifies
the president's condition...

355
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,107
...as a slight circulatory problem
of the head.

356
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,608
While technically a stroke...

357
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:13,320
...White House spokesmen say the
president's condition is far from serious...

358
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,698
...and he should be up and about
sometime soon.

359
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:19,285
Do you know how many different
kinds of laws we've broken?

360
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,455
It's simple, Alan.

361
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,500
We send the vice-president
to Africa or something.

362
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,670
We dig up some dirt on him
and then we force him to resign...

363
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,339
...and get our president
to nominate a new one.

364
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,383
The whole thing
takes a couple of weeks.

365
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:38,262
You mean, we get Dave
to nominate you as vice-president?

366
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,308
- I was a senator, you know?
- Oh, I know.

367
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,227
And when our poor president
has another stroke...

368
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,563
...of course this time
much more serious...

369
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,441
...our newly appointed VP becomes....

370
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,359
Jeez.

371
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,069
What about containment, Al?

372
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,280
Thanks.

373
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:03,329
Okay. We got the nurses for 50 grand
apiece, and the doctors for 100.

374
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:06,874
- The older guy wanted head of the CDC.
- Is that everybody?

375
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,543
Duane's guys,
he's got them all under control.

376
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,462
Good. What about her?

377
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,796
Her?

378
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,507
Oh, the first lady?

379
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:20,471
She was giving a speech at Bryn Mawr.
I managed to catch her before she left.

380
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,847
And?

381
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:26,602
I told her his blood pressure went up
after a little incident at the hotel.

382
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,937
She seems to hate him now
more than ever.

383
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,397
Fine.

384
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:34,693
Everybody else is buying
the "minor stroke" story.

385
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,907
Let's hope this yutz can pull it off.

386
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,910
DOCTOR: These are amazing results.
I must say, Mr. President...

387
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,912
...even for a man with a minor stroke...

388
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,915
...you seem to have made
a remarkable recovery.

389
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,583
Oh, that's great.

390
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,543
I'm feeling much better.

391
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,797
No signs of paralysis.
No circulatory changes.

392
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,091
Your ECG is completely normal...

393
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:01,053
...and, uh, your blood pressure
has even gone down.

394
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,098
Have you been exercising recently?

395
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,060
Yes. I mean...

396
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,938
...bicycling and, uh...

397
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,314
...weight lifting.

398

401

I see no reason why you can't, uh...

one hand in the pocket of his coat.
