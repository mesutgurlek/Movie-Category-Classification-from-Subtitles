How do you like that, Ditka?

162
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:09,995
Take it back.

163
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,495
Here, you get
the whole thing!

164
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:12,861
[humming]

165
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,460
We'll settle this later,
okay?

166
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,831
Yeah, you know
where to find me!

167
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:16,891
Yeah, exactly.

168
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,903
I got this for you, too!
Get out of here!

169
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,461
[gasping]
Phil, come on.

170
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,632
What are you lookin' at?

171
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,732
Dad, he hit me.
He hit me with the ball.

172
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,844
Hey, Dad, what happened
to all your fish?

173
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,441
That one ate the others.
I call him "Killer."

174
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:32,882
Killer?

175
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,884
Yeah.

176
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,851
I like it.

177
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:35,853
Yeah.

178
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,049
You might wanna
clean the water
every now and then.

179
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,853
Let's see what you can do.

180
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,290
Hey, Dad,
I didn't know if...

181
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,987
I wanted to
talk to you about Sam.

182
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,290
Sammy's a good boy.

183
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,352
Yeah. Yeah.

184
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,398
Yeah.

185
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,264
He hasn't been
playing much lately
and, I didn't know if--

186
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,326
Stop right there.
I agree with you.

187
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,871
And I got some
great news.

188
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,998
He's gonna get
a lot more
playing time now.

189
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,372
Dad, thanks,
that's--that's exactly
what I wanted to hear.

190
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,933
I traded him
to the Tigers.

191
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,034
[glass shattering]

192
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,101
(Buck)
Ooh, hey!

193
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,645
[sparking]

194
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,182
You traded
your own grandson?

195
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,343
Well, I didn't actually
get anything for him.

196
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,148
You know that cost $400?

197
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,381
I can't believe it.

198
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,980
W-What, you
calling me a liar?
I'll show you the receipt.

199
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,821
No, l-I'm talking
about Sam!

200
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,485
W-Why didn't you
just play him more?

201
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,960
He is going to
play more, Philly--

202
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,496
Yeah, for another team!

203
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,260
You--You--You care
about winning that much?

204
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,326
Look, Phil,
I'm not just
coaching soccer.

205
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:25,700
I'm building men.

206
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:26,829
Okay, yeah.

207
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:27,838
Hey, hey, hey.

208
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,898
It's an impressive shot.
Sure.

209
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,637
But, you know,
I want Sam to have fun.

210
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,973
This isn't the big leagues.

211
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,275
For those who live
between Broadway
and Grandville,

212
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,781
between the ages
of 10 and 12,

213
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,511
who are free
on Sundays and Tuesdays,

214
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,446
this is the big leagues.

215
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,284
But what about Sam?

216
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,252
Sam, you saw him
out there today.
It breaks my heart.

217
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,589
At best,
he's a benchwarmer.

218
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,586
Wow! Oh!

219
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,662
Oh, Killer! Killer!

220
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,065
How did that happen?

221
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,869
[sighs]

222
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,777
Hey, Sam,
you wanna give us a minute?

223
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,080
Need a little adult time.

224
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,381
Uh-huh.

225
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,944
[door closes]

226
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,584
[sighs]

227
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,022
Of all the asinine things
my dad has done,

228
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,357
this is by far
the most asinine.

229
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,762
I mean, I know he's
the most competitive man
in the world.

230
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,801
But this beats them all.
I'm angry.

231
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,571
I'm--I'm spitting angry!

232
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,104
I'm like a tornado of anger,
swirling about!

233
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,411
My heart rate is
dangerously high right now.

234
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,173
I'm glad it happened,
l--

235
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,113
What?
Yeah.

236
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,445
What do you mean?

237
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,248
Where did my wife go?
Are you a robot?

238
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,649
Are you a robot-woman?

239
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,690
I--I am not a robot.

240
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,089
Phil, honey,
I know this is
upsetting, okay,

241
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,890
but you have to try to
find the positive in this.

242
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:00,023
It was unhealthy
for Sam to play
on your dad's team.

243
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,033
Now he'll play
for the Tigers

244
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,092
[sighs]
and have some fun.

245
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,066
Okay, look,
you're too upset about this.

246
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,231
So, I'll tell him, okay?

247
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,400
No, no, no,
no, no, no, l...

248
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,006
I need to tell him.

249
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,468
[sighs]

250
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:15,938
[grunts]

251
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,380
Benchwarmer?

252
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,639
[grunts]

253
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,015
[hissing]

254
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,787
Boy, did that hurt my face.

255
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,011
[knocking on door]

256
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,318
Sammy?
Yeah?

257
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,583
Hey.
Hey.

258
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,389
What are you doing?
Nothing.

259
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,157
Internet dating?
No.

260
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,788
Mail-order bride?
No.

261
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,332
Just kidding.

262
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,834
(Phil)
Look, uh, I got
some good news.

263
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,234
I got you put on a new team.

264
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,673
I'm not on the Gladiators
anymore?

265
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:43,868
No.

266
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,137
You're on the Tigers.

267
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,301
[snarling]

268
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,108
The Tigers?
Yeah.

269
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,080
They're in last place.

270
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,285
Yeah, but you're gonna get
more playing time.

271
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,282
Did Grandpa trade me?

272
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,180
No.

273
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,390
Yes, wait.
I'm happy this is happening.

274
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,519
This is a good thing.

275
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,496
You know, it doesn't seem
like a good thing,

276
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,088
but it's a good thing.
Trust me.

277
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,430
You do not wanna be
the kid

278
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,993
that's on the other end
of the bench.

279
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,936
You do not
want to be that kid.

280
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,530
'Cause I know that kid.

281
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,233
You don't wanna be him.

282
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,435
Okay.

283
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,709
You don't wanna be the kid
who has such suppressed rage

284
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,216
that his heart's about
to burst through his chest.

285
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,650
[panting]

286
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,280
You don't wanna
be the kid that
when he thinks about

287
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,721
what his dad did to him...

288
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,815
[gasps]

289
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,860
I know that kid. I know.

290
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,724
That kid lives right here
in this house!

291
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:37,820
Mom!

292
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,660
[wheezing]

293
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,198
Oh.

294
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,432
Mom!

295
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,594
He doesn't know what to do.
He doesn't--

296
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,659
Ouch!

297
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,129
Phew.

298
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,969
Okay?
Yes. Good.

299
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,268
Coach Benson will be
good for you.
He knows his stuff.

300
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,369
I bet you this whole thing
is gonna turn out to be

301
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,438
a blessing in disguise.

302
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,778
Hey, the Tigers
may be in last place,

303
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,012
but those guys
look pretty good.

304
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,987
Dad, those
aren't the Tigers.

305
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,454
They're not even
wearing blue.

306
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,888
The Tigers are
over there.

307
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,291
I'm having a baby.
Oh, I'm having a baby.

308
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,589
No hitting the baby.

309
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,097
No, no, don't hit
my precious baby.

310
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,097
[splashing]

311
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,726
Oh, look,
it's gonna come out!
It's gonna come out! Oh!

312
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:17,769
Cut it out!

313
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,895
Oh, it's gonna come out!

314
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:19,960
Oh.

315
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,532
Hi, excuse me. Uh,
Coach Benson around?

316
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,168
Yeah, you all know
Phil Weston?

317
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,371
(John)
Oh, yeah.

318
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,243
Hey, welcome to the team,
little fellow.

319
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,545
Why don't you go
join those other kids
over there?

320
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,141
Yeah, go ahead.

321
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,618
There's a moving truck
in front of Benson's house.

322
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,987
Did you hear?
The pressure of
coaching got to him.

323
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,047
He cracked.

324
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,618
How could he crack?
We're only one game
into the season.

325
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,459
All right,
Tigers, it's game time.

326
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,226
Oh, but we're waiting
for our coach.

327
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,926
Well, then one of you
will have to coach.

328
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,196
Yeah, but I had
talked to Coach Benson,
we're brand new--

329
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,464
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
All right.

330
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,802
Find yourself a coach,
or the Tigers forfeit.

331
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,799
Yes?

332
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,173
Where do I know you from?

333
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,007
I've been your neighbor
for seven years.

334
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,171
No, that ain't it.

335
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,976
No, that's definitely it.

336
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,811
I'll figure it out.

337
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,774
So, who's gonna coach?

338
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,980
We got Mark into soccer,
'cause we wanted
to take a break.

339
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,989
I didn't think I'd be
coaching the little bugger.

340
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,491
I just got laid off.
I'm looking for a job

341
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,585
so it's hard enough
to drag myself out of bed.

342
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,259
So, uh, we forfeit.

343
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,325
So, we're forfeiting?

344
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,800
No, no, no, no. Uh,

345
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,940
you know what,
l--I can coach.

346
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,373
Well, that's swell!
Great!

347
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,739
Just for one game.

348
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,041
Right. It's game time.
Get your team on the field.

349
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,375
Who are we playing?

00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,928
Oh, Benson's a no-show.
I'm gonna coach
the Tigers today.

Okay, Tigers, uh,
why don't we have

We don't have starters,
we never got that far.

00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,687
Okay.
You'll probably
wanna give it a glance.

Yeah.

Thank you.

00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,784
Good.
Thank you.

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,452
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
who's your son?

00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,086
Byong Sun.
Oh, I see.

487
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,496
Actually, l...
You know what, I don't see.

I'm sorry, l...

Oh, wait, now I see. Wow!

[whispering]
Okay.

491
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,032
We're at every game.

492
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,666
Not like a lot
of the other parents.

493

No, no, no, not like
the other parents at all.

[chuckles]

495

Better! You're better
than the other parents.

Oh, so they're better?

No, no, I mean--
I mean, they're--
Well, they're different.

00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,382
What do you mean
"different"?

500
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,686
No, l... You're different
because you're better.

501
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:47,747
How are they better?

502
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:48,884
No, look...

503
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,452
You're both better different

504
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,599
in a different
but better way.

505
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,691
Okay. You know what,
let's get the rest.

506
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,236
A little early to start
playing favorites, Phil.

Love it, yeah!

00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,643
Grab a ball!

516
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:17,144
Here we go. Fan out.
Form a circle here.

517
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,414
Great. Okay, now,

518
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,959
I don't know,
it may just be me,

519
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,190
but, uh, I really got
a feeling like
we could catch fire

520
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,164
and have a great season. Huh?

521
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,631
Now, who's with me?

522

[whoops]

It's electric in the air!
Yeah!

00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,502
Thank you for that show
of enthusiasm.

525
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,938
Uh, well, l--I thought
we would just start,
uh, today by going around,

introducing yourselves,
and telling me

your--your strengths
on the soccer field.

Hey, Hunter. I'm Phil.

Hi, Phil. Uh, l-I'll
eat this worm for $5.

533
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,329
How would that help us?

534
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,726
I'd have an extra $5?

535

No, you're not going to
eat that, are you?

Yeah, I ate it.

540
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,409
Now you owe me $5.

I didn't agree to pay you $5.

That's very sweet.

some time, Phil.

No. I already know.
It was awful.

00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,026
Okay, come on, Phil.

641
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,896
I'll throw this out
the window, honey.

642
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,901
Uh, l-I'm sorry, Mrs. D....
I'm sorry.

643
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,493
You should be.

644
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,195
It's a nasty, filthy habit.

645
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,263
Hey.

646
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,901
You can count me in.

647
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:05,874
Really?

648
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,707
Let's bring
your old man down.
Oh, great.

649
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,305
[people chattering]

650
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,575
(boy)
Give me a drink.

651
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,311
It's just a great group.
Okay, uh, Tigers.

652
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,348
[blowing whistle]

653
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,147
Look who's here.

654
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,014
I'll give you a hint.

655
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,687
Hall of Fame?

656
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,491
Chicago Bears?

657
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,428
Sammy Sosa?

658
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,521
No, no, no.
Come on.

659
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:27,895
No, football.

660
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,524
Coached the 1986--

661
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,533
'85.

662
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,571
Uh, '85 Bears
to a Super Bowl victory?

663
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,798
It's Mike Ditka.

664
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,101
[people applauding]
Yeah.

665
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,605
Do you know Sammy Sosa?

666
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,200
Hey, zip it, kid!

667
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,040
I'm a coach that knows
about winning.

668
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:45,139
I'm gonna push you guys
like you've never
been pushed before.

669
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,809
Some of you are
gonna wish I was dead.

670
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:47,909
It's true.

671
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,920
I know it's a weird thought,
but it's true.

672
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,650
I eat quitters for breakfast
and I spit out their bones.

673
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:53,713
Delicious.

674
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,919
Now this is gonna be
the hardest
most difficult thing

675
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,894
you ever attempted
in your entire life.

676
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,158
You know what
when it's over--
It will get emotional.

677
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,790
When it's over...
When it's over...

678
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,858
...you guys are
gonna be champions.
Champions.

679
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,732
By God, you're
gonna be champions.

680
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,169
All right, everybody up.
Come on.

681
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,331
Come on, hands in.

682
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,465
Come on, everybody.
Let's go out
and kick some butt.

683
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,409
Here we go. On three.
Let's have fun.

684
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:16,914
(all)
One, two, three.
Let's have fun.

685
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,881
"Let's have fun?"
What's that?

686
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,042
I just made it up.

687
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,287
On the ground,
give me the pushups,
come on.

688
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,982
If you guys
were with the Bears,

689
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,024
I'd fine you each
$10,000 apiece.

690
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,855
This calls for some
drastic measures.

691
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,020
We're gonna make
some changes around here.

692
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,327
Come on, move it.
Move it! Faster! Faster!

693
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,994
(Byong Sun)
Faster. Faster.

694
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:40,037
Move it! Move it!
Put some pressure
on those legs!

695
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,164
(Byong Sun)
Faster. Faster.

696
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,634
No candy!
Your mother said
you can't have any candy!

697
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,733
Please. Give me it back.

698
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,869
No candy.
Please. No. Please?

699
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,441
Hey! I got eyes
in the back of my head.

700
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,677
[all groaning]
Come on, girls.
You gotta move it.

701
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,813
You gotta move it.
All the way!

702
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,379
Come on, move it. Move it.

703
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,426
But, coach, how is this
gonna help me with soccer?

704
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,523
It's not gonna
help you with soccer,

705
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,895
but I'm gonna get
my trash taken out, okay?

706
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,861
Come on, Beyonce,
let's get that
back end done.

707
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,667
Uh, Coach? Shouldn't we
be going to soccer practice?

708
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,468
I'm not going to
soccer practice
with a dirty car.

709
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:17,797
[whistle blowing]

710
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,037
Here we go, gang.
Let's go, Tigers. Come on.

711
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,408
Let's go get them.

712
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,470
(Ditka)
Come on,
kick butt out there.

713
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,917
You're great.

[whistle blows]

715
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,210
Hey, Sam.

716
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,412
Yeah?

717
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,652
What is it, Dad?
How you doing?

718
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,248
Good.
Good. Good.

719
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:35,481
Ow!

720
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,585
What was that for? Jeez!

721
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,555
Did you just
kick your son?

722
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,223
Yeah.

Stop them! Stop them!

Are you following me?

Oh.

734
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,314
Shake it off, Sam.
Get some circulation
back in your skull.

Go, Jack, go.

[children cheering]

739
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,498
That's a legitimate goal,
right?

740
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,658
That's a real goal.

741
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:16,962
Okay, then,
that's a real goal.

742
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,696
10 more of those
and we're in business.

743
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,139
Look at me,
I'm the ref. I'm the ref.
I'm the ref.

(referee)
All right. Very funny.

745
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,076
You can't catch me
if you want,
because I'm the ref.

746
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,085
Okay. Very funny.
Very, very funny.
Very funny.

747
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,181
All right. You all had
a laugh? Fine! Play on!

748
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:39,280
Sorry about that.

749
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,949
How much do you think
those things are?

750
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,015
I have no idea.

751
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,085
Oh.

Shut up you little rats!

758
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,604
They're just showing
their appreciation.

759
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,904
Forget the appreciation.

760
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,070
I wanna win a soccer game!

761
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:02,945
Okay.

762
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,208
Hey, can I have this?

763
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,977
Yeah, go ahead.
All right!

764
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,217
Uh, good game, everyone.

765
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,845
Great effort.
Come on, let's go.

766
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,288
We'll just reconvene
at a later time.

00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,430
All right, everyone.

768
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,491
Uh, if I could
have your attention.

769
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,469
I got a little something
for the Tigers here

770
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,699
to express my--my gratitude

771
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,434
and, well,
just a big thank you

772
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,702
for all the hard work.

773
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:32,765
(woman)
All right!

774
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:33,833
So, uh...

775
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,846
So what'd you bring, Phil?

776
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,211
Finches.

777
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,510
Fishes?

778
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,279
No! No, no, no. No.
Finches. Birds.

779
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,546
I'm holding them.

780
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,315
They're tiny birds.

781
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,654
Yeah, so everyone,
come up here
and grab a finch.

Come on. Come on, guys.

783

You can watch them grow,
right in front of
your, uh, very own eyes.

[birds twittering]

785
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,000
We have to keep them?

786
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,535
You get to keep them.

787
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,662
Why is this fun?

788
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,605

I want to welcome you all

Highland Heights
Soccer Organization
parent's dinner.

790
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,476
Every year,
we like to take
a little time

791
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,518
for the coaches
to come up here

792
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,076
to tell us a little
about their team.

793
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,178
(man)
All right.

794
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,951
How about I bring up
someone who's new
to coaching in this league,

795
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,491
but is close to me?

796
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,119
I love him like a son.
Come on up, Phil.

Come on, Phil.

00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,894
Come on, Philly. Come on.

799
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,455
Go. Yes.

800
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,362
Good guy. Good guy.

801
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,960
[man whistling]

802
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,603
Good to see you.

803
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,135
Thanks, Dad.

804
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,775
Uh, thanks, Janice.

805
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,376
Hello, uh,

806
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,612
I'm, uh, I'm Phil Weston.

807
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,151
And you got balls!

808
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,208
[audience laughing]

809
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,546
He's got vitamins.

810
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,147
[audience laughing]

811
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,653
That's very funny, Dad.
Hilarious.

812
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,991
So when I took over
for Coach Benson--

813
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,553
I hear he's a woman now.

814
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,894
[audience laughing]

815
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:02,990
Ooh.

816
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:06,002
Actually, uh, truth be told,
no one knows
where he is right now.

817
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,662
A lot of people
are concerned.

818
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,331
[audience laughing]

819
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,068
I don't know
why that's funny.

820
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,776
God, I'm going to be honest,
I--I didn't plan on
speaking tonight.

821
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,444
I--I was-- I was
actually hoping that

822
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,783
my--my assistant coach
would be here,

823
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,655
uh, to kind of...

824
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,520
[audience murmuring]

825
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:32,423
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to introduce
Mike Ditka.

826
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,628
[audience cheering]

827
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,495
It's Mike Ditka, everyone!

828
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,534
Say a few words.

829
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,799
Thanks, Paul,
thanks, everybody.
It's--It's great to be here

830
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,364
and, uh, gonna have
a lot of fun tonight.

831
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,875
Paul's got the Tigers
on the move.

832
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,036
All right!

833
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,343
You live long enough,
you see everything.

834
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:53,714
Iron Mike and Aluminum Phil
coaching the Tigers.

835
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,309
[audience laughing]

836
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,251
I couldn't really hear you.

837
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,052
My Super Bowl ring
was making too much noise.

838
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:01,814
Ooh.

839
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,686
You see it, Dad?
Right there, Dad.
That was a great one.

840
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,390
Read it and weep.

841
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,228
[audience applauding]

842
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,701
Ditka is a great coach,
we understand that,
but he's a football coach.

843
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,794
Understand?
Right.

844
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,396
And we are
still losing, Phil.

845
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,941
Okay, I understand
your concern about our record,

846
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,204
but with me
it's not about win-lose.

847
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,769
We are going to win one game
eventually, right?

848
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,212
Well, we've had
a rocky start,

849
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,479
but with
a strong team effort,
we will win some

850
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:29,981
I think.

851
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,252
Remember,
there's no "l" in team.

852
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,255
But there is an "l"
in win.

853
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,383
There is an "l" in win.

854
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,484
Hey, wait.

855
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,583
Uh, parents,
Honey.

856
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,324
I didn't see you step up
when the team was in need.

857
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,490
Okay.
Okay.

858
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,693
Phil is not
the greatest coach
in the world,

859
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,633
I'll give you that,
but at least he's trying.

860
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:46,829
I can defend myself,
please.

861
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,702
You think he enjoys losing
week after week,

862
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:49,797
in front of his own son?

863
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,899
You're making it worse.
You're making it worse.

864
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,841
What's with the birds?
That was weird.

865
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,039
I've got my hands full
with Hunter.
I don't need a bird.

866
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,275
Okay, you know what?
You got me. All right?

867
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,873
The finches were
a bad idea.

868
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,977
And I wasn't going to
say this, but I think
some of them have salmonella.

869
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,578
A fair amount, in fact.
What?

870
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,454
I may have inadvertently
poisoned your children.

871
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,160
You and l,
we got something going.

872
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,753
You know, maybe we can coach
the Little League together.

873
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,195
You really
think that, huh?
Yeah.

874
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,493
Coach Ditka?
Yes?

875
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:20,526
Hi. Um, uh, our son,
Byong Sun, he's very shy
and I was just wondering--

876
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,334
Sure. Yeah, I'd be glad to.

877
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,738
Thank you so much.

878
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,866
How do you spell that?

879
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,276
It's, uh, Byong Sun.
B-Y--

880
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,335
I think I got it.

881
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,574
Oh, oh, okay,

882
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,013
Okay?
thank you.

883
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,015
Bye-bye.

884
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,073
Thanks, Phil.

885
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,382
Yeah. They're great.

886
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,443
Just a wonderful couple.

887
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:38,955
(Phil)
Yeah.

888
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,591
Bing Bong?

889
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,721
Hey, Philly.

890
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,929
Yeah, Dad.

891
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,396
Hey, I've been
meaning to talk to you

892
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,161
about this Ditka thing.
I don't like it one bit.

893
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,531
Yeah, well, he's right here.

894
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,864
I'm not blind.

895
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,427
What, are you trying
to stick it to the old man?

896
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,370
You go to my mortal enemy
for help?

897
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,204
That's no way
to talk about your neighbor.

898
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,208
Oh, yeah?

899
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,369
He's right.

900
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,039
I hated him
from the first time
I laid eyes on him.

901
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:06,015
Maybe even before that,
because I know
you're the guy that wrote

902
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,949
"Ditka sucks" on my driveway.

903
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,179
What are you
even doing here?

904
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,244
You're just doing this
to get under my skin.

905
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,653
I'm glad you figured it out.

906
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,986
And I'm getting under
your skin.

907
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:16,049
It's gonna get
a lot worse
before it gets better.

908
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,685
In your dreams.

909
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,296
Ooh.

910
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:22,492
Hey, why don't you take
that pretty young wife
of yours and go home?

911
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,625
What did you call her?

912
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,464
(Phil)
Hey guys, please.
It's a compliment.

913
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,026
I said she's lovely
and she's young.

914
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,164
She's the light of my life.
You don't talk about her.

915
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,229
I go home when I want.

916
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,242
It's Mike Ditka. He's big.
Stay out of this.

917
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,471
I'll tell you
for the last time.
Hit the road!

918
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,603
Who's gonna make me?
I am.

919
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,704
You're acting like-- Oh!

920
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:40,446
I took a punch
from Hall of Famer,
Mike Ditka,

921
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,315
and I did not go down.

922
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,753
Sure, I wobbled a bit,
but I did not go down.

923
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,518
That Ditka has fists
like a small truck.

924
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,392
Come here.

925
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:52,690
[thumping]

926
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,853
Okay.

927
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,089
[groans]

928
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,861
Yeah, you need to relax.

929
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,333
Yeah.

930
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,530
You should've
seen the look
on my dad's face.

931
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:01,594
Priceless.

932
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,298
'Cause that punch
was meant for him,

933
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,103
that's what
makes me feel so good.

934
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,736
Okay, Phil,
can we please not talk

935
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,905
about your dad
or Ditka tonight?
Please?

936
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,950
I--l... You just need
to relax.

937
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:14,410
You're right.
Yeah.

938
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,009
I'm sorry.
Okay.

939
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,784
Yeah, I just get--

940
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,117
[both moaning]

941
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,154
[sobbing]

942
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,186
I'm in
way over my head.

943
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,926
I got punched in the face
and it hurt.

944
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,697
Honey, come on,
the kids need a real coach.

945
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:32,667
Phil?

946
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,704
Yeah?

947
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:34,703
I love you.

948
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,138
What does that have
to do with anything?

949
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,371
Okay. I quit.
I give up. I give up.
You go talk to Ditka.

950
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,676
What for? He scares me.

951
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,782
Have you ever
looked into his eyes?

952
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,281
Or at his hair?

953
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,718
Well, he's been coaching
for a long time.

954
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,187
Share your feelings
with him.

955
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,190
You want me
to share my feelings
of inadequacy

956
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,316
with Mike Ditka?

957
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,190
Uh. What else can you do?

958
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,592
[sighs]

959
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,188
Okay. You're right.

960
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,664
You're right.
You're always right.

961
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:07,602
I'm sorry.
I'll go talk to him.

962
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:08,764
Okay?
Okay.

963
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,102
And, Phil...
Yeah?

964
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,438
try not to cry
in front of him.

965
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,306
[bawling]

966
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,273
Hey, hey, get a grip
on yourself, okay? Man up.

967
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,338
I can't.

968
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,214
You better or else
I'm gettin' out of here.

969
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,877
Here, drink this coffee.

970
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,582
I don't like coffee.
It's a vasoconstrictor.

971
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,954
Hey, coffee is
the number one drink
in the world.

972
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,117
Everybody drinks it.

973
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,525
Even little kids in Mexico
drink coffee.

974
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,655
Well, I'm not a little kid
in Mexico.

975
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:37,132
[sobbing]
Okay? In fact,
I don't know who I am.

976
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:41,467
I took a long hard look
at myself in the mirror,
and you know what I saw?

977
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,528
What?

978
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:43,631
Nothing.

979
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,335
My dad, he's something.

980
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:48,572
I mean, I've never
lived up to my dad's
expectations.

981
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:52,446
And to top it all off,
I'm letting Sam down.
My own son!

982
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,384
Ah. Hey!

983
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,544
Ow!

984
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,417
Knock it off.
I don't care about that.

985
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,251
Why is everyone
slapping me lately?

986
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,723
Drink the coffee.
It'll make you
feel better.

987
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,783
I don't-- I don't like...

988
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:04,850
[sniffing]

989
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,728
Um, uh,

990
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,733
Yeah. Uh-huh.
yeah, it's good.

991
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,462
Picks you up.
It calms you down.

992
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,062
It's the lifeblood
that drives the dreams
of champions.

993
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,128
Oh.

994
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,902
Now, you gotta tell me
the problem,

995
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,409
but if you cry,
I'm out of here.

996
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:23,413
I--I can't do it.
I can't coach.
I can't beat my old man.

997
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,143
You can beat your dad!
He's just a man.

998
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,276
This coaching business,
Paul, is tough stuff.

999
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,250
Phil.

1000
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,844
Whatever. It's tough stuff.

1001
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,787
And when you lose,
it all comes down on you.

1002
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,484
But listen,
when you put it
all together,

1003
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,584
and you win,
it's the greatest feeling
in the world.

1004
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,060
It's like
winning the Super Bowl.

1005
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,391
Really?
Yeah, really.

1006
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,454
Except, you saddled me
with a bunch of stiffs.

1007
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,432
Take me 3 years
to get these guys
shaped up.

1008
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,525
I'm sorry.

1009
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,229
But I got a good idea.

1010
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:49,933
Maybe we take a shortcut,
stick it to your old man
real good.

1011
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,534
But in order to do that,
we gotta get
some fresh meat.

1012
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,578
Okay.

1013
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,704
(Umberto)
Keepa this up,
you get nowhere in meat.

It's almost 10..00.

1016
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,908
(Maria)
Okay.

1017
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,009
Umberto!

1018
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,075
Hey, coach.

1019
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:07,090
Don't you worry,
I got you bratwurst
all ready.

00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,486
Hello.

Beautiful. Grazie.

00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,153
Right.

1024
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,631
Are your nephews
working today?

1025
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,031
Uh, si, in the back.

1026
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,035
Go back and take
a look at these guys.

1027
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,965
Really?
Yeah, yeah.

1028
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,062
(Umberto)
Maria?

Wow!

00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:37,779
Oh, they're terrific.

1032
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,789
Pretty impressive, huh?

1033
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,025
[both whooping]
Yes!

1034
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:47,592
These kids are the right age,
and they live in the district.
Why not?

[speaking ltalian]

1036
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,494
Uh, excuse me, mister.
Your--Your two nephews...

1037
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,502
(Umberto)
Si?

1038
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,597
Uh, would--would they be
interested in, uh,
playing soccer?

1039
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,073
Massimo e Gian Piero?

1040
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:59,166
(Phil)
Yeah.

1041
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,040
No, no, no,
they not play soccer.

1042
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,444
They come here
to apprentice me.
Yeah.

1043
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,505
They have too much
to learn.

1044
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,211
You know, English, meat.
Too much.

1045
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,719
So they don't
play soccer at all?

1046
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,776
[speaking ltalian]

1047
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,149
(Phil)
They could learn
from the American kids.

1048
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,693
Don't look like that to me.
Please.

[speaking ltalian]

They play with American kids,
they--they pick up English.

1051
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:24,232
A lot--lot of famous athletes
have learned English
through sports.

have some fun.

Okay! Okay!

1059
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:39,606
Great.

1060
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:43,518
But remember.
Meat first, then soccer.

1061
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:44,576
Yes!

I've got two new players

are from ltaly, okay?

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,343
So they don't
speak English that well.

1072
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,439
We're all gonna
help them learn.

1073

They're apprentice butchers.

not make it?

? Let's get it started
in here ??

1277
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:45,960
(boys)
Go Tigers!

1278
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:50,022
? Spaghetti, marinara,
lasagna ??

1279
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,967
Don't forget
the meatballs!

1280
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,472
Hey, hey!

1281
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,944
Hey! Here we go!

1282
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,838
Hey.

1283
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,349
Are you serious?

1284
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,419
I'll go change
in my car.

1285
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:11,647
Hurry up.

1286
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,481
[all cheering]

1287
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:22,622
[sizzling]

1288
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:23,996
Yeah.

1289
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,063
Hey, Philly.

1290
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,137
[sighs]

1291
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,194
Smells good.

1292
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:30,240
Yeah.

1293
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:31,467
They're
sirloin burgers.

1294
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,530
No, I mean the air.

1295
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:33,598
What?

1296
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,076
Smells fresh.
Yeah.

1297
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,169
What do you
mean?

1298
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,235
Beautiful day.

1299
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:38,338
Yeah.

1300
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,280
Couldn't ask for
a more beautiful day.

1301
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,282
I'm feeling
fully alive.

1302
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,854
Tigers have won
five in a row.

1303
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,552
The ltalians and Ditka
have won five in a row.

1304
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,727
We're 500.

1305
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,123
Yeah,
we're 1,000.

1306
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,354
Look, Dad,
I got a feeling

1307
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,194
we're gonna make
it to the finals.

1308
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,699
You what?
Gonna go where?

1309
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,167
Yeah.

1310
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,293
You're serious?

1311
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,803
Yeah, you bet I'm serious.

1312
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:04,005
[chuckling]

1313
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:10,142
Looks like somebody needs
to be taken down
a couple of notches.

1314
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,339
What is the law, Phil?

1315
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:12,382
Stop it, Dad.

1316
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,848
The law says..

1317
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,010
"You shall never beat
the old man at anything."

1318
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,110
Just serve.

1319
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:18,154
Okay.

1320
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:21,680
[chuckling]

1321
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:22,948
[groans]

1322
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:26,251
[chuckles]

1323
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,631
Oh, foul, foul, foul!
Come on!

1324
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,900
You a little klutzy?

1325
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,027
All right.

1326
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,794
Okay,
here we go.

1327
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,837
Pooh! Boom!

1328
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:38,897
[groaning]

1329
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,637
Sorry.
Huevos Rancheros.

1330
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:45,239
You wanna quit now?

1331
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,475
No, no, no, no, no.

1332
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:49,708
[grunts]

1333
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,310
Oh!

1334
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:54,045
[chuckles]

1335
00:49:58,862 --> 00:49:59,954
Ole!

1336
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,319
[groaning]

1337
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:06,024
[laughing]

1338
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:08,995
You okay?

1339
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:10,130
Serve it.

1340
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,777
[groaning]

1341
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:20,610
Phil? Honey?

1342
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,911
Don't talk to me,
it's father-son time!

1343
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:25,944
[chuckling]

1344
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:32,193
Come on.

1345
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,863
Somebody should be
videotapin' this.

1346
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:44,631
Ooh. Who's your trainer?

1347
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,308
Stop talking and serve!

1348
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,334
Maniac.

1349
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,751
Now, I bury you.

1350
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:01,391
Bury you!

1351
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:02,747
Bury you!

1352
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,315
Bury you!

1353
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,553
Yeah.

1354
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,465
I'll see you inside.

1355
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:11,660
Okay.

1356
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,724
[chuckling]

1357
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:24,371
That's the best
I've ever played
against him.

1358
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,212
Yeah, it didn't grind
the barbecue to a halt at all.

1359
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,109
Ow.

1360
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,950
You made
an excellent impression
on your son, by the way.

1361
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:35,715
Hey, l--I almost had you.

1362
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:41,721
What do you call that again,
when you almost win?

1363
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:44,494
Oh, yeah, yeah, losing.

1364
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:56,675
I'll tell you, Dad.

1365
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:59,010
The Tigers are
making it to the finals.

1366
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,378
That ain't
never gonna happen.

1367
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,508
Oh, yeah?

1368
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,417
Never.

1369
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,417
You wanna make a bet?

1370
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:08,480
Yeah.

1371
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:09,581
Yeah?

1372
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,684
Fine. Okay.
We'll bet.

1373
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:14,262
I beat you,

1374
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:17,164
and you sell that break-even
snake-oil stand of yours.

1375
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,962
And you're gonna
come to work for me.

1376
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,764
No. No, I'm not
gonna work for you.

1377
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:22,827
Uh? Oh.

1378
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:24,973
[imitating
chicken clucking]

1379
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,471
Okay, okay,
okay, okay. Stop.

1380
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,042
Okay. But if I win...

1381
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:33,349
What?

1382
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,643
I get the Pele ball.

1383
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:38,647
Do what?

1384
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:40,280
If I beat you
in the finals,

1385
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:44,353
Pele ball.
It's mine. I get it.

1386
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,398
(commentator)
Here comes Pele.

1387
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:53,061
A little high
and into the crowd.

1388
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,301
I got it! I got it!

1389
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:56,566
No. I got it.

1390
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,071
[people clapping]

1391
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,266
Yeah!

1392
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:00,467
Dad?

1393
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:02,168
What?

1394
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,269
Can I have the ball?

1395
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,371
For what?
I caught it. Why?

1396
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:07,040
You get
the next one.

1397
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,911
If I beat you in the finals,
I get the Pele ball.

1398
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:13,647
For the day.

1399
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,018
Forever.

1400
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:18,023
No way, Jose.
No, sir. No way.

1401
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:19,686
[imitating chicken clucking]

1402
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,186
[all laughing]

1403
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,633
All right. All right.

1404
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,327
Yeah?

1405
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:29,065
We got ourselves a bet,
okay?

1406
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,299
All right.

1407
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:31,904
Good.
Good.

1408
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:33,272
Good.
Yes.

1409
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,343
See you tomorrow.

1410
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:35,309
Okay. Good.

1411
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,812
Yeah, I think we're gonna
have to cut you off, sir.

1412
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:47,513
Ooh.

1413
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,388
Not a chance.
Gotta go feed the meter.

1414
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:50,824
Line 'em up.

1415
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,860
Your wife told me about

1416
00:53:57,934 --> 00:53:59,424
the bet you made
with your old man.

1417
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:00,969
Oh, yeah?
What of it?

1418
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:02,327
I think maybe

1419
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,736
you're getting
ahead of yourself.

1420
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:05,468
We played the easy
part of our schedule.

1421
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:06,839
We gotta win
five games in a row

1422
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,343
just to make
the semifinals.

1423
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,469
So maybe you should--

1424
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,309
Maybe you should
worry more about the team

1425
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,541
and less
about the schedule.

1426
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:13,605
What?

1427
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,310
There's a lot of
slothfulness going on.

1428
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:16,352
Slothfulness?

1429
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,511
Yeah.

1430
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,020
Let's go, Tigers.
Bring it in.

1431
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,555
Bring it in, guys.

1432
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,423
Let's go.

1433
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:24,951
Grab some bench.

1434
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,155
Look how much time it takes
for them to come in.

1435
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,993
Take a seat.
Let's go.

1436
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,030
Okay, guys.

1437
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:34,167
I had you come
here early today,

1438
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:36,636
so we could talk
about some sloppy play.

1439
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,102
It's come
to my attention

1440
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:42,110
that lately,
I've noticed

1441
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:44,476
a general,
blatant disregard

1442
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:45,809
for our game plan.

1443
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:48,942
Ambrose.

1444
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:49,986
Yeah?

1445
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:51,543
I saw a bunch of
nonsense out there.

1446
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,646
What was going
through your head
out there last week?

1447
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,281
I was breaking
my back for you, Coach,

1448
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:56,950
because of my love
for the game.

1449
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,153
Liar!

1450
00:54:58,595 --> 00:54:59,892
Jack.
What?

1451
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,692
Who are you supposed
to pass the ball to?

1452
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:02,732
The ltalians.

1453
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,857
Right. Alex, when?

1454
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,457
When I come in
contact with the ball.

1455
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,696
The instant you come
in contact with the ball.

1456
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:08,897
That's our strategy.

1457
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,837
It's one of the many plays
we've worked out.

1458
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,602
It's the only play
we've worked out.

1459
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:14,701
How many sarcastic pills
did you take this morning?

1460
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:15,802
Coach,
I'm just saying--

1461
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:16,903
"But, Coach..."

1462
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,675
[mocking]

1463
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:23,111
You gotta
lighten up.

1464
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:24,312
He started it.

1465
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,990
I seem to remember
a certain little boy

1466
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,958
who was very
sad when he lost.

1467
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:33,052
And that same little boy
was very happy when he won.

1468
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:35,387
I'm doing this
for you, okay?

1469
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:36,932
So that
we can have fun.

1470
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,393
Right? Fun. Okay.

1471
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:41,401
Yeah.

1472
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,069
Hey,
you're--you're late.

1473
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:44,766
Wh-Wh-Where've
you been?

1474
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,902
Uh,
there's a problem.

1475
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,568
Wait, where's Gian
Piero and Massimo?

1476
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,145
We were supposed
to pick them up.

1477
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,747
Hey, what's going on?

1478
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,974
[speaking in ltalian]

1479
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,744
[all gasp]
Where are my ltalians?

1480
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,210
Huh?

1481
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:02,357
I can't afford to
lose this one, Umberto.

1482
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,785
Meat is now.
Me and the boy will work

1483
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,624
all day to get
this order done.

1484
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,561
It's a big, big order.

1485
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:11,429
No, no, no. I... Believe me,
I know. Meat comes first.

1486
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:12,468
Sure.

1487
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,901
I've only heard it about
a thousand times from you.

1488
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:17,769
I can't talk to you.
Here, you take this.

1489
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,638
(Phil)
I'm really getting
sick and tired of

1490
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,267
"the meat comes first."
I'm sorry.

1491
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:22,402
? Happy birthday ??

1492
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,776
Quiet please!

1493
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,741
Shut up!
I'm on the phone.

1494
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:27,407
You're not
the only one in the park.

1495
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,543
You know, at a certain point,

1496
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:31,109
these kids just
wanna play soccer.

1497
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:32,711
They don't care
about the meat.

1498
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:35,656
Uh, do I have to say that?
'Cause that's gonna cause

1499
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,158
some kind of
a dramatic situation here.

1500
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,321
What are you saying, eh?

1501
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,728
What? Hello? Umberto?

1502
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,231
Umberto?

1503
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:48,527
All right, guys.

1504
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:51,368
We got 25 minutes
and a lot of beef to cut.

1505
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:52,806
Let's get to it.

1506
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,271
[saw whirring]

1507
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,903
(Phil)
Watch me, boys, I'm goin' in!

1508
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,210
Whoa!

1509
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,609
[horn blaring]

1510
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:06,944
[all yelling]

1511
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:20,191
[gasps]

1512
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:40,849
We made it.
Sorry we're late.

1513
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:42,647
Hey, Stew.

1514
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:44,056
Hey.

1515
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,824
Uh. Listen. One of-- One of my
guys didn't bring his socks.

1516
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:49,831
So, we forfeit.

1517
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,795
You hear that, Vultures,
we forfeit. Let's go.

1518
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,201
[whistle blowing]
Come on! Run!

1519
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,431
Hurry, run quickly!

1520
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,337
Run! Run to the car! Run!

1521
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,171
Don't look back! Run!

1522
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:01,968
We won!

1523
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:03,069
We won.

1524
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,302
[all cheering]

1525
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:08,375
Two, four, six, eight,
who do we appreciate?

1526
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:10,214
Vultures. Vultures.

1527
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:11,583
Yeah!

1528
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:13,018
Good job, guys.

1529
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:20,061
Phil, it's freezing out here.

1530
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,425
It's not Phil.
It's Coach Weston.

1531
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:24,294
And it's not
freezing out here.

1532
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,561
Then why did you
build a fire?

1533
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:29,768
Because fire is
the stuff of warriors.

1534
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:33,007
And that's what we are,
right? Warriors?

1535
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:36,011
The Hopi lndians
called fire...

1536
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,978
[speaking gibberish]

1537
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,982
Coach, what are we
doing out here, anyway?

1538
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,850
We're bonding.
We're becoming a team.

1539
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:49,686
Surviving the elements,
here in the backyard.

1540
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,490
Coach, did you order
the pizzas yet?

1541
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:54,893
In due time, Connor.
In due time.

1542
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:58,163
However,
I want all of you to know

1543
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,498
if the pizzas don't arrive,

1544
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,437
I've already
made the decision

1545
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:04,132
that we will eat Byong Sun.

1546
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:08,634
All right.
We're not gonna eat him.

1547
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,271
But he does look delicious,
you have to admit, right,

1548
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:12,905
if we had to eat someone?

1549
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,041
Dad, you're
getting a little creepy.

1550
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,277
I know,
let's all bay at the moon.

1551
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,578
What?

1552
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,849
You know, howl like a wolf.

1553
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:23,051
[howling]

1554
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,490
(woman)
Shut up out there!

1555
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:30,258
You shut up in there!

1556
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,831
Come on, everyone.
Bay at the moon.

1557
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:34,025
[howling]

1558
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,396
[all howling]

1559
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:42,900
[barking]

1560
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,870
[all screaming]

1561
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:46,871
[dogs barking]

1562
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,123
(woman)
Ooh, I don't know.

1563
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:56,920
The lrish Cream
sounds good, huh?

1564
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,585
What's that?

1565
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,993
Uh, it's cream
and it's, uh, it's lrish.

1566
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:02,463
Hurry up and order.

1567
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,164
Excuse me. Thank you.

1568
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:10,003
How about a smoothie?
What's in that?

1569
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:12,707
Smoothie's a juice drink.
We want coffee.

1570
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:13,799
Buddy, relax.

1571
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:14,865
No, you relax.

1572
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,969
I'm a regular here.
This line needs to move.

1573
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:18,638
I beg your pardon.

1574
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,307
Do you have scones?

1575
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:21,907
Tall, non fat,
double latte--

1576
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,475
Sir, you're at
the back of the line.

1577
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:24,542
I recognize that!

1578
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,952
Cut it out or
you're out of here.

1579
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:26,954
You can't
kick me out!

1580
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,048
You know,
you're--you're really
invading my ear space.

1581
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,387
I'm a frequent
coffee drinker.

1582
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,018
I'm part of the club.
I have a card.

1583
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:33,722
Do you have a card?
Do you have a card?

1584
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:34,956
No, I don't
have a card.

1585
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:36,191
Does anyone here
have a card?

1586
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:37,789
We don't have
frequent drinker cards.

1587
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,266
[screams]
That's a video club card.

1588
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:40,495
Zip it there,
Sporty Spice.

1589
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:42,628
Are we doing this?
Is this
happening now?

1590
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:43,797
Yeah. Wanna go?

1591
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,033
Great.
I'd love to.

1592
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,700
Let's do it. Come on.

1593
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:49,267
You're hurting me!
You're hurting me!

1594
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,040
What is wrong
with you, Derrick?

1595
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:52,240
I thought
we were friends!

1596
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,407
My name is Andy!

1597
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,917
Your name is Liar,
'cause you're telling lies.

1598
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,213
You know what the odds are

1599
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:58,820
I will never come

There's a good
chance of that!

we'll have to take.

any laziness there, okay?

We win this,
we're in the finals.

1616
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:41,490
If we get a big lead,
we gotta pummel these guys.

1617

We gotta pummel them
at all costs.

1618

Dominate and hammer them.

but don't get caught.

Byong Sun, stay low, okay?

1622
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:53,535
That's easy for you.

1623
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:55,543
Just chop block them
in the back of the knee.

1624
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:56,805
That'll work well.

Ambrose, you're big.

1626

Don't be afraid
to throw the elbow.

1627
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,281
If you break
someone's collarbone,

1628
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,545
that's a good thing.
That's what the medic's for.

Otherwise,
he's just sitting around,
all right?

You hear me?

Hey, Phil.

I--l--I don't think that's
a very good attitude.

You can't talk about
hurting other players.

You don't-- you don't think?

1636

I don't think you
should be butting in

when I'm talking
to my team.

1638

You're my assistant, okay?

1639
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:24,397
You're supposed to
back me up

1640
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,271
and go get me juice boxes
when I tell you.

1641
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:27,741
Now go get me
a juice box.

1642
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,300
You know who
you're talking to?

1643

I'm talking to

You're crazy!

I'm not crazy.
I'm just thirsty.

No, you go to hell!

grab me a juice box!

I would whip your butt!

1759
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,037
What a day!

1760
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:56,839
Wh-What is with the coffee?

1761
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:59,606
Every home in Europe has
its own coffee press.

1762
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,047
In fact, every room.

1763
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:02,976
Okay,
you know what, Phil?

1764
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:05,077
You gotta stop.
You've gone overboard.

1765
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:06,548
What are you talking about?

1766
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:09,250
You called a group of
10-year-olds "losers."

1767
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:10,483
I did not.

1768
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:11,787
You screamed it
through a cone.

1769
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:12,850
Everyone heard you.

1770
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:15,055
What do you want me
to call them? Winners?

1771
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:17,099
'Cause that would
make me a liar, okay?

1772
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,100
And at least, give me that.
I am not a liar.

1773
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:20,465
You just lied, just a--
When?

1774
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:21,696
Just a second ago!
When?

1775
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,295
About the cone thing!

1776
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,397
Okay, you got me
on that one.

1777
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:26,998
That's one lie,
though.

1778
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,369
We're in the finals.

1779
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,412
Am I the only one
who cares about that?

1780
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:31,773
Where's Sam?

1781
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,541
Well, Sam's up in his room.

1782
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:35,277
Very upset. Very depressed.

1783
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:37,079
Depressed? We won.

1784
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,653
You didn't play him,
Phil.

1785
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:41,986
I warned you about,
this has become all
about you and Buck.

1786
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,184
That is patently untrue.

1787
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:45,693
And as far as Sam not playing
in the game, that's his fault.

1788
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:46,727
What?

1789
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:49,230
He needs to speak up, okay?
I can't worry
about every player.

1790
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:51,289
I can't talk to
you about this.
No, not anymore.

1791
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:52,800
I don't even
know who you are.

1792
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,301
You're not human,
that's for sure.

1793
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,860
You're like some
kind of animal.

1794
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:56,962
An animal?

1795
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,472
Yes, like a wild animal.

1796
01:07:58,574 --> 01:07:59,598
Where are you going?

1797
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:00,642
I'm going.

1798
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:03,975
Coffee will make
you feel better.

1799
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,823
? The eye of the tiger ??

1800
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,156
(Phil)
Barbara, are you there?
Pick up. It's me.

1801
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,563
Game's about to start.

1802
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:27,067
Where's Sammy?
I thought you guys
were gonna meet me here.

1803
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:28,431
Hello? Hello?

1804
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:31,672
You know what,
I gotta run.

1805
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,766
What are you?
Who dresses you these days?

1806
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,778
What's this,
some kind of clown outfit?

1807
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,178
No.
It's a Tiger outfit.

1808
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:40,745
Good. Good.

1809
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,879
Some of the cool stuff
I can do.

1810
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:45,111
And you think this
suit's gonna help you?

1811
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,652
We'll see.
Might be a good luck charm.

1812
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,361
Okay, good luck, Son.
You're gonna need it.

1813
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:54,418
[chuckles]

1814
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:05,403
Bring it in. Let's go.
Huddle it up. Come on.

1815
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:06,839
Coach, um, where's Sam?

1816
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:08,274
Because I don't
see him anywhere.

1817
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,141
He'll be here.
Don't worry about it. Okay.

1818
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:12,146
[whispering]
Guys, listen up.

1819
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:17,515
Now I don't think it needs
to be said more than once

1820
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:19,653
how important
today's game is, huh?

1821
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:21,815
[whispering]
This is what we've
worked all year for.

1822
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,415
Why are you whispering?

1823
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:25,083
For dramatic effect!

1824
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:27,362
Who are those
guys over there, huh?

1825
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:28,521
(boys)
Tigers.

1826
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:29,859
They look like
pussycats to me.

1827
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:31,194
What do you say?
Yeah.

1828
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:32,256
Afraid of 'em?

1829
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,323
(boys)
No!

1830
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:34,334
Okay.

1831
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:36,462
You step on this field,
this is all about you.

1832
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:39,406
I mean, I'm not gonna be
the one staying up
late at night,

1833
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:42,000
you know, punching a hole
through the window

1834
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:45,137
or crying myself to sleep
or wetting my bed.

1835
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,416
Okay? That's not gonna be me.

1836
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:49,644
'Cause I'm fine.

1837
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:51,413
I got my vitamin store
to go back to.

1838
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,580
I'm gonna be just great.
I'm gonna be great.

1839
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:55,385
Let me hear you say
that we can do this.

1840
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:56,446
We can do this!

1841
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,685
Again.
We can do this!

1842
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,921
One more time.
We can do this!

1843
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,519
You either win

1844
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:04,293
and go on to greatness,
or you lose.

1845
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:08,294
And probably face a series of
cataclysmic events

1846
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,837
for the rest of your lives.

1847
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,296
Bring it in, guys.

1848
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,398
[whispering]
Bring it in.

1849
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,739
Tigers on three. Whisper.

1850
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,706
One, two, three.

1851
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:19,507
[all whispering]
Tigers.

1852
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,776
One, two, three, Gladiators!

1853
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:24,179
(Jim)
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen,

1854
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:27,347
and welcome to the HHSO
Championship game.

1855
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:29,015
I'll be giving
you a play-by-play,

1856
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:30,718
blow-by-blow of
what promises to be

1857
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:31,918
the game of the year.

1858
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:33,359
Look alive!

1859
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:35,486
Tigers versus the Gladiators.

1860
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:37,560
Gladiators with the ball.

1861
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,167
Immediately
stolen by Massimo!

1862
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,395
Go!

1863
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,766
Defense!
Push deeper! Deep! Deep!

1864
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,830
He kicks it high.
It's a perfect pass!

1865
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,569
Shot! Goal!

1866
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:48,769
Yeah!

1867
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:51,472
??[singing]

1868
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,640
Are you ready for this?

1869
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:00,321
The Gladiators with
some good ball movement.

1870
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:03,150
Shot! It's off the mark.

1871
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,053
Give it up, Dad!

1872
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:07,027
It's a long game, sonny!

1873
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:10,996
Hey, grab the pebble
from my hand, Grasshopper!

1874
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,461
What?

1875
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:15,162
Hey!
If it isn't fart-face Jones.

1876
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,398
What's up,
farty pants?

1877
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,198
Bring it on.

1878
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,206
You can have
the first punch right here.

1879
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:24,370
I could eat a box of cookies
for dinner if I want to.

1880
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:25,708
What? Can you do that? No.

1881
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,248
'Cause you're
a fart-face kid.

1882
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:30,308
Oh, my God!
No! Tigers! Help me!
Get him off me!

1883
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:31,508
[blowing whistle]

1884
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,077
Get him, Logan.
Attaboy, Logan.

1885
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:34,315
Ow! He's got my ear.

1886
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,290
He's got my ear!

1887
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:41,389
He's like a jackal from hell!

1888
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:45,464
(Jim)
Italians with the ball.

1889
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:48,001
And they pass it of
to little Byong Sun!

1890
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:49,866
Pass it off! Pass it!

1891
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:52,236
Do it! Shoot it,
Byong Sun. Shoot it!

1892
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,275
No! No, no.

1893
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:54,366
[grunts]

1894
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:55,774
(Jim)
Oh! Weak kick!

1895
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:58,745
Stolen away and
kicked way downfield.

1896
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:01,445
Gladiators moving the ball.

1897
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,246
Hunter, catch up!
Catch up.

1898
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,617
They find Bucky Weston
in the open.

1899
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:07,349
He shoots! Score!

1900
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,447
Yes!

1901
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:09,786
Gladiators tie the game.

1902
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:11,485
Byong Sun!

1903
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,462
What was that?

1904
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,086
I thought
I had the shot.

1905
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,154
You thought?

1906
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:18,824
How many times do
I have to say this?

1907
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:21,961
You can take as many shots
as you want during practice.

1908
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:24,104
But never ever
in a game.

1909
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,004
Especially not
the championship game.

1910
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:27,406
Okay,
you cannot talk to him--

1911
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:28,704
No, no, no.
Don't go there.

1912
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,608
Take a seat.
Go ahead.

1913
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,344
(Ann)
Ease up on him!

1914
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:35,344
You ease up on that
corduroy jacket of yours.

1915
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:36,840

(Jim)
Gladiators moving the ball.

1917
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,450
[referee whistles]
Oh! Number 14 goes down.

1918
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:45,220
Come on! That?

1919
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:46,420
Good call, ref!

1920
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:47,462
That's a bad call!

1921
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:48,621
All right, coaches!

1922
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:50,791
Coaches here, now!

1923
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,097
God! That's a bad call,
you know it!

1924
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:55,136
Hey, hey, hey.

1925
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,193
That's a bad call!

1926
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:57,329
Hey! Hey,
I'm warning you.

1927
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:58,395
Let me ask you a question.

1928
01:12:58,474 --> 01:12:59,463
Let me ask a question.

1929
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,338
How much you pay him
to make those calls?

1930
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,173
You are one wisecrack away

1931
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:04,678
from being thrown
out of this game.

1932
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:05,975
I don't want to
get thrown out.

1933
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:08,141
Can't a guy just be
enthusiastic about the game?

1934
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,377
You can be
enthusiastic...

1935
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:10,440
That's all I want to do.

1936
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:11,611
...at a respectable level.

1937
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:12,813
I just wanna have fun.

1938
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,651
Now, go to
your places!

1939
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,554
And keep your
comments to yourself.

1940
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,228
Wow! What was
that all about?

1941
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:22,796
Here's all I heard.

1942
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:23,797
The ref said....

1943
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:24,798
[sputtering]

1944
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:25,856
Then my Dad said...

1945
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:27,060
[sputtering]

1946
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:28,330
Then the ref said....

1947
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:29,393
[sputtering]

1948
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:30,961
Any more questions?

1949
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,132
Hit the road. Move it.

1950
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:34,605
[referee whistling]

1951
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,410
[boys cheering]

1952
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:38,636
(Jim)
Massimo with the ball,

1953
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:40,705
trying to pass it
off to his brother.

1954
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:42,407
Come on!

1955
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:45,217
But Buck Weston
has figured out
this Tiger offense.

1956
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:46,219
Go!

1957
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:47,277
[chuckles]

1958
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:49,517
(Phil)
Get back on defense!

1959
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:52,288
What did I just say?

1960
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,490
Bucky with another open shot.
Goal!

1961
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:58,692
Yes!

1962
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:00,826
Gladiators take the lead.

1963
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:02,003
Was anyone listening?

1964
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,628
The Italians have effectively
been shut down.

1965
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:05,070
Great.

1966
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:05,629
(Janice)
That's my boy!

1967
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:07,534
[whistle blowing]

1968
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:08,769
That's the half.

1969
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,177
Honey, wh-where have you been?

1970
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,683
I called you twice.

1971
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:19,285
What? Why isn't Sam
in his uniform?

1972
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:20,343
So, how's it going?

1973
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:22,447
It took me all morning
to convince him to come.

1974
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,992
And the only reason he is here
is to support his team.

1975
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,651
What, he doesn't
want to play for me?

1976
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,218
He would love to
play for you

1977
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:30,288
but you've turned
him into a benchwarmer.

1978
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:31,764
Sound familiar?

1979
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:33,958
Look, I just wanted

1980
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:36,504
to get to
the championship game, that...

1981
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:39,336
Well, you're here, Phil.

1982
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:45,979
I'm not crying.
It's frustration.

1983
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:49,711
Don't worry.
You'll be all right.
Gonna be all right.

1984
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:52,777
If you play the second half
the way you
played the first half,

1985
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:55,346
I'm gonna trade the whole team
to the Tigers next year.

1986
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:58,086
Can I go in now?
I have fresh legs.

1987
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,354
(Buck)
Philly, I can't.

1988
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:01,020
It's the championship game,
all right?

1989
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:02,324
Don't bother me, okay?

1990
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:04,058
I didn't play
the week before, either.

1991
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:06,692
I promise you,
I'll play you
next season, okay?

1992
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:07,894
You want to be Gladiators?

1993
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:08,902
(boys)
Yeah!

1994
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:10,233
Let's say,
"We are Gladiators."

1995
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:11,294
(boys)
We are Gladiators!

1996
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:13,170
Say it again!
We are Gladiators!

1997
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:16,541
Okay, go out
in the second half,
I want you to stay focused.

1998
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:20,707
You doing okay?
I know this is tough.

1999
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:23,216
Hey, guys.

2000
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,048
Sam, you think
I could talk to you?

2001
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:27,750
I guess.

2002
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:29,714
Honey, do you mind?

2003
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,450
Sure.

2004
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:38,065
So, I just
was thinking, uh...

2005
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:41,431
You know,
grown-ups are always
telling kids

2006
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:43,266
how they mess up, right?

2007
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:45,397
But the truth is

2008
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:47,308
sometimes
grown-ups screw up

2009
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,573
but we don't have anyone to
tell us when we do it.

2010
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:53,009
I screwed up, Sam.

2011
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:54,207
You think?

2012
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:58,615
I just got caught up
in everything.

2013
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:01,914
I really lost my way,
I mean,

2014
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:06,690
I apologize.

2015
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,325
I just wanna ask
you if you-- if you can

2016
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,161
find it in your heart
to forgive me

2017
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:13,264
and you give me
a second chance,

2018
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:14,825
I'd like to
make it up to you.

2019
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,300
Okay.

2020
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:20,869
You accept
my apology then?

2021
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:22,271
Yeah.

2022
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:25,538
Thanks, buddy.

2023
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:27,673
All right. You're
starting the second half.

2024
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:29,443
(Sam)
Really?

2025
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:30,712
Yeah.

2026
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:32,950
You're not worried
about losing the game?

2027
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:34,886
No, I'm worried
about losing you.

2028
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:37,284
I brought
your uniform
just in case.

2029
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:38,326
So, go suit up.

2030
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:39,360
All right.

2031
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:40,986
Okay?

2032
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:44,397
Good job.

2033
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:45,500
Thanks.

2034
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:47,357
Now, give me
that jacket.

2035
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,063
Oh.
It's bad?

2036
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:50,104
Horrible.

2037
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:51,139
Okay.

2038
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:52,195
(Phil)
Hey, guys.

2039
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,333
Everyone take a seat,
if you would.

2040
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:57,535
I have something important
I'd like to tell you. Um...

2041
01:16:58,914 --> 01:16:59,903
[sighs]

2042
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:03,479
I just want you guys to know
that I know that I blew it.

2043
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:06,614
I--l--l--I completely blew it.

2044
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:11,053
And we should've just been
having fun all along

2045
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,287
and honestly,
I don't know what happened.

2046
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:16,497
And I owe you,
I owe all of you an apology.

2047
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:19,832
I am very, very,

2048
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:24,568
very, very sorry.

2049
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:28,802
With a capital "S"
and a capital "ORRY."'

2050
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:31,273
You know what I mean.

2051
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,572
You--You guys are great kids.
You're unique

2052
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,811
with--with--with your own
strengths and talents,

2053
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:38,819
and I should've
been promoting that.

2054
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:41,745
Instead, I wasn't,
'cause I'm a lousy coach

2055
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:43,290
and I didn't
teach you anything.

2056
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:44,620
That's not true,
Dad.

2057
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:46,388
(all)
What?
What are you talking about?

2058
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:47,587
He's a lousy coach.

2059
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,789
He didn't teach me anything.

2060
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:50,161
(Byong Sun)
He tried to kill me.

2061
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:52,826
He taught us exactly how
not to play soccer.

2062
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:56,096
Actually, Sam's right.

2063
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:57,899
That's exactly what I did.

2064
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:00,866
We just need to
take the field

2065
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:02,534
and you guys
just do e-e-exactly

2066
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,841
the opposite of
everything I've taught you.

2067
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:06,073
Does that make sense?

2068
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:07,945
What have l-- What have l
told you to do?

2069
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,643
Always play the ltalians.

2070
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:11,447
Okay. There you go.

2071
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:12,679
Gian Piero, Massimo,

2072
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,221
we'll get some
fresh legs in there.

2073
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:15,415
Give you guys a rest?

2074
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:16,650
Rest?
Yeah.

2075
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:18,215
Okay. Grazie.

2076
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:19,282
Thanks.

2077
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,589
Wh-What else
have I taught you?

2078
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:22,391
Break people's clavicles.

2079
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:23,522
Chop block.

2080
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:25,257
Tattoos are cool!

2081
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:26,867
Don't remember that one.

2082
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:28,197
Coffee is the lifeblood

2083
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:30,067
that fuels
the dreams of champions.

2084
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:32,003
Right. Hold on.

2085
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:38,540
[all cheering]

2086
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:40,446
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

2087
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:45,552
(Mark)
Way to go, Byong Sun!

2088
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:48,483
[all cheering]

2089
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:53,326
All right. What else?

2090
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,890
The most important
thing is winning.

2091
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:58,598
No. No, no, no, no.
The most important thing

2092
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,863
is--is having fun and
trying your best, all right?

2093
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,637
So, let's get out there
and do everything

2094
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:06,765
the opposite of
what I've taught you.

2095
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,272
Sound like a plan?

2096
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:11,574
Bring it in. Here we go.

2097
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:12,806
Yes.

2098
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,382
(Phil)
What are we gonna do?

2099
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:16,974
(boys)
Don't listen to Phil!

2100
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:20,644
Take the field.
Here we go, guys. Have fun!

2101
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:23,590
(Jim)
Down by one,
the Tigers have both Italians

2102
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:25,057
sitting on the bench?

2103
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:27,061
Odd move by
Coach Phil Weston.

2104
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:29,493
Stop them, guys!

2105
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:34,635
Goal, and the Tiger
goalie goes down hard!

2106
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:35,794
Oh, my--

2107
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:36,838
(Buck)
That's it.

2108
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:39,271
That's the intensity
I've been looking for.
That's it.

2109
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:43,174
The Tiger goalie looks okay.

2110
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:44,769
Hey, ref? Injury?
Time out?

2111
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:46,313
Coach Weston is
taking no chances.

2112
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:47,712
Time out.
Everyone with glasses.

2113
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:49,214
Can I borrow your glasses?

2114
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:50,649
Would you mind?
Thank you.

2115
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,083
I appreciate that.

2116
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:53,678
You look like
you need those.

2117
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,646
Thank you.
Appreciate that.

2118
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:56,915
(Phil)
You all right?

2119
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:58,016
Yeah, I'm all right.

2120
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:00,288
Just want to do a
little vision test here.
All right?

2121
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:01,360
Is that better
or worse?

2122
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:02,396
Worse.

2123
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:04,355
Better or worse?

2124
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:05,399
Worse.

2125
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:07,801
Better or worse?

2126
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:09,092
Better!

2127
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:10,604
Okay. Put those on.
Let's go, guys.

2128
01:20:10,672 --> 01:20:12,003
Okay. All right.
Come on.

2129
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:13,062
Thanks.

2130
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,568
He's okay.

2131
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:22,140
(Jim)
Play resumes.

2132
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:24,515
The Gladiators still
dominating the field.

2133
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:29,080
Wow. An amazing save
by the Tiger goalie!

2134
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:30,215
Yes!
That's my baby!

2135
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:31,589
He stopped that goal.

2136
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:38,130
Tigers with the ball.

2137
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,929
Mark! Mark!

2138
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:40,990
On the neck!

2139
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:42,001
Yes!

2140
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:44,602
Mark Avery kicks the ball up,

2141
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,265
catches it on
the back of his neck.

2142
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:47,433
Yes.

2143
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:50,171
The rest of the Tigers are
forming some kind of wedge.

2144
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:51,769
Break through.
Win the ball back!

2145
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,405
Knock those clowns down.

2146
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,375
Mark Avery leads the league

2147
01:20:57,452 --> 01:20:59,352
in the least amount of
time played.

2148
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:02,780
Hey, keeper.

2149
01:21:06,461 --> 01:21:07,485
Ew!

2150
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:15,024
Mmm.

2151
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:16,092
[gags]

2152
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:19,371
Ambrose with
a powerhouse kick!

2153
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:23,938
[referee whistling]

2154
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:25,775
Yeah!

2155
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:28,040
[boys cheering]

2156
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:29,849
Yes!

2157
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:32,852
Hunter, I'd give you a kiss
but you just ate a worm.

2158
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,147
Yeah! Can you smell it?

2159
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:36,190
Yeah! All right, Mark!

2160
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:37,816
It's the smell
of victory, baby!

2161
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,383
I love you, Dad!

2162
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:41,526
See if you love me
at the end of the game.

2163
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:43,291
Let's go, guys. Stay focused.

2164
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:45,625
Every time you say
something back to me,

2165
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,292
it makes me love you more!

2166
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:49,467
I can't-- I can't
believe this.

2167
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,736
(Jim)
Hunter is tearing down
the field!

2168
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:58,837
And he kicks
the ball to Jack.

2169
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:02,540
Get over there!
Go, Hunter!

2170
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,313
Jack takes
the ball into the corner.

2171
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:10,547
Whoa! It's a little bit high.

2172
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:12,955
Wait a second,
what's going on?

2173
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:16,762
It's like they're forming
some sort of mega person.

2174
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:21,627
Did everyone see that?

2175
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:23,133
[whooping]

2176
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:27,433
A header by Byong Sun from
Ambrose's shoulder for a goal.

2177
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:29,238
Way to go, Bing Bong!

2178
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:31,370
That's not legal.
Is that legal, ref?

2179
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,038
Great hustle.
Gian Piero and Massimo.

2180
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:34,513
You're back in.
Okay.

2181
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:36,072
But remember,
share the ball.

2182
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:37,243
Okay.
Team.

2183
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,014
Right? Team.
Yeah. Good. Good, good.

2184
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:40,645
Okay, guys.

2185
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:42,683
(Jim)
The Italians are back in.

2186
01:22:42,757 --> 01:22:44,384
And Massimo steals the ball.

2187
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:51,764
Less than
a minute left to play.

2188
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,529
The Gladiators are
completely out of sync here.

2189
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:59,800
And the ball goes
to Ambrose who fakes.

2190
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:02,843
Watch it! It's a trap!
Stay with the ltalians!

2191
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:04,640
(Barbara)
Come on, Sam!

2192
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:11,275
You're gonna have to
get past old,
uncle Bucky for this one.

2193
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:14,718
Here's something
your dad never taught you.

2194

[all cheering]

2195
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:41,210
Goal!

2196
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:45,108
[referee whistling]

2197
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:48,950
And you can
put it on the board.

2198
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:50,856
[blowing whistle]

2199
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:52,488
That's the game!

2200
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,495
Tigers win! Tigers win!

2201
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:59,162
(Phil)
Way to go, guys!

2202
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,529
(Tom)
Nice job, everyone!

2203
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:03,826

2204
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:07,531

Come on, honey!

2205
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:11,469
(Phil)
Sammy!

2206
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,350
Where did you learn
to move like that, Sam?

2207
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:18,477
I practiced every time
you benched me.

2208
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,616
(boys)
Tigers! Tigers!

2209
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:26,685
[boys chanting]

2210
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:31,826
Great game, Bucky.

2211
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,231
A hell of a game, bro.

2212
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:34,700
I guess we really
got out-coached.

2213
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:35,929
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

2214
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:36,936
And I'm serious.

2215
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:38,336
I don't give
compliments lightly.

2216
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:39,600
This is from the heart.

2217
01:24:39,674 --> 01:24:41,141
I'm not blowing
smoke up my butt.

2218
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:42,642
I think you mean
smoke up my butt.

2219
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:44,143
No. Dude,
just take the compliment.

2220
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:45,577
You got it.

2221
01:24:46,314 --> 01:24:47,474
I'll see you later.

2222
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:48,675
See you at the barbecue.

Good job.

Sorry, Grandpa.

What, are you kiddin' me?

2227
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:00,719
If anyone's gonna beat me,
I'm glad it was you.

2228
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,260
Great goal, Samson.

2229
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:03,728
So, you're not mad?

2230
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:05,629
The only thing
that makes me mad

2231
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,601
is that I let you get away
from the Gladiators, okay?

2232
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:09,659
[chuckles]

2233

I'll never be mad at you.
Never.

01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,014
This one needs
to be turned. Okay?

2237
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:22,049
Looks good to me.

2238
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,084
You'll learn.

2239
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:24,209
[machine humming]

2240
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,150
Hey, Ditka!
Knock it off, would you?

2241
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:27,518
Would you knock it off?

2242
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:28,886
Dad, relax.
Here, I'll handle it.

2243
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:29,946
Yeah.

2244
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:30,991
I'll talk to him.

2245
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:34,693
Hey, Buck.
Yeah?

2246
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:36,753
Remember when we beat you
in the championship?

2247
01:25:36,831 --> 01:25:37,855
Yeah.

2248
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:40,924
Remember when, uh, when
I shoved that kid in the pool?

2249
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:42,024
Whoa!

2250
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:44,632
[gasping]

2251
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:48,268
Okay, Buck.
You got me good, buddy.

2252
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:49,310
Yeah.

2253
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:50,605
How do you want
your hamburger?

2254
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:51,838
Well done. Thanks, Buck.

2255
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:53,540
Okay. You got it.

2256
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,707
Hey, coach!

2257
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,078
Yeah?

2258
01:25:58,753 --> 01:25:59,981
Hey.

2259
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:01,750
Hey.

2260
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:05,186
Um, I don't know if you heard,
we won the championship.

2261
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:06,284
Yeah, I heard.

2262
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:07,419
Yeah.

2263
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:10,225
Look, I just wanna say
I'm sorry for the way I acted.

2264
01:26:10,298 --> 01:26:11,560
Hey, let me
tell you something.

2265
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:12,930
You were
a ravin' maniac.

2266
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,026
Yes, I was.
I was a maniac.

2267
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:17,195
Yeah, but I see you
changed your ways.

2268
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:18,665
And man,
down the stretch,

2269
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,674
you did one great job
of coaching those kids.

2270
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:24,643
Thank you. It means a lot.

2271
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,704
So, can I count on
you for next year?

2272
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:28,009
No.

2273
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:31,779
Okay. But you and l,
we're good?

2274
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,109
We're good.

2275
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,348
Good.

2276
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:35,787
How about you
and your old man?

2277
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:37,188
Better. Yeah.

2278
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:40,794
Listen. I mean no disrespect
to you and your family.

2279
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:42,928
But my job in life is

2280
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:45,192
to make your dad's life
a living hell.

2281
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,128
Hey, do what you gotta do.

2282
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,191
I gotta do it.

2283
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:50,328
I'm about to make
good on that Pele bet.

2284
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:51,667
You wanna come
over and watch?

2285
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:53,070
Yeah, I'd love to
but I gotta get

2286
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:55,541
all these leaves over in
that yard before nightfall.

2287
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:57,701
Right.

2288
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:06,317
We had a bet.
You won fair and square.

2289
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:07,820
Good job.

2290
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:10,482
Yes.
Thank you.

2291
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:14,754
I don't say this enough

2292
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:17,263
but you really stepped up.

2293
01:27:17,332 --> 01:27:18,492
I'm proud of you, Son.

2294
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:20,195
I appreciate that.

Yep.

I'm actually
touching it.

2298
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:25,928
Take good care of it.

2299
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:28,373
That means an awful
lot to me, that ball.

2300
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:31,035
It does,
doesn't it?

2301
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:32,238
Yeah.

2302
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:36,709
Here.

2303
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:37,716
What?

2304
01:27:37,785 --> 01:27:38,911
You keep it.

2305
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:42,417
No. You won fair and square.
It's yours now.

2306
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:43,479
No.

2307
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:44,650
You beat me, Philly.

2308
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:46,455
Well, the Tigers
beat you.

2309
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:48,726
I mean I had a good time
kicking your butt,

2310

I'm not gonna lie,

2311

about winning.

is just a metaphor

2315
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:01,272
about the distance
between us.

2316
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:02,468
It's a soccer ball.

2317

No, no, no, Dad.

2318

I-l-It's not
about the ball.

2319
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:07,110
It was never
about the ball.

2320
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:09,140
I don't want the ball.

2321
