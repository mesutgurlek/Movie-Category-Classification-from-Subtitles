You scored yourself a
nice corner. Good job.

00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:57,671
Hi. I'm Maura Ellis.

4
00:00:57,673 --> 00:00:59,772
I'm not part of a
religious group or anything.

5
00:00:59,774 --> 00:01:03,143
I'm just a nurse who likes
to give back on her days off.

6
00:01:03,145 --> 00:01:05,112
You know, when you're living outdoors,

7
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:06,946
skin cancer is a real concern.

8
00:01:06,948 --> 00:01:08,714
So I got you some sunscreen,

9
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:11,550
and you, my friend, have
some irregular moles.

10
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:13,452
You're a very friendly person.

11
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:15,755
Wanna come to my house and take a shower?

12
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:17,023
Maybe make a list of goals?

13
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:18,824
Oh, I have a girlfriend.

14
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:20,860
Great. It's important to have
a lady out there in the street.

15
00:01:20,862 --> 00:01:23,529
What do you call it, a
road bitch or something?

16
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:24,663
Her name's Karen.

17
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:26,732
Your little mama? Your street wife?

18
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:27,901
(SIGHS) Anyway,

19
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:29,403
I'm pretty good with sayings,

20
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:33,874
so I make these cards for my sister,
but I think maybe you could use one.

21
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:37,109
Without the dark night, we
would never see the bright stars.

22
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:38,412
Is this from <i>Twilight?</i>

23
00:01:38,414 --> 00:01:39,478
No, I made it up.

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,880
Mmm, no, you didn't.

25
00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:41,948
Yeah, I did.

26
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,817
See you later.

27
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:44,918
Wait.

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,485
Wait a minute.

29
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:47,720
Hey!

30
00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:49,156
You're not homeless?

31
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:50,589
You were on a roll.

32
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:51,991
Well, give me back the sunscreen

33
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:53,993
so I can give it to an
actual homeless person!

34
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:55,162
Like this lady.

35
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:58,865
Fuck off! I'm the manager here.

36
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:00,736

Can you guys both sit in front

so that I can see you and

blow it is they color your hair

- Hmm.

84

Good for you, because ladies
your age are gross, right?

89
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,234
Well, I just hope it looks
natural. It smells very strong.

90
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:17,870
No. It's super gentle. They
use it on pageant babies.

I stopped growing a long time ago.

Please don't tell me
you quit your job again.

I didn't quit! All right.

You know that dipshit
lady on Channel Eleven

110
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:58,010
who does the segments
where she tries new things?

111
00:04:58,012 --> 00:05:00,312
- Yeah. Go on.
- Well, she wanted bangs,

112
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:02,949
but then afterwards she decided
that she didn't want bangs.

113
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:04,817
And my manager started bitching me out,

114
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:07,320
so I shoved him and his
American Girl Doll glasses broke.

115
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:08,788
Okay. So you got fired.

116
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,690
Why do you keep doing this, Mom?

117
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:13,093
You wanna have a cereal party?

118
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:16,997
No, I don't. I want you to be
responsible so that I don't have to be.

119
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,365
It is too stressful

120
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:21,901
sleeping with you on a pull-out
couch in your friend's dining room.

121
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:23,836
She is not my friend. She was our bug man.

122
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:26,238
I need to learn to be more irresponsible

123

otherwise I'm going to be
hazed so bad in college.

- I'm gonna stay at Annie's house again.
- All right.

126
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,781
Okay, that's a lie because Annie
is in Italy with her family.

127
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:37,117
I know how to use Facebook.

128
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:40,019
I will keep sending you pictures
so that you know that I'm safe.

129
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:42,122
No. You cannot just leave again
and not tell me where you are.

130
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:44,390
You know why I don't
tell you where I'm going?

131
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:47,360
Because you'll show up there and
you'll make a big scene like a hothead!

132
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:50,130
I am not a hothead! I am brassy.

133
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:53,433
I love you, Mom, but your life
is just too chaotic right now.

134
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:55,570
- It is not chaotic.
- DANA: Kate!

135
00:05:57,238 --> 00:05:58,772
Is this your waxing strip?

136

I don't know, Dana. It must be a client's.

137
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,743
My dog had this in his feces.

138
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:05,211
- (WHIMPERS)
- And before I could stop him

139
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:08,914
he ate the poop with the
waxing strip in it again.

140
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,117
- And then he threw that up.
- Okay.

141
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:13,920
You know how many times a day
I kiss that dog on the mouth?

142
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:15,387
An unsettling amount.

143
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:17,423
Now when I kiss him,

144
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:20,293
I'm gonna picture that he ate

145
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:22,995
some stranger's pubes.

146
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:25,231
And it's gonna affect
my relationship with him.

147
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:26,800
KATE: Oh, boy.

148
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:28,067
All right. Let's bring
this in for a landing, Dana.

149
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:29,902

up, and we will talk about this.

158
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:48,921
Hey, it's me.

159
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:51,724
Hello? This is very unprofessional.

160
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:53,325
Hey. I can't talk right now.

161
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:54,793
Real quick. Mom and Dad called.

162
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:56,128
Ugh, what now?

163
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,997
What's up? Everything all right?

164
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:01,200
- No, I don't need lotion in there.
- (SHUSHES)

165
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:02,836
Yeah, you do need lotion in there.

166
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:04,771
Hey, here's something fun.

167
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:07,005
Mom and Dad want us to come down.

168
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,743
<i>They need us to clear out
some of our old bedroom stuff.</i>

169

they wanna get a treadmill.</i>

can't even sit right on a couch.

- I'm just gonna shape them real quick.
- All right.

173
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,358
Yeah, no. I can't afford to
come to Orlando right now.

174
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,327
Well, I'll send you money for the flight.

Hey. Could I get a small glass of tequila?

183
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:02,495
Like a shot of tequila?

184
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:05,197
Yeah, a shot. Just keeping it classy.

- No.

I look like a dead deer
bloated on the highway.

194
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:24,082
No. You look like a pretty
deer who's still alive.

00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:25,819
- Mmm.
- But also, just recently hit.

Oh, I got a whole intricate sewn-in

Okay, well, you have to be
careful when you get fake hair

200
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,131
because some countries give
their young girls chicken hormones

201

Hey, honey. I'm sure you're out having fun

You've been divorced for two years.

a job or a place to live?

I got an idea that's gonna solve
everything. Haley's gonna flip.

What's your idea?

Hi, Dave. I'm Maura, Kate's younger sister.

I held your mullet back one time

- And then swatting it away.
- Isn't it?

Sometimes it stays out
there. Where you put it.

And then sometimes it
goes right into the trash.

So that's, like, a no. I understand.

I just assumed you were missing.

617
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:54,085
And you? What are you up to? Nothing?

618
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:56,153
What are you buying? Stool softener?

619
00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:58,422
No. Actually, um, Diet Coke.

620
00:27:58,424 --> 00:28:00,624
Don't you look great. That's a snazzy belt.

621
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:02,361
Oh, thank you!

622
00:28:02,363 --> 00:28:05,296
Yeah, congrats on your
wrestling championship.

623
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:06,465
It's Ralph Lauren.

624
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:08,499
- Is that how you say it?
- Uh, yeah.

625
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:10,001
Do you get good Wi-Fi with that?

626
00:28:10,003 --> 00:28:12,170
So I see you're having a party.

627
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:13,572
I mean, we're just kind of picking...

628
00:28:13,574 --> 00:28:15,172
- Yep. Having a party.
- Yeah.

629
00:28:15,174 --> 00:28:17,342
I heard you were having a party.

630
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:19,745
From someone who got invited.

631
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:22,646
You were on our list, but
you're very hard to track down.

632
00:28:22,648 --> 00:28:24,048
MAURA: Are you on email?

633
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,551
Uh, it's
B-dot-rinda...

634
00:28:26,553 --> 00:28:29,187
That's what I did wrong. I forgot the dot.

635
00:28:29,189 --> 00:28:30,488
- And we forgot to type it.
- (STAMMERING)

636
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,490
And also we didn't send it.

637
00:28:32,492 --> 00:28:34,226
(CHUCKLES) I must admit,

638
00:28:34,228 --> 00:28:36,193
when I heard you were
having an Ellis Island party

639
00:28:36,195 --> 00:28:38,497
I was like, "What? What year is it?"

640
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:41,099
It's pretty sad.

641
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:43,837
You know, because it's
such a desperate event.

642
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:47,874
(LAUGHS) Bye.

643
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:51,410
You're a desperate event!

644
00:28:51,412 --> 00:28:53,077
I can still hear you!

645
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,546
KATE: Good. Can you hear this?

646
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:56,248
Suck a fucking bag of dicks!

647
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,482
She can't hear that.

648
00:28:57,484 --> 00:29:00,117
KATE: Strutting around Big
Lots like it's Bloomingdale's

649
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,553
in her bullshit shoes.

650
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:04,389
Real estate bitch acting like Suze Orman.

651
00:29:04,391 --> 00:29:06,824
You know what she has?
Crabs in her eyebrows.

652
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:09,193
Tumbleweeds rolling across her beav.

653
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:12,229
I am done wasting words on that ho.

654
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:15,400
- I'm sorry, Vicky.
- Don't apologize for me.

655
00:29:15,402 --> 00:29:18,103
Is Vicky your real name?

656
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:20,074
What's your Korean name?

657
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:24,776
(WHISPERS) Hae-Won.

658
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:27,746
Hae-Won. What a beautiful
name. What does that mean?

659
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:29,280
Hae-Won mean "head."

660
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:31,716
Oh.

661
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:34,652
Hae-Won? Am I saying it correctly?

662
00:29:34,654 --> 00:29:35,853
Hae-Won.

663
00:29:35,855 --> 00:29:37,622
Oh, Hae-Won.

664
00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:39,757
No. Hae-Won.

665
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:41,226
Hae-Won.

666
00:29:41,228 --> 00:29:44,362
Not Hae-Won.
Hae-Won.

667
00:29:44,364 --> 00:29:46,698
- Hae-Won.
- No. Hae-Won.

668
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,632
- Hae-Won.
- Hae-Won.

669
00:29:48,634 --> 00:29:51,402
- Hae-Won.
- Hae-Won.

670
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:53,572
I feel like I'm saying it right. No?

671
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:56,440
I'm too high. (DEEP
VOICE) Hae-Hae-Won.

672
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:58,209
Yes.

673
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:59,744
It's not coming out right, but I'll get it.

674
00:29:59,746 --> 00:30:02,581
Like, "I'm having fun at party."

675
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:05,784
"Hey." Plus "one."

676
00:30:05,786 --> 00:30:08,786
Hey one.

677
00:30:08,788 --> 00:30:10,455
- So you like parties.
- HAE-WON: Yes.

678
00:30:10,457 --> 00:30:11,555
Hmm.

679
00:30:11,557 --> 00:30:14,325
- Your name?
- Oh, my name is Maura.

680
00:30:14,327 --> 00:30:15,794
Maura.

681
00:30:15,796 --> 00:30:17,295
Watch me. Maura.

682
00:30:17,297 --> 00:30:18,763
(GROWLING) Maura.

683
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:21,399
I don't open my mouth like
that. (CHUCKLES) Just, Maura.

684
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:22,633
Maura.

685
00:30:22,635 --> 00:30:24,803
It's not Maura.

686
00:30:24,805 --> 00:30:27,439
You see the difference in my mouth? Maura.

687
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:28,640
(GROWLING) Maura.

688
00:30:28,642 --> 00:30:30,142
We have different mouths.

689
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,045
It's okay.

690
00:30:34,647 --> 00:30:38,549
Why do they always have to give
them American names? It's so sad.

691
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:41,686
I bet Nail Pimp Daddy over there
treats them like his whores.

692
00:30:41,688 --> 00:30:43,889
- We need to get Lucy Liu to go under...
- Lisa Ling.

693
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:47,292
Lisa Ling to go undercover and
investigate these dirty-ass nail salons.

694
00:30:47,294 --> 00:30:50,761
But they are hiring and you
are licensed to do nails.

695
00:30:50,763 --> 00:30:53,797
I don't wanna work here. They
have a bass in their aquarium.

696
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:56,601
It's beautiful here.
Everything smells like lavender.

697
00:30:56,603 --> 00:30:58,937
Plus, you could teach them a
lot, because you know your shit.

698
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:00,771
I do know my shit.

699
00:31:00,773 --> 00:31:03,509
I could French manicure a
chicken while it was running away.

700
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,878
Guess I could get something
better once we're settled, right?

701
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,382
Exactly! And then just wait
until you get that better job

702
00:31:10,384 --> 00:31:12,717
before you quit this one.

703
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:15,421
I'm open to new ways.

704
00:31:16,957 --> 00:31:18,957
(SIGHS) So, do you like working here?

705
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:21,061
I love it.

706
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:23,827
Do you get proper lunch breaks?

707
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:25,963
What is lunch?

708
00:31:25,965 --> 00:31:28,199
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

709
00:31:28,201 --> 00:31:29,567
Hey.

710
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:31,569
Thank you so much for
this. This is a great place.

711
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:32,873
NAIL SALON OWNER: Of course.

712
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:38,045
So, uh, I see you're hiring.

713
00:31:39,946 --> 00:31:42,948
Oh, we are not hiring right now.

714
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,683
You just got a big old sign.

715
00:31:45,685 --> 00:31:49,554
Hey, Hae-Won. Would you like
to come to a party tonight?

716
00:31:49,556 --> 00:31:51,555
You and your friends come, okay?

717
00:31:51,557 --> 00:31:52,958
To do nail?

718
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,427
Oh, no. No, no, no. Party?

719
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:56,728
You can bring whoever you want.

720
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,264
Party, yes.

721
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:01,665
- Sojus.
- Jews.

722
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:04,001
- Soju there?
- Sure. There'll be Jews there.

723
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:07,271
I love jus. Koreans love jus.

724
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:08,440
Koreans love Jews.

725
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:10,307
- I love jus.
- I love Jews, too.

726
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:11,543
Jus.

727
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:14,511
Adam is thinking of coming,
and Gabe is on the fence, so...

728
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:15,613
Soju.

729
00:32:15,615 --> 00:32:18,783
I'm worried we aren't
talking about the same thing.

730
00:32:18,785 --> 00:32:20,719
- Juice. Drinking juice.
- HAE-WON: Jus.

731
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:22,254
You stupid.

732
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:24,689
There'll be juice there. There'll be
food there. There'll be Jews there.

733
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:26,658
- Okay. Yes.
- Great.

734
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,526
Okay, listen. My daughter
and I are moving to Orlando

735
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:31,729
and I really need a job.

736
00:32:31,731 --> 00:32:34,066
Oh, no.

737
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:39,770
Okay, look. Just smile and shake
my hand like you gave me a job

738
00:32:39,772 --> 00:32:41,472
and I will text you a picture of my boobs.

739
00:32:41,474 --> 00:32:43,607
Real good ones. High and happy.

740
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:45,376
No? I misread your deal.

741
00:32:45,378 --> 00:32:46,577
Smile and shake my hand

742
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:48,947
(WHISPERING) or I will text
you a picture of my boobs,

743
00:32:48,949 --> 00:32:50,481
and I know you don't wanna see them.

744
00:32:50,483 --> 00:32:52,383
(CHUCKLES)

745
00:32:52,385 --> 00:32:54,686
Awesome! Thank you, Vicky.

746
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:57,788
I will see you on Monday.

747
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,958
Boom! I got a job.

748
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,994
And look what I pulled out of your
wallet. "Success is desire in action."

749
00:33:02,996 --> 00:33:04,763
Amazing! You're crushing it!

750
00:33:04,765 --> 00:33:06,064
Whoo!

751
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:07,365
KATE: We need to cancel
dinner with Mom and Dad.

752
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:10,468
What if we lie to Mom and Dad
and then they die in their sleep?

753
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,569
Don't let them smell your guilt.

754
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:14,072
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

755
00:33:14,074 --> 00:33:15,472
Girls.

756
00:33:15,474 --> 00:33:17,642
Hey, Mom, we are doing
so much work over there

757
00:33:17,644 --> 00:33:20,478
and doing nothing else,
and I am telling the truth.

758
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
Well.

759
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:26,317
I was just, um, putting the
silverware in the drawers here.

760
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,452
Hey, we can't have dinner tonight.

761
00:33:28,454 --> 00:33:33,591
Yeah, because we're in such packing
mode we don't wanna stop our groove.

762
00:33:33,593 --> 00:33:35,362
Sounds good!

763
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:49,774
Oh.

764
00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:51,609
No. We've...

765
00:33:51,611 --> 00:33:52,977
Okay!

766
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:54,845
- KATE: Bye.
- We're leaving!

767
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:57,015
Did we just cock block our parents?

768
00:33:57,017 --> 00:33:58,682
They were fresh off the sex griddle.

769
00:33:58,684 --> 00:34:00,786
There was so much color in her face.

770
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:05,957
Hey, see you tonight! You know, I'm
laying down a bread base. (CHUCKLES)

771
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:08,125
So I wanna stop by Sam and
Cray's house, real quick.

772
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:09,894
Oh, I haven't seen those
homos since high school!

773
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:11,862
I know.

774
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:13,865
They said that we could borrow those

Go to Costco, get a pan of hot wings.

Get some big, basic salamis.

be the eating of the pussy.

Why?

You've asserted yourself,
and you got a job,

948
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:34,871
so maybe I could give you a loan.

mean the kind you pay back,

or, like, a "wink-wink" loan?

Not in my experience.

But you can do that now
because you have a job.

Okay, wait.

958
00:41:53,259 --> 00:41:56,260
I am going to ask you for
something in return for the money,

959
00:41:56,262 --> 00:41:58,963
and I don't want you to think that
this loan is contingent on that,

960
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:00,965
but I will say that if you don't do it,

961

What do you want to know about me?

1243
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:07,590
I have nachos that are in the broiler.

1244
00:54:07,592 --> 00:54:09,226
I have to go get them.

1245
00:54:09,228 --> 00:54:11,228
Yeah, go. Do your thing. I'll be here.

- All right.
- All right.

What are you doing out here by
yourself? Where's your boyfriend?

1248
00:54:17,635 --> 00:54:19,936
No, I don't think he's
right for me. It's a pass.

1249
00:54:19,938 --> 00:54:22,673
He's so direct, you know.
There's no surprises there.

There's not a lot to discover.

But that's not what life is.

and corners and feeling weird.

be very good friends.

- I'm not.

00:54:44,128 --> 00:54:46,162
I asked him if he saw his parents die.

1260

Oh, Jesus.

1261
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:50,233
- Yeah. I don't like this feeling.
- What feeling?

1262
00:54:50,235 --> 00:54:53,336
This high school feeling when
you're crushing on someone

1263
00:54:53,338 --> 00:54:55,671
and you're afraid that they're
not gonna like you back,

1264
00:54:55,673 --> 00:54:57,074
and then you're gonna get heart cramps.

getting ahead of yourself.

I am straight-up baffled.

a "sad and desperate event"?

Well, I just figured I'd pop
in and say hello to everyone.

but not its contents. Hit it.

We were about to have the
best Ellis Island party ever

1831
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:44,419
because my cousin met John Stamos
at Disney and he was coming.

1832
01:20:44,421 --> 01:20:47,289
But you narced to your cop dad.

1833
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:49,191
I narced because he made me!

1834
01:20:49,193 --> 01:20:51,226
How? How did he even know?

1835
01:20:51,228 --> 01:20:54,495
Because when I found out that
I wasn't invited to your party

1836
01:20:54,497 --> 01:20:58,767
it hurt me so very deep,
that I threw up really hard.

1837
01:20:58,769 --> 01:21:01,337
Why didn't you invite me?

1838
01:21:03,173 --> 01:21:05,540
(SQUEALS) Why?

1839
01:21:05,542 --> 01:21:07,808
I was kind and clean!

1840
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:09,343
And I got mostly B's!

1841
01:21:09,345 --> 01:21:10,611
I know, I cheated off you.

1842
01:21:10,613 --> 01:21:13,482
And then you decided that I was a "no."

1843

And then everybody
decided that I was a "no"!

decided that I was a "no"?

So, I have decided that
tonight I deserve to be here.

1848
01:21:29,533 --> 01:21:33,268
Tonight, I am a "yes."

1849

- I am a "yippie-ki-yay yes"!

And you know what the saddest part is?

1855
01:21:47,952 --> 01:21:49,284
Your vagina?

01:21:49,286 --> 01:21:50,384
No.

1857
01:21:50,386 --> 01:21:52,787
The saddest part

1858
01:21:52,789 --> 01:21:55,691
is that you and I used to
have a blast in grade school.
