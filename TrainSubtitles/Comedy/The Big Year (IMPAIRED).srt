Pitching and tossing.

313
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,714
- Whoa!
- (RETCHING)

314
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,373
You guys got a rag or something?

315
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,643
There we go.

316
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,217
Maybe one with
not so much fish guts on it?

317
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,619
BRAD: You okay?

318
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,558
It's not easy being green.

319
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,095
(LAUGHS)

320
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,491
BRAD: Who knows?

321
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,669
Maybe I never would have met Stu
if he ha dn 't gotten sick that day.

322
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:44,707
Sometimes friendship, like birding,
depends an luck. You blink and you miss it.

323
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,668
Hey, did you get a chance to see
that black-footed albatross?

324
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,107
I sure did. Thanks.

325
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,772
I'll leave you at peace.

326
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,145
No, actually, it helps to talk.

327
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,551
But I wouldn't want you to miss any birds.

328
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,646
Ah! We're headed back.

329
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,953
Besides, if there's anything important,
I'll know

330
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,790
'cause I can recognize them all by ear.

331
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:06,885
No.

332
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,555
- Oh, yeah.
- Really?

333
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,361
(SQUAWKING)

334
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,700
What's that?

335
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,297
That's Bostick imitating a herring gull.

336
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,102
- Splendid!
- Great!

337
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:26,339
Bostick. I have him to thank for this.

338
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:27,979
What do you mean?

339
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,520
He psyched me out. Made me seasick.

340
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,221
I think he thinks I'm doing a Big Year.

341
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,224
That is hardcore.

342
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,189
Are you doing a Big Year?

343
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,127
No. You?

344
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,165
KENNY: Come on, let's speed it up!

345
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,601
The lad inside says there's a suitable hotel
on the 101, halfway to Mount Shasta.

346
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:55,611
Hotel? What, you think a snowy owl's
just gonna wait for us? Uh-uh.

347
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,944
Only reason why I invited you was so
we can drive straight through. Chop, chop!

348
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,311
(TIRES SCREECH)

349
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,352
BRENDA: I can get you
70% off the hotel in Sa vannah,

350
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,548
And I can put you on a direct flight,
but it's $100 more.

351
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,358
Better stay with the two layovers then.

352
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,253
And your dad wants to talk to you.

353
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,327
- No. No, Mom. Mom, no.
- BRENDA: Yeah. Oh!

354
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,489
He's grabbing the phone!

355
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,067
- Yeah. He's grabbing the phone!
- No, no, no, Don't hand it to him,

356
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,034
- Mom? Mom, I don't Want to talk to him,
- Yeah!

357
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,936
Yeah!

358
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,603
Where is our world traveler today?

359
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,136
Oregon. Looking for seabirds.

360
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:31,112
Oregon.
I guess everybody needs a vacation.

361
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,347
It's not a vacation, Dad.

362
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,849
It's not work.

363
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,387
Unless somebody's paying you
to stay in hotels and look at birds.

364
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,253
- D a d!
- Okay, akay, akay, you're right, I'm sorry,

365
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,118
I guess I'm just kind of confused about
what a vacation is.

366
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,188
Okay, Dad, you know what? I gotta run.

367
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,863
Hey. Hey. Brad?

368
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,729
Great talking to you.

Dear God.

00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,350
Probably could have used
another cup of coffee.

(BIRD PECKING)

375
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,239
I think I broke my arm.

376
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,470
(SHUSHING) Shut up.

377
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,946
BRAD: In birding terms,
what Bastick and Fuchs sa W that day

378
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,073
was nothing short of a miracle.

379
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,343
Unbelievable.

380
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,578
This is the rarest bird I've ever seen.

381
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,613
It's like we were meant to crash here.

382
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:21,850
We were.

383
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,858
BRAD: They had survived
a near-fatal crash,

384
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,953
only to stumble upon
a great spotted Woodpecker.

385
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,131
Do you realize how rare that is?

386
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,030
Statistically, in the Pa cifff: North West,

387
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,569
they had a greater chance
of seeing a unicorn.

388
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,772
All of a sudden your arm
doesn't feel so broke, does it?

389
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,398
You could chop my arm off.

390
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:44,672
How's the conference?

391
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,141
How bad could it be?

392
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,244
It's Paris. How's it going there?

393
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:54,753
Glorious! Dawn just broke.
Tamaulipas crows'll be here any minute.

394
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,383
I'm happy for you.
But I wish you were here.

395
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,392
(LAUGHS) You're just jealous.

396
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,263
Mmm. Green.

397
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,057
What was that?

398
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,362
I'm renovating.

399
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,639
Again? I thought we just got done
redoing the whole house.

400
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,471
Uh-huh.
But not the upstairs and the kitchen.

401
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:14,543
Whoa, the kitchen?

402
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,679
I thought we had an agreement that
we were gonna wait on doing the kitchen.

403
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,249
I thought you agreed to wait
to do another Big Year.

404
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,252
Jess, I've told you,
the birds wait for no man.

405
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,377
And neither do I.

406
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,157
Sol had to hire Frank Falucci,
seeing as you're so busy.

407
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,590
You hired my competitor?
That's gonna drag on forever.

408
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,220
Na, 'cause I said to Frank

409
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,162
that I'd give him a bonus
if he was done by April.

410
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,289
A bonus?

411
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,131
All right, but, jeez, babe, please,
you've got to keep an eye on this.

412
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,704
You cannot trust contractors.

413
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,469
I'm well aware, honey.

414
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,604
Okay, so is it old man Frank
in charge of the job,

415
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:51,078
or is it his kind of good-looking' son
who's doing' it?

416
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,445
He's not that good-looking.
Where are you, anyway?

417
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,018
I'm in Wyoming. I get to bag a sage grouse.

- Is it beautiful there?
- No.

419
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,482
It's hot and dusty. it's a real dump.

- Ketchup potato chip?
- No, thank you.

00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:09,859
You want a ketchup potato chip?

No?

You have to handle
the negotiations yourselves.

430
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,580
I told you, I'm done.

431
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,177
The company is your baby, sir,
and it's in trouble.

432
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,915
Yeah, and your baby's
wandered into the street.

433
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,253
- And there are cars coming.
- Your baby needs you, Stu.

434
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,520
Save your baby!

435
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,086
You guys are pathetic.

436
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,267
- Two days. Two.
- That's all we're asking.

437
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,562
- Just till the deal's closed.
- And you'll never hear from us again.

438
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,728
Two days. Then I'm done.

439
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,005
- You got it.
- Two days in New York

440
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,610
- and then you migrate.
- Migrate!

441
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,235
See, you're not the only one
with a sense of humor.

442
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,805
Yes, I am.

443
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,893
Falucci.

444
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:26,803
Long time no see, Bostick.
You remember my kid Frank Jr.

445
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,707
it's a beautiful place you got here, sir.

446
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:30,974
Yeah, it was.

447
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,673
All right, Falucci, I'm gonna be going over
your time sheets like a hawk,

448
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,912
so you might want to
ease up on the snack breaks.

449
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:41,019
Your wife wasn't exaggerating.
Everything with you is birds, Bostick!

450
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:42,949
Yeah, it is.

451
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,489
Jess?

452
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,156
Jess?

453
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:53,692
No. No! What the...

454
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,896
Jess?

455
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,175
- Hello, stranger. This is a rare sighting.
- Hi.

456
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,370
Yeah. What have you done to our house?

457
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,378
- Do you like it so far?
- So far?

458
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:08,014
Please don't tell me there's more to come!
This is crazy!

459
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,980
Are you trying to get my attention?
It worked.

460
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,349
Is that the point of all this?

461
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,922
I don't know. I don't know, Kenny.
What is the point?

462
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,851
I'm surprised to still see
this room standing,

463
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,622
that you didn't take
a sledgehammer to this.

464
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,493
I'm supposed to put
my life on hold for a year?

465
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,490
Like a pathetic golf widow?

466
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:27,331
You're not a golf widow.
You can't compare golf to this.

467
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,802
Golf's just like a hobby.

468
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,101
And the birding is what exactly?

469
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:35,636
I don't know, it's like a calling.
This is like my calling.

470
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,002
Like Gandhi?

471
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:41,676
No, come on.
I'm not comparing myself to Gandhi, okay?

472
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,650
That's ridiculous. Okay?
It's more like I'm Mozart, I guess.

473
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,157
Okay, fine. You got a calling.
I got a calling, too.

474
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,786
- It's known as a baby.
- Yeah.

475
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,833
I know. I like to think that that's like
another one of my callings, too.

476
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,904
And you're gonna have to contribute,
you realize, eventually.

477
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,198
- I realize.
- In person.

478
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:06,274
Yes. In person.
I wouldn't want it any other way.

479
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,402
Really? 'Cause I ain't so sure, Wolfgang.

480
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,209
Maybe I can convince you.

481
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:17,643
I didn't mean now.

482
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,983
Come on. What's the matter with now?

483
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,217
'Cause we have a house full of men.

484
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,793
Just pretend they're not there.

485
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:24,917
(LOUD WHIRRING)

486
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:29,265
Okay, pretend that we don't care
that they're there.

487
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:29,488


488
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:30,799
I'm pretending.

489
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,527
WEATHERMAN ON TV:
throughout much of the South West,

490
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,900
spreading all the Wa y into
the Pa cifff: North Wes t.

491
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,904
Now, for those of you in the Southeast,

492
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,475
Texas Will be experiencing
high Winds this morning,

493
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,044
as this storm moves very quickly south

494
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,612
into the Gulf of Mexico,'a.

495
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,740
If you Te planning to be
anywhere in the Gulf taday,

496
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,374
better batten dawn the hatches.

497
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,386
We are talking about a storm
that may last for 72 hours.

498
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,045
Look at these Weves, these Winds,

499
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,817
- and strong storms.
- Fallout.

500
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,917
- We are talking hurricane-farce Winds.
- Kenny.

501
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,296
I know this is bad. I know this makes me
look like a world-class asshole,

502
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:07,165
- but, babe, I gotta go.
- Kenny! Kenny!

503
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,968
Kenny!

504
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,600
I'll call you!

505
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,251
Bill? Don't say no. I'm going to Texas.
I'm getting on a plane right now.

506
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,951
Texas? You just got back.

507
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:34,322
Bill! There is going to be
major fallout in a few hours.

508
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,922
- Nuclear fallout?
- Bird fallout.

509
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:38,200
What are you talking about?

510
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,295
I'm talking about a major storm
hitting the Gulf of Mexico

511
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,633
in the middle of migration season.

512
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,035
I'm talking about headwinds
and downpours

513
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,837
and a hundred thousand birds
literally dropping from the sky!

514
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,078
I'll put it down as a sick day.

515
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,537
- Stu.
- Hey.

516
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,139
- Where you going?
- Texas.

517
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,914
Texas? Now? What about Mclntire?
How do we explain this?

518
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,081
Act of God.

519
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:04,019
Act of God? No! That's not gonna work!
Stop this car! Stop this car!

520
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,358
Those damn birds!

521
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,364
BRAD: Stu arrived on the outskirts of
Houston

522
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,368
feeling liberated after skipping out an
his meeting in New York.

523
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,529
I really believe I can win this thing.

524
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,904
Bastick, not surprisingly,
was supremely confident.

525
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:22,409
Yes! Yes!
I really think I've got this thing locked up.

526
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:26,205
And I get to admit, I was feeling
that luck was an my side for a change.

527
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,409
I'm starting to think I have a chance.

528
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,548
I had done the math.
I knew what spring fallout meant.

529
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,854
A World record was Within my grasp.

530
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,427
(CLAMORING)

531
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,370
Whoa!

532
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,205
Unbelievable.

533
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,938
Oh, my God.

534
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,383
REPORTER: Faced with that headwind,

535
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,483
they have to come down
at the first land they see,

536
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,824
and that's right here.

537
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,124
One thing's for sure,

538
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,168
today's happening is strictly
for the birds. Gretchen.

539
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,232
Come on, guys, get... Keep it moving!
Come on, we got a lot of birds to see.

540
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,333
Bloody ass. Only Americans can
turn birding into a competition!

541
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,038
That's right.
You don't want to miss this one!

542
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,205
What?

543
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,995
- Brad!
- Stu!

544
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,563
I knew you'd be here. I was looking for you.

545
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,131
- Me, too.
- This is incredible, isn't it?

546
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,198
I know. Where do we even start?

547
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:58,363
There's the best birder in the world.
Maybe we should...

548
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,408
Follow him.

549
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,341
(LET IT SHIIVEPLAYING)

550
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:07,916
(INAUDIBLE)

551
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,087
- STU: Prothonotary Warbler.
- (EXCLAIMING EXCITEDLY)

552
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,696
Gotcha.

553
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,426
Oh! Blue grosbeak.

554
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,731
It's a buffet.

555
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,168
Sa I play what the kids Wanna hear

556
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,173
While I spange on Broadway

557
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,744
Shine, let it shine

558
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,906
Even if it bums your eyes

559
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,176
This fight of mine is mine

560
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,616
And I'm gonna let it shine...

561
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,851
Ever get the feeling you're being followed?

562
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,650
- Hello, master.
- How you doing, Stu?

563
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,724
Still filling those weekends, I see.

564
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,817
Unless you and your son here
are doing a Big Year.

565
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:58,296
(CHUCKLES) Oh! Kenny Bostick,
this is my friend Brad Harris.

566
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,891
Who's also not doing a Big Year.

567
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,671
That's funny how
nobody's doing a Big Year.

568
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,001
Yeah. With all this fallout and El Nino.

569
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,202
Yeah, I know, you'd think
the conditions are just set up perfect

570
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,279
for someone to have a real shot at
breaking my record.

571
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,747
- Not that record.
- Pink-footed goose!

572
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,913
Pink-footed goose,
other end of the boardwalk.

573
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,584
- What the hell's that doing here?
- MAN: Be careful!

574
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,785
Hey, put her down!

575
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,531
Hey, hey, please, let the explorers through!

576
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,930
- Of course.
- Let's go, ladies. Jeesh.

577
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,226
After you, kids.

578
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,731
Get those badges.

579
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,064
Chop, chop, chop, chop!
Step it up! Stepping lively!

580
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,941
Move it along!

581
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,344
Thank you.

582
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,546
She took off. Headed north.
Probably be in Iceland by Friday.

583
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,591
Boy, she was a beaut, too!

584
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,355
Hey, is that a Calliope?

585
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,450
Nah.

586
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,258
Sorry to disappoint you boys again.

587
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,934
Good evening. Tonight's special is quail.
I highly recommend it.

588
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,273
- I couldn't.
- Yeah, not tonight.

589
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,474
I'll have the halibut.

590
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,608
And a bottle of this Montrachet.

591
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:23,777
Of course.

592
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,981
And I will have the soup. Thank you.

593
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,721
Really? After being outside all day
in the wind and rain?

594
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:34,825
Kind of a light eater.

595
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,121
And the truth is

596
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,167
the prices here are
a little steeper than I'm used to.

597
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:44,105
- Brad, I invited you to dinner.
- I know, but...

598
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,072
No, it's my pleasure.

599
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,805
Look, when I'm birding,
I don't fly first class or hire guides.

600
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:53,007
It's too much like corked bats
and steroids to me.

601
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:57,014
But tonight we're celebrating.

602
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,783
We saw 136 species!

603
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,325
Brad, 136!

604
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:04,449
Here's to them.

605
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,056
And to the one who got away.

606
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,252
Pink-footed goose.

607
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,725
The Montrachet.

608
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,597
Good. And my friend would like to
see the menu again, please.

609
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,194
WAITER: Of course.

610
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,368
Cool.

611
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:22,377
That shrimp scampi was calling my name,
if you must know.

612
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,242
- That's a little too much.
- Okay.

613
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,673
BRAD: By the end of the meal
I felt like I 'd known Stu for years.

614
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,809
It was rare to meet a birder
as absessed as I Was.

615
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,923
And even rarer to meet one
who could pa y for dinner.

616
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,654
I mean, I'm 36.

617
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,521
I'm divorced.

618
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,921
I have a job I hate.

619
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,663
I just want to do something big, you know?
Make my mark.

620
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,262
So what are you gonna do?

621
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,237
I'm working on something.
(EXCLAIMS DISMISSIVELY)

622
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,039
My dad doesn't get it.

623
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,771
He's had the same boring job for 40 years.

"That's what people do," he says.

625
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,810
He's right.

626
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,752
Most people just stay on the beaten path,
then one day,

627
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:07,516
they wake up and realize they didn't do
everything they wanted to do.

628
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,526
Look at me. I was so afraid to retire,

629
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,652
I had to do it twice
before I finally got out here.

630
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,155
Why'd you wait so long?

631
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,129
'Cause I'm an idiot.

632
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,065
Okay, I gotta tell you.

633
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,766
I'm doing a Big Year.

634
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:27,567
Wow.

635
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,272
I know.

636
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,476
BRAD: I don't know
what ma de me blurt it out like that.

637
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,711
Confidence? Innocence? Alcohol?

638
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,946
If just never occurred to me
that Stu might be doing' his own Big' Year,

639
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,386
Don't tell anybody, okay?

640
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,892
I guess I just assumed he'd be honest,

641
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,589
Iguess I just assumed
honor and decency Wauld prevail.

642
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,361
I guess I just assumed We were friends.

643
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,729
Mum's the word.

644
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,799
- We won't have to eat for a week.
- I'm hurting.

645
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,498
Great dinner.

646
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,706
Good luck.

647
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,315
Thanks again.

The fallout's over and now I'm calling
to deal with the fallout from the fallout.

651
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,555
Look, babe, I'm sorry,
I'm gonna make it up to you, you 'll see,

652
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:22,224
I'm going ta...

Where are you, anyway? It's late there.

654
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,126
- I hope you Te aka y, babe.
- Oh! Where am I?

655
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:30,502
I'm shooting hormones into my butt
so I can have your baby, Kenny.

656
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:34,702
Okay, I'm going to hit the sack here,
but I Will try you in the morning,

657

and I'm gonna be launching a new thing
called Operation Sweep Her Off Her Feet.

'cause it 's gonna be pretty spectacular.

- No.

But I'm afraid
if he knew about my Big Year,

673

Bostick'd get it out of him eventually.

674
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,065
And why is it so important to
keep this secret from Bostick?

675
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,565
Less competition he thinks he has,

676
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:08,228
the more he's likely to throttle back,
not try so hard.

Not grind for the extra birds.
Maybe I could sneak past him.

Hey, Jim.

Yeah, listen, talks broke down.
Deal was dead by 10:00. Over.

Total acrimony, On the Way out the door,

00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:56,210
we agreed to a do-or-die session, May 14th,

694
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,986
here in New York in our offfce.

695
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,520
I can't. Impossible.

- I'm #ying to Attu an the 14th.
- To where?

697
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,253
Attu, Alaska. And I can't miss the flight.
There's not another one for a week.

698
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,327
Stu, you're not involved, the deal dies.

699
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,762
Look, you gave these people their jobs.

700
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,424
If you don't do something,
they're gonna lose them!

than some birds an A ttu.

BRAD: Attu. The Westernmast island
of the Aleutian chain.

703
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:25,673
Sa far West, it's closer to Tokyo
than to Anchorage.

704
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,310
There are no hotels, no phones,
no restaurants, no toilets.

Not the kind that Hush, anyway,

But for birders, A ttu was para diss.

Are you upset because
you think you can't win,

714
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:01,005
- or because he lied to you?
- Both. And what about Bostick?

00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:02,206
Who?

716
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:06,550
Kenny Bostick, the best birder in the world.
I think he might be doing another Big Year.

00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:07,850
What chance do I have?

718
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:12,291
Oh, Brad, you have 486 birds.
You're on a record pace.

there's no way I can complete the year!

This has a $6,000 limit.

723

Bring me back some Alaska pictures.

- No, no, no, no.

If you miss this plane,

729
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,018
there's not another one for a week.

JIM: How was your trip?

- Louisiana was spectacular.
- Lot of birds in the bayou.

737
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:08,246
And saw a loggerhead shrike
from my hotel room in Natchitoches.

738
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,510
Adorable!

739
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,746
It imitates the songs of other birds
to lure them in close.

740
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:12,820
Uh-huh.

741
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,288
Then it impales them on thorns,
breaks their necks and eats them.

742
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,719
Yeesh!

743
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,294
STU: We'll assume the cost of
retrofitting the plants,

744
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,021
but that still leaves
the non-compete clause.

No. it's not a big issue,
but I'm not like you, Stu.

spend the rest of my life bird watching.

00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:39,976
And there's no wiggle room here.
This is a deal-breaker for us.

Wait, what? Wait, wait, wait.

752
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:46,513
Four hours ago, you said
that everything was negotiable.

753
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,352
What, was this just so you could
lure me in to finish me off?

754
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,853
The shrike.

It's 11:15.

All right. Stu!
Just wait, one second, please. One second.

Just give me five minutes. Okay?

Okay, now, Karen,
you're not a birder, are you?

770
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:09,870
No. No, I'm just along for the ride.

That should be unforgettable.
