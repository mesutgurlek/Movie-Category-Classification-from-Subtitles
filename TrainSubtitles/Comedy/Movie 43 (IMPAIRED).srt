00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,614
<i>- Good. Are you on?
- Yeah, we're ready.</i>

2
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,129
<i>My name is Calvin Cutler.</i>

3
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,965
<i>What you're about to witness
is the most badass,</i>

4
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,092
<i>fucked-up thing you'll ever see.</i>

5
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,259
<i>We call this the "Bull's Eye."</i>

6
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,201
<i>Oh, yeah.
Don't try this at home.</i>

7
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:18,235
<i>You're good? You ready, buddy?
All right. Right, ready?</i>

8
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,339
<i>One... two... three!</i>

9
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,086
<i>Tell me we got it. Just...</i>

10
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:32,225
<i>Did we? No! No way, we got it!
No fucking way, dude!</i>

11
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,094
<i>We got it! We got it! We got...
- Oh, shit!</i>

12
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,392
<i>Look at that! Look at that!
Dude. Bull's eye, bro!</i>

13
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,301
<i>Awesome!</i>

14
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,963
<i>We're putting it on You Tube!
Let's go! Yeah!</i>

15
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,262
<i>Dude, we got a view!</i>

16
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,298
<i>Yeah, buddy, that was us
when we uploaded it.</i>

17
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,108
<i>Well, then upload it again
so we can have two views.</i>

18
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,176
<i>I-I don't think that's how it works.</i>

19
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,511
<i>- Hit "refresh," dude.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

20
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,289
<i>- No way.
- That can't be right.</i>

21
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,591
<i>- Do me a favour.
- I just refreshed it.</i>

22
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,956
<i>Let's see if it pulls up.</i>

23
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:10,525
<i>No way. Twenty-five thousand
views, man!</i>

24
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,159
<i>Five hundred thousand!</i>

25
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,227
<i>- One million? Yes!
- You're too money!</i>

26
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,205
<i>- I told you we're going to be famous.
- We're going to be famous and...</i>

27
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,196
<i>April fools, suckers!</i>

28
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:26,146
<i>I took the liberty of cloning You Tube
and hyper-inflating your Views.</i>

29
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,545
<i>...You... You little shit!</i>

30
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,550
<i>Did you just try to hit me
through your computer screen?</i>

31
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,651
<i>Yeah, I did!</i>

32
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,245
<i>Why don't you come in here so
I can hit you like a real man, pussy!</i>

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,312
<i>Working on my science project.
Enjoy your page Views.</i>

34
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,286
<i>God, he's such a little spaz!</i>

35
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,961
<i>- We need revenge.
- We do.</i>

36
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:45,131
<i>- We need to April fools prank him.
- Yeah!</i>

37
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,233
<i>- Hit him where it hurts.
- Square in his balls.</i>

38
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,035
<i>No! We got to do
something better.</i>

39
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:52,163
<i>We steal his computer
and load it full of viruses.</i>

40
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,241
<i>- Wait, where do we get viruses?
- Uh, duh! Porn sites.</i>

41
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,210
<i>Hy do you think my computer's
so slow? Lt's full of 'em.</i>

42
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,214
<i>Oh, okay, but how-how do we get
his laptop if it's in his room?</i>

43
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,550
<i>We can't just-just kick
in the door and steal it.</i>

44
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,280
<i>How do you lure a dragon
out of a lion's den?</i>

45
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,319
<i>I don't know.</i>

46
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,557
<i>- You present him with a challenge.
- Challenge?</i>

47
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,354
<i>A challenge. Jus... Follow my lead.</i>

48
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:16,290
<i>- Baxter! Baxter, my man!
- What?</i>

49
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:20,421
<i>Uh, me and J.J., we have
this computer problem.</i>

50
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:25,436
<i>There's this movie on
the Internet and we can't find it.</i>

51
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,073
<i>Can you help us?</i>

52
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,337
<i>You're trying to get back
at me for that prank, right?</i>

53
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,479
<i>No! Truce! Truce.
Seriously, we just, uh...</i>

54
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,849
<i>we need to find it, uh,
before the FBI takes it down.</i>

55
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,353
<i>You said the FBI?</i>

56
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:44,424
<i>- Fucking FBI, the CIA...
- The CSI, NCIS...</i>

57
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,492
<i>I mean, this video is so illegal,</i>

58
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,188
<i>it has been banned
by every country in the world.</i>

59
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,396
<i>Including Amsterdam.</i>

60
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,498
<i>Where you could slap a cop
in the face with your penis,</i>

61
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,897
<i>and they'd say, "Danka."</i>

62
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,559
<i>Amsterdam is not a country!</i>

63
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,304
<i>- Amsterdam's not a country?
- Since when?</i>

64
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,373
<i>The shit's still banned there, dude.</i>

65
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,240
<i>Yeah. Think about it. They... it’s-
It's like it's the-the-the fucking...</i>

66
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,279
<i>It's the most dangerous
film in the world.</i>

67
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,541
<i>- It is.
- What's it called?</i>

68
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,286
<i>Actually, you know what,
Baxter? You're right.</i>

69
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,083
<i>It was an April Fool's prank.</i>

70
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,490
<i>I'm sorry we brought you into this.</i>

71
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,525
<i>You know, you should probably just...</i>

72
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,595
<i>go on with your life and never
think about this again. Please.</i>

73
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,619
<i>Wait.</i>

74
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,262
<i>- What's so bad about it?
- You don't want to know.</i>

75
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,595
<i>What's so bad about it?</i>

76
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,439
<i>Hey, slim!
What's so bad about it?</i>

77
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,236
<i>- It can kill you.
- How?</i>

78
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,311
<i>Lt can make you shit out
your intestines.</i>

79
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,280
<i>It can make you bleed
out of your eyes.</i>

80
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,048
<i>You know, one guy saw it,</i>

81
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,218
<i>and he ran into a church, and
he just started humping the nuns.</i>

82
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,220
<i>That was a huge story
a few years back.</i>

83
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,055
<i>It can make you pull off
your own dick.</i>

84
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,657
<i>Okay, why would you
want to watch it...</i>

85
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,258
<i>if it can make you pull off
your own dick?</i>

86
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,282
<i>Because...</i>

87
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:57,987
<i>if you can watch it all the way
through from the beginning to end,</i>

88
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,128
<i>you're rewarded beyond
your wildest dreams.</i>

89
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:07,332
<i>With money. And sex.
And women.</i>

90
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,269
<i>It's like that movie The Ring,
but with a good ending.</i>

91
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,277
<i>- Yeah. And boobs.
- Lots of boobs.</i>

92
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,982
<i>So what's this movie called?</i>

93
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,279
<i>Movie.</i>

94
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,414
<i>- Forty-three.
- Movie forty-three.</i>

95
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,287
<i>It's not on Zwoogle.</i>

96
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,627
<i>Yeah, of course it's not
on Zwoogle. It's banned!</i>

97
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:35,234
<i>Okay. Then I guess
we'll need to dig deeper.</i>

98
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,429
<i>Visit some dark corners
of the Internet.</i>

99
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,473
<i>Mm, yeah, the dark
corners, dude.</i>

100
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,270
<i>Yeah, get in there.
We got to find this thing.</i>

101
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,378
<i>I found a cloaked server
that houses banned videos.</i>

102
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,414
<i>Start out with the forty-third one
on the list. Sound good?</i>

103
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,050
<i>Yes! Yeah, you guys keep
working on this.</i>

104
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,587
<i>I'm going to go guard the door
for the uh, FBI,</i>

105
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,521
<i>the CIA, and Mom.</i>

106
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,118
<i>Look at this. Check it out.</i>

107
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,322
<i>Hey. Ooh! You look good.</i>

108
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,665
<i>Hope you're almost ready.
He's going to be here any second.</i>

109
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,468
<i>I don't know why I'm doing this,
Pam. I don't trust Julie.</i>

110
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:12,105
<i>- I mean, what if this guy's a loser?
- He's not a loser.</i>

111
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,973
<i>He made senior partner at his law
firm by the time he was,</i>

112
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,065
<i>like, twenty-eight.</i>

113
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,472
<i>So all he cares about is
his career and money.</i>

114
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,514
<i>Mm, not according to Julie. He's a
volunteer with the Special Olympics,</i>

115
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,414
<i>he's on the board of
the New York Philharmonic...</i>

116
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,540
<i>He's opening a new restaurant
with Derek Jeter!</i>

117
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,688
<i>But he's probably got one of those
awkward character faces...</i>

118
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,179
<i>that sort of really has
to grow on you, right?</i>

119
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:36,189
<i>Mr. "Character Face" is on
the cover of Gotham Magazine.</i>

120
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,397
<i>- That's him?
- That's him.</i>

121
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,391
<i>Yeah.</i>

122
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,408
<i>And he's here. Go.</i>

123
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,942
<i>- Do I look okay?
- Gorgeous.</i>

124
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,177
<i>- You sure?
- Have fun!</i>

125
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,303
<i>Bye!</i>

126
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,651
<i>- I mean, you got to be kidding.
- Several of them.</i>

127
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,988
<i>I'm telling you, don't knock
shopping on TV until you've tried it.</i>

128
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,656
<i>Beth, I think-I think you're
the first person I've ever met...</i>

129
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,024
<i>who actually buys
stuff off television.</i>

130
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,150
<i>- No! Come on!
- No, it's true.</i>

131
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,428
<i>Oh, well where do you think
I got this scarf?</i>

132
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,264
<i>And you know what?
I bet it's softer than yours.</i>

133
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,166
<i>Okay. See, that's where
I draw the line.</i>

134
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,967
<i>Do not start putting down the scarf.</i>

135
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,503
<i>Here. Feel this. One-hundred
percent pashmina.</i>

136
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,705
<i>Well, at least that's what
the guy on the street told me.</i>

137
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,608
<i>Come on, then. Wow, that is soft.
Well, you know, l...</i>

138
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,338
<i>Hey, Mr. H. Table's ready, sir.</i>

139
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,536
<i>Great.</i>

140
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,412
<i>- L'll take those.
- Thank you.</i>

141
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,183
<i>- Please.
- Our table's ready.</i>

142
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,150
<i>Thank you.</i>

143
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,342
<i>After you.</i>

144
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:40,223
<i>So, um, Carrie tells me you design
clothes for kids. No?</i>

145
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,553
<i>Yes. Clothes for kids. I design...</i>

146
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,232
<i>clothes... for kids. Kids clothes.</i>

147
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,529
<i>Awesome. Awesome.</i>

148
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,593
<i>So, if I see some kids looking weird
this summer, it may be your fault, huh?</i>

149
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,964
<i>I'm just joking. I'm just joking.</i>

150
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,977
<i>Your Russian Standard Vodka, sir.</i>

151
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,535
<i>Am I that predictable, Abby?</i>

152
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,449
<i>Eh... Yeah, you good with that? Or would
you prefer a glass of wine or?</i>

153
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,408
<i>No. No, I c-I could, use it.</i>

154
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,579
<i>Thank you.</i>

155
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,182
<i>So, here's to a, Here's to
a wonderful evening. Cheers.</i>

156
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,257
<i>Cheers.</i>

157
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,425
<i>Those Russians know something.</i>

158
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,464
<i>This is... a nice place.</i>

159
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,578
<i>Oh, it's great. This pl...
Oh, you got to check out the ceiling.</i>

160
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,614
<i>Those beams were taken out...</i>

161
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,149
<i>of this old Quaker meetinghouse
out in rural Pennsylvania.</i>

162
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:41,586
<i>I mean, look. It's all oak. Isn't
that something? Lt's gorgeous, huh?</i>

163
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,623
<i>Oh, wow, Jake. What's this?</i>

164
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:48,661
<i>Well, Mr. H, this is a vichyssoise
courtesy of Chef Billy.</i>

165
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,563
<i>Now, he heard that you guys
were coming in tonight,</i>

166
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,266
<i>so he's put together a special
four-course meal for you.</i>

167
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,597
<i>Lobster okay tonight?</i>

168
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,103
<i>That's okay with me
if it's okay with you,</i>

169
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,866
<i>un-unless you want to
check out the menu.</i>

170
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,440
<i>Beth? Unless you want to
check out the menu, or?</i>

171
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,374
<i>- No, that's sounds lovely.
- Right.</i>

172
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,177
<i>Terrific.</i>

173
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,441
<i>Please thank the chef.
Thank you.</i>

174
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,273
<i>Bon Appétit.</i>

175
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,613
<i>Oh, you've, got something on your...</i>

176
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,624
<i>Something on my neck? Leave it to me
to embarrass myself on a first date.</i>

177
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,220
<i>Here...</i>

178
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,566
<i>There? There? I got it?</i>

179
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,136
<i>A little bit... bit more on-on
the left b-ball... One.</i>

180
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,037
<i>Uh, left side. Of...
Dribbly bit. O</i>

181
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:40,913
<i>Thanks. I mean, no biggie. Trust me,
I've been through worse. I mean, as...</i>

182
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,280
<i>As a kid, I used to get made
fun of all the time.</i>

183
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,986
<i>Was it, because of your...</i>

184
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,589
<i>My stutter. I-I used to have
a really bad stutter.</i>

185
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,218
<i>Actually took probably nine years of
speech therapy to get rid of it.</i>

186
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:09,098
<i>So, was there anything else they...
may have made fun of?</i>

187
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,913
<i>- I don't know.
- Anything at all?</i>

188
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,016
<i>Oh, yeah, some kids used to talk
a little smack about my neck.</i>

189
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,075
<i>- You know.
- Oh, thank God!</i>

190
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,955
<i>- What's up?
- I thought I was going crazy. L...</i>

191
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,146
<i>What?</i>

192
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,628
<i>I mean... not a big deal...
at all.</i>

193
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,894
<i>It's just, what is the story there?</i>

194
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,437
<i>Well, when I was six, I fell off my bike
and I landed on a sprinkler head...</i>

195
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,973
<i>and they had to stitch me up
at the hospital.</i>

196
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,407
<i>See, it's, it's just a scar. Right?</i>

197
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:47,003
<i>I mean, kids could be mean.
They used to call me Frankenstein.</i>

198
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:52,477
<i>They're like,
"He's alive. He's alive!"</i>

199
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,186
<i>Well, I don't care, you know.
Kids make fun of everything, right?</i>

200
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,359
<i>Ls it just me or did it suddenly
get a little chilly in here?</i>

201
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,189
<i>I think it may be that vent there.</i>

202
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,971
<i>- Here we are.
- Man! Look at the size of those things.</i>

203
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,974
<i>Oh, Jake, buddy, would you mind
turning up the heat just a tad?</i>

204
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,135
<i>I think that, that vent's blowing
right on... Not a problem.</i>

205
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,011
<i>Thank you.</i>

206
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,312
<i>And, uh, just let me go ahead and...</i>

207
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,648
<i>- Sure.
- Get this out of your way here.</i>

208
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,138
<i>Oh, God! Are you-Are you okay?</i>

209
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,610
<i>Lt's my stomach. There's...</i>

210
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,445
<i>Just get my breath back, you know.</i>

211
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,361
<i>There he is! There's the stud!</i>

212
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,988
<i>Hey! Angie! Ray!</i>

213
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,964
<i>Hey, how the hell are you guys?
You're good?</i>

214
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,591
<i>Apparently not as good as you.</i>

215
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,436
<i>Hi, I'm Angie and this is
my husband Ray.</i>

216
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,272
<i>- Hi.
- This is my new friend, Beth.</i>

217
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,441
<i>She's slowly restoring
my faith in blind dates.</i>

218
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,009
<i>Well, kudos to you, Beth,</i>

219
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,178
<i>for getting this old workaholic
out of his office for once.</i>

220
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,577
<i>Come on. Come on, Ray.</i>

221
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,944
<i>Nice work!
You caught the big one!</i>

222
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,040
<i>Did I?</i>

223
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,920
<i>But... Do you not notice the...</i>

224
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,287
<i>- Look how big little Evan's getting!
- Yeah. Little?</i>

225
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,148
<i>Yeah. He's growing like crazy.</i>

226
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,252
<i>- No.
- Who's a big boy?</i>

227
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,430
<i>Who's a big boy, huh?</i>

228
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,936
<i>Wow, Ray, he's a monster. You got
yourself a little linebacker here.</i>

229
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,305
<i>A little linebacker that needs
to go to bed!</i>

230
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,569
<i>Okay. You're off to bed.
There you go.</i>

231
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,478
<i>- Fumble.
- Another pacifier down.</i>

232
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,604
<i>I got it.</i>

233
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,642
<i>Thanks, buddy. Thanks bud.</i>

234
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,484
<i>Here, bud. Angie?</i>

235
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,052
<i>You guys look so cute.
I got to take a picture.</i>

236
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,041
<i>Really?</i>

237
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,056
<i>- Angie, please.
- Hey, let-let the man eat, honey.</i>

238
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,425
<i>Come on, Ray. We have a picture
of our first date.</i>

239
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,327
<i>They should have a picture of theirs.</i>

240
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,164
<i>Come on, get your fanny over there
behind her and don't be shy.</i>

241
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,501
<i>- All right. Okay, okay. All right.
- Okay.</i>

242
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,332
<i>- I'm sorry about this.
- Get in close.</i>

243
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,027
<i>Beth, I'm going to need
you to hold still.</i>

244
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,074
<i>Oh, God, they look so...</i>

245
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,043
<i>Get down! Get your face down
next to hers! Come on!</i>

246
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,204
<i>Take it. Take it. Take it, take it,
take it, take it.</i>

247
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,876
<i>- So good!
- How's that?</i>

248
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,551
<i>Now why don't you give
each other a little kiss?</i>

249
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,052
<i>Oh, come on.
Angie, we just met.</i>

250
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,088
<i>Come on, let 'em eat!
Let the man eat!</i>

251
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,923
<i>- Come on! Just a little kiss.
- All right, all right.</i>

252
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,325
<i>We'll do one, one kiss
on the forehead.</i>

253
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,326
<i>- One peck on the forehead.
- We don't need to.</i>

254
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,561
<i>- Ready? Okay.
- We really don't.</i>

255
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,926
<i>We don't need...</i>

256
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,292
<i>The fuck, man! Keep looking.</i>

257
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,300
<i>Let's try the forty-second one.</i>

258
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,940
<i>Yeah, yeah, good idea.</i>

259
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,903
<i>Boobs.</i>

260
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,313
<i>Pornography with viruses.</i>

261
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,045
<i>Yeah, Baxter, you're going down.</i>

262
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,955
<i>Keep looking.</i>

263
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,433
<i>It's uh, roast Sumatra.
I grind the beans myself.</i>

264
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,036
<i>Hey, thanks again for dinner.
You really didn't have to do this.</i>

265
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,037
<i>Oh, please.</i>

266
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,438
<i>What kind of neighbours would we be...</i>

267
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,340
<i>if we didn't have you over
for a welcome dinner?</i>

268
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,977
<i>Sean, Samantha was just saying
that they home school their son.</i>

269
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,111
<i>Oh, that is interesting.</i>

270
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,447
<i>Well, we just think it's
the only way to make sure...</i>

271
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,075
<i>that he gets the best
education possible.</i>

272
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,118
<i>You should really consider
it for your kids.</i>

273
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,888
<i>Hey, you know, Kevin's upstairs
doing his homework right now.</i>

274
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,423
<i>I'm sure he'd love to talk
to you guys about it.</i>

275
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:21,052
<i>Wait. He... So you home school your son
but he still gets homework?</i>

276
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,098
<i>Lt's very important to us
that Kevin has...</i>

277
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:29,124
<i>a normal and complete
high school experience.</i>

278
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:36,008
<i>Written assignments are to be done in
black ink. Not green or blue or pink.</i>

279
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:39,000
<i>When are you going to get that through
your thick skull, Mr. Morris?</i>

280
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,003
<i>Lt's Miller.</i>

281
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,141
<i>That's a detention.</i>

282
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,119
<i>Move, move, move, move, move!
Pick it up! Pick it up!</i>

283
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,314
<i>Come on, girlfriend,
pick your knees up!</i>

284
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,458
<i>Oh, I-I see. It's...</i>

285
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:56,462
<i>But don't you feel like maybe he's,
I don't know, missing out?</i>

286
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,031
<i>Yeah, high school is about more
than just classes and homework.</i>

287
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,134
<i>Absolutely. There's
the alienation, the loneliness.</i>

288
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:05,137
<i>It should be the unhappiest
time in a boy's life.</i>

289
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,238
<i>That's why we try to make sure...</i>

290
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,308
<i>that Kevin doesn't miss out
on any of those essential...</i>

291
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:13,005
<i>emotionally scarring experiences
that he'd get at a regular school.</i>

292
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,181
<i>Fag!</i>

293
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,982
<i>Faggot!</i>

294
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,021
<i>You dropped your books, fuckface!</i>

295
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,962
<i>Jesus! Dad, what the fuck!</i>

296
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,466
<i>Whoa. You've got weird pubes.</i>

297
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,594
<i>Hey, guys! Come check out
this kid's weird pubes!</i>

298
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,209
<i>Still, it must be an awful lot
of work for you guys, though.</i>

299
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,146
<i>Oh, sure, there is.
But we love it.</i>

300
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,682
<i>I think we've put together
a pretty comprehensive plan...</i>

301
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:53,209
<i>that provides Kevin with every
important adolescent experience.</i>

302
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,250
<i>You know, socializing
with other kids...</i>

303
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,059
<i>Hey. Kevin, right?</i>

304
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,063
<i>Can I please come in?</i>

305
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,441
<i>Look, Debbie Clark's here,</i>

306
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,342
<i>the girl you asked out before.
It's going to be awkward.</i>

307
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,152
<i>Sorry. No. Sorry, sorry.
No. Sorry. Okay, okay.</i>

308
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,052
<i>Mom. Mom, please no, wait.
Mom, just... lf l...</i>

309
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,224
<i>Extracurricular activities.</i>

310
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,888
<i>What do you do?</i>

311
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:41,929
<i>I suck.</i>

312
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,393
<i>What do you suck?</i>

313
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,039
<i>- Dicks.
- Louder!</i>

314
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,575
<i>- I suck dicks! I suck dicks!
- Like you mean it!</i>

315
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,444
<i>I suck dicks, I suck dicks,
I suck 'em all the time!</i>

316
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,346
<i>Lf you were a superhero,
what would your superpower be?</i>

317
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,582
<i>My superpower would be
sucking dicks!</i>

318
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:00,177
<i>Dude. You have so much
poop on you right now.</i>

319
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,523
<i>And of course the first kiss...</i>

320
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,959
<i>that should be the most awkward
moment in any boy's life.</i>

321
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,165
<i>Emily and Kara said
we should go all the way.</i>

322
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,265
<i>What do you think?</i>

323
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,161
<i>Um, do you have protection?</i>

324
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,202
<i>So, dude.</i>

325
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,608
<i>Don't tell Jeff or any
of those guys, but...</i>

326
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,505
<i>I just wanted to say that...</i>

327
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,915
<i>if I did like guys...</i>

328
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,885
<i>you'd totally be the kind
of guy that I'd like.</i>

329
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,593
<i>This is weird.</i>

330
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,435
<i>I didn't mean any of that.</i>

331
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,169
<i>Just talking, you know?</i>

332
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,212
<i>Wow.</i>

333
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,215
<i>I don't think l'll ever forget
the first time Kevin told us that...</i>

334
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,617
<i>he wished he'd never been born.</i>

335
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,916
<i>- He was only twelve.
- Precocious kid.</i>

336
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,223
<i>You know, studies show
that the average child...</i>

337
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,592
<i>doesn't express that kind of
self-loathing till they're fifteen.</i>

338
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,287
<i>I bet.</i>

339
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,218
<i>Here he comes.</i>

340
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,200
<i>Hey, honey.
Meet the neighbours.</i>

341
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,071
<i>Kevin, this is Sean and Clare. They
moved into the house three doors down.</i>

342
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,306
<i>Oh, the Yeager’s' old place. Great.</i>

343
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,941
<i>Yeah, I'm, um, I'm-I'm Kevin.</i>

344
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,034
<i>Uh, pleased to meet you.
Welcome to the neighbourhood.</i>

345
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,635
<i>- Nice to meet you, too.
- Thank you. That's so polite. That's...</i>

346
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,616
<i>I'm heading out. A bunch of us are
going to meet up at The Green.</i>

347
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,140
<i>Ooh, The Green.</i>

348
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,620
<i>And, uh, yes,
I finished my homework.</i>

349
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,489
<i>Oh, and Jen and I are going to
catch a movie afterwards,</i>

350
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,590
<i>so I won't be home until late.</i>

351
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,582
<i>Oh, that's fine. Just make
sure you say hello from us.</i>

352
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,520
<i>Jen, my mom says hi.</i>

353
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,255
<i>Hello, Jen.</i>

354
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:32,197
<i>Hello, Mrs. Miller.
I'm the pretty girl.</i>

355
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,565
<i>She is.</i>

356
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,006
<i>- You guys have fun tonight. -
All right.</i>

357
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,280
<i>Nice meeting you!</i>

358
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,305
<i>So Who wants cake?</i>

359
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,217
<i>Creepy. Let's move on.</i>

360
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,350
<i>Keep searching, dude.</i>

361
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,439
<i>Hi.</i>

362
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,908
<i>- There.
- Oh, wow.</i>

363
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,103
<i>Now it's a picnic.</i>

364
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,680
<i>Would you care for
a chocolate-covered strawberry?</i>

365
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,377
<i>Oh my gosh, sweetie.
Talk about romantic.</i>

366
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,419
<i>This is perfect!</i>

367
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,422
<i>Julie, we've been together
for over a year...</i>

368
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,856
<i>Sixteen months and two weeks.</i>

369
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:32,457
<i>And in that time, I've come to realize
that you mean everything to me.</i>

370
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,457
<i>Oh, Doug. You, too.</i>

371
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,238
<i>And there's something
I want to ask you.</i>

372
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,399
<i>There's something
I'd like to ask you.</i>

373
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,343
<i>Okay, uh, you go first.</i>

374
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,144
<i>- No, you go first.
- No, you first.</i>

375
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,304
<i>No, you first.</i>

376
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,410
<i>How about we say it
at the same time?</i>

377
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:51,605
<i>Okay.</i>

378
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,613
<i>- One, two...
- One, two.</i>

379
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,421
<i>Will you poop on me?</i>

380
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,887
<i>- What?
- Will you poop on me?</i>

381
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,859
<i>What? What are you...</i>

382
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,531
<i>Wait, what did-
what did you say?</i>

383
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,668
<i>L... I trust you. I feel like
you're my soul mate.</i>

384
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,505
<i>I want to give you this gift.
I want you to be my first.</i>

385
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,235
<i>To poop...</i>

386
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,933
<i>On me. What?</i>

387
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,513
<i>You don't want to?</i>

388
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,148
<i>No, I-I mean...</i>

389
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,650
<i>Are you not attracted
to me anymore?</i>

390
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,319
<i>Of course I'm attracted
to you, honey.</i>

391
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,288
<i>So will you? Poop on me?</i>

392
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,360
<i>Ah, man. You just hit
the fucking lottery, man.</i>

393
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:42,434
<i>You don't think it's a little weird
for wanting him to shit on her?</i>

394
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:46,165
<i>Slow down, man. Have some
respect for this guy, okay?</i>

395
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,173
<i>She did not ask him to shit on her.</i>

396
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,574
<i>Shitting is something
you do on a whore.</i>

397
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:50,942
<i>- Right.
- Right?</i>

398
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,570
<i>Pooping is a gift you give
to your soul mate.</i>

399
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,615
<i>- 'Course.
- I never looked at it like that.</i>

400
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,551
<i>So tell me, man, what's on the menu?
Before you do the big deed.</i>

401
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,076
<i>I don't... I don't know.
Does it fucking matter?</i>

402
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,424
<i>- Is she a vegetarian?
- No.</i>

403
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,494
<i>Boom! Big beef burrito, with
extra beans on that bad boy.</i>

404
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,997
<i>Put some salsa,
some guacamole for colour.</i>

405
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,599
<i>When it come out of you, it's a
festival. You know what I'm saying?</i>

406
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,502
<i>You went the extra yard
for your lady. You hear me?</i>

407
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,571
<i>No, I'm doing something
classy, okay?</i>

408
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:23,302
<i>I'm doing seared ahi tuna steaks,
a salad, and red wine.</i>

409
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,610
<i>- No. No, no, no! Fucking' no!
- Nice.</i>

410
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,979
<i>It's not about how fancy it goes in.
It's about how fancy it comes out.</i>

411
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,985
<i>Well... And believe me, Mexican
food makes a fucking' mess.</i>

412
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,487
<i>And don't mess with fucking' salads.</i>

413
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,656
<i>You know what salad does?
Lt locks down your bowels.</i>

414
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,420
<i>You don't want your bowels
all locked down, do you? No.</i>

415
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,128
<i>Drinks are cool.
Have a few fucking' drinks.</i>

416
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,663
<i>- Makes you last longer.
- Last longer?</i>

417
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,532
<i>You don't want to be Mr. Two Squeeze,
Thank-You Please, right?</i>

418
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,268
<i>- You really don't want to be that.
- Billy, goddamn, Billy.</i>

419
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,604
<i>Why don't you go over there while
grown people are talking over here.</i>

420
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,506
<i>Go over there and play with your
GI Joes or some shit, man.</i>

421
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,108
<i>Yeah, l'll go over there.</i>

422
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,633
<i>Look it. Take my advice

423
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:02,647
<i>You go out tonight and you

424
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,349
<i>Get it all out your system.</i>

425
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:09,218
<i>Fucking' tomorrow, you are

426
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,919
<i>Understand?</i>

427
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,426
<i>What the fuck is this?</i>

428
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:18,419
<i>Viagra, brother.
Poop Viagra. Yeah.</i>

429
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,600
<i>- Just carry that on you?
- Yeah, I carry that shit around on me.</i>

430
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,335
<i>- At barbecues?
- You goddamn right.</i>

431
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,369
<i>I got a meat problem.</i>

432
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,037
<i>All your fucking' meat,

433
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,334
<i>- Okay, yeah.

434
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,183

00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,388
<i>Lt's not as exciting
as you might think. It's-it’s...</i>

584
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,361
<i>For me, I like to say it's more about,
just like, helping people, you know.</i>

585
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,631
<i>- It's not about punishing criminals...
- Right, yeah, I totally understand.</i>

586
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,466
<i>- It's just, it makes you feel good...
- Robin!</i>

587
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,161
<i>- Oh, no.
- Robin!</i>

588
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,296
<i>Hey, Robin. Where ya been?
Hi, how ya doing.</i>

589
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,303
<i>You missed your meeting
with your parole officer.</i>

590
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,410
<i>- What? Parole officer?
- No. He's kidding.</i>

591
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,512
<i>Yeah, yeah, this guy got in some
trouble a while back for...</i>

592
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,881
<i>whipping out his little
Dick Grayson on a playground.</i>

593
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,115
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

594
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,550
<i>But, it's all good. I mean,
your wife forgave you, right?</i>

595
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,279
<i>- What?
- You're married?</i>

596
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,355
<i>- Married pervert. Yeah.
- No, I'm not!</i>

597
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,390
<i>Stacey, I'm-I'm not married!
He's kidding!</i>

598
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,359
<i>Oh, man. Dodged that bullet.</i>

599
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,461
<i>The hell are you doing here, Batman!
You're going to ruin this!</i>

600
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,363
<i>Calm down!
Hey, look, I read on Twitter...</i>

601
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:28,199
<i>that a super-villain's going to bomb
this loser meet and greet.</i>

602
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,269
<i>So I'm here to save the day,
like I do, all the time.</i>

603
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,437
<i>I mean, you know, it's my thing.</i>

604
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,272
<i>- I'm the Batman!
- Yeah, baloney!</i>

605
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:37,175
<i>You're here to ruin my chances with
women like you do all the time.</i>

606
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,610
<i>No way, brother! No way!
No, I'm-I'm in support of this.</i>

607
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,280
<i>Get one more speed date, okay,
then we got to find that bomb.</i>

608
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,145
<i>Ah, this sucks.</i>

609
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:48,186
<i>Uh, little tip. Uh, less boy,
more wonder, right?</i>

610
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,220
<i>Ah, that's very clever.</i>

611
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,389
<i>- Dazzle them!
- Yeah, okay. Thanks.</i>

612
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,356
<i>Hi.</i>

613
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,293
<i>- Oh, hi.
- Lois. Lois Lane.</i>

614
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,352
<i>No, l... I know. I've-I've...</i>

615
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,565
<i>It's... it’s me, Robin.
We-We've met several times.</i>

616
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:04,135
<i>- Robin what?
- Ro-Robin. That's it.</i>

617
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,304
<i>I helped save you from Lex Luthor.</i>

618
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,371
<i>Sorry.</i>

619
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,440
<i>You were like, "l'll never forget
this as long as I live."</i>

620
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,634
<i>Sorry again.</i>

621
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,344
<i>- I thought you were dating Superman.
- No, no.</i>

622
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:16,280
<i>- We broke up about six months ago.
- I didn't-I didn't know that.</i>

623
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,373
<i>- He's been stalking me ever since.
- Really?</i>

624
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,478
<i>Last night, I look out
my bedroom window,</i>

625
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:24,021
<i>and there he is just floating there,</i>

626
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:27,458
<i>just stroking that nasty little
curl, and masturbating!</i>

627
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,261
<i>Blew his wad all over my window!</i>

628
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:33,097
<i>- He broke the window!
- The, the... From the...</i>

629
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:36,066
<i>Uh, his jizz is like a shotgun blast!</i>

630
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,634
<i>You know that shiny stuff
in his hair? Lt's not hair gel.</i>

631
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,929
<i>- Lois! Oh, my God!
- Oh, no!</i>

632
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,077
<i>- Nice to see you!
- Nice to be seen! Oh, my goodness!</i>

633
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,078
<i>No, no, no. Yeah, we're in the...</i>

634
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,113
<i>- Do you know each other?
- Yeah, we work together.</i>

635
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,307
<i>- You do?
- Hey, how's Superman?</i>

636
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,284
<i>I'm going to give him a call right now,
actually. I need...</i>

637
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,286
<i>- No, no! Don't do that!
- Oh, no, I'm going to do it.</i>

638
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,921
<i>- Batman, don't. Please. Please.
- It's already ringing.</i>

639
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,657
<i>Hey, Soups! What's up, brother!
Lt's the Dark Knight.</i>

640
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,259
<i>Hey, man, I was just thinking
about you here...</i>

641
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,027
<i>'cause I'm sitting with Lois...</i>

642
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,296
<i>and she's on a date
with my boy, Robin.</i>

643
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,331
<i>- No!
- Oh, he hung up. I lost him.</i>

644
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,168
<i>Stay away from Lois
or l'll use my heat vision...</i>

645
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,934
<i>to fuse your balls into
one big ridiculous uniball.</i>

646
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,273
<i>Superman, you don't
understand.</i>

647
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,503
<i>I'm not here to hit on your
girlfriend. That's crazy!</i>

648
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,111
<i>Batman and I are undercover
and we're looking for a bomb.</i>

649
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:23,481
<i>Bomb? I don't give two
super-shits about a bomb.</i>

650
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:27,611
<i>As long as I'm balls-deep
in Lois, I'm solid gold.</i>

651
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,115
<i>Stay away from Lois, bitch!</i>

652
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,216
<i>Goddammit!
That's his thing!</i>

653
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,526
<i>No, so I told him, you know,</i>

654
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,161
<i>"I mean, we're going to
be fighting crime, buddy, so..."</i>

655
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,229
<i>Oh, there he is.</i>

656
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,397
<i>"Uh, you know, you should
put on some pants."</i>

657
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,232
<i>But he liked the costume
the way it is, so,</i>

658
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,529
<i>you know, what are
you going to do. Kids.</i>

659
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,969
<i>- Well... Thursday?
- Thursday it is!</i>

660
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,404
<i>- See ya then.
- All right, now.</i>

661
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,373
<i>And, nice legs.</i>

662
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,510
<i>You make me wear this.
He makes me wear this outfit!</i>

663
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,375
<i>So unfair! I hate it!</i>

664
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,349
<i>She's a hoot! All right,
that was your date. Let's go.</i>

665
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,419
<i>- Bullcrap! That doesn't count!
- What do you mean that doesn't count?</i>

666
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,687
<i>That was a girl, this was a date.</i>

667
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,450
<i>Now, let's boogie.
We got to go find that bomb.</i>

668
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,291
<i>Please, just let me do one more.
That doesn't count. Please.</i>

669
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,527
<i>Oh, my God, you're such a baby.
Go! Sit down. Fine.</i>

670
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,595
<i>- Yes!
- Fine. Go ahead.</i>

671
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,330
<i>Have fun. But you're not
going to do it on your own.</i>

672
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,531
<i>- Pop that in your ear.
- What's that?</i>

673
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,600
<i>What I'm going to do is I'm going to
get underneath the table,</i>

674
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,503
<i>hide down there and feed you lines
to help bag this next gal.</i>

675
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,138
<i>Oh, right,
like Cyrano de Bergerac.</i>

676
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,040
<i>I don't know what that is.
It's more like Roxanne.</i>

677
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,376
<i>Okay, but look, I-I'd really
rather do this on my own.</i>

678
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,411
<i>Okay, and I hear you, and I appreciate
what you're saying,</i>

679
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,606
<i>- but I, you know, I'm going to do it.
- Please don't.</i>

680
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,017
<i>- I'm going to do it.
- Batman, don't. Please, please, don't...</i>

681
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:36,180
<i>Hi. Sorry, sorry I'm late.
There's a line in the bathroom.</i>

682
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,622
<i>Hi. I'm Super girl.</i>

683
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,556
<i>- My name...
- I'm Robin.</i>

684
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,425
<i>Hi, I'm Robin.</i>

685
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,595
<i>Um, so where you from?</i>

686
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,086
<i>- So, where you from?
- L... Um, Krypton.</i>

687
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,935
<i>Krypton, eh. Where...
That's, that's, uh...</i>

688
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,436
<i>- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit!</i>

689
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,538
<i>- Dude, I can see her snatch.
- Dude, I can sn...</i>

690
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,074
<i>Oh, my God! I can't believe
the size of this thing.</i>

691
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:01,511
<i>It's like a giant fucking cornfield.
It's enormous down here.</i>

692
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:05,149
<i>It's crazy. Look at that.
I-I-I feel like at any moment,</i>

693
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:08,452
<i>Shoeless Joe Jackson could walk out
of it and I could play catch with him.</i>

694
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:12,590
<i>Krypton. I-I hear it's really nice.
I-I have never been...</i>

695
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,426
<i>You didn't hear that the Sun supernova
and destroyed our entire race?</i>

696
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,894
<i>I want to wash dishes with it.</i>

697
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,363
<i>Did it? I did not...</i>

698
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,999
<i>It's a huge, bushy
catastrophe down here.</i>

699
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,468
<i>Feel like Sean Penn should do
a benefit for this thing. It's...</i>

700
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,405
<i>What? Oh, no.
You can hear him, can't you?</i>

701
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,429
<i>Yeah, I can hear him.</i>

702
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,405
<i>I can also see Batman
underneath the table.</i>

703
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,312
<i>Cause of the x-ray vision.
Of course.</i>

704
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:38,248
<i>No, I can just see him. It's a cafe
table. I mean, it's really obvious.</i>

705
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,507
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

706
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,554
<i>Ah, dude. I'm so sorry about
your family dying and...</i>

707
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,523
<i>Oh, man! That took me back
to the seventies, huh?</i>

708
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,563
<i>Hold on. There's our culprit.
It's the Penguin.</i>

709
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,532
<i>Excuse me. I'm going to go
do some Batman-ing.</i>

710
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,999
<i>Do you need any... Can I help?</i>

711
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,869
<i>Oh, it's hard to pick up with gloves.
There ya go.</i>

712
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,608
<i>Excuse me, sweetie. How ya doing.
You mind fucking off for a little bit?</i>

713
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,310
<i>Thank you. I appreciate it.
Thanks.</i>

714
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,578
<i>- See you later, citizen.
- How dare you!</i>

715
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:10,570
<i>You son of a bitch! Where's
the bomb, you fat fucker?</i>

716
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,276
<i>- Hey! Asshole!
- Oh, shit.</i>

717
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,486
<i>What do you think you are?
Some big man?</i>

718
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,388
<i>Picking on a little fat guy?</i>

719
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,481
<i>Take it easy! That's the Penguin.
That's what I do.</i>

720
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:21,551
<i>Why didn't you call me?</i>

721
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,893
<i>L... No... l...</i>

722
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:24,588
<i>You said that you
we’re going to call me.</i>

723
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:28,456
<i>Wait a minute. Did I not? I know I
dialled a number... Did I not hit "send"?</i>

724
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,861
<i>You said that you were going to stick
by me no matter what happened.</i>

725
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,975
<i>And then your little Bat-condom
breaks, and then you just disappear!</i>

726
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:42,309
<i>Do you know what it's like going
to Planned Parenthood by yourself,</i>

727
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,409
<i>when you're Wonder Woman?</i>

728
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,450
<i>Okay. Not very romantic talk.</i>

729
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,044
<i>Roe v. Wade here
at a speed dating situation.</i>

730
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:52,223
<i>Uh, look, I was fighting crime!
Ask Robin. Robin, vouch for me.</i>

731
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,525
<i>- He cries after sex. Do you know that?
- Why would I know that?</i>

732
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,495
<i>Like a baby.
After sex, what do you say?</i>

733
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:00,531
<i>"Oh, my soul's so dark."
Because you saw some bats...</i>

734
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,500
<i>when you were little?
You pussy!</i>

735
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,333
<i>Attention, Gotham City speed daters:</i>

736
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,072
<i>How the fuck did he
get over there?</i>

737
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,142
<i>Lt was all a clever ruse.
I'm not speed dating.</i>

738
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,133
<i>Some of you should remember
I'm happily married.</i>

739
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,613
<i>- That's right!
- You were all there at the wedding.</i>

740
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,882
<i>- Okay, bomb strapped to my chest.
- Oh, yes. In any case,</i>

741
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,117
<i>you all have to give me some
unimaginable sum of money...</i>

742
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,483
<i>or else I'm going to blow up
Super girl with this bomb.</i>

743
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,190
<i>Dat dat dat dat! The detonator
is in this umbrella.</i>

744
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,521
<i>- Cool it.
- No, you cool it.</i>

745
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,561
<i>My non-monocled eye!
Where are you?</i>

746
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:31,585
<i>Disarm!</i>

747
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,089
<i>Yes!</i>

748
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,262
<i>- Are you okay?
- I think so.</i>

749
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,864
<i>You saved my life!</i>

750
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,904
<i>Just-Just doing my job.</i>

751
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,307
<i>Kiss. Kiss her.</i>

752
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,878
<i>Open her mouth
and touch tongues.</i>

753
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,886
<i>Put your tongue inside her mouth...</i>

754
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,514
<i>and that'll coax her tongue
to go into your mouth!</i>

755
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,848
<i>Yeah! You, uh, squeeze her boobies.</i>

756
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,551
<i>Yeah, and touch her butt.</i>

757
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,898
<i>- Doesn't that look nice?
- It looks so nice.</i>

758
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,896
<i>Oh, yeah. Hold on!
Not so fast!</i>

759
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:15,906
<i>Oh, God!</i>

760
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,339
<i>- Riddler!
- Riddler!</i>

761
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,267
<i>That is right! The Riddler!</i>

762
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,582
<i>In a diabolical scheme to get Robin and
me to this speed date to stop a bomb,</i>

763
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:29,587
<i>only to lure Robin away
to some seedy warehouse...</i>

764
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:33,357
<i>where you're going to hang him above
a vat filled with thumbtacks...</i>

765
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,552
<i>or lizards or some fucking bullshit!</i>

766
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,628
<i>Well it didn't work, muchacho!</i>

767
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,196
<i>That was amazing.
How did you do that?</i>

768
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:41,187
<i>I mean, how'd you know
that she was a fake?</i>

769
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,067
<i>Bush that size is only good
for one thing,</i>

770
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,636
<i>and that one thang is hiding' the Wang!
You know what I'm saying?</i>

771
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,671
<i>Wait. Let me get this straight.
So you knew all the way back then?</i>

772
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,640
<i>- You knew that she was a dude?
- Whole time.</i>

773
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,442
<i>Wh-Why'd you make me kiss her?</i>

774
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,376
<i>Him. This.</i>

775
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:54,478
<i>I don't know.</i>

776
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,572
<i>I guess I woke up this morning with
a little case of the fuck-arounds.</i>

777
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,939
<i>You know I'm just having fun.
My buddy! Woo!</i>

778
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,069
<i>Remember this?</i>

779
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,599
<i>Ugly isn't it?</i>

780
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,607
<i>But think how they feel.</i>

781
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,852
<i>Working without thanks
to make your life better.</i>

782
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:51,192
<i>Lonely, unloved, hurt.</i>

783
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:01,008
<i>Physical, Verbal, emotional abuse...</i>

784
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,874
<i>to get what we want done.</i>

785
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,614
<i>Can't you see
they're doing their best?</i>

786
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,630
<i>They're not trying to take
over your world.</i>

787
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,861
<i>They're just trying to find
a little place in your hearts.</i>

788
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:27,899
<i>Remember, machines,
they're full of kids.</i>

789
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,845
<i>Dude, click the button.</i>

790
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,312
<i>Do not click the button.</i>

791
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,880
<i>- Who the fuck are you?
- I am the Minotaur.</i>

792
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,955
<i>You are in my maze.</i>

793
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,091
<i>Do you know where
we can find Movie 43?</i>

794
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:50,083
<i>Movie 43? Movie 43?</i>

795
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:54,995
<i>Are you prepared to have your brains
butchered into tiny pieces?</i>

796
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:59,933
<i>Are you prepared to have a starving
rat nibble out your eyeballs,</i>

797
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:05,009
<i>and then have the holes fucked
by angry, thick-decked wolves?</i>

798
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:08,035
<i>Dude, calm down. I think you're-
I think you're just confused.</i>

799
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:11,139
<i>We're-we're talking about Movie 43.
You've never heard of that.</i>

800
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,008
<i>Oh, yeah. She's here.</i>

801
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,917
<i>I think we have a connection.</i>

802
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:22,493
<i>It is the one movie that can bring
down society as we know it.</i>

803
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,362
<i>No, dude. That's something
different. I guarantee it.</i>

804
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:29,967
<i>I have taken a Vow to keep
anybody from Viewing this film.</i>

805
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,001
<i>Dude, dude.</i>

806
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,300
<i>This guy's for real. He's protected
by firewalls I've never even seen.</i>

807
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:35,973
<i>We got to click this button.</i>

808
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:38,373
<i>Do not click the button.</i>

809
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,076
<i>Do not click the...</i>

810
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:43,572
<i>Suck it!</i>

811
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,982
<i>Tyler De Soto. Fifteen.
Port St. Lucie, Florida.</i>

812
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,924
<i>He only lost a finger.</i>

813
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,295
<i>It's horrific.</i>

814
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,940
<i>I'm still not seeing what
the problem is, though.</i>

815
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:10,998
<i>Brian?</i>

816
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:15,135
<i>The iBabe has an advanced
3.2 gigahertz processor.</i>

817
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,549
<i>We left an opening for a vent and
then we placed a highly-efficient,</i>

818
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:23,282
<i>super powerful micro-fan
in the opening.</i>

819
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:27,124
<i>- And?
- The vent is in her,</i>

820
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,158
<i>Lower quadrant.</i>

821
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:29,927
<i>Vagi-port.</i>

822
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,595
<i>- Vagina.
- Vagi-port.</i>

823
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:33,063
<i>The vent is in the vagina.</i>

824
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,466
<i>A certain percentage
of our younger demographic...</i>

825
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:39,027
<i>are sticking their
you-know-what in the vent.</i>

826
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,071
<i>No, I don't know what.</i>

827
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,403
<i>Kids are sticking
their penises in the vent.</i>

828
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,603
<i>The fan then mangles
their penises.</i>

829
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,011
<i>Disgusting!</i>

830
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,414
<i>Sir, the iBabe is a...</i>

831
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,016
<i>High fidelity music player.</i>

832
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:56,349
<i>Yes, it also looks and feels
exactly like a naked woman.</i>

833
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:01,418
<i>Teenage boys are physically
attracted to naked women.</i>

834
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,026
<i>Our research doesn't
support that, sir.</i>

835
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,552
<i>Look, at the very least, we need to
put a warning sticker on the box.</i>

836
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:12,362
<i>Other MP3 players don't have a
warning not to have sex with it. Right?</i>

837
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,865
<i>A bag of potato chips
doesn't have a warning,</i>

838
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,439
<i>"Please don't fuck
these potato chips."</i>

839
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,542
<i>Am I crazy here?</i>

840
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:23,205
<i>None of us could have
seen this one coming.</i>

841
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,281
<i>I did.</i>

842
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,408
<i>Take it easy, Erin Brockovich.</i>

843
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:31,288
<i>R and D team. You did
extensive testing here.</i>

844
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:35,125
<i>Did you anticipate anybody breaching
the cooling system? Any red flags?</i>

845
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,183
<i>Dave?</i>

846
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:43,591
<i>Also, we've broken down
our problem into three steps.</i>

847
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,870
<i>Step 1: Kid buys iBabe.</i>

848
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:51,174
<i>Step 2: Kid fucks iBabe.</i>

849
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:56,843
<i>Step 3: Kid mangles dick
and sues iBabe.</i>

850
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:03,415
<i>Our goal is to eliminate
step two and step three.</i>

851
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,624
<i>Now I know what the problem is.</i>

852
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:14,857
<i>Why don't we just move the fan?
Why don't we just put it in her ear?</i>

853
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,627
<i>No. No, no, no, no, no, sir.</i>

854
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:20,270
<i>Uh, my team spent two years
doing the impossible,</i>

855
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:24,107
<i>and you're pretty much just telling us
to go back and start from scratch.</i>

856
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,243
<i>You know, to go fuck ourselves!</i>

857
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:30,080
<i>Okay, look. The iBabe weighs over
a hundred pounds, okay?</i>

858
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,050
<i>Lt's basically illegal
to take it out in public.</i>

859
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,220
<i>Women's organizations are calling
for the boycott of our entire company.</i>

860
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,850
<i>Our stock is plummeting and kids'
dicks are getting horribly mangled!</i>

861
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,222
<i>Uh, come in, come in, come in.</i>

862
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:49,132
<i>Sir, may I introduce you
to the iBabe Special Edition.</i>

863
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,292
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

864
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:56,273
<i>Faster processing,
double storage capacity,</i>

865
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,264
<i>and how about that elegant finish.</i>

866
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,178
<i>Just gorgeous. Gorgeous, gorgeous!</i>

867
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,047
<i>- Congratulations!
- Thank you.</i>

868
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,949
<i>Finally we can give our customers
a choice of colour.</i>

869
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,247
<i>Oh, my God. Just when I thought
it couldn't get more offensive.</i>

870
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:15,920
<i>Oh, for Christ's sake.</i>

871
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,288
<i>Yeah. Now I understand.</i>

872
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,168
<i>Enough! Enough!</i>

873
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,248
<i>What do you want?
Money? Women?</i>

874
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:41,081
<i>Just stop looking for Movie 43.</i>

875
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:42,512
<i>Hey! Who are you?</i>

876
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,156
<i>Movie 43. Where is Movie 43?</i>

877
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:48,147
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

878
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,528
<i>Where is Movie 43? Don't lie!</i>

879
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,860
<i>Get away from me! Get off me! No!</i>

880
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,121
<i>The fuck, man!</i>

881
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,470
<i>So you know where Movie 43 is.</i>

882
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,505
<i>No!</i>

883
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:04,308
<i>The movie that allows you
to see into the future.</i>

884
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,476
<i>No! Lt will destroy society!</i>

885
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:09,172
<i>He will unleash
the dead up in protocol!</i>

886
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:12,109
<i>Did Stevie Schraeder
tell you any of this?</i>

887
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,308
<i>Who is this Stevie Schraeder?</i>

888
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,347
<i>Who is Stevie Schraeder?</i>

889
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:20,190
<i>- Who is this Stevie Schraeder?
- I don't know Stevie Schraeder!</i>

890
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,358
<i>- You lie!
- What the fuck?</i>

891
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,026
<i>Fuck you!</i>

892
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,529
<i>Who is Stevie Schraeder? You tell
me where Stevie Schraeder is!</i>

893
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,130
<i>Who is this motherfucker?</i>

894
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,189
<i>He's a kid in my fucking
Driver's Ed class!</i>

895
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:34,237
<i>You will find us Movie 43,
J.J. And Baxter.</i>

896
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:35,636
<i>What the fuck, man!</i>

897
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,102
<i>Keep looking!</i>

898
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,567
<i>- I'm looking!
- Don't look!</i>

899
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,578
<i>I'm, uh, RSVP-ing
to Sammy's Bar Mitzvah.</i>

900
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,612
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

901
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,616
<i>The party, not the service.</i>

902
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:54,223
<i>My mom always makes me
go to both. Sucks.</i>

903
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:57,182
<i>Yeah.</i>

904
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:17,371
<i>Yeah!</i>

905
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:21,109
<i>Nathan on a date for once!</i>

906
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,378
<i>Jesus, Mikey, shut up!</i>

907
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:26,979
<i>What? Mom told me to watch
you guys. I'm just doing my job.</i>

908
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,389
<i>I mean it, Mikey. Leave!</i>

909
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:32,555
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

910
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,232
<i>Sorry, my brother's an idiot.</i>

911
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,366
<i>Whatever.</i>

912
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,303
<i>- You have a bathroom?
- Totally. It's right back there.</i>

913
00:50:58,288 --> 00:50:59,380
<i>- Yuck!
- Nathan?</i>

914
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,459
<i>Nathan, l...</i>

915
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:05,495
<i>My brother spilled fruit punch on the
couch. There's a big red stain.</i>

916
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,395
<i>I, I, um... I need to go.</i>

917
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:10,397
<i>But you're not getting picked up
for another half hour.</i>

918
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,898
<i>Want to sit and watch
some more TV?</i>

919
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:18,463
<i>Yeah. L'll-l'll just... l'll just
watch it from back here.</i>

920
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,601
<i>That's cool. I like standing.</i>

921
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:27,908
<i>Whoa! Mikey spilled fruit
punch on the wall, too!</i>

922
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,321
<i>- My mom is going to be so pissed!
- Nathan, I really need to go!</i>

923
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:33,490
<i>Hey, lovebirds, I hope I'm not...</i>

924
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,259
<i>Holy shit, you are covered
in blood! Oh, my God!</i>

925
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,961
<i>- What?
- Oh, my God!</i>

926
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:39,596
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!</i>

927
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,332
<i>Oh, my God! You must've s-sat
on a nail or something!</i>

928
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:44,960
<i>- You idiot! She's having her period!
- Oh, my God!</i>

929
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:46,563
<i>What do I do?</i>

930
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,672
<i>You don't know what to do?
You've never had your period before?</i>

931
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,907
<i>- No, I haven't.
- Oh, my God,</i>

932
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,374
<i>Mikey, she's already
lost a lot of blood!</i>

933
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,711
<i>Okay. Um, you know what?</i>

934
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,713
<i>Mom's got to have some tampons
around here somewhere, right?</i>

935
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,982
<i>Oh, my God!
This is not happening!</i>

936
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:00,484
<i>Fuck! You are way skinnier than Mom!</i>

937
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,352
<i>There-There's no way
they're going to fit you!</i>

938
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:03,987
<i>Look, I'm just going to walk home!</i>

939
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:06,353
<i>No, no, no, no! You can't walk
home in your condition, silly!</i>

940
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,991
<i>Mikey, hurry!</i>

941
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,892
<i>There's just plastic bags! I don't
know what the fuck you want me to do!</i>

942
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,196
<i>- What?
- Wipe yourself!</i>

943
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:14,898
<i>Hey, hey, hey!
Guys, I'm home early.</i>

944
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,126
<i>Dad, help us!</i>

945
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,491
<i>Pardon me, I'm Nathan's father, Steve.</i>

946
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,339
<i>Oh, we're just going to have to plug
it up. I found this and this.</i>

947
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:23,397
<i>All right, what's going on here?</i>

948
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,644
<i>Nathan's date is on her period
for the first time,</i>

949
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,412
<i>and she's bleeding everywhere!</i>

950
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:30,447
<i>- Oh, disgusting.
- What?</i>

951
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,149
<i>I mean, congratulations,
young lady.</i>

952
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,384
<i>"Congratulations"?
She's bleeding to death!</i>

953
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,419
<i>Oh, my God!
My stomach hurts!</i>

954
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,121
<i>She's having contractions!</i>

955
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:39,918
<i>No! Oh, no!</i>

956
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,892
<i>All right.</i>

957
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:45,395
<i>N-Nine-one-one? Yeah, my friend
is bleeding out of her vagina!</i>

958
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:46,384
<i>Nathan, Nathan, listen!</i>

959
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,487
<i>Why are you laughing at me?</i>

960
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:52,299
<i>Lt's just... it’s...
The-The lining of Amanda's...</i>

961
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,332
<i>internal organs just
spilling out of her.</i>

962
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,337
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

963
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,442
<i>Look, I'm not dying!</i>

964
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,376
<i>I got frozen peas and a sponge!</i>

965
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,613
<i>Lf you want to keep the lining intact,</i>

966
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:07,918
<i>the man has to insert his
erect phallus into her vagina.</i>

967
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,113
<i>- A what?
- You know what? I got a perfect thing.</i>

968
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,056
<i>Maxi pad on a stick.</i>

969
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,388
<i>Oh, my God! I want to kill myself!</i>

970
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,117
<i>Hello! Hey, baby, you ready?</i>

971
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,163
<i>- What the hell's going on here?
- Dad!</i>

972
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,221
<i>Oh, my God! Honey!</i>

973
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:24,434
<i>What the hell kind of sick family
squashes a large tomato...</i>

974
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:25,958
<i>on my daughter's pants?</i>

975
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,572
<i>Whoa. Watch what you're
implying about my family.</i>

976
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,597
<i>Oh, I don't got to watch
anything, Jack!</i>

977
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,438
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah!</i>

978
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:34,611
<i>- You touching me?
- Yeah, yeah, bitch, yeah!</i>

979
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,112
<i>- You touching me?
- You're not to touch me!</i>

980
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:37,909
<i>- Let's go, bitch!
- Let's go!</i>

981
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,410
<i>Sucker punch him! Sucker punch
him in the throat!</i>

982
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,452
<i>Everybody shut up!</i>

983
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:50,293
<i>Look, I'm just a regular seventh-grade
girl getting my period,</i>

984
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,126
<i>and it really sucks that it had
to be in front of all you idiots.</i>

985
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:58,457
<i>Dad, call Mom and tell her
to meet us at home.</i>

986
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,371
<i>She's got her period?</i>

987
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,941
<i>So disgusting.</i>

988
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,137
<i>You don't have a camping tarp
I could borrow, do you?</i>

989
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:13,444
<i>Sorry about all that.</i>

990
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,347
<i>Hey, honey, don't sit in the car!</i>

991
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:20,081
<i>Vagina is way too complicated!</i>

992
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,980
<i>Yeah, no shit.</i>

993
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,589
<i>Really?</i>

994
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,592
<i>Dad, that was epic!</i>

995
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:35,398
<i>I've been trying to push that puppy out
since this morning's conference call.</i>

996
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:38,236
<i>Woo! I got to take a massive dump,
and then we're watching the game.</i>

997
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:39,603
<i>- Yeah.
- Yes!</i>

998
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,879
<i>Oh, nice!</i>

999
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,212
<i>Come on, come on, come on, come on.</i>

1000
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,476
<i>Look who we found.</i>

1001
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:23,574
<i>J. J?</i>

1002
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,890
<i>- Stevie Schraeder?
- I freaking told you.</i>

1003
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,558
<i>Wh... What the fuck!
How'd he get there?</i>

1004
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:31,394
<i>Stevie, tell them about Movie 43!</i>

1005
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:34,898
<i>What's Movie 43?
They keep asking me that.</i>

1006
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:37,332
<i>- Cut off Stevie Schraeder's finger
- What!</i>

1007
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,569
<i>No, don't cut off
Stevie Schraeder's finger!</i>

1008
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,372
<i>Don't cut off Stevie Schraeder's
finger! Please!</i>

1009
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:44,140
<i>Movie 43 isn't real.</i>

1010
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,409
<i>It's just something Calvin
and I made up to prank you!</i>

1011
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:47,977
<i>Well, apparently it is real,</i>

1012
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:50,468
<i>and we need to find it
or else your stupid friend dies!</i>

1013
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,508
<i>- Unless...
- Unless what? Unless what?</i>

1014
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:56,653
<i>I can fashion
a ninety-one-F-Theta Box.</i>

1015
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,922
<i>No. Not the Theta Box. Please!
Do not do that!</i>

1016
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,591
<i>Go! Make a Theta Box, dude.
Whatever that is.</i>

1017
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,252
<i>Okay. Don't wait for me.</i>

1018
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:07,528
<i>Movie 43. Wh-Where is it?
Where is it?</i>

1019
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,563
<i>Go fuck yourself, asshole!</i>

1020
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:17,071
<i>Don't do this.</i>

1021
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,142
<i>Brian, we're best friends, man.
You can't move out.</i>

1022
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:21,611
<i>You fucked my girlfriend, dude.</i>

1023
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:23,203
<i>One time.</i>

1024
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,081
<i>For a week.</i>

1025
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,981
<i>- What?
- But I want to make it up to you.</i>

1026
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,279
<i>Can I fuck your girlfriend?</i>

1027
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,888
<i>Yes, but she broke up with me...</i>

1028
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,656
<i>when she found out
I slept with your girlfriend...</i>

1029
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,248
<i>so I can't arrange it.</i>

1030
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:39,153
<i>But Brian, I got you something.</i>

1031
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:43,330
<i>Best birthday present ever.
You are going to love this.</i>

1032
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,994
<i>- Is this really necessary?
- Trust me.</i>

1033
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:51,496
<i>It's better if it's a...</i>

1034
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:55,132
<i>One, two, three, surprise!</i>

1035
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,916
<i>I know, right, buddy?
Happy birthday.</i>

1036
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,586
<i>You kidnapped an lrish midget.</i>

1037
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,022
<i>No, I caught you a leprechaun.</i>

1038
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,922
<i>Moron. There's no such
thing as leprechauns.</i>

1039
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,024
<i>Dude, watch this.</i>

1040
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:12,395
<i>Hey, little buddy.</i>

1041
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:15,990
<i>Tell my friend you're going
to give us a big pot of gold.</i>

1042
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,436
<i>I'm going to cut off your balls
and feed them to you!</i>

1043
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,630
<i>Good Lord.</i>

1044
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:25,608
<i>He's just joking. He's got to give us
the gold. That's the rules. Right?</i>

1045
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:29,203
<i>The last thing you'll ever see is
my cock, skull-fucking you!</i>

1046
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,106
<i>Let me ask him again.</i>

1047
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,854
<i>Give us the fucking gold!</i>

1048
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:41,124
<i>Do you want the lights on or off...</i>

1049
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,490
<i>when I fuck you with
a pair of rusty scissors?</i>

1050
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:47,464
<i>Stop, stop! Chill! Chill!</i>

1051
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,500
<i>What are you doing?
You're going to kill him!</i>

1052
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,992
<i>Watch out! Relax! L'll handle this,
okay? L'll handle this.</i>

1053
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,540
<i>Hey, Mr. Leprechaun.</i>

1054
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,013
<i>I am super sorry about this.</i>

1055
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:05,515
<i>It's just a misunderstanding,</i>

1056
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:09,611
<i>so what I'm going to do...
is untie you and let you go.</i>

1057
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,851
<i>How does that sound?</i>

1058
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:14,887
<i>Okay... but first...</i>

1059
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:19,855
<i>Lick my crusty lrish taint,
ya yeast-breeding cunt hole!</i>

1060
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,598
<i>Die! Die, you little magical fuck!</i>

1061
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,669
<i>Whoa, stop! Stop! Think!</i>

1062
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,239
<i>Lf he's dead, he can't tell us
where the gold is!</i>

1063
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:33,505
<i>Fucking giants.
Motherfucking full-growns!</i>

1064
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:37,180
<i>When all this is over, I'm going
to crawl up your mother's cunt...</i>

1065
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,982
<i>and start a fucking campfire!</i>

1066
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:42,919
<i>Hey! No! Shut up!
You can't do anything...</i>

1067
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:46,089
<i>because you're tiny and tied to a
chair, and nobody knows where you are.</i>

1068
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:47,113
<i>No one!</i>

1069
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:50,387
<i>I wouldn't bet on that.</i>

1070
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,088
<i>Who's calling?</i>

1071
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,031
<i>Hello?</i>

1072
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,467
<i>So this is what a dead
man sounds like.</i>

1073
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,435
<i>- It's another leprechaun.
- Fuck!</i>

1074
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,904
<i>Lf that's my brother...</i>

1075
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:04,340
<i>prepare to have your dickhole
stretched over a fucking fire hydrant!</i>

1076
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,910
<i>- What's wrong with your fucking mouth?
- Gag him.</i>

1077
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:07,899
<i>Your balls...</i>

1078
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:10,246
<i>Listen, Cookie O'Puss...</i>

1079
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:13,950
<i>I got a leprechaun and I want some
gold or we're going to kill him.</i>

1080
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,851
<i>How do you feel about
having your balls cut off?</i>

1081
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:19,212
<i>Jeez, they're so into balls.</i>

1082
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:22,091
<i>I'm serious. You better
make with the gold...</i>

1083
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:24,961
<i>or your little green man will be
pushing up four-leaf clovers!</i>

1084
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,861
<i>That was so good.
You sounded so tough.</i>

1085
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:28,525
<i>Okay.</i>

1086
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,857
<i>What did he say?</i>

1087
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,036
<i>He said "Okay."</i>

1088
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:38,072
<i>No way. How did he get
here so fast?</i>

1089
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,085
<i>Sweet!</i>

1090
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:06,329
<i>- Gold coins!
- Gold!</i>

1091
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,930
<i>- Happy Birthday, dude!
- Holy crap!</i>

1092
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:14,009
<i>So, we get the gold and
we keep this little fucker?</i>

1093
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:17,145
<i>Did you hear that? Looks like
you’re lucky charms just ran out.</i>

1094
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:20,280
<i>Who's magically
delicious now, bitch?</i>

1095
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:22,585
<i>What? Did you say something?</i>

1096
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:26,077
<i>I couldn't hear you over my giant
pot of leprechaun gold!</i>

1097
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,387
<i>Top o' the morning, ladies!</i>

1098
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:34,287
<i>- He shot me in the eye!
- He shot me in my nipples!</i>

1099
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,990
<i>I'm half goddamn blind!</i>

1100
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,098
<i>Taste Celtic steel!</i>

1101
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,174
<i>That's right, brother!
Fuck him up good!</i>

1102
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:48,044
<i>This is what happens when
you take a leprechaun's gold!</i>

1103
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:51,014
<i>Stab him with your leprechaun
knife! Cut off his balls!</i>

1104
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,382
<i>Go leprechauns!</i>

1105
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:55,018
<i>- Walk to the rainbow.
- What?</i>

1106
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:58,154
<i>- Cut off his balls!
- Help! Pete! Help!</i>

1107
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:01,090
<i>I'm going to mangle your balls!</i>

1108
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,524
<i>Shoot him! Shoot
the fucking leprechaun!</i>

1109
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:07,196
<i>You moron! Not that
leprechaun! This leprechaun!</i>

1110
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,994
<i>Tell St. Patty you like it
up the ass!</i>

1111
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:18,165
<i>What now?</i>

1112
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,612
<i>Not much to these guys.</i>

1113
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,580
<i>Yeah. I thought they'd be bigger.</i>

1114
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,615
<i>Hey, Pete, I just want
to say thank you.</i>

1115
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:31,111
<i>- Yeah, it is a lot of gold.
- Nah, it's more than gold.</i>

1116
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,289
<i>Catching that leprechaun
must have been hard work.</i>

1117
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:36,156
<i>Something that only a true
friend would do for me.</i>

1118
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:39,419
<i>Yeah, well, I should have never
slept with your girlfriend.</i>

1119
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:42,154
<i>Whatever. We can buy
new girlfriends.</i>

1120
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:46,169
<i>Dude, I totally forgot
the second part of your gift!</i>

1121
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:47,136
<i>Really?</i>

1122
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:57,043
<i>- Who is she?
- She's a fairy. Storybook fairy.</i>

1123
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,882
<i>What the hell am I supposed
to do with a fairy?</i>

1124
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,348
<i>I suck cock for gold coins.</i>

1125
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,049
<i>J.J., make some space!</i>

1126
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,089
<i>- What can I do?
- I need metal. Right now! Go!</i>

1127
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,198
<i>Use your Tinker Toys.</i>

1128
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:21,433
<i>- Trophies! Spoons!
- Stop yelling at me! L'll do it!</i>

1129
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:28,311
<i>- Right.
- I'm go. Initiate sequence.</i>

1130
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,545
<i>Is this going to work?</i>

1131
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:30,569
<i>Lt better!</i>

1132
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,575
<i>Here we go!</i>

1133
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:36,581
<i>How do you do this?</i>

1134
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,182
<i>We're getting close!</i>

1135
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:41,514
<i>Yeah?</i>

1136
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,584
<i>Yes, we're getting very close!</i>

1137
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:49,626
<i>Uno marguerite, por favour?</i>

1138
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,058
<i>You want salt?</i>

1139
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:52,394
<i>Sí, bueno.</i>

1140
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:56,272
<i>- And for you?
- Whynatte and rum, please.</i>

1141
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,398
<i>Got it.</i>

1142
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,132
<i>Do you mind me asking a question?
Lt may seem personal.</i>

1143
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:05,081
<i>I'm quite surprised that a lady
with your face needs to resort to...</i>

1144
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:06,241
<i>- Match dot com?
- Right.</i>

1145
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:11,254
<i>Truth is, I have completely
exhausted all of my options.</i>

1146
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:12,288
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

1147
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,657
<i>Oh, dear. That's a shame.
And are you from the area?</i>

1148
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:16,292
<i>No. Let's not do that, okay?</i>

1149
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,327
<i>I've been on so many blind dates
in the past year,</i>

1150
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:19,555
<i>and they're all the same.</i>

1151
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,064
<i>"Where are you from?
What does your sister do?</i>

1152
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:23,166
<i>What does your father..."
Blah, blah, blah.</i>

1153
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:25,168
<i>Do you really care if my father
is a garbage man?</i>

1154
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:27,170
<i>- Is your father a garbage man?
- No, he's not! That's the point.</i>

1155
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,538
<i>- Who cares?
- Not important.</i>

1156
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:32,241
<i>So let's not do that. Let's
have this date be different.</i>

1157
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:35,278
<i>- Let's talk about real things, okay?
- Great.</i>

1158
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:38,042
<i>- Real, straight conversations.
- I'm all about that.</i>

1159
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:40,943
<i>So what does your father
do for a living?</i>

1160
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:46,116
<i>Okay. Let's play a game.</i>

1161
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:48,024
<i>- Okay.
- Have you played Truth or Dare?</i>

1162
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:49,492
<i>I haven't played it,
but I'm aware of it.</i>

1163
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:53,087
<i>Well, you start first.
You ask me, "Truth or Dare."</i>

1164
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:55,125
<i>- Truth or Dare?
- Truth.</i>

1165
01:03:55,364 --> 01:04:00,203
<i>Is there any possibility
in this noble cosmos...</i>

1166
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:04,367
<i>or any alternative parallel
cosmos where you might...</i>

1167
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,938
<i>Is there any chance I'm your type?</i>

1168
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,280
<i>Yeah. Yeah. You're tall.</i>

1169
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:14,542
<i>- And that's good?
- I like tall.</i>

1170
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:16,352
<i>Okay, Truth or Dare?</i>

1171
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,376
<i>Truth?</i>

1172
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:22,147
<i>I knew you'd say that. I am going to
push the limits just a little bit.</i>

1173
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:26,120
<i>- Are you circumcised?
- Am I circumcised?</i>

1174
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,924
<i>That's personal.</i>

1175
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:32,268
<i>Circumcision has never really taken
off, to be honest, where I'm from.</i>

1176
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:35,533
<i>It's not... it's not the vogue.</i>

1177
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,366
<i>I tend to associate it
with Jewish people...</i>

1178
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:41,210
<i>and we don't have many Jewish
people in Europe anymore...</i>

1179
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,913
<i>because of the... trouble.</i>

1180
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,938
<i>So, no, I'm not.</i>

1181
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,215
<i>But if you would need me to get
circumcised, I'm sure I could.</i>

1182
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,547
<i>- Truth or Dare?
- Truth.</i>

1183
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:55,258
<i>When was the last time
you kissed a man?</i>

1184
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:59,319
<i>Twenty-six days ago in an alley behind
a Pilates studio. Truth or Dare?</i>

1185
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:01,493
<i>Dare. I'm going
to go with a Dare.</i>

1186
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:05,565
<i>Here we go. Now we're
cooking. Okay.</i>

1187
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:09,596
<i>I dare you to go over there.</i>

1188
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:13,409
<i>See that man with the black
jacket? The husky guy?</i>

1189
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,245
<i>I dare you to go
and pinch his ass.</i>

1190
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,347
<i>- Do what now?
- Just cup it.</i>

1191
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:19,939
<i>Grab his cheeks and cup it.</i>

1192
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:22,251
<i>- No.
- Yeah.</i>

1193
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,654
<i>You said Dare, not me.
That's what Dare is.</i>

1194
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,555
<i>- Have a look at him. He's quite...
- I see him.</i>

1195
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:28,357
<i>Go back there and cup his ass.</i>

1196
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:29,392
<i>He's quite a stocky man.</i>

1197
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:31,494
<i>- He might have a knife.
- I don't even have to be here.</i>

1198
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:34,130
<i>I can go home and watch Family Guy
if you don't want to play.</i>

1199
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,164
<i>L'll get the check.
Excuse me!</i>

1200
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:36,632
<i>- Can I have the check?
- She doesn't need the check.</i>

1201
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:37,929
<i>She's joking.</i>

1202
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:40,202
<i>- Then go cup his ass.
- Okay, I will.</i>

1203
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:54,009
<i>I call him, and he never answers
the phone. I'm sick of it.</i>

1204
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,343
<i>- Go pay him a visit.
- You call him.</i>

1205
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:02,389
<i>I'm sick and tired of it. It's...</i>

1206
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:05,428
<i>- What the fuck?
- I did. Sorry.</i>

1207
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:08,397
<i>You touching my fucking ass!
What's the matter with you!</i>

1208
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:11,467
<i>- What do you mean, you? Fuck you!
- Sorry. Sorry.</i>

1209
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,637
<i>- You touch the wrong ass, asshole!
- It's all good.</i>

1210
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,366
<i>- What's the matter with you?
- Sorry. Apologies. Sorry.</i>

1211
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,140
<i>That was great!</i>

1212
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,309
<i>Truth or Dare? Truth or Dare?</i>

1213
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,377
<i>Wait a minute. Can I enjoy the...</i>

1214
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,504
<i>Truth or Dare? Come on.</i>

1215
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,147
<i>Okay. Dare.</i>

1216
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,949
<i>Right. You go and cup his ass.</i>

1217
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:30,152
<i>No. You can't dare me to do the
same thing I just dared you to do.</i>

1218
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,154
<i>- Truth or Dare.
- Come up with your own dare.</i>

1219
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,143
<i>Be original.</i>

1220
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:38,857
<i>See that blind kid over there?
Blow out his candles before he can.</i>

1221
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:43,065
<i>I can't do that! That's cruel!</i>

1222
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,333
<i>Lt's Truth or Dare.
That's the rule.</i>

1223
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,969
<i>I could take off if you want.
I could go home.</i>

1224
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:49,505
<i>L'll probably get home in time
to put Benny Hill DVDs on.</i>

1225
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:52,030
<i>- You're doing that?
- It's up to you.</i>

1226
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,577
<i>L'll go over there and
blow out the candles,</i>

1227
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:56,101
<i>but you need to know something.</i>

1228
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,437
<i>This is war.</i>

1229
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:02,213
<i>I wish it was my birthday
So I could party, too</i>

1230
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:06,285
<i>Happy, happy birthday
May all your dreams come true</i>

1231
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,925
<i>Happy, happy birthday
From all of us to you</i>

1232
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:10,983
<i>Hey!</i>

1233
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,902
<i>Excuse me. I got $200.
Can you give me the whole thing?</i>

1234
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:46,495
<i>I dare you to make guacamole

<i>Thanks, sweetie.</i>

1241
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:04,240

- Yes. I had a really great time.</i>

1242
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,366
<i>Yeah? Me, too.</i>

1243
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:08,577

- Yeah. We did a lot.</i>

1244

<i>Yes. Yeah. We did. We did.</i>

1245
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,482
<i>- We did it up.
- Yes.</i>

1246
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,417
<i>It was enchanting.
You're really a...</i>

01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,218
<i>- Sorry, Mommy.
- Back to business.</i>

1300
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:16,932
<i>Security breach! Security breach!
Commence evasive manoeuvres.</i>

1301
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:19,423
<i>- Defensive manoeuvres!
- Dammit, they jumped the wire!</i>

1302
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:23,560
<i>VrankoVich!
On me, you dumb Ruskie!</i>

1303
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,941
<i>Baxter! You can prevent
this from happening!</i>

1304
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:28,210
<i>Hack into the Department
of Defence security mainframe...</i>

1305
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:31,941
<i>using a Mark-7 Spartan from
the Bundesnachrichtendienst...</i>

1306
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:38,921
<i>- No way!
- Oh, shit!</i>

1307
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:42,379
<i>- That was awesome!
- No way!</i>

1308
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,426
<i>Dude! No way! I'm never
making fun of you again. Period.</i>

1309
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:46,195
<i>We were trying to prank you!
You turned that around...</i>

1310
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,628
<i>I swear it wasn't a prank!</i>

1311
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:50,399
<i>Oh, my God. You're
expecting me to believe...</i>

1312
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:52,634
<i>that somehow in the next
six months the whole world ends...</i>

1313
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:55,535
<i>- and I'm a drooling cripple?
- I didn't do it!</i>

1314
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,072
<i>What are you?</i>

1315
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:58,574
<i>What's with the lights?
That was weird.</i>

1316
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,633
<i>I'm going to the supermarket.
Does anyone need anything?</i>

1317
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:07,215
<i>No.</i>

1318
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:09,173
<i>What is it?</i>

1319
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:17,852
<i>No!</i>

1320
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:21,591
<i>- I'm sorry, Mommy! I'm sorry!
- What are you sorry about?</i>

1321
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,864
<i>- What's happening?
- Shit!</i>

1322
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:29,464
<i>God!</i>

1323
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,942
<i>I can fix this! Mark-7 Spartan!</i>

1324
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:36,912
<i>That computer's fried. Go get
my laptop out of my room!</i>

1325
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,142
<i>All right, I got it! I got it.
Don't worry.</i>

1326
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:42,477
<i>- Don't let him pull his own dick off.
- Why would he pull his own dick off?</i>

1327
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:44,608
<i>I fucking got it! I got it!</i>

1328
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,983
<i>Why is my computer so slow?</i>

1329
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,626
<i>Why is there porn on my computer?</i>

1330
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,193
<i>April Fools.</i>

1331
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,029
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

1332
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,076
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

1333
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:48,243
<i>In 1959, Kenny Jackson coached
the Ellison High Journeymen...</i>

1334
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:50,646
<i>to become the first Negro
high school team...</i>

1335
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:52,876
<i>ever to compete for a state title.</i>

1336
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,308
<i>Theirs was Victory's glory.</i>

1337
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:59,621
<i>Come on, y'all. Why y'all still sitting
here? The game's all about to start.</i>

1338
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:01,919
<i>Coach, we scared.</i>

1339
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:07,152
<i>There's 10,000 white people out there
that think that we ain't good enough.</i>

1340
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:11,531
<i>You know what?
Maybe we ain't.</i>

1341
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,997
<i>All of y'all feel like that?</i>

1342
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:16,962
<i>Four hundred years in this country...</i>

1343
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:21,907
<i>the black man has been
spit on, kicked...</i>

1344
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,478
<i>drug through the mud.</i>

1345
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,208
<i>But I've got two things
I can tell you.</i>

1346
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:31,950
<i>Number one, win or lose...</i>

1347
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:35,089
<i>I am so proud of y'all.</i>

1348
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:38,390
<i>Number two...</i>

1349
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:42,053
<i>You're going to win.</i>

1350
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:45,223
<i>It's just that plain
and fucking simple.</i>

1351
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,265
<i>You're going to win!</i>

1352
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,571
<i>But them white boys
from Hickory Tech...</i>

1353
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:52,039
<i>- What game are we playing?
- Basketball, Coach.</i>

1354
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:53,968
<i>What colour is their skin?</i>

1355
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:56,178
<i>- White.
- Exactly!</i>

1356
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:58,043
<i>They're white, you're black.</i>

1357
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:00,014
<i>This is basketball...</i>

1358
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:02,618
<i>Am I speaking fucking Chinese?</i>

1359
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:05,587
<i>Come on, people.
You guys are 25 and 0.</i>

1360
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:08,112
<i>Yeah, Coach, but that was
against all-black teams.</i>

1361
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:12,160
<i>That's the point! Y'all are going
to kill those Caucasians!</i>

1362
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,363
<i>But, Coach, look at
their fundamentals.</i>

1363
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:17,127
<i>The fundamentals!
Lt doesn't matter!</i>

1364
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:22,204
<i>Lt's all the same when you're some
cement-foot troglodyte white boy...</i>

1365
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:25,207
<i>getting dunked on with a big pair
of black fucking nuts...</i>

1366
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:27,142
<i>hanging on your forehead!</i>

1367
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:29,144
<i>Speaking of nuts...
Luscious.</i>

1368
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,577
<i>Come on up here, Luscious.</i>

1369
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:34,444
<i>Tell them.
How long is your dick?</i>

1370
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:37,048
<i>I don't know, Coach. Like a foot.</i>

1371
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,012
<i>Foot and a half.</i>

1372
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:41,177
<i>Foot and a ha...</i>

1373
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,016
<i>Foot and a half?</i>

1374
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,063
<i>Their arm ain't even that long!</i>

1375
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:52,056
<i>All right, let's kick some butt.
You scared?</i>

1376
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:54,225
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

1377
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:57,139
<i>You Negroes going
to play basketball, or what?</i>

1378
01:17:57,139 --> 01:18:00,233
<i>Yeah, you Negroes.
What's the matter?</i>

1379
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:04,173
<i>Did you realize you didn't belong
in a white man's game, you Negroes?</i>

1380
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:06,882
<i>That's right. This isn't
a game for Negroes.</i>

1381
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:11,219
<i>It's a game for good, honest
white people, not for Negroes.</i>

1382
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:13,050
<i>You understand, Negroes?</i>

1383
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:17,919
<i>- White Knights!
- White Knights!</i>

1384
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,229
<i>Man, Coach, they looked tough.</i>

1385
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:23,432
<i>"They looked tough"?
I'm so scared!</i>

1386
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:25,067
<i>You know what they might do?</i>

1387
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:28,503
<i>One of them might dribble
with his left hand...</i>

1388
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:31,239
<i>all the way down the lane and then
go up for a left-handed layup...</i>

1389
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:33,230
<i>and you know what's going
to happen then?</i>

1390
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:37,070
<i>Your black ass is going
to swat that shit...</i>

1391
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:42,284
<i>jump over his cracker ass, and
dunk in his goddamn face!</i>

1392
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:45,287
<i>How many fucking times
do I have to tell you?</i>

1393
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:49,485
<i>You're black, they're white,
this ain't hockey!</i>

1394
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:54,925
<i>Guys, I think what Coach is trying to
say is that the key word is "teamwork."</i>

1395
01:18:55,297 --> 01:19:00,234
<i>No, the key word is
"you're black, they're white"!</i>

1396
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:03,505
<i>So, Coach, what you're saying is,
if we just walk with the Lord...</i>

1397
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:06,141
<i>The Lord? Nigger, the Lord
done did his part already!</i>

1398
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:09,269
<i>He made you black.
He made them white.</i>

1399
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:13,275
<i>He gave you a foot-and-a-half dick!
Dribble with that motherfucker!</i>

1400
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:16,983
<i>As long as y'all are out
there on the floor...</i>

1401
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:19,988
<i>you're going to score more
points than them.</i>

1402
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:22,149
<i>That's just how basketball works!</i>

1403
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:30,526
<i>Cut that goddamn
slow clap shit out!</i>

1404
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:33,100
<i>Tries my motherfucking patience!</i>

1405
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:35,131
<i>Go out there and win!</i>

1406
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:38,195
<i>- Let's go!
- Come on!</i>

1407
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,494
<i>Lt was a glorious game.</i>

1408
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,372
<i>But late in the fourth quarter...</i>

1409
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:14,276
<i>when Luscious Williams dribbled
the entire length of the court...</i>

1410
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:16,369
<i>with his foot-and-a-half penis...</i>

1411
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:20,206
<i>the referees had no choice
but to call a technical foul...</i>

1412
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:24,352
<i>sending young Bobby Lee Mayflower
to the line...</i>

1413
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:27,919
<i>for the most dramatic
moment of the contest.</i>

1414
01:20:51,046 --> 01:20:52,280
<i>Hey, guys. Hello.</i>

1415
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,941
<i>Who is that woman you are with?</i>

1416
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:55,584
<i>That's my mother.</i>

1417
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:57,313
<i>I want your mother.</i>

1418
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:03,252
<i>- Baxter, turn that shit off, man.
- Okay.</i>

1419
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:05,859
<i>I'm going to go to
the bathroom, all right?</i>

1420
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:14,026
<i>I can't fucking do it.</i>

1421
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:17,138
<i>- I don't know, but I been told
- I don't know, but I been told</i>

1422
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:18,406
<i>Gym class gives you great big balls</i>

1423
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:19,395
<i>Gym class gives you...</i>

1424
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:24,379
<i>Out here shooting the shit.</i>

1425
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:28,213
<i>Some guys shoot the shit, and some
people get shot with shit. Right?</i>

1426
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:30,442
<i>- Am I right?
- I don't know what he's talking about.</i>

1427
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:32,287
<i>You know what the fuck
I'm talking about.</i>

1428
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:34,221
<i>I want to be on you.</i>

1429
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:36,621
<i>In you.</i>

1430
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,355
<i>- Sorry. Fuck.
- Not a problem.</i>

1431
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:47,435
<i>No.</i>

1432
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:51,130
<i>No, I can just see him
underneath the table.</i>

1433
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:54,467
<i>And he's had his fingers in
my pussy for the last five minutes.</i>

1434
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,243
<i>It's monstrous. It looks like she's
sitting on Art Garfunkel's shoulders.</i>

1435
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:09,322
<i>No one leaves this room
till we figure this out.</i>

1436
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:13,428
<i>Mangled dicks. Mangled...</i>

1437
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:15,630
<i>Dicks, dicks, dicks, dicks...</i>

1438
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:18,266
<i>- Mangled dicks.
- Mangled dicks. Mangled...</i>

1439
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:20,325
<i>- Dicks.
- Dicks.</i>

1440
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:22,070
<i>I got frozen peas and a sponge.</i>

1441
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,306
<i>No, Mikey, there's steel
wool on one side.</i>

1442
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:25,440
<i>Shit, you're right.</i>

1443
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,076
<i>Okay, Amanda, you're going to want
to keep the yellow side up.</i>

1444
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:29,941
<i>Otherwise, there's going
to be lots more blood.</i>

1445
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:40,354
<i>I suck cock for gold coins.</i>

1446
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:43,356
<i>So do I.</i>

1447
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:59,107
<i>So what you're saying is, if we go
out there and give 1 10 percent...</i>

1448
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:02,344
<i>A hundred and ten percent!
Fifty percent! Three percent!</i>

1449
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:05,472
<i>I think what Coach is trying to say is
that the key word here is "teamwork."</i>

1450
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:09,105
<i>Luscious, will you whip out your dick
and smack this motherfucker with it?</i>

1451
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,354
<i>- What?
- I love you even more.</i>

1452
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:14,345
<i>- Oh, Anson.

1453
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:16,447
<i>- Me, too.

1454
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:24,956
<i>He's America's favourite cat...
Beezel</i>

1455
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:33,375
<i>I'm embarrassed to even
say this, but...</i>

1456
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,467
<i>What?</i>

1457
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,369
<i>Amy, ever since you moved
in here, l...</i>

1458
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:40,382
<i>- What?

1459
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:42,316
<i>- Oh, Anson.

1460
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:44,215
<i>- Me, too.
- You do?</i>

1461
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:50,080
<i>Beezel! How are you?</i>

1462
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:52,924
<i>How is my handsome little boy?</i>

1463
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:03,405
<i>Hey, Anson, do you ever feel like
your relationship with Beezel...</i>

1464
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:05,168
<i>is a little strange?</i>

1465
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:06,540
<i>Amy!</i>

1466
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:09,310
<i>Please don't tell me
you're one of those girls...</i>

1467
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:11,210
<i>that gets jealous of a guy's pet!</i>

1468
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:14,405
<i>Even if that pet is thuper thilly!</i>

1469
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:18,520
<i>No, no. I just don't think
he likes me very much.</i>

1470
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,189
<i>Come on, Amy. He loves you!</i>

1471
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:22,520
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

1472
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:24,350
<i>There we go.</i>

1473
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:28,220
<i>Now, where were we?</i>

1474
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:38,871
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1475
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:42,465
<i>Nothing.</i>

1476
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:31,559
<i>Get off of me!</i>

1477
01:25:58,553 --> 01:26:00,248
<i>- What happened?
- Beezel...</i>

1478
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:03,455
<i>pissed all over me!</i>

1479
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:05,860
<i>Oh, no, he just sprayed you.</i>

1480
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:09,564
<i>It's something male cats do sometimes.
It means he likes you.</i>

1481
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,499
<i>- He likes me?
- Yeah.</i>

1482
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:14,525
<i>Or it could mean that he's sick.
Buddy, are you sick?</i>

1483
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:17,272
<i>Anson, he did this on purpose!</i>

1484
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:20,975
<i>- I caught him masturbating.
- He was probably just cleaning himself.</i>

1485
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:24,546
<i>It was to pictures of you
in a swimsuit!</i>

1486
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:27,048
<i>Cats can't even process
images in that way.</i>

1487
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:29,584
<i>But he is not a normal cat.</i>

1488
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:30,885
<i>Of course he is.</i>

1489
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:33,945
<i>He just put a fucking
thermometer in his mouth!</i>

1490
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,520
<i>He thinks it's a toy.</i>

1491
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:41,557
<i>Oh, Beezel.</i>

1492
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:45,533
<i>Anson. I love you.</i>

1493
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:48,536
<i>I do, but as long as that
little fucker is around...</i>

1494
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,060
<i>I cannot be with you.</i>

1495
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:52,535
<i>No, Amy, Amy. Look.</i>

1496
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:56,444
<i>If it'll make you happy,
l'll find another home for Beezel.</i>

1497
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:57,570
<i>He's just a cat.</i>

1498
01:26:58,880 --> 01:26:59,972
<i>But you...</i>

1499
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,581
<i>you're the woman that I love.</i>

1500
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:07,318
<i>- You'd get rid of him?
- I will.</i>

1501
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:09,390
<i>- I love you.
- I love you.</i>

1502
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:10,550
<i>No, I love you.</i>

1503
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:36,906
<i>Beezel, where are you, boy?</i>

1504
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,186
<i>Come out, come out,
you little rat-fucker.</i>

1505
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:41,316
<i>Beezel!</i>

1506
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:46,361
<i>Shit, I told my mother we'd
have him there in an hour.</i>

1507
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:48,921
<i>She was nice enough
to take him off our hands.</i>

1508
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,992
<i>- Do you mind checking outside for him?
- Absolutely.</i>

1509
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:53,561
<i>I'm going to go upstairs.</i>

1510
01:27:56,638 --> 01:27:57,969
<i>Beezel?</i>

1511
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:37,444
<i>That's it, you son of a bitch!</i>

1512
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:42,983
<i>Cock-sucking...</i>

1513
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:45,653
<i>motherfucking...</i>

1514
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:48,417
<i>Garfield reject piece of shit!</i>

1515
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:54,187
<i>Die, you...</i>

<i>dick-loving devil cat!</i>

1517
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:08,000
<i>What?</i>

1518
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:10,974
<i>Don't look.</i>

1519
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:14,143
<i>Mommy, she's beating that cat...</i>

1520
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:15,940
<i>to death!</i>

1521
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:18,879
<i>He tried to kill me.</i>

1522
01:29:19,253 --> 01:29:21,050
<i>No, you don't understand.</i>

1523
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:23,880
<i>You don't understand.</i>

1524
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:29,260
<i>Please.</i>

1525
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,856
<i>Get her!</i>
