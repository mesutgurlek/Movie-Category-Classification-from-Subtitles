1
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,152
(Indistinct conversations)

2
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,777
(Sighs)

3
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,155
There he is again.

4
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,906
Almost two decades
and he still comes.

5
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,707
So sad.

6
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,881
How you doing, buddy?

7
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,133
Brought you all
your favorite candies.

8
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,006
Come on, Lloyd,
you gotta get over her!

9
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,021
Mary samsonite was just a girl.

10
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,775
Besides, she's married.

11
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,648
And even if
it had worked out,

12
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,068
would you really want
ginger babies? Ugh.

13
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,654
Gross.

14
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,606
Man, you gotta
give me something!

15
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,782
(Urinating)

16
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,830
(Sighs)

17
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,382
Lloyd, I got something
important to tell you.

18
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,465
I can't come here anymore.

19
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,180
I got kind of a serious
medical problem.

20
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,022
(Mumbling)

21
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,477
It's sort of complicated.

22
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:27,145
Basically, I'm gonna be pretty
busy for the next few months.

23
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,686
Anyway...

24
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,611
You're in good
hands here. So...

25
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,696
Take care, buddy.

26
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,255
(Babbles)

27
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,786
Lloyd, did you say something?

28
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,923
(Muffled) I got you.

29
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,589
That's it, kid.
You can do it.

30
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,342
Come on, come on, come on!
Spit it out!

31
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,185
(Yelling) Got ya!

32
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,548
(Laughs)

33
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,641
(Stammering) What?

34
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,601
You should see the
look on your face!

35
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,766
I got you so good!

36
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,977
- (Stammering) Wait a second!
- (Chuckles)

37
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,738
Are you telling me
that you were faking for 20 years?

38
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,068
Uh-huh.

39
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,823
So you mean that you just wasted
the best years of your life?

40
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,615
(Blows raspberry)
Out the window!

41
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:25,962
And you let me come here every Wednesday
for, like, a thousand weeks,

42
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,253
and it was all
just for a gag?

43
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,129
Uh-huh.

44
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,499
That's

45
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,417
- awesome!
- (Chuckles)

46
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,705
I know!

47
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,878
You gotta admit,
I totally had you suckered, didn't I?

48
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,395
Hook, line and sphincter!

49
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,676
(Both laugh)

50
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,062
- Oh, oh. (Groans)
- Oh! Oh, oh. Oh.

51
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,767
Legs are a little rubbery
after all that time sitting here.

52
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,055
Why don't you
roll me inside?

53
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,603
We'll get the nurse
to take the catheter out of me.

54
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,686
Oh.

55
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,022
I wanna see if my lizard's
still spitting straight.

56
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,568
We don't need
nurses for that. I know how to do it.

57
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,817
- But don't you have to...
- (Grunting)

58
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,154
(Groaning)

59
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,488
(Yelling)

60
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:00,987
Oh, God!

61
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,701
That thing's really taken root!

62
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,662
- (Coughs)
- Hey, fellas!

63
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,085
- Give me a hand over here.
- Sí.

64
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,714
(Huffs)

65
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,580
Yankos Los pee-pee.

66
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,957
Are you sure about this, har?

67
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,498
Usually, doctors like
to do this sort of thing.

68
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,458
Oh, that's just for
insurance purposes.

69
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,678
On three. Three!

70
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:19,932
(All grunting)

71
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,010
(Yelling)

72
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,353
(Harry laughing)

73
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,768
You are a fricking
genius, Lloyd!

74
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,693
I mean, nobody else
could have pulled that off!

75
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,730
- Eh!
- Nobody!

76
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,324
I mean,
the shock treatments, the partial lobotomy!

77
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,282
- That's commitment!
- Yeah.

78
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:40,783
It broke up the monotony.

79
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,064
One thing I don't get, though.

80
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,157
Why did you play it out
for 20 whole years?

81
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,816
Because it wouldn't
have been funny if I stopped too soon.

82
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,495
Comedy is all about timing, har.

83
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:52,214
Yeah, but wouldn't it still have been
funny if you quit after 10 years?

84
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,381
Oh, definitely.
But not as!

85
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,089
- (Both laugh)
- Whoa!

86
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:57,882
Pretty bird.

87
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,716
- Lloyd: Crap on toast!
- Pretty bird.

88
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,262
- Is that grown-up Billy in 4-c?
- Uh-huh.

89
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,641
Come on, siskel,
give me a movie quote.

90
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,511
What did they say
in Jerry Maguire?

91
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,222
"You had me at hello."

92
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,427
Um, Titanic?

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,020
"I'm king of the world."

94
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,561
(Chuckling) Good job!

95
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,228
(Softly) We better
tiptoe past him.

96
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,226
Oh, no, you can't
tiptoe past a blindy.

97
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,905
Their hearing's too good.

98
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,073
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

99
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,896
That's just an
old wives' tale.

100
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,196
Like women shouldn't
smoke during pregnancy.

101
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,277
I turned out fine.
My mom smoked like a chimney.

102
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,297
Especially when
she was drinking! (Chuckles)

103
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,412
Whatever.
Doesn't matter.

104
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,814
Billy's over
the whole petey thing.

105
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,201
You should see his apartment.

106
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,747
He's got the best
rare bird collection in rhody!

107
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:35,918
(Scoffs)

108
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,588
I gotta see this.

109
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,256
Hey, Billy!

110
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,301
I hear you got a lot
of flocking birds.

111
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,636
(Both laughing)

112
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,272
- Is that you, Lloyd?
- (Chuckles)

113
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,430
Very good.

114
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,232
I didn't think
you'd recognize me after all these years.

115
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,936
So what have you
been up to, buddy boy?

116
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,436
Seen any good movies lately?

117
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,817
I mean, you know, like...

118
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,236
On the radio?

119
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,242
- What was that?
- (Squawking)

120
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,729
Did you just feed
them something?

121
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:07,742
Relax.

122
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,044
It's just a little candy.

123
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,579
You can't feed
candy to birds!

124
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,001
Their stomachs will explode!

125
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,620
Even if it's just
a few pop rocks?

126
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,959
Are you crazy?
Pick those up!

127
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,964
- Pick them up!
- All right, all right!

128
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,673
Sheesh.

129
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,173
Well, nice catching up.

130
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,835
See you later.

131
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,592
Not if I see you first!

132
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,137
Lloyd: Ha-ha! Good one!

133
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,313
No, no, no,
it's okay, siskel.

134
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:34,437
Daddy's not gonna let him
get anywhere near you.

135
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,811
- Both: Booga!
- (Screaming)

136
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,899
See? I told you
that hearing thing

137
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,282
- was a wives' tale.
- (Chuckles)

138
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,820
Oh, yeah!

139
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,614
- Hey, who's this?
- Ah.

140
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,282
That's butthole.

141
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,785
I found him out
in the alley a couple years ago.

142
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,486
- Why did you name him butthole?
- Oh.

143
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,505
Because of this.

144
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,045
Oh, yeah. Good name.

145
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Totally fits.

146
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,302
I like what you've
done with the place.

147
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,633
- (Humming)
- Nice cappuccino machine.

148
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:03,878
Who's the astronaut?

149
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,177
Oh, that's my roommate.

150
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:06,894
Roommate?

151
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,552
You got a new roommate?

152
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:11,009
I had to get somebody
to pay your half of the rent

153
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,306
while you were
in the hospital.

154
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,523
How's it going,
ice pick?

155
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,396
Best day ever.
Greatest day of my life, really.

156
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,689
Pick cooks up a rock candy

157
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,984
that will make you dizzy.

158
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,025
Folks come from
all over the city to buy it.

159
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:25,823
It's burning my eyes.

160
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,661
Must be cajun style.

161
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,156
So what's this serious medical problem
you've been blabbing about?

162
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,911
And it better be good.

163
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,366
Lloyd,
there's something...

164
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,542
I've known about
this for a while,

165
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,045
but I didn't
wanna worry you.

166
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,168
- Mmm-hmm?
- (Sighs)

167
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,514
I need a kidney transplant.

168
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,052
No way! Really?

169
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,551
Wow.

170
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,008
So what do you wanna
do for dinner tonight?

171
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,564
Wanna hit haven brothers?

172
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,172
I could eat the mud-hole
out of a dead skunk! (Snickering)

173
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,188
Are you not listening
to me, Lloyd?

174
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,727
Getting a new kidney
is a really big deal.

175
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,072
There's waiting lists,
lots and lots of forms to fill out,

176
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:07,776
and if I can't find
another kidney real soon, I'm dead meat.

177
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,446
Yeah, well,

178
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,616
maybe, just maybe,

179
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:17,205
there's a person
out there who cares about you so much

180
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,792
that said person
would be willing

181
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,634
to give up a little
piece of himself to save your life.

182
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,251
Really, Lloyd?
You'd do that?

183
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:28,258
Me? (Laughing)
Yeah, right! Nice try!

184
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,085
- The nerve!
- Oh.

185
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:35,064
I mean, I would,
in a New York heartbeat.

186
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,077
- I'm just not a urine match.
- (Meows)

187
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,060
My wizz doesn't get
all sudsy like yours.

188
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,268
(Inhales) Ow.

189
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,399
- Wait. Don't panic.
- (Yowling)

190
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,110
- I know exactly what we gotta do.
- (Crashes)

191
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,405
I don't know
about this, Lloyd.

192
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,988
I haven't been home
in over 20 years.

193
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,578
Come on, Harry!

194
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,448
You need a genital
organ match.

195
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,747
They're your parents.

196
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,456
I'm not gonna
go crawling back to them, Lloyd.

197
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,960
Not after what
they did to me.

198
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,079
What did they do?

199
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,671
They threw me
out of the house.

200
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,086
- Why?
- Just because I told them I was gay.

201
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:07,962
Why did you
tell them that?

202
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,500
I was sick of
mowing the lawn.

203
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,628
Oh, yeah.

204
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,886
Well, I don't see
what choice you have.

205
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,512
You either go home
and face the music

206
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,636
or you suffocate
in your own pee.

207
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,475
Yeah, I guess you're right.

208
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,639
Okay, let's do this.

209
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,145
All right. Hop on.

210
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,943
Engage super thrusters!

211
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,272
Don't, Lloyd!

212
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,356
- (Country music playing)
- (Grunting)

213
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,863
Pardon me, Harry.

214
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,987
(Inaudible)

215
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,866
(Brakes screeching)

216
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,672
Here we are.

217
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,632
Place looks smaller
than I remember.

218
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:47,877
Oh, yeah.

219
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,015
Wow.

220
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,343
Lot of memories
on this street.

221
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,676
Yeah.

222
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,513
Remember when we
pulled up on the bike

223
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,053
and parked it
a couple seconds ago?

224
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,220
Yeah, that was cool.

225
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,216
Oh, those were the days.

226
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,891
I remember one afternoon,

227
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,346
it was the first
day of spring,

228
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,649
the flowers were blooming,
the sun was shining

229
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,268
and you and I
were doing cartwheels

230
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,686
right down that
hill over there.

231
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,073
Yeah, I remember that!

232
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,153
- We were in your dad's Lincoln, right?
- Yeah.

233
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,858
(Both laughing)

234
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,821
You totally lost it
when I yanked the wheel.

235
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,486
(Both laughing)

236
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,453
(Both grunt)

237
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,377
Come on! Pick it up!

238
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,881
Show a little
hustle in there!

239
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:33,434
(Both gasp)

240
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,103
Wow. Rong time, Harry!

241
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,351
Oh, sorry.
We'll come back later.

242
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,558
- Hey!
- No, no, no! I mean,

243
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,685
rong time, no see.

244
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,559
- Both: Oh.
- (Both chuckle)

245
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,564
Harry's dad:
Where you been?

246
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,941
Come! Come in!

247
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,897
- (Chuckling) Oh!
- Thanks, dad.

248
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,278
So you see,

249
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,905
my best hope
for a donor match is with a blood relative.

250
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,081
Family.

251
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,408
(Chuckles)

252
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,749
Harry, you not touch
your peanut butter.

253
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,422
Oh, that's okay.
I'm not very hungry, dad.

254
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,089
(Chuckles)
When Harry young,

255
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,881
oh, boy, he loves
the peanut butter.

256
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,089
Oh. (Chuckles)

257
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,129
Three jar a week disappear!

258
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,299
Good to know.

259
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,636
So anyway, which one
of you two's gonna cough up a kidney?

260
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,722
(Speaking cantonese)

261
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,102
What? What was that?
(Laughing)

262
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,059
Wait!

263
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,985
I know! You're the gopher
from caddyshack.

264
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Look at her!
She's got it down!

265
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,236
We love you, Harry.

266
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,990
- Do you love him long time?
- (Chuckles)

267
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,662
But you know you're
not our real son, right?

268
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,237
You adopted.

269
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,463
Ouch. (Whistles)

270
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,498
(Groans)

271
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,424
(Makes creaking noises)

272
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,796
- Dad, what are you saying?
- (Sighs)

273
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,131
Sorry, Harry.

274
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,796
We thought you know.

275
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,353
Wow.

276
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,930
What a nut punch.

277
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,469
Don't be glum, har.

278
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,270
All this means is that your real
parents are out there somewhere.

279
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,985
And I will go to
the ends of the earth to...

280
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,270
Real parents dead.

281
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:10,483
You're boned.

282
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,860
James boned.

283
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,282
Harry's mom: Harry, Harry.

284
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,569
(Speaking cantonese)

285
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,071
(Laughs)

286
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,500
(Snickering)

287
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:30,379
No idea what
you're saying, ma, but right back at you.

288
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,302
Harry, before you go,
your mail piling up for many year.

289
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,338
- Oh.
- We saving for you.

290
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,472
Huh. Junk mail,
junk mail.

291
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,060
(Mumbles)

292
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,179
I got accepted to Arizona state.

293
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,308
- Hmm?
- (Chuckles)

294
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,731
Oh, look at this.

295
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,190
It's a postcard
from fraida felcher.

296
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:52,862
The chick from cranston?

297
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,735
(Chuckling) Ooh!

298
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,526
So, what'd she
have to say?

299
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,410
"Harry, I'm pregnant.
Please call me."

300
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,701
(Gasps) Lloyd,
I'm gonna be a dad!

301
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,042
No way!

302
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:06,237
(Both chuckling)

303
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,206
Look at the postmark.

304
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,709
1991.

305
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,379
Do you know what
this means, Harry?

306
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,594
- You have a grown kid.
- Oh.

307
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,550
With grown kidneys.

308
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,260
But, Lloyd, we don't have
a phone number or address,

309
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,558
or nothing.
And who we fooling?

310
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,175
Even if I find him,
my kid's never met me.

311
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,271
Why would he wanna
give me a kidney?

312
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,438
Are you serious?

313
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,360
After all you've
done for him?

314
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,187
It's the least he can do.

315
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:38,938
What have I ever
done for him?

316
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,775
You gave him his space.
Kids love that.

317
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,581
I didn't wanna be
a helicopter parent.

318
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,405
And you filled him
with wonder.

319
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,247
- Wonder?
- Yeah.

320
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,919
Like, "I wonder who
my deadbeat dad is?"

321
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,590
Oh, it's okay, Lloyd.

322
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,424
I've had a full life.

323
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,295
I was a paperboy
for a week.

324
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,136
I fathered a child.

325
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,765
I've seen every episode
of full house.

326
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,257
(Mouthful) Wow!

327
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,637
Every episode?

328
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,734
Okay, okay.

329
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:13,064
So how are
we gonna do this?

330
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,059
If we find fraida,
we find your kid.

331
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,706
If we find your kid,
we find your kidney.

332
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,110
Simple.

333
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,403
Yeah, but I never even
knew where fraida lived.

334
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,450
I didn't have a car.
She always had to pick me up in her van.

335
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,778
Didn't you meet her
through Pete stainer?

336
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,788
- Who?
- Pee-stain!

337
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,452
He'll know how to reach her.

338
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,620
Yeah, but I haven't
talked to pee-stain in a hundred years!

339
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,790
I can't drop by his house
in the middle of the night

340
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,745
and ask him for
some chick's number.

341
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,337
Sure you can!

342
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,005
Oh, okay. But we gotta
be sub-tull about it.

343
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:46,587
(Chuckles)

344
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,812
The word is pronounced
"subtle," Harry.

345
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:49,929
It's a silent "b."

346
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,483
(Grunts)

347
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:53,598
(Breathes deeply)

348
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:54,694
What was that for?

349
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,648
You had a gah-nat on you.

350
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,651
Maybe we should catch a bus
to pee-stain's house.

351
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,244
We can't. We got the bike.

352
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:05,029
Oh, that's okay. They got bike racks
on the front of buses now.

353
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:06,661
Lloyd: Cool.

354
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,164
(Grunting)

355
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,035
Perfect.

356
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,581
That's very convenient.

357
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,095
Bus driver: Hey, guys!

358
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:20,838
You forgot your bike!

359
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:24,166
Oh, it's not ours. Somebody
abandoned it in front of our place.

360
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:28,013
Yeah. Just left it there
double-chained to a tree.

361
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:32,972
Hey, har.

362
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,926
You wanna hear the second most
annoying sound in the world?

363
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,098
Sure.

364
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,346
(Bell dinging)

365
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,357
Yeah, that's pretty annoying.

366
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:46,614
No, not that.

367
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:47,857
(Screaming)
What the hell are you doing

368
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,187
ringing our doorbell
like that in the middle of the night?

369
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,410
That! (Laughs)

370
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,746
Mr. stainer. Mrs. stainer.
Nice to see you.

371
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,710
Harry, Lloyd.

372
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,206
To what do we owe
the honor at this late hour, gentlemen?

373
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,715
We were just wondering
if pee-stain

374
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,206
wanted to come out
for some suds.

375
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,175
And maybe have
his ass handed to him

376
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,586
in a couple of games
of dig dug.

377
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:08,676
(Both chuckle)

378
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,392
Lloyd.

379
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,720
Peter is dead.

380
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:15,428
Yeah, right.
Since when?

381
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,099
(Both laugh)

382
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,484
Since 1991. Remember?

383
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,566
The motorcycle accident?

384
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,573
But I thought
he pulled through.

385
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,662
The obituary said
he was survived by his parents.

386
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,988
Uh, no. He did
not pull through.

387
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,447
Are you sure?

388
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:36,584
Yes.

389
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,289
Lloyd: Oh, yeah.

390
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,745
You guys are right.
(Chuckles)

391
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,841
Anyway. Sorry about
that whole thing.

392
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,132
Pee-stain and I were
very close friends.

393
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,381
Mr. stainer: Yeah, we know.

394
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,014
You're the one who
sold him the motorcycle.

395
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,263
Lloyd: And if I recall,

396
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:55,893
I made him a sweet deal.

397
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,103
My bike for
his helmet, straight up.

398
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,145
(Chuckling)
That thing was a rocket.

399
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,881
A little squirrelly
on the corners,

400
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,269
but when you got it
on a straightaway...

401
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,355
(Imitating engine revving)

402
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,881
Good night, Lloyd.
Good night, Harry.

403
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:11,781
That was awkward.

404
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,155
You're not kidding.

405
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,874
When somebody comes
to your door at 3:00 A.M.,

406
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,036
- put some pants on!
- (Chuckles)

407
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,331
Hey, wait a second.

408
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:21,118
That's where
I met fraida felcher.

409
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:25,171
She worked at the funeral parlor
where they buried pee-stain.

410
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,169
Wow.

411
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,668
Think about it.

412
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:33,053
If I hadn't sold
that crotch rocket to pee-stain,

413
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,640
you wouldn't have
a bastard child

414
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,470
who's gonna save your life.

415
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:40,485
God's got a pretty warped
sense of humor, huh?

416
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:43,154
Yeah. I bet
he smokes weed.

417
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,317
Otherwise, why would
he put our testicles outside our bodies

418
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:47,528
where someone could do this?

419
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,319
- (Grunts)
- (Laughs)

420
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:50,403
(Grunts)

421
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,836
- (Groans) Ow!
- (Laughs)

422
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:06,998
Bush club!

423
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,421
(Laughs)

424
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,259
What are you doing, Lloyd?

425
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,928
I'm about to meet my kid!

426
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,183
Sorry, har.

427
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,389
Bushes like that
don't come along every day.

428
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,471
(Groans)

429
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:25,016
Excuse me, sir.
Is fraida working today?

430
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,318
- I'm fraida.
- Lloyd: Oh.

431
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,529
Sorry for the confusion.

432
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,781
We meant your
smoking-hot daughter, fraida junior.

433
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,870
There is no fraida junior.

434
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,375
I'm the only fraida
in the family.

435
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,540
(Scoffs) That little
hottie must have given us a fake name.

436
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,539
Look, guys, it's me,

437
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:44,789
fraida felcher.

438
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:45,957
(Laughing)
Yeah, right.

439
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,293
Like we'd be fighting
over those blowfish jowls.

440
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,838
(Both snickering)

441
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,960
No offense.

442
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,421
Harry.

443
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,090
Lloyd.

444
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,225
I'm gonna say
this one more time.

445
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,887
I'm fraida.

446
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,640
(Whispering) Tattoo.

447
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:03,726
Oh, yeah?

448
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,520
- Then show us your tattoo.
- Mmm-hmm.

449
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:08,152
Because fraida had
a cute little smiley face on her back

450
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,115
right above her bikini line.

451
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,815
(Rock music playing)

452
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,125
Well?

453
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,459
Hmm.

454
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,752
- It's close.
- Mmm.

455
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,762
Oh. Hi, fraida.

456
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,299
Oh, hey!
How you been?

457
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,682
Have you been doing yoga?

458
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:40,889
Yeah, I'm kind of busy.
Is there a reason you guys are here?

459
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,601
Yes.

460
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:46,523
I just received this postcard
that you sent me 22 years ago.

461
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,520
- Talk about snail mail.
- (Chuckles)

462
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:54,565
You better come in.

463
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,576
So, did you, uh,
ever have the baby?

464
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,332
- I had a daughter. Named her Fanny.
- (Exhales)

465
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,215
You hear that, har?
A little girl.

466
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,825
- Fanny felcher!
- Ow!

467
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:12,249
- Are you all right?
- Uh, bad back.

468
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,921
Oh, I have so many
questions for you.

469
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,047
Fraida: Like?

470
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,133
Harry: For starters,
how was the pregnancy?

471
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,138
Was it a tough one?
Did they have to saw you open?

472
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,395
Whoa, har.
Dial it down!

473
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,765
We're talking about
the miracle of childbirth here.

474
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,139
What my insensitive
friend meant was,

475
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,598
did you have a c-section

476
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:33,108
or were you able
to have the baby au snatch-urel?

477
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,283
It went smoothly.
(Scoffs)

478
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,538
So, uh, where is she?

479
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,250
Can I meet her?

480
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:48,831
(Sighs)

481
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,536
I gave her up for adoption.

482
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,247
What?

483
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:57,262
- Why?
- Because I was broke and scared.

484
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,676
I regretted it
as soon as I did it.

485
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:01,797
But it was too late.

486
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:04,144
I'd already signed
away all my rights.

487
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:05,565
(Breathes deeply)

488
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:06,771
Then a couple years ago

489
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,440
I wrote her a letter.

490
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,153
But she never
wrote me back.

491
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,020
Wait here.

492
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:16,325
What do we do now?

493
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,737
What do you mean,
"what do we do now?"

494
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:21,448
I mean, at this
exact moment in time, what do we do?

495
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,125
Harry, don't you hear that?

496
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,910
It's the fat lady singing.

497
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:26,327
It's over!

498
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,712
I need something to drink.

499
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:30,541
- But...
- Harry, enough!

500
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,379
We tried and we failed!

501
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,133
As Vince lombardi
used to say,

502
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,341
you gotta know
when to quit!

503
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,921
Hey, you should pick out
one of those coffins while we're here.

504
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,547
- What if...
- Darn it, har!

505
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,764
I cannot live on
this emotional roller coaster any longer.

506
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,719
I feel bad saying it,
but you're slunk meat.

507
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,896
Here's a picture
I found of my daughter online.

508
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:50,393
(Gasps)

509
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,736
Or, we could suck it up,

510
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,065
pick ourselves up
by our bootstraps

511
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,366
and go find
that little girl!

512
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:05,661
(Chuckling)

513
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:06,908
(Mumbles)

514
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:08,042
Hold on.

515
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,080
You wrote her a letter.
You must know where she lives!

516
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:14,043
Yeah. I tracked her
down through this adoption search site.

517
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,586
She was raised by
this hotshot scientist.

518
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:19,375
Why didn't you just go
find her in person?

519
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:20,763
If she doesn't
want to meet me,

520
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,129
I am not going to
force myself on her.

521
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,800
Maybe she didn't
get your letter.

522
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,640
She got it, all right.

523
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,444
Lloyd: What if we go
track her down for you?

524
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,057
There's no lawsuit
against that.

525
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:33,646
Are you guys serious?

526
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:34,984
You'd help me out?

527
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,360
Of course we'll
help you out.

528
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:38,561
We're gonna need
some wheels.

529
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:39,607
I'll lend you a car.

530
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:40,743
Then it's done.

531
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,569
Yeah, using this address
and our superior instincts,

532
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:45,369
you and your little girl
are gonna be having

533
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:46,909
a family reunion in no time.

534
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,195
Cheers!

535
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,200
Whoa! Wait.
Where did you get that?

536
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,111
The slurpee machine
in the back.

537
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,747
That's embalming fluid.

538
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,635
Oh.

539
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,540
Does it have aspartame?

540
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,093
No.

541
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:00,508
Cool.

542
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,716
(Chuckling)

543
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:14,895
Hey, guys,
check this out!

544
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:21,692
(Chuckles)

545
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:25,988
(Growls)

546
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:27,366
(All screaming)

547
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:29,695
(Laughs)

548
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,658
(All laugh)

549
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,669
What about the blue roads
with the big numbers?

550
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,041
Those are rivers.

551
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,167
- They're rivers?
- Yeah.

552
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:41,714
We could get a boat.

553
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,141
Boats are dangerous.

554
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,733
(Tires squeal)

555
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:03,109
This is it.

556
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,857
6765 elmwood.

557
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:07,696
(Sighs)

558
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:15,368
You look nervous.

559
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,165
I am nervous!
I'm about to meet my kid

560
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:18,417
and I don't know
what to say to her.

561
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,750
That's real easy, har.

562
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:22,215
You make a little small talk
about why you missed all those birthdays,

563
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:23,956
holidays and graduations.

564
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,007
Maybe a couple
of dick jokes to put her at ease.

565
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,550
And boing, you hit
her up for the kidney.

566
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,474
Okay. What if
she says no?

567
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:30,636
She's not gonna say no.

568
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,141
She's the fruit
of your loom.

569
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:33,722
(Knocking on door)

570
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,143
(Gasps)

571
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:40,153
Suck me sideways.

572
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:41,898
You're the spitting
image of your mother.

573
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,185
(Chuckles)

574
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,823
You morons.

575
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:48,571
This is the return address.

576
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:52,871
Hers is on the side
with the stamp.

577
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,328
Oh.

578
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,079
But it's still uncanny!
(Chuckles)

579
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,745
(Tires squealing)

580
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,022
Oxford, Maryland, huh?

581
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:25,025
So that's where
my little girl's been living all these years.

582
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,069
Hey, har!

583
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:28,152
Look it.
Giant nutcracker.

584
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:29,357
(Whirring)

585
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:31,026
- Oh.
- (Chuckles)

586
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:34,532
(In deep voice) I want

587
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,791
your nuts,

588
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:39,254
Harry!

589
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:40,708
(Chuckles)

590
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:45,922
Boy, I sure wish I could have been
there for her when she was little.

591
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,094
Whatever.

592
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,552
That's all water under
the fridge now, har.

593
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,756
Think of the bright side.

594
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:52,121
You're finally
getting to meet her

595
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:54,471
and you never had to change
all those poopie diapers.

596
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,676
That's called being
a parent, Lloyd.

597
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:59,927
Besides, I changed
your poopie diapers for 20 years.

598
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,448
(Laughs)

599
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,825
I totally sucked you in.

600
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:16,333
Half the time,
it wasn't even my poop.

601
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:18,117
(Chuckles)

602
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,955
I wonder what it
would have been like to raise a child.

603
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:33,546
Maybe I couldn't afford
to send her to the best public schools,

604
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:36,547
but I'll bet I would have
been a pretty good dad.

605
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,400
You don't need
training wheels. You can do this.

606
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,015
Here we go!

607
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,608
Man: Come on, come on!

608
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:53,362
(All cheering)

609
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:54,447
No way!

610
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:55,951
That was awesome!

611
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,406
Awesome!

612
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,657
Perfect. Okay.

613
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:02,036
One,

614
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:03,502
two,

615
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,711
three.

616
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:07,173
(Groans)

617
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,223
(Chuckling)

618
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:36,567
Hey, Mr. dunne.

619
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:39,027
Hello, Baxter.
How are you? Good to see you.

620
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:40,237
Here you go, honey.

621
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:41,787
- Thank you, Mr. dunne!
- Bye, dad!

622
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,501
- Isn't that good?
- Mmm-hmm.

623
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,578
Lloyd: Mr. dunne!

624
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,262
Mr. dunne!

625
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:54,798
Hey, Mr. dunne!

626
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:57,636
Do you mind?

627
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,099
Bon appétit, kid!

628
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:01,604
(Munching)

629
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,271
(Squeaking)

630
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:15,785
Lloyd!

631
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:17,907
What are you doing?

632
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:20,085
I was trying to
clean off this smudge!

633
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,237
But you know what?

634
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,950
I think it might
be on the inside! (Laughs)

635
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:25,998
- (Exhales)
- (Horn honking)

636
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,290
Announcer: This type
of evening always provides

637
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,456
nonstop surprises.

638
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:32,134
Ah, look who's arrived.
Tom Brady

639
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:35,302
with his gorgeous wife,
Gisele, by his side.

640
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:38,505
Doesn't she look radiant?
Tom's in agreement, I think.

641
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:42,143
Now that is hot.

642
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:43,853
Yep.

643
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:46,523
That's why he gets
all the girls.

644
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:52,942
(Turns off TV)

645
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:01,197
(Inhales deeply)

646
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:03,617
It sure would be nice.
(Exhales)

647
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:05,541
What would be nice, Lloyd?

648
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:07,746
Oh! You know,

649
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,831
if she introduced me to
one of her hot girlfriends.

650
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:11,675
(Chuckling) Girlfriends.

651
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,090
She's 22!

652
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,630
So?

653
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:17,133
So, that's a lot
younger than you.

654
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:18,716
Don't worry,
when we get home,

655
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
I'm gonna fix you up
with someone your own age.

656
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:23,049
My age? Gross!

657
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:25,681
I mean, what would
we talk about?

658
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:28,315
I don't know.
Same stuff you talked about in high school

659
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:30,353
when you took chicks down
to oyster swallow cove.

660
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:31,725
(Laughs)

661
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,403
Oyster swallow cove.

662
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:35,779
There's a trip down
mammary Lane.

663
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:37,528
(Both giggling)

664
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:42,618
Oh, crap!

665
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,029
We gotta get
back to Providence!

666
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:45,538
What? Why?

667
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:46,999
Remember I told you
ice pick had to make

668
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:48,367
that rock candy
run down to Maine?

669
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:49,535
Yeah.

670
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:50,673
I forgot to get someone
to feed butthole.

671
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:51,877
(Scoffs)

672
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,955
Relax. I took care of it.

673
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:55,633
You did?

674
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:58,172
Yeah. Billy in 4-c's
gonna feed him.

675
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:00,627
(Chuckling) Oh, great!

676
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:02,441
Did you give him the key
to our apartment?

677
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:03,509
No.

678
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,425
You think
I want wheel marks all over the rug?

679
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:07,034
I just wrote him a note,
left some food

680
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:09,389
and threw butthole
inside his place when we were leaving.

681
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:14,396
But, Lloyd,
Billy has over a hundred rare birds in there!

682
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:16,072
So?

683
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:18,736
They're not gonna mess
with a 30-pound alley cat.

684
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,072
(Chuckles) Sheesh!

685
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:23,531
Hey, gang! I'm home!

686
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,080
Guys?

687
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,201
(Whistling)

688
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:29,125
You sure are quiet.

689
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:30,965
(Farts)

690
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:34,035
- (Squawks)
- Speak to me, siskel.

691
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:36,459
The horror! The horror!

692
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:43,342
(Horn honking)

693
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:45,804
Are you sure you
don't wanna come, dad?

694
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:48,258
It's not gonna be
nearly as much fun without you.

695
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:50,098
Oh, of course
I wanna come, monkey,

696
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:51,432
but it's out of the question.

697
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
(Coughing)

698
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:54,555
I'm way too
flu-ey to travel.

699
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:57,316
But all the geeky
science guys are gonna be so disappointed.

700
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,819
They were finally gonna
get to meet you in person!

701
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:00,982
Pinchelow: So sorry, honey.

702
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:03,236
Ms. pinchelow,
your car is here.

703
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:04,567
Penny: Thanks, Travis!

704
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,660
Okay!

705
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:08,372
Take care of my dad, Adele.

706
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:10,254
Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa!

707
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,170
Penny, do you have the
speech I wrote for you?

708
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:13,369
I do.

709
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:14,537
Good. Oh!

710
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,226
I almost forgot.
There's one more thing.

711
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:19,132
I want you
to take this box

712
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:22,673
and personally give it to
the head of the conference, Dr. walcott,

713
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:25,761
and say how sorry I am
that I can't be there.

714
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:26,934
Got it.

715
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,890
- Oh, what's in the box, honey?
- Mmm.

716
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:30,854
Just a small gift.

717
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:32,894
Wow, penny.
You're giving a speech?

718
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:35,598
Oh, it's only
a couple of sentences on the last day,

719
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,942
but then I'm picking up
a reward for my dad.

720
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,273
Award, honey.

721
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,781
Did you remember
to bring the atm card I gave you?

722
00:31:41,944 --> 00:31:45,614
Yes. But what's
my pin number again? I keep forgetting.

723
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:47,571
It's 11-11.

724
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:51,576
I thought it had
to be four numbers.

725
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:53,914
There are four numbers.

726
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:57,001
One-one-one-one.

727
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,167
(Horn honking)

728
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:00,632
Time to go!
Come on, penny.

729
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,509
(Barking)

730
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:14,268
Aw!

731
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:19,811
Are you smiling at me?
Are you smiling at me?

732
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,193
He's a good boy!
Yes, he is!

733
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:23,816
Let me see
your purty teeth!

734
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,202
Oh! Say it,
don't spray it!

735
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:27,201
(Chuckles)

736
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:34,411
(Music playing on radio)

737
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:39,962
We're almost there.
The guy told me to get off at the next exit.

738
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,753
Shh. They're picking
the lottery balls.

739
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:45,415
Announcer: Here's today's mega-lottery
picks, worth 34 million dollars.

740
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:48,724
The first number is 44.
The next is 2.

741
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:52,971
38, 24, 21 and 54.

742
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:56,565
Cripes! I was so close!

743
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:59,095
I had all the right numbers,
but in the wrong order.

744
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:05,487
Pinchelow: Honey,
my stomach is killing me.

745
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,152
Can you bring me
some more pepto?

746
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:09,241
I'm making you some
nice warm oatmeal.

747
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:11,165
It will settle your tummy.

748
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:13,663
(Breathes deeply)

749
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:25,756
What are you doing?

750
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,550
I'm fixing lunch
for my husband.

751
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:42,523
That's not enough.

752
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:44,148
(Scoffs)

753
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:47,236
We gotta pick up
the pace a little bit. We want him dead

754
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:50,161
before dumbelina gets back from that
egghead convention, remember?

755
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:51,909
Slow it down.

756
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,870
If we put too much
in at once, it could show up in an autopsy.

757
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:56,082
Not this stuff.

758
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:58,715
I got it from
my twin brother. He's special ops.

759
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:00,422
It's totally undetectable.

760
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:03,592
Now come on.
Let's hurry this up.

761
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:05,877
That way we have
a few extra days to ourselves,

762
00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:07,633
to enjoy our inheritance.

763
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:10,176
Oh, there's gonna be
plenty of time for that.

764
00:34:10,843 --> 00:34:14,013
Five million dollars buys
a lot of champagne.

765
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:17,523
(Moaning)

766
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,311
(Breathes deeply)

767
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:20,523
(Whispering)
Give it to me.

768
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:23,104
(Sighs)

769
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:26,652
(Moans)

770
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,190
You like that,
don't you?

771
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:31,236
Yeah. It's all right.

772
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:32,665
(Moans)

773
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:34,628
I'll be honest.
It's not my favorite thing.

774
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:36,372
(Doorbell dinging rapidly)

775
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:38,414
Who the hell is that?

776
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:43,121
Boy, this is quite
a shack, huh, har?

777
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:45,632
Yeah, but I bet
if you pulled the weeds off the walls

778
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:48,592
and slapped up some aluminum
siding, it wouldn't be half bad.

779
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:51,222
Yeah. Those things
are rat ladders.

780
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:52,928
Adele: Please stop that.

781
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,760
There's a very
sick man in here who's trying to rest.

782
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:59,389
I'm sorry, lady!
We're looking for Fanny felcher!

783
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:01,685
The one with the kidneys.

784
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:02,888
Is she there?

785
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:05,443
There is no one here
by that horrible name.

786
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:06,861
Now go away.

787
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,610
Is this 6765 elmwood Avenue,

788
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:11,443
cranston,
Rhode Island?

789
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,657
Adele:
You're in Maryland.

790
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:15,489
(Groaning)
The side with the stamp!

791
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:18,576
(Stammering) I mean, uh,
is this 1111 foothill road?

792
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,790
That's right.

793
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,080
But there are
no felchers here.

794
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:22,833
This is the pinchelow residence.

795
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:25,078
Wait a second.
My friend Harry here

796
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,710
gave his daughter
up for adoption 20-something years ago

797
00:35:27,878 --> 00:35:29,878
and we were told this
is where she lives.

798
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:31,423
It's kind of a medical

799
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:32,627
emergency that we find her.

800
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,546
- As long as she doesn't have aids.
- (Intercom beeps)

801
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:36,145
Pinchelow: Adele, darling,
whoever they are,

802
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,640
they must be
talking about penny!

803
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:38,971
She was adopted.

804
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:40,388
I'll see them.
Let them in.

805
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:41,516
(Intercom buzzing)

806
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:45,022
What the hell was that?

807
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:47,767
That's exactly
the kind of random crap we don't need!

808
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:48,863
Relax.

809
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:54,948
Would you like some
hot tea with lemon?

810
00:35:55,364 --> 00:35:57,824
Oh, no. I can see
why you might think that.

811
00:35:58,116 --> 00:35:59,866
Two gentlemen
traveling together.

812
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:01,122
But we're straight.

813
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:04,366
Pinchelow:
I must tell you, Harry,

814
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:07,079
this is an unexpected treat.

815
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:08,878
Yeah! Me, too.

816
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:13,166
You know, I always wondered what
penny's natural father was like.

817
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:15,047
When my late wife
and I adopted her,

818
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:17,414
we weren't given
much information about her birth parents.

819
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:20,931
We were only told that her mother
was single and that she was...

820
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,230
You can say it, dear.

821
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:26,726
She was rumored
to be a Titanic whore.

822
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:30,185
That's a lie!
Fraida never stepped foot on the Titanic!

823
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:32,566
They must be talking about the
time she did the night crew

824
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:34,321
on the block island ferry.

825
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:35,453
(Pinchelow laughing)

826
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:36,567
That's good!

827
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:37,663
(Both chuckling)

828
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:39,739
So, is penny here?

829
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:41,118
Unfortunately, no.

830
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,659
She flew out
this morning to El Paso.

831
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:44,498
She's going to
the Ken conference.

832
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,961
What? Who's this Ken guy?

833
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,210
No. No.

834
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:51,087
The Ken conference
is a symposium

835
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:52,553
where the year's
newest technologies,

836
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:53,959
creative concepts and ideas

837
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:55,757
are introduced and discussed.

838
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:57,219
Wow.

839
00:36:57,301 --> 00:37:00,261
That's the single
most boring sentence I ever heard.

840
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:03,007
Adele, what do you say
we call penny right now

841
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:05,478
with the news that
her biological father is looking for her?

842
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:06,981
She'll be so excited.

843
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,859
She might not
be as excited as you think, doc.

844
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:13,111
When her mother
tried to get in touch with her,

845
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:15,195
she sent this letter right back.

846
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:18,154
Pinchelow: Mmm.

847
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,860
That's interesting.

848
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:21,527
What's that, dear?

849
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,370
Uh, nothing.

850
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:24,832
She just, uh,
never mentioned it.

851
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:27,523
But that was
a couple of years ago.

852
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,959
I'm sure she'll appreciate
all the trouble you've gone to

853
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:32,132
to find her.
Let's call her.

854
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:33,169
(Cell phone beeps)

855
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:36,802
(Breathes deeply)

856
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:39,264
- It's ringing!
- (Cell phone buzzing)

857
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:45,064
(Beeps)

858
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,260
(Whispering)
Whoever this is,

859
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,766
we're in the middle
of something really important.

860
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:49,065
Can you call back later?

861
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:50,564
No, I can't call back later.

862
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:53,936
I have something to tell you
that might freak you out a little bit,

863
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:56,113
but this is your dad.

864
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,320
(Whispering)
What? Hold on.

865
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:01,657
Hey, guys,
I know this is weird timing,
but I gotta take this.

866
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,910
It's my dead dad.

867
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,241
She's got me on hold.

868
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,702
Dad, what did you
do with all those penthouses?

869
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:08,828
Did you throw them out?

870
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:10,576
No, they're under
my mattress. Why?

871
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,919
You idiot,
that is penny's phone!

872
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:14,043
Oh.

873
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:15,667
Oh, no. No.

874
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:17,674
No! This is awful!

875
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:19,376
She forgot the package!

876
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,296
What are you doing?
You shouldn't be up!

877
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:23,554
Just relax. We can
overnight it to her.

878
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:25,307
No! No. We can't.

879
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:28,022
The culmination
of my life's work is in this box.

880
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,733
It's much too
valuable to ship.

881
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:32,394
(Stammering)
I thought you said it was just a gift.

882
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:34,226
Oh, it is.

883
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:36,324
A gift to all humanity.

884
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:39,107
- I wanted it to be a surprise, Adele.
- (Exhales)

885
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:41,454
That's why I was
unveiling it at the Ken conference.

886
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,610
Wow.

887
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:44,698
Something like that's gotta
be worth millions, huh?

888
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,330
- Try billions.
- Billions?

889
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:50,002
Pinchelow: Oh, yes.
But I won't get a dime.

890
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:52,579
It would be morally wrong
to profit from this.

891
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,083
Huh?

892
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,956
This box contains one
of the most important

893
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:58,875
discoveries in human history

894
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:01,934
and all mankind deserves
free access to it

895
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:04,589
and that is why
I have relinquished

896
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:06,765
all proprietary rights.

897
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:08,934
Wait, when did you do that?

898
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:10,476
It's all in the speech

899
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,019
that penny's going to read
at the award ceremony.

900
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:15,649
Oh, my God,
that's so nice! (Chuckles)

901
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:20,685
What in God's name?

902
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:23,531
You guys sounded busy,
so we built a couch-fort.

903
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:25,816
You wanna come in,
Dr. p?

904
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:27,451
Sorry, no girls allowed.

905
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:29,696
Boys rule, girls drool.

906
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,196
(Laughing)

907
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,330
Wait a minute.

908
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:35,329
I have an idea.

909
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,754
Why don't we have
Harry and Lloyd

910
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:39,634
- hand-deliver the box to penny?
- (Gasps)

911
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:42,673
That way Harry will
get to meet his daughter in person

912
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:45,088
and you'll be assured
the box gets there safely.

913
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,969
(Chuckles)

914
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:49,435
(Whispering)
Are you insane?

915
00:39:49,598 --> 00:39:53,058
You think I'm just going to hand over my
invention to these 10-year-olds?

916
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:54,813
Oh, don't you worry.
We'll have Travis go with them.

917
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,598
He won't let anything
happen to the box.

918
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:58,522
And he will lead
them straight to penny.

919
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:00,347
Lloyd: You can
count on us, sir.

920
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:02,106
Our word is our bond.

921
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,450
(In deep voice)
James Bond.

922
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:08,951
(Yells)

923
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:10,372
(Both giggling)

924
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,501
I'm going with them?
Why the hell did you tell him that?

925
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:15,834
Do you not realize
what just fell into our laps?

926
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:19,039
Our five million just
turned into a billion.

927
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:20,341
Lloyd: What's wrong
with this thing?

928
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:22,384
Yeah, but he said
he was gonna give it all away.

929
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:25,466
Not if we get to penny
before she reads that speech.

930
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:39,654
Lloyd: Hey,

931
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:42,027
when is this Ken thing, anyway?

932
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:43,439
It actually starts today,

933
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,700
but penny doesn't
give her speech until the night of may 2nd.

934
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:47,449
So that gives us...

935
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:48,948
How many days
are in April?

936
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:50,826
"Thirty days have September,

937
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:52,618
"all the rest
I can't remember."

938
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:55,251
Must be 31 because
nothing rhymes with August.

939
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:56,874
Lloyd: No,
I think it's 32, har.

940
00:40:57,207 --> 00:40:58,417
April's a leap month.

941
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:00,544
- 31.
- 32.

942
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:01,706
- 31.
- 32.

943
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:03,923
- 31. 31, 1, 1, 1!
- 2, 2, 2!

944
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:05,416
30! There's 30!

945
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:06,629
Thank you!

946
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:08,641
You said 31.

947
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,219
Yeah, but I was closer.

948
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:12,216
Travis: Hey, guys,
where's the box?

949
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,769
What box?

950
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,891
The box with
the billion-dollar invention in it.

951
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:19,978
Lloyd, what did you
do with the box?

952
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:21,977
Me? You had it.

953
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:24,105
No, remember we stopped
at that truck stop

954
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:25,754
and we were kicking
field goals with it

955
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:27,149
- out in that parking lot?
- Lloyd: Yeah.

956
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:29,487
I remember I kicked one
over the telephone wires, and you said...

957
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:31,913
You know what,
you're right. I did have it.

958
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,250
- Look at that!
- (Harry gasps)

959
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:40,672
(Sing song)
I just saved humanity!

960
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:43,295
You know what?
Maybe I should hold on to that box.

961
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:45,342
I don't think so, mister.

962
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:47,172
Dr. p encrusted that to me.

963
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,821
And I'm gonna make sure
it gets to my daughter, safe and sound.

964
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:52,847
Yeah, well, you're doing
a great job so far.

965
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:54,933
You guys wanna play
"he who smelt it"?

966
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:56,135
Yeah.

967
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:57,523
What's that?

968
00:41:57,601 --> 00:41:59,771
It's complicated,
so pay attention.

969
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:03,443
We put the windows up,
first one who smells a fart gets a point.

970
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:05,147
If you say who dealt it,

971
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:06,477
double points.

972
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,940
But if you say
you smelled a fart

973
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,028
and nobody farted,

974
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:10,282
like if we were
just passing a slaughterhouse...

975
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:11,452
False fart!

976
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,950
...you lose a point.
And you can't smell your own farts, either.

977
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:17,123
Are you guys kidding?
No! No!

978
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:20,287
I'm not gonna sit around sniffing your
farts like some kinda truffle pig.

979
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:21,422
- Forget it!
- (Chuckles)

980
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,338
Okay, fine. Lloyd and I
will play one-on-one.

981
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,500
Yeah, head-to-head.

982
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:26,206
How can you
play one-on-one?

983
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:27,877
If you smell a fart,
and you didn't do it,

984
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:29,635
isn't it obvious
the other guy did?

985
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,969
I thought you said
you never played before.

986
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:36,177
Yeah. Sounds like
he wrote the rulebook.

987
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:38,223
I think we might have
a hustler here, har.

988
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:39,308
Uh-huh.

989
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:48,154
What are you doing?

990
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:50,856
I forgot.

991
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:52,494
Travis: Uh, you know what?
I'm going to make a rule.

992
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:55,028
There will be no fart games
while I'm in the car, got it?

993
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:56,198
Wow.

994
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:57,696
Who made you
king of the car?

995
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:00,079
I know how to settle this.

996
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:02,207
I'm thinking of a number
between one and three.

997
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:04,002
Whoever guesses it
gets to be king of the car.

998
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:05,214
- One!
- No.

999
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:06,665
- Three?
- Nope.

1000
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:09,508
Okay, what is it?

1001
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:12,008
Two.

1002
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:13,182
(Groans)

1003
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:14,822
(Yelling) I swear
I was gonna say that!

1004
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:17,885
All right, so it's agreed,
I'm king of the car, right?

1005
00:43:18,515 --> 00:43:19,675
Fine.

1006
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:20,775
Excuse me,
your highness,

1007
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:23,231
would you grab me
a slim Jim out of the back?

1008
00:43:23,854 --> 00:43:25,024
One of the long ones.

1009
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:27,606
Travis: Yeah.
(Grunts)

1010
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:30,111
(Both farting)

1011
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,700
Travis: Oh, hey,
what the hell?

1012
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:35,244
Oh, God! Hey!

1013
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:36,865
No! Hey!

1014
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:38,579
(Grunts)

1015
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:40,203
(Screaming)

1016
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,040
What is that?
Oh, God!

1017
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:43,711
(Groaning)

1018
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:45,708
Look, Harry.

1019
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:47,246
He's hooked on crack.

1020
00:43:47,336 --> 00:43:48,546
(Laughing)

1021
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:52,093
Travis: For the love of God,
have mercy!

1022
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:54,803
Herbert: Hello, you've
reached Herbert felcher

1023
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:56,975
at felcher and felcher
funeral parlor.

1024
00:43:57,137 --> 00:43:59,057
- Please leave a message at the beep.
- (Beeps)

1025
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:02,057
Hi! This is
a private message for fraida felcher.

1026
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:04,482
Would you please
tell fraida that Harry called?

1027
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:05,771
Harry dunne.

1028
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:08,733
The guy who knocked her up
20-something years ago.

1029
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:12,152
Um, pleasure finally
meeting you all, by the way.

1030
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:16,663
Anyway, would you
tell her that I've located our daughter.

1031
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,740
(Camera clicks)

1032
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:21,204
She's at a thing called
the Ken conference in El Paso.

1033
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:23,745
The town named
after the bean dip.

1034
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,260
(Baby crying)

1035
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,780
Oh, that's sweet!

1036
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:57,026
Bye, grandma!

1037
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:58,474
(In manly voice)
Have fun, sweetie.

1038
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:03,285
Woman: Now,
there's a real man.

1039
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:06,037
I bet you he don't
pee sitting down.

1040
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:09,128
(Music playing)

1041
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:19,969
(Both screaming)

1042
00:45:21,138 --> 00:45:22,138
(Grunting)

1043
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:25,225
- Don't touch that joystick!
- (Straining)

1044
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:26,642
(Air hissing)

1045
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:29,155
(Both gasp)

1046
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:31,815
Student: Wow, look!

1047
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:36,645
Let my people

1048
00:45:37,154 --> 00:45:38,244
- go!
- (All scream)

1049
00:45:38,322 --> 00:45:39,412
Harry!

1050
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:42,992
(Grunting)

1051
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:45,536
It hurts, Lloyd.
It hurts so bad.

1052
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:47,124
Which one hurts, Harry?
This one? Or this one?

1053
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:48,667
(Groans)

1054
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:51,577
Stop it! Lloyd, please,

1055
00:45:51,877 --> 00:45:53,087
save my daughter.

1056
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,340
And then

1057
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:57,548
I want you to bone her
like a chicken cutlet.

1058
00:45:57,674 --> 00:45:58,934
You hear me, mister?

1059
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:00,676
- (Gasps)
- (Chokes)

1060
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:04,263
(All gasp)

1061
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,016
(Screaming)

1062
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:14,482
Huh?

1063
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:15,648
(All grunt)

1064
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:22,375
(All screaming)

1065
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:26,155
- (Grunts)
- (Groans)

1066
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:30,037
(Gasps)

1067
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:31,577
(All screaming)

1068
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:37,088
(Groans)

1069
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:40,716
Looking for these?

1070
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:42,388
- (Laughs)
- (Sniffles)

1071
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:44,216
(Choking)

1072
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:17,299
(Whistles) Oh!

1073
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,010
What are you doing?

1074
00:47:22,092 --> 00:47:23,642
Oh. Uh...

1075
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:27,596
She's all clean, sir.

1076
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:29,602
You're good to go.

1077
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:31,432
(Muttering)
Nutcase.

1078
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:35,441
Hey, guys.

1079
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:36,772
(Spits)

1080
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:42,783
(Sighs) Let's call a truce, huh?

1081
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:44,613
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

1082
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:47,448
I don't wanna argue
with you guys all the way down to El Paso.

1083
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:49,658
So what do you say?
Peace?

1084
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:53,293
Come on, bring it in!

1085
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:55,749
(Chuckles)
Yeah, why not?

1086
00:47:57,794 --> 00:47:58,844
Hmm.

1087
00:47:58,921 --> 00:47:59,961
Okay.

1088
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:03,008
- Hey, all right. All right, that's good.
- Mmm...

1089
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,930
- All right, all right, all right.
- Aw.

1090
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:07,304
Hey! Have you guys
ever played "funnel nuts"?

1091
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:08,678
What?

1092
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:11,015
Oh, come on.
You guys have had to play funnel nuts.

1093
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:12,978
This is the best game
ever invented.

1094
00:48:13,143 --> 00:48:14,193
Check it out,
you take the funnel,

1095
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:15,851
you put it in the
front of your pants like that, right?

1096
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:19,691
Okay? Then you put a peanut
on your nose like this,

1097
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,358
and then when you're ready...

1098
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,610
No way!

1099
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:24,864
You gotta be kidding!

1100
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:26,675
- That's not right!
- (Travis chuckles)

1101
00:48:27,324 --> 00:48:29,374
The person who gets
the most nuts wins.

1102
00:48:29,493 --> 00:48:30,693
Now, who's gonna
play me first?

1103
00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:32,541
I'll do it. I got it.

1104
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:34,708
- This is mine!
- You always go first!

1105
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:36,003
I got it first!

1106
00:48:36,124 --> 00:48:37,964
Guys, hold on,
all right? Look.

1107
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:40,733
You guys play each
other first, and then I'll play the winner.

1108
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:42,710
All right.

1109
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:45,126
All right.
Here you go.

1110
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:47,339
Take your time.
It takes time.

1111
00:48:47,386 --> 00:48:48,676
Get a good balance on that.

1112
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:49,966
- Okay.
- Look way up high.

1113
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:53,518
Good. Okay,
keep looking at the sky. When you're ready.

1114
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:55,352
Now don't drop it
until you're ready, guys.

1115
00:48:55,477 --> 00:48:56,637
I got it!

1116
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:58,194
(Blowing raspberry)

1117
00:48:58,689 --> 00:48:59,809
- That's weird.
- Ooh!

1118
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:02,527
- The smell of peanuts makes my weenie cold.
- Ooh!

1119
00:49:03,652 --> 00:49:04,692
It shrank mine.

1120
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:05,778
(Chuckling)

1121
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,280
Oh!

1122
00:49:07,531 --> 00:49:08,701
Hey!

1123
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:10,116
(Chuckling)

1124
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:14,079
Do you believe that?
Did you see what he did?

1125
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,660
It's on!

1126
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:18,746
Oh, yeah.

1127
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:20,206
He's going down!

1128
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:23,418
Right after we finish
playing funnel nuts.

1129
00:49:35,601 --> 00:49:36,641
(Whispering) Shh.
Don't wake him up!

1130
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:37,767
I know.

1131
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:42,773
How many did you
put in there?

1132
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:44,941
Just enough to get
a rise out of him.

1133
00:49:45,235 --> 00:49:46,735
(Both giggle)

1134
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:54,412
(Snoring)

1135
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:55,906
(Firecrackers bursting)

1136
00:49:58,457 --> 00:49:59,457
(Screaming)

1137
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:03,547
No! Oh, God!

1138
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:06,261
No! Oh, my God!

1139
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:08,260
(Screaming)

1140
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:14,468
(Both laughing)

1141
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:16,846
(Groaning)

1142
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:18,731
Oh, my God!

1143
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:22,313
Wait, Lloyd.
I think he might be hurt.

1144
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:23,771
(Groaning)

1145
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,280
Man, you okay?
It was just a goof.

1146
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:31,280
Yeah. By the way,
we're even.

1147
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:34,912
I want them dead, now!
Now! Do you hear me?

1148
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:36,622
Adele: (Whispering)
Calm down.

1149
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:38,787
No! No, I can't
take it any longer!

1150
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:40,789
(Exhales)
If you don't let me kill them now,

1151
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:42,254
I am quitting,
and I mean it!

1152
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:44,997
Okay. Give me
some time to think.

1153
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,300
I'll come up with a plan.

1154
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:49,473
Plan? You don't need a plan!
These guys are morons!

1155
00:50:49,633 --> 00:50:52,093
Besides, I told you,
my brother's in special ops.

1156
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:53,601
I know how to
get stuff done!

1157
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:57,684
All right. But make sure nobody
knows they paid us a visit.

1158
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,520
I don't want this
coming back to us.

1159
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:01,145
- God, shut up!
- (Beeps)

1160
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,115
I wonder what's
in this sucker.

1161
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:13,822
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1162
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:16,163
That thing is worth
a fortune! Be careful!

1163
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:17,665
Give it to me.

1164
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:20,461
It would be nice to know
what's in it, though.

1165
00:51:20,622 --> 00:51:22,752
I've been racking
my sack about that.

1166
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,043
I have a theory.

1167
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:25,496
(Chuckles)
Oh, yeah?

1168
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:28,167
He said it was something that would help
everybody in the world, right?

1169
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:29,458
Yeah.

1170
00:51:29,548 --> 00:51:31,968
I think it might be
a baked potato.

1171
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:35,347
How does a baked potato
help everybody in the world?

1172
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,850
That's the only part
I haven't figured out yet.

1173
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:41,230
You'll get it, Lloyd.

1174
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:44,651
We should pick up some
sour cream and chives, just in case.

1175
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:47,251
Do you guys have any
idea where we are?

1176
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:48,399
Not really.

1177
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:51,033
You're the one who told
us to take the shortcut off the highway.

1178
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:53,859
Yeah. It's like you wanted to get
us alone, so you could kill us

1179
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:55,819
and take
the billion-dollar box.

1180
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:57,656
- But what would be the motive?
- (Chuckles)

1181
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,200
Yeah. (Chuckles)

1182
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:01,254
Yeah.

1183
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:03,746
I better get a map
out of the bag, huh?

1184
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:05,544
- Sure.
- Okay.

1185
00:52:07,336 --> 00:52:10,166
Travis: So, guys, who else is helping you
look for your daughter?

1186
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:11,304
- Harry: No one.
- Lloyd: Mmm-hmm.

1187
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:12,381
Travis: Nobody?

1188
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:14,878
- Not even some friends to lend a hand?
- Mmm-mmm.

1189
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:16,589
Nope, just us.

1190
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,560
- What about your wives?
- Lloyd: Wives?

1191
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,310
How stupid do we look?
(Chuckles)

1192
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:23,062
Harry?

1193
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:24,561
Easy.

1194
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:26,938
(Inhales)

1195
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:28,064
(Sighs)

1196
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:31,027
- Close one.
- Any girlfriends?

1197
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:32,398
Been there, done that.

1198
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:35,701
See, we don't want
to be tied down by anything or anyone.

1199
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:37,449
We don't even have
social security cards.

1200
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:39,584
We sold them for 30 bucks
to two Brazilian guys.

1201
00:52:40,077 --> 00:52:41,577
And the good thing
about having no identity

1202
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:44,213
is that you never
have to worry about identity theft.

1203
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,418
He can't even be
identified by his teeth

1204
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,385
because he's never
even been to a dentist.

1205
00:52:48,794 --> 00:52:51,054
And I've never
joined anything. Ever.

1206
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:53,128
That's how you
keep a low-pro.

1207
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:56,087
Yep, there's
no actual proof that we even exist.

1208
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,100
Lloyd: If we died,
no one would even miss us.

1209
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:01,559
We are truly blessed.

1210
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,430
- (Explosion)
- (Tires screeching)

1211
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:07,651
(High-pitched ringing)

1212
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:09,311
(Inaudible)

1213
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:19,074
(Muffled) What the hell
happened, Harry?

1214
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:20,776
What?

1215
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:23,406
What the hell happened?

1216
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:24,703
(Laughing) Whoo!

1217
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,120
Harry: I can't hear you!

1218
00:53:26,331 --> 00:53:27,711
So long, boys.
(Screams)

1219
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,130
(Inaudible)

1220
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:46,016
We may have been
involved in an alien abduction, Harry.

1221
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:47,770
Is your butt okay?

1222
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:49,151
(Gasping)

1223
00:53:50,272 --> 00:53:51,482
Harry!

1224
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:53,018
Holy crap!

1225
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:54,608
He took off on us!

1226
00:53:54,985 --> 00:53:56,155
What?

1227
00:53:56,486 --> 00:53:59,816
He took off on us.

1228
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:01,949
What?

1229
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:05,948
Lloyd: I can't believe
that douchebag stole our hearse.

1230
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:08,792
I hope something
really bad happens to him.

1231
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:11,537
No, but I tried ostrich once.

1232
00:54:12,169 --> 00:54:14,339
Harry, holy cow.

1233
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:16,173
I'm worried about you.

1234
00:54:16,215 --> 00:54:17,635
You're as deaf as a bat.

1235
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:20,723
That's not exactly
how it happened, Lloyd.

1236
00:54:20,886 --> 00:54:23,636
Your mother got
into bed with me.

1237
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:28,017
That's it.
We're getting you hearing aids.

1238
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,360
Receptionist:
May I help you?

1239
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:35,358
Um...

1240
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:38,742
My friend here
would like to visit his sweet ol' grandma.

1241
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:40,528
What's the name?

1242
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:41,867
Lloyd: I'll give you a hint.

1243
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:44,697
She's the one with
the biggest hearing aids.

1244
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:52,331
Ms. snergle,
your grandson and his friend are here.

1245
00:54:55,212 --> 00:54:56,382
This is stupid, Lloyd!

1246
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:58,511
I'm not gonna steal
an old lady's hearing aid!

1247
00:54:58,590 --> 00:54:59,630
(Shushing)

1248
00:54:59,716 --> 00:55:00,926
Relax!

1249
00:55:01,093 --> 00:55:05,223
We're just looking
for a backup pair.

1250
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:07,774
There's gotta be
some around here.

1251
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:13,898
Mikey?

1252
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:16,395
Yeah, gran.

1253
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:17,687
It's Mikey.

1254
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:19,904
Mrs. snergle:
Oh, thank God you're here.

1255
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:22,027
I've got the diamonds.

1256
00:55:22,865 --> 00:55:24,245
Did she say diamonds?

1257
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:25,366
(Clicking tongue)

1258
00:55:26,577 --> 00:55:29,077
Go ahead, granny.
Mikey's listening.

1259
00:55:29,246 --> 00:55:32,416
I want you to
take all the diamonds with you when you go.

1260
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:35,593
I've been hiding them
from those thieving lawyers.

1261
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:36,922
That's good.

1262
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:38,757
Granny did a good thing!

1263
00:55:38,922 --> 00:55:41,052
So, where are the rocks?

1264
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:42,928
They're underneath me.

1265
00:55:42,968 --> 00:55:44,088
You mean, under the bed?

1266
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:46,219
- No, under the blanket.
- Oh.

1267
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:50,766
(Moans)

1268
00:55:51,894 --> 00:55:53,064
I'm not finding anything.
(Chuckles)

1269
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:55,058
Go up more.

1270
00:55:56,565 --> 00:55:58,155
- Up here?
- Keep going.

1271
00:55:59,735 --> 00:56:01,325
Did you hide them
inside this Turkey?

1272
00:56:01,653 --> 00:56:02,783
Yeah, right.

1273
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,780
- (Inhales)
- Wait.

1274
00:56:05,073 --> 00:56:06,453
There's no diamonds here!

1275
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:09,157
And you're not my grandson!

1276
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,120
Harry, she's got me.

1277
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:13,077
She's really clamping down!

1278
00:56:13,332 --> 00:56:14,332
(Grunts)

1279
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:16,085
- Ahhh!
- (Gasps)

1280
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:17,626
(Shuddering breath)

1281
00:56:18,086 --> 00:56:19,246
Lloyd?

1282
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:20,461
(Giggling)

1283
00:56:20,547 --> 00:56:21,627
I think that was her gran-Gina.

1284
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:22,843
That's right!

1285
00:56:23,008 --> 00:56:25,968
So you can cross that one
off your bucket list!

1286
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:29,137
- (Blows)
- (Both coughing)

1287
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:32,811
Hey, goldfinger!

1288
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,060
Here. (Chuckles)

1289
00:56:35,312 --> 00:56:37,312
You've earned them.
(Giggling)

1290
00:56:46,365 --> 00:56:47,825
Are you serious?

1291
00:56:48,116 --> 00:56:49,776
Travis is dead?

1292
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,200
Lippincott: That's right.

1293
00:56:51,328 --> 00:56:53,248
The Kansas state police
informed me this morning.

1294
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:55,000
- I thought you'd want to know.
- (Sighs)

1295
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:58,666
Thank you,
captain lippincott.

1296
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:02,214
I know it's never easy
to relay this kind of sad news.

1297
00:57:02,548 --> 00:57:04,588
But I want you to know
that your brother, Travis,

1298
00:57:04,675 --> 00:57:06,515
was more than just
a handyman to us.

1299
00:57:06,677 --> 00:57:07,837
He was

1300
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:09,802
family.
(Chuckles)

1301
00:57:10,347 --> 00:57:11,467
Lippincott: Really?

1302
00:57:11,974 --> 00:57:15,194
Do you suck the toe jam
off mommy and daddy, too?

1303
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:18,481
Um, I beg your pardon?

1304
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:20,899
My brother told me everything.

1305
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,400
(Gasps)

1306
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:26,173
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1307
00:57:26,238 --> 00:57:28,658
Look, lady, I know
you're terminating your husband.

1308
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:30,739
I'm the one who
supplied you with the untraceables.

1309
00:57:31,076 --> 00:57:32,656
Remember? I also know

1310
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:35,373
that my brother
was supposed to eliminate those two idiots,

1311
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:37,826
but somehow they
turned the tables on him.

1312
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:40,211
Relax.

1313
00:57:40,377 --> 00:57:41,707
I'm not here to turn you in.

1314
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:44,008
I'm here to help you out.

1315
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:50,604
So how are those
things working?

1316
00:57:50,721 --> 00:57:52,511
Not bad.
I can hear you a little.

1317
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:53,891
Here, let me turn them up.

1318
00:57:57,728 --> 00:57:59,768
Honey, would you
like some pancakes?

1319
00:58:00,397 --> 00:58:01,727
Yeah, I'd love some pancakes.

1320
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:02,939
- What?
- (Screams)

1321
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:06,396
- Stop yelling! (Groans)
- I'm not yelling.

1322
00:58:06,695 --> 00:58:08,105
Why would you say
I'm yelling?

1323
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,910
(Yelling)
This is yelling!

1324
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:11,987
(Groaning)

1325
00:58:13,243 --> 00:58:14,453
Harry!

1326
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:18,623
I think I might have
turned them up too high!

1327
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:23,093
Oh, look!
Barbara hershey highway. (Chuckles)

1328
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:25,800
Wait a minute.

1329
00:58:26,757 --> 00:58:28,797
I think I know where we are.

1330
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:30,434
Follow me.

1331
00:58:37,935 --> 00:58:39,645
Are you sure about this, Lloyd?

1332
00:58:39,811 --> 00:58:43,611
Positive. The kid worked at the hockey
rink just past the museum.

1333
00:58:45,442 --> 00:58:46,652
Come on, Harry!

1334
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:50,158
He drove a zamboni!

1335
00:58:54,451 --> 00:58:56,121
(Both gasp)

1336
00:58:58,956 --> 00:59:02,076
Oh, my God.
I never thought I'd see her again.

1337
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:04,673
I don't know if
I told you this, har,

1338
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:07,855
but that kid kinda porked me when I
traded him for the mini bike.

1339
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:10,965
And he only gave me
a quarter-tank of gas.

1340
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:15,312
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

1341
00:59:15,931 --> 00:59:17,181
(Tires squeal)

1342
00:59:26,817 --> 00:59:28,107
(Brakes screech)

1343
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:30,529
(Breathing heavily)

1344
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:39,164
(Horn honking)

1345
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:42,541
Yeah!

1346
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:45,496
(Horn honking)

1347
00:59:56,597 --> 00:59:57,887
(Snoring)

1348
00:59:59,558 --> 01:00:00,678
Bush club!

1349
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:01,976
Bush club! Bush club!
Bush club!

1350
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:03,352
(Groaning)

1351
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:04,647
(Laughing)

1352
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:18,539
I feel really good, har.

1353
01:00:18,577 --> 01:00:19,697
Me, too!

1354
01:00:19,745 --> 01:00:21,205
Really good!

1355
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:23,668
You might want to
step on it, har!

1356
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:25,711
(Panting)

1357
01:00:25,876 --> 01:00:27,126
(Grunting)

1358
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:30,799
(Horn honking)

1359
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,019
(Horn honking)

1360
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:51,899
Wow, look at all the brains.

1361
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:54,069
(Sing song)
They're blinding me with science!

1362
01:00:54,238 --> 01:00:56,598
Okay, Lloyd.
I'm gonna find out
what time this thing starts.

1363
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:57,950
You keep an eye
out for penny.

1364
01:00:58,075 --> 01:00:59,245
Roger that.

1365
01:00:59,785 --> 01:01:02,585
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is an Amber alert.

1366
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:06,616
Has anybody seen
this lovely, delicate angel?

1367
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:09,252
Have you seen her?
Lovely and delicate.

1368
01:01:09,419 --> 01:01:11,129
This girl is slammin'.

1369
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:14,264
Oh, yeah, sure,
I know her.

1370
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:15,429
I got a hit.

1371
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:16,507
It's, uh,
penny pinchelow.

1372
01:01:16,593 --> 01:01:17,793
I met her at
the bar yesterday.

1373
01:01:17,886 --> 01:01:19,046
What's that supposed to mean?

1374
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:20,764
Whoa! Easy, hoser!

1375
01:01:20,848 --> 01:01:21,888
We just hung out a little.

1376
01:01:22,432 --> 01:01:23,602
Oh.

1377
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:26,695
Do you happen to know
where she is right now?

1378
01:01:26,979 --> 01:01:29,419
Yeah, my, uh, friends
just went to meet her at her hotel room.

1379
01:01:29,565 --> 01:01:30,575
They're walking
her over here.

1380
01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:31,767
She's giving
a speech tonight.

1381
01:01:31,942 --> 01:01:33,072
When you see her,

1382
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,280
tell her that Lloyd
and her dad are looking for her.

1383
01:01:35,445 --> 01:01:37,655
And get her to
call me on this.

1384
01:01:39,157 --> 01:01:40,277
Lloyd: There you are!

1385
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:43,187
I've been looking
all over for you.

1386
01:01:43,745 --> 01:01:44,905
Cool!

1387
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:46,795
I just ran into
a Mexican guy who knows penny.

1388
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:47,924
He said she's on her way!

1389
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:49,465
Come on,
let's get in line.

1390
01:01:49,501 --> 01:01:51,001
(Softly) Dressed like this?

1391
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:53,593
Harry, people who
come to these things are smart.

1392
01:01:54,423 --> 01:01:56,633
We can't go in there
looking like a couple of goofballs.

1393
01:01:56,842 --> 01:01:59,222
Oh, yeah. Let's go buy
some smart stuff.

1394
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:19,073
How's your day?

1395
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,160
Living the dream.

1396
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:28,670
Ooh, that Mac and
cheese looks good!

1397
01:02:32,503 --> 01:02:35,843
Um, I think I'm gonna
need some chopsticks

1398
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:38,681
or a really,
really skinny fork.

1399
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:40,509
You got it.

1400
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:42,184
(Knock on door)

1401
01:02:42,221 --> 01:02:43,431
It's open!

1402
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:44,894
Hey, penny!

1403
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:47,095
Hey, tom!
Hey, Gus!

1404
01:02:47,184 --> 01:02:49,354
Hey, uh,
penny. Um...

1405
01:02:49,895 --> 01:02:51,175
What are you doing
in your undies

1406
01:02:51,188 --> 01:02:52,358
in front of the room
service guy here, eh?

1407
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:53,571
(Both chuckle)

1408
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:54,862
You don't know him.

1409
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,030
Oh, no. Someone told me this great
trick about how not to get nervous

1410
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:59,450
when you're giving a speech.

1411
01:02:59,613 --> 01:03:01,873
All you do is imagine
that you're in your underwear.

1412
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:04,369
So I've been practicing
all afternoon.

1413
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:05,915
Will there be
anything else, ma'am?

1414
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:07,906
Oh, no.
Just that skinny fork.

1415
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:09,462
Right.

1416
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:11,210
Okay. Burning daylight.

1417
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:13,791
Yeah. Oh! Great news.
Your dad showed up for the conference.

1418
01:03:14,253 --> 01:03:15,303
(Gasps) What?

1419
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,500
Yeah, gordy just called us.

1420
01:03:16,547 --> 01:03:18,877
He ran into some
guy named Lloyd who was with your father.

1421
01:03:18,924 --> 01:03:21,554
They were looking
for them out front of the convention hall.

1422
01:03:26,807 --> 01:03:28,727
Barbara:
Oh, my goodness.

1423
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:31,266
Are you absolutely certain?

1424
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:33,612
And there's no way
you're mistaken?

1425
01:03:34,565 --> 01:03:36,695
All right, um, yes,
then I'll have someone

1426
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:38,073
meet him at the
door in a hurry.

1427
01:03:38,151 --> 01:03:39,941
(Chuckles)
Yes, okay. Goodbye.

1428
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:41,280
What is it?

1429
01:03:41,405 --> 01:03:42,995
Dr. pinchelow is coming.

1430
01:03:43,073 --> 01:03:45,663
What? Are you certain?
I thought he was sick!

1431
01:03:45,742 --> 01:03:46,912
Apparently he's better.

1432
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:48,454
I just spoke with
his daughter, penny, on the phone

1433
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:49,949
and she's headed
right over here to meet him.

1434
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,240
Oh, the man didn't
even show up for his nobel ceremony.

1435
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:55,131
He showed up for us.
Go find him.

1436
01:03:55,419 --> 01:03:56,799
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I'm on it.

1437
01:04:03,677 --> 01:04:04,757
Lloyd, look!

1438
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,600
Penny is speaking soon.

1439
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:09,519
- That's so hot.
- (Chuckles)

1440
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:20,359
Adele: Is it done?

1441
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:21,775
(Sighs) No.

1442
01:04:22,112 --> 01:04:24,662
Some Canadian douchebags
barged in before I could finish her.

1443
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:27,953
Okay.

1444
01:04:28,035 --> 01:04:31,625
You follow penny,
and the next chance you get, kill her.

1445
01:04:31,788 --> 01:04:33,498
I'll take out the guys,
get the box.

1446
01:04:33,874 --> 01:04:35,794
What if they have
already gone into the Ken conference?

1447
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:37,004
Not a chance.

1448
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:40,297
The event's been sold out for over a
year, and the security is insane.

1449
01:04:40,339 --> 01:04:41,629
Tickets, please.

1450
01:04:41,882 --> 01:04:43,302
No, thank you.

1451
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:45,142
We're not much
for boring speeches.

1452
01:04:45,302 --> 01:04:48,052
We just have to make sure
that his daughter gets this box.

1453
01:04:48,305 --> 01:04:51,525
No tickie, no entry.
No exceptions.

1454
01:04:53,644 --> 01:04:55,154
Barbara: Have you found
Dr. pinchelow yet?

1455
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:57,229
No. I don't even know
what he looks like.

1456
01:04:57,397 --> 01:04:58,397
This is ridiculous.

1457
01:04:58,482 --> 01:05:00,192
How am I supposed
to find the man in this throng

1458
01:05:00,317 --> 01:05:03,067
when all I know
about him is that he wears hearing aids?

1459
01:05:03,237 --> 01:05:06,157
Great. It's sold out.
I'm dead.

1460
01:05:07,324 --> 01:05:09,034
So much for
higher education.

1461
01:05:09,493 --> 01:05:10,743
(Groans)

1462
01:05:12,162 --> 01:05:13,252
Relax, har.

1463
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:16,420
We're gonna find her.
Don't get that dying kidney all worked up.

1464
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,920
Oh, it's not the kidney.

1465
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:19,421
I think I gotta
pinch a loaf.

1466
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:22,380
Pinchelow?
Did someone say pinchelow?

1467
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:24,513
Oh, my goodness,
it is you!

1468
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:27,055
You're really here!
I'm Dr. meldmann.

1469
01:05:27,177 --> 01:05:28,427
How was your trip
from Maryland?

1470
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,760
Not so great.

1471
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:32,217
Somebody stole our car
and he finger-bombed an old lady.

1472
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:33,557
(Chuckles)

1473
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:35,274
Sounds terrible.

1474
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:37,022
We'll take really
good care of you now that you're here.

1475
01:05:37,104 --> 01:05:38,484
Uh, would you like
to go into the foyer

1476
01:05:38,522 --> 01:05:40,162
for the cocktail reception,
Dr. pinchelow?

1477
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,317
- Oh.
- Yes, Dr. pinchelow would love to go

1478
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:44,109
to the foyer for
the cocktail reception.

1479
01:05:44,278 --> 01:05:46,198
Yeah, cool.
Let's get ripped.

1480
01:05:47,614 --> 01:05:49,744
(Clears throat)
Uh, this way, please.

1481
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:52,037
I'm sorry, your name is?

1482
01:05:52,244 --> 01:05:54,044
I'm his associate,
Dr. Christmas.

1483
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:55,711
Ah, Christmas like the holiday?

1484
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:57,709
No. (Chuckles)
Like the tree.

1485
01:05:58,208 --> 01:05:59,208
(Dr. meldmann chuckles)

1486
01:05:59,543 --> 01:06:00,823
May I ask you
a question, doctor,

1487
01:06:00,878 --> 01:06:02,378
and I don't mean
to be insensitive,

1488
01:06:02,421 --> 01:06:05,301
but, uh, does Dr. pinchelow
have asperger's?

1489
01:06:05,465 --> 01:06:06,715
Probably.

1490
01:06:06,884 --> 01:06:09,054
I know he doesn't
wipe real well.

1491
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:15,227
Why don't you gentlemen
make yourselves at home.

1492
01:06:15,267 --> 01:06:17,727
I'm gonna go fetch
the, uh, director of the conference,

1493
01:06:17,769 --> 01:06:19,189
Dr. Barbara walcott.

1494
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:20,899
She can't
wait to meet you.

1495
01:06:20,981 --> 01:06:24,321
Dr. Barbara?
A lady doctor? Seriously?

1496
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:26,571
Lady doctor,
that always cracks me up.

1497
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:28,663
Yeah, doctor of doing
the laundry, maybe.

1498
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:29,739
Am I right?

1499
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:31,075
(Both snickering)

1500
01:06:31,783 --> 01:06:32,993
I'll be right back.

1501
01:06:34,745 --> 01:06:36,125
What were you
thinking, Lloyd?

1502
01:06:36,205 --> 01:06:37,585
Now he thinks
we're doctors.

1503
01:06:37,623 --> 01:06:39,253
At least we're in the door.

1504
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:41,376
Now all we gotta do
is act intelligent. We'll fit right in.

1505
01:06:41,418 --> 01:06:42,418
Okay.

1506
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:43,923
(Music playing)

1507
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:46,585
Hi, barkeep.

1508
01:06:46,757 --> 01:06:48,967
- How much for a beer?
- It's gratis.

1509
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:50,181
Ooh.

1510
01:06:50,302 --> 01:06:51,682
That sounds expensive.

1511
01:06:52,596 --> 01:06:54,176
Can you give us a moment?

1512
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:57,103
Lloyd, we blew our money
on the graduation robes.

1513
01:06:57,142 --> 01:06:58,312
Maybe we shouldn't drink.

1514
01:06:58,435 --> 01:07:00,185
No way.
I need booze, man.

1515
01:07:00,437 --> 01:07:01,937
If I meet your daughter
without a buzz on,

1516
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,150
she'll think I'm an idiot.

1517
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:04,232
(Huffs)

1518
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:06,859
Lloyd: Hey,
wait a minute!

1519
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:09,858
What about the old stinkeroo?

1520
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:12,033
- (Sighs) Yeah, I'm in.
- (Chuckles)

1521
01:07:24,086 --> 01:07:25,456
(Scratching)

1522
01:07:30,217 --> 01:07:31,377
(Exhales)

1523
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:33,178
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?

1524
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:34,473
This beer smells funky.

1525
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:35,855
Can I have a new one, please?

1526
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:37,563
What do you mean "funky"?

1527
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:39,485
Go ahead, take a sniff.

1528
01:07:39,518 --> 01:07:40,808
(Sniffs) Ew!

1529
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:44,654
I'll get you a freshie.

1530
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:46,361
Mine is stinky, too.

1531
01:07:51,613 --> 01:07:52,953
(Gagging)

1532
01:07:53,532 --> 01:07:55,412
Yours smells even worse!

1533
01:07:55,534 --> 01:07:56,534
(Chuckles)

1534
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:57,660
I'll be right back.

1535
01:07:58,328 --> 01:07:59,868
"Yours smells even worse."

1536
01:07:59,997 --> 01:08:01,157
- Thanks!
- (Both chuckling)

1537
01:08:01,373 --> 01:08:02,713
You're really good
at that, Lloyd.

1538
01:08:03,167 --> 01:08:04,377
I learned from the best.

1539
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:06,175
Thanks, mom.

1540
01:08:06,587 --> 01:08:08,337
I can't wait to see
what's in this.

1541
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:10,762
- Yeah. Hey, har?
- Mmm?

1542
01:08:10,924 --> 01:08:12,014
Do you know how long
you have to wait

1543
01:08:12,092 --> 01:08:14,092
after kidney surgery
to have sex?

1544
01:08:14,178 --> 01:08:15,848
I don't think I'll
have to wait too long.

1545
01:08:16,013 --> 01:08:18,263
No, not you.
I meant the donor chick.

1546
01:08:19,224 --> 01:08:21,394
- What are you talking about?
- Okay! Fine!

1547
01:08:21,518 --> 01:08:22,768
Let's just drop it!

1548
01:08:22,853 --> 01:08:24,233
Here you go, doctors.

1549
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:25,691
Fresh beers.

1550
01:08:25,856 --> 01:08:29,526
And I also brought you
some hydroponically grown goji berries

1551
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:31,030
with vegan barbecue sauce

1552
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:33,411
and some organic
pumpkin chips. Enjoy.

1553
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:34,910
- Why, thank you!
- Mmm.

1554
01:08:36,783 --> 01:08:38,123
Both: Mmm.

1555
01:08:40,037 --> 01:08:41,037
Mmm.

1556
01:08:41,246 --> 01:08:42,956
- These are salty.
- Mmm-hmm.

1557
01:08:43,081 --> 01:08:44,291
Try these.

1558
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:48,714
Mmm.

1559
01:08:49,087 --> 01:08:50,587
Yours are super tangy.

1560
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:52,881
I like it a lot.

1561
01:08:53,884 --> 01:08:55,094
Dr. meldmann: Gentlemen.

1562
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:56,679
I'd like you to meet
the director of the conference,

1563
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:57,800
Dr. Barbara walcott.

1564
01:08:57,888 --> 01:08:59,808
And, Barbara,
this is Dr. pinchelow

1565
01:08:59,973 --> 01:09:02,103
and his associate,
Dr. Christmas.

1566
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:05,727
Wonderful.
It is a high honor to meet you both.

1567
01:09:05,812 --> 01:09:08,272
Wow. Great accent, doc.
Where you from?

1568
01:09:08,398 --> 01:09:09,728
England. Surrey.

1569
01:09:09,942 --> 01:09:12,402
Oh, no need to apologize.
That was years ago.

1570
01:09:12,444 --> 01:09:15,034
We kicked your butt anyway,
so we're cool with it.

1571
01:09:15,072 --> 01:09:16,992
(Both laugh)

1572
01:09:17,074 --> 01:09:18,284
(Laughs)

1573
01:09:18,492 --> 01:09:19,772
Barbara: Oh,
you're a leg-puller!

1574
01:09:19,785 --> 01:09:20,995
(Chuckles)

1575
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:22,399
Let's get you both
to your seats.

1576
01:09:22,412 --> 01:09:24,752
Professor garabedian's
Ken talk is about to begin.

1577
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:28,845
Now, the existence
of dark matter is largely inferred

1578
01:09:28,919 --> 01:09:32,169
from the gravitational
effect on visible matter

1579
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:36,379
and the gravitational
lensing of background radiation.

1580
01:09:36,426 --> 01:09:38,426
We saved two seats
for you at the end of the second row.

1581
01:09:38,512 --> 01:09:39,512
Just there.

1582
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:45,021
...because they were
trying to figure out the discrepancies...

1583
01:09:45,102 --> 01:09:46,462
You could actually
go in the front.

1584
01:09:46,478 --> 01:09:48,188
- Harry: Coming through.
- Lloyd: My bad!

1585
01:09:48,438 --> 01:09:49,808
Here we go. Oops!

1586
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:51,780
Wow. Is that silk?

1587
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,030
(Laughs)

1588
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:55,529
That sucks!

1589
01:09:56,154 --> 01:09:57,954
That's good. Sorry.

1590
01:09:58,532 --> 01:09:59,702
Watch my knee.

1591
01:09:59,783 --> 01:10:01,283
We make a better door
than a window, don't we?

1592
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:02,410
(Talking)

1593
01:10:02,536 --> 01:10:04,446
Lloyd: I hope this isn't
your favorite part.

1594
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:06,670
Harry: There are a couple
of hotties over here.

1595
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:08,210
- I got it! (Yelling)
- Oh!

1596
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:09,829
(Chuckles)

1597
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:11,797
That was easy!

1598
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:15,336
That Dr. pinchelow
is certainly a fascinating character.

1599
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:17,627
Of course he is.
He's a genius.

1600
01:10:17,968 --> 01:10:22,348
Indeed, the
large hadron collider has already shown us

1601
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:24,474
that dark matter is likely...

1602
01:10:24,641 --> 01:10:26,141
Especially when you eat prunes!

1603
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:27,886
- (Farting noises)
- (Chuckles)

1604
01:10:27,978 --> 01:10:29,018
Yes. (Chuckles)

1605
01:10:29,646 --> 01:10:32,316
(Stammering)
That dark matter is likely...

1606
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:34,479
- (Farting noises)
- (Chuckles)

1607
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:37,398
...the missing piece
of the puzzle

1608
01:10:37,571 --> 01:10:41,161
that physicists have been
searching for, for years.

1609
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:44,080
Both: (Chanting) Nerd!

1610
01:10:44,161 --> 01:10:46,041
- Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!
- (Crowd mumbling)

1611
01:10:46,163 --> 01:10:48,083
Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!

1612
01:10:48,165 --> 01:10:49,425
Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!

1613
01:10:49,499 --> 01:10:51,839
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1614
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:53,632
Holy crap!

1615
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:55,030
(Chuckling)
Did that come from you?

1616
01:10:55,088 --> 01:10:58,548
Dr. garabedian
is a world-renowned astrophysicist

1617
01:10:58,884 --> 01:11:01,854
and many of us
are interested in hearing his findings.

1618
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:04,210
- I'm reading his mind. Mmm-hmm.
- I'm picking it up, too.

1619
01:11:05,349 --> 01:11:07,059
Who is that?

1620
01:11:07,226 --> 01:11:08,846
(Whispering)
It's Dr. pinchelow!

1621
01:11:10,521 --> 01:11:11,731
Bernard pinchelow?

1622
01:11:13,106 --> 01:11:14,146
Automated voice:
Dark matter is not a joke.

1623
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:15,231
(Squeaks)

1624
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:18,609
Your antics are proving
to be disruptive.

1625
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:21,195
Thank you, Dr. dilbeck,

1626
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:23,783
but Dr. pinchelow is right.

1627
01:11:24,576 --> 01:11:25,866
My dark matter data
was insufficient.

1628
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:27,254
(Crowd murmuring)

1629
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:29,078
What the fuck?

1630
01:11:30,415 --> 01:11:32,205
My methods were sloppy.

1631
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:35,250
- I'm a hack.
- (Crowd gasps)

1632
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,260
(Sobbing)
I'm really sorry.

1633
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:43,087
See?

1634
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:44,893
- Eat me.
- Suck it!

1635
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:47,474
- You wish.
- Lloyd. Lloyd.

1636
01:11:47,558 --> 01:11:49,888
Thank you,
Professor garabedian.

1637
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:52,645
That's what
the Ken conference is all about.

1638
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:53,769
Truth.

1639
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:55,897
But I will ask that
everyone please behave

1640
01:11:55,983 --> 01:11:57,733
in a professional
and dignified...

1641
01:11:57,776 --> 01:11:59,396
Both: Show us your tits!

1642
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:00,486
(Crowd gasps)

1643
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:02,532
- Harry: Both of them!
- Lloyd: (Chuckling) Yeah!

1644
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:05,778
We're just gonna take
a short two-minute break. Thank you!

1645
01:12:06,535 --> 01:12:07,745
(Chuckling)

1646
01:12:07,786 --> 01:12:08,906
Man.

1647
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:10,246
Hey, this is great!

1648
01:12:10,289 --> 01:12:12,499
We're learning so much
about dark matter.

1649
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,503
- (Farting noise)
- (Laughing)

1650
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:15,635
Yes, indeed.

1651
01:12:15,752 --> 01:12:16,922
Uh, I'm sorry,
Dr. pinchelow,

1652
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:19,962
but we can't seem
to find Dr. Christmas on the roster.

1653
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:21,760
Oh, that's okay.
He's with me.

1654
01:12:22,092 --> 01:12:26,012
Due to security concerns
everyone must be on the list to get in.

1655
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:27,970
It's all right, doctor.

1656
01:12:28,932 --> 01:12:31,102
I think I know a shakedown
when I see one.

1657
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:32,480
I'll tell you what.

1658
01:12:32,603 --> 01:12:35,943
I'm gonna write an iou
and I'm gonna leave it blank.

1659
01:12:36,481 --> 01:12:37,611
Anybody have a pen?

1660
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:40,281
There are no exceptions.

1661
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:41,954
Really?

1662
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:43,197
I'll tell you what, warden.

1663
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:44,780
If I'm leaving,

1664
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:47,328
then my steamed colleague
is leaving with me.

1665
01:12:47,451 --> 01:12:48,661
No, he's not.

1666
01:12:50,787 --> 01:12:51,957
Quick conference.

1667
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:56,959
(Whispering)
What are you doing, har?

1668
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:59,461
- You're killing me!
- Lloyd, I can't leave.

1669
01:12:59,505 --> 01:13:02,385
Penny is gonna
be speaking soon. I wanna meet her!

1670
01:13:02,466 --> 01:13:03,546
What?

1671
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:05,304
How come you get to
meet her before I do?

1672
01:13:06,345 --> 01:13:08,475
Lloyd, this is about me.

1673
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:10,024
Me, my daughter and my kidney.

1674
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,640
That's why we're
here, remember?

1675
01:13:11,975 --> 01:13:13,685
How can I forget?
It's all you ever talk about.

1676
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,310
Penny and my kidney.
My kidney and penny.

1677
01:13:15,354 --> 01:13:17,514
To tell you the truth,
I'm getting a little sick of it.

1678
01:13:17,814 --> 01:13:18,904
Wait a minute.

1679
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:20,692
I know what
you're up to, mister.

1680
01:13:21,109 --> 01:13:22,109
(Chuckling)

1681
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:24,654
You wanna stay
because you're hot for my daughter!

1682
01:13:24,696 --> 01:13:25,816
- What?
- Am I right?

1683
01:13:25,864 --> 01:13:27,074
- What?
- Am I right?

1684
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:28,577
That's insane!

1685
01:13:28,659 --> 01:13:29,739
Don't deny it, Lloyd!

1686
01:13:29,826 --> 01:13:31,196
You have been
drooling over her

1687
01:13:31,286 --> 01:13:33,246
ever since you
first saw her picture.

1688
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:34,410
So what?

1689
01:13:34,498 --> 01:13:37,018
I'm not gonna apologize
for letting nature take its course, har.

1690
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:39,337
I hate to burst
your butthole, mister.

1691
01:13:39,378 --> 01:13:40,498
It ain't gonna happen.

1692
01:13:40,671 --> 01:13:42,881
It's my job to
protect my daughter.

1693
01:13:43,006 --> 01:13:44,046
Protect her?

1694
01:13:44,508 --> 01:13:46,008
(Chuckling)
Look who's talking!

1695
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:47,841
You're trying to
swindle her out of a kidney!

1696
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:49,511
At least I'm gonna marry her.

1697
01:13:51,557 --> 01:13:52,677
Marry her? No.

1698
01:13:52,724 --> 01:13:54,604
- You're not gonna marry.
- Why not?

1699
01:13:54,685 --> 01:13:57,445
No! Lloyd,
you are not going to marry my daughter.

1700
01:13:57,688 --> 01:14:00,398
Why? Because she's
a tick younger than me? Get over it.

1701
01:14:00,566 --> 01:14:01,726
Age is just a letter, man.

1702
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:05,069
It's got nothing
to do with age! It's got to do...

1703
01:14:06,446 --> 01:14:07,566
With what?

1704
01:14:11,535 --> 01:14:13,875
I'm her father, Lloyd,

1705
01:14:15,622 --> 01:14:16,962
and, frankly,

1706
01:14:19,877 --> 01:14:21,377
I think she can do better.

1707
01:14:23,172 --> 01:14:24,342
Oh...

1708
01:14:28,635 --> 01:14:30,045
Okay.

1709
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:36,770
(Gagging)

1710
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:42,234
(Clicking tongue)

1711
01:14:42,316 --> 01:14:44,726
- Time to go, doctor.
- All right, buddy.

1712
01:14:44,776 --> 01:14:46,336
- (Whimpering) Harry?
- Guard: Let's go.

1713
01:14:48,906 --> 01:14:50,066
Lloyd: Harry?

1714
01:14:52,576 --> 01:14:53,616
Harry?

1715
01:14:56,496 --> 01:14:58,786
Dr. walcott just
had a wonderful idea.

1716
01:14:58,916 --> 01:14:59,996
How would you like
to come with us

1717
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:02,093
and judge the young
inventors competition?

1718
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:06,511
Yeah, cool.
Let's judge shit.

1719
01:15:07,174 --> 01:15:08,804
Hey! Hey!

1720
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:18,440
So this is what
rock bottom feels like.

1721
01:15:20,354 --> 01:15:22,614
Mmm, not that bad.
(Chuckles)

1722
01:15:22,773 --> 01:15:24,523
(Cell phone ringing)

1723
01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:27,775
(Gasps)

1724
01:15:28,195 --> 01:15:29,365
Hello?

1725
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:31,360
(Voice breaking)
Hello? Hello?

1726
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:32,698
(Stammers) Hello?

1727
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,121
Penny?

1728
01:15:34,284 --> 01:15:36,294
I can't hear you,
you're breaking up.

1729
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:37,623
Penny?

1730
01:15:38,789 --> 01:15:41,499
Penny! How's this?

1731
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:44,835
(Voice breaking)
Just hang on. Don't go anywhere.

1732
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:46,165
(Static)

1733
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:50,683
Can you hear me now?

1734
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:52,301
Yes, I can hear you now.

1735
01:15:52,469 --> 01:15:55,309
Lloyd: Good! I can hear
you loud and clear.

1736
01:15:55,848 --> 01:15:58,058
This is Lloyd,
your dad's good buddy.

1737
01:15:58,559 --> 01:16:01,389
Unfortunately,
I don't have him at the moment,

1738
01:16:01,854 --> 01:16:05,324
but, uh, he wanted me
to ask you to find a nice, romantic place

1739
01:16:05,357 --> 01:16:06,897
where we can all meet.

1740
01:16:08,652 --> 01:16:10,902
No, by "romantic"
I meant convenient.

1741
01:16:11,488 --> 01:16:14,488
And it has to be
some place outside the convention center.

1742
01:16:15,242 --> 01:16:16,492
(Grunts)

1743
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:20,542
The fountain?
On main street? In 10 minutes?

1744
01:16:20,706 --> 01:16:21,996
Perfect!

1745
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,377
Yes!

1746
01:16:24,835 --> 01:16:26,885
Barbara: It's marvelous
to meet you, Mrs. pinchelow.

1747
01:16:27,004 --> 01:16:28,674
I trust you had
a safe journey in?

1748
01:16:28,755 --> 01:16:29,875
It was lovely.

1749
01:16:30,007 --> 01:16:32,337
Great. We have a seat
saved for you in the front row.

1750
01:16:32,426 --> 01:16:35,096
We're just about
to introduce your charming husband.

1751
01:16:35,429 --> 01:16:36,889
My husband?

1752
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,895
Dr. meldmann:
So let's give a warm, Ken welcome

1753
01:16:39,975 --> 01:16:41,855
to our very distinguished judge,

1754
01:16:41,894 --> 01:16:43,944
Dr. Bernard pinchelow.

1755
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:45,021
(Applause)

1756
01:17:29,942 --> 01:17:31,072
(Whispering) Hi!

1757
01:17:31,318 --> 01:17:32,438
Hello!

1758
01:17:34,279 --> 01:17:35,659
How about a hug?

1759
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:37,156
Sure!

1760
01:17:37,783 --> 01:17:39,083
(Grunts)

1761
01:17:41,245 --> 01:17:42,255
Oh!

1762
01:17:43,413 --> 01:17:44,793
I love hellos.

1763
01:17:45,123 --> 01:17:46,793
Oh, me, too.

1764
01:17:46,959 --> 01:17:48,669
(Grunting)

1765
01:17:51,088 --> 01:17:52,088
Wow!

1766
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:53,422
You're really sweet, mister,

1767
01:17:53,507 --> 01:17:56,927
but I'm waiting for
my dad and his friend,
so if you'll excuse me.

1768
01:17:57,970 --> 01:18:01,260
No, it's me, Lloyd!

1769
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:02,931
Hi, Lloyd, I'm penny.

1770
01:18:03,267 --> 01:18:04,267
Oh! Lloyd! Hi!

1771
01:18:04,351 --> 01:18:05,521
(Chuckling)

1772
01:18:05,602 --> 01:18:08,152
It's so nice to meet you!

1773
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:10,150
Um, where's my dad?

1774
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:14,651
Uh, he was delayed, so, uh,
he asked me to come by

1775
01:18:14,778 --> 01:18:15,818
and entertain you...

1776
01:18:15,904 --> 01:18:17,164
(Blubbering)

1777
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:19,285
(Chuckling)

1778
01:18:19,658 --> 01:18:21,278
...until he can
meet up with us.

1779
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:24,035
I think he wanted us
to have a chance to bond.

1780
01:18:25,622 --> 01:18:26,962
James Bond.

1781
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:28,629
Great!

1782
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:30,549
Are you hungry?
Can I get you something to eat?

1783
01:18:30,627 --> 01:18:32,417
- Sure!
- (Exhales)

1784
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:33,712
(Chuckling)
Awesome!

1785
01:18:38,468 --> 01:18:39,508
Wow!

1786
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:40,968
We can go somewhere nice.

1787
01:18:41,138 --> 01:18:42,218
Sounds yummy!

1788
01:18:43,891 --> 01:18:45,231
Here, try this.

1789
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:47,022
This is incredible popcorn.

1790
01:18:47,186 --> 01:18:50,226
And I know popcorn.
I'm the second-best popcorn maker I know.

1791
01:18:50,397 --> 01:18:52,477
All right,
I'll take the bait. Who's the third-best?

1792
01:18:52,524 --> 01:18:55,534
I know, right?
I've always wondered that!

1793
01:18:55,944 --> 01:18:57,454
- (Grunts)
- (Laughs)

1794
01:18:57,988 --> 01:19:00,448
Shrub club!
(Laughs)

1795
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:01,660
Sorry!

1796
01:19:01,742 --> 01:19:04,412
It's just this game
that I play with my friends back home.

1797
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:06,745
I love you!

1798
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:08,584
What?

1799
01:19:09,249 --> 01:19:10,379
Um...

1800
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:13,707
That's a direct quote,
from your dad.

1801
01:19:14,171 --> 01:19:15,261
(Exhaling)
"I love you."

1802
01:19:15,506 --> 01:19:16,586
His words.

1803
01:19:16,673 --> 01:19:18,093
Hey, wait a second.

1804
01:19:18,342 --> 01:19:20,092
How do I even know
that you know my dad?

1805
01:19:20,219 --> 01:19:22,219
You could be one of
those foreign guys who always calls me up

1806
01:19:22,346 --> 01:19:23,926
and makes me get undressed
in front of the computer

1807
01:19:24,014 --> 01:19:25,604
because he lost
his passports and money.

1808
01:19:25,682 --> 01:19:27,352
No, no, that's not me.

1809
01:19:27,851 --> 01:19:29,771
Look, I can prove it.

1810
01:19:30,354 --> 01:19:31,734
I have your cell phone.

1811
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:35,105
Oh, my gosh!
No wonder no one's been calling me!

1812
01:19:36,318 --> 01:19:37,318
Oh.

1813
01:19:38,278 --> 01:19:40,358
Lloyd: I, uh,
plugged my number in there

1814
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:42,367
in case you need me
late at night.

1815
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:47,197
Oh, and we brought your box.
You left it at the house, you stupid idiot.

1816
01:19:47,329 --> 01:19:48,329
(Both chuckle)

1817
01:19:48,705 --> 01:19:49,865
Hey, you wanna
see something neat?

1818
01:19:49,915 --> 01:19:51,125
Okay!

1819
01:19:53,877 --> 01:19:55,087
(Gasps)

1820
01:19:56,630 --> 01:20:00,220
Wait, are you sure that it's okay for
birds to be eating pop rocks?

1821
01:20:00,634 --> 01:20:02,674
I mean, you'd think it would
be bad for their teeth.

1822
01:20:03,095 --> 01:20:06,145
Nah! That's just
a suburban legend.

1823
01:20:06,223 --> 01:20:07,473
- Oh.
- (Gunshot)

1824
01:20:09,101 --> 01:20:10,271
Shit!

1825
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:17,821
Spontaneous combustion,
however, totally real.

1826
01:20:17,901 --> 01:20:18,901
Oh.

1827
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:22,778
(Cell phone ringing)

1828
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:25,328
- What?
- Adele: You gotta get back here right now.

1829
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:26,870
One of those idiots
is in the building

1830
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:28,750
and he's pretending
to be my husband!

1831
01:20:28,996 --> 01:20:31,076
Why don't you tell them
he's not your husband?

1832
01:20:31,123 --> 01:20:32,883
Because I don't even know
what they're up to.

1833
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:35,127
He must be trying
to sell the box.

1834
01:20:35,419 --> 01:20:37,459
Just get back here!

1835
01:20:37,671 --> 01:20:40,971
This microscopic robot,
or nanobot

1836
01:20:41,341 --> 01:20:43,011
can be injected
into the human body

1837
01:20:43,177 --> 01:20:46,257
to detect and cure cancer.

1838
01:20:46,513 --> 01:20:47,513
(Crowd gasps)

1839
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:49,181
Interesting.

1840
01:20:49,933 --> 01:20:51,603
- Can it sing?
- (Crowd laughs)

1841
01:20:52,644 --> 01:20:53,654
Uh...

1842
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:54,977
What?

1843
01:20:55,105 --> 01:20:57,605
They got a large-mouth
bass now that you hang it on the wall.

1844
01:20:57,649 --> 01:21:00,489
When you walk past it,
it sings take me to the river.

1845
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:01,779
(All laughing)

1846
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:07,655
- Are you saying...
- What I'm saying is,

1847
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:09,446
you're this close,

1848
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:11,660
but there's a drawing board
you should be getting back to.

1849
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:12,960
- Next!
- (Crowd laughs)

1850
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:16,538
But it cures cancer.

1851
01:21:23,759 --> 01:21:25,259
(Indistinct conversations)

1852
01:21:26,136 --> 01:21:27,296
Ni hao.

1853
01:21:31,475 --> 01:21:32,685
Listen to this.

1854
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:34,849
"You will do important
things in the world."

1855
01:21:35,312 --> 01:21:36,352
- (Gasps)
- That's so weird

1856
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,150
because I actually
want to do important things in the world.

1857
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:41,233
Wow. That's neat.

1858
01:21:41,818 --> 01:21:44,028
Someday, I wanna do
important things, too.

1859
01:21:44,154 --> 01:21:45,324
Oh, yeah? Like what?

1860
01:21:47,658 --> 01:21:49,738
I'm thinking about
getting new speakers.

1861
01:21:49,826 --> 01:21:51,196
- Oh.
- (Slurps)

1862
01:21:52,204 --> 01:21:53,664
I've always wanted
to go to India

1863
01:21:53,747 --> 01:21:56,327
and volunteer
at one of those leprechaun colonies.

1864
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:58,213
I think you mean Ireland.

1865
01:21:58,752 --> 01:21:59,962
Oh.

1866
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:01,880
So what does
your cookie say?

1867
01:22:03,841 --> 01:22:05,681
"You will have
an amazing romance

1868
01:22:05,759 --> 01:22:08,349
"with the person sitted
across from you."

1869
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:10,005
(Both chuckle)

1870
01:22:10,347 --> 01:22:12,517
It's a good thing
I'm not your Uncle.

1871
01:22:12,558 --> 01:22:15,188
"And don't be concerned
about the age difference.

1872
01:22:15,269 --> 01:22:17,019
"Just shut up and make out.

1873
01:22:17,062 --> 01:22:19,862
"It will all sort itself
out later. You'll see!"

1874
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:23,494
That's ridiculously specific.
Let me see that.

1875
01:22:24,236 --> 01:22:26,236
If you don't eat it,
it doesn't come true.

1876
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:30,910
Hey, where's my dad?

1877
01:22:31,034 --> 01:22:32,544
Do you know if
Adele came with him?

1878
01:22:32,578 --> 01:22:34,138
She's probably the one
slowing him down.

1879
01:22:34,413 --> 01:22:35,713
Adele?

1880
01:22:35,873 --> 01:22:37,043
His wife.

1881
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:39,126
Harry doesn't have a wife.

1882
01:22:39,376 --> 01:22:40,746
Who's Harry?

1883
01:22:41,378 --> 01:22:42,548
Your father.

1884
01:22:42,588 --> 01:22:43,798
My father's name's not Harry.

1885
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:44,881
It's Bernard.

1886
01:22:44,923 --> 01:22:47,303
Oh, yeah, but I'm talking
about your real dad.

1887
01:22:47,384 --> 01:22:48,554
Harry dunne!

1888
01:22:48,594 --> 01:22:51,144
The guy who abandoned
you when you were a little, tiny baby.

1889
01:22:51,471 --> 01:22:52,761
You're gonna love him!

1890
01:22:53,432 --> 01:22:54,722
Wait a second.

1891
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,690
So you're saying
we're supposed to be meeting

1892
01:22:56,727 --> 01:22:58,477
my biographical father?

1893
01:22:58,562 --> 01:22:59,602
Yes.

1894
01:22:59,813 --> 01:23:00,943
Here.

1895
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:04,441
This is a letter from your real mother,
fraida, that you sent back to her.

1896
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:05,740
Nice.

1897
01:23:05,903 --> 01:23:07,823
"Do not contact again."

1898
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:09,488
This isn't my handwriting.

1899
01:23:09,573 --> 01:23:11,413
I don't even know cursive.

1900
01:23:13,911 --> 01:23:16,911
"Dear daughter,
I gave you up for adoption 18 years ago

1901
01:23:16,997 --> 01:23:19,077
"because I thought it was
the right thing to do.

1902
01:23:19,249 --> 01:23:21,459
"I hope and pray I made
the correct decision.

1903
01:23:21,627 --> 01:23:24,247
"You were conceived
in Rhode Island on a chilly autumn night

1904
01:23:24,338 --> 01:23:26,458
"in the parking lot
at oyster swallow cove.

1905
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:29,430
"We were young and stupid,
especially him."

1906
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:30,970
(Softly)
Oyster swallow cove?

1907
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,190
Fraida: Are you ready, baby?

1908
01:23:40,562 --> 01:23:41,562
(Blows)

1909
01:23:41,605 --> 01:23:42,945
(Sniffs)

1910
01:23:43,732 --> 01:23:44,902
Mmm-hmm.

1911
01:23:45,025 --> 01:23:46,185
Whoa! Whoa!

1912
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:47,738
Slow down.

1913
01:23:47,778 --> 01:23:49,108
Let's be responsible here.

1914
01:23:49,821 --> 01:23:51,491
I brought some protection.

1915
01:23:53,367 --> 01:23:54,577
(Clicks)

1916
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:56,409
(Sighs)

1917
01:23:56,453 --> 01:23:58,083
Let's do this.

1918
01:23:59,498 --> 01:24:01,418
(Grunting)

1919
01:24:02,751 --> 01:24:05,591
"So, if you ever wanna get in touch,
I would love to meet you.

1920
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:08,419
"All my love,
fraida felcher, your mom."

1921
01:24:10,551 --> 01:24:12,141
That means I'm your...

1922
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:14,473
And we almost...

1923
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:16,975
Lloyd? Are you okay?

1924
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:18,140
(Grunts)

1925
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,840
I'm sorry, Lloyd,
but I gotta get back to the convention.

1926
01:24:20,894 --> 01:24:23,814
I'm supposed to be
giving a big speech for my dad any minute.

1927
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:25,497
But, wait. We have
so much to talk about.

1928
01:24:25,566 --> 01:24:26,606
It's an emergency!

1929
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:28,820
It's all a big
misunderstanding! I've gotta go!

1930
01:24:28,902 --> 01:24:30,322
(Yelling)
Not dressed like that, you're not!

1931
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:31,824
You're grounded!

1932
01:24:35,701 --> 01:24:36,991
(Whispering)
Wait a minute.

1933
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:38,830
If she's my kid,

1934
01:24:39,955 --> 01:24:42,005
then she's not Harry's kid,

1935
01:24:42,082 --> 01:24:44,002
and he can't
take her kidneys.

1936
01:24:45,878 --> 01:24:47,338
What have I done?

1937
01:24:55,387 --> 01:24:56,717
Hi, I need to get in.

1938
01:24:57,055 --> 01:24:58,255
Credentials, please?

1939
01:24:58,348 --> 01:24:59,888
Oh, I'm giving a speech.
(Chuckles)

1940
01:25:00,559 --> 01:25:02,139
Credentials, please.

1941
01:25:02,436 --> 01:25:03,476
What is that?

1942
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,110
Is it that thingy
that they gave me to get in here?

1943
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:08,530
I think I've got
it here, somewhere.

1944
01:25:08,692 --> 01:25:12,572
Mister, I am appealing
to your sense of God and family.

1945
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:13,949
I got a message
that my daughter,

1946
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:16,281
who I have not
seen in 22 years,

1947
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:17,530
is in there.

1948
01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:19,411
The event will be
letting out soon.

1949
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:22,754
After 22 years,
what's another couple of hours, right?

1950
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:24,331
Okay, buddy.

1951
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:27,587
There's got to be a, uh,

1952
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:29,299
broom closet around
here somewhere, huh?

1953
01:25:30,172 --> 01:25:33,052
I'm sure we could
work something out.

1954
01:25:34,718 --> 01:25:37,758
I didn't take 34 years
to come out of the closet

1955
01:25:37,888 --> 01:25:39,218
just to go back into one

1956
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:40,636
with you.

1957
01:25:41,934 --> 01:25:45,814
Okay, this device will give us a visual
rendering of your cognitive processes.

1958
01:25:46,563 --> 01:25:48,483
- Could you repeat the question?
- (Crowd laughs)

1959
01:25:48,649 --> 01:25:51,109
This device will show us
what he's thinking

1960
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:52,741
right on this screen.

1961
01:25:52,778 --> 01:25:53,778
(Blows raspberry)

1962
01:25:53,904 --> 01:25:55,414
(Chuckling)
Yeah, really.

1963
01:25:55,447 --> 01:25:56,947
Student: Go ahead,
Dr. pinchelow.

1964
01:25:57,533 --> 01:25:58,743
Think of a pleasant memory
from your childhood.

1965
01:25:58,825 --> 01:25:59,825
(Beeps)

1966
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:01,660
(Sighs) Okay.

1967
01:26:07,543 --> 01:26:08,543
(Crowd gasps)

1968
01:26:11,255 --> 01:26:12,465
(Crackling)

1969
01:26:17,928 --> 01:26:18,928
(Crowd exclaims)

1970
01:26:19,012 --> 01:26:20,062
Oh!

1971
01:26:20,097 --> 01:26:21,177
Young Harry: Here, biscuit!

1972
01:26:21,932 --> 01:26:22,972
Biscuit, come here, boy.

1973
01:26:23,058 --> 01:26:24,178
(Whistling)

1974
01:26:24,935 --> 01:26:26,105
The door, buddy.
Get the door.

1975
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:30,771
(Crowd groans disgustedly)

1976
01:26:32,442 --> 01:26:33,442
(Sighs)

1977
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:34,820
(Groaning)

1978
01:26:34,903 --> 01:26:36,283
Oh, okay.

1979
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:37,781
(Stuttering)

1980
01:26:38,657 --> 01:26:40,777
No! This gadget
is way off!

1981
01:26:40,868 --> 01:26:42,158
(Crowd gasps)

1982
01:26:42,286 --> 01:26:43,616
First of all,
my bedspread was orange.

1983
01:26:43,745 --> 01:26:45,075
(Crowd laughs)

1984
01:26:58,677 --> 01:27:00,177
Are you okay, honey?

1985
01:27:00,345 --> 01:27:01,675
No, not really.

1986
01:27:01,889 --> 01:27:03,139
Boyfriend trouble?

1987
01:27:03,348 --> 01:27:05,478
No. I need a ticket
to get in

1988
01:27:05,517 --> 01:27:08,307
and I lost the ticket that they
need to take, plus, I lost my pass.

1989
01:27:08,353 --> 01:27:09,443
And I thought that I grabbed it,

1990
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:10,479
but when I looked in my purse,

1991
01:27:10,564 --> 01:27:12,444
all I saw was
the toothbrush. So maybe I took...

1992
01:27:12,482 --> 01:27:13,862
Okay, okay, okay.

1993
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:15,107
(Sighs)

1994
01:27:15,152 --> 01:27:16,322
All right.

1995
01:27:16,987 --> 01:27:18,067
What's going on?

1996
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:20,528
My father's supposed to be
getting a huge reward,

1997
01:27:20,657 --> 01:27:22,257
and I'm supposed to be
making the speech,

1998
01:27:22,409 --> 01:27:23,869
and the speech
is supposed to start right now,

1999
01:27:23,994 --> 01:27:26,374
and there's no way
they'll let me in without a ticket.

2000
01:27:27,998 --> 01:27:29,328
Oh, honey.

2001
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:32,750
There is always a way.

2002
01:27:36,048 --> 01:27:37,838
I admit,
it's thought-provoking.

2003
01:27:38,008 --> 01:27:40,178
An invention that
ends world hunger.

2004
01:27:40,219 --> 01:27:42,429
But, have you considered this,

2005
01:27:42,763 --> 01:27:44,353
where does all
the extra poop go?

2006
01:27:44,389 --> 01:27:45,429
(All laughing)

2007
01:27:45,516 --> 01:27:46,676
What? No.

2008
01:27:46,767 --> 01:27:48,227
The point is that
there's no more hunger.

2009
01:27:48,352 --> 01:27:49,352
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

2010
01:27:49,394 --> 01:27:50,694
We're gonna take
a very brief break.

2011
01:27:50,771 --> 01:27:51,891
Uh, please stay
in your seats

2012
01:27:51,897 --> 01:27:53,857
and we will resume,
uh, shortly.

2013
01:27:53,941 --> 01:27:55,031
Why?

2014
01:27:55,067 --> 01:27:56,397
We're gonna have
to take a walk.

2015
01:27:56,568 --> 01:27:58,068
- Come on.
- I'm judging.

2016
01:27:58,195 --> 01:27:59,575
- You're out of here.
- Okay!

2017
01:27:59,696 --> 01:28:00,906
You're out.

2018
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:02,198
Mrs. p,

2019
01:28:02,366 --> 01:28:03,366
what are you doing here?

2020
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:06,580
Do you always
call your wife Mrs. p?

2021
01:28:07,204 --> 01:28:08,544
Oh, uh...

2022
01:28:09,706 --> 01:28:11,616
How you doing, sugar tits?
I missed you.

2023
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:13,378
This man is a fraud.

2024
01:28:13,544 --> 01:28:15,554
And that box belongs
to my husband.

2025
01:28:15,879 --> 01:28:16,919
He stole it from us.

2026
01:28:17,047 --> 01:28:18,087
Hand it over, buddy.

2027
01:28:18,173 --> 01:28:20,553
Uh-uh. I swore
I'd only give this box to penny.

2028
01:28:20,592 --> 01:28:22,592
- Give me the box!
- Here you go.

2029
01:28:23,053 --> 01:28:24,393
(Alarm wailing)

2030
01:28:26,682 --> 01:28:27,722
(Indistinct conversations)

2031
01:28:27,891 --> 01:28:29,971
- Adele: What's happening?
- Barbara: I have no idea.

2032
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:31,100
Hey!

2033
01:28:31,228 --> 01:28:33,228
Hey, hey!
Get back here!

2034
01:28:33,564 --> 01:28:35,074
Out of my way!

2035
01:28:37,317 --> 01:28:39,067
Thanks a lot, lady!

2036
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:40,990
It's the least I could do.

2037
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:42,610
(Chuckles)

2038
01:28:44,241 --> 01:28:45,531
(Sighs deeply)

2039
01:28:47,077 --> 01:28:48,407
(Stutters)

2040
01:28:49,246 --> 01:28:51,076
There's something
I need to tell you.

2041
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:52,580
(Stammers)
You're my...

2042
01:28:55,002 --> 01:28:56,422
Okay. The reason
I'm here is...

2043
01:28:56,461 --> 01:28:57,501
Harry: Fraida!

2044
01:28:57,796 --> 01:28:59,166
- Fraida: Harry?
- (Chuckles)

2045
01:28:59,298 --> 01:29:00,508
- You made it!
- Oh!

2046
01:29:02,259 --> 01:29:03,839
Oh, and you found penny.

2047
01:29:04,803 --> 01:29:06,763
Hey, how do you know my...

2048
01:29:06,847 --> 01:29:09,097
Oh! You're Harry?

2049
01:29:09,183 --> 01:29:11,563
Yes! And I'm your mother!

2050
01:29:11,602 --> 01:29:12,602
(Gasps)

2051
01:29:14,021 --> 01:29:15,651
- He's got a gun!
- (All screaming)

2052
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:40,801
(Door creaks open)

2053
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:11,537
Why you standing in the toilet?

2054
01:30:12,162 --> 01:30:13,662
So you wouldn't see my feet.

2055
01:30:14,331 --> 01:30:15,751
Why not just stand on the rim?

2056
01:30:15,874 --> 01:30:17,834
There's ball hairs
all over that thing.

2057
01:30:17,918 --> 01:30:19,038
I'm not stupid.

2058
01:30:20,921 --> 01:30:23,131
Get out of there!
Move it!

2059
01:30:23,173 --> 01:30:24,383
Now!

2060
01:30:25,342 --> 01:30:27,092
Please don't hurt penny,
Mrs. p.

2061
01:30:27,177 --> 01:30:30,387
She's young and still has most
of her future ahead of her.

2062
01:30:30,514 --> 01:30:31,854
Get the box.

2063
01:30:34,226 --> 01:30:37,016
Harry! There you are!

2064
01:30:37,437 --> 01:30:40,017
(Chuckles)
Good thing you're loud.

2065
01:30:40,858 --> 01:30:42,358
What are you
doing, Mrs. p?

2066
01:30:42,442 --> 01:30:43,612
I'm about to kill you.

2067
01:30:43,861 --> 01:30:45,531
Wait, wait, wait!

2068
01:30:46,029 --> 01:30:47,359
Can't you kill someone else?

2069
01:30:47,447 --> 01:30:48,867
My daughter, penny,
needs me now.

2070
01:30:49,283 --> 01:30:51,443
What are you
talking about, Lloyd? Penny's my daughter.

2071
01:30:51,702 --> 01:30:53,412
- No, Harry, she isn't.
- Mmm-mmm.

2072
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,700
What?

2073
01:30:54,788 --> 01:30:56,958
Why would you think
that she's your daughter?

2074
01:30:57,457 --> 01:30:59,537
Because of the postcard.

2075
01:31:00,043 --> 01:31:02,553
I was about to
be a single mom and I needed money.

2076
01:31:02,713 --> 01:31:04,263
And you owed me 40 bucks

2077
01:31:04,339 --> 01:31:07,129
from that stupid
worm farm loan.

2078
01:31:08,051 --> 01:31:09,471
Lloyd: It's true, har.

2079
01:31:10,387 --> 01:31:12,717
I'm the deadbeat dad,
not you.

2080
01:31:12,764 --> 01:31:13,774
(Yelps)

2081
01:31:13,974 --> 01:31:15,644
I'm penny's baby-papa.

2082
01:31:15,934 --> 01:31:16,944
(Howls)

2083
01:31:17,144 --> 01:31:18,944
But don't judge me
till you see this.

2084
01:31:19,229 --> 01:31:22,109
Oh, yeah, like a cooler
of cold brewskies

2085
01:31:22,191 --> 01:31:23,901
is gonna make everything okay!

2086
01:31:23,942 --> 01:31:25,612
It's not beer,
it's my kidney!

2087
01:31:29,114 --> 01:31:30,414
Your kidney?

2088
01:31:31,408 --> 01:31:32,618
I figured

2089
01:31:33,744 --> 01:31:36,084
since you can't
get one from penny,

2090
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:38,250
I'd give it to you myself.

2091
01:31:38,957 --> 01:31:40,287
Holy shit.

2092
01:31:41,502 --> 01:31:42,922
- How did you get this?
- (Panting)

2093
01:31:43,337 --> 01:31:45,917
I crossed the border
into Mexico.

2094
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:49,630
Turns out, the medical regs
are a little more chill down there.

2095
01:31:49,927 --> 01:31:52,757
Pardon me for
bringing this up, but I don't give a shit!

2096
01:31:52,804 --> 01:31:56,024
Yeah, but, Lloyd,
she isn't your daughter either.

2097
01:31:56,683 --> 01:31:58,443
Nice try, fraida,

2098
01:31:58,477 --> 01:32:00,597
but penny
read me the letter.

2099
01:32:00,646 --> 01:32:02,856
I know all about
oyster swallow cove,

2100
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:04,770
which is exactly where
you took me in the van!

2101
01:32:04,816 --> 01:32:05,856
So?

2102
01:32:06,026 --> 01:32:07,856
That was my spot.

2103
01:32:08,278 --> 01:32:11,028
I must have taken
hundreds of guys there.

2104
01:32:12,032 --> 01:32:13,202
What can I say?

2105
01:32:14,493 --> 01:32:16,293
I was a Titanic whore.

2106
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:18,620
That's enough bullshit.

2107
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:20,619
Go ahead, lippincott,
kill them.

2108
01:32:21,792 --> 01:32:22,962
Lippincott: Oh, I will.

2109
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:26,339
But first, why don't
you join them.

2110
01:32:26,463 --> 01:32:27,513
(Breathing heavily)
What?

2111
01:32:27,631 --> 01:32:29,301
You heard me.
Drop it!

2112
01:32:29,383 --> 01:32:31,053
Get over there!
Get over there!

2113
01:32:31,134 --> 01:32:34,224
You're kidding.
She's on our team now?

2114
01:32:34,304 --> 01:32:35,644
Don't do this, lippincott.

2115
01:32:35,681 --> 01:32:36,811
You're a military man.

2116
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:38,980
I know you've got
more integrity than this!

2117
01:32:41,979 --> 01:32:43,149
What is this?

2118
01:32:43,397 --> 01:32:44,397
Huh?

2119
01:32:44,815 --> 01:32:46,195
Two cupcakes?

2120
01:32:46,817 --> 01:32:48,647
Actually, there were
four cupcakes, sir.

2121
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:50,645
- I ate the two chocolate ones.
- Lloyd!

2122
01:32:50,737 --> 01:32:52,987
It's okay.
I left the vanilla ones for humanity.

2123
01:32:53,073 --> 01:32:54,663
Where's the invention?

2124
01:32:55,158 --> 01:32:57,658
Where's the goddamn
billion-dollar invention?

2125
01:32:57,703 --> 01:32:58,703
(Indistinct yelling)

2126
01:32:58,871 --> 01:33:00,711
Put the gun down!
Freeze!

2127
01:33:00,831 --> 01:33:02,501
Put the gun down,
lippincott!

2128
01:33:04,168 --> 01:33:05,168
(Clatters)

2129
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:06,340
(Door creaks open)

2130
01:33:07,671 --> 01:33:09,551
Well! Hello.

2131
01:33:09,673 --> 01:33:10,723
Dad!

2132
01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:13,681
Bernard.
Oh, thank God you're here.

2133
01:33:13,719 --> 01:33:15,179
God, and you're okay!

2134
01:33:15,345 --> 01:33:16,675
Stop right there.

2135
01:33:16,763 --> 01:33:17,853
What?

2136
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:19,220
I appreciate
your concern, Adele,

2137
01:33:19,308 --> 01:33:21,138
but it's a little late for that.

2138
01:33:21,226 --> 01:33:22,386
You see...

2139
01:33:22,519 --> 01:33:23,519
I couldn't stop wondering

2140
01:33:23,562 --> 01:33:25,862
why every time
I ate your cooking, I was getting sicker.

2141
01:33:26,190 --> 01:33:27,570
And then when Harry
and Lloyd showed me

2142
01:33:27,649 --> 01:33:29,089
the letter from
penny's birth mother,

2143
01:33:29,151 --> 01:33:30,691
I recognized that
the handwriting

2144
01:33:30,777 --> 01:33:32,647
sending it back was yours.

2145
01:33:32,863 --> 01:33:35,033
And the cruelty of this
got me to thinking.

2146
01:33:35,073 --> 01:33:38,703
So I laid a little trap,
and lo and behold, you took the bait

2147
01:33:38,869 --> 01:33:41,749
like the toe-sucking
rat that you are.

2148
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:43,040
After you left for El Paso,

2149
01:33:43,081 --> 01:33:45,501
I called the FBI
to make sure penny was protected.

2150
01:33:45,584 --> 01:33:47,884
I thought those
Canadian accents were a little shaky.

2151
01:33:48,003 --> 01:33:49,883
Yeah? You try it.

2152
01:33:50,547 --> 01:33:52,217
But what about the invention?

2153
01:33:52,549 --> 01:33:54,679
It was just cupcakes.

2154
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:57,050
A gift for
Dr. Barbara walcott

2155
01:33:57,137 --> 01:33:59,057
for my having canceled
at the last moment.

2156
01:33:59,097 --> 01:34:00,387
This is great, dad!

2157
01:34:00,432 --> 01:34:03,232
Now you can pick up
your lifetime achievement reward in person!

2158
01:34:03,352 --> 01:34:05,562
It's "award,"
you stupid bitch!

2159
01:34:06,063 --> 01:34:07,113
No!

2160
01:34:07,856 --> 01:34:08,856
(Groaning)

2161
01:34:09,316 --> 01:34:10,316
(Grunting)

2162
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:15,361
(Indistinct yelling)

2163
01:34:15,405 --> 01:34:17,065
Both: Break it up! Get off!

2164
01:34:17,157 --> 01:34:18,237
Hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back.

2165
01:34:18,325 --> 01:34:19,495
(Grunting)

2166
01:34:19,576 --> 01:34:21,616
- I'm the good guy here!
- All right.

2167
01:34:21,703 --> 01:34:22,753
(Pants)

2168
01:34:22,788 --> 01:34:24,578
Are you okay, har?

2169
01:34:24,873 --> 01:34:26,083
I think so.

2170
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:27,753
(Breathing heavily)

2171
01:34:32,089 --> 01:34:34,379
Oh, yeah,
it's just a little graze.

2172
01:34:34,925 --> 01:34:36,935
Uh, har?

2173
01:34:37,094 --> 01:34:39,554
You might wanna put
a dab of bactine on that.

2174
01:34:39,596 --> 01:34:40,756
(Siren wailing)

2175
01:34:43,308 --> 01:34:44,428
Hurry, he's been shot!

2176
01:34:44,518 --> 01:34:45,598
Man: We need a trauma room.

2177
01:34:45,602 --> 01:34:47,272
You're gonna be okay.
What have we got?

2178
01:34:47,396 --> 01:34:49,306
Gunshot wound,
left shoulder.

2179
01:34:49,815 --> 01:34:51,075
Lloyd, the kidney!

2180
01:34:51,108 --> 01:34:52,278
Kidney?

2181
01:34:52,317 --> 01:34:53,437
Oh, yeah.

2182
01:34:53,527 --> 01:34:55,607
Would you, by any chance,
have time this evening

2183
01:34:55,821 --> 01:34:57,241
to swap out a kidney?

2184
01:34:57,281 --> 01:34:59,071
I'm sorry, sir.
What is this?

2185
01:34:59,491 --> 01:35:01,621
It's a kidney.
My kidney.

2186
01:35:02,077 --> 01:35:03,617
It's for him,

2187
01:35:03,662 --> 01:35:04,662
my best pal.

2188
01:35:04,746 --> 01:35:06,786
- (Groaning) Ah!
- He needs it.

2189
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:10,500
Gentlemen,
this is not a kidney.

2190
01:35:11,295 --> 01:35:12,505
What is it?

2191
01:35:12,963 --> 01:35:15,473
- Better not be my heart.
- Doctor: No.

2192
01:35:15,507 --> 01:35:17,967
I believe it's a pork chop.

2193
01:35:18,302 --> 01:35:19,842
- In a baggie.
- (Chuckling)

2194
01:35:20,929 --> 01:35:24,349
I wondered why my
kidney had grill marks.

2195
01:35:24,933 --> 01:35:26,603
And a bone.

2196
01:35:27,352 --> 01:35:28,482
Hey, wait.

2197
01:35:28,645 --> 01:35:31,015
Does that mean
I still have all my kidneys?

2198
01:35:31,857 --> 01:35:32,977
Let's have a look.

2199
01:35:33,901 --> 01:35:34,901
Ah.

2200
01:35:36,153 --> 01:35:37,783
I'm going to say probably not.

2201
01:35:39,489 --> 01:35:40,659
That's it.

2202
01:35:40,824 --> 01:35:43,374
I am gonna give
that quack an earful

2203
01:35:43,535 --> 01:35:45,825
at my follow-up
appointment next Tuesday.

2204
01:35:47,164 --> 01:35:49,004
(Sobbing)
I'm sorry, Harry.

2205
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:51,328
I failed you again!

2206
01:35:51,627 --> 01:35:52,667
(Sniffles)

2207
01:35:52,711 --> 01:35:54,301
It's okay, Lloyd.

2208
01:35:54,421 --> 01:35:55,461
(Sniffles)

2209
01:35:55,506 --> 01:35:56,506
I forgive you.

2210
01:35:57,007 --> 01:35:58,297
(Snickers)

2211
01:35:59,676 --> 01:36:01,006
Lloyd: What's so funny?

2212
01:36:01,678 --> 01:36:03,008
Got ya!

2213
01:36:03,847 --> 01:36:04,847
(Mumbles)

2214
01:36:05,182 --> 01:36:07,232
I never needed a kidney!

2215
01:36:07,309 --> 01:36:08,599
(Laughs)

2216
01:36:10,187 --> 01:36:11,187
What?

2217
01:36:11,355 --> 01:36:13,525
Oh, you should have seen
the look on your face!

2218
01:36:13,649 --> 01:36:16,029
I got you so good!

2219
01:36:16,109 --> 01:36:17,359
- (Laughing)
- (Exhales)

2220
01:36:17,528 --> 01:36:19,028
Wait a minute.

2221
01:36:19,196 --> 01:36:20,566
You mean,

2222
01:36:20,739 --> 01:36:23,739
I had my kidney removed

2223
01:36:24,243 --> 01:36:26,873
in the backseat
of a Toyota tercel

2224
01:36:26,912 --> 01:36:29,792
- and you were faking?
- Uh-huh.

2225
01:36:30,707 --> 01:36:32,327
That is awesome!

2226
01:36:32,626 --> 01:36:33,626
(Laughing)

2227
01:36:34,878 --> 01:36:36,498
That is a good one.

2228
01:36:38,423 --> 01:36:40,223
Totally worth it!

2229
01:36:41,677 --> 01:36:43,887
Gentlemen,
I hate to break up this mensa summit,

2230
01:36:43,929 --> 01:36:45,509
but we've gotta
get this man's shoulder cleaned out.

2231
01:36:45,556 --> 01:36:46,876
Do you remember,
you've been shot?

2232
01:36:47,558 --> 01:36:49,558
That was a good gag, Harry.

2233
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:50,601
(Laughing)

2234
01:36:50,936 --> 01:36:53,186
But don't you think
it still would have been funny

2235
01:36:53,397 --> 01:36:56,777
if you had told me you were kidding
before I lost my vital organ?

2236
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:59,690
Oh, definitely.
But not as!

2237
01:36:59,736 --> 01:37:00,856
(Laughing)

2238
01:37:04,575 --> 01:37:06,035
That's true.

2239
01:37:18,422 --> 01:37:20,382
You guys are so cool.

2240
01:37:20,424 --> 01:37:22,804
How can I ever thank you
for what you did for me?

2241
01:37:22,926 --> 01:37:24,426
Got any cash?

2242
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:26,011
Oh, yeah,

2243
01:37:26,096 --> 01:37:27,256
I think
I've got a couple...

2244
01:37:27,806 --> 01:37:28,886
Thanks.

2245
01:37:29,433 --> 01:37:30,893
Score.

2246
01:37:31,935 --> 01:37:33,185
(Pinchelow laughing)

2247
01:37:34,104 --> 01:37:35,274
(Laughing)

2248
01:37:37,941 --> 01:37:39,281
(Pinchelow clears throat)

2249
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:40,489
Oh, uh...

2250
01:37:40,986 --> 01:37:43,656
- I'm sure those janitors will thank us later.
- Mmm.

2251
01:37:43,947 --> 01:37:45,867
We were just
straightening up their broom closet.

2252
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,530
Fraida: Penny,
wonderful news!

2253
01:37:47,951 --> 01:37:51,121
Your father has invited me
to come stay with you for a while,

2254
01:37:51,288 --> 01:37:53,458
so we can really get
to know each other.

2255
01:37:53,707 --> 01:37:55,377
That's fantastic!

2256
01:37:56,126 --> 01:37:57,956
So let me ask you
something, fraida.

2257
01:37:58,295 --> 01:38:01,135
If I'm not penny's father
and Lloyd's not her father,

2258
01:38:01,256 --> 01:38:02,876
then who's her father?

2259
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:04,760
Funny you should ask.

2260
01:38:05,052 --> 01:38:06,222
Honey,

2261
01:38:06,386 --> 01:38:09,386
how would you like to
meet some relatives?

2262
01:38:12,976 --> 01:38:14,596
Lloyd: Mr. stainer?

2263
01:38:15,103 --> 01:38:16,403
Oh, I should have known.

2264
01:38:16,563 --> 01:38:18,733
(Yelling)
You horny, old goat!

2265
01:38:18,815 --> 01:38:20,435
No, Lloyd!

2266
01:38:20,984 --> 01:38:23,494
Mr. stainer is
penny's grandfather.

2267
01:38:23,654 --> 01:38:24,954
Come on.

2268
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:30,410
So, you mean
pee-stain is the dad?

2269
01:38:31,411 --> 01:38:32,621
Duh!

2270
01:38:36,041 --> 01:38:37,381
(Chuckling)

2271
01:38:39,336 --> 01:38:40,796
Hi!

2272
01:38:40,838 --> 01:38:42,008
Oh...

2273
01:38:42,673 --> 01:38:44,423
She's beautiful!

2274
01:38:45,092 --> 01:38:46,682
Sweet Jesus,
look at her.

2275
01:38:47,594 --> 01:38:49,224
She's got Peter's eyes.

2276
01:38:49,304 --> 01:38:50,314
You're kidding!

2277
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:52,020
He donated them?

2278
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:54,350
Hi, pee-stain!

2279
01:38:54,518 --> 01:38:55,978
Stainy!

2280
01:38:56,436 --> 01:38:58,766
Hey, sorry you got killed!

2281
01:38:59,523 --> 01:39:02,533
Let's get you away
from these guys, huh? Let's go.

2282
01:39:02,693 --> 01:39:03,863
Pinchelow: Yeah.

2283
01:39:05,362 --> 01:39:08,952
Guys, there's still one
thing I don't understand.

2284
01:39:09,533 --> 01:39:13,293
How could either of you
have possibly thought

2285
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:15,290
that you were
penny's father?

2286
01:39:16,039 --> 01:39:17,209
(Scoffs) Why wouldn't we?

2287
01:39:17,291 --> 01:39:18,381
Yeah!

2288
01:39:18,709 --> 01:39:20,379
Because we never had sex.

2289
01:39:20,586 --> 01:39:21,876
Oh. (Chuckles)

2290
01:39:21,962 --> 01:39:23,342
(Snickering)

2291
01:39:26,133 --> 01:39:27,883
You could have fooled us.

2292
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:29,470
Yeah, nice try,
snow white.

2293
01:39:29,553 --> 01:39:32,063
Does the word "hot tub"
jog your memory?

2294
01:39:32,222 --> 01:39:33,262
If I recall,

2295
01:39:33,348 --> 01:39:35,678
I played with your boobies
for a long time that night.

2296
01:39:35,726 --> 01:39:36,846
The motor boat,

2297
01:39:36,894 --> 01:39:38,064
the windshield wipers,

2298
01:39:38,145 --> 01:39:39,405
the punching bag.

2299
01:39:39,563 --> 01:39:40,653
You know, Harry,

2300
01:39:40,731 --> 01:39:43,731
you can't get a woman
pregnant by man-handling her breasts.

2301
01:39:43,901 --> 01:39:44,901
Oh, really?

2302
01:39:44,985 --> 01:39:46,155
Then why did your
doorbells get so hard?

2303
01:39:46,278 --> 01:39:47,398
(Both chuckle)

2304
01:39:47,654 --> 01:39:49,994
Yeah. And did you
forget about the French tickler,

2305
01:39:50,073 --> 01:39:51,373
in the back of the van?

2306
01:39:51,408 --> 01:39:55,158
Putting a frilly,
glow-in-the-dark condom on your finger

2307
01:39:55,245 --> 01:39:57,245
is not the same
as having sex.

2308
01:39:57,414 --> 01:39:58,504
But what if
I go like this?

2309
01:39:58,582 --> 01:39:59,752
(Gibbering)

2310
01:40:00,209 --> 01:40:01,249
No.

2311
01:40:01,335 --> 01:40:04,715
Okay, Dr. Picasso,
what's your definition of sex?

2312
01:40:06,924 --> 01:40:08,094
(Whispering)

2313
01:40:09,676 --> 01:40:11,086
No way!

2314
01:40:11,345 --> 01:40:12,605
That's just...

2315
01:40:12,763 --> 01:40:14,063
Not my mom!

2316
01:40:14,181 --> 01:40:15,431
But that's where she pees!

2317
01:40:15,516 --> 01:40:18,766
It's in my head
and I can't unlearn it!

2318
01:40:19,019 --> 01:40:20,439
You're bad!

2319
01:40:20,521 --> 01:40:21,601
Can you show us?

2320
01:40:21,688 --> 01:40:23,268
I call sloppy seconds!

2321
01:40:24,316 --> 01:40:25,476
(Sighs)

2322
01:40:27,277 --> 01:40:30,237
Looks like everyone else
ended up with someone.

2323
01:40:30,781 --> 01:40:31,911
Yep.

2324
01:40:31,949 --> 01:40:33,409
And I got this pork chop.

2325
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:34,620
(Chuckles)

2326
01:40:34,910 --> 01:40:36,580
So let me get
this straight, har.

2327
01:40:36,912 --> 01:40:39,462
When you visited me
in the nuthouse the last time...

2328
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:40,960
- Uh-huh.
- ...You knew about penny already?

2329
01:40:41,124 --> 01:40:43,424
No, I found out about her
when we visited my parents.

2330
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:46,300
But I had finally
figured out that you were faking.

2331
01:40:46,463 --> 01:40:47,883
- Really? How?
- Mmm-hmm.

2332
01:40:47,965 --> 01:40:48,975
What gave it away?

2333
01:40:49,091 --> 01:40:51,721
A few months ago,
I was changing your diaper before bedtime

2334
01:40:51,802 --> 01:40:54,802
and you just seemed
a little too upbeat.

2335
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:57,970
Lloyd,

2336
01:40:58,141 --> 01:41:00,231
even though it's Christmas Eve,

2337
01:41:00,602 --> 01:41:03,442
I want you to know
that there's no place I would rather be

2338
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:06,400
than right here,
wiping my best friend's dookie.

2339
01:41:06,608 --> 01:41:07,608
(Farts)

2340
01:41:08,527 --> 01:41:09,527
Oh. (Chuckles)

2341
01:41:09,653 --> 01:41:11,953
Looks like we got
another stocking stuffer.

2342
01:41:12,114 --> 01:41:13,324
(Chuckles)

2343
01:41:16,118 --> 01:41:17,618
(Chuckling)
I remember that.

2344
01:41:17,995 --> 01:41:20,465
That was the night
I had all that eggnog and lamb, right?

2345
01:41:20,622 --> 01:41:22,122
Yeah. Whoa!

2346
01:41:22,165 --> 01:41:23,245
Lloyd!

2347
01:41:26,837 --> 01:41:29,257
Check out the hotties
at 12 o'clock.

2348
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:31,300
That's almost three hours away.

2349
01:41:31,341 --> 01:41:33,011
Can't I check them out now?

2350
01:41:33,177 --> 01:41:34,177
(Grunting)

2351
01:41:35,053 --> 01:41:36,553
(Both breathing heavily)

2352
01:41:38,557 --> 01:41:40,307
(Sputtering)

2353
01:41:41,685 --> 01:41:42,765
Okay, Lloyd,

2354
01:41:42,853 --> 01:41:45,983
this time we're not gonna be
stupid and pass up a sure thing.

2355
01:41:46,023 --> 01:41:47,483
I hear you, har.

2356
01:41:48,275 --> 01:41:49,945
We'll never get
another chance like this.

2357
01:41:50,027 --> 01:41:52,357
Our time has finally come.

2358
01:41:58,202 --> 01:41:59,412
(Both scream)

2359
01:41:59,953 --> 01:42:01,373
Both: Bush club!

2360
01:42:01,413 --> 01:42:02,413
(Both laughing)

2361
01:42:18,305 --> 01:42:20,105
(Folk music playing)

2362
01:48:47,277 --> 01:48:48,447
Oh, crap!

2363
01:48:48,904 --> 01:48:51,364
I ordered a vanilla shake
and they gave me a chocolate one.

2364
01:48:51,448 --> 01:48:53,408
Tell me about it.
I ordered a chocolate shake.

2365
01:48:53,492 --> 01:48:55,372
Those dopes gave me
a vanilla one.

2366
01:48:55,494 --> 01:48:57,124
They do that a lot.

2367
01:48:59,289 --> 01:49:00,579
What the hell?

2368
01:49:02,501 --> 01:49:04,091
Kick his ass, seabass!

2369
01:49:04,503 --> 01:49:06,063
Seabass: Arr,
the dirty sons-of-bitches!
