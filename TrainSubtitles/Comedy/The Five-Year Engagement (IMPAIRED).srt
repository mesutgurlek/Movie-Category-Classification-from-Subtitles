the first important thing
to remember about marriage

is that it
requires commitment.

Of course, the men
will wear yarmulkes.

This is a huge
opportunity for you.

472
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,769
If you don't do this, you're
gonna end up resenting me,

be the resentor than resented.

474
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,654
Look, let's talk logistics.
How long is the thing?

475
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,407
Two years.
Two years?

476
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,783
Yeah. It's long.

477
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,079
No, it's not.

478
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,122
Really?

479
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,917
In the scheme of us spending
our whole lives together,

480
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,790
two years, that's...

481
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,123
And then we can
come back here, right?

482
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,966
Yeah, of course. It's just two years.
Yeah, that's...

483
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,802
And, look, I can cook anywhere.
Right.

484
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,380
I've cooked in New York,
I've cooked in L.A.

485
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,932
I'm pretty sure
I can handle Michigan.

486
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:33,930
Um...

487
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,728
All right. Listen,
here's what I propose.

488
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,398
Let's just put off the wedding.
We're not in any rush.

489
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,474
Really?
Yeah.

490
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,777
We'll get to Michigan,
we'll get settled in,

491
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,025
and then we'll start planning
the wedding again from there

492
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,527

our bearings.

Yeah.

496

I think we both know that I deserve
to get super laid for this.

497

a cape or something?

498

I mean, theoretically,
whatever you want.

499

I'm just saying I don't
want weekday sex.

500

I want the show.

501
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,134
You're gonna get the show.
Good, I better.

00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,511

Wow, okay.

I really wish that you would
have told me that earlier.

Shit.

525
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,243
Okay, so my fiancée,
Violet, who you've met,

526
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,540
got a job in Michigan...

527

This is why marriage
is dumb, okay? It's dumb.

528

You have a job here,
and she's got a job there.

529
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,839
You guys can't do anything
because you're so connected,

530
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,462
so then one of you
has to get the shaft.

00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,574
This is an experiment I did
a couple of years ago,

627
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:54,534
which shows that children can have
trouble with self-regulation.

628
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,337
As you know, if we don't get research
grants, we have no money to pay you.

629
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,664
And, <i>as</i> of now,
we don't have one.

630
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:05,127
So, we need ideas for some
studies that we can run,

631
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,180
and this is my main
area of interest, here.

632
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:12,764
Good. So I want to do the
marshmallow experiment with adults.

633
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,265
Well, adults will just wait
for the second marshmallow.

634
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,814
I actually don't even think
adults really like marshmallows.

635
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,938
Yeah, well, I'm not referring
specifically to the marshmallow.

636
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,394
What about this?

637
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,571
What if we were to
take our subjects, right,

638
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,694
and have them play
a driving video game?

639
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,402
Have half of the subjects
drive the car normally.

640
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,579
Have the other half
drive while masturbating.

641
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,661
Why do all of your experiments
have to involve masturbation?

642
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,494
Why do none of your experiments
involve masturbation?

643
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,662
Um... What if we,

644
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:45,755
um, casually left a box of stale
donuts in the testing room?

645
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,841
And you inform the subjects
that these stale donuts

646
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,513
will be replaced
with new donuts

647
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,929
20 minutes from then.

648
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:57,479
But then we watch and we see who
still goes for an old donut.

649
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,479
What would be interesting
is if we had a manipulation.

650
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,310
So, one group,
we could make them

651
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,111
feel temporarily
depressed or...

652
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,529
VANEETHA: You know
what we should do?

653
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,278
<i>We should do a screening
of The Notebook.</i>

654
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,323
Yes.

655
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,446
I know it's stupid,
but that shit

656
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,947
makes me cry.
Yeah.

657
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,701
I would eat 10 million donuts
after watching The Notebook.

658
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,201
Okay, I got a good one.

659
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,161
How about we get a subject and
then put the subject to sleep,

660
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,543
and then cover him with
blood and chicken feathers

661
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,843
and then put a gun in his hand and
then scream inside of his ear.

662
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,045
(STUTTERING)
For what purpose?

663
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,968
I just want to
see what would happen.

664
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,430
VANEETHA: Okay,
I have an experiment.

665
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,806
I think we get three psych
grad students together,

666
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,765
and we have them come up with the
craziest, most insane experiment ideas

667
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,849
and then we just wait
and see how long it takes

668
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,651
for the new girl to realize that
they're totally screwing with her.

675

Because that masturbation
thing was, like...

676
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,045
That's not a joke,
that's real.

677
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,793

theories are real.

678
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,666

Violet's donut experiment.

681

00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,402
Okay, it sounds great, it does.
There is one issue.

781
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,024
What?
It's very cold out.

782
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,071
So what?

783
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,400
My penis is going to look
super-small for a second.

784
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,155
I've seen your penis
every single way.

785
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,161
Not this small.

786
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,072
Take your pants off.
Let's do it.

787
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,657
It's going to look
like a baby's dick.

788
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,120
Okay, you're ruining
the moment.

789
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,496
I'm just going to
cut you off right now.

790
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:12,702
(WHISPERING) Baby dick.
Okay.

791
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,666
(WHOOPING)

792
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,170
Come on, it's so nice! Fuck it.

793
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,675
Do it!
(CHEERING) Ow!

794
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,170
What? What?
My hip, my hip!

795
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,254
Oh, my God.

796
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,385
I landed on something.

797
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,465
It's a fire hydrant.

798
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,596
What the fuck is a fire
hydrant doing there?

799
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,927
Poor old grandpa.

800
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,057
Oh, God.

801
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,388
Did I just say,
"My hip, my hip"?

802
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:32,939
Yes, you did.

803
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,476
Sorry, babe.

804
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,443
(GUN FIRES)

805
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,779
Oh, God.

806
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,113
I shot him.

807
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:51,033
Right in the brains.

808
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,002
Welcome to your
manhood, Tom.

809
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,168
BILL: Hey, you...

810
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,879
You like my sweater?

811
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,798
Yeah.

812
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:07,966
I knitted it.

813
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,643
Oh, cool. Awesome.
Yeah.

814
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,268
My kids used to take these
really long, boring naps.

815
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:18,318
And, for a while, I just stared at them.
But then I found knitting.

816
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:21,272
I can knit you one if you want.
It's super-cozy.

817
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,731
Here, feel it.

818
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,078
Wow, that actually
is super-cozy.

819
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,659
Yeah.
Yeah.

820
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:35,084
See, I told you this place is awesome.
You just gotta settle into it.

821
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,166
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

822
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:39,789
(HONKING)

823
00:41:56,848 --> 00:42:00,273
Hello!
Look at her.

824
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,395
Let me hold her.

825
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,448
Careful, Violet. Mind her neck.
You did it.

826
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,115
You're so clever.

827
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,656
It's adorable.

828
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,787
See, he calls it an "it."

829
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,837
Dude, Clam Bar.
Booked for an entire month.

830
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,047
You cannot get
a table for 30 days.

831
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:23,625
Thank you so much for quitting, bro.
You made my career.

832
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,336
Oh. Yeah, I did it alt
for you, buddy.

833
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,884
Anyways, so how's Michigan?

834
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:32,889
You know, it's a bit of an adjustment.
But, all in all, it's fine.

835
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,219
Wow.
Sorry.

836
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,304
Have you told her
how much you hate it?

837
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,980
I don't hate it.

838
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,188
A bit of Irish stoicism
never hurt anyone.

839
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,487
Well, I think it hurt
a shitload of Irish people.

840
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,240
Bro, you gotta be
honest with her, man.

841
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,693
I am honest.

842
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,032
No, you're not.

843
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,203
You're not being
honest with me.

844
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,447
You're not being
honest with her.

845
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,747
Don't be a martyr.

846
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,325
Trust me, dude.

847
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:01,458
You need to be honest with this woman.
She's going to be your wife.

848
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:04,462
Like me, for example, when Suzie
told me that she was pregnant,

849
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,917
I was like,

850
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,175
"There's no fucking way
you're keeping this baby."

851
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,344
Because that's what I felt.

852
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,723
I was like, "No.
It's not mine, I know it."

853
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,600
Because I was being honest.

854
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,680
I didn't get caught up on
how that would make her feel.

855
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,770
You know,
I was just being myself.

856
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,568
She, of course,
figured out later

857
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:28,194
that that was just panic
and anger setting in.

858
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,607
And now she knows
that about me.

859
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,317
So, two weeks ago, when I
was trying to talk her into

860
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,118
giving up
the baby for adoption,

861
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,947
she's like, "Is this panic,
and is this anger?"

862
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,874
And I was like,
"Oh, my God, it is.

863
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:40,619
"Let's keep it."

864
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,079
Let's just...
Let's go see your family.

865
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,009
So, darling?
VIOLET: Mmm-hmm?

866
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:56,138
Any ideas when this new
wedding might happen?

867
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,228
Mmm. No...
I mean, not yet.

868
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,896
Because, you know,
we've just moved

869
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,606
and it's just a big
transition, and so...

870
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:05,105
Look, it's never
going to be easy.

871
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:09,231
I mean, you could delay forever.
Like you did with Gideon.

872
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,732
You always need
things to be perfect.

873
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:15,116
Mum, it's hardly the same, all right?
Gideon was a complete tool

874
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,992
and so that's why I was
procrastinating as much as I did.

875
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,414
What's the date?

876
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,283
I don't know yet, Mum. You've
got to make a date, darling.

877
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,333
I don't know yet,
Mum, and I will.

878
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,537
Pick a date. Why is
that so difficult?

879
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,666
It's not difficult.

880
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,088
I'm just saying that
we've just got there

881
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,548
and we're trying
to enjoy ourselves.

882
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,624
Pick a date. Pick it,
pick it, pick it!

883
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,336
Okay. I cannot think with you
yelling "Pick it" at me.

884
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,420
Shh!

885
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,761
You know why you're not sure?

886
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,434
No. Because you've
never been sure.

887
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,683
Okay, what I don't understand
is that you hated marriage.

888
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,640
So why are you
forcing me into it?

889
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:47,026
Well, well, well,
Miss Smarty-pants.

890
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,854
For your information,
I did not hate marriage,

891
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,564
I loved marriage.

892
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,990
I loved your father, always.
I was happy.

893
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,321
That's why I'm so
angry with him now.

894
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,949
I was happy with
that idiot!

895
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,330
I'm sorry I'm
not 23 years old.

896
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,249
I'm sorry I'm
not made in China.

897
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,626
I'm sorry I'm not
Miss Chew Chin Chow!

898
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,752
(EXHALES)

899
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:09,916
(GROANS)

900
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,881
Now look what you've done.

901
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,294
(SUZIE MOANS)

902
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:26,391
Crazy about Alex
and the Clam Bar, right?

903
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,600
Yeah.

904
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,653
It's good, though.
You know, it really is.

905
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,980
It's good for him.

906
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,280
Are you okay about it?

907
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,733
I'm fine.

908
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,747
Um... So, you know
what I was thinking?

909
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,995
I know that we're not
in any rush or anything,

910
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:47,454
but do you think maybe we should
start planning this wedding?

911
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,501
Yes! I was just thinking that.
Yeah?

912
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,627
Okay. Great.
Yes.

913
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,333
I'll take the lead this time.
No.

914
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,260
Listen, you're super-busy.
I've got time to do it.

915
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,589
You can just... Look, pitch
in when you can, but...

916
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,382
Would you really do that?

917
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:02,344
You did everything last time.
It's a two-way street.

918
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,803
Thank you.

919
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,972
Of course.
That's very kind.

920
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,149
You're a very
good planner.

921
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,150
I hope you like Legoland.
(CHUCKLING)

922
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,777
Because that's where
it's going to be.

923
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,651
(CHUCKLING)

924
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:20,779
(SIGHING)

925
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,037
I'm your giant man.

926
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,115
YOU are my enormous man.

927
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,298
Right, so who's
going to be our actor?

928
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,806
Hmm? No, no, please, no.
I really don't want to do it.

929
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,304
Come on, it's simple. You just
explain the personality test,

930
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:44,601
then casually mention

931
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,145
that the day-old donuts will
be replaced by fresh ones.

932
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,312
No, I know what
I'm going to say.

933
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,766
Anyone who takes an old donut has
got impulse control problems.

934
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,146
No, I know, it's just...
I'm going to freeze up.

935
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,226
You're going

for the snacks.</i>

from yesterday.

What do you mean?

Well, you know, I just sensed
something in your voice.

Oh, no.
I don't think so.

No, I...
Well, I mean...

Oh, sorry, look, it's none of my business.
I shouldn't intrude.

You know, it's your and Tom's thing.

Really.

I mean,
it's not a secret.

It's just that... I think I just
wish Tom were happier here.

00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,228
Has he told you
he's unhappy?

971

No, but I can tell.

Listen, I think
Tom is fantastic.

973

But you mustn't let his
situation make you feel guilty.

You've worked hard
to get here. Okay?

You're on the verge,
you know?

It's okay to be selfish.

You're a good person, a very good
person, and Tom will be fine.

It is very interesting that there was
that 25% correlation in both groups

in that subjects who had a

also ate the stale donuts.

to your excellent work.

Something crazy
happened today.

1059
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,936
Winton called me into the
office and hinted that

1060
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,152
they might be
extending my postdoc.

1061
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,656
So, what does that mean
for us, exactly? Um...

1062
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,867
I think what it
probably means is that

1063
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,745
we would stay here just for
a little bit and then...

1064
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,918
Would you like
some of this wine?

1065
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,620
Nope.
No? Okay.

1066
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:49,709
Um, I think the first phase
would be a few years,

1067
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:52,545
and then, potentially,
if that went well,

1068
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:54,846
for longer.

1069
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,677
It sounds like
we're staying.

1070
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:24,290
Look, I know our plans changed, but
they changed because I did well,

1071
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,912
and I know it doesn't
feel like that to you,

1072
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,999
but maybe it's a good
thing that they changed.

1073
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,635
For you.

1074
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,380
Yes, for me, but...

1075
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,765
I've just worked so hard
for my whole life for this.

1076
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,347
I feel like I'm
on the verge, babe.

1077
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,061
And maybe it's okay
for me to be selfish.

1078
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,569
Well, if it's okay
for you to be selfish,

1079
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:57,827
I guess everyone else can just
figure it out on their own.

1080
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,073
Okay, that came out wrong.

1081
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,245
That came out wrong.

1082
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,697
No, I think you said
exactly what you meant.

1083
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:05,910
Academia's my life, Tom. I guess
you just don't understand.

00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,837
(SIGHING) Can I
tell you something?

1085
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,461
It makes me
feel like shit

1086
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,668
when you tell me I don't
understand things.

1087
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,549
Okay. No, listen, I
have news for you.

1088
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,345

Well, I'm sorry.
You're right.

1091
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:23,845
It's just not nice.
Okay, look.

1092
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,225
I'm very excited about
what happened today.

1093
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:28,057
Do you want
to know something?

1094
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,064
As soon <i>as</i> I heard the news, I felt
instantly terrified to tell you.

1095
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,187
Now, there's something
wrong with that,

1096
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,989
that I feel like you
can't share in this with me.

1097
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,065
Even a little.

1098
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,118
I'm happy for you.

1099
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,157
(UNENTHUSIASTICALLY)
Yay! We get to stay here!

1100
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,206
You're being a prick.

1101
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,374
Then I'll just try
to be happy, too.

1102
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,702
That's not being
happy for me.

1103
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:48,786
I want you to be happy.

1104
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,041
That's not being
happy for me.

1105
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,372
That is martyring yourself

1106
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:54,925
and then blaming me for your
perceived lack of success.

1107
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:56,794
Now...

1108
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:58,678
Now I have
a lack of success?

1109
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,890
Well, I don't think you do. I
have a lack of success now?

1110
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:04,309
But you clearly think you do
and that's the problem.

1111
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,847
The fact remains, Tom, that
you work at a cool place,

1112
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,898
but you refuse
to see it as that.

1113
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,567
I ran a kitchen
in San Francisco,

1114
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:13,735
Okay
okay?

1115
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,563
And you have
no idea how it feels

1116
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,398
to be the guy
in a relationship

1117
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,199
and not have a job
that you're proud of.

1118
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,400
It's embarrassing.

1119
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,407
Why haven't we once
talked about the fact

1120
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,363
that you are upset that
you're not running Clam Bar?

1121
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,198
You never talk about it.

1122
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,329
Because I'm a man, and men
and women are different.

1123
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,661
(MOCKINGLY) We don't have to sit
around and talk about our feelings.

1124
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,710
What?
There's nothing to say!

1125
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,714
You say, "I'm upset," Tom!
You say it!

1126
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:38,794
Fine! You want
to talk about it?

1127
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,220
Yes!
I hate it here!

1128
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,717
Thank you!
I hate it here!

1129
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,470
Thank you for...
I think it sucks here!

1130
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,388
I think it sucks my fucking dick!
Great.

1131
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,514
Good for you.

1132
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,594
I hate it!
I hate it here!

1133
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,397
Okay, okay, okay,
but now we move forward.

1134
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,894
Now what should we do?

1135
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:54,068
Would you like to
open up a Clam Bar here?

1136
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,035
You can't get
fresh clams here.

1137
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:07,365
(EXHALING DEEPLY)
I meant it as a metaphor.

1138
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,159
(MIMICKING VIOLET EXHALING)

1139
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,879
You know what?
This is all very confusing.

1140
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,762
And I'm clearly overwhelmed
And I've gotta be honest,

1141
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:25,137
I think the best thing would be for
me to just be alone right now,

1142
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,432
so that I can think.

1143
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,634
Okay.

1144
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,309
I'll just give you
some time then, shall I?

1145
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,185
Well, don't go.
I mean...

1146
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,769
I need you here.

1147
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:41,240
What do you mean? You just
told me you needed time alone.

1148
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:43,488
What do you want? I don't
know what you want.

1149
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,282
I don't want you to go.
Okay.

1150
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,329
I just want to be
alone with you here.

1151
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,452
Can you at least lay down? Okay.

1152
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,162
Like a normal
human being?

1153
00:56:58,707 --> 00:56:59,833
Do you want me just to be...
I want...

1154
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,590
Okay.
I'm trying to be alone.

1155
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,840
Yeah.

1156
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,467
(SIGHS)

1157
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:16,767
I'm sorry.

1158
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,277
I'm sorry, too.

1159
00:57:55,889 --> 00:58:00,269
I know that things are really
complicated right now, babe.

1160
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:03,697
I just want us
both to be happy.

1161
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,568
Do you think
we could do that here?

1162
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,283
No.

1163
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:47,817
TOM: One, two, dinner.

1164
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,277
Damn it!

1165
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:51,987
I missed.

1166
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,754
Is it 7:00 a.m. yet?

1167
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,461
It is somewhere.
(CHUCKLES)

1168
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,435
VIOLET: Cheers, everyone!

1169
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,229
Cheers!
Thanks for coming.

1170
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:20,603
It's so good to
see you guys, really.

1171
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,401
Yeah. Yes, you guys, too.

1172
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:27,448
So, here we've got some venison meat pie.
SUZIE: Mmm-hmm.

1173
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,866
And in the far corner
we have some venison marrow.

1174
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,620
And here we have some
forest-foraged vegetables,

1175
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:37,074
which I foraged myself.
So, enjoy.

1176
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:38,158
Mmm!
SUZIE: Yeah.

1177
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,960
And, honestly, eat as
much <i>as</i> you guys want.

1178
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:43,289
I have three deer
hanging in the garage.

1179
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,590
So, there's plenty
of meat to go around.

1180
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,212
Wow.

1181
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,635
TOM: Oh, my gosh,
how rude of me.

1182
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,383
Can I get anyone
some more mead?

1183
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,639
I've been collecting
the honey myself.

1184
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:55,593
Tom has become something
of an amateur beekeeper.

1185
00:59:56,384 --> 01:00:00,230
It's just at the right stage of fermentation.
(SNIFFS) Here you go.

1186
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:06,900
Drink as much
as you like.

1187
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,741
I feel like I'm drinking
out of Chewbacca's dick.

1188
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,911
Oh, wow.

1189
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:20,788
That's just honey, huh?

1190
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,586
That's really...
It's hurting my teeth.

1191
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,715
So, we're having a boy.

1192
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,135
Oh, my God!
Yeah!

1193
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,678
Congratulations!
Yeah! Thank you!

1194
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,096
That is amazing news.
One of each.

1195
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:35,261
A little prince. One of each,
so we're done, that's it.

1196
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:36,804
Oh, I knew it!
SUZIE: So great.

1197
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,553
You were boobing out when you came in.
SUZIE: Yeah.

1198
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:40,637
Yeah.

1199
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,222
That is so exciting
for you guys.

1200
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,773
I couldn't be
happier for you guys.

1201
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:44,850
Thank you.

1202
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:47,311
I'm not sure that I ever
want to have kids.

1203
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,775
What is it?

1204
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:53,942
I thought you had always wanted kids.
That's silly.

1205
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:58,037
You know, sometimes the biggest
balls are the ones left unused.

1206
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,114
(CHUCKLES)

1207
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,618
What the fuck
did you just say?

1208
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,287
I don't know.
It's an expression.

1209
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:08,624
Do you know what?
I have an idea.

1210
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,380
Tom and I are going to take
care of Vanessa tonight.

1211
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,460
You two are
going to go out.

1212
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,888
And I will prove to you
how fun children are, okay?

1213
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:17,057
Yes. Mmm-hmm.

1214
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,388
Yeah, I don't want
Vanessa to take part

1215
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:20,593
in one of her psychological
experiments.

1216
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,270
It's not an experiment.
SUZIE: I'm fine with it.

1217
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,894
Yes, I am fine doing that.
I need a night out.

1218
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:26,395
You know what, we'll talk
about it and get back to you.

1219
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,475
Done, done.
It's done. Come on.

1220
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:28,856
SUZIE: Honey.
Honey?

1221
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,108
(WHISPERING) Alex, I do.
You don't understand.

1222
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:32,446
Honey, come on. SUZIE: I
think we're doing it.

1223
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,115
He looks like a drifter.

1224
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,738
SUZIE: I don't care
if he's a psycho.

1225
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,115
You go out every night!
I need this.

1226
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,287
Look at him.
SUZIE: I never go out.

1227
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,579
I can hear you.

1228
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,453
SUZIE: Do this for me.
Do this for me.

1229
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,705
When we come back, she'll be
hanging on a hook in the garage.

1230
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,252
SUZIE: Come on. No.
ALEX: I'm telling you.

1231
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:47,454
SUZIE: We're doing it tonight.
Do this for me.

1232
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,710
Well, it's decided,
we're going out!

1233
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:50,836
All right!
All right.

1234
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,133
SUZIE: We're doing it. Yeah.

1235
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:53,210
It's going to be fun.

1236
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,299
Put it on the other side.

1237
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,756
Like that? Should we try to
make another set of steps?

1238
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:58,806
I gotta go and pee.

1239
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,847
Can you just watch her for one second?
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

1240
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,178
Okay.

1241
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,065
How did this
go in together?

1242
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,768
TOM: I don't know, but it kind of
looks like a train, doesn't it?

1243
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,024
I'm going to
put this one here.

1244
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,527
This is all I need.

1245
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:15,986
Totally.

1246
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,165
(LAUGHING)

1247
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:26,534
Tom, where's Vanessa?

1248
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,120
Babe, you have
got to see this.

1249
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:29,671
Tom, where's Vanessa?
What?

1250
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,838
Where is she?

1251
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:33,466
You have to keep
an eye on her.

1252
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,588
She was literally
just right here.

1253
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:36,762
Okay, but you got to
keep an eye, you know?

1254
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,505
Okay, I'm sure she's right around here.
Vanessa?

1255
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,307
Vanessa? Vanessa,
where are you?

1256
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:42,851
Oh, my God, Tom!

1257
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,269
What are you
talking about? Whoa.

1258
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,143
What is your crossbow
doing on the kitchen table?

1259
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:48,644
A crossbow doesn't
clean itself, you know.

1260
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,350
What is it doing there?

1261
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,026
Hey.
Yeah.

1262
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:54,605
Why don't you... Why don't we
come back out here and play?

1263
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:56,447
No. I'm Pocahontas.

(BOTH SCREAMING)
VIOLET: Oh, my God!

1265
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,238
Oh, my God!

1266
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:04,785
All right,
just get to the...

1267
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:07,617
Oh, my God, it's in my leg!
Oh, my God, it's in my leg!

1268
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:08,668
Oh, my God!

1269
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:09,790
(SCREAMING)
Stay calm! Stay calm!

1270
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:10,836
Get it out!
Get it out of my leg!

1271
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:11,913
Get it out of my leg!
Okay! Okay!

1272
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:13,339
I'm gonna pull it out!

1273
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,548
No, no, no,
don't pull it out!

1274
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,625
That'll ruin the meat.

1275
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,131
It's not meat,
it's my leg!

1276
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,553
I got it! Stay calm!
Get it out!

1277
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,047
(SCREAMING)

1278
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:22,891
That's really in there.
Oh, shit.

1279
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,802
Oh, my God!

1280
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,516
My God.
Ugh!

1281
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:28,642
Just put pressure on it.

1282
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:29,723
What happened?

1283
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,774
She shot me
with a crossbow.

1284
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,018
What?

1285
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,905
I want to punch you in the face right now.
Do you understand that?

1286
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,277
I think we should
all just...

1287
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,279
My sister had an arrow
in her leg tonight, Tom!

1288
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,531
It's not an arrow,
it's a bolt.

1289
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:46,160
ALEX: Well, I guess we were totally wrong!
It's a bolt!

1290
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,333
Oh, you're right. You know what,
we're in the wrong, here.

1291
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:52,038
My daughter didn't just witness
herself nearly murdering her aunt!

1292
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,667
There was blood
all over the place!

1293
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:56,796
She's up there freaking out right now!
She shit her pants!

1294
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:59,840
She hasn't shit her pants
in two or three months

1295
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,796
and now she's up there,
shitting her pants!

1296
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,929
She feels responsible for
injuring her aunt, who she loves!

1297
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,389
You understand what
that does to a kid?

1298
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:09,938
You don't! And you don't even give...
You don't care.

1299
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:11,765
It's a good thing you don't
want to be a father,

1300
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,316
because you'd be
a terrible father.

1301
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:17,817
And I don't like this. I don't
like this new "Lamb Chop" Tom!

1302
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:21,942
You lost it, bro. Tether's
cut, you're in orbit.

1303
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:24,069
You're out there.

1304
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,205
God! I'm so sorry!

1305
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:31,125
I'm sorry, but please
don't be so upset.

1306
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:32,961
At least nobody died.

1307

PRIEST: And Grandpa Baba's
last words were,

1308
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,589
"I can't wait until
Violet's wedding."

1309
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,521
Okay, babe, I gotta go.
I'm really late.

1310
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,524
Okay. Mmm. Donuts. Are
you going to eat these?

1311
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,105
No, but those are old.

1312
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:02,031
And if you want to
just wait for a minute,

1313
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,859
I'll be back with
some fresh ones.

1314
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:05,944
Mmm!

1315
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:11,662
These are fine. I didn't
have to wait at all.

1316
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,167
Are you going
to get dressed today?

1317
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,124
I think today is
more of a bunny day.

1318
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:20,671
Yeah.

I love you guys.

You guys are

Except Ming, I don't know. I
just don't think you respect me.

1326
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:48,282
I don't think that
you've ever respected me.

1327
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,238
And I'm just not feeling it,
and I had to be honest.

1328
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:52,699
But to everyone else, to us!

1333
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:02,509
I want to give a toast.
I love all of you so much.

1334
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:06,638
You're my best friends. The best
friends anybody could ever ask for.

I don't like you.

I don't like you.
You're a bitch.

But I love all
of you so much!

Except for Vaneetha,
you're the best!

1341

Calm down, Ming.

Listen, what
I want to know is,

1346
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:48,338
why are professors in movies
always writing stuff,

1347

equations and stuff,
on windows?

I don't know.
I don't get it.

I don't get it, either.
I don't understand it.

1350
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,520
I don't get the fact that my
fiancé behaves like a freak.

These are not
things that I know.

I mean, surely, you know,
in a university

1353
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,903
you wouldn't be far
from a pen and paper,

1354

or a computer,
or an overhead projector...

you're not listening.

Oh, shut up, will you?
Put a sock in it.

Why? I'm coming
to you as a friend.

You're wallowing.
No, I'm not.

Yes, you are.
I'm not wallowing.

1362
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,256
You are wallowing.

1363
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:27,085
What do you know? You don't know
anything about relationships.

1364
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,545
Well, all right,
I'll take that.

1365
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:30,221
When I'm in a relationship,

1366
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:33,846
I'm a complete and
utter control freak.

Are you really? Are you really, though?
But that's not what...

I was just trying
to tell you that

1372
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:45,020
I needed something
different tonight,

1373
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:46,275
and that's it.

No! No, no, no.

was wrong, obviously. Totally.

Yeah.

I'm with Tom.
I apologize.

01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,677
I'm going to go find Tom.
I know that.

1384
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:16,426
It was a friend kissing a friend.
This was bad.

1385
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,637
I kissed you
and you kissed

01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,562
your boss.

1387
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,312
Who are you texting?

1388
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,688
I'm texting myself.

Hey!

off any longer?

Because... I'll tell
you why we put it off.

we had too many problems

off until things got better.

01:34:58,735 --> 01:35:01,909
but your entire
premise is bullshit.

1868
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:03,661
<i>Okay? And would
you like to know why?</i>

1869
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:07,335
Because these imaginary new
donuts that you offer people,

1870
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:09,253
they may never arrive.

1871
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:10,876
Okay, they're not real.

1872
01:35:10,955 --> 01:35:12,423
And me, personally,

1873
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:16,048
I am not the type of person
who wants to sit around

1874
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:19,006
and wait for something
that might never arrive

1875
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:22,763
when they know that the thing
they have in front of them is...

1876
01:35:22,926 --> 01:35:23,973
It's tasty!

1877
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:27,397
<i>It's good, okay?
And you know what?</i>

1878
01:35:27,597 --> 01:35:31,898
It's not about the age of the
donut, it's about the flavor. Boom.

1879
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:36,490
<i>And you know the other thing?
The new donuts,</i>

1880
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:38,783
<i>they're going to get
stale someday, too.</i>

1881
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:41,077
And this is exactly

1882
01:35:41,694 --> 01:35:44,618
what I did not want to happen
when I sent that email.

1883
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:46,244
<i>I think I should just go.</i>

1884
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:48,577
Yeah, no.
Yeah, you should go.

1885
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:51,872
You're clearly
very upset and...

1886
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:53,582
<i>I don't even know
what I said.</i>

1887
01:35:53,831 --> 01:35:55,674
Everything just turned red.

1888
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,631
<i>It's so hot back here.</i>

1889
01:35:58,294 --> 01:36:00,888
It's why people are always
fighting in the Middle East.

1890
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:03,425
It's just, you get so hot.

1891
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:05,601
<i>Tom,</i>

1892
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:08,013
I'm going to go, okay?

1893
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:09,313
Yeah.

1894
01:36:10,265 --> 01:36:11,938
Happy birthday.

1895
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:13,226
Okay.

1896
01:36:15,728 --> 01:36:16,945
Bye.

1897
01:36:18,481 --> 01:36:19,778
Goodbye.

1898
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:30,452
(LAUGHING) ls somebody crying?

1899
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:35,881
Sorry.

1900
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:38,543
Dude, what's up?

1901
01:36:39,877 --> 01:36:41,629
I don't know what
I'm doing, dude.

1902
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:46,393
I just got off the phone with Violet.
And I just feel fucking...

1903
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:48,932
I don't know.

1904
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:50,893
(SIGHS)

1905
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:53,350
I don't know how
I ended up here.

1906
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:55,769
Can I be honest with you?

1907
01:36:56,311 --> 01:36:59,440
You shouldn't be here
working in my restaurant, man.

1908
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:02,405
You should be running
your own restaurant.

1909
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,994
You're a better chef than me,
you always have been.

1910
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:07,037
Everybody here knows it.

1911
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:11,375
Tom, you're fired.

1912
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:14,170
I'm firing you.

1913
01:37:16,748 --> 01:37:18,625
Pack your knives and go.
(LAUGHS)

1914
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:20,926
That's Top Chef.

1915
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:22,883
Yeah, that's Top Chef.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

1916
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:26,842
Seeing you chop
onions is depressing.

1917
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:29,143
It's like watching
Michael Jordan take a shit.

1918
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:32,393
He could probably get it in the
toilet from, like, 30 feet away.

1919
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:33,473
(LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY)

1920
01:37:33,556 --> 01:37:35,604
Three-pointer
from the living room.

1921
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:37,526
Nothing but porcelain.

1922
01:37:38,478 --> 01:37:39,695
Poosh.

1923
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:43,274
Poosh.
Poosh.

1924
01:37:43,649 --> 01:37:47,199
I think about 13 miles to the
gallon, city, 15, highway.

1925
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:50,198
There's a bit of
blood spatter in the back.

1926
01:37:50,281 --> 01:37:51,533
I think it's haunted.

1927
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:54,085
Great crash rating, though.

1928
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:56,914
So, what are you
going to be using it for?

1929
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,340
Food service.

1930
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:02,961
Oh, buddy.

1931
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:16,809
TOM: All right, we're going
to need two more venison.

1932
01:38:17,934 --> 01:38:19,436
Sorry for the holdup,
everybody.

1933
01:38:19,519 --> 01:38:21,647
How's my taco coming?
We good?

1934
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:22,730
Let's get it.

1935
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:25,700
Thanks, I'll see you tomorrow?
All right.

1936
01:38:25,775 --> 01:38:28,278
I just want you to know,
I've had tacos in Oahu.

1937
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:29,658
I've had tacos in Baja.

1938
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:31,239
I've had tacos
in Port-au-Prince.

1939
01:38:31,364 --> 01:38:32,866
I've had tacos
in Buenos Aires.

1940
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:34,872
I've even had
tacos in Guatemala.

1941
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:37,795
These are the best motherfucking
tacos I have ever had.

1942
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:40,248
You're a white guy.
You make tacos like a Mexican.

1943
01:38:40,957 --> 01:38:41,958
Thanks.

1944
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,376
Give me a hug.

1945
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:44,961
Oh, really?

1946
01:38:45,044 --> 01:38:47,012
Give me a hug, now!

1947
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:48,764
All right.

1948
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:51,134
Mmm! You smell like a taco.

1949
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:54,096
Okay, can we get
those tacos ready?

1950
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:57,732
As you know, we have a sufficiency
of qualified candidates

1951
01:38:57,807 --> 01:39:00,230
for a position in
your department,

1952
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:02,778
but you got it.
Congratulations.

1953
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:08,027
You're being promoted to assistant
professor, tenure track. Congratulations.

1954
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:09,656
Holy shit!

1955
01:39:09,735 --> 01:39:10,987
(LAUGHING)

1956
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:15,454
Sorry, that was really
inappropriate, it's just...

1957
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:19,834
Shoot, I am so thrilled.
Thank you.

1958
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:21,873
Congratulations.
Professor Walch.

1959
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:24,050
Bravo, bravo.
Thank you, Professor.

1960
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:25,342
Fudge.

1961
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:28,136
Wonderful.

1962
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:35,636
Doug?

1963
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:37,559
Hey.

1964
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:39,265
Heard your news.
Congratulations.

1965
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:40,725
Thanks.
Yeah.

1966
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:42,143
Where are you going?

1967
01:39:42,477 --> 01:39:45,651
Uh... On my way to
University of North Dakota.

1968
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:49,155
Oh! Well, that's good.

1969
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:51,702
Yeah. No, no, it's great.
I'm excited.

1970
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:53,246
I'm going to be a pioneer.

1971
01:39:53,321 --> 01:39:55,915
I'm going to be the first
black guy to freeze to death.

1972
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:58,246
It's going to be cool.
Yeah, I'm pumped up about it.

1973
01:39:58,326 --> 01:39:59,327
Cool.
Yeah.

1974
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:02,004
It's just like that song.
I get knocked down,

1975
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:04,548
except I get up
again in North Dakota,

1976
01:40:04,624 --> 01:40:06,217
which is the worst
place on Earth.

1977
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:08,052
I'm sorry.

1978
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:09,754
You know what? I'm overreacting.
It's going to be great.

1979
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:13,050
And I couldn't keep up with you and Winton.
I couldn't compete, so...

1980
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:15,351
(SCOFFS)
What do you mean by that?

1981
01:40:16,761 --> 01:40:18,434
I mean, come on,
you know what I mean.

1982
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:20,223
I don't.

1983
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,020
You know what I mean.

1984
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:26,195
Yeah, well, it's not
really like that.

1985
01:40:27,355 --> 01:40:29,403
Uh... No, it's a fact.

1986
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:33,407
Yeah, well, that's not
why I got the...

1987
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:35,280
Ah. A little bit.

1988
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,031
Okay.

1989
01:40:44,247 --> 01:40:45,294
VIOLET: Hey.

1990
01:40:45,373 --> 01:40:47,467
Hey. Here she is.

1991
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:54,056
<i>So, congratulations.</i>

1992
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:55,132
<i>Thank you.</i>

1993
01:40:55,383 --> 01:40:57,977
She got the job? Motherfucker!
Shh!

1994
01:40:58,052 --> 01:40:59,770
It's very exciting.

1995
01:41:02,265 --> 01:41:04,188
How long do you think
I have to decide,

1996
01:41:04,267 --> 01:41:06,065
you know, whether
to take it or not?

1997
01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:08,442
Sorry, I don't
understand the question.

1998
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:09,821
Oh, the position.

1999
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:11,319
I'm just wondering how
long I've got to decide

2000
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:13,322
on whether
I should take it.

2001
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:15,995
Well, you have to take it.
You've got no choice.

2002
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:18,789
Can I ask you something?

2003
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:19,991
Yeah.

2004
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:22,039
Did I get the job
because I deserved it

2005
01:41:22,118 --> 01:41:23,961
or did I get it because you're
trying to keep me here?

2006
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:25,918
You got it because
you deserved it.

2007
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:28,841
Okay. So, I was
the strongest candidate.

2008
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:29,963
Of course you were.

2009
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:31,673
Okay, we should
not be watching this.

2010
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:33,095
You're right,
we shouldn't.

2011
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:35,764
<i>WINTON: I mean, these things
are inherently subjective,</i>

2012
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:38,267
but I certainly feel that
we made the right choice, yes.

2013
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:40,636
I think I just need
you to say "yes" or "no"

2014
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,814
as to whether I was
the strongest candidate.

2015
01:41:42,888 --> 01:41:45,186
Well, why does it
matter so much?

2016
01:41:45,266 --> 01:41:48,065
Because it matters to me. You know,
I want to deserve to be here.

2017
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:49,270
Was I the best?

2018
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:51,815
Who's to say who's
the best or the worst?

2019
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:53,358
I'm better than she is.

2020
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:55,944
No, you're not. It goes
Violet, me, you, then Doug.

2021
01:41:56,027 --> 01:41:58,655
<i>What do these
labels even mean?</i>

2022

Look, just answer me.
Did I deserve the job

2023
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:03,576
or did I get it because you're
trying to keep me here?

2024
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:04,956
It's very simple, Winton.

2025
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:07,080
Violet, why don't
you trust me?

2026
01:42:07,163 --> 01:42:09,291
If you make me answer
that question,

2027
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:11,876
you're violating our
unspoken agreement of faith.

2028
01:42:12,084 --> 01:42:13,210
What does that mean?
What are you talking about?

2029
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:15,137
Well, the question
itself is an accusation.

2030
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:19,058
And I, personally, refuse to
answer an illogical question.

2031
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:20,889
Thanks, Spock.

2032
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:22,060
Spock.

2033
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:23,888
That's a good one. Yeah.
That's a good one.

2034
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:26,815
I mean, it seems that your refusal
to answer means that it's true.

2035
01:42:27,308 --> 01:42:29,151
I'll tell you who's the best.

2036
01:42:35,483 --> 01:42:36,450
Ming.

2037
01:42:36,525 --> 01:42:37,993
Yes! I knew it.

2038
01:42:38,194 --> 01:42:39,366
(IN SING-SONG) I'm the
best, I'm the best.

2039
01:42:39,445 --> 01:42:41,368
What the fuck?

2040
01:42:41,822 --> 01:42:43,244
Ming is the best.

2041
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:44,951
<i>VIOLET: So, you cheated
to get me the job.</i>

2042
01:42:45,034 --> 01:42:48,755
So what if I cheated to get the
woman I love to stick around?

2043
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:49,921
I have a question.

2044
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:51,920
Would you have even considered
my donut experiment

2045
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:53,171
if Doug had suggested it?

2046
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:54,589
Of course not.

2047
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:55,844
(SCOFFING)

2048
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:56,967
WOW!

2049
01:42:58,172 --> 01:42:59,890
Wow.
Okay.

2050
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:04,307
In a way, Ming, it's like
their whole relationship

2051
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:06,435
was the donut experiment.

2052
01:43:06,514 --> 01:43:08,016
Nice.
Thank you.

2053
01:43:08,391 --> 01:43:10,018
Fine, fine, fine.

2054
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:14,613
There will be new
students next year.

2055
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:16,066
There's always a new Violet.

2056
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:19,280
Oh, no!
Oh!

2057
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,737
VANEETHA: He did not.

2058
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:21,862
Um...
Oh.

2059
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:24,449
This was...
Yeah.

2060
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:25,624
Oh, my God!

2061
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:28,374
<i>VANEETHA: Turn off the light. Turn
off the light, turn off the light.</i>

2062
01:43:29,704 --> 01:43:31,001
Violet.

2063
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:24,138
These pancakes are delicious.
Mmm.

2064
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:27,182
They put a cinnamon glaze.
They're dreamy.

2065
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:28,387
You shouldn't
be eating them.

2066
01:44:28,471 --> 01:44:29,518
It's good.

2067
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:32,225
It's why we're here.
We're here to eat, right?

2068
01:44:32,308 --> 01:44:33,355
So, um,

2069
01:44:34,727 --> 01:44:37,276
how about Violet?
How is she doing?

2070
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:39,781
I don't know. You know?

2071
01:44:39,857 --> 01:44:41,609
She still with
that professor guy?

2072
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:43,444
I don't know.

2073
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:45,200
CAROL: What are you doing?

2074
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:46,781
What are you doing, Tom?

2075
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:49,454
I'm just... I'm trying
to eat my breakfast, Ma.

2076
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:53,254
I mean with Violet, and you know it.
Three grandparents are gone.

2077
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:57,050
Your grandparents, long gone. You
know who goes next, don't you?

2078
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:59,172
Us. We go next.
Jesus, Dad.

2079
01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:01,049
Please don't do this, guys.

2080
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:02,880
He's not kidding.
Not kidding.

2081
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:04,636
He's on three different
heart medications.

2082
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:06,308
That's right. Three of them.
Mmm-hmm.

2083
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:08,385
What are you talking about?
Since when?

2084
01:45:08,469 --> 01:45:10,016
Since my last
heart attack.

2085
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:13,065
Dad, you had a heart attack?
(SIGHS)

2086
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,733
I had two, actually.

2087
01:45:14,809 --> 01:45:17,528
The last one was right
after Mom's cancer scare.

2088
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:19,480
A cancer scare?
What are you...

2089
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:21,775
Why didn't you guys
tell me any of this?

2090
01:45:21,857 --> 01:45:23,655
PETE: Well, we didn't
want to bother you.

2091
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:25,782
No. It wasn't your affair.

2092
01:45:26,111 --> 01:45:28,864
Well, is there anything else
you guys haven't told me?

2093
01:45:28,948 --> 01:45:30,245
Well, what else have we...

2094
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:32,577
There's a lot we haven't told you, darling.
We don't share everything.

2095
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:33,627
Your mother was...

2096
01:45:33,702 --> 01:45:35,750
She was briefly hospitalized
for emotional issues.

2097
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:36,831
Well, yes, that's true.

2098
01:45:36,914 --> 01:45:37,915
Yeah.

2099
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:41,051
We told you we were in a
timeshare on Sanibel Island.

2100
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:43,929
Wait, you guys have gone
there, like, four times.

2101
01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:47,850
Well, at least one of the
times, we weren't really there.

2102
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:51,641
I had vaginal reconstruction
surgery last year.

2103
01:45:52,513 --> 01:45:54,265
PETE: That stuff
really works.

2104
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:57,352
And that's why we don't share
everything with our children.

2105
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:02,736
I think I understand why
I have communication issues.

2106
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:04,533
Thank you.
Ma.

2107
01:46:04,692 --> 01:46:06,569
Maybe you should slow down
on the Bloody Marys.

2108
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:07,861
I don't think
you need any more.

2109
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:09,913
Oh.
Let her have it.

2110
01:46:10,281 --> 01:46:11,954
CAROL: You're going to
tell me what to do? No.

2111
01:46:12,032 --> 01:46:12,999
Let her have a drink.

2112
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:15,954
I am going to ask you again.
What are you doing with Violet?

2113
01:46:16,036 --> 01:46:18,038
You're being dumb.

2114
01:46:18,122 --> 01:46:21,342
You are being so
fucking dumb, you idiot.

2115
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:23,340
You love Violet.
I love Violet,

2116
01:46:23,419 --> 01:46:26,013
your father loves Violet
and you're letting her go?

2117
01:46:26,088 --> 01:46:27,385
Fuck you, you dummy.

2118
01:46:29,717 --> 01:46:30,809
Wow.

2119
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:33,854
(LAUGHING) Since when do
you talk like this?

2120
01:46:33,929 --> 01:46:35,397
It's not funny, Tom.

2121
01:46:36,223 --> 01:46:37,600
Okay, fine.

2122
01:46:38,142 --> 01:46:39,359
What are you doing?

2123
01:46:39,435 --> 01:46:41,108
Look, we're not 100%
right for each other.

2124
01:46:41,186 --> 01:46:43,188
And so, there's
nothing to be said.

2125
01:46:43,272 --> 01:46:45,445
CAROL: I got news
for you, moron,

2126
01:46:45,608 --> 01:46:49,988
your father and I, we're not
even 90% right for each other.

2127
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,244
Not even 60, okay?
But he's the love of my life.

2128
01:46:53,324 --> 01:46:55,577
And right now, the love of
your life is going to fly away

2129
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:58,003
and I bet somewhere in the back
of your mind, you're thinking

2130
01:46:58,078 --> 01:47:00,206
that she'll always be there
if you want to try again,

2131
01:47:00,289 --> 01:47:02,712
but you know what? She won't,
because she's the goddamned best!

2132
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:06,091
And some lucky guy is going to make
it work with her no matter what.

2133
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:09,845
Instead of settling for some
23-year-old airhead

2134
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:13,144
who probably doesn't know
who the fucking Beatles are.

2135
01:47:19,642 --> 01:47:21,235
Had to be said.

2136
01:47:22,686 --> 01:47:24,688
Hi, I missed you today.

2137
01:47:25,189 --> 01:47:26,691
That's nice.

2138
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:33,030
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

2139
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:34,956
Listen, I need to

2140
01:47:35,741 --> 01:47:36,742
(SMACKS ups)

2141
01:47:36,825 --> 01:47:39,578
talk to you about
something, Audrey.

2142
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:44,754
What's behind
those eyes, Tom?

2143
01:47:46,627 --> 01:47:51,133
My ex-fiancée has
been on my mind a lot

2144
01:47:51,799 --> 01:47:54,018
and I feel like that's
something I need to explore.

2145
01:47:55,344 --> 01:47:57,267
Well, she's an old bitch!
There.

2146
01:47:57,346 --> 01:47:59,815
I just explored it for you.
Done?

2147
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:04,570
(SOFTLY) It's hard to have
this conversation with you.

2148
01:48:04,645 --> 01:48:06,238
You need to explore it, Tom?

2149
01:48:06,313 --> 01:48:09,237
You were with her for five fucking years.
That's a really long time.

2150
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:10,659
What else is there
to learn about her?

2151
01:48:10,818 --> 01:48:12,411
(GROWLS) Oh, God!

2152
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:13,908
I don't really know
the answer to that,

2153
01:48:13,988 --> 01:48:15,410
but I just think
I need to find out.

2154
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:17,583
What are you thinking?
You're so stupid.

2155
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:19,752
You're so stupid.
You're going to leave me?

2156
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:21,170
You're going to leave this?

2157
01:48:21,245 --> 01:48:24,670
For saggy tits and
a loose vagina? Really?

2158
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:26,838
Oh, God!

2159
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:29,928
I'm sorry to do this to you.

2160
01:48:30,004 --> 01:48:31,426
Shut the fuck up.

2161
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:33,883
You know what?
You should just go, Tom.

2162
01:48:33,966 --> 01:48:37,266
Just go. Go have fun.
Have fun with your old woman.

2163
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:39,062
Go fucking read
at night together.

2164
01:48:39,138 --> 01:48:40,685
You can go through
menopause together.

2165
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:42,766
And you can go get
your little prostates checked.

2166
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:44,944
Check each other
for lumps all the time

2167
01:48:45,019 --> 01:48:47,021
and do those kinds
of things together.

2168
01:48:47,104 --> 01:48:50,278
And then go get some Crocs,
so your back doesn't hurt.

2169
01:48:50,357 --> 01:48:52,280
And then you can
go walk on the beach

2170
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:55,454
and fuck each other with
your gross, wrinkly balls.

2171
01:48:55,696 --> 01:48:58,449
That's another thing.
You're getting fucking fat.

2172
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:00,960
It's really hard to
have sex with someone

2173
01:49:01,035 --> 01:49:03,129
when you can't breathe
underneath them.

2174
01:49:03,203 --> 01:49:06,628
Can't breathe! Like, I feel like
I'm going to die every time.

2175
01:49:06,707 --> 01:49:07,959
(SIGHS)

2176
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:11,342
You should leave.
I'm going to say mean things.

2177
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:15,716
(SOFTLY) Bye

2178
01:49:16,633 --> 01:49:17,634
(BABY WAILING)

2179
01:49:17,718 --> 01:49:19,891
PRIEST: He makes me lie
down in green pastures

2180
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:22,439
and leads me
beside still waters.

2181
01:49:23,098 --> 01:49:27,649
He shall refresh my soul and guide
me in the path of righteousness...

2182
01:49:27,728 --> 01:49:29,605
You're my good one.
(WAILING LOUDLY)

2183
01:49:30,564 --> 01:49:32,362
I am so mad, Alex,
when you say that.

2184
01:49:32,441 --> 01:49:34,284
ALEX: At least I'm not
the one failing <i>as</i> a parent.

2185
01:49:34,359 --> 01:49:35,861
It's all right.
It's all right.

2186
01:49:35,944 --> 01:49:37,821
ALEX: Give him
a couple Vicodin.

2187
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:43,877
Wow. Hi.
Hi.

2188
01:49:44,203 --> 01:49:45,921
Hello.
Hello, Gideon.

2189
01:49:45,996 --> 01:49:47,748
Didn't expect
to see you.

2190
01:49:47,998 --> 01:49:50,251
Just came to say
goodbye properly.

2191
01:49:50,667 --> 01:49:52,590
To my grandmother or...

2192
01:49:52,961 --> 01:49:56,511
Yeah. We actually grew pretty
close towards the end.

2193
01:49:57,257 --> 01:49:58,258
Oh, yeah?

2194
01:49:58,509 --> 01:50:01,513
So, how are you and Tom?
Any kids yet?

2195
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:02,846
Mmm...

2196
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:06,275
No. Tom and I split up
a little while ago, so...

2197
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:07,567
Oh! I'm sorry.

2198
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:09,270
It has been four
years, of course.

2199
01:50:10,354 --> 01:50:11,355
Hmm?

2200
01:50:12,189 --> 01:50:14,283
Nothing. I...
No, go on. What?

2201
01:50:14,817 --> 01:50:16,945
"Four years, of course" what?
Doesn't make sense.

2202
01:50:17,694 --> 01:50:19,537
That's what you do.

2203
01:50:19,738 --> 01:50:23,709
Is it? Is it what I do? Well,
let me just tell you something.

2204
01:50:23,909 --> 01:50:26,207
Tom and I split up
because it wasn't working.

2205
01:50:26,286 --> 01:50:28,163
Not because we weren't perfect
enough for each other.

2206
01:50:28,247 --> 01:50:30,545
Not because I had him
on a four-year timeline.

2207
01:50:30,707 --> 01:50:31,799
Okay'? So don't...

2208
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:33,127
Um...

2209
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,427
This is my daughter.

2210
01:50:35,295 --> 01:50:36,296
Sorry.

2211
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:37,427
She's four.

2212
01:50:37,714 --> 01:50:39,387
This is what
four looks like.

2213
01:50:40,509 --> 01:50:42,807
Hello.
What's your name?

2214
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:44,229
Violet.

2215
01:50:46,098 --> 01:50:47,771
Regret calling her
that now.

2216
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:50,902
Keep meaning to changed it,
but it's a lot of paperwork.

2217
01:50:51,687 --> 01:50:52,984
And I don't want
to confuse her.

2218
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:56,908
Come on, darling. Let's go
and look at the coffin.

2219
01:51:14,251 --> 01:51:15,468
Tom.

2220
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:19,048
Hi.

2221
01:51:21,133 --> 01:51:23,056
I'm just realizing now, it
might be totally inappropriate

2222
01:51:23,135 --> 01:51:24,682
for me to just
show up like this

2223
01:51:24,761 --> 01:51:26,604
but Alex and Suzie
told me what happened.

2224
01:51:26,763 --> 01:51:29,107
I'm so sorry about
Grandma Katherine.

2225
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:32,945
She was sort of the only person in
your family who was ever nice to me.

2226
01:51:34,062 --> 01:51:36,861
And I just felt
like I should come.

2227
01:51:38,108 --> 01:51:40,406
But if that's inappropriate,
or weird at all,

2228
01:51:40,485 --> 01:51:42,032
I can totally go
back to the hotel

2229
01:51:42,112 --> 01:51:44,160
or take a tour of the Tower
of London, or something.

2230
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:47,163
No, no, it's not.
It's...

2231
01:51:48,744 --> 01:51:50,917
It's really nice
to see you.

2232
01:51:52,289 --> 01:51:54,007
It's nice to
see you, too.

2233
01:52:03,967 --> 01:52:05,435
(LAUGHS)

2234
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:30,044
So, what do we do now?
(BOTH LAUGHING)

2235
01:52:34,164 --> 01:52:37,293
Fall semester doesn't
start until August 14th.

2236
01:52:37,709 --> 01:52:40,337
I know that this
sounds crazy,

2237
01:52:41,838 --> 01:52:44,717
but why don't you just come
back to San Francisco with me?

2238
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,555
You could see your sister and we could
spend a couple of weeks together.

2239
01:52:49,805 --> 01:52:51,899
We don't have to worry
about what it means.

2240
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,477
Then we'll go
our separate ways.

2241
01:52:54,643 --> 01:52:55,769
Okay.

2242
01:52:56,561 --> 01:53:01,067
Just, separately, like, I think it's
time to take down the Wham! posters.

2243
01:53:01,149 --> 01:53:02,651
(BOTH LAUGH)

2244
01:53:08,949 --> 01:53:10,371
(INDISTINCT)

2245
01:53:17,624 --> 01:53:18,716
Yeah?

2246
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:20,089
Whoo!

2247
01:53:23,005 --> 01:53:24,348
Thank you.

2248
01:53:27,342 --> 01:53:28,685
(LAUGHING)

2249
01:53:57,372 --> 01:54:00,091
I'm getting all
pieces that are here.

2250
01:54:00,167 --> 01:54:01,669
VIOLET: Here, use these ones.

2251
01:54:02,127 --> 01:54:03,800
(TOY CLATTERS)
VIOLET: Oops! Ooh...

2252
01:54:03,879 --> 01:54:05,426
We lost a tower.
SUZIE: Oh, no, the tower.

2253
01:54:05,505 --> 01:54:06,631
VIOLET: That's it.

2254
01:54:06,923 --> 01:54:10,143
So, you know I'm keeping Tom
company this week, right?

2255
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:11,636
Yeah.

2256
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,097
(LAUGHS)

2257
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:16,642
Alex keeps him company without
also having sex with him.

2258
01:54:17,267 --> 01:54:18,439
I assume.

2259
01:54:18,685 --> 01:54:20,153
What does that mean?

2260
01:54:20,228 --> 01:54:22,401
Mommy, do Elmo voice.

2261
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:27,820
(MIMICKING ELMO) Elmo thinks you
should do what you feel is right.

2262
01:54:28,028 --> 01:54:29,280
(LAUGHING)

2263
01:54:29,363 --> 01:54:32,617
Well, I don't really know what I think is right.
I think I'm just...

2264
01:54:32,741 --> 01:54:34,789
You know, time will
tell, I think.

2265
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:38,839
(MIMICKING ELMO) Elmo
thinks time will tell.

2266
01:54:38,914 --> 01:54:40,712
Would you mind not
doing that Elmo voice?

2267
01:54:40,791 --> 01:54:42,759
'Cause really, you're repeating
back what I'm saying.

2268
01:54:42,834 --> 01:54:46,134
Honestly, (MIMICKING ELMO) Elmo thinks
you should shit or get off the pot.

2269
01:54:46,213 --> 01:54:47,214
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

2270
01:54:47,297 --> 01:54:49,220
Aunt Violet,
do Cookie Monster.

2271
01:54:52,302 --> 01:54:55,647
(MIMICKING COOKIE MONSTER) Me think
that's a really rude thing to say, Elmo.

2272
01:54:55,722 --> 01:54:56,814
(LAUGHING)

2273
01:54:58,183 --> 01:55:02,905
Elmo say it been five years,
almost five years.

2274
01:55:02,979 --> 01:55:04,606
You either love him,
or you don't.

2275
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:07,442
Me love him, but it's
very complicated.

2276
01:55:07,609 --> 01:55:09,737
Cookie doesn't get
everything handed to him

2277
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:12,243
on a (WHISPERS) fucking
silver platter like Elmo.

2278
01:55:12,948 --> 01:55:15,827
Cookie got the
career he wanted.

2279
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:18,628
Tom moved to Michigan
so Cookie could work.

2280
01:55:18,703 --> 01:55:21,957
Okay. Elmo wanted
to be a kinesiologist

2281
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:26,591
and instead, Elmo is cleaning
puke off her shirt every day.

2282
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:29,674
Well, maybe as nice
as these little Elmos are,

2283
01:55:29,756 --> 01:55:31,929
Elmo should have considered
using protection.

2284
01:55:32,134 --> 01:55:35,229
"C" is for condom. That's
good enough for me.

2285
01:55:35,554 --> 01:55:40,685
Elmo is very happy with
Elmo's little Elmos, okay?

2286
01:55:40,767 --> 01:55:43,270
Elmo would just like
a break once in a while.

2287
01:55:43,395 --> 01:55:44,567
Fine.
Elmo never gets a break.

2288
01:55:44,646 --> 01:55:48,071
This is fine. But this is precisely
why Cookie wants to take the time

2289
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:51,029
to consider if he's picked
the right cookie for his life.

2290
01:55:51,111 --> 01:55:54,035
Well, maybe Elmo thinks
there is no right cookie.

2291
01:55:54,114 --> 01:55:56,287
You just pick one
and take a bite.

2292
01:56:03,832 --> 01:56:05,175
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Sorry.

2293
01:56:07,794 --> 01:56:10,638
(MIMICKING ELMO)
Elmo is sorry, too.

2294
01:56:12,466 --> 01:56:13,467
(SIGHS)

2295
01:56:13,550 --> 01:56:15,018
Whose was better?

2296
01:56:15,594 --> 01:56:17,062
Mommy's better.

2297
01:56:20,557 --> 01:56:24,812
(MIMICKING ELMO) The worst choice
you can make is no choice at all.

2298
01:56:26,396 --> 01:56:30,117
Okay? Snack time!
Time for a snack.

2299
01:56:30,859 --> 01:56:33,658
Huh? It's time
for a snack.

2300
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:36,163
(EXCLAIMING PLAYFULLY)

2301
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:39,038
My favorite! Just kidding.
I love you both.

2302
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:41,912
Come get a snack.

2303
01:56:49,711 --> 01:56:51,258
What time is your flight?

2304
01:56:51,338 --> 01:56:52,590
Um... 1235.

2305
01:56:57,177 --> 01:56:59,521
This is stupid.
What are we doing?

2306
01:56:59,596 --> 01:57:00,688
What do you mean?

2307
01:57:00,764 --> 01:57:02,437
I drive a taco truck.

2308
01:57:02,599 --> 01:57:05,944
Okay? I can work anywhere,
and it's just ridiculous.

2309
01:57:07,521 --> 01:57:10,115
It's stupid for us
not to give this another shot.

2310
01:57:11,107 --> 01:57:13,451
Because I love you so much.

2311
01:57:14,444 --> 01:57:16,822
And I'm not going
to let you go.

2312
01:57:17,197 --> 01:57:19,450
Do you remember
the day that we first met?

2313
01:57:19,616 --> 01:57:22,039
The New Year's Eve party.

2314
01:57:22,118 --> 01:57:23,461
Yeah, how can I forget?

2315
01:57:27,374 --> 01:57:30,878
Do you remember how a year
later, we made that list

2316
01:57:30,961 --> 01:57:32,838
of what our marriage
would be like?

2317
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:35,223
We were going to have 50 kids.

2318
01:57:35,298 --> 01:57:37,346
If I recall,
we settled on 25.

2319
01:57:37,425 --> 01:57:39,268
We did settle on 25.

2320
01:57:42,222 --> 01:57:43,565
That was so dumb.

2321
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:45,146
(LAUGHS)

2322
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,602
Okay, I'm going to need you
to pull off on this exit.

2323
01:57:47,686 --> 01:57:48,778
Why?

2324
01:57:49,062 --> 01:57:51,064
Just pull over on
this exit over here.

2325
01:57:51,147 --> 01:57:52,114
No, we can just...

2326
01:57:52,232 --> 01:57:53,484
Tom, you're going to miss it!
Quick. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Sorry. I'm sorry.

It was just imperative that we

Because I'm trying
to propose to you.

we can figure out

we'll have some after.

when we got to the airport.
