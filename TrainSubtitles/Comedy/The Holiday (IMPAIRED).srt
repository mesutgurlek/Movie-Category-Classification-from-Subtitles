1
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:12,238
IRIS: l have found almost everything
ever written about love to be true.

2
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:16,033
Shakespeare said,
"Journeys end in lovers meeting."

3
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,619
Oh, what an extraordinary thought!

4
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:22,206
Personally, I have not experienced
anything remotely close to that,

5
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,543
but I'm more than willing
to believe Shakespeare had.

6
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:29,005
I suppose I think about love
more than anyone really should.

7
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,843
I'm constantly amazed by its sheer power
to alter and define our lives.

8
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,847
lt was Shakespeare who also said,
"Love is blind."

9
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:42,477
Now that is something I know to be true.

10
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,578
For some, quite inexplicably, love fades.

11
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,930
For others, love is simply lost.

12
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:28,856
But then, of course, love can also be found,

13
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,693
even ifjust for the night.

14
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,034
And then there's another kind of love,

15
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,577
the cruellest kind,

16
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,247
the one that almost kills its victims.

17
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,500
lt's called unrequited love.

18
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,128
Of that, l am an expert.

19
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,259
Most love stories are about people
who fall in love with each other,

20
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,094
but what about the rest of us?

21
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,720
What about our stories,

22
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,640
those of us who fall in love alone?

23
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,601
We are the victims of the one-sided affair.

24
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,728
We are the cursed of the loved ones.

25
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,105
We are the unloved ones,

26
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,648
the walking wounded,

27
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:14,110
the handicapped without the advantage
of a great parking space.

28
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,071
Yes, you are looking at one such individual

29
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:22,910
and l have willingly loved that man
for over three miserable years,

30
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,746
the absolute worst years of my life.

31
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,040
The worst Christmases, the worst birthdays,

32
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,878
New Year's Eves brought in
by tears and Valium.

33
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:35,798
These years that l've been in love
have been the darkest days of my life,

34
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,759
all because l've been cursed
by being in love with a man

35
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,512
who does not and will not love me back.

36
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,890
Oh, God, just the sight of  him.

37
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,393
Heart pounding, throat thickening,
absolutely can't swallow.

38
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,604
All the usual symptoms.

39
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:53,274
Oh, Jasper. Don't tell me you're still...

40
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,694
No, no, no, no, that's over. Very over.

41
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,696
What's the story with you two, anyway?

42
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,489
You were shagging him, weren't you?

43
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,867
More importantly,
l was in love with him, truth be known.

44
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,368
Yes, yes, l remember.

45
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,204
Then you found out he was shagging
that drip from Circulation.

46
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,373
Which is when l stopped shagging him.

47
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,959
l don't think we should be talking
about this at the office party.

48
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,378
But l always see you two together.

49
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,757
He cheated on you, but you stayed friends?

50
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,344
l was head over heels, you know?
Everyone knew.

51
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,762
Oh, no.

52
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,932
-Does it look like l'm crying right now?
-No, no, no. No, no, no.

53
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,268
No, it just looks like it's the smoke
from my cigarette.

54
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,521
Did he ever actually tell you
that he loved you back?

55
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,608
Yes. Three, almost four times

56
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,277
and when l've reminded him of that,
he said that it must have been

57
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:43,032
as an answer to a question,
which, by the way, it absolutely was not.

58
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:47,203
You know, lris, when you catch your guy
with another woman,

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,705
you're not supposed
to stay friends with him.

60
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,958
You're supposed to never talk
to the prick again.

61
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,544
You're supposed to throw things at him,
scream, call him names,

62
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,881
-not do his blooming laundry.
-l don't do his laundry.

63
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,384
Did someone tell you l do his laundry?

64
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,806
No, no, all we do now is we e-mail.

65
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,891
Not when he's with her, of course.

66
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,144
Also, when he's not with her,
we talk on the phone,

67
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,563
sometimes for hours,

68

to come crawling back into your life...

Actually, he has made
some small comments like that recently.

Severe stress
makes women age prematurely,

that single women over the age of 35

by a terrorist than to get married?

Okay, that was horrible, but now
our generation is also not getting married

01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:57,388
This is an exceptionally great tent.

1075
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:01,351
-lt's got something, hasn't it?
-lt's cozy.

1076
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:06,689
-Yeah. Who cut out all these beautiful stars?
-We did.

1078
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:22,538
-Amanda?
-Yes?

1079
01:23:22,623 --> 01:23:25,583
-You smell lovely.
-Do l?

1080
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:29,796
Yes. l love perfume,
but he won't let me wear it.

1081
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:33,299
Because you already smell so good.

1082
01:23:33,801 --> 01:23:36,552
-So do you, by the way.
-Thanks.

1083
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:39,806
-But l'm older, so l guess l'm allowed.
-Exactly.

1084
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:44,894
-l like your eye shadow.
-Thank you.

1085
01:23:45,104 --> 01:23:48,815
-And your lipstick.
-Thank you. lt's new.

1086
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:54,570
-What's it called?
-l think it's called Berry Kiss.

1087
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,614
Okay, Berry Kiss it is.

1088
01:23:58,409 --> 01:24:00,785
Berry Kiss.

1089
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:06,457
-Let's see. Looks good on you.
-Amanda?

1090
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:10,962
You know, if you wanted to sleep over,
that would be all right.

1091
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:13,297
We could push our beds together.

1092
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:16,092
Sorry.

1093
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:21,347
That's so sweet of you to invite me,
but maybe another time.

1094
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:24,142
-Would that be all right?
-Yes.

1095
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:28,855
Good girl.

1096
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:36,112
We never have grown-ups here
that are girls.

1097
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:40,116
-l know.
-l really like it.

1098
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,826
Me, too.

1099
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:05,183
l can't imagine anyone
being a bigger hit with my children.

1100
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,811
They're really great, Graham.

1101
01:25:08,896 --> 01:25:12,023
Sophie's unfortunately taken on the role
as my protector.

1102
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:15,276
She's brilliant, but l hate it
when she worries about me.

1103
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:19,155
And Olivia's gonna be a real ball-buster

1104
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:23,367
which, l must admit,
l kind of love about her.

1105
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:27,580
l'm just trying to figure out
why you didn't tell me about them.

1106
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:30,958
Because l just don't usually
tell women about them.

1107
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:32,960
But it... lt's just a little confusing,

1108
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:36,881
because you're the one who wanted to go
out to lunch to get to know one another.

1109
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:40,384
When you put it that way, it sounds awful.

1110
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:45,431
l have no defense, except that
until l get to know someone really well,

1111
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:48,267
it's easier for me to be a normal single guy.

1112
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:51,562
Because it's way too complicated
to be who l really am.

1113
01:25:52,773 --> 01:25:58,069
l'm a full-time dad. l'm a working parent.
l'm a mother and a father.

1114
01:25:58,195 --> 01:26:02,532
l'm a guy who reads parenting books
and cookbooks before l go to sleep.

1115
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:06,285
l spend my weekends buying tutus.
l'm learning to sew.

1116
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:10,748
l'm Mr. Napkin Head!
l'm on some kind of constant overload,

1117
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:17,004
and it helps to compartmentalize my life,
just till l figure this out.

1118
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:20,758
This past weekend,
the children were with their grandparents

1119
01:26:20,843 --> 01:26:23,636
and when they're gone,
l get to be somebody

1120
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:26,472
who doesn't have hot chocolate
spilt on his jeans.

1121
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:30,768
l have no idea how to date and be this

1122
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:37,984
and l suppose there's the possibility
l'm afraid of what another person might do

1123
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:42,196
to who we are and how we get
from one day to the next.

1124
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:48,786
Yeah.

1125
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:52,707
l guess since l am leaving in a week,

1126
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:58,045
l sort of get you not telling me, sort of.

1127
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:03,301
l thought it would be hard to introduce them
to someone l may never see again.

1128
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:10,182
Right.

1129
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:15,563
'Cause l'm just someone you had
sex with once and slept with twice.

1130
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:19,400
Actually, l thought l was just someone
you had sex with once

1131
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:21,652
-and slept with twice.
-Oh, man.

1132
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:27,533
-l think we just went way past complicated.
-Right.

1133
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,410
l'm a book editor from London.

1134
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:35,583
You're a beautiful movie trailer maker
from L.A.

1135
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:39,170
We're worlds apart.

1136
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:42,673
l have a cow in the backyard.

1137
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:45,092
-You have a cow?
-Yeah.

1138
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:47,011
l sew and l have a cow.

1139
01:27:48,055 --> 01:27:50,222
How's that for hard to relate to?

1140
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,437
Pretty up there.

1141
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,190
Exactly.

1142
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:15,039
-Morning, Jesus.
-Good morning.

-Santa Anas?
-Oh, yeah, long time now.

1144
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:18,960
-Hi, Marta.
-Hi, lris.

1145
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:23,923
Hi, there.

Hello.

1147
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:30,888
-Good morning.
-l counted.

1148
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:33,724
Nine movies are opening today.

1149
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:36,769
l remember when nine movies
would open in a month.

1150
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:41,607
Now, a picture has to make a killing
the first weekend or they're dead.

1151
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:45,820
This is supposed to be conducive
to great work?

1152
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:48,906
Arthur, have you always been this feisty?

1153
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:52,284
Well, l may have slowed down a little,
but yes.

1154
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:54,161
You've got to fight the fight, kid.

1155
01:28:55,789 --> 01:28:59,792
Okay, your mail. Gas company, phone bill

1156
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:03,838
and you've got a letter
from the Writers Guild ofAmerica, West.

1157
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:09,510
Are you watching
the movies l recommended?

1158
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:13,764
Yes! Love them. lrene Dunne is fantastic.

1159

-Gumption.
-Oh, my God, tons of it.

1160
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:20,438
Arthur, don't you want to open that letter
you just threw in the bin?

1161
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:23,524
No. They keep writing me
about the same thing.

1162
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:26,736
-But it might be important.
-lt's not.

1163
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:29,989
They want to arrange
some kind of tribute to me.

1164
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:34,035
A night with me.
l don't know, it sounds God-awful.

01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:36,871
What are you talking about?
That sounds brilliant!

Why am l attracted to a person
l know isn't good?

1288
01:36:51,181 --> 01:36:55,100
l happen to know the answer to this.
Because you're hoping you're wrong,

1289
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:58,187
and every time she does something
that tells you she's no good, you ignore it,

1290
01:36:58,271 --> 01:37:00,981
and every time she comes through
and surprises you, she wins you over

01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:05,068
and you lose that argument with yourself
that she's not for you.

1292
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:06,945
Exactly.

1293

"l can't believe a girl like that

"would actually be with a guy like me."

You know what she said to me tonight?

She said she finished in Santa Fe
after two days

and has been staying
with whatever-his-name-was,

1298
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:22,920
which means she's been right here in town,

1299
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:25,172
which means when l spoke to her
this morning on her cell,

1300
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:28,091
and she said, "l'm looking
out my window and it's snowing,"

l understand feeling as small
and as insignificant as humanly possible,

1321

chardonnay you drink with your girlfriends,

you still go to bed every night
going over every detail,

or how you could have misunderstood.

to figure this thing out

because it makes us feel so good
to feel this way

that l'm leaving in eight hours

because you're leaving

to feel this way,

or did before you went off like that.
