Oh! Damn it!

480
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:36,977
Terry, time!

481
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:39,780
18 minutes, 28 seconds.
You broke the record!

482
00:17:39,814 --> 00:17:41,314
Yes! Nice!

483
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:42,715
Well done.

484
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:44,151
<i>(Jake) All in a day's work,
elderly lady.</i>

485
00:17:44,185 --> 00:17:47,619
All in a day's work.

486
00:17:47,654 --> 00:17:49,321
Ah, there he is!

487
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:50,722
[Applause]
<i>Yeah!</i>

488
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:53,025
The record is ours.

489
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:54,459
That's so amazing, Jake.

490
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:57,429
Check it out.
I got us prizes.

491
00:17:57,463 --> 00:17:59,531
Sweet. "Victim."

492
00:17:59,532 --> 00:18:00,599
<i>(Amy) I can't believe
your final kill</i>

493
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:01,666
came with Scully's move.

494
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,367
You went upsy-downsies?

495
00:18:03,368 --> 00:18:05,270
That's what I call it, because
you hold the gun upside-down.

496
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:07,105
Yes, Scully,
I went upsy-downsies.

497
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:09,073
And none of you will ever
speak of it again.

498
00:18:09,108 --> 00:18:10,975
But I want to speak of it.
You looked really dumb.

499
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,344
[Chuckles]
Man, I feel so good.

500
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:14,712
Almost makes me
want to start

501
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:16,147
taking things seriously
all the time,

502
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:18,515
but them I'm like,
"boobs, fart, boobs, whatever."

503
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:20,583
Alright, let's go.
Drinks are on me.

504
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:24,087
Nice!
Here we go, nine-nine!

505
00:18:24,122 --> 00:18:26,089
Actually, Teddy
asked me to get dinner,

506
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,970
so maybe I can meet up
with you guys afterwards?

507
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:30,794
Oh. Neat. Yeah.
Of course.

508
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:31,829
Cool.

509
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,963
Boobs. Fart.
Boobs, whatever.

510
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,239
So I just talked to Vivian.

511
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,906
I told her I really want you
to come to the wedding,

512
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:41,906
and she said okay.

513
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:43,643
Thanks. I'm excited to go.

514
00:18:43,677 --> 00:18:46,979
Also, "STD" stands for
"sexually transmitted disease."

515
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,314
That is correct.

516
00:18:48,315 --> 00:18:50,383
It is, however, very expensive
to reprint those cards,

517
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:52,185
so we're leaning into it.

518
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:55,320
Rosie Diaz,
will you accept my STD?

519
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:57,556
I look forward
to having it forever.

520
00:18:57,557 --> 00:18:59,191
Mm. [Giggles]

521
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:00,959
<i>(Terry) Well, congratulations,
everyone, on a perfect run.</i>

522
00:19:00,993 --> 00:19:03,995
And a new course record.

523
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,497
[All cheer]

524
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:07,465
And congratulations to you,
Captain,

525
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:09,500
on beating your
Kwazy Cupcakes addiction!

526
00:19:09,535 --> 00:19:10,801
[All cheer]
<i>Captain Holt!</i>

527
00:19:10,835 --> 00:19:13,971
Okay, I had to tell them.
It's my nature.

528
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:16,407
You helped me today,
so I'll give you

529
00:19:16,408 --> 00:19:17,841
a pass on
embarrassing me publicly.

530
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:19,777
Thank you.

531
00:19:19,811 --> 00:19:21,912
I feel that the reason I was
so vulnerable to this game

532
00:19:21,913 --> 00:19:24,147
was because technology
has evolved to the...

533
00:19:24,182 --> 00:19:25,415
Yeah, I don't know.

534
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,017
I think it's just bright
and stupid and fun.

535
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:29,219
So fun.

536
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,854
So fun.
So fun.

537
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:34,191
[Sighs]

538
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:37,294
<i>(Charles) What's going on,
Vic Kovac?</i>

539
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:39,195
What do you think
Amy sees in Teddy?

540
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:41,530
So you do like her.
I'm just curious.

541
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:43,365
I mean, I guess
he's okay-looking.

542
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:44,633
And he's a good cop.

543
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:45,601
They're both kind of dorky
about police stuff.

544
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:46,968
Also, he set
the course record,

545
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:49,438
but that's nothing. I broke it,
like, 20 minutes later.

546
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:52,308
You want to know why she went
out with him and not you?

547
00:19:52,342 --> 00:19:53,442
Yeah.

548
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:57,144
Because he actually
asked her out.

549
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:00,548
Hey, Vivian.

550
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,450
Rosa.

551
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,752
I'm here to celebrate
with the team.

552
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,222
Look, I'm not really
good at this stuff, but...

553
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:09,257
Thank you for inviting me
to your wedding.

554
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:10,592
I'm really happy I could come,

555
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:12,226
and I promise it won't
be weird at all.

556
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:13,594
Yeah, I'm really happy
you could come too.

557
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:14,561
'Cause I didn't think
it was gonna happen.

558
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:16,530
What do you mean?

559
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:17,564
Well, Chuck told me you were

560
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:18,898
gonna be out of town
that weekend,

561
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:21,067
and then, you know, he just told
me that your plans changed,

562
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:23,002
so, uh... so yeah,
so that's great news.

563
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:24,238
Why would it be weird?

564
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:27,806
Um, it'd be weird
'cause I'm weird.

565
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:28,841
Oh.

566
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:32,411
Whooo...

567
00:20:32,412 --> 00:20:33,646
I'm leaving.

568
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:37,750
<i>(Amy)
Night, everyone.</i>

569
00:20:37,784 --> 00:20:40,720
Hey, Amy.
Check it out.

570
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:42,121
No way, you won coolest kill?

571
00:20:42,155 --> 00:20:43,388
Not even close.

572
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:44,756
It turns out anyone
can just buy themselves

573
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:45,995
a children's karate trophy.

574
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:47,705
Smart.
Yeah.

575
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:50,666
Hey, before you go,
I wanted to ask you something.

576
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:52,796
<i>(Amy)
Of course.</i>

577
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,331
I was just wondering...

578
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:55,366
Are you wearing lipstick?

579
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:57,801
Yeah, I'm going out
with Teddy again.

580
00:20:57,802 --> 00:20:59,270
Does it look weird?

581
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:01,104
I called my 13-year-old niece
for makeup tips,

582
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:02,773
but I don't know
if I trust her.

583
00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:04,241
She is so sexual.

584
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:05,842
You look great.

585
00:21:05,843 --> 00:21:08,010
Thank you.

586
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:09,612
So what's up?

587
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:12,415
Oh. It's not important.

588
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:13,849
<i>I just had a question
about a work thing.</i>

589
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,318
But have a great date,
and we'll talk tomorrow.

590
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,019
Okay.

591
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,690
Bye.
Bye.

592
00:21:22,326 --> 00:21:25,960
I'll help you with
your work stuff, Jakey.

593
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:27,244
Perfect.
