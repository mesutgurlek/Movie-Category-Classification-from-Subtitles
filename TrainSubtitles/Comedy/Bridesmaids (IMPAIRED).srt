I mean, it's fine,

he's been distant lately.

And I don't know...

97
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,391
He calls me
"dude" a lot.

every time.

110
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,214
And then we go through this,
and then you feel like shit,

111
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,719
and it's almost
like you're doing it

112
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,321
because you feel
bad about yourself.

113
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:34,122
He called me late,
and we hung out.

114
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,821
It wasn't a big deal.
And you know what? It was fun.

115
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,255
Ew! You had
sex with him.

116
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,632
We had an
adult sleepover.

117
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,329
Ooh. Did you let him
sleep over in your mouth?

118
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,399
Annie!
I'm sorry!

119
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:55,447
You're unbelievable.
He kept putting it near my face.

120
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:56,906
They do that,
don't they?

121
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,107
Why do they do that?
Let us offer.

125
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,516
You don't want to
look right at it.

126
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,817
No.

127
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,952
It's too aggressive.
It's like...

128

"Hello."

129
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,521

but I can't
because I have elbows.

133

Look, I know you say he's
cute and all that stuff,

135
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,045
but it makes you feel
like shit, you know?

136
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,114
You're a total catch,
and any guy

137
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,250
would be psyched
to be your man.

138
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,679
You should just
make room

139
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,212
for somebody who
is nice to you.

140
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,313
You know what?
He's honest!

141
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,119
He told me that
we are what we are

142
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,022
and we're just having fun.
And I like that.

143
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,291
He also told you that you need
dental work. He's an asshole.

144
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,191
I don't need dental work.

145
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:52,830
You're right.

146
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,165
There is nothing
wrong with my teeth.

147

Oh! Only 15!

I don't want

156
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,221
to pick up your monkey lamps.
Sorry!

157
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,385
Monkey lamps?

158
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,329
Ugh. I cannot wait to never
work for a psychopath again.

159
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:21,925
Oh! Annie!

160
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,969
I'm sorry. I should

ANNIE: Well, I'm the genius that
opened a bakery during the recession.

162
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,074
They were good cakes,
Annie.

163
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,474
Thank you.

164
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,674
Come on. Look away,
look away, look away.

165
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,545
Do you have any
ideas of styles?

166
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,780
Oh, I don't know.
What do you think, honey?

167
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,081
Whatever you want.

168
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,190
Look at how you guys are
making this decision together.

169
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,417
That's sweet. You guys
love each other, huh?

170
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,995
Yeah.
Yeah.

171
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,861
Ohh! That's sweet.
That will go away.

(WHISPERING) You cannot

Especially someone you're
in a relationship with.

175
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,441
'Cause they're living with you,
you don't

176
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,043
know who you're sleeping next to.
It is scary.

177
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,739
I mean, look at him.
He may not even be Asian.

178
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,915
It is scary.

179
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,814
So did you guys want to look
at these engagement rings?

180
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,154
We're going to browse.
Okay, sure.

181
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,552
I'll be here.

182
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,760
Thank you.

183
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:27,666
What was that about?

184
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,529
Umm, nothing. They had to run.
They had to go somewhere.

185
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,798
And no wonder.
You're selling lifelong happiness.

186
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,931
You're not telling everyone
about your problems

187
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,509
and how your
boyfriend left you,

188
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,167
and maybe marriage
will work out.

189
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,812
Show me your
"love is eternal" face.

190
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:47,446
No, that's two years,
four years tops. That is not eternal.

191
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,317
Kahlua, can you come over
here for a second, please?

192
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,118
What's up, Don-Don?

193
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,785
You make up
the best nicknames.

194
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,691
You don't need a nickname
because Kahlua is so delicious.

195
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,990
Don't sue me
for touching you.

196
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,594
Show Annie your
"love is eternal" face.

197
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,802
That looks like you
have menstrual cramps.

198
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,367
Thank you so much,
Kahlua.

199
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,042
Now, why can't you
be more like Kahlua?

200
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,175
Look, I'm trying
really hard.

201
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,377
You've just
got to try harder.

202
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,284
The whole reason you
have got this job, Annie,

203
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,324
is because your mom is my sponsor in AA,
and I'm doing her a favor.

204
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,392
I understand.

205
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,995
Oscar, get back to work.

206
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:34,893

Guess what happened to me today.
Hmm. What?

214
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,250
I got a free tattoo.
You did what?

215
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,190
I could not believe it.
The guy said, "Do you want a tattoo?"

216
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,264
Just a random...

217

Yeah, opened up the side of his van.
No.

218
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,600
He said, "It's for free!"
And I said, "Sure."

You said yes?
Yeah!

Yeah. Look.
See here?

00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,938
What is it?

222
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,074
See that?

223

Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Brynn!

224
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,078
It's a Mexican drinking worm.

225
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,412
It's a Native American
symbol meaning "wasted."

226

Okay, Brynn,
just so you know, it's...

Gil, hi.
Hello. How are you?

228
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,950
Have you seen your sister's tattoo?
It's really infected.

229
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,183
Better get
a little bit of ice on it.

230
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,452
Yeah, a little bit.

231
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,892
Stick some
frozen peas on there.

232
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,021
Yeah. It can't hurt.
All right.

00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,898
if I could get
your check, too?

237

Yes.
I'm getting the money.

Yes. Yes.
Yeah.

What?
I know!

That's why he's
been acting so weird

'cause he's a terrible liar,
and he thought he was gonna blow it.

I forgot. I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

318
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,864
I keep telling you, you're not
supposed to go to those things.

319
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,024
You're not an alcoholic.

320
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,068
Only because I've
never had a drink.

What?
They are inspiring.

322
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,973
There is this one story I've
just got to tell you. Sit down.

323
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,406
Okay.

324
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,942
This gentleman

325
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,173
who started blow-jobbing to get crack.
His name is Marvin Johnson...

326
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:20,043
Mom, anonymous. You keep...
It's no names. Okay, okay.

327
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,379
Forget it.
Marvin J. Whatever.

328
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,053
Too late.
Well, he became a gay prostitute.

329
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,455
And he realized that
he had hit his bottom.

330
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,084
And I have been thinking,
honey,

331
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,028
that maybe this
is your bottom.

332
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:36,929
I'm telling you,
hitting bottom is a good thing.

333
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,764
Because there's
nowhere to go but up.

334
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,667
Because there's
nowhere to go but up.

335
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,172
Right?
Yep. That's what you say.

336
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,465
Yeah, a positive message.
Yeah.

337
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,640
Yeah. Thanks for
the pep talk, Mom.

338
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,804
Honey. Anytime, anytime.

339
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,610
All right. I guess I'm going to
Lillian's party by myself, then.

340
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,015
Don't talk to me
about being by yourself.

341
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,416
I go everywhere
by myself.

342
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,046
Thanks to that
new whore, Barb.

343
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,920
Mom, come on.
No, I don't like to say it.

344
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,822
They've been
married 12 years.

345
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,757
Okay.
But she's still a whore.

346
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:07,320
I'm sure she greets him in the evening,
beaver first.

347
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:11,357
I don't want to
think about that.

348
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:12,458
You sure you don't
want to move in with me?

349
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,198
Mom, thanks,
but no way.

350
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:16,603
No way in hell.
Yeah?

351

No, thanks.

Okay.

Yeah, I kind of do.
Okay.

I'm going to go. All right.

They are cute,

And I swear to God,
that dolphin looked not at me,

but into my soul.

Into my goddamn soul, Annie.

And he said,
"I'm saving you, Megan."

432
00:19:52,672 --> 00:19:56,904
Not with his mouth, but he said it,
I'm assuming, telepathically.

all of you for coming.

473
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:45,150
And here's to Doug and
my baby girl, Lillian.

474
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:47,181
Cheers!
Cheers!

475
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:48,810
I love you, Dad.
LILLIAN'S DAD: Enough of me.

476
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:50,582
Let's get the maid
of honor up here.

477
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:52,784
All right.
Annie?

(CHEERING)

479
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:57,486
Umm. Hi.
I'm Annie Walker.

480
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,956
Yay, Annie!

481
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,436
I'm not going to go on with a big
speech, so I'll just say this.

482
00:22:06,172 --> 00:22:09,005
I'm so happy to be
a part of this celebration.

483
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:10,973
And you two
deserve each other,

484
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:13,008
as well as
a lifetime of happiness.

485
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:14,443
Thank you.
ANNIE: Cheers.

486
00:22:14,547 --> 00:22:16,208
Love you guys.
GUESTS: Cheers.

487
00:22:16,382 --> 00:22:17,747
Thanks, Annie.
Cheers.

488
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:22,885
Thank you, Annie.
That was so sweet. Thank you.

489
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:27,181
Lil, remember that trip we
took to Miami with the boys?

490
00:22:28,261 --> 00:22:29,990
And they were
working the entire weekend,

491
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:32,656
and we just sat and drank
wine and ate peanut brittle.

492
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:36,667
And I shared things with you that
I've never shared with anyone.

493
00:22:37,003 --> 00:22:41,940
And you made me realize
how I can trust people again.

494
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:43,965
So let me just say,

495
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:47,309
Lillian,
you are my best friend.

496
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:50,381
(CRYING) And I'm
so proud of you.

497
00:22:51,884 --> 00:22:54,910
Sorry. And, Dougly...

498
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:57,086
I'm sorry, inside joke.

499
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:01,989
You better not
keep my Lil on a leash

500
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:03,959
because I still need my
drunken Saturday nights

501
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:06,190
at Rockin' Sushi, okay?

502

(CHEERING)

503

to the couple of the decade,

504
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:14,264
Doug and Lillian.

Have a great night.
Dessert wine is out.

508
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:25,673
Dessert wine, yummy.
Excuse me.

509
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:27,853
Umm...

510
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:31,279
I just wanted to say
really quick that (SIGHING)

511
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,882
you are so special
to me, because...

512
00:23:34,994 --> 00:23:37,929
Well, one of the reasons is because
I've known you my whole entire life.

513
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:41,996
And you've really
helped shape who I am.

514
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:46,431
I just want to thank you
for carefully selecting me

515
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:48,268
as your maid of honor.

516
00:23:48,374 --> 00:23:51,241
I know you had
some other choices,

517
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,705
but you are like my sister,
and I love you.

518
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:57,572
Well, that concludes
the speeches for the night.

519
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,679
Thank you.
One last thing.

520
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:03,050
It's rare to meet someone as an
adult who you really connect with,

521
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:04,213
and that's you, Lil.

522
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:06,955
I went to Thailand recently
with my husband, Perry,

523
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:10,392
and there is a beautiful
saying that I learned there.

(SPEAKING THAl)

525
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:20,335
It means,
"You are a part of me,

526
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,931
"a part that I could
never live without,

527
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:26,842
"and I hope and I pray
that I never have to."

Thank you all for coming.

say really quick...

Consuelo?

534
00:24:40,026 --> 00:24:41,357
Really quick.
Speaking of Consuelo,

535
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,726
Lillian and I took
Spanish together in school.

536
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:49,666
And so, I would just like to say to you,
and to everyone here...

537
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:50,802
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

538
00:25:11,857 --> 00:25:13,552
Thank you.

539
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:16,526
Thank you. I feel so close
to you and can trust you.

540
00:25:16,629 --> 00:25:18,927
You are my
angel and soul mate.

541
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:24,128
And I feel I can communicate
with you with simply a look.

542
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:29,073
Thank you for coming.

543
00:25:29,175 --> 00:25:31,575
Here, I'll take that.
I'll take that.

544
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:34,703
Yep, I got it.

LILLIAN: Man,
engagement parties rule.

558
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:28,426
It made me feel awesome,

559
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:31,196
like I can go out and catch
another dude to marry.

560
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:37,039
So, what's up with her,
anyway? With Helen?

561
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,408
What?
I'm just like...

562
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:41,245
I don't know.
She's in your wedding

563
00:26:41,347 --> 00:26:43,474
and you've only known her
eight months, though, right?

564
00:26:43,782 --> 00:26:45,511
Come on. Get it out,
get it all out.

565
00:26:45,618 --> 00:26:51,318
I'm just... Like,
the whole gown, and the... thing.

566
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:53,254
It's just weird, right?
You know what?

567
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:55,691
She's actually
really cool, Annie.

568
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:58,092
She's really... She's a good one.
I'm telling you.

569
00:26:58,464 --> 00:27:01,524
Well, I'm sure if you
like her, I will like her.

570
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:04,092
You have to just
get to know her.

571
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:05,966
Yeah.
Which I think you really should.

572
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,902
And... Will you
just do me a favor?

573
00:27:08,007 --> 00:27:09,474
Would you just hang
out with her once,

574
00:27:09,642 --> 00:27:11,109
just the two of you.
All right?

I'm not drunk. I told you.

Ha ha. Very funny.
Can I stop walking now?

You can stop walking when
I tell you to stop walking.

Hey, look.
If I was drunk,

would I be able to do this?

Stop it. Stop it.
Please, stop.

Please, stop. I believe you.
You are not drunk.

have to give you a ticket.

You have to have them.

God, those have been out for a year.

Look, please.

00:28:34,293 --> 00:28:35,885
Please, I promise
I will get them fixed.

You did? Where?

610
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:12,494
I had a bakery on the main
part of the street there.

Yeah!
That was you?

615
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:25,532
That was me.

616
00:29:26,712 --> 00:29:27,940
You made good cakes.

617
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:30,737
Thanks.

618
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:33,943
You used to make these
little pastry things,

619
00:29:34,053 --> 00:29:37,784
and you'd put something in them,
like a cream or a custard...

620
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:39,212
Cream puffs.

621
00:29:39,325 --> 00:29:41,589
Cream puffs,
that's what you call them. Delicious.

622
00:29:42,728 --> 00:29:46,289
I used to get served
by this tall, broad guy,

623
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:47,888
with, like, a wormy face.

624
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:50,694
Yeah, that was my boyfriend.

625
00:29:52,771 --> 00:29:54,261
Sorry.
No, no. It was...

626
00:29:54,373 --> 00:29:57,638
He was my boyfriend,
and then he left me

627
00:29:57,743 --> 00:30:01,372
when the business
went under. So, anyway...

You're kidding?

629
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,715
What a dick.

630
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:08,886
I'm glad
I never tipped him.

631
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:15,385
You know what?
Let's forget about this.

632
00:30:16,362 --> 00:30:18,193
Let's just forget this one.
Really?

633
00:30:18,297 --> 00:30:19,924
Under one condition.
What? What?

634
00:30:20,032 --> 00:30:21,124
Get your
taillights fixed...

635
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:23,098
I promise. I promise I will.
I promise. Thank you.

636
00:30:23,202 --> 00:30:24,294
...before you kill someone.

637
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,562
I'm not going to
kill anybody.

638
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:27,104
All right.
Here, there's your ID.

639
00:30:27,272 --> 00:30:28,705
And I'm going
to give you this.

640
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:31,401
It's a buddy of mine.
He has a body shop in Milwaukee.

641
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,171
He'll fix those
right up for you.

642
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:35,640
Bill Cozbi?

643
00:30:35,914 --> 00:30:37,176
Yeah, with a "Z."

644
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:39,445
Different guy.
Yeah.

645
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:41,917
And don't mention the whole
"Bill Cosby" thing to him.

646
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,420
It drives him nuts.
I mean it.

647
00:30:44,523 --> 00:30:46,821
Okay, I get it. Thanks.

648
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:49,723
You know what? If you mention my name,
that I referred you,

649
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:51,625
he'll give you a particularly good deal.

650
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,857
My gosh. Thank you.

651
00:30:53,966 --> 00:30:56,161
I really appreciate it.
Thanks.

652
00:30:56,268 --> 00:30:58,862
Okay. Well,
I appreciated your cakes.

653
00:30:58,971 --> 00:31:00,734
So, we are even.

654
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,966
That's me, there.
Rhodes. Officer Rhodes.

655
00:31:03,075 --> 00:31:04,201
That's really
nice of you.

656
00:31:08,414 --> 00:31:10,075
Thank you.

We are not all bad.

658
00:31:11,784 --> 00:31:13,012
What?

659
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:14,483
I was just saying,
we are not all bad!

660
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:16,152
Oh. Yeah.

661
00:31:16,255 --> 00:31:18,917
Actually, the rest of
them are, but not me.

662
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:20,514
I'm the best of them.

663
00:31:20,793 --> 00:31:21,919
Okay. Thank you.

664
00:31:22,694 --> 00:31:23,854
Anyway.

665
00:31:24,363 --> 00:31:25,352
Thank you.

666
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:16,438
I didn't know
you played tennis.

667
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:18,407
Yeah, I played a little in high school.

668
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:20,304
I'm so glad we
were able to do this.

669
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:22,774
I'm really glad we could do this, too.
It's nice we get to hang out.

670
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:24,075
I know, right?
Yeah.

671
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:26,047
It's too bad Lillian
couldn't play with us today.

672
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:27,277
Poor thing, she is so busy.

673
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:28,612
Ohh. I know.

674
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,414
But she's not really
that into sports.

675
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,055
Even when we were little,
she didn't like anything

676
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:34,523
that was too competitive.

677
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:37,627
She certainly enjoys
playing tennis now.

678
00:33:37,729 --> 00:33:39,424
It's funny how
people change, isn't it?

679
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:42,800
Yeah. I mean, I don't know.
Do people really change?

680
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:44,457
I think they do.

681
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:47,830
Yeah, but, I mean, they still
stay who they are, pretty much.

682
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:50,470
I think we change
all the time.

683
00:33:50,976 --> 00:33:55,037
I think we stay the same,
but grow, I guess, a little bit.

684
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:57,577
I think if you are growing,
then you are changing.

685
00:33:57,683 --> 00:34:01,016
But, I mean, we are changing from
who we are, which we always stay as.

686
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,609
Not really,
I don't think so.

687
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:04,312
I think so.
I don't.

you guys up to?

00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:19,028
Going to the snack bar.

697
00:34:19,137 --> 00:34:21,002
Awesome. You need
a ride home later?

698
00:34:21,306 --> 00:34:22,739
Fuck off, Helen.

699
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:26,371
Okay. Put a quarter
in the swear-jar.

700
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:29,176
Good to see you.

(ANNIE WHOOPING)

713
00:35:23,035 --> 00:35:26,471
I've seen better tennis
playing in a tampon commercial.

714
00:35:30,976 --> 00:35:31,943
Umm...

715
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:34,308
I've been thinking, and...

716
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:37,173
Brynn needs to start
paying rent. That's it.

717
00:35:37,282 --> 00:35:38,579
She's been here
long enough.

718
00:35:38,684 --> 00:35:41,585
The three of us live here,
it's not fair for me to be paying half.

719
00:35:41,787 --> 00:35:44,255
We split it three ways.
What do you say?

720
00:35:44,356 --> 00:35:46,824
Well, she can't work.
She's on a tourist visa.

721
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:49,553
Yeah. So, technically,
I'm only allowed to tour.

722
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:50,923
Well, you know...

723
00:35:51,096 --> 00:35:52,358
I have no way
of earning money,

724
00:35:52,464 --> 00:35:55,092
unless I just go and
prostitute down on the street.

725
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,895
I don't want you
to do that, no.

Here I am."

No, we did that.
All right.

you're talking about anymore.

Yeah.

If she doesn't
start paying...

733
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:10,640
BRYNN: I'm not.
...she has to leave.

734
00:36:11,016 --> 00:36:12,506
Is this about
the diary again?

735
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:13,675
What diary?

736
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,614
Your diary proved
very interesting to read.

737
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:18,787
You read my...
You read my journal?

738
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,053
At first, I did not know
that it was your diary.

739
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,186
I thought it was a very sad,
hand-written book.

740
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:28,159
What? That does not
make any...

741
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:29,994
But, because of
the deep personal details

742
00:36:30,102 --> 00:36:32,536
and the bits that mentioned Gil
and Brynn... ANNIE: No, no, no, no.

743
00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:34,331
Don't read my journal!
GIL: And the crumbs.

744
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,667
Then...
Don't go in my room!

745
00:36:35,774 --> 00:36:39,870
Well, hello! I think,
before you make those sort of demands,

746
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:41,275
you need to,
maybe, think about

747
00:36:41,446 --> 00:36:42,743
putting a note on
your door saying,

748
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:46,112
"Do not come into my room,
read my diary and wear my clothes."

to this part of town before.

Look, you can get your
checks cashed next door.

I know it looks a little
scary on the outside,

752
00:37:03,335 --> 00:37:05,633
but the food is really good,
authentic Brazilian.

753
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:08,201
ANNIE: I'm telling you,
this is where Brazilians come to eat.

754
00:37:08,306 --> 00:37:09,637
I got to say, Annie's
really good at this.

755
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:11,368
She always drags me
to the weirdest places

756
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:13,204
and the food is
always incredible.

757
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:15,006
And plus, you get a lot for
your money, too. So that's good.

758
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:19,693
All right. Let's do it.
Let's do it.

Oh...

776

It's not good to eat a
big meal before a fitting.

00:38:05,711 --> 00:38:07,042
I feel a bit bloated, so...

778
00:38:07,146 --> 00:38:09,239
Not me.
HELEN: No?

779
00:38:09,415 --> 00:38:10,439
No. Physically,
I don't bloat.

00:38:24,797 --> 00:38:26,856
Yeah?

786
00:38:26,966 --> 00:38:29,059
The other night,
I'm slaving away,

787
00:38:29,235 --> 00:38:31,328
making a beautiful
dinner for my family.

788
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:34,797
My youngest boy comes in and
says he wants to order a pizza.

789
00:38:35,074 --> 00:38:36,735
I said, "No, we're not
ordering pizza tonight."

790
00:38:36,843 --> 00:38:39,311
He goes, "Mom,
why don't you go and fuck yourself?"

791
00:38:39,846 --> 00:38:41,143
He's nine.

792
00:38:42,815 --> 00:38:44,146
Okay, now that
Lillian's in the bathroom,

793
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,582
I just wanted to talk to you guys
about the shower really quick.

794
00:38:46,686 --> 00:38:50,087
I was thinking it
could be French-themed,

795
00:38:50,189 --> 00:38:51,520
since she's always wanted
to go to Paris her whole life.

796
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:56,633
So I figured we
could bring Paris here

797
00:38:56,811 --> 00:38:59,803
and have champagne
and little cookies.

798
00:38:59,914 --> 00:39:01,381
They'd say "Lillian
and Dougie" on them.

799
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:03,039
We can dip them in
chocolate fondue,

800
00:39:03,151 --> 00:39:05,779
and get cheese from
the nice part of the store.

801
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,688
I love that.
Good idea, Annie.

802
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:09,780
We can have French invitations,
the whole thing.

803
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:10,983
Don't you think
that'd be nice?

804
00:39:11,092 --> 00:39:13,060
That's adorable!
That's really cute.

805
00:39:13,161 --> 00:39:14,822
Good. Great.

806
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:16,590
I don't know.
It's really cute.

807
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:18,666
But I feel like,
personally, the Paris theme's

808
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,824
a bit,
"Been there, done that."

809
00:39:21,036 --> 00:39:22,298
I just feel
like we can top it.

810
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:23,735
We should throw
some ideas around.

811
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:26,033
See if anyone else
has a theme they had in mind

812
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:27,665
or something
they'd been thinking of.

813
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:30,008
What about
a Pixar-themed shower?

814
00:39:30,845 --> 00:39:32,972
And we all come dressed as
our favorite Pixar character.

815
00:39:33,181 --> 00:39:37,447
That, and I'll just snowball on
top of that, also <i>Fight Club.</i>

we pull in.

818
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:46,987
Lillian doesn't know, so it's,
"Surprise! We're going to fight!"

819
00:39:47,195 --> 00:39:48,753
We beat the shit out of her.

820
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:51,121
She's not going
to forget that.

821
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:53,264
We just fucking attack.

822
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:55,531
Can I be honest?
No.

823
00:39:55,637 --> 00:39:58,800
I'm at home with three boys all day,
every day.

824
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:00,204
What about
the bachelorette party?

825
00:40:00,575 --> 00:40:01,701
That's what's more important.

826
00:40:02,143 --> 00:40:04,304
I've got a new tube top,
I want to cut the tags off.

827
00:40:04,412 --> 00:40:06,312
I'd like to take
advantage of this opportunity.

828
00:40:06,848 --> 00:40:08,645
Where are we going?
MEGAN: I'm going to second her.

829
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,342
We'd better blow this shit out.
Yeah.

830
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:13,080
That poor girl, Lillian,
who we're all here for,

831
00:40:13,188 --> 00:40:15,554
is in the bathroom probably
bawling her fucking eyes out.

832
00:40:15,857 --> 00:40:17,722
Because she's realizing,
"Holy shit!

833
00:40:17,826 --> 00:40:19,555
"I've got to spend the
rest of my life with Doug."

834
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:22,789
He's my brother. I love him.
But he is a fucking asshole.

835
00:40:22,897 --> 00:40:24,592
I think we can all
agree on that, right?

836

We can...
We'll figure it out.

I mean, I can think of stuff,
and it will be great.

We don't want to upstage
Lillian with a big fancy dress.

882

Maybe we should just get
something kind of simple.

00:44:34,282 --> 00:44:35,772
My dress was
probably just tight.

940
00:44:35,883 --> 00:44:37,180
Oh, my God.

941
00:44:37,285 --> 00:44:39,549
You got food poisoning from
that restaurant, didn't you?

942
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:43,118
No, I had the same thing that she
had and I feel fine. (RETCHES)

943
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:44,823
Oh, my... Okay.
Oh, no.

944
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:46,526
Why is this happening?
Nothing is happening.

945
00:44:46,694 --> 00:44:47,661
(FARTING)

946
00:44:47,795 --> 00:44:48,955
Oh, my God.
(FARTING)

947
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,393
RITA: I don't really care
which dress we get.

948
00:44:51,499 --> 00:44:53,558
It doesn't matter to me. I just
need to get off this white carpet.

949
00:44:53,668 --> 00:44:55,101
Oh, God. Okay.
No, not the bathroom.

950
00:44:55,203 --> 00:44:57,899
Everybody go outside.
I'm serious!

951
00:44:58,005 --> 00:44:59,905
There is a bathroom
across the street.

952
00:45:02,143 --> 00:45:04,338
I think everybody
has the flu.

953
00:45:07,014 --> 00:45:08,072
Shit!

954
00:45:08,216 --> 00:45:09,183
(RETCHING VIOLENTLY)

955
00:45:09,484 --> 00:45:11,645
I need the toilet!
I need the toilet!

956
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:12,720
(GROANING)

957
00:45:13,488 --> 00:45:15,388
I need the toilet!

958
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:16,957
No!

959
00:45:18,025 --> 00:45:20,755
No. No, Megan.
No! No!

960
00:45:20,862 --> 00:45:22,523
Look away!
Megan, no!

961
00:45:22,663 --> 00:45:23,721
Look away!

(GROANING)

964
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,331
You don't look
very well, Annie.

965
00:45:32,573 --> 00:45:33,562
I feel fine.

966
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:37,775
Are you sure?
It wasn't that gray kind of lamb?

967
00:45:37,879 --> 00:45:39,608
You ate a lot of
that weird chicken.

968
00:45:40,047 --> 00:45:41,571
Was it that?

969
00:45:41,716 --> 00:45:43,946
No. I'm...

970
00:45:44,051 --> 00:45:45,177
I... I feel fine.

971
00:45:46,421 --> 00:45:49,151
I think you'd just feel
better if you threw up.

972
00:45:51,526 --> 00:45:53,187
I don't have...
I don't have to throw up.

973
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:54,762
(RETCHING)

974
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:56,919
I am so sorry.

975
00:45:57,031 --> 00:45:57,998
Get away from me!

976
00:45:58,966 --> 00:45:59,955
You're not sick?

977
00:46:00,067 --> 00:46:01,056
No.
No?

978
00:46:01,169 --> 00:46:04,229
In fact, Helen, I'm hungry.

979
00:46:04,338 --> 00:46:06,465
And I wish I had a snack.

980
00:46:06,707 --> 00:46:07,696
You're hungry?

981
00:46:08,743 --> 00:46:10,176
I'm starving.

982
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:12,737
What did we eat?

983
00:46:14,115 --> 00:46:15,980
The sink is a goner.
What are you doing?

984
00:46:16,117 --> 00:46:17,709
It's coming out
of me like lava!

985
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:19,984
(RETCHING)
Oh, my God.

986
00:46:20,154 --> 00:46:21,485
Don't you
fucking look at me!

987
00:46:21,789 --> 00:46:23,017
(RETCHING)
(GROANING)

988
00:46:23,925 --> 00:46:24,892
Hmm?

989
00:46:25,426 --> 00:46:26,393
Jordan almonds.

990
00:46:26,861 --> 00:46:27,828
These are great.

991
00:46:28,629 --> 00:46:29,926
Thank you.

992
00:46:40,475 --> 00:46:41,635
Better?

993
00:46:42,844 --> 00:46:44,072
I was...
I was just hungry.

994
00:46:44,245 --> 00:46:45,473
Yeah.

995
00:46:46,814 --> 00:46:49,146
Annie, everybody is really
sick from that restaurant.

996

(GROANING)

997
00:46:50,918 --> 00:46:52,476
But it wasn't the restaurant.
No, no, no, no.

998
00:46:52,587 --> 00:46:53,986
Lillian, where are you going?
No.

999
00:46:54,088 --> 00:46:55,112
I need a bathroom.

1000
00:46:56,157 --> 00:46:57,146
Lil!

1001
00:46:57,258 --> 00:46:58,225
No. No.

1002
00:46:58,326 --> 00:46:59,350
Lil, where are you going?
(TIRES SCREECHING)

(HORN BLARING) HELEN:
Be careful. What are you doing?

1004
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,757
It's happening.
It's happening.

1005
00:47:04,932 --> 00:47:06,593
It's happening.
It's happening.

1006
00:47:09,804 --> 00:47:11,499
It happened.
ANNIE: What are you doing?

1007
00:47:11,606 --> 00:47:12,971
It happened.

1008
00:47:14,141 --> 00:47:16,666
No. Don't you
dare ruin that dress!

1009
00:47:17,678 --> 00:47:19,168
Ohh. You're really
doing it, aren't you?

1010
00:47:19,347 --> 00:47:20,871
You're really
shitting in the street.

(HORN HONKING)

1012
00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:32,988
We'll just take five
of the Fritz Bernaises.

1013
00:47:33,094 --> 00:47:34,686
Thank you, Whitney.
They really do look better.

1014
00:47:34,795 --> 00:47:36,285
Right.
Thank you.

1015
00:47:40,517 --> 00:47:41,745
You okay?

1016
00:47:43,853 --> 00:47:47,186
I just took a shit in
the middle of the street.

1017
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,882
I just shit.
People do that.

1018
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:52,951
I shit... I shitted in
my shorts. I shit myself.

1019
00:47:58,935 --> 00:48:00,766
That was fun.
Oh, my gosh.

You know what I was thinking?

1022
00:48:06,276 --> 00:48:09,006
You should come with me
to Lillian's wedding, maybe.

1023
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,446
Not like that.
Not like anything serious.

1024
00:48:11,548 --> 00:48:13,345
But just like
a fun time, you know?

1025
00:48:13,483 --> 00:48:18,011
We can get dressed up,
and we can go dancing and have a drink.

1026
00:48:18,121 --> 00:48:19,383
It'll be fun, right?
(GROANS)

1027

No. I mean,
I don't want to make you have to explain

1028
00:48:22,892 --> 00:48:25,656
to all those people
what our relationship is.

1029

That would suck for you.
Right?

00:48:30,567 --> 00:48:31,864
Yeah. I guess so.

No, it's okay.

I can ask, anyway. So...

Who is this George?

He is a very hot, nice guy

who likes me a lot,
and would probably love to be my date.

do this to you?

Probably.

You know what?
It's getting really late.

1051

Hi.

00:50:08,413 --> 00:50:09,607
Hey.
Hey.

1057
00:50:09,915 --> 00:50:12,145
What brings you
in here so early?

1058
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:15,310
I've just had a bad night.
Boy stuff. Ohh.

1059
00:50:16,521 --> 00:50:18,045
Do you want me
to arrest anybody?

1060
00:50:18,156 --> 00:50:19,123
I could do that.

1061
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:20,258
Actually... No.

1062
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:23,719
Do you want to talk to a cop about it?
We are just like priests.

1063
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:27,523
Except we can tell everybody
about it afterwards.

1064
00:50:27,632 --> 00:50:28,621
Oh.
I won't, though.

1065
00:50:29,167 --> 00:50:30,361
Doesn't sound very inviting.

1066
00:50:32,037 --> 00:50:33,163
You want a carrot?

1067
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,402
Right now?
Yeah.

1068
00:50:37,008 --> 00:50:39,169
I'll share.
I've got plenty.

1069
00:50:40,212 --> 00:50:41,270
Sure, I'll have a carrot.

1070
00:50:41,446 --> 00:50:42,504
Yeah?

1071
00:50:42,614 --> 00:50:43,808
Okay.

1072
00:50:44,516 --> 00:50:46,450
Ohh. Yeah,
that sounds rough.

1073
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:48,877
It's going to
get better, right?

1074
00:50:48,987 --> 00:50:49,976
I wouldn't have
thought so.

1075
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:53,080
You know, my sister was a maid
of honor at our cousin's wedding,

1076
00:50:53,191 --> 00:50:56,752
and she found it so stressful,
her hair started falling out.

1077
00:50:57,028 --> 00:50:58,757
That's terrible.
Yeah.

1078
00:50:58,864 --> 00:51:00,957
It grew back,
but it was...

1079
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,967
It was pretty gross.

1080

Planning a wedding
should be fun.

If I ever had a wedding,

1082

I'd want everybody
to be stress-free.

1083
00:51:10,509 --> 00:51:12,204
I'd like it to be
like a carnival.

1084
00:51:12,677 --> 00:51:16,738
Like, people win prizes for
guessing the bride's weight.

00:51:16,848 --> 00:51:18,179

1086

Yeah.
You know?

1087
00:51:20,085 --> 00:51:21,109
Mmm-hmm.
You could have elephants,

1088
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:23,551
and the bride and groom can
walk on a little tightrope.

1089
00:51:23,655 --> 00:51:26,453
Okay, what you are talking about there,
that's a circus wedding.

It's a totally different...

Yeah.

stressing out about this wedding,

1093
00:51:33,732 --> 00:51:36,292
you know what you
should be doing?

done with that.

What?

00:51:45,177 --> 00:51:47,008

00:58:12,664 --> 00:58:15,258
Take two, you'll fall asleep,
wake up and we'll be there. Here.

1254
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,333
(PLANE RATTLING)

1255
00:58:16,901 --> 00:58:19,267
Ma'am, you're going to have to
return to your seat, please.

1256
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,970
It's fine.
Okay. All right.

1257
00:58:21,072 --> 00:58:23,040
STEWARDESS: Ma'am!
All right. All right.

1258
00:58:24,275 --> 00:58:27,506
Oh, my God, I feel terrible.
I should be sitting back there with her.

1259
00:58:27,612 --> 00:58:30,513
I shouldn't be up here in first class.
I feel like such a jerk.

1260
00:58:30,615 --> 00:58:32,515
Lil, this is
your weekend, okay?

1261
00:58:32,684 --> 00:58:34,584
You are treating yourself.
Just relax.

1262
00:58:34,819 --> 00:58:36,343
She will be fine.
She will make friends.

1263
00:58:36,454 --> 00:58:38,547
There is much more sense of
community in coach, I promise you.

1264
00:58:38,656 --> 00:58:39,714
She'll be fine.

1265
00:58:43,127 --> 00:58:45,823
I can't believe you've never
been with anybody else.

1266
00:58:46,764 --> 00:58:47,890
Just Kevin.

1267
00:58:51,469 --> 00:58:52,902
I'm sorry. I just...

1268
00:58:53,204 --> 00:58:55,570
Becca, I just can't
help but feel bad for you.

1269
00:58:56,007 --> 00:58:58,339
You don't even
know what you want.

1270
00:58:58,543 --> 00:59:00,340
I got to know where
you keep the gun, man.

1271
00:59:00,612 --> 00:59:02,944
I mean, is it ankle,
hip, lower back?

1272
00:59:03,181 --> 00:59:05,775
You don't...
Between the cheeks, do you?

1273
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:10,877
No, I don't stick a gun up my butt.
That's stupid.

1274
00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:12,081
I didn't say "up."

1275
00:59:12,357 --> 00:59:15,918
I just knew of a guy,
that guy did a lot of undercover work.

1276
00:59:16,227 --> 00:59:20,095
And all I know is he had tape
marks all up and down his cheeks.

1277
00:59:20,965 --> 00:59:22,091
That can't be true.

1278
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,493
People don't keep
guns up their asses

1279
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:27,036
because if you needed to use it,
how are you going to get it?

1280
00:59:27,205 --> 00:59:28,604
He cut a hole in his pocket.

1281
00:59:28,806 --> 00:59:30,603
What?
In his back pocket.

1282
00:59:31,075 --> 00:59:32,337
You have got to get
something out of your ass

1283
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:34,434
and you cut a hole in
the back of your jeans,

1284
00:59:34,545 --> 00:59:36,410
you want to tell me
you can't get to something?

1285
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:40,141
I don't have a gun for you to
put up my ass to make your point.

1286
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:42,344
I can put my Nano.
I will show you.

1287
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:43,818
I will...
If you get me scissors,

1288
00:59:43,988 --> 00:59:45,353
I will cut
a hole in my pocket.

1289
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:49,758
And you will never find this
again until I want you to find it.

1290
00:59:51,029 --> 00:59:55,466
Kevin can only have sex in bed,
in the dark, under the covers,

1291
00:59:55,566 --> 00:59:56,897
only after
we have showered

1292
00:59:57,502 --> 00:59:58,867
separately.

1293
01:00:00,004 --> 01:00:02,029
And sometimes,
by the time we are finished

1294
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:04,265
cleaning ourselves,
he's too tired.

1295
01:00:05,209 --> 01:00:09,873
And then I pretend I'm tired, but I'm
not tired. I'm not tired. I'm not tired.

1296
01:00:10,081 --> 01:00:13,050
That's why every girl needs
those slutty college years.

1297
01:00:13,251 --> 01:00:16,846
To experiment, get it out of your
system, find out what you like.

1298
01:00:17,622 --> 01:00:20,921
Excuse me, could I have a glass
of alcohol when you get a chance?

1299
01:00:21,859 --> 01:00:24,692
Two double
Seven and Sevens.

1300
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,097
Is that...

1301
01:00:27,298 --> 01:00:29,425
You will like it.
It's sweet.

1302
01:00:30,134 --> 01:00:31,101
I have to go
to the bathroom.

1303
01:00:31,302 --> 01:00:34,203
But I heard about a woman who
went to the bathroom on a plane.

1304
01:00:34,405 --> 01:00:36,396
She got sucked
into the toilet.

1305
01:00:37,442 --> 01:00:39,034
Sucked right in.

1306
01:00:42,213 --> 01:00:43,305
Are you okay?

1307
01:00:43,481 --> 01:00:44,607
Yes.

1308
01:00:44,816 --> 01:00:48,252
Yeah, I just think that what you
gave me didn't really do anything.

1309
01:00:48,453 --> 01:00:51,945
I just have too much adrenalin
or something. But, thanks.

1310
01:00:52,724 --> 01:00:55,352
Why don't you take
my scotch?

1311
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,427
It will just give the pill
a little kick that it needs.

1312
01:00:58,629 --> 01:01:00,256
Honestly, I do it all the time.
Yeah?

1313
01:01:00,465 --> 01:01:02,899
Yeah, and I'm much smaller than you,
so you'll handle it.

1314
01:01:04,135 --> 01:01:05,124
Well, thanks.

1315
01:01:05,336 --> 01:01:06,735
Yeah?
Okay.

1316
01:01:16,948 --> 01:01:17,915
(EXHALES)

1317
01:01:20,284 --> 01:01:21,342
Yummy?

1318
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:22,611
Yeah, it's good.

1319
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,913
You should just toss it back.
Don't waste any more time.

1320
01:01:25,123 --> 01:01:26,147
Okay.

1321
01:01:31,028 --> 01:01:32,154
Ohh. Look at that.

1322
01:01:34,332 --> 01:01:37,597
Okay, that'll do it.
That'll do it.

1323
01:01:38,102 --> 01:01:39,763
So you don't even
have sex anymore?

1324
01:01:39,971 --> 01:01:42,269
No, I have sex constantly.

1325
01:01:42,607 --> 01:01:43,904
The sex is constant.

1326
01:01:44,108 --> 01:01:46,736
But he hasn't
kissed me in five years.

1327
01:01:46,944 --> 01:01:48,309
What are you doing when
you are having sex, then?

1328

Thinking about other things
and wishing it would stop.

1329
01:01:53,151 --> 01:01:55,085

I just want to watch

without him entering me.

1331
01:01:58,222 --> 01:02:00,588
It's the Wet Republic Ultra Pool.
No.

the pool and a tiger.

01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,714
So am I.

1561
01:12:31,855 --> 01:12:32,822
(MOANING)

1562
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:47,378
Hello.
Morning.

1563
01:12:47,587 --> 01:12:49,111
Sorry, I didn't
mean to freak you out.

1564
01:12:49,322 --> 01:12:50,516
No, it's okay.

1565
01:12:50,723 --> 01:12:52,782
I haven't been sitting here that long.
Oh.

1566
01:12:54,026 --> 01:12:54,993
(BOTH CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)

1567
01:12:57,196 --> 01:12:58,629
Sorry, I guess I fell asleep.

1568
01:12:58,864 --> 01:13:01,799
I didn't mean to sleep over.

1569
01:13:02,768 --> 01:13:03,735
Don't be silly.

1570
01:13:04,904 --> 01:13:06,371
I made you a cappuccino.

1571
01:13:06,572 --> 01:13:08,870
Made it?
Yeah.

1572
01:13:09,909 --> 01:13:11,740
So, last night was fun.

1573
01:13:12,845 --> 01:13:15,541
It was.
It was very fun.
