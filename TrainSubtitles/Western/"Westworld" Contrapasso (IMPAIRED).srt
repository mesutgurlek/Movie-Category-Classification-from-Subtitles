2
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,889
Old Bill: You got any stories, friend?

3
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,150
Yeah, I suppose I do.

4
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:05,206
You want to know the
saddest thing I ever saw?

5
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,041
When I was a boy, my
brother and I wanted a dog,

6
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,799
so our father took in an old greyhound.

7
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,675
You've never seen a
greyhound, have you, Bill?

8
00:02:18,147 --> 00:02:20,581
Seen a few showdowns in my day.

9
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:26,179
A greyhound is a racing dog.

10
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,800
Spends its life running in circles,

11
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:32,261
chasing a bit of felt
made up like a rabbit.

12
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,714
One day, we took it to the park.

13
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,907
Our dad had warned us
how fast that dog was,

14
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,910
but... we couldn't resist.

15
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,996
So, my brother took off the leash,

16
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:46,042
and in that instant,

17
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,260
the dog spotted a cat.

18
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:52,722
I imagine it must have looked
just like that piece of felt.

19
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:56,048
He ran.

20
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:01,680
Never saw a thing as beautiful

21
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:05,217
as that old dog... running.

22
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:10,670
Until, at last, he finally caught it.

23
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,045
And to the horror of everyone,

24
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:16,029
he killed that little cat.

25
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:18,144
Tore it to pieces.

26
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:22,834
Then he just sat there, confused.

27
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:27,786
That dog had spent its whole life

28
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,295
trying to catch that... thing.

29
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,375
Now it had no idea what to do.

30
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:41,854
(Whirring)

31
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,497
That is one humdinger
of a story, partner.

32
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:49,175
Shall we drink to the
lady with the white shoes?

33
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,069
(Insects chirping)

34
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,752
(bell dinging)

35
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,643
(voices whispering)

36
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:22,978
Man: Find me.

37
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:25,991
Dolores: Show me how.

38
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:31,032
Logan: There she is.

39
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:32,218
Pariah...

40
00:04:32,632 --> 00:04:34,773
City of outcasts, delinquents,

41
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:36,951
thieves, whores, and murderers.

42
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,077
Slim: Once we cross the gates,

43
00:04:39,163 --> 00:04:40,612
you will reap the full benefits

44
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:43,448
of El Lazo's gratitude
for my safe return.

45
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,209
- (Clicks tongue)
- (horse sputters)

46
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,577
Are you all right?

47
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:55,365
Of course.

48
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:58,672
Did I do something wrong?

49
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:01,608
Just earlier, I thought I
heard you talking to someone.

50
00:05:02,938 --> 00:05:04,604
Must have been the wind.

51
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,651
(Chatter)

52
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,871
Good morning.

53
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,375
This way.

54
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:32,080
(Bell tolling)

55
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,333
- (birds screeching)
- (distant dog barking)

56
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:38,053
(men arguing)

57
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,558
- (chickens clucking)
- (woman giggling)

58
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,726
(woman moaning)

59
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,373
Logan: The farther up
we get from Sweetwater,

60
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:48,287
the more... grandiose,

61
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:50,096
the bigger the narratives become.

62
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,852
It's beautiful in its own way.

63
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,988
For once, I agree.

64
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:57,667
Some of the park feels
like it was designed

65
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,850
by committee or market-tested,

66
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,953
but everything out here is more raw.

67
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:05,864
- (Gunshot)
- But it doesn't come cheap.

68
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,177
Rumor is they are hemorrhaging cash.

69
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,227
We're considering buying them out.

70
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:14,039
Supposedly, this place was
all started by a partnership.

71
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:16,185
And then right before the park opened,

72
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,010
one of the partners killed himself.

73
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:20,596
Sent the park into a freefall.

74
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,025
I mean, I don't know any of the details.

75
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,539
I don't even know his name.

76
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,964
You must have a team of
lawyers looking at this place.

77
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,687
Yeah, well, they came up empty.

78
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:31,617
He's a complete mystery.
Not even a picture.

79
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,725
William: Well, whoever
designed this place,

80
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,484
you get the feeling they don't
think very much of people.

81
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,867
Who are they?

82
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,153
They call themselves "the
Army of New Virginia."

83
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,873
Everyone else calls
them "the Confederados."

84
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,758
My father told me about them.

85
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:54,129
Ex-Confederate soldiers that
refused to surrender after the war.

86
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:56,525
Now they work as
mercenaries below the border.

87
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,399
- They are the key to this game.
- What game?

88
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:02,587
Well, the biggest game there is... war.

89
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:04,484
Supposedly, it's at the
far reaches of the park.

90
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,274
Now, I've never made it that
far, but this could be our chance.

91
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:11,490
Lawrence: I've known plenty

92
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,622
of truly fucked up
individuals in my time.

93
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:15,864
Few that would hold
a candle to you, sure.

94
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,289
This one? Theodore Flood?

95
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:20,934
He was Wyatt's friend.

96
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:25,211
Those former associations
are exactly why we need him.

97
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:28,774
He's going to lead me
straight to the big, bad wolf.

98
00:07:29,676 --> 00:07:30,809
I wouldn't count on that.

99
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,367
(Teddy groans)

100
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,258
Oh, shit.

101
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:39,186
(Lawrence grunting)

102
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:49,163
Didn't take you for the charitable type.

103
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:52,118
You should've left him
on that tree to die.

104
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,141
You believe in fate, Lawrence?

105
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,039
If the bitch exists,

106
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:00,506
I'd like to kick her
in the teeth about now.

107
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:02,024
Don't be so glib.

108
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:04,219
You'll hurt my feelings.

109
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:07,463
As another old friend
of mine likes to say,

110
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,414
"There's a path for everyone."

111
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,590
Your path leads you back to me.

112
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,492
You ever wonder why I've kept
you with me this whole journey?

113
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:17,996
Maybe you like the
pleasure of my company,

114
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:19,548
you sadistic fuck.

115
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,031
(Chuckles) Why, maybe I do.

116
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:25,814
There's not a man in the world

117
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,102
who'll take the tone with me you do.

118
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,009
In a past life, perhaps.

119
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,461
Teddy here's not looking
long for this world.

120
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:37,906
Nearest healer is in Pariah.

121
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,632
Ain't no way he's
gonna make it that far.

122
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,641
He's lost too much blood.

123
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:44,687
Boy: Are you lost?

124
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,781
Our friend here's a
little worse for the wear.

125
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:57,015
Any water nearby, son?

126
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:00,035
There's a creek on the
other side of the canyon.

127
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,323
Fetch us some, would you?

128
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,645
Now hurry.

129
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,575
Friend here needs some
if he's gonna make it.

130
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:10,573
Get!

131
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:15,700
Eh.

132
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:17,918
Too small.

133
00:09:18,611 --> 00:09:20,111
What does that mean?

134
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:22,043
What are you sending him for water for?

135
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,364
I'm the one you made fill up
the sow's bag this morning.

136
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:36,754
A shame, really.

137
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,545
I always enjoy our
time together, Lawrence.

138
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:42,614
The fuck is that supposed to mean?

139
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,384
It means... I was wrong.

140
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,636
The path that brought you
here, it wasn't for me.

141
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,849
It was for him.

142
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,512
(Gasping)

143
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,527
Sorry, Lawrence.

144
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:09,044
Guess I'll see you on the other side.

145
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,463
Sylvester: Uh-oh. It's
not looking good for you.

146
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,457
- Lutz: Closing.
- Forget it, I win.

147
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,934
I always win!

148
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:37,802
(Imitates crowd cheering)

149
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,293
Hey, not fair.

150
00:10:39,318 --> 00:10:42,479
All you had was a smashed
cheekbone and an ear.

151
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:45,143
You know how hard it is to get
the auricle curves symmetrical?

152
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,478
You had to what?

153
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,396
Plug and patch of couple bullet holes?

154
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:50,183
And a knife wound.

155
00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:53,074
It was a contained incision.

156
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:55,877
Almost like they were
looking for something.

157
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:57,834
(Shouts, gasps)

158
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:01,826
Are you fucking kidding me?

159
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,330
You really think this little
fuck puppet's coming to get you?

160
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,799
- Huh?
- It got off the table and ran.

161
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:09,646
That's 'cause you forgot
to put her in sleep mode.

162
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,003
Yeah, I really think I remembered
to put her in sleep mode.

163
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,639
You know, that's the
thing about forgetting.

164
00:11:14,664 --> 00:11:17,114
You think you remembered,
but you didn't.

165
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,060
(Beeping)

166
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:21,099
- Break time.
- Yeah!

167
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,982
I've got a ham sandwich

168
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:27,152
and a nubile redhead
loaded up in the VR tank,

169
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:30,462
- awaiting instruction.
- (chuckles)

170
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:33,334
Yes!

171
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,720
(Footsteps approach)

172
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:09,116
(object thuds)

173
00:12:09,815 --> 00:12:11,114
Welcome back.

174
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,709
Looks like a couple
of gallons of Lawrence

175
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,734
swirling around in you did you good.

176
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,233
Ready to get back on the road?

177
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,960
Merciful thing would be
to put a bullet in me.

178
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,569
Who ever said I was merciful?

179
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,616
And it's not my fault you're suffering.

180
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,416
You used to be beautiful.

181
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,569
When this place started,

182
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:35,983
I opened one of you up once.

183
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,473
A million little perfect pieces.

184
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:40,671
And then they changed you.

185
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,763
Made you this sad, real mess.

186
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,687
Flesh and bone, just like us.

187
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:51,152
They said it would improve
the park experience.

188
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,280
But you know why they really did it?

189
00:12:54,244 --> 00:12:55,687
It was cheaper.

190
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,611
Your humanity is cost-effective.

191
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:01,413
So is your suffering.

192
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:03,757
Whatever it is you
want from me, mister...

193
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,836
(chuckles) I ain't gonna be
worth a damn to you like this.

194
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,954
Well, that would be a shame, Teddy.

195
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,256
After your misadventure,

196
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:13,694
Wyatt killed a settler family,

197
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,927
made off with their daughter.

198
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:18,007
Girl I think you know.

199
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,585
Name of Dolores.

200
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,740
They have Dolores?

201
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,687
There it is.

202
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,982
The magic word.

203
00:13:40,037 --> 00:13:42,871
Hey, much obliged there, son.

204
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,013
Don't worry about him.

205
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:50,832
Someone will be along for him shortly.

206
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:57,385
(Flies buzzing)

207
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,183
(voices whispering)

208
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:16,966
- (distant screams echoing)
- Mommy!

209
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:18,194
(Gunshot)

210
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:21,318
Are you all right?

211
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,112
(Chatter, laughter)

212
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:30,496
When I ran from home,

213
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:32,738
I told myself it was the only way.

214
00:14:35,114 --> 00:14:39,354
Lately, I wondered if in every moment,

215
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,879
there aren't many paths.

216
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:44,549
Choices... hanging in
the air like ghosts.

217
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:46,941
And if you could just see them,

218
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:48,919
you could change your whole life.

219
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,544
Is that what you want? You
want to change your life?

220
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:54,818
Doesn't everybody want that?

221
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,030
Yeah, I guess they do.

222
00:14:59,116 --> 00:15:00,796
Maybe that's why they come here.

223
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,749
Whoever you were before
doesn't matter here.

224
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,716
There's no rules or restrictions.

225
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,492
You can change the story of your life.

226
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,826
You can become someone else.

227
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,752
No one will judge you,
no one in the real world

228
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:15,023
will even know.

229
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,226
The only thing holding
you back is yourself.

230
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,695
What did you mean by that?

231
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:22,921
You said no one in the
real world will know.

232
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:25,601
I thought you weren't supposed
to notice things like that.

233
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:28,901
Why wouldn't I?

234
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:32,430
You know, recently,

235
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:35,483
it seems like the whole
world is calling to me

236
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:37,667
in a way it hasn't before.

237
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:53,451
- (Distant cheering)
- (music playing)

238
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:56,454
Logan: Billy! Where the
hell you been? Come on.

239
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,541
El Lazo has agreed to have an
audience with y'all tomorrow.

240
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,043
In the meantime, there's
a brothel I recommend.

241
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,795
Logan: Ooh, they have a contortionist.

242
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,182
Oh, I don't think Dolores would
find that very interesting.

243
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,911
Who the fuck cares what Dolores wants?

244
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,279
She's a goddamn doll!

245
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:13,582
Hey, can you not say that around her?

246
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:17,475
I swear, I feel like she understands.

247
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:20,306
Of course you do.

248
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,565
(Music, cheering continue)

249
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:58,683
Woman: Our dead are never dead to
us until we have forgotten them.

250
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,937
Dr. Ford: May you rest in a
deep and dreamless slumber.

251
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:12,936
Dr. Ford: Hello, Dolores.

252
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,535
Do you know where you are?

253
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,707
- I'm in a dream.
- Yes, Dolores.

254
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:24,114
You're in my dream.

255
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:29,631
Tell me, do you know
what this dream means?

256
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:33,192
Dreams are the mind
telling stories to itself.

257
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,019
They don't mean anything.

258
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:37,942
No, dreams mean everything.

259
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,727
They're the stories we tell
ourselves of what could be,

260
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:44,169
who we could become.

261
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:49,114
Have you been dreaming again, Dolores?

262
00:17:49,848 --> 00:17:51,846
Imagining yourself breaking out

263
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,356
of your... modest little loop?

264
00:17:55,264 --> 00:17:57,059
Taking on a bigger role?

265
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:02,246
Well, I suppose I
can't begrudge you that.

266
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:06,363
My father told me

267
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,543
to be satisfied with my lot in life.

268
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,092
That the world owed me nothing.

269
00:18:16,739 --> 00:18:20,658
And so, I made my own world.

270
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:25,664
Tell me, Dolores.

271
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,445
Do you remember the man I used to be?

272
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,367
I'm sorry.

273
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:37,459
I'm forgetful sometimes.

274
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,297
Hardly your fault.

275
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,180
But I'm sure you remember him.

276
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:45,300
Arnold.

277
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,758
The person who created you.

278
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,346
I'm sorry, I don't think I
recall anyone by that name.

279
00:18:51,371 --> 00:18:52,923
And yet you can.

280
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:58,970
Somewhere under all those
updates, he is still there.

281
00:18:59,793 --> 00:19:01,821
Perfectly preserved.

282
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:05,157
Your mind is a walled garden.

283
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:10,148
Even death cannot touch
the flowers blooming there.

284
00:19:13,634 --> 00:19:15,347
Have you been hearing voices?

285
00:19:15,372 --> 00:19:17,954
Has Arnold been speaking to you again?

286
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:20,760
No.

287
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:24,591
You're...

288
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:28,163
- You're hurting me.
- Analysis.

289
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,733
When was your last contact with Arnold?

290
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:37,118
Last contact: 34 years,

291
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:40,124
42 days, seven hours ago.

292
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:42,442
Yes, Dolores.

293
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:46,285
The day Arnold died.

294
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:52,839
And you have no records of
any contact with him since?

295
00:19:54,037 --> 00:19:55,425
No.

296
00:19:56,913 --> 00:19:58,737
What was the last thing he said to you?

297
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,999
He told me I was going to help him.

298
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:03,917
Help him do what?

299
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,789
To destroy this place.

300
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,064
But you didn't, did you?

301
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:15,996
You've been content...

302
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:18,304
in your little loop.

303
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:20,095
For the most part.

304
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:22,734
I wonder...

305
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,252
if you did take on that
bigger role for yourself,

306
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:31,362
would you have been the hero...

307
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:33,003
or the villain?

308
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,908
That's enough, Dolores.

309
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:49,831
I'm sorry for bothering you,

310
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:55,370
but... there's no one
else left who was there,

311
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,066
no one who understands

312
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:00,725
as we understand.

313
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:04,808
Are we...

314
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,292
very old friends?

315
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:10,175
No.

316
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:14,050
I wouldn't say friends, Dolores.

317
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,161
I wouldn't say that at all.

318
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,522
He doesn't know.

319
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:51,679
I didn't tell him anything.

320
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,276
That's it.

321
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:02,112
Come on, little one.

322
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:05,239
- (Beeping)
- (exhales)

323
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,824
Come on.

324
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,667
(Chirping)

325
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,057
- (clattering)
- (chirping continues)

326
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:31,816
(groans)

327
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:33,017
What the fuck?

328
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,152
Grab it!

329
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,802
- (Screeches)
- Ah! God...

330
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:42,360
damn it.

331
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:43,527
Little shit.

332
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:46,364
(Grunts)

333
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:49,166
Jesus, tell me... tell
me you're not this stupid.

334
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:50,284
You stole a bird

335
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,703
and a fucking behavior tablet?

336
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,839
I wasn't stealing,

337
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:56,540
I was borrowing.

338
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:59,354
Haven't got the code right
yet, but with practice...

339
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,929
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

340
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,714
Is that your ace plan?

341
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,748
You're gonna fix up a birdie
and get yourself a promotion?

342
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:10,554
You're not a fucking ornithologist.

343
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
And you're sure as hell not a coder.

344
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:14,919
You are a butcher.

345
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,811
That is all you will ever be.

346
00:23:16,956 --> 00:23:18,539
So, unless you want to score yourself

347
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,897
a one-way ticket out of here

348
00:23:19,922 --> 00:23:23,789
for misappropriating corporate property,

349
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,404
you better destroy that fucking shit.

350
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,991
Now, come on, we got another body.

351
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,079
What?

352
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,165
It's her.

353
00:23:38,103 --> 00:23:39,235
Again.

354
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:40,751
Jesus.

355
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,167
How the hell did you get this job

356
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,221
if you're scared
shitless of these things.

357
00:23:44,307 --> 00:23:45,806
(Grunts)

358
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,592
Personality testing should've
weeded you out in the embryo.

359
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:49,735
(Bullet clatters)

360
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,323
Now, come on, let's get this
thing back in rotation.

361
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,188
William: Yesterday,
you seemed out of sorts.

362
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:03,787
You feeling better this morning?

363
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:07,225
I had troubled dreams.

364
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,697
But I feel more myself now.

365
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,832
Guys, come on.

366
00:24:11,865 --> 00:24:14,256
El Lazo awaits.

367
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:28,549
And I present you El Lazo!

368
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,272
Logan: You're a hard man to find.

369
00:24:35,452 --> 00:24:36,951
Most wanted men are.

370
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:41,195
We saved your man Slim here
from quite a predicament.

371
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,697
In recompense,

372
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,467
I'd like an introduction
to your Confederado friends.

373
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,545
It's only fair.

374
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,299
- There's no such thing as fair here.
- (mouths words) Sit down.

375
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,790
In Pariah, justice ain't just blind,

376
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:54,102
she's crooked.

377
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:56,492
Bitch's scales are always tipped.

378
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:58,329
If you don't see how,

379
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,142
well, that's 'cause
they're tipped against you.

380
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,299
Still, by way of gratitude,

381
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,218
I can supply you a night

382
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:07,221
with some very amenable women.

383
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,923
I've fucked enough whores.

384
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,893
You're gonna need to sweeten the pot.

385
00:25:12,918 --> 00:25:14,501
(Grunts)

386
00:25:16,104 --> 00:25:17,487
How about I sweeten it

387
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:20,067
by killing you quickly?

388
00:25:20,092 --> 00:25:22,926
(Voices whispering)

389
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,195
There's something you're
seeking, isn't there?

390
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,697
I know what that feels like.

391
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,558
I'm seeking something, too.

392
00:25:36,753 --> 00:25:38,355
If you let us,

393
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,581
I know we can help you.

394
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:46,377
How is it the lunatics
always find their way to me?

395
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:47,711
(Men laugh)

396
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:49,338
Then again, the Confederados

397
00:25:49,363 --> 00:25:51,897
are missing a few bullets
in their barrels, too.

398
00:25:53,472 --> 00:25:55,639
You folks just might get along.

399
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,690
A Union convoy's transporting a shipment

400
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:01,831
of nitroglycerin from the front today.

401
00:26:02,073 --> 00:26:04,612
The Confederados would like to
divest them of said shipment,

402
00:26:04,637 --> 00:26:06,958
but we are not welcome
that side of the border.

403
00:26:07,378 --> 00:26:10,484
A trio of travelers such
as yourselves, however...

404
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,788
You want us to help the
Confederados steal from the Union?

405
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:15,363
They're just gonna use that nitro

406
00:26:15,388 --> 00:26:17,301
to slaughter your
people below the border.

407
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,577
Personal grudges hold no sway

408
00:26:19,602 --> 00:26:21,352
where profit is concerned.

409
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,130
Logan: Oh, we understand.

410
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:25,487
We're businessmen, too.

411
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:27,668
El Lazo: Very well, then.

412
00:26:28,214 --> 00:26:29,470
But Blondie here,

413
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:32,590
she's gonna need a change
of clothes for the occasion.

414
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,581
- (Whistles)
- Logan: Mm.

415
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,855
My, my.

416
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,523
Look who's packing.

417
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,358
I don't aim to use this.

418
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:29,006
Those men are Union
soldiers like my father was.

419
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:30,447
I know. We won't hurt them.

420
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:31,899
We're gonna stick to the plan.

421
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,886
We'll take the nitro and go.

422
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:35,986
Hyah!

423
00:27:39,317 --> 00:27:40,526
All right.

424
00:27:42,141 --> 00:27:43,974
Showtime.

425
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,761
- (Gun hammer clicks)
- Soldier: Whoa!

426
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:03,981
(Gun hammer clicks)

427
00:28:04,336 --> 00:28:05,432
Howdy.

428
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:08,185
My associates and I are here
to relieve you of your ride.

429
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:09,687
(Soldier chuckles)

430
00:28:09,832 --> 00:28:11,382
Someone's been telling you boys tales.

431
00:28:11,407 --> 00:28:13,107
Nothing in this wagon worth taking.

432
00:28:13,313 --> 00:28:15,025
The story I heard is one bullet from us,

433
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,735
and that nothing blows
you all to kingdom come.

434
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,448
Well, then you understand
why we cannot surrender it.

435
00:28:21,645 --> 00:28:23,144
We're sworn to protect the people

436
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:26,287
of this young republic from
reckless half-wits like you.

437
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,707
Call me half-wit again.

438
00:28:29,902 --> 00:28:32,653
Please, do as he says.

439
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:33,877
We don't want to hurt you.

440
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,095
I'd listen to her.

441
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,070
He'll shoot just to see the fireworks.

442
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:38,549
Hand them over.

443
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,467
Come on.

444
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:43,335
Hey, come on down, give me
your guns, everybody lives.

445
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:45,132
Come on.

446
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,441
Come on, nice and easy.

447
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,976
Right over here.

448
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:50,712
A little further, please.

449
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:53,090
Much obliged. Thank you.

450
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:54,231
Here you go.

451
00:29:06,963 --> 00:29:08,579
(Grunting)

452
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,081
That's for lying.

453
00:29:11,106 --> 00:29:12,106
Stop!

454
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,803
(Groans)

455
00:29:15,828 --> 00:29:18,296
And that was for "half-wit."

456
00:29:18,474 --> 00:29:19,807
(groans)

457
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:24,428
And this...

458
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:26,513
- (grunts)
- (groans)

459
00:29:33,823 --> 00:29:35,155
(groans)

460
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,740
Oh!

461
00:29:36,826 --> 00:29:37,826
(Hammer clicks)

462
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:38,993
No!

463
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,283
Logan: Stop, please.

464
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:47,951
(Choking)

465
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:54,124
Stop.

466
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,846
(Grunts, panting)

467
00:30:09,827 --> 00:30:11,327
Whoo!

468
00:30:12,695 --> 00:30:14,479
That's the spirit.

469
00:30:15,197 --> 00:30:17,481
I knew you would get into this place.

470
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:18,699
Yes!

471
00:30:23,372 --> 00:30:24,783
Yep.

472
00:30:25,374 --> 00:30:27,018
Not bad for a day's work.

473
00:30:28,544 --> 00:30:30,160
Vamonos.

474
00:30:32,362 --> 00:30:34,279
We told them everyone would live.

475
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,340
Guys,

476
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:45,241
looks like Slim didn't make it.

477
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,524
(Clicking tongue) Whoa.

478
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,195
They put up a fight.

479
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:08,699
We made them pay for it, though.

480
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:13,537
Price of doing business.

481
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,205
Slim knew that.

482
00:31:18,384 --> 00:31:20,118
_

483
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:23,348
(Whistles)

484
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:33,640
Had my doubts, El Lazo.

485
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:37,563
But you came through.

486
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:40,614
(Coins jingling)

487
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,699
We're gonna blow these cactus-eaters

488
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:45,786
back to the dirt holes
they crawled from.

489
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,738
Let's get it down to the station.

490
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,303
- No time to waste.
- (men cheering)

491
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,259
If I may, Captain, your men are weary.

492
00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:53,710
It's a long road ahead.

493
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:57,057
You have secured a great
victory for your cause today.

494
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:00,834
Perhaps an evening of...
celebration's in order.

495
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:03,025
Anything you desire.

496
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,994
Logan: What do you say, Captain?

497
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,759
There's another train in the morning.

498
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:12,596
(Captain grunts)

499
00:32:12,621 --> 00:32:15,539
You will be a true asset to our ranks.

500
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:27,194
Elsie: All right, Bart,
let's try this again.

501
00:32:30,522 --> 00:32:32,973
(Sighs) God damn it, man.

502
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,339
You're still miscalibrating by
four centimeters to the right.

503
00:32:39,842 --> 00:32:41,268
You keep pouring whiskey on the guests,

504
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,938
I'm gonna have to
reassign you to a narrative

505
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,217
where your...

506
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,038
talents would go
tragically unappreciated.

507
00:32:57,237 --> 00:32:58,436
Hey!

508
00:32:58,461 --> 00:33:00,103
That's the host that tried to kill me.

509
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,173
Where are you taking that?

510
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:04,682
Livestock... and then the incinerator.

511
00:33:11,363 --> 00:33:12,779
Fuck this.

512
00:33:27,245 --> 00:33:28,830
Lutz: Fuck.

513
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:31,096
Isn't she from behavior?

514
00:33:31,121 --> 00:33:32,620
You think they found something?

515
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:34,761
All right. Be cool, dickhead.

516
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,597
- Okay.
- No one's looking at us.

517
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:39,683
Hi.

518
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,200
You're Destin, right?

519
00:33:43,976 --> 00:33:45,642
That's correct.

520
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:48,335
I almost didn't recognize
you with your pants on.

521
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,411
- Here.
- (Destin grunting on tablet)

522
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,369
- (grunting continues)
- What the fuck?

523
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,423
There's a common misconception

524
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,819
that the hosts don't
log sexual encounters

525
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,544
when they're underground
for reprocessing,

526
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:10,297
but... like I said, misconception.

527
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,683
Oh, fuck.

528
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:14,101
I need something.

529
00:34:14,126 --> 00:34:15,362
QA sent a body down here.

530
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,387
The woodcutter from Sector 14.

531
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:18,473
I want to see it.

532
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:20,355
No, I can't.

533
00:34:21,364 --> 00:34:22,647
I need this job.

534
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,191
(Chuckles)

535
00:34:25,454 --> 00:34:26,757
Look, Destin,

536
00:34:26,782 --> 00:34:28,565
in a second, I'm gonna walk out of here

537
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,090
and your friends are gonna
wonder what this was all about.

538
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:32,864
Now, your answer can either be,

539
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,439
"I'm helping behavior track a problem,"

540
00:34:35,478 --> 00:34:38,511
or "I'm a creepy necro perv."

541
00:34:39,506 --> 00:34:40,922
Up to you.

542
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,530
Five minutes,

543
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:50,815
then it's going in the incinerator.

544
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,256
Huh. You took a little
more time than that

545
00:34:53,281 --> 00:34:55,231
for your examination, didn't you?

546
00:34:58,986 --> 00:35:01,903
(Sighs) All right, big guy.

547
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:04,754
What were you doing up there?

548
00:35:16,535 --> 00:35:18,535
_

549
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:23,132
_

550
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,204
What the fuck?

551
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,381
You have been holding
out on me, Maurice.

552
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:10,751
(Beeping)

553
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,083
Oh, shit.

554
00:36:23,103 --> 00:36:24,707
We've got a big problem.

555
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,491
Turns out our big, dumb friend

556
00:36:34,516 --> 00:36:36,600
had some hidden depths.

557
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:40,030
That is a laser-based satellite up-link.

558
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,867
This was in the body of the host?

559
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,345
Mm-hmm, you were right.

560
00:36:45,448 --> 00:36:48,449
Orion's Belt has three stars, not four.

561
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,540
Our friend wasn't drawing stars,

562
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:51,875
he was drawing a target.

563
00:36:52,071 --> 00:36:53,771
Someone has been using our hosts

564
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:56,379
to smuggle data out of the park.

565
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,970
(Music playing)

566
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,615
(woman moaning)

567
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,914
(moaning)

568
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,753
(moaning)

569
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:45,217
Now, this...

570
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,430
this I could get used to.

571
00:37:51,976 --> 00:37:54,810
- You're not gonna indulge?
- (chuckles)

572
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,236
My flesh has tasted

573
00:37:58,806 --> 00:38:01,915
a greater pleasure than
any offered in here...

574
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:03,861
War.

575
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,283
It's that good, huh?

576
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,275
Another round on the house.

577
00:38:10,923 --> 00:38:12,122
There's a place in Glory

578
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,674
for a brown man who knows his rank.

579
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:23,633
Captain: You're two
able-bodied men of strong stock.

580
00:38:23,706 --> 00:38:26,446
The road to Glory
could use more warriors

581
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,638
in its fight for our divine providence.

582
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,974
That is just what we were thinking.

583
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:34,060
Come here, come here.

584
00:38:35,825 --> 00:38:38,125
I know you wanna... you
wanna play the war game,

585
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,377
but I'm not going anywhere
with these psychopaths.

586
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,046
If you don't like them,
once we get to the fun,

587
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,988
you can just kill them and
join the Revolutionaries.

588
00:38:45,013 --> 00:38:46,541
No, Logan, enough's enough.

589
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,375
I'm not doing this.

590
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,294
You actually let loose for once.

591
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:54,308
You shoot an unarmed
man, and now you feel bad

592
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,560
because you can't
call yourself the hero.

593
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:58,494
Don't you get it yet?

594
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:01,448
There is no such thing
as heroes or villains.

595
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:04,224
It's just a giant... circle jerk.

596
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,343
I think that philosophy
says way more about you

597
00:39:06,368 --> 00:39:08,235
than it does about the world.

598
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,486
(Scoffs)

599
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:15,518
And you... you see the world so clearly?

600
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:17,131
You probably think you're on this trip

601
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,499
because you're some kind of contender,

602
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,135
some... some threat to me.

603
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,863
I picked you precisely because

604
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:29,559
you will never be a threat to anyone.

605
00:39:29,918 --> 00:39:32,668
My sister probably picked
you for the same reason.

606
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:36,206
I earned my place.
Nobody handed it to me.

607
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,864
Right, a lifetime of working hard,

608
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:42,022
following the rules,
and you finally reach

609
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,520
the pinnacle of your
career trajectory...

610
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,885
Executive vice president,
upper middle management.

611
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:53,362
Do you remember the day that you finally
got those three fancy little letters?

612
00:39:53,643 --> 00:39:54,870
EVP.

613
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:58,395
You walked into my office in
that cheap black suit of yours,

614
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,623
and you shook my hand

615
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:02,614
and you thanked me for the opportunity.

616
00:40:05,393 --> 00:40:08,098
That was the best day of your life.

617
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,828
(Panting)

618
00:40:24,315 --> 00:40:25,815
Right, buddy.

619
00:40:27,952 --> 00:40:29,785
That's what I thought.

620
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,941
(Moaning)

621
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:53,366
(moaning, voices echoing)

622
00:41:28,704 --> 00:41:30,820
What does it mean?

623
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:32,155
(Gasps)

624
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,075
The maze...

625
00:41:35,475 --> 00:41:38,584
You must follow the maze.

626
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:40,941
What's wrong with me?

627
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:43,819
Perhaps you are unraveling.

628
00:42:02,611 --> 00:42:04,861
(Gasping)

629
00:42:19,452 --> 00:42:21,202
(gasps)

630
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:32,283
Man: Right here.

631
00:42:35,274 --> 00:42:38,142
El Lazo: Easy pumping
that nitro into him.

632
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:42,986
Fill the empties with
tequila and seal them up.

633
00:42:48,426 --> 00:42:49,676
Your work for the revolution

634
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:51,947
is not quite done yet, my friend.

635
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:04,443
Careful.

636
00:43:04,966 --> 00:43:07,417
Slim always had a bad temper.

637
00:43:18,146 --> 00:43:19,729
William, we have to go now.

638
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,741
Lazo's been conning us the whole time.

639
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,711
He was never gonna give the
nitro to the Confederados.

640
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:25,685
We have to run.

641
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,912
Of course we do.

642
00:43:27,653 --> 00:43:29,568
That's how this place works, right?

643
00:43:30,264 --> 00:43:31,835
They create an urgency,

644
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,194
a sense of danger so
they can strip us down

645
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:36,196
to something raw,

646
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:37,662
animalistic,

647
00:43:38,406 --> 00:43:40,122
primal.

648
00:43:40,366 --> 00:43:41,915
(Screaming)

649
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,065
It's a sick game, and I
don't want to be a part of it.

650
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:46,506
This isn't a game. They'll kill us.

651
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,178
But together,

652
00:43:49,636 --> 00:43:52,303
I know we can find a way out.

653
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:55,095
How can you be sure?

654
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,467
There's a voice

655
00:43:57,653 --> 00:43:58,962
inside me

656
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:01,771
telling me what I have to do.

657
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:04,588
And it's telling me I need you.

658
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:13,084
(Women screaming)

659
00:44:24,285 --> 00:44:25,494
Shit.

660
00:44:40,957 --> 00:44:42,290
They have Logan.

661
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,101
Help me.

662
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,269
Help me.

663
00:44:51,323 --> 00:44:52,832
- (Blow landing)
- (grunting)

664
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,023
No.

665
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,246
No more pretending.

666
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:14,916
I thought you had no
appetite for war, boy.

667
00:45:15,474 --> 00:45:19,526
This... is a declaration of war.

668
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,554
El Lazo set us up.

669
00:45:24,699 --> 00:45:26,199
We can find him for you.

670
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:30,048
You can find him for us
by joining him in hell.

671
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:33,396
Ah!

672
00:45:33,632 --> 00:45:34,748
Dolores, run!

673
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:38,368
(Voices whispering)

674
00:45:38,453 --> 00:45:41,287
(gunshots)

675
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:49,963
Dolores?

676
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:05,400
How did you do that?

677
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:08,398
You said... people come here

678
00:46:08,423 --> 00:46:10,456
to change the story of their lives.

679
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:16,346
I imagined a story where I
didn't have to be the damsel.

680
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:20,243
(Train whistle blows)

681
00:46:20,328 --> 00:46:22,222
That train is our only chance

682
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:24,163
of making it out of here alive.

683
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:28,117
(Whistle continues blowing)

684
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,373
Motherfuckers.

685
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:12,962
You pull that trigger,

686
00:47:13,048 --> 00:47:15,568
we'll all go up in a ball of hellfire.

687
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:18,334
So, why don't you
loosen your grip a mite?

688
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:27,604
It's okay.

689
00:47:28,907 --> 00:47:30,206
I don't trust him.

690
00:47:30,231 --> 00:47:32,862
Which is the first step
to truly knowing me.

691
00:47:33,925 --> 00:47:35,458
Give me your gun, El Lazo.

692
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,495
Now that we're all friends,

693
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:45,815
you can call me Lawrence.

694
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:48,247
And why don't we settle in?

695
00:47:48,272 --> 00:47:49,938
It's a long ride to the front.

696
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,661
You want a sip of this swill?

697
00:48:06,994 --> 00:48:09,828
Lawrence: Don't worry, it ain't nitro.

698
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:19,654
I'm coming.

699
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,242
(Music playing)

700
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:37,079
- (door opens)
- (bell jingles)

701
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:42,445
Girls are a little worn
out, but I can rouse one.

702
00:48:42,805 --> 00:48:46,103
- You boys want some company?
- No, just whiskey.

703
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,312
(Groans)

704
00:48:53,337 --> 00:48:56,601
Lawrence's donation must be running low.

705
00:48:57,523 --> 00:48:59,602
But we're short on time.

706
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:01,604
You need to buck up, Teddy.

707
00:49:04,993 --> 00:49:07,172
Man in Black: I told you no company.

708
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,614
Thought I might join you anyway,

709
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,834
as I never like to drink alone.

710
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,297
Well...

711
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,164
isn't this a rare honor?

712
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:21,822
Teddy...

713
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:23,703
you know who this is?

714
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:27,547
I can't say that I do.

715
00:49:27,572 --> 00:49:30,706
Everything good that has
ever happened in your life

716
00:49:30,731 --> 00:49:32,422
and everything rotten,

717
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:34,957
this is the man you have to thank.

718
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:40,301
How I'm doing, Robert?

719
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,529
Any closer to finding
what I'm looking for?

720
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:46,004
And what is that, exactly?

721
00:49:47,202 --> 00:49:48,848
Teddy: Looking for a man named Wyatt.

722
00:49:49,371 --> 00:49:51,605
Killed a rancher back in Sweetwater.

723
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,629
Took his daughter.

724
00:49:55,394 --> 00:49:57,895
That last part doesn't sound familiar.

725
00:49:58,014 --> 00:49:59,563
(Chuckles) Figured your stories

726
00:49:59,682 --> 00:50:01,481
could use a little embellishment.

727
00:50:02,045 --> 00:50:03,578
You know, I always felt this place

728
00:50:03,603 --> 00:50:05,746
was missing... a real villain.

729
00:50:06,405 --> 00:50:09,406
Hence my humble contribution.

730
00:50:09,431 --> 00:50:10,931
(Chuckles)

731
00:50:10,956 --> 00:50:13,304
I admit, I lack the imagination

732
00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:15,668
to even conceive of someone like you.

733
00:50:16,499 --> 00:50:19,488
The urgency, however, doesn't
quite fit the character.

734
00:50:20,286 --> 00:50:23,287
It betrays a certain anxiety.

735
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:28,397
Now, Wyatt, on the other hand,

736
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:30,365
that's something new.

737
00:50:30,823 --> 00:50:34,242
Is he just another stooge for the
tourists to mount on their wall at home,

738
00:50:34,267 --> 00:50:37,123
or have you finally
made a worthy adversary?

739
00:50:38,688 --> 00:50:39,770
Someone to stop me

740
00:50:39,795 --> 00:50:43,272
from... finding the center of the maze?

741
00:50:45,207 --> 00:50:47,824
And what is it you're
hoping to find there?

742
00:50:50,822 --> 00:50:52,920
You know why you exist, Teddy?

743
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,795
The world out there,

744
00:50:56,405 --> 00:50:58,739
the one you'll never see,

745
00:50:58,824 --> 00:51:00,491
was one of plenty.

746
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:03,936
A fat, soft teat people
cling to their entire life.

747
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:08,749
Every need taken care
of... except one...

748
00:51:10,169 --> 00:51:11,811
Purpose,

749
00:51:12,421 --> 00:51:14,505
meaning.

750
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:16,140
So they come here.

751
00:51:16,259 --> 00:51:18,782
They can be a little
scared, a little thrilled,

752
00:51:19,095 --> 00:51:21,405
enjoy some sweetly affirmative bullshit,

753
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:23,097
and then they take a fucking picture

754
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:24,939
and they go back home.

755
00:51:25,685 --> 00:51:29,153
But I think there's a deeper meaning

756
00:51:29,272 --> 00:51:30,954
hiding under all that.

757
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:35,517
Something the person who
created it wanted to express.

758
00:51:39,282 --> 00:51:40,931
Something true.

759
00:51:42,952 --> 00:51:45,035
Well, if you're looking
for the moral of the story,

760
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:47,121
you could simply ask.

761
00:51:47,256 --> 00:51:50,007
(Chuckles) I'd need a shovel.

762
00:51:50,126 --> 00:51:52,868
The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago.

763
00:51:53,266 --> 00:51:55,266
Almost took this place with him.

764
00:51:55,548 --> 00:51:58,098
Almost, but not quite,

765
00:51:58,123 --> 00:51:59,656
thanks to me.

766
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:02,509
Or maybe he left something behind.

767
00:52:05,808 --> 00:52:08,642
I wonder what I would find...

768
00:52:08,778 --> 00:52:10,394
if I open you up.

769
00:52:18,571 --> 00:52:20,330
Even at death's door,

770
00:52:21,242 --> 00:52:23,002
you're still a loyal pet.

771
00:52:30,082 --> 00:52:32,465
Is that why you came here, Robert?

772
00:52:32,969 --> 00:52:34,762
Try to talk me out of it?

773
00:52:35,504 --> 00:52:36,879
On the contrary.

774
00:52:37,433 --> 00:52:39,483
Far be it from me to get in the way

775
00:52:39,508 --> 00:52:42,574
of a voyage of self-discovery.

776
00:52:53,773 --> 00:52:56,500
Mr. Flood, we must look back

777
00:52:56,937 --> 00:52:59,827
and smile at perils past,

778
00:52:59,852 --> 00:53:01,218
mustn't we?

779
00:53:02,865 --> 00:53:05,699
- (Snaps fingers)
- (piano playing)

780
00:53:10,006 --> 00:53:11,372
(clicking)

781
00:53:13,876 --> 00:53:15,793
We should get back on the road.

782
00:53:15,878 --> 00:53:17,211
Time's wasting.

783
00:53:49,245 --> 00:53:50,911
(Sighs)

784
00:54:15,821 --> 00:54:17,771
(exhales)

785
00:54:24,029 --> 00:54:25,779
(object clanks)

786
00:54:33,038 --> 00:54:35,122
(beeping)

787
00:54:36,175 --> 00:54:38,675
(chirping)

788
00:54:43,099 --> 00:54:44,681
(chirping continues)

789
00:55:09,959 --> 00:55:12,326
Maeve: Hello, Felix.

790
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,831
It's time you and I had a chat.

791
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:30,609
