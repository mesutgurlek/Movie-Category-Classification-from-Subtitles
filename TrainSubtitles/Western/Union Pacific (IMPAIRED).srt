1
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,351
(man #1) Building a railroad that
long is somebody's crazy dream.

2
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,155
(man #2) It's a
wonderful age we live in.

3
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,958
[laughing] A railroad
from Omaha to California?

4
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,895
One might as well think of flying.

5
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,524
President Lincoln is for it.

6
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,297
(Smith) This is the
most monumental folly...

7
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,032
ever conceived in the mind of man.

8
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,834
In all this broad land of ours...

9
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,478
who wants this railroad...

10
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,812
that will start at the
outer edge of civilization...

11
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,908
and wander expensively
through the wilderness?

12
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,912
Who, I ask you, except a small group...

13
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,789
of money-grabbing financiers,
self-seeking politicians...

14
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,993
and fanatical engineers?

15
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,528
[senators chattering]

16
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,360
[gavel tapping] Mr.
President. Mr. President.

17
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,299
(President) Does the Senator yield
to the gentleman from California?

18
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,337
I am not done, Mr. President.

19
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,605
I would like to read...

20
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,767
from a speech by the late
Daniel Webster on this subject.

21
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,575
Delivered from this very floor.

22
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,943
"What do we want with this
vast, worthless area...

23
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,346
"this region of savages
and wild beasts...

24
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,520
"of deserts and endless mountain ranges?

25
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:16,353
"What can we ever hope
to do with 3000 miles...

26
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,727
"of cheerless rockbound coast...

27
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,425
"and not a harbor on it?"

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,489
[senators chattering]

29
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,557
Not a harbor on it?

30
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,034
[gavel pounding]
(President) Order! Order!

31
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,469
[snickering] Why, there's room
in the San Francisco Bay...

32
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,200
to float all the navies of the world.

33
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,366
[senators laughing]

34
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,002
His word against Webster's.

35
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,441
[all cheering]
Mr. President. Mr. President.

36
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,008
(President) Mr. Sargent.

37
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,610
Gentlemen. The learned Senator asks...

38
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,479
Who wants this railroad?

39
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,079
Well, I'll tell you.

40
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,724
This nation, crippled by
four years of war, wants it.

41
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:49,921
[senators chattering]

42
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,486
A great artery...

43
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,331
through which may flow the
gold and silver of the West...

44
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,593
into the empty treasuries of the East.

45
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:01,268
(Sargent) Grain and cattle
into a war-torn South.

46
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,275
And thousands of men
released from both armies...

47
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,409
want it for the work and
the wages it will bring.

48
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,511
And the merchants of the whole world...

49
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,913
who need a shorter route
to the Orient, they want it.

50
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,454
[senators exclaiming]

51
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,047
[gavel pounding]

52
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,514
Gentlemen...

53
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,427
I move you the adoption
of this railroad bill...

54
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:29,231
that shall bind us
together, East and West...

55
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,333
forever as one people.

56
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,463
[senators cheering]

57
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,631
[gavel pounding]

58
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,376
(Lincoln) Mr. Ames...

59
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,909
I want to take a ride
on this railroad...

60
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,915
the first thing after I
retire from the presidency.

61
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,285
(Ames) Mr. Lincoln had the
vision to conceive this railroad.

62
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,092
You gentlemen must have the
vision to help us finance it.

63
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,396
(Barrows) Frankly, Mr. Ames,
the only vision I can see...

64
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,297
is a lot of loose dollars
rolling away over those prairies.

65
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,425
Good day, gentlemen.

66
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,094
(Ames) But there's more than profit...

67
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,070
in the lap of this undertaking.

68
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,835
This railroad is the
future of the United States.

69
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,843
Along its rails, new cities will rise.

70
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,003
Is there not some danger
that the Central Pacific...

71
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,949
which is building east across
California, may reach Ogden first...

72
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,111
and keep you out of
the Salt Lake Valley?

73
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,348
President Lincoln wisely arranged...

74
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,790
that the Central Pacific will build
only to the California state line.

75
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,223
Here, where our tracks
will join with theirs.

76
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,021
General Dodge, uh...

77
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,097
as Chief Engineer of
the Union Pacific...

78
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:40,734
are you quite sure that a railroad
more than 1000 miles long...

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,570
can actually be built
through such a wilderness?

80
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,476
Yes. Yes. My brother Oliver and I...

81
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,014
are staking our fortune
on General Dodge's word...

82
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,413
that it can be done.

83
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,610
How much of your fortune, Mr. Ames?

84
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,988
We'll back the Union Pacific down
to the last shovel in our factory.

85
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,590
You're enthusiastic.

86
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,751
I promised Mr. Lincoln
to see it through.

87
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,660
Mr. Lincoln is dead. Well,
my promise to him is not dead.

88
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,823
Splendid, Mr. Ames, splendid.

89
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:09,493
I'm beginning to see a golden
harvest in these iron rails.

90
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,599
Then you are with us?

91
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,203
My hand on it.

92
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,599
(Ames) Thank you.

93
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,073
Thank you, Mr. Barrows.

94
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,441
On the contrary, I am indebted to
you for showing me the fortune...

95
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,448
there is to be made out of Union
Pacific. Good day, gentlemen.

96
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,538
(all) Good day, sir.

97
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,709
(Barrows) Good luck, General Dodge.

98
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,810
Good luck. (Dodge) Goodbye, all.

99
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,821
Goodbye, sir.

100
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,287
Who is Barrows?

101
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,882
The biggest moneybag in Chicago.

102
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,723
He makes them and breaks them out there.

103
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,160
I never thought he'd join you.

104
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,222
What do you think would happen
if the Central Pacific...

105
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:43,530
should build all the way to
Ogden in the Salt Lake Valley?

106
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,731
It would bust the Union
Pacific higher than a kite.

107
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,535
Much higher.

108
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,569
But he said that Lincoln had
arranged for the Central to stop...

109
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,408
at the California
border. Lincoln is dead...

110
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,877
and there are those in Washington who
do not wish the Union Pacific well.

111
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:03,212
Can't both lines have
terminals in Ogden? No, Whipple.

112
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,985
You miss the point.

113
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,522
The Union Pacific has
authority to build only...

114
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,495
to where it meets the Central. Well?

115
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,466
And if the Central should
pass through Ogden first...

116
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,299
and meet the Union in the wilds
of the Wasatch Mountains...

117
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,536
Yes. Exactly.

118
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,374
The Union would have
1000 miles of track...

119
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,915
and a gopher hole for
its Western terminal.

120
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,774
Splendid.

121
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,615
We'll sell Union stock
short and buy Central.

122
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:38,248
We'll make millions, Mr.
Barrows. A golden opportunity.

123
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,521
Pure gold. Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

124
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:47,564
But suppose the Union
Pacific gets to Ogden first?

125
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,930
It won't, Whipple.

126
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,859
I can assure you.

127
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,365
It won't.

128
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,072
(Rose) # They call me
the rose of St. Louis #

129
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,613
# The rose of this river town #

130
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,380
##[Rose humming]

131
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,826
Gentleman to see you, boss.

132
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,587
Mr. Barrows.

133
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,198
Bring in a bottle of
that extra-dry champagne.

134
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,529
Yes sir, extra dry.

135
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:23,791
Take a seat.

136
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,168
Oh. Rose...

137
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,598
# They call me the Rose of St. Louis ##

138
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,903
Sit down.

139
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,874
We ain't had the pleasure of
seeing you here before, Mr...

140
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,846
[chuckles]

141
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,741
Interesting decorations.

142
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,986
Only one like it in St. Louis.

143
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,614
I suppose you brought the
idea with you from Panama.

144
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:45,880
Panama?

145
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:50,788
This biography of yourself, written by
the best detective agency in Chicago.

146
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,028
What's on your mind, mister?

147
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,928
How's that partner of
mine doing? Very good, sir.

148
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,239
Mr. Campeau...

149
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,709
in the past, your operations
have always been, shall we say...

150
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,143
of a minor nature.

151
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,105
Do you think you could manage the
biggest gambling outfit in America?

152
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,879
Do you think you could
handle 10,000 workmen...

153
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,318
with plenty of money...

154
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,151
out in the wilderness?

155
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,657
Supplying them with liquor...

156
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,259
and any excitement the devil can brew?

157
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:29,091
Do you think you could keep them drunk
and discontented, month after month?

158
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,700
Go on.

159
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,238
Excuse me, Mr. Allen.

160
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,175
Mr. Campeau would admire to
see you in the other room.

161
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,839
Excuse me, gentlemen. Al. Al Brett...

162
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,577
take over.

163
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,810
It's your deal.

164
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:52,685
It means keeping your tent with its many
diversions at the end of the track...

165
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,248
as it moves West...

166
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:58,821
and selling the tracklayers all the
trouble they'll buy. You'll be protected.

167
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,629
What's the split? None. You take it all.

168
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,234
Including orders from me.

169
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,005
What kind of orders?

170
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,373
They will all add up the same. Delay.

171
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,045
Anything... I might say everything...

172
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,173
to delay the building of
the Union Pacific Railroad.

173
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,711
Why not?

174
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,914
Longer it takes, the more money I make.

175
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,186
Mr. Barrows, this is
my partner, Dick Allen.

176
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,994
Late of the Union Army...

177
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,696
but never late with a gun.

178
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,430
He'll be very handy, I assure you.

179
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,692
I've been making a deal with
your partner. A big deal.

180
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,035
We're leaving St. Louis.

181
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,802
For where and for
what? West, Mr. Allen...

182
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,906
for excitement and profit.

183
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,042
[chuckling] All right. Deal me in.

184
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,669
Where's my drink?

185
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,742
Here. I don't use it.

186
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,106
No?

187
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,713
Never take another man's drink.

188
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,085
It's bad luck.

189
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,314
Well, gentlemen...

190
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,289
here's to...

191
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:03,919
[laughing]

192
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,361
whatever it is.

193
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,896
[all laugh]

194
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,790
'Tis that cottonwood you're feeding him.

195
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,259
He won't eat it.

196
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,296
It gives him a pain in his boiler.

197
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,632
[train whistle blowing]

198
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,166
Hey, Monahan.

199
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:22,200
Do you want I should spell you a
bit, Monahan. In case you fall asleep?

200
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,835
Mollie Monahan, will you come down
out of that before some Indian...

201
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,106
beats me to the pleasure of killing you.

202
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,545
I brought you supper.

203
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,717
Suppose you fell off, and
I had to stop the train.

204
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,185
If you were half the dutiful daughter...

205
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,687
that this engine is to me...

206
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,986
Hold your whist. Here's your bite.

207
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,795
Heavens above. What's
in it? Coupling pins?

208
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,491
Cartridges. I forgot to
put them in your valise.

209
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,564
Get back to the caboose, you brat.

210
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,205
Twenty hours to Cheyenne...

211
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,967
and I'm supposed to
live on powder and lead.

212
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,773
I think you've been eating dynamite.

213
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,209
(Mollie) Good night, Mr. Barley.

214
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,405
(Barley) Good night, Mollie.

215

[Fiesta muttering]

217
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,411
Down.

218
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,055
I want it up. No. Down.

219
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,884
I said up.

220
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,757
Now listen, lady...

221
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,296
I want some fresh air.

222
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,628
Sure, and you'll get it,
right through your skull.

223
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,827
The Indians relish shooting
at the lighted windows.

224
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,496
[Fiesta chuckling]

225
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,904
That woman, she's just
like my wife I had in Omaha.

226
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,309
You know my wife, she's so mean...

227
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:36,037
she barks like the dogs, but me, well...

228
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,742
you know what I do? You married her.

229
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,581
Oh, sure. You bet yourself.

230
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,219
<i>She can cook frijoles. Mmm.</i>

231
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,619
The best in the whole world.

232
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:47,858
(Fiesta) Mollie.

233
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,530
(Fiesta) But I look around and...

234
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,299
pretty soon I marry my wife in Santa Fe.

235
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,571
The best woodchopper in the country.

236
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,338
You bet you my life, the best.

237
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,871
But one day she gets
bite by a rattlesnake.

238
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,041
She did? Yeah.

239
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:14,085
Did the doctor get there in
time? No, she's already dead.

240
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,882
Your wife? My wife?

241
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,413
No, no, the snake. My wife...

242
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,756
My wife, the next day, she's
so angry, she bites her brother.

243
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,219
Sure...

244
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,333
and his whole family is poisoned.

245
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,327
[snorting]

246
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,104
(Fiesta) And, anyhow, I'm
already gone to Yuma...

247
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,767
and there I marry Carmelita.

248
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,779
(Mollie) Now what did you marry her for?

249
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,876
You think to cook for me?

250
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,316
No. To chop me firewood? No.

251
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:49,984
Well, what did she do?

252
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,420
She...

253
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,622
[both laughing]

254
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:57,059
Yes, sir. Carmelita sure is a honey.

255
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,761
Yeah.

256
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,265
Hey, what you know?

257
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,200
(Fiesta) Leach, what you do here anyhow?

258
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,296
Hunting for you.

259
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,801
General Dodge wants to
see us back in his car.

260
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:14,004
At the rate you're going, Leach,
General Dodge won't live that long.

261
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,276
New troubleshooter is getting
aboard, somewheres hereabout.

262
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,026
Thanks, Sergeant. Good luck.

263
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,599
General Dodge aboard, Conductor?

264
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,936
Yep. If you're Jeff Butler,
he's looking for you.

265
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,134
I'll report, soon as I wash
off some of the prairie.

266
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,110
Yeah. A fella gets
kind of sweaty riding.

267
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,782
Campeau's crowd's in this car, Mollie.

No self-respecting rattlesnake

Sure, Dick, they told me
you'd not be back this year.

00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,939
Did you think you'd
get rid of me that easy?

We'll bury him when the time comes.

284

Every minute that passed
had your name on it.

Oh, that's easy to listen
to, but hard to believe.

he doesn't like gamblers.

Here you are practicing to fleece
the poor lambs at the End of Track.

Marry me, Mollie, and I'll reform.

00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,439
You haven't changed a bit.

Except maybe for the worse.

You're in love with her
and her three sisters.

You've got cards in your blood.

And you in my heart.

295
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,349
Go along with your soft talk.
You'll die with your boots on...

00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,544
and your four ladies won't
be walking behind you.

00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,522
Would you walk behind me?

298

Would be safer than walking
beside you to the altar.

Close your eyes. Both of them.

Turn your head away.

This is to keep your heart
warm for your wedding day.

Not that Monahan's a poor engineer.
He's the best there is, but...

I suppose a good engineer's
daughter can get...

313
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,222
just as cold as a poor
engineer's daughter.

314

And a gambler can love you
just as much as a saint.

We might as well face the facts.

Central Pacific has not stopped at
the California state line as agreed.

They're over the Sierras,
and they've surveyed...

right through to Salt Lake and Ogden.

What do you think? But
they've got an agreement!

The devil himself is against us!

happens to the people...

323
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,207
who backed us with their savings?

324
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,646
Busted. And so are we.

325
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,544
We're going to reach Ogden first.

326
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,110
Well, the Central will be there in 10
months. Then we'll be there in nine.

327
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,418
Look at the map, General Dodge.

328
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,526
We've built only 516
miles in three years.

329
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,958
And we're still 500 miles from Ogden.

330
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,991
And we're still going
to get there first. What?

331
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,434
Over the Rockies and Wasatch Mountains
with Indians claiming your food supply?

332
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:00,861
[scoffing]

333
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:05,073
Only the Irish could do
it. And I doubt if they can.

334
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,078
Good news or bad? Good.

335
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,837
We had a council at Broken Bow.

336
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,041
Red Cloud says the Indians'll
lay off the railroad...

337
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,346
if the whites will lay off the Indians.

338
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,649
Captain Butler served with me in
the war. He's just signed on with us.

339
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,587
Meet the two gentlemen
you'll be working for.

340
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,852
General Casement, in charge
of tracklaying. How are you?

341
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,416
How do you do, sir? Mr. Reed.

342
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,126
You tell him what your job is, Sam.

343
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,688
I see that the tracklayers don't
catch up with the graders...

344
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,757
the graders don't catch
up with the tie cutters...

345
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,531
the tie cutters don't catch up with
the tunnel and bridge builders...

346
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,367
and the lunatic asylum
doesn't catch up with me.

347
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,100
[all laughing]

348
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,769
My job, sir?

349
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,506
To establish and maintain order
along the entire right-of-way.

350
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,637
Troubleshooter, huh?

351
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,808
Yeah, and there's plenty of it.

352
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,975
(Reed) What's the worst problem?

353
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,213
Sid Campeau.

354
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,382
His whiskey and cards and what goes
with them follow the End of Track...

355
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,893
like a flock of vultures.
They've cost us a life every day.

356
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,225
Men drugged, robbed, murdered.

357
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,565
Crews disrupted by hired agitators.

358
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,567
Leach Overmile and Fiesta
here have been assigned to you.

359
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,160
They can tell you how Campeau operates.

360
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,772
I don't believe I'll need bodyguards.

361
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,639
Oh, no? You'll need them, all right.

362
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,108
You think we no good, eh?

363
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,884
No. It's not that, I...

364
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,012
We've had a lot of experience, Captain.

365
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,057
We bodyguarded the last
two troubleshooters...

366
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,059
right up till the very
minute they was killed.

367
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,355
[chuckles]

368
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,227
We'll get along all right.

369
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,162
[train whistle blowing]

370
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,366
(Butler) There's just one
question I'd like to ask, General.

371
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,837
Yes? What's the limit?

372
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,998
None.

373
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,838
Because our town's on wheels,
we've no civil law out here.

374
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:49,844
You're the law. And it's up to you to
smash anything that threatens to delay us.

375
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,213
That's all the orders
there are. Yes, sir.

376
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,453
I declare, he seems like
a right nice young fella.

377
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,016
I hope he lives long enough
so as we can get acquainted.

378
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,098
[whistle blowing]

379
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,974
[horse whinnying]

380
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,398
[train whistle blowing]

381
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,230
Hey, what's moving? You are.

382
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,671
Oh, am I, now? Yep.

383
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:57,138
Lady, you're on a brake wheel,
and one whistle means turn it.

384
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,807
Are you running this
train all by yourself?

385
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,446
No, but passengers aren't allowed on
the platform while the train's moving.

386
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,114
Passengers. Me?

387
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,824
[exclaiming]

388
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,225
You poor tenderfoot.

389
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,555
[door slamming]

390
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,622
[creaking]

391
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,461
The new troubleshooter's
looking for you, Mr. Campeau.

392
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,527
For what?

393
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,039
I don't know. Heading this way, though.

394
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,775
Keep an eye on him.

395
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:26,869
Al.

396
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,642
Al Brett, Cordray.

397
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:34,344
Rose, you and Mame better get
to the other end of the car.

398
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,478
A lady can't get no rest.

399
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,853
A lady don't need none.

400
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,753
Sit down and keep your eyes open.

401
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,018
(Campeau) Dick.

402
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,523
Sit down, Mollie, and keep low.

403
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,829
Why? What's going on?

404
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,160
Campeau's expecting company.

405
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,406
[train whistle blowing]

406
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,020
That's him.

407
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:17,790
Wait here.

408
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,295
Lonesome, handsome?

409
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,869
[woman giggling]

410
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,546
Jeff Butler. Dick.

411
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,815
You old dogcatcher.
You old chicken thief.

412
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,389
[both laughing]

413
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,915
(Dick) Remember the last time
I saw you in Philadelphia...

414
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,585
Baltimore... Oh, now wait.

415
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,795
We started celebrating our discharge
from the Army in New York...

416
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,456
and we came up for air in Philadelphia.

417
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,865
I put you to bed in Baltimore,
and I woke up in Washington.

418
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,562
Old army pals, huh?

419
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,105
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be alive.

420
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,697
Jeff, this is Sid Campeau.

421
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,969
(Butler) I've heard of Mr. Campeau.

422
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,511
This is Mr. Brett and Mr.
Cordray. Captain Butler.

423
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,568
Howdy. Hello.

424
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:09,636
Howdy.

425
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,744
[laughing] You old sharpshooter.
What are you doing here?

426
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,149
I'm working for the railroad.

427
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,312
Doing what? I'm assistant
superintendent of the...

428
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,050
Just a fancy name for troubleshooter?

429
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:20,747
Maybe.

430
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,128
It looks like we'd see
quite a lot of each other...

431
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,294
for a while.

432
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,759
I was figuring on having
a little talk with you.

433
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,395
Maybe you'd better have a little
talk with your friend here first.

434
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,401
Tell your playmates they
can sit easy for a while.

435
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,568
[laughing] Same old Jeff.

436
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,847
This is my seat, and this is
Miss Mollie Monahan. Jeff Butler.

437
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,416
Sit down, Jeff.

438
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,647
Jeff and I fought, bled and died
together, all during the war.

439
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,122
It wasn't you two that
won the war, was it?

440
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,783
[chuckling] Practically.

441
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,889
How much of a friend of
yours is Campeau? Sid?

442
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,191
He's my partner.

443
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,994
You'd better get yourself
another partner, Dick.

444
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,056
[chuckles]

445
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,964
I've already got my eye on one.

446
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:06,993
Oh.

447
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,564
Is it another slap you're
asking for, Mr. Butler?

448
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,200
Darling, will you kindly
hold your temper...

449
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,212
your tongue, and your two
little fists. They ain't little.

450
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,077
(Dick) You can't fight Mollie and live.

451
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,172
[laughs]

452
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,047
She's the postmistress at End of Track.

453
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:23,743
The eyes and tongue of 1000 men
who never learned to read or write.

454
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,790
She belongs to the railroad.

455
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,826
Although you'd think the
railroad belonged to her.

456
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,754
What about Campeau?

457
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,324
What about him?

458
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:35,958
Part of my job is to clear him
and his outfit off the line.

459
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,900
No, you can't do it, Jeff.

460
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:40,865
Don't try.

461
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,597
We've been through a lot
of storms together, Dick.

462
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:47,270
We've slept under the same
blanket, eaten off the same plate.

463
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,142
Join up with me again.

464
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,307
I'm standing pat and liking it.

465
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:56,952
Well, I'm afraid we're in
different armies this time.

466
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,648
You think there'll be a
rope around my neck someday?

467
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:01,985
Maybe.

468
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,518
[chuckles]

469
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:07,463
Sure now, that's a crazy way for
two friends to be saying hello.

470
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,856
[all laughing]

471
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,733
(woman) Hey, what's that? Hey, look.

472
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,802
The Injun boy, he race the iron horse.

473
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,501
[all laughing]

474
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,807
Monahan will bust his boiler
if the Injun keeps up with him.

475
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,675
[Fiesta laughing]

476
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,311
(man #1) Come on, Indian boy.

477
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,782
(man #2) Open up, Monahan.

478
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:28,474
(Bessie) Say, he's cute.

479
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:29,542
(woman #1) Now, Bessie.

480

This train doesn't stop.

All right.

That shot didn't just kill an Indian.

It killed a dozen white men, and
scalped and tortured women and children.

The Army's been killing them for years.

The Army doesn't kill

I've all but $20 of the passage money.

You can't win at Campeau's.

Now, the shamrock's not

00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,861
pulling out in five minutes.

643
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,525
(man) Come on, Terry.
Not me. I'm staying.

644
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,589
Me, too.

645
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,364
Train for End of Track!

646
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,234
[people chattering]

647
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,302
(man) Let's go. I gotta go.

648
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,603
(woman) Come on back
for a while. Come on.

649
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:22,635
Come on, you gandy dancers.
Get out there and go to work.

650
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,574
(conductor) Board!

651
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,916
Free drinks, boys and girls.
Everybody have a drink on the house.

652
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,148
Free drinks!

653
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,690
[all cheering]

654
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,663
Board for End of Track.

655
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,995
There's not many men boarding
your work train, Jeff.

656
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,062
They'll be on it.

657
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,803
Are you going to clean out
the tent all by yourself?

658
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,935
Maybe.

659
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,141
I never thought one glass of
liquor would do that to you, Jeff.

660
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,944
But when the shooting
starts, let me know.

661
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,450
I'll be right over
there, dealing blackjack.

662
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,114
[laughs]

663
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,919
By doggies, I knowed
I'd miss all the fun.

664
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,590
Where's that good luck piece of yours?

665
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,461
Oh, you mean that gold nugget
I picked up out in California?

666
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,228
I got it here somewhere.

667
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,101
I always keep it with my knickknacks.

668
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,737
There it is, right there
in number five, Jeff.

669
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,910
Say, let me tell you how
I happened to pick that up.

670
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,471
How do you know that's real gold?

671
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,312
What do you know about gold nuggets?

672
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,248
Are you doubting that that's gold?

673
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,213
I wonder if there's any old-timer here
that knows real gold when he sees it.

674
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,280
I do.

675
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,050
Take a look at that.

676
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,533
That's gold, all right.
Where'd it come from?

677
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,865
Leach here picked it up at End of Track.

678
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,168
End of Track? A little
mite west of there.

679
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:57,899
Gold.

680
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,574
At End of Track?

681
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,105
Gold? Who found gold?

682
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,202
Who said "gold"? Gold?

683
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,269
What about gold?

684
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,678
(all) Gold!

685
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:05,909
(man #1) Who said "gold"?

686
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,382
They struck gold at End of Track!

687
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,043
He's found gold! (man
#2) What was that, gold?

688
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,886
Train for End of Track. Board!

689
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:15,683
[all shouting]

690
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,801
They found gold at End of Track.

691
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,394
Come back, you fools!
There's no gold! Come back!

692
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,035
[people shouting]

693
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,210
Get them on that train
and keep them there.

694
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,186
I sure will. All right, Jeff.

695
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,654
[train whistle blows]

696
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,158
(man) Come on, Charlie. It's starting!

697
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,301
[train whistle blowing]

698
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:14,146
The shooting's all over,
Dick. Where were you?

699
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,981
[both chuckling]

700
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,648
That puts you one up on me, bucko.

701
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,781
[train chugging]

702
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,761
Bucko's got a nice broad back.

703
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:34,827
Ain't he?

704
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,161
Hmm.

705
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,474
The way to get him ain't
with a gun. He's too fast.

706
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,582
Get me Duke Ring.

707
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,452
(Dick) # How I missed
her, how I missed her #

708
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,087
# How I missed my Clementine #

709
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,957
# Here I kissed her little sister #

710
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,693
# Then I forgot... ##

711
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,729
I'm looking for the lovely
postmistress of Hell on Wheels.

712
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,533
And what do you want to see her about?

713
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,574
About one of her little fingers.

714
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,342
The one she put in your eye
the first time you met her?

715
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,844
No. Not that one.

716
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,174
[both laugh]

717
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,976
Here, let me see them all.

718
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,112
That's too bad. What's
the matter with them?

719
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,346
No rings.

720
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,552
They'll catch cold. Rings!

721
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:28,956
Rings don't grow on trees.
Oh, no, not on trees.

722
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:33,463
<i>But there's a certain weed scientifically
known as the Ringus Weddingbellikus.</i>

723
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,925
Well, upon my soul.

724
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:47,966
[laughing]

725
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:52,776
'Tis some more of your black
magic, but gorry it's beautiful.

Grown especially for this finger.

727
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:58,619
No. You'd be pulling a wedding
bell out from under the next rail.

728
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,660
Well, keep it till your
finger changes its mind.

729
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,530
'Tis too much of a...

730
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,038
'Tis too much of a temptation, but...

731
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,944
the offer deserves thanking.

732
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,120
Wait. And what will the bold
Captain over there be thinking?

733
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,622
Hey!

734
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,999
(Mollie) Hey, hold on
there! Good morning.

735
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:52,003
Please, and who gave you
the right to use my handcar?

736
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,408
Oh, I thought it belonged
to the railroad. Hello, Dick.

737
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,912
It's mine to deliver
mail at the End of Track.

738
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,812
You going to End of Track? I am.

739
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,009
[train approaching] So am I!

740
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,382
[train whistle blowing]

741
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,088
That puts you two up on me, bucko.

742
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,868
Is it that you can't talk when
there's no gun in your hand?

743
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:22,494
Maybe.

744
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,336
'Tis a fine job you've done
in a few months, Mr. Jeff.

745
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,277
Restoring a bit of order
along the right-of-way.

746
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:33,373
It must give great pride
to your lady back in...

747
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,954
in Boston.

748
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:41,689
Is she your wife?

749
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,015
No.

750
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,184
[sighing]

751
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:49,626
Be like it's some sparrow's
got hold of your heart.

752
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,266
Is she very beautiful? Very.

753
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,304
And does she love you
very much? Very much.

754
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,400
Now how about delivering your mail?

755
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:04,012
The wind just whisked it out of me hand.

756
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,978
Well, seems a word from her is
more important than your business.

757
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,246
Yes. She's my mother.

758
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,586
Oh, 'tis sorry I am, Mr.
Jeff, and ashamed, besides.

759
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,995
[buffalo snorting]

760
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:33,806
Get back! Get back! Get back to the car!

761
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,678
[snorting]

762
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:42,678
Gorry, what are we getting
into? Come on, Jeff, run for it!

763
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,422
At least, now, you'll have plenty
of time to read your letter.

764
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,159
Yeah. If one of the
buffalo doesn't want a ride.

765
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:08,167
Your mother worries a great
deal about you, I'm thinking.

766
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,214
With all the fighting and
killing you're mixed up in.

767
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:13,413
I didn't know when I started.

768
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,109
What didn't you know?

769
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,779
No, you wouldn't be interested.

770
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:24,785
Captain, I've reached the point of being
fair crazy trying to understand you.

771
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,657
Mind if I smoke? That's what I mean.

772
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:31,758
The manners of a gentleman, the smile
of a boy, and the quick hand of a gunman.

773
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:36,636
Now. Now, however did you get started
on a career of death and destruction?

774
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:41,440
I couldn't decide between being a pirate
and a fireman, so took up engineering.

775
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,877
Driving an engine?

776
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,004
[grunts]

777
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,446
Get out of there!

778
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:47,974
No, building bridges and things.

779
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,612
But along came the war...

780
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:54,282
And they needed your guns
more than your bridges.

781
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,155
My dreams went up in smoke.

782
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:00,156
Then there's much in
common between us, Mr. Jeff.

783
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,832
How's that, Mollie?

784
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,732
Both of us seem to be wanting
things that don't want us.

785
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:12,141
You seemed to be getting what you
wanted just before we got on this car.

786
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,604
Oh, Dick.

787
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:22,952
I know. You think I'm an
outrageous flirt. Well?

788
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,955
But did you never know that
flirting gets into a woman's blood...

789
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,752
like fighting gets into a man's?

790
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:32,228
Now, a girl begins coquetting
to discover if she has the power.

791
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,798
Then she goes looking, like
a fighter after a bully...

792
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,858
for the hardest man to conquer.

793
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,264
But 'tis never the man she wants...

794
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,568
'tis the pleasure of
bringing him to her feet.

795
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:49,410
Till the right man comes along and
gives her the spanking she deserves.

796
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,539
That's the man she dreams of.

797
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,544
And the man she kisses.

798
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:02,556
The buffalo are most gone, and I'm
thinking we'd better be going, too.

799
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:06,357
We might have harnessed a couple
and had them pull us to End of Track.

800
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:26,212
[whistle tooting]

801
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,608
[bell ringing]

802
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,188
[men chattering]

803
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:00,238
(man) Rail!

804
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,751
[all chattering]

805
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:25,430
Rail!

806
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,613
Bend your backs to it!

807
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:44,417
(Dusky) Lay ahold of
that rail, me lad...

808
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:45,620
you're slowing us down.

809
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:49,291
Sure, if I was your mother, I'd be
ashamed of the strength you have.

810
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,061
'Tis the whiskey you
drank in Cheyenne...

811
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,466
not the work you're doing here
that gave you such a thirst.

812
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,698
Get along with you! Any trouble, Dusky?

813
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:56,761
Trouble?

814
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,241
Say, what was the matter with them crazy
muckers you sent out here the other day?

815
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,334
Why?

816
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,209
All over the hillside they
started digging for gold.

817
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:05,908
Found plenty iron, huh?

818
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:09,747
And they're laying three miles
of it a day, pay or no pay.

819
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,648
Hey, what is this I hear about
the railroad brass hats coming up?

820
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,249
Inspection tour. General
Grant's with them.

821
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,788
He'd win a lot of votes
in the next election...

822
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,557
by bringing our pay along with him.

823
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:21,620
He will.

824
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,226
Come on. Move it ahead.

825
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:25,824
[bell ringing]

826
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:29,696
Here's one to mail,
Mollie. Give it here.

827
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:32,105
Mollie, did my cousin from
Cork write? No, she didn't.

828
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:33,802
Any mail, Mollie? It is sorry, I am.

829
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:35,708
(woman) Have you got a letter
for us? No. Mrs. Cassidy.

830
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:36,939
(woman) Saint's alive! Who's dead?

831
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,505
Mrs. Hogan, I hear your
new baby came yesterday.

832
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,711
And a fine broth of a boy he
is, too. Shouldn't you be in bed?

833
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:45,277
Well, I had a mind to
stay in bed this morning...

834
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,051
but there was the washing to
do, so I says to meself, I says:

835
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:51,094
"Now, this is no time for playing sick."

836
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:52,560
What're you going to name the baby?

837
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:56,656
Union Pacific Hogan. Was
that your husband's idea?

838
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,399
Mike? Sure he's after going
to Cheyenne to celebrate.

839
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,303
The lad'll be half-grown
by the time he sobers up.

840
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:04,362
[laughs]

841
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,908
[bell clanging]

842
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,278
Injuns! Get the kids in!

843
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,441
[women clamoring]

844
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,818
Redskins!

845
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,548
(man) To your posts,
men! Get ready for action!

846
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:21,790
Hold your fire till they get closer.

847
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,921
[all chattering]

848
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:33,664
There's only two of them.

849
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,362
And they look like my men.

850
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,379
I smell worse trouble than Injuns.

851
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:46,939
Get back to work, you mollycoddles...

852
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:50,350
or I'll be banging on somebody's
pants with me pick-handle.

853
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,181
(man) Get back to the job, you terriers!

854
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,263
(Fiesta) We got plenty
troubles this time, Captain.

855
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:08,065
You know that Andy Calahan, the
foreman over at the grader's camp?

856
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,072
Yeah. What about him?

857
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,970
Nothing, only he's dead.

858
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:13,967
How?

859
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:16,672
Fella named Duke Ring
sort of lost his temper.

860
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,443
Yeah. Now, nobody's working at all.

861
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,108
But they gotta work.

862
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,419
We can't lay track if there's no grade.

863
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:26,547
Couple of hundred of them over
there yowling about no pay...

864
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,090
so we didn't start nothing.

865
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:32,254
I'll go on up and entertain Mr.
Ring. Back by sundown, maybe.

866
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:36,026
You better take us with you,
Jefferson. That foreman is awful dead.

867
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,129
Dusky! Dusky Clayton!

868
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:43,934
Would you give me the loan of this
team to take mail to the graders' camp?

869
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:47,443
That's no place for you
to be going now. Thanks.

870
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,405
Sorry, Mollie. Hey, what's this?

871
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,879
[bell ringing]

872
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,042
Well, by the soles of me feet!

873
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,725
What're you working for?

874
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:14,635
It ain't money because
you don't get none.

875
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,962
Are you working for your sweat?

876
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:19,605
That's all you'll get out of it.

877
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:23,407
Unless some Injun comes along
and tears the hair off your head.

878
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,448
Whoa.

879
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:33,887
[hammering]

880
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:37,954
Give me that.

881
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:43,764
That's Duke Ring.

882
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,763
You ain't gonna need this.

883
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,766
Oakes Ames would hate to see
his shovels used like that.

884
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:55,803
Wait here.

885
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:59,777
'Tis suicide you're contemplating,
going against that mob.

886
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,078
Maybe. Jeff.

887
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,983
No one's ever put any
sense into a man's brain...

888
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,182
through a bullet hole in his head.

889
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:10,082
Maybe you're right.

890
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,394
Whatever happens...

891
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,363
you keep out of it.

892
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,337
The fool ain't got a gun on him.

893
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,008
Hello, boys!

894
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,474
Where's your foreman?

895
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:42,214
Your foreman was a fine fellow.

896
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,629
This bruiser taking his place?

897
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,732
What're you going to do about it, bucko?

898
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:53,892
Nothing, Mr. Ring...

899
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:58,301
if these men are fools enough to
believe a lying windbag like you.

900
00:52:58,542 --> 00:52:59,873
Lying, am I?

901
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:03,275
Have you been paid for
two months or ain't you?

902
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,574
(all) No.

903
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:08,778
Sure, sure. You've all got
wages coming. So have I.

904
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,480
We'll get every cent that's due us.

905
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,819
The railroad won't pay
you for sitting around...

906
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,017
watching Mr. Ring break shovels.

907
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,217
Now, let's go to work.

908
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,728
That sounds like horse sense.

909
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:22,859
Oh, does it?

910
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:33,538
I'll kill the first man
to move a shovel of earth.

911
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:40,449
You'll go out of here feet first, bucko.

912
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:43,952
[grunting]

913
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,613
[all laughing]

914
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,267
I'm not there. I'm over here, Mr. Ring.

915
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,839
I see you, you stinking railroad cop.

916
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,105
Still here, Mr. Ring.

917
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,080
This way, Mr. Ring.

918
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,206
Well, mates, there's your bully.

919
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:42,043
Nobody can make you work.

920
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,773
But if you're through with the job...

921
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,645
get out of camp and make room
for men who do want to work.

922
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:50,042
Well, boys, it's 1:00.
That's still horse sense.

923
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,849
What are we waiting for? Come on, boys.

924
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:54,650
Come on, boys, bring your shovels.

925
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,689
(all) # I've been
working on the railroad #

# All the livelong day #

# I've been working on the railroad #

# Just to pass the time
away # Hit the ties, Ring.

930
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,931
And don't stop to say
goodbye to Campeau.

931
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:10,698
# Don't you hear the whistle blowing? #

932
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:13,809
# Rise up so early in the morn #

# Don't you hear the foreman shouting #

934

# Oh, Dinah, blow your horn #

935
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,511
Gorry, what a man.

936
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,552
# I've been working on the railroad #

937

# All the livelong ##

938
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,988
Can you see him?

939
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:32,358
Last time I seen him, I was shooting
at him from a huckleberry patch.

940
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,484
[laughing]

941
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,494
Plenty big talk, but no payroll.

942
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:39,194
(Ames) Such a move means
disaster, General Grant.

943
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:42,162
Our credit is stretched
to the breaking point.

944
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:47,073
An element, lawless beyond all
reason, hangs onto our coattails...

945
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,872
here at the End of Track.

946
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:53,004
It's like a monstrous conspiracy
determined to wreck the railroad.

947
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:56,541
And now Mr. Barrows proposes
a new survey west of Laramie.

948
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:00,578
Reputable engineers advise me
our present route is impractical.

949
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:03,490
I'd rather take the
advice of one old buffalo.

950
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,028
A buffalo? Oh, come now, General.

951
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:09,592
This railroad is being built
on an old buffalo trail.

952
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,191
Those animals are practical
travelers, Mr. Barrows.

953
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,964
And I never knew one that changed
his route for financial reasons.

954
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,836
And we can't do it and reach
Ogden before the Central.

955
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:22,134
My only concern, General Grant, is
to lay an honest stretch of track.

956
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,874
(Dodge) Mr. Barrows wants
90 miles of additional track.

957
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:28,179
If that is ordered, then I
must resign as Chief Engineer.

958
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,013
But, General Dodge...

959
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:35,353
The Government expects the company
to finish the railroad as contracted.

960
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,917
It also expects General
Dodge to remain in authority.

961
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,319
Mr. Ames.

962
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:46,159
How much money do you need
for immediate bills and wages?

963
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:48,667
At least a million dollars.

964
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,799
You seem to have the interest of the
road so deeply at heart, Mr. Barrows...

965
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:56,138
I suggest you lend Mr. Ames the money.

966
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,443
A million dollars? Yes.

967
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,942
For the Union Pacific.

968
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,281
I consider it a privilege
to serve the road...

969
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:10,292
and the next President
of the United States.

970
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:14,922
The first shipment of cash will
be sent before the week is over.

971
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,327
General. Gentlemen.

972
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,130
Thank you, General. Thank you.

973
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:22,193
(all) Thank you, General.

974
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,934
It takes money to put iron
over those mountains, General.

975
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,772
[people chattering]

976
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:33,910
(barker) Come on in, boys. An
equal cache for one and all.

977
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:36,451
Can I trouble you for a light, stranger?

978
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:40,044
Sure.

979
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:47,291
Shipment of money is coming
in on a special, Tuesday night.

980
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:52,559
Payroll, huh? Yes. I prefer
that it should not arrive.

981
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,264
How much?

982
00:57:56,339 --> 00:58:00,639
$200,000. My money. I
want most of it back.

983
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:03,573
We'll get it.

984
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,644
Thank you for the light, stranger.

985
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,213
[barker chattering]

986
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:15,089
(Campeau) The money belongs to Barrows.

987
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:18,490
So it ain't a real holdup.

988
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,259
Does Jeff Butler know that?

989
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,029
What if he don't?

990
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,530
Is there any reason why you wouldn't
plug that yellow-livered skunk?

991
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:32,373
Jeff and I aren't partners in this game.

992
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:35,242
I'd plug him...

993
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:37,874
as quick as he'd plug me.

994
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,940
But don't go calling him names.

995
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:46,478
You ought to call him a couple.

996
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:50,586
He's certainly got the whole
town giving you the horselaugh.

997
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:53,289
Yeah, he's...

998
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,024
two up on me right now.

999
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:57,898
Mollie seems to think so.

1000
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,902
Are you looking for
something between the eyes?

1001
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:03,705
[chuckling]

1002
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,637
After I lift that payroll...

1003
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:15,245
nobody's gonna laugh.

1004
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,254
Nobody but me.

1005
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,183
[train rumbling]

1006
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,562
So long, Art. Hello,
Jeff. Where are you from?

1007
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:32,491
Laramie. What's there?

1008
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,434
Nothing. Tomorrow it'll be a city.

1009
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:37,735
They're packing up Cheyenne
now and loading it on the cars.

1010
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:40,401
Will you have a cup of tea while
I'm patching Monahan's pants?

1011
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:44,344
No, thanks. But I'll sit on your
front porch till the special gets in.

1012
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,143
Special? Who's on it?

1013
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:49,548
Old John Dough. Jeff,
it's never the payroll?

1014
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,985
I could do a jig for joy.

1015
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,614
[train approaching]

1016
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:57,182
I've sat on quieter front porches.

1017
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,989
And you've spooned on them
with better company, no doubt.

1018
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,433
Not better company.

1019
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:08,899
I'll dust the blarney
off that and be thankful.

1020
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:11,805
There's no blarney
between you and me, Mollie.

1021
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:16,676
I often wonder if I'll ever have
any other front porch than this.

1022
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,044
Someday you'll have your
house anchored under you.

1023
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,343
I don't know.

1024
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:25,684
I've never lived without wheels under
me head when I lay me down to sleep.

1025
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:30,023
You'll be darning socks for
some happy man before long.

1026
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:34,194
I hope his heart won't
be far from the rails.

1027
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:39,368
And where do you think you'll
spend your declining years?

1028
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,800
I probably won't have
any declining years.

1029
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:44,965
Don't say such a thing.

1030
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:48,477
You change the night to fear
and the wind from warm to cold.

1031
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,341
Feel my hand, 'tis ice.

1032
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:56,608
In my job, Mollie...

1033
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,645
a man can't look very far ahead.

1034
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:03,851
Maybe when the road's done, I...

1035
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,424
What do you mean, the wind's cold?

1036
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,492
There isn't any wind.

1037
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:17,365
'Tis no ordinary wind. 'Tis
the kind that witches ride on.

1038
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,907
It blows trouble.

1039
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:26,142
If you'll are making any promises
dealing with the future...

1040
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,807
you're taking a lot for granted.

1041
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:28,908
What's up?

1042
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:32,352
Well, sir, it might be a sewing
bee, and it might be a hayride...

1043
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:36,916
but there's eight of Sid Campeau's top
gunfighters missing from the Big Tent.

1044
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:40,190
Is Dick with them? I reckon
he is. He ain't there.

1045
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:42,764
Hey, Jeff! Yeah.

1046
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:45,924
Eight horses, they're
gone from Campeau's corral.

1047
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:48,903
Could you pick up their trail? The
Mexican boy said they ride east.

1048
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:51,769
Maybe the Injuns is
giving an ice-cream social.

1049
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:54,401

1051

Tell Calvin to stop the
pay train at Pine Bluff.

1052
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:00,916
Leach, get an engine and
a flatcar. I sure will.

1053
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:03,008
Put our horses on the flatcar
and round up a few men.

1054
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:06,021
You bet yourself. We
have good time tonight.

over here. Take the key, Mollie.

Try Egbert Siding. Oh, no.
It is closed after 6:00.

Try anyway and keep trying.

Why do you throw mail
through the window?

some tea? Sure, sure. But...

No, some gandy dancer feeling his
liquor was throwing a bottle at the moon.

1113
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,399
What'd you do with it?

1114
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:58,067
Do with what? The bottle.

1115
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:02,543
Sure, now, I think
you're both a bit cracked.

1116
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:07,844
Much of a crowd at the
Big Tent tonight, Dick?

1117
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,647
I don't know. I was
out at the End of Track.

1118
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:14,553
The dirt at the End of
Track is white gypsum.

1119
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:18,550
You've got the same dust
on your boots I have.

1120
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:22,256
It's red. Like a rose, huh?

1121
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:25,596
More like the ground where
the pay train was held up.

1122
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:28,660
Now, don't tell me they
got away with the payroll.

1123
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:31,799
You should have asked that
fellow that rode by here.

1124
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:35,776
Well, say, that's mighty
serious for the railroad.

1125
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,744
Where were you, Jeff?

1126
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:44,518
Now drink your tea, and
you'll both be feeling easier.

1127
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:49,251
How much did they get? A mail sack full.

1128
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:50,758
A mail sack?

1129
01:08:56,699 --> 01:09:00,465
Will you drink your tea and stop
staring like there was bullets in it.

1130
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:04,662
Well, out here, Mollie, you never can
tell where you're gonna find a bullet.

1131
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:07,834
That's right. A man
can't even trust a friend.

1132
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:19,781
Hello.

1133
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,387
There's no letters for you, I'm
not boiling tea for the house...

1134
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,020
and we don't want to
make up a male quartet.

1135
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:30,759
Captain Butler's a little
upset over a pay train holdup.

1136
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:34,394
Too bad, bucko. Somebody
put one over on you?

1137
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:38,700
Maybe.

1138
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:44,406
You've had your refreshment, Jeff,
and now you'll want to be traveling...

1139
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,141
after the robbers.

1140
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:48,450
Sounds like good advice.

1141
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,414
Maybe.

1142
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,521
Lost something? No.

1143
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:04,692
I just thought I might find the
bottle that broke that window.

1144
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,633
You know, there's a
fellow named Pullman...

1145
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:14,335
that just invented a new kind
of bunk that folds up like this.

1146
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,825
(Dick) Curiosity
killed a cat once, Jeff.

1147
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:42,000
You'd better say good night.

1148
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:47,500
Why? You leaving? No.

1149
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:52,608
But you are. This is Mollie's
place, and she told you to get out.

1150
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:58,511
Hold your yelps, all of you.

1151
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:05,820
Never in me whole life have I
seen two such outrageous fortunes.

1152
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:08,925
Sit down, Jeff, and look
what's in store for you.

1153
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,228
The little leaves, all
crooked and helter-skelter.

1154
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,997
Now, they tell you of life
and love and hope and grieving.

1155
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,904
Will the tea leaves tell me
everything that's in this car, Mollie?

1156
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:20,964
No.

1157
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:22,499
(Mollie) No, they...

1158
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,008
They're warning you to get moving...

1159
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,844
or you'll be taking the long
journey on a one-way ticket.

1160
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:31,581
What do you see in mine?

1161
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:34,751
(Dick) A girl with Irish eyes?

1162
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,453
About your size?

1163
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:44,796
No, I see two horns and a pointed tail.

1164
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,830
I feel that cold witches' wind, Mollie.

1165
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,795
How about some wood on the fire?

1166
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,440
Don't let your hand slip, bucko.

1167
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:57,937
That's your second mistake, Dick.

1168
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:03,007
What was the first? Sending for help.

1169
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:06,047
What are you waiting for,
Dick? Let him have it.

1170
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:07,787
Dick, wait.

1171
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:08,845
Will you...

1172
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:12,193
Will you look at this now?
This circle in your cup here.

1173
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:16,395
Does it look like a noose? No.

1174
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:19,063
It looks like a ring.

1175
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:24,905
A wedding ring? Well,
now, maybe it does...

1176
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:28,170
but let's not be talking about
it until after Jeff is gone.

1177
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:32,944
Does it look like this one, that was made
for the third finger of your left hand?

1178
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:36,411
Why...

1179
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:49,193
If this prying troubleshooter
ever gets out of me house...

1180
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,357
I'll tell you, it's... It's yes.

1181
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:53,460
Mollie.

1182
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,766
Dick's been with me all evening
waiting to plight me his troth.

1183
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,497
Dick's been with you? Yes.

1184
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,739
Now, will you please go home?

1185
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:09,515
Or are you waiting to
see it sealed with a kiss?

1186
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:11,518
[laughing]

1187
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,617
Did you hear that, bucko? Yes.

1188
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:18,224
I heard it.

1189
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:32,232
I'll be on me oath there's
no money here but $6.70...

1190
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:35,037
in the cash drawer, and I'm
keeping Monahan's savings...

1191
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,737
sewn up in the mattress.

1192
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:40,343
Will you swear to that by
the little cross you wear?

1193
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,781
Yes, I...

1194
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:45,316
I must have lost it.

1195
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:49,921
But I swear by what's
dear on this earth...

1196
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:54,928
and by all the love that's in me...

1197
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:57,592
and...

1198
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:03,595
Please go, Jeff, there's
nothing in this car you want.

1199
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,770
I guess that's right.

1200
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:15,511
[Mollie sobbing]

1201
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:18,018
Mollie, my darling, you were glorious.

1202
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,956
Me heart's still
jigging on me back teeth.

1203
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,220
Where'd you hide it? Me heart?

1204
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:31,992
No, I know where that
is. I mean the pay sack.

1205
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,037
The pay sack?

1206
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,896
Now what would I be
doing with a pay sack?

1207
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,306
Quit the blarney and turn it
over while you're still able.

1208
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:44,072
Threaten a Monahan, would you? If
I knew, I wouldn't be telling you!

1209
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,670
[chuckling] Don't hurt him, Mollie.

1210
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:49,074
All right now, clear
out, the both of you.

1211
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,812
Tell Campeau I'll be there pronto.

1212
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,854
Maybe I'd better stay
and help you with it.

1213
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:54,980
I carried it quite a
way without your help.

1214
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:56,849
Out.

1215
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:06,122
[sniffling]

1216
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:07,224
[sighing]

1217
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,431
First it's me heart,
and now it's me knees.

1218
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,373
Where does Monahan keep his
Rule G? On top of the shelf.

1219
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:21,382
How long will it take you to pack?

1220
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:25,181
Why did you do it, Dick?

1221
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,883
We've a lifetime together
to talk about that.

1222
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:34,853
Suppose we find out first...

1223
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,498
if they've got lakes in
Ireland the color of your eyes?

1224
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:40,329
Take off your sweet lip
and say what you're meaning.

1225
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:42,870
Or if you'd rather stay in America...

1226
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:46,772
there's New York, St.
Louis, San Francisco.

1227
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:49,811
And there's General Casement's
car across the tracks.

1228
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:55,411
What do you mean? Back it
goes. Every penny of it.

1229
01:15:56,218 --> 01:16:00,211
I'll not be helping you rob the railroad
that's been mother and son to me.

1230
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:02,854
You're crazy, Mollie.

1231
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:06,219
Do you know what there is in that sack?

1232
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:10,223
Champagne and carriages
and pretty dresses...

1233
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:13,166
and a good time for
the rest of our lives.

1234
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:15,893
There's nearly $200,000 in cash.

1235
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:18,601
Use your wits, man.

1236
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:21,768
Do you think you could
travel one mile with it now?

1237
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:24,846
Jeff Butler suspicions you. The
whole railroad will be after you.

1238
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:28,041
The only chance of saving your
neck is to return it yourself.

1239
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:32,381
Me? You.

1240
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:36,584
Or you'll be dancing with your feet off
the ground, and that's not a pretty sight.

1241
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:42,223
Not for a bride on her wedding day.

1242
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:46,930
I love you, Mollie.

1243
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,398
I believe you do.

1244
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:55,905
But there'll be no talk of a
wedding till you've done as I say.

1245
01:16:57,846 --> 01:17:00,815
It's the first time I've ever
discarded aces for a queen.

1246
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:10,858
Where's the money? You're sitting on it.

1247
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:20,558
Nobody knew the money was on that
train but you, Casement, and myself.

1248
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:22,068
And Campeau.

1249
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,829
How did he find out? I don't know.

1250
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:30,607
Campeau's partner is a close
friend of yours, isn't he?

1251
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,541
He was.

1252
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:35,075
I want that payroll, Butler.

1253
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,185
(Reed) Or I want your resignation.

1254
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,977
Good evening, gentlemen.

1255
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:44,854
'Tis sorry I am to be interrupting
you, General, but this belongs to you.

1256
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:46,154
To me? What is it? The payroll.

1257
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:47,252
The payroll? The payroll? What?

1258
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:48,990
Where'd you get it?
'Twas like this, I was...

1259
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:51,624
Wait. How did you know it was
the payroll? By the bullet holes.

1260
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,190
I wasn't shooting as badly as I thought.

1261
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:54,257
Sure, that explains it.

1262
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,134
The poor bandit running for shelter,
dropping the bag from weakness...

1263
01:17:57,205 --> 01:18:00,732
with your bullets in his back. The
bullets didn't go through the bag.

1264
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:04,940
Where did you find it? Well, Mr.
Allen and I were taking a walk...

1265
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:07,345
there's such a beautiful moon
tonight... Never mind the moon.

1266
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:09,179
How long have you
been with Miss Monahan?

1267
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:10,513
Not long enough.

1268
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,577
Watch your talk, Allen. We intend
to hang the man who did this job.

1269
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:16,613
No fooling.

1270
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,057
Mollie, how did you come by this?

1271
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:19,491
Well, now, I'll not remember a thing...

1272
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:22,394
if you all keep charging at
me like a bull at red flannels.

1273
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:23,658
Go on.

1274
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:27,668
Well, we were taking some tea
over to Grandpa O'Shaughnessy...

1275
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:29,465
Grandpa O'Shaughnessy
has drunk nothing...

1276
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,733
but straight whiskey
since the war of 1812.

1277
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,299
Well, except when he's got
the misery in his back...

1278
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:37,038
and then he puts one part of
tea to seven parts of whiskey.

1279
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:40,411
Miss Monahan, are you telling
the truth? Well, not quite.

1280
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:45,117
As a matter of fact, we were on our way to
Father Ryan's to talk about getting married.

1281
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:46,711
(Casement) Getting married? You two?

1282
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:48,483
Yeah, show him your ring, Mollie.

1283
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:52,589
I'm waiting to hear
where you found the money.

1284
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:54,787
On the tracks near Mollie's car.

1285
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:58,593
How near? As near as
you might throw a stone.

1286
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,761
Or a bottle? Well, anyway,
we brought it right here...

1287
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:03,168
didn't we? Yes.

1288
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:06,105
Before we even talked to
Father Ryan about our wedding...

1289
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:08,232
in the morning.

1290
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:13,539
Yes. Mollie, it's a medal
you deserve for this...

1291
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:14,877
as well as congratulations.

1292
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:17,783
I agree with General Casement, but
the wedding will have to be tonight.

1293
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:20,014
But there's no great
hurry. Sure, there is.

1294
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,112
We're moving up to Laramie...

1295
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:23,487
and Father Ryan's church will
be on a flatcar in two hours.

1296
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:27,494
You gonna be best man, bucko?
(Reed) Captain Butler has work to do.

1297
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,866
I want the man who
robbed that train, Butler.

1298
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:34,799
Yes, sir.

1299
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:39,435
I hope you deserve her, Dick.

1300
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:43,804
We're all very grateful
to you, Miss Monahan.

1301
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:45,278
Now, Mollie, what can we do for you?

1302
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:46,439
(Reed) I'll tell you
what we can do for her.

1303
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:48,779
We'll give her a wedding tonight
that'll go down in history.

1304
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:51,250
I wouldn't want to be
putting you to that trouble.

1305
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:52,479
We could wait until...
(Casement) Trouble?

1306
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:53,612
I'll drive you to the church myself.

1307
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:54,814
(Reed) That's little enough.

1308
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:56,187
Why, she saved our bacon.

1309
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:58,283
Mollie, you've saved the railroad.

1310
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,922

[people chattering]

1312
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:05,262
(man #1) The church goes
on the next train, George.

1313
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:07,331
(man #2) Hey, lend us your hammer.

1314

(man #1) The board house comes now.

1315
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:10,197
(foreman) All right,
Donovan. Come on, O'Toole.

1316
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:11,762
Don't take all week.

1317
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,735
(man #1) McGukkin's a
sound sleeper, ain't he?

1318
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,506
Hot or cold, he goes.

1319
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:25,178
Murder alive! If you wanted to come in,
why in blazes didn't you knock at the door?

1320
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:28,154
Leave hold of it, Mike.
Everything goes to Laramie.

1321
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:31,885
And where is Laramie? It's
wherever we set down this town.

01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,086
[bell clanging]

1323
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:36,255
All right, boys, come on, we'll
take the block. The roof comes next.

1324
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:38,094
All right, Sullivan.

1325
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:40,091
Come on, take the block.

taking them tracklayers?

1330

going, they mean business.

# But the only thing
that satisfies her #

1342
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:19,072
Jake, give him a free drink. Okay.

1343

Hello, Campeau.

1348
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:35,953
I hear you're moving to Laramie.

1349
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,025
What about it?

1350
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:43,254
Go on over in the corner and turn
your back and keep your hands up.

1351
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:47,301
Come on back. You've got visitors.

yelp and you'll get the ax!

Get over here!

1356
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,678
(Dusky) That's what
claps me ax through skull.

1357
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:07,888
(man #1) Don't you reach for your gun.

1358
01:22:09,157 --> 01:22:11,352
(man #2) Who do you
think you're shoving?

1359
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:16,324
Get those Irish
clodhoppers out of my place.

1360
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:18,889
They just came down to help you move.

1361
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:24,129
Fiesta, take Mr. Campeau in there.

It's the first time I've heard about it.

1371
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:05,175
Who held up that train, Campeau?

1372
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:11,979
How should I know?

1373
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:15,045
What'd he say, Fiesta?

1374
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:18,559
He say, pretty soon he
will tell you all about it.

[Fiesta chuckling]

Pretty soon.

1377
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:33,740
There were eight horses missing
from your corral. Where'd they go?

1378
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:37,541
I don't know. Somebody
must have borrowed them.

1379
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:43,173
Did you hear that, Fiesta?
Sure. You bet yourself.

1380
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:50,717
Sure, I hear.

1381
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:54,228
He say he think he knows
who take those horse.

1382
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,699
Who rode those horses? I don't know.

1383
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:10,440
I ain't left the tent tonight.

1384
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:16,140
Look here, Butler.

1385
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:19,644
You and your railroad
cutthroat can't bully me.

1386
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:22,849
He called you a cutthroat, Fiesta.

[laughing]

1388
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,490
He knows me pretty well.

1389
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:37,536
Who led those men?

1390
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:40,172
Butler, you're nailing
the lid on your own coffin.

1391
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:44,200
Dick nailed the lid on yours
tonight. I ain't seen Dick.

1392
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:49,375
Then you didn't know he turned
the money back to the railroad.

1393
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:52,583
I don't know what you're talking about.

1394
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:54,884
He sold you out to
the railroad, Campeau.

1395
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:57,220
That's what you get for
picking a man in love.

1396
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,721
You're lying. He turned the
payroll over to Casement.

1397
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:05,357
I saw Dick give that girl a ring,
and she promised to marry him.

1398
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:09,765
Looks like you're the
sucker this time, Campeau.

1399
01:25:11,072 --> 01:25:12,596
Now you talk.

1400
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:21,347
All right, all right. What's
it to me? I wasn't there.

1401
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:25,644
Sure. Dick stuck up the train.

1402
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,548
What am I supposed to
do about it? Nothing.

1403
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:33,182
Just come with me. You, too.

1404
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:36,487
[yelping]

1405
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:37,929
I'm going.

1406
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:41,566
I declare, it won't seem natural
in Laramie without you boys.

[coughing]

1408
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:45,566
Don't reach for your
handkerchief, Brett.

1409
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,302
Just use your sleeve if
you want to wipe your mouth.

[crowd laughing]

1411

Leach, the mule's ready? Yeah.

1412
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:57,608
You and Fiesta take all the dealers
outside and get them started.

1413
01:25:58,419 --> 01:25:59,750
[Fiesta laughing] Yeah.

1414
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,755
And here. Don't forget this rat.

1415
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:06,091
Sure, we have big fun with him.

1416

[Fiesta laughing]

1417
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:11,698
For every crack of that
half-breed's whip...

1418
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:14,132
I'll put a bullet through
that pig's hide of yours.

1419
01:26:14,202 --> 01:26:15,226
[crowd chattering]

1420
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:17,203
(man) Come out from
under the table, you.

1421
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:20,868
Dusky Clayton, it's all yours.

1422
01:26:20,942 --> 01:26:22,068
(man) Take your hands off me.

1423
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:25,738
Spit on your hands, you
terriers, and smash into it.

1424
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:26,802
Yeah! Yeah!

1425

I hope Dick don't get you, Butler.

[continue banging]

1429
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:40,554
I don't want nobody to get you but me.

1430
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:48,293
There's a train east
tonight, Campeau. Be on it.

1431
01:26:50,171 --> 01:26:52,867
You're seen out here again,
you'll be shot on sight.

1432
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:54,306
Now, dust!

1433
01:26:57,178 --> 01:26:59,669
Come on, Jeff, get into the shindy.

1434
01:26:59,747 --> 01:27:01,772
Haven't time. I'm going to a wedding.

1435
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:11,552
(Leach) All right, boys, put them back.

1436
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,357
(man) Cut it out!

1437
01:27:13,428 --> 01:27:17,023
Now you boys has got your options
of getting out in 30 seconds...

1438
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:18,998
or being buried in 30 minutes.

1439
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,694
Why, I can't ride this way.

1440
01:27:20,768 --> 01:27:24,568
It's a mite on handy, but the Indians
can't sneak up on you from behind.

1441
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,798
[laughing]

1442
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:30,773
Hey, you can't do this to us.

1443
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:33,042
Well, come on, mule.

1444

[gun firing]

1447
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:46,018
Hang the mule. I'm leaving.

1448
01:27:59,874 --> 01:28:02,172
And I plight unto thee my troth.

1449
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:04,704
(Dick) And I plight unto thee my troth.

1450
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:09,212
(Father Ryan) Allow me to wish
you every happiness, Mrs. Allen.

1451
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,342
Thank you, Father.

1452
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:12,215
Congratulations. Thank you, sir.

##[organ playing]

1454
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:31,971
Dick. Why, hello, Jeff.

1455
01:28:33,107 --> 01:28:36,565
Come to kiss the bride?
No, Dick. I've come for you.

1456
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:40,638
You've got guns, I haven't.
That's your hard luck.

1457
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:44,313
Have you found proof,
Butler? Yes, Campeau talked.

1458
01:28:45,386 --> 01:28:47,251
'Tis a terrible thing
you're doing, Jeff.

1459
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,847
And for what? They've
got the money back.

1460
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:53,189
The soldier that was guarding it
hasn't got his life back, Mollie.

1461
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:56,391
Killing?

1462
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:05,734
Dick would have been safe away
but for me. I got him into this.

1463
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:07,502
(Casement) Come with me, Mollie. No.

1464
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:10,738
The railroad gives short shrift
to a train robber, Mrs. Allen.

1465
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:12,736
Come on, Dick.

1466
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,915
'Tis a brief honeymoon
you're giving the bride.

1467
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:23,081
There's no other way, Mollie.

1468
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:28,355
Can I kiss my husband goodbye?

1469
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:32,831
All right.

1470
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:40,941
[inaudible]

1471
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:52,812
Could you know the
heart-scald that's inside me...

1472
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:55,287
there's much you'd understand, but I...

1473
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:59,291
I know the railroad law and I...

1474
01:29:59,961 --> 01:30:02,156
(Mollie) The window, Dick! Run for it!

1475
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:03,958
[all shouting]

1476
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:07,062
(Jeff) Don't shoot. Don't
shoot into that crowd.

1477
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:08,124
(woman) What did he do?

1478
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:09,191
(man) He robbed the pay train.

1479
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:12,495
What's the ruckus? Dick Allen. Got away.

1480
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:14,040
Well, I declare.

1481
01:30:14,108 --> 01:30:15,700
[crowd chattering]

1482
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:18,444
Leach, get a couple of
horses. (Casement) No, Jeff.

1483
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:21,312
You go on to Laramie.
They'll be needing you there.

1484
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:25,015
Leach and Fiesta will stay here
and give Allen his medicine.

1485
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:28,912
It might be better that way, I reckon.

1486
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:34,722
Maybe.

1487
01:30:42,303 --> 01:30:44,066
When you reach Laramie,
pack your things...

1488
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:46,129
and turn your car over
to the superintendent.

1489
01:30:46,207 --> 01:30:49,005
Your service with the
railroad is finished.

##[scatting]

1491

on the hoof out there.

[whistle blowing]

1495
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:28,607
My apologies, Mrs. Allen.

1496
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:35,246
Disgraceful hour for a
bridegroom to be coming home.

1497

[laughing]

1498
01:32:41,355 --> 01:32:44,756
I'll wash off some of Wyoming
before I kiss you good morning.

1499
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:49,257
A fine wedding night.

1500
01:32:50,364 --> 01:32:53,561
Under a car with a floor
between me and my wife.

1501
01:32:57,471 --> 01:33:00,167
You're not gonna give me
lead for breakfast, are you?

1502
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:08,209
You shouldn't be on this
train. Jeff Butler's aboard.

1503
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:11,477
Jeff? Back in the caboose.

1504
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:18,286
'Tis an awful chance
you're taking, being here.

1505
01:33:19,694 --> 01:33:23,926
You're here, aren't you?
I'm not sure where I am.

1506

[whistle blowing]

1507
01:33:40,715 --> 01:33:42,273
Now, don't look so glum.

1508
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:46,787
Here I am, all washed and beautiful
and wanting a most important kiss.

1509
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:54,252
I loved you before, Mollie.

1510
01:33:55,262 --> 01:33:59,358
But after last night... Dick,
I must tell you straight out.

1511
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:04,101
I don't feel for you what a woman
should for the man she's just married.

1512
01:34:05,339 --> 01:34:07,500
The cards are dealt, Mollie.

1513
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:12,339
I'm the husband you
found in a teacup. I know.

1514
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:16,912
Till death do us apart, but...

1515
01:34:18,419 --> 01:34:21,513
All I'm asking for is
a little time to... Time?

1516
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:24,551
I'm borrowing it from the devil.

1517
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:27,093
Why should I wait? You're
asking me and I'll tell you.

1518
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:29,527
Do you know why I married you so quick?

1519
01:34:31,032 --> 01:34:32,192
Yes.

1520
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:37,969
To stop Brett from putting
a bullet in Jeff's back.

1521
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:39,768
You married me knowing that?

1522
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,740
I love you enough to take
you any way I can get you.

1523
01:34:41,809 --> 01:34:43,504
Listen to me, Dick. I...

1524
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:48,241
I've loved Jeff ever since I clouted
his face on the Omaha train...

1525
01:34:48,716 --> 01:34:51,480
but I'm married to you and
I'll stay that way, but...

1526
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:55,482
Don't start out by making me hate you.

1527
01:34:58,259 --> 01:35:00,284
You won't hate me, Mollie.

1528
01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:03,387
You'll love me.

1529
01:35:07,134 --> 01:35:08,567
Gorry. What's hit us?

Now's our chance. Once we're clear
of the train they won't get us.

1546
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:49,657
I'm going to find Mollie. It's
too late to do her any good.

1547
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:50,924
Maybe.

Come on, you fool, before they see us.

01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:25,113
About 16 for the carbine.

1572
01:40:25,252 --> 01:40:28,688
Any chance of getting help?
If we could telegraph Cheyenne.

1573
01:40:29,089 --> 01:40:31,455
Wires cut? No.

1574

But we've got nothing to send with.

1575
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:36,788
Mr. Calvin showed me how
to send without any key.

How? Manna from heaven.

1577
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:41,891
The wires across the window.
Cut one and give me your gun.

1578
01:40:47,908 --> 01:40:50,399
When I break it, pull the other
end down through the smashed roof.

Through your private entrance?

What'll I say? Cheyenne.

Some operator feeling his liquor, Alida.

1602
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:39,748

What do you think?

1613
01:43:48,989 --> 01:43:50,786
We'll try again, Mollie.

1614
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:52,525
Keep sending.

Why do you keep me loading when
there's shooting to be done?

1637
01:46:15,502 --> 01:46:19,404
Because you wasted a shot on
that cigar store Indian out there.

Yeah, what did you have against him?

You're just joking to
keep me spirits up...

1640

01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:41,746
How is she?

1734
01:52:41,821 --> 01:52:44,688
Doctor says she'll
come through all right.

1735
01:52:45,692 --> 01:52:47,853
My thanks to the Big Dealer.

1736
01:52:48,161 --> 01:52:51,528
I'm afraid it's going to be
a long pull for her, though.

1737
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:54,567
And you won't let me see her?

1738
01:52:55,335 --> 01:52:56,597
Dick...

1739
01:52:58,004 --> 01:53:00,871
you and I have fought
side by side many times.

1740
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:02,703
We've been through
hell and high water...

1741
01:53:02,776 --> 01:53:06,177
robbed the same chicken
coop, chewed on the same bone.

1742
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:09,813
But you're on the other
side in this fight...

1743
01:53:10,183 --> 01:53:14,483
and the next time I see you on Union
Pacific property, I'll have to...

1744
01:53:15,522 --> 01:53:17,183
You got a match?

1745
01:53:18,358 --> 01:53:21,293
Won't your conscience
bother you for letting me go?

1746
01:53:21,361 --> 01:53:24,694
There's grub and blankets
in the pack on that horse.

1747
01:53:25,064 --> 01:53:26,929
I won't be hung for
horse stealing, will I?

1748
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:27,989
[chuckles]

1749
01:53:28,268 --> 01:53:31,362
Belonged to an Indian.
He won't need it anymore.

1750
01:53:32,005 --> 01:53:33,199
All right.

1751
01:53:34,007 --> 01:53:36,066
All right. I'll get going.

1752
01:53:36,176 --> 01:53:37,507
Where to?

1753
01:53:39,612 --> 01:53:41,079
Central Pacific.

1754
01:53:43,483 --> 01:53:45,644
You're going to help the
road that's trying to beat us?

1755
01:53:45,718 --> 01:53:46,810
Yeah.

1756
01:53:47,153 --> 01:53:50,748
I'm gonna help them the same
way I helped the Union Pacific.

1757
01:53:52,358 --> 01:53:54,326
Here. You might need that.

1758
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:58,025
Don't deal any cards off
the bottom with it. Thanks.

1759
01:53:58,298 --> 01:54:00,994
Extra cartridges in the pack. Thanks.

1760
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:03,431
You're all aces, bucko.

1761
01:54:03,503 --> 01:54:05,937
But you're in love with Mollie...

1762
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:08,530
and don't you ever forget she's my wife.

1763
01:54:08,608 --> 01:54:10,803
I might. She wouldn't.

1764
01:54:18,017 --> 01:54:21,783
Now, when the Central meets the
Union's tracks, I'll be there, Jeff...

1765
01:54:22,088 --> 01:54:24,352
and you and the Union Pacific
and the devil himself...

1766
01:54:24,424 --> 01:54:26,722
won't keep me from my wife.

1767
01:54:28,294 --> 01:54:30,785
I'd hate to kill you with your own gun.

1768
01:54:31,865 --> 01:54:33,457
I'll be there, Dick.

1769
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:38,967
Oh, Jeff...

1770
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:42,674
you're wasting your time on Campeau.

1771
01:54:42,976 --> 01:54:45,672
The man behind him is
Barrows, the banker.

1772
01:54:46,179 --> 01:54:47,407
Thanks.

1773
01:54:48,281 --> 01:54:50,579
So long, Dick. So long, bucko.

1774
01:55:20,713 --> 01:55:22,237
[wind howling]

1775
01:55:26,419 --> 01:55:29,582
Thirty days? Thundering
Hades! We can't lose one day.

1776
01:55:29,656 --> 01:55:33,456
The ground in that tunnel is frozen
harder than rock. We can't dig through!

1777
01:55:33,526 --> 01:55:36,256
We've got to blast
every inch for 900 feet.

1778
01:55:36,329 --> 01:55:37,887
Stuck here for 30 days?

1779
01:55:37,964 --> 01:55:39,693
And Ogden only 60 miles away.

1780
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:41,393
And the Central on the plains...

1781
01:55:41,467 --> 01:55:44,595
with nothing to stop them
but daisies and buttercups.

1782
01:55:44,671 --> 01:55:47,367
In the Army, when we can't smash
through the enemy's center...

1783
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,101
we always go around the flanks.

1784
01:55:49,175 --> 01:55:50,972
What's that, Butler?

1785
01:55:51,044 --> 01:55:52,944
Lay a track on the snow.

1786
01:55:53,012 --> 01:55:54,138
What? On the snow?

1787
01:55:54,213 --> 01:55:56,909
On the snow? No one
ever laid track on snow.

1788
01:55:56,983 --> 01:55:58,314
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1789
01:55:58,384 --> 01:56:01,251
Go ahead, Butler. I'll
show you what I mean.

1790
01:56:02,522 --> 01:56:05,252
Go around the mountain
instead of through it.

1791
01:56:05,325 --> 01:56:07,657
Then finish your tunnel
later. Impossible.

1792
01:56:07,727 --> 01:56:08,887
Impossible?

1793
01:56:08,962 --> 01:56:11,226
It was impossible to lay
four miles of track a day...

1794
01:56:11,297 --> 01:56:13,128
impossible to clear out the gamblers...

1795
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:15,326
impossible to make
engines climb mountains.

1796
01:56:15,401 --> 01:56:18,199
Jumping Beelzebub! It was impossible
for Moses to cross the Red Sea.

1797
01:56:18,271 --> 01:56:20,330
Why can't we lay track on top of snow?

1798
01:56:20,406 --> 01:56:22,203
Well, let's find out.

1799
01:56:22,575 --> 01:56:24,440
[all muttering]

1800
01:56:25,545 --> 01:56:26,842
You never seen the like.

1801
01:56:26,913 --> 01:56:29,541
A track laid on 10 feet of snow.

1802
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:31,712
We have the race as good as won.

1803
01:56:31,784 --> 01:56:32,808
[chuckling]

1804
01:56:32,885 --> 01:56:34,910
Come here before you hang yourself.

1805
01:56:34,988 --> 01:56:36,353
That Jeff Butler...

1806
01:56:36,422 --> 01:56:38,686
don't wear all his
brains in his holster.

1807
01:56:38,758 --> 01:56:40,749
Who's going to take
the first train over?

1808
01:56:40,827 --> 01:56:44,285
Now, who else would they be trusting
to it but me and old McPherson.

1809
01:56:44,364 --> 01:56:46,457
It is a chancy thing, so
don't go breaking your neck.

1810
01:56:46,532 --> 01:56:49,501
Well, 'tis the first time for
an engine to run on snow...

1811
01:56:49,569 --> 01:56:52,333
and if he don't like it,
I'll put snowshoes on him.

1812
01:56:52,405 --> 01:56:55,738
Here, open your mouth and
take what's good for you.

1813
01:57:00,947 --> 01:57:03,677
Tastes like it come out
of McPherson's boiler.

1814
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:06,719
The highest and longest
railroad in the whole world...

1815
01:57:06,786 --> 01:57:09,186
had just come out of McPherson's boiler.

1816
01:57:09,255 --> 01:57:11,553
So don't you be insulting him.

1817
01:57:11,858 --> 01:57:13,086
Here...

1818
01:57:13,893 --> 01:57:16,225
take this along in case you...

1819
01:57:19,332 --> 01:57:21,766
Let me kiss you to keep you warm.

1820
01:57:40,887 --> 01:57:44,084
Looks like you won't need to put
those snowshoes on him, Monahan.

1821
01:57:44,157 --> 01:57:46,591
Well, he's been through fire and snow...

1822
01:57:46,659 --> 01:57:49,389
and if he comes to a
river, he'll swim it.

1823
01:57:49,495 --> 01:57:50,484
[laughing]

1824
01:57:57,537 --> 01:58:00,370
They're going to make it. Sure they are.

1825
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:12,681
Jump, Monahan! Jump!

1826
01:58:12,752 --> 01:58:15,220
There she goes! Look out, Monahan!

1827
01:58:35,374 --> 01:58:37,035
They're both gone!

1828
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:38,805
(Casement) Poor old Monahan.

1829
01:58:39,245 --> 01:58:40,576
[gasping]

1830
01:58:46,252 --> 01:58:47,241
[panting]

1831
01:58:47,854 --> 01:58:49,947
I know you're hurting me...

1832
01:58:50,089 --> 01:58:51,989
no more than you can help.

1833
01:58:52,058 --> 01:58:53,184
Monahan!

1834
01:59:00,032 --> 01:59:03,559
Monahan! Praise Heaven, you're alive.

1835
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:05,828
I fell clear. We'll get you out.

1836
01:59:05,905 --> 01:59:07,429
It's no use, Jeff.

1837
01:59:07,507 --> 01:59:10,408
Me and him has come to End of Track.

1838
01:59:10,610 --> 01:59:11,838
Oh, no.

1839
01:59:19,452 --> 01:59:21,818
Now. Oh, no, it's no use.

1840
01:59:24,056 --> 01:59:26,354
You'll have to beat the Central...

1841
01:59:26,425 --> 01:59:28,791
to Ogden without us...

1842
01:59:29,695 --> 01:59:31,094
if you can.

1843
01:59:31,364 --> 01:59:33,525
That'll be hard without you.

1844
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:35,157
Mollie's cross.

1845
01:59:42,241 --> 01:59:44,971
Bury us both together, Jeff.

1846
01:59:46,345 --> 01:59:49,508
Here where we can hear
the trains thundering by.

1847
01:59:52,185 --> 01:59:55,951
There's nothing like
hearing an engine whistle...

1848
01:59:56,889 --> 01:59:58,789
in the still night.

1849
02:00:17,343 --> 02:00:19,243
What's to be done now?

1850
02:00:21,647 --> 02:00:24,115
Start shoring up that track, Dusky.

1851
02:00:39,899 --> 02:00:42,459
And what will happen
to the railroad now?

1852
02:00:43,603 --> 02:00:46,265
As soon as the track's
shored up, we'll try again...

1853
02:00:46,339 --> 02:00:48,136
with another train.

1854
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:53,274
Hook this car on it, will you?

1855
02:01:12,298 --> 02:01:16,632
There's only one thing wrong
about dying in the snow, Jefferson.

1856
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:19,261
A fella's liable to catch cold!

1857
02:01:19,338 --> 02:01:21,431
Here she comes! Tighten up!

1858
02:01:26,545 --> 02:01:29,810
Good boy, Jeff! The
Central can't beat us now.

1859
02:01:37,490 --> 02:01:39,151
He's over! They've made it!

1860
02:01:39,225 --> 02:01:41,352
[all cheering] I told
you they could do it!

1861
02:01:46,465 --> 02:01:48,933
You passed the 1000 Mile
Tree back there, General.

1862
02:01:49,001 --> 02:01:50,263
We're gonna beat them, Jeff.

1863
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:52,634
We lay six miles of track
today, seven tomorrow...

1864
02:01:52,705 --> 02:01:54,900
Then wire your congratulations
to the Central Pacific.

1865
02:01:54,974 --> 02:01:55,963
Why? What's wrong?

1866
02:01:56,042 --> 02:01:58,909
That parlor engineer that Asa M. Barrows
brought with him just condemned...

1867
02:01:58,978 --> 02:02:00,240
27 miles of our track.

1868
02:02:00,313 --> 02:02:02,042
What? Condemned 27 miles?

1869
02:02:02,114 --> 02:02:04,082
Why, that'll let the Central
into Ogden ahead of us.

1870
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:05,640
Barrows, huh?

1871
02:02:07,086 --> 02:02:08,178
Boy...

1872
02:02:08,754 --> 02:02:11,723
Get me Leach Overmile
and Fiesta. Yes, sir.

1873
02:02:12,525 --> 02:02:15,551
You lay the track into
Ogden, General Casement...

1874
02:02:15,728 --> 02:02:17,719
I'll handle Mr. Barrows.

1875
02:02:19,665 --> 02:02:21,428
You'll regret this.

1876
02:02:22,335 --> 02:02:25,168
You'll regret this as long as you...

1877
02:02:26,205 --> 02:02:28,435
Don't you worry none
about us, Mr. Barrows.

1878
02:02:28,507 --> 02:02:31,271
You just think about yourself. Here.

1879
02:02:32,945 --> 02:02:34,742
This is plain abduction.

1880
02:02:34,814 --> 02:02:36,281
Do you hear that, Fiesta?

1881
02:02:36,349 --> 02:02:37,373
Abduction.

1882
02:02:37,450 --> 02:02:38,439
[chuckling]

1883
02:02:38,517 --> 02:02:41,179
That is why I had to
marry my first wife.

1884
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:42,817
[laughing]

1885
02:02:43,155 --> 02:02:44,850
How much do you want?

1886
02:02:44,924 --> 02:02:48,724
We don't want nothing. We're just interested
in the Union Pacific, same as you are.

1887
02:02:48,794 --> 02:02:50,455
Here, put that on.

1888
02:02:51,263 --> 02:02:54,255
Now, about this track you
say won't pass inspection.

1889
02:02:54,333 --> 02:02:55,459
What about it?

1890
02:02:55,534 --> 02:02:59,334
You and us are going to walk over
every inch of that 27 mile of track...

1891
02:02:59,405 --> 02:03:03,068
and then you're going to show
us every place that needs fixing.

1892
02:03:03,142 --> 02:03:04,336
What?

1893
02:03:04,510 --> 02:03:06,876
And then you're going to fix it.

1894
02:03:11,617 --> 02:03:14,313
Walk over 27 miles of track.

1895
02:03:14,387 --> 02:03:17,447
Here's your cane, Mr.
Barrows. Time's a-wasting.

1896

##[Leach and Fiesta humming]

1897

Here's another one, right there.

02:03:30,069 --> 02:03:31,229
[sighing]

1899
02:03:33,072 --> 02:03:35,506
Seems to me like I've found more
the matter with this track...

1900
02:03:35,574 --> 02:03:37,166
than you have, Mr. Barrows.

1901
02:03:41,046 --> 02:03:42,809
He will ruin the railroad.

1902
02:03:42,882 --> 02:03:45,112
You're all mixed up, Mr. Barrows.

1903
02:03:45,184 --> 02:03:47,812
You're trying to drive the
tie through the spike...

1904
02:03:47,887 --> 02:03:50,481
instead of the spike through the tie.

1905
02:03:53,292 --> 02:03:54,816
##[humming]

1906
02:03:55,027 --> 02:03:57,188
I do declare, he's improving.

1907
02:04:01,267 --> 02:04:02,700
General Casement. Yeah?

1908
02:04:02,768 --> 02:04:05,498
At this very moment, the
Union Pacific's first train...

1909
02:04:05,571 --> 02:04:07,732
is pulling into Ogden, Utah.

1910
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:10,804
The victor in the great
race to girdle the continent.

1911
02:04:10,876 --> 02:04:13,344
<i>Say, does the New York Tribune
own this telegraph line?</i>

1912
02:04:13,412 --> 02:04:15,243
<i>We're about to turn it
over to the Boston Post.</i>

1913
02:04:15,314 --> 02:04:16,440
Gentlemen...

1914
02:04:16,515 --> 02:04:19,143
President Grant has chosen
Promontory Point, west of Ogden...

1915
02:04:19,218 --> 02:04:22,051
as the place where the two Pacific
railroads shall meet and join their rails.

1916
02:04:22,121 --> 02:04:24,055
Promontory Point? Where is that?

1917
02:04:24,123 --> 02:04:27,456
And so President Grant has chosen
Promontory Point as the meeting place...

1918
02:04:27,526 --> 02:04:29,118
[all chattering] for the two railroads.

1919
02:04:29,195 --> 02:04:30,787
<i>The actual meeting place...</i>

1920
02:04:45,411 --> 02:04:47,038
[knocking on door]

1921
02:04:47,847 --> 02:04:49,007
Jeff.

1922
02:04:49,348 --> 02:04:51,873
I've not seen you in a month of Sundays.

1923
02:04:51,951 --> 02:04:53,578
Sit yourself down.

1924
02:04:54,887 --> 02:04:59,085
I just came over to say goodbye before
you get lost in the crowd out there.

1925
02:04:59,158 --> 02:05:01,991
Everybody's coming to
see the engines meet.

1926
02:05:03,262 --> 02:05:04,559
You know...

1927
02:05:04,630 --> 02:05:07,997
California sent a golden
spike to clinch the last rail.

1928
02:05:09,969 --> 02:05:11,903
But when they drive it...

1929
02:05:12,771 --> 02:05:15,239
it will mean the end of everything.

1930
02:05:16,008 --> 02:05:17,441
Not for you.

1931
02:05:18,611 --> 02:05:20,374
Dick'll be out there...

1932
02:05:20,446 --> 02:05:23,609
waiting to take you to a
home that's not on wheels.

1933
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:27,016
And no engines whistling
to put me to sleep.

1934
02:05:28,621 --> 02:05:31,784
And where will your
restless boots be taking you?

1935
02:05:31,924 --> 02:05:33,084
Texas.

1936
02:05:33,759 --> 02:05:35,886
They're starting
another road down there.

1937
02:05:35,961 --> 02:05:38,521
Dodge asked me to go as an engineer.

1938
02:05:38,597 --> 02:05:41,157
It's the coming true of your dream.

1939
02:05:41,967 --> 02:05:43,525
I am glad for you.

1940
02:05:44,370 --> 02:05:45,632
Sure...

1941
02:05:45,938 --> 02:05:49,203
sure there'll be some girl
to throw you sheep's eyes...

1942
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:54,440
and boil the tea when
you call for your mail.

1943
02:05:58,484 --> 02:06:00,645
Mollie. 'Tis just the excitement...

1944
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:02,949
of joining the rails and all.

1945
02:06:03,355 --> 02:06:06,324
Remember me to yourself
sometimes when you're...

1946
02:06:06,392 --> 02:06:10,761
when you're riding the handcars with
some of them beautiful Texas women.

1947
02:06:15,801 --> 02:06:17,826
It's you I'll always want.

1948
02:06:17,903 --> 02:06:20,599
Some of your sweetness
got into my blood.

1949
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:23,870
I guess it's there for life.

1950
02:06:24,043 --> 02:06:26,568
And my heart will be answering you...

1951
02:06:27,379 --> 02:06:29,472
as long as ever it beats.

1952
02:06:36,956 --> 02:06:41,916
And now you'll be merciful if you'd take
yourself out of here as quick as you can.

1953
02:06:43,762 --> 02:06:45,457
Goodbye, Mollie.

Ain't no hard feelings

02:07:23,002 --> 02:07:26,529
I'd put you in jail but for
one thing. You like us, eh?

1961
02:07:26,605 --> 02:07:28,971
I hate the sight of you.
You've cost me millions.

1962
02:07:29,041 --> 02:07:31,339
But you've cured my indigestion.

ain't out to the big jamboree?

1965

I got something else to do.

1966
02:07:45,924 --> 02:07:49,018
...and that this mighty
enterprise maybe unto us...

1967
02:07:49,094 --> 02:07:51,460
as the Atlantic of thy strength...

1968

and the Pacific of thy love. Amen.

1969

I'll bet that all them that lies
under the sod between here and Omaha...

would love to see this sight.

1971

They're laying golden rails in Heaven.

1972

And Monahan's giving the angels
a free ride on old McPherson.

so magnificent in contemplation...

02:09:11,944 --> 02:09:13,377
she has forged a spike.

1999
02:09:13,445 --> 02:09:15,072
From her laurel woods...

2000
02:09:15,147 --> 02:09:16,876
she has hewn a tie.

2001

And by the hands of her citizens...

2002
02:09:19,151 --> 02:09:22,609
she offers them to become a
part of the great highway...

which is about to unite
her in closer fellowship...

From her bosom was taken the first soil.

Let hers be the last
tie and the last spike.

02:12:49,561 --> 02:12:50,994
Dick. Dick!

2047
02:12:54,533 --> 02:12:56,125
Watch yourself.

2048
02:12:56,635 --> 02:12:58,000
Campeau.

2049
02:12:59,738 --> 02:13:03,037
I'll get you to a doctor
first. No. No use, Jeff.

2050
02:13:03,241 --> 02:13:05,368
I've drawn the black deuce.

2051
02:13:07,579 --> 02:13:09,547
Bend closer. Mollie...

2052
02:13:13,652 --> 02:13:15,142
I'm just a...

2053
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:16,209
[panting]

2054
02:13:17,089 --> 02:13:19,148
I'm just a busted flush.

2055
02:13:22,260 --> 02:13:24,091
It's your deal, Jeff.

2056
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:36,038
[gun firing]

2057
02:13:44,082 --> 02:13:45,515
Yes, sir.

2058
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:52,181
The very next day she trotted
a mile in two minutes flat.

2059
02:13:54,226 --> 02:13:55,557
Thank you!

2060
02:13:57,029 --> 02:13:59,463
And so this great nation is united...

2061
02:13:59,531 --> 02:14:01,556
with a wedding ring of iron.

2062
02:14:01,633 --> 02:14:03,362
Mr. Bradford!
Mr. Booth!

2063
02:14:03,769 --> 02:14:05,327
[crowd chattering]

2064
02:14:07,072 --> 02:14:09,597
The saints be praised, you're safe.

2065
02:14:11,343 --> 02:14:12,776
Where's Dick?

2066
02:14:15,147 --> 02:14:17,377
He'll be waiting for us, Mollie...

2067
02:14:17,783 --> 02:14:19,444
at the End of Track.

2068
02:14:21,119 --> 02:14:22,814
[crowd cheering]

2069
02:14:27,059 --> 02:14:28,890
[train whistle blowing]
