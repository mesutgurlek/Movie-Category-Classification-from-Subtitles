00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,540
SHANSSEY: Hello, Ed.
- Where's Doc Holliday?

2
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,125
SHANSSEY: Over at the hotel.
He's been expecting you...

3
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,336
Get word over there
I'm waiting for him.

4
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:56,470
No need to do that, Ed. The whole town
knows you're waiting for him by now.

5
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,856
Before there's
another killing...

6
00:03:57,882 --> 00:03:59,794
Just go on serving your
watered-down liquor.

7
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,425
And keep out of my
business, Shanssey.

8
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,435
SHANSSEY: Your brother came in here
stinking drunk, spoiling for a fight.

9
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,643
- Whiskey. Over there.
SHANSSEY: He drew a gun on Holliday.

10
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,815
Have it your way, Ed.

11
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,151
Check your guns if
you wanna stay here.

12
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,042
Leave the bottle.

13
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,093
You don't stand a chance, Doc.

14
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,925
Bailey brought two men with him.

15
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,637
Oh, come on, honey. Let's cut out
of here while there's still time.

16
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,895
The whole town, including that
no-good marshal, is laying for you.

17
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:53,569
Right or wrong, they're gonna hang you
for another killing. You know it.

18
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,816
Doc.

19
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,241
Oh, you ain't even listening to me.

20
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,779
Now, Kate, Mr. Bailey came all
the way from Fort Worth...

21
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,743
...to see me on a
gentleman's matter.

22
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:06,953
A gentleman. Hmph.

23
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,743
It wouldn't be hospitable for me
to leave town, now, would it?

24
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,083
Don't start that gentleman
business with me again.

25
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,339
It was a pure case
of ethics, but...

26

(CHUCKLES)

27
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,424
Well, that's something a person
like you wouldn't understand.

28
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,594
Why do you always have to
treat me like I'm dirt?

29
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,509
You ain't no better than me.

30
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,645
- That's debatable.
- Oh, is it?

31
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,398
You and that magnolia dripping.

32
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,354
Let me tell you something,
Doc Holliday.

33
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,237
All them fancy clothes and that smart
talk don't make you no gentleman.

34
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,444
You are dirt, just like me...

35
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:44,032
...and I'm tired of hearing about
that Georgia plantation...

36
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,196
...and all them lily-white
friends of yours.

37
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,708
They're all gone now.
They're all gone!

38
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,459
Yes, they are.

39
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,624
Here I am with you.

40
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,923
Your family scraped the barrel
after the war wiped them out...

41
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,804
...just to send you through
dental school. Heh.

42
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,840
You sure turned out fine.

43
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,600
They'd be real proud of you.

Doc, please.

49
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,115
Forget about Bailey.

50

Let's get out of here
while there's still time.

51

Maybe...

52
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,549
Maybe we could even go to
Laredo like you said...

53
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,506
...and do something about
that cough of yours.

54
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,920
It's getting worse all the time.

55
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,090
Your concern over my
health touches me deeply.

56
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,929
You know how I feel about you.

57
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,968
I know exactly how you feel.

58
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,516
I don't know...

59
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,151
I don't know what I'd do if
anything happened to you.

60
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,279
You'd lose your meal ticket,
wouldn't you?

61
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,483
That ain't nice to say to me, Doc.

62
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,868
I been good to you, ain't I?

63
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,114
Why don't you think about
me once in a while?

64
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,667
All right, get over to Shanssey's
and tell them I'll be there later.

Hope you got some good news for me.

72

Ike Clanton rode through here
three days ago heading east.

73

74
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,100
Johnny Ringo was with him.

75
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,557
Rode through heading east?
You didn't get my telegram?

76
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,437
I got it.

77
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,308
Why didn't you hold him?

78
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,403
I have no quarrel with Ike Clanton.
Nothing to hold him for.

79
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,691
Nothing to hold him for?

80
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,281
Why, man, he's got a dozen
charges against him.

81
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,117
I played this whole thing so
he'd be forced into Griffin.

82
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,284
I figured if there was one man in Texas
who could stop him, you'd be the man.

83
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,998
Now, don't go getting your
blood heated up, Wyatt.

84

Cotton, it's Wyatt Earp
you're talking to.

Ten years ago, I watched

into a saloon in Oklahoma City...

87

...and knock out three of the
fastest guns in the territory.

88
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,641
Ten years is a long time ago.

89
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,894
Getting old, I guess.

90
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,396
Anybody ever told me that Cotton
Wilson had gone yellow...

91
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,940
...I'd call him a liar.
- You got no right to say that to me.

92
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,359
I've bucked heads with the
toughest gangs on the frontier.

93

Then why didn't you stop Ringo
and Clanton? Why didn't you?

turn in your badge.

...in back of a cruddy
boardinghouse and a tin star.

00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,801
Think I like winding up
in a place like this?

line for me, Wyatt.

Good evening, Mr. Earp.

158
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,961
I know something that
would interest you.

159
00:13:46,987 --> 00:13:49,580
You don't know a thing
that would interest me.

160
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,857
Suppose I was to tell
you that Ed Bailey...

161
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,773
...has a small Derringer
hidden in his boot.

162
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,325
- Left or right?
- Left.

163
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,825
I'd say that was good information.
Bailey's left-handed.

164
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,994
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo rode
through here three days ago.

165
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,955
You played cards. Which
way were they heading?

166
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,461
- Beats me.
- I thought we were making a deal.

167
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,997
That's what you said.
I didn't make any deals.

- But you know where they went, don't you?
- Look, you're interrupting my game.

Got a real big hate for the law,
haven't you?

170
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,734
Any reason why I shouldn't?

171
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,070
Your brother Morgan ran me
out of Deadwood last year...

172
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,906
...and impounded
$10,000 of my money.

173
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,477
Hmm. As a matter of fact,
you've got brothers

174
00:14:48,503 --> 00:14:51,065
marshaling all over the
frontier, haven't you?

175

- Not a thing.

179
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:18,439
It's my hunch they headed for Tombstone.
Ike's old man has a big ranch there.

180

But I can't be sure.

Isn't your brother Virgil
a marshal at Tombstone?

182
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,226
That's right. I sent him
a telegram asking him

183
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:26,093
to be on the lookout
for him just in case.

- There's nothing I can do.

- Mr. Holliday.
- Yes?

00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,667
Would you care to settle
up your bill now?

You'd be smart to get out while you can.

in from Fort Worth to see me.

have taught his brother

01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,686
KELLY: You heard the marshal.

(MEN GRUMBLING)

770
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:39,815
KELLY: Come on. Let's get moving.

771
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:44,202
I don't suppose you want my thanks.

772
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:47,497
Let's just say my account
is paid in full.

773
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,783
And don't take it personal,
marshal.

774
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:13,060
Morning, Doc.

775
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,100
Morning.

776
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:22,984
Just thought you'd like to know there's
gonna be one less lawman in the territory.

777
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,777
That's always good news to me.

778
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,371
I'm heading for California,
buying a ranch.

779
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:31,204
I'm taking your good advice,
getting out while there's time.

780
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:32,413
Smart man.

781
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,920
Laura's coming with me.

782
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,581
We're getting married
in a few days.

783
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:42,636
We'd like you to come to the wedding, Doc,
if it doesn't interfere with your poker.

784
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:46,716
I'm not good at weddings,
only funerals. Deal me out.

785
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,430
Wyatt.

786
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,141
She's a real lady.

787
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,730
I wish you both a lot of happiness.

788
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:02,230
You're lucky to be getting
out of this country.

789
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:05,029
Why don't you try your luck?

790
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,531
HOLLIDAY: Hmm.

(HOLLIDAY CHUCKLES)

792
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:11,865
So long, Doc.

793
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,593
Take me back, Doc.

794
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,682
Please?

795
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,640
Give me another chance.

796
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,866
Please take me back.

797
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,988
I'll do anything you say.

798
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:54,040
I don't care how you treat me.

799
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,503
Doc, I'm sorry for what I done.

800
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:01,005
It's not your fault, Kate.

801
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,713
It's not my fault.
It's not anybody's fault.

802
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:07,049
It's just the way the cards fall.

803
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:13,643
I never gave you much
of a chance, did I?

804
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:19,357
Maybe it could have been different
if I was right to you, but...

805
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:22,019
it ain't too late, Doc.
I'll be good to you.

806
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,187
I... I promise.

807
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:25,901
It's too late for both of us.

808
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:30,486
Do something better for yourself
while you've still got the chance.

809
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,840
Don't let me go, Doc.
Don't let me go back there.

810
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:51,347
Leave me alone.
Just leave me alone.

811
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,728
I'll see you dead.

(DOOR CLOSES)

813
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,211
- Hi, Wyatt.
- Charlie.

814
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,832
You got a letter from
the attorney general.

815
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:29,369
What's he got to say?

816
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:38,686
He says he can get you an appointment
as U.S. marshal any time you want it.

817
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,558
Wyatt Earp, United States marshal.
That's all I need.

818
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,902
These are all dead, Charlie.

819
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,104
Oh, before I forget...

820
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,194
...this is yours now.

821
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,325
I'm through as a lawman for good.

822
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:58,118
- Oh, you got a telegram too.
- Read it.

823
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,605
Virgil's my brother.

824
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:30,363
He's in trouble. He needs me.
Try to understand, Laura.

825
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,865
I understand I was
foolish to fall in love.

826
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:35,489
- If only I could...
- Wyatt, when I first met you...

827
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:38,030
...I told you I wouldn't follow
you from town to town...

828
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:39,987
sitting in the darkness,
waiting for someone

829
01:07:40,013 --> 01:07:41,566
to bring the news
you'd been killed.

830
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,542
I won't live that way.

831
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:46,170
We're not gonna start a life
together with a gun in your hand.

832
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,673
I swear to you, Laura.
I'm through after Tombstone.

833
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,048
You'll never be through.

834
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:52,131
Your reputation will follow
you wherever you are.

- Laura, he's my brother.
- And I'm to be your wife.

836
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:58,016
- Don't ask me to let him down.
- Don't let me down.

837
01:07:58,116 --> 01:08:01,095
I'd give up anything.
I'll go anywhere for you.

838
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,103
I'll work beside you in the fields.

839

But you've got to meet me halfway.

840
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:26,828
I must go to Tombstone.

841
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:31,667
All right, go. Clean up Tombstone.

842
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:33,881
There's a hundred more
Tombstones on the frontier...

great Wyatt Earp.

Good afternoon, marshal.
Out for a little ride?

849
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,904
About 700 miles' worth. Tombstone.

850
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:19,111
Tombstone, huh?
I'm heading that way myself.

851
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:22,072
I understand the climate down
there may be better for my cough.

852
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:24,488
Since when have you gotten
interested in your health?

853
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:27,373
Well, it's really a matter of finances.
The deck's gone cold here.

854
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:29,910
Nobody will give me any play.

855
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:31,994
Mind if I ride along?

856
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:34,297
It's a free country. Hop on.

857
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:36,541
Where's your gear?

858
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:52,041
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

859
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:59,874
Well, thanks for the ride.
Sell my horse and get a good price.

no guns, no killing.

Man, that's good.

I just about forgot what a
home-cooked meal tastes like.

866

Betty, I'm gonna steal
you away from Virgil.

867
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,364
By golly, Wyatt, you're gonna
be the only single one left.

868
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:29,369
I got a family going in Deadwood.

Even little Jimmy here's tying the
knot when he gets back to California.

Say, when are you gonna
get hitched, Wyatt?

874
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,550

There's the signal for women and
children to leave the room.

Come on, Tommy.
It's your bedtime now.

877
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,477
Aw, Mom, do I have to?

878
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:58,983
Yes, you do. Your uncles
will all be here tomorrow.

879
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,564
TOMMY: Good night, Uncle Wyatt.
- Good night, Tommy.

01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,900
TOMMY: Good night, Uncle Morgan.
- Good night, son.

881
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:06,191
- Good night, Uncle James.
JIMMY: Good night, Tommy.

882
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:08,405
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, son.

883
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:13,865
It's nice to have you here.

884
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:17,790
I only wish it were under
happier circumstances.

885
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:28,797
She seems pretty upset.

886
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:32,183
Well, she's been after me for
a year to quit marshaling.

887
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,389
You know how women are.

888
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,435
All right. Now, let's get
down to business.

889
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:41,146
Now, Morgan and Jimmy
know the setup here.

890
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,482
Now, Wyatt, you know Ike Clanton
has a ranch outside city limits.

891
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:45,737
Yes, I know.

892
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:49,821
He's organized the toughest bunch
of gunslingers you ever laid eyes on.

893
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,201
He owns the county sheriff.

894
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,704
- Who is he?
- Cotton Wilson.

895
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,366
Cotton Wilson.
So Ike paid off on his deal.

896
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:59,786
Clanton's been rustling Mexican
cattle by the thousands.

897
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,579
And he has to move them.

898
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,760
He can only ship them
out of Tombstone,

899
01:14:03,786 --> 01:14:06,322
and he can't do that while
we control the city.

900
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:07,585
That's about it.

901
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,754
He's organized, and he's mean.

902
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,797
We can't keep him out
of Tombstone forever.

903
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:13,620
What about the
people of Tombstone?

904
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,510
John Clum, editor of the <i>Epitaph...</i>

905
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:19,977
and some of the leading citizens will back
us if they know you're calling the shots.

906
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:23,609
We're all agreed, Wyatt.
You should run the show.

907
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:31,905
There's only one thing
that bothers me...

908
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:34,537
...and I wanna speak my piece now.

909
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:39,534
There's gonna be a lot of bad talk
about you riding with Doc Holliday.

910
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,789
What about Holliday?

911
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:45,252
MORGAN: He's the worst killer on the
frontier, that's what about him.

912
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,509
It just don't look good,
you coming here with him.

913
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,968
Holliday saved my life in Dodge City.
I don't forget that.

914
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,303
What's more,
he's a man of his word.

915
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:58,094
As long as he plays his cards
straight and keeps out of killings...

916
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,513
...we got no right to
run him out of town.

917
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,382
I didn't know you
two were a team.

918
01:15:02,408 --> 01:15:04,880
We're not. It's just
a case of square deal.

919
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,815
Holliday stays.

920
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:10,823
All right, Wyatt.
He's your responsibility.

921
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:13,234
That suits me fine. Do we
have a map of the county?

922
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:16,479
The first thing we
gotta do is let the

923
01:15:16,505 --> 01:15:18,978
Clantons know that the
city is closed to them.

924
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:22,369
Then we gotta control the county.
Now, that's important.

925
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,192
I'm gonna get a letter
off to a man tonight

926

who'll take care of
that matter for us.

927
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:27,878
- Now show me where the Clanton ranch is.
- Here.

928
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,257
Where does he keep his men?

929
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,854
Hello, Cotton.
I've been expecting you.

930
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:44,606
You're looking fine,
real prosperous.

931
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:47,564
- Oh, I ain't complaining.
- What's on your mind?

932
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:51,776
Wyatt, Ike wants to make you a deal.
He promises no trouble...

933
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:53,941
...if you let him ship his
cattle out of Tombstone.

934
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:57,032
- Well, that's mighty nice of Ike.
- Ike's a nice fella.

935
01:15:57,094 --> 01:16:00,698
He's got a fortune tied up in
cattle out there at the ranch...

936
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:03,789
...and he's gonna move them.
- Oh, he is, huh?

937
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:13,879
There's $20,000 in
it for you, cash.

938
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:17,723
Twenty thousand dollars?

939
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:19,429
The wages of sin are rising.

940
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:22,728
Twenty thousand against
a 6-foot hole in Boot Hill...

941
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:26,562
...or a $20-a-month pension if you
live long enough to collect it.

942
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:34,607
I've thought about those things.

943
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,531
You know, Cotton...

944
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:47,044
...this is a nice little town,
a good place to set a while.

945
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,789
I might even run for county
sheriff in a couple of months.

946
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,583
That don't scare me at all.
I got mine.

947
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,845
I got a ranch now and 25,000 in
the bank, and you know something?

948
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:58,552
It don't bother my sleep,
not one bit.

949
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,512
It would mine, though.

Why don't you get off that pulpit, Wyatt?

What have they got you but a life full of
misery and a woman who walked out on you...

952
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:11,311
...and the friendship of a killer?

back to your boss.

So that's the way he wants it, huh?

01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:34,292

I had a couple of big brothers.

They fought in the Civil War,
and I was too young to go.

1056
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:28,393

It's not that I wanna be a

01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,649
I don't know,
sometimes I get lonely.

1060

All gunfighters are lonely.

They live in fear.

They die without a dime
or a woman or a friend.

You know, I never thought

01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:47,589
You better get riding.

1071
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:55,514
I wouldn't do that, Ike.

1072
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:59,605
My friends in Tombstone might begin
to worry if I'm not back soon.

That don't cut no ice with me, Wyatt.
You're out of your territory this time.

Am I?

1075
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:10,863
My appointment,
United States marshal.

1076
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:23,462
Sorry to disappoint you.

1077
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:25,798
Now, wait a minute, Wyatt.

1078
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:29,306
I'm not looking for a fight,
but you gotta stop pushing me.

1079
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:32,934
Why don't we sit down and talk it over?
I'll make you any kind of deal you ask.

1080
01:29:32,993 --> 01:29:36,472
The only deal I want is for you to
run that stolen herd back to Mexico.

- I seen him.

1083
01:29:57,434 --> 01:29:58,831
Well?

1084

There's no legal way you can keep a
United States marshal out of the county.

1085
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:06,672
The judge was packing up
to leave when I got there.

1086
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:09,921
I think it's about time we
all pack up and leave, Ike.

1087
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:11,761
Shut up, Frank.

1088
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:14,016
Only one thing we can do.

1089
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:16,678
We didn't have no trouble
till that Wyatt Earp got here.

1090
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:19,394
You're making sense now, Ike.

1091
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,274
All right.

1092
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:24,732
We got no choice.
We'll ambush him tonight.

1093
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:27,313
Ain't you forgetting about
the rest of the Earps?

1094
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:31,201
Now, look, we can handle the Earps
if we make this a personal fight.

1095
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:35,122
- What if they bring in Clum?
- They won't. They're too proud.

1096
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,624
They're gonna come to
us the way we want.

1097
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:41,503
It's a law, bigger than
any law in the books.

1098
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:43,542
Family pride.

1099
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:48,092
We'll get that Wyatt when
he makes his late round.

1100
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:57,302
Don't make no difference to me.

1101
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:07,717
Tired?

1102
01:31:07,743 --> 01:31:10,598
Yeah. I guess I must
have dozed a little.

1103
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:12,154
Betty sent some coffee.

1104
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:14,411
Well, that's gonna hit the spot.

1105

JIMMY: It's awful quiet.

1106
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:23,586
Too quiet.

1107
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:32,804
Wyatt, do you figure we're gonna have
to fight it out with the Clantons?

1108
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:36,558
I wish I knew, Jimmy.

1109
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:39,139
Maybe Ike will see how
hopeless it all is.

1110
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:48,736
You itching to get
back to California?

1111
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:50,897
I think about it all the time.

1112
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:54,905
- She must be quite a girl.
- Yes, she is.

1113
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:57,908
Well...

1114
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,328
...I better get to work.

1115
01:32:01,433 --> 01:32:04,537
Look, how about letting me make
the rounds for you tonight?

1116
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:08,461
I get awful lonesome sitting here
with nothing to do but think.

1117
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:11,547
Sure, you go ahead.
I could use some sleep.

1118
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:15,430
At least when I'm making the rounds,
it gives me something else to think about.

Don't do that, Wyatt.
That's what they want.

up real good, ain't I?

We don't matter, Kate.
