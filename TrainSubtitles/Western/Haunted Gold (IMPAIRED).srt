Oh, this is a surprise.

I would say it is. I did not
know Bill Carter had a daughter.

00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:42,598
And no one ever told me
that Len Mason had a son.

even to start with, doesn't it?

you to Gold City?

I own a half interest
in the mine here and...

over and inspect it.

this to do your inspecting?

- Oh come on now confess.

Did you get a message too?

139
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:24,911
Yes... But I don't
understand it.

for years.

wasn't even signed.

to protect my interests.

Well at lest there's a
reason for your note.

144
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:38,260
But... I can see why
I should get one.

145
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:41,675
See my father lost his share of
the mine long before his death.

146
00:11:42,204 --> 00:11:43,337
Gee, that is odd.

147
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,770
When did you receive
your message?

148
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:48,715
About a week ago.
I just finished school in Denver.

149
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:52,266
The note sounded so mysterious,
well, it seemed like a log.

150
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:57,371
But... now that I am here, there something
uncanny and weird about everything.

151
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,953
This house and the people in it.

152
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:02,977
