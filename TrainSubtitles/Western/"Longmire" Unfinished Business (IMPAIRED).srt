Okay.

...we found the man
that killed your wife.

It took you long enough.

162

Henry, that detective
from Denver's here...

163

...so I think you and I need to talk.
Call me back.

164
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:53,821
Well, a little rusty. That's about
a 20-yard shot with a recurve bow.

165
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,824
Arrow speeds can get up
to about 180 feet per second.

166
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,657
Now, how deep did that arrow
go into that boy?

167
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:04,269
- It went all the way through him. OMAR:
Your killer wasn't shooting a recurve.

168
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,995
Probably a compound bow.

169
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,232
Now, those arrow speeds
can get up to 300 feet per second.

170
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:13,571
VIC: What's with the pulleys?
- Compound bow. Easier to shoot.

171
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,738
- So, uh, how far away was your shooter?
- About 40 yards.

172
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,975
So how good a shot
are we talking about?

173
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,745
OMAR: Well, let's see,
Vickie's never shot before.

174
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,788
That is the second and last time
you will ever call me that.

175
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,115
Here we go, right through there.

176
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,319
That middle target's about 40 yards out.
Let's see how you do.

177
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,088
- See these marks?
- Yeah.

178
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:35,529
OMAR: Those are your aiming pins.
It's got about a 50-pound draw-pull.

179
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,693
- First few inches are tough and then...
- Unh! Now it's like nothing.

180
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,830
OMAR:
When you're ready, release.

181
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,941
Whoa. That's pretty good.

182
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,273
OMAR: That's the great thing
about the compound bow.

183
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,505
The great equalizer.

184
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,674
With a little bit of practice,
even a girl could make that shot.

185
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,946
So you're saying just about anybody
could be our shooter.

186
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,259
Sheriff, uh, Cady called twice.
No message.

187

uh, said you'd know what that was about.

from the Denver P.D. Stopped by.

- Uh, I did. Check this out.

It's Greg's car. A month ago, someone
vandalized it. Recognize that symbol?

Same as on Greg's forehead.

They have any idea who painted that?

194

Well, they're pretty sure
it's Viho Roundstone.

BRANCH: No, but apparently...

Stop it!

Why didn't you just shoot me?

00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:24,390
- He's crazy, sheriff!
- Rich, I can put Jake away.

620
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:25,654
I swear to you.

621
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,458
He can't be charged
for what he did to Ayasha.

00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,399
But I can put him away

If someone uses the threat of violence...

...to make you do something you don't want,
technically, that's kidnapping.

625
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,205
Now, Jake will get his punishment, Rich.

And so will you.

What, are you arresting me?
You can't do this.

RICH:
I'm sorry, sheriff.

630

I'm sorry for everything I've done...

631
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,047
...to Ayasha and Viho.
They're all innocent.

632

It's gonna be okay, Rich.

Thank you, ma'am.

Ah, sheriff, glad you could
finally make it. Have a seat.

Nice job taking those boys in.

Ah... Mm.

00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,494
I ordered you a beer.
You're a Rainier man, right?

Well, you're an interesting man.

- How so?
FALES: After your wife died last year...

651
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,207
...the detective assigned to her case
said you wouldn't leave him alone.

652
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:39,254
You called every day, you gave him
a hard time about not doing his job.

653
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:42,323
He described you as obsessive.

654
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,984
Then after a month, nothing.

655
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,760
And when I tried to contact you
to give you an update...

656
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,898
...nothing.
- Can't dwell in the past.

Then when I accidentally stopped by
your daughter's place...

...she told me she thought her mother
died of cancer.

You never told her about
the stabbing, Walt.

White male, mid 30s, meth-head.

Had a knife. Your wife's DNA
was on the blade, so, you know...

665
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,863
We think he was the one
who did the stabbing.

We found him with a broken neck,
buried in a shallow grave.
