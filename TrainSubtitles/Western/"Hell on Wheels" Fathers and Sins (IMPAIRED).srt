Previously on AMC's Hell On Wheels...

00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,817
You owe me a life

3
00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:07,752
for the one you took from me today.

4
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:11,529
Every one and every thing
that travels by railroad

5
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:14,380
east, west, north, south,
will pass through here.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,941
And stay at my hotel.

7
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:17,897
You reach Cheyenne in 20 days

8
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,721
on time and on budget and I will convince

9
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:22,578
Congress to reinstate you permanently.

10
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:24,724
Aah!

11
00:00:25,961 --> 00:00:27,534
John...

12
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:38,033
Ezra, stop.
Listen.

13
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:41,420
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Don't run away like that.

14
00:00:41,454 --> 00:00:43,088
Ezra!

15
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:44,757
A knife doesn't scare me,

00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,759
- Hold still.

00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:54,183
Yeah.

19
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,556
Think we'll start
with a haircut first.

20
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,592
Mm-hmm.

21
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:00,942
Let's get to it.

22
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,445
Yeah.

23
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,064
A woman like that good
with scissors and a Bible?

24
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:07,866
You ought to marry her up,
Mr. Bohannon,

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,035
before Miss Ruth find her
some other lowlife

26
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,621
fancy belt-wearing huckster
that come along.

27
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,372
You callin' me a fancy lowlife

28
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,707

[Chuckles]

30
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:22,080
Uh, no sir, Mr. Bohannon.

31
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:23,715
All anybody needs to be
concerned with today

32
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:25,584
is making Cheyenne by tomorrow.

33
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:27,836
Yes, sir, Mr. Bohannon.

34
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,392
All right, y'all, listen up!

35
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:38,013
That there dot on the horizon
is Cheyenne!

36
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:41,099
I promised General Grant
hisself...

37
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,436
that we'd make it there
by tomorrow at sunset.

38
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:47,188
It gives us two days
to lay 5 mile of track.

39
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:49,741
Mr. Bohannon,
speaking for the Irish,

40
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:51,660
all due respect, sir,
but tomorrow's Sunday.

41
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,411
It's the lord's day,
not a work day.

42
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,946
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That's right.

43
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:58,366
Even the lord makes
exceptions, Mr. Quinn.

44
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,918
And sacrifices.

45
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:01,786
In fact, the only thing
he don't make

46
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:03,672
is the extra money
I'm gonna put in your pockets

47
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,173
you get us to Cheyenne
on schedule.

48
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:06,174
Yeah, that's true.

49
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,094
This right here...

50
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,379
is the rest of my stock.

51
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:12,881
I'm cashing it in.

52
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:14,466
Spreading it around.
Who wants a piece?

53
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:16,635
All: Yeah.
- I want a piece.

54
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:18,806
Well, I suppose it's no sin
to work on the lord's day.

55
00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:20,438
Long as we don't
make a habit of it.

56
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,973
And my crew
will take a piece of that.

57
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:23,642
Work be our ticket to heaven.

58
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:25,393
We'll ride this train
and that stock

59
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:26,861
all the way to Cheyenne.

60
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,400

hell and back.

a hell of a job.

I'm proud of all of y'all.

He's right there.

Tomorrow, he'll be right here,

You keep leaving that
rather important part out.

Hmm. How did you sleep
last night, Mr. Durant?

85
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:12,801

they cost a fortune.

You sell cattle to Bohannon.

You lend me money
to build <i>our</i> town.

90
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:26,815
You build a hotel
on the best lot in Cheyenne

91
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,318
and charge me
full fare to rent a room.

It's what you and Bohannon
better reach

before he reaches Cheyenne.

To what end?

You promised me
Cheyenne would be

the most important
railroad city in America.

going to accomplish that

without the cooperation
of the railroad?

If I didn't know better,
I'd say he's surrendering.

He knows we're gonna be
in Cheyenne tomorrow

I would say it's for my sins.

I have just enough faith
to condemn me

for the sins I've committed
since I arrived here.

I-it isn't...

with the railroad.
