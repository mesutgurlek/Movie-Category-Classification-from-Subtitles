00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,466
<i>Previously on Wynonna Earp...</i>

2
00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:04,655
- Bobo sent me. Name's Bethany.
- (growling)

3
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:08,537
We're gonna track down the last
of the Seven if it kills me. A spade.

4
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:10,481
- I'm Dr. Reggie.
- She died because

5
00:00:10,506 --> 00:00:12,108
humans can't survive when their

6
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,762
- organs are removed.
- So what?

7
00:00:13,787 --> 00:00:16,065
In the shape of a
spade, like on a deck of cards.

8
00:00:17,546 --> 00:00:20,051
- I'm shutting your division down.
- I have something else.

9
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:22,886
- Never before documented.
- (gunshot)

10
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,255
Any idea why your
homestead was targeted?

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,525
We should at least get
some breakfast. Then we'll talk.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,962
Wynonna!

13
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:33,463
(old-timey music)

14
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:58,421
Devil's hell.

15
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:00,023
(rustling sound)

16
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:08,064
Plus an angel incarnate.

17
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,110
Waverly?

18
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:22,679
Doc?

19
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:31,688
No, no, you're OK. Hey,
lay back. Lay back.

20
00:01:31,723 --> 00:01:34,424
- What happened?
- Deep breaths, Deputy Earp.

21
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:35,926
You remember me?

22
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:39,930
Uh... Dr. Ninja.

23
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:42,057
- Am I in the morgue?
- Thankfully, no.

24
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:43,433
You're in the hospital.

25
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:45,888
Do you remember
anything about the accident?

26
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:47,137
Accident?

27
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:50,473
I was at the homestead...

28
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,943
Zombie strippers.

29
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:56,046
Oh, OK. Some memory loss

30
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:58,148
is totally normal after such a trauma.

31
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:00,617
Where's Waverly? Where's
my sister? Where's Doc?

32
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:03,186
No, no, no. We have to
limit your visitors right now,

33
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:05,221
until...

34
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:07,190
Wynonna,

35
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:10,293
I need you to listen to me.

36
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:13,263
Why can't I move my legs?

37
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:15,231
There's no easy way to
say this. You suffered

38
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:16,792
severe damage to your spinal cord,

39
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:18,535
causing paralysis from the waist down.

40
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,737
(panting frantically)

- Dolls! Dolls!
- Whoa!

49
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:52,102
Hold on, son, now
there's no need for hollering.

50
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:53,903
Wynonna and Officer
Haught, they've been taken.

51
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,605
- What do you mean, taken?
- Abducted,

52
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:58,121
absconded, whatever the hell
you want to call it, they're gone!

53
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:00,076
What do you mean, gone?

54
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:03,346
He's got them, Dolls. The Fiend himself.

55
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:10,687
You don't understand. I love my legs.

56
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:13,023
They're what I walk
on. What are you giving me?

57
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:15,792
- I feel so...
- You feel hungover?

58
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:19,129
You're very lucky, Ms. Earp.
Lucky you didn't kill anyone.

59
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:22,132
I wasn't drunk... anymore.

60
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:25,135
Ask... Nicole.

61
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,570
Nicole was driving. Where's Nicole?

62
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,439
Shh, I have to listen, OK?

63
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:31,374
(shivering)

64
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:35,679
So you're like, a full-on doctor?

65
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:37,714
Morgue duty is just
part of our rotation.

66
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:41,718
I thought I might go to med school.

67
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:45,255
My solid D-minus thought otherwise.

68
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,751
- Where'd you go?
- Queens Undergraduate,

69
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:50,527
Princeton Medical School.

70
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:53,029
And you chose to
practice here? In Purgatory?

71
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,467
- Lucky for me.
- Indeed. I am actually

72
00:03:57,502 --> 00:04:01,671
pioneering a radical new procedure
at this hospital.

73
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:03,751
To increase certain brain functions,

74
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,408
and I guess you could say...

75
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:09,112
shut down others. Certain
areas of emotion

76
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:11,681
cause a patient to be irrational.

77
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:13,616
They can be removed.

78
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,519
One question.

79
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:18,655
Do you only use the cane

80
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,357
as a weapon, or are you hiding
a limp under all that bullshit?

81
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:23,293
Excuse me?

82
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:26,129
Princeton doesn't have a
medical school, dickwad.

83
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:29,566
You're not a doctor, you're
a killer. A revenant.

84
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,838
People think that all it
takes to become a doctor is smarts.

85
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:36,473
No, no, no, no.

86
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:38,975
A real doctor pushes boundaries.

87
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,112
Does things that others
find distasteful for the sake

88
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:46,316
of progress. Take yourself, Wynonna.

89
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:49,953
You've been a very, very bad girl.

90
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:52,222
But it's not your fault, is it?

91
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:55,792
There's something very
wrong, deep inside of you.

92
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:57,827
And the doctor will search

93
00:04:57,863 --> 00:05:00,697
until he finds it, and cut it

94
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:04,200
right out.

95
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:08,738
Off to prep an O.R.

96
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:10,707
Back in a jiff!

97
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:13,643
(whistling)

98
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:19,115
(gasping)

99
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:23,153
(woman): Hello?

100
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,662
Bethany?

101
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,670
I'll call the Feds and I'm gonna make a

102
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,434
discrete request for
additional resources.

103
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,102
- We need boots on the ground.
- No.

104
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:41,171
No, we need choppers in the air

105
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:43,940
and jets and drones and cruise missiles

106
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:46,658
- pointed right at Bobo's head!
- Wasn't Bobo that took 'em.

107
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:48,429
Wasn't the Stone Witch neither.

108
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,079
And your fancy weapons won't do anything

109
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:52,015
against Jack and his knives.

110
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,727
- What kind of man...
- To call him

111
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:55,451
a man would be to speak generously.

112
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:57,720
In Dodge City there was a schoolteacher

113
00:05:57,756 --> 00:05:59,756
name of Sally. She laughed like a mule,

114
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,558
but her eyes did shine.

115
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,526
I was sweet on her,

116
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:05,728
but she went missing. Wyatt and me,

117
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:07,697
we tracked her to a limestone cave

118
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:10,567
in the hills. That's where we found her,

119
00:06:10,602 --> 00:06:13,636
with three other soiled doves

120
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:16,039
that had been thought to have run off.

121
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:19,409
He had taken their insides out.

122
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:21,377
Spread them around their own bodies

123
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:23,643
- like a Thanksgiving feast.
- Oh my god.

124
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:24,814
Papers called him

125
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,666
'the Jack of Knives'
on account of the fact

126
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,510
that's what he called himself in the

127
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:30,154
letters he sent, taunting them.

128
00:06:30,188 --> 00:06:32,789
Adept at all manner of blade.

129
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:34,081
- Great.
- Wyatt and me,

130
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:35,391
we made it our mission

131
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,627
to hunt him down. We tracked him

132
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:40,096
through the Cumberland
pass, nearly freezing to death,

133
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,998
and then I got sick.

134
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,133
Real sick.

135
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:47,604
Wyatt never spoke of
Jack again, but I know

136
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,590
he was the one that
haunted him the most.

137
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:53,643
Well, Wyatt must've got him eventually,
otherwise the creep

138
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:55,566
wouldn't be a revenant. He was a serial

139
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:57,313
killer when he was human. Who knows

140
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:58,603
what he's capable of now?

141
00:06:58,628 --> 00:06:59,983
Or what he's gonna do to Wynonna.

142
00:07:00,018 --> 00:07:02,018
Or Officer Haught.

143
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:08,691
The spade.

144
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:10,093
The spade...

145
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:12,862
once symbolized a sword

146
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,664
- or unsheathed blade...
- Or knife.

147
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,532
He's the last of the Seven.

148
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:18,601
Come on.

149
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:20,157
Whoa, whoa, Waverly. Can't go anywhere

150
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:21,437
with that broken wing of yours.

151
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:22,954
Besides, I need you to
stay here and dig deep,

152
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:25,475
find more on this Jack, alright?

153
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,611
Right. Bring them home safe, OK?

154
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:31,547
Of course. Alright, Holliday,

155
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,395
you said you tracked this
guy before, right?

156
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,684
You think you can do it again?

157
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:36,886
You want my help? I figured...

158
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:38,697
That I'd keep you at arms' length?

159
00:07:38,722 --> 00:07:40,523
Yeah, well, not this time, cowboy.

160
00:07:40,558 --> 00:07:42,191
Come on. Saddle up.

161
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:49,332
We've found her. Officer Haught.

162
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,734
Status?

163
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,803
She's alive. Barely.

164
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:56,172
Motorist spotted her on
the side of the highway.

165
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:58,843
- EMS had to resuscitate on site.
- Damn him.

166
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:01,811
- I'm gonna need access.
- You'll have it. Two conditions.

167
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:03,359
- Alright, name them.
- Doctor says

168
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:04,914
she needs a break, you hightail it.

169
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,694
And when you find the bastard who did

170
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,484
this, you make sure no one else does.

171
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,553
And you.

172
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:14,223
Move your damn horse.

173
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,193
- How long have you been here?
- Couple days.

174
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:19,529
- Maybe a week?
- You had any visitors?

175
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:22,765
- Seen any nurses, orderlies?
- Just Dr. Reggie.

176
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:24,233
He's gonna fix us.

177
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,869
OK, Bethany, we're in serious shit here.

178
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:29,739
It's OK to feel
nervous before a surgery.

179
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:32,241
This isn't a real hospital.

180
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:34,501
- Reggie's not a real doctor.
- He cares about me.

181
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:35,690
You know how long it's been

182
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:37,547
since I could
actually say that about a man?

183
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,007
Park your daddy issues, 'cause

184
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:40,717
it's time to haul ass outta here.

185
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:42,952
If he's not a doctor, he's...

186
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,688
- A serial killer.
- (whimpering)

187
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:48,624
The good news is that you're not sick.

188
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,061
The better news... Bethany.

189
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:54,430
Better news is that we're leaving.

190
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:57,934
OK? I'll need you to get
me a wheelchair, though.

191
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,038
(whistling)

192
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:04,706
- Shit.
- He's coming back.

193
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:07,810
- OK...
- What do I do?

194
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:10,380
Run. Get help.

195
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,051
Go!

196
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:17,954
Bethany, no! Bethany!

197
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:19,989
I'm not like you, Wynonna.

198
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:22,625
- I'm not brave.
- No...

199
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:26,562
(whistling)

200
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:35,805
Time for the doctor to go
to work. (clicking tongue)

201
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:50,086
(whistling)

202
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:55,825

What're you doing?

212
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,952
- Oh God, please don't...
- The doctor is

213
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:39,893
gonna make you feel better, Bethany.

214
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:46,375
- (heartbeat)
- (machine beeping)

215
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:49,145
She won't stabilize. I
can't lose another one!

216
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,647
Come on, come on!

217
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:54,450
(screaming)

218
00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:07,597
(flatline sound)

219
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:16,172
(enraged screaming)

220
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:24,046
It's OK. It's OK.

221
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:26,282
I can fix the next one.

222
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:28,351
I just know I can fix Wynonna.

223
00:11:29,826 --> 00:11:30,779
I know Deputy Earp

224
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,016
is still out there, and we'll
continue the search,

225
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:35,652
- but we agreed my Officer...
- Is our only witness.

226
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:38,689
I need to question her before
her memory becomes more clouded

227
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:40,220
- than it is.
- I'd feel more

228
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:41,992
comfortable with a greenlight

229
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:44,227
- from her doctor.
- Sheriff.

230
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:48,365
I'm good.

231
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,801
- OK? I want to help.
- Well,

232
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:54,004
I'll swing by and make
sure that cat of yours is fed.

233
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:56,640
She doesn't really like men.

234
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,942
Well, who does?

235
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,180
OK. So what was the last thing you saw?

236
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:07,784
Waverly Earp, smiling at
me from her front porch.

237
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,722
And, uh, a man stepping
out on the highway.

238
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:14,057
- Flagging us down.
- Description?

239
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:17,361
No. Just a blank space after that.

240
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:19,696
Until the woods.

241
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:22,232
- What happened?
- Somebody was carrying me.

242
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:25,202
I was blindfolded, I think.

243
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:26,837
Or just really drugged.

244
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,706
Next thing I know I'm freezing cold,

245
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:31,308
covered in dirt in a ditch

246
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:33,977
- the side of the road.
- What about Wynonna?

247
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:36,346
Do you remember anything

248
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:38,315
- about Wynonna?
- No.

249
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,651
- I couldn't see anything.
- Sight ain't your only sense,

250
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:44,588
Ms. Haught.

251
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:49,493
What did he smell like?

252
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:52,781
Close your eyes. Take a deep

253
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:55,732
breath in, let the memories come.

254
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:58,168
Sour.

255
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,453
- Musty.
- Like death?

256
00:13:02,478 --> 00:13:03,206
No.

257
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:06,743
Spoiled fruit. And gasoline.

258
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,711
- He kicked me.
- What?

259
00:13:08,712 --> 00:13:09,800
I couldn't figure out

260
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:12,716
why my chest was hurting. He
threw me down and he said

261
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,118
"You're the wrong kind."

262
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:17,354
You're the wrong
kind. You're the wrong kind.

263
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:19,389
You're the wrong kind. Uh...

264
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:22,893
Serial killers, they, um,
often have a type of victim

265
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,694
that they prefer.

266
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,296
And Wynonna?

267
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:29,266
Must be exactly what Jack's looking for.

268
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:30,967
Waverly, I'm so sorry.

269
00:13:31,003 --> 00:13:34,171
No, it's fine. I'm just glad you're OK.

270
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:44,915
(Dr. Reggie screaming)

271
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:03,567
Come on, toes... move.

272
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:34,664
(sobbing)

273
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:45,775
Now, now. You know she's
tougher than a boiled owl.

274
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:50,180
He's got, like, a shitload of knives.

275
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:52,449
- And she's got us.
- Ahem!

276
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,120
Initial tests came
back from Nicole's uniform.

277
00:14:57,156 --> 00:14:58,989
Traces of ethyl alcohol.

278
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,497
Yeah, the...
gasoline smell she remembered.

279
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:02,626
Common by-product

280
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:05,629
of chemical
manufacture. Like designer drugs.

281
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:09,166
- Certain types of explosives.
- Sour fruit.

282
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,067
- Excuse me?
- Nicole also said

283
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,571
she smelled sour
fruit. As in fermented fruit.

284
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:17,407
- Liquor.
- Ethyl isn't in liquor.

285
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:19,809
Back in my day it
was. Bootleggers used it

286
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:21,876
- to make moonshine.
- Doc, you're a genius!

287
00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:24,147
- Let's not get carried away.
- OK, I think I know where he has her.

288
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:27,017
Right. Late 1930s,

289
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,186
Purgatory gets a new
sewage system. Construction crew

290
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:31,389
hits what they think is a sinkhole.

291
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,884
They actually found a series of tunnels

292
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:34,509
used during
prohibition to smuggle liquor

293
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:37,093
- across the border.
- Prohibition?

294
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:39,671
From 1919 to 1933 the United States

295
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,764
banned the sale, the making

296
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,700
- and consumption of alcohol.
- Lord, I'm almost glad

297
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,902
- I was in the well for that.
- So Jack went from using

298
00:15:45,938 --> 00:15:47,737
caves to using those tunnels.

299
00:15:47,773 --> 00:15:50,774
- Does this map give their location?
- No, unfortunately.

300
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:53,610
The town just sealed them
up. But I think I have an idea

301
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:55,378
who might know where they are.

302
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:58,481
OK, 1884, Wyatt killed

303
00:15:58,517 --> 00:16:00,642
a corrupt saloon
owner named James Byers.

304
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:01,451
James Byers.

305
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:03,309
Same name appears again

306
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:06,456
in 1925 in connection with
a rumored liquor run.

307
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:08,558
It could be two guys or...

308
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,728
- Or a revenant.
- Aw, hell.

309
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,097
(chuckling)

310
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:16,633
- Let me guess. You knew him?
- I know him.

311
00:16:16,668 --> 00:16:18,568
Runs an operation in town.

312
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:21,039
What kind of
operation are we talking about?

313
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:21,972
The best kind,

314
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:24,874
- highly illegal.
- (crowd cheering)

315
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,544
(barking)

316
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:30,313
There are two rules to this,

317
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:32,282
- Mr. Dolls.
- Let me guess.

318
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:35,316
First rule of fight club,
never talk about fight club, right?

319
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:37,040
Nobody talks about
it, how're fellas gonna

320
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,722
know where it is? No, the first rule is,

321
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:41,458
You never, ever bring the law.

322
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:44,294
- And what's the second rule?
- Wait here. Boss is comin'.

323
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:47,430
- Oh...
- (crowd and flinching)

324
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,733
- (cracking)
- Ooh!

325
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:54,137
What d'you think, human or revenant?
Kinda hard to tell.

326
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:57,181
Well, Whiskey Jim
likes to mix it up. 'Course,

327
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,272
the humans have no idea they're

328
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:00,033
stepping into the ring with a demon.

329
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:01,645
Adds a bit of whimsy

330
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,015
to your typical
pugilistic festivities, no?

331
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,484
Look who the cat dragged in.

332
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,987
Whiskey Jim.

333
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:12,956
Doc Holliday.

334
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:15,859
You being here means one of two things.

335
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:17,827
Either you got my 10K,

336
00:17:17,863 --> 00:17:20,764
- or you got a death wish.
- Of course,

337
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,366
you owe him money. (chuckling)

338
00:17:23,402 --> 00:17:26,670
- Did I forget to mention that?
- Listen,

339
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:29,606
this idiot doesn't have what
he owes you, but my division does.

340
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:32,275
All in exchange for some information.
Is there a place

341
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:35,812
- we can talk, Whiskey Jimmy?
- Bloody Black Badge?

342
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:39,316
Rule number one, moron.

343
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:42,285
(crowd cheering)

344
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,827
Yo. What up, Doctor Murder?

345
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,796
How are you feeling?

346
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:56,833
Floaty. These drugs are
hella dope. And coming from me,

347
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:59,969
- that's saying something.
- I need to ask you some questions

348
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:02,505
- about your personal history.
- Cut the bullshit.

349
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,407
I know who you are.

350
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:06,937
The last of the Seven. Which
means I'm sure as shit

351
00:18:07,048 --> 00:18:08,870
- not telling you anything.
- You're awfully

352
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:10,321
mouthy for a girl who just found out

353
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,952
- she's paralyzed.
- Bethany hasn't come back.

354
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:13,375
I'm just scared, OK?

355
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:15,185
That's why it's
important to have a healthy

356
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,754
and open patient-doctor dialogue.

357
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:25,495
So tell me, Wynonna...

358
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,765
- Can you feel this?
- (cracking)

359
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:32,702
Nope.

360
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:34,738
You could be giving me a pedicure.

361
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:46,100
Good. Still,

362
00:18:46,136 --> 00:18:49,671
we should up your meds.

363
00:18:49,706 --> 00:18:53,641
The doctor just wants to understand
you. Don't you want

364
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:57,011
- to be understood?
- I want to be on a beach in Hawaii

365
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:59,314
with two very
impressionable cabana boys.

366
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:03,651
Always with the
jokes. Tell me, Wynonna...

367
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:05,853
What happened after you
killed your own father?

368
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:08,956
I was committed. Put under
the care of a 'specialist'.

369
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:11,526
Every time I told the
truth, I got a nice jolt

370
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:13,161
of electric juice.

371
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:16,297
- Was the shock therapy effective?
- Yeah.

372
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,701
Made me good at poker and now I
don't have to shave my left leg.

373
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:22,270
You use humor as a form of self-defence.

374
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,974
I prefer my Buntline special.
What'd you do with Peacemaker?

375
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,878
Get a good grip on it?

376
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:32,413
Stings a little, don't it, Revenant?

377
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:45,624
- Hey, that's mine.
- What is it doing over here?

378
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,115
You must've snagged it on something

379
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,730
when you wheeled me in. Give it back.

380
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:50,832
Answer my questions

381
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:53,668
- without any more guff.
- And you won't cut me open?

382
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:57,105
Wynonna, we have to do the surgery.

383
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,241
- For your own good.
- To fix me, yeah. Did you fix Bethany?

384
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:02,308
The doctor has ensured that
she's in no more pain.

385
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,688
What is with psychos and talking
in the third person?

386
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:06,748
I'm not psycho!

387
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,816
Fine, you're not
psycho. You're not psycho.

388
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:11,085
You're delightful. Top notch.

389
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:13,028
I'll answer whatever, OK?

390
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:16,357
Just put my necklace back on me, please.

391
00:20:25,664 --> 00:20:28,002
On second thought, you're
not really in a position

392
00:20:28,037 --> 00:20:30,938
to do any bargaining, are you?

393
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:40,415
OK, look, we just need the entrance

394
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,450
to your old
bootlegging tunnels, that's it.

395
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:45,486
Let's say I was willing
to help you. And I ain't.

396
00:20:45,522 --> 00:20:48,863
Those tunnels are of no
use to you or anyone.

397
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:51,125
They were boarded up a long time ago.

398
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:53,661
- Nobody knows how to find them.
- Well, somebody does.

399
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:55,696
That 'someone'

400
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:58,099
has a very sharp
blade and Bobo's backin'.

401
00:20:58,134 --> 00:21:02,336
- Ain't got nothin' to do with me.
- Look, just tell us where they are

402
00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:05,206
and we'll be on our
way, alright, Whiskey?

403
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:10,344
This is my place.

404
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,313
(deep voice): I do the asking.

405
00:21:12,348 --> 00:21:15,783
And you owe me plenty.

406
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:18,186
Look, we are all businessmen here.

407
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:20,154
Can't we come to some
sort of arrangement?

408
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,857
Hmm...

409
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:27,487
You do look like you
can handle yourself.

410
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:31,766
Yeah, I do alright.

411
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:34,268
(laughing)

412
00:21:36,105 --> 00:21:38,039
Alright. You want my help?

413
00:21:38,074 --> 00:21:41,142
You two need to earn it. Here,

414
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:43,344
now.

415
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:45,379
In the ring.

416
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:48,115
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You
really want me to fight him?

417
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:49,741
- What, you yella?
- No, I'm being

418
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,786
realistic, and let's
be real, you won't get

419
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:54,088
- your money's worth.
- Oh, I'll take that bet.

420
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:56,057
- Shut up.
- Whatever.

421
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:58,092
Just make sure there's blood.

422
00:21:58,127 --> 00:22:00,394
Lots of it. One of you

423
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,130
leaves on a stretcher, or neither
of you leaves at all.

424
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,199
You give me that?

425
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:08,069
I'll tell you where my tunnels are.

426
00:22:08,104 --> 00:22:09,737
Rule number two,

427
00:22:09,772 --> 00:22:13,407
don't come if you
ain't willing to fight.

428
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:28,055
Wynonna!

429
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:31,459
Wynonna!

430
00:22:44,474 --> 00:22:48,142
This fella's been looking for
a chance to give you this.

431
00:22:48,177 --> 00:22:50,611
Boss man sent him.

432
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:52,780
I guess Bobo wants
you alive for something.

Alright, let's go!

Come on!

443
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:34,855
- That's enough. It's showtime.
- Alright.

OK, look, we're running out of time.

445

Let's just give this guy what he wants.

446
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:44,532
- We should make it look real.
- Who says it ain't?

- Heh, heh!

I see you've found my missing scalpel.

452
00:24:12,996 --> 00:24:14,593
Know how to make someone show you

453
00:24:14,618 --> 00:24:16,330
where something precious is hidden?

454
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:19,033
Set fire to their house.

455
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:21,502
It's the first thing they go for.

456

Wynonna, don't be rash.

You'll never find Officer
Haught without me.

New deal, Reggimite.

459

Tell me where she is, and I'll make

460

your trip back to hell an express.

461
00:24:32,915 --> 00:24:35,616
Screw around, and I will have some fun

No need to say sorry, Reginald.

00:26:37,173 --> 00:26:39,173
(grunting)

484
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:41,475
You wanna poke and prod me for science?

485
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:43,511
You wanna put me back in a cage?

486
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:45,513
You are a dirty,

487
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:47,848
two-faced son of a bitch liar.

488
00:26:47,884 --> 00:26:50,718
(crowd): Ohh!

489
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:57,258
What're you waiting
for!? Get up! One of you two

490
00:26:57,293 --> 00:27:00,161
needs to eat this
mat, or this deal's off!

491
00:27:00,196 --> 00:27:02,863
Wynonna will never forgive you

492
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:04,732
if you hand me over to the authorities.

493
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,703
You didn't help her when it mattered.

494
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:12,339
She's with Jack because of you.

495
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,577
No wonder why Wyatt left you to die.

496
00:27:26,756 --> 00:27:29,723
(crowd cheering)

497
00:27:31,661 --> 00:27:34,028
Winner!

498
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:42,970
Ohh! You sir did give me

499
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:46,207
one hell of a show. You killed him!

500
00:27:54,231 --> 00:27:56,098
We'll deal with his corpse.

501
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,300
Much obliged.

502
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,903
Now, I expect Black
Badge will be snooping around,

503
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:02,905
asking about their missing agent.

504
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,141
- I'd make myself scarce, ASAP.
- The entrance to the tunnels.

505
00:28:06,177 --> 00:28:08,177
Now, I promised him that information.

506
00:28:08,212 --> 00:28:10,613
- Him's dead...
- Now, goddammit!

507
00:28:13,084 --> 00:28:16,952
(laughing)

508
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:20,189
Well, you did give me
one helluva good show!

509
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,560
That file Dolls had was classified.

510
00:28:24,595 --> 00:28:26,795
- How'd Bobo get it?
- We revenants

511
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,098
are trapped inside the
Ghost River Triangle.

512
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:32,768
But Bobo, his reach extends
far beyond that.

513
00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:35,604
He's got friends in
high places, that one.

514
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:39,375
Oh, oh, oh!

515
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,277
I, uh,

516
00:28:41,312 --> 00:28:43,245
got these off your dead friend.

517
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:46,015
Don't think he'll be
needing them anymore.

518
00:28:56,093 --> 00:28:58,327
(whistling)

519
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,267
You needed a human to
handle Peacemaker for you.

520
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:07,469
(whistling)

521
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,349
Somebody lost their head.

522
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,267
(horn honking)

523
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:47,710
- Jesus H. Christ!
- Nope.

524
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:51,046
You weren't leaving without me, were ya?

525
00:29:54,852 --> 00:29:56,018
Never touch my stuff.

526
00:30:02,627 --> 00:30:07,029
(whistling)

527
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:13,936
Your nose is bleeding.

528
00:30:13,971 --> 00:30:15,971
Got a tampon?

529
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:17,973
Or, you know,

530
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:19,742
an inkling to get me to a real hospital?

531
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:22,111
Wyatt's nose bled like
that when I first met him.

532
00:30:22,146 --> 00:30:25,447
I've been studying you for a long while.

533
00:30:25,483 --> 00:30:27,416
We are so alike.

534
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,318
- Insane?
- No.

535
00:30:29,353 --> 00:30:31,037
You work with a team, not because you

536
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,588
want to, but because you have to.

537
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:36,125
Like me. And you prefer to hunt alone.

538
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,526
Like me.

539
00:30:40,498 --> 00:30:42,498
This is a trick that Reginald taught me.

540
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,500
Surgeons today

541
00:30:44,535 --> 00:30:46,298
like to draw a map on their patients

542
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:47,870
for where they're going to cut.

543
00:30:47,905 --> 00:30:51,273
- Any chance this surgery is elective?
- It's mandatory, I'm afraid.

544
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,943
Thought doctors had to
take an oath to do no harm.

545
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:58,180
I've never really been a doctor.

546
00:30:58,215 --> 00:30:59,948
But I did study surgery.

547
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:03,318
And by study, I mean, I
love to cut open bodies.

548
00:31:03,354 --> 00:31:05,187
I like to see what
makes people... people.

549
00:31:05,222 --> 00:31:07,523
See, even when I was human,

550
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:09,491
I wasn't.

551
00:31:09,527 --> 00:31:11,593
Not way down deep.
- I owe Reggie

552
00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:13,896
an apology. You're the
sickest puppy in the litter.

553
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:16,832
- Flattery's not gonna save you.
- What is your damage?

554
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:19,535
- Mommy didn't love you enough?
- (giggling)

555
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,810
Or is this because every
woman you ever met rejected you?

556
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,873
Maybe.

557
00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:27,743
Your dime-store psychology

558
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:30,212
is adorable, Wynonna.

559
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:32,181
I love women.

560
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:34,717
Can't you tell?

561
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:37,853
Feast for the eyes. And every man

562
00:31:37,888 --> 00:31:39,888
has a favorite body part

563
00:31:39,924 --> 00:31:41,890
upon which to gaze.

564
00:31:41,926 --> 00:31:44,526
(whispering): I love to
look at your organs.

565
00:31:44,562 --> 00:31:46,729
And I'm gonna keep you alive

566
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:49,398
just long enough

567
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:51,433
that you can look at them too.

568
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:58,348
You dead, and now you are nuts.

569
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,927
Oh, how the tables and have turned.

570
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:05,565
Army Night Rangers. Elite
paramilitary unit.

571
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,868
They train us in how to lower our
pulse, control our breathing.

572
00:32:08,904 --> 00:32:11,771
- Make the enemy think you're dead.
- Oh, aren't you

573
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,791
- the master of deception.
- Here we go.

574
00:32:13,816 --> 00:32:14,707
If your bosses

575
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:16,876
have no compunction about
turning a person

576
00:32:16,912 --> 00:32:19,412
into a pin cushion, how are
they better than the demons?

577
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:22,115
Your body is a
treasure trove for science.

578
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,083
Think about what the
military could do with soldiers

579
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,953
who didn't get sick, didn't age?

580
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:29,155
It was a decision made for
the good of the many.

581
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,958
I get to choose who I share
my treasure trove with,

582
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,927
not the goddamn government.

583
00:32:33,962 --> 00:32:35,828
If Wynonna

584
00:32:35,864 --> 00:32:38,498
wasn't in danger, I
would shoot you right now.

585
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,226
Yeah. If Wynonna wasn't in danger,

586
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:41,968
you would be in the back of a van.

587
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,670
Hey, hey, hey! Watch it!

588
00:32:43,705 --> 00:32:45,687
Ooh! Easy now.

589
00:32:45,873 --> 00:32:50,843
I'm just gettin' ready.
But once Wynonna is safe...

590
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:53,346
Yeah. Once Wynonna's safe.

591
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:56,916
Now.

592
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,487
How the hell do we get in there?

593
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:04,357
Reginald always used antiseptic

594
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:06,392
because he thought that there
was a chance that the patients

595
00:33:06,428 --> 00:33:08,361
would survive the procedure, but...

596
00:33:08,396 --> 00:33:10,563
let's not kid ourselves.

597
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,000
You're not gonna survive this.

598
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:16,603
Now...

599
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:19,906
only the best for the heir.

600
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:21,874
Wait!

601
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:24,877
Before I die, just tell me.

602
00:33:24,913 --> 00:33:27,680
- Tell you what?
- Why.

603
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:28,965
Why send the posse of seven?

604
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,430
If Bobo really wanted my daddy dead,

605
00:33:30,452 --> 00:33:32,385
- he could've done it himself.
- Don't forget,

606
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,321
it wasn't the posse that
killed dear old Ward.

607
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:37,790
It was a scared and
confused little girl.

608
00:33:37,826 --> 00:33:41,394
- It was an accident.
- I know, I was there.

609
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:44,163
I know you're not gonna believe this,
but I really liked your father.

610
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:46,466
He wasn't like the other Earp heirs.

611
00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:49,669
He wasn't ambitious like Edwin,

612
00:33:49,704 --> 00:33:51,704
or courageous like Josiah,

613
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,840
but he had something
that they didn't have.

614
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,808
Wits.

615
00:33:55,844 --> 00:33:57,877
When Ward started his little ride,

616
00:33:57,912 --> 00:34:00,847
he realized that in order to survive,

617
00:34:00,882 --> 00:34:02,882
he was gonna have to
make certain alliances.

618
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,485
- With who? Black Badge?
- Don't be daft.

619
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,087
He made a pact with the big man himself.

620
00:34:08,123 --> 00:34:10,123
Bobo Del Rey.

621
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:15,995
No. My daddy would never make a deal

622
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:19,532
- with a demon. Never.
- They were very close friends.

623
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:22,402
(scoffing) Liar.

624
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:26,272
I'm sorry, Wynonna, that
I break your heart.

625
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:29,275
Now I'm going to cut it out.

626
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,678
No! No!

627
00:34:31,713 --> 00:34:34,013
(gunshot)

628
00:34:34,049 --> 00:34:36,303
- Took you long enough.
- You're welcome.

629
00:34:36,328 --> 00:34:37,216
Doc Holliday.

630
00:34:37,252 --> 00:34:39,519
I always hoped that I'd
have this pleasure.

631
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,930
Where did you get the
Stone Witch's trinket?

632
00:34:56,004 --> 00:34:58,071
Normally I just carve up women,

633
00:34:58,106 --> 00:35:00,406
but, Doctor, in your case I'm
gonna make an exception.

634
00:35:00,442 --> 00:35:03,843
Looks like it's just
me and you, Jackie Boy.

635
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,535
- Go! Go get it.
- Peacemaker?

636
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,260
Yeah.

637
00:35:21,296 --> 00:35:22,962
It's across the hall. Whisky barrels.

638
00:35:22,997 --> 00:35:25,698
Quick! OK.

639
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,192
Did I get him?

640
00:35:53,228 --> 00:35:54,794
Not your job.

641
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:57,330
Oh!

642
00:35:57,365 --> 00:35:59,599
It just got a little wet.

643
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:03,469
Mmm. Oak-aged.

644
00:36:03,505 --> 00:36:06,706
Thank you. Don't kill each other.

645
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:10,343
Alright...

646
00:36:12,447 --> 00:36:14,213
- So.
- Yep.

647
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:17,416
- Good talk.
- Oh, we are done talkin'.

648
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:23,703
I think this would be a
good juncture to remind you

649
00:36:23,704 --> 00:36:27,755
that I am the fastest
gunslinger that ever walked the earth.

650
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,824
Hm. Debatable. What about Billy the Kid?

651
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:31,792
Ooh, I should shoot you right now,

652
00:36:31,828 --> 00:36:34,428
just for being such an
obstreperous jackass.

653
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:37,098
So go ahead. Take me out.

654
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:40,028
Just know they've got satellites.
Predator drones.

655
00:36:40,153 --> 00:36:41,554
You look like you just came out of the

656
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,171
Grand Ole Opry, so
they will find you, Doc.

657
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:45,973
And you, sir, are an asshole.

658
00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:48,442
But you are not a villain.

659
00:36:48,478 --> 00:36:50,912
So why, Dolls?

660
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:56,017
It was you. Or her.

661
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:01,589
I see.

662
00:37:03,593 --> 00:37:06,360
D'you know what Wyatt used
to say? He used to say,

663
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:09,664
'Doc, well, if you stand for nothing,

664
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:12,200
you are sure to fall.'

665
00:37:12,235 --> 00:37:13,868
What was I supposed to do?

666
00:37:13,903 --> 00:37:16,971
You do what you do best, Deputy
Marshal Dolls, you fight.

667
00:37:21,377 --> 00:37:23,377
OK.

668
00:37:28,851 --> 00:37:32,320
Well, that was easy.

669
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:51,439
(grunting and wheezing)

670
00:38:08,124 --> 00:38:11,926
Just think about it. Think about it.

671
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:13,861
Think about it.

672
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:15,930
I'm the last of the Seven.

673
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:19,133
What happens when you kill me?

674
00:38:19,168 --> 00:38:21,535
Order too much Thai

675
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:23,904
and open a bottle of wine?

676
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,940
Once I'm gone,

677
00:38:25,975 --> 00:38:28,542
you'll have to deal with
the puppet master.

678
00:38:28,578 --> 00:38:31,302
And Bobo Del Rey

679
00:38:31,498 --> 00:38:34,436
makes the rest of us
look like choir boys.

680
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:35,416
Yeah.

681
00:38:35,451 --> 00:38:38,719
But he'll still make the
same pathetic hissing sound

682
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:42,056
- when I shoot him between the eyes.
- You're talking tough,

683
00:38:42,091 --> 00:38:45,593
but you're just like me. You're broken.

684
00:38:45,628 --> 00:38:48,829
I can hear the fear in your voice.

685
00:38:48,865 --> 00:38:52,366
- (gun cocking)
- (Jack laughing)

686
00:38:55,204 --> 00:38:58,172
Oh, I wish I could stay!

687
00:39:00,176 --> 00:39:02,510
Watch what's coming next.

688
00:39:02,545 --> 00:39:04,578
A reunion...

689
00:39:04,614 --> 00:39:06,647
an escape.

690
00:39:06,683 --> 00:39:08,716
So much blood.

691
00:39:08,751 --> 00:39:10,951
You attacked my home

692
00:39:10,987 --> 00:39:14,155
and killed my sister.

693
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,291
- Now make your peace.
- What's the hurry, little girl?

694
00:39:17,327 --> 00:39:20,828
Enjoy the moment.

695
00:39:20,863 --> 00:39:22,663
- Savor the kill.
- Who's this,

696
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:25,032
you do impressions now?
Who is that, Judi Dench?

697
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:27,568
You've solved a great mystery.

698
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:29,637
Succeeded where Scotland Yard failed,

699
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:31,909
and all

700
00:39:32,016 --> 00:39:34,275
by your lonesome.

701
00:39:36,512 --> 00:39:38,713
I ain't interested.

702
00:39:38,748 --> 00:39:41,849
And I'm not lonesome.

703
00:39:41,884 --> 00:39:45,586
I just prefer to hunt alone.

704
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,033

You have to let go sometime, Waves.

707
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:50,985
Maybe tomorrow.

708
00:40:57,627 --> 00:40:59,627
Well,

709
00:40:59,662 --> 00:41:01,796
just like that, the Seven are gone.

710
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:04,732
Just like that, huh?

711
00:41:07,003 --> 00:41:09,303
So what now?

712
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:14,341
Wynonna?

713
00:41:23,986 --> 00:41:25,508
You stand by this report?

714
00:41:25,643 --> 00:41:27,590
That your Deputy possibly dispatched

715
00:41:27,591 --> 00:41:29,757
the most notorious serial
killer in history?

716
00:41:29,898 --> 00:41:32,126
I said possibly. There's no way
to prove it without a body.

717
00:41:32,161 --> 00:41:35,362
How convenient. Where's my delivery?

718
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:39,009
Oh yeah. I will be formally withdrawing
the report I filed

719
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,723
on the alleged target. Henry is nothing

720
00:41:40,724 --> 00:41:43,070
but a con artist. A good one, but...

721
00:41:43,105 --> 00:41:45,506
- the real Doc Holliday is dead.
- You continue

722
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:46,807
to disappoint me.

723
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:58,115
As long as I keep surprising you.

724
00:41:58,487 --> 00:42:01,088
Always.
