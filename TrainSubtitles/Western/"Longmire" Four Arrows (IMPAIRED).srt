00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:10,605
pulls out all the luggage on
the ground, and then skedaddles.

164
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:12,774
He's an ugly mutt.

165
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,174
Randolph Hale.

166
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:16,510
These charters don't care
who they hire anymore.

167
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,696
My bet... There's a record on him.

168
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:21,866
Probably afraid of getting
arrested, heads for the tall grass.

169
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,808
Lucian, we appreciate your help.

170
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,035
We got it from here.

171
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:29,206
Well, if I'm off work...
Ferg! I'm devoid of a drink!

172
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,358
Where's my drink? Give me my drink!

173
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,752
Whoo!

174
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,963
Off the road, off the road, off the road!

175
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:38,341
Stay off the road!

176
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:40,992
I filed a report with your boss.

177
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:44,663
Insurance better cover this because
that maniac almost took off our fender.

178
00:11:44,664 --> 00:11:46,749
There's a service station
three miles up the road.

179
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,751
Get them to check it
before you head out of town.

180
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:50,210
Yeah. We're gonna go to the casino.

181
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:53,857
Um, I've been the designated driver
for two days, and I need a drink, so...

182
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:24,929
[sighs]

183
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,315
What you got there?

184
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,195
[Vic] Oh, Jesus.

185
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:53,999
Ferg, put out an APB on that
bus driver... Randolph Hale.

186
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,627
He can't have got far, even if he hitched.

187
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,255
Late teens, early 20s.

188
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,428
There's no I.D. or wallet that I can see.

189
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:10,099
Vic, get this girl to the
morgue, find out who she is.

190
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:16,021
I'm going to the casino to have
a word with... Archer Loftus,

191
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:19,483
who seems to have misplaced his luggage.

192
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,510
I'll go with Vic, then?

193
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:23,362
She can't carry that bag by herself.

194
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:30,620
[sighs]

195
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:48,471
- [drumbeats]
- [indistinct conversations]

196
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:29,094
Henry.

197
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:31,931
What are you doing here?

198
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:36,251
My new boss, Malachi, generously
offered my catering services.

199
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:37,812
What is your excuse?

200
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,856
I'm here on business.

201
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:44,777
I hoped this day would never
come, for Martha's sake.

202
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:47,655
It is what it is.

203
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:54,078
[horn honks]

204
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,377
[indistinct conversations]

205
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,710
Put it on my bill. [laughs]

206
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:21,064
Hey, I'm gonna have to
catch up with you later.

207
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,089
Good talking to you.

208
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,483
Nice meeting you.

209
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,470
Wow.

210
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:30,489
You just couldn't stay away, huh?

211
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,743
What is it now? You want to
check the smoke detectors?

212
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,978
I'm not here to make trouble.

213
00:15:35,979 --> 00:15:38,647
I just need to talk to one of your guests.

214
00:15:38,648 --> 00:15:40,774
Archer Loftus.

215
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:42,692
Came in on the charter
bus about an hour ago.

216
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,545
I was hoping you could help me find him.

217
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:49,491
You know, I'm not doing a
damn thing for you, my man,

218
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:51,343
not until you give me something.

219
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,720
What's that?

220
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:54,388
An apology.

221
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:55,431
You're kidding.

222
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:59,268
Shall I call Malachi and
have you escorted out of here?

223
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:07,759
I'm sorry that my deeply held belief

224
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,889
that you are a dishonorable,
untrustworthy person

225
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,410
led me to falsely accuse you
of killing Branch Connally.

226
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,914
And your wife.

227
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:23,316
And my wife.

228
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,502
I now know it was Barlow.

229
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:28,864
The rich, white man turns
out to be the bad guy.

230
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:30,800
What a shock, eh?

231
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,386
Now will you help me?

232
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:38,641
Let's go to my office.

233
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:45,797
For the record, Walt, that was the
worst apology I've ever received.

234
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,131
- It was honest.
- Yeah.

235
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,758
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

236
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,887
Barlow is still screwing
me from beyond the grave.

237
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:53,722
- I thought he was your partner.
- He was.

238
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:55,431
But with his money tied up in probate,

239
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,767
I can't complete construction of the hotel.

240
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:00,395
I need the revenue from
this casino more than ever.

241
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:02,605
- Do you understand me?
- I think so.

242
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:03,815
Well, let me make it clear.

243
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:05,483
If I allow you to question my patrons,

244
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:08,028
anything you learn is
kept inside your office,

245
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:10,947
away from the public
and especially the press.

246
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,615
Can't afford to have people scared off,

247
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:15,035
thinking this place
attracts criminal activity.

248
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:16,285
You have my word.

249
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,997
Well, if Loftus has checked in to
the completed wing of the hotel,

250
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:20,164
I'll have him brought here.

251
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:25,395
It's been my experience that free chips
and a meal voucher add a little incentive.

252
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,481
Thank you, Jacob.

253
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,215
Don't thank me.

254
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,068
I'm not paying for it.

255
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:48,151
Cade Tall Grass, yes?

256
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:49,378
Yeah.

257
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:53,257
What are you doing out
here all by yourself?

258
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,119
I had to get some things.

259
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,637
My mom's sick.

260
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:01,497
Your dad was not around to take you?

261
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,350
[Cade] He took the car to work.

262
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:07,730
[Henry] It is a long walk.

263
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,315
Hop in. Let me give you a ride.

264
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,337
[Walt] Archer Loftus.

265
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,091
This is you, right?

266
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:38,928
Yeah, that's me. Why?

267
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:41,871
You came in on the charter bus from Oden?

268
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:42,806
Yep.

269
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:45,041
Work on the oil rigs over there.

270
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,418
Couple days' leave, came here.

271
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,021
So, when do I get my chips?

272
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:52,816
You own a black duffel bag, Mr. Loftus?

273
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:56,737
No. A red Samsonite upstairs in my room.

274
00:18:56,804 --> 00:19:02,017
A woman's body was found in a black
duffel bag with this tag on it.

275
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:03,786
You're saying it isn't yours?

276
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:05,662
A woman's body?

277
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:08,498
You mean like a dead woman?

278
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,502
With my name on it?

279
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:16,465
Holy hell.

280
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:17,674
Oh!

281
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:21,137
I knew it! This whole trip was a setup!

282
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:24,455
"You've been doing such good work, Archer.

283
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:28,459
We want to reward you for
your loyalty to the company.

284
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,505
We'll give you a bus ticket and some
chips and a dead woman's body in a bag,

285
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,358
get rid of your ass once and for all."

286
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,609
Settle down, Mr. Loftus.

287
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:39,322
I've called OSHA half a dozen
times on this company's ass.

288
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:42,098
They got us wildcatting out there.

289
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:44,743
Long hours, skipping breaks,
no rest for the hands.

290
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,038
That's because the company only
gets paid when the kelly's turning.

291
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:53,543
How do you know that?

292
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,364
Oh, I spent a few years working
rigs, mostly roughnecking in Alaska.

293
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,800
Prudhoe Bay.

294
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:03,137
Then you know when time
is money, men get hurt.

295
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:04,954
Five in the last eight months.

296
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:08,475
You think someone at the oil company
is trying to frame you, Mr. Loftus?

297
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,436
Would I put my own return
address on a dead body?

298
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,022
Who else would?

299
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:14,731
[exhales]

300
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:20,696
Must be 20 men on that bus happily
take a grand to screw me over.

301
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,895
Loose tooth?

302
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:32,398
If I can get it out, I'll
get a dollar under my pillow.

303
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:35,836
In my day, the tooth
fairy left only a quarter.

304
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,653
Well, your mom was cheap.

305
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,548
I know who the tooth fairy is.

306
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,052
You are a sharp young man.

307
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,786
[Cade] You can drop me here.

308
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:48,140
My dad doesn't like visitors,
especially when Mom's sick.

309
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,151
I hope your mom gets well soon, Cade.

310
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:30,807
Any word on the missing bus driver?

311
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,376
No, not yet. But Lucian was right.

312
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:36,629
Randolph Hale has a warrant out...
failure to pay child support.

313
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,631
[Walt] Any credit-card activity?

314
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:41,176
No, but, you know, since
the guy is a driver by trade,

315
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:45,138
I put a call out on the CB to check
to see if any truckers spot him.

316
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:46,949
Did you find the guy with the duffel?

317
00:21:47,016 --> 00:21:48,850
Well, he says he's being framed.

318
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:51,995
Uh, how's Vic coming
with the I.D. of the girl?

319
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,914
She's still at the coroner's with Eamonn.

320
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:59,628
What do you think of, uh, Deputy O'Neill?

And I'm freezing my ass off.

482
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:48,657
Your deputy wouldn't let me
go back and get my clothes.

483
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:51,475
I went back. Somebody swiped them.

484
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:52,702
I'm sorry to hear that.

485
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:57,332
Ferg, why don't you go to my office
and get Mr. Hale a fleece jacket?

486
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,668
I think I have one in my black duffel bag.

487
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:02,253
Sure thing.

488
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:11,763
So, uh, do you know why we
brought you in, Mr. Hale?

489
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,790
Yeah. Because my damn
ex-wife's a bloodsucker.

490
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:17,000
I told her, as soon as
I'm paid, she's paid.

491
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:18,520
I get my check next week.

492
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:21,213
I'm not so sure.

493
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:22,774
You fled the scene of an accident.

494
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:24,049
[sighs]

495
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,134
Damn it.

496
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:28,738
I only ran because I
knew this would happen.

497
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:33,869
It ain't easy for a man my age out there.

498
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:37,897
Let... Let me... Let me
just set the record straight.

499
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:39,708
I didn't run out on my family.

500
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:41,400
My wife, she kicked me out.

501
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:42,919
Now the boyfriend, he's moving in,

502
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:46,589
but she still wants her check
the 15th of every damn month.

503
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:53,137
Know what? Women, they look at
you, all they see is a meal ticket.

504
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:01,688
How long you been working
for the bus company, Mr. Hale?

505
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,672
Little over a year.

506
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:05,507
[Walt] You load all the bags?

507
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:07,610
Yeah. Every single one of them.

508
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:09,428
Oh.

509
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:13,474
That's a lot of people and a
lot of luggage to keep track of.

510
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:16,327
You remember all those
folks and who brings on what?

511
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:19,330
In my line of work, you just
remember the jerks and the heavy bags.

512
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:23,126
- What do you consider heavy?
- I don't know, 50, 60 pounds?

513
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,047
You remember this bag?

514
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,924
I told you. I only remember the heavy ones.

515
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:32,844
Well, this was a lot
heavier before we emptied it.

516
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:35,454
What do you think it weighed, Ferg?

517
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:36,765
120 pounds.

518
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:38,791
120 pounds.

519
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,227
I can't lift 120 pounds. I'm on disability.

520
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:44,106
What was in it?

521
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:49,402
You recognize her?

522
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,490
I-I ain't never seen her or
that bag before in my life.

523
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:58,560
And yet another person on your bus

524
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:02,373
remembers an attractive,
young woman with dark hair.

525
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:06,128
- And that bag was on your bus.
- [telephone rings]

526
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:09,464
You loaded every bag.

527
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:15,804
I guess now you're wishing we were holding
you for skipped child-support payments.

528
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:18,205
Walt.

529
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:20,224
Jacob Nighthorse for you.

530
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:23,711
Yeah?

531
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:27,089
So, is this your idea of keeping
Four Arrows out of the press

532
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,817
and away from bad publicity?

533
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:30,526
What are you talking about?

534
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:33,947
Turn on Channel 11. Or 2 or 7.

535
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:38,517
They're all reporting that a murdered girl
was found on a bus headed to my casino.

536
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:39,810
I haven't spoken to anyone.

537
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:41,496
Did the mother and father call it in?

538
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:44,272
No. The Absaroka County
Sheriff's Department did,

539
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,709
seeking any and all
information about her identity.

540
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:48,419
You just couldn't wait, could you?

541
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:51,589
You just had to sabotage
my opening weekend.

542
00:33:54,826 --> 00:33:57,428
What do you mean, you released
that information to the press?

543
00:33:57,495 --> 00:34:01,933
Well, the autopsy didn't give us anything,
and you weren't coming up with anything.

544
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,251
Okay, Walt, maybe we should
have checked with you first,

545
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:07,563
but since you've been gone, we've gotten
used to do doing things a different way.

546
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,964
Well, I'm back.

547
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:11,109
And you had no business going around me.

548
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:13,886
[Eamonn] In Cumberland,
when we hit a dead end,

549
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:15,888
we do whatever we can
to identify our victim.

550
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,406
And frankly, any department would.

551
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:22,061
Except one where the sheriff has a
special arrangement with the casino owner.

552
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:24,330
- [knock on door]
- [Ruby] We got an I.D.

553
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:26,875
Her name is Delia Garrett from Minneapolis.

554
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:29,335
Her friends saw her photo on
the news. Heading right down.

555
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:31,254
[door closes]

556
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:44,226
Well, maybe this wasn't
the right time to be right.

557
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:14,756
It has to be you.

558
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,094
What do you mean?

559
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:22,454
I'm sorry.

560
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:24,348
I-I have the wrong person.

561
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:26,893
[Henry] Wait.

562
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:33,191
Hector sent me.

563
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:45,519
Walt, Eamonn was just doing his job.

564
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,772
I know that the FBI has been grilling
you about protocol for the last six weeks,

565
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:50,357
so you're extra sensitive about this,

566
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:53,336
but just because he didn't do it your
way doesn't mean that he is wrong.

567
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:55,070
This isn't about protocol.

568
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:57,299
This is about common decency.

569
00:35:57,949 --> 00:36:01,385
A mother and a father found out their
daughter was dead by seeing this...

570
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:03,763
An autopsy photo on TV.

571
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,766
Walt, you got visitors.

572
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:13,148
She was supposed to come with us,
but she canceled at the last second.

573
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:16,109
She say why?

574
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:17,860
She said she was sick.

575
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:20,345
But you didn't believe her?

576
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:21,739
[Sarah] Delia had money problems.

577
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:24,951
I thought maybe she just couldn't afford
the trip and didn't want to tell us.

578
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:26,869
[Logan] That's so stupid.

579
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:28,520
I would have loaned her the money.

580
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:30,581
Can you tell me the last
time you spoke to her?

581
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:34,276
Yeah, um, I can tell you exactly when.

582
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:38,155
We went to pick her up in the RV,
and she wasn't there, so I called her.

583
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:39,406
[sniffles]

584
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:43,345
She was at work, but she was sick and
said that we should leave without her.

585
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:47,039
7:30 p.m. Thursday.

586
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,269
Can either of you think of a reason
why Delia would be in Absaroka County?

587
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,270
Oh, my God.

588
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:57,424
Do you think she changed her
mind and tried to catch up to us?

589
00:36:57,425 --> 00:37:00,444
She knew everywhere we'd
be stopping along the way.

590
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:02,571
Well, does that sound like her?

591
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,407
She was impulsive.

592
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:08,661
I mean, don't get me wrong, she was
great, but she wasn't like the rest of us.

593
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,812
- How was she different?
- She would just disappear,

594
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:15,650
and then we'd get a postcard from, like,
Turkey or Uganda or some random place.

595
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:16,860
She brought a guy back once.

596
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:19,571
He didn't speak any English,
and he was just really weird.

597
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:21,656
I don't really know how to explain it,

598
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:25,303
other than she just didn't think
about the consequences of her actions.

599
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:30,373
So, it's possible that she got on a bus

600
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:34,270
and, uh, followed you here,
picked up a stranger on the way?

601
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:36,022
Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me.

602
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:38,983
[Walt] What about this?

603
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:45,823
It's backpack-y, kind of like
something Delia would have.

604
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:50,703
That was found on the bus that,
uh, crashed into you yesterday.

605
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:54,457
Your friend's body was found inside it.

606
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:57,818
Oh, my God. That's horrible.

607
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:59,653
I knew something like
this was gonna happen.

608
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:01,589
You can't just do whatever you want!

609
00:38:01,656 --> 00:38:03,406
Why don't you two just wait here?

610
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:05,385
I'll drive you back to your RV.

611
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,410
I want to speak to, uh,
the rest of your friends.

612
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,788
Maybe Delia contacted one of them.

613
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,057
I won't be long.

614
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:23,468
Ferg, find out all you
can about Delia Garrett.

615
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:25,304
Call her family, her employers.

616
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:27,490
See if she got any new or
unusual men in her life.

617
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:28,950
Yep.

618
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:37,459
Here's a better picture
of that girl, Randolph.

619
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:38,834
Now do you recognize her?

620
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:41,796
I told you before, no.

621
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:46,116
Was she like your wife?

622
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:48,177
Did she expect a free ride?

623
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:53,557
- Vic?
- [Vic] Yeah?

624
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:57,353
Call the bus company, uh, find
out where that bus stopped,

625
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,148
see if there's anywhere that,
uh, Delia could have gotten on.

626
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:04,193
Bus 85678, originated in Green Bay.

627
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:05,927
Before it picked up them oilmen in Oden,

628
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:08,805
it passed through Minneapolis,
Sioux Falls, and Sturgis,

629
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:14,120
whereupon some church people got on board,
coming on down here to gamble for Jesus.

630
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:17,272
Six of those oilmen said they
noticed a young brunette hottie.

631
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:20,668
The churchies said they noticed nothing,
probably didn't want to admit it.

632
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:23,904
56 people on that bus. So far, I've
talked to 54 of them at the casino.

633
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:26,341
One of those two empty seats
could have been Delia Garrett.

634
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:28,217
Bus did stop in Minneapolis.

635
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:31,703
Lucian, show this picture to those oilmen.

636
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:34,182
Confirm that, uh, she
was on the bus with them.

637
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:35,290
Got it.

638
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:38,353
Ferg, get some clothes for the bus driver.

639
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,771
I got to take those girls back to their RV.

640
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:45,467
I want, uh, Randolph Hale ready for
some more questions when I get back.

641
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:46,402
Got it.

642
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:51,157
- Right. Okay.
- So...

643
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:53,326
Vic. With me.

644
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:00,666
Hold down the fort, Ringo.

645
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:23,088
[Vic] Who's that?

646
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:25,107
[Logan] That's Noah, Nikki's fiancé.

647
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:27,050
He saw Delia on TV and came right over.

648
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:28,676
From Minnesota?

649
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:30,779
- That was quick.
- He was already here.

650
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:33,575
He was supposed to be the
big surprise for the bride.

651
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:35,683
Sarah arranged for him
to meet us at the casino.

652
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:37,769
She wanted everything
to be perfect for Nikki.

653
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,187
Noah knew Delia?

654
00:40:39,188 --> 00:40:41,832
Yeah. We've all been friends since college.

655
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:44,877
Hmm.

656
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,619
So, you want to talk about
what's been going on with you?

657
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,930
Nope.

658
00:40:58,082 --> 00:40:59,559
Okay.

659
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:06,131
Chelsea?

660
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:07,442
You okay?

661
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:10,903
I'll be fine, I guess. Um...

662
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:19,203
Wow.

663
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,146
- These are something.
- [Chelsea] Yeah.

664
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:23,416
Sarah had them made up for us.

665
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:25,585
She thought of everything.

666
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,005
Well, I was surprised to see Noah here.

667
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:34,427
In my day, the... well, the groom didn't
see the bride before the wedding, so...

668
00:41:34,452 --> 00:41:36,161
Nobody follows those dumb rules anymore.

669
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:38,514
We all knew he was coming except for Nikki.

670
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:40,308
Yeah.

671
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:45,480
You know, I, uh... Well, I don't get
the impression you're his biggest fan.

672
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,317
I'm kind of Sherlock-y, so...

673
00:41:52,136 --> 00:41:54,071
He's fine.

674
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:58,742
Is there something you want to tell me?

675
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:06,608
Uh...

676
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:09,652
I never told anybody before
because I couldn't be sure,

677
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:15,217
but... I picked up Delia up one
morning, and Noah's car was on her block.

678
00:42:15,993 --> 00:42:18,203
She lives in this shitty
nowhere part of town,

679
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:20,556
so he wouldn't just randomly be there.

680
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:24,018
Now he's here, and she's here.

681
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:27,546
I don't know. Maybe she came to meet him.

682
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:29,548
Maybe something went wrong.

683
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:30,941
I don't know.

684
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:34,761
[crying]

685
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:38,157
I probably just watch
way too much 48 Hours.

686
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:44,896
- What is it, Vic?
- Hey.

687
00:42:44,897 --> 00:42:49,651
So, um, Lucian showed the photo
of Delia to the oil workers,

688
00:42:49,652 --> 00:42:50,944
and they didn't recognize her.

689
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:52,820
They were all talking about someone else.

690
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:56,884
Apparently, they all had a crush on
a girl from the church group, so...

691
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,827
- Okay.
- Okay.

692
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:02,682
So, what do we do now?

693
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:06,894
For starters, you could check
the luggage compartment for me.

694
00:43:09,171 --> 00:43:10,523
Okay.

695
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:37,883
[sighs]

696
00:43:41,663 --> 00:43:43,723
What happened, Ursula?

697
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:49,586
The last time I saw
you, it was not this bad.

698
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:53,715
My husband got it in his head
I'd been talking about him.

699
00:43:53,716 --> 00:43:55,526
[winces] He went crazy.

700
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:59,113
But I swear, I hadn't.

701
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:03,075
I am so sorry.

702
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:05,727
It's funny.

703
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:08,289
When Hector asked if I
knew about the Bear Helper,

704
00:44:08,356 --> 00:44:11,250
I thought he was talking about the story.

705
00:44:11,317 --> 00:44:13,877
But he was talking about you.

706
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:15,504
Who's the Bear Helper?

707
00:44:17,657 --> 00:44:19,115
A long time ago,

708
00:44:19,116 --> 00:44:22,970
a Cheyenne woman and her child
were fleeing from Crow warriors.

709
00:44:23,037 --> 00:44:27,182
It was winter, so they
were alone and scared.

710
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:33,672
And she became more afraid when... when
she noticed a bear was following her.

711
00:44:33,673 --> 00:44:37,008
But then the bear said to the woman,

712
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:42,906
"I am following you to cover your tracks
with mine so the Crow will not find you."

713
00:44:44,016 --> 00:44:47,244
When she and her child got to a wide river,

714
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:49,037
he carried them across to safety.

715
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:54,526
[chuckling softly]

716
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:56,086
My tooth fell out!

717
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,432
Will Hector take his teeth?

718
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,312
I never wanted him to hurt my dad.

719
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:18,693
What exactly did you ask of Hector?

720
00:45:20,177 --> 00:45:21,278
To help my mom.

721
00:45:23,472 --> 00:45:25,574
Then that is exactly what he will do.

722
00:45:32,398 --> 00:45:33,833
Right this way.

723
00:45:35,192 --> 00:45:37,778
I don't want to make
your weekend any worse.

724
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:38,820
Uh...

725
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:42,407
I just need to get a few
statements before you all head home.

726
00:45:42,408 --> 00:45:44,468
Ruby, could you show them to my office?

727
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,369
Thanks, Ferg.

728
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,263
Right this way, please.

729
00:45:52,418 --> 00:45:55,128
Okay, so, I got some background on Delia.

730
00:45:55,129 --> 00:45:57,380
Both of her parents
died when she was young,

731
00:45:57,381 --> 00:45:59,466
so she was pretty much on her own.

732
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:00,925
Uh, and she was hard up for money.

733
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:03,637
She only had $240 in her checking account.

734
00:46:03,638 --> 00:46:04,846
But I talked to her boss.

735
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:07,307
He said she took four days
off to come on this trip,

736
00:46:07,308 --> 00:46:11,245
said she was excited, that, uh,
this was her best friend's wedding.

737
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:15,917
Vic, you find anything in
the luggage compartment?

738
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:17,459
Uh...

739
00:46:18,694 --> 00:46:20,821
Other than the smell of vomit, no.

740
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:23,281
- What were you expecting to find?
- More than that.

741
00:46:23,282 --> 00:46:26,451
Uh, run the fiancé's
credit cards... Noah Minton.

742
00:46:26,452 --> 00:46:28,453
See if he was here all weekend.

743
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:31,914
As soon as you get the
information, bring it in to me.

744
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:35,853
Hey, Walt, if it would help, I can work
on the groom while you question the girls.

745
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:38,063
Thanks, but no.

746
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:41,692
Listen, Eamonn, I appreciate
you filling in while I was gone,

747
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:44,361
but I won't be needing you anymore.

748
00:46:44,428 --> 00:46:46,572
Let your boss know I owe him a favor.

749
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:58,000
Sarah, thanks for coming down again.

750
00:46:58,066 --> 00:47:02,212
I thought, uh, Nikki may
need some emotional support.

751
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:03,965
It's, uh... It's quite a lot to take in.

752
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:05,758
- Yeah.
- No. Of course.

753
00:47:05,825 --> 00:47:10,453
I was hoping you could, uh,
give me some insight into Delia,

754
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:12,681
who she was, what she was like.

755
00:47:13,374 --> 00:47:15,058
Who may have wanted to harm her.

756
00:47:18,337 --> 00:47:21,715
I understand that, uh, Nikki and
Delia were freshman roommates.

757
00:47:21,716 --> 00:47:26,236
So, Noah, I assume you've known
Delia as long as your fiancée.

758
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:29,156
Yeah. I guess I did.

759
00:47:30,057 --> 00:47:32,701
You had any recent contact with Delia?

760
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:35,645
Just the usual stuff, you
know, with the wedding and all.

761
00:47:35,646 --> 00:47:38,624
[Walt] Well, I heard that you
were the surprise of the trip.

762
00:47:38,691 --> 00:47:41,752
I guess your affair was
the surprise of the wedding.

763
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:45,255
- [sobs]
- What?

764
00:47:45,322 --> 00:47:48,300
Did you arrange for Delia
to come down here and see you

765
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:51,160
because you knew your
fiancée was on the road?

766
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:52,620
Oh, my God.

767
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:56,517
Maybe Delia threatened to tell
Nikki, and that's why you killed her.

768
00:47:56,584 --> 00:47:59,269
[scoffs] No, I don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

769
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:02,564
Well, you knew enough to dump the
body where you wouldn't be suspected.

770
00:48:02,631 --> 00:48:05,150
And you had access to the
girls' itinerary, right?

771
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,219
Yeah, he did. I gave it to him.

772
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,404
What did you do, Noah?

773
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:13,701
These girls never saw the bag that
Delia was stuffed into, but you saw it,

774
00:48:13,768 --> 00:48:14,827
because you bought it.

775
00:48:14,894 --> 00:48:16,603
No. This is insane.

776
00:48:16,604 --> 00:48:18,288
I don't know what you're talking about.

777
00:48:18,355 --> 00:48:20,899
My deputy just ran your credit cards.

778
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:25,671
You had a recent purchase from a nearby
Walmart hours before the body was found.

779
00:48:25,738 --> 00:48:27,154
What? No.

780
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:29,490
Hey, baby, say something.

781
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:31,534
Tell him there is no way
I could ever kill Delia.

782
00:48:31,535 --> 00:48:32,869
Stop it. You're hurting her.

783
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,013
You stay out of it.

784
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,582
This trip, this entire wedding has
been nothing but the two of you.

785
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:40,167
Did they shut you out, Noah?

786
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:41,812
Is that why you turned to Delia?

787
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:45,047
Delia think this was
more than a one-time deal?

788
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:47,717
- Yeah, it was more than one time.
- [Noah] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

789
00:48:47,718 --> 00:48:50,219
I didn't do this. I don't know
why you're trying to blame me!

790
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,740
- Grow up, Noah, and take responsibility.
- Shut up!

791
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:55,492
[sobbing]

792
00:48:59,438 --> 00:49:04,126
Vic, could you take Noah outside,
please, and see that he doesn't leave?

793
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:12,885
This was supposed to be perfect.

794
00:49:12,952 --> 00:49:14,970
[Sarah] I'm sorry. He
didn't deserve you anyway.

795
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:16,597
Can we go now, please?

796
00:49:16,664 --> 00:49:18,456
- Sure.
- Thank you.

797
00:49:18,457 --> 00:49:24,170
So, Sarah, you said that, uh,
Delia canceled at the last minute,

798
00:49:24,171 --> 00:49:27,900
so why didn't you have
any gifts made up for her?

799
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:31,236
Champagne flutes or T-shirts?

800
00:49:32,054 --> 00:49:34,698
Well, unless you knew she
wasn't coming all along.

801
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,851
Why are you asking us this?

802
00:49:37,852 --> 00:49:40,603
You just said Noah did it.
He bought the bag at Walmart.

803
00:49:40,604 --> 00:49:41,872
[Walt] Oh, I'm sorry.

804
00:49:41,939 --> 00:49:43,874
I thought we were all lying.

805
00:49:43,941 --> 00:49:47,086
Isn't that the game we're playing here?

806
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:50,404
I lied about the credit-card charge.

807
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:52,406
No Walmart. [clears throat]

808
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:53,950
Noah lied about the affair.

809
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:57,638
And you, well, you lied
about who killed Delia.

810
00:49:58,873 --> 00:49:59,974
It was you.

811
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:05,545
You already admitted that you knew
about Delia and Noah, so you had motive.

812
00:50:05,546 --> 00:50:07,106
They betrayed your best friend here,

813
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:09,465
and if you didn't order
a gift basket for Delia

814
00:50:09,466 --> 00:50:12,194
because you knew that she
wasn't coming on your trip,

815
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,823
well, that gives you
intent and premeditation.

816
00:50:17,641 --> 00:50:21,352
The only thing... The only thing that
was premeditated was talking to Delia.

817
00:50:21,353 --> 00:50:23,229
We just wanted to get
her to admit anything,

818
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,898
so when Nikki and I showed up in the RV

819
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:27,209
and she just got on like nothing was wrong,

820
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:30,570
like she could be screwing Noah
and she could still be our friend...

821
00:50:30,571 --> 00:50:32,697
We didn't mean for any of
this to happen. I promise.

822
00:50:32,698 --> 00:50:35,425
She tried to leave, so I grabbed
her, and she started pushing me.

823
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:37,994
Nikki pushed her off, and I-I-I
have no idea how it happened,

824
00:50:37,995 --> 00:50:39,996
but she hit her head and
she landed on the floor

825
00:50:39,997 --> 00:50:42,248
and she wasn't moving and
she was bleeding so much.

826
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:43,875
So, we drove and we got a bag.

827
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:46,311
And she would even admit anything!

828
00:50:46,378 --> 00:50:50,107
And after you got hit by the casino bus,

829
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:55,112
the two of you, you took
advantage of all that chaos,

830
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:57,865
took somebody else's luggage tag,

831
00:50:57,932 --> 00:51:01,976
put it on your new bag,

832
00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:03,662
and dumped the body.

833
00:51:05,522 --> 00:51:08,709
[Nikki] Sarah, how did this happen?

834
00:51:10,736 --> 00:51:13,172
I did everything right.

835
00:51:13,864 --> 00:51:15,674
[Nikki sobs]

836
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:31,648
What I don't understand is why they
didn't just call off the wedding.

837
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,277
Some people just don't
know how to end things.

838
00:51:38,097 --> 00:51:41,867
I just want to say goodbye
and thank you. I enjoyed it.

839
00:51:41,934 --> 00:51:43,744
Good luck to you.

840
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:51,710
Let me walk you out.

841
00:51:53,654 --> 00:51:56,464
Walt, Mathias is on the phone.

842
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:59,176
He needs to talk to you.

843
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:07,792
I am so sorry. I don't
know what the problem is.

844
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:09,502
You're a really good cop.

845
00:52:09,503 --> 00:52:10,854
Oh, I know.

846
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:13,440
Walt's just jealous... of you and me.

847
00:52:14,967 --> 00:52:16,693
Let's look at the bright side.

848
00:52:18,137 --> 00:52:22,783
I'm only one county away, and, uh, well,
now I got your number and you got mine.

849
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:26,227
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

850
00:52:26,228 --> 00:52:30,373
We, uh, certainly have each other's number.

851
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:39,883
[vehicle door closes, engine turns over]

852
00:52:55,549 --> 00:52:57,276
[Mathias] Hey, Standing Bear,

853
00:52:57,342 --> 00:53:01,280
Merwin Tall Grass filed a report
that his wife and child are missing.

854
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:03,031
How can I help?

855
00:53:03,098 --> 00:53:05,492
You can tell me where they are.

856
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:07,494
And why would I know that?

857
00:53:07,561 --> 00:53:11,105
Tall Grass reported that you were paying
a little too much attention to his wife

858
00:53:11,106 --> 00:53:12,624
at the casino opening.

859
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:18,738
I was paying attention to
the bruises he gave her.

860
00:53:18,739 --> 00:53:22,050
I hope for her sake she and
her son are very far away.

861
00:53:22,117 --> 00:53:25,828
A neighbor reported seeing you
drop the boy off near his house

862
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:28,807
a day before his mother
and him disappeared.

863
00:53:28,874 --> 00:53:30,517
We need to search your apartment.

864
00:53:30,584 --> 00:53:35,213
I have no authority off
the Res, but Walt does.

865
00:53:35,214 --> 00:53:36,756
Come on, Henry.

866
00:53:36,757 --> 00:53:39,442
Just let us take a quick look
inside, and we'll leave you alone.

867
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:43,322
I told you, they are not
here. You should trust me.

868
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:44,948
I do.

869
00:53:44,973 --> 00:53:47,492
Then why are you still insisting
on going up to my apartment?

870
00:53:49,228 --> 00:53:52,122
'Cause right now, a whole
lot of people don't trust me.

871
00:54:50,038 --> 00:54:51,639
[door closes]

872
00:55:05,846 --> 00:55:08,073
[mid-tempo music playing]

873
00:55:21,153 --> 00:55:22,421
Buy you another?

874
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:27,550
Jess.

875
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:38,228
Thanks.

876
00:55:47,846 --> 00:55:52,993
I wanted to thank you for
your help on this case.

877
00:55:54,602 --> 00:55:57,247
Work keeps me on the
right side of the grass.

878
00:55:58,106 --> 00:56:01,084
Sorry to hear about them
pretty girls going to jail.

879
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:03,878
News travels.

880
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:11,553
I know I haven't said it, but...

881
00:56:13,496 --> 00:56:15,474
I'm sorry about Barlow.

882
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,604
After you shot Barlow,

883
00:56:21,671 --> 00:56:25,859
I cogitated on all the ways I
could have been a better brother.

884
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:32,723
Maybe if I'd done more...
spent more time with him,

885
00:56:32,724 --> 00:56:35,494
Branch would be alive,

886
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,080
Martha would be alive.

887
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:45,086
You believe that?

888
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:52,344
I'll tell you what I believe.

889
00:56:53,703 --> 00:56:56,247
My brother would have been a good man

890
00:56:56,248 --> 00:57:00,935
if somebody had been there to
shoot him every minute of his life.

891
00:57:19,013 --> 00:57:26,513
