00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,673
I feel the sand. I feel
the dirt. I feel the gravel.

162
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,558
I never slip. I never...
I don't... I never stumble.

163
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,189
I can follow a trail in the dark
and never stray off the path.

164
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,272
I live <i>with</i> this world. I'm
not just in it, is what I'm sayin'.

165
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,035
But to answer your question, Gately,
the beaver, they're played out.

166
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,430
That's the truth.
That market's done and gone.

167
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,035
There's no fortune to be had there
anymore. Your man Astor got it all.

168
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,998
[Man] We should have made the
trip earlier. Waited too long.

169
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,878
No, you know, there... there
are plenty of fortunes to be had.

170
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,034
I mean, the beaver, that's a... That's just
the first gift of this land. You mark my words.

171
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,669
Will the territory go American?
That's what I want to know.

172
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,274
Well, in my...
in my opinion, l...

173
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,197
Well, you know, it depends.

174
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,913
It depends on the fight...
in the Americans,

175
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,793
and in the English,
and in the Indians.

176
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,998
I'm led to believe there's 250
Americans in Oregon country.

177
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,749
There's seven more argonauts comin' in a
few weeks. Maybe that'll tip the scales.

178
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,751
Where would you
settle?

179
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,798
[Exhales]
Willamette Valley.

180
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,354
That's where my brotherJoe
put down stakes.

181
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,277
Civilization
is taking hold there.

182
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,629
They got missionaries
in Champoeg.

183
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,154
Could have found God
in Virginia.

184
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,038
Well, if it's riches you're
after, there's riches aplenty.

185
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,918
The land you're headed for
is a regular second Eden.

186
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,831
You won't want
for riches someday.

187
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,593
You'll just plunge your hands
into the ground.

188
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,311
[Emily]
Come to bed.

189
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,952
Soon.

190
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,311
That was my mother's.

191
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,833
I know.

192
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,311
It's only weight now.

193
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,552
[Glass Shatters]

194
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,798
Jimmy!

195
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,151
[Wagon Approaching]

196
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,634
He's gone.
I'm telling you.

197
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,673
He's abandoned us. He'll move
faster alone. It's what I'd do.

198
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,671
No, it's not
what you'd do.

199
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,391
He saw the writing.

200
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,190
How much water
you reckon?

201
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,878
Two days, maybe three.

202
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,071
Ah. He's gone by now.

203
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,798
He's gone by now.

204
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,831
There we are.

205
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,159
Ho!

206
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,631
Water! [Solomon] Amen.

207
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,119
Water ahead!

208
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,872
[Wagon Approaching]

209
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,916
It's alkaline!

210
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,873
It's alkaline.

211
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,672
Whoa. Whoa.

212
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,079
[Horse Blusters]

213
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,551
[Meek]
It's alkaline.

214
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,509
[Meek]
Can't water here.

215
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,471
Not even the animals.

216
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,513
Well, then?

217
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,357
What now?

218
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,470
Well,
we skirt around.

219
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,115
Go south
till we make it around.

220
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,037
[Thomas]
How far is it around?

221
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,838
[Meek]
Well, we'll find out.

222
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,912
Shouldn't be too far. The maps
I've seen don't record much of this.

223
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,439
Oh.

224
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,031
[Solomon]
No.

225
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,190
We're not going
farther south.

226
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,835
[Meek] Well, we can't keep
west unless you brought oars.

227
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,553
[Solomon] We're heading north.

228
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,158
Meet back with the
main stem if we have to.

229
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,798
[Meek] There's scarce
grass and water up north.

230
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,438
South is the best bet.

231
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,318
[Solomon Chuckling] Well, there's
nothing where we came from either,

232
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,472
and there's nothing ahead,
so I'm saying north.

233
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,397
We'll move closer
to the Columbia.

234
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,510
That way we can rejoin
the communication.

235
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,949
[William]
l... I see your thinking.

236
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,397
How many days to the
Columbia from hereabouts?

237
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,913
[Meek]
Well, too many.

238
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,750
West is the goal. The sooner
we get moving west, the better.

239
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,513
The quickest way west,
by my reckoning...

240
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,238
south.

241
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,634
Mr. Gately,
do you have an opinion?

242
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,233
[Thomas]
I think north too.

243
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,840
[Meek]
Well, I'm advising against that.

244
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,718
Now, I've been all through
this country, more or less.

245
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,872
By God, you contracted me to
get you to the Valley. I will.

246
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,394
[Solomon] We understand
that, Mr. Meek. We understand.

247
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,513
But you work for us, Mr. Meek.
You'll be paid.

248
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,878
Just, uh, we're not going
around. We're going north.

249
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,549
[Bridle Rattling]
[Meek] Suit yourselves.

250
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,390
[Meek]
We'll do what we do.

251
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,396
[Solomon]
Two shots if we find water.

252
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,754
[Men Clicking Tongues]

253
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,472
[Gasps]

254
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,159
Hyah!

255
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,630
[Gasping, Panting]

256
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,228
[Boy] Mrs. Tetherow, look what we found!

257
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,033
[Glory] What is it, Emily?

258
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,474
Jimmy.

259
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,192
Jimmy.

260
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,595
[Groans]

261
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,796
[Meek]
So he wore clothes?

262
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,838
Yes.

263
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,279
Yes, some.

264
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,311
Paint on his face?

265
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,476
No.
Horse?

266
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,913
Uh, yes.

267
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,076
Was he carryin' a weapon?
A knife or a bow?

268
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,112
Uh... no.

269
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,031
No, I don't think so.

270
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,078
[Stammering] I'm not sure. I was upset.

271
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,680
He-He had a... a scar
on his shoulder though.

272
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,756
Well, if he wore clothes,
he's no Digger.

273
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,398
They're hardly
more than animals.

274
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,432
We're too far south for
that anyway. Might be Paiute.

275
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,959
Could be Nez Perce.

276
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,758
He could be Cayuse.
They're from the north.

277
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,638
It's far west for Blackfoot,
but that's possible.

278
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,678
And what does that mean?
[Meek Chuckles]

279
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,518
Jimmy,
go help your mother.

280
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,471
[Meek]
Well, frankly, I'm amazed.

281
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,398
Mrs. Tetherow saw this redskin
and lived to tell the tale.

282
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,758
I mean, you rarely see
hide nor hair of a hostile...

283
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,439
till he just jumps you
and cuts your throat.

284
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,391
They can disappear
in their own shadow.

285
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,116
They can hide under a wolf skin so
quiet, you step on 'em before you know it.

286
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,757
And where one redskin is, there's
a dozen more just lurkin' nearby.

287
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,115
And they're all armed by now.

288
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,352
[Laughing]
And sometimes...

289
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,115
I mean, sometimes they wait till they're
fired on, but most often they don't.

290
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,116
When they come
on a woman,

291
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,194
they kill her.

292
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,955
I mean, they'd never dream
of sparin' a woman.

293
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,994
So I'm guessin'
it's Cayuse.

294
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,553
On a horse
this far north.

295
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,912
I mean, they roam all over the basin
here, all the way down to Mexico.

296
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,191
They pick up slaves from the
Klamaths. They sell' em at Celilo.

297
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,754
We'll find out presently,
I reckon.

298
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,432
[Solomon]
No fires tonight.

299
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,911
[Meek]
And double watch.

300
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,837
[Thomas] Dandy. [William] Mercy.

301
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,757
[Meek] Hell's full of
Indians, my friends.

302
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,711
You were lucky tonight,
ma'am.

303
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,711
Don't want a blanket.

304
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,271
Don't make it worse.

305
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,030
Cold is the least
of my troubles.

306
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,798
Hmm.

307
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,355
It's only a few days north to
the Columbia by my reckoning.

308
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,959
I been keepin' notes.

309
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,510
What if we don't find
water soon? We will.

310
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,397
Your optimism.

311
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,958
I'm sorry.

312
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,800
Is he ignorant,

313
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,673
or is he
just plain evil?

314
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,109
That's my quandary.
It's impossible to know.

315
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,470
We can't know.

01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:31,070
Thomas, please.
We still have a choice.

792
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,678
[Solomon]
What about you, Mrs. White?

793
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,234
Which way
does your family prefer?

794
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,191
We stay the course.

795
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:46,310
We don't have a choice,
not that I see.

796
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:47,873
[Thomas]
Meek?

797
01:31:56,600 --> 01:32:00,115
I'm taking my orders
from you now, Mr. Tetherow,

798
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:01,838
Mrs. Tetherow.

799
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,874
And we're all taking
our orders from him, I'd say.

800
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,509
We're all just
playing our parts now.

801
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:11,869
This was written
long before we got here.

802
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,911
I'm at your command.
