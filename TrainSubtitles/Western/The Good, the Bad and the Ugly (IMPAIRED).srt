01:07:15,944 --> 01:07:17,434
Blondie?

862
01:07:22,951 --> 01:07:23,781
Hey, Blon...

863
01:07:23,952 --> 01:07:25,112
Blondie?

864
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:31,581
Oh.

[Groans]

866
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:44,167
Hey. Heh heh heh heh.

867
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:45,670
The old Father tells me...

868
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,206
you'll be up and around
in a few days.

869
01:07:48,376 --> 01:07:49,673
You're very lucky...

870
01:07:49,844 --> 01:07:52,278
to have me so close
when it happened.

871
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,109
Think if you'd been
on your own...

[Groans]

Look, I mean when...

874
01:07:58,786 --> 01:08:01,687
when one is, uh... ill...

875
01:08:01,856 --> 01:08:04,689
it's good to have
somebody close by...

876
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:06,724
friends or relations.

877
01:08:06,894 --> 01:08:08,225
Do you...

878
01:08:08,396 --> 01:08:10,728
Do you have parents, Blondie?

879
01:08:10,898 --> 01:08:12,729
A mother?

880
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,733
Not even a mother.

881
01:08:15,903 --> 01:08:17,734
No one.

882
01:08:17,905 --> 01:08:19,236
You're all alone, huh?

883
01:08:19,407 --> 01:08:20,738
Like me, Blondie.

884
01:08:20,908 --> 01:08:24,241
We're all alone in the world.

885
01:08:24,412 --> 01:08:28,246
I have you. You have me.

886
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:31,442
Only for a little while,
I mean.

887
01:08:31,619 --> 01:08:33,951
It had to happen now.

888
01:08:34,122 --> 01:08:36,955
What a dirty, rotten trick
of fate.

889
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:39,184
We could have
all that money...

890
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,157
in our hands... now.

891
01:08:45,233 --> 01:08:46,063
I...

892
01:08:46,234 --> 01:08:49,067
I must tell you
the truth, Blondie.

893
01:08:49,237 --> 01:08:53,071
In my place, you would
do the same thing.

894
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:56,574
It's all over for you now.

895
01:08:56,744 --> 01:09:00,578
There's nothing
anyone can do anymore.

896

[Sobbing]

897
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:04,081
Oh, God, look at me.

898
01:09:04,252 --> 01:09:07,346
It's my fault. Mine.
Mine. Mine. Mine.

899
01:09:17,765 --> 01:09:20,757
I'll tell you one thing,
Blondie.

900
01:09:20,935 --> 01:09:24,496
If I knew that
my last hour had come...

901
01:09:24,672 --> 01:09:26,003
I swear, in my place...
in your place...

902
01:09:26,174 --> 01:09:28,506
I would do the same thing.

903
01:09:28,676 --> 01:09:30,610
I would tell about the gold.

904
01:09:30,778 --> 01:09:32,109
Yes. Yes, I would.

905
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,840
I'd tell the name on the grave.

906
01:09:35,016 --> 01:09:36,779
After all, what good
is the money to you...

907
01:09:36,951 --> 01:09:37,849
if you're dead?

908
01:09:38,019 --> 01:09:39,509
I know the name
of the cemetery...

909
01:09:39,687 --> 01:09:42,622
but you know how many
graves there are there?

910
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:44,121
Please...

911
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:46,123
Blondie...

912
01:09:46,294 --> 01:09:47,625
Please, have a little.

913
01:09:47,795 --> 01:09:50,093
Here.

914
01:09:50,264 --> 01:09:52,027
Here... coffee.

915
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,135
Please, tell me the name.

916
01:09:55,303 --> 01:09:56,133
On...

917
01:09:56,304 --> 01:09:57,635
on the grave.

918
01:09:57,805 --> 01:10:02,299
If I get my hands
on the $200,000...

919
01:10:03,644 --> 01:10:06,340
I'll always honor your memory.

920
01:10:06,514 --> 01:10:07,344
I swear.

921
01:10:07,515 --> 01:10:09,346
I'll always honor your memory.

922
01:10:09,517 --> 01:10:10,779
I'll...

923
01:10:12,754 --> 01:10:15,018
Come... closer.

924
01:10:19,827 --> 01:10:21,624
Tell... tell me.

925
01:10:23,498 --> 01:10:25,090
You dirty...

926
01:10:27,835 --> 01:10:29,029
I'll sleep better...

927
01:10:29,203 --> 01:10:34,698
knowing my good friend
is by my side...

928
01:10:34,876 --> 01:10:37,242
to protect me.

929
01:10:47,855 --> 01:10:49,755
"Tuco, water." Here's water...

930
01:10:49,924 --> 01:10:51,687
but if I get that name
from you...

931
01:10:51,859 --> 01:10:53,827
I'll give you water.

932
01:10:59,734 --> 01:11:01,565
All right, you dirty skunk...

933
01:11:01,736 --> 01:11:03,067
get your ass off the bed.

934
01:11:03,237 --> 01:11:05,330
Come on, come on,
the party's over.

935
01:11:05,506 --> 01:11:07,531
The wagon is all ready to go.

936
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:08,640
From the way the wounded...

937
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:09,708
are pouring into this place...

938
01:11:09,877 --> 01:11:11,105
we'd better get
the hell out of here...

939
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:13,110
before we get caught up
in the war.

940
01:11:13,281 --> 01:11:15,112
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.

941
01:11:15,283 --> 01:11:17,114
There's something
I have to look into.

942
01:11:17,285 --> 01:11:19,116
It'll only take a minute.

943
01:11:19,287 --> 01:11:20,117
Get moving.

944
01:11:20,288 --> 01:11:21,619
Where? This way?

945
01:11:21,789 --> 01:11:23,051
Yes.

946
01:11:38,906 --> 01:11:39,736
Hey.

947
01:11:39,907 --> 01:11:41,067
Hey, Pablo?

948
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:44,271
[Chuckles]

949
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,310
Hey...

950
01:11:47,481 --> 01:11:48,470
Hey.

951
01:11:48,649 --> 01:11:51,618
Don't you recognize me?

952
01:11:51,786 --> 01:11:54,118
Heh heh heh heh. It's me!

953
01:11:54,288 --> 01:11:55,118
It's Tuco!

954
01:11:55,289 --> 01:11:56,654
Let me embrace you!

955
01:11:56,824 --> 01:11:59,554
Oh... ooh.

956
01:11:59,727 --> 01:12:03,663
L... I don't know
the right thing.

957
01:12:07,902 --> 01:12:09,233
I was just passing by here.

958
01:12:09,403 --> 01:12:10,734
I said to myself...

959
01:12:10,905 --> 01:12:13,931
"I wonder if my brother
remembers his brother?"

960
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:18,107
Did I do wrong?

961
01:12:19,647 --> 01:12:20,978
It doesn't matter.

962
01:12:21,148 --> 01:12:22,479
I'm very happy.

963
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:24,811
You have seen me, Tuco.

964
01:12:24,986 --> 01:12:29,650
Yeah, well, I'm...
I'm very glad I came.

965
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,757
Uh...

966
01:12:34,929 --> 01:12:36,260
Oh, my uniform!

967
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:37,761
It's a long story.

968
01:12:37,932 --> 01:12:40,423
But let's talk about you.

969
01:12:40,601 --> 01:12:41,761
It's more important.

970
01:12:41,936 --> 01:12:44,666
You look very well.

971
01:12:44,839 --> 01:12:47,774
Hmm, a bit thin perhaps, but...

972
01:12:47,942 --> 01:12:49,273
Ha ha ha ha!

973
01:12:49,443 --> 01:12:52,173
You were always thin,
eh, Pablito?

974
01:12:53,447 --> 01:12:54,277
Well...

975
01:12:54,448 --> 01:12:57,144
What about our parents?

976
01:12:57,318 --> 01:13:01,186
Only now do you think of them.

977
01:13:01,355 --> 01:13:04,347
To begin after nine years.

978
01:13:05,893 --> 01:13:08,191
Nine years?

979
01:13:08,362 --> 01:13:09,693
So, it's nine years.

980
01:13:09,864 --> 01:13:11,195
Ha ha ha ha!

981
01:13:11,365 --> 01:13:13,765
Nine years!

982
01:13:13,935 --> 01:13:17,336
Our mother has been dead
a long time now.

983
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:21,272
Our father died
only a few days ago.

984
01:13:21,442 --> 01:13:24,275
That's why I was away.

985
01:13:24,445 --> 01:13:27,346
He asked for you to be there.

986
01:13:27,515 --> 01:13:30,348
But there was only me.

987
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:39,289
And you?

988
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,449
Outside of evil...

989
01:13:40,628 --> 01:13:43,290
what else
have you managed to do?

990
01:13:43,464 --> 01:13:44,726
It seems to me...

991
01:13:44,899 --> 01:13:47,094
you once had a wife someplace.

992
01:13:49,971 --> 01:13:51,802
Not one. Lots of them.

993
01:13:51,973 --> 01:13:53,304
One here. One there.

994
01:13:53,474 --> 01:13:54,805
Wherever I found them.

995
01:13:54,976 --> 01:13:59,811
Go on.
Preach me a sermon, Pablo.

996
01:13:59,981 --> 01:14:02,541
What good would that be?

997
01:14:03,985 --> 01:14:06,818
Just keep on
the way you're going.

998
01:14:06,988 --> 01:14:07,818
Go away.

999
01:14:07,989 --> 01:14:10,822
And the Lord have mercy
on your soul.

1000
01:14:10,992 --> 01:14:12,084
Sure, I'll go.

1001
01:14:12,259 --> 01:14:13,351
And while I'm waiting...

1002
01:14:13,527 --> 01:14:15,324
for the Lord
to remember me...

1003
01:14:15,496 --> 01:14:16,622
I, Tuco Ramirez...

1004
01:14:16,797 --> 01:14:18,321
brother of Brother Ramirez...

1005
01:14:18,499 --> 01:14:19,830
will tell you something.

1006
01:14:20,001 --> 01:14:22,333
You think you're better
than I am.

1007
01:14:22,503 --> 01:14:23,663
Where we came from...

1008
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:25,999
if one did not want
to die of poverty...

1009
01:14:26,173 --> 01:14:28,334
one became a priest or a bandit.

1010
01:14:28,509 --> 01:14:30,943
You chose your way.
I chose mine.

1011
01:14:31,112 --> 01:14:32,079
Mine was harder!

1012
01:14:32,246 --> 01:14:34,077
You talk about
Mother and Father.

1013
01:14:34,248 --> 01:14:35,772
You remember, when you left
to become a priest...

1014
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:37,144
I stayed behind.

1015
01:14:37,318 --> 01:14:40,151
I must have been 10, 12...
I don't remember which...

1016
01:14:40,321 --> 01:14:41,788
but I stayed.

1017
01:14:41,956 --> 01:14:44,288
I tried, but it was no good.

1018
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:45,686
Now I will tell you something.

1019
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:46,986
You became a priest...

1020
01:14:47,161 --> 01:14:50,790
because you were too much
of a coward to do what I do.

1021
01:14:50,965 --> 01:14:52,626
Ugh!

1022
01:15:08,282 --> 01:15:09,749
Tuco.

1023
01:15:20,995 --> 01:15:23,691
Please forgive me, brother.

1024

[Bell rings]

01:15:34,008 --> 01:15:36,238

to guard them.

I have to have respect.

to gain their respect...

not to be tortured...

I know there's scum around...

I won't last very long...

to have enough time...
