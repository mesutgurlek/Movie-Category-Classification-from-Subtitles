A big fellow, about 6' 4"
riding that Appaloosa stud out there,

29
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:45,757
he came in here a little while ago?

30
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:49,445
He in the washroom.
He shaves, he cleans up.

31
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,466
Thanks.

32
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:08,752
Hi, Cole.

33
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:12,207
That's a voice I'd know anywhere.

34
00:03:12,303 --> 00:03:17,048
JP Harrah. Wait till I get
some of the soap out of my eyes.

35
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,223
I heard you were made sheriff...

36
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:24,860
What's the idea of the gun?

37
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:27,173
Just ' till I find out
which side you're on, Cole.

38
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:30,519
What do you mean?
I heard you were working for Bart Jason.

39
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:34,740
Well, Nothing's set yet.

40
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:38,904
He offered me good money, but I haven't
found out what I have to do to earn it.

41
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:42,577
Would you like to hear?
Yeah, go ahead.

42
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:45,749
Cole, that's about close
enough to that gun.

43
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:49,749
I just wanted to see
if you'd slowed down any.

44
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:51,829
Not that much.

45
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:54,832
What were you saying about Jason?

46
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:58,971
Well, he showed up here around the end
of the war with a pocket full of money.

47
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:01,427
Nobody seems to be able to
find out where he got it from...

48
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:03,954
but... everybody else
around here was broke.

49
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:07,085
You know how it was then.
Yeah, all over Texas.

50
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:08,941
Well, having money, he
started to grow.

51
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:11,439
Now, he can't grow any bigger
until he gets more water.

52
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:13,773
There's only one place to get it.

53
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:17,728
Trouble is, somebody was there
ahead of him. About 20 years ahead.

54
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:19,863
A man named Kevin MacDonald got here

55
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,073
when there was nothing
but Indians and coyotes.

56
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,909
Mr. MacDonald's got four boys and a
girl, and they've all worked real hard.

57
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:27,912
They hung together through
all the rough times,

58
00:04:27,943 --> 00:04:29,776
and now that things are
beginning to look up,

59
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:32,539
MacDonald's in no mind to sell.

60
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:36,923
So he's holding and Jason's pushing...
and I'm standing right in the middle.

61
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:39,760
It's not the way it was told to me.

62
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:43,972
That's the way it is, Cole, I guess
you're supposed to take care of me.

63
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:50,392
Well, not that I couldn't... do it, Harrah,
but... I don't think I'd like that.

64
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:52,893
I'm glad to hear you say that.

65
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:56,231
Not that I couldn't handle you...
but... I don't think I'd like that either.

66
00:04:56,443 --> 00:05:01,520
Suppose I tell Jason that
I had a long talk with you and...

67
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:04,106
and you scared me off.

68
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:06,526
Good enough?
Good enough.

69
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:09,828
You can put that thing down now.

70
00:05:09,914 --> 00:05:12,832
There's somethin' familiar
about that gun.

71
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:15,832
I just had it fixed-up
the way you had yours.

72
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:17,855
You got lucky with it,
I thought I'd try it.

73
00:05:17,856 --> 00:05:19,355
Ha!

74
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:20,423
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

75
00:05:20,424 --> 00:05:24,026
Cole Thornton, you decent? You'd
better be, 'cause I'm a comin' in.

76
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,617
Ah, it's good to see you.

77
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:29,044
You know when they told me you
were here, I didn't believe them!

78
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:32,385
I thought you'd forgotten
all about me, I thought that...

79
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:35,012
Hi, JP (LAUGHING)

80
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:41,902
What's so funny?
This whole thing. (CONTINUING TO LAUGH)

81
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,855
Do you know what
she's laughing about?

82
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:48,237
I gather you knew him
before you knew me.

83
00:05:48,326 --> 00:05:50,652
Before you? I knew her
when she was a kid.

84
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,305
Didn't you know that, JP?

85
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:57,578
No, you never mentioned that.
Up until now, I thought you had good taste.

86
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:01,416
And, up until now,
I thought she had good taste.

87
00:06:01,505 --> 00:06:03,912
(SIGH)...I'm awful glad
you two are friends.

88
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:06,379
We may not be when we
think this thing over.

89
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:08,092
If you aren't, I'm
through with both of you.

90
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:10,792
You know something, Cole, I think
We better get ourselves a new girl.

91
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:13,552
Yeah.
You better not. -Why not?

92
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:16,428
I'm girl enough for you both.
Say, can I buy you a drink?

93
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,738
Well, I'd like that very much,

94
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:22,836
but I promised JP I'd do
something for him, didn't I?

95
00:06:22,984 --> 00:06:26,068
Yes, you did.
Of Course, if you want to do my errand...

96
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,525
No, you do your own work, Cole.

97
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:30,769
Will you buy us that drink
a couple of hours from now?

98
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,868
Yeah, sure will.

99
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,115
Where is this Bart Jason's place?

100
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:37,576
You take the main road
north out of town.

101
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:40,535
And after you cross the creek,
and you come to a big rock.

102
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,379
Big rock.

103
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:43,906
That's right. That's
MacDonald's boundary.

104
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:45,789
MacDonald's?
Yeah.

105
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,672
You ride east from there about 3 miles
and you get to Bart Jason's ranch.

106
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,796
Maudie, remember, I'm coming back.

107
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,717
Oh, I left some things...
I'll take care of it.

108
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,801
Thanks.

109
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:07,480
You mad at me, JP?
You know better than that, Maudie.

110
00:07:07,568 --> 00:07:09,607
Ha... you must like that man.

111
00:07:09,736 --> 00:07:13,022
Want me to tell you about him?
You don't have to tell me about Cole.

112
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:17,112
I know I don't.
That's why I want to.

113
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:21,531
I met Cole right after my husband
was killed. I did tell you that.

114
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:25,572
Yeah, you told me.
Well, there I was, stranded...

115
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:29,796
A gambler's widow,
not a chip to my name.

116
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:35,166
Cole was awful good to me. Gave me
a stake, helped me get on my feet.

117
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:38,261
Never would take a...

118
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:42,968
(SIGHS) I don't know, JP.
With Cole and me, I guess it's a...

119
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:46,428
I'll always think of him as a...
He's a top hand.

120
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:52,475
I guess so.
Yeah, well, Cole always was pretty lucky.

121
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:54,046
Have you known
him a long time?

122
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:56,845
Yeah, I've known him a long
time, since before the war.

123
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,280
We've... ah... traveled some together.
Sure, I know what that means.

124
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,245
It means either you saved his life,
or he saved yours, or both.

125
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,583
And neither of you
will talk about it... Men!

126
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:14,501
Would you like it set to music,
Maudie, with a full orchestra?

127
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,587
Well, I'll see you, Maudie.
Hey, don't forget to come back!

128
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:21,335
Well, I'm certainly not going
to leave you alone with him.

129
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:22,491
You're not a friend.

130
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:30,763

Howdy, Roy. Something wrong?

134

Doc Miller sent me out, said to tell you
Bart Jason hired himself a gunhand:

135
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:06,803
Cole Thornton. And Thorton rode
out there about an hour ago.

136
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:09,558
Doc wanted you to know. He said
to tell you to be careful.

137
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:13,141
Thanks, Roy. Tell Doc I'm
much obliged to both of you.

West Fork and tell Jared

140
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:24,012
to get back to the ranch
as soon as he can.

give us a little warning.

All right, Pa.
Wait a minute, I ain't finished yet...

146

As soon as you fire that shot, you jump
on your horse and hightail it, you hear!

304
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,937
Cole's lighting out...
he's leaving tonight.

305
00:24:06,952 --> 00:24:09,822
You got any objections, Doc,
I don't want to hear 'em.

306
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:13,372
I'm Glad to get you off my hands...
Where you going?

307
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,367
Sonora.

308
00:24:16,086 --> 00:24:19,419
Folks down there got a silver mine...
a little trouble.

309
00:24:19,506 --> 00:24:21,545
Think I might be of help.

310
00:24:21,716 --> 00:24:25,049
Well, I brung along a little red-eye,
in case the sheriff runs out.

311
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:27,294
Somehow, I reckon he has.

312
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:30,223
Been here a long time,
nobody's offered me a drink.

313
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:33,178
Well, why didn't you speak up, Bull?
Thought you'd never ask.

314
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:37,397
Maudie, get him a glass, will you?
Well, what'll we drink to first?

315
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,810
Maudie...

316
00:24:40,317 --> 00:24:43,401
I guess I should have told you.

317
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,902
Hmh... Cole, sometimes you...

318
00:24:51,546 --> 00:24:53,536
♪ (GUITAR) ♪

319
00:24:55,582 --> 00:24:59,200
I was hoping to see
you alone before you left.

320
00:24:59,377 --> 00:25:03,540
It's better this way, Maudie.
Come back, will you?

321
00:25:03,631 --> 00:25:08,008
I will when...
When you can forget Luke MacDonald?

322
00:25:08,093 --> 00:25:12,471
When you can look at the other MacDonalds
and not... not feel you owe them?

323
00:25:13,265 --> 00:25:16,432
Pretty wise for a kid, Maudie.

324
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:21,982
I think you must be the only person
who thinks of me as a kid, Cole.

325
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,230
I reckon I really don't.

326
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:26,899
Please don't.

327
00:25:35,411 --> 00:25:37,866
I'll see you, Maudie.

328
00:25:57,929 --> 00:25:59,819
♪

329
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,359
Hey!

330
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,399
That the way you make your living?

331
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,737
By golly, Cole,
it sure is good to see you.

332
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,493
What sheriff had to hire you
for a deputy?

333
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,948
You're looking
at him. Hi ya, Cole!

334
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,494
Dodd Draper!
The last time I saw you two,

335
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:27,496
you were ten jumps ahead of a
posse raisin' dust for Mexico.

336
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,146
Hey, heard you got shot.

337
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:32,361
Yeah, but that was six
or seven months ago.

338
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:35,377
How about supper?
And I'll buy you a beer, too.

339
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,710
We'd like to, but we're working men.

340
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:41,594
How about that cantina up the street?
Good place to eat?

341
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,932
Good as any. You sticking around?
Day or two.

342
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:47,889
Well, we'll see you later, Cole.

343
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:51,858
Señor...

344
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:54,147
your dinner will be ready
in one minute.

345
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:55,148
Gee Sevas, Gracias...

346
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:14,087
Buena Noches Señoras

347
00:27:14,288 --> 00:27:17,338
Bring something to eat, comidas...
Plenty of it Si Señor.

348
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:19,880
Right away.
Something to drink, also, vamanos.

349
00:27:21,964 --> 00:27:24,764
Señor?

350
00:27:24,765 --> 00:27:26,722
A Five and a one.

351
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,955
Charlie Hagan.
Yeah.

352
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:39,330
You want something from me?

353
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:43,372
You don't remember me, do you?
No.

354
00:28:47,176 --> 00:28:48,496
Do you remember this hat?

355
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:51,904
Well, why in the hell would I
remember a hat? (LAUGHTER)

356
00:28:55,226 --> 00:28:58,096
You killed the man
that was wearing it

357
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:00,347
Ladies.

358
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:01,564
Si, Señor, si

359
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:04,981
Who was this fellow I killed?
A friend of yours?

360
00:29:05,068 --> 00:29:06,978
You could say that.

361
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:12,610
When did I do this, boy?
Two years ago, come September.

362
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,073
You and three others.

363
00:29:15,161 --> 00:29:18,660
Natchez-Under-the-Hill,
on the Mississippi.

364
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:25,917
He was a gambler, named Johnny Diamond...
and he was kind of an old man.

365
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:32,009
Shouldn't have taken four of you.
Do you remember, Charlie?

366
00:29:32,094 --> 00:29:35,593
I remember. He was a cardsharp.
He was cheating.

367
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:39,429
No... no, he was good.
He didn't have to cheat.

368
00:29:39,518 --> 00:29:44,096
It shouldn't have taken 4 of you, Joey.
No, it shouldn't of.

369
00:29:44,898 --> 00:29:49,892
Well, I'm sure glad you remember, Mr.
Hagan. The other three did.

370
00:29:50,403 --> 00:29:54,697
The other three?
Yeah, I caught up with them.

371
00:29:55,408 --> 00:29:57,780
You're the last.

372
00:30:00,246 --> 00:30:02,452
And now I think you better stand up.

373
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,786
Stand up, Charlie.
I'm curious to see how he does this.

374
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:09,042
He doesn't have a gun.

375
00:30:09,129 --> 00:30:13,079
And like he said, it shouldn't
have taken four of you.

376
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:20,089
Stand up, Charlie.

377
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,533
You with the hat.

378
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:55,298
You killed Charlie 'cause he
killed your friend, right?

379
00:30:56,257 --> 00:30:57,091
That's right.

380
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:59,622
Well, it happens, Charlie
was a good friend of mine.

381
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:01,942
So let's see you
do that trick twice.

382
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:03,973
(GUNSHOT WITH RICOCHET
AND GUN DROPPING)

383
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:09,308
I'd let it drop, friend.

384
00:31:09,436 --> 00:31:11,678
Me?
You.

385
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:14,104
(GUN DROPS TO FLOOR)

386
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:15,291
Hope you don't mind.

387
00:31:15,322 --> 00:31:17,304
Always seems to take
more than one doesn't it?

388
00:31:17,402 --> 00:31:19,609
That's because they're no good.

389
00:31:19,738 --> 00:31:22,407
Pick up your gun.
What?

390
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:27,076
You want to try again, now?
Pick up your gun.

391
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:35,582
Against him, or you?

392
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,828
Me first.
Why should you go first?

393
00:31:37,922 --> 00:31:39,961
Pick it up.
Now, just a second...

394
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:42,088
Tell me about it later!
I'll tell you now! -Shut up!

395
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:44,963
Go on. You were plenty willing
when you had a kid...

396
00:31:45,054 --> 00:31:48,837
Hold it! Don't get mad, mister.

397
00:31:49,016 --> 00:31:52,764
Before you start anything, I can't
afford to lose another man.

398
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,166
You promise to
take Milt's place?

399
00:31:55,197 --> 00:31:57,713
You got a lot of faith
in me, don't you, Nelse?

400
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:03,655
Faith can move mountains, Milt,
but it can't beat a faster draw.

401
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:07,901
There's only three men I
know with his kind of speed.

402
00:32:08,034 --> 00:32:13,372
One's dead, the other's me,
and the third is Cole Thornton.

403
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:15,578
There's a fourth.

404
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:19,284
Which one are you?
I'm Thornton.

405
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:24,504
Aren't you glad you
didn't try, Milt?

406
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:28,880
Pick up your guns, both of you.
Real easy.

407
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,054
Like he said, real easy.

408
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,840
And take him out of here.

409
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:48,312
Thornton, I'd like to talk to you.
I'm Nelse McLeod.

410
00:32:48,405 --> 00:32:51,988
I thought so. Pretty far
off your range, aren't you?

411
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:54,068
A little. Can I buy you a drink?

412
00:32:54,161 --> 00:32:56,367
Why not?
You, too.

413
00:32:56,538 --> 00:32:58,412
Glasses.

414
00:32:58,498 --> 00:33:00,906
You working now, Thornton?
No.

415
00:33:01,168 --> 00:33:04,750
Is it all right if music play now Señor?
Yeah, sure.

416
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:06,451
Muchachos, musica...

417
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,133
You say you're not working. What would
you say if I tried to hire you on?

418
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,044
First I'd ask about the money.
Money's good.

419
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:17,262
Then I'd ask about the job.

420
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,840
Well, good evening.
Thanks for the drink, gentlemen.

421
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:23,933
Just a minute, son.
I am not your son.

422
00:33:24,106 --> 00:33:27,771
My name is Alan Bourdillion Traherne.

423
00:33:27,943 --> 00:33:30,232
Lord Almighty.
Yeah.

424
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,692
That's why most people call me
Mississippi.

425
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:35,616
Mississippi?
I was born on the river in a flat boat.

426
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,867
You're pretty good with that knife.
Can you use a gun?

427
00:33:38,995 --> 00:33:43,456
If I could, I'd be using one.
Good evening.

428
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,913
Just a minute, Mississippi.

429
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:50,035
Would you mind telling me why you have
such a great passion for my company?

430
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:53,250
Will you just relax
for a couple of minutes?

431
00:33:53,342 --> 00:33:55,418
You were telling me
about the job.

432
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:58,381
There's a little range war
up in the El Dorado country.

433
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:01,965
El Dorado? Mind telling
me who hired you?

434
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:05,890
Fellow named Bart Jason.
Do you know him?

435
00:34:05,979 --> 00:34:10,973
We met. He offered me the job a few
months back. I didn't take it.

436
00:34:11,943 --> 00:34:14,101
Do you know who
you're up against?

437
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:17,030
Yeah. The sheriff, JP Harrah.

438
00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:19,652
I understand he used to be
pretty good with a gun.

439
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:22,992
Not just pretty good, McLeod.
He's the...

440
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:26,779
The fourth man you told me about.
That's right.

441
00:34:26,957 --> 00:34:29,495
Well, he used to be.
He's not any more.

442
00:34:29,627 --> 00:34:32,960
Well, what happened?
What usually happens to a man?

443
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:34,873
A woman.

444
00:34:34,965 --> 00:34:39,176
Seems like he tangled with some wandering
petticoat... he's been drunk ever since.

445
00:34:39,928 --> 00:34:44,637
You figure to move in before he sobers
up, or... before they get a new sheriff?

446
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:48,684
And you're not coming in?
No.

447
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,474
I suppose you have your reasons.

448
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,774
It's probably just as well.

449
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:57,267
With two like us in
the same bunch...

450
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,397
sooner or later we'd have to find
out which one of us was faster.

451
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:05,411
Yeah, I guess you're right.

452
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:09,035
So long, Thornton.

453
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:13,741
I thought we were going.

454
00:35:14,628 --> 00:35:17,000
Mississippi, just listen.

455
00:35:18,131 --> 00:35:23,089
McLeod, would you like to walk out
that door first, ahead of us?

456
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:26,386
Nope. I don't believe I would.

457
00:35:26,597 --> 00:35:29,717
I didn't think so.

458
00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:32,807
Pedro, Milt, can you hear me?

459
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,720
We hear you.
I'm coming out.

460
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:40,503
Where are you?

461
00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:44,942
Jeffe... over here.
Come on out.

462
00:35:49,244 --> 00:35:51,532
Further into the light, hurry.

463
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:55,615
Now drop your guns.

464
00:36:01,756 --> 00:36:03,795
Come here.

465
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,009
Inside.

466
00:36:12,057 --> 00:36:15,426
That all right, Thornton?
Good enough.

467
00:36:15,602 --> 00:36:18,473
Mississippi, get their guns.

468
00:36:18,647 --> 00:36:22,691
If it's all right with you, McLeod,
we'll drop 'em at the sheriff's office

469
00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:25,979
and your boys can pick 'em
up on their way out of town.

470
00:36:26,154 --> 00:36:29,986
Sounds reasonable.
Much obliged.

471
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:32,773
Call it professional courtesy.

472
00:36:42,628 --> 00:36:44,667
Want to get something
to eat, Mississippi?

473
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:48,496
Mr. Thornton, I would've walked
out of here and right into

474
00:36:48,527 --> 00:36:50,455
those two fellas if you
hadn't stopped me.

475
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,546
I asked if you were hungry.
I'm trying to thank you.

476
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:57,422
I'm hungry! That shivaree you put
on in there interrupted my supper.

477
00:36:57,517 --> 00:36:59,556
It wore out our welcome.

478
00:36:59,644 --> 00:37:01,886
Now, we'll have to find
someplace else to eat.

479
00:37:02,063 --> 00:37:05,396
Now?
Now.

480
00:37:18,021 --> 00:37:20,121
¿Que quieres mas?

481
00:37:20,122 --> 00:37:22,363
She wants to know
if you want something else.

482
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:25,122
Just coffee.

483
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:26,123
Café, por favor.

484
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:33,545
Not very hungry huh?
No, not so much.

485
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:38,548
A little green around the gills.
Yep.

486
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:41,468
I just finished something tonight
I've been two years doing.

487
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:45,805
What are you figuring on doing next?
Going back to the river?

488
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:50,019
I haven't thought much about
what I'm going to do next.

489
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:52,231
The river won't be
the same without old...

490
00:37:52,402 --> 00:37:56,530
Well, if you're going to stay around here,
I've got two pieces of advice for you...

491
00:37:56,615 --> 00:38:00,992
Get rid of that hat.
Learn how to use a gun.

492
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:03,542
I don't figure on
gettin' rid of that hat.

493
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:04,650
No?

494
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:06,829
No.

495
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,504
Johnny Diamond, he's the friend I...
ah... the man that raised me.

496
00:38:14,298 --> 00:38:20,217
All he left behind was
a gold watch and this hat.

497
00:38:20,387 --> 00:38:25,298
I had to sell that gold watch
a year or so back.

498
00:38:25,475 --> 00:38:29,343
So, I guess
I'll just hang on to that hat.

499
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:32,729
What about learning to use a gun?

500
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:35,728
Johnny didn't believe in guns.
He always thought that...

501
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:38,523
He's dead. Think about that.

502
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:43,025
Unless you can learn to
stay out of trouble.

503
00:38:43,117 --> 00:38:47,411
That's one thing even old Johnny
couldn't teach me to do.

504
00:38:47,496 --> 00:38:51,825
Well, I'll be moving along.
Good luck to you.

505
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:55,746
Ah... you don't suppose
I could ride along with ya?

506
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:58,590
Nope.
That's plain enough.

507
00:38:58,674 --> 00:39:01,210
Well, I hope everything
works out all right.

508
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:02,561
What works out?

509
00:39:03,178 --> 00:39:05,420
Whatever it is you're going to do.

510
00:39:06,598 --> 00:39:09,883
Pay for the meal, will you?
So long.

511
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:17,679
♪

512
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,253
Hold it, Cochise.

513
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:54,516
Steady boy. lt'll take a minute.

514
00:40:10,427 --> 00:40:13,027
Cole! Cole Thornton!

515
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,367
Where are you?

516
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,323
Close enough to blow your hat off
if I hadn't 'a recognised it.

517
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:33,554
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.

518
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,339
Don't you know better than
to follow a man that way?

519
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:40,388
Sorry, I don't know there's another way.
You almost got shot.

520
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,438
You fall off your horse?
Yeah.

521
00:40:43,523 --> 00:40:45,231
You hurt?
No.

522
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,356
Well, there's something
the matter with you.

523
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:49,173
Well look, I've got a
bullet in my back,

524
00:40:49,204 --> 00:40:51,624
sometimes it presses
against something and...

525
00:40:52,198 --> 00:40:54,541
I get a screaming pain,
then there's nothing...

526
00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:57,218
it goes numb, and I
can't use this hand.

527
00:40:57,286 --> 00:40:58,671
How long does that last?

528
00:40:58,702 --> 00:41:01,528
Just for a while. Why
are you following me?

529
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:05,490
Well, I got to thinkin' about
what you're going to do.

530
00:41:06,295 --> 00:41:08,334
And just what am I gonna do?

531
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:11,429
You're going to that
town, El Dorado, to help

532
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,205
your friend against
McLeod and his bunch.

533
00:41:14,302 --> 00:41:16,972
How do you know
he's my friend?

534
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,094
That look on your face when you
heard he'd turned into a drunk.

535
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:24,508
Well, this thing's wearing off.

536
00:41:24,604 --> 00:41:27,095
Give me a hand
up on my horse.

537
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:33,773
You sure your friend's
worth helping?

538
00:41:33,988 --> 00:41:39,029
You just spent two years chasing some
fellas that killed a friend of yours.

539
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:42,368
You think your friend
was worth two years?

540
00:41:42,454 --> 00:41:46,582
I guess I asked a fool question.
You did.

541
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:07,016
Give him a breather.
Slow him down.

542
00:42:07,103 --> 00:42:11,764
I was wondering.
Just how good is this McLeod?

543
00:42:11,982 --> 00:42:17,522
I don't know first hand, but
they say he's one of the best.

544
00:42:17,696 --> 00:42:20,527
I figure he'd be pretty mad you...
you turning

545
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:23,147
him down and showing-up
on the other side.

546
00:42:23,201 --> 00:42:26,285
I hope he is.
How come?

547
00:42:26,454 --> 00:42:29,704
Fellow in his business
hasn't got a right to get mad.

548
00:42:29,874 --> 00:42:32,495
He gets mad,
he's not so good.

549
00:42:32,585 --> 00:42:35,752
So the madder he gets,
the better I like it.

550
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:38,590
Ha! Sure wish I was
there to see that.

551
00:42:38,674 --> 00:42:41,509
Why do you want to keep
sticking your nose in this?

552
00:42:41,594 --> 00:42:44,927
Maybe I could help.
You saved my life two times.

553
00:42:45,013 --> 00:42:48,513
But I'm going to be too busy
to keep doing that.

554
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,102
You can't even use a gun.

555
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:53,375
You could teach me. I
need somebody to teach me.

556
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:55,929
Johnny Diamond always
told me to get the best.

557
00:42:56,024 --> 00:43:00,152
Well, he was right there.
But you're not going to El Dorado.

558
00:43:00,236 --> 00:43:04,103
Oh, I'm not, huh?
No, you're not.

559
00:43:07,076 --> 00:43:10,990
"Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,"

560
00:43:11,205 --> 00:43:15,333
"In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long..."

561
00:43:15,501 --> 00:43:17,956
What's that all about?
Just a poem.

562
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:20,084
One of Johnny Diamond's favorites.

563
00:43:20,172 --> 00:43:23,126
Let's see: "Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight",

564
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:28,175
"In sunshine and in shadow, Had
journeyed long, singing a song,"

565
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:31,175
"In search of El Dorado."

566
00:43:31,266 --> 00:43:36,342
"Over the mountains of the moon,
Down the valley of the shadow,"

567
00:43:36,437 --> 00:43:39,272
"Ride, boldly ride..."

568
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:44,315
Always liked that poem, too.
Makes me want to ah...

569
00:43:44,403 --> 00:43:49,148
Ride, boldly ride?
Well, it don't work out that way.

570
00:43:49,241 --> 00:43:51,399
I'm learning that.

571
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:01,329
Oh, Hell! Hold it, Cochise.

572
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,289
Step down off that horse.
You always giving people orders?

573
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:16,766
You wanted to learn to shoot.

574
00:44:25,234 --> 00:44:27,273
Right out there.

575
00:44:30,697 --> 00:44:34,825
Hold it, Mississippi.
That's no way to use a handgun.

576
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,968
You gotta to draw and
fire, and you gotta be

577
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:39,209
quicker than somebody else
doing the same thing.

578
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,279
Like this.

579
00:44:43,376 --> 00:44:45,333
I see.

580
00:44:51,092 --> 00:44:55,385
How's that?
Were you aiming at that cholla?

581
00:44:56,805 --> 00:45:01,716
No, the place you were shooting at.
'Fraid it's useless.

582
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:08,271
Well, we'll be passing through Cuervo.
I'll have a talk with the Swede.

583
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:10,516
Who's the Swede?

584
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:13,861
An old friend of mine... a gunsmith.
Aah!

585
00:45:19,994 --> 00:45:22,033
There's the place.

586
00:45:33,307 --> 00:45:35,007
Why, Cole Thornton!

587
00:45:35,008 --> 00:45:39,337
Swede, good to see you.
And what brings you around here?

588
00:45:39,429 --> 00:45:44,387
Well, I'm looking for a gun for a fella
that can't shoot... Mississippi.

589
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:46,385
Swede Larson.

590
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,456
Can you help us?

591
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:50,422
Yaha, I think, I've got just
the gun you're looking for.

592
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,438
Well good!

593
00:45:54,373 --> 00:45:55,483
Wow!

594
00:45:56,487 --> 00:46:00,105
How wide will that shot spread?
Well, now... I mean, how big a pattern?

595
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:04,072
I don't know. The fellow who used it
before, he couldn't see too good.

596
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,866
He just shoot where he hear
somebody talk.

597
00:46:06,955 --> 00:46:10,406
What happened to him?
He has a fight in a saloon.

598
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,620
The piano player
he make so much noise,

599
00:46:13,712 --> 00:46:17,330
he couldn't hear the other man, so
he just shoot the piano player,

600
00:46:17,423 --> 00:46:19,463
and they hung him.

601
00:46:19,551 --> 00:46:22,717
Looks pretty good to me.
Shoots good, too.

602
00:46:22,804 --> 00:46:24,962
How about ammunition?

603
00:46:25,056 --> 00:46:28,756
Four or five boxes ought to be enough.
Good.

604
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:31,834
Well, Mississippi, looks
like what you need.

605
00:46:31,865 --> 00:46:32,925
It sure is!

606
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:37,274
Pay the man... Swede.
Cole, you come back soon.

607
00:46:41,947 --> 00:46:45,363
A likely spot to
try that new gun.

608
00:46:54,834 --> 00:46:56,873
Try that cactus.

I've got to say to you but,

631
00:49:07,006 --> 00:49:09,730
first I've got to
have some answers.

No, no, I'd have known if there were.

This one you'd have noticed:

634
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,176

with a scar here and a marled eye.

After you left,
I didn't see much of him.

642

Oh, he'd drop in for a drink once
in a while. I guess he was lonely.

just stepped off the stage and...

Well, you know how kind...

645
00:49:53,379 --> 00:49:58,420
Yeah, she probably had big sad eyes and
a long sad story. That's his type.

646
00:49:58,508 --> 00:50:02,921
Yeah. She was no good. I tried
to tell him, so did others.

647
00:50:03,013 --> 00:50:06,547
Bull told him
and he knocked Bull down.

648

So JP had found out the hard way.
She ran off with a drummer.

00:50:11,437 --> 00:50:14,521
He's... he's not been sober since.
It's been about two months.

650
00:50:14,607 --> 00:50:17,774
Well, that he's going
to have to get over in a hurry.

651
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,396
Is he over at the jail?

652
00:50:19,427 --> 00:50:22,766
He's still sheriff,
though I don't know why.

653

a room for Mississippi and me?

eaten anything lately?

been trying to figure out...

Well, a bunch of men on horseback
came flying around the bend and...

1228

What was the idea of diving
under those horses?

Diving under those horses?

Yeah, a man can't shoot good

that bullet out of your back?

someone better than me to get it out.

and moved toward the spine.

A little higher.

Uh ha.

This may hurt.
It did.

1251
01:36:59,687 --> 01:37:02,723
That's very odd.
Tell me does it hurt here?

1252
01:37:02,815 --> 01:37:04,938
No.
Doctor...

1253
01:37:05,025 --> 01:37:07,101
Just a minute, sheriff.

1254
01:37:07,194 --> 01:37:10,360
What do you think, Charles?
It's a challenge, isn't it?

1255
01:37:10,447 --> 01:37:15,239
I reckon he's got a more interesting
misery than you got, sheriff.

1256
01:37:15,327 --> 01:37:19,406
Look, Doctor, I don't want to take up your
time, but ah, mine's still bleeding.

1257
01:37:19,497 --> 01:37:22,533
You've got nothing to worry about, sherrif,
it's a good clean wound.

1258
01:37:22,625 --> 01:37:24,785
Tell me, it's giving
you trouble, isn't it?

1259
01:37:24,816 --> 01:37:26,190
Well, I wouldn't say...

1260
01:37:26,254 --> 01:37:30,465
Why don't you tell him the truth?
I can guess.

1261
01:37:30,549 --> 01:37:33,012
I can guess, there's a sudden
spasm of pain in this area

1262
01:37:33,043 --> 01:37:35,288
followed paralysis of one
side, probably the right.

1263
01:37:35,346 --> 01:37:36,495
Oh, it doesn't last very long.

1264
01:37:36,526 --> 01:37:38,709
But it lasts a little
longer each time, doesn't it?

1265
01:37:38,765 --> 01:37:40,805
What are you trying to tell him, Doctor?

1266
01:37:40,892 --> 01:37:43,054
That if he doesn't get that
bullet out of there, one of these

1267
01:37:43,085 --> 01:37:45,002
times he'll have an attack
and it won't just pass off.

1268
01:37:45,063 --> 01:37:47,934
McLeod may settle the whole problem for us.

1269
01:37:48,024 --> 01:37:51,891
But if I'm here after this is all over,
I'll come and see you, Doc, I promise.

1270
01:37:51,986 --> 01:37:55,936
You do that.
Now, Doctors, if you please.

1271
01:37:56,032 --> 01:37:59,317
Could you come here,
so I can rest my finger?

1272
01:37:59,410 --> 01:38:01,237
Surely, sheriff.

1273
01:38:20,525 --> 01:38:22,565
JP, why don't you settle down?

1274

Ahh, four or five days.

01:39:04,263 --> 01:39:07,466

Plenty of coffee and water.

1291
01:39:08,351 --> 01:39:12,218
Ah Bull, do you suppose you could you slip
out that back door and bring us some food?

Without getting shot?
I wish you would.

to do, get shot or get food.

Want me to go with ya?

1295

Yeah, if I get shot, you
can bring back the food.

And I'm also going
to bring back a big bar of soap.

02:02:30,306 --> 02:02:32,395
Why don't you tell her
why you're wearin' it?

1651
02:02:32,426 --> 02:02:34,286
Don't have to, I've
already told her

1652
02:02:34,435 --> 02:02:38,563
She's madder 'n a wet hen. Said you
let her make a fool of herself.

1653
02:02:38,648 --> 02:02:43,226
Ah, a host of friends...
I have a host of friends!

1654
02:02:43,319 --> 02:02:45,810
And, I'm sorry about that leg...
Forget it.

1655
02:02:46,113 --> 02:02:49,363
Yeah. I'll see you.

1656
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:53,825
Mr. Thornton, that'll be a little sore
for a few days, but it'll be all right.

1657
02:02:53,856 --> 02:02:54,734
Yeah...

1658
02:02:54,765 --> 02:02:56,481
I Hope you have time
to let me fix your back.

1659
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:59,196
Well, just as soon as
this leg heals, Doc.

1660
02:02:59,227 --> 02:03:00,553
I'll be ready.

1661
02:03:02,671 --> 02:03:07,747
Hey, Cole, where's Maudie?
I was wondering about that too.

1662
02:03:07,926 --> 02:03:11,590
I left her down the street just
before this ruckus started.

1663
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:13,921
Ah, she'll probably
be around pretty soon.

1664
02:03:14,140 --> 02:03:16,465
Well, I wouldn't count
on that too much.

1665
02:03:16,642 --> 02:03:19,643
I just talked to her down at her place.
Well?

1666
02:03:19,728 --> 02:03:23,560
If'n you was running for president,
I figure, you wouldn't get her vote.

1667
02:03:23,649 --> 02:03:25,688
Well, what did I do?

1668
02:03:25,776 --> 02:03:29,476
Well, she said she was plum
through waitin' on a man...

1669
02:03:29,571 --> 02:03:31,816
whilst he's runnin'
around being a target for

1670
02:03:31,847 --> 02:03:33,895
anybody that had a
notion to shoot a gun.

1671
02:03:33,950 --> 02:03:36,488
Said she couldn't take it no more.
She said that?

1672
02:03:36,578 --> 02:03:40,196
Yeah, she said that, and she
added a few frills and dressing.

1673
02:03:40,331 --> 02:03:43,746
The main idea was,
the door was closed.

1674
02:03:43,751 --> 02:03:46,609
Well!
(JP WHISTLES)

1675
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:49,627
Well Cole, what are you going to do?
What can I do?

1676
02:03:49,715 --> 02:03:51,791
Can't argue with a closed door.

1677
02:03:51,884 --> 02:03:54,553
Glad to hear you say that.
Better just drop the whole thing.

1678
02:03:54,584 --> 02:03:55,676
Well what can I...

1679
02:03:55,707 --> 02:03:57,786
Some other fool would just go down
there and try talking her out of it.

1680
02:03:57,848 --> 02:03:59,418
You can get into a lot
of trouble with women

1681
02:03:59,449 --> 02:04:00,879
like that. Remember
what happened to me.

1682
02:04:00,934 --> 02:04:03,935
You tryin' to say that I'm in
the same mess you were?

1683
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:05,728
Why no, I didn't
say that, Cole.

1684
02:04:05,814 --> 02:04:08,518
You think I'm gonna make a
fool out of myself like you did?

1685
02:04:08,608 --> 02:04:11,977
Cole, you told me yourself, you cannot
stand to be tied down in one place.

1686
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:14,366
How do you know I haven't
had enough of running

1687
02:04:14,397 --> 02:04:16,596
around selling my gun
arm all over the place.

1688
02:04:16,657 --> 02:04:18,697
You said yourself sittin'
right here on this desk that...

1689
02:04:18,784 --> 02:04:21,026
Don't put words in my mouth...
I'm not putting words in your mouth!

1690
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:25,497
And if I'm gonna have somebody tell me
about women, it isn't going to be you.

1691
02:04:25,583 --> 02:04:27,741
Where is Maudie?
Down at her place.

1692
02:04:27,835 --> 02:04:30,041
That's my crutch.
Well, where's the other one?

1693
02:04:30,129 --> 02:04:32,417
Right over there,
right under your nose.

1694
02:04:32,589 --> 02:04:35,792
I can't make up my own mind!
You got it under the wrong arm, Cole.

1695
02:04:36,468 --> 02:04:42,091
Well, how would you know? You've been using
it first under one arm and then the other.

1696
02:04:42,223 --> 02:04:47,265
Fine friend! Trying to keep a fellow
from doing what he wants to do.

1697
02:04:47,764 --> 02:04:49,824
(JP LAUGHS)

1698
02:04:49,939 --> 02:04:53,023
I reckon' the way to get him to do
something is to tell him not to do it.

1699
02:04:53,109 --> 02:04:55,232
Not if he didn't want to
do it in the first place.

1700
02:04:55,319 --> 02:04:58,106
Reckon he'll stay here?
Yeah, could be.

1701
02:04:58,197 --> 02:05:00,866
Be a good thing to have him here.

1702
02:05:00,949 --> 02:05:05,077
Suppose you'll likely to wait a bit,
find a new gal,

1703
02:05:05,162 --> 02:05:07,404
make a fool of yourself
all over again.

1704
02:05:07,497 --> 02:05:11,246
Most likely. If you leave me,
Bull, I could be driven to it.

1705
02:05:11,334 --> 02:05:14,205
Well, I ain't said I was gonna leave ya.
You as much as said it.

1706
02:05:14,295 --> 02:05:16,621
Now, stop putting
words in my mouth.

1707
02:05:16,714 --> 02:05:20,379
I just can't do anything right
according to you. Bull, I need you.

1708
02:05:20,468 --> 02:05:22,793
You what?
I need you, Bull.

1709
02:05:22,887 --> 02:05:26,090
Well, now if you start being nice
to me, I'll quit you for sure.

1710
02:05:26,182 --> 02:05:30,511
Shock'd be too much. I'd as sooner
have you hungover and nasty.

1711
02:05:30,603 --> 02:05:34,600
Speaking of that,
how about a little drink, Bull?

1712
02:05:35,899 --> 02:05:39,600
Darn it! Took you a long time
to think of that one.

1713
02:05:41,697 --> 02:05:46,026
That was good work, sheriff.
Thank you, friend.

1714
02:05:46,117 --> 02:05:50,660
Sheriff, it looks like
you're going to keep your job.

1715
02:05:50,747 --> 02:05:54,531
Yeah, it'll be a nice quiet town
after you leave, Cole.

1716
02:05:54,625 --> 02:05:56,867
How do you know I'm leaving?

1717
02:05:56,961 --> 02:06:00,460
We just don't need
your kind around here.

1718
02:06:01,142 --> 02:06:02,982
