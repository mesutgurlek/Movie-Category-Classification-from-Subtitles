Fales is ambitious,

00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,992
They will take him
to a battlefield.

483
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,031
Do you know which one?

484
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,617
I have a good guess.

485
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,290
Oral tradition says

486
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,998
that the last dog soldier
in this part of the country

487
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,508
fought his last battle
near copley flats.

488
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,545
[Singing in native language]

489
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,213
He had five warriors with him.

490
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,725
An army of 100 white men
surrounded them.

491
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,812
They fought to the death.

492
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,276
I think that is where
they will take David.

493
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,904
Sam poteet.

494
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,824

00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,587
I can't let you do that.

497
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,506
I understand you need
to bury a fallen brother,

498
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,681
and I promise you
I will let you in due time.

499
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,227
But today, I need him.

500
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,670
I can't have that.
Not now.

501
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,209
And you do not need it.

502
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,630
Is that him?

503
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,843
Yeah.
That's a.D.A. Sloan.

504
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,642

505
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,432
Why is he here?

506
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,032
Hello, miss longmire.

507
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,789
Mr. Sloan, thank you
for making the trip.

508
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,993
Detective fales, I'm surprised
to see you here.

509
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,036
When I heard
Henry standing bear

510
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,001
was going
to make a statement,

511
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,382
I just couldn't pass up
the opportunity

512
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,713
or one of his burgers.

513
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:25,174
Sloan: Detective fales
is my chief investigator.

514
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,964
Do you have any objection
to his presence?

515
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,799
No. It's fine.

516
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,565
Why don't you both
sit there?

517
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,154
The sheriff
is gonna join us.

518
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,073
Do you have any objection
to his presence?

519
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,575
Actually --
before you answer that,

520
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,616
I have a confession
of my own to make.

521
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,702
Henry's not making
a statement.

522
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,408
Do you know how long
of a drive we made?

523
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,745
About five hours, give or take.

524
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,879
Why are we here,
miss longmire?

525
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,506
Two weeks ago,
Mr. Sloan said

526
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,043
that he would take
the death penalty off the table

527
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,506
if my client
pled guilty.

528
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:06,921
I'd like to make
a counter offer.

529
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,304
I know you're not
terribly experienced,

530
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,932
but we're not interested
in any counter offer.

531
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,308
I listened to your offer.

532
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,593
The least you can do
is listen to hers.

533
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,014
Fine. What?

534
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,855
We will sign a binding agreement
right here,

535
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,279
stating that we will not bring
a civil suit against your office

536
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:28,234
if you agree to drop all charges
against Henry today.

537
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,069
What universe
are you living in?!

538
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,658
don't get emotional,
Mr. Sloan.

539
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,330
My daughter's
not done talking.

540
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:39,912
You see, Mr. Sloan,
the Denver police

541
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,921
had key physical evidence
in this case,

542
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,423
and they suppressed it.

543
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,380
Oh, this is
my favorite part.

544
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,714
Excuse me?

545
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,095
The part when the trial date
is so close

546
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:52,975
and the client is so guilty
that the lawyer just starts

547
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,602
throwing wads of toilet
paper at the ceiling

548
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,388
to see if she can't get one
to stick.

549
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,315
No toilet paper
in this case.

550
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:05,354
Just a feather found in the
victim's mouth and, in fact,

551
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,656
listed on your initial
search warrant.

552
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:11,531
A piece of random garbage
found in a shallow grave!

553
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,321
Shoved so far down
the victim's throat

554
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,746
that it's still there.

555
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,165
Sloan:
That white line?

556
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:28,211
The real thing is with
the corpse in our local morgue.

557
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,299
Cady: Along with the corpse
who put him there --

558
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,839
David ridges.

559
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:36,306
Oh, so, you finally trumped up
an alternate suspect!

560
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,845
Yes,
a man who put a feather

561
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,809
in the bullet wound
of a local deputy

562
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,815
and who very recently
attempted to murder my dad.

563
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,942
We actually have his car
impounded.

564
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:46,903
For a week and a half,

565
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,528
we've had crime-scene techs
from Cheyenne

566
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,531
combing over every inch
of that car.

567
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,866
And guess what?

568
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,830
They found a hair
that matched Miller Beck,

569
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:06,127
and they also found skin under
the fingernails of Mr. Beck

570
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:10,427
that matched the real
murderer -- David ridges.

571
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,504
Miller Beck fought back.

572
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,181
Scratched his assailant.

573

Walt:
That's a hard detail to miss,

574
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,850
especially for an experienced
detective like Mr. fales,

575
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,811
but when your autopsy
only lasts 14 minutes,

576
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:24,940
you miss a lot.

577
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,773
Cady: Anyway, yeah.

578
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:30,981
We can go to trial,
and all of this will come out,

579
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,238
and you will lose, and reporters
will write stories about it,

580
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,153
and then we'll sue you.

581
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,573
Or you can just drop
the charges today.

582
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,672
Walk me through the whole
feather thing again.

583

Your support helped Henry
get through this.

00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:11,271
And, well, Henry --
Henry should be here very soon.

585

As you can imagine,

586
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:16,322
news that all charges
against Henry have been dropped

587
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,909
is both wonderful
and overwhelming.

I'm just trying
to figure out

642
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:35,785
the exact nature
of your relationship

643
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,915
with a man I thought
was your sworn enemy.

644
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:41,078
Not when it came to getting you
elected sheriff.

645
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,211
What do you mean?

646
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,755
Well, I knew that

647
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:50,338
you wouldn't accept any campaign
money coming from me,

648
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:53,845
so I funneled it through
someone you wouldn't suspect.

649
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,975
Do I hate
the Indian bastard?

650
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,598
Yes.
But he can be useful.

651
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,934
I guess that explains why you
didn't get out of your car

652
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,815
to threaten nighthorse
in that video.

653
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:09,276
'Cause you weren't
really threatening him.

654
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:13,527
You're friends.
You were doing business.

655
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,821
You don't know what you're
talking about here, branch.

656
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,079
[Chuckles]

657
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:24,872
Three years ago, you paid
big pines timber $50,000.

658
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,173
What was that for?

659
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,546
Consulting service.

660
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:33,422
Dad,
that payment happened

661
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,677
the same week
Walt's wife died.

662
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:46,101
I've done a lot of things bad
over the years,

663
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:49,188
but I did every one of them
for our family.

664
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,612
We settled this county,

665
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,565
and we are going to be
the future of it,

666
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,740
whatever it takes.

667
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,909
So, you paid nighthorse,

668
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,664
and he sent ridges
down to Denver?

669
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,575
Nighthorse didn't have
the balls.

670
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:07,918
I paid him to borrow his soldier
just the one time.

671
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,008
No questions asked.

672
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,801
Branch, I did that
for our family.

673
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,427
I did it for you.

674
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:21,060
I wanted you to be sheriff,
and you deserved it.

675
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,096
Not that son of a bitch
longmire.

676
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:29,731
I wanted to be sheriff,
but not like that.

677
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,238
I'm not you.

678
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,810
I am so sorry.

679
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,777
I failed you, branch.

680
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,865
This is all my fault.

681
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,317
All of it.

682
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:24,950
[Sighs deeply]

683
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:34,672
But, you see, son,
I'm 65 years old.

684
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:39,131
Papa was dead at 70.
I-l just...

685
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:46,304
I don't have time
to make another fortune.

686
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:52,648
But I do have time
to make another son.

687
