00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:29,269
She ain't gonna like it.

170
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:34,141
Funny part...

171
00:12:35,843 --> 00:12:41,751
The more I get to know
her... the more...

172
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:44,386
You know.

173
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:57,565
[Sighs] A lesser woman would've
run off a long time ago, I guess.

174
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:01,203
What I've learned,
Mr. Bohannon...

175
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:06,841
Is that anything that springs up
between you and your woman...

176
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:09,774
You should rip it out by the root.

177
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:12,512
[Hooting in background]

178
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:15,084
Shh, shh, shh.

179
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:17,518
You hear that?

180
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:19,421
What?

181
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:24,462
Just past that rise...

182
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:28,634
There's Indian ponies with riders.

183
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:29,836
What are they doing?

184
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,771
Watching.

185
00:13:32,807 --> 00:13:36,041
They're always out here
lately at night.

186
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,546
They could slip up and slit
our throats any minute.

187
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,715
So why don't they then?

188
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:45,921
I don't know.

189
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:48,726
But I aim to find out.

190
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,503
I should have known
what they was doin'.

191
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,173
[Fly buzzing]

192
00:14:03,747 --> 00:14:07,716
There's always a reconnoitering
before a battle.

193
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:12,791
Why didn't you send
someone out yourself?

194
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:19,135
Anybody I would've sent out there
wouldn't have come back alive.

195
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:22,104
I couldn't spare the men,

196
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,139
the bridge was almost built.

197
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:27,341
Do you think you were
being shortsighted?

198
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,813
Them some nice shoes.

199
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:37,883
Clean.

200
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:42,685
Think you would've volunteered

201
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,921
to go out and scout a thousand Sioux?

202
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:49,557
[Chatter]

203
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:57,130
You riding out to the bridge?

204
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:59,500
I am.

205
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:02,871
It's quite a milestone for you.

206
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:05,504
It's a milestone for all of us.

207
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,306
Which makes it an ideal time

208
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,075
to talk about your
plans for the future.

209
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,441
Shall we?

210
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:28,526
[Chatter in background]

211
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:51,456
Don't you like New York?

212
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:55,429
I have found it's filled
with women like you.

213
00:15:55,464 --> 00:15:57,064
Ohh.

214
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,234
You think
I'm cruel. Hmm?

215
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:07,075
Tell me... what would
you do in my place?

216
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,314
Thomas will write you
a check and a letter

217
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:15,148
of introduction to a family
that's desperate for a governess.

218
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,081
A governess?

219
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:21,852
Please try and see this
in a positive light.

220
00:16:24,056 --> 00:16:26,390
It's a respectable family...

221
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:29,729
With plenty of marriageable young men.

222
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:38,066
I'm putting a very bright
future in your hands.

223
00:16:39,336 --> 00:16:40,803
Yes, you are.

224
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:42,536
Thank you.

225
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,155
Thank you for being the first one
to take her over, Mr. Bohannon.

226
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,481
There were no other
volunteers, skipper.

227
00:16:57,515 --> 00:16:59,282
Well, most folks ain't interested

228
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:01,150
in being crushed, boiled, or drowned.

229
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:02,818
Good luck, sir.

It's all right, Mr. Durant.

bearing to the track.

work ahead of us.

of drinks on Mr. Durant

waiting for you
at the starlight tonight!

We are still nowhere
near where we need to be.

255

How far did you
tell the board we were?

[Sighs]

257
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:29,131
Leave the men to their work.

Whoa. Easy, easy, easy.

closing the office.

Mr. Durant is down
at the bridge site.

Can I help you with something?

265
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,799
No, ma'am.

00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:56,269
You have a good day.

You, too.

268
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:34,948
It'd be nice to have some real walls,

269
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:37,785
keep out the cold, keep you warm.

270

If your looking for my
husband, he's at work.

00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:44,119
I know where he at.

272
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:46,958
Want to have that talk we was
going to have before you left.

273
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:49,562
I've been back a while now,

274
00:22:49,596 --> 00:22:51,330
how come this is the first
time you showed up?

275
00:22:51,364 --> 00:22:53,834
I got a surprise for you.

276
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:57,806
Surprises ain't been
good in my experience.

277
00:22:57,841 --> 00:22:59,275
This one is good.

278
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,312
For you and the baby.

279
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:05,652
You don't got to worry
about the baby no more.

280
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:09,423
Why you say that?

281
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:12,928
Because it's between me
and my husband now.

282
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:16,030
He's got a future on this railroad.

283
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:18,100
I heard you quit.

284
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,905
I'm on my own now.

285
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,576
I built us a house down by the river.

286
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:37,082
Fresh water, land...

287
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:39,520
Place where the baby can grow up.

288
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:45,060
A good solid floor and freedom...

289
00:23:46,495 --> 00:23:48,995
A fireplace that ain't that smoky.

290
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,264
Stop it.

291
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:52,668
All our love can live there.

292
00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:54,035
Can you stop it?

293
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:55,968
That ain't real.

294
00:23:56,003 --> 00:23:57,302
Yeah, it is.

295
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:59,436
No, it ain't.

296
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:02,536
And I got to pretend
that that don't exist.

297
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:06,407
Come on. Come on.

298
00:24:06,442 --> 00:24:08,906
No, I got mending to do.

299
00:24:10,642 --> 00:24:13,481
Mr. Toole would be real angry
if he knew you were here.

300
00:24:13,516 --> 00:24:16,450
You should probably go.

301
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:43,184
How would you like
to be a very rich man?

302
00:24:43,218 --> 00:24:46,085
Seen a lot of rich men
end up in shallow graves.

303
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,921
When the board arrives, they will see
that I have misled the government

304
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,323
on their behalf. [Sighs]

305
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:53,992
They will move against me.

306
00:24:54,027 --> 00:24:57,998
They may even try
to have me imprisoned.

307
00:24:58,032 --> 00:25:03,105
The railroad will likely fail and,
well, you'll be out of a job.

308
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:05,508
I've been in worse spots.

309
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:10,514
I am offering you
a full partnership...

310
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:14,648
If you will help me convince them

311
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:17,150
that everything we have
done has been necessary.

312
00:25:25,695 --> 00:25:27,631
Now, why would they believe me?

313
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:32,502
You are an interesting
anomaly, Mr. Bohannon.

314
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:35,104
A gunslinger and an aristocrat.

315
00:25:35,138 --> 00:25:36,405
[Chuckles]

316
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:38,839
Yeah, wouldn't go that
far in either direction.

317
00:25:38,874 --> 00:25:42,408
Look, I am unwell.

318
00:25:42,443 --> 00:25:44,846
I simply need you to back me up.

319
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,680
What if they don't believe me?

320
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:52,422
Well, there's a good chance that
you will share in the blame.

321
00:25:52,456 --> 00:25:54,425
And a jail cell.

322
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,061
From the moment you accept my offer,

323
00:25:57,096 --> 00:26:00,666
all your debts owing to me
will be forgiven.

324
00:26:05,906 --> 00:26:09,443
All my debts to you were
buried with Doc Whitehead.

325
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,167
Sign the check.

326
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:35,104
[Sighs] I know her.

327
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:38,341
She will not leave the railroad.

328
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:41,780
This is the best way
for us to be rid of her.

329
00:26:41,814 --> 00:26:43,081
Is it?

330
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:46,816
Have you done something
you haven't told me about?

331
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:53,519
I will do this my way

About all you have
