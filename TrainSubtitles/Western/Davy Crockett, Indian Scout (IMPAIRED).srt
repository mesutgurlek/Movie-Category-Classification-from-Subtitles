00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,028
NARRATOR: In 1848,
the United States and Mexico
signed a peace treaty

2
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:39,099
That opened up
the great Southwest
to the wagons of the pioneers.

3
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,901
But when they came
to occupy it,

4
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,736
They found
a lot of other early Americans

5
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,874
Who didn't know or care
about our deal with Mexico.

6
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:49,943
They had the idea
it was their country.

7
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:53,046
So one day a wagon train
with an Army escort
was attacked.

8
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,816
(GUNS FIRING)

9
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,286
They buried their dead
where they fell.

10
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,053
OFFICER: Fire!

11
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:07,127
Then they pushed on
to Fort Gardner,

12
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:11,064
One of the military outposts
that dotted the trail
to California.

13
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:14,568
But there was
something mysterious
about this attack.

14
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:19,307
Something that set it apart
from all previous raids
on wagon trains.

15
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,509
(ALL CHATTERING)
So Colonel Pollard,
commandant of the post,

16
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,011
Ordered
an immediate investigation.

17
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,515
Your attention, please.

18
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,850
This is Major Davison,
Captain Laurence,

19
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,221
And our confidential
liaison officer,
Mr. James Eagle,

20
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,256
Who, being part
Indian himself,

21
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:38,158
Has been of
great assistance to us
in Indian matters.

22
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,961
Now, the reason
for this inquiry
is simply this,

23
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,597
There is evidence
that a spy was
operating in your camp

24
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,633
The night
of the attack.

25
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,969
Now, Captain Weightman,
have you any suspicion
as to the guilty person?

26
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,939
Nothing on which
I could base
a formal accusation, sir.

27
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,674
Well, I have.

28
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,944
You don't have to search
no further. There's your spy!
That murdering redskin!

29
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,512
Silence, please.

30
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:01,415
Mr. Simms,
I'll have to ask you
to restrain yourself.

31
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,150
Uh, Crockett,
I understand this Indian

32
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,387
Has acted as
your assistant scout
in other expeditions?

33
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,957
That's right, sir.
Red Hawk and me,
we sort of grew up together.

34
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,525
He's a Cherokee.

35
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,795
When he was a boy,
his village was wiped out
by Comanches.

36
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:18,232
Some missionaries
brought him up.
I'd stake my life on him.

37
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,234
Well, that... that's
a strong statement.

38
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:21,602
CROCKETT:
I can back it up, sir.

39
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:22,770
POLLARD: Go ahead.

40
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:29,310
Well, we hadn't had
a mite of trouble till we hit
the Kiowa Indian country.

41
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,912
We were rolling along
through the San Juan Valley.

42
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:37,050
CROCKETT: I had been scouting
out ahead with Tex McGee,
the civilian wagon boss,

43
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,787
And we didn't like
what we ran into.

44
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,555
We rode in to report
to the Captain

45
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,992
That what used to be
a friendly Indian village
had plumb disappeared.

46
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,727
I was just trying
to convince the Captain

47
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,596
That the time
to worry about Indians

48
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,898
(MAN WHOOPING)
is when they ain't
where they ought to be

49
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:54,935
When Red Hawk rode in
from scouting the hills
on our north flank.

50
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,473
The tribes gather
at council fires.

51
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:02,510
They talk of war
against all white men.

52
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,278
Any sign
of Sleeping Fox's village?

53
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:06,179
They are making
a new camp
to the north.

54
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:10,150
Braves paint their faces
for the warpath.

55
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,286
Reckon I better
ride out and have
a powwow with them.

56
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,787
It's worth trying,
Crockett.

57
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,189
See if you can find out
what's back of all this.

58
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:19,059
The Army will round up
the leaders and hang them.

59
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,595
Looks like it'll take
a heap of rounding up,
Captain.

60
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,798
Come on, Hawk,
let's head for those rocks.

61
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,534
CAPTAIN: Troupe, forward!

62
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,546
CROCKETT: We rode
a good five miles
into the hills

63
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,349
And never saw a feather
or a pony track.

64
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,364
Reckon it's us
that got rounded up.

65
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:06,407
Looks like Sleeping Fox
invited us to a party
whether we like it or not.

66
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,114
Lead the horses back
to those rocks.

67
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:35,369
Why you lead soldiers
and white wagons
into my people's country?

68
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:37,671
Soldiers go to
Fort Gardner.

69
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,474
White wagons go to
Land of Setting Sun.

70
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:43,110
They mean no harm
to your people,
Sleeping Fox.

71
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:46,614
Many tribes meet
at council fire
under new chief.

72
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:50,484
The word has passed.
It is war.

73
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:53,721
Go, tell your people
to turn back
before it's too late.

74
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,924
Sorry, Chief,
our orders are to go ahead.

75
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,226
Then you will not
go back.

76
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,433
CROCKETT: I didn't know
whether he was bluffing
or not,

77
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:08,368
But I didn't have
to wait long
to find out.

81

CROCKETT: After that
one charge, Sleeping Fox
wasted no more men on us.

82
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:52,279
He figured he had us
sewed up anyway.

83
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:58,351
By dark, Sleeping Fox
had half the braves
of his tribe with him.

84
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,788
And I knew
if we didn't get out
before sun-up,

85
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,389
We wouldn't get out at all.

shots left, Hawk.

on your horse,

00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:53,841
CROCKETT: That dead Indian
gave us just the one chance
we needed.

94
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:57,244
We drew straws to see
which one of us was to
lead the Indians a-chase,

95
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,946
And Red Hawk won.

If you can shake them off,
meet me at the head
of the canyon.

I'll make it on foot
across the rim rock.

with all the migration west,

narrow escape, Miss Oatman.

156
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,609
We lost them
in the rocks, Davy,

157
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,277
But I stopped
on the way back

158
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:27,047
And lifted the hair
of the one you four-footed.

159
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,849
You mean you scalped him?

160
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:31,218
Oh, no, ma'am.
I don't scalp 'em.

161
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,786
I just cut off
their pigtails,

for my bridle.

163
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,391
Miss Oatman, I should
like a detailed report
on what happened,

164
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,060
For my dispatches East.

165
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,694
Would you mind
coming to headquarters?

166
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,663
Not at all, Captain.

167
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:50,570
Yonder goes something
I never would believe, Tex.

168

A schoolmarm
that's pretty
as a picture.

169
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,777
Hey now, you... you ain't gone
and fell without even
firing a shot, have you?

170
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:01,815
You're aiming
to get yourself hog-tied.

171
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:04,684
Maybe, but
I aim to get me
some education.

172
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:10,657
Well, sir, I reckon
that's about all
till the night of the attack.

173
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,327
Colonel, can't we
get down to business?

174
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:17,364
My wife's out there
bad hurt,

175
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,632
And there's
the sneaking devil
that brought it on her.

176
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,236
Mr. Simms, we all understand
and sympathize with you,

177
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,438
But this is
an investigation,
not a trial.

178
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,841
Why don't you ask him
what he was doing
up in the hills

179
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,211
With his Injun friends
for two days.

180
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,480
They didn't jump us
until the night he came back.

181
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,182
Red Hawk,
is that true?

182
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,816
Yes, sir.

183
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,587
I tried to learn who is
the leader uniting the tribes
in war upon the whites.

184
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,122
But with no success?

185
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,558
No, sir,
but there is such a man.
I heard them speak of him.

186
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,094
When was this?

187
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,295
HAWK:
The night of the attack.

188
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,930
Go on, tell us about it.

189
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:54,334
I had picked up
the blood trail of one of
Sleeping Fox's Indian braves.

190
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,037
HAWK: It led me
to a meeting place
in the mountains.

(MAN SPEAKING

192
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:07,614
They spoke of many guns
and much ammunition
the new Chief had given them.

193
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:10,617
They were planning
to attack the wagon train.

194
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:16,223
Camp was made
that night near Red Butte.

195
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,459
They had no idea that
danger was so near at hand.

00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,570
Isn't it?

199
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:34,241
Yeah, I wonder why
it can't always be
peaceful like this.

200
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,911
There's a powerful lot
of land in this country.

201
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:41,982
Enough for everybody.
Indians and whites alike.

202
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,583
If they'd only
portion it out.

203
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,286
That's been tried,
by treaties.

204
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,556
The settlers
always move into
the Indian's lands.

205
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:54,094
Yeah, I aim to do something
about that some day.

206
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:58,665
I'd like to go to Washington
like my uncle did,
the famous Davy Crockett.

207
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:02,936
Oh, Hawk.

208

the hard work
for me.

Miss Oatman joined
our outfit
the night we had

211
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,280
Our little ruckus
with Sleeping Fox.

212
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,149
Excuse us, ma'am.

213
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,784
Red Hawk's been out
in the hills
for two days,

214
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,820
And I reckon
I'd better get him
some grub.

215
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,228
What did you
find out, Hawk?

216
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,098
War party, Kiowas.
Many braves.

217
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,665
How far away?

218
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:36,436
In hills just beyond camp.
They come to attack tonight.

219
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,771
Are you sure?

220
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,540
I heard them talk.

221
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,611
We'd better go
tell the Captain.

222
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,082
HAWK: The Captain ordered
the camp on the alert

223
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,651
And doubled the guard
on the horses.

224
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,123
The plan was to
make the Kiowas think

225
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:59,259
The camp was asleep
and unprepared,

226
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,029
But every man
was ready and waiting.

227
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,930
It was ordered that
no one should shoot

228
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,067
Until the Captain himself
fired the signal gun.

229
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,076
What makes you
so sure they'll attack
from this side?

230
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,978
My guess is they'll try
to run off the horses.

231
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,381
Cavalry and wagons
ain't much good

around the buckle

the papers are disarranged.

close the case?

found footprints
leading out from camp.

259
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,629

during the fight.

is this court going to

at the Captain's tent.

266
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,281
Those moccasin prints,
doesn't that pin it on him?

267

No more than it pins it
on a lot of other people who
wear moccasins around camp.

from the rest of the hearing.

Well, gentlemen,

We've examined
all the witnesses
and got nowhere.

A dispatch
from Great Plains, sir.

That's all.

282
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,817
Well, there can
no longer be any doubt
that there was a spy

283
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,352
And that he made
good use
of the information

284
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,587
He got from
your dispatches, Weightman.

of the Great Plains area
are on the move.

ever hear of Indians
messing around

288
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,296
Never.

some white man's brain's
back of all this.

but nothing more.

to take much stock

all right, Colonel.

He's just Injun-jumpy.

304
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:01,654
I'd like to clear away
even his suspicions.

305
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:04,056
Got any ideas
how to do it?

306
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,191
No.

307
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08,227
Have you?

308
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,832
Who me? All I know about
is horses and wagons.

309
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:18,304
You take the schoolmarm's
team there, for instance.

310
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,140
What about them?

311
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:26,112
Oh, nothing, except when
she come rearing into camp
that night

312
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,548
Them horses were
sure galloping mighty fresh

313
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:32,218
For a team what drug a wagon
all the way from St. Louis.

314
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:36,389
She may have changed
horses somewhere.

315
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:40,326
Ain't no livery stable
this side of Santa Fe
that I knows of.

316
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:27,674
MAN: Howdy, Miss Oatman.

317
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,117
Oh!

318
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,854
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean
to frighten you.

319
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:45,925
I'm not easily frightened,
but you popped out
so suddenly.

320
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,361
I was just thinking of you
and there you were.

321
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:52,098
I've been wanting to tell you
since the hearing,
that I, for one,

322
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,366
Never had any doubts
about you.

323
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,936
That is good to hear.

324
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,972
It would be better still
if I had no doubts about you.

325
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:03,042
(LAUGHING)
Oh, that sounds
so mysterious.

326
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,077
What is your tribe?

327
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,517
My tribe?

328
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,386
It is difficult for one
of Indian blood to hide it
from another Indian.

329
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,889
I felt it
the first time I saw you.

330
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,567
My father is
half Dakota.

331
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,302
My mother was white.

332
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,304
And the name, "Oatman"?

333
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:36,643
It was my mother's
family name.

334
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:41,413
I've used it since
I was sent to white schools,
since I was a little girl.

335
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,086
Why are you ashamed
of your Indian blood?

336
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,522
I'm not, I'm proud of it.

337
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:53,860
But why boast about it
among people who are
prejudiced and suspicious?

338
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,364
If that is your only secret,

339
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,900
It will be safe with me.

340
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,335
Well,
what else could there be?

341
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,538
When the hungry fox hunts,

342
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,440
He overlooks no tracks.

343
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,253
Where you been?
Chief been waiting for you.

344
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:22,521
I...

345
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,007
TEX: I'll take care of him
for you, Davy.

346
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,848
Is something
troubling you, Davy?

347
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:53,019
What would you say, Hawk,
if I told you I don't think
that driver of Miss Oatman's

348
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,354
Is deaf or dumb?

349
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,691
I would say what troubles
you most is the question,

350
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,392
Does the girl know it?

351
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,129
I ain't made any secrets
as to how I feel about her.

352
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,565
Why do you think
the man is false?

353
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:10,302
Because I saw
an Indian stableman at Eagle's
corral talking to him.

354
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:12,371
Did this man, Ben,
also talk?

355
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,773
No.

356
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:17,109
No, he just made signs
and noises like
he does around camp.

357
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:20,613
But it looked like
he could hear, and
if he can hear, he can talk.

358
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:22,548
An Army doctor
told me that.

359
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,451
It should be easy enough
to trap this man.

360
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:29,822
Yeah.

361
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,859
Yeah, wait here.

362
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:43,736
Hello, Miss Frances.
Hello, Davy.

363
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,938
Meet my twin sister, Maggie.

364
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:48,007
She don't favor
you much.

365
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,076
Well, we're
the same size.

366
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:57,549
Funny, I can't get used
to that driver of yours
being deaf and dumb.

367
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,119
How'd you ever happen
to hire him, anyhow?

368
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,388
Well, for one thing,
I knew I'd be pretty safe

369
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:05,191
Coming across Indian
country with him.

370
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,326
Yeah, how does
that figure?

371
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,528
Why, didn't you know
that Indians never
harm anyone

372
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,931
Mentally
or physically afflicted?

373
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:15,534
What do you know,
I forgot all about that.

374
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,969
But it's true.

375
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:19,371
Old Jim Bridger got away
from a whole mess
of Blackfoot Indians

376
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:21,307
By pretending
he'd gone crazy.

377
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,642
FRANCES:
Of course, that war party
that chased us into your camp

378
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:26,112
Didn't give me a chance
to explain about Ben.

379
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,547
Yeah, I reckon Ben takes
a lot of explaining.

380
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,149
(GUN FIRING)

381
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,453
(LAUGHS)
Doggone my hide, I...

382
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,024
I'd forgotten all about
this spare gun of mine
having a hair-trigger.

383
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:39,826
I hope I didn't scare
you none, ma'am.

384
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,762
(LAUGHING) Not as much
as it did you.

385
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:45,264
I'd better
have this thing fixed,
before I shoot somebody.

386
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,933
Accidental-like.

387
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:59,311
Well, Hawk, I'm sure glad
to get that off my mind.

388
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,081
It is good to see
my friend happy again.

389
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:03,182
Afternoon, Captain.

390
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,683
Afternoon, Crockett.

391
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:07,686
The Colonel and I
have decided to hold back
our choice of routes

392
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,956
Until we come
to the fork in the trail.

393
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:11,724
That's a good idea.

394
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:13,259
And if anyone should
want to know before then?

395
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:16,796
Report it to me at once.
That in itself
would be suspicious.

396
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:19,131
Yes, sir.
Be ready to roll
at sunrise.

397
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:20,933
I'll be ready, sir.

398
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,170
Tex?
TEX: Oh!

399
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,305
Better ride
into town and
round up your pilgrims,

400
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:27,473
We roll at sun-up.

401
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,382
Column, right!

402
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,058
Stay back here,
and keep moving, Tex.

403
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:47,760
I'll ride forward
with the Captain.

404
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:49,461
All right, Davy.

405
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:10,783
Their last water camp
will be at Indian Springs.

406
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:14,153
Then they'll have
to decide what route
they're going to take.

407
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,755
We'll be at camp
close by.

408
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:20,559
Get our horses
and pack ponies ready,
we're leaving tonight.

409
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,386
Reckon you'll have
this dress ready
for the Virginia Reel

410
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,989
With your prize scholar
when we get to Great Plains?

411
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:52,291
That depends on
how long it takes.

412
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,625
I can't sew
while we're rolling

413
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:57,529
And I'll need at least
three evenings to finish it.

414
00:29:57,563 --> 00:30:02,001
Ah, you're sure going to cut
a dash among the gold braid
boys in that outfit.

415
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:03,669
Reckon I won't even
have a look in.

416
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:06,438
Now, there's no use
fishing like that.

417
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,974
I won't promise you a dance

418
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:10,910
Until you finish
that English composition
I told you to write.

419
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:12,879
Oh, she's did.

420
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:15,381
(LAUGHING)
Davy, "She's did."

421
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,218
Well, she's done.
It's done.

422
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:22,254
This composition
isn't feminine.

423
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:24,823
Well, she's sure
all about a female.

424
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,970
So I see.

425
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:42,574
It's a beautiful
composition, Davy.

426
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:45,377
Your teacher is
proud of you.

427
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:47,646
Well, I know it ain't
spelled very good,

428
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,918
I always get into trouble
with them little
tadpole letters, "g" and "p."

429
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:55,587
Can't remember which side
their head's turned on.

430
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:59,658
Maybe my head's turned
the wrong way, too.

431
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,896
Give me a chance
to study this, and I'll
correct it as soon as I can.

432
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,899
Well, I ought to get
A for effort anyhow.

433
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,268
All of that,

434
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:12,671
And that dance
at Great Plains, too.

435
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:17,843
Well, that makes me
as happy as a horned toad
on a hot rock.

436
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,545
Thank you, ma'am.

437
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,647
Thank you.

438
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:25,151
Teacher kept you
after school, didn't she?

439
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,121
Tex, do you reckon
I can get me some store-bought
clothes in Great Plains?

440
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:30,656
Store-bought clothes?

441
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:33,659
Mr. Crockett,
the Captain
wants to see you.

442
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:38,030
Maybe he'll lend you
a stovepipe hat,
you gall-darned dude.

443
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,832
Store-bought clothes!

444
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:45,237
Crockett,
from our camp here,
at Indian Springs,

445
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:48,840
How long will it take us
to reach the mouth
of Manitou Pass?

446
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:52,444
Well, we ought to
be there
by noon tomorrow.

447
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:55,347
Looks like
a perfect place
for an ambush.

448
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:56,815
Yeah.

449
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,585
Yeah, the devil himself
couldn't have built
a better one.

450
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:03,555
Captain,
let's play it safe
and go through South Pass.

451
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,225
If they attack there
we'll stand a good chance
to beat them off.

452
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,061
Very well, Crockett.
South Pass it is.

453
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,197
The only thing is, sir,
we'll have to let
the camp know tonight,

454
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,764
So we can take on water.

455
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:15,234
South Pass is bone-dry.

we'll be letting
the spy know as well.

of dragging this thing
out three extra days?

to fill all the water barrels
before we roll in the morning.

481
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:29,308
There'll be three
dry camps in a row.

482
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,620
No sleep for you and me
tonight, Hawk.

483
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:45,391
Do you think the spy might
try to pass that news on
to the Kiowa?

484
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,793
It wouldn't surprise me
a bit if the big wolf
of the Kiowas

485
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,862
Was out there
in the hills now
waiting for it.

486

In the dark,
wolf and coyote
look alike.

You watch this half
of the circle,

should leave camp?

Follow and
bring them back.

(WHISPERING)
I'll slip out
and join High Tree.

492

If Crockett trails me,
we'll lead him
far off the track.

493
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:19,158
When things are quiet,
I'll get away myself.

has to get word
to my father.

Welcome to my fire.

496
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:41,380
I was watching you
and Davy Crockett.

497
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,682
You didn't tell him
about me, did you?

498
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:48,387
No, but you are wrong
in thinking it would
turn his heart against you.

Oh, if I thought that,
there would be no problem.

I like him very much,
but I'm not in love with him.

to reach the shining river,

The mountain brook
makes many mistakes.

But all the time
it knows where it's going,

And nothing can keep
the brook and the river
apart for long.

Hello, Hawk.

607
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:54,880
I've just come
from Eagle's camp.
The girl is there.

608
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:56,982
She told him, of course,
which pass we're taking?

609
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:58,984
Yes, sir.
She reached
her father's camp

610
00:46:59,017 --> 00:47:02,320
Before I could overtake her
and the Kiowa guide.

611
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:04,289
Eagle has summoned
all the tribes for battle.

612
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:08,126
How do we know
this Injun didn't
let her go on purpose?

613
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,061
Why don't you
get back to your wagon,

614
00:47:10,095 --> 00:47:12,730
Before I forget
I'm littler than you?

615
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:15,867
Looks like
we're heading into
plenty of trouble, Captain.

616
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:18,703
Yeah,
but one thing is certain.

617
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:19,971
We've got to go on.

618
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:23,274
My orders are
to reinforce Great Plains.

619
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:24,876
Well, we don't
have to worry much
until we reach

620
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,544
The fork in the trail
at Manitou.

621
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,115
Right.
Well, let's get moving.

622
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:32,450
Tex, hitch up.
We're moving.

623
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,089
Chiefs of the Kiowas,

624
00:47:38,123 --> 00:47:40,258
Before calling you
to the war path,

625
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:43,328
I used my knowledge
of the white man's ways

626
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,731
To learn there will be
no more troops
or white wagons

627
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:48,666
Sent to this region

628
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,670
Until long after
next winter snows
have come and gone.

629
00:47:53,238 --> 00:47:54,539
By then,

630
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:57,675
We will have all the tribes
west of the Rocky Mountains

631
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,845
United with us
in one great Indian nation.

632
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:04,882
An empire, free forever

633
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:07,185
From the heel
of the white invader.

634
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,121
Now listen
to my plan of battle.

635
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:14,225
Our first blow will fall
on the fort at Great Plains.

636
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:15,994
Sleeping Fox,

637
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:18,263
Tonight, your warriors
will surround the fort,

638
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:21,232
Tomorrow at dawn
you will attack.

639
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:26,071
Agatchee, your braves
will gather at South Pass.

640
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:28,139
When the troops
and wagon train enter,

641
00:48:28,173 --> 00:48:31,642
You will ride down on them
in full force.

642
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:34,612
Arango, your men
will strike from the center.

643
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,581
And yours, Orano,

644
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:39,517
Will ride down on them
from the north end.

645
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,919
Nothing can save them now.

646
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:44,589
We'll strike such terror
in the hearts
of the white men

647
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:46,857
They'll never
come this way again.

648
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:49,027
No one shall escape us.

649
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,896
We'll massacre every man,
woman and child.

650
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,366
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

651
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,372
Let her go.

652
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:11,182
Now I am certain
of what I only suspected.

653
00:49:11,216 --> 00:49:13,884
It was she
who helped Red Hawk escape.

654
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,123
Her heart is
with her mother's people.

655
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:20,891
Now let her die with them.

656
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:56,561
They're gathering
in force, Lieutenant.

657
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:13,944
Here's Sergeant Gordon, sir.
He has volunteered
for the detail.

658
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:15,813
You realize the urgency
of getting this message

659
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,015
Through to
Captain Weightman's column,
do you, Sergeant?

660
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:19,450
I do, sir.

661
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,486
And you understand,
that I'm not ordering you
to attempt it.

662
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,321
You know what happened
to the other messengers.

663
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,890
Yes, sir.

664
00:50:25,923 --> 00:50:28,025
It's doubtful
that you'll even
reach the river.

665
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:30,027
The rocks are crawling
with Indians.

666
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:32,297
I'd still like
to try, sir.

667
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,334
Thanks, Gordon.

668
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,429
Lookee yonder, Cap.
Something's comin'.

669
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:17,041
WEIGHTMAN:
Sergeant, take her horse.

670
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:20,545
WEIGHTMAN: It isn't likely
that you came here

671
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,980
Just to submit to arrest,
Miss Eagle.

672
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:25,082
I've come to bring you
important information.

673
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:27,318
Very well.
Dismount, please.

674
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:36,827
Then you admit
entering my tent

675
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:38,396
And breaking into
my dispatch case?

676
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,766
Yes, and last night
I took more information
to my father.

677
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:44,969
In making this confession,
you realize that
I have full authority

678
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,504
To order you shot
as an enemy spy?

679
00:51:46,537 --> 00:51:47,772
It doesn't matter.

680
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:50,007
Unless you act
on what I say,
I'll die anyway

681
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,577
With the rest of you
at South Pass.

682
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:55,780
I wish
we could
believe you.

683
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:57,782
I'm making no excuses.

684
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,920
All my life I've waited
for the day when I could
help the Indian cause.

685
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,290
I believed in my father.

686
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:09,093
Until I learned he wasn't
just waging a war,
but planning a massacre.

687
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,996
You say he means
to attack Great Plains
at dawn tomorrow?

688
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:14,765
Yes, and also they'll be
waiting at South Pass

689
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:19,103
To attack you in full force
and destroy the wagon train.

690
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,106
How can we believe
a word she says, Captain?

691
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,108
I agree with you,
Simms.

692
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,144
We can't put much faith
in a proven spy.

693
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:28,979
(HORSE GALLOPING)

694
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:40,558
Sergeant Gordon,
with a dispatch
from Great Plains, sir.

695
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:41,692
Which way
did you come,
Sergeant?

696
00:52:41,726 --> 00:52:42,860
Manitou Pass, sir.

697
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,362
Any sign of
hostiles there?

698
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:46,631
Not in the pass.
They've got the fort
cut off.

699
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,434
Other war parties
are heading for South Pass.

700
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:51,236
What the Sergeant says,
and this dispatch,

701
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:53,738
Seem to bear out
the girl's story.

702
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,644
Yes, sir, Captain,
it sure does.

703
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,011
WEIGHTMAN: Tex
TEX: Yeah.

704
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:02,480
Take the Sergeant along,
and get him a fresh horse.

705
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,848
Sure, Cap.

706
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,785
Uh, Crockett.

707
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:14,124
We've got to get
to Great Plains today.

708
00:53:14,158 --> 00:53:16,861
They'll be wiped out
if they don't get supplies
and ammunition

709
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:19,730
Before the attack
in the morning.

710
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:23,468
Well, we'll have to
switch our plans and go by
the way of Manitou Pass, sir.

711
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:25,303
Well,
we've got to chance it.

712
00:53:25,336 --> 00:53:27,638
I'll send word to McHale
we're coming through Manitou

713
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:30,308
And that we should
reach him tonight.

714
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:32,042
Right, sir.
Right.

715
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:38,082
Miss Eagle, it seems that
you've told us the truth.

716
00:53:38,115 --> 00:53:41,085
I want you to realize
that I must hold you
under arrest

717
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:43,854
Until your case is judged
by higher authority.

718
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,122
Yes, Captain.

719
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:47,124
I'll be responsible
for her, sir.

720
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,693
Right.

721
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:51,362
Here you are,
Sergeant.

722
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:52,730
Thank you.

723
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:53,998
Good luck to you.

724
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:55,666
Thank you, sir.

725
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:46,417
Chief Eagle!

726
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:53,591
I shoot soldier messenger
on trail to Great Plains.

727
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:05,536
The whites have
changed their plan.
They come by Manitou.

728
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:06,871
My daughter must have
told them

729
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:09,707
We'd be waiting
to attack at South Pass.

730
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,942
They're trying
to make fools of us.

731
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:15,946
Now it is they who will
ride into a death trap.

732
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,116
Recall your warriors
from the trails
to South Pass.

733
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,720
Take them
to the cliffs of Manitou.
I'll join you there.

734
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:24,922
Assemble your braves

735
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:27,825
In the hidden valley
on the east side
of Manitou,

736
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:29,994
Where you can watch
every move of the enemy.

(SPEAKING NATIVE AMERICAN

738
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:02,359
Captain, I hate to see
the wagons enter Manitou
without scoutin' it first.

739
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:04,028
There may be an ambush.

740
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:06,363
Suppose Red Hawk and me
ride in a ways
and see what's what?

741
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:07,732
That's my job now.

742
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:09,033
Yours is here
with the wagons,

743
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:11,402
To look after
the women and children.

744
00:56:11,436 --> 00:56:12,870
You goin' in
with the troops, sir?

745
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:14,672
And our supply wagons.

746
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,574
If you don't hear firing
in a half an hour,

747
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:18,809
Come ahead
with the wagon train.

748
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:21,278
Right, sir.
We'll be ready to roll.

749
00:56:23,748 --> 00:56:25,282
Troop, forward!

750
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:40,498
Get 'em rolling!

751
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:50,541
It might be a good idea
to scout to the rear, Tex.

752
00:57:19,203 --> 00:57:22,372
They've separated.
Now we can strike
a double blow.

753
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:26,611
Have your braves
join those on the cliffs
to trap the soldiers.

754
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:31,048
Get your warriors ready
to attack the wagon train
when I give the signal.

their troops bottled up
in Manitou Pass.

760
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:16,787
Roll 'em.
Form a circle!

761
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:18,422
Get 'em rollin'!

762
00:59:41,011 --> 00:59:43,848
So all the Indians
went to South Pass,
did they?

763
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:46,550
Hawk, stand guard over her.
If she tries to get away,
you know what to do.

764
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,985
No, my friend.

765
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:50,621
You'll have to get
someone else
for that duty.

766
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:53,290
I don't understand you.
I owe my life to this girl.

767
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:56,293
Her father held me prisoner.
She helped me to escape.

768
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:58,562
Then you could have
brought her in?

769
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,097
Yes.

770
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,365
Those were
your orders, Hawk.

771
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:04,769
I guess you don't need
to hear any more
than that, Crockett.

772
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:08,038
They're in this thing together
and have been right along.

773
01:00:08,072 --> 01:00:11,008
I'll take your rifle.

774
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,943
Looks like the Army
will have a double trial.

775
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:17,147
Trial? We ought to
hang 'em both,
right now.

776
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:19,583
No, we'll leave that
to the Army.

777
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,052
Thomas, stand guard
over both of 'em.

778
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:23,620
Davy, wait.

779
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:26,490
You can't believe I helped
lead you into this trap?

780
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:28,158
If I believed
anything else,
I'd be a bigger fool

781
01:00:28,192 --> 01:00:31,762
Than you've already
tried to make of me.
Come on, Simms.

782
01:00:58,022 --> 01:01:01,058
The attack's likely to come
from that ridge.

783
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:04,228
Keep your eye on it, Simms.

to get back
to that wagon train.

793
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:45,722
Doesn't look like
much of a chance, sir.

794
01:03:45,755 --> 01:03:48,993
If I only knew whether
men and horses
could live in that current.

795
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:50,961
I'll find out, sir.

Neither one of us is
strong enough to fight our way
out of this alone.

If there was only some way
to get together.

back there.

It's a slim chance, but
it's the only one we've got.

Frances Oatman,

814
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:43,987
You are charged with
conspiracy and espionage
upon the United States Army.

815
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:46,890
Red Hawk,

816
01:08:46,923 --> 01:08:49,793
You are charged with
gross dereliction of duty
in the face of the enemy.

817
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,597
Those are both
capital offenses.

818
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,400
Captain, you proferred
these charges.
Are they correct as stated?

819
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:58,302
Yes, sir.

820
01:08:58,335 --> 01:09:00,036
Crockett, as chief scout
for this expedition,

821
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:03,540
You were in a position
to know the facts.
Are these charges true?

822
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:04,674
Yes, sir.

Before I pronounce sentence,

824
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:09,012
Have you any details to offer
bearing upon the case?

Details?

826
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:13,983
Yes, sir.

827
01:09:14,017 --> 01:09:16,986
Take the young lady's case,
for instance.

828
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:20,857
We found Captain Weightman's
dispatches on the body
of Chief Eagle.

829
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:22,792
So, at least we know
she wasn't lying to us

830
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:24,561
When she tried to save us
from ambush.

831
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:28,632
Well, uh, are you defending
or accusing these prisoners?

832
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,667
Oh, neither, sir.

well, if he hadn't ridden out

None of us
would be here today.

837
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:45,249
Well, are you suggesting
that we let these prisoners
go free?

838
01:09:45,282 --> 01:09:48,184
Oh, no, sir.
I'd hold them prisoner.

839
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:51,688
They ought to pay
for what they did.

scare up a preacher
to make them man and wife.

And furthermore,
under military auspices,

845
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:11,508
You will start
the first Indian school
in this district,

846
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,377
With the hope that you both
may help to bring about

between the Indians
and the whites.
