00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,472
ANNOUNCER:
<i>The following program</i>

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:09,042
<i>is brought to you</i>
<i>in living color on NBC.</i>

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,773
(fanfare plays)

4
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,283
(hoofbeats approaching)

5
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,192
(horse whinnying)

6
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,268
We got the wrong man, Bob.
That's Adam Cartwright.

7
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,032
Come on, let's get out of here.

8
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,667
(gunshot)

9
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,345
(gunshot)

10
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,393
Who are you?

11
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,394
MAN:
A friend.

12
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,453
(pistol cocking)

13
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,468
A friend?

14
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,403
You're sure
a feather-footed one.

15
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,604
Who are you?

16
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:14,007
Gerald Esketh, by name.

17
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:18,078
Here, perhaps this will relieve
your mind.

18
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,214
U.S. Deputy Marshall.

19
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,450
I can't say I'm sorry
to see you.

20
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,451
Who were they?

21
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,885
The Clevenger Brothers.

22
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,319
Friends of yours?

23
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:32,892
Hardly that, but you may have
made a terrible mistake.

24
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:37,097
Just be thankful
that you're still alive.

25
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,900
And I'll be thankful that I've
reached the end of a long trail.

26
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,237
The Clevengers were wanted in
California for bank robbery.

27
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:48,808
I had the, uh... unpleasant duty
of killing their older brother.

28
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,811
He was caught robbing
sluice boxes.

29
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,213
Oh, so you were the one.

30
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,650
I was only performing
my official duty.

31
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,647
(theme song playing)

32
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,000
Mr. Esketh, welcome
to the Ponderosa.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,602
From what Adam tells me,
we're greatly in your debt.

34
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,337
Well, I'm happy that I was
fortunate enough

35
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,206
to be in the right place
at the right time.

36
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,408
Well, we'll try to make your
stay here

37
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,409
a very comfortable one.

38
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,944
- Please.
- Thank you.

39
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,080
I appreciate a great deal what
you did for Adam, Mr. Esketh.

40
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,140
For all of us.

41
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,760
Adam, anything else
you want to tell me?

42
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,896
Well, I still can't
believe it, Pa.

43
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,232
I mean, I'm not selling
the Clevengers short--

44
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,900
roughest bunch
of renegades I've ever known--

45
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,469
but I just can't imagine
them taking a shot at me.

46
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,004
You never know with that bunch.

47
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,207
Old Gid Clevenger and his boys
have made their own laws

48
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,809
for so long, you never know when
they might step over the line.

49
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,744
And you did have the ranch
payroll with you.

50
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,647
They must have thought
I was somebody else.

51
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,482
Believe me, Adam, I know
how you feel,

52
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,618
but the marshal did have
a warrant for them.

53
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,286
Well, there's one thing for
certain,

54
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,621
he isn't too upset about it.

55
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,324
Now, come on, we've got a guest
to take care of.

56
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,992
We'll decide later what
to tell Gid Clevenger.

57
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,861
If he gives us a chance to talk.

58
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:49,851
BEN (mutters):
Yeah.

59
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,466
The bucolic life
is not for Gerald Esketh.

60
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,835
Pa, I put Mr. Esketh's bag
in the upstairs room.

61
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,337
Thanks, son.

62
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,406
Well, one would scarcely expect
to encounter the épée

63
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,175
out here in the wilderness.

64
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,377
Well, Little Joe's mother
was Louisiana French.

65
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,046
He likes to play around
with them.

66
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:10,216
You mean, you actually use this?

67
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,884
Well, I fool around
with it just for fun.

68
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,254
He's faster than greased
lightning, Mr. Esketh.

69
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,779
Come on, Joe, let's show him.

70
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,895
En garde, brother.

71
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,660
You should never have given
those two a chance to show off.

72
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,503
Oh!

73
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,904
Dadgum...

74
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,270
(laughing)

75
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,008
You know, they really have no
intention of killing each other.

76
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,682
He has an admirable skill.

77
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,245
(grunts)

78
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,456
Whack him over the head, Hoss.

79
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,058
You'll never get anywhere
poking at him.

80
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,359
(yelling)

81
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,061
(laughing)

82
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,596
Touché.

83
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,365
Nevertheless, your technique
is not quite flawless.

84
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,925
When you feint to the left,
you're a bit off balance.

85
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,311
En garde.

86
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,047
En garde.

87
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,136
You know, you could hurt
somebody with that.

88
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,934
Lost the button off the point.

89
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,608
So I did.

90
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,370
This might have been fatal.

91
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,186
Violence as such is vulgar.

92
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,423
Any man, who in anger,
takes a human life,

93
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,059
becomes a brother of the apes.

94
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,595
He's an aesthetically
impoverished man.

95
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,829
Don't you think so?

96
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,865
Oh, yes, sir.

97
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,500
I reckon.

98
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,069
And yet, the skills and rhythms

99
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,372
of disciplined violence
have beauty,

100
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,976
like a painting by Rubens
or Botticelli.

101
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,712
Unfettered by personal emotion.

102
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,213
Yes.

103
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,115
There, to that simple word,

104
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,785
can be traced the downfall
of most artists

105
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,688
and many human creatures--
emotion.

106
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,023
Yeah, that's a... that's

107
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,359
a very interesting observation,
Mr. Esketh.

108
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,528
I don't think I could cast you
in the mold

109
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,329
of an average lawman.

110
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,432
I've been told that.

111
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,570
Well, I think the elegance and
hospitality of your home

112
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,740
have made me forget
my original mission.

113
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,109
I'm here to visit an old friend.

114
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,511
Would you happen to know
a Mr. Jason Blane?

115
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,213
- Oh, the assayer?
- Yes.

116
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,981
Oh yes, know him--
know him very well.

117
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,116
And his wife.

118
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,417
Wife?

119
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,585
Jason married?

120
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,320
Oh, yes, about a year.

121
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,155
They were married
right in this very room.

122
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,057
Then you do know him well.

123
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,793
Well, Jason has always been
a little hard to know,

124
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,396
but, uh, Mariette is practically
a part of our family.

125
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,899
Mariette. What a charming name.

126
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:52,271
Yes, uh, her father was
a very dear friend of mine.

127
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,173
When he died, he left
the raising of Mariette

128
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,641
almost entirely
to my supervision.

129
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,346
Jason Blane married.

130
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,949
How very, very interesting.

131
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,217
Is she a pretty girl?

132
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,152
Oh, we always thought so.

133
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,187
But of course, we could be
slightly prejudiced.

134
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,189
Oh, no, my dear Adam,
I have a feeling

135
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,191
I can trust your judgment
in such matters.

136
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,359
Time to eat, please.

137
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,360
Oh, good.

138
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,329
Could I, uh, freshen up
a bit before supper?

139
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,264
Why, of course.
I'll show you to your room.

140
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,941
Adam, what're you staring at?

141
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,610
Oh, I didn't realize I was.

142
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,678
(door closes)

143
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,681
Look, I know you feel bad
about the Clevengers.

144
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,351
But it's like
Esketh told Hoss and me.

145
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,887
Bob and Bill had a bead
right on your back.

146
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,322
He had to shoot fast and any way
he could.

147
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,359
You ought to just be thankful
he was there.

148
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,129
Yeah, I'll try to remember that.

149
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,597
Come on, let's have some supper.

150
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,589
Right.

151
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,506
And so, under the circumstances,
there was little I could do.

152
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:04,076
And that, gentlemen, is the way
I shot my first tiger in India.

153
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,078
Oh! (gasps)

154
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,947
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
Number One Cousin,

155
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,115
can't you do anything right?

156
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,917
Here, let me do that.
Sorry, Gerald.

157
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,986
Mr. Cartwright, take you long
time to know San Francisco.

158
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,022
Take me long time
to know Ponderosa.

159
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,158
I help you in San Francisco,
you help me in Ponderosa.

160
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,826
All right?

161
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,886
All right, thank you.

162
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,033
(chuckling)

163
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,936
You know, for years we had the
most wonderful cook, Hop Sing.

164
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,437
He went back to Hong Kong,

165
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,439
and talked me into hiring
his Number One Cousin.

166
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,640
I don't know.

167
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,442
Number One Cousin?
Doesn't he have a name?

168
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,412
If he's got one,
he hasn't told us about it.

169
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,746
I'm sorry about this, Gerald.

170
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,881
Think nothing of it.

171
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,683
The same thing happened
when I was dining

172
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,251
with the Prince of Wales
in Paris.

173
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,652
Dadgum, Mr. Esketh,

174
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,321
if you ain't been just
about every place.

175
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,223
And there's one place I never
cease to enjoy going to.

176
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,558
- Where's that?
- Bed.

177
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,559
(chuckling)

178
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,560
I've had a long ride

179
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,796
and I'm afraid
I'm not much of a night owl.

180
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,097
Gerald, this has been

181
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,865
an extremely pleasant evening--
extremely pleasant.

182
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,134
I'm sorry about what happened
at the end of it.

183
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,770
Oh, Hoss and Joe, see that Mr.
Esketh has everything he needs.

184
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,771
Yes, sir.

185
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,107
And tomorrow morning, Adam and
I will ride into Virginia City

186
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,276
with you, we'll show you where
Jason and Mariette live.

187
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,277
Fine. Fine.

188
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,212
Have a good rest.

189
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,815
Adam, I regret the circumstances
under which we met,

190
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,751
but I'm grateful
that we-we did meet.

191
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,220
A stranger in
a strange community.

192
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,557
It's heartening to have
substantial friends.

193
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,719
- Good night.
- Good night.

194
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,664
HOSS:
Mr. Esketh, did you sure enough

195
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,432
have that old tiger cat
by the tail?

196
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,734
ESKETH:
Sure enough.

197
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,671
That Hoss makes the most
wonderful audience, doesn't he?

198
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,312
I hope you'll go along
with my little whimsy

199
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,880
in wanting to surprise Jason.

200
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,348
We were such close friends,

201
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,651
and it's been such a long time
since I've seen him.

202
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,786
Are you sure you can
find the house?

203
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,554
My dear Adam, your directions
are most explicit.

204
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,289
Now, don't forget,
we want you to spend

205
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,492
at least a few days with us
at the ranch house.

206
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,693
I know Adam and the boys

207
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,395
will want to take you
on that cougar hunt.

208
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:06,699
Ben, I can't tell you how much
I appreciate your hospitality.

209
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,200
And, as I told you before,

210
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,070
there's nothing in life I find
as exciting as a hunt.

211
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,767
Thank you, again, both of you.

212
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,109
Adam, when you get
through at the bank,

213
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,378
meet me at the hotel,
we'll have a bite to eat.

214
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,471
- Right.
- C'mon.

215
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,411
Pardon me, dear lady,
if I startled you.

216
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,680
But I had wrongly assumed
that no one was home

217
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,881
and had started to leave.

218
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,817
I'm glad that I was in error.

219
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,086
You're Mrs. Blane?

220
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,287
Yes, I am.

221
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,422
The Cartwrights told me
all about you.

222
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,191
Are you a friend
of the Cartwrights?

223
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,494
And an old and dear friend
of your good husband.

224
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,529
Gerald Esketh is my name.

225
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,896
Surely, Jason has mentioned me.

226
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,902
No, I don't recall.

227
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,139
Well, that is, I've never met
any of Jason's friends.

228
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,041
Did you meet him in California?

229
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,976
I did, indeed.

230
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,547
My dear child,

231
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:32,685
Jason's mineralogy
has surely been worthwhile.

232
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,554
He's found a true jewel.

233
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,357
I don't know if you're
making fun of me or not,

234
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,860
but Jason is not at home.

235
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,996
Then perhaps you wouldn't mind
if I waited a while for him.

236
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,899
Ben and Adam have some business
to transact in town,

237
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,501
and I'm a total stranger here.

238
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,769
Oh, yes, of course.

239
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,936
How rude of me.

240
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,738
Won't you come in, Mr. Esketh?

241
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,764
Thank you.

242
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,883
Oh, won't you sit down,
Mr. Esketh?

243
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,909
Thank you.

244
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,455
I'll make you some tea.

245
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,223
How very thoughtful of you.

246
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,959
What a fine likeness of Jason.

247
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,450
Yes, it is, isn't it?

248
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,233
- Hey.
- Jason, good morning.

249
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,335
- How are you, Adam?
- Fine. Did your friend find you?

250
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,537
Oh, who's that?

251
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,840
Your friend from California--
Gerald Esketh.

252
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,542
No.

253
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,010
Is there anything wrong?

254
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,446
Uh... no.

255
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,748
Uh, everything's all ri...

256
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,584
Esketh-- uh, is he here in town?

257
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,386
Well, he stopped over
at our ranch last night,

258
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,188
and he rode into town
this morning with us.

259
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,952
Went to your house.
He wanted to surprise you.

260
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,495
Thank-thank you, Adam.

261
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,770
You have some very
interesting things, Mariette.

262
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,105
I couldn't help
but notice this jewel box.

263
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,875
Oh, Jason took that
for assaying some ore.

264
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,211
(chuckling): I'm afraid
he isn't very practical.

265
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,545
But he is sweet.

266
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,547
We've been so happy here.

267
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,549
I'm sure you have.

268
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,987
We thought most highly of Jason
in San Francisco.

269
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,789
Oh.

270
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,891
How elegant these
must look on you.

271
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,860
Oh, but they're not real pearls.

272
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,996
But your beauty would make them
appear priceless.

273
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,433
Please, may I see them on you?

274
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,889
Oh, Jason, darling,
there you are.

275
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,257
Look who's here.

276
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,352
My dear Jason,
after all of these years.

277
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,561
Esketh.

278
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,268
They're reviving the old case
in Sacramento, Jason,

279
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,103
and they couldn't
very well proceed

280
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,006
without the chief
prosecution witness-- you.

281
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,074
Is this something
you two gentlemen

282
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,809
would rather discuss privately?

283
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,578
No, no, not at all.

284
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,014
My business
as a law enforcement officer

285
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,749
is public business,
and I'm sure that you

286
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,418
and your husband have no secrets
from each other.

287
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,944
I'll fix you some tea, Jason.

288
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,245
Have you told her
of this matter?

289
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,681
No. How could I?

290
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,016
She's almost part
of the Cartwright family.

291
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,118
How much have you told her?

292
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,820
Nothing.

293
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,517
I detest emotional display.

294
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,260
What's the matter, Jason?

295
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,001
Nothing, Mariette.

296
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,337
Nothing you'd understand.

297
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,807
You're not aware
of all the facts, Mariette.

298
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,609
He has a right
to be a reluctant witness.

299
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,545
His testimony will be against

300
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,981
the most sinister forces
in Northern California.

301
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,116
They may seek retaliation.

302
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,085
Retaliation?

303
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,688
However, he'll be
in my protective custody.

304
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,858
Jason, I trust you
to be ready for the journey,

305
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,493
shall we say, at noon tomorrow?

306
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,228
Does that allow you enough time?

307
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,896
(Jason chuckles softly)

308
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,898
You trust me?

309
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,867
I amend that.

310
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,004
I trust your wife
to see that you're ready.

311
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,139
Thank you for the tea, Mariette.

312
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,836
It was indeed a pleasure
meeting you.

313
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,659
I should never have tried
to run away from it.

314
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,038
Jason, what do you mean?

315
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,340
I loved you so much.

316
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,309
I thought I had a right
to a little happiness.

317
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,879
But you did have,
and you still have.

318
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,514
I won't let you go back.

319
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,749
We can leave,
and we can make another start.

320
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,851
Don't you see
that that's what I tried to do

321
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,553
and this is the result of it?

322
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,921
Nothing will change.

323
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,390
I've got to go back with him.

324
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,860
But he said that it
would be dangerous.

325
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,563
I don't intend
to lose you, Jason.

326
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,032
I love you much too much.

327
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,137
- Pa?
- Oh.

328
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,472
Have you seen Esketh?

329
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,773
Oh, he's probably
still with Jason.

330
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,408
Did you get that matter
straightened out at the bank?

331
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,643
- Oh, yeah.
- Good.

332
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,245
But, uh... as I was leaving,
I ran into Jason,

333
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,082
and I told him that, uh, Esketh
was looking for him,

334
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,651
and he, uh...
he seemed very upset about it.

335
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,352
Oh?

336
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,488
Think Esketh is here as a friend
to see Jason,

337
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:13,118
or, uh, is he here
in an official capacity?

338
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,196
Well, I don't know.

339
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,432
Esketh is a United States
Deputy Marshal.

340
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,835
Of course, what do we
really know about Jason?

341
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,170
Came in here,
swept Mariette off her feet.

342
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,439
Of course, he's done very well
in the year he's been here.

343
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,174
He's been very good to her.

344
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,144
I suppose that's all
you could ask of any man.

345
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,178
Yeah, well, I'd feel better

346
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,780
if I had a talk
with Mariette and Jason,

347
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,181
just ask them if there
was anything wrong.

348
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,483
What do you think?

349
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,817
I think it's a good idea.

350
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,086
And also remind Mariette
that we're still her family

351
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,921
for as long as she needs us.

352
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,948
Look, while you're over there,
I'll go see Judge Rand.

353
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,133
Going someplace, my dear Jason?

354
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,544
I was young, Esketh.

355
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,613
It was over five years ago.

356
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:11,617
Time gets away
from a man, doesn't it?

357
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,019
I'm curious, Jason.

358
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,355
Why didn't you go back to Ohio?

359
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,924
My arm isn't quite that long.

360
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,659
You know I'm a mineralogist?

361
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,227
Yes.

362
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,229
I traced you
through Arizona, Idaho,

363
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,365
and all over the Comstock Lode.

364
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,501
You changed your name a couple
of times, but I found you.

365
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,272
Well, you can't take me out
of Nevada Territory.

366
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,642
Here are the extradition papers.

367
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,909
I trust, Jason, you are growing
tired of trying to run away.

368
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,984
Everything legal
and aboveboard, huh, Esketh?

369
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,686
Always.

370
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,321
Which reminds me--

371
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,591
I must present my credentials
to your local judge.

372
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,460
I had a little official business
on the way in.

373
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,292
Billy and Bob Clevenger.

374
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,432
You saw the Clevengers?

375
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,668
Briefly, through my sights.

376
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,762
They're both dead.

377
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,579
What about Gideon, the old man?

378
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,014
Always a good friend
to you, wasn't he, Jason?

379
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,317
No, I haven't seen him yet,

380
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,116
but I'll plan to see him
before he sees me.

381
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,625
You, um... seem to have built up
a nice little business here.

382
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,993
Oh, why don't you
get it over with?

383
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,695
Why don't you kill me
and have done with it?

384
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,697
No, Jason.

385
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,399
I'll kill you because that's
what I came here for.

386
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,236
But I'll pick my own time
and my own place.

387
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,671
And besides...

388
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,908
I intend to get much better
acquainted with your wife.

389
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,742
She's lovely, Jason--
completely lovely.

390
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,219
(knock at door)

391
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,535
Hello, Mariette.

392
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,739
Oh, Adam,
I'm so glad to see you.

393
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,007
What's the matter?

394
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,675
Is there something wrong?

395
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,377
Oh, no, nothing.

396
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:23,315
It's just that... I haven't
seen you for so long.

397
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,384
Where's Jason?

398
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,287
Oh, he went to the office
to, uh,

399
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,055
pick up some things.

400
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,990
Mariette...

401
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,525
you're just about as close

402
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,260
to being a sister
as I'll ever have.

403
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,923
Now, a big part of that pleasure
is being able to help you.

404
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,768
Tell me--what happened
when Gerald Esketh came here?

405
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,636
Oh, nothing happened.

406
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:49,308
I think Mr. Esketh
is a very charming person.

407
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,006
We, uh... we even had tea.

408
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,580
Oh, Adam.

409
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,916
(crying):
I just can't lie to you.

410
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,886
I've tried, but I just can't.

411
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,690
That's more like it.

412
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,124
Now, tell me about it.

413
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:15,229
Jason has to go to California
to be a witness in a trial.

414
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,803
Well, that doesn't sound
so terrible.

415
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,606
I know, but the men
that he has to testify against--

416
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,302
they threatened to kill him.

417
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:28,480
You see, that's why Jason
left California.

418
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,415
I see.

419
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,451
Did he talk to Judge Rand
about this?

420
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,586
Oh, that was
my first suggestion,

421
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,856
but Jason didn't think
it would do any good.

422
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,257
(sighs)

423
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,959
Well, Jason's upset.

424
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,562
I think I'm in a better position
to decide than he is.

425
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,064
So, why don't you and I
have a talk with Judge Rand?

426
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,567
I think we'll find that Jason
can make a legal deposition

427
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,202
right here in Virginia City.

428
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,804
Oh, Adam, could we do
something like that?

429
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,207
Well, we won't know
until we ask, will we?

430
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,341
Come on, get your hat.

431
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,503
All right.

432
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:03,849
I'm sure when we know
all the facts...

433
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,650
Adam.

434
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,420
My dear Mariette.

435
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,723
What a pleasant surprise
this is.

436
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,025
Forgive me, Your Honor.

437
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:18,063
I am United States Deputy
Marshal Gerald Esketh.

438
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,133
You're in my
federal district, Marshal.

439
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,601
If you have business here,

440
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,603
you should have presented
your documents to me.

441
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,638
I fully intended to do so, sir.

442
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:29,374
As a matter of fact,
I was on my way to your chambers

443
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:33,311
when your, uh, messenger
intercepted me.

444
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:36,581
Mrs. Blane states
that her husband's life

445
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,750
will be in danger if he...

446
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,981
if he gives certain testimony
in Sacramento.

447
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,591
To some extent,
she may be right.

448
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,994
I myself
will not feel too secure

449
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,962
as his pledged bodyguard.

450
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,864
Now, you will note there, sir,

451
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,734
that this is <i>The State</i>
<i>v. Hadley Murdoch</i>

452
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,803
and a number of John Does,

453
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,639
all of whom comprise
a political machine

454
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,741
known as the Murdoch Gang.

455
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,877
Now, these are
infamous men, sir,

456
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:09,181
grown fat on terrorism
and plunder.

457
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,384
So rich and powerful, indeed,
that they now have most of

458
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,120
the state of California under
their rule of dread and fear.

459
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,656
Blane is the key witness?

460
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,292
We on the side of the law
earnestly believe

461
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,861
that Jason Blane is the one man

462
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,930
who can send these culprits
to the gallows.

463
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,128
Well, your husband's duty
is clear, Mariette.

464
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,805
And we can't very well call out
the militia to guard him.

465
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:41,046
Well, I was planning a trip
to Sacramento in a week or so.

466
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,181
I could change my plans,
go along with you,

467
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,817
if it would make Mariette
feel better.

468
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,752
Oh, it would, Adam, it would.

469
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:53,658
Anything to relieve
this dear lady's anxieties.

470
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,393
And rest assured,
we'll be joined by

471
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,629
other officers in Sacramento.

472
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,631
Oh, I'm very grateful to you.

473
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,132
To all of you.

474
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,068
Uh, Mr. Esketh,
I'm terribly sorry

475
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,736
to have caused you
all this trouble.

476
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,072
It's no trouble, my dear.

477
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,642
On the contrary,
I was delighted to see revealed

478
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:14,279
that jewel which money
cannot buy: loyalty.

479
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,450
Marshal, you and Adam both--
I-I'd like to talk to you.

480
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,454
If it's, uh, if it's all right
with you, Mariette.

481
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,289
Of course not.

482
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,124
Adam, Jason will be
so pleased to know

483
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,792
that you're going with him.

484
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,784
Thank you, gentlemen, thank you.

485
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,007
It's about the killing
of the Clevenger brothers.

486
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:45,777
Ah, yes, a distasteful duty,
I assure you.

487
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,380
But there is a warrant out
in California for their arrest.

488
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,383
I was talking
to your father, Adam.

489
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,019
He was telling me that Gideon
Clevenger came to see him.

490
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:57,183
Yeah, but he didn't seem
to want to make any trouble.

491
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,194
Strange man--Gideon Clevenger.

492
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,965
He'll brood about
the death of his sons,

493
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,501
then he'll decide to take
the law into his own hands.

494
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:13,772
He can be very dangerous,
if he makes up his mind to it.

495
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,974
Well, the thought
of any further bloodshed

496
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,709
is completely repelling to me.

497
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,745
I'll rest a whole lot easier
when you're out of town,

498
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,338
on your way back to Sacramento.

499
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:28,320
Then you think that this, um,
Gideon Clevenger

500
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,355
will make the death
of his two sons

501
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,791
a personal issue
between himself and me?

502
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,521
I think that precisely.

503
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,552
I see.

504
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,534
Jason.

505
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,636
Jason, I have
the most wonderful news.

506
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,471
I've just come from
talking to Judge Rand.

507
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,106
You what?

508
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,574
Oh, it's all right, darling.

509
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:52,644
He's going to write a letter to
a friend in Sacramento, a judge.

510
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,546
And then Adam is
going to go with you.

511
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,814
No, no, he can't do that.

512
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,950
But, Jason,
Adam only wants to help.

513
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,120
Well, he,
well, he can't go with me.

514
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,421
But why?

515
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,390
Tell me why.

516
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,058
Because if Adam Cartwright
goes with me,

517
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,050
he'll never get there alive.

518
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,070
Jason, what are you
trying to tell me?

519
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,739
Can't we make one move
in our life

520
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,407
without the Cartwrights
getting mixed up in it?

521
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,309
But the Cartwrights
are my best friends,

522
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,944
and they're the best friends
you ever had.

523
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,713
I don't want to talk about it.

524
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,216
Jason, now, come on,
this isn't like us.

525
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,418
I'm your wife, and I have
a right to know the truth.

526
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,221
Well, I have told you the truth.

527
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,389
Tell me something.

528
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,491
Why did you say that
if Adam went with you,

529
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,492
he would be killed?

530
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,862
Because that is the truth, too.

531
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,964
Jason, I have never asked you
anything about

532
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,733
your past life before, because
it just wasn't important,

533
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,735
but now it is.

534
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,872
Now, do they want you as
a witness for something you saw

535
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,864
or for something you did?

536
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,651
What difference does it make?

537
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,421
Esketh told you about
the Murdoch gang, didn't he?

538
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,522
Yes.

539
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,923
Well, that gang
isn't going to let me

540
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,915
get to Sacramento alive.

541
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,497
Not even with Mr. Esketh
and Adam to protect you?

542
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:23,635
Don't you realize that Esketh
was sent here to kill me?

543
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,370
Once I leave here, I'll be dead

544
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,740
before I can get
as far as the Ponderosa.

545
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,277
But why would anybody
want to kill you?

546
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,846
Because that's why he came here.

547
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,382
He is a hired, paid killer.

548
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,374
Now, try to understand that.

549
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,922
Jason, there must be
something we can do.

550
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:44,923
There must be!

551
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:45,924
What?

552
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,392
You want me to get a gun?

553
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,393
Go up against him?

554
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,161
(scoffs)
He would love that.

555
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,163
Self-defense,
everything above board, legal.

556
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,898
Then why don't you
go to Judge Rand?

557
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,600
Tell him the truth,
and he'll protect you.

558
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,802
You saw his papers;
he is a marshal.

559
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,838
He has every right in the world
to take me in.

560
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,107
And you're gonna stand there
and let him do it.

561
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,268
Well, what else can I do?

562
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,044
We can go away.

563
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,245
We can go East.

564
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,346
Jason, please, please.

565
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,647
They can't reach that far.

566
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,217
Even if we have to spend
the rest of our lives hiding,

567
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,752
I don't care.

568
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,688
I'd much rather have you that
way than not have you at all.

569
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:17,956
Please.

570
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,959
Oh, if we only could.

571
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,951
If we only could.

572
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:28,032
It would be like
starting from the beginning.

573
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:31,025
No West, no past tense.

574
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,174
Oh, Jason.

575
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,876
Jason, we must do it.

576
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,144
We must. We can.

577
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,879
I know we can.

578
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,347
You get some things packed.

579
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,882
There's still Esketh.

580
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,617
Don't forget,
I tried this once before.

581
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,453
Oh, but don't forget,
you didn't have me before.

582
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,654
Now, I can handle him.

583
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,523
I think I know a ladies' man
when I see one.

584
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,891
Yes, I know
how to deal with him.

585
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,058
No, I can't let you do that.

586
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,293
He's too dangerous.

587
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,829
Oh, no, darling, really,
he won't be with me.

588
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,998
Please, trust me.

589
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,500
Trust me.

590
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,833
Now, hurry; hurry and get
something packed, please.

591
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:10,909
Adam, I find this a land
of unexpected pleasures.

592
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,477
Little did I dream that you'd be

593
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,746
making the trip
to Sacramento with me.

594
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,815
Well, since I am,
don't you think it, uh, might be

595
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,716
a good idea to let me in
on the truth?

596
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,386
Well, isn't that
a rather strange way

597
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,720
to put a question, Adam?

598
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,556
Well, as Pa and I both told you,

599
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,358
we think a great deal
of Mariette.

600
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:30,662
And so do I think a lot of her.

601
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,566
That's why I tried to spare her
the seriousness of Jason's case.

602
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,534
Then he's not just
a missing witness.

603
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,369
No.

604
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,404
A missing criminal.

605
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,440
But on your honor, Adam,

606
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,443
this is to go no further
in Virginia City.

607
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,713
By turning state's evidence,
he'll be able to return here

608
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,416
with no damage
to his so-called reputation.

609
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,750
Well, I appreciate whatever

610
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,352
protection you can give
Mariette.

611
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,857
You know,
I believe we think alike.

612
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,693
I even had him listed
in the documents as a witness,

613
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,559
not as one of the accused.

614
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,765
Thank you for telling me.

615
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,934
Pa'd like to get
the best lawyer he can find.

616
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:13,404
Adam, I don't want you
to think it rude of me,

617
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,640
but under the circumstances,
I think it best

618
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,876
not to return to the Ponderosa.

619
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,577
I'll take a room here
at the hotel,

620
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,946
and if it's convenient for you,
we'll leave, shall we say,

621
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,548
first thing in the morning?

622
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,616
Fine with me.

623
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,351
I'll bring your luggage
in with me.

624
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,519
And bring along
your best suit, Adam.

625
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,355
I know some pretty girls
in Sacramento,

626
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,224
and perhaps we can forget some
of the more unpleasant aspects

627
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,659
of a marshal's duties.

628
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,060
Very good.

629
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,696
If I, um, seemed a little cool
toward you,

630
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:42,567
it's--was only because of
my concern for Mariette.

631
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,470
Well, I, uh, better let Pa know
what's happened.

632
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,063
- Right.
- See you in the morning.

633
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,508
MAN:
The Clevengers!

634
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,710
(horse neighing)

635
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,712
Clevengers!

636
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,613
The Clevengers!

637
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,084
(dogs barking in distance)

638
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,085
Gid Clevenger.

639
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,553
I'd hoped this wouldn't happen.

640
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,526
Maybe we can reason with him.

641
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,194
No, Ben.

642
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,629
Let me try it.

643
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,308
Hello, Gideon.

644
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,876
We haven't seen you
for some time.

645
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,111
Save your words, Judge.

646
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,514
I know Gerald Esketh's
in this town.

647
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:30,515
Now, where is he?

648
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,517
I really don't know, Gideon.

649
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,519
Look at me when I talk to you.

650
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,654
I don't like fellers
who can't look straight.

651
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:40,591
You've lost three sons
trying to fight a private war.

652
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:43,294
Why don't you just find yourself
a rocking chair

653
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,229
and live to a ripe old age, huh?

654
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,733
I've got a better idea
that'll help a lot more people.

655
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,035
You deliver Esketh to me,

656
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:54,138
I'll get out of Virginia City
and stay out.

657
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:58,509
You don't, I got 20 more men
anxious to ride in here.

658
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,501
You're not serious.

659
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,851
I've offered you a fair deal.

660
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,911
Get me that back shooter.

661
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,727
(knocking)

662
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,862
Come in.

663
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,230
Oh, my dear Adam.

664
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,133
They tell me Gideon Clevenger's
looking for me.

665
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,868
He's threatened
to tear the whole town apart

666
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:25,703
unless you're handed over
to him.

667
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:29,474
He seems a truly
dedicated scoundrel,

668
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:33,745
faithful to his purpose,
honest to a fault.

669
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:37,148
I want you to know that
Pa and I will be backing you up.

670
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,140
Thank you kindly, Adam.

671
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,960
Shall we, uh,
look into the matter?

672
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,536
Well, you're certainly a cool
one, I'll have to admit that.

673
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,090
What are you going to do?

674
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,859
Make our friend
a sporting proposition.

675
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,851
He's in the saloon?

676
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,128
Clevenger!

677
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,612
Can you hear me?

678
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,248
I can hear you, Esketh.

679
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,184
It's a voice
I'm not likely to forget.

680
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,985
You made this personal,
Clevenger,

681
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,887
so let's keep it that way.

682
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,789
There's no sense in
harming innocent people.

683
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:55,059
You've made yourself a deal.

684
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:58,729
But if the Cartwrights or anyone
else tries to get into it,

685
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,755
I'm cutting my boys loose.

686
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,742
You're free
to change your mind anytime.

687
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:12,944
Thank you, friend,

688
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,180
but I find the arrangement
most satisfactory.

689
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,172
I've already
planned my strategy.

690
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,737
I don't like this, Adam.

691
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,968
I'm beginning to think
Esketh knows what he's doing.

692
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:12,336
Make your play, you filthy
little back shooter.

693
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,067
You first, my dear Clevenger.

694
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,724
(gunshots)

695
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,192
(women screaming)

696
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:46,331
You'd better finish
the job, Esketh.

697
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:51,067
(onlookers murmuring)

698
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,729
Adam, you'd better
get the doctor

699
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,664
and see what
we can do for Clevenger.

700
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,708
How is Clevenger?

701
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,309
He'll pull through.

702
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,301
He wants to see you.

703
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,057
I took the liberty of dropping
in without knocking.

704
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,357
Well, I was sure
the door was locked.

705
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,734
You grow lovelier
each time I see you.

706
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,904
I must look a sight.

707
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,507
A sight, indeed.

708
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,710
The very kind that inspired
Wordsworth to rhapsodize,

709
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,480
"She was a phantom of delight

710
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,816
when first she gleaned
upon my sight."

711
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,319
Now, you know
that you much prefer

712
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,055
those sophisticated
San Francisco women

713
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,724
to a country girl like myself.

714
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:17,395
I hope someday to prove
the error of that statement

715
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:25,102
by putting you beside them--
a ruby in a diadem of glass.

716
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:28,606
Oh, you mean the ones
from the Barbary Coast?

717
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,409
What lies has Jason
been telling you about me?

718
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,377
Why none, none.

719
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:36,781
It's just that I know so little
about San Francisco.

720
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:40,651
It was only a chance remark.

721
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,421
Please accept my apology.

722
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,390
I'm thin-skinned when it
comes to matters of honor.

723
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,127
Oh, I apologize, too.

724
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:53,030
I had planned to look
much more presentable

725
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,700
the next time we met.

726
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,469
Then it was rude of me
to arrive so unexpectedly,

727
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,172
but I thought I better
tell you

728
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,873
that Judge Rand suggested

729
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:04,975
that I start back
to Sacramento immediately.

730
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:08,679
Oh, so soon.

731
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,816
You don't know how
lonely it gets.

732
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,852
I mean, Jason has
to work such long hours.

733
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,448
I've never met anyone
like you, Gerald.

734
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,101
A little more time
won't matter.

735
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,833
Could you come to the hotel to
let me know when Jason is ready?

736
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,009
Just as long as you
aren't too impatient.

737
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:43,814
Now, let us not misunderstand
my honorable intentions.

738
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:48,275
I understand
your intentions perfectly.

739
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:05,236
- You little fool.
- (gasps)

740
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,905
You're going to learn just who
you've been playing games with.

741
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,840
Who?

742
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,810
What are you?

743
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,211
He's Murdoch's hatchet man.

744
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:22,953
Around the Embarcadero, they
call him the Dude Butcher Boy.

745
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:26,590
It's my reckoning he came here

746
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,692
to lead Jason Blane
to the slaughter,

747
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,428
'cause Jason knows too much.

748
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,062
Jason was mixed up with Murdoch?

749
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,765
He was the spotter
for the bunch.

750
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,168
That's easy for an assayer.

751
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,771
Whenever he'd see gold bullion,
he'd tell Esketh.

752
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,675
That slimy killer would lead
his night riders,

753
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,377
claiming they were vigilantes.

754
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:50,047
That was a good cover for him.

755
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:54,418
But Jason got sick,
and he quit and ran away.

756
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:58,189
Jason was too soft
for Esketh's shooting parties.

757
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:01,225
I saw him later
in Virginia City,

758
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,861
but I figured
let a feller go straight

759
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,129
that's trying hard.

760
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,597
And your oldest son?

761
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:11,469
Esketh back-shot my boy at
our California stamp mill,

762
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,098
while his outfit looted.

763
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:20,678
The other two--

764
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,080
you know about, Ben.

765
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,416
They wasn't killers.

766
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,986
They heard Esketh was
headed this way.

767
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,581
They mistook Adam for him.

768
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,731
That fool, Jason.

769
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:43,501
Why couldn't he tell us
the trouble he was in?

770
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,936
There's a thing called
reputation, Ben,

771
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,439
especially if you're married
to a woman like Mariette.

772
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:52,604
I'd swear she never knew
that Jason had a record.

773
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,491
- Mariette...
- No, don't!

774
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,826
It's all right, honey,
it's me, it's Adam.

775
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:09,827
Oh, Adam.

776
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,762
Where's Jason? Was Esketh here?

777
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,297
Yes.

778
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:18,769
He hit me and he slapped me,
and he wanted me to tell...

779
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,337
Did he tell you
who he really is?

780
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:23,974
Yes, and he said terrible
things about Jason.

781
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:26,810
Where is Jason? Where is he?
Where is he?

782
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,814
The... Silver Corazon Mine.

783
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,950
I'm supposed to meet him there.

784
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:37,354
He gave me
a little trail... map.

785
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,156
He took it. It's gone.

786
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:40,624
He took it. He took the map.

787
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,992
- Honey, shh, shh. Calm...
- He'll kill Jason.

788
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,994
- He'll...
- Calm down!

789
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:46,497
Now listen, I'll send somebody
to look after you.

790
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,433
Now, don't go away.
You stay right here, okay?

791
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,204
Jason?

792
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,216
Jason!

793
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,822
You can't get away, Jason.

Can you hear me?

795
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,817
Would you like to hear what
happened to your wife?

796
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,959
She died in my arms, Jason.

797
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,928
I held her.

798
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,920
I watched her.

799
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,998
Can you take that
and run away with it?

800
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,533
In here, Esketh!

801
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,435
Come on!

802
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,780
Come on!

00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:37,501
The unruly emotions, Jason.

807
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:41,705
But don't be ashamed because
they've destroyed you.

They've conquered more men

The sound will bring

We're in here!

We're in here!

Don't turn around.

Mariette?

She's all right.

819
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,068
I'm taking you in, Esketh.

820
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:55,279
It's hot in here, isn't it?

821
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:59,016
Or is it just the uncomfortable
circumstances I find myself in?

It might have worked
on Clevenger,

824
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:08,091
but it won't work on me.

825
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:12,429
My dear Adam, you don't think
that I'd be childish,

826
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,625
so childish as to pull
the same chestnut twice?

827
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,805
I wish you hadn't
tried it, Esketh.

828
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:24,641
I suppose I...

829
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:28,635
I knew all along that this would
happen... someday.

830
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:40,357
Thank you for your...
hospitality, Ben.

831
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,627
I never dreamed
that Gerald Esketh w...

832
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,096
would be defeated by emotions.

833
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:47,831
I can't believe you
ever had any.

834
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:52,169
Oh, yes, I did.

835
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:55,806
I was in love, you know.

836
00:47:55,806 --> 00:48:00,540
I was in love
with Gerald Esketh.

837
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,051
We'll miss you very much.

838
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:13,690
Thank you, Ben,
thank you for everything.

839
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,659
Judge Rand said it shouldn't be
more than a year.

840
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,493
And that will be the longest
year of my life.

841
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:23,066
Well, I'm glad you made the
decision on your own, Jason.

842
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,069
When you come back, your house
will be here, waiting.

843
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,537
Thank you, Ben.

844
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,239
Good-bye.

845
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,809
We'll be waiting, too.

846
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,045
Things will be just the same.

847
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,605
Thank you, Adam.
