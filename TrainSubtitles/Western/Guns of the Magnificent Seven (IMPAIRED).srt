going to do something?

When are we going to get
the soldiers off our necks?

11

sympathetic to our cause

21
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,675
will come over to our side.

22

The Presidente will run
before our strength.

23

27
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,524
He is a bandit and a thief.

Lobero wants from the revolution

is the same as we want.

32

Well, he says
he wants to help.

33

And he has many guns.

Only his guns.

For the revolution, I would
make a bargain with the devil.
