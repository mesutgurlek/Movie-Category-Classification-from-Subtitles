can only be a formality.

I was just defending you.

00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,411

Well, welcome to Little River,  
Mr. Feathergill.                

811
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:53,691
    Nice meeting you again,     
        Mr. Luddington.         

812
00:56:53,693 --> 00:56:55,293
   Well, is Mr. Madden here?    

813
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,428
No, he'll be around later.      

814
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:00,065
Boys, this is Jim Feathergill.  

815
00:57:00,067 --> 00:57:01,633
He's a federal marshal.         

816
00:57:01,635 --> 00:57:03,534
  He came all the way           
   from Washington.             

817
00:57:03,536 --> 00:57:05,503

          doing here?           

820
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,192

   that proclamation, Frank.    

821
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,763

             Who found this out?

Why, Luddington did here        
at the request of a Mr. Madden.

00:58:25,786 --> 00:58:27,085
                    Madden, huh?

00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:32,857

Ah. I'm his lawyer, Sebo.       

849
00:58:35,495 --> 00:58:37,596
He paid me to find out          
all I could about Warbonnet.    

850
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:39,313
            You're a fool, Ames.
            Whatever he paid you

851
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:40,899
                I'd have doubled
                  to know this.

  What happens to Tuck Ordway?  

853
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,172
Why, we're on our way now       
to put him off                  

854
00:58:48,174 --> 00:58:50,609
and have his land surveyed      
for quarter sections.           

855
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:53,177
Some soldiers are coming in     
to see that he leaves peaceably,

00:58:53,179 --> 00:58:55,046
and they'll also guard          
against any sooners

Now, where's your livery stable?

863
00:59:16,685 --> 00:59:17,685
              Hey, did you hear?

864
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,654
      Warbonnet's public domain!

865
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:58,376
          I told you to hold off
              on the marshal    

866
00:59:58,378 --> 00:59:59,794
        until I had my showdown.

867
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:02,379
Why wait? Look, Larry,          
homestead that quarter section  

868
01:00:02,381 --> 01:00:04,148
where the ranch buildings       
are standing,                   

869
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:06,518
and you've got the sweetest     
little ranch around.            

870
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,869
You and me                      
could handle it easily.         

871
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:10,137
    I wanted Tuck Ordway's hide,
            not his home.       

872
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,506
                Had I known then
                what I know now,

873
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:12,706
       I'd have never come back.

874
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:14,742
What do you mean                
"know now"?                     

875
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:16,477
            Ordway's half-blind.

876
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:18,879
             He can't see beyond
            the end of his hand.

877
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:20,649
                  I just came   
               near killing him.

878
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:22,400
Well, isn't that what           
you came back here for?         

879
01:00:22,402 --> 01:00:24,819
         Not to shoot it out    
     with an old man half-blind.

880
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:26,237
You can still hurt him my way   

881
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,239
and do yourself some good       
in the bargain.                 

882
01:00:28,241 --> 01:00:31,509
 Get this straight, Ames, I want
    no part of Warbonnet land.  

883
01:00:31,511 --> 01:00:33,812
        As far as I'm concerned,
         the whole game's over. 

884
01:00:33,814 --> 01:00:36,147
        I have one more piece   
    of business to take care of,

885
01:00:36,149 --> 01:00:38,049
             then I'm riding out
                  for good.     

886
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,150
You know, you've been making    
an idiot out of yourself        

887
01:00:40,152 --> 01:00:41,686
because of Ordway's daughter--  

888
01:01:11,767 --> 01:01:13,134
    I thought you had more sense

889
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:15,603
     than to ride back into town
      with Madden still around. 

890
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:16,905
I miss very much                
the eating,                     

891
01:01:16,907 --> 01:01:19,791
the drinking,                   
and...the girls.                

892
01:01:19,793 --> 01:01:21,843
                Don't look at me
                   like that.   

893
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:24,895
How can I forget                
that you're Sebo's girl.        

894
01:01:24,897 --> 01:01:26,464
Ah, but if you were not--       

895
01:01:26,466 --> 01:01:29,184
           I'd sooner hold hands
            with a rattlesnake. 

896
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,535
Or perhaps                      
with Señor Madden?              

897
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,230
         Anyway, watch yourself.

898
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:43,964
           He's gunning for you.

899
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:46,767
You know,                       
he should be careful.           

900
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:49,070
Someday he's liable             
to catch me.                    

901
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:50,071
AMES:

902
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:51,072
                       Hm?      

903
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:52,574
I wanna talk to you.            

904
01:01:53,809 --> 01:01:55,076
                     Come in.   

905
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:33,131
   I came over to tell you--    

906
01:02:35,201 --> 01:02:36,901
               What do you want?

907
01:02:36,903 --> 01:02:40,538
Some drunken cowpoke reached    
for me instead of a bottle.     

908
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:42,841
     It'll only take me         
    a minute to mend it.        

909
01:02:44,443 --> 01:02:46,027
           Are you sure of this?

910
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:47,995
Madden just told me--           

911
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:50,631
         She belongs to Sebo.   
     I have no secrets from her.

912
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:52,033
Madden just told me             
all about it.                   

913
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:53,600
He said Ordway                  
can't see any farther           

914
01:02:53,602 --> 01:02:55,469
than the end of his hand.       

915
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,271
      That's why he hasn't shown
           his face in town     

916
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,740
                  all this time.

917
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:01,575
              Hm. We both would 
            have been better off

918
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:03,577
         if you'd have tied up  
      with me instead of Madden.

919
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,546
That's why I'm here, Pearlo.    

920
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:07,048
We can cash in                  
on this land rush               

921
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,549
if we play it smart.            

922
01:03:11,353 --> 01:03:12,386

01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:44,831
                  Come closer   
               so I can see you.

1135
01:21:48,903 --> 01:21:50,303
            All this            
     wouldn't have happened     

1136
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:51,688
          if I hadn't been      

1137
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:54,407
                so pigheaded    
            and driven you off. 

1138
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:57,411
         Maybe it isn't too late
            to make up for it.  

1139
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,679
                  I'm asking you
                     to stay.   

1140
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,849
             Come on, Hap.      

1141
01:22:13,644 --> 01:22:15,378
                 Is it too late,
                     Corinna?   

1142
01:22:17,114 --> 01:22:18,147
   Does it matter?              

1143
01:22:18,982 --> 01:22:21,051
                It always has,  
             and it always will.

1144
01:22:21,053 --> 01:22:24,304
   Oh, Larry, five years        
    is such a long time.        

1145
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:26,455
               We can put       
       all those years behind us

1146
01:22:26,457 --> 01:22:28,491
            by walking through  
                that door.      

1147
01:22:30,561 --> 01:22:32,362
We'd better go in.              
Let me take care of that.       

1148
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:34,364
             [¶¶¶]
