1
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,091
Are you serious?

2
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,135
You saw Burt Reynolds in Garrison?

3
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:11,887
Yep. Saw him at the gas station.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,015
I rolled up and I said, "Hey,
Bandit. Watch out for them smokies."

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,100
[chuckles] He gave me
the double-gun fingers,

6
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,435
and went... [imitates
Burt Reynolds' Bandit laugh]

7
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,146
Hopped in his car and sped off.

8
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,398
Run on, Bandit, run.

9
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,732
[Colt laughs]

10
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:28,654
Man, Burt Reynolds has
the best mustache ever.

11
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,030
Says who?

12
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:36,244
Hey, I saw Taylor Swift
in a bar in Buffalo once.

13
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,580
- Did you talk to her?
- Yeah, boy.

14
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,041
I went right up to her. I
said, "Hey, I'm Colt Bennett."

15
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,542
She said, "Nice to meet you, Colt.

16
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,920
This is my friend, Leo. He's
gonna throw you out of here."

17
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,130
- [laughs]
- Hey, still counts, though.

18
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,841
Yeah, boy.

19
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,802
I saw Paul Newman in a butcher
shop in Denver once.

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,473
Bought a big rib eye. Bone in.

21
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:56,849
That's a movie star.

22
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,767
[imitates Bandit laugh]

23
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,895
- [Rooster laughs]
- Yeah.

24
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,271
Here's your burgers.

25
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,481
Oh.

26
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,109
Yeah, what is it this time?

27
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,110
Vegetable, turkey or chicken?

28
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,237
Never thought I'd root for chicken.

29
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,490
That's your grass-fed beef.

30
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,327
You've eaten nothing but veggie
burgers in here for the last couple of weeks.

31
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,495
I figured you deserved a treat.

32
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,832
Either a treat or she's
trying to kill you off faster. Ha!

33
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,167
- [imitates Bandit laugh]
- [Beau] Mmm.

34
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,460
[laughs]

35
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,338
I wasn't this happy on
the day you were born.

36
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,467
- Hey, Colt. [sighs]
- Oh, hey, Abby.

37
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,634
- Hi, Abby.
- Hey, guys.

38
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,928
Can I, uh, talk to you for a sec?

39
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,347
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

40
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,349
[Abby chuckles softly]

41
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,101
Don't worry, Colt. I'll watch your beer.

42
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,061
Oh. [scoffs]

43
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,940
Always leaving us for a girl, huh?

44
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,358
Don't talk to me.

45
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,992
I'm... really sorry
about the other night.

46
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:57,654
[Colt laughs]

47
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:59,315
I probably shouldn't
have mixed whiskey

48
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,871
with nine more whiskeys.

49
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,124
- Oh, it happens.
- [chuckles]

50
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,001
Hey, uh, just do me a favor.

51
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,365
Next time you're gonna try to
kiss me, give me a heads up.

52
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,255
Oh, I can turn the charm down.

53
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,465
I can't turn it off, but
I can turn it down.

54
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,177
[chuckles]

55
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,720
What are you talking about?

56
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,764
- Oh...
- [chuckles]

57
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,767
Okay, the old "I was
too drunk to remember."

58
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,061
- [laughs] Okay. Been there.
- [chuckling] No.

59
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,063
FYI, that does not hold up in court.

60
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,692
I did not try to kiss you.

61
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,526
Uh... yeah, you did.

62
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,903
You were on the couch

63
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,447
and I come over and I
said, "Are you okay?"

64
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,658
And then you were
like... [imitates Abby]

65
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,618
And I was like, "Whoa!"

66
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:42,245
And you were like, "Aw!"

67
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,831
And I was like, "Uh..."

68
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,166
And then you were
like... [imitates vomiting]

69
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,044
Are you serious? I tried to kiss you?

70
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,503
Yeah.

71
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,926
But, I mean, in your defense... this.

72
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,260
[chuckles]

73
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,511
You know, here's the thing.

74
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,306
You didn't respect my
relationship with Heather,

75
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,685
which, I've been told by
someone, is "super not cool."

76
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,938
Wait, who was it? Oh, that was you!

77
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,649
Oh, I guess that makes
you the hypochondriac.

78
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:12,735
[chuckles softly]

79
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:16,113
"Hypocrite." It's hypocrite.

80
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,617
Okay, I can make up words, too. [laughs]

81
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,662
I can't believe I did that to Kenny.

82
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,915
All right, look...

83
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,417
it's not a big deal, okay?

84
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,044
No one's judging you...

85
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,212
except me.

86
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,007
- And God.
- [groans]

87
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,051
- Hey, Colt. Hey.
- Oh, hey, Heather.

88
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,302
Oh, hi, Mrs. Phillips.

89
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,974
Do you have a designated driver or
do you need me to call somebody?

90
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,060
Thanks, I'm fine.

91
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,686
Yeah, that's exactly what you said

92
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:51,439
right before you blew chow on
my favorite Forever 21 shirt.

93
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,609
Okay, I need a drink.

94
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,237
Hey, Abby, make good choices.

95
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,822
God is watching. [chuckles]

96
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,869
- How you doing, Heather?
- I'm bored.

97
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,120
Do you wanna go have sex in your car?

98
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,496
- Hell yeah!
- [chuckles]

99
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,749
Ah! Shit!

100
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,917
I don't have a car.

101
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,334
What about the bathroom?

102
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,087
[clicks tongue] Ah,
no doors on the stalls.

103
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,213
Been caught in there.

104
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,966
Me, too! [chuckles]

105
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,385
- We're perfect for each other.
- Yeah.

106
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,638
You know... there is one other option.

107
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,099
You ever do it in a trailer?

108
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,936
Are you kidding? I was
conceived in a trailer.

109
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,900
- [chuckles]
- I lost my virginity in a trailer.

110
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,940
I had my first girl-on-girl in
a trailer. [laughs]

111
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,193
[stammers] I had my first
girl-on-girl in a trailer!

112
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,195
[both laugh]

113
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,197
Girl, why are we still talking? Come on!

114
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,828

00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,392
And you're sure that your mom
doesn't care that we're in here?

117
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,061
In my 34 years, I've
never heard my mother say,

118
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,647
"Do not have sex with
Heather in my trailer."

119
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,732
- So, we are good.
- [clattering]

120
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:01,111
Hey, how about some mood lighting?

121
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,406
Ooh, you are so romantic.

122
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,074
You know it.

123
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,558
All right, where do you wanna bone?

124
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,554
How about you do me on the kitchenette?

125
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,580
[chuckling] "Bone" appétit.

126

Oh, this is great.

128
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,696
I was hoping I'd see you tonight,

129
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,963
get myself a little early
birthday present.

130
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,215
Oh, you got a birthday comin' up?

131
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,383
Yeah, on Monday.

132
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,842
So what're you gettin' me?

133
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,805
- Start unwrapping.
- [chuckles]

134
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,940
- You are so hot.
- Mmm.

135
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,441
[Heather] I want you.

136
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,567
- [breathing heavily]
- [Colt] Hey.

137
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,070
I know you've done it in
a trailer before, but...

138
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,989
- you ever do it on a kitchenette?
- [both chuckle]

139
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,491
I feel like my answer might
just disappoint you.

- Yeah, it is.

00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,757
Oh, is that a good thing? [chuckles]

Oh, my God!

146
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,764
- Oh, my God, Heather!
- No, there's a fire!

147
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,891
What? Whoa!

148
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,477
Oh, shit!

149
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,564
- [Colt] Oh!
- Keep going.

150
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,067
Oh!

151
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,403
Here, Colt!

152
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,364
Oh. Thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

153
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,448
Oh, shit!

[both sigh]

155
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,170
So...

156
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,588
where were we?

157
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,428
What the hell happened here?

158
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:55,517
Well, as it turns out, uh, Heather
here is a bit of a trailer...

159
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,519
enthusiast.

160
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,772
And when I told her that you had an
Airstream, she got real excited.

161
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,608
So I brought her out
here to show her and...

162
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,819
[stammers] as we're approaching the
trailer, she says, "I smell smoke."

163
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,696
I smell bullshit.

164
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,074
What you smell is a hero.

165
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,202
'Cause I ran headlong into
this aluminum inferno of death.

166
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,405
And then what happened, Colt?

167
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,749
You two took off your clothes and
you... you threw them into the fire?

168
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,461
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Bennett.

169
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,173
Ah, it's all right,
sweetie. As long as you're okay.

170
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,924
Yeah, that's the important thing.

171
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,178
I mean, I not only saved your
home, I saved an actual human life.

172
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,139
There's that bullshit again.

173
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,100
Could be worse.

174
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,311
Shouldn't take more than
a week to repair the damage

175
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,687
and air it out from the smoke.

176
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,732
[exhales sharply] I suppose I
could stay with my friend, Barb.

177
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,058
Although she has
that annoying wiener dog

178
00:08:47,084 --> 00:08:48,845
Dusty that keeps humping my leg.

179
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,112
[imitates Barb] "It means he likes you."

180
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,407
It means you didn't
train your damn dog, Barb.

181
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,845
You should just stay at the house, Ma.

182
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,829
I don't think that's a good idea.

183
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,665
Why? I mean, you're there all
the time, anyway. Right, Dad?

184
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,294
Yeah, I suppose that makes sense.

185
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,754
You already got a
spare toothbrush there,

186
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,882
some clothes and that little
kit you do your nails with.

187
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,551
Oh, uh, actually, that's mine.

188
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,097
But you're welcome to use it.

189
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,932
You sure you wanna date my sister?

190
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,519
So what do you think, Beau?

191
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,812
Stay at the house?

192
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,398
I think it's settled.

193
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,400
We'll have even numbers again.

194
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,111
Two boys, two girls.

195
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,698
You are insane.

196
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,493
There's no way Johnnie Walker
kicks Jack Daniels' ass.

197
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,214
Why not?

198
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:41,396
'Cause Johnnie
Walker's a weak-ass bitch.

199
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,582
[scoffs]

200
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,709
Walking around with
that top hat and cane.

201
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,837
Please, man. He's from Scotland.

202
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,040
Them boys know how to fight.

203
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,258
You ever seen Braveheart?

204
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,927
You don't mess with Mel Gibson.

205
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,181
Especially if you're Jewish.

206
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,937
Hey, you know who'd
kick both their asses?

207
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,273
- Jose Cuervo.
- [laughs]

208
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,027
Yeah, every time I mess
with him, he kicks my ass.

209
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,739
Rooster, I need to talk to your brother.

210
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,617
Sweet. I'll be in the
kitchen, pretending not to listen.

211
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,705
Okay, is this about the
"Hillary" bumper sticker on your tractor?

212
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,791
'Cause if it is,
that was Rooster's idea.

213
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,225
Don't offer up my house to anybody

214
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,865
without asking me first.

215
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,594
Okay.

216
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,722
Uh, well, it wasn't anybody, it was Mom.

217
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,349
Especially your mother.

218
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,603
If I'da wanted her here,
I'd have asked her myself.

219
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,788
[Rooster] That's right, Colt. You idiot.

220
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,568
[clicks tongue] Listen, I... I
didn't think it was a big deal,

221
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,778
especially since you guys
are getting along so good.

222
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,489
We are and that's why I
don't wanna change anything.

223
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,413
All right. Well, I'm
sorry, I screwed up.

224
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:01,408
[vehicle approaches]

225
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,996
[Rooster] He didn't mean
it. Kick his ass, Daddy.

226
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,205
[engine turns off]

227
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,418
- Hey, Colt.
- Hi, Mom.

228
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,877
Uh...

229
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,338
Dad's real excited you're
here. I'm gonna step on inside.

230
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,469
- [door closes]
- Are you sure about this?

231
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,262
Nope. Are you?

232
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,638
No.

233
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,765
All right, then. Come on in.

234
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,783
And welcome back
to Cook-a-doodle-do

235
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:32,799
with your host Rooster Bennett.

236
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,989
Our next question
comes from Tim in Arapahoe.

237
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,962
"Dear Rooster, how do you get

238
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:41,725
your scrambled eggs so light and fluffy?

239
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,705
P.S. Your beard is super kick-ass."

240
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,584
Well, thank you,
Tim. And here's the deal.

241
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,694
Making scrambled eggs

242
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:53,904
is like making love
to a beautiful woman.

243
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,091
You wanna be gentle, you
wanna take your time,

244
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,802
you wanna make it
last, but most importantly...

245
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,304
you wanna use a shit-ton of butter.

246
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,141
Hey.

247
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,345
So that's why there's a tub
of margarine in your room.

248
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,898
Why the hell are you
talking to yourself?

249
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,859
Well, you were gone for a
long time and Dad doesn't talk.

250
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,235
Got to adapt or die.

251
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,155
Oh, where is Mom and Dad?

252
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,657
I don't know, man. I'm
not keeping track.

253
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,300
I'm just making eggs and doing my show.

254
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,993
Oh. Word to the wise,

255
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,495
next week is my
south-of-the-border episode,

256
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,914
"Hello, Chorizo."

257
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,584
Let me ask you something.

258
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,308
Should I get a birthday
gift for Heather?

259
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,827
Why the hell would you do that?

260
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,200
She's not your girlfriend. You're
just having sex with her.

261
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,928
It's like, did I get a baby
shower gift for Pregnant Linda?

262
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,451
Of course not, man. It's not my kid.

263
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,635
I'm just having sex with her.

264
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,810
When it comes to stuff like
this... I have a system.

265
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,645
It's too late to stop you, isn't it?

266
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,368
[clicks tongue] I like to break up

267
00:12:52,393 --> 00:12:54,172
with a girl right after Thanksgiving.

268
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,026
You know, avoid all
that holiday gift trouble.

269
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,153
Then, the day after Christmas,

270
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,197
I pick up some girl whose
asshole boyfriend dumped her

271
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,531
to avoid getting her a gift.

272
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,994
Now, tricky part is... is getting
out before Valentine's Day.

273
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,164
So what I like to do is start
a fight at the Super Bowl party.

274
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,250
You know, something like...

275
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,044
"Hey, your sister get some new titties?"

276
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,335
You're the worst person I've ever met.

277
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,410
[chuckles] Thank you.

278
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,387
Good morning, boys.

279
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,598
- Morning, Mom.
- Hey, Ma.

280
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,101
Hey, where's Dad? Is he still sleeping?

281
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,018
Oh, God, no.

282
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,544
He went to work
extra early this morning.

283
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:34,981
I think he's avoiding me.

284
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,024
Really? What's your secret?

285
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,696
I think I should just go to Barb's.

286
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,281
Let that little dog mess
around on my leg for a while,

287
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,950
maybe it'll lose interest.

288
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,290
To be fair, Dad's not gonna show

289
00:13:49,315 --> 00:13:51,188
as much enthusiasm as Barb's dog.

290
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,834
But...

291
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,477
wouldn't it be kind of weird if he did?

292
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,674
I just feel like he
doesn't want me around.

293
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,087
Mom, I had the same problem with Dad

294
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:05,244
when I came back.

295
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,346
Don't worry, he'll warm up to you in...

296
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,476
I'll let you know. [clears throat]

297
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,480
Where the hell is all the margarine?

298
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,991
[crowd cheering on TV]

299
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,123
Oh. Hey, Dad, I was thinking...

300
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,709
Will you stop?

301
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:37,877
Stop thinking.

302
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,296
Stop talking.

303
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,092
How about I meet you
halfway and talk without thinking?

304
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,639
You know, Colt, I had a long day.

305
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,933
All I wanna do is sit down...

306
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,100
and watch the game.

307
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,271
[Maggie] Beau, is that you?

308
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,023
I need to talk to you.

309
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,823
Are you happy?

310
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,034
I ain't been happy in years, Dad.

311
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,745
You taught me well. [clears throat]

312
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,083
Oh! Look at that. Touchdown.

313
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,334
Have fun talking to Mom.

314
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,174
[romantic music playing over radio]

315
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,136
- Maggie?
- Hey.

316
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,848
What are you doing?

317
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,307
[door closes]

318
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,643
Do you really think candles
are a wise choice

319
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,437
based on your recent history?

320
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,472
Look, I... I know we both have

321
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:43,591
trepidations about me staying here.

322
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,904
I just thought... maybe
we could have some fun.

323
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,156
Like what?

324
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,244
I don't know. We used to
like to go dancing together.

325
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,913
[chuckles]

326
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,082
That's true.

327
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,252
So... why don't we go dancing?

328
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,337
I thought you had to work tonight.

329
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,965
I got Maria to cover for me.

330
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,218
I wanted to spend the night with you.

331
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,891
This next question is very important.

332
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,728
Are the boys coming?

333
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,896
[scoffs]

334
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,482
It is date night.

335
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,441
I don't know, Mags.

336
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,069
I've had a long day and...

337
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,072
I don't even remember how to dance.

338
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,283
Come on. Shh. Just dance.

339
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,041
There you go.

340
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,793
You see, you remember how.

341
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,505
Smiling?

342
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,840
Is Beau Bennett smiling?

343
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,010
When you dance this
good, you can't help but smile.

344
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,094
[chuckles]

345
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,269
[chuckles softly]

346
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,273
- [Maggie chuckling]
- This is nice.

347
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,443
It is nice.

348
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,695
Thank you.

349
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,197
I know what I'm gonna do.

350
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,615
I'm gonna take a shower.

351
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,826
[chuckles] That would probably be good.

352
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,620
You wanna join me?

353
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,874
- Save water.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

354
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,545
Bennett takes the snap. He drops back.

355
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,255
He's got a receiver
open over the middle.

356
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:27,820
He throws!

357
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,923
Touchdown!

358
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,174
[imitates fans cheering]

359
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,218
What's that?

360
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,970
There's a flag on the play!

361
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,937
Well, but it's declined 'cause it's just

362
00:17:35,962 --> 00:17:37,247
for excessive handsomeness.

363
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,684
- Hey, Colt.
- Hey, Abby.

364
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,893
What you doing here?

365
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,842
Well, I heard your
mom needed new drapes,

366
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,420
so Kenny got these from his hotel.

367
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,982
Can't use them 'cause they
don't match the carpet.

368
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,233
[laughs]

369
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,403
[stammers] Just to be clear, Kenny's
carpet don't match his...

370
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,073
- Don't. No, don't, don't, don't...
- [laughing]

371
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,242
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

372
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,161
[smacks lips] Listen,
can I ask you something?

373
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:04,041
Look, Abby, no matter
how many times you ask,

374
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,835
I'm not gonna make out with you.

375
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,796
That's actually what I
wanted to talk to you about.

376
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:10,923
Oh.

377
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,260
Did you tell anyone
about the other night?

378
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,805
- I put it on Facebook.
- What?

379
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,249
- I snapchatted it.
- No, you didn't.

380
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,307
- I tweeted it.
- No!

381
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,475
No, I didn't do it. No, of course not.

382
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,227
- I would never do something like that.
- [sighs] Okay.

383
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,311
My lips are sealed.

384
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,939
Unless you try to pry 'em
open with your tongue again.

385
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,901
[both laugh]

386
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,903
Just, Kenny was acting weird.

387
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,279
You know, we went to
dinner the other night

388
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,488
and when the waitress
came up and she said,

389
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,490
"Hi, I'm Stephanie. I'm
gonna be your waitress,"

390
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,903
he didn't say, "Hi, I'm Kenny,

391
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:39,434
and I'm gonna be your customer."

392
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,078
It's his favorite joke.

393
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,123
Oh... okay.

394
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,833
So, these drapes aren't for my mom.

395
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,002
They're to keep me quiet.

396
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,586
They're hush drapes.

397
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,964
Yeah.

398
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,717
Well, I appreciate you
being so cool about this.

399
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,678
Yeah.

400
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,639
Hey, you know what? I
got a question for you.

401
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,642
Listen, no matter how
many times you ask me,

402
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,226
I'm not gonna make out with you.

403
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,687
- [laughs]
- Come on.

404
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,147
[laughs] Well, uh, seriously, though.

405
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,484
All right, so, if you're
in, like, a casual relationship...

406
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,528
- Mmm-hmm.
- are you obligated

407
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,655
to get someone a birthday present?

408
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,575
Yes, I think you should
buy Heather a birthday gift.

409
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,702
No, come on. No, this
is not what you think.

410
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,204
I mean, we're just having
fun, fooling around.

411
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,831
Rooster said I didn't
have to get her a present.

412
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,042
Ooh. Taking relationship
advice from that guy?

413
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,586
He dumped my friend Sharon
four days before Christmas.

414
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,630
Oh, that's cutting it close.

415
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:33,798
She must have been hot.

416
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,134
Just don't make the same
mistake you did with me.

417
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,635
What are you talking about?

418
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,221
I gave presents all the time.

419
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,806
Yeah. For Christmas one year,

420
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,100
you got me a Broncos
T-shirt from the gas station.

421
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,476
Whoa, whoa.

422
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,085
That was a commemorative

423
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,462
John Elway retirement shirt jersey.

424
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,772
Limited edition.

425
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,108
Exclusive to Chevron.

426
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,612
Must be why there
was only triple-XLs left.

427
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,184
Yeah, the same size as my love for you.

428
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:00,141
[chuckles]

429
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,492
And what about that birthday?

430
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,744
When you made me that
coupon book for free massages

431
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:04,871
because you clearly forgot

432
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,998
- to get me anything else.
- Look, I did not forget.

433
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,030
On the way to dinner,

434
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:09,816
you asked me how to spell "massages."

435
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,961
It's a complicated word.

436
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,880
It's real close to "messages."

437
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,715
- Oh, boy.
- [chuckles] Hey, look.

438
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,133
Seriously, though,
what should I get her?

439
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,468
Hmm... what would someone her age want?

440
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,014
Ooh! You could take her to the
mall and get her ears pierced.

441
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,181
Shut up.

442
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,017
And then you guys
could get a Happy Meal.

443
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,770
- Very funny.
- [laughs]

444
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,104
Hey, um...

445
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,398
do you wanna make out?

446
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,565
Get out. No!

447
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,989
What's a bag of weed
doing in the vegetable crisper?

448
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,034
[clicks tongue] Well,
I told Dad it was kale.

449
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,786
That way I knew he'd never touch it.

450
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,933
And how do you know it isn't, Mother?

451
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,333
'Cause I grow kale in my garden.

452
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,513
Maybe next time I come by the bar,

453
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:55,904
we'll smoke a salad together.

454
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,760
Hey, Ma.

455
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,971
Your trailer is as good as new.

456
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,347
Actually, it's better than new.

457
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,516
I bought you a little gift.

458
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,742
My way of saying I'm sorry,

459
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,460
but I'm not gonna tell you what it is.

460
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,521
Is it a toaster?

461
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,605
Come on. How did you know that?

462
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,567
'Cause my credit card had
a charge for a toaster.

463
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,720
- Brisket's ready.
- [Rooster] Ooh!

464
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,112
Oh, so is the salad.

465
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,117
Good, I can use it to garnish my meat.

466
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,038
All right. You don't
have to eat any salad.

467
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,125
I'm not gonna ruin our first
family dinner in ten years.

468
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,087
It's just red meat
twice this week, Beau.

469
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,005
Next Sunday we can smoke a tofu.

470
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,133
Or we can just smoke some kale.

471
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,427
Dad's brisket.

472
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,221
That's the best meal
on the entire planet.

473
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,514
And I know 'cause I've
lived in a lot of big cities.

474
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:50,101
Orlando and Saskatchewan.

475
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,477
I get the end piece.

476
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,020
Uh, then I get the bigger one.

477
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,230
The hell you do.

478
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,857
I should get the other
one then 'cause I'm older.

479
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,817
[scoffs] Well, I'm better looking.

480
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,861
I'm not willing to concede that...

481
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,713
but I also don't see how that's related.

482
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,284
[Beau] Thank you for this wonderful
meal we're about to eat.

483
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,703
It's been a long
time since the four of us

484
00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:12,230
sat down like this together...

485
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,792
and I'm grateful to you for
allowing that to happen.

486
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,233
May the sun shine, the rain fall,

487
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:21,656
the grass grow, and
the herd stay healthy.

488
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,261
- Amen.
- [all] Amen.

489
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,387
- Mom!
- Mom!

490
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,223
Whatever, I gave you both life.

491
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,019
[country music playing on radio]

492
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,728
[softly] Wow.

493
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,397
What a beautiful, clear night.

494
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,650
God, I can see every star.

495
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,236
And every government satellite.

496
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,033
I bet they're looking at us right now.

497
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,825
[sighs]

498
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,748
Well, come on, let's give 'em a show.

499
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:55,874
[Beau chuckles]

500
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,669
Ah, Maggie...

501
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,274
You know, you coming back here

502
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,491
turned out to be a pretty good thing.

503
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,053
It did.

504
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,055
I was worried for nothing.

505
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,306
Me, too.

506
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,851
What do you say we do it permanently?

507
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,604
What?

508
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,858
Move back in, Mags.

509
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,654
Okay, probably had enough of this.

510
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,489
[groans] I'm serious.

511
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,392
I mean, there's no reason you should

512
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:31,351
move back to that Airstream

513
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,120
when you ought to be living here.

514
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,706
Beau, I'm not sure that... [sighs]

515
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,873
Listen to me.

516
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,461
We've been going in this
direction for a while now.

517
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,589
I mean, things have been really
good since Colt came back.

518
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,261
Didn't think I'd ever hear
myself saying that.

519
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,600
I mean, you're right. Things
have been really great, so...

520
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,811
let's not do anything to screw it up.

521
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,188
[snickers]

522
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,856
I've been afraid of that, too, but...

523
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,866
you know, these last few days have been

524
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:05,761
some of the best days we've ever had.

525
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,780
Yeah, but, just because they've
been great lately,

526
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,617
uh, it doesn't mean that everything
between us is fixed.

527
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,036
So move in and we'll fix it together.

528
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,621
Oh, it's not that simple. [chuckles]

529
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,374
Well, it can be.

530
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,084
It's either a yes or a no.

531
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,587
Oh, see, that's how
it is with you, Beau.

532
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,714
Your whole world is black and white.

533
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,549
So is that a yes or a no?

534
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,599
You gonna make me do this?

535
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:37,809
Yes.

536
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,646
Then no.

537
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,574
Did you get all that?

538
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,621
[doorbell rings]

539
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,001
Oh!

540
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:04,836
Shit.

541
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,463
- Hey, Colt.
- Hey!

542
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,092
The baby's sleeping.

543
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,763
- You have a baby?
- Yeah, I didn't tell you?

544
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,167
That's not a deal breaker, is it?

545
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,724
I mean...

546
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,145
- Well...
- [laughs]

547
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,814
- Colt, I'm messing with you.
- [sighs] Oh.

548
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,982
It's my sister's. I
just babysit every Sunday

549
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,194
so she and my ex-husband
can have a conjugal visit.

550
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:35,826
Uh, so... your sister
and your ex-husband

551
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,703
who's in jail for...

552
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,539
Oh, my God, you're so gullible.

553
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,790
[both laugh]

554
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,335
- Please sit down.
- Oh, yeah.

555
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:45,919
So, what's going on?

556
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,421
Um...

557
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:51,925
uh, I just wanted to come by and
wish you an early happy birthday.

558
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:54,886
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

559
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,347
You got any big plans?

560
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,390
Yeah, I'm going out to
Telluride to do the birthday circuit.

561
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:02,603
Free appetizers at
Applebee's, free dinner at Denny's,

562
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,026
free dessert at TGI Fridays and then

563
00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:05,463
free drinks all night long at Chili's.

564
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,441
Oh, and I get a Bloomin'
Onion from Outback.

565
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,110
I just don't know if we'll have time.

566
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,405
They give you free drinks
at Chili's on your birthday?

567
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,657
Oh, no, my friend Lizzie works there.

568
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,909
She's dating the manager. He's married.

569
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,914
She gets away with whatever
she wants. [chuckles]

570
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,998
Okay. Well, hey, I, uh...

571
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,916
I wanted to stop by and give you this.

572
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,211
- Oh, my God, Colt.
- [clears throat]

573
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,546
You did not need to do that.

574
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,298
Apparently, I did.

575
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,384
This is my favorite store.

576
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,552
They usually give you a balloon, though.

577
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,096
Yeah, yeah, they were all out.

578
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,724
I'm gonna rip 'em a new one on Yelp.

579
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:47,189
Oh, my God, Colt.

580
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,065
That's beautiful.

581
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:49,988
Well, keep digging.

582
00:26:50,012 --> 00:26:51,467
There's a coupon book in there.

"One free message"?

585
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,869
That's supposed to be... Damn it!

586
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,208
"One free lingerie removal."

587
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,752
Yeah. Well, that's not "limit
one per customer."

588
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,213
So, is it my birthday or yours?

589
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,589
[chuckles]

590
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,341
But, really, I...

591
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,009
I appreciate you thinking of me.

592
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,178
Yeah.

593
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,555
I didn't know we were at this stage.

[chuckles]

595
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,098
Stage?

596
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,393
Yeah, of our relationship.

597
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,978
Relationship?

598
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,482
Yeah, I totally wasn't expecting a gift.

599
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,152
Uh...

600
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,364
Hey, did your sister
get some new titties?

601
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,248
[gasps] Oh.

Okay.

What are you doin' up?

606
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,681
Mom went back to the Airstream.

607
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,349
[clicks tongue] Oh...

608
00:28:04,374 --> 00:28:05,958
Well, what happened?

609
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,020
I asked her to move in.

610
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,105
She said no.

[inhales deeply]

612
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,901
You wanna talk about it?

613

Nope.

I've been here through... all
the stuff with you guys and...

616
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,975
[inhales] I know it makes you

617
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,191
uncomfortable to
hear, but I do love you.

618
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,544
And I love Mom.

619
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,234
And nothing would make me happier

620
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,614
than to see you guys work it out.

621
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,137
But if that's not gonna happen...

622
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,502
I'd like to at least see you
guys stop hurting each other.

623
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,311
Well, that just seems
to be me and your mom.

624
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,691
Then maybe it's time to move on.

625
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:56,860
She's my wife, son.

626
00:28:58,529 --> 00:28:59,613
Yeah.

627
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,325
Well, we're here for you,
whatever you decide to do.

628
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:07,413
Or... at least I am. I don't
know where the fuck Colt is.

629
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,126
I don't know what to do.

630
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,005
I know this is gonna sound crazy, but...

631
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,740
I think you could use a little kale.
