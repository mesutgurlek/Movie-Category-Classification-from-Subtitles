1
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:45,437
- [Man] Hey, Mr. Bartender!
- [Man Chuckles]

2
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,070
I'll see you.

3
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,615
- [Man] Come here, darlin'!!
- Read 'em.

4
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,616
- [Man] Sheriff.
- [Woman] Evening, Sheriff.

5
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:54,346
- Pleasure doin' business with ya...
- Lyin' cheat!

6
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,446
[Man]
Oh, my God!

7
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,759
Mama, it's getting late.

8
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,525
Come here by Mama.

9
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,607
Do you think...

10
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:18,405
Pa and Kathy are watching over us?

11
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,470
Yes, sweetheart, I do.

12
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,512
Is there anything you want
to say to them before we go?

13
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:31,319
I love you,
and I miss you every day.

14
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:38,119
Why don't you go on ahead?
I'll be there in a minute. Okay?

15
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,642
It seems wrong
to leave you here, Willie.

16
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:57,839
And I know that you and Kathy
will look after each other.

17
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,714
And no matter how far away I am...

18
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,780
you will always be in my heart.

19
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,784
I'll see you again.

20
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,813
Pa and I are going to Pennsylvania
to see my sister and her husband.

21
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,826
- Who are you going to visit?
- We're not visiting anyone.

22
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,761
We're going to live
with my grandpa and grandma.

23
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,855
You're leaving home?

24
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,867
My pa was the sheriff
of Tettsford Junction.

25
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,369
He got himself killed
a couple years back.

26
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,133
Gosh, I'm sorry to hear that.

27
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,969
[Missie]
Oh, look, Maddy.

28
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,105
Hyah!
[Man Shouting]

29
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,342
Hyah!

30
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,011
- [Dogs Barking]
- Whoa!

31
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,281
- Whoa!
- Maddy!

32
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,289
[Missie]
Hey, Pa!

33
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,815
- I missed you!
- Oh, I missed you so much!

34
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,522
- Come here, young man!
- Grandpa!

35
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,499
[Missie Giggles]

36
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,604
[Horse Whinnies]

37
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,817
Grandma!

38
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:17,288
My, my, my, Maddy.
How you have grown.

39
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,690
And looking more like your father
with every year.

40
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,853
Do you really think so, Grandma?

41
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,863
I really do, sweetie.

42
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,865
I bet you're hot and thirsty.

43
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,800
- There's fresh-churned buttermilk inside.
- All right!

44
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,308
Welcome home, Missie.

45
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:40,073
It's good to be home, Mama.
I just wish...

46
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,309
I know. I know.

47
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,711
Let's see what you do now.
Your move.

48
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,847
- Yeah, right. King me!
- [Laughing]

49
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,858
- Somebody's been practicing.
- Yes, I have.

50
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,360
Your father found you a house in town.

51
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,363
It's small and it needs some work...

52
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,865
but it's near the school
and the rent is reasonable.

53
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:04,369
Good. On my teacher's pay
I can't afford much.

54
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,372
I really wish you'd reconsider
staying with us...

55
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,374
at least for a little while.

56
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,501
- Do you need the help, Mama?
- No.

57
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:15,104
I really appreciate you and Papa
wanting to help me and Maddy.

58
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:18,116
But I need to stand
on my own two feet right now.

59
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,119
Maddy needs to see that
even though his daddy's gone...

60
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:24,850
he still has one parent
strong enough to take care of him.

61
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,721
The other day...

62
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,696
Maddy asked me what color
his father's eyes were.

63
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,755
He couldn't remember.

64
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,962
Maddy might forget details like that...

65
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,270
but he won't forget the things his father did
with him or the things Willie taught him.

66
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,177
I'm starting to forget little things
about Willie too.

67
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,575
Like that last morning
when we said good-bye.

68
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:56,520
Did I kiss him? I think I did,
but I don't remember.

69
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,149
It's only been three years, Mama.

70
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:03,184
Just like with Maddy, you'll remember
the things that mattered...

71
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:06,254
like how much you and Willie
loved each other.

72
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,790
No one will ever love me that way again.

73
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,736
And I will never love anyone else.

74
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,104
I can't imagine being truly happy again.

75
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,805
That's how I felt
when my first husband died.

76
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,849
And then I met your father.

77
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,185
See, I feel if I were
to love someone else...

78
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,283
that I would be betraying Willie
in some way.

79
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,329
Willie would want you to be happy.

80
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,044
Whoa. Whoa.

81
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,240
It's gonna take a bit of work,
but I can help you out with that, Missie.

82
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,783
That's all right, Pa.
It's gonna be just fine.

83
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,283
Maddy. Look what I found.

84
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,350
It's our Christmas star.

85
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,863
I promise you, Maddy,
I will make this into a nice place.

86
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,734
It won't be like home though.

87
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,297
Do you know
what makes a house a home?

88
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,070
No.

89
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:28,170
Home is where
you'll always have a place...

90
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,976
where you will always feel loved...

91
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,314
and where you will never,
ever be alone.

92
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,844
It might not seem like it now,
Maddy, but...

93
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,483
this place will come to feel like home.

94
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,321
Come here.

95
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:55,038
[Man]
O Lord, how manifold are your works.

96
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,598
We thank you for the sun and the rain...

97
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,668
which help nourish the crops...

98
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,908
and help them grow into sustenance
for our minds and bodies.

99
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,576
In wisdom you have made them all.
Amen.

100
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,279
- [Congregation] Amen!
- I have an announcement.

101
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:12,415
I received this notice from
the Children's Aid Society of New York.

102
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,690
And it says,
"Wanted: Homes for children.

103
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:20,630
"A company of homeless children
from the East will arrive on Friday.

104
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,897
"These children are of various ages
and of both sexes...

105
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,133
"having been thrown
friendless upon the world.

106
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:31,233
We seek good homes with decent families
who will love them as their own. '

107
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,043
Distribution of these children
will take place right here at the church.

108
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:40,415
I know I can count on all of you to open
your hearts to these precious children of God.

109
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,477
God bless you all.

110
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,718
[Chattering]

111
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,555
[Woman]
Pastor Joe! Hi!

112
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:52,428
- Well, I've heard a lot about you, Missie.
- Oh. All good, I trust.

113
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,092
Your father thinks the world of you.

114
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,657
Seems we're neighbors.

115
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,899
My husband and I are just
two farms away from your new house.

116
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,432
All right.
See you tomorrow morning!

117
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,443
- Pastor.
- Ah, Mrs. Pettis.

118
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,638
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Sheriff.

119
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,614
[Woman]
We missed you at Sunday services today.

120
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,514
[Man]
Clara!

121
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,746
- [Clara] He should be comin'!
- That's his choice.

122
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,617
[Woman]
I know. I know.

123
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,123
- We'll see ya.
- Bye.

124
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:22,592
Sheriff Tyler couldn't be bothered
to attend church.

125
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,596
Again.

126
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,360
Well, he's pretty busy
keeping the peace.

127
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,547
We should be going, Mrs. Pettis.

128
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:49,349
Well, it looks like your husband had a reason
for not showing his face in church as well.

129
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,658
There is much work
to be done on the farm...

130
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,854
and we can't afford hired help.

131
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,626
If my husband doesn't do the work,
we don't eat come winter.

132
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,742
[Knocking]

133
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,712
Good day, ma'am. I'm Sheriff Tyler.

134
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,911
Hello, Sheriff. I'm Mrs. LaHaye.

135
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,582
Yes, I know. Small town.
Word gets around.

136
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,558
- I heard about the new teacher.
- What else have you heard?

137
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,324
Your folks are Clark and Marty Davis,
and you have a little boy.

138
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,560
- Maddy.
- Maddy.

139
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,628
Pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Mrs. LaHaye.

140
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,842
Could I have some more, Grandma?

141
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,716
- Mmm. Maddy.
- It's all right, Missie. Sure you can.

142
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,721
You spoil him.

143
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,883
Of course I do.
It's my job as a grandma.

144
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,756
So tell me more about this orphan train
Pastor Joe was talking about.

145
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,857
Now, Marty, you know you're not
well enough to be chasing after a child.

146
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:13,735
- I will be soon.
- For now, we're gonna have to
let other people handle that.

147
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,112
Would you consider
taking in one of those children?

148
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,909
Yeah, Mom! Then I'd get
to have a brother or sister!

149
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:26,440
- No.
- But all my friends have
a bunch of brothers and sisters.

150
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,044
But since Kathy died,
I've had none.

151
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,925
I'm sorry, Mama.

152
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,932
That's all right, Maddy.

153
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,764
It's good to talk about her.

154
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,100
We don't want to forget her.
Right?

155
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,299

It was as if another voice
came out of me saying, "I will."

Maybe it was another's voice.

You think God was speaking through me?

I think God knew that Belinda needs you.

Answer me, boy! Come here, boy!
Better get over here!

can I use your oven to bake some pies?

Pies? Of course.

- I gotta take care of somethin'
for the Fletcher widow.

- Fletcher widow's horse broke loose.

338
00:26:27,017 --> 00:26:30,885
He fell in a gully and broke his leg.
She asked me to put him down for her.

Shouldn't you at least try?

I'll check his leg.
If I can save his life, I will.

345

But if the bone is shattered, would you rather
I leave him to be eaten alive by coyotes?

Do you think there's enough berries
for a pie?

Not hardly.

Apparently, he fell.

I tore my clothes. I'm sorry, Mama.

- Sure. Come on, little fella.

Come along, Belinda.

381
00:30:55,385 --> 00:30:59,321
I don't think it's too bad.
It bled a lot, but it's not broken.

00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:01,584
- Thank you, Sheriff.
- I didn't do anything.

00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:21,700
Nothing.

You're a very brave boy.

392
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:39,928
Missie told me about
how you took care of Maddy.

393
00:31:39,996 --> 00:31:42,487
How did you know how
to get the bleeding to stop?

394
00:31:42,565 --> 00:31:45,227
My mama taught me stuff.

395
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:50,068
She used to be a midwife,
so she knew all about fixing people.

396
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:53,438
At the orphanage there were
300 kids and only one nurse...

397
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:56,137
so I helped out.

00:31:58,214 --> 00:32:00,148
Yeah.

It made me feel good.

401
00:32:02,552 --> 00:32:04,850
Have you ever thought about
becoming a nurse?

402
00:32:04,921 --> 00:32:08,857
Me, a nurse? I don't think so.

403
00:32:08,925 --> 00:32:10,984
Why not?

404
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,223
Someone like me
can't do something like that.

405

Poor.

408
00:32:20,937 --> 00:32:24,065
Plain old poverty can't keep you from
doing something you really want to do.

409
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:28,136
Only poverty of spirit can do that.

410
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:33,410
My mama always wanted to be a nurse.

411
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:35,417
She never got the chance to.

412
00:32:35,485 --> 00:32:38,818
Your mama was never able
to pursue her dream.

413
00:32:38,888 --> 00:32:42,380
I think she'd be very proud if you were
able to do something she couldn't.

No matter how early we leave,
we are always running late.

00:36:46,802 --> 00:36:49,327
I'll see you.

[Thunderclap,
Thunder Continues Rumbling]

474
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,461
I brought food.

475
00:38:34,243 --> 00:38:37,576
- It smells really good.
- You gotta hide it from 'em.

476
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:40,241
I'll put it under my bed.

477
00:38:40,316 --> 00:38:42,841
I'll try to bring something better
tomorrow night.

478
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:46,911
I hate it here, Lindy.
He hits me, and she yells at me.

479
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:51,323
I don't want to stay.
Can't I come live with you?

480
00:38:51,394 --> 00:38:54,386
I don't know how Mrs. LaHaye
would feel about that.

481
00:38:54,463 --> 00:38:57,398
And even if she were okay with it...

482
00:38:57,466 --> 00:39:00,401
Mr. And Mrs. Pettis probably
wouldn't let her take you.

483
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:02,334
I miss you somethin' awful.

484
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:04,532
Let's run away from here right now.

485
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:07,007
Jacob, you know we can't leave.

486
00:39:07,076 --> 00:39:09,135
Even if we could leave...

487
00:39:09,211 --> 00:39:11,771
how would Papa find us?

488
00:39:11,847 --> 00:39:16,307
Least this way, the orphanage
can tell him we were sent here.

489
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:19,218
I promise I'll get you out of here, Jacob.

490
00:39:19,288 --> 00:39:21,950
It just can't be tonight.

491
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:24,993
You're gonna leave me again?

492
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:28,155
I'll never leave you
longer than I have to.

493
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:31,427
I'll be back tomorrow. Okay?

494
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:35,158
At least you're safe, thank God.

495
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,863
Look, it is late
and we are both exhausted...

496
00:40:41,937 --> 00:40:44,462
so we will talk about this
in the morning.

497
00:40:47,543 --> 00:40:50,512
Now go to bed, Belinda.

498
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:08,595
Last night wasn't the first time
you sneaked out, was it?

499
00:41:12,168 --> 00:41:17,003
I want to know where you went
and why you stole food.

500
00:41:21,744 --> 00:41:25,077
Members of a family
need to trust each other.

501
00:41:25,147 --> 00:41:27,945
- So?
- I don't understand.

502
00:41:28,017 --> 00:41:29,951
What do you want?

503
00:41:31,353 --> 00:41:33,412
I have to stay here.

504
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:36,049
If you don't want me,
I can find work somewhere.

505
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:39,288
I'm a hard worker.
All I ask for is food and a bed.

506
00:41:39,361 --> 00:41:41,295
Belinda, I want you.

507
00:41:41,363 --> 00:41:43,831
My family wants you.

508
00:41:43,899 --> 00:41:48,927
And I'm not gonna send you to work
when you should go to school and be a child.

509
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:52,872
I ain't been a child for a long time.

510
00:42:03,953 --> 00:42:06,080
I'm worried about her safety.

511
00:42:06,155 --> 00:42:10,751
I'll keep a close watch over her, of course,
but I can't stay up all night, every night.

512
00:42:10,826 --> 00:42:13,761
And if she's determined to sneak out,
she's going to just do it.

513
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:17,094
Instead of trying to stop something
you can't stop, just let her go and...

514
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:20,727
- Let her go? Have you lost your mind?
- You didn't let me finish.

515
00:42:20,803 --> 00:42:23,237
Let her go and follow her.
See what this is all about.

516
00:42:23,305 --> 00:42:26,968
It may be nothing. She could be sneaking out
just to prove she doesn't have to stay with you.

517
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:29,476
- Or...
- Or it could be something serious.

518
00:42:29,545 --> 00:42:31,274
Something dangerous, even.

519
00:42:31,347 --> 00:42:33,338
There's only one way to find out.

520

- [Gasps]
- Shh.

[Whispering]
What are you doing here?

522
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:27,291
Same thing you are. Finding out
what that little girl's doing.

523
00:43:44,419 --> 00:43:47,217
Brought peaches.

524
00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:50,725
Oh, boy. Ain't had nothing
like this in a long time.

525
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:53,989
- How are you doing?
- He hit me again.

526
00:43:54,062 --> 00:43:56,496
I didn't do nothin'.

527
00:43:56,565 --> 00:44:00,228
I just didn't move fast enough when
Mrs. Pettis told me to fetch somethin'.

528
00:44:00,302 --> 00:44:03,100
Jacob, I'll get you out of here
just as soon as I can.

529
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:05,162
I hope that's soon, Lindy.

530
00:44:07,442 --> 00:44:09,933
Good night, Jacob.

[Door Closes]

532
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:36,403
Belinda, why have you been
sneaking out to see Jacob?

533
00:44:36,471 --> 00:44:39,463
And why are you bringing him food?

534
00:44:40,642 --> 00:44:42,803
We need the truth now, Belinda.

535
00:44:44,212 --> 00:44:47,978
It'll be better for you to get it all out.

536
00:44:48,049 --> 00:44:50,984
Jacob looked thinner
than when I saw him the last time.

537
00:44:51,052 --> 00:44:53,384
Are Mr. And Mrs. Pettis
treating him right?

538
00:44:53,455 --> 00:44:57,516
- We need the real story.
- It's not a story! It's true!

539
00:44:57,592 --> 00:44:59,617
They're being real mean to Jacob!

540
00:44:59,694 --> 00:45:01,889
What's Jacob's last name?

541
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:07,827
Is it Marshall?

542
00:45:10,138 --> 00:45:12,265
Is Jacob your brother?

543
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:21,515
Belinda,
why did you keep this a secret?

544
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:25,019
At the other towns
the train stopped at...

545
00:45:25,086 --> 00:45:28,112
I saw brothers and sisters
having a real hard time.

546
00:45:30,258 --> 00:45:32,283
Most folks only want one kid.

547
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,727
And others feel bad
about breaking up families...

548
00:45:35,797 --> 00:45:37,788
so they don't take any kid.

549
00:45:39,668 --> 00:45:42,296
I would have taken both of you,
Belinda.

550
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:46,932
You say that now, but you know you
wouldn't have wanted more than one kid.

551
00:45:48,576 --> 00:45:51,511
[Sighs]
Jacob had a better chance on his own.

552
00:45:51,579 --> 00:45:53,342
Why?

553
00:45:53,415 --> 00:45:55,349
'Cause he's younger.

554
00:45:55,417 --> 00:45:58,682
Folks want younger kids.

555
00:45:58,753 --> 00:46:03,213
Once you get to be around my age,
it's harder to find people that'll take 'em.

556
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:06,454
You need to go to bed.

557
00:46:07,629 --> 00:46:10,564
But I promise you, Belinda...

558
00:46:10,632 --> 00:46:13,999
we will go over there first thing
tomorrow morning and I will talk...

559
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:17,061
Mrs. LaHaye, may I speak to you
outside, please?

560
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,131
Go to bed.

561
00:46:28,316 --> 00:46:31,752
Why did you stop me? I was going to tell her
that we'll go get her brother out of there.

562
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,755
That's why I stopped you.
I didn't want to get her hopes up.

563
00:46:34,823 --> 00:46:37,758
So you think that I won't do what I said?

564
00:46:37,826 --> 00:46:40,761
No. I know you'll try to do
exactly what you said.

565
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:44,390
But when Mr. And Mrs. Pettis took Jacob,
they got legal guardianship.

566
00:46:44,466 --> 00:46:47,663
And unless we can prove that he's being
seriously hurt, no court will interfere.

567
00:46:47,736 --> 00:46:50,933
- So you're not going to do anything?
- I'll check the situation out.

568
00:46:51,006 --> 00:46:53,236
But I gotta be careful how I handle this.

569
00:46:53,308 --> 00:46:57,745
- I don't wanna make Hank so mad
that he takes it out on Jacob.
- Well, I'm going with you.

570
00:46:57,812 --> 00:47:00,212
- No, you're not.
- You can't stop me.

Just wanna see the boy, Hank.

- [Missie] We know you've been mistreating him.
- You watch your mouth!

Let us see the boy, and we'll leave.

Come on out here, boy.

581
00:48:06,714 --> 00:48:09,410
You just stay right here.

582
00:48:09,484 --> 00:48:12,453
Jacob, I'm Sheriff Tyler,
and this is Mrs. LaHaye.

583
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,283
Lindy's foster mama?

584
00:48:14,355 --> 00:48:18,758
Yes. Your sister's very worried
about you, Jacob.

585
00:48:18,827 --> 00:48:21,955
She believes that Mr. And Mrs. Pettis
aren't feeding you enough...

586
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,827
and that they're working you too hard.

587
00:48:23,898 --> 00:48:26,264
Is that true, Jacob?

588
00:48:28,903 --> 00:48:33,101
- Don't be afraid of him.
We won't let him hurt you.
- Has he laid a hand on you?

589
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:38,145
Are they feeding you enough?

590
00:48:38,213 --> 00:48:41,671
You said you were going to bring him to church.
Why haven't you done that?

591
00:48:41,749 --> 00:48:45,708
That's enough.
You got your answers, Sheriff. Now git.

592
00:48:48,723 --> 00:48:51,487
Hyah!

593
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:53,550
Hyah!

594
00:48:53,628 --> 00:48:58,429
- I wanted to ask them why they
aren't sending Jacob to school.
- No law says they have to.

595
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,866
- But...
- Even parents, let alone guardians...

596
00:49:00,935 --> 00:49:03,870
don't have to send their kids to school.

597
00:49:03,938 --> 00:49:05,872
That's just wrong.

598
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,205
Jacob needs an education if he's
going to have any kind of future.

599
00:49:09,277 --> 00:49:11,142
Unless we can persuade Pettis of that...

600
00:49:11,212 --> 00:49:13,203
Jacob's future's on that farm.

601
00:49:16,784 --> 00:49:20,584
You don't understand how desperately
Belinda and Jacob love each other...

602
00:49:20,655 --> 00:49:24,147
what it means to be separated
from someone you love that deeply.

603
00:49:24,225 --> 00:49:27,194
I don't think you've ever felt that way
about anyone in your life...

Sheriff Tyler and I talked to Mr. Pettis,
but Jacob’s gonna have to stay there for now.

609
00:49:50,685 --> 00:49:55,122
Our papa's gonna come for us, and he's gonna
get Jacob away from that terrible man!

both of us home with him!

00:50:18,146 --> 00:50:20,580
Will you open your book to page 13?

616
00:50:20,648 --> 00:50:22,639
I would like for you to read aloud.

617
00:50:30,692 --> 00:50:34,753
"The T... Tales...

618
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:37,161
"Of Pete...

619
00:50:37,232 --> 00:50:42,169
Peter Ra... Ra... '

620
00:50:42,237 --> 00:50:44,398
Rabbit.

621
00:50:44,472 --> 00:50:46,406
You're doing very well. Go on.

622
00:50:46,474 --> 00:50:49,238
- I can't read it.
- You could try.

623
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:50,902
I don't want to!

624
00:50:52,347 --> 00:50:54,281
All right, class.
That's enough for today.

625
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:57,284
We will pick up tomorrow
where we left off.

626
00:50:57,352 --> 00:50:59,513
You're excused.

627
00:51:06,127 --> 00:51:09,824
She doesn't want to be part of a family.

628
00:51:09,897 --> 00:51:13,628
She really resents me.
Maybe even hates me.

629
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:17,159
You and I didn't take
to each other at first. Remember?

630
00:51:17,238 --> 00:51:21,174
- And I am so ashamed about how I resented you.
- It's perfectly natural.

631
00:51:21,242 --> 00:51:25,702
You'd lost your mama and didn't want me to
take her place. Just like with your papa and me.

632
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,214
I'd lost my husband
and didn't want Clark to take his place.

633
00:51:28,283 --> 00:51:30,547
But then you fell in love with Papa
and things changed.

634
00:51:30,618 --> 00:51:33,348
I fell in love with both of you.

635
00:51:35,957 --> 00:51:38,892
Belinda has so much anger in her.

636
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,360
She's had it much harder than I did.

637
00:51:41,429 --> 00:51:44,159
Which is exactly why she needs you.

638
00:51:44,232 --> 00:51:47,793
Even if she's not ready to admit it right now,
she needs what you have to give.

639
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:52,568
But I have so little to give. I can barely keep
enough food on the table for Maddy and me.

640
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,200
Those other parents
that adopted those children...

641
00:51:55,276 --> 00:51:57,210
they have so much to offer.

642
00:51:57,278 --> 00:52:00,213
You will leave Belinda
a legacy of character...

643
00:52:00,281 --> 00:52:02,977
and of a love for others, and of faith.

644
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:06,316
That's a beautiful legacy.

645
00:52:06,387 --> 00:52:08,753
That's the kind of legacy that lasts.

646
00:52:13,394 --> 00:52:16,329
Well, we've gone through
all the books at school...

647
00:52:16,397 --> 00:52:18,524
and all the books here...

648
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:22,831
and you can't seem to find anything
that you're interested in.

649
00:52:22,904 --> 00:52:26,271
There must be something
that you want to be able to read.

650
00:52:26,341 --> 00:52:28,332
Well...

651
00:52:32,447 --> 00:52:35,780
when my pa dropped me and Jacob
off at the orphanage...

652
00:52:37,118 --> 00:52:39,279
he pinned this letter to my dress.

653
00:52:39,354 --> 00:52:43,552
- I was supposed to give it to 'em, but I kept it.
- Why?

654
00:52:43,624 --> 00:52:47,219
These are his last words to us.
They're important.

655
00:52:48,996 --> 00:52:52,363
I just know it's gonna say how much
he loved us and wanted to keep us...

656
00:52:52,433 --> 00:52:54,867
and how he'll come back for us someday.

657
00:52:56,304 --> 00:53:00,001
- Will you read it to me?
- Oh...

658
00:53:00,074 --> 00:53:02,474
Belinda, this letter is private.

659
00:53:02,543 --> 00:53:05,068
It's between you children
and your papa.

660
00:53:05,146 --> 00:53:07,546
I can teach you how to read it.

661
00:53:07,615 --> 00:53:10,049
Okay, I'll learn how to read.

662
00:53:10,118 --> 00:53:12,746
But will you just read it to me now?

663
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:15,448
All right.

664
00:53:16,991 --> 00:53:19,755
"To Whom It May Concern...

665
00:53:19,827 --> 00:53:23,456

Uh, your father put his mark.

677
00:53:55,663 --> 00:53:57,688
Is that all?

678
00:53:58,866 --> 00:54:01,198
I'm so sorry, Belinda.

679
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:05,638
I know it must have been very difficult
for your father to give up you and Jacob.

680
00:54:13,514 --> 00:54:16,142
Last one to the swimmin' hole's
a rotten egg!

Thank you.

684
00:54:40,775 --> 00:54:42,709
Mrs. LaHaye, what's wrong?

685
00:54:42,777 --> 00:54:46,213
I lost my locket.
The chain must have broken.

686
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,215
- Is it valuable?
- Yes.

687
00:54:49,283 --> 00:54:54,186
I'm sorry. My mother gave it to me
a long time ago, and it is very dear to me.

688
00:54:54,255 --> 00:54:56,223
Let me help you look for it.

689
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:58,053
Thank you.

690
00:55:05,867 --> 00:55:07,994
It's starting to get dark out here.

We can look again tomorrow.

692
00:55:10,938 --> 00:55:13,304
There's no point.

693
00:55:13,374 --> 00:55:15,365

I, um... I got some...

A peddler came through town
the other day, and I got this for you.

I know it won't replace the one your mother
gave you, but maybe it might make you feel better.

Zach, this looks like real gold.

715
00:57:19,467 --> 00:57:22,769
Well, if it isn't, I got taken.

716

There's enough room for two pictures...
Maddy's and Belinda's.

I can't accept this.

- It's just a gift. It doesn't mean anything.
- That's just it.

719
00:57:32,879 --> 00:57:38,511
I could only accept an expensive gift
like this if it did mean something...

00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:42,313
if it came from a man that I love.

I just never wanted to feel this way again.

727
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:22,617
It was so much easier
when I didn't feel anything.

728
00:58:24,297 --> 00:58:27,357
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem
like God put us on this Earth...

00:58:27,433 --> 00:58:29,697
to have it easy.

730
00:58:29,769 --> 00:58:32,704
But he did put us here
to love one another.

I'm so ashamed of myself.

732
00:58:41,581 --> 00:58:45,881
I have two children at home to think of,
and I'm acting like a child myself.

733
00:58:45,952 --> 00:58:47,943
You're not acting like a child.

734
00:58:49,622 --> 00:58:51,954
You're acting like a woman in love.

735
00:58:52,024 --> 00:58:54,117
I have to get home to the children.

736

- If there's anything your father
and I can do to help...
- Thank you, Mama.

00:59:00,533 --> 00:59:02,467
Thank you.

738
00:59:19,552 --> 00:59:21,486
Mrs. LaHaye?

739
00:59:23,222 --> 00:59:26,055
There's somethin' l...
I need to tell you.

740
00:59:28,227 --> 00:59:31,594
You asked me a while back
why I care so much about Belinda.

741
00:59:33,232 --> 00:59:35,166
See, she reminds me of someone.

742
00:59:35,234 --> 00:59:37,202
Someone you loved?

743
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:40,967
Eleanor. Ellie.

744
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,701
We grew up together.

745
00:59:42,775 --> 00:59:45,767
Her daddy was the town drunk.

746
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:48,177
And when he wasn't passed out...

747
00:59:48,247 --> 00:59:50,477
he was just full of meanness...

748
00:59:50,549 --> 00:59:52,540
and he took it out on her.

749
00:59:52,618 --> 00:59:54,279
Nobody did anything?

750
00:59:54,353 --> 00:59:56,344
No.

751
00:59:56,422 --> 01:00:00,552
Then when I finally got big enough,
l... I stood up to him.

752
01:00:00,626 --> 01:00:05,393
- What happened?
- Well, let's just say he didn't hit her again.

753
01:00:07,366 --> 01:00:09,357
Did you marry Ellie?

754
01:00:10,836 --> 01:00:12,861
I was going to.

755
01:00:14,273 --> 01:00:17,174
- What happened?
- Bank robbery.

756
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,171
She wasn't a threat in any way.

757
01:00:24,884 --> 01:00:26,875
They didn't have to kill her.

758
01:00:28,054 --> 01:00:31,023
But they did, and...
and they got away with it.

759
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:34,690
They're alive, and...

760
01:00:37,496 --> 01:00:39,430
Ellie's dead.

761
01:00:42,034 --> 01:00:44,264
Just no rhyme or reason to it.

762
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:49,234
Zach, I'm so sorry.

763
01:00:52,378 --> 01:00:55,711
I understand your bitterness
toward God.

764
01:01:00,486 --> 01:01:02,681
I felt the same way once.

765
01:01:02,755 --> 01:01:07,419
My husband, Willie, was the sheriff
in the town that we lived in.

766
01:01:09,328 --> 01:01:11,421
He was killed in the line of duty.

767
01:01:11,497 --> 01:01:14,022
How did it happen?

768
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,591
It was stupid really.

769
01:01:16,669 --> 01:01:21,629
- [Man] Darlin'!!
- Couple of men in a saloon got into a fight.

770
01:01:21,707 --> 01:01:25,199
Willie went in to break it up.

771
01:01:25,277 --> 01:01:29,145
Should have ended with nothing worse
than a black eye or two and a broken nose...

772
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,342
but...

773
01:01:31,417 --> 01:01:34,284
one of the men pulled out a gun.

774
01:01:34,353 --> 01:01:36,821
[Gunshot]

775
01:01:36,889 --> 01:01:40,484
He was dead by the time I got there.

776
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,221
I didn't even have a chance
to say good-bye.

777
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,990
I'm so sorry, Missie.

778
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,891
You must have loved him very much.

779
01:01:49,969 --> 01:01:52,870
With all of my heart and soul.

780
01:01:57,476 --> 01:02:00,411
[Whinnies]

781
01:02:02,214 --> 01:02:04,648
We're just about done.

782
01:02:04,717 --> 01:02:07,880
Sure goes fast
when you're not doing it alone.

783
01:02:07,953 --> 01:02:10,421
Grandma! Mama! Come quick!

784
01:02:10,489 --> 01:02:13,390
One of the puppies won't wake up!

785
01:02:32,411 --> 01:02:36,006
Aw. Poor little thing.

786
01:02:40,186 --> 01:02:43,849
- Can I hold him for a minute?
- Yeah.

787
01:02:43,923 --> 01:02:45,857
[Whining]

788
01:03:10,616 --> 01:03:13,551
[Whimpers]

789
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:19,652
You're all right now. You're all right.

790
01:03:22,061 --> 01:03:26,225
Belinda! How did you do that?

791
01:03:29,301 --> 01:03:31,235
[Barking]

792
01:03:32,404 --> 01:03:34,531
Belinda?

793
01:03:37,343 --> 01:03:39,243
[Sobbing]

794
01:03:51,357 --> 01:03:54,849
Belinda? Oh, Belinda.

795
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:01,288
You just did an amazing thing.
What's the matter?

796
01:04:03,302 --> 01:04:06,135
Mama didn't only have Jacob and me.

797
01:04:07,206 --> 01:04:09,936
There was a baby girl.

798
01:04:10,009 --> 01:04:11,943
Jenny.

799
01:04:12,945 --> 01:04:14,879
I'm so sorry, honey.

800
01:04:14,947 --> 01:04:18,110
[Sniffles]
I tried to take care of baby Jenny...

801
01:04:18,184 --> 01:04:21,347
and to keep her warm
and to get her milk...

802
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:24,480
e-even though we didn't
have much money.

803
01:04:24,557 --> 01:04:28,186
How old were you, Belinda?

804
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:31,058
Eight.

805
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:35,396
That is far too big a responsibility
for a little girl.

806
01:04:36,702 --> 01:04:39,569
There wasn't anyone else to do it.

807
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:43,131
What happened to Jenny?

808
01:04:44,743 --> 01:04:46,734
She got sick...

809
01:04:49,081 --> 01:04:51,481
and we couldn't afford a doctor.

810
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:55,384
So one day she just...

811
01:04:55,454 --> 01:04:58,321
stopped breathing, and...

812
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:03,054
and I tried to do
what Mama told me to do...

813
01:05:03,128 --> 01:05:05,119
like with the puppy...

814
01:05:06,131 --> 01:05:08,122
but it didn't work.

815
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:12,526
It's all my fault Jenny died!

816
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,932
Belinda, listen to me. Sometimes
things happen... terrible things.

817
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,308
And there is nothing
that we can do about it.

818
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:22,973
You don't understand.

819
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:26,711
- Yes, I do.
- How can you?

820
01:05:26,785 --> 01:05:29,015
Because I lost a baby too.

821
01:05:32,258 --> 01:05:34,658
Her name was Kathy.

822
01:05:34,727 --> 01:05:37,628
She was so very precious to me.

823
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:40,822
What happened to her?

824
01:05:40,899 --> 01:05:42,890
She just stopped breathing.

825
01:05:44,403 --> 01:05:46,394
I don't know why.

826
01:05:46,472 --> 01:05:51,239
One minute she was in her cradle asleep,
and then the next she...

827
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:54,711
- It wasn't your fault.
- I felt like it was.

828
01:05:56,215 --> 01:05:59,309
I felt like there must have been
some way that I could save her...

829
01:05:59,385 --> 01:06:01,580
just like you thought
that you could save Jenny.

830
01:06:01,654 --> 01:06:03,747
But we couldn't.

831
01:06:03,822 --> 01:06:05,756
It was out of our hands.

832
01:06:08,294 --> 01:06:10,285
It was in God's hands.

833
01:06:14,466 --> 01:06:16,457
I couldn't save Jenny...

834
01:06:17,569 --> 01:06:20,060
and you couldn't save Kathy.

835
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:23,097
But we can save Jacob.

836
01:06:23,175 --> 01:06:26,110
I'm going to bring
you and Maddy home now.

837
01:06:26,178 --> 01:06:30,842
- Then what?
- Then I am going to get Jacob.

838
01:06:34,053 --> 01:06:36,544
- [Boy Shouting]
- [Horse Whinnying]

839
01:06:37,623 --> 01:06:39,250
Sheriff!

840
01:06:40,693 --> 01:06:42,684
What is it? Is somethin' wrong?

841
01:06:42,761 --> 01:06:47,198
I think Mrs. LaHaye may be in trouble,
and it's all my fault. I made her go out there.

842
01:06:47,266 --> 01:06:50,895
- Go where?
- To get Jacob! But she's all alone,
and that man is so mean.

843
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:53,369
- I'm afraid he might hurt her.
- You go on home, Belinda.

844
01:06:53,439 --> 01:06:55,703
- B-But, Sheriff...
- I'll take care of this.

845
01:06:55,774 --> 01:06:58,140
But I can't worry about you, too,
so go on home and stay there.

846
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:00,041
If anything happens to Mrs. LaHaye...

847
01:07:00,112 --> 01:07:03,377
Nothing's gonna happen to her.
I won't let it.

848
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:08,984
All right.
What is it this time, Mrs. LaHaye?

849
01:07:09,054 --> 01:07:12,046
- Where's Jacob?
- None of your damn business, that's where.

850
01:07:12,124 --> 01:07:15,252
Let him come with me.
He needs to be with his sister.

851
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,454
Surely you can see that, Mr. Pettis.

852
01:07:17,529 --> 01:07:19,429
All I know is I got a good hand.

853
01:07:19,498 --> 01:07:21,432
You can hire someone.

854
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,333
A grown man could do much more work
than that little boy can.

855
01:07:24,403 --> 01:07:26,997
Men don't work for nothin'.
That boy does.

856
01:07:27,072 --> 01:07:29,836
Search your heart, Mr. Pettis.

857
01:07:29,908 --> 01:07:34,106
I know that somewhere deep inside,
you must feel something for him.

858
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:37,444
Well, now, that's where you're wrong,
Mrs. LaHaye.

859
01:07:37,516 --> 01:07:41,008
[Sighs]
You are a cruel and selfish man...

860
01:07:41,086 --> 01:07:44,419
and I am not going to let Jacob
spend one more day in your power!

861
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:47,721
And just what do you think
you can do about it? Huh?

862
01:07:47,793 --> 01:07:49,852
You come on to my land,
threatening me.

863
01:07:49,928 --> 01:07:52,123
I'm within my rights
to do whatever I want to you!

864
01:07:52,197 --> 01:07:54,791
- Even the law can't say otherwise.
- Let go of me!

865
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:58,132
- Let her go, Hank!
- Nobody tells me what to do on my own land!

866
01:07:58,203 --> 01:08:00,535
You let her go.

[Horse Whinnies]

868
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:07,773
You can't arrest me for defending myself
on my own property!

869
01:08:07,846 --> 01:08:11,213
If we weren't on your property,
you'd be heading to jail right now.

870
01:08:11,283 --> 01:08:14,309
Either way, you shoot anyone here
or anywhere else, I will arrest you.

871
01:08:14,386 --> 01:08:17,219
We'll let the courts decide
whether it's right or wrong.

872
01:08:17,289 --> 01:08:19,621
- Mrs. LaHaye, come on.
- But what about Jacob?

873
01:08:19,691 --> 01:08:22,683
- Can't do anything about him right now.

[Missie]
Whoa. Whoa.

875
01:08:33,806 --> 01:08:37,333
He shot at you.
Why didn't you arrest him?

876
01:08:37,409 --> 01:08:39,400
Well, that was just a warning shot.

877
01:08:39,478 --> 01:08:41,742
He wanted to hit me,
he would have hit me.

878
01:08:41,814 --> 01:08:43,839
You were trespassing on his land, Missie.

879
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:46,908
By law, you should have
been the one arrested.

880
01:08:46,985 --> 01:08:49,453
Where's Jacob?

881
01:08:49,521 --> 01:08:52,854
I'm sorry, Belinda,
but we couldn't get him away.

882
01:08:52,925 --> 01:08:55,393
Why not?

883
01:08:55,461 --> 01:08:57,986
We don't have the legal right.

884
01:08:58,063 --> 01:09:01,055
- What about Jacob’s rights?
- Look, I am not giving up.

885
01:09:01,133 --> 01:09:03,363
I promise you
that I will get Jacob back.

886
01:09:16,114 --> 01:09:18,048
Whoa.

887
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:21,449
- Hey, Mama.
- Where's Belinda?

888
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,819
She came in, grabbed her stuff
and left through the back door.

889
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:27,757
Oh, no. Stay here.

890
01:09:33,265 --> 01:09:35,199

891
01:09:35,267 --> 01:09:37,201
Belinda?

892
01:09:51,216 --> 01:09:54,947
She's gone. She took all of her things,
and she's not coming back this time.

893
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,250
Well, she won't leave without Jacob.

- I'll go to the Pettis place.
- I'm coming.

01:09:59,691 --> 01:10:01,921
No. Go home and wait for her.

896
01:10:25,183 --> 01:10:28,084
If my husband sees you,
he'll run you off again.

897
01:10:28,153 --> 01:10:30,144
I think Belinda might've come for Jacob.

898
01:10:30,222 --> 01:10:32,782
You're wrong.
He's in the barn, feeding the cow.

All right, everybody.
Let's gather round.

I have no idea where these kids might be
going, so we'll go in different directions.

905
01:11:02,921 --> 01:11:04,946
I'll go north. Clark, you go east.

Anderson, you go south.
Missie, you go west.

907

church in case the kids seek refuge there.

Let's everybody meet back here
by sundown.

- Let's go by Anderson Pass.
- That's it.

01:11:15,033 --> 01:11:18,002
Taking the county road? All right.

Let's go, boys.

No one found them?
We have to go back out.

- No.
- But they can't stay out there.

Not in the dark, alone in the storm!

Zach's right, Missie. It's too dark to look
for 'em now. We have to wait until dawn.

922
01:12:28,973 --> 01:12:32,272
Belinda's a smart, tough little girl.
She'll find shelter for her and Jacob.

What if there is no shelter where they are?
What if there's a wash?

They don't know it's not safe
because of flash floods.

Maddy needs you. Stay with him.

927
01:12:43,554 --> 01:12:46,955
We'll talk to more parishioners, arrange
for a search party to go out in the morning.

928
01:12:47,024 --> 01:12:50,084
We'll stay with you tonight, Missie.

929
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,151
I'll stay with you.

930
01:12:53,731 --> 01:12:56,063
I'm so scared, Papa.

931
01:12:58,836 --> 01:13:01,304
All right. Let's go, boys.

932
01:13:01,372 --> 01:13:03,806
- All right, Clancy. You ready?
- Right behind you.

933
01:13:03,874 --> 01:13:05,774
Let's go.

934
01:13:05,843 --> 01:13:08,403
[Men Chattering]

935
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:10,413
Okay. Hyah!

936
01:13:22,326 --> 01:13:24,624
Jacob! Up there. Come on!

937
01:13:24,695 --> 01:13:26,629
[Screams]

938
01:13:36,907 --> 01:13:39,705
- [Crying]
- [Coughs]

939
01:13:39,777 --> 01:13:41,768
It's okay, Jacob. It's all right.

940
01:13:41,845 --> 01:13:44,143
We're just gonna stay here
till the rain stops.

941
01:13:44,214 --> 01:13:46,444
What'll we do then?
Where do we go?

942
01:13:47,685 --> 01:13:50,176
Don't worry, okay? I've got a plan.

943
01:14:01,932 --> 01:14:04,799
Belinda! Jacob!

944
01:14:10,941 --> 01:14:13,569
Belinda!

945
01:14:13,644 --> 01:14:15,578
Jacob!

946
01:14:31,629 --> 01:14:33,654
Let's pray.

947
01:14:33,731 --> 01:14:37,531
Dear Lord, please give those little children
the strength and the courage...

948
01:14:37,601 --> 01:14:39,831
to make it through this dark night.

949
01:14:39,903 --> 01:14:43,395
And give us the faith
to accept your will.

950
01:14:43,474 --> 01:14:45,465
- Amen.
- Amen.

951
01:14:52,116 --> 01:14:54,744
I don't know
if you can hear me or not, God.

952
01:14:54,818 --> 01:14:57,309
I'm not sure I even believe in you.

953
01:14:57,388 --> 01:15:00,619
But I know I can't find
those children without you.

954
01:15:02,092 --> 01:15:04,083
Hear my prayer, Lord.

955
01:15:06,697 --> 01:15:08,631
[Quiet Crying]

956
01:15:14,138 --> 01:15:16,606
[Jacob]
I'm so cold.

957
01:15:25,115 --> 01:15:28,642
Jacob? Belinda!

958
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:31,347
[Belinda]
Over here! We're over here!

959
01:15:32,823 --> 01:15:35,018
Keep talking, Belinda.

960
01:15:35,092 --> 01:15:37,083
I'll follow your voice.

961
01:15:37,161 --> 01:15:39,254
Over here! We're over here!

962
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:45,294
- [Jacob] Sheriff Tyler?
- Yes.

963
01:15:52,409 --> 01:15:54,741
You're safe now.
I'm gonna get you back.

964
01:15:54,812 --> 01:15:57,576
- Back to Mr. Pettis?
- No, son.

965
01:15:57,648 --> 01:15:59,946
Home, to Missie's.

966
01:16:45,095 --> 01:16:47,086
Why don't you come inside?

967
01:16:48,565 --> 01:16:51,227
Zach...

968
01:16:51,301 --> 01:16:56,034
there are no words that can begin to describe
the depth of my gratitude.

969
01:16:56,106 --> 01:16:58,074
None are necessary, Missie.

970
01:17:00,277 --> 01:17:04,213
So, what happens now?
Does Jacob have to go back to Pettis?

971
01:17:04,281 --> 01:17:07,114
No. No, we talked on the ride back...

972
01:17:07,184 --> 01:17:11,678
and he admitted to me that Hank's been
beating him and practically starving him.

973
01:17:11,755 --> 01:17:15,919
I'm gonna tell Hank, if he doesn't voluntarily
give up his legal guardianship of him...

974
01:17:15,993 --> 01:17:17,984
I'll arrest him.

975
01:17:19,463 --> 01:17:23,695
I don't think that Belinda and Jacob
should be separated again.

976
01:17:23,767 --> 01:17:26,258
I would like for him
to come and live with us.

977
01:17:26,336 --> 01:17:29,931
I think the Children's Aid Society
will go along with that.

978
01:17:31,241 --> 01:17:34,039
I can't believe
that you found them in that storm...

979
01:17:34,111 --> 01:17:36,773
all by yourself.

980
01:17:36,847 --> 01:17:38,781
Hmm.

981
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:42,783
I wasn't alone out there, Missie.

982
01:17:42,853 --> 01:17:46,186
What do you mean?
I thought that you rode out by yourself.

983
01:17:46,256 --> 01:17:50,249
Yeah, I searched for hours,
calling them over and over again.

984
01:17:50,327 --> 01:17:53,956
It got to the point
where I felt hopeless.

985
01:17:54,031 --> 01:17:57,330
I knew I would never find them
on my own.

986
01:17:57,401 --> 01:18:00,234
So I prayed to God for help.

987
01:18:00,304 --> 01:18:03,535
Oh. Zach.

988
01:18:03,607 --> 01:18:07,703
And then I was absolutely silent,
and in that silence...

989
01:18:07,778 --> 01:18:12,340
I heard what I couldn't hear
while I was riding, calling them.

990
01:18:12,416 --> 01:18:15,078
- What?
- A child crying.

991
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:20,056
The thing is is even standing still...

992
01:18:20,123 --> 01:18:23,854
I shouldn't have heard
that little voice over the storm.

993
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:28,994
Maybe it wasn’t Jacob’s voice you heard.

994
01:18:30,634 --> 01:18:33,102
You spoke to God...

995
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:35,161
and he answered you.

996
01:18:38,942 --> 01:18:40,933
With a miracle.

997
01:18:49,052 --> 01:18:52,146
[Missie]
When did you start coming here, Pa?

998
01:18:52,222 --> 01:18:54,554
When your mama died.

999
01:18:54,625 --> 01:18:57,116
This is where I said good-bye.

1000
01:18:59,897 --> 01:19:01,888
How do you do that?

1001
01:19:03,267 --> 01:19:06,361
How do you let go
of someone you love?

1002
01:19:06,436 --> 01:19:08,927
When we love someone...

1003
01:19:09,006 --> 01:19:11,566
that love doesn't die when they do.

1004
01:19:11,642 --> 01:19:14,634
That stays in our hearts forever.

1005
01:19:14,711 --> 01:19:19,114
But we do have to say good-bye
to the life we shared with them...

1006
01:19:19,182 --> 01:19:22,345
go on with a new life...

1007
01:19:22,419 --> 01:19:24,546
a chance at happiness.

1008
01:19:24,621 --> 01:19:26,646
Willie would want me to be happy.

1009
01:19:26,723 --> 01:19:28,350
Mm-hmm.

1010
01:19:28,425 --> 01:19:31,019
I know that.

1011
01:19:31,094 --> 01:19:33,153
He'd approve of Zach.

1012
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:35,164
He's a good man.

1013
01:19:35,232 --> 01:19:37,757
[Chuckles]

1014
01:19:37,834 --> 01:19:41,133
- But it feels like a betrayal.
- It isn't.

1015
01:19:42,539 --> 01:19:45,201
And it doesn't matter
how I tell you that.

1016
01:19:45,275 --> 01:19:48,733
You're gonna have to feel it, Missie.

1017
01:19:50,113 --> 01:19:52,604
I think I'm gonna
go on back to the house.

1018
01:19:52,683 --> 01:19:55,311
[Inhales]
You want to sit here for a while?

1019
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:03,225
Mmm.

1020
01:20:07,831 --> 01:20:09,765
[Sighs]

1021
01:20:13,904 --> 01:20:16,134
I'll always love you, Willie.

1022
01:20:17,708 --> 01:20:21,269
But I am finally ready
to be happy again.

1023
01:20:28,185 --> 01:20:30,119
Good-bye, sweetheart.

1024
01:20:47,704 --> 01:20:49,968
Do you still have that locket?

1025
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,304
Why, yes. Right here.

1026
01:20:52,376 --> 01:20:55,539
If you still want to give it to me,
I'll take it.

1027
01:20:57,014 --> 01:20:59,881
But you said you couldn't accept
a gift like that.

1028
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:02,646
Unless it came
from someone that I loved.

1029
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:11,889
Will you put it on me, Zach?

1030
01:21:11,962 --> 01:21:13,589
Gladly.

1031
01:21:28,378 --> 01:21:32,439
There's something else I couldn't do
unless it was with the man I love.

1032
01:21:44,394 --> 01:21:46,885
- Yea! Whoo!
- [Cheering]

1033
01:21:50,867 --> 01:21:52,858
[Woman]
I wish you happiness!

1034
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:00,536
- [Clark] Bye, darlin'!!
- Bye-bye!

1035
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:02,601
I love you!

1036
01:22:02,679 --> 01:22:04,670
[Jacob]
Come on, you guys. Come on. Let's go.

1037
01:22:04,748 --> 01:22:06,682
Bye!

1038
01:22:10,987 --> 01:22:13,319
[Screaming]

1039
01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:16,291
- [Missie] Bye. Be good.
- Bye!

1040
01:22:16,359 --> 01:22:18,486
[Zach]
Bye-bye.

1041
01:22:18,562 --> 01:22:22,225
- [Cheering]
- Bye, Missie!
