How about you?
Is that a pat hand
you're holdin'?

448
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,060
I better take a look.

449
00:41:39,062 --> 00:41:41,397
I'll take four cards.

450
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:50,272
I'm not afraid
of you, Lou.
Two blues.

451
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,808
I guess I have to sweeten
the pot for myself.

452

Ten blues better.

453

It'll cost you just
ten more to see
what I've got.

I'm not that curious.
I'm not either.

with a loaded gun.
You might shoot someone.

my dealing, senor?

No, I got enough.
Cash me in.

So am I. I'm quittin'.
That suits me.

459
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:32,665
I should've quit
before I started.

recall the name.

matches the description?
No.

there's a new hired hand
at the Circle "M."

named Monte Marquez?

Oh, sure. He and his cousin
run the Longhorn Saloon
down the street.

All right.

I'd like you to
do me a favor, Monte.
You have only to ask.

470
00:43:08,935 --> 00:43:13,105
Uh, a friend of mine
borrowed some money
from a bank in Santa Maria.

471

I'd like to pay
some of it back

mail this from somewhere
outside Alamogordo?

473

I think
it could be done.

474
00:43:22,982 --> 00:43:26,151
But how will the banker
know who's sending it?

475
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:29,655
Just sign the letter
"Jefferson Davis."

Unless he forced you
to go with him.

It's true.

578
00:58:02,795 --> 00:58:07,032
It must be clear, even to you,
that he's not a criminal

01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:38,478
Hello, Slim.

746
01:23:42,984 --> 01:23:44,918
I'm not wearing
a gun, boy.

747
01:23:47,321 --> 01:23:50,891
<i>Mind if I ride</i>
<i>a ways with you?</i>
<i>Why?</i>

748
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:53,260
I'd like to have
a little talk with you.

749
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:56,830
Suit yourself.

750
01:24:08,959 --> 01:24:11,761
That nurse, Miss Hollister,
she's a nice girl.

751
01:24:11,828 --> 01:24:14,030
She's all right.
<i>Just all right?</i>

752
01:24:14,098 --> 01:24:16,066
Keep her out of this!

753
01:24:16,133 --> 01:24:19,135
That'll be hard to do now.

754
01:24:19,203 --> 01:24:22,905
I figure you're too busy
a man to waste time
riding with me.

755
01:24:22,973 --> 01:24:25,108
I have plenty of time
for you.

756
01:24:25,176 --> 01:24:27,944
That's a mighty fine thing
you did for that
Mexican family.

757
01:24:28,011 --> 01:24:30,480
No more than any
other man would do.
Not any man.

758
01:24:30,548 --> 01:24:35,385
Especially a man
who's running away from the law,
Mr. Ross McEwen.

759
01:24:39,356 --> 01:24:41,691
But your stopping
proved one thing--

760
01:24:41,758 --> 01:24:45,195
you've got backbone
from your neck way down
to the seat of your pants.

761
01:24:45,262 --> 01:24:47,230
Listen. Get this straight.

762
01:24:47,298 --> 01:24:50,233
I paid back some of the money
I stole and I'm gonna
pay the rest of it.

763
01:24:50,301 --> 01:24:53,436
I don't plan to spend
the next ten years of my life
rottin' in a cell.

764
01:24:53,504 --> 01:24:55,705
Don't blame ya.

765
01:25:02,913 --> 01:25:06,316
What are you gonna
do about it?
That's up to you.

766
01:25:06,383 --> 01:25:08,651
Listen, Garrett--
Ever been in Tularosa?

767
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:12,188
What's Tularosa
got to do with it?
We're headin' that way.

768
01:25:12,256 --> 01:25:16,058
If I was to ride in with ya
and put you on a train, nobody
would think a thing about it.

769
01:25:16,127 --> 01:25:19,462
Just Pat Garrett
waving good-bye to a friend.

770
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:22,098
You'd be free.
Don't tell me
the law's gettin' soft.

771
01:25:22,166 --> 01:25:24,234
But on the other hand,

772
01:25:24,301 --> 01:25:29,005
if I was to tell a judge
and jury that you're
paying back the money,

773
01:25:29,072 --> 01:25:32,142
that you stopped to help
a sick family,

774
01:25:32,209 --> 01:25:35,278
but you gave yourself up
voluntarily,

775
01:25:37,181 --> 01:25:41,451
well, I'm inclined
to believe that a judge and
jury might be very lenient.

776
01:25:43,287 --> 01:25:46,256
Garrett, there's
someone I have to see
at Inscription Rock.

777
01:25:46,323 --> 01:25:49,392
Go ahead.
What's holdin' you?

778
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:54,797
I'll meet you at Anderson's.

779
01:26:26,197 --> 01:26:28,932
Amigo,
I got the provisions.

780
01:26:42,446 --> 01:26:44,714
I guess I've been blind.

781
01:26:46,483 --> 01:26:51,020
No, I realized I might...
never see you again.

782
01:26:51,088 --> 01:26:55,491
When Monte told me he was
going to meet you here,
I had to come.

783
01:26:56,594 --> 01:26:59,095
It'll be easier
now that you're here.

784
01:27:00,397 --> 01:27:02,364
I'm giving myself up.

785
01:27:04,902 --> 01:27:06,869
Garrett?

786
01:27:06,937 --> 01:27:09,606
<i>[ Ross ]</i>
<i>He's waiting for me now.</i>

787
01:27:12,743 --> 01:27:14,777
It's funny.

788
01:27:14,845 --> 01:27:19,181
On the way here, I made up
my mind to go with you...
if you wanted me.

789
01:27:21,551 --> 01:27:26,222
Fay, it means we won't
be together for a while,

790
01:27:26,289 --> 01:27:30,326
but... if we can forget
what's happened,
I think it's worth it.

791
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:15,021
Everything
all right, boy?
Yeah, Pat.

792
01:28:18,892 --> 01:28:24,230
Miss Hollister,
I would not push my smallest
upon this large world.

793
01:28:24,298 --> 01:28:28,668
I did not tell you this before,
but one of these who pass here,

794
01:28:28,735 --> 01:28:31,771
not of the first,
not of the very great,

795
01:28:31,838 --> 01:28:35,775
but one who was also brave,
he was of mine.

796
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:39,279
My very great, great papa.

797
01:28:39,346 --> 01:28:44,484
<i>I hear this</i>
<i>by the firelight</i>
<i>when I was small.</i>

798
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:49,389
<i>And this Ross McEwen,</i>
<i>he pass by here</i>
<i>and do good things.</i>

799
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:53,292
His name too
belong on <i>El Moro.</i>

800
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,562
Un caballero valiente,

801
01:28:55,629 --> 01:28:58,230
Ross McEwen.

802
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:02,735
<i>"Paso por aquí."</i>

803
01:29:02,803 --> 01:29:05,538
<i>Passed this way.</i>

804
01:29:08,492 --> 01:29:10,426
Ross McEwen.

805
01:29:12,195 --> 01:29:14,731
Valiant gentleman.

806
01:29:16,932 --> 01:29:20,432
