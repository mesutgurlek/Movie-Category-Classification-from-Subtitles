00:00:00,521 --> 00:00:03,128
So here's what you missed
<i>on</i> Glee: <i>A gun went off</i>

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:04,781
<i>at school and everyone</i>
<i>was terrified,</i>

3
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:07,034
<i>and Sue said it was hers</i>
<i>and had to leave McKinley,</i>

4
00:00:07,052 --> 00:00:11,379
I'm ready to take my punishment. <i>But
secretly she's just protecting Becky.</i>

5
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:13,097
Emma, stop. Stop.
<i>Finn kissed Emma</i>

6
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:15,066
<i>and then apologized to Will,</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

7
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:17,394
<i>But Will never really forgave</i>
<i>him so Finn went off to college</i>

8
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:19,370
<i>to fulfill his dream</i>
<i>of becoming a teacher.</i>

9
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:21,405
Broadwayworld.com is saying
<i>Funny Girl</i> is finally

10
00:00:21,407 --> 00:00:23,374
happening this season.
<i>And Rachel got an audition</i>

11
00:00:23,376 --> 00:00:26,044
<i>to play Fanny Brice in a</i>
<i>Broadway revival of</i> Funny Girl,

12
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:27,578
<i>to fulfill her dream of playing</i>
<i>Fanny Brice</i>

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,364
<i>in a Broadway production</i>
<i>of</i> Funny Girl.

14
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:31,633
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

15
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:34,380
FINN: <i>The truth is, I decided to
go to the Army after high school</i>

16
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:37,466
<i>because I was kind of</i>
<i>afraid of college.</i>

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,601
<i>Smart people go to college,</i>
<i>like doctors.</i>

18
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:42,888
<i>The whole thing just seemed</i>
<i>scarier than getting shot.</i>

19
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:44,807
<i>But now that I'm here</i>
<i>at</i> the <i>University of Lima,</i>

<i>I wish I would've come sooner.</i>

21
00:00:46,726 --> 00:00:49,395
<i>I'm studying to be a teacher,</i>
<i>something I love,</i>

RACHEL: <i>Some dreams are bigger</i>

<i>Me being on Broadway,</i>
<i>that's a big dream.</i>

<i>Me being on Broadway</i>
<i>in</i> Funny Girl <i>as Fanny Brice,</i>

69
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:23,705
<i>inheriting the mantle</i>
<i>of my idol,</i>

70
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,275
<i>Ms. Barbra Streisand,</i>
<i>that's the culmination</i>

71
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:29,578
<i>of every dream I've ever had.</i>

72
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:31,997
<i>Since its premiere in 1964,</i>
Funny Girl <i>has never</i>

73
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:33,665
<i>been revived on Broadway...</i>
<i>no doubt because</i>

74
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:35,634
<i>producers haven't been able</i>
<i>to find</i>

75
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:38,303
<i>an actress capable of filling</i>
<i>Barbra's formidable shoes.</i>

76
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:41,306
<i>Luckily, I've been grooming</i>
<i>myself for this audition</i>

77
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:43,642
<i>since I was five,</i>
<i>which is when I first</i>

78
00:02:43,676 --> 00:02:47,246
<i>saw</i> Funny Girl <i>in all</i>
<i>its Technicolor glory.</i>

79
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,314
<i>I heard my dads use the phrase</i>
<i>"star quality" before,</i>

80
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:53,318
<i>but I never truly understood it</i>
<i>until that moment.</i>

81
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:56,071
<i>I knew: I needed to be her.</i>

82
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:59,324
<i>From that point on, it's been</i>
<i>all Barbra, all the time.</i>

83
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:01,994
<i>Witness my collection:</i>
<i>A feather from</i> Hello, Dolly!;

84
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:04,496
<i>A yarmulke from</i> Yentl; <i>a boxing</i>
<i>glove from</i> The Main Event;

<i>And her paramour</i>

<i>of two years, Canadian</i>
<i>Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.</i>

<i>But I'm not just approaching</i>
<i>this audition as a fangirl.</i>

90
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:19,711
<i>I'm approaching this</i>
<i>as a professional</i>

91
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:21,547
<i>who has sworn off men</i>

92
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,132
<i>and rededicated herself</i>
<i>to the art of being Barbra.</i>

93
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,134
<i>Yes, it's a long shot.</i>

94
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:29,054
<i>Fanny Brice is the King Lear</i>
<i>of musical theatre roles,</i>

95
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:31,607
<i>and I'm just an unknown</i>
<i>Jewish girl from Ohio,</i>

96
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:33,942
<i>who came of the age</i>
<i>in a high school glee club.</i>

97
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:35,527
<i>But then I remind myself,</i>

98
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,563
<i>Barbra, too, was once</i>
<i>an unknown Jewish girl</i>

99
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:39,114
<i>who sang</i>
<i>in her high school choir.</i>

100
00:03:39,148 --> 00:03:41,199
<i>And</i> Funny Girl <i>made her a star.</i>

101
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,702
<i>So why can't my dreams</i>
<i>come true, too?</i>

102
00:03:43,736 --> 00:03:46,154
Hello, gorgeous.

103
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:48,624
ROZ: Excuse my jet lag,
I'm fresh off a plane

104
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:50,709
from North Korea
where I've been training

105
00:03:50,743 --> 00:03:53,045
their swim team with
my assistant Dennis Rodman.

106
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,796
Do you like the new addition
to my wardrobe?

107
00:03:54,831 --> 00:03:56,632
That's right. I've taken over
the Cheerios!

108
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,383
From that Phantom Menace
Sue Sylvester.

109
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:00,302
Someone with talent had to.

110
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:01,670
Did I also mention
that I'm in talks

111
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:03,505
with Miss Oprah Winfrey

112
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:06,174
to launch my very own
Cheerio! Network?

113
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,560
Like George Jefferson,
I'm movin' on up.

114
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:10,896
How is your delicate group
of weirdos? Are they still

115
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,714
rattled by that fake
school shooting?

116
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:14,733
That was a terrifying experience
for those kids.

117
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:17,069
And the adults.
I'm still having nightmares.

118
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:18,987
Honey, please.
I'm a child of the ghetto.

119
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:22,024
I can't sleep at night unless
I hear at least two gunshots.

120
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:24,743
Hey.

121
00:04:24,777 --> 00:04:26,745
You get a chance
to talk to Finn yet?

122
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,498
No. I'm not ready.
Will, come on.

123
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:31,066
You need to patch the hole
in this fence

124
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:32,668
so the squirrels don't escape.

125
00:04:32,702 --> 00:04:34,920
People grow apart, Shannon.
That's life.

126
00:04:34,954 --> 00:04:36,922
Th-There's nothing wrong
with that.

127
00:04:36,956 --> 00:04:39,291
That's what I thought about me
and my sister, Denise.

128
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:42,210
We used to scrap like grizzlies
in the Arctic,

129
00:04:42,244 --> 00:04:43,462
and then when all that stuff

130
00:04:43,513 --> 00:04:44,963
went down with Cooter,

131
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:46,431
she helped me out,

132
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:48,133
and we finally got to talkin'.

133
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:49,935
I'm more stubborn
than anybody here...

134
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:52,137
(chuckles) but I swallowed hard

135
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:53,605
and made amends with her.

136
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,893
It was one of the best things
I've ever done in my life.

137
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:01,763
Make the effort, Will.

138
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:08,403
It's worth it.

139
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:12,874
(school bell ringing)

140
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:15,877
MARLEY: <i>I, Marley Rose,</i>
<i>have made a decision.</i>

141
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:18,213
<i>I took that false bottom</i>
<i>out of my desk drawer,</i>

142
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:20,799
<i>and I'm finally going to let</i>
<i>my songs see the light of day.</i>

143
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,884
<i>I want to be like all those</i>
<i>singer-songwriters.</i>

144
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,555
<i>I look up to: Joni Mitchell,</i>
<i>Norah Jones, Chrissie Hynde.</i>

145
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:28,507
<i>I've been trying</i>
<i>to bring it up with everyone,</i>

146
00:05:28,558 --> 00:05:30,392
<i>but ever since the gun</i>
<i>went off in school,</i>

147
00:05:30,426 --> 00:05:31,810
<i>everyone's been acting strange.</i>

148
00:05:31,844 --> 00:05:33,478
<i>It's like they've all got PTSD.</i>

149
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:35,647
BRITTANY: They really want me
to study string theory,

150
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:37,315
but I'm not all that interested
in arts and crafts.

151
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,317
<i>Brittany's acting weird</i>
<i>because M.I.T. found out</i>

152
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:40,802
<i>about her S.A.T. score,</i>
<i>and they're pressuring her</i>

153
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,320
<i>for early commitment.</i>

154
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:44,690
Isn't M.I.T in Europe?
That would suck.

155
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:46,742
Hey, Tina. Are you
trying out a new look?

156
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:48,910
It's called steampunk.
It's the next big thing.

157
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:51,113
Oh. God, I love it.

158
00:05:51,147 --> 00:05:52,864
(Australian accent): Oh, hey there.
You must, uh, be Marley.

159
00:05:52,915 --> 00:05:55,000
Hi, Sam. That's not Sam.
That's Sam's

160
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:56,585
smarter twin brother, Evan.
Evan Evans.

161
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:57,836
What a pleasure to meet you.

162
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,454
Oh. Phone's ringing.
Oh, it's my brother.

163
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:03,175
Oh, hey, Sam, I was actually
just looking for you...

164
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,510
So have you guys heard
who's taking over the Cheerios!?

165
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:07,763
Yeah, it's insane.
And it made me realize

166
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:10,382
I have no idea whether I'm
on the Cheerios! Or not.

167
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,601
Like, literally can't remember.

168
00:06:12,635 --> 00:06:13,835
Hey, guys.

169
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:15,303
Have you seen Evan?
You just missed him.

170
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:16,054
He went that way.

171
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:17,806
(groans)

172
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,442
<i>I think Sam might have</i>
<i>a little separation anxiety,</i>

173
00:06:20,476 --> 00:06:23,111
<i>so he's pretending</i>
<i>he has a twin. And then...</i>

174
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:25,814
<i>there's Unique.</i>
Unique, what are you doing?

175
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:28,533
Are those birth control pills?
Shh!

176
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:31,453
Don't blow a girl's cover. Kitty hooked
me up with a prescription for Loestrin,

177
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:33,288
and I heard that two dolls
a day will turn my Bs

178
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:34,790
into Ds in no time.

179
00:06:34,824 --> 00:06:37,292
Guys, have you...
seen my twin?

180
00:06:37,326 --> 00:06:38,994
Oh! Getting a call.
Hold on.

181
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:42,664
Oh, hey. Man, I was
just looking for you!

182
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:44,966
Unique, you cannot
take birth control.

183
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,868
Why not? Trans kids
everywhere are doing it.

184
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,136
All right, bro. Well,
I'll tell 'em you said hi.

185
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:49,638
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Have fun at the zoo.

186
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:51,890
<i>I've just got to build up</i>
<i>the courage to tell everyone</i>

187
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:54,976

188
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:56,678
<i>It would be a dream come true.</i>

189
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:58,897
WILL: Big news, guys.
I just got a direct tweet

190
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:00,398
from the Greater Midwest
Regional.

191
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:02,484
High School Show Choir
Board of Directors.

192
00:07:02,518 --> 00:07:03,902
(light cheering)

193
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:05,904
The theme
for this year's regionals

194
00:07:05,938 --> 00:07:07,989
is...
Sweaters.

195
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:08,824
...dreams.

196
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:10,075
(sighs) Close.

197
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:11,910
As you know,
some of the past judges

198
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:13,361
we've had haven't been
that bright,

199
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:14,279
or that sober,

200
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,747
so our best bet is to take

201
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:17,415
the dream theme literally.

202
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,201
We'll start out
with "Dream Weaver"

203
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:20,485
and then we'll segue
into "Sweet Dreams"

204
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,837
and we'll bring it home

205
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:23,421
with "You Make
My Dreams Come True."

206
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:24,790
Okay.

207
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:26,591
Marley, you're frowning.

208
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:28,960
No. I just don't know
any of those songs.

209
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:30,095
Well, you'll know them
soon enough

210
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:31,596
because we're learning them
today.

211
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:32,848
(clears throat) Maybe...

212
00:07:32,882 --> 00:07:35,016
could we try
some original songs,

213
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:36,601
like you did two years ago?

214
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,053
Yeah, my twin brother Sam
told me you guys

215
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:39,638
totally crushed
regionals two years ago

216
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:40,722
with those sweet tunes.

217
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:42,390
Well, S... um, Evan,

218
00:07:42,424 --> 00:07:44,693
that was a different time
and a different team.

219
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:47,863
Mr. Shue, could we at least talk
about the set list?

220
00:07:47,897 --> 00:07:49,698
I mean, when Finn was here,
we got to help...

221
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:51,399
Do I have to remind you guys
how lucky we are

222
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:52,701
to even be at regionals?

223
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:54,202
We're there on a technicality,

224
00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:55,570
which means there's absolutely

225
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:58,123
no room for even
the smallest of mistakes.

226
00:07:58,157 --> 00:08:00,292
Trust me.

227
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:01,626
Anybody else have something
they want to say?

228
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:04,412
Great. Brad, warm 'em up.

229
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,283
(school bell ringing)
As honorary Rachel,

230
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:11,001
I would like to convene

231
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:12,419
this secret meeting
of the glee club.

232
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:13,954
Oh. Sam's sorry
he couldn't make it.

233
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:15,322
He said
to tell every... Oh.

234
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,174
Just got a text.

235
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:19,009
He's here.

236
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:20,261
Oh, hey, Sam.
Hey, Evan.

237
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:22,496
How long are we gonna
let him do this?

238
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:24,131
Just let it go.

239
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:25,933
It's like waking a sleepwalker.
It might kill him.

240
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:27,685
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm
late. What'd I miss?

241
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:29,470
What you missed
was Mr. Shue's set list.

242
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:30,804
It's gonna lose us regionals.

243
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:32,606
Oh, yeah, Evan was saying
something about that.

244
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:36,110
"Dream Weaver." Great song,
but it's from 1975.

245
00:08:36,144 --> 00:08:37,861
"Sweet Dreams (Are Made
of This)." Amazing.

246
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:39,363
Released in 1982.

247
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:40,847
"You Make My Dreams Come True."

248
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:42,316
Originally performed in 1981,

249
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,734
and then performed again
by the glee club in a mash-up

250
00:08:43,785 --> 00:08:45,569
that we did last year,

251
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,870
which Mr. Shue
didn't even remember.

252
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:48,289
He's completely lost touch.

253
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:49,957
We're screwed.
Can I get a witness?

254
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:51,158
We need to do current songs,

255
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:53,360
and if we do,
I know we can win.

256
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:54,962
(clears throat) Uh, guys...

257
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:56,547
can I say something?

258
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:58,882
I wrote some songs.
What if we performed those?

259
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:02,052
Please. No one wants to hear a
song about a fat mom. Okay.

260
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:04,004
What about...
Or a song about barfing.

261
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:06,390
But what about a song... Or a
song about loving an octoroon.

262
00:09:06,424 --> 00:09:08,676
BLAINE: All right, all
right, all right, let's...

263
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,978
let's get serious.
We need to start brainstorming.

264
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:13,213
We'll pick a new set list
and then we'll break the news

265
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:15,733
(bell ringing)
to Mr. Shue.

266
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:19,386
(Wagner's "Ride
of the Valkyries" playing)

267
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:25,442
(students chanting):
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

268
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:26,827
(neck cracks)

269
00:09:26,861 --> 00:09:29,730

00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:33,834
(Puck shouts)

272
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:35,402
(cheering, whooping)

273
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,421
(sizzling)

274
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:39,423
Excuse me, ladies.
Where are your tickets?

275
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:40,791
Wait, we need tickets?

276
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:42,009
Rules are rules.

277
00:09:42,043 --> 00:09:43,844
Wait, wait, wait.

278
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:45,546
You both seem
like really nice girls,

279
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,014
and I don't want you
to miss out on all the fun...

280
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:51,268
...so I'm willing to make
an exception just this once.

281
00:09:51,303 --> 00:09:53,253
Oh, my God,
you're such a sweetheart.

282
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:55,939
I am. Mm. Thing is,

283
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:58,442
if I let you go for free
and anybody hears about that,

284
00:09:58,476 --> 00:10:00,110
the whole system
could collapse.

285
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:02,696
So I'm gonna need you
to pay me with your bikini tops.

286
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:04,565
Okay.
Okay.

288

I hope you're finding time
to make it to class.

00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:52,830
Look, I-I came here
to apologize.

307
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:54,948
I was still stinging from
what happened at the wedding

308
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:57,334
and then when you told me
about... kissing Emma,

309
00:10:57,369 --> 00:10:59,953
I totally mishandled
the situation.

310
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:02,840
And now I really see that we only
have so many days, you know?

311
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:05,008
I want you to come back and
help me coach the glee club.

312
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:07,294
They need you.
I need you.

313
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:10,297
PUCK: Finn! I just got us invited
to the Delta Kappa Chi frat party

314
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:12,966
tonight. It's supposed to be the
biggest party of the year. Yeah!

315
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,101
Yeah!
(chuckles)

316
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:15,853
I got to shave my hello giggles.

317
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:17,438
Good to see you, Mr. Shue.
Yeah.

318
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:18,522
Thanks, Puck.

319
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:20,691
Thanks, but no, thanks.

320
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:23,944
I'm not expecting things to just
go back to normal right away.

321
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:25,279
I'm willing to work at this.

322
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:26,864
Well, I'm not.

323
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:28,615
There's just some things
you can't come back from.

324
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,850
It's a nice offer,

325
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:31,568
but as you can see,

326
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:34,204
I'm pretty busy with college.

327
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:35,739

(school bell ringing) All right,
guys, let's get right into it.

336
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:51,505
And remember,
the trick is the change

337
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:52,806
in vocal quality
from the smooth,

338
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:54,892
sultry sounds of Gary Wright

339
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:56,260
to the commanding
tone of Annie Lennox,

340
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:58,262
and then back to the poppy fun
of Darryl Hall.

341
00:11:58,313 --> 00:11:59,480
Uh, Mr. Shue?

342
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:00,898
Um, we kind of got
together as a group

343
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:02,716
after you gave us
these songs yesterday, and

344
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:05,068
we came up with
some... alternatives.

345
00:12:06,438 --> 00:12:08,439
Why would you do that?

346
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:13,911
Mm, you might need some woman
parts to help you sell that.

347
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:15,195
I'll go get Evan.

348
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:17,247
Sam, sit down.

349
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:18,665
Honestly, I don't even know

350
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,867
what's going on
in this room anymore.

351
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,201
What happened to you guys?

352
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:22,286
Openly defying me?

353
00:12:22,337 --> 00:12:23,704
Unique, you need
to tone it down

354
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:25,038
with the whole boob thing.

355
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:27,341
Sam, we all know you
don't have a twin brother,

356
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,709
and frankly, it's distracting.

357
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:30,544
And, Blaine, I am
disappointed in you

358
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:32,212
for allowing this to go on.

359
00:12:32,246 --> 00:12:34,431
I'm sorry,
but we're just trying to...

360
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:36,600
No, what you were trying
to do is not rehearsing

361
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:38,936
the song list that I gave you,
and that is unacceptable.

362
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,221
So here's what's
going to happen.

363
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:43,223
I'm going to go
to the teachers' lounge

364
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:46,944
and get the coffee that I
skipped to get here early,

365
00:12:46,978 --> 00:12:48,862
and when I get back
in five minutes,

366
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:51,431
you <i>will</i> be ready
to rehearse... my songs.

367
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:07,447
Okay, so let's start
with the <i>Funny Girl</i> classics.

368
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:08,632
I know them by heart.

369
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,467
But anyway, I just
want to go over...

370
00:13:10,502 --> 00:13:13,119
I always seem to find you
the piano, rehearsing.

371
00:13:13,137 --> 00:13:15,138
Shelby.

372
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:17,457
Oh, my God,
what are you doing here?!

373
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:19,309
I'm trying to track you down.

374
00:13:19,344 --> 00:13:21,595
I wanted to find you before
your <i>Funny Girl</i> audition.

375
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:23,564
You found out about that?
We're Facebook

376
00:13:23,631 --> 00:13:25,632
friends, Rachel. You
started posting as Barbra.

377
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,767
I noticed.
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

378
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:28,185
I just felt... a little weird.

379
00:13:28,236 --> 00:13:30,320
You know, I know
that you have the same affection

380
00:13:30,355 --> 00:13:33,156
with <i>Funny Girl</i> as I do, and I just...
You didn't want to remind me

381
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:35,809
that I never got to play the
role, and now it's too late?

382
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:37,661
I love my life. I do.

383
00:13:37,695 --> 00:13:40,414
It's not the life that I
always imagined I'd be living,

384
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:42,115
but I have Beth, and I have

385
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:43,500
this new Broadway
Daycare business,

386
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:46,119
and we're both in
the same city now,

387
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:48,789
so I get to see you a lot more.

388
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:50,657
I have no regrets.

389
00:13:50,675 --> 00:13:54,711
In fact, as much as it was
my dream to maybe study

390
00:13:54,762 --> 00:13:57,047
at a school like NYADA, and, um,

391
00:13:57,098 --> 00:13:59,182
perform songs like that

392
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:01,184
on a Broadway stage... Shelby.

393
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:05,022
...my bigger, better
dream now is to see my

394
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:06,974
incredibly beautiful daughter
perform those songs.

395
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:11,011
Just... not at
your audition.

396
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:12,696
Honey, you can't do Barbra.
What?!

397
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,566
No. Fanny Brice is
the most iconic role.

398
00:14:15,617 --> 00:14:17,651
Okay, this is...
this is the only way to do it.

399
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:20,320
Yeah, Hamlet's an iconic role,
and it's been done differently

400
00:14:20,354 --> 00:14:22,656
and successfully by Laurence
Olivier, Kenneth Branagh,

401
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,042
Richard Burton, Keanu Reeves...

402
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:27,544
Okay, Hamlet is different.
This is Fanny.

403
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:29,580
Yes, and they cast Barbra
as Fanny

404
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,747
because she was one-of-a-kind.

405
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:31,798
She was an original.

406
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,417
If the producers are smart,

407
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:35,168
they're not gonna be
looking for some carbon copy.

408
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:37,004
They're gonna want a fresh
interpretation, someone

409
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:39,506
that can put their own stamp
on the role.

410
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,092
Well, I've just been learning.

411
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:44,144
Barbra's entire
repertoire, so...

412
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:45,729
It's okay. You have time.

413
00:14:45,763 --> 00:14:47,230
We'll find something.
I'll help you.

414
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:49,483
This may not be 100% right,

415
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:52,769
but maybe it will inspire you.

416
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,355
And any excuse

417
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:57,407
to sing next to you.

Dude, that was awesome!

489
00:19:27,277 --> 00:19:29,578
Dudes. Dudes, I'm Matt Cromley,

490
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:30,996
house president.

491
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,248
This is Chip.
He's in charge of pledging.

492
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:35,450
You guys want us to
pledge or something?

493
00:19:35,502 --> 00:19:37,419
Under normal circumstances,
we'd ask you to pledge.

494
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:40,205
Then you'd have to go through
a six-week hazing program.

495
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:43,425
But dudes, this is
our biggest party of the year,

496
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:45,961
and when the stereo broke,
we all thought it was ruined.

497
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:48,046
CHIP: You saved our
house and its honor

498
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,299
and its position
as top party house on campus.

499
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,185
Well, Puck and I... we do
have musical training.

500
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:55,053
Glee club?
That's awesome.

501
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:57,389
So, listen, even though
you guys are apparently gay,

502
00:19:57,423 --> 00:19:59,441
we'd like to invite you
to become brothers here.

503
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:02,110
No hazing or anything.
Just say yes, and you're in.

504
00:20:02,145 --> 00:20:04,146
Yeah.

505
00:20:04,197 --> 00:20:06,114
The sacred ritual of partying!

506
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:07,316
Oh! Yeah!
Yeah!

507
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:08,951
(groaning and laughing)

508
00:20:08,985 --> 00:20:10,619
Man.
Whoa...

509
00:20:10,653 --> 00:20:11,787

(school bell ringing)

512
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:17,793
I'm also naturally
enhancing my breasts.

513
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:19,494
Every night, I rub
them with cocoa butter,

514
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:21,830
Vitamin E and wild yams.

515
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:23,999
Yes, uh, has anybody,
uh, seen Sam?

516
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,084
Yeah, I think
he's behind that curtain.

517
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,475
Sorry I'm late.

518
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,010
What's up, Marley? Brad?

519
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:38,096
Uh, I wrote a song.

520
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,398
I don't know if it's any good.

521
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:41,099
I just... I want
to hear it out loud.

522
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,651
And no,

523
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:46,438
or bad Taylor Swift
boyfriend drama.

524
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:47,940
It's about

525
00:20:47,974 --> 00:20:50,325
how much
friends like you mean to me.

526
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,326
Lord, I am crying already.

527
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:53,111
(soft laughter)

528
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:55,831
I just saw how upset you guys
got after Mr. Shue yelled at us,

529
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:58,333
and you three seemed
to take the worst part of it.

530
00:20:58,368 --> 00:21:00,035
So, I wrote this song
to make you

531
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:03,288
feel better,
as corny as that sounds.

532
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:04,506
Will you sing it with me?

533
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,842
No. Just kidding.

534
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:08,844
Of course we would.
Hit it, dude.

Child, it's the soundtrack
to my life.

Do you have any more
songs like these?

598
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,724
Yeah, a couple.

599
00:24:09,776 --> 00:24:12,060
Maybe we can meet up
again and sing them.

600
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:14,112
No. Forget that. No, what we
need to do is tell everyone.

601
00:24:14,147 --> 00:24:16,398
We have to tell Mr. Shue about this.
MARLEY: No.

602
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:19,184
He made it pretty clear
he's not interested.

606
00:24:44,488 --> 00:24:46,238
You're probably still pissed
about Brody,

607
00:24:46,272 --> 00:24:48,140
so I'll start by saying
that I'm sorry

608
00:24:48,175 --> 00:24:49,675
and that my hand still hurts.

609
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,210
His face has sharp edges.

610
00:24:51,244 --> 00:24:53,829
Okay, I'm-I'm not...
I'm not mad, I...

611
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,415
Actually, I think I owe
you a debt of gratitude.

612
00:24:56,449 --> 00:24:58,084
Just, um...

613
00:24:58,118 --> 00:25:00,803
you know, I wish that you
would've stayed and...

614
00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:03,723
hung around a little longer.

615
00:25:03,757 --> 00:25:06,759
Next time, I promise.

616
00:25:06,793 --> 00:25:09,061
So, how is college?

617
00:25:09,096 --> 00:25:11,097
It's a dream come true.

618
00:25:11,131 --> 00:25:12,315
Parties with Puck...

619
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:14,233
Puck? Puck is there?

620
00:25:14,267 --> 00:25:15,484
Yeah, he's here.

621
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,652
Long story, but...

622
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:17,653
it's amazing.

623
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:18,821
Every night, we go out,

624
00:25:18,855 --> 00:25:19,989
we-we're meeting new people...

625
00:25:20,023 --> 00:25:21,157
Well, then, that sounds amazing.

626
00:25:21,191 --> 00:25:22,658
I'm... it's really great.

627
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:24,694
I, uh, actually I just,

628
00:25:24,745 --> 00:25:26,028
I needed to, um,

629
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,080
to ask you something.

630
00:25:28,115 --> 00:25:30,700
Let me guess:
<i>Funny Girl</i> auditions.

631
00:25:32,152 --> 00:25:34,503
I knew you'd remember.

632
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:36,339
Finn, I can't believe
that this moment is happening,

633
00:25:36,373 --> 00:25:38,507
and I know that
this is a long shot,

634
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:42,044
but I need to find
the most perfect song to sing,

635
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:43,662
and-and-and no Barbra.

636
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:48,467
You're one of the most
unique talents in the world.

637
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:49,935
You always shine your brightest

638
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,887
when you do something
personal, something

639
00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:54,023
intimately important
that defines you.

640
00:25:54,057 --> 00:25:56,058
So just do something
that takes you back

641
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:57,693
to the roots of your passion.

642
00:25:57,728 --> 00:25:59,862
That's what people want to see,

643
00:25:59,896 --> 00:26:02,281
and that's what makes
the best impression.

644
00:26:02,315 --> 00:26:05,034
Make those producers
fall in love with you

645
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:06,952
in that moment on the stage.

646
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:10,039
And I know you have it in you.

647
00:26:10,073 --> 00:26:11,540
(sighs)

648
00:26:11,575 --> 00:26:13,209
Wow.

649
00:26:13,243 --> 00:26:14,493
Thank you, that was, uh...

650
00:26:14,527 --> 00:26:17,380
perfect advice.

651
00:26:17,414 --> 00:26:19,715
You'll be great.

652
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,918
Can't wait to come
to a show sometime.

653
00:26:22,969 --> 00:26:24,970
Call me as soon
as it's over, okay?

654
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:27,807
I will.

655
00:26:33,764 --> 00:26:35,765
(soprano singing aria)

656
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:48,277
Thank you for... that.

657
00:26:48,328 --> 00:26:50,413
(chuckles)
We will let you know.

658
00:26:50,447 --> 00:26:52,748
Thanks.
This is what you get

659
00:26:52,783 --> 00:26:54,784
for holding an open cattle call
for <i>Funny Girl.</i>

660
00:26:54,835 --> 00:26:56,619
Let me just put a little
"yikes" next to her name.

661
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,087
Told you we should
have made an offer

662
00:26:58,121 --> 00:26:59,171
to Miley Cyrus.
All right.

663
00:26:59,206 --> 00:27:01,290
Let's just plow ahead, shall we?

664
00:27:01,341 --> 00:27:02,958
Rachel Berry,

665
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:04,710
hit the stage, you're up.

666
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:13,686
(clears throat softly)

667
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:16,472
Um... hi.

668
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:19,024
I'm Rachel Berry, and I'll be
singing a classic.

WOMAN:
Well,

714
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:54,430
thank you, Ms.... Berry.

715
00:29:54,464 --> 00:29:55,764
That was something...

716
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:58,267
quite different.

717
00:29:58,301 --> 00:29:59,435
Sorry.

718
00:29:59,469 --> 00:30:00,803
What?
Rachel.

719
00:30:00,854 --> 00:30:02,104
Suddenly, something
happened to you

720
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:03,439
in the middle of the song.

721
00:30:03,473 --> 00:30:05,107
What was going on there?

722
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:07,893
I was thinking
about my friends.

723
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:10,646
Um, how I wouldn't be
the person I am today,

724
00:30:10,697 --> 00:30:12,031
standing in front of you,

725
00:30:12,065 --> 00:30:13,616
doing what I'm doing

726
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,735
right now if they hadn't
shown me that I could.

727
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:19,655
If they hadn't believed in me.

728
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:22,825
Thank you.

729
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:33,798
(grunts)

730
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,166
(sniffs) Dude...

731
00:30:35,184 --> 00:30:37,001
Dude, yourself.

732
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:39,170
What the hell is this?

733
00:30:39,188 --> 00:30:41,222
(grunts)

734
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,558
Uh, it's from my sociology prof.

735
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:45,360
Guess I missed another test.
No biggie.

736
00:30:45,394 --> 00:30:47,145
Crap, what time is it?

737
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,346
I'm late to play Frolf
with that Cromley guy.

738
00:30:48,364 --> 00:30:51,366
Dude, it is a biggie.
It's a very biggie.

739
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,401
Isn't that class one of your
requirements for your teaching major?

740
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:55,036
Don't worry,
I'm gonna pass that class.

741
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,538
The... the final's worth,
like, 60% of the grade.

742
00:30:56,572 --> 00:30:57,739
I'll just cram and ace it.

743
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,790
Is that your dream?

744
00:30:58,824 --> 00:30:59,857
To barely skate through school

745
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:01,526
and become a mediocre teacher?

746
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,878
Wait, since when do you care
about school so much, man?

747
00:31:03,913 --> 00:31:05,213
You're not even in school.
Dude.

748
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:06,697
This isn't high school anymore.

749
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:08,049
It's not just about potential.

750
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,034
This is the real casaba.

751
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:11,085
So you're a crappy
high school student.

752
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:12,220
Who cares?

753
00:31:12,254 --> 00:31:13,471
But if you're a crappy teacher,

754
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:14,756
that means something.

755
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:16,507
(sighs)

756
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,092
Look.

757
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:19,344
This has been awesome.

758
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,045
I'm having the time of my life.

759
00:31:21,063 --> 00:31:22,597
And doing it with my best bud

760
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,215
is a dream come true.

761
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:26,050
But last night, I was
in bed with three chicks,

762
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:27,402
and I was thinking,
"What is this all about

763
00:31:27,436 --> 00:31:28,553
for you, Puckerman?"

764
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,889
So, what'd you come up with?

765
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,440
I want to show all of 'em.

766
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:35,276
Everyone who ever
crossed the street

767
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,411
when I came down the sidewalk

768
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:38,229
or didn't call on me in class

769
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:39,664
'cause they just assumed
I'd fart my answer,

770
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:41,950
or told me I'd be
pumping gas someday

771
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:44,235
that we are worth something.

772
00:31:44,253 --> 00:31:46,788
That we are more
than they say we are.

773
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,289
(sighs)

774
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,425
I'm not saying we
need to stop having

775
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:52,377
a good time,
but partying this hard,

776
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,078
skipping out on tests,

777
00:31:54,096 --> 00:31:56,247
that's their vision
of who we are.

778
00:31:56,265 --> 00:31:57,915
Doesn't have to be ours.

779
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:00,602
So what are you gonna do,
like, enroll here now?

780
00:32:00,636 --> 00:32:02,103
I still think school's
for suckers,

781
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:03,805
but I'm gonna stay here
and write my screenplay

782
00:32:03,856 --> 00:32:05,089
and be on your ass

783
00:32:05,107 --> 00:32:07,141
24-7 to make sure
that you become

784
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:08,943
the best teacher
that you can be.

785
00:32:08,978 --> 00:32:10,594
We've always known
we were special.

786
00:32:10,613 --> 00:32:12,864
This is our chance to prove it.

787
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:16,284
Yeah.

788
00:32:21,123 --> 00:32:23,207
(warbles) Ew.

789
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,442
(laughs) Get to work.

790
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,960
I'll grab the iron and make us

791
00:32:25,995 --> 00:32:27,745
some grilled cheeses.

792
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,780
(groans)

793
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,639
(school bell rings)

794
00:32:37,673 --> 00:32:38,973
Mm.

795
00:32:39,008 --> 00:32:40,892
You wanted to see us, Coach?
Yes.

796
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:42,644
Come on in and have a seat.

797
00:32:42,678 --> 00:32:44,395
It is my understanding

798
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,297
that I have inherited you

799
00:32:46,315 --> 00:32:49,067
as co-captains
of the Cheerios!

800
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:50,968
And by looking at the
two of you right now,

801
00:32:50,986 --> 00:32:54,072
that makes me
extremely suspicious.

802
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:55,807
Suspicious? Why?

803
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:57,308
Oh, I understand why.

804
00:32:57,326 --> 00:32:58,993
Coach Sylvester's
daughter Robin is here.

805
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:00,028
Sue Sylvester

806
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:02,330
is as old as the hills,

807
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:05,166
so when she gave birth
to her fully grown,

808
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,202
16-year-old baby with
Down syndrome, it was

809
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:09,820
a miracle, and she wanted

810
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:12,807
to bring her to school every day
and show her off.

811
00:33:12,841 --> 00:33:14,926
You're the one that makes
me suspicious,

812
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,160
Fruity Fonzie.

813
00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:17,845
You ain't never done
a cheerleading routine

814
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,497
in your life,

815
00:33:19,515 --> 00:33:21,499
but somehow you get.

816
00:33:21,517 --> 00:33:23,134
Sue Sylvester to make you

817
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,835
co-captain of the Cheerios!,

818
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:27,671
and then, three weeks later,
out of nowhere,

819
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,724
Sue Sylvester gets fired.

820
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:30,942
That makes me

821
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:32,543
real suspicious.

822
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:35,730
That makes me think
that you used your handsome

823
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:38,516
fruity voodoo powers
and put a hex on her

824
00:33:38,534 --> 00:33:41,619
that caused her to bring a gun
to school for no reason

825
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:44,539
and get real clumsy
so she drops it twice

826
00:33:44,573 --> 00:33:46,207
and it goes off both times.

827
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:47,692
That sounds like

828
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:50,661
some dark-sided, fruity
voodoo stuff to me.

829
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,380
But that didn't really happen!

830
00:33:52,414 --> 00:33:54,031
Blaine had nothing
to do with it!

831
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:55,583
How do you know?
Were you there?

832
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,034
No.

833
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:58,669
Exactly.
So here's

834
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,221
the deal... if you
want to stay

835
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:02,706
on board as co-captain
of the Cheerios!,

836
00:34:02,725 --> 00:34:06,210
you're gonna have to take
a blood oath and loyalty pledge.

837
00:34:06,228 --> 00:34:08,429
What? A blood oath?

838
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,647
Is-is that even safe?

839
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:10,715
Probably not.

840
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:11,949
So we'll just take the oath.

841
00:34:11,984 --> 00:34:13,217
Repeat after me.

842
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:16,571
I, Fruity Fonzie
and adult baby Robin...

843
00:34:16,605 --> 00:34:21,159
BOTH: I, Fruity Fonzie
and adult baby Robin...

844
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:24,395
...do solemnly swear... BOTH:.
..do solemnly swear...

845
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:29,117
...to <i>never</i> put a hex
on Coach Roz Washington.

846
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:30,901
To <i>never</i> To <i>never</i>

847
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:34,172
hex on Coach Roz Washington. To...
on Coach Roz Washington.

848
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:37,508
Causing her to bring a gun to
school so she gets real clumsy

849
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:40,578
and drops it and it goes off
twice in a row.

850
00:34:40,596 --> 00:34:42,180
BOTH: Causing her to
bring a gun to school

851
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:44,048
so she gets real clumsy
and drops it

852
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,067
so it goes off twice in a row.

853
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:47,418
So help me God.

854
00:34:47,436 --> 00:34:48,753
BOTH:
So help me God.

855
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:49,937
You are free to go.

856
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:54,475
(bell ringing)

857
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,278
Becky, wait up.

858
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:59,781
Hurry up, I'm gonna be
late for calculus.

859
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:03,401
Becky, um, you were acting
particularly strange

860
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,319
in there just now.

861
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,654
Do you know something I don't

862
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,122
about what happened
with Coach Sue?

863
00:35:08,157 --> 00:35:11,108
Mind your own gay business,
gay Blaine.

864
00:35:11,126 --> 00:35:13,411
I don't know anything!

865
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,079
(groans)

866
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,049
(groans)

867
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:35,900
(distance cheering and applause)
(sighs)

868
00:35:37,486 --> 00:35:39,854
(cheering and applause
continues)

869
00:35:44,693 --> 00:35:46,077
(cheering and applause
stops) FINN: Mr. Shue?

870
00:35:49,164 --> 00:35:50,665
You were right.

871
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:52,984
About what?

872
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,619
(chuckles)

873
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:55,986
Me.

874
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:58,656
N-Needing to get my focus back.

875
00:35:58,674 --> 00:36:02,176
So I-I talked to the Dean
of Students about your offer,

876
00:36:02,211 --> 00:36:06,214
and she said she's willing
to give me college credit

877
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:08,683
for all the time
that I spend here helping out.

878
00:36:08,717 --> 00:36:11,886
Is that your way of saying
apology accepted?

879
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:14,388
That's my way of saying
I'm willing to come back.

880
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,839
But if I do,

881
00:36:15,858 --> 00:36:19,343
things have got to be different.

882
00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:21,729
No more fetching your coffee

883
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,015
or picking up
your dry cleaning.

884
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:27,618
I mean, I don't want
to come back to be a gopher.

885
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:31,022
It's got to be a partnership.

886
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,690
I want to be treated
like an equal.

887
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:34,492
Like a...

888
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,360
like a teacher.

889
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:41,582
And then you bring your best
and I bring my best

890
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:43,551
and we go get another trophy.

891
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,721
That all seems fair.

892
00:36:46,755 --> 00:36:49,373
But I also have a condition.

893
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:51,893
Let's just move past this.

894
00:36:52,928 --> 00:36:55,713
Right.

895
00:37:05,862 --> 00:37:07,363
(bell ringing)
Looking good, Unique.

896
00:37:08,582 --> 00:37:10,950
(chuckles) You, too, Tina.

897
00:37:10,984 --> 00:37:12,201
Very Jules Verne.

898
00:37:13,153 --> 00:37:15,538
Hey, Blaine. Sam.

899
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:17,540
I'm Evan. Sam moved to Alaska.

900
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:20,960
Oh. Well-well, tell him
he's welcome back anytime.

901
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,798
(sighs)

902
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:33,055
So... just about 20 years ago,

903
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:35,391
I was sitting right
where you are now.

904
00:37:35,442 --> 00:37:37,309
I was co-captain
of the soccer team

905
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:39,145
with a forehead full of acne

906
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:42,031
and a dream of being
the next Vanilla Ice. (Chuckles)

907
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:43,566
And standing

908
00:37:43,617 --> 00:37:45,651
right here was Mrs. Adler.

909
00:37:45,685 --> 00:37:49,321
She constantly mumbled
to herself and

910
00:37:49,355 --> 00:37:51,257
she stuffed used Kleenex
up her sleeves.

911
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:54,660
We all were convinced
that she was crazy.

912
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:56,662
But you know what?

913
00:37:56,696 --> 00:37:58,664
That's why we loved her...

914
00:37:58,698 --> 00:38:00,199
because we were crazy, too.

915
00:38:01,301 --> 00:38:03,752
This is the room
that always felt like home.

916
00:38:03,804 --> 00:38:06,755
Maybe because we knew
Lillian Adler loved music

917
00:38:06,807 --> 00:38:08,841
almost as much as she loved us.

918
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,094
And that's how I feel about you.

919
00:38:12,145 --> 00:38:14,680
Every one of you.

920
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:16,849
And-and I'm sorry
if I made any of you feel

921
00:38:16,883 --> 00:38:18,851
like you don't have
a voice in this room.

922
00:38:18,885 --> 00:38:20,102
You do.

923
00:38:21,488 --> 00:38:23,439
And I know someone else
who does, too.

924
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,192
(snaps fingers) ARTIE: My man!

925
00:38:26,226 --> 00:38:28,277
(laughter, cheering)

926
00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:31,280
Finn and I are gonna be
working together as a team.

927
00:38:31,331 --> 00:38:32,865
Equal partners.

928
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:35,234
And we are not gonna
eat, sleep or breathe

929
00:38:35,252 --> 00:38:36,785
until you've blasted
through regionals

930
00:38:36,837 --> 00:38:38,704
and earned your rightful spot
at nationals.

931
00:38:38,738 --> 00:38:40,072
Yes! Yes!
(cheering and applause)

932
00:38:42,676 --> 00:38:43,792
All right, down to business.

933
00:38:43,844 --> 00:38:45,628
Marley, you're up.
Okay.

934
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,630
I haven't quite memorized
"Dream Weaver" yet,

935
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:49,765
but I think I have "Sweet
Dreams." Didn't I tell you?

936
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:51,300
Those are out.

937
00:38:51,351 --> 00:38:54,053
I want you to teach us one
of your original songs.

938
00:38:54,087 --> 00:38:56,388
If that's okay.

939
00:38:56,422 --> 00:38:58,607
I'd love that.

940
00:38:58,642 --> 00:39:01,143
So shall it be written!
So shall it be done!

941
00:39:01,194 --> 00:39:02,895
(cheering and applause)

942
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:13,239
(metallic creaking)

943
00:39:19,496 --> 00:39:23,332
So, what is Broadway
Daycare exactly?

944
00:39:23,383 --> 00:39:26,585
(sighs) All the show people who have
kids... while they're rehearsing

945
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:28,754
or performing... they send them
to Shelby's studio

946
00:39:28,788 --> 00:39:31,307
and she teaches them,
like, dance routines

947
00:39:31,341 --> 00:39:33,175
and songs and plays
theatre games with them.

948
00:39:33,226 --> 00:39:35,761
It's like <i>Fame</i> for toddlers.

949
00:39:37,564 --> 00:39:39,515
Well,

950
00:39:39,566 --> 00:39:41,600
no news is good news, right?

951
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:43,485
Cookie?

952
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,855
At this point, if I haven't
heard anything...

953
00:39:46,907 --> 00:39:49,692
Life goes on.

954
00:39:49,743 --> 00:39:51,944
You know,
Fanny was just a dream.

955
00:39:51,978 --> 00:39:54,530
I read on BroadwayWorld.com that they're
doing a production of <i>Sweeney Todd</i>

956
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:56,782
at the Pasadena Playhouse,
and... I don't know... I think.

957
00:39:56,816 --> 00:39:58,834
Johanna could be a good role for me.
Do you regret

958
00:39:58,868 --> 00:40:00,536
not doing Barbra
for the audition?

959
00:40:01,588 --> 00:40:03,589
No way.

960
00:40:03,623 --> 00:40:05,958
Honestly, something so special
and something magical

961
00:40:05,992 --> 00:40:08,294
happened in that room, and
if those producers are too...

962
00:40:08,328 --> 00:40:10,629
narrow-minded
or star-obsessed...

963
00:40:10,663 --> 00:40:12,298
(phone vibrating)

964
00:40:12,332 --> 00:40:13,832
Oh, my God.

965
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:16,602
Oh, my God, it's a number
I don't recognize.

966
00:40:16,636 --> 00:40:18,637
What do I do? What do I do?
Uh,

967
00:40:18,671 --> 00:40:20,639
ans-ans-answer it. Answer it. Yes, yes, yes.
Pick it up? Okay.

968
00:40:20,673 --> 00:40:22,641
Hello?

969
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:24,676
Uh, yes, this is she.

970
00:40:27,147 --> 00:40:30,115
Uh, yeah, of-of cour...
of course.

971
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:33,118
Yes. Yes.

972
00:40:33,153 --> 00:40:36,155
Thank you so much. Thank you.

973
00:40:39,743 --> 00:40:41,493
That was...
one of the producers.

974
00:40:41,527 --> 00:40:43,195
And?

975
00:40:44,581 --> 00:40:46,548
And I got a callback for Fanny!

976
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:48,500
(laughing) I got a callback!

977
00:40:48,534 --> 00:40:51,003
