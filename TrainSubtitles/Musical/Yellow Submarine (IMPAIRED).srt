1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,836
(Narrator) Once upon a time...

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:10,051
or maybe twice,
there was an unearthly paradise called...

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,095
Pepperland.

4
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:28,152
80,000 leagues beneath the sea it lay,

5
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:32,281
or lie, I'm not too sure.

6
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,148
(Wicked laughter)

7
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:55,239
Pepperland is a tickle of joy
on the blue belly of the universe.

8
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,244
It must be scratched.

9
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,288
Right, Max?

10
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,957
- Yes, Your Blueness.
- What?!

11
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:10,254
We Meanies
only take no for an answer.

12
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,758
Is that understood, Max?

13
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,343
No, Your Blueness.

14
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,220
That's better.

15
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,265
Are the troops in readiness?

16
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,391
No, your Blueness.

17
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,644
- The Bonkers?
- No.

18
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,312
- Clowns?
- No.

19
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,272
- Snapping Turks?
- No.

20
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,941
- Anti-music missiles?
- No.

21
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,444
- The dreadful Flying Glove?
- No.

22
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,738
Splendid!

23
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:43,037
Today, Pepperland goes bluely!

24
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,457
Fire!

25
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,542
(Loud bang)

26
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,884
(Screaming and shouting)

27
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,554
(Cannon fire)

28
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,813
(Explosions)

29
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,913
(Bass drumbeats)

30
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,128
The Meanies are coming!
The Meanies are coming!

31
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:36,424
Glove, Glove, come here, Glove!

32
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,135
Look out there,
and what do you see?

33
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,805
- Tell him, Max.
- Someone running, Glove.

34
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,602
Well, you'll soon put a stop to that,
won't you, Glovey?

35
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,980
Go, Glove, point!

36
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,108
And having pointed, pounce down!

37
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,281
(Explosions)

38
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,289
(Crashing sounds)

39
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,796
(Giggling) I haven't laughed so much
since Pompeii!

40
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,508
(Explosions)

41
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,973
(Screeching halt)

42
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,684
(Guffawing)

43
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,939
(Splash)

44
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:38,068
What?! What?!
The Glove is losing his touch.

45
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,573
Do your worst!

46
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,202
Explode them!

47
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,371
(Honk)

48
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,083
(Honk)

49
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,961
(Loud explosion)

50
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,678
(Stammering) It's not polite to point!

51
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,766
(Loud guffawing)

52
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,568
Thing of beauty...
destroy it for ever!

53
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,868
(Loud explosion)

54
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,495
(Whimpering)

55
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,420
Sir, Sir, the Blue Meanies
are coming!

56
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:44,593
Not here, Young Fred.
They wouldn't dare.

57
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,597
They would. They are.
What are you going to do?

58
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,934
Finish the quartet.

59
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,310
Fire!

60
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,524
(Loud banging)

61
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,236
Trio, sir?

62
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,701
(Fred) Duet, sir?

63
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,369
Duet?

64
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,415
Solo!

65
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:23,382
Young Fred,
the Blue Meanies are coming!

66
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,598
(Explosions)

67
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,486
(Lord Mayor)
4 scores and 32 bars ago,

68
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,990
- our forefathers...
- Our quartet?

69
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:52,202
- and foremothers...
- Another quartet?

70
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,998
made it in this yellow submarine...

71
00:06:56,124 --> 00:07:00,002
- What, that little thing?
- to Pepperland.

72
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,674
Climb aboard, Young Fred.

73
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,510
But, sir, I can't even
make my soap float.

74
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:12,181
I'm appointing you Lord Admiral.

75
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,142
Lord Admiral?
In that event, yes.

76
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,983
Hurry, Young Fred.
Go! Get help!

77
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,652
Where should I go?

78
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,907
(Lord Mayor) No time for trivialities.

79
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,501
(# THE BEATLES:
"Yellow Submarine")

80
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,609
(Brass band playing)

81
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,483
(Engine noise)

82
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,907

84
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,621
(Wind blowing)

85
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,083
(Bang)

86
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:17,671
Woe... is me.

87
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,719
Liverpool can be a lonely place
on a Saturday night.

88
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,346
And this is only Thursday morning.

89
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,516
(Thinks) Compared with my life,
Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl.

90
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,184
Nothing ever happens to me.

91
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,354
(Thinks) I feel like an old,
splintered drumstick.

92
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,734
I'd jump into the River Mersey,
but it looks like rain.

93
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,696
Nothing ever happens to me.

94
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,705
(Engine noise)

95
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:27,574
Puss, puss-puss.
Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy.

96
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,453
Here, pussy, pussy, pussy.
Here, pussy, pussy.

97
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:46,134
- (Policeman) Ahem, er...
- (Cat meows)

98
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,889
Would you believe me if I told you I was
being followed by a yellow submarine?

99
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,851
No, I would not.

100
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,104
Oh yeah, I didn't think you would.

101
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,398
(Engine noise)

102
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,320
I could have sworn
there was a yellow submarine.

103
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,322
But that isn't logical, is it?

104
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,367
It must have been one of them
unidentified flying cupcakes

105
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,369
or a figment of my imagination.

106
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,581
But I don't have an imagination.

107
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,543
(Engine noise)

108
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,387
Help, help, help!

109
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,264
(Ringo) Thanks, I don't need any.

110
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,518
Help! Won't you please,
please help me?

111
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:40,105
- (Ringo) Be specific.
- (Talking gibberish)

112
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,239
...Blue Meanies!

113
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,699
What you need is...

114
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,243
'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent,

115
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:58,498
'L' for love me
and 'P' for p-p-please help.

116
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,176
(Door slams loudly)

117

118
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,533
Hiya, baby!

119
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,842
(Screeching halt)

120
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,970
Your story has touched my heart.

121
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,805
Jump in, we'll get my friends.

122
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,433
- Bless you!
- Did I sneeze?

123
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,314
- Just park it here.
- I'll just park it here.

124
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,695
(Slamming doors and strange noises)

125
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,323
What would your friends
be doing here?

126
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,574
Displaying.

127
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,911
- Displaying what?
- Displaying around.

128
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,921
(Fred) Can't we take one of these?

129
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,131
No. I only work with my mates.

130
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,553
(Fred) Frankenstein?

131
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,388
I used to go out with his sister.

132
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,473
- His sister?
- Yeah. Phyllis.

133
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,101
Hey, I wonder what would happen
if I pulled this lever.

134
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,602
You mustn't do that.

135
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,729
Can't help it.
I'm a born lever-puller.

136
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,281
(Creaking noise)

(Booming noise)

138
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,725
Ringo, I've just had
the strangest dream.

139
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,852
(Ringo) I warned you not to eat
on an empty stomach.

140
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,854
Now listen to Old Fred.

141
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,356
(Talking gibberish)

142
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,446
...Blue Meanies!

143
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,240
(Fred) What do you think?

144
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,328
I think he needs a rehearsal.

145
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,331
(John) When do we leave?

146
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,541
(Fred) Let's get the other two, John.

147
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,003
(John) What day is it?
(Ringo) Sitarday.

148
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,796
Then George will be here.

149
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,382

(Ringo) George,
what are you doing up there?

152
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,794
- (George) Now, what is it, Ringo?
- (Engine noise)

153
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,212
(Car horn)

154
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,048
(George) Is there a matter
you'd like to take up

155
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,009
or down?

156
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,803
This chap here...

157
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,681
(Fred talking gibberish)

158
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,352
(All) ...Blue Meanies!

159
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,313
You're nuts, the pair of you.

160
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,400
Wait a minute, that's my car.

161
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,237
- (George) How do you know it's your car?
- I'd know it anywhere.

162
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,574
- (George) What's it look like, then?
- It's red with yellow wheels.

163
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,162
I mean, blue with orange wheels.

164
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,873
- (Horn sounds)
- (George) It's all in the mind.

165

(Ringo) Move over, I'm driving.
(George) I got here first.

166

(John) I'll drive, if you like.
(George) No, you sit in the middle.

167

(Ringo) I'm sitting in the middle.
(John) You said you were driving.

168

(Ringo) I am driving.
(George) I'll get in the back, then.

(Woman screaming)

173
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,516
(George) Do you think
we're interrupting something?

174
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,268
(Ringo) I think so.

175
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,146
We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?

176
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,487
It's all in the mind.

177
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,530
Try one of those doors.

(Cheering crowd)

179

Yes, they do look very nice,
don't they?

180
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,084
Yes, they do.

181
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,212
- They do, though, don't they?
- Yes, they do.

182

- Don't dey, dough?
- Dough?

183

- Don't ask.
- Dat's dough.

- (Door slams)
- Well, lads, what do you think?

186
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,016
(John) I think that...

187
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,769
Remember,
there'll be rough seas ahead.

188
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,103
So, what do you think?

189

Pounding, overwhelming waves.
What do you think of that?

191
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,402
(Paul) Well, I think that...
(John) As a matter of fact, I...

192
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,570
(All) I think...

193
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,572
(Fred) Well?
(All) I've forgotten.

194
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,200
Right, then,
let's get this vessel shipshape.

195
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,994
(Ringo) I kind of like the way it is,
submarine shape.

196
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,705
(Engine noise)

197
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,876
So, this is a submarine.

198
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,335
Soft, isn't it?

199
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,045
Not if you're on the bottom.

200
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,382
All right, lads,
time to stow the gab and turn to.

201
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,051
Groovy. How do you start this thing?

202
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,889
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.

203
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,600
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies
in the neighbourhood?

204
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:18,271
(Talking gibberish)
Then you start looking for a switch.

205

(Guitar playing)

206
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,194
Perhaps this is it.

(# THE BEATLES:

What time is it?

209
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,872
It's time for time.

210
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,291
Look, the hands are slowing down.

211
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,136
(Paul) Do you ever get the feeling...
(John) Yeah.

212
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,973
that things aren't as rosy
as they appear to be under the surface?

213

(George) What's happening, John?

214
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,977
(John) In my humble opinion,
we've become involved

215
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,856
in Einstein's time-space
continuum theory.

216
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,150
- Relatively speaking, that is.
- Of course.

217
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,320
(George) Maybe time's gone on strike.
(Paul) What for?

218
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,530
- Shorter hours.
- I don't blame it.

219
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,532
It must be very tiring being time,
mustn't it?

- It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?

221
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,537
- You surprise me, Ringo.
- Why?

222
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:26,167
- Dealing in abstracts.
- Just because I'm a drummer...

223
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:30,505
- I don't half feel funny.
- You're not half the lad you used to be.

224
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,340
Look, everything's getting bigger.

00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,801
It's not.
It's us that are getting smaller...

226
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,970
- I want my mam.
- ...and younger.

227
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,057
There you are, lads.
Old Fred will get you out of all this.

228
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,852
Look at that!

229
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:48,815
- It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
- (John) It's not. It's Father Time.

230
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,525
- How do you know?
- I read it in a book.

231
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:54,237
I don't want to alarm you,
but the years are going backwards.

What's that mean, Old Fred?

233
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,866
If we slip back through time
at this rate,

234
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,494
very soon we'll all disappear
up our own existence.

235
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,748
- What are we gonna do, then?
- We could always try a few buttons.

236

- (Tolling bell)
- I want my mam.

237
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,462
(Fred) Time's fast running out for us,
I'm afraid.

238
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,881
- Can't we do something to the clock?

see what happens.

remarkably like our own.

(John) Uncannily.

246
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,583
(Ringo) There's someone in it. Look.

247
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,627
(George) And they're waving.
(Ringo) It's a group of fellas.

248
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,255
Wave back.

249
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,258
(George) Maybe we're both part of
a vast yellow submarine fleet.

250
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,093
There's only two of us.

251
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,847
Then I would suggest that
yonder yellow submarine is ourselves

Oh dear, we're all the same.

Senile delinquents.

And I can hear my beard growing.

257
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,072

00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,727
- Too much.
- Too soon.

321
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,604
(George) Reverse! Reverse!

322
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,568
- Ringo time.
- 'L' is for love me...

323
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,533
(Muffled explosion)

324
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,744
(All) Indians!

325
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,039
(Ringo) Help! Help!

326
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,923
(Ringo) 'P' is for please...

327
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,595
So, press a button.

328
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,184
(Cavalry charge)

329
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:31,577
- How was it, Ringo?
- 'Arrowing.

330
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,415
(Sucking noise)

331
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,552
(Paul) Look who's back.
Full speed ahead.

332
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,888
- Oh, no.
- The motor's packing in.

333
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:54,892
(Fred) By all the sea nymphets,
we're losing power.

334
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,269
(George) We're being swallowed.
What shall we do?

335
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,104
(John) Serve tea.
(Paul) Lovely.

336
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,077
(Wind blowing)

337
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:22,085
By Neptune's knickerbockers,
she's puttered out.

338
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:25,505
- Maybe we should call a road service.
- Can't. No road.

339
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,050
And we're not sub-scribers.

340
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,510
(All) Subscribers...!

341
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:34,181
I know something about motors.
Let me have a look.

342
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,600
- Here.
- Is that the motor?

343
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,061
Can't you tell one
when you see one?

344
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,063
Of course I can.
Let me peruse it.

345
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,690
(Electrical buzzing)

346
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,568
- What do you think?
- I think I burned my finger.

347
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,237
Here, lads. Look at this.

348
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,448
- What do you think it is?
- Nothing.

349
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,033
Looks like nothing.

350
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,077
It's a local inhabitant.

351
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,037
(Ringo) He's probably one of the nothings.

352
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,206
(Paul) At least that's something.

353
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,208
- (Paul) Let's show him our motor.
- Steady on.

354
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,710
You don't want to show
your motor to just anybody.

355
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,087
But this is a nobody.

356
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:10,258
Medic, pedic, zed oblique,
orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek.

357
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:13,220
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.

358
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:16,223
So little time, so much to know.

359
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,849
Can you tell us where we're at?

360
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,102
A true Socratic query, that.

361
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,270
And who the Billy Shears are you?

362
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:25,857
Who? Who indeed am I?

363
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,777
Jeremy?

364
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,196
Hillary?

365
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,407
Boob?

366
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,909
- Ph.D.?
- (All) Who?

367
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,453
Eminent physicist, polyglot, classicist,

368
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,789
prize-winning botanist,
hard biting satirist,

369
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,251
- talented pianist, good dentist, too.
- (Paul) Lousy poet.

370
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,169
Critic's voice,
take your choice.

371
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:49,214
- Must be one of them angry young men.
- Or a daffy old creep.

372
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,341
I, daffy old creep?

373
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:56,513
- Do you speak English?
- Old English, middle, a dialect, pure...

374
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,850
- Well, do you speak English?
- You know, I'm not sure.

375
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:02,769
He's so smart, he doesn't even
remember what he knows.

376
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,688
Why don't we show him our motor?

377
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,773
Should we really...
show him our motor?

378
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,275
He may not have seen one before.

379
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,736
Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring.

380
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,030
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic,

381
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:16,658
this motor, I see,
has a broken down thing.

382
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,745
- He fixed it.
- He fixed it?

383
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,246
Great. Let's go.

384
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:27,669
I must complete my bust, two novels,
finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.

385
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,297
Must you always talk in rhyme?

386
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:34,760
If I spoke prose, you'd all find out,
I don't know what I talk about.

387
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,387
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.

388
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,598
So little time, so much to know.

389
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:41,850
Hey, fellas. Look.

390
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,603
The footnotes for my 19th book.

391
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,688
This is my standard procedure
for doing it.

392
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,066
And while I compose it,
I'm also reviewing it.

393
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:52,152
- A boob for all seasons.
- How can he lose?

394
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,403
Were your notices good?

395
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,489
It's my policy never to read my reviews.

396
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,158
There must be a word for what he is.

397
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,787
(# THE BEATLES:
"Nowhere Man")

398
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,360
Okay, men, all aboard.
Let's go somewhere.

399
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,278
What about him?

400
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,906
He's happy enough
going around in circles.

401
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,575
Poor little fella.

402
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,162
I don't know.
Ringo's just a sentimentalist.

403
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,249
Look at him.
Can't he come with us?

404
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,839
Mr. Boob, you can come with us,
if you like.

405
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,425
You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?

406
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,135
Come on, we'll take you somewhere.

407
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,181
Okay, Booby. Down the hatch.

408
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:12,018
Down the hatch.
A quite curious phrase.

409
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:15,313
The middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.

410
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,108
Its usage undoubtedly on the increase.

411
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,860
I must work it into
my New Statesman piece.

412
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:23,780
- That's the hatch, friend.
- Indeed.

413
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,366
Steady now, crew.
Prepare to go forward.

414
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,743
- Forward.
- Forward.

415
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,412
- Forward.
- Forward.

416
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,247
(Fred) Forward!

417
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:50,348
(John) It's awfully quiet.
What shall we do, Jeremy?

418
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:56,146
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.

419
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:17,000
- Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob.
- (George) What's he saying?

420
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,461
- (Paul) What's he doing?
- Chewing gum will do the job.

421
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,005
- A turn of the screw, and all is...
- (Propellers whirring)

422
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:23,923
...and all is new.

423
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,592
(Fred) I can't stop her.

424
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:30,180
'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent,
'L' is for love me...

425
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:32,557
(John) 'P' is for... goodbye?

426
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,935
(George) That was lovely, Jeremy.
(Paul) We've lost the sub for good.

427
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:38,146
- Or for bad.
- (Ringo) Or for worse.

428
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,317
- I'm sorry about that.
- (Ringo) But he did fix the motor.

429
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,947
(Paul) Where are we?
(John) It looks like the foothills.

430
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:51,409
(George) The foothills of what?
(John) The foothills of the headlands.

431
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,749
(Strange sounds)

432
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,092
(# THE BEATLES:
"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds")

433
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:11,609
(John) Carry on, lads, carry on.
(Ringo) Certainly was carrying on.

434
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,573
(George) I feel a draft.

435
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,825
(Paul) We must be
near the Sea of Holes.

436
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,912
Don't you think we should
ask somebody for directions?

437
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,873
Excuse us...

438
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,667
Can you tell us
the way to Pepperland?

439
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,836
(Mechanical whirring)

440
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,214
(George) Thanks.

441
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,219
(Paul) Gosh, look at all this dust!

442
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,431
(George) Where did it come from?

443
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:44,517
A chemical error and quite imprecise.
This is a condiment...

444
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,061
- Condi...
- A spice.

445
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,564
- He's right, you know. It's pepper.
- Pepper?

446
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:52,650
- Pepper.
- (Ringo and George sneeze)

447
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,612
(Deep inhaling and sneezing)

448
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,407
John?

449
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,034
Paul?

450
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,994
George?

451
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,788
Is anybody home?

452
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,165
- Where are we?
- A holey sea.

453
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,918
This place reminds me
of Blackburn, Lancashire.

454
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:53,127
Oh, boy...

455
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,755
How many do you think
there are in all?

456
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,716
Enough to fill the Albert Hall.

457
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:02,261
Didn't Old Fred mention something
about the Sea of Holes

458
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,555
- just before the Sea of Green?
- Yeah.

459
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,683
Through one of them slots
must be the Sea of Green.

460
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,893
But which? Which one?

461
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:13,564
Thesis, antithesis, synthesis,

462
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,901
causes of causal causation.

463
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:23,741
Jeremy, what do you know about holes?

464
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:27,078
There are simply no holes
in my education.

465
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:31,833
You mean you haven't composed
a whole book?

466
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,335
Great. What shall we do?

467
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,838
Be empirical. Look.

468
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,798
(Ringo) The booby's making
more and more sense.

469
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,758
It's getting better all the time.

470
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,219
Great. Come on, let's all
look for the Sea of Green.

471
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:48,975
The Sea of Holes...
into the Sea of Green.

472
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:55,732
Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine.

473
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,276
I think we're near the Sea of Green.

474
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,328
I've got a hole in my pocket.

475
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,081
Where's Jeremy?

476
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,374
He was over there.

477
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,002
- He's not here now.
- (John) He must have jumped ship, then.

478
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:19,255
He wouldn't do that.
He's our friend.

479
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:23,843
Booby, Jeremy, Hillary,
where are you?

480
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,054
(Echo) Sea of Green...

481
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:47,575
(Ringo) Pepperland.
A bit salty around the edges.

482
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,494
(John) Looks all dingy.
(George) And drab.

483
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,078
(Paul) And quiet.

484
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,249
Safe at last.

485
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,878
And none the worse for our adventures.

486
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:03,132
Reminiscent in many ways
of the late Mr. Ulysses.

487
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,638
There's an eye in the apples.

488
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,187
(Engine noise)

489
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,325
(Fred) There she blows!

490
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:37,583
Lord Mayor, sir...
I've made it, I'm back.

491
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,211
- Who's this?
- Our Lord Mayor.

492
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,839
He's been bonked.

493
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:46,551
Lord Mayor, sir...
unbonk yourself.

494
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:51,264
Even a little snatch of a tune
might get him up again.

495
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,765
All right, let's sing.

496
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:58,479
# Have you got time to rectify,
time to rectify...

497
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,274
Do I hear music?

498
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:06,487
Do I see... Young Fred?

499
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,739
You do, Lord Mayor.

500
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:14,120
Bless my metronome.

501
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:16,455
And did you bring help?

502
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:19,125
Yes, yes. Look.

503
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:22,795
Holy pizzicato, Young Fred.

504
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:27,884
It's quite uncanny, your faces...

505
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,385
We're quite cute, really.

506
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:32,388
You could pass for the originals.

507
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,307
We are the originals.

508
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:38,477
No, no... Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band.

509

(John) They couldn't be much
with a name like that.

510
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:41,981
Sergeant Pepper?

511
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:46,777
(Lord Mayor) You could impersonate them
and rally the land to rebellion.

512
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,991
Where are your instruments?

513
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:55,077
(Ringo) Lost in the Monstrous Sea.
(John) Sea of Monsters.

514
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,747
(Fred) We'll get other instruments,
Lord Mayor.

515
00:56:57,873 --> 00:56:59,665
Not a chance.

516
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:04,170
The Meanies captured everything
that maketh music.

517
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,255
They hate music that much, do they?

518
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,759
They shrink at the very sound.

519
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,846
(Drum roll)

520
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:24,607
Okay, you guys.
It's shrinking time in Pepperland.

521
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:26,817
(Drums becoming louder)

522

525

526
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:19,805
- Aim, fire!
- (Gunfire)

527
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,908

(Giggling)

531
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,687
(Paul) He reminds me
of my old English teacher.

532
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:11,398
(John) Look, if you must shout,
shout quietly.

533
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,901
(George) What do we do?
(John) Coagulate with the crowd.

534
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:17,238
Cut-outs at the ready.
Then let's cut out.

535
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,633
(Paul) What a grand bandstand.

536
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,176
(George) That's where the gear's kept.
Come on.

537
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,302
(Paul) Cavey, cavey.

538
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,888
(Barking)

539
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,704
All right, the coast is clear.

540

Now's our chance.

541

- But how'll we get over...?
- Easy. Follow me.

543
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:25,806
A-ha! You fools!

544

546
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:55,336
It's not very light in here, is it?

547
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:57,463
Shh! Keep the noise down.

548
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,716
- Look what I found.
- It's their uniforms.

549
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:03,302
- Nice bit of gear, that.
- They'll look great on, eh?

550
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,847
- Dey will, won't dey?
- Won't dey, dough.

551
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:12,311
- How do I look?
- Groovy. How about me?

552
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:15,981
- Bad scene, lads. We're surrounded.
- Oh, heck.

553
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,318
(Paul) A million billion Meanies.

554
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,989

(Paul) I hope not.

- Shh!

Look. They're all asleep.

564
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:36,854
They look cute when they're asleep.
Almost human.

565
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,231
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- On tiptoe.

566
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:47,573
- Tiptoe through the Meanies...

Not a Meanie in sight.

- Not even a teeny Meanie.
- Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie.

- Look. Breakfast.

- It must be from Kentucky.

635
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,417
(Ringo) There's something inside.

636
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:06,751
(John) Four fellas.
(George) What are they doing there?

637
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:08,586
(Paul) They're not having a ball,
that's for sure.

638
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:10,588
(Ringo) It can't be.
(George) It's us.

639
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:12,507
- But we're here.
- It's Sgt. Pepper's...

- Lonely...
- Hearts Club...

642
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:16,761
(George) The resemblance
is truly striking.

643
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,847
If I could come in here...

644
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:23,435
I think the theory put forward by Einstein
could well be applied here.

645
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:26,771
The people in the ball are obviously
extensions of our own personalities,

suspended, as it were, in time,

647
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:32,152
frozen in space, according to
the now famous Theory of Relativity,

648
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:35,572
which, briefly explained,
is simply a matter of taking two eggs...

649
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,032
- (George) John!
- ...beating lightly

650
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:38,491
and adding a little salt and pepper...

651
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,326
- (George) John!
- George?

652
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,287
- How do we get them out?
- Break the glass.

653
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:46,124
- We can't. It's Beatle-proof.
- Nothing is Beatle-proof.

654
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:49,210
Have you got your drumsticks with you?
A drum break might shatter it.

655
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:51,129
- No, I haven't.
- Have a look in your pocket.

656
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:54,507
I've got a hole in my pocket.

657
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:57,635
I wonder if...
Yeah, it still works.

658

659

(Paul) Hello, brother.

664
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:24,954
(Ringo) Yeah, without a doubt.

665
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:28,917
- We're the spitting image of each other.
- Golly, yeah.

666
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,921
I'm led to believe that you're
an extension of my personality.

667
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:36,883
- Yes, I'm the alter-ego man.
- And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob.

668
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:39,260
I'm glad you asked me that.

669
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:42,263
Because as a matter of fact
there's a war on.

670
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:45,183
Then, brothers in war,
to the skirmish must we hence.

Shall we hence?

Can it be me? I think
you'd better inquire of the guards,
