NARRATOR: And it came to pass
that there went out

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,011
a decree from Caesar Augustus

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,514
that all the world
should be taxed,

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:19,519
and all went to be taxed,
everyone, to his own city,

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,523
for to disobey the Roman emperor
meant certain death.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,027
Oh, there were young people
and old people.

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,029
There were the famous
and mighty,

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,032
and some not yet known,

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,034
but whose names would
eventually linger

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:40,039
and be revered for all time.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,541
There were good people
who could ill afford

12
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,544
the cruel tax about
to be imposed upon them,

13
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,048
and there were others.

14
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,548
And there were others.

15
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,572
Observe, Ali, the little
drummer boy Aaron.

Are those animals
dancing, Ben haramed?

NARRATOR: The little
drummer boy Aaron

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,753
fought Ben haramed and Ali
with all his might.

64
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,756
He most definitely did not want
to join the showman's caravan,

65
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,759
a journey into the crowded city,

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,762
FOR IT WAS TRUE:
Aaron hated people...

67
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,764
All people.

68
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,767
No! No! I won't go with you!

69
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,270
Stop struggling, boy!

70
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,772
There is money to be made.

71
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,275
We can be rich!

72
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,279
While those taxpayers are
waiting to be counted,

73
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,781
they will grow bored.

74
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,784
They will crave the
entertainment which only I...

75
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,787
Ben haramed, king of
the desert showmen...

76
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,291
and of course you,
too, can provide.

77
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,294
But I do not want to
go near that mob.

78
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,797
I hate people! All people!

Do you think ilovepeople?

80
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,305
What a beautiful world
it would be without people.

81
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,308
But, alas, one must
exist with people.

82
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:14,313
And indeed, it is better
to be crowded and rich...

NARRATOR: Oh, Ben haramed
was a wily old desert jackal.

109
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,406
Only he could have talked Aaron
into visiting the crowded city.

110
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:52,412
For you see, Aaron truly
did hate all people.

111
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,415
Now, it wasn't always this way,

112
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,917
for Aaron was once
a happy farm lad,

113
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,421
the son of a Shepherd.

114
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,922
Father! Mother!

115
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,923
Father! Mother!

116
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,429
And why this exceptional
greeting today, my son?

117
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,430
Oh, no reason.

118
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,432
Happy Birthday, Aaron.

119
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,934
Oh, father! Mother!

120
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,436
Did you bring me something?

121
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,438
I don't suppose...

122
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,441
This would interest you,
young man?

123
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,942
A drum!

124
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,945
My very own drum! Oh, father!

125
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,947
Try it out, Aaron!

126
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,451
NARRATOR: And perhaps because
it was a gift of love,

127
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,955
the drum had an almost
magical quality.

128
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:42,461
And the animals, when they heard
it, began to dance to its sound.

129
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,022
And the animals, when they heard
it, began to dance to its sound.

130
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,971
But Aaron's happiness
was to end all too soon,

131
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,975
for one night,
bandits of the desert attacked.

132
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,777
For one night,
bandits of the desert attacked.

133
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,483
What's going on out there?

134
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,984
Father!

135
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,487
You must run, my son. Escape!

136
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,988
But... run!

137
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,489
But... run!

138
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,492
NARRATOR: They burned the farm
and took the sheep,

139
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,997
and Aaron's happy life
had changed forever.

140
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,501
And so, Aaron roamed the land
a lonely orphan,

141
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,506
his only friends 3 of the farm
animals who had escaped.

142
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,508
He vowed to hate all humans

143
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,510
for what they had done
to his family,

144
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,012
and he kept that vow.

145
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,013
And he kept that vow.

146
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,317
BEN: Ah, Jerusalem at last.

00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,360
direct from the palace
of the emperor of China,

165
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,862
the toast of royalty,

166
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,865
mesaal and jameel,

167
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,367
tumblers extraordinary!

168
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,869
Hup! Hup!

169
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,870
Hup! Hup!

170
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,882
Wonderful, wonderful!

171
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,403
Perhaps you will show
your appreciation

172
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,385
for such a performance.

173
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,386
For such a performance.

174
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,388
Philistine!

175
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,891
And now, let's
move it right along

176
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,893
with Ali of Arabia,

177
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,896
greatest juggler
under the stars.

178
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,177
Greatest juggler
under the stars.

179
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,410
Boy, you perform next.

180
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,914
The crowd is restless.
You must appease them.

181
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,414
Are you ready?

182
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,916
I'm ready.

183
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,419
No, no. Smile. Smile!

184
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,423
See, only a smile
pleases the crowd.

185
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,425
Smile. Smile!

186
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,427
I cannot.

187
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,429
Not at... Them.

188
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,934
You stubborn little fool!
Then wear a painted one.

189
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,436
There. That's better.

190
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,938
When do I go on?

191
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,942
Now, before the dope juggles me
out of my life savings!

192
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,104
Now, before the dope juggles me
out of my life savings!

More! More!

213
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,011
You heard them! More! More!

214
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,014
Don't let them get away
before I pass the hat!

215
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,517
NARRATOR: But as Aaron looked at
the faces of the cheering mob,

216
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:03,021
a great rage rose up inside him.

217
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,523
How dare they laugh and be happy

218
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,527
after what their kind
did to his family!

219
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,529
Stop! Quiet!

220
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,532
I hate you all for what you did!

221
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,535
You're all preying
thieves and bandits

222
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,536
and knaves and...

223
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,537
and knaves and...

224
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,344
run for it!

225
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,846
NARRATOR: And so,
the troupe was chased

226
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,347
out of Jerusalem by the mob.

227
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,852
BEN: Boy, you shall pay
for this indignity.

228
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,854
Ben haramed! Look!

229
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,354
Ben haramed! Look!

230
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,358
BEN: By the hounds of heaven,
it is the caravan...

231
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,862
Of a king! We're in luck!

232
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,866
Can I believe my luck?
Two kings!

233
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,368
Hold me up! Three!

234
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,370
Three kings!

235
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,371
Three kings!

236
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,877
NARRATOR: And behold, there came
wise men from the east,

237
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,379
three kings of the orient,

238
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,382
and lo, the star which they saw

239
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,384
went before them.

240
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,385
Went before them.

241
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,403
Yes, it was the star
of Bethlehem

242
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,906
which shone so brightly

243
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:32,410
and graced the lonely darkening
desert with its silver light.

244
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,914
But the little troupe did not
see the star's beauty,

245
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,919
for the souls of Ben haramed and
Ali were too filled with greed

246
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,922
and the heart of Aaron
too overflowing with hatred

247
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,926
to take any note of
the wonder just above them.

248
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,428
Now you listen, drummer boy.

249
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,430
If you give this
one performance,

250
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,432
half the money shall be yours.

251
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,435
Then you are free.

252
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,438
NARRATOR: Aaron agreed,
only because he knew

253
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,940
that with the kings' money,

254
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,943
he would be free
to go his own way

255
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,946
and never again have to
trouble himself with humans.

256
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,949
AND SO THEY APPROACHED
THE THREE KINGS:

257
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,954
Melchior, caspar, and balthazar.

258
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,957
'Tis night. We must break camp.

259
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,461
And swiftly!
The star waits not for us.

260
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,965
Strike the tents!
Pack the camels!

261
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,287
Strike the tents!
Pack the camels!

262
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,974
No! Don't go!

263
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,976
We just got here!

264
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,477
Halt! Out of my way!

265
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,979
We must perform!

266
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,981
Down, knave! Down!

267
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:47,485
Ben haramed... A knave?

268
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,486
Ben haramed... A knave?

269
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,490
I am crushed.

270
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,992
Lower your Spears.

271
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,996
These desert vagabonds
seem to mean us no harm.

272
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,498
Why do you come to us?

273
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,501
We are a troupe of players,
your majesty...

274
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,503
uh, majesties.

275
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:09,507
We have no time for
making merry, as you see.

276
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,009
We break camp, and...

277
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,011
well, that's ridiculous.

278
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,513
Begging your pardon.

279
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,015
Nobody travels
the desert by night!

280
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,516
We do...

281
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,519
For we follow the star.

282
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,020
For we follow the star.

283
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,523
BEN: How very... Convenient.

284
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,025
But, uh...

285
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,027
Enough.

286
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,528
Begone.

287
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,530
Now, to resume our journey.

288
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,612
Now, to resume our journey.

289
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,535
So close.

290
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,538
My fortune was so close!

291
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,541
And see what they load
on the camels,

292
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,542
great one.

293
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,545
Gold!

294
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,547
Oh, it's too painful.

295
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,549
[MOANING]

296
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,052
AND MORE VALUABLE
EVEN THAN GOLD:

297
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,554
The precious eastern resins

298
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,058
frankincense and myrrh.

299
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:00,558
Frankincense and myrrh.

300
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,062
She is too weak to
go on, your majesties.

301
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,064
Poor creature.

302
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,066
She has been weakened
by the long journey.

303
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,568
Have we no extra beasts?

304
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,070
All are laden,

305
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,073
almost beyond their strength.

306
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:15,573
MELCHIOR: Wait!

307
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,077
Did that player not own a camel?

308
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,079
Perhaps he would sell it.

309
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
No!

310
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,081
No!

311
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,585
You strike a hard
bargain, player.

312
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,088
I've had a hard life.

313
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,589
CASPAR: Now load the beast,

314
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,591
and let us be on our way.

315
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:34,592
And let us be on our way.

316
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,602
Gold. Ah.

317
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,604
I adore the feel of it,

318
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,606
the weight of it,

319
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,608
the look of it.

320
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,610
Ahh.

321
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,111
Ahh.

322
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,614
Your share.

323
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,116
I don't want it!

324
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,618
I don't want any part of you!

325
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,121
Come, samson, baba.

326
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,123
We must find our old comrade.

327
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,124
No!

328

Yes.
