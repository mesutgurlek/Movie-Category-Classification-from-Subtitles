1
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:04,528
(bell rings)

2
00:00:04,612 --> 00:00:07,030
I thought you weren't
allowed here.

3
00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:08,081
I'm permitted
on school grounds

4
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:09,950
as long as I'm
getting my work.

5
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:11,334
Oh, I wanted to tell you
I'm available

6
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:12,619
for vocal coaching
if you need any help.

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,087
We need to bring our "A" game

8
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:16,039
if we have any chance
of beating the Trouble Tones.

9
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:17,490
Oh, we're not gonna have any
trouble with them.

10
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:20,177
Not as soon as I have
Shelby Corcoran fired.

11
00:00:20,261 --> 00:00:21,995
(whispers):
She's sleeping with Puck.

12
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:25,632
Look, that's a really, really
dangerous rumor

13
00:00:25,683 --> 00:00:27,300
to make up, okay?

14
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:28,969
You're gonna ruin
her entire reputation.

15
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,886
That's the plan.
And it's not a lie.

16
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:31,388
I heard it from Puck.

17
00:00:31,472 --> 00:00:34,173
First of all, Puck is 18, so
what he and Shelby are doing,

18
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:38,177
even though it's just wrong
and so gross, it's not illegal.

19
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:39,512
So all you're doing
is you're just,

20
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:40,614
you're getting her fired,

21
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,232
which is gonna take away
her income

22
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:44,534
to provide food and clothes

23
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:47,120
and put a roof over her
child's tiny little blonde head.

24
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:48,205
Sounds like an unfit mother.

25
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:49,539
And I'll be waiting in the wings

26
00:00:49,624 --> 00:00:50,991
when they take Beth away
from her.

27
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:51,992
Beth loves her mom.

28
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:54,411
Shelby is her real mom.

29
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:57,297
Look, you've done a lot
of really bad things, Quinn,

30
00:00:57,364 --> 00:01:00,333
but if you tell people about
this Puck-and-Shelby thing,

31
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:02,201
you'll be ruining this little
girl's life,

32
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:03,887
and then you'll have really
hit rock bottom.

33
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:11,878
(bell ringing)

34
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:15,482
Sectionals is in our auditorium
for the first time since 1963,

35
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,434
Too much talking,
not enough looking

36
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:18,551
for songs for Sectionals.

37
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:20,053
We need to do something upbeat.

38
00:01:20,104 --> 00:01:21,655
Mr. Shue, maybe we need
to concentrate

39
00:01:21,722 --> 00:01:23,907
on our performer problem
before we set a set list.

40
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:25,892
I mean, at least
the Cheerios! can dance.

41
00:01:25,943 --> 00:01:27,944
We need star power.

42
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:29,946
We need Sam Evans.

43
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:31,498
Sam transferred.
His whole family moved.

44
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:33,199
We don't even know where he is.

45
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:34,701
He's in Kentucky.

46
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:36,336
It's just across the
border from Cincinnati.

47
00:01:36,403 --> 00:01:38,121
It's about a four hours
from here.

48
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:40,790
Even homeless people
have Facebook.

49
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:45,629
Rachel and I might
as well get used

50
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:48,131
to a life of barista work
and summer stock.

51
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:49,599
There's no way we're
getting into NYADA now.

52
00:01:49,684 --> 00:01:51,250
If we don't win at Sectionals,

53
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:52,969
I pretty much have nothing
to live for.

54
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:56,022
New Directions! is a mess,
and we're gonna lose, Kurt,

55
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,141
and I can't do a thing about it.

56
00:01:58,225 --> 00:02:00,060
Every time I open my mouth,

57
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:02,929
Finn gives me these looks like,
"What does he think he's doing?"

58
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,814
I know what I'm doing.

59
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:06,366
Hey, guys!

60
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:08,535
It's so crazy.
I'm sitting

61
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:10,203
over there
checking out this guy

62
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,705
and all of a sudden I'm, like,

63
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:15,041
"Wait a second
I know that hair."

64
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:16,960
What's up, buddy?
Haven't seen you online.

65
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:18,628
Hi, Kurt.

66
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:20,630
We've been really busy
with Glee Club.

67
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:22,782
Practicing for Sectionals...
together.

68
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:26,452
Mmm, congrats on the Warbler win
at your sectionals.

69
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:28,955
We're up this week.

70
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:31,725
Yeah. Well, hey, if there's one
guy that can whip New Directions

71
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:34,427
into a legitimate threat,
it's Blaine Anderson, right?

72
00:02:34,478 --> 00:02:36,295
Right.
I need another coffee.

73
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:40,517
I don't like you.

74
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:42,686
Fun.
I don't like you either.

75
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,438
I don't like the way
you talk to my boyfriend,

76
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:47,490
I don't like your smirky
little meerkat face,

77
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:49,776
I don't like your
obnoxious CW hair. I'm onto you.

78
00:02:49,827 --> 00:02:52,362
Let's get a few things straight.
Blaine's too good for you.

79
00:02:52,446 --> 00:02:54,147
New Directions! is a joke.

80
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:55,699
And one of us has
a hard luck case

81
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:57,483
of the gay-face,
and it ain't me.

82
00:02:57,535 --> 00:03:00,453
Odds are by the end of the
school year, I'll have Blaine

83
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:02,339
and a nationals trophy,
and you'll have khakis

84
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:04,323
and a Lima Bean apron
and that gay face.

85
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,759
You smell like Craig's List.

86
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:08,178
What are you guys
talking about?

87
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:10,130
Duh, the next time we're all
going out drinking, killer!

88
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:11,715
Uh-oh.
Well, I gotta run.

89
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,019
But you take care of that
Warbler, Kurt. (clicks tongue)

90
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,726
Wait. This can't be
the right place.

91
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,145
Sam works in a bar?

92
00:03:25,196 --> 00:03:26,980
Well, there just aren't
a lot of theaters in
Northern Kentucky,

93
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:28,481
so theatre groups
just have

94
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:29,949
to perform in whatever
space they can find.

95
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:32,318
There's a lot of ladies here--
like, older ladies.

96
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,738
Finn, it's no secret
that dinner theater appeals

97
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:35,989
to elderly women.

98
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,074
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):
Good afternoon, ladies!

99
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,161
<i>Are you ready to meet
the men of Stallionz?</i>

100
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:45,999
Then please welcome
to the stage-- Cobra!

101
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,134
<i>I didn't know Backdraft was
a musical.</i>

102
00:03:48,202 --> 00:03:52,305
ANNOUNCER: Someone get the door,
'cause here comes Mr. Package.

103
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:53,973
(women screaming)

104
00:03:55,393 --> 00:03:56,726
Oh, God, no.

105
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:59,479
ANNOUNCER:
And ladies, let's give

106
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:02,816
a warm
welcome to White Chocolate!

107
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:17,414
♪ ♪

108
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:19,565
That's not an image I can
ever get out of my mind.

109
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:20,566
Give me a dollar.

110
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:21,951
What?
Just give me a dollar.

111
00:04:28,242 --> 00:04:30,293
Rach-Rachel...

112
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:32,378
I tried getting a real job.

113
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,431
DQ was great and I got
two free Blizzards a day,

114
00:04:34,515 --> 00:04:37,767
but it paid just over
minimum wage. Thanks.

115
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:39,853
You know how much
I made this afternoon?

116
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,689
60 bucks.

117
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:45,892
$61... in 15 minutes.

118
00:04:45,943 --> 00:04:48,445
Am I ashamed I work here?
Yeah, I'm ashamed.

119
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,980
My dad got a job working
construction to pay the rent,

120
00:04:51,065 --> 00:04:52,398
but when my brother needs
a new pair of shoes

121
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,652
or the TV busts,
these abs pay for it.

122
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:57,620
Your parents don't know
that you work here?

123
00:04:57,705 --> 00:04:59,572
No, they just think
the DQ pays really well.

124
00:05:00,624 --> 00:05:01,624
I'm good at this.

125
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:02,859
You're good at it
because you have

126
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:03,910
that a boy-next-door
innocence

127
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:04,661
that makes you
approachable, okay?

128
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:06,129
You're good at it for all

129
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:08,498
the reasons that you
shouldn't be doing it.

130
00:05:08,582 --> 00:05:12,552
Come back to McKinley, Sam.
We need you for Sectionals.

131
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,803
Tell me you don't want it.

132
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:16,089
Dude, you're young,
you got so much potential.

133
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,842
Working re is, like,
throwing your life away.

134
00:05:18,926 --> 00:05:22,979
Okay, I want it... but
my dad will never let me.

135
00:05:23,063 --> 00:05:24,998
Don't know till you ask.

136
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:26,850
Here we go.

137
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:34,240
Dad, Mom, what
I'm trying to say

138
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:36,442
is I want to go back
to Ohio with them.

139
00:05:36,494 --> 00:05:37,861
They need me to compete at
Sectionals this weekend.

140
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:39,496
And he could stay at one
of our houses,

141
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,164
so it wouldn't be
like he was homeless.

142
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:42,499
Not that there isn't

143
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,518
a quiet dignity in that
or anything.

144
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:48,654
You think you two could
go in the other room,

145
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:50,323
make yourselves
busy, please?

146
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,609
Yeah, totally-- I'm really
good at looking busy.

147
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:58,765
Son...

148
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:00,650
we've had a really tough year,

149
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:02,068
but now we've back
on our feet.

150
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:06,739
You had to become
a man much sooner

151
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:08,775
than other kids your age.

152
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:11,311
I'm-I'm proud of
what we've all done.

153
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:12,879
It's just that...

154
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:16,533
I miss being a teenager.

155
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:17,717
(Mom sniffles)

156
00:06:17,785 --> 00:06:19,986
Hey-hey-hey-hey...

157
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:23,406
Mom, please don't...
Look, if you cry, I won't go.

158
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,876
I'm just crying because...
(sniffles, sighs)

159
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:28,461
it just makes me so sad

160
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:30,964
to think of not seeing
your face every day.

161
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:33,049
Though I don't
understand why

162
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:35,468
the Dairy Queen makes you put
that glitter all over it.

163
00:06:35,535 --> 00:06:37,670
This gonna make you happy?

164
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:39,722
You have no idea.

165
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:43,893
Come on.

166
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:49,649
Are we sure yet which band
members are joining us?

167
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:51,601
Well, it looks like
"Floppy Hair Bass Dude,"

168
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:53,736
"Chapped Lips McGee,"
and "Johnny Tromboner."

169
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:55,355
God, we're screwed.
No, we're not.

170
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:57,556
I know for a fact
that we're winning.

171
00:06:57,608 --> 00:06:58,608
Hey, great news,
everybody.

172
00:06:58,692 --> 00:06:59,659
Sectionals is going to be

173
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:01,194
a challenge, but we have a--

174
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:04,330
Mr. Shue, we all appreciate
your endless supply

175
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:07,617
of affirmations, but all
the sparkling cider in the world

176
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,369
<i>can't deny the fact
that the Titanic has hit</i>

177
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,120
the iceberg and now
we're on a sinking ship.

178
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:13,572
Not if I can help it.
(all cheer)

179
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:18,094
Hey.
Hi!

180
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:19,929
Come here!

181
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:24,250
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't
for Finn and Rachel.

182
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:27,186
I sort of lost my way, but...

183
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:29,255
true friends help you
find your way back.

184
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:31,641
Let's hear it
for Sam Evans!

185
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:33,259
(all cheer)

186
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,861
All right, enough
of the sentimental stuff.

187
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,646
It's time y'all get
a little country

188
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,147
back in this joint! Oh!

189
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:38,948
(all exclaim)

190
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,033
Cheers!

191
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,485
Two, one, two, three.

Corn dogs!

240
00:09:56,703 --> 00:10:00,039
I just heard the news that
Trouty Mouth is back in town.

241
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,841
I've been keeping
a notebook, just in case

242
00:10:01,908 --> 00:10:02,925
this day ever came.

243
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,261
"Welcome back, Lisa Rinna.

244
00:10:05,345 --> 00:10:07,680
"I've missed you so much since
your family packed their bags,

245
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:09,215
"loaded them in your mouth,
and skipped town.

246
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:12,018
"I can't tell you how
many times I've wanted

247
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:13,686
"to enjoy a crisp pickle,
but couldn't find anyone

248
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:15,104
"to suck the lid off the jar.

"So glad you're back.

Love, Santana."

I missed you, too, Santana.

258
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:34,073
Oh, my God.

259
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:35,241
(bell rings)

260
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:43,616
Hey, Sam, wait up.

261
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:46,118
I'm sure you've heard

262
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,637
that Mercedes has
a new boyfriend.

263
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:50,289
He's got a full scholarship
to Ohio State.

264
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,507
Nice to see you,
too, Quinn.

265
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:52,558
No, no, it's a good thing.

266
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:54,293
See, I'm free,
you're free.

267
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:56,012
And I'm sure that you've noticed
that I'm supermodel thin

268
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:58,147
now that my thyroid is
under control.

269
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:00,349
What do you want, Quinn?

270
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:03,236
Look, last year
I didn't appreciate you.

271
00:11:03,303 --> 00:11:05,021
But we're
perfect together.

272
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:06,805
Quinn...
I'm gonna get Beth back.

273
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:09,659
And-And you'd be perfect
to help raise her.

274
00:11:09,726 --> 00:11:11,244
You're so good with kids.

275
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:12,278
What is so funny?

276
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:13,913
Quinn, you've got

277
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,281
what I call "rich
white girl problems."

278
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:17,149
It's a tough world
out there, I know.

279
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:18,251
I've been through it.

280
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:22,255
You only get one senior year.

281
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:23,623
Enjoy it.

282
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:28,177
You know that song "Jack and
Diane" by John Mellencamp?

283
00:11:28,262 --> 00:11:29,846
Please don't sing.
My favorite lyric

284
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,830
is this one:

285
00:11:31,882 --> 00:11:35,635
"Hold on to 16 as
long as you can."

286
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:42,570
+

287
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,933
with the applications?
Deadlines are this week.

288
00:11:51,984 --> 00:11:54,969
Tina, I already applied
to Stanford.

289
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,987
Pre-med.

290
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,408
But you don't want to be a
doctor, you want to be a dancer.

291
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:02,860
Not if it means ripping
my family apart.

292
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:04,495
My dad hasn't said
one word to me

293
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,164
<i>or my mom since
West Side Story.</i>

294
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:07,415
I'll dance in my free time.

295
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:09,000
Everyone's happy.

296
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:11,819
Except for you.
Mike, your dad needs to

297
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,254
understand that dancing
is your passion,

298
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:14,505
not some extracurricular.

299
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,990
I miss him, Tina.

300
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,009
I know.
But you have one life, Mike.

301
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:20,828
One chance to get it right.

302
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,046
Don't be a coward.

303
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:23,097
Don't call me that.

304
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:24,765
You won't make it as a dancer

305
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,101
if you're not 100% committed.

306
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:31,689
So maybe your dad's right.

307
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:33,674
Maybe you should be a doctor.

308
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:36,343
Or maybe he's right,
and we shouldn't be together.

309
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:39,897
(bell ringing)

310
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:41,232
WILL:
...six, seven, eight.

311
00:12:41,316 --> 00:12:42,617
Bum-bum-bum.

312
00:12:42,684 --> 00:12:43,851
Step and hit.

313
00:12:43,902 --> 00:12:45,036
Come on!
To the beat!

314
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,537
What does it even
matter, anyway?

315
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:47,788
It's not like we have
a chance of winning.

316
00:12:47,856 --> 00:12:48,873
Not without the girls.

317
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:51,209
Sir, girls smell
better than ham

318
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:52,910
and when they're dancing
and bouncing around,

319
00:12:52,995 --> 00:12:53,995
you can't help but watch them.

320
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:55,880
Well, that's it then.

321
00:12:55,964 --> 00:12:57,798
We'll take what's most appealing
about us as a group,

322
00:12:57,866 --> 00:12:59,584
and we'll use it
to our advantage.

323
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:02,470
Yeah, how about, you know,
something like, um...

324
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:04,255
something like that?

325
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:05,539
Cute!
I like the spin,
I like the spin.

326
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:06,373
Try it again.

327
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:07,558
Yeah.

328
00:13:07,643 --> 00:13:08,509
God, okay, stop, stop.

329
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,927
Look, Blaine,

330
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:12,563
this... is totally boy band.

331
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:15,683
What we need
to sell here is sex.

332
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:17,101
What the hell is that?

333
00:13:17,186 --> 00:13:18,319
That's a, it's a body roll.

334
00:13:18,386 --> 00:13:19,437
It's not a body roll.

335
00:13:19,521 --> 00:13:22,389
That is sex.

336
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:27,278
Man's not wrong.

337
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:29,947
I got light tingles where
it's only 50/50 for tingling.

338
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:31,199
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sam, that's awesome.

339
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,617
That's exactly what we need.

340
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:34,252
No, that's not,
that's not what we need.

341
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:37,571
We don't have to
resort to... that.

342
00:13:37,623 --> 00:13:39,240
It's cheap.

343
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,208
You know, it's selling out.

344
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:41,626
I came back here to win.

345
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,178
When you're desperate,
sometimes you got to,

346
00:13:44,246 --> 00:13:45,763
you know, use your assets
and do what you got to do

347
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:46,747
to get back that advantage.

348
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:49,433
This is the advantage.

349
00:13:49,518 --> 00:13:50,801
Of course that's what you think;
you have to

350
00:13:50,886 --> 00:13:52,053
think that
in order to sleep at night.

351
00:13:52,104 --> 00:13:53,888
What the hell does that mean?

352
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:55,640
It means that
I'm not for sale.

353
00:13:55,724 --> 00:13:57,358
WILL:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

354
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:59,310
Hey.

355
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:00,561
Forget it.

356
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:05,283
(bell ringing)

357
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,203
Is that Sam's face?

358
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:11,205
Yep. Yours, too.

359
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:14,542
Don't act so surprised.

360
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:17,128
After getting bullied so much,
I took up boxing.

361
00:14:17,212 --> 00:14:18,829
I also started the Dalton
branch of Fight Club,

362
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:24,252
which I obviously
can't talk about!

363
00:14:24,303 --> 00:14:26,137
What is your problem
with me, anyway?!

364
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:28,673
Ever since I got here, you've
given me nothing but crap.

365
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:33,678
Honestly, dude,
I was kind of jealous.

366
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:36,397
I felt threatened.

367
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:39,433
Your talent kind of
freaked me out,

368
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:41,602
made me question whether or not
I was good enough.

369
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:45,239
Look, Blaine, I'm sorry.

370
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:48,426
Uh, I've been acting
like a jackass to you.

371
00:14:48,493 --> 00:14:51,195
With Rachel gone,
you're the most

372
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,648
talented, well-rounded member
of this team.

373
00:14:53,715 --> 00:14:56,417
And now more than ever,
we need to be on the same page.

374
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:58,586
United.

375
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:02,623
Tell me what you need me to do.

376
00:15:02,674 --> 00:15:04,258
We have an opportunity.

377
00:15:04,326 --> 00:15:06,294
An opportunity to be remembered
at this school

378
00:15:06,345 --> 00:15:08,763
for the rest of our lives
for doing the impossible.

379
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,350
But it all starts right here,
with you and me.

380
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:15,469
I just want to be able to look
across that stage at you

381
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,057
and know that we did
everything we could.

382
00:15:20,142 --> 00:15:22,059
No regrets.

383
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:30,985
Let's get back to work.

384
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:32,620
(chuckles)

385
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:33,704
All right.

386
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:36,040
(bell ringing)

387
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:37,575
What are you doing?

388
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:39,193
Holding your hand.

389
00:15:39,244 --> 00:15:40,077
Don't.

390
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:41,078
Sam, look, I...

391
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:42,630
I heard about your boyfriend.

392
00:15:42,697 --> 00:15:45,366
Then you heard he's
built like a bulldozer.

393
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:50,504
We had a summer fling.
It was more than that.

394
00:15:50,555 --> 00:15:53,424
I'll always have a special place
in my heart for you,

395
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:56,427
but... I've moved on.

396
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:58,512
And you need to do the same.

397
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:04,235
I don't care how big
or bad your boyfriend is.

398
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:06,070
I'm gonna fight
to get you back.

399
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:09,935
+

400
00:16:19,138 --> 00:16:20,639
<i>What's this?
A bootleg of
West Side Story.</i>

401
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:22,641
Starring your son.

402
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:25,026
You missed
the performance,

403
00:16:25,094 --> 00:16:27,579
but I thought you should see how
truly incredible Mike was in it.

404
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,364
Go. Take that with you.

405
00:16:29,432 --> 00:16:30,365
Are you sure?

406
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:32,033
'Cause if you saw it,

407
00:16:32,101 --> 00:16:34,736
then maybe you'd realize
that Mike's throwing

408
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:38,573
everything he loves away
just to please you.

409
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,942
And if you don't make it right,
he's going to spend

410
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:42,828
the rest of his life
doing something he hates,

411
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:44,546
dying inside.

412
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:46,281
Tina...

413
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:48,250
sit.

414
00:16:48,301 --> 00:16:49,334
Please.

415
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,224
You want to be a performer, too?

416
00:16:57,677 --> 00:16:59,428
And your parents support this?

417
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:00,679
They love me.

418
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:01,796
They love you,

419
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:02,848
but they're not honest with you.

420
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:03,849
And you children,

421
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,435
you think you know everything,

422
00:17:06,486 --> 00:17:08,904
but this path
you've chosen, Tina,

423
00:17:08,971 --> 00:17:10,705
the one you want
Mike to choose, too,

424
00:17:10,773 --> 00:17:13,692
there'll be such heartache.

425
00:17:13,776 --> 00:17:15,861
So few opportunities for you.

426
00:17:15,945 --> 00:17:17,496
I know. I've heard the jokes.

427
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,646
I better hope they do

428
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:19,831
<i>a musical of The Joy Luck Club</i>

429
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:20,866
<i>or Memoirs of a Geisha.</i>

430
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,501
I don't care.

431
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:24,119
Performing is
what I need to do--

432
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,620
same as your son.

433
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,255
And it may be hard,

434
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:29,207
but it's what we were
born to do.

435
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:42,904
You know, you're always
talking about honor,

436
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:44,339
Mr. Chang.

437
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,193
Help your son honor his gift.

438
00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:57,452
(warming up):
♪ La, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la ♪

439
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,688
♪ La, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la ♪

440
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,541
Okay, guys,
you're going to want to sing

441
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,409
from your diaphragm
as much as you can.

442
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:06,745
And if you forget the words,
just keep your lips moving.

443
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:08,380
Hopefully, nobody
will notice.

444
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:10,532
Let's take a few moments
to gather our thoughts.

445
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,417
Trouble Tones
are on in five.

446
00:18:12,502 --> 00:18:15,036
Good luck out there.

447
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:17,205
What?
Why would you try
and talk to my dad?

448
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:18,873
You're making things worse.

449
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:20,509
He almost didn't
let me come today.

450
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,760
I'm really disappointed
in you, Tina.

451
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:23,011
Well, that makes
two of us,

452
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:24,045
'cause I'm really
disappointed in you.

453
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:26,047
Hello, Will.

454
00:18:26,098 --> 00:18:28,683
Looking good, ladies!

455
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,885
We just came to say,
may the best glee club win.

456
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:33,488
Yes, and just in case
that glee club is us,

457
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:36,724
I have convinced Miss Corcoran
to consider a contingency plan.

458
00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:38,726
SHELBY: Yes, in the event
of a New Directions! loss,

459
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:40,061
Trouble Tones has voted

460
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:41,997
to allow any of you
to join us at Regionals.

461
00:18:42,064 --> 00:18:43,798
You're welcome.
Excuse me?

462
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:45,083
That's incredibly
rude, Santana.

463
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,419
We're being nice.
It would be rude if I

464
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:48,903
followed you around
and every time you took a step,

465
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:51,172
I played a note on a tuba.

466
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,041
Thank you for the offer,
Miss Corcoran, but right now,

467
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,709
we're gonna concentrate
on winning this thing.

468
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,411
And we will be winning, Shelby.

469
00:18:56,462 --> 00:18:57,912
We've got it in the bag.

470
00:18:57,964 --> 00:19:00,748
Puck here is going to
come through for us.

471
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,934
He's such a shining star,
in every conceivable way.

472
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:03,885
Don't you think?

473
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:07,973
Good luck, everybody.

474
00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:09,524
See you on the ice.

475
00:19:16,816 --> 00:19:17,949
Sad?

476
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:20,619
Devastated.

477
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,787

Wow.
(chuckles)

527
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:54,055
I didn't count on that one.

528
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:57,308
Where are you going?

529
00:21:59,061 --> 00:22:00,945
Aren't you supposed to be
in the auditorium?

530
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,314
I saw you leave the auditorium.
I know what you're gonna go do.

531
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:05,283
You're gonna go tell Figgins
about Shelby and Puck.

532
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,735
I'm an adult.

533
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:08,119
I can do
whatever I want.

534
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:09,738
If you want to be
a destructive force

535
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:11,122
in the universe,
that's your business, okay,

536
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:13,158
but can you just please
at least wait until after

537
00:22:13,242 --> 00:22:14,993
the Trouble Tones perform?
Why?

538
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:17,078
Because we don't want
to wreck all the hard work

539
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:19,330
that our friends in that group
put into their performance.

540
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:22,300
So we win.
No, not like that.

541
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:25,220
Look, just... if you're going
to go through with this,

542
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:27,255
you owe it to Shelby
to tell her first.

543
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:28,973
It's the adult thing to do.

544
00:22:31,227 --> 00:22:33,294
(sighs)

545
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:37,298
I got a taste of what it's like
to do the wrong thing.

546
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:39,801
Okay? And it feels awful.

547
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,350
+

548
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:49,244
Does she have a temperature?

549
00:22:47,895 --> 00:22:50,096
Okay, forget it.
I'll be home in an hour.

550
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:55,283
Looks like I'm going
to be missing

551
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,635
my own victory party.
Puck told me about you two.

552
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,954
I'm going to tell Figgins
and get you fired.

553
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:02,724
I'm ending it.

554
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:04,476
Not that there's

555
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,561
that much "it" to end.

556
00:23:06,628 --> 00:23:07,628
You shouldn't have
come here with her.

557
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,813
I would have been fine.

558
00:23:08,898 --> 00:23:10,515
What you did was wrong.

559
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,516
What you're doing with Puck
is wrong.

560
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:16,738
You're so young... pretty...

561
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:17,939
Don't talk down to me.

562
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,691
It goes away, you know.

563
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:21,910
Not the pretty--
you'll always be pretty--

564
00:23:21,977 --> 00:23:24,045
but the young.

565
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:26,848
It happens really slow,
and you don't even notice it,

566
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,550
and then, one day...

567
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:31,786
everything just feels different.

568
00:23:31,837 --> 00:23:33,171
I can't wait to feel different.

569
00:23:33,255 --> 00:23:34,956
Don't wish away your life.

570
00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:36,791
You're exactly
where you're supposed to be.

571
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:39,794
I think I thought
that being with an 18-year-old

572
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:41,096
would make me feel 18 again,

573
00:23:41,163 --> 00:23:44,766
but mostly, it just
made me feel even older.

574
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:48,603
(sighs)

575
00:23:48,671 --> 00:23:50,805
All right.

576
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:53,608
I'm going to enjoy my last
few hours of being a teacher.

577
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:58,063
I recommend that you enjoy
being up on that stage.

578
00:23:58,147 --> 00:23:59,848

Get over here!

802
00:34:55,808 --> 00:34:58,176
Gave it our all.
Yeah, we did.

803
00:35:00,796 --> 00:35:03,181
Top dogs! Yes!
This is what I was missing!

804
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:06,067
I just...
I can't believe it.

805
00:35:06,135 --> 00:35:08,687
I can't believe
he actually came.

806
00:35:08,771 --> 00:35:10,355
He stood and...

807
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:11,573
Michael.

808
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,242
May I speak
with you?

809
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,710
Both of you?

810
00:35:15,778 --> 00:35:18,363
Dancing is your talent,
your dream.

811
00:35:18,447 --> 00:35:20,665
That's what
you tried to tell me.

812
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,517
That's what you
tried to tell me.

813
00:35:22,585 --> 00:35:24,869
And that's what
I saw tonight.

814
00:35:24,954 --> 00:35:27,872
This is your path, son,
so you must follow it,

815
00:35:27,957 --> 00:35:29,624
and make us proud.

816
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:31,159
And your mother
and I, we will

817
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,762
help you follow it
however we can.

818
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:37,198
Apply to dance schools--
the best ones.

819
00:35:38,718 --> 00:35:39,834
Dad...

820
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,279
Dad, I... I missed
the deadlines, I think.

821
00:35:51,347 --> 00:35:52,897
No, you didn't.

822
00:35:52,982 --> 00:35:56,151
I sent in your applications,
just in case.

823
00:35:56,202 --> 00:35:59,687
I kind of had to forge
your signature, though.

824
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:03,041
I love you so much.

825

(honks horn)

826
00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:14,419
As an award-winning clown,
I'd like to say

827
00:36:14,503 --> 00:36:17,205
that it's nice, for once,
to be working with kids

828
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:18,757
that are just sick with talent.

829
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:24,346
Third place-- The Unitards!

830
00:36:24,397 --> 00:36:25,730

831
00:36:29,652 --> 00:36:30,885
Harmony...

832
00:36:30,936 --> 00:36:33,154
Hi. I just wanted
to tell you

833
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:34,306
that I thought you
were really amazing.

834
00:36:34,373 --> 00:36:35,890
And just think,
I'm only a sophomore

835
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:37,325
and I'm already this good.

836
00:36:37,393 --> 00:36:38,743
Next year's going
to be a bloodbath.

837
00:36:57,129 --> 00:36:58,346
In second place...

838
00:37:00,582 --> 00:37:02,217
...we have the Trouble Tones!

839
00:37:02,268 --> 00:37:04,686
In first place
is New Directions!

840

(light switches clanking,

843
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:51,900
Well, my suspension
is officially over.

844
00:37:51,967 --> 00:37:54,235
It'll still be on
my transcript, though.

845
00:37:54,303 --> 00:37:55,854
I'm just hoping that

846
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:57,906
the admissions department
at NYADA sees it

847
00:37:57,973 --> 00:37:59,691
as a sign of my artistic,
rebellious, attitude.

848
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:00,942
Good luck with that.

849
00:38:00,993 --> 00:38:04,028
Are you going to go tell
Figgins about Shelby?

850

'Cause I just...
I still think

851
00:38:05,781 --> 00:38:07,198
that it's a really
terrible idea.

852
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:09,284
I came here to talk
to you, actually.

853
00:38:09,335 --> 00:38:11,286
To tell you I'm not
going to tell.

854
00:38:11,337 --> 00:38:13,288
Why?

855
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:16,374
Because I love Beth, and I don't
want to ruin her life.

856
00:38:16,459 --> 00:38:17,792
I wanted to thank you actually.

857
00:38:17,843 --> 00:38:19,594
For what?

858
00:38:19,661 --> 00:38:22,263
For keeping me from
doing something stupid.

859
00:38:22,331 --> 00:38:24,232
Something I would have regretted
my entire life.

860
00:38:26,552 --> 00:38:28,970
We're kind of friends, huh?

861
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:30,939
Kind of.

862
00:38:31,006 --> 00:38:34,609
What do you
think about Yale?

863
00:38:34,676 --> 00:38:37,178
Oh, no, I have my
sights set on NYADA.

864
00:38:37,229 --> 00:38:39,814
No, for me.

865
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:41,349
I'm not the singer
that you and Kurt are,

866
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,952
but Yale has an amazing
drama program.

867
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:47,489
And I really do
like to perform.
Yeah.

868
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,825
Certainly would nail all the
parts where the girl has to cry.

869
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:52,494
No, I think it's a great idea.

870
00:38:52,545 --> 00:38:54,963
I mean, especially since you
won't have me to compete with.

871
00:38:56,298 --> 00:38:58,249
You're a lot better
than you know.

872
00:39:00,052 --> 00:39:02,837
Well, I'll see you
at Glee Club.

873
00:39:02,888 --> 00:39:05,706
Where are you going?
I have a couple people
I need to talk to.

874
00:39:05,758 --> 00:39:07,175
Okay, well, I don't know

875
00:39:07,226 --> 00:39:11,212
if you need help with
your Yale application...

876
00:39:11,263 --> 00:39:12,547
Not with the Yale application,

877
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:14,899
but, um, there is something
you could do for me.

878
00:39:16,885 --> 00:39:19,020
We were better.
I don't know, I think it
could have gone either way.

879
00:39:19,071 --> 00:39:20,388
It was that damn Trouty Mouth.

880
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:22,723
Even I felt a little
something in my lady loins

881
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,776
when he did that
magic sex dance.

882
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,728
All right, ladies,
girl talk.

883
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,615
No. Uh-uh. Don't you dare try
and give us a pep talk.

884
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:33,618
Or ask us to come back to New
Directions-- not interested.

885
00:39:33,702 --> 00:39:35,670
Wait, is it even possible?
Do you think they would

886
00:39:35,737 --> 00:39:37,005
really take us back?
Of course they would
take us back.

887
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:38,623
But I'm telling you,
I'm not going.

888
00:39:38,707 --> 00:39:41,042
Do you know what growing up
is about?

889
00:39:41,093 --> 00:39:42,510
Losing things.

890
00:39:42,578 --> 00:39:45,413
In six months, we'll
all be gone, scattered.

891
00:39:45,481 --> 00:39:47,348
We'll keep in touch.

892
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:48,883
Yeah, but it
won't be the same.

893
00:39:48,934 --> 00:39:51,085
When we see each other,
it'll be a special occasion.

894
00:39:51,136 --> 00:39:52,387
It'll be different.

895
00:39:52,454 --> 00:39:55,056
I don't want to grow up yet.

896
00:39:55,107 --> 00:39:57,192
I'm not ready
to lose you girls.

897
00:39:57,259 --> 00:39:58,926
What are we supposed to do?

898
00:39:58,978 --> 00:40:01,479
Come back to Glee Club and sing
background for Blaine and Berry

899
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:03,764
until we graduate?
I'm not doing that again.

900
00:40:03,816 --> 00:40:06,100
We know what it feels like
to be out front now.

901
00:40:06,151 --> 00:40:08,903
What if Mr. Shue agreed
to let the Trouble Tones

902
00:40:08,954 --> 00:40:11,272
sing at least one number
per competition?

903
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:14,409
Well, even if Mr. Shue did agree
to that, Rachel never would.

904
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,995
What if I told you that
they both already did?

905
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,913
I'm listening.

906
00:40:18,964 --> 00:40:20,448
Look, I know I went
a little crazy.

907
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:22,967
But I'm here now.

908
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:25,253
I'm 17-- I have the rest
of my life in front of me.

909
00:40:25,304 --> 00:40:26,454
I love Glee Club.

910
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:28,590
I love you girls.

911
00:40:28,657 --> 00:40:33,144
And when we're 27, or 87,

912
00:40:33,229 --> 00:40:35,513
I want us to be able to look
back on these next couple months

913
00:40:35,598 --> 00:40:39,651
and talk about how it was
the best times of our lives.

914
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:42,153
Can't do that if we're
not all together.

915
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,641
We're doing a big number
in the auditorium

916
00:40:46,692 --> 00:40:49,244
to celebrate our victory
and to prepare for Regionals.

917
00:40:49,311 --> 00:40:51,646
We could use a couple
more girl voices.

918
00:40:51,697 --> 00:40:54,782
