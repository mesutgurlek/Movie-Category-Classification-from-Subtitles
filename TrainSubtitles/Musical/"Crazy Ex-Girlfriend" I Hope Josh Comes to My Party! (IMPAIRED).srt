(humming)

6
00:00:24,812 --> 00:00:27,117
Hi. Thank you so much for coming.

7
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:28,625
Hi. You said there was
a... an emergency? What?

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,171
Yeah, yeah, I'm so... Something is wrong

9
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,195
with my garbage disposal

10
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:32,845
is completely clogged.

11
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:33,921
I don't know what happened.

12
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:36,226
And I know that, you
know, you're a real fixer

13
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:38,652
from summer camp, wood shop,
making all those lanyards,

14
00:00:38,677 --> 00:00:39,709
so I figured you could help me.

15
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,034
And I know that you're wondering, like,

16
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:42,368
why haven't I called a service.

17
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,703
Well, one time, I called
a service in New York,

18
00:00:44,705 --> 00:00:46,179
and the handyman stole
my grandmother's necklace

19
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:48,651
- from Krakow, so I thought never again. 
- WHITE JOSH: Wow.

20
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:51,744
- Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow! 
- Oh.

21
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,195
Hi, White Josh. You brought
White Josh. How nice.

22
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,507

42
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,419
So, uh... so you got a clog, huh?

43
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:34,773
Sure it's not an obstruction,

44
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,332
backup? Could be a stoppage.

45
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:38,624
I... I have no idea.

46
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:41,360
Let me take a look.

47
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:44,242
Whoa. There's like a
crapload of chicken in here.

48
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:46,165
It's almost like you tried to break it.

49
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:49,034
Okay, um, so, while White Josh

50
00:01:49,036 --> 00:01:51,937
is fixing the garbage disposal,
why don't you and I catch up?

51
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,105
So, how have you been?

52
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:54,507
Sorry about Whi-Jo.

53
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,742
You know, Valencia is
still not super psyched

54
00:01:56,744 --> 00:01:59,011
about you and I hanging out alone together,

55
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:01,380
so, in case she finds out I was here,

56
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:03,335
I can say White Josh was here, too.

57
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:07,453
Valencia... when she gets mad,
she, like... ugh... hulks out.

58
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:09,121
But what's she mad about? Like, I don't...

59
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:10,923
I don't really understand
what she's mad about.

60
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:12,524
Ugh! Are you crazy?!

61
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:14,159
Why does everyone want to have sex with me?

62
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:17,129
It's a circle of love, because
I love you, you love Josh,

63
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:19,164
and Josh and I used to love each other.

64
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,366
<i>Oh, that.</i>

65
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:21,934
Yeah. Oh, she's still angry about that?

66
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:23,168
Oh, my God!

67
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,104
It's like, shake it off, girlfriend.

68
00:02:25,106 --> 00:02:26,739
That was ages ago!

69
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:28,407
It was six days ago.

70
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,542
Well, yeah, I mean, I just
need a buffer, you know.

71
00:02:30,544 --> 00:02:31,744
Yeah. Especially since Valencia's...

72
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:33,679
She's out of town at some yoga retreat.

73
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,180
Oh, she's out of town?

74
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:37,182
You know, it's so funny that she's so angry

75
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,751
because I've tried to tell her repeatedly

76
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:40,152
that you and I are just friends

77
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:41,921
and that I'm really on the hunt

78
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:43,789
for, like, cute, single guys, you know.

79
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,546
It's so hot in here. Aah!

80
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:49,929
Hey, buddy, if you're gonna
sweat, can you put down a towel?

81
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:51,830
Oh, sorry. I'm actually...
I'm done, anyway.

82
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:53,098
Disposal's fixed.

83
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,833
Oh, great. Then we should jet.

84
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:56,335
Oh. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

85
00:02:56,337 --> 00:02:58,737
Why-why don't we... why don't
we watch a movie, and-and...

86
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,572
and Buffer can play with my phone? Hmm?

87
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:02,675
- Here you go, bud. 
- Ah.

88
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:04,610
You got a step counter on here?

89
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:07,382
Whoa! It is very low.
I'm gonna catch you up.

90
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:09,581
Uh, no, we got to go.

91
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,734
Anyway, don't you have,
like, work or something?

92
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,653
Um, actually, today is Weekend Tuesday.

93
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:17,089
Yeah, it's like, uh, Casual Friday, but

94
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:19,320
even more chill and on a Tuesday.

95
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:20,742
And, um, we make it up

96
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,494
by working Saturdays once a quarter.

97
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,570
That sounds confusing.

98
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:24,861
I don't disagree.

99
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:26,819
Uh, yeah, come on, dude, we got to go.

100
00:03:26,844 --> 00:03:28,242
Um, it was great to see you, Becks.

101
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:29,600
You know, glad we could help.

102
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:31,303
Just a little advice.

103
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:32,871
Uh, no chicken in the disposal ever.

104
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:35,307
Also, no fish bones, also, uh, no seeds.

105
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:37,109
Also, lemons seem bad,
but they're actually good.

106
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:38,023
Cool.

107
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:39,999
Thanks for the tips. Thanks
for the help. Uh-huh. Sure.

108
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:41,924
Uh, put on a shirt 'cause
no one wants to see that.

109
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:43,615
- I'm so sorry. 
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's totally fine.

110
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:44,875
Yeah, no. No problem.

111
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,799
Sorry. See you, Becks.

112
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,674
- All right. 
- (door opens)

113
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:50,489
(door closes)

114
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:52,624
Oh, God.

115
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:55,007
(whimpering)

116
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:05,504
Darryl Whitefeather.

117
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:07,473
Hi, Darryl. It's Rebecca.

118
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:09,617
Listen, I don't know if I'm
gonna make it in to work today.

119
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:10,774
Oh, why?

120
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,389
I'm just not... I'm not feeling well.

121
00:04:13,414 --> 00:04:15,398
Oh, really? What-what is it?

122
00:04:16,502 --> 00:04:20,571
Um... my ovaries are eking out

123
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:23,975
into my fallopian tubes,
and they're wrapped around...

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,868
You know what? We'll see you
when you're feeling better.

125
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:27,893
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

126
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:29,500
Wow. Men are stupid.

127
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:32,618
(knocking)

128
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:33,842
Come in.

129
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:35,267
(door opens)

130
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:37,369
PAULA: Darryl said your uterus exploded.

131
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:39,656
You know, if that's true, should

132
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:41,450
probably go to the hospital or something.

133
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:45,511
I know what this is. This is Chan-itus.

134
00:04:45,513 --> 00:04:48,480
Again, I just moved here
for a change. I didn't

135
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:49,882
- move here for Josh. 
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

136
00:04:49,884 --> 00:04:52,084
- Yeah, yeah. I got it...
- West Covina. Pretzel...

137
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:53,585
- Got it. 
- Okay.

138
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:55,654
Fine. You know, I'll admit it.

139
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:57,990
I want to be his friend.

140
00:04:57,992 --> 00:05:00,392
Okay? Sue me. But now his

141
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:02,661
stupid, dum-dum-face
girlfriend

142
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:05,597
has officially barred him
from being alone with me.

143
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:07,232
Yeah, I saw that coming.

144
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:09,906
I don't know what to do.

145
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:12,598
Well, that's okay, 'cause I do.

146
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:13,855
Huh? Oh, come on.

147
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,580
It's a classic dilemma.

148
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:17,538
How do you see your crush...

149
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:20,079
I mean, friend... without
pissing off his girlfriend,

150
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:24,483
and look fabu in a super-tight
low-cut dress in the process?

151
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:26,685
There's a solution, a loophole.

152
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:29,195
It is in every teen movie ever made.

153
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:31,471
It's a car wash?

154
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:32,962
Throw a big party!

155
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:35,752
- No. 
- What?

156
00:05:35,777 --> 00:05:37,468
Yes, throw a big party.

157
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:38,726
That way, when Josh comes,

158
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:40,317
you're not technically alone with him,

159
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:42,578
- and then he can't get in trouble! 
- Okay, I see your logic...

160
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:45,265
Very sound logic, um, but I don't do that.

161
00:05:45,406 --> 00:05:47,773
I don't throw parties.
It's not a thing I do.

162
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:50,507
- I go to parties. 
- Okay. Why?

163
00:05:50,578 --> 00:05:52,644
(sighs) Oh, God, um...

164
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:55,460
it's, like, a super long story.

165
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,117
Okay, um, ooh...

166
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,304
- So, when I was 12... 
- PAULA: Okay.

167
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:01,695
No, no. I don't have time for this.

168
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:04,359
What happened? The tissues
fell out of your training bra?

169
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:07,052
You period-ed on a white
couch? We've all been there.

170
00:06:07,495 --> 00:06:11,296
I period-ed on an ultra suede settee in 1987

171
00:06:11,298 --> 00:06:13,398
at Roberta Janatelli's condo, and

172
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,648
I got to tell you, it
was still a great party.

173
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:18,819
I wrapped a sweater around my waist,

174
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:21,945
then hooked up with Bobby Henderson anyway.

175
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,837
And started the whole, um,

176
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:25,762
sweater-around-the-waist
trend while I was at it.

177
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:26,992
So, you're welcome.

178
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:29,292
Paula, you don't
understand what I am saying.

179
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:31,451
I need you to listen to me, okay?

180
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,382
This was the worst party of all time.

181
00:06:35,756 --> 00:06:39,124
<i>So, I invited everyone in my
grade to come over to my house</i>

182
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:40,993
<i>and watch the pay-per-view
concert of my favorite</i>

183
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:42,461
<i>boy band, Room Temperature.</i>

184
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:43,996
<i>So, I threw this party,</i>

185
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:46,101
<i>and this is how many people showed up.</i>

186
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,098
(dinging)

187
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:49,868
Concert starts in ten minutes!

188
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,257
Who's psyched?!

189
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:53,672
Well,

190
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,908
<i>that was a tepid response.</i>

191
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,609
(laughs) Get it?

192
00:06:57,781 --> 00:06:59,478
It's a temperature joke.

193
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,979
<i>And then it happened.</i>

194
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:03,448
WOMAN: Keep your voice
down. She's having a party.

195
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,515
MAN: You call that a party? That's
her and her three loser friends.

196
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:06,906
You couldn't even throw her a decent party!

197
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:08,530
WOMAN: Well, then why
don't you call your whore

198
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:09,922
and ask her what she would do?!

199
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:14,226
Um, they're just rehearsing a play called

200
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:15,585
<i>The Worst Parents Ever.</i>

201
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,611
It's going up at the
Westchester Community Playhouse.

202
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:19,734
That's it. I've had it.

203
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,844
Hey, I'll get you
tickets. Who wants tickets?

204
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:23,101
If you walk out that door,

205
00:07:23,103 --> 00:07:24,336
I don't ever want to see you again!

206
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:25,470
Is that a promise? Yes!

207
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:26,872
Can I get that in writing?! Yes!

208
00:07:39,034 --> 00:07:40,093
Good luck, kiddo.

209
00:07:42,507 --> 00:07:43,685
I got to get out of here.

210
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,457
WOMAN: Don't you dare.

211
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:48,083
Don't you dare.

212
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:52,085
(yelling): Don't you dare!

213
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:52,984
(door closes)

214
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:56,068
(panting)

215
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,617
(door closes)

216
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:00,620
(voice breaking): Don't tell anybody

217
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:03,695
at school about this, okay?

218
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,623
Oh, my God.

219
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:10,656
It's the root of all my party fears.

220
00:08:11,187 --> 00:08:13,719
Actually, it's the root
of all my fears, period.

221
00:08:14,054 --> 00:08:17,756
Babe, you don't think
that I get being afraid?

222
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:21,193
I wake up every morning in cold sweats

223
00:08:21,195 --> 00:08:23,562
worried that I'm wasting my entire life

224
00:08:23,564 --> 00:08:26,171
with a man who spends all his
time with a barbershop quartet

225
00:08:26,196 --> 00:08:28,304
called The West Brovinas.

226
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:30,218
- No, you never told me the name. 
- Yes.

227
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,081
And my children... I
mean, their only hope is

228
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:34,350
that they get into a really good gang.

229
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,242
I mean, honey, I am scared
every day of my life.

230
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:39,687
But you can be brave. I know you can.

231
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:43,617
All you got to do is stand up
to your fears, do you understand?

232
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:45,812
I understand you in theory.

233
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:48,520
Listen to me. His GF is out of town.

234
00:08:48,522 --> 00:08:50,322
<i>The moment is now!</i>

320
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:20,890
Yes!

321
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:22,514
Ooh, yes! Ah, good!

322
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:24,573
Okay, pity party over.
Let's throw a real party!

323
00:12:24,598 --> 00:12:27,299
- Aah! I'm horrified. 
- Game plan. Okay.

324
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:29,304
- But let's do it! 
- Yeah. Yay!

325
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:34,944
- (humming softly) 
- Oh, you know what would be awesome?

326
00:12:34,969 --> 00:12:36,703
We need salt.

327
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:41,248
Um, since it's Weekend Tuesday, um,

328
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:43,639
can we just go home?

329
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:46,065
(chuckles) See, it's Weekend Tuesday,

330
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:47,679
but it's not the real weekend.

331
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,235
Now, look, Bill,

332
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:50,502
why don't you put on that sombrero

333
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,507
and then head on back to work?

334
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:55,953
- Right. 
- Right?

335
00:12:56,953 --> 00:12:58,500
Weekend Tuesday.

336
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:02,214
So, the first thing we need
to do is choose a theme.

337
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:03,449
Don't worry about that. I have planned

338
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:05,384
a million parties in my life.

339
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:06,552
I will take care of that part.

340
00:13:06,554 --> 00:13:07,920
You handle the invites.

341
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:08,757
- Okay. 
- Okay?

342
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:10,756
Ladies, are you working 
on the Castwick case?

343
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:12,891
- Because it's... 
- Weekend Tuesday, Darryl.

344
00:13:13,164 --> 00:13:13,993
Okay.

345
00:13:13,995 --> 00:13:14,793
Yeah.

346
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,328
No. Sorry. You're right.

347
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:19,031
I may not have thought this day through.

348
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:25,271
<i>PAULA: Hey, Brendan,</i>

349
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:27,867
have you seen that tablecloth
with the roses on it?

350
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:30,276
What? Haven't seen it.

351
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:32,478
Hey, what have I said about
the katana on the table?

352
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:34,780
Or...

353
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:37,650
you could just stare at
me like a serial killer.

354
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:39,051
Scott?

355
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:41,882
- Scott! 
- (humming)

356
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:45,982
- Scott! 
- Huh? Huh?

357
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:47,860
What? Sorry. We have
the semifinals coming up

358
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:49,061
against the Glendorables.

359
00:13:49,063 --> 00:13:50,863
They're the a-cappella group from Glendora.

360
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:53,832
- They're the best in the state. (humming) 
- Okay, I'm looking

361
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,434
for that white tablecloth that we have,

362
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:56,635
the one with the roses on it.

363
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,037
- Yeah, I saw it. 
- (gasps) Great!

364
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,054
- Where is it? 
- I threw it out. (humming)

365
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,367
Wait! You threw it out? 
That was from our wedding.

366
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,542
I gave it to Goodwill when you asked me

367
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:04,777
to clean out the cabinet.

368
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,445
Okay, well, if I asked you

369
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:07,713
to take out the recyclables,

370
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:09,048
would you throw out our wedding album?

371
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,383
'Cause it is partly made of paper.

372
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:12,785
I don't know what you're asking me.

373
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:15,646
(humming)

374
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:17,189
You know, the world doesn't
revolve around barbershop.

375
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,725
Nothing revolves around barbershop!

376
00:14:20,218 --> 00:14:22,428
Not even a revolving barbershop pole

377
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,064
revolves around barbershop.

378
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:26,432
This damn teacher. Teacher's...

379
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:29,301

00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:30,769
What's up, Tommy?

381
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:33,305
I have a test tomorrow, and I
don't know any of this stuff.

382
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:34,807
I'm stupid.

383
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:36,975
You are not stupid.

384
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:39,645
You are in the highest
percentiles of kids with ADHD

385
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:42,481
and OCD and SAD and a panic disorder

386
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:44,116
and restless leg syndrome...

387
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:46,618
Mom, I'm gonna fail the test.

388
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:49,221
You're not. I know you're not.

389
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:52,078
Look, just, you know, don't be afraid

390
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,804
and-and face your fears.

391
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:57,625
Run with scissors, you know?

392
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,164
What?

393
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,333
That's bad advice, Mom.

Yeah. No, I get it. I get it. It's just,

you know, it kind of
looks like you're going

- to light your house on fire. 
- No.

399

- No, I don't see that. Mm-mm. 
- Okay.

Yeah. Yeah.

411

people. You know people

biggest event of the season.

479
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:32,644
A party.

480
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:34,613
Wow. A flyer.

481
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,648
Is it also, like, a church bake sale, too?

482
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:39,885
It's gonna be so fun. And I actually...

483
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:41,520
I really would like you to come.

484
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:43,455
Let's review. We've been out twice.

485
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,725
The first time, we kissed
and then you started crying.

486
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:49,261
The second time, you kissed
a girl, she didn't like it,

487
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:52,331
and she left crying. We don't
have a good track record here.

488
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,666
Dude, like, that actually
really hurts my feelings,

489
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:57,502
because I consider you to be
one of my best friends here.

490
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,237
- What? 
- Yeah, I do.

491
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:02,738
True, we've had some “altercations,”

492
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:03,675
if that's what you call them,

493
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:05,444
yeah, but that's the hallmark

494
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:07,052
of, like, a strong friendship, you know?

495
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:10,626
Saying the worst possible
things to each other

496
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:13,485
and then going to a party.

497
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:14,720
Wow. It is so tempting.

498
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:16,755
It is so tempt... No.

499
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:20,511
Okay. Wow. Okay.

500
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,630
You know, I tried extending
the olive branch to you,

501
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:25,896
and you just took those
olives and you plucked 'em

502
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:28,646
and you chopped them up into
a tapenade of reproach...

503
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:30,636
You know what, never mind. 
I don't care anymore.

504
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:32,404
Um, good-bye.

505
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:33,538
(exhales)

506
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,040
(quietly): Face your fears.

507
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,057
Hey, Josh, do you want to come to a party?

508
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,474
I'm throwing a...

509
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:49,232
party. You should come.

510
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:50,864
No way! That's awesome!

511
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,333
Yeah. See? This is

512
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,341
how a human being responds

513
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:57,224
to another human being's party invitation.

514
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,563
- You're not a human being.
- Oh, just throw a barb

515
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,298
at me and then go to the
stockroom. Real mature.

516
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,533
He's so immature. Sorry about that.

517
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,036
We have kind of a... like, a
Sam and Diane thing going on,

518
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,239
except it's, um, unpleasant and un-sexy.

519
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,407
Yeah, so it's just gonna be a...

520
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:12,410
housewarming shindig
with a-a gaggle of peeps.

521
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,679
And I thought that, you know,
Valencia would be cool with it

522
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,748
since we won't technically be alone.

523
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:18,783
- Right? 
- Huh.

524
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,284
So do you think you might make it?

525
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:21,486
Sure.

526
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:22,488
Oh, huzzah!

527
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,321
(chuckles)

528
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,689
I mean, that's super...

529
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,657
that's super cool, just
'cause, like, it's gonna be

530
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,493
really chill. Yeah.

531
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,027
Cool. And maybe you could bring, Yeah.

532
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,763
Uh, Hector and White Josh?

533
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:33,231
Oh, man. They're out of town.

534
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,666
Surf championship in Redondo.

535
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,069
But I'm sure you have other
people to invite, right?

536
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,415
Yeah. No, I'm-I'm inviting, like...

537
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:42,173
so many people.

538
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,241
So, um,

539
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,630
I will... I'll see you at my party?

540
00:20:46,655 --> 00:20:47,454
Sure.

541
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,678
Okay. Cool.

542
00:20:48,703 --> 00:20:50,469
Cool. I'll see you there.

543
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,074
Hi.

544
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:09,632
No solicitors.

545
00:21:09,657 --> 00:21:11,557
Oh, no, no. I live next-door, remember?

546
00:21:12,552 --> 00:21:14,071
Oh... yeah.

547
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,106
Yeah, it's me. You know,

548
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,607
I was going around, introducing myself,

549
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,975
handing out those croissants

550
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:18,843
that I made.

551
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:21,078
Yeah, I remember you. (sighs)

552
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,182
Look, just as a tip, we
don't... actually, like,

553
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:26,227
talk to each other around here.

554
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,787
That guy has lived next-door
to me for, like, 11 years,

555
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,823
and, like, I say “guy,” but honestly,

556
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:33,691
it could be, like...

557
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:36,667
- a stack of cats in a jumpsuit. 
- Okay.

558
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:37,995
Appreciate the info.

559
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,164
But... I like to consider
myself a bridge builder,

560
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,599
and I feel like you and I

561
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:42,800
could shake things up around here.

562
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,203
Yeah, no, I don't see that happening,

563
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:47,805
but anyways... nice to meet you,

564
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,507
stack of cats in a...

565
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:51,108
- shirt. 
- Wait, wait!

566
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,811
The reason I'm here is I want to
invite you to an awesome party.

567
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,514
<i>It's gonna be full-on.
It's gonna be full-on!</i>

568
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:57,915
And I really want you to be there,

569
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,016
'cause you're the coolest person

570
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,307
I think I've ever met.

571
00:22:00,434 --> 00:22:02,835
Um, so I would like you to come to it.

572
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:06,057
But I'm sensing the slightest
undercurrent of resistance,

573
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,493
- so now I'm kind of... 
- What time should I come over?

574
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,827
Wait. You want to come?

575
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:13,598
Not to party or anything, but just, like...

576
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,733
to watch you.

577
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:17,235
Okay.

578
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:19,570
I kind of think you're
fascinating, actually.

579
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:23,107
And I'm taking abnormal psych
at the JC, and I think...

580
00:22:23,294 --> 00:22:26,477
you would make, like, a really good paper.

581
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,692
Why, thank you, madam.

582
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:31,148
Yeah, see, like that.

583
00:22:31,411 --> 00:22:32,783
That would just...

584
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:37,021
be, like, an “A”
right there. Like, done.

585
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,523
♪ It's the sexy
getting-ready song... ♪

586
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,359
- Hi. 
- (singsongy): Look what I have!

587
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:42,638
Oh.

588
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:46,122
Isn't it amaz... ? It's like
a box of fantastic-ness.

589
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:50,568
Okay, so instead of having just one theme,

590
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,503
<i>we're having all of the themes.</i>

591
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:55,873
And we even have... a
Valentine's Day piñata.

592
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,543
Okay, you know what, yeah,
it's, like, hipster-y and ironic.

593
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,578
Like, I could see, like, a
BuzzFeed article about it.

594
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,812
Okay, cool. I'm down, I'm down.

595
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,080
Okay, let's go over the guest list.

596
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:05,283
So we got Josh, my super
cool neighbor Heather,

597
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:06,284
Darryl...

598
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:07,618
- No! 
- Uh, you know...

599
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,287
- Why do you hate me? 
- What can I do?

600
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:11,489
- Come on. He's sad. 
- All right. I know.

601
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,958
Um, Mrs. Hernandez was trending positive...

602
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,526
I can never tell with her.

603
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:16,928
And let's see. Oh, a lot of the people

604
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,963
I handed the flyer to didn't,
like, technically say yes,

605
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:21,286
but they gave me a look, 
like, “Oh, I'm there.”

606
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,035
(phone chimes)

607
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:22,800
Nice!

608
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,101
Yeah. Yeah. Good for you.

609
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,038
- Oh, no. 
- What?

610
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,205
What? Is it about the party?

611
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:29,607
Are people not coming? Is it Josh?

612
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,676
Is Josh not coming? Wait, why
does Josh have your number?

613
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:32,877
No, no, it's-it's Tommy, okay?

614
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,745
There's something going on at the school.

615
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,013
I have to run over...

616
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,181
What?! No, you can't... no,

617
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:38,649
you can't leave... The party's in an hour.

618
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:39,784
This was your idea.

619
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,352
What am I gonna do if
you're not here? I have

620
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:42,219
no one helping me. You can't leave

621
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,055
for some stupid child thing!

622
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:45,556
I'm sorry, that's really insensitive.

623
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:46,824
Look, the point is, I get it.

624
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:48,292
It's your child. But
please come back soon. Look,

625
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,161
I'm just gonna go, I'm gonna
take care of this hassle,

626
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:52,430
I'm gonna turn right back
around, okay? I promise

627
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:55,599
- I will be back soon. Boop. 
- Liar.

628
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:05,109
(quietly): You stole the test?

629
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,611
What? You wanted me to face my fears,

630
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,946
and I was afraid of getting
a bad grade on my test.

631
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,748
Why weren't you afraid of getting caught?

632
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,717
Well, I was, but thanks to you,

633
00:24:13,091 --> 00:24:14,452
I overcame that fear.

634
00:24:15,302 --> 00:24:16,895
- (door opens) 
- (exhales)

635

00:30:36,388 --> 00:30:37,888
(scoffs)

800
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,589
Is... that what you want?

801
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,772
Sweet. Let's do it.

802
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:44,563
All right, get over
here, guys. You, Dreads,

803
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:45,988
over here. You, Fun Guy,

804
00:30:46,123 --> 00:30:47,722
I need you over... yeah.

805
00:30:47,747 --> 00:30:49,514
You're gonna wear my shades. Awesome sauce.

806
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:51,272
You, Mr. Tall Man, you stand there.

807
00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:54,064
Okay, now the key to a good party selfie

808
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:57,157
<i>is attitude... what?! Yes!</i>

809
00:30:57,209 --> 00:30:58,608
Swag.

810
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,609
Ooh.

811
00:30:59,611 --> 00:31:01,111
Good.

812
00:31:01,113 --> 00:31:03,079
(laughs) That's good. Okay, and...

813
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:04,209
a killer smile.

814
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:07,161
Ready guys? (laughs)
That's good. Ok, come on...

815
00:31:07,186 --> 00:31:08,385
Say “selfie.”

816
00:31:08,387 --> 00:31:09,586
ALL: Selfie... !

817
00:31:09,588 --> 00:31:11,555
Ha!

818
00:31:11,557 --> 00:31:14,060
Ha-ha! Then we post this puppy online.

819
00:31:14,226 --> 00:31:17,233
And write: "This house

820
00:31:17,257 --> 00:31:20,073
is on fire!"

821
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:22,632
Exclam-Exclamation point. Ah... send!

822
00:31:22,634 --> 00:31:24,076
Then we see what happens. Huh.

823
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:25,567
(knocking on door)

824
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:30,340
Who's ready to party... ?!

825
00:31:30,342 --> 00:31:33,404
(shouts, cheers, whoops)

826
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:34,629
You got dice?

827
00:31:35,107 --> 00:31:37,709
I can find some! (whoops)

828
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,654
Oh, uh, this is Arielle

829
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:02,579
and Chuck.

830
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:05,438
And this guy!

831
00:32:05,463 --> 00:32:07,029
Hi. What-What's his name?

832
00:32:07,189 --> 00:32:09,056
I don't know, I just
call him “this guy”"

833
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:11,474
I've known him since kindergarten.

834
00:32:11,499 --> 00:32:13,851
Yeah, I'm just so bad in school.

835
00:32:14,007 --> 00:32:16,507
Dude, let me tell you something right now.

836
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:19,719
Being good at school means nothing.

837
00:32:20,035 --> 00:32:22,748
Like, see her?

838
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:26,076
Oh, do it, do it! You got it!

839
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:28,001
She went to Harvard.

840
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:29,914
Okay?

841
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:30,971
And she's a mess.

842
00:32:31,053 --> 00:32:32,162
Yeah. Dude,

843
00:32:32,187 --> 00:32:33,653
I was horrible at school,

844
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:36,957
but that's because instead
of reading their stupid books,

845
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:40,527
I was busy reading everything
Salinger ever wrote.

846
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:43,297
And you're, like, totally
successful and rich now, right?

847
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:46,600
Not at all.

848
00:32:46,602 --> 00:32:48,268
But I'm cool,

849
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,936
and that's what really matters.

850
00:32:49,938 --> 00:32:52,839
I like you. I like you so...

851
00:32:52,841 --> 00:32:54,107
I, can I... can I just,

852
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:55,542
just grab it? There you go. It's fine.

853
00:32:55,544 --> 00:32:58,278
It's my personal boundaries...

854
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,183
We're fine. I swallowed the barf!

855
00:33:03,185 --> 00:33:05,385
- Oh, she swallowed the barf! 
- I swallowed my barf!

856
00:33:05,387 --> 00:33:08,088
She swallowed the barf!

857
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,123
♪ ♪

858
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,928
Oh!

859
00:33:12,027 --> 00:33:13,359
Oh! Oh, my God.

860
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:15,595
You know, at first, I had
my doubts about this party.

861
00:33:15,597 --> 00:33:17,597
I mean, it's no Weekend Tuesday,
you know what I'm saying?

862
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,900
But now? I mean, this is a blast.

863
00:33:19,902 --> 00:33:21,835
Oh, and I even met this great girl Megan

864
00:33:21,837 --> 00:33:23,570
who said she found your flyer in a gutter.

865
00:33:23,572 --> 00:33:26,073
Oh, she's such a good listener.

866
00:33:26,075 --> 00:33:27,808
And I told her all about my divorce.

867
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,976
But I think she's from
England, because, I mean,

868
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:32,145
her teeth are not good. But she gave me

869
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:33,780
this terrific menthol cigarette.

870
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,460
(inhales) Mmm.

871
00:33:35,485 --> 00:33:36,984
Um...

872
00:33:37,803 --> 00:33:40,437
I think Megan might be a meth addict.

873
00:33:40,462 --> 00:33:43,396
Oh, yeah? I think you
maybe just smoked meth.

874
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,355
Oh. Okay. Well, you know, that'd explain

875
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,146
why I've been digging
a hole in the backyard

876
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:49,170
for the last hour.
(laughs) But it's still fun!

877
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,163
Hey, Megan, honey,

878
00:33:51,188 --> 00:33:53,014
let's clean something. (whoops)

879
00:33:57,576 --> 00:33:59,172
GREG: Wow.

880
00:33:59,174 --> 00:34:01,541
This party is a real who's-who of...

881
00:34:01,543 --> 00:34:03,477
who?

882
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:08,115
Well, if it isn't Mr. I
Can't Come to Your Party

883
00:34:08,117 --> 00:34:11,551
Because I Have a Bunch
of Complicated Reasons,

884
00:34:11,553 --> 00:34:14,354
I Probably Have to Buy More Black Clothing,

885
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:15,498
Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah.

886
00:34:15,523 --> 00:34:17,056
That's a long name I have. Polish?

887
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:19,126
All right.

888
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:21,092
Sincerely, thank you for coming.

889
00:34:21,117 --> 00:34:22,740
It means a lot to me that you're here.

890
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:24,165
Well, you took all my customers.

891
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,223
I usually get the gamblers
after their meeting.

892
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:27,447
Then I started thinking,

893
00:34:27,472 --> 00:34:29,005
“I've got to show up to this party to see

894
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,497
in what gruesome way it
could all go wrong.”

895
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,974
I figured at least a porch collapse.

896
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:35,553
But, now that I'm here...

897
00:34:36,445 --> 00:34:38,545
- It's not that bad. 
- Yeah,

898
00:34:38,547 --> 00:34:40,180
it's pretty great, right?

899
00:34:40,756 --> 00:34:43,201
And I have one person to thank for that.

900
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,592
Hey, girl.

901
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:54,561
I know that as a kid you never got to see

902
00:34:54,563 --> 00:34:56,530
that boy band concert
on pay-per-view.

903
00:34:56,532 --> 00:34:57,864
But it's okay.

904
00:34:57,866 --> 00:34:59,599
Because I'm here now.

905
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:02,169
And I'm all the boy band you'll ever need.

00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,241
- Great. 
- Yeah.

962
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:19,943
- Great. 
- So...

963
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:21,539
I should go.

964
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:23,674
Tommy just called us an Uber.

965
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:26,310
'Cause I am... wuz-asted.

966
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:28,980
Which is a word I just learned

967
00:37:28,982 --> 00:37:31,749
playing pai gow with a charming man

968
00:37:32,051 --> 00:37:33,417
from Azusa.

969
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:35,987
Boop. (laughs)

970
00:37:36,178 --> 00:37:38,389
You threw a great party.

971
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:41,492
No. We threw a great party.

972
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:43,094
(both grunt)

973
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:44,629
And you...

974
00:37:44,631 --> 00:37:47,053
You are a brave little cookie.

975
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:53,094
Okay. Come on. Show Mommy
where the front door is.

976
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:55,172
CLERK: Hey, so,

977
00:37:55,174 --> 00:37:56,874
thanks for the party. Real fun.

978
00:37:56,876 --> 00:38:00,154
And I'll see you at the store, Betsy.

979
00:38:00,452 --> 00:38:01,905
Actually, my name is Rebecca.

980
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,463
Don't care.

981
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:08,529
Hey, um...

982
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:10,388
I saw that you got

983
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,789
a text from Valencia earlier.

984
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,591
I hope I'm not causing any problems.

985
00:38:13,593 --> 00:38:15,092
No, no, no, no. I realized,

986
00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:17,361
you know, I-I shouldn't
have listened to her.

987
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:19,797
I shouldn't be afraid
of my girlfriend, right?

988
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:20,831
So I told her,

989
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,671
“I'll-I'll come home when I want to.”

990
00:38:23,878 --> 00:38:25,952
Actually, it was a little scary.

991
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:30,307
Yeah. Actually, you know,
I-I faced a fear earlier

992
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,777
and turned out pretty okay.

993
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:35,146
You know, from now on,
uh, since we're friends,

994
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:37,148
we should just, you know, hang out

995
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,749
whenever we want to, don't you think?

996
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:41,218
Yeah. That...

997
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,754
I mean, yeah. Let's do it.

998
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:46,757
- The world be damned. 
- All right, yeah.

999
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:48,726
Wha... It's just...

1000
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:51,595
- Well, I got to go. 
- Yeah, yeah,

1001
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:52,663
let's get you out of here. I'll-I'll...

1002
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:54,565
don't worry about that.

1003
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:56,801
Oh. It was a great party.

1004
00:38:56,803 --> 00:38:59,236
Thanks. Thank you.

1005
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:01,872
- This house was on fire! 
- Oh!

1006
00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:04,141
- (laughs) Yeah! 
- Oh, I get it. Oh.

1007
00:39:07,113 --> 00:39:08,436
Later.

1008
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:10,317
Later.

1009
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:12,783
Sooner rather than... (laughs)

1010
00:39:16,118 --> 00:39:17,817
(door closes) Uh, hi.

1011
00:39:18,296 --> 00:39:19,575
I didn't know you were still here.

1012
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,125
I thought you already left.

1013
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:23,882
(chuckles) Oh, I don't leave
when there's whiskey left.

1014
00:39:24,087 --> 00:39:25,353
Oh.

1015
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:26,810
Hey, you know what?

1016
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:27,801
Take it home.

1017
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:29,300
That's my gift to you.

1018
00:39:29,302 --> 00:39:30,968
Thank you.

1019
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,303
You know, I get it now.

1020
00:39:32,305 --> 00:39:33,604
What do you get?

1021
00:39:33,606 --> 00:39:35,406
How you feel about Josh.

1022
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:37,108
I saw it on your face.

1023
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,610
It was weird and sad and...

1024
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:42,012
also kind of beautiful

1025
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:44,897
in a pure and un-ironic way.

1026
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:48,203
I don't know what you're talking about.

1027
00:39:48,228 --> 00:39:49,728
Josh and I are just friends.

1028
00:39:49,753 --> 00:39:51,519
You guys are just friends.

1029
00:39:51,544 --> 00:39:53,310
We guys are just friends.

1030
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:55,025
Everyone guys are just friends.

1031
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:56,894
Okay, okay.

1032
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:58,022
- Drunkie. 
- Drunkie.

1033
00:39:58,047 --> 00:40:00,314
Let's call you... whoa!

1034
00:40:00,477 --> 00:40:03,311
Let's get a ride-sharing service, right?

1035
00:40:03,336 --> 00:40:05,770
You know, you're really
starting to fit in here.

1036
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:07,004
Thank you.

1037
00:40:07,006 --> 00:40:09,140
That's not a compliment.

1038
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:14,046
I can't do this.

1039
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:16,705
Yes, you can. And I'll
be right here, I promise.

1040
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,830
What if I forget all the
stuff I'm supposed to say?

1041
00:40:26,053 --> 00:40:27,892
You are not kicking Tommy out.

1042
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:29,593
I know what my rights are.

1043
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:31,629
'Cause I looked 'em up.

1044
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:35,699
And there is a statute and it is called...

1045
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:39,103
the fair access rule.

1046
00:40:39,335 --> 00:40:42,499
And if you expel Tommy, then you are...

1047
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:44,475
liable for a

1048
00:40:44,477 --> 00:40:48,312
$26,000-per year stipend

1049
00:40:48,314 --> 00:40:51,866
for... special education.

1050
00:40:52,678 --> 00:40:56,053
If you drop the transfer hearing,

1051
00:40:56,055 --> 00:40:59,343
then... I will let you off the hook.

1052
00:41:00,014 --> 00:41:01,392
See,

1053
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,468
this is your problem:

1054
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:08,241
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

1055
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:10,835
(laughs)

1056
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:13,737
That is right.

1057
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:16,073
(knocks)

1058
00:41:19,245 --> 00:41:20,678
<i>YOUNG REBECCA: That went well.</i>

1059
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,880
Much better than I thought.

1060
00:41:23,124 --> 00:41:25,655
So tell me some other
stuff about my future.

1061
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,748
Okay, so you're gonna
go to Harvard and Yale.

1062
00:41:28,773 --> 00:41:32,174
Yeah, yeah, so when exactly
do I get those boobs?

1063
00:41:32,686 --> 00:41:35,626
Oh. Um, I think age 14?

1064
00:41:35,628 --> 00:41:36,858
I see.

1065
00:41:37,218 --> 00:41:39,351
So, at Yale, you're
gonna be editor in chief

1066
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:40,542
of the law journal.

1067
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:43,067
Sounds great. Back to
the boobs for a second,

1068
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:44,101
when you say 14,

1069
00:41:44,103 --> 00:41:46,837
are we talking by my birthday party?

1070
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,040
Are we talking swimsuit season?

1071
00:41:50,171 --> 00:41:51,775
Also, do they float?

1072
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:53,663
Yeah.

1073
00:41:53,688 --> 00:41:57,343
Nice! Girl with Mustache
owes me ten dollars.

1074
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:01,026
