00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,607
      Well, it looks like
       you've totaled my
      Other-Dimensionator.

243
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:45,477
   An Other-Dimensionator?
   What does it do?

244
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,780
      Well, at the moment,
      it just stops giant
      shuttlecocks, apparently.

245
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,683
          But it's supposed
          to let me go into
          other dimensions.

246
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,351
 That's cool!
 We can help you fix it.

247
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:56,454
        I'm Phineas,
       and this is my
       brother Ferb.

248
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,591
   I'm Dr. Heinz
   Doofenshmirtz,
   but my friends call me...
   (SIGHS)

249
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,795
   I just got in such a funk.

250
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:06,698
  Ferb is naturally
  handy with tools.

251
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,932
 I bet we could
 put this thing back
 together in no time.

252
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,702
               What the heck.
               Before we start,

253
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:13,121
 there's a whole
 buffet set up here,
 please partake.

254
00:11:13,122 --> 00:11:15,539
    I was expecting someone
    who seems to be running
    late.

255
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,508
     You're lucky I got
    a rocket car winch.

256
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,677
    Lots of guys
    don't have that.

257
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,380
     PHINEAS: Almost there.

258
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,583
   Okay,
   field compressor attaches
   to the auxiliary
   generator.

259
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,819
    Was this working before?

260
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,722
     Well, if by "working"
     you mean "functioning
     properly," then no.

261
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,541
      Well, I think
      I see your problem.

262
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,359
   Everything's wired through
   this self-destruct button.

263
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,827
          Do you even need that?

264
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,196
      Well, of course I...

265
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,232
    Wait a minute.
    No, I do not need that.

266
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,435
   You are absolutely right.

267
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:45,704
          So Ferb has rigged up
          this remote control

268
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,439
 so that if we get
 separated from the portal,
 we can open another one.

269
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:48,606
                Nice touch, kid.

270
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,809
 I guess this is
 the last piece.

271
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,510
        Okay, Ferb,
        boost me up.

272
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:56,581
 Ooh, I cannot wait!

273

274
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,289
         PHINEAS:
         There you are, Perry.
      Perry?

275
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,691
      Yeah. He's our
      pet platypus.

276
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:07,492
       Is every platypus
       named Perry?

277
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,361
    In a perfect world, yes.

278
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,763
    Well, he's a cute
    little fellow.

279
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,465
         Hi, there.
    Coochee, coochee...
        Ow! Ow! Ow!

280
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,734
             Perry, no!
             We do not bite
             the elderly.

281
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,836
      Again, ow!
      It's okay.

282
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,604
 Platypuses don't
 typically like me.

283
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,371
    Well, Perry, you're just
    in time to see us open
    a window

284
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:24,342
    into another dimension.

285
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,010
      Perry, no!
      What are you doing?

286
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,746
                   No, no!

287
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,381
  Perry, this is not
  tug of war!

288
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,283
      This is not
      tug of war!

289
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,486
 Silly boy,
 what's gotten into him?

290
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:35,687
         All right,
         let's get this show
         on the road, huh?

291
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,456
 <i> Remember,</i>
 <i> if your cover is blown,</i>

292

293
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,393

 <i> Never see them again.</i>

295
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:48,700
 Okay, here we go.
 Right in...

296
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,904
    Perry! No!
    Not on the sofa!

297
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:56,541
 I'm sorry, Dr. D.
 We should take him out.

298
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,560
 No, no. Wait.
 It'll be all right.

299
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:00,578
 I was planning on
 replacing this
 old couch anyway.

300
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,480
    Now come on.
    Let's light
    this pop stand,

301
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:02,680
 or however it goes.

302
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,554
            Gosh, this is...
            It's kind of
            weird, actually.

303
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,923
         I'm usually thwarted
         by this point.

304
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,825
            Well, I guess
            he's not coming.

305
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,995
        And now, behold!

306
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:21,699
 The mind-blowing

00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,942
                   Hmm.

308
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:33,878
              It's a...
              It's a couch.

309
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,880
  That's a bit
  anticlimactic.

310
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:39,784
 I guess it's a nice couch,
 though...

311
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,921
  Hey! I got an idea!
  Let's swap my couch
  for that one!

312
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,174
                  Um...

313
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:48,025
 I got it. I got...
 Or maybe I...

314
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,028
            Come on, you want to
            give me a hand here?

315
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,396
  Whoa! Awesome,

00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:06,117
      Curse you,
      Perry the Platypus!

490
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,018
        Jinx! You owe me a soda.

491
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:11,489
         <i> Get me! I'm a Georgia</i>
         <i> O'Keeffe painting!</i>

492
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:15,292
                Fourth and Main.

493
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:21,165
                 What? No tip?

494
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,967
          Never mind. I'm good.

495
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,648
            Looks like
            they're gone.

496
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,451
         You're a secret agent?

497
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:42,186
             And you've been
              living with us
             this whole time?

498
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:43,687
        Was that evil guy right?

499
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,523
          Were we just
          a cover story to you?

500
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:47,925
          I mean, were you ever
              really our pet
          or part of our family?

501
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,995
   Well, apparently not,
   'cause you didn't trust us
   enough to tell us.

502
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:53,931
     Anyone else
     around here leading
     a bizarre double life?

503
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,667
   Put your hand down, Ferb.

504
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,338
     You're a secret agent!
     He's a secret agent!

505
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,643
      You're right, Ferb.
    We've got to concentrate
      on the task at hand.

506
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:08,379
   We've got to get back
   to our dimension,

507
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:10,114
   and I don't even know
   where to start!

508
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,116
     That's right!
     The remote!

509
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,384
   I knew that would
   come in handy.

510
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:14,385
         All right,
         let's go home.

511
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,522
               Wait, that's not
               our dimension.

512
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,224
              Nope. Uh-uh.

513
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,164
    Now this thing's broken.
    We're gonna need some
    help.

514
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,500
     I know!
     Let's go find us!

515
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:35,673
  Wait, I just realized,

516
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:39,376
 you could have been
 cleaning your own
 litter box this whole
 time!

517
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:43,714
 We are not done
 with this conversation.

518
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:47,017
          So tell me,
          other dimension me,
          what do you see here?

519
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,419
 An ordinary platypus.

520
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:50,120
             And now
             what do you see?

521
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:51,722
  Perry the Platypus!

522
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,390
            You know,
            I'm starting to see

523
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,759
            why you haven't
            become ruler
            in your dimension.

524
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:58,429
 All right,
 Mr. Eviler-Than-Thou,

525
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,098
 just how did you
 manage to take over
 the tri-state area anyway?

526
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,635
             Simple, I used
            an army of big,
             scary robots.

527
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:07,071
      NORMBOTS: <i> We should</i>
      <i> do lunch sometime.</i>

528
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,507
   Wow, that is scary.

529
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,408
  I tried that
  robot thing once, too.

530
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,177
    I hid the self-destruct
    button
    on the bottoms of their
    feet

531
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,145
 <i> so no one</i>
 <i> could reach them.</i>

532
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:19,984
                  And march!

533
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,185
 I think I've said enough.
 I still don't get it.

534
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,522
 If we're the same person,
 why are you so much better
 at being evil than me?

535
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:28,559
     True evil is born
     through pain and loss.

536
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:31,762
         You see,
         when I was a small boy
         back in Gimelschtump,

537
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:34,598
              I had a toy train.

538
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,166
       <i> Then, one day I lost it.</i>

539
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,434
        Choo-Choo?

540
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:43,741
  That's... That's it?
            What do you mean?

541
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,643
  That's your emotionally
  scarring back-story?

542
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:47,611
       That's your
       great tragedy?

543
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:50,347
       Dude! I was
       raised by ocelots.
       I mean, literally.

544
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,716
   Disowned by my parents
   and raised by
   Central American wildcats,

545
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:55,085
     and you're telling me
     you lost a toy train?
     That's all?

546
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,288
 That's all you got,
       really?

547
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,756
        I had to work
        as a lawn gnome!

548
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,357
      <i> I was forced to wear</i>
      <i> hand-me-up girl's</i>
      <i> clothing!</i>

549
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:03,694
    <i> Neither of my parents</i>
    <i> showed up for my birth!</i>

550
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:06,196
             Well, how did you
             feel when you lost
             that toy train?

551
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:07,831
     I never lost
     that toy train...

552
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,234
        Well, maybe if you had,
        you'd have done better.

553
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:13,504
       Since you have neglected
       to take over your
       tri-state area,

554
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:16,707
   I think I'll go over there
   and give it a shot myself!

555
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,209
  Great!
  We can be a team!

556
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,679
            Yeah, right. A team.

557
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:23,080
 Wait, was that sarcasm?

558
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,715
                      No!

559
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,349
 Yeah! Right there!
 I'm pretty sure
 that's my voice

560
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,118
 when I'm being sarcastic.

561
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,686
          Okay, Buford,
          where are
          Phineas and Ferb?

562
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:30,821
              How should I know?

563
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,690
        They never showed up
        for me to return serve!

564
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:35,392
     That's considered a
     forfeit
     in catapult badminton.

565
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,127
        So I went to get
       some Victory Gum.

566
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,562
        CHORUS:
        <i> ♪ Victory Gum! ♪</i>

567
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:41,131
             A tradition as old
            as the game itself.

568
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,399
 Don't play with me,
 young man.

569
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,435
 Where is the giant
 platypult they built?

570
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,370
        I don't know.
        Seems to have vanished.

571
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,472
              Really? Did you
              hear that, Stacy?

572
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,541
        The mysterious force
        took the platypult away

573
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:52,743
        before I, the grown-up,
        could see it.

574
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:56,246
 Yeah, yeah. I'm sure
 there's a perfectly
 logical
 explanation for all of

575
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:59,316
        And they laughed at me
        for installing
        a platypult tow rig!

576
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:00,751
   Who's laughing now, Wayne?

577
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:04,755
        The logical explanation
        is the mysterious force.

578
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:06,523
          The real question is,

579
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:08,792
       why does it care so much
      about my little brothers?

580
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,495
         Why doesn't it want
         them to get busted?

581
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,197
            Well, why don't you
            ask it, Kierkegaard?

582
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,567
           What? Existentialist
           trading cards.

583
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,619
        They came with the gum.

584
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,670
        Wait, he's right!
        I should just ask it!

585
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:22,773
             I'll bet I can
             reason with it.
   Reason with it?

586
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:26,276
 Candace, it's a force
 that you made up.

587
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,345
          No, I know what I'm
          talking about, Stacy!

588
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,780
 Come on!
     STACY: Where are you
            going?

589
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:33,751
  To my back yard!
  The heart of the
 mysterious force!

590
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:36,153
 Would you like to
  trade two Sartre
  for a Nietzsche?

591
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,521
                 All right.

592
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,689
    Sucker!

593
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:46,296
           Well, this should be
           our street.

594
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,331
               But it sure
               looks different.

595
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,504
                      Dad?

596
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,222
       Boys, what are you
       doing here?

597
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:56,939
        You'd better get inside
        before the Doofbot
        catches you.

598
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:59,410
        I'm off to the factory.
        See you next week.

599
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,946
 Wow! Well, I guess
 we'd better get inside.

600
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:09,353
            You might want to...

601
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,256
         I mean, these guys
         might not know that
         you're not really a...

602
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:13,424
                  You know.

603
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,727
    (CHATTERING)

604
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:28,405
      Boys! I thought you
      were in your room.
      Get inside!

605
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,607
 And get your dooferalls
 back on before someone
 sees you.

606
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:33,577
  If you need me,
   I'll be hiding
  in the basement.

607
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,245
                That was weird.
                Let's find
                the other us's.

608
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,451
        And... Hey, I got a one!

609
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:42,553
        Pick a Doofopoly
       instruction card!

610
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,555
         "Conform."
         I can do that.

611
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,989
           Hi, guys.

  replacing us!

613

  Phineas,
  he's not your Perry.
  He came with us.

620
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,875
                  Oh. Sorry.

621
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:07,544
           Wait, can I hold him
           a little longer?

622
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:14,785
          It's just that,
          well, he left one day
          and never came back.

623
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:17,254
        He's been gone

        and I'm really worried.

              you in this room?

    Great, now I need
    those two boys?

730
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:34,237
    Ah! Perry the Platypus!

731
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,841
          Jinx!
          You owe me two sodas!

732
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:39,709
 Listen, Perry the
 Platypus,
 I know I told you

733
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,812
   if you turned yourself in
   I wouldn't hurt your
   friends,

734
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:43,847
  but change of plans!

735
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,683
 Now I need to hunt
 them down which might
 involve a little hurting.

736
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,653
 I know that makes me
 a liar, but hello! Evil!

737
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,657
            Come on,
            Isabella's house
            is right through...

738
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:01,331
           What you doing?

739
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,367
        Isabella?

740
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:07,337
        Do I know you?
            Hey, Isabella!

741
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,906
      Him I know.
      Buford, what do you want?

742
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,708
             I thought you were
             resisting us?

743
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,610
          I was helping
          Candace's brothers
          cross the street.

744
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,979
      Candace has two sets
      of twin brothers?

745
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,748
  No, he and I are
  from another dimension.

746
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,050
       We're trying
       to get back.

747
00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:21,184
            All right, girls,
            release them.

748
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:28,792
   Why would you want to come
   to this dimension, anyway?

749
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,660
           Well, we didn't mean
           to come here.

750
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,230
          Now we can't get back
          unless we can fix
          this device.

751
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,799
         Well, we may have
         someone who can
         help you. Dr. Baljeet.

752
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:36,867
            Baljeet!

753
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:39,136
   That's Dr. Baljeet to you!

754
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:41,304
       Were you not listening?
       Here is the crux
       of your problem.

755
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,307
  Think of the universe
  and all of the many
  dimensions as circular.

756
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,676
         The energy flows
         between the dimensions
         like this, clockwise.

757
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:51,081
   Say this is your dimension
   and this is our dimension.

758
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,949
           You traveled with
           the flow of energy.

759
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,885
       So going clockwise
       would be easy!

760
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:58,155
    Going counter clockwise
    would take 8 million
    gigawatts of energy,

761
00:35:58,157 --> 00:36:00,790
     overloading
     the local power grid.

762
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,692
     I have prepared
     a little song to help
     illustrate my point.

768
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,625
          Anyway, without the
          8 million gigawatts,

769
00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:20,876
         you would have
         to go clockwise,

773
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,552
      to open the window
      backwards
      so we can get home?

774
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,320
       Well, we should probably
       ask our leader.

778
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,395

   of the resistance?

              What are you two
              (IN NORMAL VOICE)
              doing here?

781
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:46,169

      I'll deal with you later.
      You two,

782
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,772

       to keep my brothers safe

783
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:51,241
    and suddenly their faces
              are
      all over the Doofen
            Channel.

784
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:52,409

           Baljeet.

787
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,415
           We need to generate
           8 million gigawatts

788
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,006

00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:16,920
   Candace, I'm sure you have
   a million questions,

851
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:18,455
       but right now we have
       to save Perry from being
       turned into a cyborg.

852
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:19,923
            What?
      We'll explain on the way.

853
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:21,291
       So, how do I dress
       in your dimension?

854
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:24,027
        Hey, is that me?
        I look good!

855
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,862
            Oh, no.
            You two stay here.

856
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,497
    But we want to help.
              That's an order!

857
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:35,405
 CANDACE: Wait,
 so in this dimension,
 Perry is a secret agent?

858
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:37,507
         No, in this dimension
         he's a cyborg.

859
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:39,309
 So, where is he an agent?

860
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:41,077
           That would be
           in our dimension.

861
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,278
           But we're not in
           our dimension now.

862
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,482
 Okay, I'm having trouble
 processing this.

863
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:47,150
           Now I wish
           I hadn't thrown away
           that pamphlet.

864
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,203
         And why are we
         in mine cars?

865
00:39:50,204 --> 00:39:52,121
     This'll take us as far
     as the underground
     entrance

866
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:53,724
    to Doof's headquarters.

867
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,325
         From there we go up
         the ventilation shaft.

868
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:57,227
          The detainment center
          is on level four.

869
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,661
 And the snack bar's
 on level five!

870
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,597
  If there's time.

871
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,166
                  Buford.

872
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:04,667
  I'm just gonna
  get some nachos.

873
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,245
 So, if there's another me
 and another them,

874
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:18,581
 then there must also be
 a Jeremy Johnson here,
 too, right?

875
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,984
        Huh? Oh, yeah,
        Johnson, Jeremy.

876
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,420
       Leads a three-man strike
       team on the north side.
       Good soldier.

877
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:26,273
         Good soldier?
         That's all you
         think of him?

878
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:29,125
      Don't you think
      he's dreamy or cool
      or even cute?

879
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,393
     Tell me at least
     you think he's cute.

880
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,496
        Cute doesn't win
        the war, kid.

881
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:37,066
  Oh. Well, I guess.

882
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,969
 But what do you guys
 do around here for,
 you know, fun?

883
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,671
          Look, "Candace" is it?

884
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:44,474
   No offense, but fun
   isn't really on my agenda.

885
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:46,576
        You know, since
         Doofenshmirtz
    took over the tri-state
             area,

886
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,578
           even though
           I was a little girl,

887
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,146
           I've been focused
           on one thing
           and one thing only.

888
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,948
            He's going down,
            down, down.

889
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,316
 Down, down, down, I know.

890
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,118
    But what about BFF's?
    Or slumber parties?

891
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,719
  Or busting your
  little brothers?

892
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,422
      Busting my brothers?

893
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:02,125
      I spent every day
      of my life trying to
      protect my little
      brothers.

894
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,460
       I had to grow up
       pretty quick around here

895
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,094
           to make sure
           they didn't have to.

896
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:07,397
 Gee, you make growing up
 sound like it's a bad
 thing.

897
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:11,000
   It is what it is.
   I'll do whatever it takes
   to protect the ones I
   love.

898
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,535
        Aw! Thanks, sis!

899
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,037
       What are you guys
       doing here?

900
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,538
 We're here to help.
           Sir, we're nearing
           the target!

901
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,707
                 Don't move!

902
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:25,748
            Okay, people,
            change of plans.

903
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,450
        This is as far as we go.

904
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,151
      We're not going
      to help them?

905
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,238
            No, we're gonna
            get you two home
            where it's safe.

906
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,323
    But we wanna...
     Look, this isn't our
            fight.

907
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:37,994
          It's their fight,
          and you two shouldn't
          have gotten involved.

908
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,095
    Maybe none of us should
    have.
    Now we're out of here.

909
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,368
      I don't remember it being
      so dark down here.

910
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,170
             Dark?
     That's because it's a
             trap!

911
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,706
           And if it was light,
              you would have
          seen us and run away,

912
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:52,075
        hence ruining the trap!

913
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:53,376
  I think they get that.

914
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:55,378
        PHINEAS: Perry!

915
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,581
      We, uh... We, well,
      came to rescue you.

916
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:08,057
    So far it's not going
    as well as we'd hoped.

917
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,226
       We didn't have
       a lot of time to,

918
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:11,761
      you know, plan
      something elaborate,

919
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,163
     but I guess
     we could have created
     some sort of diversion

920
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,032
        just in case...

921
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:19,068
     (SIGHS)
     Yeah, we could have
     thought this out more.

922
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:23,239
           (LAUGHS) I got you
           and I got your
           little friends, too!

923
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:26,509
           Game over! You lose!
           I win!

924
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:29,746
             Mark this the hour
               of your doom,
            Perry the Platypus.

925
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:32,715
                 Three forty...

926
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,218
         I got one of these
         watches with just
         the little hash marks.

927
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,220
           It doesn't even have
           the numbers on it.

928
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,155
                 Let's just say
                 it's between
                 3:30 and 4:00,

929
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:39,455
          Eastern Standard Time.

930
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:44,160
             Whoa!
                  (SCREAMS)

931
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:51,134
         <i> I told you,</i>
         <i> not between</i>
         <i> 3:30 and 4:00!</i>

932
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:56,956
     They're getting away!

933
00:42:56,957 --> 00:42:58,540
        (ALARM BLARING)

934
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,543
     I knew this was
     a bad idea. All right,
     everyone in the cars!

935
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:05,114
   Go, go, go, go, go!
   Isabella, start the motor!

936
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:07,183
                      Yes, sir.

937
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,187
                 I got it.

938
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,126
      You two,
      keep your heads down
      and remember your
      training!

939
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:18,394
        We never had
       any training!

940
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:19,661
            Well, keep your
            heads down!

941
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:21,464
  Consider yourself trained.
  This is going to be close.

942
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:26,669
            All right,
            you rust buckets.
            Let's dance.

943
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:36,579
  Um, can you do that?

944
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:37,380
       Well, apparently.

945
00:43:43,555 --> 00:43:46,489
 I am so in love
 with her right now.

946
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:48,224
                   What?
      Nothing.

947
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:50,159
         If we can get
         to the north tunnel
         before they get to us,

948
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:51,895
             I can trip
             the security door.

949
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:53,630
         Isabella, can you
         give us more throttle?

950
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:55,498
 It's all the way in, sir!

951
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,401
     All right, hang tough.
     This is going to get
     hairy.

952
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:05,908
 Can we make those turns
 at this speed?

953
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:06,409
    Well, we're about
    to find out.

954
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,359
 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

955
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:29,532
       There it is.
       We should be okay
       if we can hold off
       these...

956
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:38,074
            Can we do that?

957
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,408
  No. Keep your head down.

958
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:51,688
  We're slowing down, sir!

959
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,889
        Keep it on the floor!

960
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:55,425
  It's on the floor.

961
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:57,927
 There's too much track,
 sir.
 I don't think we're going
 to make it!

962
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,529
       Everyone,
       to the front now!

963
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:00,697
 We're going to have
 to cut loose these...

964
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:04,300
        The motor's overheating!

965
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,974
      Sorry, guys.
      You're on your own.

966
00:45:16,648 --> 00:45:18,247
      PHINEAS 2D:
      What are you doing?

967
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:20,483
            My job.
            Protecting you two.

968
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:22,785
      We've got to go back
      and help them.

969
00:45:22,787 --> 00:45:24,253
        That's not our fight.

970
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:25,621
           But you just
           abandoned them!

971
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:27,457
 We could have made it!
 We could have all made it!

972
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:29,025
           Or we could have
           all been captured,

973
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,592
           and I wasn't going
           to take that chance.

974
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:32,595
   These are
   the tough choices, people.

975
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:33,930
           Somebody's got to
           be the adult here.

976
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:35,832
            You two are safe,
            and that's what's
            important.

977
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:36,466
     But... But... But...
      End of discussion.

978
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:50,747
    Man, I had my heart set
    on those nachos.

979
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:52,749
 Look, mysterious force,

980
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,750
 I feel a little awkward
 talking to you

981
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:58,921
   since I didn't believe
  in you at first because,
   you know, it's crazy.

982
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,691
             But then I saw you
             eat my friend,

983
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:05,495
          so I've made
          a little shrine here.

984
00:46:05,497 --> 00:46:09,732
 It's nice.
 There's a banana and...
 Oh! Mr. Miggins.

985
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:13,770
 So I hope
 this makes up for the
 whole disbelief thing.

986
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,306
         Are we, uh...
          Are we good?

987
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:24,380
  Now you have no choice
  but to fix my machine.

988
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:25,681
            No.
 That's not one
 of your choices.

989
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:26,983
 Fix the machine!
            No.

990
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:29,519
      Can I...
      Can I say something?

991
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:31,888
   So, I think I'm up-to-date
               on
     the whole Perry Agent
             thing.

992
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,390
       Strangely, that's the
       most normal thing that's
       happened this afternoon,

993
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:37,393
        but who exactly
        is this guy?

994
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,429
       Fix it!
             No.

995
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:43,599
      Look, I would make myself
      do it but apparently
      he's an idiot.

996
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:45,401
     Hey!
     Fix the machine!

997
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:47,053
                    No.

998
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,704
 All right, then,
 you've forced my hand.

999
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:53,009
     Fix the machine!

1000
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:54,744
                  No.
       Really?

1001
00:46:54,746 --> 00:46:56,712
 When I was your age,
 I did anything
 a puppet told me to do.

1002
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:58,047
           How old do you think
           we are?

1003
00:46:58,049 --> 00:46:59,949
    I don't know.
    One, two?

1004
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:02,201
 You know,
 it's hard to tell
 with the one eye.

1005
00:47:02,202 --> 00:47:04,452
 Anyway, I don't know
 why you're being
 so uncooperative.

1006
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:06,889
  All I'm asking you to do
  is make my machine work

1007
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:10,059
 so I can invade
 and conquer your world
 and enslave your loved
 ones.

1008
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:12,361
            See, that's just it.

1009
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:14,397
      Why would we do something
      that would lead to our
      own self-destruction?

1010
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:16,399
              Self-destruction?
              Self-destruct...
              Wait a...

1011
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:18,151
                Wait, that's it.
                I remember now.

1012
00:47:18,152 --> 00:47:19,902
          They took out my
          self-destruct button.

1013
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:22,104
           I don't know why
           I put it back in,
           but here.

1014
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:25,374
         I'll just rewire this,
         like so, and there.

1015
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:31,080
      It's working! It's
           working!
  It's functioning properly!

1016
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:34,083
 Well, look who just
 became redundant.

1017
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,686
      Send them
      to their doom!

1018
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:38,454
       Yes, her, too.

1019
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:42,024
      Yes, yes, everyone.

1020
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,093
       Doom, doom,
       doom and doom.
          Doom!

1021
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:45,928
 Jinx!
 You owe me three sodas.

1022
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,129
        Okay, doom for him, too.

1023
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:50,066
  What? But I'm you!

1024
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,068
                       Doom!

1025
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:55,071
 Wow, if I had
 a nickel for every time
 I was doomed by a puppet,

1026
00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:57,073
 I'd have two nickels.

1027
00:47:57,075 --> 00:47:59,141
 Which isn't a lot.
 But it's weird that
 it happened twice, right?

1030

 adulthood gets about
 a three.

1031
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,568
        You know,
        this may be as
        good as it gets.

 a secret agent, huh?

       Yeah, but it was obvious

        I never lost it.

     a little more time

 extra cool!

 Thanks so much, guys.

1419

        we could help.

 Man, this has been
 the greatest day ever.

1421
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:31,305
  Imagine how much fun
  we can have together

1422
01:13:31,307 --> 01:13:33,174
 now that we know
 you're a secret agent.

1423
01:13:33,176 --> 01:13:36,644
         Yes, yes,
         the next 15 minutes
         should be a real hoot.

1424

         Well, then, of course,
         Agent P will be
         sent away forever.

          What?
          You didn't know?

1426
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,583
          Didn't he give you
          a pamphlet?
     We threw it away.

1427
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:45,219
          Does anyone
          read those things?

         Kids, I'm sorry
         but now that Agent P's
         cover has been blown,

1430
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,126
            you won't be allowed
            to see him anymore.

1431
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:55,029
  That's why
  you didn't want us
  to know your secret.

1432
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:56,697
  So we'll never see
  Perry again?

1433
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:58,266
   There has to be
   another way.

1435

  so much that I could
   unknow something.

1436
01:14:04,174 --> 01:14:05,640
   Sir, maybe
   there is a way.

1437
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:08,643
 What about
 Dr. Doofenshmirtz's
 Amnesianator?

1438
01:14:08,645 --> 01:14:11,412
        I never built
        an Amnesianator.

1439
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:14,048
      I think I'd remember
      building something
      like that.

1440
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:16,683
     Well, that might work.
     But you'd all have to
     agree.

1441
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:20,455
  So our choice is to either
  forget the best day ever,

1442
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:22,557
 forget the biggest
 adventure
 we've ever had,

1443
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:24,425
   and forget
   meeting Agent P,

1444
01:14:24,427 --> 01:14:27,295
 or remember today,
 but never see Perry again?

1445
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:30,164
           Well, we've had
           a lot of great days.

1446
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:32,733
               But we only have
               one Perry.

1447
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:34,068
        Agreed.

1448
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,736
           ALL: Yeah!

1451
01:14:39,576 --> 01:14:41,676
                 and we'll be
                 ready to roll.

1452
01:14:41,678 --> 01:14:43,578
     Hey, buddy, Ferb and I
     just wanted to say
     our goodbyes.

1453
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:46,414
      You know, we thought
      we'd finally met
      the real you

1454
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:48,983
       when we found out
       you were Agent P,

1455
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:51,551
   but the fact is,
   pet, secret agent,
   they're both the real you.

1456
01:14:51,554 --> 01:14:53,988
        You are now and
        always have been

1457
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,624
      a great pet
      and a great friend.

1458
01:14:56,626 --> 01:14:59,060
 We're gonna
 miss you, Agent P.

1459
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,696
     I love you, pal.

1460
01:15:01,698 --> 01:15:03,464
  Sir, are you crying?

1461
01:15:03,466 --> 01:15:04,532
               No, I'm sweating
