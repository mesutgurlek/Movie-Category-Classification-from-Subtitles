1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,690
in about an hour from now

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,990
there's gonna
be an earthquake.

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,790
<i>previously on "eli stone"...</i>

4
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,370
oh my god!

5
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,200
it's like i see things now

6
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,650
things that were always there

7
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,180
but that i just never noticed before

8
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,140
your dad told me
that i would make good

9
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,900
on my debt to him one day.

10
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,190
i didn't know what
your dad meant.

11
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,290
i recommend that patients should
get their affairs in order.

12
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,310
i should draft a will?

13
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,190
before i go in
for my surgery...

14
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,200
you want us to witness
your suicide note?

15
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,240
it's a statement about
how and under what

16
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,090
circumstances i
don't wanna live.

17
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,900
c.b.p.   holding.

18
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,450
b.p. 100 over 70.

19
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,020
2 liters standing by.

20
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:37,940
that's good.

21
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,430
the graft is secure.

22
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,500
i'm preparing to
tie off the aneurysm.

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,270
oxygen--head is
good.respiration's normal.

24
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,110
pulse is dropping.

25
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,810
damn it.it ruptured.

26
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,750
he's hemorrhaging.

27
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,330
he's in defib.

28
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,990
reclip proximally.

29
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,490
-quickly,people,now! 
-pressure's dropping.

30
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,900
let's run in 
some more volume.

31
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,790
more suction.

32
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,200
thanks. re.

33
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,930
so you got that,

34
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,310
thing this week,right?

35
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,410
if by "the thing" you mean
getting my skull sawed open,

36
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,070
then,yeah,that's friday.

37
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:36,650
well,listen,if,uh,anyone
deserves to... not... die,

38
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,170
or... be
brain-damaged,it's you.

39
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,350
and look on the
bright side--

40
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,850
if you do end up a vegetable,two
words-- sponge... bath.

41
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,650
thanks.

42
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,580
that's comforting.

43
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,680
keith.

44
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,370
we need to talk about
the allen depo,right?

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,060
actually,i was
looking for eli.

46
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,770
great.   i'll be in my office.

47
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,730
everything okay with mosely?

48
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,280
aside from still
being in prison?

49
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,950
he's good.   i
saw him last week.

50
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,840
but,uh,i wanted to talk to you
about something else,though.

51
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,170
i thought they
fixed that already.

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,390
look,i know this is
a big week for you--

53
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,430
hey,is there anyone
in this office

54
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,460
who doesn't want to talk
about my neurosurgery?

55
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,910
look,i appreciate your
concern,but i'm gonna be fine.

56
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,300
did they have an
aftershock or something?

57
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,240
i must have slept through it.

58
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,880
okay,i-i get it.

59
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,820
you don't want
to talk about it.

60
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,290
but if you change your
mind,or you just want to

61
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,440
go out and get
hammered,drinks are on me.

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,060
thanks.

63
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,290
take care of yourself,man.

64
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,600
any idea why
people in the office

65
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,080
are treating me like
i'm made of glass?

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,400
um,i couldn't say.

67
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,880
you should get
ready for your 10:00.

68
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,160
patti,you don't have to
threaten people to be nice to me.

69
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,230
well,what else do
you want me to do,eli?

70
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,810
people don't get brain
surgery every day.

71
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,280
treat me like you always do.

72
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,140
in fact,i demand that you
are meaner to me than usual.

73
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,180
where's the mayor of
sasstown when i need her?

74
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,970
can we just act like
everything's normal?

75
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,150
your 10:00 is here.

76
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,690
i didn't realize
i had a 10:00.

77
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,860
<i>that's because
you don't   listen.</i>

78
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,390
see?   see?  
that's the spirit.

79
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,890
sorry.   hi.   are you patti?

80
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,890
so nice to meet you
in person,mr.   green.

81
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,250
meet eli stone.   he's
been expecting you.

82
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,230
yes,i have.

83
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,930
could you just remind
me what this is about?

84
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,420
i need you to help me die.

85
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,670
assisted suicide is
illegal in california.

86
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,760
i'm not interested
in suicide,mr. stone,

87
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,450
assisted or otherwise.

88
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,610
my wife wants me
declared incompetent.

89
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,020
she wants to
take away my right

90
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,250
to make my own
medical decisions.

91
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,280
so,uh,a-are you ill?

92
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,730
cancer.

93
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,430
it started in my
colon,but it spread.

94
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,640
i've been through
chemotherapy twice.

95
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,480
both times i went
into remission,

96
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,620
and both times the
cancer came back.

97
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,630
my wife wants me to
have chemo again...

98
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,870
but i won't do it.

99
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,010
you don't want to
go through it again?

100
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,070
no.

101
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,210
god told me to be at peace.

102
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,330
and in my experience,chemotherapy
is not peace.

103
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,810
you spoke to god?

104
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,390
yeah.

105
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,820
<i>well,he spoke to me.</i>

106
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,510
i... prayed,and i
told him what happened,

107
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,380
and it just
came to me--

108
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,150
n-not a voice,exactly,but
a feeling.

109
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,000
when it comes to
chemotherapy,for me,

110
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,380
it told me-- or he...
she...   told me--

111
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,290
third time's not the crm.

112
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,130
obviously,i'm not a
doctor,so i guessing...

113
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,240
without the
chemotherapy--

114
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,760
i'll die,probably...
or maybe not.

115
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,810
i-i-i just
prayed,and god told me

116
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,590
to put myself in his hands.

117
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,950
and my wife
doesn't want me to.

118
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,770
will you help me stop her?

119
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,270
-have you completely lost your mind? 
-original.

120
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,830
in three months,i
haven't heard that once.

121
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,650
sorry,but sane people
don't predict earthquakes,

122
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,320
and they definitely
don't sign d.n.r.s

123
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,470
-right before high-risk
neurosurgery.  -why not?

124
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,020
because postsurgical
outcomes can be unpredictable.

125
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,400
for someone like you--
35,young,in good shape,

126
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,230
you can come out with
a horrible prognosis

127
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,750
and six weeks later
be totally fine.

128
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,700
so even if i come
out a vegetable,

129
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,060
<i>i might not stay a vegetable?</i>

130
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,310
yeah,well,if you want to
get technical about it.

131
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,960
or i could stay a
vegetable,or in a coma.

132
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,400
that's why i need a d.n.r.

133
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,840
just because the surgery
is risky doesn't mean

134
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,000
you should put your life in
some random doctor's hands.

135
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,610
i'm not.   i'm
putting it in yours.

136
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,780
<i>you want me to be
your health care proxy?</i>

137
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,320
are we gonna go back
to the "crazy" jokes?

138
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,200
no,you've lost your
mind for real this time.

139
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,380
what is so insane
about asking my brother,

140
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,270
who also happens
to be a doctor,

141
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,600
to be my health care proxy?

142
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,110
nothing,except
the last two people

143
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,440
your brother did that
for happened to die.

144
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,350
valerie masters
refused the heart.

145
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,850
you said so yourself.
  she made a decision.

146
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,860
yeah,but dad didn't.  
look,i-i know my limits.

147
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,540
ten years ago,i
made a bad decision,

148
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,300
-and i'm not doing it again. 
-you won't.

149
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,940
-you don't know that. 
-yes,i do.

150
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,710
nathan,you've been right
about everything so far--

151
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,510
the aneurysm,dr.   rajapaksa.

152
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,140
whatever happens,i trust you.

153
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,410
and if i don't trust myself?

154
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,870
that's the beauty of it.

155
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,990
you don't have to.

156
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,810
what matters most is that i
believe you'll do the right thing.

157
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,840
and by "right thing," you
mean if things get bad,

158
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,120
if worse comes to
worst,you want me to...

159
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,580
i want you to let me go.

160
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,350
dr. stone?

161
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,350
dr. rajapaksa
wants to see you.

162
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,900
it's about your brother.

163
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,860

166
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,250
so i heard about
your case... and,

167
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,590
well,i was thinkg my
schedule's pretty free.

168
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,580
i could second chair.

169
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,960
uh,that's okay,maggie.
  i can handle it alone.

170
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,140
well,no,of course,you can.
  i wasn't implying that...

171
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,030
you even know what
the case is about?

172
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,530
-not really. 
-i had a feeling.

173
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,920
so what are you
really doing here?

174
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,870
nothing.   nothing at all.

175
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,270
i just-- i owe
you for last week,

176
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,150
for saving scott...
for everything.

177
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,950
you're trying to get
in on the dying guy case

178
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,560
with the other dying
guy before both guys

179
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,210
get flushed down the
proverbial toilet.

180
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,620
yes.   no.   wait.   what?

181
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,400
you're afraid i'm gonna die.

182
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,600
no,i'm not.   i'm not.

183
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,930
in fact,i would really,really
prefer it if you didn't.

184
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:04,100
it's just... this
operation,it's... it's dangerous.

185
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,660
really dangerous.

186
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,680
so maybe i am a little scared.

187
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,570
i mean,aren't you?

188
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,880
truthfully?

189
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,630
living or dying-- either
of those is fine with me.

190
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,570
it's the something in
between that scares me.

191
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,850
but for the record,dying is
not really on my agenda,so...

192
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,840
okay,you can second chair,but
no sniffling.   okay.   thanks.

193
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,120
no one wants to die,but
i'm going to,rebecca.

194
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,730
i just choose to
die on my own terms.

195
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,250
but we choose life,david.
  that's what we do.

196
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,270
moses' last words to the
israelites--"choose life."

197
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,360
she called it "the 11th
commandment" in one of her sermons.

198
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,520
my wife's a rabbi.   did
i forget to mention that?

199
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,360
yes,actually,you did.

200
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,330
but that explains the
talking to god part.

201
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,090
jews haven't talked to
god since the biblical age,

202
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,810
and in any case,you'd have to
first believe that god exists.

203
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,780
david doesn't.

204
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,310
-that's not true,rebecca. 
-fine.

205
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,540
he doesn't believe god exists
except during basell season.

206
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,130
as it turns out,i was diagnosed
during baseball season.

207
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,180
i'm hardly the first person to
find faith in times of crisis.

208
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,520
that's a large part of
what faith is for,isn't it?

209
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,740
we're not questioning
your belief in god,

210
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,720
just your belief
that god spoke to you.

211
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,560
i prayed,and i got answers.

212
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,090
how does that make
me less competent

213
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,740
than millions of other people?

214
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,330
because the answers you got

215
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,360
advised you to
abandon your children.

216
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,290
they advised me to
die with dignity.

217
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,440
and if that's god's plan,

218
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,870
i can't imagine a greater
lesson to teach my children.

219
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,290
they don't need lessons.

220
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,100
they need their father,as
long as possible.

221
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,710
where have you been?

222
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,720
i've been calling and calling.

223
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,700
why?   has something happened?

224
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,500
there's nothing that
makes me crazier than

225
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,060
you not answering your
cell phone when i call,

226
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,350
and i know you
were in the car.

227
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,160
well,i must have
had it on vibrate.

228
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,130
well,how hard is it
to turn your ringer on?

229
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,100
do i have to follow
you around telling you,

230
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,970
"ring,ring,eli,somebody's
calling,"

231
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,110
<i>when the person
that's calling is   me?</i>

232
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,220
-okay!   i'll turn my ringer on! 
-good.

233
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,730
and... your mama
dresses you funny.

234
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,250
oh,the mean thing.

235
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,170
i'd forgotten how
good you are at that.

236
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,110
jordan wants
to see you--

237
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,900
probably some new
stupid thing you did.

238
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,350
now get outta here!   i can't
stand lookin' in your face.

239
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,410
thanks,patti.

240
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,260
well,don't just stand there.
  there he is.   go.   go!

241
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,080
eli.   walk with me.

242
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,490
sir,i know i said i wouldn't
take any new cases before friday--

243
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,420
it's not about the case.

244
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,460
as w.p.k.'s former and
current managing partner--

245
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,600
speaking of which,i
know i congratulated you

246
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,000
a couple of days ago,but i'm
having this weird d¡§
j?vu-ey

247
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,180
kind of day,so in case i
didn't,congratulations again.

248
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,220
may i continue?

249
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,440
when you walked into my
office eight years ago,

250
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,390
you know what i saw?

251
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,930
a strapping young lawyer
with a full head of hair?

252
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,110
a greedy,self-righteous
little sycophant.

253
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,240
an ass.

254
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,530
i am flattered,sir.

255
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,760
but as i got to know
you,i saw you were more.

256
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,840
you were driven,competitive,and
when i found out

257
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,990
you were dating my daughter,going
to be my son-in-law,

258
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,100
i couldn't have been happier.

259
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,970
you were the man to follow
in my footsteps,to take w.p.k.

260
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,400
to the prestigious
heights i had dreamed of.

261
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,610
i put you on the fast
track for partner.

262
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,220
-but then you got an aneurysm
-and i changed,i know.

263
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,170
is this little
walk and talk about

264
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,980
how much i've
disappointed you?

265
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,220
sometimes... you
are still an ass.

266
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,040
what--what's
going on?

267
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,010
ladies and gentlemen,i present
to you the junior partner

268
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,880
in charge of pro
bono initiatives--

269
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,110
mr. eli stone.

270
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,770
all right!

271
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,300
me?   what?   oh,my god.

272
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,730
kudos,man.   you deserve this.

273
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,430
eli,we're so proud of you.

274
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,420
you mean so much
to everyone here.

275
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,130
couldn't have happen
to a better guy.

276
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,470
except me,of course.

277
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,020
eli,i'm so happy
for you.       oh!

278
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,980
wait.   i-i know
what's going on here.

279
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:46,400
sir,um,being partner means more
to me than you'll ever know,

280
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,400
but if you're doing this
because you think i'm gonna die

281
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,390
or as an
incentive to live--

282
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,160
eli,you have it all wrong.

283
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,710
i made you partner because
your compassion changed me.

284
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,060
please... wake up.

285
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,330
and how would you describe
david's religious beliefs?

286
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,940
david was born jewish,but he
never had any faith to speak of.

287
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,040
he always said if i
hadn't been so pretty,

288
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,240
he would have married shiksa.

289
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,370
so when-- when david said
that god had spoken to him...

290
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,270
well,at first i
thought it was a joke.

291
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,490
<i>now i'm convinced it's just
a symptom of his depression.</i>

292
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,470
depression?

293
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,940
when the colon cancer progressed,when
david didn't respond to

294
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,570
the new chemotherapy,he...

295
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,090
he grew more and more
despondent,hopeless.

296
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,130
he claims to have found
new faith and hope.

297
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,050
well,if that was the case,he
wouldn't be giving up.

298
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,930
he'd fight to live,to-- to
see our children grow up,

299
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,210
for as long as he can.

300
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,080
<i>that's what god wants.</i>

301
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,400
thank you.

302
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,910
<i>the god that you believe in.</i>

303
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,680
the god of the jewish faith.

304
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,640
judaism teaches that god instilled
in us the gift of learning.

305
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,120
human beings have learned to
expand the horizons of science

306
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:23,580
and medicine to create
treatments,however brutal or dangerous,

307
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,450
which can fight disease,which
can save our lives.

308
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,760
that's why i believe
god wants david to live--

309
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,890
because he created
a world in which

310
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,650
there is a chance for
my husband to survive.

311
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,090
i just want him to take
that chance... for me...

312
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,490
and for his children...
and for himself.

313
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,220
that's why i married her.

314
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,890
she's great under
pressure,isn't she?

315
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,880
she's very convincing.

316
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,870
are you having second
thoughts about helping me?

317
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,360
what exactly did
god say to you?

318
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:05,950
how did it happen?

319
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,630
did--did you,did you see
someone or i... hear a song,or...

320
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,120
i can't explain.

321
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,930
it's not like i
heard a voice,exactly.

322
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,390
it's--it's
more like a...

323
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,490
a moment of... clarity.

324
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,880
and i felt calm.

325
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,770
i had peace.

326
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,930
that never happened to me.

327
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,460
and you know,it's never happened
to rebecca,and she's a rabbi.

328
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,250
want your office back?

329
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,180
a partner should have a big,private
office that isn't a library.

330
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,290
who knew that,uh,imminent death
could be so upwardly mobile?

331
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,580
you know i couldn't be
more proud of you,right?

332
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,330
well,that means a lot...

333
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,900
especially 'cause
you're one of the people

334
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,530
i trampled on on my
ruthless climb to the top.

335
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,330
i've been wanting to
tell you something.

336
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,730
i suppose now is as
good a time as any.

337
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,010
you're the most important
person in my life.

338
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,210
i thought it was carlo,the
guy that colors your hair.

339
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,670
i'm serious,eli.

340
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,570
you taught me about love...

341
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,810
and not just the
romantic kind,

342
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,900
but the all-encompassing
lifetime kind...

343
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,240
the kind that sustains
through tragedy and... triumph.

344
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,140
-through breakups...
-and brain surgery?

345
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,890
taylor...

346
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,070
i'm gonna do my
darndest not to die.

347
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,300
listen to me.

348
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,220
you're not dead,all right?

349
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,710
you're not dead.

350
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,840
list to me.

351
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,260
i said i'd be there
for you no matter what,

352
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,960
eli,and i meant it.

353
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,120
taylor?

354
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,730
-hey. 
-good to see you.

355
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,360
you,too.

356
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,770
-are you hangin' in there? 
-me?   yeah,i'm,

357
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,510
i'm fine.

358
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,530
they were almost
done with the surgery,

359
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,240
just about to
clip the aneurysm.

360
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,260
thought he was
out of the woods,

361
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,710
and then there
was a hemorrhage.

362
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,460
then another.

363
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,120
the artery walls were
weakened due to pressure

364
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,890
from the aneurysm,and the
surgery just made things worse.

365
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,280
eli went into cardiac
arrest,and the heart attack

366
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,290
cut off blood
flow to his brain.

367
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,910
and the aneurysm?

368
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,620
it's gone.

369
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:15,980
but...

370
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,340
you know,in an
alternate universe,

371
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,330
eli and i would be
married now,and...

372
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,260
i'be the one having to
make the decision to...

373
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,410
-the decision. 
-eli already made his decision.

374
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,990
he... he didn't
want toive this way.

375
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,580
nate,it's easy to say that
when it's a hypothetical,

376
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,400
but when the worst
actually happens...

377
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,440
just because eli asked
you to let him go...

378
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,090
-it doesn't mean you have to honor his request. 
-no.

379
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,640
<i>but i have to honor him.</i>

380
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,150
i've already let him
down,and i can't do it again.

381
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,140
i just...

382
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,690
i can't.

383
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,790
everything's going my way.

384
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,220
i made partner--junior
partner.

385
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,360
they had a cake for
me-- uh,red velvet.

386
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,400
congratulations.

387
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,670
it's what i've been
working toward for years,

388
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,610
and now i have it.

389
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,310
i earned it.

390
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,030
it--it's
just...

391
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,280
"for what shall it profit
a man if he shall..."

392
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,460
regain the corner ofce
and lose his own soul?

393
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,570
<i>mark 8:36,from your
new favorite book.</i>

394
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,180
i have a new client.

395
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,580
he's dying of cancer.

396
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,120
he says that god spoke to him.

397
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,990
did he use a musical number?

398
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,800
no.   he just...
took away his burdens.

399
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,060
he feels like this great
weight has been lifted from him.

400
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,890
makes me think.

401
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,110
<i>-what has god done for you lately? 
-well,yeah.</i>

402
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,530
this guy-- he grants
inner peace and me,

403
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,470
he just tries to
scare the crap out of.

404
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,390
maybe god's showing
you his love by

405
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,130
scaring the crap out of you.

406
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,020
so this is spiritual
corporal punishment?

407
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,080
why are you looking
at me like that?

408
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,490
back on the commune,which
is supposed to be

409
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,050
a place of harmony and
connection to nature,

410
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,690
i never felt close to god.

411
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,060
that's why when i
went out on my own,

412
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,960
i immersed myself in
the study of religion--

413
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,040
all religions,so
that i could find him.

414
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,460
funny thing is,all those
years of seeking him out,

415
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,880
and he goes and finds me
when he sent a smug,stubborn,

416
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,590
pain-in-the-rear lawyer
right up to my door.

417
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,880
<i>you've lifted my burdens,eli.</i>

418
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,950
now you're doing it,too.

419
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,000
why is everyone talking
to me like i'm gonna...

420
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,380
-nathan? 
-can i help you?

421
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,660
actually,i'm here to
help you... help eli.

422
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,040
maybe you could
say that again.

423
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,310
i had a dream about eli.

424
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,310
part of him is alive.
  he's still in there,

425
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,520
-and i think he's trying to get a message out. 
-a message?

426
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,370
<i>through a dream to
his acupuncturist?</i>

427
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,110
to his friend,to
someone who might be

428
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,310
more open to these messages.

429
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,470
if it happened to you,you'd
think it was just a dream.

430
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,090
well,it happened to
you,and i still think it.

431
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,730
no offense.

432
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,850
he doesn't know the surgery
happened yet,dr. stone,

433
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,460
but he's close.

434
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,620
two weeks ago,i would
have called you a quack

435
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,300
and sent you on
your way,but now...

436
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,260
eli told
you things--

437
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,930
things about your past that
he had no way of knowing.

438
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,980
and then he put me in
charge of his d.n.r.

439
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,200
even comatose,he's a tool.

440
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,660
but today i'm supposed to
take him off of life support.

441
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,410
and i think i'm supposed
to convince you otherwise.

442
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,670
i want to listen.

443
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,250
<i>i want to believe you.</i>

444
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,190
more than anything,i
want to believe that

445
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,130
if i just wait long
enough,eli will wake up.

446
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,570
then why don't you?

447
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,300
because i can't.

448
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,040
because i know he's not okay,

449
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,150
and he is not
going to get better.

450
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,260
medical science
isn't everything.

451
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,550
if you've listened to
anything eli had to say,

452
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,600
you'd know that by now.

453
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,700
then... it's not
about what i know.

454
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,220
it's about what eli wants,

455
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,700
and he was very,very specific.

456
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,070
and if i start to
substitute my nee for his,

457
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,560
then i'm... yeah.

458
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,300
it's like i'm betraying him.

459
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,320
we're not betraying him,nate.

460
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,080
this is my dad.

461
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,420
with me.

462
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,960
i worked for him.

463
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,640
no chance you
photoshopped this?

464
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,960
i can barely check my e-mail.

465
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,050
nate,years ago,your father
foresaw me helping eli,

466
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,530
and finally,i-i think
this is my chance to.

467
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,530
give him more time.

468
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,110
i'll wait 48 hours.

469
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,150
-but if eli doesn't wake up
-he will.

470
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,580
then i'll do my best
to believe in that,too.

471
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,380
"be at peace"?

472
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,070
that was god's message to you?

473
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,640
it's so simple.

474
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,880
i guess that's
why it's divine.

475
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,770
so chemo could extend
your life or even save it.

476
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,820
why wouldn't you want that?

477
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,090
is your wife right?
  are you depressed?

478
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,730
no.

479
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,570
in fact,in some ways i'm
happier than i've ever been.

480
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,980
this is how i want to
spend my remaining days,

481
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,130
and isn't it my
choice to make?

482
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,570
thank you,david.

483
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,520
what did god sound
like,mr.   green?

484
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,200
well,i-i didn't hear a voice.

485
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,940
well,if you didn't
hear a voice,

486
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,450
how can you be so
sure it was god?

487
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,760
a feeling came over me,and i
can't describe that feeling,

488
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:36,680
that serenity,as anything
other than divine.

489
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,570
and before that,you
were despondent?

490
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,480
yeah.

491
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,370
what about the first
time the chemo worked?

492
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,240
elated.   why?  
what's your point?

493
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,780
well,one minute you're up,the
next minute you're down.

494
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,500
is there a question
in our future?

495
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,710
well,i'm just wondering
if this serenity isn't

496
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,790
just the latest
peak on the rid-

497
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,170
that your overloaded brain
created a moment of clarity

498
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,750
so that you'd just let
go,against all scientific evidence

499
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,610
that chemotherapy,sir,can,in
fact,save your life.

500
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,970
you know,there's a
scientific explanation

501
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,360
for the burning bush?

502
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,490
dry local fauna under
a volcanic fissure,

503
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,110
but none of us
were there,rebecca.

504
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,190
none of us know.

505
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,120
how can you know
it wasn't divine?

506
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,470
let me enjoy my last
moments on this earth

507
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,090
with you and the children.

508
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,040
i'm going to lose.

509
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,090
mrs. green,um,you
really shouldn't be here.

510
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,940
i'd--i could get sanctioned
for talking to you ex parte.

511
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,270
well,i won't
tell if you won't.

512
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,970
rabbi's honor.

513
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,650
look,i know i can't
convince a judge

514
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,540
to substitute david's
judgment for my judgment.

515
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,750
then... why put
david through this?

516
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,400
because i do think i
need to convince david.

517
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,710
i need to convince
him to keep fighting,

518
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,950
and i need your help.

519
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,740
rabbi,he's made his decision.

520
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,520
i know you,mr.   stone.

521
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,400
i know all about you.

522
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,710
what do you know?

523
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,730
you're sick.

524
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,650
you're fighting for
your life just as

525
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,830
my husband should
be fighting for his.

526
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,240
i know about the earthquake.

527
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,490
i know about all of it.

528
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:29,230
mostly,i know you are
more than just a lawyer,

529
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,070
and i ow david chose
you for a reason,

530
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,240
and i believe that
reason is for you

531
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,810
to show him that
difficulties can be overcome,

532
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,000
that fighting for
your life is worth it.

533
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,130
the jewish tradition teaches
that to save one life...

534
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,660
is to save the entire world.

535
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,080
you have within you the
power to save a life.

536
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,790
i beg of you... use it.

537
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,070
i think we can win this case.

538
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,560
i think i can get the
judge to stop rebecca

539
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,490
from forcing you
to take the chemo.

540
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,980
well,that's great news,but
apparently,not to you.

541
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,690
rebecca came to see me.

542
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,210
i thought that was
against the rules.

543
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,590
well... she's a rabbi.

544
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,040
we talked.

545
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,480
and the thing is,david,i...
i think she's right.

546
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,040
i think you should
want to live...

547
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:43,130
and not just for her or for
the kids,but for yourself.

548
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,500
aren't you supposed
to be on my side,eli?

549
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,430
rebecca,the doctors,and now
you're trying to convince me?

550
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,500
i'm not like them.

551
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,080
i'm--i'm-- i'm
more like you.

552
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,910
i... i believe that
god spoke to you.

553
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,990
i just think that
you heard him wrong.

554
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,680
he sent you a doctor.

555
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,120
he sent you a rabbi.

556
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,220
and now he sent me.

557
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,540
a doctor,a rabbi,a lawyer--
sounds like the start of a joke.

558
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,300
i think that god wants
you to fight for your life.

559
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,900
i am.

560
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:24,700
i'm fighting... for
the life i have now.

561
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:31,590
you know,you never asked me what
my life was like before cancer.

562
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,020
well,i had everything.

563
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,750
i had a great job.

564
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,660
i had a great car.

565
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,720
i drove home every
night to a great house

566
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,230
with a great
wife and kids--

567
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,880
except i never saw my family.

568
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,270
i was always at work.

569
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,250
you know why i-i never went to
rebecca's services at the synagogue?

570
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,770
because i got home so
late every friday night,

571
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,490
that saturday mornings i was
too exhausted to get out of bed.

572
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,870
was i a skeptic?   yeah.  
but who could blame me that...

573
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,280
that life had no meaning?

574
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,050
-it...
-sounds familiar.

575
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:06,950
i was sleepwalking.

576
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,130
don't you see,eli,that
if i never got sick...

577
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,370
i'd still be asleep?

578
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,810
<i>and i'm awake now.</i>

579
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,840
i have a full life now.

580
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,520
and it's a life i
never thought i'd have.

581
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,250
and i owe it... to
that moment with god.

582
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,040
i have a purpose now.

583
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,760
<i>that's what i'm fighting for.</i>

584
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,760
this case is not about god.

585
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,830
the mere fact that david green has
embraced death to such an extreme,

586
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,140
over the pleas of
his wife and children,

587
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,320
is evidence itself that he is not
competent to make this decision.

588
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,910
rabbi green,her
children and his doctors

589
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,270
have been unable to
force this man to do

590
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,120
the right thing,but
this court can.

591
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,470
and it shod.

592
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,880
rabbi green thinks
that there is no way

593
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,210
david could have
spoken to god.

594
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,350
well,there's no way
to prove that he did.

595
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,820
but there's no way to
prove that he didn't,either.

596
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,240
counsel asked david to tell us
what god sounded like.   why?

597
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,420
i think if we have
faith,we believe

598
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:45,090
thagod speaks to us
each in different ways.

599
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:51,120
<i>a few months ago,i started
hearing and seeing things</i>

600
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,050
<i>that indicated the
presence of god in my life.</i>

601
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,180
i tried to follow what
i thought god wanted,

602
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,720
and i paid the price.

603
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,010
looking back,i think it's
been the best time of my life.

604
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,520
david had a feeling.

605
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:16,280
i saw... george michael.

606
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,610
is that crazy?

607
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,000
if it inspires us to change
our lives for the better,

608
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:26,970
<i>then i hope--i pray...
we're all crazy.</i>

609
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,570
david wants to live
the rest of his life

610
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,560
in a way that brings
him closer to god.

611
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,110
that may not be what
we would choose for him,

612
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:41,120
<i>but it's not our choice
to make.   it's his.</i>

613
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,270
-taylor? 
-dad,hi.

614
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:51,650
-we should get going. 
-yeah.   yes.   um,just give me a sec,okay?

615
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,520
you're crying.   yeah.

616
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,480
i'm sorry.   i know
you hate crying.

617
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,620
honey,i don't hate crying.

618
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,240
okay,i hate it.

619
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,800
but these are
difficult--

620
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,150
<i>more than difficult times.</i>

621
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,610
i understand.

622
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,500
not exactly how i
thought it would go

623
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,000
when i started working here.

624
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,290
-do you regret it? working here? 
-no. no.

625
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,510
it hasn't been easy.

626
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,680
for what it's worth,i realize
a lot of that's been my fault.

627
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,910
i take it from your
silence you agree with me.

628
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,890
it's okay,dad.

629
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,430
you're just being you...

630
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,720
mr.difficult.

631
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:54,740
<i>i want you to know i'm trying
to not be myself anymore.</i>

632
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,120
if eli was...

633
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,420
if eli was here...

634
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,440
i was gonna make
him a partner.

635
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,410
i'm starting a
pro bono practice.

636
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,850
i'm changing.

637
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,780
the firm is changing.

638
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,050
i want you to be an
integral part of that.

639
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,340
please,honey,stick with me.

640
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,040
i need you here.

641
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,530
how could i not?

642
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,150
in ruling on mr.
green's competence,

643
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,780
i am not unaware
that a verdict

644
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,010
in his favor may well
sign his death certificate.

645
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,000
mr. dupler used mr. green's
alleged conversation with god

646
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,850
as evidence that he
is mentally unstable.

647
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,830
mr. stone warned us against
calling faith a form of insanity.

648
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,000
but in the eyes of the law,

649
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,600
mr. green's faith is
irrelevant to this case.

650
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,980
i must consider his
decision to not pursue

651
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,110
a course of treatment that
will make him temporarily sicker

652
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,430
but which will not guarantee
him a permanent cure.

653
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,480
from that perspective,mr. green's
decision is perfectly rational.

654
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,600
the law respects a dying
man's wishes to keep on living

655
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,730
by whatever definition
of living he chooses.

656
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,630
the motion to have david green
declared incompetent is hereby deni.

657
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:24,030
-congratulations. 
-thank you for giving me my life back.

658
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,250
-get the crash cart. 
-no.   it's all right.

659
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,550
this is what he wanted.

660
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,020
good-bye,my love.

661
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,160
something's not right.

662
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,330
i... i've been
wearing the same suit

663
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,700
and the same shirt
and tie for days.

664
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,820
i don't ever
remember going home

665
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,130
or how i've been getting
from place to place.

666
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,930
it's like i'm somewhere,and
then i'm someplace else.

667
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,650
and making partner...

668
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,470
and the case being
about living or dying...

669
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,290
the way everyone's
treating me...

670
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,790
-it's like...
-it's like what,eli?

671
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,400
i already had the
rgery,didn't i?

672
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,120
it went bad...
like in the vision.

673
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,180
sorry,bro.

674
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,480
am i... did i shove off?

675
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,660
does it matter?

676
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,410
what the hell kind
of question is that?

677
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,750
i don't want to be dead!

678
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,900
then don't be.

679
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,340
<i>what does that mean?!</i>

680
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,750
it means what it means.

681
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:15,080
would you just stop being
annoying and enigmatic?

682
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,550
i don't know what to tell you.

683
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,960
i'm not really here.

684
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,510
neither are
you,for that matter.

685
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,990
it's kind of trippy,isn't it?

686
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,750
<i>you could let go.</i>

687
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,100
no one blames you,eli.

688
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,760
no one's angry.

689
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,920
they're sad...

690
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,860
and they'll hurt.

691
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,040
they'll hurt for a long time.

692
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,740
but the world will
go on without you,eli.

693
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,060
the world doesn't
need eli stone.

694
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,800
unless...

695
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,190
unless?

696
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:01,870
i have...

697
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,630
you can say
it,eli.   it's okay.

698
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,820
i'm sure it's nice
for him to hear.

699
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,410
i have more to do? 
 i-i have more to do.

700
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,980
i think so,too.

701
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,420
how do i get out of here?

702
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,030
do i,uh,take a red
pill or,you know,

703
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,740
get scotty to beam me up or...

704
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,380
how about riding the needle?

705
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,800
does acupuncture work if
it's technically imaginary?

706
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,750
you listen to
figment dr.   chen!

707
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,830
yeah.

708
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,520
thank you.

709
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,570
for what?

710
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,200
you're talking to yourself.

711
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,630
i'll miss you most
of all,scarecrow.

712
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,840
that was lame,dude.

713
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,090
hello?

714
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,030
is anyone there?

715
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,720
george.

716
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,550
what are you...

717
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,510
oh,man.

718
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,340
are you god?

719
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,830
well,some men have said so.

720
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,490
i don't know how to get back.
