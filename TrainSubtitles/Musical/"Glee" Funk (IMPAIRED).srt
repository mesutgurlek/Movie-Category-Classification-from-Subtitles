we have a real shot at
Regionals next month?

The Ohio Show Choir chat rooms
have all been buzzing

15
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:31,555
about how Vocal Adrenaline
has lost a step.

16
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:33,423
I agree-- the judges know
all of their tricks

17
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,691
and now that we have Jessie,

18
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,293
they've lost
their best performer.

I'm sorry that
it's come to this,

00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:57,080
but you guys were awful to me.

26
00:00:57,148 --> 00:00:58,515
You never accepted me,

27
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,717
you never listened
to my clearly superior ideas.

28
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:03,053
Why are you here
in our auditorium?

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,654
The blogs and the chat rooms
say that we're finished,

30
00:01:04,722 --> 00:01:06,323
and that you guys are ripe
to topple us.

31
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,557
We just wanted to show you

32
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,993
a something we came up with
a few days ago

33
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:12,195

with that assessment.

It's a Carmel High tradition.</i>

00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:40,817
They psych out the competition
a few weeks before the big show.

69
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:42,619
They call it a funkification.

70
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:44,154
Meaning they show us
what they've got,

71
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:45,989
and we spiral
into a deep black funk.

72
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:47,591
Yeah. Yeah, we used to do
the same thing

73
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:49,159
to other football teams.

74
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:50,727
You know, try and get inside
their head before a big game,

75
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,495
pull little pranks
to intimidate them.

00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:54,631
Yeah, well, the difference was
our football team sucked.

more than that

TINA:
I feel so violated.

It's like someone

83
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:14,117
Look, it was just
a lame little prank.

84
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:15,785
And the fact that they're
trying to get to us

85
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:17,754
means maybe we
got them spooked.

Uh-uh, Mr. Shue.
They aren't afraid of anything.

87
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:22,225
That number they did
was fantastic.

88
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:23,660
You know, which doesn't
make any sense.

89
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:24,761
They had all that equipment.

90
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,962
How did they even get in?

91
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,097
I gave 'em all keys.

92
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:28,298

Let's punch out this wall here.

96
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:35,805
That'll open up the space a little bit.
Sue, what are you doing?

97
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:37,273
I can't talk to you now,
William.

98
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:39,442
Drafting class is helping me
redecorate around here.

99
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,144
You see, I have Nationals
over the weekend,

100
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:42,912
and I expect to return
with a comically large

101
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,214
first place trophy for which

102
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:46,583
I have absolutely no room
in my trophy case.

103
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:48,585
As soon as you hurry up
and lose at Regionals,

104
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:51,321
this choir room will become
my official trophy annex.

00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:53,256
You know what it
has to look like?

Elvis' gold record
room at Graceland.

Except I'll be wanting
far fewer morbidly obese

white women waddling
around and crying.

Now how do I know that?

114
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:15,745
Well, I recently checked
the odds with my Vegas bookie,

115
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:19,282
who told me that you're 40-1
underdogs at Regionals.

116
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,984
You are going to lose,
and your dreams

117
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,052

118
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,687

119
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:24,921
Sure, Will.

120
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:25,955
Hope and dream.

121
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,029
You dropped your trophy, Sue.

122
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:35,632
You know, for me,
trophies are like herpes.

123
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,735
You can try to get rid of them,
but they just keep coming.

124
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:40,437
You know why?

125
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:43,873
Sue Sylvester has hourly
flare-ups of burning, itchy,

126

highly contagious talent.

127
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:46,609
Enjoy your last few days here.

128
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:49,279

of the great State of Ohio,

139

no longer husband and wife.

All right, guys, today I want
to talk to you about regrets.

147

Who has some?

148
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:33,149
Giving my heart to Jessie,
just to have it crushed

149
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:35,084
<i>like the stage floor
at a performance of Stomp.</i>

150
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:38,087
Thinking "trust me" was
a sensible birth control option.

151
00:06:38,155 --> 00:06:39,255
We all have them.

152
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:41,324
I just finalized my divorce.

153
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:42,158
I regret
living in a relationship

154
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:43,860
that wasn't working.

155
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:46,729
Letting her put me
in these deep funks

156
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,198
and not fighting back.

157
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:51,134
Besides creeping us out,
why are you telling us this?

158
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,804
Because if we lose to
Vocal Adrenaline at Regionals,

159
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,206
none of us are
going to regret it.

160
00:06:56,273 --> 00:06:57,373
We will have given
it our best shot

161
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,142
and we won't look back.

162
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,711
But we will regret letting them
get the best of us

163
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:03,246
before the competition.

164
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:06,049
Which is why we need to hit them
back just like they hit us.

165
00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:10,286
So you want us
to TP their choir room?

166
00:07:10,354 --> 00:07:12,789
Whatever the better,
cooler version of that is.

167
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:16,559
Like, uh, maybe-maybe we should
steal their school statue.

168
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:18,027
Their school statue

169
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:21,531
is a giant bronze of a great
white shark eating a seal pup.

170
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,300
It weighs three tons.

171
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:25,702
Okay, how about this one.

172
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:27,503
All right, we get like...

173
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,305
<i>PUCK: Everyone knows this
is going to come down to me.</i>

174
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:32,976
<i>Revenge, fear, the merciless
infliction of pain.</i>

175
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:35,211
<i>These are my kingdoms.</i>

176
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,481
<i>First time I gave a wedgie
to a kid, I was four years old.</i>

177
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:41,284
<i>Finn and I may still hate
each other for some reason,</i>

178
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:44,587
<i>but we both know that defending
the honor of New Directions</i>

179
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:46,856
<i>is going to be our dirty job.</i>

180
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,725
{dog barking in distance}

181
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:50,627
{hissing}

182
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:55,965
Yeah, I did it.

183
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:58,368
And I'm proud. All I did
was step up and be a man.

184
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:00,169
They got what was coming
to them.

185
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:01,371
A few of my students
TP'd your choir room.

186
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:03,606
You slashed the tires
on the Range Rovers

187
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:06,242
of all 26 of my performers.

188
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,477
Those were gifts for
our win at Sectionals.

189
00:08:07,544 --> 00:08:08,678
That's 200 times 26

190
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:09,946
times four equals...

191
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:11,681
I don't have a calculator.

192
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:13,650
I'm sorry, you bought
all your kids Range Rovers?

193
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:15,018
We have a very active
booster club.

194
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:16,286
Look, nobody got hurt.

195
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:17,921
It was a harmless prank.

196
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:20,023
SUE: That's what they said
about a young man in Chicago

197
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,858
in 1871, who thought he'd
play a harmless prank

198
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:24,727
on the dairy cow of
one Mrs. O'Leary.

199
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,462
He successfully
ignited its flatulence

200
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,897
and a city burned, William.

201
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,499
That young terrorist
went on to become

202
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:32,368
the first gay president
of the United States,

203
00:08:32,436 --> 00:08:33,503
Abraham Lincoln.
Enough.

204
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,438
These students
have committed a felony.

205
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:37,240
They are hereby expelled.

206
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,210
Look, I don't want anyone
to get expelled.

207
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:42,946
I'm not going
to press charges...

208
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:44,914
as long as you pay
for the damage.

209
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,883
You can take it out
of the glee club budget.

210
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:48,017
That'll bankrupt the glee club.

211
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:49,419
We don't have that kind
of money.

212
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:50,520
We'll get jobs.

213
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:52,021
Give us a month.

214
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:53,289
We'll pay you back,

215
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:54,824
Ms. Corcoran, I promise.

216
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:56,693
Fine.

217
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,862
Ms. Corcoran, you are
as wise and magnanimous

218
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,064
as you are beautiful.

219
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:07,170
Thank you.

220
00:09:07,237 --> 00:09:08,705
Well, you just can't
win, can you, William?

221
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:11,641
You never have,
and you never will.

222
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:19,806
Are you want to take a trip down that
rabbit hole, William?

223
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:21,741
I'm willing to try
anything, Sandy.

224
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:24,277
I'm just really depressed.

225
00:09:24,345 --> 00:09:26,179
I don't sell to the
clinically depressed.

226
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:28,014
You'll throw yourself
off a parking garage

227
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:30,350
and I can't have that
on my conscience.

228
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:32,318
I used to coach that glee club.

229
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:34,754
I know what you're up against.

230
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:37,790
You think Carmel High didn't
put the fear of God in me?

231
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:40,326
I don't know how we
can possibly beat them.

232
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:42,495
Glee is hanging by a thread.

233
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:46,633
William, the answer is
right in front of your face,

234
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,601
but you can't see it
because you're in

235
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:49,903
too big of a funk.

236
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,674
Vocal Adrenaline
has a weakness.

237
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:57,410
{bell ringing}

238
00:09:57,478 --> 00:09:58,945
Funk.

239
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:00,613
Use it in a sentence.

240
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:01,781
Come on.

241
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:03,616
Rachel.

242
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:05,985
This cheese smells funky.

243
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:07,186
That's because
it's "from-unda" cheese.

244
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:08,421
Shut it, Puckerman!

245
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:09,889
Okay, okay.

246
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:11,724
I was thinking more
along the lines of...

247
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,860
Vocal Adrenaline has sure
put us all in a funk.

248
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:16,195
I'm so depressed, I've worn
the same outfit twice this week.

249
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:17,764
What if I told you

250
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:19,999
I knew how we could shove it
right back down their throats?

251
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,301
New Directions is about

252
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:23,670
to make their funk the P-Funk.

253
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:25,939
We are going to get funked up.

254
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:28,641
The only way to do that
is to beat them at Regionals.

255
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:31,110
Vocal Adrenaline has never once
done a funk number.

256
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:33,579
They're a machine,
a collective, synthesized,

257
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:36,115
soulless beat.

258
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Funk is soul meets anger.

259
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:39,919
Its passion is in its emotion.

260
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:42,221
And Vocal Adrenaline doesn't
perform with any.

261
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:44,090
So you have your assignment.

262
00:10:44,158 --> 00:10:46,659
I want you guys
to turn McKinley High into...

263
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,561
¶¶Funky town! ¶¶

264
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:51,464
You guys can relax,
I got this one covered.

265
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:52,699
Cool.

266
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:53,900
Hold on a second.

267
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:55,134
I-I want a chance
to get funky, too.

268
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:56,669
{laughter}

269
00:10:57,805 --> 00:10:59,605
{laughing}:
Good one, Quinn.

270
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:01,274
It even sounds funny
when you say it.

271
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:04,077
You said funk
was about soul and anger.

272
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:05,478
<i>I have plenty of both.</i>

273
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:07,380
Look at me. Look at my life.

274
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:08,448
I'm furious!

275
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:09,615
MERCEDES:
Let's be honest.

276
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:10,984
When white people try
to be funky,

277
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:13,987
you end up with KC
and the Sunshine Band.

278
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:15,088
I love "Boogie Shoes."

279
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:16,856
Mercedes' racism aside,

280
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:19,559
I will have something prepared
tomorrow.

281
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:21,394
All right, Quinn goes first.

282
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:24,564
{bell ringing}

283
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,868
Rachel, can I see you
in my office?

284
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:32,605
You seem to be taking
this Jessie thing pretty hard.

285
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:34,941
I want him to be eaten
by a lion.

286
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:36,476
{sighs}
Jessie, cared about you.

287
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:37,944
No, he didn't.

288
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:40,613
Our entire relationship
was just some diabolical plan.

289
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:42,448
They knew if they broke my heart

290
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:43,516
close enough
to the competition,

291
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:45,218
that I'd lose my will to live,

292
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:47,086
and then New Directions
would have no chance

293
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:48,421
at winning Regionals.

294
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:50,323
It's textbook;
You destroy the heart

295
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:53,092
of the team's heart
and you destroy the team.

296
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,228
<i>WILL: Sandy told me how to
beat Vocal Adrenaline,</i>

297
00:11:55,295 --> 00:11:57,063
<i>and now Rachel was
inadvertently telling me</i>

298
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:59,565
<i>how to beat my other nemesis.</i>

299
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:02,702
<i>Suddenly, I wasn't feeling
nearly as depressed.</i>

300
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,504
{playing tentative melody}

301
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:07,206
William, I'm gonna have
to ask you to clear out.

302
00:12:07,274 --> 00:12:08,808
I received an anonymous
tip from someone

303
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:10,543
who wants to meet me here

304
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:12,145
to discuss
an illegal Hot Cheetos ring.

305
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:13,546
Hot Cheetos have been proven

306
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:15,982
to raise endorphins,
which makes for happy kids,

307
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,150
and I can't have that.

308
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:18,317
Yeah, no worries, Sue.

309
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:19,619
I'll just find
someplace else to...

310
00:12:19,686 --> 00:12:22,088
Oh, wow.

311
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:22,755
What?

312
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:24,524
It-it's nothing.

313
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:27,126
It's just... it's just the way
the light hit you

314
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:29,228
just now, you looked stunning.

315
00:12:30,597 --> 00:12:32,732
No, you're radiant.

316
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,200
Well, the week before Nationals

Well, whatever you're doing,
keep it up

never looked better.

Well, if you'll excuse me,
I should...

322
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:51,784
I got stuff to do, so...
Yeah, um...

323
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:54,954
Look, Sue, I gotta ask
your advice about something.

324
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:57,990
I know I make it seem
like I-I know what I'm doing,

325
00:12:58,058 --> 00:12:59,926

to pick your brain about it.

331
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,335
I-I just wanted to know
if it's too suggestive.

two minutes of your time.

Can I go shirtless

364

Look, I only hired
you two losers

365
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,364
because I'm desperate
to increase my quarterly sales

to dinner this week.

473
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,179
How's Wednesday night?

474
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,814
Breadstix?

475
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,417
Yeah.

476
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,319
Good.

477
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,388
Oh...

478
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,990
You know what Wednesday is,
right?

479
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,895
Hump day.

480
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,214
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Schuester,

481
00:20:43,282 --> 00:20:44,749
my heart's not in this.

482
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:46,818
This whole Vocal Adrenaline
thing's really getting me down,

483
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:49,253
and we have to come up
with this funk number for Glee,

484
00:20:49,321 --> 00:20:51,389
and I have like,
less-than-zero ideas, and I...

485
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:52,757
Glee?!

486
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:55,193
God!

487
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,928
This club is like toxic mold
on my life.

488
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:01,365
I'm sorry.

489
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:05,136
What am I doing?

490
00:21:05,204 --> 00:21:07,939
This is exactly how
I destroyed my marriage.

491
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:11,843
I have this compulsive need to
crush other people's dreams.

492
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,077
Yeah, that's what Mr. Shue said.

493
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:16,581
I mean,
I think you're awesome, though.

494
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:17,782
I mean, look how hard
you've been working

495
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,219
to try and help me fold a sham.
Well...

496
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:23,387
And you'd be a total MILF

497
00:21:23,455 --> 00:21:24,822
if it weren't for the whole
faking-the-mother thing.

498
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:28,159
You're very sweet.

499
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:31,295
You could be my second chance.

500
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:33,965
I'm gonna change.

501
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:35,967
I don't have to stay in

502
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:37,535
this post-divorce funk
forever, right?

503
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:40,104
Yeah. Yeah, right, I guess.

504
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:41,439
Well, then I am
going to help you

505
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:42,340
with your Glee assignment.

506
00:21:43,342 --> 00:21:45,009
{chuckles}

507
00:21:45,077 --> 00:21:47,245
Okay, you said you needed
a funk song, right?

508
00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:50,147
Yeah.
Okay, so,

509
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:52,316
we'll type "funk"
into the iTunes,

510
00:21:52,384 --> 00:21:53,784
and we'll see what comes up.

511
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:55,520
I never thought of that.

512
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:57,855
Oh, Howard, I'm promoting Finn

513
00:21:57,923 --> 00:21:59,924
to assistant assistant manager.

514
00:21:59,992 --> 00:22:01,792
You'll report to
him from now on.

515
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,494
Do you have a problem
with that?

516
00:22:03,562 --> 00:22:05,396
{sighs}

517
00:22:07,232 --> 00:22:08,833
Wow, thanks.

518
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:10,701
I believe in you, Finn.

519
00:22:14,006 --> 00:22:15,773
{bell ringing} Okay, Quinn,

520
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:18,142
it's your day to show us
your funky side.

521
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,443
So, take it away.

522
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:22,213
For some of us...

523
00:22:23,348 --> 00:22:25,316
...just simply getting to class

524
00:22:25,384 --> 00:22:26,817
takes a little bit longer.

525
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:28,786
When you're pregnant,

526
00:22:28,854 --> 00:22:30,955
you're responsible
for two lives.

527
00:22:31,023 --> 00:22:33,124
And you're walking
down the hallway

528
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:35,092
oppressed by the man.

529
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,161
Oh, my goodness, she is
not about to go there.

530
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:38,696
Hearing people call you fat.

531
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:41,132
Sometimes it hurts.

532
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:44,936
Sometimes you have to stop

533
00:22:45,003 --> 00:22:47,939
and hold that precious life
and say no.

534
00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:49,240
This is offensive.

535

¶¶Come-come on, swing it ¶¶

633
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:47,696
¶¶Come on, swing it ¶¶

634

¶¶Yo, it's about that time ¶¶

636
00:27:51,434 --> 00:27:52,934
¶¶To bring forth
the rhythm and the rhyme ¶¶

637
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:55,304
¶¶I'm gonna get mine,
so get yours ¶¶

638
00:27:55,371 --> 00:27:57,172
¶¶I want to see sweat
comin' out your pores ¶¶

639
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,041
¶¶On the house tip is
how I'm swingin' this ¶¶

640
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:00,709
¶¶Strictly hip-hop, boy,
I ain't singing this ¶¶

641
00:28:00,777 --> 00:28:03,578
¶¶Bringing this
to the entire nation ¶¶

642
00:28:03,646 --> 00:28:06,648
¶¶Black, white, red, brown, feel
the vibration ¶¶¶¶Vibration ¶¶

00:28:12,155 --> 00:28:16,892
¶¶It's such a sweet sensation ¶¶

646
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:19,061
¶¶The vibrations good
like Sunkist ¶¶

647
00:28:19,128 --> 00:28:20,929
¶¶Many wanna know
who done this ¶¶

648
00:28:20,997 --> 00:28:22,698
¶¶Pucky Puck

649
00:28:22,765 --> 00:28:25,334
¶¶Rhymes will groove you
and I'm here to prove to you ¶¶

650
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:27,135
¶¶That we can party
on the positive side ¶¶

651
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:28,637
¶¶And pump positive vibes,
so come along for the ride ¶¶

652
00:28:28,705 --> 00:28:31,373

00:28:39,015 --> 00:28:42,918
¶¶It's such a sweet sensation ¶¶

657
00:28:42,985 --> 00:28:44,252
Finnie D, break it down.

658
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,754
<i>¶¶Down, down, down, down ¶¶</i>

659

¶¶My body is healthy,
my rhymes make me wealthy ¶¶

00:28:58,067 --> 00:29:01,036
¶¶And the Funky Bunch helps me ¶¶

664
00:29:01,104 --> 00:29:02,904
¶¶To bring you a show

¶¶Can you feel it, baby? ¶¶

668
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:11,413
¶¶I can, too ¶¶

{song ends, applause and whoops}

673
00:29:22,992 --> 00:29:24,793
WILL:
All right.

674
00:29:24,861 --> 00:29:26,895
Great job, guys,
but that's not funk.

675
00:29:26,963 --> 00:29:28,063
I mean, the group is called

676
00:29:28,131 --> 00:29:29,264
Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch,

677
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:30,432
but that is a rap song.

678
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,501
A kick-butt old school rap song.

679
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:34,736
ARTIE:
Does it really matter, Mr. Shue?

680
00:29:34,804 --> 00:29:37,906
We're so clinically depressed,
we're doing the wrong songs.

681
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:39,841
We're in a deeper
funk than ever.

682
00:29:47,383 --> 00:29:50,185
Mercedes,

683
00:29:50,253 --> 00:29:52,020
I'm so sorry.

684
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:53,388
You may not be a minority,

685
00:29:53,456 --> 00:29:55,957
but you certainly get
how it feels sometimes.

686
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:57,726
For nine months.

687
00:29:57,794 --> 00:29:59,361
You've had to deal with this

688
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:02,497
your whole life.

689
00:30:02,565 --> 00:30:05,801
People making assumptions,
calling you names.

690
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:09,438
I seriously can't understand
why don't feel like

691
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:11,072
yelling at people all the time.

692
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,508
What's the point
in getting angry?

693
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:15,076
Because it's infuriating.

694
00:30:15,144 --> 00:30:17,646
I hate all the looks at school.

695
00:30:17,713 --> 00:30:20,849
Don't even get me started
on Puck's mom.

696
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:23,018
You're not angry.

697
00:30:23,085 --> 00:30:24,586
You're hurt.

698
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:26,087
You just need someplace safe

699
00:30:26,155 --> 00:30:27,823
where you can dig through
all that rage.

700
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,725
Get to the pain beneath it.

701
00:30:30,793 --> 00:30:32,127
So it's decided.

702
00:30:32,195 --> 00:30:33,628
Saturday you move out
of Puck's house

703
00:30:33,696 --> 00:30:35,497
and you move in with me.

704
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,401
I already talked
to my mom about it.

705
00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:42,337
My brother went off to college
and we have an extra room.

706
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:44,072
Mercedes...

707
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,941
It's cool.

708
00:30:46,008 --> 00:30:48,543
Us sisters got to stick
together, right?

709
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:52,180
{chuckles}

710
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:55,717
{both laughing softly}

711
00:30:57,053 --> 00:30:58,253
{doorbell rings}

712
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:03,358
Mr. Schuester?
Yes.

713
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:04,860
Come in.
Thank you.

714
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,664
Um, is she doing okay?

715
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:11,967
Never seen her like this.

716
00:31:12,034 --> 00:31:14,436
She won't leave her room,
and refuses her protein shakes.

717
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:16,304
Bad.

718
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:18,740
Very bad. Well, please, tell her
I'd love to speak with her.

719
00:31:18,808 --> 00:31:20,475
Let me ask.

720
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:21,776
Thank you.

721
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,847
Careful.

722
00:31:25,915 --> 00:31:27,516
That Regionals '85.

723
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:29,251
Very precious to Ms. Sue.

724
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:30,352
Sorry.

725
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:34,589
<i>Mija, Mr. Schuester
is here.</i>

726
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:36,191
SUE: Okay.
Okay.

727
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,894
She agreed to see you.

728
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:40,662
<i>Oh, gracias por tu ayuda.</i>

729
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,663
<i>De Nada.</i>

730
00:31:47,303 --> 00:31:49,538
{knocking}

731
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:51,673
So have you come to gloat?

732
00:31:51,741 --> 00:31:55,010
I, uh...

733
00:31:55,077 --> 00:31:57,412
I hear you're pulling out
of Nationals, Sue.

734
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,947
You know, for some
of your girls

735
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:01,616
that's going to have
some really big consequences.

736
00:32:01,684 --> 00:32:02,884
I'm tired of those kids.

737
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:04,219
I devoted my life to them.

738
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:06,221
And what have I got
to show for it?

739
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:10,091
Five consecutive
National championships.

740
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,893
Oh, big deal.

741
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:14,195
I'm alone, William.

742
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:16,398
I don't even like you
and I was willing

743
00:32:16,465 --> 00:32:18,333
to jump at the chance
to be with you.

744
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:22,337
And, you know, for a second,

745
00:32:22,405 --> 00:32:24,306
I saw a flash of something.

746
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:26,074
I pictured myself

747
00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:29,411
living a normal life.

748
00:32:29,478 --> 00:32:31,713
Having someone to come home to
every night.

749
00:32:34,817 --> 00:32:38,186
And though
I completely loathe you,

750
00:32:38,254 --> 00:32:40,889
you'd make
a great trophy husband.

751
00:32:40,957 --> 00:32:42,424
And as you can see

752
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:45,594
by my decor,
I love me some trophies.

753
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:48,430
Sue, I did what I did to you
out of anger.

754
00:32:48,497 --> 00:32:49,931
I thought destroying you

755
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:52,701
would pull me out of my funk.

756
00:32:52,768 --> 00:32:56,538
But... just made things worse.

757
00:32:56,606 --> 00:33:00,041
So is that an apology?

758
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:02,277
Yes, it is.

759
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:04,846
And you're not alone, Sue.

760
00:33:04,914 --> 00:33:07,148
Your kids need you,

761
00:33:07,216 --> 00:33:09,217
<i>so you do have love
in your life.</i>

762
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:11,586
My kids don't love me;
They fear me.

763
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:13,688
<i>But you love them, Sue.</i>

764
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:21,896
Hand me my bullhorn, will you?

765
00:33:25,768 --> 00:33:28,103
{feedback squeals}

766
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,771
Amelda!

767
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,339
Make me a shake!

768
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:32,407
To go!

769
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:33,575
AMELDA:
Hooray.

770
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:35,010
Make it two.

771
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:39,547
{bell ringing}

772
00:33:39,615 --> 00:33:41,049
{cell phone rings}

773
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:45,120
Hello.

774
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:47,455
JESSIE:
Meet me out in the parking lot.

775
00:33:53,729 --> 00:33:56,331
{piano plays gentle melody}

776
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:28,363
{laughing}

777
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:29,898
I hear you're a vegan, Berry.

778
00:34:29,965 --> 00:34:31,199
The souls of those
poor egg fetuses

779
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:32,467
are all on your conscience now.

780
00:34:32,535 --> 00:34:33,301
{laughs}

781
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,403
Do it, Jessie.

782
00:34:37,606 --> 00:34:40,382
Are you with us or not?

783
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:51,052
Do it.

784
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,021
Break it
like you broke my heart.

785
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:56,150
I loved you.

786
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:20,453
Now...
nightmares of all of the mothers

787
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,722
of the little baby chicks
coming after me for revenge.

788
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,090
Oh, this is bull!

789
00:35:24,157 --> 00:35:26,258
Finn, Mike, Matt, come with me.

790
00:35:26,326 --> 00:35:27,827
Right on. It's time for less
talking and more punching.

791
00:35:27,894 --> 00:35:30,029
Hey, what's going on?

792
00:35:30,097 --> 00:35:31,731
<i>We're on our way to go all
Braveheart on Vocal Adrenaline.</i>

793
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:33,666
Guys, violence is never
the answer.

794
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:36,102
It is when the question is
"What's the best way to mess up

795
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:37,103
that Jessie kid's face?!"

796
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,637
Mr. Shue, Rachel's one of us.

797
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:40,573
We're the only ones
who get to humiliate her.

798
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,208
Stop!

799
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:44,510
Get back here and sit down!

800
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:48,781
Look, I know from experience

801
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:51,250
that making someone else suffer
doesn't make your pain go away.

802
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:52,852
You're all amazing, no matter

803
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:54,920
what Vocal Adrenaline
says or does.

804
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,756
We just need to find a way
to remind ourselves of that.

805
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:58,591
We can't just let
Vocal Adrenaline get away

806
00:35:58,658 --> 00:35:59,925
with turning Rachel
into an omelet.

807
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:01,427
We're not.

808
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:04,663
Rachel, dial Jessie's
number on your phone.

809
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,169
SANTANA: You haven't
deleted his number yet?

810
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:11,837
Jessie St. James?

811
00:36:11,905 --> 00:36:14,106
Will Schuester here.
You and Vocal Adrenaline need

812
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:17,176
to meet at our auditorium
Friday, 3:00 sharp.

813

BRETT PAXTON: Let's hear it
from the internationally ranked

814
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:21,914
Cheerios coach Sue Sylvester.

815
00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:24,250
Coach, six consecutive
National titles.

816
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:26,886
You're the Michael Jordan
of cheerleading.

817
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:28,254
Thanks, Brett, I am.

818
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:31,056
Sue, let us know about
the decision you made

819
00:36:31,124 --> 00:36:32,691
to have Kurt Hummel here

820
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:35,561
do a 14-and-a-half minute
Celine Dion medley,

821
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:37,897
entirely in French.

822
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:39,398
Well, I'll tell you what, Brett,

823
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:40,900
I'm all about finding
a freakish, depressed kid

824
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:42,368
and showing him
what winning is all about.

<i>Vive Le difference!</i>

826

Whoo! {giggles} Well...
well, Sue, congratulations,

827
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:49,308
but I have to ask you,
where are you going to put

828
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:51,977
that mammoth
skyscraping trophy?

829
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:54,747
I know just the place.

{whispers}:
I'm sorry, Mr. Shue.

833
00:37:15,836 --> 00:37:18,604
Wow. You did it, Sue...

834
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:20,439
I'll do the talking,
thank you very much.

835
00:37:20,507 --> 00:37:22,508
Let me break it down
for you, William.

836
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,844
You're standing at a crossroads.
You have two choices:

837
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:26,245
Number one:

838
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:28,581
This trophy will be installed
in the choir room

839
00:37:28,648 --> 00:37:30,316
in a custom-built
bulletproof case

840
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:32,518
as a daily reminder
of your failure

841
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:35,354
as a man and an educator.

842
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:36,555
And what's choice number two?

843
00:37:38,158 --> 00:37:39,391
You can kiss me...

844
00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:43,229
...right here on the lips...

845
00:37:44,664 --> 00:37:46,532
...with tongue.

846
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:50,169
This is payback, isn't it?

847
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:56,275
No one will know?

848
00:37:58,245 --> 00:38:01,180
Fine.

849
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,887
You know what?

850
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:09,455
I'm not gonna do this.

851
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:14,393
Even your breath stinks
of mediocrity.

852
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,061
It's making me sick.
