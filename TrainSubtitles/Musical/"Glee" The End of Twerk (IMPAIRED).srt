00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:42,030
so no one finds out
or gets upset.

158
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:45,667
Oh. Don't worry.

159
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:47,669
Your secret's safe with me.

160
00:07:47,703 --> 00:07:50,639
UNIQUE: <i>And that's how
it all started...</i>

161
00:07:50,673 --> 00:07:53,809
<i>the Great McKinley Bathroom</i>
<i>Gender Riot of 2013.</i>

162
00:07:55,111 --> 00:07:57,879
<i>Bree figured out that the boys'</i>
<i>room was a great place</i>

163
00:07:57,914 --> 00:07:59,681
<i>to make out in</i>
<i>and not get caught.</i>

164
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:02,017
You've been avoiding me.

165
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:08,356
Whoa.

166
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:10,192
<i>Stoner Brett started using</i>
<i>the girls' bathroom</i>

167
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:11,927
<i>because it was cleaner</i>
<i>and it smelled better,</i>

168
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:14,496
<i>and he heard a rumor that</i>
<i>the toilet seats were heated.</i>

169
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,432
<i>And then the girls started</i>
<i>using the boys' room</i>

170
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:21,369
<i>when they realized that boys</i>
<i>never had to wait in a line.</i>

171
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:27,709
<i>It was chaos.</i>

172
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:29,678
♪

173
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,351
Whoops.

174
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:41,323
I just had

175
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:43,425
the most incredible
experience of my life.

176
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:45,493
Oh, my God.
Did you cut your hair?

177
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:46,995
I was feeling stuck.

178
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:50,599
(sigh, laughs): Oh.

179
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:51,800
You know, Rupert's amazing,

180
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,535
but he has such specific views
on everything.

181
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:55,503
And it's not like
I don't trust his vision,

182
00:08:55,538 --> 00:08:58,073
but I felt like I needed
to just rebel a little bit

183
00:08:58,107 --> 00:08:59,774
in order to have
more room to play.

184
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,376
So he doesn't know that
you were wearing a wig?

185
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,144
Not at first, but then
I told him after rehearsal.

186
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:04,713
And he really loved it,
and I might get

187
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:07,616
- to wear it in the show. - What if he
got mad about you lying to him?

188
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,418
Or-or what if he saw that you cut
your hair and sent you packing?

189
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:12,754
Okay, you know what, Kurt?
You've become boring.

190
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:15,824
You go to class, and then you come
home and you watch your stories

191
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:18,026
and eat on this food
and you Skype with Blaine,

192
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,194
and it's not even sexy Skyping.

193
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:20,896
I know this
because you just go to sleep.

194
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,098
Same thing every day.

195
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:25,467
- I change up my afternoon
smoothie occasionally. - You know,

196
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,869
it felt so good taking
a risk with this wig.

197
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:29,671
It's, like, I just...
I felt so alive.

198
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:32,774
And I know I could have messed
everything up, but I didn't even care.

199
00:09:32,808 --> 00:09:34,776
It's, like, I just
wanted to risk it all.

200
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,778
- What's gotten into you? - I don't know.
But do you remember

201
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:38,346
in high school,
everything felt so urgent?

202
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:41,149
Like if we didn't just go for it
we'd lose our chance forever?

203
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:42,918
Yes, it was very stressful.

204
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:44,586
I want to feel that way again.

205
00:09:45,621 --> 00:09:48,156
Does this have something
to do with Finn?

206
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:51,860
You know, if part
of my grieving process

207
00:09:51,894 --> 00:09:55,163
is just diving headfirst
into life, then... maybe.

208
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:58,967
All right, Rachel Berry...

209
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:00,402
you got me.

210
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:02,504
Let's go out
and do something crazy.

211
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:04,973
(gasps) Like what? Let's go use
flash photography at the Met.

212
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:06,675
Small potatoes.
How about we break out

213
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:08,743
the bottle of limoncello
you've been saving up.

214
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:09,978
What for?

215
00:10:10,012 --> 00:10:12,213
Anesthesia.

216
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:17,157
Both orangutans have been
charged with solicitation

217
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:19,893
and impersonating
a police officer.

218
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:23,197
Prosecutors say both
Tickles and Bam-Bam

219
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:26,000
will be tried as adults.

220
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:28,769
And now let's stroll
on down to Sue's Corner,

221
00:10:28,803 --> 00:10:33,240
with cheerleading icon,
Principal Sue Sylvester.

222
00:10:33,274 --> 00:10:35,309
Thank you, Rod. Andrea.

223
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,577
America,

224
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:39,146
tonight I address
a nation at war.

225
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,182
Now, I'm not referring to
Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad,

226
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:45,252
who gassed his own people
when they began to make fun

227
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:47,254
of his extremely hilarious lisp.

228
00:10:47,288 --> 00:10:50,891
No, this nation faces
a far more insidious foe:

229
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:52,793
Miley Cyrus...

230
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:56,096
and the genital-flapping dance
known as "twerking"

231
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:58,732
that makes men and women alike
look like overgrown,

232
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:00,801
constipated toddlers.

233
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:02,369
This vulgar,

234
00:11:02,404 --> 00:11:04,271
sexually explicit
excuse for a dance craze

235
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:06,640
has brought American culture
to a new low.

236
00:11:06,674 --> 00:11:09,843
And that's why tonight,
Western Ohio,

237
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,846
I solemnly pledge to end
the pandemic of twerking

238
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,214
once and for all.

239
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:16,850
Not only will I outlaw twerking
at McKinley High,

240
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,020
but I have submitted a bill
to the Ohio State Legislature

241
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,956
banning twerking
in Ohio public schools.

242
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:24,558
And Hannah Montana

243
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:27,928
can go back to naked-straddling
the three-ton wrecking ball

244
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:29,863
she was clearly upsold
at Home Depot,

245
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,866
as the tiny cinderblock room
she's elected to demolish

246
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,334
is only about 12 square feet

247
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:35,903
and already has a wall missing.

248
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:37,738
And that's how Sue

249
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:40,374
sees it.

250
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,708
Ron.

251
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,377
Oo-hoo, Sue!

252
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,845
You're outta sight.

253
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,847
We'll be right back.

254
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:48,749
(talking over each other)

255
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:51,418
She will not
get away with this...

256
00:11:51,453 --> 00:11:52,586
WILL: Guys, guys! What's going on?
JAKE: Did you not see.

257
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,421
Principal Sylvester's
latest "Sue's Corner"?

258
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:55,889
She's trying to take away
our God-given right

259
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,291
to twerk, Mr. Shue,
it's bullcrap!

260
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:58,492
I think what we're all
feeling, Mr. Shue,

261
00:11:58,526 --> 00:11:59,493
is that we were really
onto something

262
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:01,161
with this whole twerking
at nationals thing...

263
00:12:01,196 --> 00:12:03,263
I completely agree with you.

264
00:12:03,298 --> 00:12:05,165
Principal Sylvester is drawing
a line in the sand.

265
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,101
She's deciding what's acceptable
and what's not,

266
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:08,469
and that's just not gonna stand.

267
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:10,771
The fact is, twerking is about

268
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:13,006
blurring the lines, between
the past and the present,

269
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,708
between men and women,

270
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:16,710
between tradition
and envelope-pushing!

271
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:19,079
It's all in that
Alan Thicke song that I love.

272
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,148
- "Blurred Lines" by <i>Robin</i> Thicke?
- Exactly.

273
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:22,583
That's not what
that song's about.

274
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,885
Sue Sylvester wants to draw
a line in the sand?

275
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,019
Well, we're gonna blur it.

276
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:27,688
And blow this debate wide open!

277
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:28,755
Yeah!
(whoops)

278

(school bell ringing)

341
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,298
You do realize
that "Blurred Lines"

342
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:53,367
is a song about
date rape, don't you?

343
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:54,701
(laughs) What?

344
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:56,203
- No, it's not.
- Will...

345
00:14:56,237 --> 00:14:58,277
you need to "back your ass
up" to the fact that you,

346
00:14:58,306 --> 00:14:59,806
a married 37-year-old,

347
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:02,876
just performed a song about
coercive sexual advances

348
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,712
as nine minors
twerked alongside you

349
00:15:05,747 --> 00:15:07,547
down the hallways of
a public high school.

350
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:09,416
It's called
the First Amendment, Sue.

351
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,751
This is about
freedom of expression.

352
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,353
Well, then feel free
to express that out loud

353
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:15,989
as you pace the floors of
your dingy, lonely apartment,

354
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:17,691
because you,
Will Schuester, are fired.

355
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:20,494
I am not leaving.

356
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:21,928
And I will

357
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,697
be appealing this
to the school board.

358
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:30,504
Oh, my God.

359
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:31,738
Are we actually gonna do this?

360
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:33,140
I've always wanted one.

361
00:15:33,174 --> 00:15:34,374
You think Blaine's
gonna be mad?

362
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:36,176
Well, isn't he, like,
obsessed with Adam Levine?

363
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,210
(sighs) You're...
you're right.

364
00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:38,645
You're right about everything.

365
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,414
- I just need to wake up and
come out of myself. - Yes!

366
00:15:40,448 --> 00:15:41,581
You know? I mean,
I'm an artist!

367
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:42,883
I should start acting like one!

368
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:44,584
Would Andy Warhol be
standing here worrying?

369
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:45,686
No, he wouldn't!

370
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,687
To rebellion.

371
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:48,055
In all of its forms.

372
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:49,056
Okay.

373
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,190
Oh, chug, chug, chug. Ooh!

374
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,327
(whoops) (mutters)

375
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,931
Oh, my God,
there is a little...

376
00:15:57,965 --> 00:16:00,067
Oh, God, tastes like
lemons and gasoline.

377
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:01,735
- The worst.
- It's the worst.

378
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,330
- So, what are we gonna get?
- I don't know.

379
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,338
Let's surprise each other.

380
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,939
Okay. Look at the kitty cat.

381
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,176
So who's first?

382
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:19,156
Good morning, sunshine.

383
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:20,491
Two shots of limoncello,

384
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:22,827
- and I feel like I got hit by a bus.
- Ugh.

385
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:24,896
I'm the worst rebel
in the world.

386
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,330
Well, I made pancakes.

387
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:27,131
Ooh!

388
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:28,666
Ooh, oh, I forgot

389
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,967
that was there for a moment.

390
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:31,002
I didn't want a tramp stamp,

391
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:32,970
and I thought if
I got it on my arm,

392
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:34,672
then I wouldn't be able to go sleeveless again.
Well, let me see!

393
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:37,875
Okay. So when we decided
that we were doing it,

394
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,076
I knew exactly what I wanted.

395
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,212
I even printed it out
in the font that I like,

396
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:42,780
so the tattoo guy
knew exactly what to do.

397
00:16:42,814 --> 00:16:43,881
Okay.

398
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:44,882
It's both personal

399
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,884
and political, just like me.

400
00:16:48,153 --> 00:16:48,986
Ta-da!

401
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:50,855
(gasps) Oh, Kurt!

402
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:51,889
"It Gets Better"!

403
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:53,724
- That's so sw...
- What?

404
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,825
Is it infected?

405
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,361
No, it's just, it says
"It's Get Better,"

406
00:16:57,396 --> 00:16:58,796
not "It Gets Better."

407
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,464
They misspelled it.

408
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:05,002
Oh, my God.

409
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:07,104
I have absolute nonsense
written on me permanently.

410
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:09,106
Okay, y-y-y-you have
to get it removed.

411
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:11,208
Of course I do.
What if I run into Dan Savage

412
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:13,511
in the steam room at the gym?
I mean, I'll be humiliated.

413
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:14,779
Don't worry, they do
a really good job

414
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:16,180
at removing tattoos these days.

415
00:17:16,214 --> 00:17:18,249
Yeah, for tens of thousands of
dollars, which I don't have.

416
00:17:18,283 --> 00:17:19,750
Okay, then, we're going to
go back to the tattoo parlor

417
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:21,252
and we're gonna have them fix it.
Just show me yours,

418
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:22,553
'cause maybe he spelled
Streisand wrong,

419
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:24,422
and, a-and we can be
maimed together.

420
00:17:24,456 --> 00:17:27,425
You know what? I, I, I
didn't go through with it.

421
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,060
Are you kidding me?

422
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:30,828
I was thinking about all
of my favorite idols...

423
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:32,163
Barbra, Patti,
and Carole King...

424
00:17:32,197 --> 00:17:33,297
and none of them have tattoos.

425
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:34,765
I cannot believe you backed out
without telling me.

426
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,267
I went. I was going to go
through with it,

427
00:17:36,301 --> 00:17:37,601
but you were halfway
through yours, and I just...

428
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:40,304
Look, I-I'm really
sorry, okay?

429
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:42,540
I-I-I'll go back with you,
we can get your money back.

430
00:17:42,574 --> 00:17:45,109
No, what I want back I can't
get... my innocence, my pride,

431
00:17:45,143 --> 00:17:47,278
and my unblemished
alabaster skin.

432
00:17:47,312 --> 00:17:50,047
Kurt.

433
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:52,049
(school bell ringing)

434
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:53,951
(sighs)

435
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:58,622
Well, well, if it isn't

436
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:02,460
the "Q" in the LGBTQ-
XYZ-who-gives-a-crap.

437
00:18:02,494 --> 00:18:04,695
You want me to warm that
seat up for you, sweetheart?

438
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,963
Listen, we get it.

439
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:07,598
It must just be hell
hiking up that lovely dress

440
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:09,600
at a urinal. Just let me do my
business, and I'll go, please.

441
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:12,403
Oh, sorry, we're just curious
how exactly you do that.

442
00:18:12,437 --> 00:18:14,005
Don't be scared.

443
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,940
We're all guys here.

444
00:18:15,974 --> 00:18:17,508
(laughter)

445
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:20,277
(flushes) Let's get
out of here, man.

446
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:22,880
(laughter)

447
00:18:22,914 --> 00:18:24,915
You believe that?

490
00:21:47,018 --> 00:21:49,653
We need some names.

491
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:51,522
RYDER: Yeah, you know, some
people at this school need

492
00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:52,590
to get their ass kicked
to learn

493
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:53,824
not to mess with you anymore.

494
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:55,326
Come on, guys,
you know that's not a solution.

495
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,393
No, enough is enough.

496
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:57,661
Mr. Shue's right.

497
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:59,430
I love you guys.

498
00:21:59,464 --> 00:22:01,765
And your support
means everything.

499
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,535
But it won't fix anything.

500
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:07,238
In fact, it'll probably
make everything worse.

501
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:12,509
Motion approved to dig up
the school parking lot

502
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:14,411
and move the Indian bones.

503
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:17,514
Now, the McKinley School
Board calls to the podium.

504
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:19,016
"Teacher of the Year..."

505
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,652
What is this, a typo?

506
00:22:21,686 --> 00:22:22,886
William Schuester?

507
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:24,555
Thank you, Superintendant.

508
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:25,889
And a very good evening
to everyone.

509
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:28,292
We really appreciate
you moving this meeting

510
00:22:28,326 --> 00:22:29,560
of the school board
to the auditorium

511
00:22:29,594 --> 00:22:32,796
where you could hear
and see our case.

512
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:36,166
Now, as you all know, Sue
Sylvester has recently banned

513
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:37,635
a dance known as twerking
from McKinley.

514
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:39,169
You call it twerking?

515
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:41,505
I call it dance porn.
Well,

516
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:43,340
that is exactly
what people once said

517
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,242
about an outrageous
new dance called...

518
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:47,244
the waltz.

519
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,612
It was considered indecent

520
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:50,848
because a man
and woman were actually

521
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:54,685
clutching each other as they
whirled around the ballroom.

522
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:57,221
In the 1920s,
rebellious jazz babies

523
00:22:57,255 --> 00:23:00,524
shocked society by
kicking up their heels

524
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:02,459
to Charleston.

525
00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:05,562
In the '50s,

526
00:23:05,597 --> 00:23:06,897
everyone was scandalized

527
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:08,932
by Elvis' pelvis.

528
00:23:12,937 --> 00:23:14,405
And then came a flood

529
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:15,706
of dirty dancing.

530
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,141
The twist.

531
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:18,942
The pony.

532
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:20,644
And heaven forbid,

533
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:22,012
the mashed potato.

534
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:23,547
All considered scandalous

535
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:25,082
and sinful then.

536
00:23:25,116 --> 00:23:26,617
Now, with time and distance,

537
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:27,718
thought of as quaint

538
00:23:27,752 --> 00:23:30,020
and innocent even.

539
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:32,556
In the '80s came
the most forbidden

540
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,359
dance of them all...
the Lambada.

541
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:37,461
Spawning national outrage

542
00:23:37,495 --> 00:23:40,064
and two not-so-great movies.

543
00:23:40,098 --> 00:23:41,598
And now...

544
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,367
it's twerking.

545
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,936
♪

546
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,040
I guarantee you
that in 20 years,

547
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:52,810
twerking will be considered
a silly nostalgic dance.

548
00:23:52,844 --> 00:23:54,478
So I ask you.

549
00:23:54,512 --> 00:23:56,673
Do you want to be on the right
side of musical history?

550
00:24:01,588 --> 00:24:04,613
Oh, hey, Sue.
You wanted to see me?

551
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:06,381
William, you can wipe
that smug look off your face.

552
00:24:06,415 --> 00:24:07,849
And while you're at it,
wipe your chin

553
00:24:07,884 --> 00:24:09,885
- because there's a butt on it.
- Oh.

554
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,953
Well, I asked you in here
as an act of contrition.

555
00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:14,389
Wade "Unique" Adams made
an impassioned plea

556
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:16,458
for a unisex bathroom
at this school.

557
00:24:16,492 --> 00:24:18,460
The arc of the moral universe
is long,

558
00:24:18,494 --> 00:24:20,128
but it bends towards justice.

559
00:24:20,162 --> 00:24:21,496
Do you know who said that?

560
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:22,631
Captain America.

561
00:24:22,665 --> 00:24:23,899
Dr. Martin Luther King.

562
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:24,833
Hmm.

563
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:25,934
And I was so moved

564
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:27,369
I decided to
provide him with it.

565
00:24:27,403 --> 00:24:30,805
So, from this day forward,
let it be known

566
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,240
that Unique will be able
to dump dirt

567
00:24:32,275 --> 00:24:34,175
in the privacy
of his very own crapper.

568
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,278
Wow, that's...

569
00:24:36,312 --> 00:24:37,746
great.

570
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,914
Where is it?

571
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:42,317
KITTY:
We have to move it.

572
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:45,086
We tried.
It's bolted to the floor.

573
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:46,988
I am so sorry, guys.

574
00:24:47,023 --> 00:24:48,263
This is like
living a nightmare.

575
00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:51,593
Tina?
How could you?

576
00:24:51,627 --> 00:24:52,994
What? It's convenient.

577
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:56,131
Jesus, get your priorities
straight.

578
00:24:56,165 --> 00:24:57,966
Uh, o-okay, guys.

579
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
(clears throat)

580
00:24:59,035 --> 00:25:00,569
L-let's practice
our-our twerking.

581
00:25:01,504 --> 00:25:03,505
(indistinct chatter)

582
00:25:05,775 --> 00:25:06,975
Are you dyslexic?

583
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:09,477
Or illiterate?
Or a charlatan?

584
00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:11,046
You completely
messed up my tattoo.

585
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,280
I am scarred!

586
00:25:12,315 --> 00:25:14,416
Let me see.

587
00:25:17,787 --> 00:25:20,455
That is exactly
what you told me to write.

588
00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:22,490
No, I wanted a message of hope.

589
00:25:22,525 --> 00:25:23,805
Something to represent
my strides

590
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:25,026
I've made as an individual

591
00:25:25,061 --> 00:25:26,728
and the political sea change.

592
00:25:26,762 --> 00:25:28,496
You should've put
"It gets better" on there.

593
00:25:28,531 --> 00:25:29,764
I did!

594
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,600
No, you didn't.

595
00:25:34,136 --> 00:25:36,071
This is what
you gave me to write.

596
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:38,373
I ask questions
because I don't want to hear

597
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:39,874
everybody's bullcrap story

598
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:42,978
about what their tattoo means.

599
00:25:43,012 --> 00:25:45,313
I must've screwed it up
when I was typing it.

600
00:25:45,348 --> 00:25:47,949
Yeah.

601
00:25:47,984 --> 00:25:49,384
Let me ask you something.

602
00:25:49,418 --> 00:25:50,819
What are you even doing here?

603
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:52,587
You don't seem
like the tattoo type.

604
00:25:52,622 --> 00:25:56,324
I wanted to rebel.
And shake off my doldrums.

605
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,093
(groans)
My path has been different

606
00:25:58,127 --> 00:26:00,061
and exciting considering
my background

607
00:26:00,096 --> 00:26:01,129
but considering
who I think I am,

608
00:26:01,163 --> 00:26:02,631
and how I see myself,

609
00:26:02,665 --> 00:26:05,266
It's like I've taken the
street car named predictability.

610
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:06,267
(groans)

611
00:26:06,302 --> 00:26:07,335
I guess this is the price I pay

612
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,637
when I try to surprise myself.

613
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:10,105
Nah.

614
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:12,040
I think your motives were true.

615
00:26:12,074 --> 00:26:13,975
It's just that, you know,

616
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,343
when you go off road, man...

617
00:26:15,378 --> 00:26:17,278
weird stuff is gonna happen.

618
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:20,281
Check this out.

619
00:26:20,316 --> 00:26:22,317
(chuckling)

620
00:26:25,154 --> 00:26:26,287
That demon looks
like John Davidson.

621
00:26:26,322 --> 00:26:28,556
I got that in Hong Kong.

622
00:26:28,591 --> 00:26:30,225
I was trashed, right?

623
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:33,228
And I asked this guy
for a Harley Davidson tattoo.

624
00:26:33,262 --> 00:26:35,563
And I guess something
got lost in translation

625
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:37,065
'cause when I woke up

626
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:38,499
I had the host
of <i>That's Incredible!</i>

627
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:39,467
On my freakin' chest.

628
00:26:39,502 --> 00:26:42,070
Eh. Turned him
into a demon.

629
00:26:42,104 --> 00:26:45,173
Lame ass goes to badass,
two hours tops.

630
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:47,108
My body's covered
with mistake ink.

631
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:48,810
You can fix damn near anything.

632
00:26:48,844 --> 00:26:49,978
How can you fix this?

633
00:26:50,012 --> 00:26:52,814
Why don't you give me
another shot at it?

634
00:26:52,848 --> 00:26:54,149
I'm, uh...

635
00:26:54,183 --> 00:26:55,884
starting to get a sense
of who you are.

636
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:57,686
Why don't you hop
back up on the table

637
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,154
and I'll see what I can do.

638
00:26:59,188 --> 00:27:01,489
No charge. I'll even throw
in a tongue piercing.

639
00:27:01,524 --> 00:27:02,924
No cost to you.

640
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:05,026
Why would I want to do that?

641
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:06,895
Look,

642
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,897
you step back now,

643
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:10,999
you will never take
another risk again.

644
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:14,703
You will have given up on
the whole concept of going nuts.

645
00:27:14,737 --> 00:27:17,038
What you got to do is
you got to go more nuts,

646
00:27:17,073 --> 00:27:18,907
have a positive experience.

647
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:20,909
And then you'll realize

648
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:24,212
that that is where you find
the juice of life.

649
00:27:25,581 --> 00:27:27,315
Come on.
Oh...

650
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:28,583
(whispering):
Okay.

651
00:27:28,617 --> 00:27:31,086
Juice of life.

652
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,121
(school bell rings) (chuckling)

653
00:27:35,224 --> 00:27:38,727
Oh, Marley, have
you seen this Vine?

654
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:40,929
I call it "Squeezin' Out
a Twerkle Head."

655
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:42,731
(chuckles) It looks

656
00:27:42,765 --> 00:27:45,066
like you've got a bad case
of the spastic butt coughs.

657
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:46,735
(chuckles) Good one!

658
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:49,804
You're hilarious. Like,
Comedy Central-funny. Hey!

659
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,539
I was just trying to be helpful.

660
00:27:51,574 --> 00:27:53,742
I'd be happy to give
you twerk lessons.

661
00:27:53,776 --> 00:27:55,143
Twerking's really
not that hard,

662
00:27:55,177 --> 00:27:56,644
not if you have
the right partner.

663
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:58,780
How do you think your
boyfriend got so good at it?

664
00:27:58,814 --> 00:28:01,449
Oh. Yeah, Jake didn't tell you?

665
00:28:01,484 --> 00:28:03,284
After your pathetic night of.

666
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,286
"Don't touch me there,
I mean it, Jake,"

667
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:06,721
he came running to me.

668
00:28:06,756 --> 00:28:08,590
And we twerked

669
00:28:08,624 --> 00:28:10,492
all night long.

670
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:12,093
Mm, Jake's not like that.

671
00:28:12,128 --> 00:28:15,497
And if he was, he would aim a
lot higher than trash like you.

672
00:28:15,531 --> 00:28:16,464
(gasps)

673
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:18,333
That is slut-shaming.

674
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:20,835
You are using
the derogatory label "trash"

675
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,370
for a female's
natural sensuality.

676
00:28:22,404 --> 00:28:24,072
It's femiphobic,

677
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:25,740
neoretrogenderist

678
00:28:25,775 --> 00:28:27,609
and a clear form
of sexual bullying.

679
00:28:27,643 --> 00:28:30,111
And as this beautiful
poster clearly states,

680
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:31,780
this is a Bully-Free Zone.

681
00:28:31,814 --> 00:28:33,214
But I will be the better person

682
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:34,749
and not report you
to Principal Sylvester

683
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:36,117
for immediate expulsion.

684
00:28:36,152 --> 00:28:38,286
By the way, you know
that cute little mole

685
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,888
on Jake's right hip
and how, when you kiss it,

686
00:28:39,922 --> 00:28:42,390
it drives him absolutely crazy?

687
00:28:42,424 --> 00:28:44,125
Oh, right.

688
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,227
You wouldn't know
about that, would you?

689
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:47,829
Well, trust me.

690
00:28:47,863 --> 00:28:49,864
He loves it.

691
00:28:59,253 --> 00:29:01,987
Hey, I was just ab...
about to come find you.

692
00:29:02,021 --> 00:29:03,855
Pull down your pants.
I want to see your right hip.

693
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,458
I want to see if there's a mole. I want
to see if she's telling the truth.

694
00:29:06,492 --> 00:29:08,961
- Who? - Please tell me
there's no mole.

695
00:29:08,995 --> 00:29:11,129
Please tell me she's just lying
to screw with my head.

696
00:29:11,164 --> 00:29:13,398
Please tell me
you didn't really cheat on me,

697
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:15,601
especially with h-her.

698
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:21,273
- Marley...
- Oh, my God.

699
00:29:21,307 --> 00:29:23,468
- I'm so sorry. Look at me. Look...
- Just stop. Just stop.

(school bell rings)
(distorted chatter)

744
00:32:03,469 --> 00:32:04,603
Mr. Shue?

745
00:32:06,406 --> 00:32:09,374
I need to use the, uh...

746
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:11,209
the magic bathroom.

747
00:32:11,244 --> 00:32:12,944
KITTY:
Okay, if Oprah's gonna

748
00:32:12,979 --> 00:32:14,413
drop the Cosby kids off
at the pool,

749
00:32:14,447 --> 00:32:16,248
I am not going
to be here for it.

750
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:17,416
Wait.

751
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,418
Unique doesn't need to use
the Porta Potti.

752
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:21,186
Come with me.

753
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:26,391
There's nothing wrong
with the Porta Potti.

754
00:32:26,426 --> 00:32:27,526
Again?

755
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,028
She just used it, like,
five minutes ago.

756
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:32,497
Thanks for doing this,
Mr. Shue,

757
00:32:32,532 --> 00:32:33,999
but I don't need a bodyguard.

758
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:36,201
It's not about feeling safe
in the boys' bathroom;

759
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:38,003
it's about feeling
like I don't belong.

760
00:32:38,037 --> 00:32:40,272
Look, I-I hate to say it,
but I-I think as long

761
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:43,275
as you keep being yourself,
your life is probably gonna be

762
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:45,076
a constant string
of "don't belongs."

763
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:47,913
I know. I should probably
just start getting used to it.

764
00:32:47,947 --> 00:32:49,581
No, no, no.
(chuckles)

765
00:32:49,615 --> 00:32:51,583
You should never
get used to it.

766
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:53,919
All great change has come
from people who refused

767
00:32:53,953 --> 00:32:56,755
to get used to what was
accepted but wasn't right.

768
00:32:56,789 --> 00:32:58,790
Slavery, gay rights,

769
00:32:58,825 --> 00:33:00,859
New Coke.

770
00:33:00,893 --> 00:33:02,260
So, what you're saying is,
I should pull a Rosa Parks

771
00:33:02,295 --> 00:33:04,830
and refuse to give up my seat
in the girls' bathroom.

772
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:07,499
Unfortunately, you're not going
to change the world overnight

773
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:10,469
with some radical act
of rebellion.

774
00:33:10,503 --> 00:33:12,704
You just need to keep finding
the places you belong

775
00:33:12,738 --> 00:33:14,473
and the people you belong with,

776
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:17,442
and then you'll have an army
to fight alongside of you

777
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:20,045
until the world
is finally brave enough

778
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:22,280
to accept you for who you are.

779
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:23,849
It's hard, you know?

780
00:33:23,883 --> 00:33:25,717
Having to dress like this
every morning,

781
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:28,487
knowing that almost
nobody will understand.

782
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:32,057
But I don't have a choice...
this is who I am.

783
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:34,192
Thank you for seeing
how hard it is.

784
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:37,629
No one should have to work
so hard and risk so much.

785
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:43,468
From now on, whenever
nature calls,

786
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:45,270
I want you to find me.

787
00:33:45,304 --> 00:33:47,138
And I'm going to open
this up for you.

788
00:33:47,173 --> 00:33:50,709
It's a single stall,
so it's coed.

789
00:33:50,743 --> 00:33:53,545
(clears throat)

790
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:57,015
No one needs to know
how you identify yourself.

791
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:59,351
They just need to know that
you washed your hands after.

792
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:02,354
Thank you.

793
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:06,791
All right.

794
00:34:06,826 --> 00:34:08,827
(sighs heavily)

795
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,434
Hey, Becky,
I'm here to see Sue.

796
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:18,436
Do you have an appointment?

797
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:20,238
No.

798
00:34:20,273 --> 00:34:22,040
Then get out, bitch!

799
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:23,208
SUE:
It's okay, Becky.

800
00:34:23,242 --> 00:34:24,442
Send him in.

801
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:28,079
Have a seat.

802
00:34:28,114 --> 00:34:30,248
I saw you escort Unique

803
00:34:30,283 --> 00:34:32,517
to the teacher's restroom
and let him use it.

804
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:35,554
And I think it's degrading
for him to have to do that,

805
00:34:35,588 --> 00:34:38,023
and it's given me
a change of heart.

806
00:34:38,057 --> 00:34:39,858
I would like to propose a deal.

807
00:34:39,892 --> 00:34:42,427
I'll give Unique a key
to that bathroom

808
00:34:42,461 --> 00:34:43,762
on one condition.

809
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:44,963
What is it?

810
00:34:44,997 --> 00:34:47,666
You and the Glee Club
stop twerking. For good.

811
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,935
Sorry, Sue, but there's no way in hell
that I'm going to make that deal.

812
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:53,405
Oh, for God's sake, William,
that's your red line?

813
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:56,274
Of all the things in the world
to be outraged about.

814
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:57,642
This isn't about twerking.

815
00:34:57,677 --> 00:35:00,078
This is about standing up
to Sue Sylvester

816
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:03,315
and her inane,
out-of-touch meddling.

817
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:05,917
It's about rebelling against
your repeated attempts

818
00:35:05,952 --> 00:35:08,219
to suppress the Glee Club
and what we're trying to say.

819
00:35:08,254 --> 00:35:11,456
When a law is unjust,
it's your duty as an American

820
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:13,024
to disobey.

821
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:14,526
It's called
civil disobedience, Sue.

822
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,860
Fine, have it your way.

823
00:35:15,895 --> 00:35:18,229
The chemical toilet stays bolted
to the choir room floor.

824
00:35:18,264 --> 00:35:21,032
Fine. And maybe I'll just throw
a Sue Sylvester-style

825
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:23,301
rebellion tantrum
as I leave this office.

826
00:35:23,336 --> 00:35:25,470
I don't know
what you're talking about.

827
00:35:25,504 --> 00:35:26,738
Oh, no?

828
00:35:26,772 --> 00:35:30,508
It goes a little something
like this.

829
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:36,047
(yells)

830
00:35:36,082 --> 00:35:37,382
(dramatic aria begins)

831
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:39,050
(yells)

832
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:40,485
William, stop that.

833
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:42,721
(yells)

834
00:35:42,755 --> 00:35:44,189
William Michael Schuester!

835
00:35:44,223 --> 00:35:46,524
Becky, no, no, no.
Don't even think about it.

836
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:47,726
Becky, no, no, no, don't...

837
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,893
(loud clattering)

838
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,167
(aria crescendos)

839
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:04,560
Hey, where have you been?

840
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:06,074
Look, I know that
you're upset with me

841
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:07,663
about the tattoo and everything,

842
00:36:07,697 --> 00:36:09,999
but this silent treatment,
it's a little immature.

843
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:12,201
(muffled):
It's kind of hard to talk.

844
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:13,536
Are you eating something?

845
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,937
Did you get a pretzel from
the guy down the street?

846
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:16,305
Because I thought
we were diet partners.

847
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:18,407
I pierced my tongue.

848
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:19,542
You pierced your tongue?!

849
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:20,776
Oh, my God, that is so gross.

850
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:21,911
Put that away.
I don't want to look at it.

851
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:23,078
Doesn't it hurt?

852
00:36:23,113 --> 00:36:25,114
I-It's not that bad actually.

853
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:27,483
Louis did it for free
when he fixed my tattoo.

854
00:36:27,517 --> 00:36:28,818
You fixed it? What did he do?

855
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:31,420
No, he got a little creative
with the phrasing.

856
00:36:31,454 --> 00:36:32,788
One might say poetic.

857
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,156
But, you know, I really
do think he captured my essence,

858
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:35,391
given the circumstances.

859
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:36,625
Let me see.

860
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:39,962
"It's Got Bette Midler."

861
00:36:40,997 --> 00:36:42,531
"It's Got Bette Midler."

862
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:44,333
Oh, my God, that is genius.

863
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:46,268
And it makes absolutely
no sense.

864
00:36:46,303 --> 00:36:49,305
But it makes perfect sense, and
I honestly kind of love it.

865
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:51,407
So, uh, what about
the tongue stud?

866
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:53,209
Uh...

867
00:36:53,243 --> 00:36:56,979
I think... I was in
the same boat as you.

868
00:36:57,013 --> 00:36:59,682
Ever since Finn died, I've been
going about my business,

869
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:02,117
but I've also kind of been
in a trance.

870
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:07,056
And I guess I just needed
to be shocked back to life.

871
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,259
And... there was something about
having a metal stud

872
00:37:10,293 --> 00:37:12,294
go through your tongue
that does the trick.

873
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:13,929
Hmm.

874
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:15,998
So, are you going to talk
like that forever?

875
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:17,800
No, it should go down
after a couple days.

876
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:19,001
You should totally
get one of these.

877
00:37:19,035 --> 00:37:21,537
Oh, yeah, totally.
Yeah, rethink that tattoo.

878
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:23,906
I-I don't... I just...

879
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,474
I don't think
that there's anything

880
00:37:25,508 --> 00:37:27,076
that I would, like, love enough
that I would want

881
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,411
to get on my body
for the next 50 years, so...

882
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:30,779
Well, suit yourself.

883
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:33,015
Meanwhile, I'm going
to go Skype with Blaine

884
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:34,683
and show him
my new tat and piercing.

885
00:37:34,718 --> 00:37:36,585
Maybe if I play
a little Maroon 5

886
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,254
I'll get cyber lucky.
(clicks tongue)

887
00:37:41,258 --> 00:37:43,158
(door closes)

888
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:17,393
♪ (indistinct chatter)

889
00:38:28,738 --> 00:38:30,706
Hey, guys. Guys.

890
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,907
Mr. Shue, what's up?

891
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,043
It's not the end
of the week yet.

892
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:35,911
(sighs): No. But it is
the end of twerking.

893
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:38,013
Why? We were killing it.

894
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:39,548
Well, some of us were.

895
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:41,550
I know, and I'm sorry.

896
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:44,420
After the school board meeting,
I thought it was smooth sailing,

897
00:38:44,454 --> 00:38:48,023
but twerking was... and
remains... a hot-button issue.

898
00:38:48,058 --> 00:38:49,325
I didn't think
this was one battle

899
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,726
worth fighting to the death.

900
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,895
Meaning... you caved.

901
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:54,596
UNIQUE:
No.

902
00:38:55,565 --> 00:38:58,534
He did it for me,

903
00:38:58,568 --> 00:38:59,601
didn't you, Mr. Shue?

904
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:03,305
That's why the Porta Potti
is gone.

905
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,674
That's why Principal Sylvester's
out of my business.

906
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:08,577
I-I'm not putting this
on you, Unique.

907
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:11,413
I believe I did what anyone
in this room would've done

908
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:13,749
for one of their friends.

909
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:15,651
It was a judgment call,

910
00:39:15,685 --> 00:39:19,455
but some things are just more
important than others.

911
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:22,558
MARLEY:
I'm glad we're done twerking.

912
00:39:22,592 --> 00:39:24,433
I didn't like it,
and I never felt comfortable.

913
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:26,762
Honestly, I just had
an awful week.

914
00:39:26,796 --> 00:39:28,197
BLAINE:
I have to admit,

915
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:30,099
twerking was really fun,
but it...

916
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:33,335
just doesn't seem like
it was 100% our style.

917
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,904
No big loss.

918
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:37,272
Yeah, rebelling is one thing,

919
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:38,947
but betraying who we are,
that's not cool.

920
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:42,311
We are who we are,
no apologies necessary.

921
00:39:42,345 --> 00:39:44,246
All right, then,

922
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,581
we're moving on,

923
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:48,384
no regrets, no looking back.

924
00:39:48,418 --> 00:39:49,752
And I agree with you, Artie.

925
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:52,154
So, I was thinking,

926
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:53,822
instead of playing
against who we are,

927
00:39:53,857 --> 00:39:55,157
let's embrace it.

928
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:56,959
Let's lean into our strengths

929
00:39:56,993 --> 00:39:59,428
by finding a song that's
old-school Glee:

930
00:39:59,462 --> 00:40:01,630
upbeat, optimistic,

931
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:02,831
full of youth, and hope...

932
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:04,500
Oh, I-I've got something.
