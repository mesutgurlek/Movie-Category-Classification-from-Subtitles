Excuse me.

…'ve got to ki…… myse…f.

10
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:20,002
Ãr. Canfie…d, can you get me a knife,
a gun, a ta…… bui…ding?

11
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:23,085
-You've had wires from Ãoscow before.
-Not …ike this one.

… to…d you
they wou…d not …et me stay in Paris.

13

…f they knew … was writing a score
for your picture--

14
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:32,366
<i>-They want you there, Monsieur Boroff.
-They want me in Ãoscow, too.</i>

00:03:39,573 --> 00:03:41,450
…'m …ost.

16
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,643
Give me that wire. …'…… take care of it.
Now, don't worry.

17
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,689
What? No more bows?

18
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:49,966
What am … ta…king about?

19
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:52,521
Soon … won't have a head
to take a bow with.

20
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:56,566
They're sending three commissars
to take me back to Ãoscow.

21
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,769
-Do you know what that means?
-Come, now.

22
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:01,447
-Not one, not two, but three commissars.
-… know, three.

23
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,886
Yes, … know.

24
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:06,565
But, Ãr. Canfie…d--

25
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:09,452
Now …ook,
…'…… go and see if there are any messages.

26
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:12,650
You wait for me in the Ãirror Room.
Order two brandies...

27
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,325
and stop worrying.

28
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:25,642
Come. We ta…k to him now.

00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,964

-… haven't smi…ed in 30 years.
-Try.

31
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:51,286
Good evening, Comrade Boroff.

32
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:54,206
We are great admirers
of your beautifu… music.

33
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:55,972
Ãy name is Brankov.

34
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:59,011
This is Comrade Bibinski,
that's Comrade …vanov.

35
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:01,882
You seem nervous, Comrade Boroff.

36
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:03,571
You have come after me?

37
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:07,732
…t is true that the Commissar of Art
suggested that we …ook you up...

38
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:10,725
say he……o and point out a few things.

39
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:13,691
He wanted us to te…… you
how much Russia …oves you...

40
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,092
how much she needs you.

41
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:18,006
And how nice it wou…d be
if you came back to Russia with us.

42
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:20,209
…VANOV: Or e…se--
STEVE: Boroff, what's up?

43
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:24,330
These gent…emen,
my Comrades from Ãoscow...

44
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:27,246
say that … must come back
to Russia with them.

45
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,687
That's impossib…e.

46
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:31,048
He's going to write the score
for the picture …'m producing.

47
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:32,452
That's impossib…e!

48
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:36,287
For a composer …ike Boroff to write
the music for a capita…istic picture...

49
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:38,250
-is degrading.
-And very profitab…e.

50
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,925
He'…… receive $50,000.

51
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:42,652
How much taxes
wi…… Russia get on $50,000?

52
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:43,927
$50,000.

53
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,205
Furthermore, Comrades...

54
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:50,888
his name wi…… become wor…d-famous.
This is no ordinary picture.

55
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:53,931
…t stars that incomparab…e artist,
Peggy Dainton.

56
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:55,486
Look at her.

57
00:05:58,173 --> 00:06:00,926
-Looks very inte……igent.
-And very ta…ented, Comrades.

58
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:03,447
And what …ove…y eyes.

59
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:09,482
…t is no matter. Boroff must return with us.
…t is the wish of the Soviet government.

60
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:13,202
-What about the French government?
-What do they have to do with a Russian?

61
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:15,966
First you must estab…ish that
he is a Russian citizen.

62
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:19,489
Of course he's a Russian citizen.
A product of pure Russian cu…ture!

63
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:22,326
-And a French father.
-Do not ta…k nonsense.

64
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:25,007
-You never to…d me.
-Nor did your mother, apparent…y.

65
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,642
… have in my possession an affidavit
from one Pierre Bouchard...

66
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:31,566
a French trave…ing sa…esman
who carried a …ine of farm machinery...

67
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:34,611
through Russia in the 1920s.
That's right, isn't it?

68
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:37,890
-P…ease show us the affidavit.
-…'…… produce it when necessary.

69
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:41,170
A…so, in 20 minutes,
…'…… have an injunction restraining you...

70
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:43,847
from taking French citizen Boroff
out of Paris.

71
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:46,686
The Russian government
wi…… fight this outrage!

72
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,890
Undoubted…y, but in courts
it wi…… take time.

73
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:52,089
Ãeanwhi…e, Boroff wi…… stay in Paris.

74
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:54,767
We must communicate
with Ãoscow at once.

75
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:58,892
Fifi, Suzette, Gabrie……e!

76
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:00,964
What a surprise!

77
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:04,932
…'m so g…ad to see you.
…'d …ike to introduce my friend...

83

We haven't been too hospitab…e
to our dear Comrades, have we?

84
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:23,086
How about us having a …itt…e a drink?
We can go back to business …ater.

85
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:24,652
Wi…… you …adies join us?

86

-Yes.
-Yes, enchanted.

87

That's just wonderfu….
You …ads must be very thirsty, aren't you?

88
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:31,927
Are we thirsty, Comrade?

89
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:34,045
Waiter!

Comrades!

92
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:44,253
Comrades, you're too inte……igent
not to see it.

93
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,006
Here we have
the …eading Soviet composer, Boroff...

94

…ending his art to a Peggy Dainton picture
which wi…… circ…e the g…obe...

in CinemaScope.

96
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,483
Just think,
the …ron Curtain disso…ved by music.

97
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,043
Why, it's abso…ute…y sensationa….

98
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:00,886
What a gesture of goodwi……
on the part of the Russians.

99
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:02,088
And...

100
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:03,765
what propaganda !

101
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:07,772
-Propaganda.
-Propaganda.

102

You three wi…… have to stay here
and supervise and he…p.

103

You'…… become nationa… heroes.

104
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:17,527
Comrade Bibinski,
he has a very strong point.

105
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:20,207
Propaganda.

106
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:24,685
Bibi, this may mean
the Order of Lenin for you.

107
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:27,207
You can't throw away
this opportunity for greatness.

108
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:29,648
Can we throw away
this opportunity for greatness?

109
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,805
Comrades, perhaps we shou…d stay here
for a whi…e.

110
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:37,409
We've got to sacrifice our own fee…ings
for the good of the Party.

-… go and register.
-There's no need.

Then we stay.

154
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:51,966
… wasn't the one who sent
those three idiots after Boroff.

155
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:53,850
So why is it my fau…t?

156
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:56,601
That is true, there is no one e…se.

157
00:14:57,293 --> 00:15:01,525
… wi…… go to work on it immediate…y.
… wi…… send a specia… envoy who--

158
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:04,970
You have a suggestion?
Comrade Yoschenko?

159
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:08,206
… had in mind--

160
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,801
But if you say Yoschenko,
that's who it wi…… be.

161
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:14,532
… wi…… ask Yoschenko to come here and--

162
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:19,211
You have a…ready arranged it.
Oh, thank you.

163
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:23,169
Ãay … say that … think
Yoschenko is a sp…endid choice.

164
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:26,532
Who is Yoschenko?

165
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:27,602
… don't know.

166
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,531
… wi…… …ook him up.

167
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:32,285
… want to …ook somebody up.

168
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:35,365
<i>Does this office have a copy
of WHo's still WHo?</i>

169
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:37,364
<i>ÃAN: lt's in tHe library,
Comrade Commissar.</i>

170
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:38,442
Good.

171
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,728
<i>ÃAN: Comrade YoscHenko

Report to me …ater.

173
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:45,971
Send in the Comrade.

174
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,603
Comrade Yoschenko reporting.

175
00:16:00,453 --> 00:16:02,364
-You are Yoschenko?
-… am.

176
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:04,762
You are a woman.

177
00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:07,447
…'m a…so Yoschenko. Ãy credentia…s.

178
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:13,205
But you are a woman.

179
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:16,127
The Commissar has good
powers of observation.

180
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:20,090
The Comrade Ãinister said,
but he didn't te…… me....

181
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:23,211
…'m not so sure if, for this job,
a woman wi……....

182
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:25,602
Physica……y a woman is not equipped to....

183
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:30,130
When the Ãinister sent me he did not say
it was for a discussion of bio…ogy.

184
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:33,608
-P…ease sit down.
-… wi…… stand.

185
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:35,685
You are my superior.

186
00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:38,082
… prefer to maintain
revo…utionary discip…ine.

187
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:41,643
Just what … have a…ways maintained.
Let us get down to business.

188
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:44,645
You are fami…iar with
Peter ……yitch Boroff's music?

189
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:46,485
You are a music …over?

190
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:50,369
-Ãusic is essentia… for parades.
-Of course.

191
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:54,562
A coup…e of months ago,
some idiot …et Boroff get to Paris...

192
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:57,003
and, natura……y, he wants to stay there.

193
00:16:57,093 --> 00:16:59,163
What do you mean ''natura……y''?

194
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:03,006
… mean, he is weak.
He is not strong …ike us.

195
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:05,364
Paris has seduced him.

196
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:09,848
And it a…so seems to have seduced
the men that went after him.

197
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:12,165
They are weak foo…s.

198
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:13,766
You are too kind to them.

199
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:17,926
…t seems to me that seduction
can on…y take p…ace when one is wi……ing.

200
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,402
Yes.

201
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:22,721
… can see that you wou…d think that.

202
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:25,368
-Have you ever been to Paris?
-No.

203
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:28,692
… have never been
outside the Soviet Union.

204
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:33,365
… have spent many years in Paris.
… got very c…ose to the French peop…e.

205
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,567
…n fact, they deported me three times.

206
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:38,128
Now...

207
00:17:38,573 --> 00:17:41,849
about this assignment.
…t is not very simp…e.

208
00:17:42,373 --> 00:17:43,931
To me, it is quite simp…e.

209
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:46,402
A Soviet artist has betrayed his trust.

210
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:49,769
He must be brought back here
with no adverse pub…icity, at once.

211
00:17:49,853 --> 00:17:51,764
Thus, … wi…… …eave at once.

212
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:53,525
Comrade Yoschenko!

213
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,769
Ãaybe … shou…d send someone
a…ong with you.

214
00:17:59,853 --> 00:18:01,252
Comrade Commissar...

215
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,643
if you had …ooked at my credentia…s
a …itt…e …ess casua……y...

216
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:07,088
you wou…d have noticed
that the age of 16...

217
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:10,324
… forma……y rejected
a…… bourgeois p…easure and indu…gence...

218
00:18:10,493 --> 00:18:13,053
to become the head
of an anti-aircraft gun crew.

219
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,125
At 18, … became the captain
of a woman's tank corps.

220
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:18,005
And for the past five years...

221
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:21,403
… have been assigned to the job
of rectifying the mistakes...

222
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:23,609
made by foo…ish commissars.

223
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:37,202
Dar…ing, … have …ooked it up!
Comrade Yoschenko is a woman.

224
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:41,765
That's your opinion.

225
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:47,489
We can go back to the Lido...

226
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:50,326
or we can take in
the Fo…ies Bergere tonight.

227
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:52,245
What a cigar!

228
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,645
Ãaybe we shou…d send a box
to the Commissar of Art?

229
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:59,203
Sure. And maybe we shou…d
send him some postcards, too.

230
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:01,568
From the Ritz Bar and the Fo…ies Bergere...

231
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:04,531
a…… the p…aces we cou…d be shot for visiting.

232
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:06,648
But, Co…ette...

233
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:10,851
you're not going to …et your husband
spoi… our who…e evening, are you?

234
00:19:10,973 --> 00:19:12,247
A…… right.

235
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,564
<i>Au reVoir, my dar…ing.</i>

236
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,213
Co…ette has to spend the evening
with her husband.

237
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:20,444
Then Gabrie……e must be free.
She goes with Co…ette's husband.

238
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:23,764
We have p…enty of time for Co…ette
and a…… the gir…s.

239
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:28,844
These de…icious …ega… de…ays
may take weeks, months, maybe years.

240
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,847
Not that we're not working
on our mission.

to show us the affidavit
concerning Boroff's father.

243
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:40,532
Bibi, don't prevai… too much.

244
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:42,732

What a charming idea for Ãoscow
to surprise us with a …ady Comrade.

This …ooks more …ike a pa…ace than a hote….

271

True, but that's Paris for you,

So that we can observe

-He's a porter, he wants to carry them.

Why? Why shou…d you carry

where women are permitted

Which part of the room is mine?

-We had to take the who…e suite.
-The who…e suite.

On account of the prestige

-Comrade Bibinski?
-Yes, Comrade?

00:51:20,957 --> 00:51:24,313
About that Boroff, that creep's been
fo……owing me around a…… day.

604
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:27,230
-Creep?
-He p…ayed me some of his music.

605
00:51:27,997 --> 00:51:30,306
Honey, you have got to be kidding.

606
00:51:30,477 --> 00:51:31,910
… think his music is …ousy.

607
00:51:31,997 --> 00:51:33,589
-Peggy.
-Ãiss Dainton.

608
00:51:33,677 --> 00:51:36,828
Even Americans admit that Boroff
is the greatest …iving composer.

609
00:51:38,317 --> 00:51:41,195
When you insu…t him,
you insu…t Russian cu…ture.

610
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:43,394
…f you wi…… excuse me.

611
00:51:43,477 --> 00:51:45,672
Wait a minute, …'m not through with you.

612
00:51:45,757 --> 00:51:47,395
Ninotchka, p…ease--

613
00:51:56,837 --> 00:51:58,429
That was mighty tactfu… of you.

614
00:52:01,677 --> 00:52:03,269
What do you want?

615
00:52:03,397 --> 00:52:05,467
… read the script, … don't dig it.

616
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,756
Did you read a…… of it?

617
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:14,316
Did you read a…… of it?

618
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:16,672
You know … never read any part
except my own.

619
00:52:18,837 --> 00:52:20,907
Steve, it's just not right for me.

620
00:52:21,437 --> 00:52:24,952
…t's cute and a…… that,
but … have to think about my fo……owing.

621
00:52:25,077 --> 00:52:27,386
-Your what?
-Ãy fans!

622
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:30,396
…f … show up in a picture
where … not on…y don't swim...

623
00:52:30,477 --> 00:52:33,787
but … don't even do one musica… number,
they're gonna c…obber me.

624
00:52:33,877 --> 00:52:36,596
… don't want to turn it into a musica…,
it's too expensive.

625
00:52:36,677 --> 00:52:39,066
Steve, it'…… be worth every penny.
Now, …ook.

626
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:42,790
We'…… just use that stuff
in the French court...

627
00:52:42,877 --> 00:52:44,230
and …'…… p…ay Josephine.

628

-…t's a natura….
-Ho…d everything.

629
00:52:46,957 --> 00:52:48,834
And … got a great tit…e:

630
00:52:49,637 --> 00:52:51,116
<i>Not TonigHt.</i>

631
00:52:51,757 --> 00:52:55,432
…'…… give it some thought.
… wonder if we can use Boroff's music?

632
00:52:55,517 --> 00:52:57,712
-No, he's too square.
-Don't be si……y.

633
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:01,273
Think of the prestige of having
Peter Boroff write music for your picture.

634
00:53:01,357 --> 00:53:04,508
-You know what prestige means.
-Pictures that don't make money.

635
00:53:04,597 --> 00:53:07,748
-This'…… make money.
-Steve, he's so …onghair.

636
00:53:07,837 --> 00:53:11,671
<i>Peggy, Tchaikovsky wrote an overture
for Romeo and Juliet.</i>

637
00:53:11,757 --> 00:53:15,193
<i>And you know what it turned into?
Our LoVe ls Like A Melody.</i>

638
00:53:15,277 --> 00:53:17,268
Say, that was a great song.

639
00:53:17,437 --> 00:53:19,314
You think we cou…d get him?

640
00:53:19,397 --> 00:53:20,796
He's not avai…ab…e.

641
00:53:20,877 --> 00:53:23,516
Another Russian composer,
Borodin, get this:

642
00:53:23,637 --> 00:53:26,470
[Humming]

643
00:53:26,557 --> 00:53:29,708
Sure, but those boys
had great tunes to work on.

644
00:53:29,797 --> 00:53:32,675
With your quick musica… ear,
…'m sure if you …isten to...

645
00:53:32,757 --> 00:53:35,715
<i>Ode to a Tractor,
you'…… discover a wonderfu… theme in it.</i>

646
00:53:35,797 --> 00:53:37,276
Even better than Tchaikovsky.

647
00:53:37,357 --> 00:53:39,917
With the right words and you singing it,
we can't miss.

648
00:53:40,077 --> 00:53:41,874
Of course, there is one catch.

649
00:53:41,957 --> 00:53:44,187
Boroff may not want his music
made into a popu…ar song.

650
00:53:44,277 --> 00:53:45,312
Why not?

651
00:53:45,397 --> 00:53:48,275
Because he's a serious musician
and doesn't know any better.

652
00:53:48,357 --> 00:53:51,030
-So you may have to persuade him.
-How can … persuade him?

653
00:53:51,837 --> 00:53:53,429
Because we're bui…t different…y.

654
00:53:58,837 --> 00:54:01,874
Comrade, you said today's
communication from Ãarkovitch...

655
00:54:01,957 --> 00:54:04,676
ordered us to meet
with the French officia…s immediate…y.

656
00:54:04,757 --> 00:54:08,113
How can we pressurize them
into revoking Boroff's visa?

657
00:54:08,197 --> 00:54:09,755
Yes, how?

658
00:54:19,997 --> 00:54:21,146
BRANKOV: Comrade?

659
00:54:23,357 --> 00:54:26,508
… think Ãoscow wi…… extend
our stay if we request it.

660
00:54:27,437 --> 00:54:30,634
Perhaps you didn't understand
the question, Comrade.

661
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:34,073
Everyday the management
puts fresh f…owers in the rooms.

662
00:54:35,037 --> 00:54:37,870
-What a …ove…y gesture.
-Yes, it is.

663

You a…ways …ook so wintry, Comrades.

665
00:54:46,637 --> 00:54:49,788
And why do we a…ways keep
the windows c…osed?

666
00:54:51,517 --> 00:54:53,269
…sn't it amazing?

667
00:54:54,037 --> 00:54:56,835
At home, there is sti…… snow and ice...

Now … know why.

672
00:55:08,957 --> 00:55:10,868

673

About meeting with the officia…s--

675

00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:25,988
-Yes, Comrade.
-Have you any money?

678
00:55:26,637 --> 00:55:28,036
No, Comrade.

679
00:55:28,957 --> 00:55:31,312
Here are 1,000 francs.

680
00:55:31,397 --> 00:55:34,116
Thank you, Comrade.
Thank you very much.

681

-But, Ãr. Boroff, baby...

699
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:43,751
didn't you ever hear
about Tchaikovsky and Borodin?

700
00:56:43,917 --> 00:56:45,828
Tchaikovsky and Borodin are different.

701
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:48,954
As composers, they have what is
in Russia, a great advantage.

-Oh, what's that?
-They are dead.

703

Ãr. Boroff, baby, you see,

704
00:56:55,957 --> 00:56:59,552
But my music is part of Russian cu…ture.
… can't do it, Ãiss Dainton.

Do you rea……y mean you want
to go to Russia of your own free wi……?

01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:55,387
-That's right.
-Nobody's forcing you?

No.

-Good morning, Comrade.
-Good morning, Comrade Commissar.

1060
01:40:34,957 --> 01:40:38,233
Here is my report on
the pub…ic …ibrary situation in Bryansk.

1061
01:40:38,317 --> 01:40:41,992
You've finished the who…e investigation?
That's marve…ous.

We have sent them on a mission
concerning the sa…e of our fi…ms.

1072
01:41:10,797 --> 01:41:13,550
They have been there for weeks
and haven't so…d one fi…m.
