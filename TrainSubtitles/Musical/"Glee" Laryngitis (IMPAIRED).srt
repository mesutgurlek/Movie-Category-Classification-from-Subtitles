00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:03,842
<i>what happened
last week: Kurt found a video</i>

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:05,610
<i>of Sue, and the glee club
posted it online.</i>

3
00:00:05,678 --> 00:00:07,278
You, my friend,
are an embarrassment.

4
00:00:07,346 --> 00:00:09,481
<i>Then somebody made a "glist"
of who in the glee club</i>

5
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:11,683
<i>was the naughtiest, so Rachel
tried to seem like a bad girl</i>

6
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:13,418
<i>by doing a video
with Finn, Puck and Jessie,</i>

7
00:00:13,486 --> 00:00:14,753
<i>but mostly it just
hurt their feelings</i>

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,087
<i>and the song
was really, really bad.</i>

9
00:00:18,724 --> 00:00:19,958
<i>with Shelby Corcoran
and that, one time,</i>

10
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:21,259
<i>April Rhodes spent the night,</i>

11
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:22,026
<i>which totally hurt
Emma's feelings.</i>

12
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:23,428
I'm through with you.

13
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:24,667
<i>And that's what
you missed on Glee.</i>

14
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:04,602
Who is that guy?

15
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,837
{bell ringing}

16
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:07,605
<i>PUCK:
My mom found a mole on my head</i>

17
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:09,841
when she was washing
my hair on Friday.

18
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:12,143
Your mom still
washes your hair?

19
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:13,144
She started crying
about sun block

20
00:01:13,212 --> 00:01:14,345
and how she's always
telling me

21
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:16,014
to wear a hat
when I'm cleaning pools.

22
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:18,316
So, she made me go see Dr.
Friedlander, the dermatologist.

23
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:21,619
He said he had to shave my head
to get a closer look at it.

24
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:24,589
It was nothing-- they maimed me
over a freaking freckle!

25
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:27,058
I feel like that guy
that lost all his hair,

26
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:28,726
then lost all his strength.

27
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:29,994
Samson?
Agassi.

28
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:31,596
This morning, people
actually had the balls

29
00:01:31,664 --> 00:01:33,097
to look me in the eye.

30
00:01:33,165 --> 00:01:34,632
I mean, it's just
a Mohawk, right?

31
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm still Puckasaurus.

32
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:37,569
Actually, I don't
know if it's

33
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:39,604
the missing Mohawk
or the whining,

34
00:01:39,672 --> 00:01:41,773
but I am totally not
turned on by you right now.

35
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:54,052
You got a problem?

36
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,154
Clearly, you're not a follower

37
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:58,223
of my LarryHair account
on Twitter.

38
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,658
We've been tweeting all day
about your new look.

39
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:03,261
You're like a toddler with
a loose lid on his sippy cup.

40
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:06,030
No more juice.

41
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:07,999
Get ready for payback,
Puckerman.

42
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:10,235
{clucks tongue}

43
00:02:10,302 --> 00:02:11,603
All right.

44
00:02:14,773 --> 00:02:16,040
<i>PUCK:
I'm human garbage.</i>

45
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,111
<i>I should just lie here
until the truck comes</i>

46
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:21,746
<i>and let it crush me to death.</i>

47
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:24,749
<i>What's the point of living
when I suck so bad?</i>

48
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:26,317
{laughter, clapping}

49
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:27,719

51
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,658
<i>That black chick from Glee Club
used to suck,</i>

52
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:35,059

of popular.</i>

herself out, I certainly can.</i>

00:02:38,497 --> 00:02:39,530
<i>But how?</i>

56
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:41,065
<i>I'm not becoming a Cheerio.</i>

57
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:42,500
<i>Wait--</i>

58
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:43,968
<i>I don't need
to be a cheerleader,</i>

59
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:45,870
<i>I just need to date one.</i>

<i>the Puckster is about
to make you his.</i>

63
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:01,653
Um... wait, what are these?

64
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,887
My vitamin supplements.

65
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:04,222
I'm taking them
three times a day.

66
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,957
I'm exhausted.

67
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:08,293
I even felt a tickle
in the back of my throat,

68
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,328
and I never get sick.

69
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:11,996
Well, I just don't understand
why you're so tired

70
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:15,600
all of a sudden.
Because every song I
sing in here is a solo.

71
00:03:15,668 --> 00:03:17,368
<i>As you know,
I have perfect pitch,</i>

72
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:19,637
<i>which also means
I have a very sensitive ear.</i>

73
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:21,906
<i>None of them were singing.</i>

74
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:24,275
<i>I knew I needed proof,
so I had a little talk</i>

75
00:03:24,343 --> 00:03:25,944
<i>with Lauren Zizes,
president of the AV club.</i>

76
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:27,478
Bug the choir room?

77
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:29,781
I'm almost offended by
the simplicity of the request.

78
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:31,049
Just tell me
you can do it, Zizes.

79
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:32,684
The microphones
would have to be hidden.

80
00:03:33,886 --> 00:03:35,420
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?

81
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:39,324
It'll cost you two boxes
of Mallomars for me

82
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:40,725
and Snicker bars for my workers.

who are not pulling
their weight.

95
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:24,402
This is half the club.

Oh, man.

99
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:35,613
Hey, sugar. Listen.

100
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:37,715
I got a proposition
to make.

101
00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:39,183
I did some research.

102
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:42,286
Blacks and Jews have a history
of sticking up for each other.

103
00:04:42,354 --> 00:04:43,421
And Wikipedia says

104
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:45,289
that King Martin Luther
loved the Jews.

105
00:04:45,357 --> 00:04:47,058
Okay, you just said
like ten offensive things.

106
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:48,826
My point is, you're popular now.

107
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:50,361
And I got to be honest--

108
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:52,130
I need to spice up
my image a little.

109
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:53,331
We should join forces.

110
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,632
It wouldn't take much.

111
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,067
Just a little light making out.

112
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:57,468
And I like a girl
with curves.

113
00:04:57,536 --> 00:05:00,538
You got to admit,
I'm easy on the eyes.

114
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:03,474
Baby, I just am not
attracted to you.

115
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:05,476
Plus, I know what you do
to the girls you date.

116
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:08,012
You knock them up, and then
you hang them out to dry.

117
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,881
Quinn and I weren't dating.
She was dating someone else.

118
00:05:09,948 --> 00:05:11,749
We just did the nasty.

119
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:13,418
And she understood
you can't tie me down.

120
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:14,819
I'm a sex shark.

121
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:16,454
If I stop moving, I die.

122
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:18,089
Okay, I'm going to ask you
to stop,

123
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:19,624
because I'm starting
to get embarrassed for you.

124
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:21,692
You and me would not work out.

125
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,394
We have nothing in common.

126
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:25,096
You're Top 40.

127
00:05:25,164 --> 00:05:27,465
I'm rhythm and blues.

128
00:05:29,635 --> 00:05:31,235
{bell ringing}

129
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:33,771
I am very disappointed
in you guys.

130
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,239
Can't believe you narced on us.

131
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:37,108
Don't get mad at me
for exposing your laziness.

132
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:39,744
I'm tired of carrying
all of your weight.

133
00:05:39,812 --> 00:05:41,879
Regionals is in a month, guys.
WILL: I'm just trying

134
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:43,281
to understand
what's going on here.

135
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:45,216
Finn, why did you stop singing?

136
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:47,218
'Cause you started giving
all the male leads to Jessie.

137
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:48,753
It kind of shook my confidence,
you know?

138
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:50,655
{Santana sighs}
What difference does it make?

139
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:52,523
Everyone knows that my job here
is to look hot.

140
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:54,358
My baby hormones
are making me moody.

141
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:56,260
There are so many lyrics.

142
00:05:56,328 --> 00:06:00,331
A chain is only as strong
as its weakest link.

143
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,066
A glee club
is about a myriad of voices

144
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:04,068
coming together as one.

145
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:05,470
All right?

146
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:07,038
This ends now.

147
00:06:07,106 --> 00:06:11,309
Which is why your
assignment for the week

148
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:13,478
is for each of you
to come up with a song

149
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:14,946
that best represents
how you see yourself--

150
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:17,181
where you are
in your lives right now.

151
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:18,516
Your voice.

152
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:21,119
Then...

153
00:06:21,186 --> 00:06:23,621
you're going to stand up here
and sing your hearts out.

154
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:24,722
All of you.

155
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,957
Solos?

156
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:27,892
In front of everyone?
The Glee Club

157
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,460
has lost its voice.

158
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:31,596
It's time for us to get it back.

159
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:33,698
{bell ringing}

160
00:06:33,765 --> 00:06:35,266
I am going to kill
this assignment.

161
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:37,268
If there's one thing that
I know, it's my voice.

162
00:06:37,336 --> 00:06:38,769
I have exactly the
same vocal range

163
00:06:38,837 --> 00:06:40,905
as 16th century castrato
Orlando di Lasso.

164
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:42,573
But you know what
he didn't have?

165
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:45,476
A song by Ms. Whitney Houston
in his back pocket.

166
00:06:45,544 --> 00:06:47,945
Hey, Kurt!

167
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:49,780
Dad? What are you doing here?

168
00:06:49,848 --> 00:06:51,415
Is everything okay?

169
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:52,650
Oh, I'm here to pick up Finn.

170
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:54,619
I got a pair of tickets
to the Reds game,

171
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:56,787
and Carole said that Finn's
never been a major league game.

172
00:06:56,855 --> 00:06:58,289
I mean, it's Cincinnati, so
it's barely the major leagues,

173
00:06:58,357 --> 00:06:59,524
but still.

174
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:01,092
And why wasn't I invited?

175
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,593
{chuckles}
Are you kidding me?

176
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:05,496
Every time I sit down to watch
a game, you start in on the fact

177
00:07:05,564 --> 00:07:07,131
that all the players are
wearing stirrup pants.

178
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,000
Because there's never an excuse
for stirrup pants!

179
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:10,401
FINN: Okay, I'm ready.
All right,

180
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:11,269
I'll meet you
by the car.
Okay.

181
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:12,470
This is gonna be so great.

182
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:13,738
It's gonna be great for Finn.

183
00:07:13,805 --> 00:07:15,439
It means a lot to his mom, too.

184
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:17,441
Hey, I'll see you at home.
I'll be home around midnight.

185
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:22,346
{bell ringing}

186
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:25,983
Girl, you got more curves
than a Nissan ad.

187
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:27,652
Seriously?

188
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:28,920
That's what you
came up with?

189
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:30,121
WILL:
All right, guys.

190
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:31,422
Let's get things started.

191
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,024
As I was first on the
sign-up sheet,

192
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:34,525
I'll kick things off.
Okay.

193
00:07:34,593 --> 00:07:37,662
I have chosen Miley Cyrus'
"The Climb,"

194
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:40,131
because it's about overcoming
obstacles and beating the odds.

195
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,166
In my case,
the obstacle is you--

196
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:43,734
my lackluster teammates

197
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:46,537
who refuse to carry
their own weight.

198
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:51,576
{gentle intro playing}

199
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:57,815
{off key}:
¶¶ I can almost see it ¶¶

200
00:07:57,883 --> 00:07:59,917
¶¶ That dream I'm dreaming ¶¶

201
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:03,721
¶¶ But there's a voice
inside my head saying ¶¶

202
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:08,359
¶¶ "You'll never reach it" ¶¶

203
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:10,661
{voice cracking}:
¶¶ Every step I'm taking ¶¶

204
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:16,434
¶¶ Every move I make feels lost
with no direction ¶¶

205
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:19,203
¶¶ My faith is shaking ¶¶

206
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:25,176
¶¶ But I gotta keep trying ¶¶

207
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:30,615
¶¶ Gotta keep my head
held high... ¶¶

208
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:32,083
WILL:
Rachel...

209
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,952
I think you've lost
your voice.

210
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:40,747
ell ringing}      Hey, Ladyface.

211
00:08:40,814 --> 00:08:43,683
I noticed you weren't at
Cheerios! practice yesterday,

212
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:45,885
and I don't look kindly
on absenteeism.

213
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:47,587
I'm so sorry,
Ms. Sylvester.

214
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:48,888
It won't happen again.

215
00:08:48,956 --> 00:08:51,591
Something happened yesterday
that really upset me.

216
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,192
It's my dad.

217
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,128
He's the most important thing
in the world to me.

218
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:57,196
I love him.

219
00:08:57,264 --> 00:08:59,332
And I'm afraid
that I might be losing him

220
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,069
because of... my... sexuality.

221
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:04,938
Your sexuality.

222
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:06,439
How old are you, 16?

223
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:07,674
Have you even kissed a boy?

224
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:08,875
No.

225
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:10,276
Have you ever kissed
a girl?
No.

226
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:12,345
Well, then how can you possibly
know what you like?

227
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:13,713
You see, that's the problem
with your generation.

228
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:15,581
You're obsessed
with labels.

229
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:16,950
So you like show tunes!

230
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:18,484
Doesn't mean you're gay.

231
00:09:18,552 --> 00:09:19,786
It just means you're awful.

232
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:21,521
You know, there's only

233
00:09:21,588 --> 00:09:25,291
one person in this world
who can tell you what you are.

234
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,526
Me.

235
00:09:26,593 --> 00:09:28,861
No. Me.
Sue Sylvester.

236
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,130
And she hasn't quite
made up her mind about you.

237
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:33,967
Wait--
I have an idea.

238
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:36,302
Our assignment for Glee Club
is to find a song

239
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,071
that reflects our voice...

240
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:39,439
Yeah, you know what?
I checked out

241
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:40,807
of this conversation
about a minute back.

242
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:42,075
So, uh, good luck with
your troubles,

243
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:43,476
and I'm gonna
make a habit

244
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:45,078
not to stop and talk
to students,

245
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:47,880
'cause this has been a
colossal waste of my time.

246
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,324
Hey, Kurt...

247
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:00,727
you want to speak me?

248
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:02,462
Hey, Dad, yeah...
I was just, uh,

249
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,297
working on my Glee Club
assignment,

250
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:06,099
"Pink Houses" by
John Mellencamp.

251
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:09,869
Oh, really?

252
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:11,571
I didn't think that was
in your wheelhouse.

253
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:14,374
Yeah, I think it's really brave
for a Midwesterner like himself

254
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:16,876
to, uh, write a song about
such bold interior design.

255
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:19,512
You know, that's not
what the song's about.

256
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,080
Really?

257
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:24,517
No, it's about how the '80s were
a tough time for a lot of people

258
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:27,053
and how the American Dream
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

259
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:28,287
Hmm.

260
00:10:28,355 --> 00:10:29,589
Fascinating.

261
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:30,990
Hey, why don't
we go grab

262
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:32,925
a couple burgers and, uh,
you can tell me

263
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:34,394
more about it?
Sure.

264
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:36,095
But I gotta be honest,

265
00:10:36,163 --> 00:10:38,598
that's pretty much what every
Mellencamp song is about.

266
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:42,035
But you know what?
I'll get my coat.

267
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:43,936
Anything to help you out.

268
00:10:48,342 --> 00:10:50,743
What if he says
I'll never sing again?

269
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:53,546
I mean, who am I
without my voice?

270
00:10:53,614 --> 00:10:56,682
I'm just this spoiled,
annoying only child...

271
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,084
Don't say that.

272
00:10:58,152 --> 00:11:00,219
There's, like, so many
awesome things about you.

273
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:02,622
Like?

274
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:06,292
Look, he's not gonna say
you'll never sing again.

275
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,328
Bad news, Rachel, you'll
probably never sing again.

276
00:11:09,396 --> 00:11:11,230
I'm kidding.
You have severe tonsillitis,

277
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:13,399
which has resulted in an
inner ear infection.

278
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:15,101
From the looks of things,
it's not the first time.

279
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:17,170
You should have had them out
years ago.
Why should I let you

280
00:11:17,237 --> 00:11:19,138
butcher my throat, when just
resting my voice for a week

281
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:21,074
and chugging down herbal tea
will do the same job?

282
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:23,042
This is
a very serious infection.

283
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,410
I think she's worried

284
00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:26,245
about the surgery affecting
her singing voice.

285
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:28,014
DOCTOR: At least
start by taking

286
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:29,515
these antibiotics.

287
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,250
Unless you think they're going

288
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:32,585
to adversely affect
your dance moves.

289
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:37,657
{sighs}

290
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:41,327
What do you think I should do?

291
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:42,895
Maybe you should ask
your boyfriend.

292
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:44,864
Oh, wait, you can't,
He's not here.

293
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:46,666
He's in San Diego
on spring break

294
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,234
with his friends
from Vocal Adrenaline.

295
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:49,302
When are you gonna
realize that

296
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:50,903
he's not into you like I am?

297
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:54,140
You think he's gonna stick
around if you can't sing?

298
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,608
If you're a vocal cripple?

299
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:58,377
Look, I know that you've always
been jealous of Jessie.

300
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:01,614
And even though
he and I haven't spoken

301
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:02,915
since the "Run Joey Run"
debacle,

302
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,550
you just have
to accept the fact

303
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:08,020
that I still care
about him deeply.

304
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:11,324
And I know he still feels
the same way about me.

305
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:19,432
{guitar plays rock riff}

306
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:26,439
¶¶ Jessie is a friend ¶¶

307
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:30,476
¶¶ You know, he's been
a good friend of mine ¶¶

308
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:32,245
¶¶ But lately,
something's changed ¶¶

309
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:34,280
¶¶ And that ain't hard
to define ¶¶

310
00:12:34,348 --> 00:12:38,284
¶¶ Jessie's got himself a girl,
and I want to make her mine ¶¶

311
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:41,387
¶¶ And she's watching him
with those eyes ¶¶

312
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:45,024
¶¶ And she's loving him with
that body, I just know it ¶¶

Now that-- that is
the kind of

334
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:06,739
soul-exposing song
I was talking about.

335
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:08,441
We should all be inspired
by Finn's bravery.

Good job, buddy.

Uh, Mr. Shue, can I
sing my song now?

00:14:12,012 --> 00:14:13,613
Yeah.
Just go for it, Puck.

What are they doing here?

340
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:22,488
I invited my brothers
from the jazz band

341
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:24,457
and their righteous horns
to help me out with my song.

I started seeing things
differently.

00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:29,695
Last week,
I joined a black church,

345
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:33,165
and I recently downloaded every
song Sammy Davis Jr.

346

ever recorded on iTunes.

347
00:14:34,668 --> 00:14:36,736
He was a black Jew, you know.
And my inspiration.

348
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:39,572
So, without further ado, I give
you one of Sammy's biggest hits.

Look, Quinn,

392
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:30,835
I could never see myself
being into a guy like Puck,

393
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:34,071
especially since
he's your baby's daddy, but...

something just happened
between us.

I say... go for it.

What?
Look...

397
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:44,181
I screwed up by letting
Puck get me pregnant.

398
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:46,884
He's an idiot, and his mother
won't let me eat bacon.

00:17:46,952 --> 00:17:49,153
I'm stuck living
with him right now,

400
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:51,021
but at least, if
you guys are dating,

401
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:53,023
I won't have to spend
so much time listening

on how Super Mario Brothers
changed civilization.

But you do realize

405
00:17:59,097 --> 00:18:00,531
he's using you
and your popularity

406
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,400
so he won't get
tossed in a Dumpster.

407
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:04,568
I know he's using me,

408
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:06,570
but in a way, it's even better.

409
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:08,005
I'm not you.

410
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:10,741
I've never had a guy like me
for anything, but now

411
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:12,643
I'm such a steaming mug
of hot chocolate

412
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:14,712
that one of the studliest guys
in school wants

413
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,514
to use me to harvest some mojo.

00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:19,283
I just don't want
you getting hurt.

415
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:22,019
I know what this is.

416

My heart's safe.

417
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:24,955
Oh, I'm not worried
about your heart.

418
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:26,857
I might be okay with this,

419
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:30,227

that finally expresses
my true voice.

I don't really think you got
the point of the assignment.

00:20:43,628 --> 00:20:45,663
because I thought you
were capital-G Gay.

466
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,364
But now that you're not,

467
00:20:47,432 --> 00:20:50,401
having a perfect record
would mean a lot to me.

468
00:20:50,468 --> 00:20:52,903
So, let me know if
you want to tap this.

469
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:57,207
{bell ringing}

470
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:04,381
Are you, like,
sleepwalking?

471
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:06,750
You have to be able
to sleep to sleepwalk.

472
00:21:06,818 --> 00:21:08,686
I am on my third
day of antibiotics,

473
00:21:08,753 --> 00:21:10,521
and I am not
getting any better,

474
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:12,923
which means, I'm going to
have to have that surgery,

475
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:14,525
which means, my life is over.

476
00:21:14,593 --> 00:21:15,993
Don't you think you're being
a little dramatic,

477
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:17,895
I mean, even for you?

478
00:21:17,963 --> 00:21:20,230
God, I'm so sick of you
feeling sorry for yourself.

479
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:21,498
Why don't you get it?

480
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:22,800
I am my voice.

481
00:21:24,135 --> 00:21:25,369
I am like Tinkerbell, Finn.

482
00:21:25,437 --> 00:21:27,972
I need applause to live.

483
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:31,775
I got a friend
I want you to meet.

484
00:21:31,843 --> 00:21:33,277
Another doctor?
I've seen six already.

485
00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:34,511
No.

486
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:36,113
No. He's an old friend of mine.

487
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:56,795
Your lip gloss
tastes like root beer.

488
00:21:56,863 --> 00:22:00,265
It's weird.

489
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,068
Can I ask you something?

490
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:06,138
What do boys' lips taste like?

491
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:09,241
Usually dip.

492
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:11,176
Sometimes they taste
like burgers.

493
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:13,378
Or my armpits.

494
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:16,214
Kissing my armpits is a really
big turn-on for me.

495
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,217
{door opens and closes}

496
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:25,424
Whoa.

497
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:26,858
Am I interrupting
something?

498
00:22:26,926 --> 00:22:29,461
{with twang}:
You sure are.

499
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:32,431
Okay, I'm confused.

500
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:34,433
I came home to find this note
on your doorknob--

501
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,334
"Do not enter
under any circumstances,

502
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:37,969
I'm making out with a girl."

503
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:39,571
I just thought
it was the start

504
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:41,506
of one of your
murder mystery dinners.

505
00:22:41,574 --> 00:22:44,509
Dad, I really need you
to respect my privacy.

506
00:22:44,577 --> 00:22:48,313
Brittany and I were just, uh,
having sexual relations.

507
00:22:48,381 --> 00:22:51,049
{under breath}:
Hi.

508
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:01,726
Kurt, uh... I've been
sorta dealing for months

509
00:23:01,794 --> 00:23:03,428
with you being gay
and everything,

510
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:05,430
and now you're telling me
that's not the case?

511
00:23:05,498 --> 00:23:06,798
Dad, you and I have
more in common

512
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:08,467
than I would have thought.

513
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:11,970
The flannel, the Mellencamp...
the ladies.

514
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:18,276
Okay, well...

515
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:20,312
you're free to be
whoever you are, okay?

516
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:22,681
You just let me know when
you make up your mind,

517
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:24,983
I'm gonna do the best I can.

518
00:23:25,051 --> 00:23:27,853
But I'm good either way.

519
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:31,790
Nice to meet you.

520
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:33,792
All right, you kids be
careful, all right?

521
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,794
And you gotta respect
her, all right?

522
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:36,928
And if things
get serious,

523
00:23:36,996 --> 00:23:38,363
use protection.

524
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:45,003
Does he mean like
a burglar alarm?

525
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:50,342
{bell ringing}
So what made Super Mario
Brothers 3 so amazing

526
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:52,577
was the Star Worlds.

527
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:54,646
None of the other versions
had anything like that.

528
00:23:54,714 --> 00:23:57,382
Look, Puck, I agreed
to start dating you

529
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,783
because you have great arms,

530
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:00,986
and we have serious
musical chemistry--

531
00:24:01,053 --> 00:24:02,988
both of which are really
important to me.

532
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:04,923
But clearly you've never dated
a sister before.

533
00:24:04,991 --> 00:24:06,858
And we have needs--

534
00:24:06,926 --> 00:24:08,627
as in you need to stop
flapping your gums

535
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:10,362
about this video game nonsense

536
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:13,031
and start finding out more
about me, about who I am.

537
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:14,566
Okay.

538
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:17,335
I've never done that with a
girl before, but I'm cool.

539
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:18,870
First thing
you need to know is

540
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:20,939
I like those
frozen coffee drinks.

541
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:22,941
Do you want me to
get you one?

542
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:24,743
Decaf.
Cool.

543
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:36,021
What was that?

544
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:38,123
Whatever I did, I'm-I'm sorry.

545
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:41,026
Here, take my lunch money
as an apology.

546
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:42,494
Put that away.

547
00:24:42,562 --> 00:24:44,296
Why didn't you look at me
when I walked by?

548
00:24:44,363 --> 00:24:47,465
Well, the Tweetosphere says
you're dating Mercedes Jones.

549
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:49,935
She's one of the most popular
girls in school.

550
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:51,770
Your cool-o-meter is
off the charts.

551
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,104
Which means most of us
are terrified

552
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:54,372
of you again.

553
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,707
Some of the guys
who threw you

554
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:57,309
in the Dumpster
actually transferred today,

555
00:24:57,376 --> 00:25:00,212
out of fear of retaliation.

556
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:06,051
I didn't say you could smile.

557
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:08,653
Give me that lunch money.
Also, my girl needs
a coffee drink.

558
00:25:19,365 --> 00:25:22,100
{"The Boy Is Mine" intro
by Brandy playing}

559
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:27,539
Excuse me, can I please
talk to you for a minute?

560
00:25:27,607 --> 00:25:29,207
Uh-huh, sure.

561
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:31,076
You know you look
kind of familiar.

562
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:33,144
Yeah, you do, too, but, um,

563
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:35,747
I just wanted to know,
do you know somebody named--

564
00:25:35,815 --> 00:25:37,716
you know his name.

565
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:40,318
Oh, yeah, definitely,
I know his name.

566
00:25:40,386 --> 00:25:42,554
I just wanted to let you know
he's mine.

567
00:25:42,622 --> 00:25:44,889
No, no, he's mine.

WILL:
That was intense.

610
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:22,554
Don't touch me.
Don't step to me.

611
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:23,688
I gotta give you guys props
for the passion.

612
00:27:23,756 --> 00:27:25,123
Maybe hold back on
the animosity

613
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:27,192
Hey, hey, hey!

614
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:28,893
Seriously,
this ends now!

615
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:30,228
All right.
Talk to the stick
figure.

616
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:32,297
Please. All right?

617
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:34,366
You can go at it in song,
but that is it.

618
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:36,468
Enjoy it while you can, Weezie.

619
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:39,437
His hair is already
starting to grow back.

620
00:27:39,505 --> 00:27:40,605
Calm down.
Hey, hey.

621
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,144
Puck, what the hell
is going on here?

622
00:27:58,212 --> 00:27:59,278
Just a little payback.

623
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,446
{thud}

624
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:01,948
You hear that?

625
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:04,483
That's the sound of order
being restored.

626
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:06,652
No man of mine is gonna be
pulling stuff like this.

627
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,087
Babe, this is what we do.

628
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:09,155
Look at 'em.

629
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:10,289
They need this.

630
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,791
Without the fear
of a good Dumpster toss,

631
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,559
it'd be chaos
up in this place.

632
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:15,995
Look, you don't need to like it,
but you need to accept it--

633
00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:17,263
this is the way
things are.

634
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:18,564
'Cause now, we're part
of the system.

635
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:20,600
We're at the top
of the heap.

636
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,034
Who's next?

637
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:25,638
{doorbell ringing}

638
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:28,074
Hi, uh, Mrs. Fretthold.

639
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:29,375
This is Rachel.

640
00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:30,610
Pretty.

641
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:32,612
Uh, I'll tell Sean
you're here.

642
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:34,614
I'm sorry it's
such a mess.

643
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:36,749
I've been on the phone to the
insurance company all day.

644
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:38,851
Oh, no, that's fine.

645
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:39,986
Is this him?

646
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,587
FINN:
Uh, yeah.

647
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:44,056
We met at football camp
a couple years ago.

648
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:45,391
He's ready for you.

649
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:48,728
SEAN:
Fab-five-Finnster!

650
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:50,363
Fretter!

651
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,298
{chuckles}

652
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:54,934
This the hottie
you were telling me about?

653
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:56,802
Yeah. Sean Fretthold,
Rachel Berry,

654
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,837
Rachel, Sean.

655
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,572
Got a boyfriend, Rachel?

656
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,440
Um... sort of.

657
00:29:01,508 --> 00:29:03,242
Sort of?

658
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,411
Sounds like I got a shot.

659
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,480
{whispering}: I don't
understand; this isn't funny.

660
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:09,015
Sorry.

661
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:10,216
They make me see a shrink.

662
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:13,119
He says I compensate with humor.

663
00:29:16,323 --> 00:29:20,126
Third game of the season,
right after I met the Finnster,

664
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:23,929
this Yeti of a fullback
breaks through the line.

665
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:29,335
I hear a crack,
next thing I know,

666
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:32,938
I'm lying on the ground
saying to myself,

667
00:29:33,006 --> 00:29:35,374
"Get up, get up,"

668
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:38,511
but nothing was working,
you know?

669
00:29:38,578 --> 00:29:40,146
Sean was a C4.

670
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:42,415
Paralyzed from
the upper chest down.

671
00:29:42,482 --> 00:29:44,483
I'm so sorry.

672
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:46,519
Finn says your voice
is messed up.

673
00:29:48,488 --> 00:29:49,889
Is it going to come back?

674
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,558
I don't, I don't,
I don't know.

675
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,160
Pissed off about what you lost?

676
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:58,164
I was.

677
00:29:58,231 --> 00:30:02,068
Like, real... rage.

678
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:06,172
I used to just lie in bed
and scream.

679
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:07,740
Finn shouldn't have brought me
here. I'm so sorry.

680
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:08,541
Wait, wait, wait.

681
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:10,776
Just...

682
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:13,479
tell her about what
happened when they
gave you the chair.

683
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:20,019
They were all excited

684
00:30:20,087 --> 00:30:21,954
because I could
drive it myself

685
00:30:22,022 --> 00:30:25,658
by blowing in that tube.

686
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:28,761
The second they left me alone...

687
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:32,264
I drove it
into the swimming pool.

688
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:35,000
His mom pulled him out
when she heard the splash.

689
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:36,469
I don't understand.

690
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:38,904
Are... Are you trying
to tell me

691
00:30:38,972 --> 00:30:40,139
that you're happier now?

692
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:41,507
SEAN:
Hell, no.

693
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:44,510
I'm miserable.

694
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:46,512
I miss my body.

695
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,281
I miss my life.

696
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,284
I miss my friends.

697
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,320
I miss girls.

698
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:57,690
But I've realized, over time,

699
00:30:57,758 --> 00:31:00,092
that I've got other stuff
going on.

700
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,662
I'm more than
just one thing.

701
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,764
You know I'm good at math?

702
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:07,900
Seriously.

703
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:10,770
I flew through Calc I
in like two months.

704
00:31:10,837 --> 00:31:12,338
And I can sing.

705
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:15,074
He's actually pretty good.

706
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:18,577
I used to sing in the shower,
in the car...

707
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:21,147
I didn't have the balls

708
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:23,249
to try out for my school's club
like Finn did.

709
00:31:25,452 --> 00:31:27,353
That pissed me off
more than anything.

710
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:31,657
What the hell was I afraid of?

711
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:33,893
{knocking on door}
Sorry, guys,

712
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,828
time for physical therapy.
FINN:
Later, dude.

713
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:38,497
Um, I'll come by
in a few weeks.

714
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:40,399
I'll be here.

715
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:42,067
Thanks.

716
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:43,102
For what?

717
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:49,208
Just, um... thanks.

718
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,818
Hey, mama.

719
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:01,120
Where's your Cheerios! uniform?

720
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:02,488
I quit.

721
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:04,223
Nobody quits the Cheerios!

722
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,591
You either die,
or I kick you off.

723
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:08,594
It was fun, I guess, but...

724
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:11,430
when I put the uniform on,
I didn't feel like myself.

725
00:32:12,866 --> 00:32:13,832
It's just not who I am.

726
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,200
And what am I supposed to do

727
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:16,568
about that Mariah Carey number

728
00:32:16,636 --> 00:32:18,437
in which you do ten straight
minutes of vocal runs?

729
00:32:18,505 --> 00:32:20,039
Huh? Nationals is
in three weeks!

730
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:21,340
I guess I'll just

731
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:24,209
have to take to the mic
and deliver a diatribe.

732
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:26,211
Probably something
about immigrants.

733
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,714
Look, I know Glee Club may
be super nerdy or whatever,

734
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:30,716
but it's taught me
something very important.

735
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:32,684
You have to be true
to who you are.

736
00:32:32,752 --> 00:32:34,620
That's something
you may want think about.

737
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:36,088
'Cause the guy I saw

738
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:37,823
throwing dweebs
in the Dumpster yesterday--

739
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:39,658
I don't like him very much.

740
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:41,393
And you know what?

741
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:42,728
I don't think
you do, either.

742
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:48,967
{bell ringing}

743
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:50,936
Your hands are really soft.

744
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:53,072
My secret? Duck fat.

745
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:54,440
Hey, guys.

746
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:56,775
Just holding hands
with Brittany.

747
00:32:56,843 --> 00:32:58,077
Seriously.
They feel like a baby.

748
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,112
Now I know what it's
like to date a baby.

749
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,947
Hey, Kurt.

750
00:33:02,015 --> 00:33:04,383
Dad. Hey.

751
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:06,285
Finn caught a foul ball
inhe ninth,

752
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:08,187
so that means free hoagies
at Lenny's Hoagies,

753
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:10,823
and then half-price
to the motocross tonight,

754
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,092
so I promised
I'd take him. Hi.

755
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,094
Can you excuse us
for a minute, boo?

756
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:16,695
What?
Just go away.

757
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:20,833
Did you ever think that
that might be something I wanted

758
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,601
to do with you?

759
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:25,270
Look, Kurt, Finn needs
a buddy right now, okay?

760
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:27,873
At the game, he got
to talking about his dad,

761
00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:29,274
and, you know,
his mom thinks

762
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:30,909
it's a really
good thing for him.

763
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:32,344
Look, I promise you

764
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:34,880
we will hang out
as much as you want, okay?

765
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:36,815
Just not tonight.

766
00:33:41,654 --> 00:33:45,190
¶¶ All that work
and what did it get me? ¶¶

767
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:50,362
¶¶ Why did I do it? ¶¶

768
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:54,967
¶¶ Scrapbooks full of me
in the background ¶¶

769
00:33:56,903 --> 00:34:00,439
¶¶ Give 'em love
and what does it get ya? ¶¶

770
00:34:00,507 --> 00:34:02,307
¶¶ What does it get ya? ¶¶

771
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:06,612
¶¶ One quick look
as each of 'em leaves you ¶¶

772
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:09,181
¶¶ All your life
and what does it get ya? ¶¶

773
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:11,717
¶¶ Thanks a lot
and out with the garbage ¶¶

774
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:14,987
¶¶ They take bows
and you're battin' zero ¶¶

775
00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:22,861
¶¶ I had a dream ¶¶

776
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:27,499
¶¶ I dreamed it for you, Dad ¶¶

777
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:31,537
¶¶ It wasn't for me, Dad ¶¶

778
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:34,573
¶¶ And if it wasn't for me ¶¶

779
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:36,508
¶¶ Then where would you be ¶¶

780
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:43,115
¶¶ Miss Rachel Berry? ¶¶

781
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:46,652
¶¶ Well, someone tell me
when is it my turn? ¶¶

782
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,654
¶¶ Don't I get a dream
for myself? ¶¶

783
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:50,923
¶¶ Starting now,
it's gonna be my turn ¶¶

784
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,824
¶¶ Gangway, world,
get off of my runway! ¶¶

785
00:34:52,892 --> 00:34:55,027
¶¶ Starting now
I bat a thousand! ¶¶

786
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:59,364
¶¶ This time, boys,
I'm taking the bows and... ¶¶

787
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:03,735
¶¶ Everything's coming up Kurt! ¶¶

788
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:07,472
¶¶ Everything's coming up
Hummel! ¶¶

789
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,576
¶¶ Everything's coming up Kurt! ¶¶

790
00:35:10,643 --> 00:35:12,978
¶¶ This time for me! ¶¶

791
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:14,746
{laughs}

792
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:16,648
¶¶ For me! ¶¶

793
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:19,918
¶¶ For me! ¶¶

794
00:35:19,986 --> 00:35:21,019
¶¶ For me! ¶¶

795
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:22,821
¶¶ For me! ¶¶

796
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:24,022
¶¶ For me! ¶¶

797
00:35:26,025 --> 00:35:34,333
¶¶ For... me! ¶¶

798
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,001
¶¶ Yeah! ¶¶

799
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,004
{song ends,
one person clapping}

800
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,011
That was some
serious singing, kid.

801
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,448
That was "Rose's Turn."

802
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:52,050
I could get into that, maybe.

803
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:54,019
What happened
to the hoagies?

804
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:55,654
Ah, blew it off.

805
00:35:55,722 --> 00:35:57,522
You know, too much cholesterol.

806
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,725
I bet Finn was disappointed.

807
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:01,627
He understood, uh...

808
00:36:01,694 --> 00:36:04,896
once I told him how bent out
of shape I thought you were.

809
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:07,532
Me? I'm fine.

810
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,702
Kurt, I'm dumb,
but I'm not stupid.

811
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,238
And I have no idea

812
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:14,873
what that song was about,

813
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:16,775
but "fine" don't sing
like you just sung.

814
00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:20,646
Look...

815
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:25,751
...maybe I got carried away
doing stuff with Finn.

816
00:36:25,818 --> 00:36:28,887
But I told you, this thing
with you was going to be hard.

817
00:36:28,955 --> 00:36:30,289
Thing with me.

818
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:31,556
You mean being gay?

819
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:33,392
Yeah.

820
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:34,526
Being gay.

821
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:37,562
Look, I will fight to the death

822
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,565
for your right to love
whoever you want,

823
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:43,001
but when you were a
little baby in my arms,

824
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:44,903
did I dream about taking
you to baseball games

825
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:46,972
and talking about girls?

826
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,707
Yeah, I did.

827
00:36:48,775 --> 00:36:50,108
A lot of fathers do.

828
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:52,110
I had no idea
how disappointing I was.

829
00:36:52,178 --> 00:36:54,079
Hey, come on, now,
stop it right now.

830
00:36:54,147 --> 00:36:55,414
I'm-I'm talking
straight to you.

831
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:57,883
Don't go playing
the victim.

832
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,685
You know that's
not what I mean.

833
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:01,553
{crying}:
I know.

834
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:03,655
I'm sorry.

835
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,657
I know you're working hard
on yourself

836
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:07,192
to make all this okay.

837
00:37:08,695 --> 00:37:10,662
Just seeing you,

838
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,764
the way you are with Finn,

839
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,866
how easy it is...

840
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:20,639
{voice breaks}:
It breaks my heart.

841
00:37:20,707 --> 00:37:23,775
Is that why you were pretending
to date that daffy cheerleader?

842
00:37:23,843 --> 00:37:26,645
And dressing differently,
and singing Mellencamp?

843
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:28,980
I just want you
to know that...

844
00:37:29,048 --> 00:37:32,184
I'm going to work as hard
as you to make this okay.

845
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,354
You don't have to work
at anything, Kurt.

846
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,491
Your job...

847
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,760
is to be yourself,

848
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:44,329
and my job is to love you,

849
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:46,331
no matter what.

850
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:48,166
Okay? That
and a majority ownership

851
00:37:48,234 --> 00:37:50,569
in a tire store--
that's all we got.

852
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:54,439
Okay? We stick to that,
we're going to be great.

853
00:37:54,507 --> 00:37:57,075
I missed you, Dad.

854
00:37:57,143 --> 00:37:58,777
Oh, come here.

855
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:05,016
I love you.

856
00:38:05,084 --> 00:38:07,819
Love you, too.

857
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:11,590
Mom...

858
00:38:19,899 --> 00:38:22,100
Finn with you?

859
00:38:22,168 --> 00:38:23,735
No, I came by myself.

860
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:25,103
Is that okay?

861
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:27,038
Yeah.

862
00:38:27,106 --> 00:38:30,409
I, um... I just

863
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:32,644
wanted to say thank you,

864
00:38:32,712 --> 00:38:34,746
and for showing me that

865
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:37,282
just because I'm not good

866
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,418
at anything other
than singing doesn't mean

867
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,453
I'm not any good
if I can't sing.

868
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:47,526
That sounded like
a really bad greeting card.

869
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:49,428
No. It was cool.

870
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:52,764
Well, anyways, I...

871
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:55,467
I just thought I could
maybe return the favor.

872
00:38:55,535 --> 00:38:58,570
I thought I could give you
singing lessons.

873
00:38:58,638 --> 00:39:01,306
It sort of seemed like
an area of interest for you.

874
00:39:01,374 --> 00:39:03,241
I'll-I'll come by,

875
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:05,777
like, once a week or
something, and we could just

876
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:07,245
see how it goes?

877
00:39:07,313 --> 00:39:09,581
I've-I've helped almost everyone
in our glee club,

878
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:10,949
some by brute force, but...

879
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:13,285
So, your voice came back.

880
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:17,255
Turns out that a heroic dose
of antibiotics

881
00:39:17,323 --> 00:39:19,591
and a mysterious blend
of herbal remedies

882
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:22,027
and a vow of silence
is all it takes

883
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:24,196
to cure tonsillitis, so...

884
00:39:24,263 --> 00:39:25,597
I'll probably have

885
00:39:25,665 --> 00:39:27,666
to have my tonsils taken
out eventually, but, um,

886
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:30,402
I'm-I'm not scared anymore.

887
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:33,038
{laughs softly}

888
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:35,106
Uh, so...

889
00:39:35,174 --> 00:39:37,676
do you want
to give it a spin now?

890
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:40,812
Sing with you?

891
00:39:41,948 --> 00:39:44,049
Yeah.

892
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:45,684
Yeah, I'd be honored.

893
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,385
Come here.

894
00:39:51,257 --> 00:39:53,124
Take my hand?

895
00:39:57,263 --> 00:39:58,997
Can you feel that?

896
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:00,198
No.

897
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:01,733
But it's weird.

898
00:40:01,801 --> 00:40:03,835
I remember what it feels like,

899
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:06,538
and I can see it, so...

900
00:40:06,606 --> 00:40:09,207
it's like I can.

901
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,644
I-I, um...

902
00:40:12,712 --> 00:40:14,145
{clears throat}

903
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:16,147
I thought we'd
do a little

904
00:40:16,215 --> 00:40:18,283
classic rock today.

905
00:40:18,351 --> 00:40:20,752
Finn said you
might like that.

906
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,153
Yeah.

907
00:40:22,221 --> 00:40:26,658
¶¶ Is it getting better? ¶¶

908
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:33,765
¶¶ Or do you feel the same? ¶¶

909
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:39,137
¶¶ Will it make it easier
on you now? ¶¶

¶¶ You got someone to blame? ¶¶

917
00:41:14,507 --> 00:41:20,011

918
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,983
¶¶ You act
like you never had love ¶¶

919
00:41:25,051 --> 00:41:28,520
¶¶ And you want me
to go without ¶¶

920
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:32,857
BOTH:
¶¶ Well, it's too late ¶¶

921
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:34,926

into the light ¶¶

923

926
00:41:52,745 --> 00:41:55,380
¶¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah ¶¶

00:41:55,448 --> 00:41:58,583
