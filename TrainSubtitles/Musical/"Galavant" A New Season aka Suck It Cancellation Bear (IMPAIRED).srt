Here it is... Be my assistant.

325
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:23,592
This is the kingdom's charter.

326
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:27,930
It outlines the changes of power
when a king is deposed.

327
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:30,065
But I can't read.

328
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:34,069
Aww, Gareth, are you asking me
to teach you to read?

329
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,539
No. Reading's for morons
who can't understand pictures.

330
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,773
Just read it!

331
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:43,745
10 more minutes of outside time, my lady.

332
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:46,148
[Sighs] Yeah. Not a prison at all, mom.

333
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:48,383
There's my beautiful bride-to-be!

334
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:50,853
Jester, Jester, do it for the Princess.

335
00:13:50,854 --> 00:13:52,621
- Pbht!
- [Laughs]

336
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:54,623
[Laughing] Every time, he gets me.

337
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:56,191
- Pbht!
- Stop! I'm gonna pee myself!

338
00:13:56,192 --> 00:13:57,392
Pbht! Pbht!

339
00:13:57,393 --> 00:14:00,162
Oops. I did. Let me down.

340
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:03,098
[Chuckles] Great kid.

341
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:05,033
Oh, he's gonna make a wonderful
husband, your cousin.

342
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:07,169
I mean, once he stops peeing himself.

343
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,337
[Sighs]

344
00:14:08,338 --> 00:14:11,273
I feel like I've been drinking crazy grog.

345
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:13,575
- How can you be happy about this?
- You kidding?

346
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:15,277
This is the easiest gig I've ever had.

347
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:17,379
It's all fart noises and
poop jokes with this kid.

348
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,381
I haven't had to write
new material for months.

349
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:21,450
And, truth be told, it's given me time

350
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:23,018
to work on my real passion.

351
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,752
I'm trying to break into drama.

352
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:27,689
Pbht!

353
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,790
So sorry.

354
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,659
I can't handle a moment's silence.

355
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,461
What's wrong with me? Pbht.

356
00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:33,261
[Sighs]

357
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,133
[Chuckles]

358
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:40,002
- Chef. Gwynne.
- Milady.

359
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:42,304
You two have to help me escape
and find Galavant.

360
00:14:42,305 --> 00:14:44,106
You must see how insane this all is.

361
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:47,876
I do hate the idea of you being
forced into marriage.

362
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:49,811
I'm kind of big into women's rights.

363
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:50,779
He really is.

364
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,414
He said he's gonna let me keep

365
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,950
our first daughter and not
just throw them all out.

366
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:56,218
[Chuckles]

367
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:59,655
The guards... they ordered
a lot of room service.

368
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:02,457
Let me see if I can't slip them
some sleepy-time pie

369
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,559
and get you a key.

370
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,761
[Exhales sharply] You're so kind.

371
00:15:05,762 --> 00:15:07,195
One daughter!

372
00:15:07,196 --> 00:15:09,530
Then we leave the rest
to the white walkers.

373
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:13,134
Men.

374
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:18,206
Excuse me. Sorry.

375
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:19,608
Pardon me. Pardon me.

376
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:21,276
Excuse me. Excuse me.

377
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:22,878
Need another round of mead lights

378
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,046
for Philip and Sebastian, please.

379
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:25,948
Hello?

380
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:27,516
Galavant!

381
00:15:27,517 --> 00:15:28,849
Galavant?

382
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:33,689
[Exhales heavily] Tried to escape.

383
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,157
Made it all the way to the door,

384
00:15:35,158 --> 00:15:37,392
but my hands were too cold
from mixing slushy drinks.

385
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:38,727
We are wasting time.

386
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:41,430
Relax, my brother from another.

387
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:43,432
Have a drink. Feel the beat.

388
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:44,666
[Chuckling] Oh, that reminds me.

389
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,168
Bear told me a ripper.

390
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:47,436
A bear walks into a bar...

391
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:49,037
Oh, you're having fun. I'm so glad

392
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:51,273
because the people I care about
are in real trouble.

393
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:52,240
Well, I'm sorry.

394
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,842
I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

395
00:15:53,843 --> 00:15:54,910
Well, stop trying.

396
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:56,211
The more you try, the worse it gets.

397
00:15:56,212 --> 00:15:57,713
Just stay out of my way.

398
00:15:57,714 --> 00:16:00,047
Fine, but from now on,
we're pooling our tips!

399
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:04,152
Who doesn't like to hear a good bear joke?

400
00:16:04,153 --> 00:16:06,020
Bears are funny. I'm so...

401
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:09,791
Uncle Keith!

402
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:12,160
Shh! Shh! Shh!

403
00:16:12,161 --> 00:16:13,695
Dad said you entered the enchanted forest

404
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:14,463
and never came out.

405
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:16,832
The other way 'round, kid.

406
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,633
Huh?

407
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:21,436
I<i> belong</i> here.

408
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:24,172
Your father... God rest his soul...

409
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:26,375
He<i> belonged</i> here. [Gasps]

410
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:28,377
Was he an alcoholic, too?

411
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:31,279
But you<i> don't</i> belong here.

412
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,048
I'm going to help you escape.

413
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:36,118
Marvelous!

414
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:39,521
Okay. Maybe you do belong here.

415
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:40,888
Oh, this is gonna be fun!

416
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,494
Why is she making us watch her
eat our chicken?

417
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:50,828
What do you mean, "our chicken"?

418
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:51,763
It was my egg first.

419
00:16:51,764 --> 00:16:52,830
It weren't. I had it first.

420
00:16:52,831 --> 00:16:53,932
- I found it!
- This is why.

421
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:56,087
This is why you're watching.

422
00:16:56,168 --> 00:16:59,971
Queenie, I need to talk
to you about my title.

423
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:02,774
Now, I helped you overthrow a king.

424
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:04,075
You helped your friend escape

425
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:05,742
and watched as I killed his replacement.

426
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,583
I'm sick of not being treated as an equal.

427
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:14,052
I'm sick of having to park my horse

428
00:17:14,053 --> 00:17:16,488
in the stable with the assistants!

429
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:21,025
Look, according to the scrolls
I have had read to me,

430
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:22,794
I banished the king.

431
00:17:22,795 --> 00:17:27,065
So, technically, I am
the true king of Valencia.

432
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:31,436
And it would really mean a lot
to me if I was treated as such.

433
00:17:31,437 --> 00:17:34,471
What is it with men and their<i> emotions?</i>

434
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:39,110
Fine. You're king.

435
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:40,344
Yes!

436
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,015
Oi. Say it.

437
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:49,887
Man: Presenting the queen
and king of Valencia!

438
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:52,824
Oh, you don't think...

439
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:54,958
- We're not changing the order.
- Nah, it's great. It's fine.

440
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,531
Psst! Hey!

441
00:17:59,532 --> 00:18:00,565
I got us a way out of here,

442
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:02,000
but you got to follow me right now.

443
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:03,868
We don't have much time
before the music starts.

444
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:05,803
All right, sure. I'll listen to you...

445
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:07,005
Like when I listened to you

446
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:08,473
about when we were gonna come ashore

447
00:18:08,474 --> 00:18:10,108
or maybe when I listened to you about...

448
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:11,342
[thud]

449
00:18:11,343 --> 00:18:12,510
I want you to know

450
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:14,245
that hurt me a lot more than it hurt you.

451
00:18:14,246 --> 00:18:15,045
Come on.

452
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:19,751
Use your core, Richard. Use your core.

453
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:21,619
Where is my core?

454
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,620
- [Groans]
- Oh, there it is.

455
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:24,822
Ah, you're waking up. Excellent.

456
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:26,691
Good morning, sunshine.

457
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:28,359
Aah! Ow!

458
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,661
What are you doing?

459
00:18:29,662 --> 00:18:30,561
I'm rescuing us.

460
00:18:32,197 --> 00:18:34,098
What, through the ladies room?

461
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:36,167
This is your dumb plan?

462
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:38,169
[Door creaks]

463
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,939
[Birds chirping]

464
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,008
The bar needed a ladies room
built to be up to code,

465
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:45,376
but no one was ever going to use it,

466
00:18:45,377 --> 00:18:46,744
so they didn't bother to finish it.

467
00:18:46,745 --> 00:18:48,613
[Chuckles] You know you just...

468
00:18:48,614 --> 00:18:49,881
Saved the day?

469
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:50,748
Yeah.

470
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:51,616
I know.

471
00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:53,785
I can't take all the credit.

472
00:18:53,786 --> 00:18:57,088
Galavant, I want you
to meet my Uncle Keith.

473
00:18:57,089 --> 00:18:58,156
Galavant.

474
00:18:58,157 --> 00:18:59,357
Thank you, sir.

475
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:00,625
We are indebted to you, Uncle,

476
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:02,694
- forever and always.
- It's nothing.

477
00:19:02,695 --> 00:19:04,596
Are you certain we can't
convince you to come with us?

478
00:19:04,597 --> 00:19:07,799
No, son. My Destiny is here.

479
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,769
Destiny, this is Richard. Richard, Destiny.

480
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,904
Hello.

481
00:19:12,905 --> 00:19:13,905
Hi.

Man #2: Galavant!

484
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:18,476
You must go now!

485
00:19:18,477 --> 00:19:19,477
I'll miss you.

486
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:21,245
Godspeed.

487
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:22,780
Let's boogie!

00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:23,781
Hello.

489
00:19:23,782 --> 00:19:26,150
Yeah.

490
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:28,486
[Birds chirping]

491
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:30,555
[Breathing heavily]

492
00:19:30,556 --> 00:19:32,156
Hey!

493
00:19:32,157 --> 00:19:34,158
This is a silly question.

494
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:36,394
Do you think my Uncle Keith might be...

495
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:37,428
Yes, Richard.

496
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:39,263
Wow.

497
00:19:39,264 --> 00:19:40,829
You think Destiny knows?

498
00:19:42,434 --> 00:19:44,736
You know what? I owe you an apology

499
00:19:44,737 --> 00:19:46,671
'cause you really came through
for us today.

500
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:47,804
Thank you.

501
00:19:48,674 --> 00:19:50,508
I know you don't think much of me,

502
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:52,844
and I know I screw everything up
all the time,

503
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:55,680
but you have to understand,
I was coddled my entire life.

504
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:56,814
I know.

505
00:19:56,815 --> 00:19:58,416
I was breastfed until I was 9.

506
00:19:58,417 --> 00:19:59,684
I kno... wait. What?

507
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:02,453
- I had a nanny named Pearl...
- No, I don't want to know.

508
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:04,455
The point is, today's a new day.

509
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:06,958
This is a new chapter in your life.

510
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:09,260
You got to find your inner king.

511
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:11,162
You really think so?

512
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:13,096
I do.
