But, Father Fitzgibbon,
why do you want a new furnace?

3
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,752
Because, Mr. Haines, last winter,
in the month of November alone...

4
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,479
four of me parishioners
took to the bed with pneumonia.

5
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,675
That's too bad.

6
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,513
It's only by a miracle
that I meself pulled through.

7
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,390
It'll only cost $632.50...

complete with an automatic damper.

9
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,318
But, Father, I didn't come here
to put in new furnaces.

10
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,470
I think you ought to give him
his furnace, Dad.

11
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,996
It would warm people's hearts,
and maybe his collections would be bigger.

12
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,390
No, Son. Improvements are out.
Now, Father...

That was good.
What he said, that was good.

Well, he's new to our business.
Now, Father...

15

- No furnace?
- No furnace.

16
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,238
Now, Father, here's my business.

will have to take the necessary action.

It's the principle of the thing.

A priest shouldn't go around

Why don't you keep them until I've made
good? Maybe they'll make you feel better.

First place, I don't believe in it.

How does your new pastor impress you?

Yes, it would be much better.

So long.

- Yeah.

Yes, I was going to ask...

You were going to ask me
if I want to see the church.

I built as much.

it was our understanding...

that Father Fitzgibbon
was to remain here as pastor...

254

St. Dominic's without hurting his feelings.

283
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,354
Inasmuch as Mrs. Quimp
declines to pay her rent...

284
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,431
the Knickerbocker Savings
and Loan Company...

285
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,354
- refuses to offer her any further hospitality.
- Is she very far in arrears?

286
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,715
TED: Mrs. Quimp has paid us nothing
for six months.

287
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,473

to show her leniency.

00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,472
Supposing the poor old woman
has no place to go?

289
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,678
The Knickerbocker Savings and Loan
Company is not a charitable institution...

290
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,432
like St. Dominic's.

291
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,233
With us, it's just a matter
of cold-blooded business.

292
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,108
With you it's different. You haven't got
anything and you don't want anything.

293
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,839
That's your business
and people respect you for it.

294
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,717
But I'm not in your business, see?

295
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,554
If I haven't got anything
and don't want anything, I'm a bum.

296
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,235
Surely there must be something
we can do about it.

297
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,393
I don't know what you'll do about it, but
I'm going to throw her right out on her ear.

298

I can see you haven't been around long.

301
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,559
Why, St. Dominic's is in worse shape
than Mrs. Quimp.

- Your father holds the mortgage?

You're darn right he does.

304
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,074
Confidentially,
he'd like to find a way to foreclose.

305
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,993
He wants to tear down the church
and make a parking lot of it.

306
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,072
Can you imagine it?
He's a very disliked man.

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,833
That's a fine fat bird you have there.

314
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,070
We was sort of bringing it over for you.

315
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,357
- It's sort of a present. Ain't it, Herman?
- Yeah.

316
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,069
That's very generous of you.
Such a fine bird and all.

317
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,154
Now, where may I ask did you get it?

318
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,118
- We got...
- We won it in a raffle over at the theatre.

319
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,112
- We were lucky.
- Isn't that great?

- Except on Christmas, Ma don't like turkey.

- She don't?
- Honest.

That's most fortunate for me.

There's nothing I'm more partial to
than a nice tom turkey.

around here named Tony Scaponi?

341

FITZGIBBON: What about him?
O'MALLEY: This afternoon...

342
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,635
Tony belongs to
a fine upstanding Catholic family.

343
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,910
Eleven children. Sure, I know Tony.
As fine a lad as there is in the parish.

344
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,319
Police don't think so.

- No.

they're gonna wind up in a reform school.

- Who told you that?
- The police.

349

You've been listening
to Patrick McCarthy, no doubt.

350

Let me tell you that that man
hasn't been to Mass in the last <i>1</i>0 years.

351
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,789
That may be, but I think
McCarthy's right about those kids.

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,792
They're terrorising
the whole neighbourhood.

No use talking like that.

354

To hear the police talk, you'd think
that every lad in the parish was a criminal.

355
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,560
I'll have you know
that the very food there before us...

356
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,997
is brought to us by two of those very lads
the police are so maliciously slandering.

Is that so?

358
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,710
Tony Scaponi was one of them.

- I follow you.

So, anyway, she tells us
that she's run away from home...

Father O'Malley, I've been to see the Bishop.

Oh, you have?

752

And I want to be frank with you.

753
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,115
I must admit that my purpose
in going to see the Bishop...

754
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,670
was to have you transferred.

I'm sorry you don't like me, Father.

After a little talk, he congratulated me...

on me 45 years at St. Dominic's.

He has a remarkable memory.

He said it was a monument...

to the fact that I had built it.

Coming from the Bishop,
that's certainly a fine compliment.

he had a nice talk with you
before you reported to me.

770

Of course, he didn't tell me
what you two talked about.

771

He didn't have to.

Well, that was that.

01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,195
And with practically no more of a build up
than that, he asked me to lunch.

1054
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:46,232
Who knows? It might have worked.
It's been known to.

1055
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,551
So after I'd cooled him off, I came back here.

1056

expecting to be thrown out any minute.

to myself, "The landlord. Here it comes."

- Junior?

- So was I.

Well, up to here, we're all surprised.

1061
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:10,110
Naturally, before throwing me out,
he had to know a little about me.

1062
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,795
So in a few well-chosen sentences,
I gave him the details.

1063
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,791
Sort of like I told you.

1064
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,599
And you found a landlord
with a heart of gold.

1065
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,672
Well, not exactly a heart of gold,
Father, but...

1066
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:25,918
Well, we had the apartment vacant,
and it seemed a shame to throw her out.

- Nothing that I know of, up to here.

As I was saying,
it was a shame to throw her out.

She told me about coming to see you
and that you wanted to help her.

1646
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:52,754
Don't know who the Bishop
is going to send in his place...

1647
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:54,990
- but whoever he is...
- Father.

1648
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,869
Congratulations to you, Father.

1649
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:08,349
- The Bishop wouldn't do that to me again.
- Yes, he's done it.

1650
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:12,032
Mr. Haines. Nice of you to give
that mortgage to the church.

1651
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:13,235
HAINES: Not at all.

1652
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:15,470
Can't tell you how much we appreciate it.

1653
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:23,719
As you know...

1654
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:27,512
we're all going to miss Father O'Malley.

1655
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:31,792
He was a fine man.

1656
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:37,117
This is Father O'Malley,
the man who sent for you.

1657
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:38,952
How do you do, Mrs. Fitzgibbon?

1658
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,679
I've heard so much about you.
Now it's good to see you.

1659
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:45,878
FITZGIBBON: I think you'll agree that
we're all a little better for having known him.

1660
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:48,349
He was always thinking of others.

1661
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:51,593
And that, you know,
can make life very beautiful.

1662
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:55,468
Believe me, it's what we do for others that...
