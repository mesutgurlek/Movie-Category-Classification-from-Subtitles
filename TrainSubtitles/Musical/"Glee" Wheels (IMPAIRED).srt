1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So here's what you missed
last week

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,500
Quinn's pregnant
You're off the cheerios

3
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:04,461
..and everyone thinks that
Finn's the father....

4
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:05,873
...but really its Puck

5
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:09,187
...but Quinn thinks he's a
lime-a-loser and doesn't
want anything to do with him.

6
00:00:09,188 --> 00:00:09,667
Somethin' else..

7
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:12,400
Also, Kurt told everybody
he's gay including his dad..

8
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:13,996
Who's actually kinda cool about it..

9
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:14,695
Thanks for telling me, Kurt

10
00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:15,696
..and that's what you missed on...

11
00:00:15,652 --> 00:00:18,652
GLEE!

12
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:48,751
You shouldn't do this
to yourself.

13
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:51,988
Do what?

14
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,790
I know how much it hurts
to be off the team.

15
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,059
You're just torturing yourself
watching them.

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,762
I needed a good distraction.

17
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:01,831
From what?

18
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,275
$685?

19
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:16,345
That's how much
a sonogram costs.

20
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:18,447
This is just
the beginning.

21
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:20,816
There's going to be
more doctor's visits,

22
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:23,919
Vitamins, new clothes
for when I explode.

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,122
What are we going to do?

24
00:01:26,123 --> 00:01:27,957
What are you going to do?

25
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,392
I'm looking for a job.

26
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:31,060
I mean, no one's hiring.

27
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:32,728
I almost got in
at olive garden,

28
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,164
But they said I was too tall
to be a busboy.

29
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:40,670
Somewhere in that pea brain
of yours is a man.

30
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:43,205
Access him and tell him
to prove to me

31
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:45,908
That I chose the right guy
to have a baby with.

32
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:47,143
I will.

33
00:01:47,144 --> 00:01:48,945
I-I'll find a job.

34
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:51,014
You can count
on me, I swear.

35
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:52,741
Where you going?

36
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:55,726
You were right.

37
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:58,554
This does hurt too much.

38
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:04,274
My blog has lit up
with comments

39
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:05,942
Suggesting you don't have
a shot at nationals

40
00:02:04,962 --> 00:02:06,830
Since you lost
Quinn Fabray.

41
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:09,691
No, the cheerios are
stronger than ever.

42
00:02:10,123 --> 00:02:13,326
We're gonna take nationals
with this routine.

43
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:19,737
Mediocre.

44
00:02:19,743 --> 00:02:21,477
Hit the showers.

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,570
(bell ringing)

46
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:26,335
I have several
sources reporting

47
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:27,871
Quinn didn't want to leave,

48
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:30,207
But you kicked her out because
of the pregnancy scandal.

49
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,008
Well, jacob,
this is ohio.

50
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:33,543
And in order to win,
my cheerios need

51
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:35,645
To appeal to that
panel of judges.

52
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:38,315
So if I have a pregnant
girl doing a handspring
into a double layout,

53
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:41,051
The judges aren't going to be
admiring her impeccable form,

54
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:44,154
They're going to be wondering
if the centrifugal force

55
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:46,189
Is going to make the baby's
head start crowning.

56
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,859
Oh, and by the way, all
this-- off the record.

57
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,294
Probably should have
told you that earlier.

58
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:52,696
This isn't fair.

59
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:55,332
Is it fair that I had to stop
providing the baseball team

60
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,967
With protective cups?

61
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,202
I only get a certain
amount of dollars a year

62
00:02:59,203 --> 00:03:00,370
To spend, Wiliam.

63
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:01,404
Yeah, but Artie is...

64
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:02,773
Is used to overcoming
challenges.

65
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:05,842
He'll just have to find
his own ride to sectionals.

66
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:09,846
That handi-capable bus
costs $600 a week to rent.

67
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:11,861
We can't afford it.

68
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:12,682
Oh, but there's enough
money in the budget

69
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:15,185
To fly the cheerios all over the
country for their competitions?

70
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,289
Sue Sylvester has boosters
that write fat checks.

71
00:03:20,323 --> 00:03:22,292
None of her travel expenses
come out of the school budget.

72
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:25,887
Look, when I was in
the glee club,

73
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:26,730
The best part
of the competitions

74
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:29,000
Was the bus ride
to the event.

75
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,826
It was about camaraderie
and supporting each other.

76
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:33,661
You think I feel good
about this?

77
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:36,342
Well, my students
won't stand for it.

78
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:39,629
That's very moving,
but my hands are tied, Shue.

79
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,784
If you want that bus, you're
going to have to find a way

80
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:44,152
To pay for it yourself.

81
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:47,808
(sighs)

ReSync'd and case corrected by WheezerTheGeezer

83
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,889
(bell ringing)

84
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,625
What about Target?

85
00:03:57,627 --> 00:03:59,161
Tried.
Not hiring.

86
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:02,197
Another doctor bill came to my
parents' house last night, Finn.

87
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:05,434
We're lucky that I'm clever
and intercepted it.

88
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:07,803
But we have to start
paying these doctor's bills

89
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:10,272
Or they're going to go
to a collection agency

90
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:12,908
And then my parents are going
to find out that I'm with child.

91
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:14,109
Your child.

92
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,978
Will:
All right, guys.

93
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:17,379
We're doing a new number
for sectionals.

94
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,714
I know that pop songs

95
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:20,849
Have sort of been
our signature pieces,

96
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,185
But I did a little research
on past winners,

97
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:24,987
And it turns out
that the judges like songs

98
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:26,155
That are more accessible.

99
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:27,556
Stuff they know.

100
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:28,624
Uh, standards,

101
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,959
Broadway.

102
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,627
"defying gravity"?

103
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:33,762
I have an ipod shuffle
dedicated exclusively

104
00:04:33,763 --> 00:04:35,230
<i>To selections from Wicked.</i>

105
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:36,532
This is amazing.

106
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:38,233
Think you can handle it,
Rachel?

107
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:39,868
It's my go-to
shower song.

108
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:41,603
It's also
my ringtone.

109
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:45,074
Mercedes: Why do we have to go
all vanilla on this song?

110
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:46,141
See, what we need

111
00:04:46,142 --> 00:04:48,010
Is my chocolate thunder.

112
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:50,179
Okay, we don't have time
to rearrange a song

113
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,147
For you, mercedes.
Rachel is singing it.

114
00:04:52,148 --> 00:04:53,882
Don't worry, we'll
find something for you

115
00:04:53,883 --> 00:04:55,250
To dip in chocolate.

116
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:56,552
(laughter)

117
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:58,087
On to item two.

118
00:04:58,088 --> 00:04:59,989
The school won't pay
for the special bus we need

119
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,191
To take Artie and his wheelchair
with us to sectionals.

120
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:03,192
W-w-what?!

121
00:05:03,193 --> 00:05:04,693
That's completely unfair.

122
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:07,997
So we're going to have to raise
money to pay for it ourselves.

123
00:05:07,998 --> 00:05:10,165
See, when I was
in glee club,

124
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,335
And we needed new silk
cummerbunds for regionals,

125
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:14,837
We held a bake sale.

126
00:05:14,838 --> 00:05:17,439
(scattered laughter)

127
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,208
Santana:
You're joking, right?

128
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:22,378
I mean, bake sales
are kind of bougie.

129
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:25,514
So hip people stopped eating
delicious sugary treats?

130
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:26,882
It's not that.

131
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:29,184
It's most of us
don't know how to bake.

132
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:31,787
I find recipes confusing.

133
00:05:31,788 --> 00:05:34,023
My family is fully
committed to takeout.

134
00:05:34,024 --> 00:05:37,059
Yeah, Mr. Shue, kids are busier
than when you went here.

135
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,563
We've got homework and football
and teen pregnancy, lunch.

136
00:05:41,564 --> 00:05:43,532
Can't Artie's dad
just take him?

137
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:46,902
I can't believe how insensitive
you're all being.

138
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:47,903
Are you a team?

139
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:49,405
Of course.

140
00:05:49,406 --> 00:05:52,007
But Artie understands,
don't you, Artie?

141
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:53,575
Oh... Of course.

142
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:55,110
It's cool.

143
00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:57,179
Anything that takes away
our time from rehearsing

144
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,847
Doesn't serve the team.

145
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,751
(bell ringing)

146
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,094
Let me help you out,
buddy.
Thank you.

147
00:06:12,095 --> 00:06:14,797
Hey, I'm really sorry about how
they all reacted, Artie.

148
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,465
Oh, it's okay.
I'm used to it.

149
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:17,966
They just don't get it.

150
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:22,671
Can I use the auditorium
this afternoon

151
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:24,039
To rehearse, Mr. Shue?

152
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,674
Some of the band
equipment's in there.

153
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:26,975
Sure.

154
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:38,087
(playing jazzy version
of "dancing with myself")

155
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:41,090
(fingers snapping rhythmically)

156
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:48,530
~~ on the floor of Tokyo-o ~~

157
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:51,467
~~ or down in London town
to go-o ~~

158
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:54,470
~~ with the record selection
with the mirror reflection ~~

159
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:57,272
~~ I'm dancing with myself ~~

160
00:06:57,273 --> 00:06:59,775
~~ when there's no one else
in sight ~~

161
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:02,811
~~ in a crowded lonely ni-ight ~~

162
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:06,281
~~ well, I wait so long
for my love vibration ~~

163
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:08,851
~~ and I'm dancing with myself ~~

164
00:07:08,852 --> 00:07:12,221
~~ I'm dancing with myself ~~

165
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:15,057
~~ I'm dancing
with myself ~~

166
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:17,659
~~ well, there's nothing to lose
and there's nothing to prove ~~

167
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,530
~~ and I'll be dancing
with myself ~~

168
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:23,632
~~ if I looked
all over the world ~~

169
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:27,336
~~ and there's every
type of gi-irl ~~

170
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:30,372
~~ but your empty eyes
seem to pass me by ~~

171
00:07:30,373 --> 00:07:33,142
~~ and leave me dancing
with myself ~~

172
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:36,078
~~ so let's sink another drink ~~

173
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,281
~~ 'cause it'll give me
time to thi-ink ~~

174
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:42,251
~~ if I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance ~~

175
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:45,654
~~ and I'll be dancing
with myself ~~

176
00:07:45,655 --> 00:07:48,223
~~ oh, dancing with myself ~~

177
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:51,593
~~ oh, dancing
with myself ~~

178
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:54,596
~~ oh, there's nothing to lose
and there's nothing to prove ~~

179
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:57,399
~~ I'll be dancing
with myself ~~

180
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,402
~~ oh, dancing with myself ~~

181
00:08:00,403 --> 00:08:03,172
~~ oh, dancing with myself ~~
(music fades out)

182
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:06,542
~~ oh, there's nothing to lose
and there's nothing to prove ~~

183
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:08,877
~~ and I'll be dancing
with myself. ~~

184
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:14,239
(bell ringing)

185
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:16,045
I have something
I'd like to say.

186
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,260
<i>I want to audition
for the Wicked solo.</i>

187
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:21,528
(murmured encouragement)

188
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:22,930
Kurt, there's a high "F" in it.

189
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:25,036
That's well within my range.

190
00:08:25,858 --> 00:08:27,551
Well, I think Rachel's
going to be fine

191
00:08:27,552 --> 00:08:29,554
For the female lead,
but I'm happy to have you

192
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:30,602
Try out something else, Kurt.

193
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:32,303
And we'll make sure
it's got a killer high note.

194
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,140
(students murmuring)

195
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:36,062
Artie:
You tried.
Anyway,

196
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:37,555
I wanted to say
something to you guys.

197
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:41,551
I was a little disappointed
at how you were all so willing

198
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,379
To take the bus
to get to sectionals

199
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,615
And make Artie drive by himself
with his dad.

200
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:50,018
We're a team, guys.

201
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:51,854
We're in this glee club
together.

202
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:53,255
Artie doesn't care.

203
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:54,690
His dad drives him everywhere.

204
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:56,792
I do care.

205
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:58,393
It kind of hurt my feelings.

206
00:08:58,394 --> 00:09:00,062
We didn't think you would
take it personally.

207
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:02,231
Well, you're irritating
most of the time,

208
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:05,501
But don't take that personally.

209
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:06,802
I don't know if you guys
really understand

210
00:09:06,803 --> 00:09:08,604
How much harder Artie
has to work just to keep up.

211
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:09,938
Preach.

212
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:12,441
We're riding
to sectionals together

213
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:14,443
Or we're not going at all.

214
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:18,147
And to pay for the bus,
we're having a bake sale.

215
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:21,016
Bake sale...
St. Ignatius
nursing home

216
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:23,185
Was having a tag sale,

217
00:09:23,186 --> 00:09:26,688
And my av club friends here
agreed to help out.

218
00:09:28,758 --> 00:09:30,225
For the next week,

219
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:33,328
Each of you is going
to spend three hours a day

220
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:35,164
In a wheelchair.

221
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:38,567
Oh, oh, oh.

222
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:40,569
And we're doing
a wheelchair number.

223
00:09:44,624 --> 00:09:45,225
("dancing with myself" playing)

224
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:47,242
Billy Idol:
~~ on the floors of Tokyo-o ~~

225
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:49,840
~~ or down in London town
to go-go ~~

226
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:53,361
~~ with the record selection
and the mirror's reflection ~~

227
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:55,897
~~ I'm dancing with myself ~~

228
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,835
~~ well, there's nothing to lose
and there's nothing to prove ~~

229
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:00,676
~~ well, I'm dancing
with myself ~~

230
00:10:01,397 --> 00:10:03,231
~~ oh, oh, oh. ~~

231
00:10:03,476 --> 00:10:04,776
(song ends)

232
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:14,311
Puck:
I didn't even know we
had a home rec room.

233
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:15,522
What's all this?

234
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,689
Ingredients for cupcakes

235
00:10:19,158 --> 00:10:20,958
For the stupid bake sale.

236
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:26,353
What's this?

237
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:29,501
It's what I have left over
from my pool cleaning money.

238
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:31,892
After I bought dip
and nunchakus.

239
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:34,139
I was getting that you
kinda need money.

240
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,060
For our kid.

241
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:37,276
<i>For my kid.</i>

242
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,380
18 dollars.

243
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:45,017
How much has
Finn given you?

244
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:47,286
Just stop.

245
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:50,489
I told you before,

246
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,192
I don't care if that baby
comes out with a mohawk,

247
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:56,161
I will go to my grave
swearing it's Finn's.

248
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:05,571
It would be pretty awesome
if it came out with a mohawk.

249
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:10,242
You are such an egghead.

250
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:12,444
I'm not.

251
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:24,723
(giggling)

252
00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:27,359
(laughing)

253
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:30,929
(sighing)

254
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,930
(squealing)
ah!

255
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:33,432
That was perfectly measured!

256
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,933
(squealing, laughing)

257
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:36,035
There you go!

258
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:38,137
(laughter)

259
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:46,745
What the hell?

260
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:50,549
(chuckles)
(sighing)

261
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,918
We're baking.

262
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:55,054
I can see that.

263
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:57,523
I'm gonna go change.

264
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:05,564
Where's my jelly creme center?

265
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:08,267
Sorry, dad, I must've forgotten.

266
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:10,002
What's up with your brain today?

267
00:12:10,003 --> 00:12:11,503
You know,
I think it's going soft

268
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:13,372
From all that crap
you put in your hair.

269
00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:16,375
It's organic and I'm fine.

270
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:21,380
I'm sorry,
it's a glee club thing.

271
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:23,082
It's not about a guy, is it?

272
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,784
'cause I'm not ready
to have that conversation.

273
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:27,653
Oh, at least you don't
have to worry about me

274
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:29,421
Getting someone pregnant.
(chuckling)

275
00:12:31,224 --> 00:12:33,392
It's not a guy.

276
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:35,894
We're doing this amazing song
for sectionals,

277
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:36,863
A personal favorite of mine,

278
00:12:37,364 --> 00:12:39,632
And Mr. Schuester won't
give me a chance to sing it.

279
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,000
Why?

280
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:43,502
It's traditionally
sung by a girl.

281
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:45,171
Well, you sing like a girl.

282
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:46,572
You know, in a good way.

283
00:12:46,573 --> 00:12:48,341
Look, Kurt, I don't know

284
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:49,909
How this music stuff works.

285
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,411
I'm pretty exclusively committed
to my mellencamp collection

286
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:55,982
But isn't there more
crossover nowadays?

287
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,650
You know,
chicks doing construction,

288
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,785
Guys wearing dress shoes
with no socks?

289
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:02,688
Didn't that girl
from your high school

290
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:04,657
Just join the boy's
wrestling team?

291
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,858
(whistle blowing)
yes!

292
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:07,159
Whoo!

293
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:11,897
Yes, but her parents
had to Sue the school.

294
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:16,535
This is really getting
you down, isn't it?

295
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:18,871
I'm full of ennui.

296
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:22,808
<i>So, it's really
getting you down?</i>

297
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,979
Yes.

298
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,715
You can't discriminate against
my kid because of his sex,

299
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:32,118
Religion,
political affiliation

300
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:34,220
Or the fact that he's queer
as a three dollar bill.

301
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:35,287
And I won't accept it.

302
00:13:35,288 --> 00:13:36,622
This isn't academics

303
00:13:36,623 --> 00:13:37,990
Or athletics, Mr. Hummel.

304
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:40,192
It's an arts program
and Mr. Schuester's

305
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:42,662
Judgments are subjective.

306
00:13:42,663 --> 00:13:45,031
You put on a blindfold
and listen to my kid sing,

307
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,866
And you will swear you're
hearing Ronnie Spector.

308
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,535
Wait.
Don't try to backpedal
on this, Schuester.

309
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:51,837
I was just going
to agree with you.

310
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:54,206
I know this is going
to be hard on you, Rachel,

311
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:55,708
But I can't,
in good conscience,

312
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,677
Preach about the importance
of helping Artie

313
00:13:57,678 --> 00:13:59,645
And then reject Kurt's request
out of hand.

314
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:01,514
So, you're giving him my part?

315
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:03,416
Now, I can't just
give him the part.

316
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:06,085
That would be just as wrong,
but I can let him audition.

317
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:08,621
What do you mean,
like a tryout?

318
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:10,256
All right, that seems fair.

319
00:14:10,257 --> 00:14:13,159
This is totally unfair.
You gave me the part.

320
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,161
And I will give it to you again

321
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:17,763
If you can sing the song
better than Kurt.

322
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:20,199
Okay, this seems
like a reasonable deal.

323
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,902
But how do I know this
isn't just some show

324
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,370
To stop me from
taking a flamethrower

325
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:25,571
To this place?

326
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:28,674
Who's going to judge?

327
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:30,710
Now, all of you
are going to judge,

328
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:32,611
And in the spirit
of full access,

329
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:34,580
Each of you
is going to get a vote.

330
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:37,049
Whatever singer
has the most votes,

331
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,051
Gets the part.

332
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:40,586
This isn't going to be
about talent, Mr. Schuester.

333
00:14:40,587 --> 00:14:42,354
It's going to be
a popularity contest.

334
00:14:42,355 --> 00:14:44,256
Stop right there.
Mr. Shue, if I may.

335
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,065
We all know
I'm more popular than Rachel.

336
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:55,101
And I dress better than her.

337
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,169
But I want you all
to promise me that you're

338
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,071
Going to vote for whoever
sings the song better.

339
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:01,774
Raise your right hand.

340
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,976
<i>Your right hand, brittany.</i>

341
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:06,378
It's this one.
Sorry.

342
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:07,713
Repeat after me.

343
00:15:07,714 --> 00:15:09,882
I promise to vote for
whoever sings the song better.

344
00:15:09,883 --> 00:15:14,253
All:
I promise to vote for
whoever sings the song better.

345
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:19,291
It's on.

346
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:21,227
(bell ringing)

347
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:23,863
All right, guys.

348
00:15:30,403 --> 00:15:32,238
Maybe one of these days
you'll find a way to create

349
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,774
Teaching moments
without ruining my life.

350
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:39,411
(gentle piano melody plays)

351
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:41,547
(discordant notes play)

352
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:45,365
Shue, I saw all your kids
in wheelchairs

353
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:47,469
And I was very impressed.

354
00:15:47,195 --> 00:15:49,196
Well, thank you,
principal Figgins,

355
00:15:49,272 --> 00:15:51,173
But actually, it's made me
realize that there's only

356
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:53,075
One wheelchair entrance
in this school

357
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:55,144
And it's all the way on
the far end of campus.

358
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:56,501
Mckinley needs ramps.

359
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:58,702
No way.
Those are what I call

360
00:15:59,498 --> 00:16:00,290
"lazy makers."

361
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,084
They discourage
our able-bodied students

362
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:04,586
From getting their proper
exercise by using the stairs.

363
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,047
What is she doing here?

364
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,258
Yes, what am I doing here?

365
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,526
I have a cheerios routine
to polish

366
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,726
That's gonna
clinch us nationals.

367
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,394
I brought you two in here

368
00:16:11,395 --> 00:16:13,062
Because both of you
have a point.

369
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:15,131
Handicapped ramps are expensive,

370
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:19,068
But inspiration is free.

371
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:21,404
Will, I'm so inspired by
your stunt that I'm insisting

372
00:16:21,405 --> 00:16:23,272
That Ms. Sylvester do
the same with the cheerios.

373
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,807
I beg your pardon?

374
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:27,243
Cheerios is not accessible, Sue.

375
00:16:27,244 --> 00:16:28,945
It's by invitation only.

376
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,246
I want to see a squad

377
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:33,349
That reflects
our community's diversity.

378
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,351
Now, glee club
held open auditions.

379
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:37,120
And everyone got in.

380
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,654
Now that Quinn Fabray

381
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,324
Is off the squad,
you will hold open auditions

382
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:42,458
To fill her slot

383
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,626
And Mr. Schuester

384
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,361
Will monitor them
to make sure

385
00:16:45,362 --> 00:16:46,829
That they are fair to all.

386
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,698
Okay, let me break this
down for you here.

387
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:50,366
There comes a point

388
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:52,702
When you've got to stop seeing
people for what they look like,

389
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:55,004
And ask them to show you
what they can do.

390
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:57,040
And as soon as
a cheerleader

391
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,243
Rolls herself out onto
the field in a wheelchair,

392
00:17:00,244 --> 00:17:04,013
She becomes decidedly less
effective at cheering people up.

393
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:05,648
It's just a fact.

394
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,018
No, Sue, the fact is you've
never given other students

395
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:10,753
The fair shake
that they deserve.

396
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:13,356
I'm asking you to try it.

397
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:14,824
What do you have to lose?

398
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,093
Maybe somebody at this school
will surprise you.

399
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:21,364
Finn:
Cupcake?

400
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:25,902
These cupcakes suck.
That's why we're
not selling any.

401
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:28,204
It's not about the cupcakes.
It's about us.

402
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:30,339
Nobody wants to buy from losers.

403
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,342
We're in glee club
and in wheelchairs.

404
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,610
She has a point.

405
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:35,845
Six months ago
I could've sold

406
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,513
50 of these things
on fear alone.

407
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,551
Oh, my god.
What is she doing?!

408
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:44,020
I actually think
they're kind of friends.

409
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,522
Brittany is always cheating off
her test papers in math class.

410
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,158
See, so many?

411
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:50,593
And look how pretty
they are, Becky.

412
00:17:50,594 --> 00:17:52,228
Wow.

413
00:17:52,229 --> 00:17:54,163
Brittany, you're supposed
to be in your wheelchair.

414
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:55,731
I lost it.

415
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:57,733
Are you a cheerleader?

416
00:17:57,734 --> 00:17:59,068
It's so cool.

417
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:00,369
So is buying a cupcake.

418
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,437
That's really cool.

419
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:03,506
But I don't have any money.

420
00:18:03,507 --> 00:18:05,074
That's okay,
I have some.

421
00:18:13,117 --> 00:18:16,119
Thanks.

422
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,621
So, how much do we have now?

423
00:18:18,622 --> 00:18:22,024
Well, with this one dollar,
we have... One dollar.

424
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:24,227
This is ridiculous.

425
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,195
Well, maybe if we put
a jelly bean or something

426
00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:28,464
On top we'd sell more.
Are you an idiot?!

427
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:31,200
How am I supposed to trust you
to take care of our baby

428
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:33,870
When you can't even figure out
how to sell a damn cupcake?

429
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:35,738
Stop attacking me.
I'm sick of it.

430
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,606
Get a job.

431
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:37,707
I'm trying!

432
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,876
(chair clattering)

433
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:40,943
(Quinn scoffs)

434
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:43,846
(sighs)

435
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:50,653
Sue:
I don't know what I'm
supposed to be doing here.

436
00:18:50,654 --> 00:18:53,289
You just call a name,
they come in and try out.

437
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,124
Just give them a chance
to express themselves.

438
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,792
I'm about to projectile
express myself

439
00:18:56,793 --> 00:18:58,427
All over your
hush puppies.

440
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,930
Mckinley, hey, hey.

441
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,266
Mckinley, hey, hey.

442
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,200
No.

443
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:09,505
(baton clattering, echoing)

444
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:10,806
No.

445
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:13,709
You're not serious, are you?

446
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:19,148
Tell me you're not serious.

447
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:19,749
No.

448
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:22,585
No friggin' way, jacob.

449
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:32,028
(lightly groaning)

450
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:33,429
Freak!

451
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:37,567
Okay, I've been at this for
an hour, that's all I promised.

452
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:39,735
Sue, there's just one
more person on the list.

453
00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:41,437
Give her a shot.

454
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:42,905
Becky Johnson!

455
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:44,473
Jackson.
Jackson.

456
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:50,012
(sotto voce):
Be nice, Sue.

457
00:19:50,013 --> 00:19:53,082
I heard that you're doing
a routine with jump ropes.

458
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,151
I wanted to show you
what I can do.

459
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:09,131
Becky, I'm going to stop you
right there.

460
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:12,501
You're in.

461
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,804
Be at practice tomorrow
at 4:00 p.M.

462
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:16,105
Congratulations.

463
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:22,678
What are you up to, sue?

464
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,413
I'm just following orders, Will.

465
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:25,648
I'm doing what I was told.

466
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:28,251
And I found myself
a brand-new cheerio.

467
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:30,886
You're up to something.

468
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:33,823
I don't like this, sue!

469
00:20:36,827 --> 00:20:39,395
(bell ringing)
I'm just saying,
she has a point.

470
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:41,163
You are kind
of an idiot.

471
00:20:41,164 --> 00:20:42,465
Nice support, dude.

472
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:43,933
Whatever happened
to bros before hos?

473
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:45,568
You've got a baby
on the way, bro.

474
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:47,103
And you haven't done spit
to take care of it.

475
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:48,704
Like you'd do
any different?

476
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,072
Damn straight.
How?

477
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:51,340
Nobody's hiring.

478
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:53,909
Sell your Xbox,
rob a bank,

479
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,345
Go all Robin Hood on this joint,
whatever it takes.

480
00:20:57,581 --> 00:20:59,448
(wheelchairs cLanging)
all I ever hear is you

481
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:01,617
Whining and crying
about how hard this is on you.

482
00:21:01,618 --> 00:21:02,718
What about her?

483
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,353
Dude, you are so out of line!

484
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:05,788
You don't know
what I'm dealing with!

485
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:07,757
All I know is that you're a punk

486
00:21:07,758 --> 00:21:09,458
Who doesn't deserve to have
Quinn as his girlfriend.

487
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:11,027
You're a punk!

488
00:21:15,265 --> 00:21:18,367
(grunting, groaning)

489
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,272
Will:
Hey, hey, break it up!

490
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:24,573
Break it up!

491
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,108
Come on!

492
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:27,209
Hey!
He started it.

493
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,544
I don't care!

494
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:29,345
Now...

495
00:21:29,346 --> 00:21:30,446
(sighing)

496
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:33,082
You-you guys are best friends.

497
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,718
What the hell is going on?

498
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:38,688
I'm just really stressed
about the bake sale.

499
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:41,023
I really like Artie, okay?

500
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,361
You okay?

501
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,618
The key to a double turn
is to just go for it.

502
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:55,020
You push with the
right wheel and pull
as hard as you can

503
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:57,389
With the left, and find a spot
on the wall to spot you,

504
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,424
So you don't get dizzy.

505
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:07,266
Will:
Okay, guys,
take five, all right?

506
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:09,935
Oh, remember to show up early
on Thursday.

507
00:22:09,936 --> 00:22:11,403
It's Rachel versus Kurt

508
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:12,938
For the big solo.

509
00:22:16,476 --> 00:22:17,710
Careful.

510
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,379
Artie:
Respect the chair.

511
00:22:24,785 --> 00:22:26,385
I really admire you, Artie.

512
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,955
I had no idea
how difficult this was.

513
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:31,624
It's just like you
with your stutter.

514
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,360
You don't really notice
it after awhile.

515
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:38,631
Ho-ho-how did it happen?

516
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:40,633
You don't talk about it.

517
00:22:40,634 --> 00:22:43,968
My mom and I got in
a really bad car accident

518
00:22:43,969 --> 00:22:45,436
When I was eight.

519
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:49,073
And she was fine, but I've been
in the chair ever since.

520
00:22:49,074 --> 00:22:52,210
But I want to be very clear--

521
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:54,712
I still have the use
of my penis.

522
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:21,539
(singing ascending high notes)

523
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:26,477
(phone ringing)
excuse me a second.

524
00:23:26,478 --> 00:23:27,846
(singing continues)

525
00:23:27,847 --> 00:23:31,616
(singing higher notes)

526
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:33,618
(phone ringing)

527
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,620
(singing continues)

528
00:23:36,889 --> 00:23:39,357
(singing higher notes)

529
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:40,792
Hummel tire and lube.

530
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:42,560
Yeah. Who is this?

531
00:23:42,561 --> 00:23:45,096
(singing high note)

532
00:23:45,097 --> 00:23:46,698
Man:
Your son's a fag.

533
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:48,666
(dial tone)

534
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:52,036
(phone beeps off)

535
00:23:54,573 --> 00:23:56,641
Kurt:
Hey, dad.

536
00:23:56,642 --> 00:23:58,576
What the hell is wrong
with this machine?

537
00:23:58,577 --> 00:24:00,345
I hit it, the high "f."

538
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:02,413
The magical note I need
for "Defying Gravity."

539
00:24:02,414 --> 00:24:03,414
I hit it.

540
00:24:03,415 --> 00:24:04,682
It means I'm going to win.

541
00:24:04,683 --> 00:24:05,850
That's great.
Good for you.

542
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:07,552
Just how long till
the damn coffee's ready?

543
00:24:07,553 --> 00:24:08,853
What's going on?

544
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:11,990
I got a phone call this morning.

545
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:14,559
The anonymous kind.

546
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,228
It was some dude telling me
my son was a fag.

547
00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:18,830
Oh.

548
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:20,265
Well, that's not a big deal.

549
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:21,799
I get that all the time.

550
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,735
Yeah, but I don't.

551
00:24:23,736 --> 00:24:25,303
Now look, Kurt, I...

552
00:24:25,304 --> 00:24:27,939
I try to do right by you--
you know, open some doors.

553
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,807
What father wouldn't do
that for his kid?

554
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:31,476
And I know
it's good for you

555
00:24:31,477 --> 00:24:34,646
To be out there with all this
glee club stuff.

556
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:38,549
I just... I don't want you
to get hurt.

557
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:42,553
So you don't want me to audition
for the solo?

558
00:24:42,554 --> 00:24:44,188
No, no, let me be clear,
all right?

559
00:24:44,189 --> 00:24:46,357
No one pushes
the Hummels around.

560
00:24:46,358 --> 00:24:48,126
Especially cowards on the phone.

561
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:55,733
Sometimes I just... I wish your
mom was still around, you know?

562
00:24:55,734 --> 00:24:58,269
She was better

563
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:02,707
At handling this kind of thing,
you know, handling me.

564
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,178
Well, congrats on, uh...

565
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:09,981
You know, the cool "A"
or the high "C"

566
00:25:09,982 --> 00:25:11,082
Or whatever.
High "F".

567
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,583
Yeah.

568
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:23,461
There's your problem.
You just had a bad push rim.

569
00:25:23,462 --> 00:25:25,530
Good as new.

570
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:27,398
Thanks, Finn.

571
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:29,500
You're the only one
who's willing to help me.

572
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,538
I'm really nervous about
the diva-off tomorrow.

573
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:34,672
Don't be.

574
00:25:34,673 --> 00:25:36,975
I don't want to win
out of charity.

575
00:25:36,976 --> 00:25:39,844
I want to win the solo
because it's right for the club.

576
00:25:39,845 --> 00:25:41,612
I really think that the
judges at sectionals

577
00:25:41,613 --> 00:25:43,247
Will find a female version
of "Defying Gravity"

578
00:25:43,248 --> 00:25:45,249
Much more accessible.

579
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,620
But I don't think
that's going to happen.

580
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:52,156
People just don't like me.

581
00:25:52,157 --> 00:25:54,993
Yeah, you might want
to work on that.

582
00:25:56,495 --> 00:25:59,163
But I like you.

583
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:01,866
We need to talk.

584
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:03,701
I'll get out of your way.

585
00:26:03,702 --> 00:26:05,103
No, you stay.
I need a witness.

586
00:26:05,104 --> 00:26:06,471
Do you know
what this is?

587
00:26:06,472 --> 00:26:07,939
Oh, it's just a
past due notice.

588
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,440
My mom gets them
all the time.

589
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:12,043
Right, but if this sonogram
bill doesn't get paid,

590
00:26:12,044 --> 00:26:14,312
It's not your phone
that's going to get cut off.

591
00:26:14,313 --> 00:26:16,147
You will get cut off.

592
00:26:16,148 --> 00:26:17,982
You need to help me
with this, Finn.

593
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:20,752
Or else we're going to go
our separate ways.

594
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,457
I'm screwed.

595
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:29,227
Not necessarily.

596
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,434
I know, I know, I know, I know.

597
00:26:39,435 --> 00:26:41,303
Hey. Hey, guys.
Hey, guys, this is amazing.

598
00:26:41,304 --> 00:26:42,604
Santana:
Hi.

599
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:44,973
Puck found his nana
connie's old recipe.

600
00:26:44,974 --> 00:26:46,608
They're addictive.
Do you want one?

601
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:47,943
No, no, thanks.

602
00:26:47,944 --> 00:26:49,911
Don't want to take one away
from a paying customer.

603
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:51,747
Yeah, no, sure.

604
00:26:51,748 --> 00:26:52,748
Hey, nice work, buddy.

605
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:55,751
These are so good.

606
00:26:55,752 --> 00:26:58,019
<i>Puck:
This isn't Nana Connie's
old recipe.</i>

607
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,921
<i>She couldn't cook at all.</i>

608
00:26:59,422 --> 00:27:02,057
<i>She was a diabetic, so the only
sweets she had in her house</i>

609
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:03,425
<i>Was dried fruit.</i>

610
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:05,494
<i>I knew I had to do something</i>

611
00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:07,329
<i>To help Quinn out
with our baby.</i>

612
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,398
<i>I don't know what kind
of stuff you need</i>

613
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,033
<i>For a baby that's still
in your stomach--</i>

614
00:27:11,034 --> 00:27:12,768
<i>Bottles, diapers,
that kind of thing, I guess.</i>

615
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:17,940
<i>But my baby mama
was going to get it all.</i>

616
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:19,608
<i>To make sure that happened,</i>

617
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:22,311
<i>I used the two things
I know the most about--</i>

618
00:27:22,312 --> 00:27:24,179
<i>Lying and crime.</i>

619
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,448
Is there a lot
of pain, Noah?

620
00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:29,485
(sobbing):
The doctor said the shark
fractured my spinal cord.

621
00:27:29,486 --> 00:27:31,854
This is why I don't go
to the aquarium.

622
00:27:31,855 --> 00:27:34,490
I'm going to give you
as much as you want,

623
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:36,892
20 cents on the dollar.

624
00:27:36,893 --> 00:27:39,595
<i>Puck:
I don't put in enough
to get you hallucinating,</i>

625
00:27:39,596 --> 00:27:42,097
<i>Just enough to give you
a wicked case of the munchies.</i>

626
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:44,934
<i>That's why they keep
coming back for more.</i>

627
00:27:44,935 --> 00:27:48,971
<i>See, I told you
I'd make a great dad.</i>

628
00:27:48,972 --> 00:27:50,973
Sue:
Faster.

629
00:27:50,974 --> 00:27:52,341
Harder.

630
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,177
Those better be

631
00:27:55,178 --> 00:27:57,079
Tears of joy, Becky.

632
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,648
Faster!
Harder!

633
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:00,916
Okay, stop.

634
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:03,352
Becky, this is terrible.

635
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:05,788
I tried, coach.

636
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:07,356
This is really hard.

637
00:28:07,357 --> 00:28:08,590
You think this is hard?

638
00:28:08,591 --> 00:28:09,959
<i>Try auditioning
for Baywatch</i>

639
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,094
And being told that they're
going in another direction.

640
00:28:12,095 --> 00:28:13,562
That was hard.

641
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:14,596
Hit the showers.

642
00:28:14,597 --> 00:28:16,231
Thanks, coach.

643
00:28:16,232 --> 00:28:17,633
(giggles)

644
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,375
Hi.

645
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,114
Sue, you are unbelievable.

646
00:28:32,115 --> 00:28:34,350
And you are
a terrible spy.

647
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:36,752
You might try breathing
through your nose sometime.

648
00:28:36,753 --> 00:28:37,953
If you were a sniper,

649
00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:39,621
I would have already
radioed in your coordinates.

650
00:28:39,622 --> 00:28:41,023
Just like in the Falklands.

651
00:28:41,024 --> 00:28:42,624
I'm not going to let
you bully that girl, Sue.

652
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,226
Oh, I bully
everybody, will.

653
00:28:44,227 --> 00:28:45,594
It's the way I roll.

654
00:28:45,595 --> 00:28:46,628
Yeah, but this
is different.

655
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:48,197
She's not like
everybody else.

656
00:28:48,198 --> 00:28:50,466
I want you to listen
to what you just said, William.

657
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:52,067
You're asking me to treat
this girl differently

658
00:28:52,068 --> 00:28:53,068
Because she has a disability.

659
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:54,370
When actually,
it seems to me,

660
00:28:54,371 --> 00:28:56,271
She just wants to be treated
like everybody else.

661
00:28:56,272 --> 00:28:57,406
Why are you doing this?

662
00:28:57,407 --> 00:28:59,108
Because I know you.

663
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:00,376
And you're up to something.

664
00:29:00,377 --> 00:29:03,812
You don't know
the first thing about me.

665
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:16,458
Good luck.

666
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:18,761
(quietly):
I'm rooting for you.

667
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:26,035
All right,
welcome to the glee club's

668
00:29:26,036 --> 00:29:27,970
First official diva-off.

669
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:28,671
(cheering)

670
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,731
Let's get this party started.

671
00:29:36,312 --> 00:29:39,114
(piano playing "Defying Gravity"
intro)

672
00:29:42,803 --> 00:29:45,938
~~ something has changed
within me ~~

673
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:47,846
~~ something is not the same ~~

674
00:29:48,498 --> 00:29:52,535
~~ I'm through with playing
by the rules ~~

675
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:55,089
~~ of someone else's game ~~

676
00:29:54,992 --> 00:29:58,194
~~ too late for second-guessing ~~

677
00:29:58,195 --> 00:30:01,097
~~ too late
to go back to sleep ~~

678
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:04,534
~~ it's time to trust
my instincts ~~

679
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:07,937
~~ close my eyes and leap... ~~

680
00:30:07,938 --> 00:30:14,076
~~ it's time to try
defying gravity ~~

681
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:20,550
~~ I think I'll try
defying gravity... ~~

682
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:26,155
~~ kiss me good-bye,
I'm defying gravity ~~

683
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:29,759
~~ and you won't bring me down ~~

684
00:30:34,331 --> 00:30:37,633
~~ I'm through accepting limits ~~

685
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:41,637
~~ 'cause someone says
they're so... ~~

686
00:30:41,638 --> 00:30:43,306
~~ some things I cannot change ~~

687
00:30:43,307 --> 00:30:46,943
~~ but till I try
I'll never know... ~~

688
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:49,946
~~ too long
I've been afraid of ~~

689
00:30:49,947 --> 00:30:53,316
~~ losing love
I guess I'd lost... ~~

690
00:30:53,317 --> 00:30:59,722
~~ well, if that's love, it comes
at much too high a cost... ~~

691
00:30:59,723 --> 00:31:05,795
~~ I'd sooner buy
defying gravity... ~~

692
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:12,234
~~ kiss me good-bye,
I'm defying gravity... ~~

693
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:18,207
~~ I think I'll try
defying gravity ~~

694
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:22,044
~~ and you won't bring me down ~~

695
00:31:22,045 --> 00:31:28,184
~~ I'd sooner buy
defying gravity... ~~

696
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:34,357
~~ kiss me good-buy,
I'm defying gravity... ~~

697
00:31:34,358 --> 00:31:40,696
~~ I think I'll try
defying gravity ~~

698
00:31:40,697 --> 00:31:44,634
(voice cracking):
~~ and you won't
bring me down... ~~

699
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:48,104
(singing perfectly):
~~ bring me down ~~

700
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:50,806
~~ oh, oh, oh, oh... ~~

701
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:53,776
~~ oh. ~~

702
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:55,378
(music stops)

703
00:31:57,981 --> 00:32:01,450
(applause)

704
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:02,685
Wiliam:
Good job, Kurt.
Good job.

705
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:05,788
(bell ringing)

706
00:32:08,865 --> 00:32:10,866
Hey, wait up.

707
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:13,001
I cracked open
the piggy bank.

708
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:14,169
It's for you.

709
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,337
Well, it's for it.

710
00:32:15,338 --> 00:32:17,606
It is a she.

711
00:32:17,607 --> 00:32:20,442
Cool.

712
00:32:20,443 --> 00:32:21,877
I told you I wasn't a deadbeat.

713
00:32:21,878 --> 00:32:24,880
Look, Puck, this is
really sweet, but...

714
00:32:24,881 --> 00:32:27,916
I can get more.

715
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:30,819
People call me
a screw-up because...

716
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,290
I think school's for suckers,
but I got ambition.

717
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,692
I can get us a house.

718
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:37,859
Some stuff.

719
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,795
Furniture.

720
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:41,063
We could be a family.

721
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:45,200
Finn is your best friend.

722
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:46,702
He'd be pissed for a while.

723
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:48,570
But then he'd realize he doesn't
have to deal with all this.

724
00:32:48,571 --> 00:32:49,838
He'd bake me a damn cake.

725
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,976
You stole from
the cupcake fund.

726
00:32:53,977 --> 00:32:55,177
No, I didn't.

727
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,914
Fine, I did.

728
00:32:58,915 --> 00:33:00,082
I made all those cupcakes.

729
00:33:01,217 --> 00:33:02,484
I'm all about
being a team player,

730
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:04,319
But my family comes first.

731
00:33:05,755 --> 00:33:07,055
I get it.

732
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:10,626
And I'm sorry.

733
00:33:10,627 --> 00:33:13,295
I should have never
called you a lima loser.

734
00:33:13,296 --> 00:33:15,063
You're not.

735
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:19,801
You're special
and a romantic

736
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:21,770
And a good enough person

737
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:24,640
To realize that we are
not going to take money

738
00:33:24,641 --> 00:33:26,108
From a friend in
a wheelchair.

739
00:33:27,543 --> 00:33:29,278
Hey.

740
00:33:32,982 --> 00:33:34,916
Here.

741
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:36,351
What's this?

742
00:33:36,352 --> 00:33:38,020
I got a job.

743
00:33:38,021 --> 00:33:40,589
Excuse me.

744
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,257
Are you the manager?
Yes.

745
00:33:42,258 --> 00:33:43,859
You need to hire my friend Finn.

746
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,561
He is clearly handi-capable
and refusing to hire him

747
00:33:46,562 --> 00:33:47,521
Could be seen as
discrimination.

748
00:33:47,522 --> 00:33:50,265
My dads are gay and unless
you want the full force

749
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:52,467
Of the American Civil Liberties
Union coming down on you,

750
00:33:52,902 --> 00:33:54,670
I'd work something out.

751
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,019
I'm going to need
to stay in my wheelchair

752
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,086
As long as I'm working there,

753
00:33:58,074 --> 00:34:00,576
But screw it, it's worth it.

754
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:02,978
Can I give you a lift
to rehearsal?

755
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:14,924
(bell ringing)

756
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:17,401
1200$. That's enough for the show bus

757
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:19,670
And two cases of Natty Light
for the ride home.

758
00:34:19,823 --> 00:34:20,857
Oh, dream on, buddy.

759
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,859
(cheers and applause)

760
00:34:25,162 --> 00:34:27,296
I'm very proud of you guys.

761
00:34:29,633 --> 00:34:31,968
Artie...

762
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,970
Why don't you bring this
to principal Figgins yourself?

763
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,671
(light cheers)

764
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:37,773
All right, Artie!
Artie!

765
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,511
What's wrong, dude?

766
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,013
I really appreciate
what you guys did for me,

767
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:46,682
But I'm not the only kid
in a wheelchair at this school.

768
00:34:46,683 --> 00:34:51,087
And I'm sure there will be
others after I graduate.

769
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:53,022
And I know how important it is
for all of us to go

770
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:54,824
To sectionals together,

771
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:57,360
But I think I'd rather
just get a ride from my dad

772
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,897
And use this for a handicapped
ramp in the auditorium.

773
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,233
Any objections?

774
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:07,170
Well, sure beats having
to carry him in every day.

775
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,172
(chuckling)

776
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,610
You think she has a brain tumor?

777
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:16,045
That can cause erratic behavior.

778
00:35:16,046 --> 00:35:18,981
All I know is that
she walked in unannounced

779
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:23,085
And she wrote me a check for
three new handicapped ramps.

780
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:24,887
I just don't get it.

781
00:35:24,888 --> 00:35:27,857
I mean, first putting Becky
in cheerios, now this.

782
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:29,392
What is her angle?

783
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,860
Why ask why?

784
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:33,696
Just enjoy the fact that you're
getting your bus after all.

785
00:35:38,802 --> 00:35:40,269
How's she doing?
Great.

786
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,171
She asks about you.

787
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:43,940
She's been watching you on tv.

788
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,108
I need to get
here more often.

789
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:48,077
Oh, you get here plenty.

790
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,947
Jean?

791
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,648
Your little sister's here
to see you.

792
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:54,550
Hey, sue!
Hi. Hi, honey!

793
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:56,252
My sister is famous.

794
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:57,520
You got that right.

795
00:35:57,521 --> 00:35:59,522
I got something for you.

796
00:35:59,523 --> 00:36:01,924
What's this?

797
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:04,327
Wow! A pom-pom!
Thank you.

798
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,394
That's for you.

799
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:06,796
What do you feel like
doing today?

800
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,397
Can we read today?

801
00:36:08,398 --> 00:36:09,432
Look what I have!

802
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,833
<i>Little Red Riding Hood!</i>

803
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:12,668
Right. Your favorite book.

804
00:36:12,669 --> 00:36:14,170
Want to start
at the beginning?

805
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:15,938
Yes.
All right.

806
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:17,139
You ready?

807
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,575
Ready.

808
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:25,047
(chuckles)

809
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:31,087
"once upon a time,

810
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:34,557
"there was a little girl
who lived in the forest.

811
00:36:34,558 --> 00:36:37,827
"whenever she went out,
the little girl

812
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,962
"wore a red riding cloak,

813
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:41,530
"so everyone in the village

814
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:44,734
Called her
little red riding hood."

815
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,603
Right?
Right.

816
00:36:47,604 --> 00:36:48,871
(tina and Artie laughing)

817
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:50,506
Oh, no!

818
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:52,008
Oh, you're so
much faster!

819
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,076
You can't keep up?

820
00:36:54,077 --> 00:36:57,046
I can't. This
is so hard. No.

821
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:59,315
(groans)
no f-f-fair!

822
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:00,650
You have eight
years of practice!

823
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:03,753
Excelling at wheelchair races
is about my only advantage.

824
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,121
It's like your stutter.

825
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:08,858
It's mostly
just a big hassle.

826
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,962
This has been a really fun date.

827
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:15,731
But I want to get
out of this chair.

828
00:37:15,732 --> 00:37:17,199
Why?

829
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,203
So I can do this.

830
00:37:34,384 --> 00:37:35,818
I have to tell you something.

831
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,089
I've been faking it.

832
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,924
Faking what?

833
00:37:41,925 --> 00:37:42,859
I don't have a stutter.

834
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,947
I pretended to have
one in sixth grade

835
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:49,049
Because I didn't
want to give a speech

836
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,751
On the Missouri compromise.

837
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:53,987
I was really shy,

838
00:37:53,988 --> 00:37:56,590
And it made people
think I was weird,

839
00:37:56,591 --> 00:37:58,525
So they left me alone.

840
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:02,562
And it wasn't until I joined
glee club that I realized

841
00:38:02,563 --> 00:38:06,099
How much I was missing.

842
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,634
And I don't want to push
people away anymore.

843
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,238
You understand what
that's like, don't you?

844
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:14,007
No, I don't.

845
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:17,244
I would never try
to push people away

846
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:19,346
'cause being in a chair
kind of does that for you.

847
00:38:20,948 --> 00:38:23,517
I thought we had something
really important in common.

848
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:30,557
Wait, Artie. I'm sorry.

849
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,259
I am, too.

850
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,227
I'm sorry now
you get to be normal

851
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,364
And I'm going to be stuck in
this chair the rest of my life.

852
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:39,399
And that's not something
I can fake.

853
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,000
(drill whirrs loudly)

854
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:48,842
Hey, dad.

855
00:38:49,056 --> 00:38:50,158
What are you doing?

856
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,759
I'm making biscuits. What
does it look like I'm doing?

857
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:52,995
How did the tryout go?

858
00:38:53,997 --> 00:38:56,465
They gave the part
to Rachel.

859
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:58,067
I knew they were
going to rig it.

860
00:38:58,068 --> 00:39:01,137
I'm going down to that school
and I'm talking to Schuester.

861
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,239
I blew the note.

862
00:39:04,274 --> 00:39:06,075
I wanted to lose.

863
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:08,110
Kurt, I stuck my neck
out for you,

864
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:10,046
And you go
and you throw the game?

865
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:19,088
Dad, I've known who I
was since I was five.

866
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:21,190
I adapted.

867
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:22,758
Being different
made me stronger.

868
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:24,627
And at the end of the day,

869
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:28,431
It's what's going to get me
out of this cow town.

870
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:29,865
You never had to do that.

871
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:32,034
I can handle myself just fine.

872
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:33,803
No, you can't.

873
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,471
Not about this.

874
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,475
That phone call yesterday
was just the beginning.

875
00:39:39,476 --> 00:39:41,911
Especially if I get up
in front of a thousand people

876
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:43,246
To sing a girl's song.

877
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:49,485
When I saw you
right after you got the call,

878
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:52,154
And you were so hurt

879
00:39:52,155 --> 00:39:54,123
And so upset...

880
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,263
...It just killed me.

881
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:04,333
I'm not saying I'm going
to hide in the closet.

882
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:10,473
I'm-I'm proud of who I am.

883
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:15,144
I'm just saying that I love you
more than I love being a star.

884
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,615
You are your mother.

885
00:40:19,616 --> 00:40:24,186
You know,
she was always the strong one.

886
00:40:24,187 --> 00:40:25,388
Look, uh,

887
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:28,991
You want to help me put
a 195 on this bad boy, huh?

888
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:31,294
Let me change
into my coveralls.

889
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:33,296
This sweater's an
Alexander McQueen.

890
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,435
