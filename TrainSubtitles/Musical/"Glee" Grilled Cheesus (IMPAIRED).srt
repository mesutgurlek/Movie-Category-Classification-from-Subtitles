and Finn's not the quarterback</i>

3
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:06,928

Can you believe it? Kurt's dad</i>

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,564
<i>and Finn's mom are dating,
and are really happy together,</i>

5
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:10,232
<i>which makes Finn and Kurt
sort of like brothers.</i>

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,450
<i>They sure yell at each other
like brothers.</i>

7
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:13,152
Why is it so hard
for you to understand?

8
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:14,937
<i>Sue has a sister, Jean,
who she doesn't yell at at all.</i>

9
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:16,321
I will always
love you.

10
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:18,273
<i>Which sort of makes her
the only person</i>

11
00:00:18,324 --> 00:00:21,677
<i>Sue doesn't yell at. And that's
what you missed on Glee.</i>

<i>FINN:
It all started a week ago.</i>

13
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:25,964
<i>I was super hungry,
but my mom was gone,</i>

14
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:27,949
<i>so I busted out
the George Foreman.</i>

15
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:30,886
<i>It wasn't making the cool
grill marks it used to after</i>

16
00:00:30,954 --> 00:00:32,754
<i>I tried to use it
to dry my shoes,</i>

17
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:34,273
<i>but when it comes
to grilled cheese,</i>

18
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,607
<i>I'm not that fancy.</i>

19
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:37,976
<i>And when I pulled
the sandwich out,</i>

20
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:40,179
<i>I saw the face of God.</i>

21
00:00:40,263 --> 00:00:41,930
<i>Literally.</i>

22
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:44,483
<i>I had made a Grilled Cheesus.</i>

23
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,272
<i>I'm so hungry.
I'm not the most religious guy.</i>

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,491
<i>I sort of worship Eric Clapton
and Ochocinco,</i>

25
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:54,676
<i>but this was different, so,</i>

26
00:00:54,744 --> 00:00:58,030
<i>I decided to see what it felt
like to, you know, pray.</i>

27
00:00:58,097 --> 00:01:00,499
Dear Grilled Cheesus...

28
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:02,117
First of all,
you're super delicious.

29
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:03,485
Please, Grilled Cheesus,

30
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:05,454
please let us win
our first football game.

31
00:01:05,505 --> 00:01:07,172
It would mean so much to Artie,

32
00:01:07,257 --> 00:01:09,641
and I think you kind of
owe it to him.

33
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:12,494
I mean, you did sort of
screw him in the leg department.

34
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:14,997
And in return, Cheesy Lord,

35
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:17,749
I'll make sure we honour you
this week in Glee Club.

36
00:01:17,817 --> 00:01:20,719
{crowd roaring,
players grunting}

37
00:01:20,803 --> 00:01:22,003

38
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:23,188
{cheering}

39
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:29,328
Thank you, Grilled Cheesus.

40
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,987
Hey, Dad.
Hey, that's my boy.

41
00:01:39,038 --> 00:01:41,073
You forgot your breakfast.

42
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:42,524
Suzanne Somers says that
skipping breakfast is suicide.

43
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:44,293
What is this?

44
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,411
It's an egg white wrap
on a sprouted wheat tortilla,

45
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,829
half a grapefruit
and a green drink.

46
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:49,164
Where's my usual breakfast?

47
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:50,249
A Coke and two Slim Jims?

48
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,583
Yeah. Breakfast of champions.

49
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:53,034
Dad, you are not
a kid anymore.

50
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:54,536
You have to start
taking care of yourself.

51
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:55,837
Well, I guess with
enough hot sauce,

52
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:57,806
this will  all
right. Thanks.

53
00:01:57,873 --> 00:02:00,041
Hey, don't forget,
Friday night dinner is 6:00

54
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:01,560
instead of 7:00
this week.

55
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:03,312
Carole and Finn are coming over,

56
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:05,213
and she has to work
the night shift.

57
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:06,932
I-I can't do this Friday.

58
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:08,901
<i>It's Sing-along Sound of Music
at the El Royale theatre.</i>

59
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:10,102
It's a once-a-year event.

60
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,020
And last week,
you had to camp out early

61
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:14,356
<i>so you could be first in line
for those Grey's Anatomy DVDs.</i>

62
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:15,691
Season six, Dad.

63
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:17,559
Okay, those Friday night
dinners are a ritual

64
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,745
in our family--
one your mom started.

65
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,280
I know, but I'm a teenager.

66
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:23,248
Friday nights
are kind of important to me.

67
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,450
Why are you making me
feel guilty about this?

68
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:27,119
I, of all people,
know how important

69
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:28,754
the relationship is
between you and Carole.

70
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:30,122
Those dinners are more
than important.

71
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:32,407
They're sacred.
Okay, the whole point

72
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:34,760
of having something sacred is
that it takes precedence

73
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:36,878
over anything else
you got going on.

74
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,413
<i>Sing-along Sound of Music
is sacred to me.</i>

75
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:39,781
What? You think
I don't know that?

76
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:41,383
Okay, wasn't I the one
who bought you

77
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:42,684
that Maria bonnet
when you were six?

78
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:44,052
Okay, the point is,

79
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:46,421
if you start giving up stuff
like Friday night dinners,

80
00:02:46,472 --> 00:02:48,006
then you got nothing
to hold onto.

81
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:49,358
Okay, let's face it, Kurt.

82
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:51,443
If we don't schedule it,
then we don't hang out.

83
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:53,111
If we don't hang out,
then our lives--

84
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:54,479
they just go right by
each other.

85
00:02:54,564 --> 00:02:56,198
And we don't share very much.

86
00:02:56,265 --> 00:02:59,534
I'm sorry, but I'm not missing
something that I look forward to

87
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:02,571
all year just for
another dinner.

88
00:03:02,622 --> 00:03:04,406
Maybe we could do it
Thursday or something.

89
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,159
I got to tell you, Kurt.

90
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:11,380
I'm real disappointed in you.

91
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:16,251
{school bell ringing}

92
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:18,053
Mr. Shue?

93
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,338
I have something to say.

94
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:21,122
Something happened to me,

95
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:24,259
and I can't really get into it,
but it's shaken me to my core.

96
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,143
Oh, my God, he's coming out.

97
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:26,728
Why, yes,

98
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:29,765
there is a man who's sort of
recently come into my life, and

99
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:32,184
that man is Jesus Christ.

100
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:34,903
That's way worse.

101
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,771
And I know
there's others

102
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:37,055
in here who dig him, too.

103
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:39,091
And so I thought,
maybe this week,

104
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:41,710
we could pay tribute
to him in music.

105
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:44,780
You know, pay
tribute to Jesus.

106
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:46,331
Sorry, uh,
but if I wanted to sing

107
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,866
about Jesus, I'd go to church.

108
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,951
And the reason I don't go
to church is because

109
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:52,537
most churches don't think
very much of gay people.

110
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,873
Or women. Or science.

111
00:03:54,957 --> 00:03:56,475
I don't see anything wrong
with getting a little church

112
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:57,426
up in here.
I agree.

113
00:03:57,493 --> 00:03:58,710
I've had a really hard year,

114
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:00,195
and I turned to God
a lot for help.

115
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:02,447
I, for one, wouldn't mind
saying thanks.

116
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:05,100
Thanks for what? That it
didn't come out a lizard baby?

117
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,668
Whenever I pray, I fall asleep.

118
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,969
Well, guys,
maybe our song selections

119
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:09,438
don't have to be about Jesus.

120
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:11,857
We could do songs
about spirituality.

121
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:14,309
You got a problem with Jesus?

122
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,811
Oh, I got no problem
with the guy.

123
00:04:15,862 --> 00:04:16,978
I'm a total Jew for Jesus.

124
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,280
He's my number one Heb.

125
00:04:18,348 --> 00:04:20,599
What I don't like seeing
is people using J-money

126
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,951
to cramp everybody
else's style, 'cause it seems

127
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:25,620
to me that true spirituality
or whatever you want to call it

128
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:27,539
is about enjoying the life
that you've been given.

129
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:29,958
I mean, I see God every time
I make out with a new chick.

130
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:31,309
RACHEL: Okay, okay,
that doesn't make

131
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:33,245
any sense.
In fact, it's stupid.

132
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:36,081
Are you calling
Mr. Billy Joel stupid?

133
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:38,250
At this time, I'd like
to continue my streak

134
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:39,868
of doing only songs
by Jewish artists.

135
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,422
Hit it.

136

Oh!

{cheering}

160
00:06:07,857 --> 00:06:10,609
Well, according to this,
I've still got two left, but

161
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:11,860
let me check,
'cause I don't trust the guy

162
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:13,111
who does my inventory.

163
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:14,830
Who's that?
Me.

164
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:16,364
Oh. Oh, geez.

165
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:18,233
Oh.

166
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:19,835
Oh.

167
00:06:19,902 --> 00:06:21,536
Hey, you okay, man?

168
00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:23,588
Yeah, just a little
indigestion, you know.

169
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:26,208
Don't buy salami
at the gas station.

Kurt?

172
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:57,739
Can we talk to you outside?

173
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:08,333
Where is he?

174
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:10,085
Is he dead?

175
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:11,469
No, he's alive, but I'm sorry

176
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:13,071
I don't have
any other good news.

177
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,923
I want to see him.
He hasn't regained
consciousness.

178
00:07:14,974 --> 00:07:16,007
WILL:
I thought he had
a heart attack.

179
00:07:16,092 --> 00:07:17,259
Brought on by an arrhythmia,

180
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,844
which caused a lack
of blood to his brain.

181
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:19,845
That's what made him
lose consciousness

182
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:21,012
and what's keeping him comatose.

183
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,430
We have him on lidocaine,

184
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:24,933
but there's no guarantees
they're going to work

185
00:07:24,984 --> 00:07:26,401
or what kind of damage was done

186
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:28,019
to his brain
by the lack of oxygen.

187
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:29,571
I don't understand
what you're saying.

188
00:07:29,638 --> 00:07:31,306
When is he going
to wake up?

189
00:07:31,357 --> 00:07:32,807
I don't know.

190
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,578
Okay, just-just...
just take us to him now, please.

191
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:40,949
{monitor beeping}

192
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:52,027
I need a minute.

193
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,047
I don't think you
should be alone, Kurt.

194
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:58,600
Please just give me a moment
alone with my father.

195
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:05,206
We'll be right outside.

196
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,954
Dad?

197
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:25,543
Can you hear me?

198
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:29,514
If you can hear me,

199
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:31,433
squeeze my hand.

200
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,671
I'm holding yours right now.

201
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:42,227
Just squeeze back.

202
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,896
Come on, Dad.

203
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:47,482
<i>Just squeeze my nd.</i>

204
00:08:52,403 --> 00:08:54,305
<i>What up, Grilled Cheesus?</i>

205
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:56,540
<i>I need to ask you
for something.</i>

206
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:58,159
I didn't go to Sunday school
so I don't know

207
00:08:58,226 --> 00:09:00,544
if God works the same as a genie
and I only get three wishes,

208
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:01,946
but here's the thing.

209
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:03,914
Dating Rachel is great,

210
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:06,967
but she's kind of a prude,
and I'm sort of going crazy.

211
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:08,719
Anyway, her boobs
aren't that great,

212
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,688
but they're still girl boobs,

213
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:12,456
and I'd really like
to touch them.

214
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:14,258
So, Cheesus,

215
00:09:14,326 --> 00:09:15,926
considering
that I've dedicated a week

216
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:18,212
of my musical life to you,

217
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,564
I hope you can see it
in your heart

218
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:22,233
to answer my prayers.

219
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:26,287
Amen.

220
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:27,922
{school bell ringing}

221
00:09:40,118 --> 00:09:41,802
SANTANA:
Hey, Kurt.

222
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,255
We're really sorry
about your dad's heart attack.

223
00:09:44,306 --> 00:09:46,056
Thanks, Santana.

224
00:09:46,124 --> 00:09:47,758
I did a book report
on heart attacks,

225
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:49,626
if you want to give it
to the doctor.

226
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:51,312
I got knocked down
an entire letter grade

227
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:52,963
'cause it was written
in crayon.

228
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:55,899
What the hell happened?

229
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:57,418
My dad's in the hospital.
I know.

230
00:09:57,502 --> 00:09:59,837
My mom just called me. I feel
like I'm the last one to know!

231
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:01,505
Well, I'm sorry, Finn.
It didn't occur to me

232
00:10:01,573 --> 00:10:02,923
to call you, because
he's not your father.

233
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:04,408
Yeah, well, he's the closest
I'm ever going to get, okay?

234
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:07,795
I know it may not look like
what everybody else has,

235
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,980
but I thought we were...
sort of a family.

236
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,851
Look, I-I guess I just...

237
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:15,252
I didn't like overhearing

238
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:17,154
other people talking about it
in gym class.

239
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:26,564
Hey, guys.

240
00:10:26,615 --> 00:10:29,766
Our thoughts are all
with Kurt, and, uh,

241
00:10:29,818 --> 00:10:31,785
I know it's sort of hard to
really focus on anything else...

242
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,903
MERCEDES:
Mr. Shue

243
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:34,188
Yeah.
I've been struggling, trying

244
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:36,006
to figure out
what I wanted to say to Kurt

245
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:38,075
all day,
and I realize

246
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:39,409
I don't want to say it,
I want to sing it.

247
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:44,715
This song is about
being in a very dark place,

248
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:45,799
and turning to God.

249
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:47,801
It's a spiritual song,
Mr. Shue.

250
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:49,586
Is that okay?
It's fine.

251
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:53,474
Tina, Quinn, can you
help me out, please?

252

Thank you,

00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:38,629
Mercedes.

277
00:12:38,696 --> 00:12:40,631
Your voice is stunning, but...

278
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:42,199
I don't believe in God.

279
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,751
Wait, what?

280
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:45,002
You've all professed
your beliefs.

281
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:46,420
I'm just stating mine.

282
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:49,256
I think God is kind of like
Santa Claus for adults.

283
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,373
Otherwise,

284
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:52,026
God's kind of a jerk,

285
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:53,210
isn't he?

286
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:55,378
I mean, he makes
me gay and then

287
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,848
has his followers going
around telling me it's
something that I chose.

<i>As if someone would

every single day of their life.

290
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:02,719
And right now

291
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:04,521
I don't want a heavenly father.

292
00:13:04,572 --> 00:13:06,006
I want my real one back.

293
00:13:06,074 --> 00:13:08,158
But Kurt, how
do you know for sure?

294
00:13:08,226 --> 00:13:10,277
I mean, you can't prove
that there's no God.

295
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:12,246
<i>You can't prove that there
isn't a magic teapot</i>

on the dark side of the moon

00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:15,783
with a dwarf inside of it

298
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:18,285
that reads romance novels
and shoots lightning

299
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:21,955
out of its boobs, but it seems
pretty unlikely, doesn't it?

300
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,091
Is God an evil dwarf?

301
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,909
We shouldn't be
talking like this.

302
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:27,044
It's not right.

303
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:29,246
I'm sorry, Quinn.

304
00:13:29,297 --> 00:13:32,049
But you all can believe
whatever you want to.

305
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,234
But I can't believe
something I don't.

306
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:36,520
I appreciate your thoughts...

307
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:39,422
but I don't want your prayers.

How did you even find out
about the lesson?</i>

309
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:45,612
I have cameras
everywhere, William.

310
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:47,597
I'm ving a lesson
on spirituality.

311
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:49,316
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

312
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:51,452
Well, the big deal is
that this is a public school,

313
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:52,703
and there's this little thing

314
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,821
called separation
of church and state,

315
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,155
<i>which happens
to be the pillar</i>

316
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,606
of a functioning
civil society.

317
00:13:56,658 --> 00:13:57,958
But Sue,
children should be

318
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:00,544
allowed to profess
whatever faith they choose.

319
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:03,213
At the BET Awards,
but not in a public school.

320
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:04,631
Sue, I'm trying
to help these kids.

321
00:14:04,716 --> 00:14:06,750
Kurt is struggling with
some really tough issues.

322
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:09,503
Well, William, if your kids want
to praise Jesus in class,

323
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:12,455
I suggest they enroll at Sweet
Holy Mother of God Academy

324
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:13,507
on I Love Jesus Street,

325
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:14,758
but not here.

326
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:16,459
This country is
not a monarchy, William.

327
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:17,811
Trust me, I've tried.

328
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:20,514
And as much as I enjoy
giving impromptu civics lessons,

329
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:21,865
I got work to do.

330
00:14:28,556 --> 00:14:30,807
Finn, please... sit.

331
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,948
You're upset about
Kurt's dad, too?

332
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:39,650
Yes.

333
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:42,069
But more importantly,
let's discuss

334
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:44,688
your newfound love for Jesus
and how it's affecting me.

335
00:14:44,756 --> 00:14:47,657
I want this
relationship

336
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:49,059
to go the distance,

337
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:51,712
but I need to know that
when I'm 25 and I've won

338
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,096
a bunch of Tonys,
and I'm ready

339
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:54,898
to have intercourse and babies,
that those babies will

340
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:56,666
be raised in
a certain way.
You don't think

341
00:14:56,718 --> 00:14:58,068
you're gonna have sex
till you're 25?

342
00:14:58,136 --> 00:15:00,170
I want my children to be raised
in the Jewish faith.

343
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:01,889
Both of my dads' peoples
were slaves once.

344
00:15:01,973 --> 00:15:04,608
I need to know that my children
will be free to worship

345
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:06,226
<i>in the way that
I decide is right.</i>

346
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:08,645
Sure. Of course.

347
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:10,998
Yeah, they should totally
go to Jew church and...

348
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:12,599
and wear those hats and...

349
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,885
and eat that salty orange
stuff with their bagels.

350
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,293
Let's lay down on the bed.

351
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:24,411
Okay.

352
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,884
{whispers}:
Finn...

353
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:32,753
I'd like to give you something

354
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,472
in exchange
for what you gave me.

355
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:41,878
¶¶  ¶¶ 

356
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:53,273
{whispers}:
Thank you, Grilled Cheesus.

357
00:15:53,358 --> 00:15:55,826
I need to know what's going on
with that Glee Club.

358
00:15:55,893 --> 00:15:57,560
Brittany, Jugs the Clown, go.

359
00:15:57,612 --> 00:15:59,062
Mostly just everyone's
really sad

360
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,198
for Kurt, and no one
really knows how to help.

361
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:03,033
I made him a card
that said "Heart attacks

362
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:04,434
are just from
loving too much."

363
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:05,619
Schuster’s
still pushing

364
00:16:05,687 --> 00:16:07,754
the Lil' Jeezy?
I guess so.

365
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:10,374
Although I don't really see
what the big deal is.

366
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:11,925
But Kurt's
definitely not into it.

367
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:14,428
How's your father?

368
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:16,746
They say his condition
is critical

369
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:17,848
but stable.

370
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:19,099
Good news, I guess.

371
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:20,717
I'm sorry for what you're
going through, Lady.

372
00:16:20,768 --> 00:16:22,319
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

373
00:16:22,387 --> 00:16:24,805
And I guess I don't have to--
I think Mary Lou Retton's,

374
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:26,440
like, an orphan or something.

375
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:27,975
I don't like

376
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:29,643
what Schuster’s doing
in that classroom

377
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:30,894
even more than usual.

378
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:32,929
But I can't go
to the school board

379
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,715
without an official complaint
from a student.

380
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:38,485
So you want me
to be your scapegoat?

381
00:16:38,553 --> 00:16:40,804
{quietly}: No.

382
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:42,556
You don't understand.

383
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,260
I know at times I mess around
with you guys for fun.

384
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:48,044
I admit it--
it aids digestion.

385
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:51,047
But I'm not joking here.

386
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:56,069
I want to be your champion.

387
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:02,247
What is wrong with you?

388
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:03,315
I'm sorry, Madame Secretary,

389
00:17:03,383 --> 00:17:04,967
I'm gonna have to call you back.

390
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:06,335
Love to Bill.

391
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:08,587
There is a boy
in that Glee Club

392
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:10,222
that might
lose his father.

393
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,207
How could you get in the way
when the only thing

394
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:14,510
anybody is trying to do
is give that poor child

395
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:15,877
just a little bit of comfort?

396
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:17,146
What happened

397
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:18,397
to you, Sue?

398
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:20,065
Please tell me
what horrible, horrible thing

399
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,351
happened to you that made you
such a miserable tyrant?

400
00:17:22,402 --> 00:17:23,602
Have a seat.

401
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:26,855
Since I was
a little girl,

402
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:28,107
I've had exactly

403
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:30,442
one hero.

404
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:32,111
My big sister.

405
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:34,196
You know how much
I worshipped her?

406
00:17:34,247 --> 00:17:38,000
She was the sun
and the moon to me.

407
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:40,502
And while I was
still very young,

408
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,372
I noticed that other people
didn't feel the way I did.

409
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,207
People were rude to her.

410
00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:47,292
They were cruel.

411
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:49,178
They laughed at her.

412
00:17:49,245 --> 00:17:51,430
And so I began to pray.

413
00:17:51,514 --> 00:17:53,782
I prayed every night
for her to get better.

414
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,001
And nothing changed.

415
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,605
So I prayed harder.

416
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:05,144
And after a while I realized
it wasn't that I wasn't praying

417
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:07,095
hard enough...

418
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:08,981
it's that no one was listening.

419
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:15,154
Asking someone to believe
in a fantasy...

420
00:18:15,238 --> 00:18:18,607
however comforting,
isn't a moral thing to do.

421
00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:20,125
It's cruel.

422
00:18:20,193 --> 00:18:23,412
Don't you think that's
just a little bit arrogant?

423
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:25,714
It's as arrogant as telling
someone how to believe in God,

424
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:28,383
and if they don't accept it,
no matter how openhearted

425
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:32,237
or honest their dissent,
they're going to hell.

426
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:34,306
Well, that doesn't sound
very Christian, does it?

427
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:36,725
Well, if that's what
you believe, that's fine.

428
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,477
But please keep it to yourself.

429
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:40,562
So long as you do the same.

430
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,148
That kid could lose
his father at any moment.

431
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:45,167
You should start
preparing him for that.

432
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:47,135
Now get the hell
out of my office.

433
00:18:47,187 --> 00:18:49,354
I realize you're only
half orangutan,

434
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:53,192
but I'm still very allergi
to your lustrous ginger mane.

435
00:18:56,362 --> 00:18:59,081
Last week we were too sexy,
this week we're too religious--

436
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:01,166
we can't win.
Now I know what
Miley feels like.

437
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:02,817
The real tragedy here
is that I found

438
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:04,703
the most perfect spiritual song
to sing this week,

439
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:07,005
and now it's been torn away
from me like Sophie's daughter.

440
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,208
Guys, you can still sing
whatever songs you like

441
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:11,460
that sum up your feelings
about God, about spirit.

442
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:12,928
You just can't do
it on school time.

443
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:14,379
I hope you're happy, Kurt.

444
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:16,181
Having the week of
my life, actually.

445
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:19,017
Guys... back off Kurt, okay?

446
00:19:19,085 --> 00:19:21,136
He had every right
to speak his mind.

447
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:23,472
Look, Kurt, we're sympathetic
to what you're going through,

448
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:26,174
but siding with Miss Sylvester
isn't gonna do anyone any good.

449
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:27,359
It's doing me
some good.

450
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:28,977
Now I don't have
to sit around

451
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:30,646
listening to all
you mental patients

452
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:34,733
talk about how's there's a God
when I know there isn't one.

453
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:36,818
{school bell rings}

454
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:39,404
Cheesus, I don't need
to tell you how much you rule.

455
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:41,690
You've given me everything
I've prayed for,

456
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:44,243
and it turns out Rachel's boobs
are really awesome.

457
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:47,129
Anyway, I need another favor,
so, Cheesus...

458
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:49,665
I pray that I'm
made quarterback again.

459
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:52,084
Sam's a good dude--
I just think that I can deliver

460
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:53,652
your message to the world
more powerfully

461
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:55,787
if I'm the most popular guy
in the school again.

462
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:56,972
PUCK:
What are you doing?

463
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:58,106
Nothing. Eating.

464
00:19:59,742 --> 00:20:03,111
So I pray before I eat now--
what's the big deal?

465
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:04,830
You're not gonna tell anybody
about this, are you?

466
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:06,481
No. It's cool.

467
00:20:06,532 --> 00:20:07,916
To tell you the truth,

468
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:10,502
I actually went to temple
with my nanny yesterday.

469
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,939
I know it makes me a wuss,
but I'm bummed about Kurt's dad.

470
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:15,707
I've kind of been
praying for him.

471
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,125
I know how
hard it is

472
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:19,995
not to have a
father, you know?

473
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:21,430
What do you pray for?

474
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:22,814
Yeah. Same stuff.

475
00:20:22,882 --> 00:20:25,300
You burned your grilled cheese.

476
00:20:30,523 --> 00:20:32,240
{slaps arm, winces}

477
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:34,159
Why are we in the park?
'Cause I don't

478
00:20:34,227 --> 00:20:36,328
want anything coming
between us and God.

479
00:20:36,396 --> 00:20:37,663
And because Yentl
was outside when

480
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:39,414
she sang this
song in the movie.

481
00:20:39,482 --> 00:20:43,035
I just hope that God
hears this song as
a prayer for Burt Hummel

482
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,787
and decides to bring
him back to us.

Of this flickering candle...

¶¶  Illuminate the night ¶¶

yesterday has come and gone ¶¶

¶¶  The wind is so much colder ¶¶

¶¶  The world I see is
so much bigger ¶¶

I had no choice? ¶¶

anything I'm saying? ¶¶

you taught me ¶¶

¶¶  Can all the words
in all the books ¶¶

00:23:14,687 --> 00:23:18,907

what lies ahead? ¶¶

00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:14,746
Who's next?

532
00:24:14,814 --> 00:24:17,098
What's going on in here?

533
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,467
We-We were just praying
for your dad.

534
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:21,703
MERCEDES: Rachel, Quinn, and I
are taking turns.

535
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:23,622
We're from different
denominations and religions,

536
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:25,507
so we figured one of us
is bound to be right.

537
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:27,792
I didn't ask you to do this.

538
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,245
Honey, I know you're upset about
what's happening, I get it,

539
00:24:30,313 --> 00:24:33,164
but friends help out,
even when you don't ask.

540
00:24:33,232 --> 00:24:35,467
Mr. Kurt Hummel?

541
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:37,402
Dude, why didn't you just tell
us you wanted to pray in Muslim?

542
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,171
I'm not Muslim, I'm a Sikh.

543
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,157
She's going to see
if acupuncture will improve

544
00:24:42,224 --> 00:24:44,993
the circulation
to my dad's brain.

545
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,947
Amazingly, needles pierce
the skin better than psalms.

546
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:50,582
Can you all please leave now?

547
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,121
We just wanted
to do something.

548
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:11,415
SAM:
Red 42 on three.

549
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:12,349
ALL:
Break.

550
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:15,252
Wait.

551
00:25:15,303 --> 00:25:17,137
That cornerback's been cheating
right all night.

552
00:25:17,222 --> 00:25:18,422
We should naked bootleg left.

553
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:19,723
That ogre linebacker's
on the left.

554
00:25:19,774 --> 00:25:20,941
He's been killing me all game.

555
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:22,476
Dude, trust me, I'm the only guy

556
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,278
who's ever actually won
a game on this field.

557
00:25:24,362 --> 00:25:25,595
{laughter}

558
00:25:25,647 --> 00:25:30,600
Okay, naked bootleg left,
I keep on three.

559
00:25:30,652 --> 00:25:31,768
All right,
you ready?
ALL:
Break.

560
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:35,406
That's not what I called.

561
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:38,542
Yah! Hike!

562
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:40,044
{grunting}

563
00:25:50,555 --> 00:25:51,955
Is he okay?
His shoulder's
dislocated.

564
00:25:52,007 --> 00:25:53,123
This is
what happens

565
00:25:53,174 --> 00:25:54,975
when you change my plays
in the huddle.

566
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,927
SAM:
I don't understand, that
guy came out of nowhere.

567
00:25:56,995 --> 00:25:58,946
BEISTE:
I know, that kid's been
cheating right all night.

568
00:25:59,014 --> 00:26:00,147
No reason for
him to be there.

569
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:01,631
It's just bad luck.

570
00:26:01,683 --> 00:26:04,518
We need to get him
to the E.R.
Okay, let's go.

571
00:26:04,602 --> 00:26:06,303
It's in your
hands now, Lurch.

572
00:26:06,354 --> 00:26:08,305
Congratulations, you're
the quarterback again.

573
00:26:15,146 --> 00:26:16,447
I know things have been
pretty morose

574
00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:17,915
around here this past week,

575
00:26:17,982 --> 00:26:19,483
but I want to celebrate
some good news

576
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:20,918
for our little family.

577
00:26:20,985 --> 00:26:22,286
Let's hear it for Finn
on getting back

578
00:26:22,337 --> 00:26:23,737
his quarterback job

579
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:25,289
and leading the Titans to a win

580
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,674
in their second game
of the season.

581
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:28,959
{applause}

582
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,627
Yeah, too bad that Sam kid
had to have his arm

583
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:32,796
basically ripped off for it
to happen, but it's good

584
00:26:32,864 --> 00:26:33,931
to have you back
in the saddle, brother.

585
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:38,218
Mr. Shue, if I may?

586
00:26:38,303 --> 00:26:39,803
Yeah.

587
00:26:39,854 --> 00:26:43,474
Um, I wanted to thank everyone
for your kind e-mails

588
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:45,609
and queries
about my dad,

589
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:49,263
but for your information, his
condition mains the same.

590
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:54,485
I need to express myself,
so with your permission,

591
00:26:54,536 --> 00:26:57,287
Mr. Shue, I've prepared
a number for the occasion.

592
00:26:57,355 --> 00:26:59,356
WILL:
Of course, Kurt.

593
00:26:59,407 --> 00:27:01,959
On the day of my mom's funeral,

594
00:27:02,026 --> 00:27:06,947
when they were lowering her body
into the ground, I was crying.

595
00:27:07,015 --> 00:27:08,966
I mean,
that was it.

596
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:12,052
It was the last time
I was ever going to see her,

597
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:13,971
and I remember
I looked up at my dad

598
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:17,591
and I, I just wanted him
to say something,

599
00:27:17,675 --> 00:27:22,646
just something to make me feel
like my whole world wasn't over,

600
00:27:22,714 --> 00:27:26,183
and he just took my hand
and squeezed it.

601
00:27:28,186 --> 00:27:30,721
And just knowing
that those hands were there

602
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:35,125
to take care of me...
that was enough.

603
00:27:35,193 --> 00:27:37,277
This is for my dad.

604
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:41,331
¶¶  Yeah, I'll ¶¶ 

605
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:45,836
{string section fading up}
¶¶  Tell you something ¶¶ 

606
00:27:45,903 --> 00:27:51,458
¶¶  I think you'll understand ¶¶ 

607
00:27:51,543 --> 00:27:55,129
¶¶  When I say ¶¶ 

608
00:27:55,213 --> 00:27:58,632
¶¶  That something ¶¶ 

609
00:27:58,716 --> 00:28:00,717
¶¶  I want to hold ¶¶ 

610
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:05,139
¶¶  Your hand ¶¶

¶¶  Your hand ¶¶ 

613
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:16,700
¶¶  I want to hold your hand ¶¶ 

614
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:20,537
¶¶  Oh, please ¶¶ 

615
00:28:20,605 --> 00:28:24,324
¶¶  Say to me ¶¶ 

616
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:28,945
¶¶  You'll let me be your man ¶¶ 

617
00:28:28,997 --> 00:28:31,715
¶¶  And please ¶¶ 

618
00:28:31,782 --> 00:28:35,369
¶¶  Say to me ¶¶ 

619
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:38,889
¶¶  You'll let me hold ¶¶ 

620
00:28:38,956 --> 00:28:42,810
¶¶  Your hand ¶¶ 

621
00:28:42,894 --> 00:28:44,812
¶¶  Now let me hold ¶¶ 

622
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:48,798
¶¶  Your hand ¶¶ 

623
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,351
¶¶  I want to hold ¶¶ 

624
00:28:51,436 --> 00:28:54,188

646
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,664
Kurt, can I talk
to you for a second?

647
00:30:14,852 --> 00:30:17,354
I know you're going through a
really scary time right now,

648
00:30:17,422 --> 00:30:21,174
but I feel like I don't know
how to be around you anymore,

649
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:24,595
and I know you're not really
spiritual or whatever,

650
00:30:24,662 --> 00:30:26,897
but I feel like you're
closing yourself to a world

651
00:30:26,965 --> 00:30:28,465
of experiences that
might surprise you.

652
00:30:30,652 --> 00:30:33,437
You're right.

653
00:30:33,488 --> 00:30:34,521
I'm sorry.

654
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,641
I shouldn't be pushing
my friends away,

655
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:40,810
especially friends
as fabulous as you.

656
00:30:41,996 --> 00:30:45,565
Do me a favor-- one thing.

657
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:47,901
Come to church with
me this Sunday.

658
00:30:47,969 --> 00:30:49,136
Our church does
this thing

659
00:30:49,203 --> 00:30:51,204
where we dedicate the
service to someone,

660
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:54,741
and I got them to dedicate
this Sunday to your dad.

661
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:56,927
I don't know.
You get to wear

662
00:30:56,995 --> 00:30:58,161
a fabulous hat.

663
00:31:01,382 --> 00:31:04,551
Mercedes, you had me
at "fabulous hat."

Come on, let's go to class.

666

<i>{school bell ringing}</i>

667
00:31:12,447 --> 00:31:13,897
I have to confess something.

668
00:31:13,949 --> 00:31:15,866
I'm the reason Sam got hurt.

669
00:31:15,934 --> 00:31:17,651
I asked for three
things to happen--

670
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:20,120
one, for us to win our
first football game,

671
00:31:20,205 --> 00:31:22,239
two, to get to second base
with Rachel, and three,

672
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,291
to be the quarterback on
the football team again.

673
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:26,510
All those three things happened
because I prayed for them

674
00:31:26,577 --> 00:31:28,429
to Grilled Cheesus.

675
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:31,999
Okay.

676
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:34,852
Where to start?
No, no, I know it sounds
crazy, but it isn't.

677
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:36,470
Jesus appeared to
me on a sandwich

678
00:31:36,554 --> 00:31:38,472
and it has special
powers, I'm telling you,

679
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,140
but I didn't mean for
anybody to get hurt.

680
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:42,192
Okay, let's just--
let's take a second.

681
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,978
Okay?
Um...

682
00:31:44,062 --> 00:31:47,531
look, first, you won
the football game

683
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,816
because you actually
have a coach

684
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,317
who spends the game
watching the plays

685
00:31:50,402 --> 00:31:51,652
rather than biting
his toenails.

686
00:31:51,736 --> 00:31:55,823
And God didn't let you
touch Rachel's boobs.

687
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,291
Rachel did.

688
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,710
Just the sides of them, but
wait, why would she do that?

689
00:31:59,777 --> 00:32:02,079
Well, what were you
doing right before you
were touching them?

690
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,448
What?
I remember yawning.

691
00:32:04,516 --> 00:32:06,950
Right, 'cause we were talking
about emotional stuff.

692
00:32:07,002 --> 00:32:09,219
Oh, yes, well,
there you go, that's it.

693
00:32:09,287 --> 00:32:10,620
Girls like that.

694
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:13,290
She felt close to you, thus
the inappropriate touching.

695
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:17,294
Uh, more importantly,
you didn't hurt Sam.

696
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:19,697
It was a 300-pound left tackle
who just got expelled

697
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:23,534
because he's on steroids
and he's 23.

698
00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:27,054
God works in all kinds
of mysterious ways,

699
00:32:27,122 --> 00:32:29,840
but I'm pretty sure
he doesn't spend a lot of time

700
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:33,577
trying to speak to us
through sandwiches.

701
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:36,847
You look disappointed.

702
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,966
I am.

703
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,250
It was sort of cool

704
00:32:40,318 --> 00:32:43,637
feeling like I had this
direct line to God.

705
00:32:43,722 --> 00:32:44,938
Now I just feel

706
00:32:45,023 --> 00:32:47,858
like everybody
else, you know,

707
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:51,595
like we're all just
floating around in space.

708
00:32:51,646 --> 00:32:52,613
I don't like that.

709
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:54,031
You're not alone.

710
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,984
The big questions are
really big for a reason--

711
00:32:57,068 --> 00:32:59,136
they're hard.

712
00:32:59,204 --> 00:33:00,270
But you know what?

713
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:02,856
Absolutely everybody
struggles with them.

I thought we couldn't

Evidently,
we can't sing about faith,

but we can sing
about losing faith?

That's sort of what I

it seemed like
you felt differently.

Hi.

I have a favor
to ask you guys.

758
00:35:40,114 --> 00:35:42,449
My friend Kurt Hummel's dad is
in the hospital.

759
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:44,701
And it's pretty bad.

760
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:47,938
And I know we have all of
our own worries and troubles,

761
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:49,656
but if we could just
put them aside

762
00:35:49,724 --> 00:35:52,125
and focus all of our prayers
and give them to Burt Hummel,

763
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,444
and to my friend Kurt.

764
00:35:54,495 --> 00:35:58,715
I know you don't believe in God,
and you don't believe

765
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,500
in the power of prayer,
and that's okay.

766
00:36:00,585 --> 00:36:01,835
To each his own.

767
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,337
But you've got to believe

768
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:04,888
in something.

769
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:07,758

Oh!
Sue, you're letting me win.

No, I swear it. I'm not!

You're letting me win, Sue.

You're letting me win.

Do you?

No, I don't.

Why not?

822
00:38:50,183 --> 00:38:52,200
Because
when we were little girls,

823
00:38:52,285 --> 00:38:55,036
you were perfect in my eyes...

824
00:38:56,806 --> 00:38:59,641
And I watched the world
be cruel to you, so...

825
00:38:59,709 --> 00:39:01,743
God never makes mistakes.

826
00:39:03,212 --> 00:39:05,013
That's what I believe.

827
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:09,634
You want me
to pray for you, Sue?

828
00:39:09,702 --> 00:39:12,337
Yeah. That would be nice.

I can't do that.

Mercedes took me to
church on Sunday.

00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,180
It's funny, but when
the choir was singing,

835
00:39:39,248 --> 00:39:42,384
this memory flashed
into my head.

836
00:39:42,451 --> 00:39:46,805
Do you remember our first Friday
night dinner after Mom died?

837
00:39:46,872 --> 00:39:48,807
You tried to
make a chicken.

838
00:39:48,874 --> 00:39:50,976
I guess you
wanted me to feel

839
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:52,811
like there was
something still normal.

840
00:39:56,215 --> 00:39:58,650
You put it on the table,

841
00:39:58,717 --> 00:40:03,772
and you cut into
it, and it was raw.

842
00:40:03,856 --> 00:40:06,608
{laughs} And we both looked at
each other for a second,

843
00:40:06,676 --> 00:40:08,743
and cracked up
before we remembered

844
00:40:08,811 --> 00:40:11,296
that we weren't
supposed to yet.

845
00:40:15,668 --> 00:40:18,486
I'm sorry about the
other day, Dad.

846
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:20,855
I should have let those
guys pray for you.

847
00:40:20,923 --> 00:40:23,341
It wasn't about me.

848
00:40:23,409 --> 00:40:27,295
It was about you,
and... it was nice.

{monitor beeping}

850
00:40:33,202 --> 00:40:35,086
I don't believe in God, Dad.

851
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,125
But I believe in you.

852
00:40:43,946 --> 00:40:45,780
And I believe in us.

853
00:40:48,284 --> 00:40:50,685
You and me--

854
00:40:50,753 --> 00:40:53,071
that's what's sacred to me.

855
00:40:56,108 --> 00:40:58,076
And I am...

856
00:41:03,332 --> 00:41:06,668
I'm so sorry that I never
got to tell you that.
