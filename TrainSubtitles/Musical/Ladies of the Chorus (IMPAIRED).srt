because a few narrow-minded people

925
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,990
object to the way you've been
earning your own living?

926
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,714
You'd be willing to give up the man
you love, everything, without a fight?

927
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,239
Just what are
you driving at?

928
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,192
Running away will only
make things worse.

929
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,914
Peggy would be bitter and
frustrated for the rest of her life.

930
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,715
Now, our children love each other and want
to get married. Does anything else matter?

931
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,480
I should have told you. I promised
Peggy and her mother I would.

932
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,229
But you didn't. Not that it would
have made much difference anyway.

933
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,431
Randy, take Peggy
and her mother downstairs.

934
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,596
Well, what about your friends?
I'll take care of my friends.

Honey, it's like
an opening night.

Um, attention. Attention.
Quiet, everybody.

We're going right on

But first, I want you to meet Mr Mackay,
who will accompany the next number.

It's really more than I deserve
after all these years.

I suppose you're saying to yourselves,
"Well, not bad for an amateur. "

983
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,439
But I have a confession to make.

I'm not really
an amateur at all.
