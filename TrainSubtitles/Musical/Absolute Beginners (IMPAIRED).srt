I don't care what people say

MAN OVER MEGAPHONE: My friends,

989
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,960
a specter is haunting Britain.

990
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,154
The specter of immigration.

991
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,862
People of Kensington,
time is running out.

992
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,386
But a great man
has returned to our shores,

993
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:03,057
and he has chosen these streets
to launch a campaign,

994
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:06,001
which will cleanse the country
of this pestilence.

995
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,370
Now is the time to act.

996
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,689
Come to the public meeting

997
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,942
and hear him speak about this evil.

998
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:18,572
It is a black tide,
which threatens to engulf our country.

was discovered, concealed in a crate
of bananas from Africa.

Why am I so exciting?

And indecent people

1795
01:39:58,776 --> 01:39:59,844
So what?

1796
01:39:59,944 --> 01:40:02,618
I had to fight like me be mad

1797
01:40:16,001 --> 01:40:18,299
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

1798
01:40:19,088 --> 01:40:21,887
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1799
01:40:23,342 --> 01:40:26,016
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1800
01:40:27,471 --> 01:40:29,894
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1801
01:40:31,642 --> 01:40:34,191
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1802
01:40:35,896 --> 01:40:38,399
I've nothing much to offer

1803
01:40:44,363 --> 01:40:46,832
There's nothing much to take

1804
01:40:52,621 --> 01:40:54,874
I'm an absolute beginner

1805
01:41:01,172 --> 01:41:03,675
But I'm absolutely sane

1806
01:41:09,555 --> 01:41:11,933
As long as we're together

1807
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:20,699
The rest can go to hell

1808
01:41:26,405 --> 01:41:28,533
I absolutely love you

1809
01:41:34,455 --> 01:41:36,958
But we're absolute beginners

1810
01:41:43,255 --> 01:41:46,304
With eyes completely open

1811
01:41:47,426 --> 01:41:49,053
Finders, keepers.

1812
01:41:51,347 --> 01:41:54,959
But nervous all the same

1813
01:41:55,059 --> 01:41:59,547
If our love song

1814
01:41:59,647 --> 01:42:04,009
Could fly over mountains

1815
01:42:04,109 --> 01:42:08,305
Could laugh at the ocean

1816
01:42:08,405 --> 01:42:11,726
Just like the films

1817
01:42:11,826 --> 01:42:16,522
There's no reason

1818
01:42:16,622 --> 01:42:20,735
To feel all the hard times

1819
01:42:20,835 --> 01:42:24,989
To lay down the hard lines

1820
01:42:25,089 --> 01:42:29,493
It's absolutely true

1821
01:42:29,593 --> 01:42:32,517
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1822
01:42:33,764 --> 01:42:36,938
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1823
01:42:37,935 --> 01:42:40,859
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1824
01:42:41,897 --> 01:42:44,946
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1825
01:42:47,194 --> 01:42:49,117
I just can't believe it.

1826
01:42:50,489 --> 01:42:52,057
It's the most incredible thing

1827
01:42:52,157 --> 01:42:54,455
that's ever happened to me.

1828
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:56,245
(WHIMPERS)

1829
01:42:57,246 --> 01:42:58,856
It'll ruin his career.

1830
01:42:58,956 --> 01:43:01,334
Nothing much could happen

1831
01:43:07,673 --> 01:43:09,971
Nothing we can't shake

1832
01:43:15,514 --> 01:43:18,108
Well, we're absolute beginners

1833
01:43:24,189 --> 01:43:26,658
With nothing much at stake

1834
01:43:32,656 --> 01:43:35,660
As long as you're still smiling

1835
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:43,584
There's nothing more I need

1836
01:43:49,506 --> 01:43:52,180
I absolutely love you

1837
01:43:57,598 --> 01:44:00,021
But we're absolute beginners

1838
01:44:05,981 --> 01:44:08,404
But if my love is your love

1839
01:44:14,657 --> 01:44:18,018
We're certain to succeed

1840
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:22,898
If our love song

1841
01:44:22,998 --> 01:44:26,944
Could fly over mountains

1842
01:44:27,044 --> 01:44:31,490
Could sail over heartache

1843
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:34,785
Just like the films

1844
01:44:34,885 --> 01:44:38,606
If there's reason

1845
01:44:39,682 --> 01:44:43,752
To feel all the hard times

1846
01:44:43,852 --> 01:44:48,007
To lay down the hard lines

1847
01:44:48,107 --> 01:44:51,327
It's absolutely true

1848
01:46:29,533 --> 01:46:33,597
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1849
01:46:33,697 --> 01:46:37,813
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1850
01:46:37,913 --> 01:46:42,090
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1851
01:46:42,190 --> 01:46:46,200
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1852
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:50,469
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1853
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:53,483
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1854
01:46:54,566 --> 01:46:57,695
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1855
01:46:58,695 --> 01:47:01,744
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

1856
01:47:02,950 --> 01:47:07,950
Ba-ba-ba, ooh

Ba-ba-ba, ooh
