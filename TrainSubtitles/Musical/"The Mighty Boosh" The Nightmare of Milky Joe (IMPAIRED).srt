1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,409
Come with us now
on a journey through time and space...

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,452
...to the world of The Mighty Boosh.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,176
# The Mighty Boosh
# Come with us to the Mighty Boosh

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,778
# The Mighty Boosh
# Come with us to the Mighty Boosh #

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,618
-You ready then, Vince?
-Yeah.

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,777
-That's what you're wearing, is it?
-I thought I'd dress down for the journey.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,889
-Nice.
-Yeah.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,817
Okay, guys, see you later.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,218
-So when you getting back?
-We're not getting back! We're going to America.

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,491
US of A. Stateside.
We got a slot on the Pie Face Showcase.

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,894
This is our big break.

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,214
-I'll give them a week.
-Hmm.

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,570
Once you've played Pie Face,
there's no coming back.

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,772
You go all the way, it's like a launch pad.
All the greats play Pie Face.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,572
-Whitesnake.
-Lee Mack.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,372
-Steve Davis.
-They were all there.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,730
I won't let your room just yet.

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,769
Hey.

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,449
Bollo.

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,775
Take care, my good friend Vince.

21
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,856
Look after yourself.

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,049
Good luck.

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,693
Send me post card.

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,218
Ah, take care, Bollo. I'll never forget you.

25
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,896
We've had some crazy times here, haven't we?
See you.

26
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,498
See you, Harold.

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,576
-Howard.
-Oh, yeah.

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,453
Right. Well, we got a boat to catch
so we'd better get a wriggle on.

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,617
-Are you going by boat?
-That's the only way to arrive in the States.

30
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,415
Old Lady Liberty waving you in
as you sail on in up Pearl Harbor.

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,734
Like the settlers of old.

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,498
-He's scared of flying.
-Shut up.

33
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,576
Okay. Catch you on the flip side.

34
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,415
I got a bad feeling about this.

35
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,810
(SHIP HORN BLOWING)

36
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,057
This is perfect.

37
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,536
It's your fault.
I mean, you're the one who wanted to go by boat.

38
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,458
Who goes by boat anyway? It's not the 1 920s.

39
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,172
It would've been all right, wouldn't it?

40
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,576
But you had to get in with the Captain, yeah?
Go and have a look at the bridge.

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,612
''Can I have a look through the front window?
Can I have a go on the wheel?''

42
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,015
You're just jealous
'cause he didn't ask you up there.

43
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,858
Why did you have to give him a haircut, Vince?

44
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,892
-It was just a trim. What's all the fuss about?
-It was a mullet.

45
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,092
-A mullet is a classic cut.
-On a 68-year-old sailor?

46
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,654
Look, his hair was lank, lifeless, you know.

47
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,499
I mean, it was awful.
It was niggling at me like a loose tooth.

48
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,895
-I had to go at it with my scissors.
-He was asleep.

49
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,772
I thought it'd be a nice little surprise for him.

50
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,209
He wakes up in the morning,
goes for a morning tinkle,

51
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,013
catches sight of himself, ''Whoa! Look at me!''

52
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,495
Oh, it was a surprise. He went mental.
He was like Ahab.

53
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,576
Got his harpoon out, started chasing me around.

54
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,214
Well, it would have grown out.
It was a bit of an overreaction.

55
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,213
I mean, who makes people walk the plank
in this day and age?

56
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,376
Well, who cuts people's hair
in the middle of the night?

57
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,491
I do. They call me The Midnight Barber.

58
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,611
Yeah, well,
that's an infringement of people's liberties.

59
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,571
-Is it?
-Yeah. So don't ever be doing that to me.

60
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,089
-I do do it to you.
-What?

61
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,370
Who do you think cuts your hair, Einstein?

62
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,095
-My hair just doesn't grow very fast.
-What, you think it stays that length naturally?

63
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,176
I'm in there in the night styling away.

64
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,575
How dare you do that to me in the night
when I'm oblivious?

65
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,736
I do my best work when you're oblivious.

66
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,294
I lean you up against the pillow and I go at you.

67
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,059
-That's perverted.
-If I didn't, you'd look like a Stig of the Dump.

68
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,693
You're a sick man, you know that?

69
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,299
It's all about context.

70
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,299
-I told him. I said to him, ''It's about context.''
-I know you did, when we were on the plank.

71
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,253
''Apologise or die.''
(IMITATING VINCE) ''It's all about context.''

72
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,018
But it is about context, you know.

73
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,893
Maybe on that ship he looked like a dickhead
in front of his mates,

74
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,295
but in the trendier parts of Plymouth
or Shoreditch,

75
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,092
he would have gone down like a genius.

76
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,780
Well, whatever. We're on a desert island now.

77
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,050
-Yeah.
-We've got to stop blaming each other.

78
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,250
Okay, we've got to pool our resources.

79
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,890
Tweezers, matches, twine, geological hammer.
What have you got?

80
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,375
-Kings of Leon CD.
-Great, well that's useless, isn't it?

81
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,252
It's not useless, it's a blinding album.

82
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,894
Better than their first one,
and they came up with it really quickly.

83
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,614
Thanks, NME. It's useless to us
on a desert island though, isn't it?

84
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,378
Well, it does double up as a mirror.

85
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,537
Vince, there's more important things
than your reflection to worry about now.

86
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,810
What are we going to do, Howard?
This is a disaster.

87
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,214
Well, don't worry.

88
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,412
You're reckoning without one thing there.
You're with Howard Moon now.

89
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,529
How's that going to help?

90
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,458
Well, there'll be rescue boats
and search parties within the hour.

91
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,458
When Howard Moon disappears,
it's front page news, sir.

92
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,379
-Newspapers.
-Thanks, Bollo.

93
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,899
HOWARD: Day 44.

94
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,574
Time, eroding my sanity.

95
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,492
Wearing me down.

96
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,497
VINCE: Maybe a perm would look good.
I mean a loose one, obviously.

97
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,848
(SHIP HORN BLOWING)

98
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,289
Howard, it's a boat.

99
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,809
-Right, we've got to try and signal it.
-Yeah.

100
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,976
All right, I can create a kite...

101
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,499
-from leaves and twine.
-Yeah.

102
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,770
We might be able to get it high enough
to be seen by the boat.

103
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,889
-Brilliant.
-All right.

104
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,817
-What about this though?
-That's even better.

105
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,453
-Yeah.
-Keep doing that.

106
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,298
I'm going to build a fire.

107
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,456
-Vince!
-Oh, sorry.

108
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,769
Hey, Howard, I wouldn't bother if I was you.

109
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,094
What?

110
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,693
It's just really small.

111
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,175
(SOBBING) No. No!

112
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,895
That was our last chance, Vince.

113
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,614
I'm so hungry. I haven't eaten for three weeks.

114
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,810
There's no food on this island, Howard.

115
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,578
What are we going to do?

116
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,690
-Maybe there is.
-There isn't. We've searched every crevice.

117
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,972
The situation's getting desperate now.
We have to play by a different set of rules.

118
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,011
If you see what I'm saying.

119
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,610
-Are you trying to come on to me?
-We can't both survive, Vince.

120
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,130
It's time.
It's time for you to offer yourself up to me.

121
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,171
You sure you're not trying to come on to me?

122
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,337
Offer yourself up to me now, Vincey.
Like a good boy.

123
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,817
No way! If anyone's offering anyone to anyone,
you should be offering yourself up to me.

124
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,376
I mean, there's no volume to me.
It'd be like eating a Scotch egg or a Twiglet.

125
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,616
If I eat you, it's like a Jacobean banquet.

126
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,334
I'm the writer. I should survive.

127
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,896
I could document it.
I could write about how noble you were,

128
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,853
offering yourself up to me at the last minute
for the good of mankind.

129
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,211
Yeah, but I could eat you
and I could have a go at writing something.

130
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,092
You can't spell.

131
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,778
Offer yourself up to me.

132
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,374
Hey, Howard.

133
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,139
Why don't we eat this guy?
He's made of eggs and sausages.

134
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,173
What? No way. I'm out of here.

135
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,895
-Breakfast Bob's gone now.
-Uh....

136
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,773
It's just me and you, there's no other way.

137
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,697
Get away from me, you brute.

138
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,738
Hey, Howard, check this out.

139
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,091
-Ow!
-Coconuts.

140
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,495
Coconuts.

141
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,735
These things are amazing.
They taste exactly like Bountys.

142
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,018
Who'd have thought of that?

143
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,573
The chocolate's a bit weird, though.

144
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,612
It's like that cheap chocolate you get
in Advent calendars.

145
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,578
What you doing?

146
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,338
Writing the journal,

147
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,371
documenting the experience, Vince.

148
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,728
What for?

149
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,771
Well, so that future generations
will know what happened to us

150
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,813
and perhaps even be
a little bit inspired by my words.

151
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,532
Inspired to do what?

152
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,699
Wander about in a raggedy sort of Hawaiian shirt,
looking like Kris Kristofferson?

153
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,728
Can you keep it down, hmm? I'm on a roll here.

154
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,976
On a roll? You've only done two words.

155
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,137
Yeah, well, I'm carving it into some wood
with tweezers. Hmm?

156
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,457
Having some trouble with the O's.

157
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,050
You're not joking.
It's like the handwriting of a baboon.

158
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,614
You don't seem very concerned about our plight.

159
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,016
It's no plight.
The weather's nice, we've got food now.

160
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,017
It's all good. It's like a little beach holiday.

161
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,132
Oh, dear, dear, dear. You've fallen into the trap.

162
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,216
What, the trap of enjoying your life?

163
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,649
We've conquered the enemy of starvation, yes.

164
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,340
But now there's another enemy
waiting in the wings.

165
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,052
Old Father Time.

166
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,693
You can't escape Time.

167
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,458
He's in the ebbing of the tides,

168
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,218
he's in the waxing of the moon,

169
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,298
the erosion of the sand, he's in your very face.

170
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,298
-He's in your hair.
-He'd better not be in my hair. This took ages.

171
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,297
-There's no escaping him, Vince.
-I tell you now,

172
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,456
if he even goes near my hair, I'll kill him.

173
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,491
You can't kill Time.

174
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,370
Actually, that's quite good, killing Time.

175
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,689
Quite nice.

176
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,812
Time is an incredible subject for an artist,
Vince, you know.

177
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,010
I think it could be a novel.

178
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,539
Perhaps even a musical.

179
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,096
Really? But what are you actually doing?
I mean, what have you done?

180
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,051
-You want to hear it?
-Yeah.

Cast adrift on an ocean of time.

182
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,217
When will I ever see your face?

183
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,171
-Whose face?
-Faces of the women I left behind, Vince.

184
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,528
What women?

185
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,450
The women who inspired me and whom I inspired
and whom I'll never see again.

186
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,895
Quite sad, really.

187
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,729
Only you, Howard, could be on a tropical paradise
and come up with something that bleak.

188
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,851
-What are you doing?
-I'll tell you what I'm doing.

189
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,175
I've made these, pal.

190
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,768
-What are those?
-Bamboo drainpipes.

191
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,539
-For the new wave castaway.
-The new wave castaway?

192
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,888
-Yeah.
-I'm on the wrong island.

193
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,772
I'm thinking of selling them to pandas.

194
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,529
They could go clubbing and if they get hungry,
they'd double up as a snack.

195
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,050
Why are you wasting your time?
Making clothes that no one's ever going to see.

196
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,614
Well, at least I'm not whingeing on
about all the women's faces

197
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,300
I'm never going to see again
'cause I'm stranded on a desert island.

198
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,492
Oh, boo hoo. It's not a drastic change of affairs
for you, is it?

199
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,054
-What do you mean by that?
-Well, they weren't exactly clambering

200
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,138
-to get to you, were they, back at home?
-You've gone too far.

201
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,258
I'm drawing a line in the sand.

202
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,611
You stay that side, I'm staying this side.
That's final.

203
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,298
Fine, I'm going to go and build a hut.

204
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,172
-Oh, we're all building huts.
-Yeah?

205
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,412
What out of?
All the trees are on my side of the island.

206
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,177
-Right, I'm redrawing the line.
-You said it was final.

I think you'll find that's on my side.

209

I'm the moon. I quite like to....
I'm lonely in the moon.

210
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,378
But not lonely so much, but a loner,

211
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,936
a one who likes to do his own things.

212
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,100
I do quite like a bit of company

213
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,293
but I think for the moon
it's good to have your own space.

214
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,212
In space.

215
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,730
I've got my own space in space.

Mmm.

How's it working out your side of the island?

222
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,772
Just fine, thank you.

223
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,496
Anyway, love to stop and chat,
got to go and get a few bits and pieces.

La Nausée is good,

230

but I don't think he really got to grips

231
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,817
with the true existential crisis
in the way that Camus did.

232

Well, you may disagree,

233
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,972
but have you read The Outsider?
Obviously in the original.

-Nothing.
-Who are you talking to?

Without conversation, the mind withers, Vince.

-What about me?
-I'm talking about decent conversation.

238

It's what me and Milky Joe are all about here.

-Yes.

Can I join in?

00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,490
The thing is, Vince, you and I,
we move in different circles now.

Oh, come on, Howard, I'm really bored.

245

What have you got to offer?
What are you bringing to the table, Vince?

248
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,170
Well, right off the bat, I'd say style.

249

-Style.
-I could bring style to the group.

for a while now and I love transformations.

for a start.

That is exactly the kind of rebellious attitude

that we cannot tolerate here
at the Coconut Lodge, Vince.

about earlier and, um,

and we've decided that we would like to

291
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,893
formally invite you and young Ruby
to join the Coconut Lodge.

We'd love you both to come along.

-Old Ruby giving me the eye.

-Giving you the eye?
-Yeah.

I knew you'd come. Get yourself a cocktail, man.

I need to have a word now.

What's happened here?

470
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,816
I don't know. I'll think of something.
I'll say she built a raft and went on holiday.

She's not gonna believe that.
