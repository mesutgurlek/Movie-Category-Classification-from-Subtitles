Here's your c-c-costume, Rachel.

7
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:18,269
Steak a dreg.

8
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:19,670
There's nothing on the hanger.

9
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:21,806
Yes, well, apparently
the emperor wears no clothes.

11

Little trouble
chewing on something?

12
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,250
Love me.
I love you.

13
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:34,952
Why can't you love me back?

14
00:00:34,987 --> 00:00:36,754
Hey, Rache.

15
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:39,924
(very high-pitched):
It's all riding on you, kid.

16
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,393
(distorted, deep): Even though you
have no business being up there,

17
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:43,561
shouldn't you be onstage?

18
00:00:43,595 --> 00:00:44,862
Where's my purse?

19
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:46,797
Or my Finn necklace.
Where's my Finn necklace?

20
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:48,799
Get on with it!

You killed it
in the previews up in Syracuse.

65
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:52,756
- RACHEL: No, you didn't read any of the reviews.
- Yes, I did, I read every

66
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,325
- single one of them.
- No, you only read the legit ones.

67
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:55,626
You did not read the
independent bloggers

68
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,961
or you didn't read
the comments sections.

69
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:58,596
I told you to stay out
of that comments section.

70
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,564
I know, but I couldn't help it,
and now it's like

71
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,566
they're my anxiety avatars.
Like the people in my dream.

72
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:04,001
They're the voices
of all the self-doubt

73
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:05,736
that I've ever had
about myself. And, you know,

74
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,705
why do people become actors
in the first place?

75
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,673
You know? It's because
we want to be loved.

76
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,408
We're like a...
like a bottomless cup

that just constantly needs to be
filled with love and validation.

or blogs

84
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:32,830
or check Twitter. Okay?

85
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:34,698
We are going to
hermetically seal this loft

86

into a big love bubble and fill
it with positive affirmations

87

people who know you

88

that you're going
to be amazing.

Hey, William.

94

How's your day going, huh?

95
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:01,665
Honestly, it's been
a little rough...

Yeah, I don't care.

97
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:04,228
Listen, it's come
to my attention you have

98
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:06,063
an extra plane ticket
to New York City.

99
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:07,464
That's right, yeah.

100
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:09,500
I'm going in for Rachel's
opening. (clears throat)

101
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:11,802
Yeah, uh, Emma and I booked it
months ago, but she's obviously

102
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:14,738
too pregnant to fly right now,
and Coach Beiste said that, uh,

103
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:17,141
Southwest wouldn't let her fly
because she takes up two seats.

104
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:18,509
Well, I'll take the ticket.

105
00:04:18,543 --> 00:04:20,344
I have to see New York.

106
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:21,779
What are you talking about?

107
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,347
You hate New York.

108
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:27,451
Western Ohio, there's a scab
on the face of America.

109
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:29,119
It's an island.

110
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:31,789
It's shaped like a dong
and smells like hot pee.

111
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:34,625
This island is called
New York City,

112
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:37,461
and it's high time
the real America

113
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:40,498
told New York to take a hike.

114
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:45,302
New York is a loud, overcrowded
cesspool of ten million people

115
00:04:45,337 --> 00:04:47,705
and 70 million rats,

116
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:50,808
where the best one can expect
after a Central Park wilding

117
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:53,244
at one of the city's hundreds
of ethnic day parades

118
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:56,013
is a soggy, pork
anus frankfurter

119
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:57,648
that a cockroach walked across.

120
00:04:57,682 --> 00:05:00,651
New York is not just the playpen
of the mega-rich Honey?

Billionaires who

123
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:07,858
it's also the home of Broadway.

124
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:10,995
That great American institution
that bores us to death

125
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:13,764
one night a year with that
bi-curious minstrel show

126
00:05:13,798 --> 00:05:17,268
of self-congratulation:
the Tony Awards.

127
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:21,505
That broadcast lit up the
switchboards with thousands

128
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,142
of angry callers, and the
network brass did their research

129
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:28,179
and they discovered I've
never been to New York City.

130
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:30,047
- What?
- You see, I've been taking my cue from

131
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:32,216
cable news lately,
just lying a lot.

132
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,517
But now I need to actually

133
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:36,787
visit that hellhole
and see how soulless,

134
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:39,056
empty and bullet-ridden
it really is.

135
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,724
- Well...
- Or I'll lose my credibility.

136
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,928
Okay. Fine, the ticket
is yours if you want it.

137
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:46,163
But you have to
pay me back for it.

138
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:47,865
And you have to come with me

139
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:49,233
to the opening night
of Rachel's show.

140
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,801
I mean it, Sue.

141
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:52,469
No excuses.

142
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:54,972
You drive a hard bargain,
Butt Chin.

143
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:56,307
I'll do it.

144
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:58,976
Great. Actually looking forward
to it. (short laugh)

145
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:05,216
New York City. Huh.

146

This place smells like barf.

191
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:16,992
Come on, Sue, follow me.

192
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:23,734
- Tina.
- (laughs) Hi.

193
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:26,390
- TINA: Hello, big fat Broadway star.
- Hey.

194
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:28,759
- Hi.
- About time.

195
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:30,494
These are for you.

196
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:32,162
(mouthing words)

197
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:33,330
Oh, no. Do you
have laryngitis?

198
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:35,232
Oh, no, she's just
resting her voice.

199
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:37,268
Oh, thank God. This
would not be a good time

200
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:39,603
for your tonsils to flare up again.
Remember that?

201
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:41,438
First year of
Glee Club? (laughs)

202
00:08:41,473 --> 00:08:43,207
Hey, where is everyone?

203
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:47,077
Rachel's opening night
on Broadway is a big deal.

204
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:49,380
And where's Artie?
I was hoping to get to see him.

205
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:50,948
Oh, his short film
<i>Bags in the Wind</i>

206
00:08:50,982 --> 00:08:52,216
got accepted
into the Ft. Lauderdale

207
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,484
International
Short Film Festival.

208
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:55,286
Oh, that's too
bad. I mean,

209
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,121
what about Quinn and
Puck and Santana?

210
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:58,835
I mean, are they
just not being supportive?

211
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:00,724
Tina! Why don't you catch us up?

212
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,593
How's Brown University
treating you? Mm.

213
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,595
Ah, I love everything about it.

214
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,431
Except for my dorm room.
My roommate...

215
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:09,867
she's nice... but she's from
Pakistan and she speaks

216
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,981
almost no English
and she's always watching

217
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:13,504
that Al Jazeera channel.

218
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:15,172
And, no, I don't
have a boyfriend,

219
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:16,840
but I was dating
this really nice guy,

220
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,108
but he turned out to be...

221
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:19,076
Gay. Gay. Gay.

222
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,679
- Proud homosexual.
- No.

223
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:23,180
Yes.

224
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:24,415
- Anyway...
- Knew it.

225
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:26,116
Rachel, I read this amazing

226
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:28,018
story about you on
BroadwayWorld.com,

227
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:30,120
and they are predicting
that<i> Funny Girl</i> is gonna be

228
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:31,655
a huge hit. And so
is everybody else,

229
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,490
- except for a few moronic bloggers.
- BLAINE: Oh, hey, Tina.

230
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:36,193
- But, I mean, who are they to call you
pitchy? - Let's go get an iced mocha.

231
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:38,429
And do not get me started on
those anonymous comment trolls.

232
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:39,563
I mean, that...
You are not that short.

233
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:41,277
ALL:
Shut up.

234
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,973
It's fine.
It's fine.

235
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:52,876
Frankly, the only opinions
that I care about are you guys.

236
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:54,345
And I love you guys

237
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:55,579
and you love me.

238
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:57,348
So, you know, if I ever

239
00:09:57,382 --> 00:09:59,617
need any validation, I just...

240
00:09:59,651 --> 00:10:02,620
turn to my buffet of people
right in front of me.

241
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:06,156
If you don't mind,
I am going to take a nap.

242
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:11,028
This diva needs her
beauty rest. So...

243
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:15,466
All right. Tina.
(mouthing)

244
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,167
Get your bags. You're
coming to my place.

245
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:18,842
But I thought
I was staying here.

246
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,239
What if Rachel needs my love and
validation from the buffet? Just go.

247
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:27,411
RACHEL:
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

248
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:29,980
WOMAN: The only thing Berry's
got in common with Streisand

249
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,682
is her ginormous schnoz.
(chuckles)

250
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:34,652
Someone call the bomb squad,
'cause<i> Funny Girl</i>

251
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:36,387
will no doubt be a funless flop.

252
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:39,556
- Do Broadway a favor, Rachel Berry...
- No.

253
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:42,359
- And take your bony, untalented butt back to...
- Nothing.

254
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:44,394
Whatever Hobbit-hole
you crawled out of.

255
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,730
Oh, honey.

256
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:48,532
Sorry.

257
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:57,931
Guys. It's bad.

258
00:10:57,966 --> 00:11:00,567
Rachel has been
cybercutting all night.

259
00:11:00,602 --> 00:11:01,902
She read, like, every
negative comment ever written

260
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:03,216
about her in the span
of an hour.

261
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:05,039
- SAM (quietly): No!
- Yeah.

262
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:06,707
Yeah, she's taken to her bed.

263
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:08,976
She says she's too psyched
to go on tonight,

264
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,944
and her confidence is shot.

265
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:12,513
We have to fill her with love

266
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,515
and validation so
she gets it back.

267
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,983
Otherwise, everything
she's ever worked for

268
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:17,685
her entire life
is gonna be ruined.

269
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,054
Let's do it.

270
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:21,388
Hey, uh, Rache?

271
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:23,090
<i>Namaste,</i> Rachel.

272
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:25,059
Hey, Rachel.

273
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:28,028
(guitar strumming) BLAINE:
These magic hands right here,

274
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,930
they're gonna get you
back to your happy place.

275
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,298
RACHEL:
"Hello, gorgeous.

276
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,401
"Fanny Brice was
my most cherished role.

277
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:37,438
"But I can't stay
in style forever.

278
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:39,974
Now it's your turn. Barbara."

279
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:43,410
(guitar continues strumming)

280
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:45,112
You of all people should know

281
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:47,381
that Barbra dropped the "A"
when she was 18 years old

282
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,576
as an act of rebellion.
Who wrote this?! Tina?!

283
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:53,120
BLAINE:
Or not.

284
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:55,189
Okay.

285
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:58,492
I've never seen her like this.

286
00:11:58,526 --> 00:12:01,495
BLAINE: I know. She's usually
pushing people away to get onstage.

287
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:04,031
It's not fair that anyone
can send a hateful tweet

288
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:05,699
to anyone
and have access to artists.

289
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:07,768
You know, I-I don't think
that it's the criticism

290
00:12:07,802 --> 00:12:10,504
that got to her; I think it's,
like, the volume of it.

291
00:12:10,538 --> 00:12:12,940
- It's Twitter.
- I can't believe my note didn't work.

292
00:12:12,974 --> 00:12:15,009
BLAINE: I know.
It was so good.

293
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:17,011
Hello, losers.

294
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:20,047
Well, you live in the worst neighborhood
in Brooklyn, and there isn't even

295
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:21,415
a lock on your door.

296
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,050
You might want to
look into that.

297
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:25,524
Unless, of course, you think
the rapist is gonna just move on

298
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:27,421
to the next apartment filled
with nubile 19-year-olds

299
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,556
simply because your door
is so damn annoying to open.

300
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:31,725
What are you doing here?

301
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,561
Oh, Asian Number One, that's
totally something you would say.

302
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:36,196
I have come

303
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:38,532
to watch Rachel Berry choke
on her opening night.

304
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:39,800
RACHEL: I heard that!
I'm right in here!

305
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:41,835
Sue, please,
Rachel is freaking out!

306
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,270
Well, she should be;
she's going to choke.

307
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,972
RACHEL:
I can hear you in here!

308
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:46,286
Oh, and to answer your question,

309
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,675
Cheech and Chang,
I'm staying here overnight,

310
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,843
because I realized when
we arrived at the hotel

311
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:51,679
that Will Schuester
is a big old perv

312
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:54,181
and has been trying to sleep
with me this whole time.

313
00:12:55,684 --> 00:12:58,385
I-I thought I asked them
to change it to two twin beds.

314
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,787
- Adultery.
- No.

315
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,622
That's what this is called.

316
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:02,923
Well, you are<i> not</i> staying here.

317
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,458
I can't have you

(applause)

519
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,339
Excuse me, sir.

520
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:22,208
Could you call me a taxicab?

521
00:22:22,242 --> 00:22:24,477
First time in New York?

522
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,279
And what makes you think that?

523
00:22:26,313 --> 00:22:28,347
Well, that is not
how you call a cab.

524
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:30,782
All you have to do is walk out
on the curb and put your hand

525
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:33,753
- in the air.
- Oh, okay. I see. I didn't... I didn't know.

526
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:34,854
Don't feel bad.

527
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:36,822
You know, that was
my first Broadway show.

528
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,592
Yeah. One of my patrons
gave me the tickets.

529
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:41,986
I didn't think it was gonna
make me want to barf so much.

530
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:44,172
I mean, it's called<i> Funny Girl.</i>
I thought

531
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,558
it was gonna be
about a funny girl.

532
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:47,466
- Right?
- Yeah.(chuckles)

533
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:50,569
- It definitely was not funny,
and for a second there...
- No.

534
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:52,705
I wasn't even sure
she was a girl.

535
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:55,107
You said "patron."
Are you a sex worker?

536
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:58,377
(chuckles)
No. I am a restaurateur.

537
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:01,547
Oh. I own a few places
around the city.

538
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,115
Yeah. I'm kind of a big deal.

539
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,483
Wow.

540
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:05,885
You want to grab a bite?

541
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,322
Yeah.

542
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:10,723
Hey!

543
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:12,858
You're doing great
up there. You're giving it

544
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:14,694
- the full Fanny.
- Hey, how you feeling?

545
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,729
I don't know. I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know.

546
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:19,083
I mean, good, good. But do
you guys think that, you know,

547
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:21,200
Sue getting up in the middle
had any sort of effect

548
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,369
on the critics or the audience
or anything like that?

549
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,037
- No.
- No, no, probably not.

550
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,206
No, right?

551
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,678
Bravo.

552
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:34,413
- You were terrific in the first act.
- Oh, good, good, good.

553
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:35,815
- Terrific.
- I made some little changes, but...

554
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:38,417
- No, no. It was wonderful. I promise you...
- Great.

555
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:39,919
- It was wonderful.
- Okay.

556
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:42,655
I'm a little concerned
about that guy in the...

557
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:45,157
the tracksuit leaving
right at the beginning.

558
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:47,493
I mean, he stepped
over the critic of the<i> Times.</i>

559
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:48,527
The guy was spooked.

560
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:50,029
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no, no, no.

561
00:23:50,063 --> 00:23:52,932
Not to worry, not to worry.

562
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:55,601
The important thing now

563
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:57,970
is what you do in act two.

564
00:23:58,005 --> 00:24:01,274
Critics remember
beginnings and endings.

565
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:02,575
So now you have to dig deep.

566
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,277
I know you can do it.

567
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:06,212
All you have to do is share it
with everybody.

568
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:07,847
I can do it.

569
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:10,116
Sorry to tell you,
you're gonna have to.

570
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,784
With all the work
that we've done,

571
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:13,052
all the money that's been

572
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:14,453
put in,

573
00:24:14,488 --> 00:24:16,255
it's all for that one critic
from the<i> Times.</i>

574
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,791
If he doesn't like it...

575
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:20,192
we're kaput.

576
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:24,030
If the review is bad, then
opening night is closing night.

577
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,232
And that...

578
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:28,267
is showbiz.

579
00:24:39,256 --> 00:24:41,873
I mean, seriously,
if I wanted to see a show

580
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,299
about an ugly duckling
who gets dumped,

581
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,800
I'd just watch an episode
of<i> Girls.</i>

582
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:46,269
I hear you.

583
00:24:46,303 --> 00:24:48,037
So welcome to Mario's,
Sue Sylvester,

584
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,039
the gem of Little Italy.

585
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,375
I know it's changed from
when I was growing up.

586
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,744
Now it's pretty much one street
surrounded by Chinatown.

587
00:24:54,778 --> 00:24:56,279
But, still, it's pretty special.

588
00:24:56,313 --> 00:24:58,281
Well, I do like the idea
of naming a restaurant

589
00:24:58,315 --> 00:25:00,483
after one's self.
(chuckles)

590
00:25:00,517 --> 00:25:03,286
Hey, Salvatore.
This is Sue Sylvester.

591
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,620
I'm gonna go whip
up something...

592
00:25:04,655 --> 00:25:06,289
<i>Buonasera,</i> Signorina Sylvester.

593
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:09,625
This is America.
We speak English here.

594
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,761
So,

595
00:25:11,795 --> 00:25:13,562
what can I make for you?

596
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:16,832
How about some gnocchi
alla napolitano?

597
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:19,201
Or, uh, linguine al pesto?

598
00:25:19,236 --> 00:25:21,470
I'm not sure.

599
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:24,373
And, to tell you the truth, no
one's ever cooked for me before.

600
00:25:24,408 --> 00:25:26,309
What? You got to be kidding.

601
00:25:26,343 --> 00:25:29,011
No. It's true. My parents
were famous Nazi hunters,

602
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:30,479
so they weren't around a lot.

603
00:25:30,514 --> 00:25:33,382
Also, I've been threatened
with poisonings several times,

604
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:35,251
so I don't even order takeout
without my food taster,

605
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:36,686
and Becky's back in Ohio.

606
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,289
(sizzling)
All right, I got to ask.

607
00:25:40,324 --> 00:25:42,692
Married?

608
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:45,361
I'm divorced, actually.

609
00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:47,163
Um, I was briefly married
to myself,

610
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:48,631
uh, but it didn't work out.

611
00:25:48,665 --> 00:25:51,834
We both realized in the
end that we'd grown apart.

612
00:25:51,868 --> 00:25:53,703
Huh.

613
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:57,006
You?

614
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:00,810
No, I'm, uh, married to my city.

615
00:26:00,844 --> 00:26:03,012
This town is my mistress.

616
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:04,981
She's my type of gal.

617
00:26:06,016 --> 00:26:07,650
Cruel, delicious

618
00:26:07,684 --> 00:26:09,852
and 100 stories tall.

619
00:26:14,024 --> 00:26:15,992
- There you go.
- Oh.

620
00:26:16,026 --> 00:26:18,661
- <i>Buon appetito.</i>
- Mmm.

621
00:26:18,695 --> 00:26:20,062
(inhales deeply)

622
00:26:20,097 --> 00:26:21,197
(sighs)

623
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:22,865
I have to say,

624
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:25,067
when I decided
to come to New York,

625
00:26:25,102 --> 00:26:28,004
I did not think this
was going to happen.

626
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:29,338
(both chuckle)

627
00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:30,940
(speaks Italian) Oh.

628
00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:33,943
Oh. I knew that<i> Funny Girl</i>
would be a disaster.

629
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:36,812
I've seen Rachel Berry butcher
literally dozens of show tunes

630
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:39,348
with many an ugly cry, but...

631
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:44,086
I did not predict that I would
meet somebody like you.

632
00:26:44,121 --> 00:26:45,354
Me, neither.

633
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:47,957
Although there aren't
a lot of women like you.

634

Oh, my God. Oh,

667
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,705
- I am gonna have a big glass of that.
- Yay.

668
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,374
- Oh, my God, Rachel. You were so great.
- Thank you.

I had to blow my nose on Sam's sleeve.

This is suede.

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,514
I'm sorry. You guys,

673
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:52,869
I love you so much.
I seriously...

674
00:29:52,883 --> 00:29:54,383
I couldn't have done this
without all of you.

675
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,138
KURT: And you got flowers
from Quinn I know.

And Artie and Mike Chang
and Puck and Principal Figgins.

Whoa...
(whooping)

680
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,329
Tonight,

681
00:30:06,363 --> 00:30:08,197
you are a star.

682
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:10,733
(cheering)
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

683
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,002
You know what, you guys,
let's save all the praises

684
00:30:13,036 --> 00:30:15,071
- until after the<i> New York Times
</i> review comes out. - Yeah, yeah.

685
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,472
- You're right, you're right.
- Yeah.

686
00:30:16,506 --> 00:30:18,140
We have, uh, six hours
of innocence left.

687
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:21,310
- Whew. - And then when the reviews
hit the stand, we'll find out

688
00:30:21,345 --> 00:30:25,114
if we're the best thing
since sliced bread or toast.

689
00:30:25,148 --> 00:30:26,115
But...

690
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:27,583
we are going

691
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,151
- to celebrate tonight.
- Okay.

692
00:30:29,186 --> 00:30:32,021
We are going to have
an opening night party,

693
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:34,490
Elio's restaurant,
Italian restaurant.

always, always
brings me good luck.

696
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,998
- Yeah! Yay.
- Rachel, Rachel,

697
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:44,533
- your friends, huh?
- Yeah.

698
00:30:44,568 --> 00:30:46,602
- Bring everybody!
- (cheering)

699
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,271
All right, bye.

700
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,472
Whoa. Eggplant parmigiana?
Thank you.

701
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:51,874
I can't believe it,
a real Broadway cast party.

702
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:54,710
I don't really feel
like going to the party.

703
00:30:54,745 --> 00:30:56,279
I think that they're just gonna

704
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,613
only be talking about the play,

705
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,115
and... I don't know...
I'd rather just...

706
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,449
celebrate with you guys.

707
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:01,550
BLAINE:
I know just the place

708
00:31:01,585 --> 00:31:02,551
down in Greenwich Village.

709
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:03,452
Trust me, Rachel,

710
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,887
they're gonna love you there.

Here?!

715
00:31:18,969 --> 00:31:21,270
Oh, my God, you recognize me?

716
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:24,207
(music stops) We've been
tracking <i> Funny Girl</i> for weeks.

717
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:25,074
How was tonight?

718
00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:26,209
She was incredible.

719
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:27,610
Oh, well, then
this is historic.

720
00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:30,046
You have to sing something...
it's Broadway tradition.

721
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,248
- Oh, no. I'm... I'm not sure.
- Whatever the review

722
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:34,717
says tomorrow, let's just love
and celebrate you tonight,

723
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:35,952
right now.

724
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:38,087
Well, in that case...

725
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:40,041
- I'm here for the night!

I haven't danced that hard
since Nationals two years ago.

769
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:04,100
I got the DJ's number.

770
00:34:04,134 --> 00:34:06,302
Oh. Tina, I told you,
he's totally gay.

771
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,537
- Come on.
- Gay?

772
00:34:07,571 --> 00:34:09,472
- TINA: No!
- BLAINE: What are you, blind? Tina!

773
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,907
Uh, I'm gonna make

774
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:13,376
some coffee, you guys. The
reviews come out in 30 minutes,

775
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,045
and I want us all to go down
to the newsstand together.

776
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,781
Uh, I'll take mine black,
thanks.

777
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:20,383
(sighs)

778
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,320
Who are all you people?

779
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,222
Oh, my God.

780
00:34:26,256 --> 00:34:27,523
You are the guy... the guy

781
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:29,225
that walked out
of my show last night.

782
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:30,620
What are you doing
in my apartment?

783
00:34:30,627 --> 00:34:31,661
In my robe?

784
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:32,862
Well, aren't you all

785
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:35,031
so very, very rude.

786
00:34:35,065 --> 00:34:38,301
Oh, my God,
Sue had sex in your bed.

787
00:34:39,236 --> 00:34:40,636
(sniffles)

788
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:42,939
Actually, we did it
all over your apartment.

789
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:45,842
And if I were you, I'd put
something down on that couch

790
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:46,809
before I sat on it.

791
00:34:46,844 --> 00:34:47,677
Oh, no, no.

792
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:48,811
No, no, no, no.

793
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:50,112
So, how'd the rest

794
00:34:50,147 --> 00:34:51,514
of the show go, huh?

795
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,082
I considered coming back
for act two

796
00:34:53,116 --> 00:34:54,584
just so I could walk out again.

797
00:34:54,618 --> 00:34:56,686
Okay, you know what? I am not...

798
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,341
It's okay. I got this.

799
00:35:00,376 --> 00:35:04,345
You made my life in high school
a living hell.

800
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,513
Well, thank you.

801
00:35:05,548 --> 00:35:06,748
And it's like you had a mission

802
00:35:06,749 --> 00:35:08,450
to keep us underwater,

803
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:10,785
never coming up,
even for a breath

804
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,621
of air, and you said
that it was to push us,

805
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:15,857
but I really don't think
that's what you wanted,

806
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:18,026
because if we actually felt

807
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,729
how wonderful and amazing
and loved we really were,

808
00:35:21,764 --> 00:35:23,965
then we would know
what you knew all along,

809
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:27,335
which is that you are
a rotten and awful person

810
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:29,704
who only finds joy
in people's misery.

811
00:35:29,738 --> 00:35:31,072
Well, let me
tell you something.

812
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:32,474
Something amazing
happened tonight.

813
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:34,109
A group of friends
rallied together

814
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:35,577
and made a dream come true.

815
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:39,047
And never, ever in your empty,
sad life will you feel

816
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:41,182
the kind of love
that I felt tonight.

817
00:35:41,217 --> 00:35:42,283
And I would feel

818
00:35:42,318 --> 00:35:44,252
so sad for you, but I don't,

819
00:35:44,286 --> 00:35:46,921
because I just want you to get
the hell out of my apartment,

820
00:35:46,956 --> 00:35:48,876
because I want to be
with my friends.

821
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,228
Wow.

822
00:35:53,262 --> 00:35:55,630
Oh, Mario, I'm sorry
you had to see that.

823
00:35:55,664 --> 00:35:57,398
Let's go.

824
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:02,537
I suddenly don't feel
very welcome here anymore.

825
00:36:05,975 --> 00:36:07,942
(sighs)

826
00:36:07,977 --> 00:36:10,879
Well, it was, uh, super
meeting all of you.

827
00:36:11,847 --> 00:36:13,281
Hey, where'd you get this robe?

828
00:36:13,315 --> 00:36:16,518
- Just keep it.
- Thanks, bro.

829
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:22,333
MERCEDES:
Ah, Rachel.

830
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:23,658
Bravo.

831
00:36:23,692 --> 00:36:26,361
BLAINE:
Rachel. Rachel!

832
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:27,996
- Rachel! Rachel!
- Yeah.

833
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,098
Poetry... couldn't

834
00:36:30,132 --> 00:36:33,733
have said it better myself.
(applause, whooping)

835
00:36:35,622 --> 00:36:38,223
(sirens blaring)

836
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:40,326
Sir, do you have
the<i> New York Times?</i>

837
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,728
- It's the paper of record.
- How old are you?

838
00:36:42,762 --> 00:36:45,764
They're gonna e-mail you the<i> New</i>
<i>York Times</i> in three minutes.

839
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:48,067
- What the heck?
- Just give us the paper.

840
00:36:48,101 --> 00:36:50,235
Oh, my God.

841
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,304
SANTANA:
Open it.

842
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:53,739
Come on.

843
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:55,074
Open it!

844
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:56,375
Open... I'm cold!

845
00:36:56,409 --> 00:36:57,543
Can you open it?

846
00:36:57,577 --> 00:36:58,911
Rachel, let's go,
let's read it.

847
00:36:58,945 --> 00:37:00,585
No, I can't, I can't.
I can't do it, Kurt.

848
00:37:00,613 --> 00:37:01,981
- You're gonna have to read it.
- No way!

849
00:37:02,015 --> 00:37:03,515
- I'm too nervous. - You know what?
Give me this.

850
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,584
I don't mind being
the bearer of bad news.

851
00:37:05,618 --> 00:37:08,120
- All right.
- SANTANA: Okay.

852
00:37:08,154 --> 00:37:09,521
"One might ask themselves, why?

853

Who's call...?

Oh, it's Mr. Shue!
Oh, hey.

896
00:38:26,366 --> 00:38:28,667
Oh, wait. Mr. Shue,
I'm putting you on speaker!

897
00:38:28,702 --> 00:38:32,338
I made it back just in time
for the last few pushes.

898
00:38:32,372 --> 00:38:35,474
Emma's doing fine,
and so is the baby.

899

- Okay, okay, okay.
- Yay!

900
00:38:36,676 --> 00:38:38,410
Shut up and just tell us
what we need to know.

901
00:38:38,445 --> 00:38:39,578
Boy or girl?

902
00:38:39,613 --> 00:38:40,746
It's a boy.

903
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,214
(cheering
and overlapping chatter)

904
00:38:42,248 --> 00:38:43,716
It's a boy.

905
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,517
Yeah, we're naming him Daniel.

906
00:38:45,552 --> 00:38:47,119
Daniel Finn Schuester.

907
00:38:47,153 --> 00:38:48,320
Aw.

908
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,225
Hey, hey, how was...
how was the show?

909
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:55,694
It was amazing.
How do you feel?

910
00:38:55,729 --> 00:38:57,896
(laughing)

911
00:38:57,931 --> 00:39:01,367
Oh, for the first time
in my life, I feel...

912
00:39:01,401 --> 00:39:03,369
completely happy.

913
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:07,206
How about you?

914
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,208
Same. I feel the exact same.

915
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:10,809
So, I got to run.

916
00:39:10,844 --> 00:39:11,977
Okay, well, we love you.

917
00:39:12,012 --> 00:39:13,212
(overlapping chatter) ALL: Bye.

918
00:39:13,246 --> 00:39:14,813
Bye. Love you,
Mr. Shue.

919

(siren blaring)

920
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,585
So... what now?

921
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,587
Well, it's morning.

922
00:39:21,621 --> 00:39:23,822
I have an early
flight to catch.

923
00:39:25,925 --> 00:39:29,395
Hey, I, uh... I don't
suppose I could convince you

924
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:32,264
to stay in New York
a little longer.

925
00:39:32,299 --> 00:39:34,300
Um...

926
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:37,036
No. I have a school
to run and a daughter

927
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,505
that needs me, whose
father is Michael Bolton.

928
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:41,674
Wait. What?

929
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:44,610
Last night was
truly magical. I...

930
00:39:44,644 --> 00:39:47,212
Oh, turns out I love New York,

931
00:39:47,247 --> 00:39:50,082
and you are the reason why.

932
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:53,052
But, Mario,
I'm a Lima gal at heart.

933
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:55,688
I, uh... I love
living in a place

934
00:39:55,722 --> 00:39:58,891
where "Hang On, Sloopy"
is the official state song.

935
00:39:58,925 --> 00:40:01,994
Where the Y Bridge in Zanesville
spans the confluence

936
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:04,630
of the Muskingum and
Licking Rivers, making it

937
00:40:04,664 --> 00:40:06,699
the only bridge in the world
that you can cross

938
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:08,901
and still be
on the same side of the river.

939
00:40:08,935 --> 00:40:10,536
I love living in a place

940
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,871
that is home
to the world's largest basket,

941
00:40:12,906 --> 00:40:16,208
located in Basket Village, USA.

942
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:18,877
I guess what I'm saying, Mario,

943
00:40:18,912 --> 00:40:22,348
is, um, Sue Sylvester's
a big fish

944
00:40:22,382 --> 00:40:26,252
who really kind of likes
swimming in a little pond.

945
00:40:26,286 --> 00:40:28,487
I don't suppose

946
00:40:28,521 --> 00:40:31,690
I could convince<i> you</i>
to, uh, pull up stakes and...

947
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:33,092
(sighs)

948
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:36,895
Uh, you know, I'm
a New Yorker, Sue.

949
00:40:38,765 --> 00:40:42,234
So, uh, I guess that's it, huh?

950
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:44,603
I guess so.

951
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:48,908
It sure was nice getting
to know you, Sue Sylvester.

952
00:41:00,086 --> 00:41:02,087
(sighs)

953
00:41:04,424 --> 00:41:05,591
(whistles)

954
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:07,326
(sighs) Yeah.

955
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,562
So long, Sue.

956
00:41:10,597 --> 00:41:13,198
(sighing):
Ah.

957
00:41:13,233 --> 00:41:14,433
Where to, lady?

958
00:41:14,467 --> 00:41:17,069
Huh? I take.

959
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:19,004
Ah, ah, ah.
I...

960
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:21,040
Cra... crazy!

961
00:41:22,812 --> 00:41:24,052
Drive the car.

962
00:41:24,077 --> 00:41:25,210
Crazy lady.

963
00:41:25,245 --> 00:41:27,246
I got it. I got it.

964
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:31,116
(sighs)

965
00:41:33,853 --> 00:41:36,255
(sighs)

966
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:38,991
Thanks for making
me feel like a girl.

967
00:41:40,594 --> 00:41:42,161
She wasn't right...

968
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:44,296
the short girl from the play.

969
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:46,298
You are lovable, Sue.

970
00:41:51,338 --> 00:41:53,339
Let's get out of here.

971
00:41:59,512 --> 00:42:02,147
Recently, I've gotten
in a lot of hot water

972
00:42:02,182 --> 00:42:05,251
for some comments
I made on this broadcast.

973
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:07,853
Last week, I called
New York City an overpriced,

974
00:42:07,888 --> 00:42:10,556
rat-infested hellhole that
smells like an adult diaper.

975
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,691
Well, let me be clear.

976
00:42:12,726 --> 00:42:14,994
I stand by my comments.

977
00:42:15,028 --> 00:42:18,697
Every word I said...
absolutely true.

978
00:42:18,732 --> 00:42:21,133
Except for one thing.

979
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:23,669
I don't hate New York.

980
00:42:23,703 --> 00:42:26,872
I love... New York.

981
00:42:26,907 --> 00:42:30,442
There's nowhere on
earth quite like it.

982
00:42:30,477 --> 00:42:34,613
There's no place so alive with
endless worlds of possibility.

983
00:42:34,648 --> 00:42:36,081
Every time you step outside,

984
00:42:36,116 --> 00:42:37,816
you find yourself
on an adventure

985
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:39,184
you never could have predicted.

986
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:41,987
Sure, you might get hit by a bus
or stop for pierogies

987
00:42:42,022 --> 00:42:44,623
and end up being human
trafficked by the Russian Mob,

988
00:42:44,658 --> 00:42:49,128
but if you're anything like this
champion cheerleading coach,

989
00:42:49,162 --> 00:42:52,865
you just might also find love.

990
00:42:54,134 --> 00:42:56,235
Or, at the very least,

991
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:59,038
a night of sturdy,
spirited lovemaking

992
00:42:59,072 --> 00:43:01,640
with a relative stranger
in every corner of the apartment

993
00:43:01,675 --> 00:43:03,209
of several
of your former students.

994
00:43:03,243 --> 00:43:04,610
(clicks her tongue)

995
00:43:04,644 --> 00:43:09,027
And that's how
Sue... sees it.

996
00:43:09,058 --> 00:43:12,083
