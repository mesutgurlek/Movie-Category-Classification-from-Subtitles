1
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:50,896
What about me, my lovely wife?
- Stop it! - Yes, my friend.

2
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,401
I still don't understand
why you're going to London

3
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:57,673
Why would the scion of one of the
richest families of Shimla...?

4
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,005
He isn't going after the money.
- Then...?

5
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:06,413
Man! Have you seen British babes?
- Forget babes

6
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:10,518
Not money, this is about dotcom

7
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:15,092
Someday, computer technology will
turn into a huge industry

8
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:20,756
And my ideas can best be put to use
out there. Why else would I leave home?

9
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,763
Will you forget us once you're there?
- How can you say that Mr Khanna?

10
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,070
Can we ever forget this friendship?

11
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,601
Did you hear that Tina? If our parents'
friendship isn't going to end...

12
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:37,271
how will our friendship end?
- Our friendship will never end Raj!

13
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,217
Tina, you will write to me, won't you?
- Yeah... yeah, I'll write...

14
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:46,284
I'll email you regularly.
- But I don't have a computer...

15
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,722
Of course!
You don't even have a computer!

16
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,625
But I have...
- Excellent!

17
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,599
I'll email you on Pooja's computer

18
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,561
Pooja, you always help me out,
you're such a good friend

19
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,098
Come on son, its time
for the train to leave...

20
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,279
Dear Tina,
London is such a huge city

21
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,690
Such tall buildings and Big Ben is so
much bigger than the Shimla clock tower

22
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:56,627
We live in Hampstead. We're the only
lndian family over here

23
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,521
Everyone else is British

24
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:03,128
The best part about schools here is,
you don't have to wear uniforms...

25
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:08,364
everything's straight out of an
Archie comic... London is...

26
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,377
Such a big and beautiful city!

27
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,737
But I miss home. India. And you!

28
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,881
I'm waiting to hear from you.
Do write. Love, Raj

29
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,817
Raj has really turned into
a big bore!

30
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:30,626
God! Do I have to sit
and email him now? No way...

31
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,698
Tina! You promised him you'd write!
- Sure...I must have...

32
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,066
You're always making Raj so miserable
- So now I should sit and email him?

33
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,301
If you're so keen,
why don't you write?

34
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:59,923
Dear Raj, London sounds so exciting.
Shimla is all the same

35
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,093
I remembered you at lunch today.
I ate your favourite "gobi parathas"

36
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:10,492
Do you get "gobi parathas" in London?
Bye for now. Got to do homework

37
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:31,755
Dear Tina, I'm so happy you replied.
Now we'll always be friends

38
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,420
Yes I do get "gobi parathas" here

39
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:38,092
Our ltalian chef makes them
under mummy's supervision

40
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,363
But they don't taste like lndia

41
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,725
Guess what... I stood first in class

42
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:47,004
I didn't know you're
as sharp as Pooja in studies

43
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,033
You know, I've been selected
for the class cricket team

44
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,402
Someday even I might become
a big cricketer

45
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:59,708
I've a new friend, Ronnie Mendonca.
I go to church every Sunday with Ronnie

46
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,655
Something strange happened
when I went to church today

47
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:08,225
Suddenly I started humming a tune.
I'm e-mailing you the tune

48
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:27,976
Your tune is as much of a habit with me
as you are. Whenever I'm in church.

49
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,914
I hum your tune.
- For me, you're like a habit

50
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,916
Unless I've written to you
all about everything...

51
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:40,684
I can't even go to sleep.
- Then start reading

52
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,851
Love Story

53
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,964
You know something, I only have
a 15-year old photo of you and Pooja

54
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,464
I've asked you so many times,
at least send me a photo

55
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,031
Well...considering what you say
... that you know me so well...

56
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,405
I want to see if you even recognise me
when we're face to face

57
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:02,804
Oh come on, who needs a picture!
I'll recognise you the instant I see you

58
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,982
Your image is in my heart.
- Liar

59
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:11,187
We'll soon know who the liar is.
I have some good news, I'm coming home

60
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,388
I'm coming back to lndia.
I'm going to see you once again

61
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,795
After so many years... in a way
I'll be seeing you for the first time

62
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,763
You must be so beautiful!
I'm sure...

63
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:28,899
you're still the prettiest...
still the most beautiful

64
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:35,608
That's not me Raj,
that's someone else...someone else...

65
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:46,582
y

66
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,911
He's coming back!
- Who?

67
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,111
Raj!
- Who's Raj?

68
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,986
What have you done Pooja? Why did you
write all those letters in my name?

69
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:54,490
Ok so I was stupid! But now you have
to help me. He's here just for 2 weeks

70
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,653
Just for 2 weeks you have to pretend
you wrote those letters...that's all

71
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:02,061
Its as simple as that!
- I can't do something so stupid!

72
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,926
Tina, after all I've done for you?
Ever since we were kids...

73
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,730
I've always done your homework.
Because of me, you've passed every year

74
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,374
But you? You can't even do
this much for me?

75
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,846
Ok, ok stop trying to get my sympathy
like always and just leave it to Tina!

76
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,716
So tell me,
what does this Raj look like?

77
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,950
Six foot tall, blue eyes, and...
- Enough...Iet him come

78
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,993
Let's see what this Raj is all about

79
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:42,364
y

80
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:27,752
The one who comes in my dreams
I wonder how she'll be

81
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:36,751
The one who keeps me awake all night
I wonder how she'll be

82
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:47,663
Hiding in my heart since long
I wonder how she'll be

83
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:56,278
The one who comes in my dreams
I wonder how he'll be

84
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:15,732
Hiding in my heart since long
I wonder how he'll be

85
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:17,190
I've seen him in such different ways
Seems like I know him for days

86
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:27,201
Heavens are deciding the
fates of 2 hearts

87
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,668
Without even seeing him
I'm so restless

88
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:37,279
Oh my God! what will happen to
you if you meet him?

89
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:46,721
Taking my dreams away always
coming in my way how she'll be?

90
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:52,587
In my eyes he has a place
in my heart since days

91
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:53,447
For the first time when I meet
the one, the only of my dreams

92
00:14:55,294 --> 00:15:03,963
Nervous I am I don't know why
seems like hiding the moon in the sky

93
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:13,441
I will not say a word to her,
Just keep staring at her face

94
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:23,077
Oh this restless this eagerness!
I wonder how he'll be

95
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,317
Hoping she is want I have seen
All these years in my dreams

96
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:32,657
I will be meeting her soon
In a day, or two I wonder how she'll be

97
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:42,501
The one who comes in my dreams
I wonder how he'll be

98
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:51,677
The one who keeps me awake all night
I wonder how she'll be

99
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:57,455
I wonder how he'll be

100
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:52,501
That's Raj! Not bad.
So how long does the act last?

101
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,839
2 weeks? Leave it to Tina.
I'll do as much for you

102
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:01,578
How're you son?

103
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,147
Our Raj has become so handsome

104
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,595
Here comes my friend from London!
Play it up for my friend!

105
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:20,400
Eat, drink, make merry!

106
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,939
Come on...
- Give me a hug

107
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,078
Dear sister-in-law...
- What are you upto?

108
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,906
Just taking a chance

109
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,364
You must be Tina, right?

110
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:01,569
I'll recognise you the instant
I see you, your image is in my heart

111
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,921
You're even more beautiful than
I had imagined you to be

112
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:16,925
That I am...but you're not
too bad yourself Mr America

113
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:22,227
America? But... I'm from London
- London, America.... who cares?

114
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,131
And anyway, once I've said it,
I've said it, understand Mr America?

115
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:30,500
Pooja?

116
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,973
Even you're all grown up too.
But I never thought...

117
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,883
Tina would grow up like this!
- And what did you think about me?

118
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:44,351
How do I tell you
what I've thought about you?

119
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:49,084
Those who think, don't do
and those who do, don't think...

120
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,689
Kids! What are you doing here?
Come on, let's hurry home

121
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,734
I'm celebrating your return
with a kirtan at home

122
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,871
Not another prayer session!
- Oh yes. One more

123
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,703
Say hail to the Mother Goddess

124
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:02,095
I had heard that people forget
their culture when they go abroad

125
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:06,532
I may have gone abroad
but my heart was right here

126
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:13,677
Wow, that's culture for you!
Mr America's actually winking!

127
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:30,626
You're amazing... you look beautiful
even in a churidaar

128
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,394
I wish I could say the same for you

129
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,203
Well son, won't you join in the prayer?

130
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:51,981
I wonder how he'll be

131
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,952
It's not that I don't like him...
he's quite good looking...

132
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,050
But these good looking guys have
their noses up in the air...

133
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,622
they have to be brought down to earth.
- No Tina! Raj is not like that!

134
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:08,060
Really? You seem to be quite into Raj?
While writing all those letters...

135
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,428
I hope you haven't fallen
in love with him

136
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:16,096
I'm so stupid! You're not going
to fall in love.

137
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:22,545
You've only time for your books & computer.
And you're a good daughter.

138
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:27,075
You'll marry the person your parents
choose for you, right?

139
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,952
And you? What sort of a marriage
are you going to have?

140
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,550
Me? I'm definitely going to have
a love marriage!

141
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,825
Are you in love with Raj...?
- Tina doesn't fall in love with boys

142
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,527
Boys fall in love with Tina...
- If you're talking about love...

143
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,996
then you must've mentioned my name?
- You wish!

144
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,366
Tina, you remember when we were kids?
We'd bunk school and come skiing here?

145
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:51,871
And Pooja used to bring our homework!
Pooja what have you brought today?

146
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,544
Raj.
- Me? How's that?

147
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:58,574
Hey Mr America... bet? I'll win today
just like I used to when we were kids.

148
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:11,391
Lets see who wins...

149
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:17,101
I never accept defeat, Raj.
- But I really enjoy losing

150
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,401
You enjoy losing in a race?
- Who's talking about the race?

151
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,565
What then?
- I'm talking about losing my heart

152
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:30,142
Why are you in such a rush to lose?
- I'm in no rush... I've already lost

153
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,150
I don't shake hands with losers

154
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,954
Let me congratulate the winner

155
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,517
This is how you turn defeat
into a victory!

156
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:30,405
Who won?
- I lost a long time back... now...

157
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:31,308
Now...?

158
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,667
Now? Now its in His hands

159
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,322
For the first time I've looked
at a guy and felt something...

160
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:51,222
but this can't be love.
Love can't happen like this

161
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:59,995
I thought when I fell in love
I'd be on cloud nine

162
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,436
I thought I'd feel shy to look at him.
But this is nothing like that

163
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:11,544
Still I like him. It's easy
to be friendly with anyone...

164
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:17,021
but love is something
I know nothing about.

165
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,513
This is where You come in

166
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,358
I'm sleepy

167
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,846
Oh, I'm sorry, did I disturb you?
- Not at all. Come in

168
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,212
This is the same room isn't it?

169
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,383
This is the same room where
Tina used to write to me from?

170
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,184
This is the same room, this is the
same computer and this is the same me

171
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:56,890
Fifteen years!

172
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,393
It's exactly how I imagined it

173
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:08,629
You're still working?
- I'm applying to some universities.In London.

174
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,465
London? You're coming to London?
And I don't know?

175
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,275
I wanted to surprise you

176
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,410
What will you be studying?
- Art

177
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:20,239
Art? Tina also likes art.
Which university are you applying to?

178
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,784
London University.
- Hey that's my university!

179
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,553
I know.
- Why didn't you ever email me?

180
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,629
If I did would you reply to me
like you replied to Tina?

181
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:35,524
And what's that supposed to mean?
- That's the point. Anyway, forget it

182
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:43,271
You really like Tina don't you?
- You're her friend, I can tell you

183
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,674
You know, without meeting each other,
without having seen each other...

184
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,879
We...
- We know everything about each other

185
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,115
Not just that

186
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,257
Perhaps we started falling in love.
- Without meeting...

187
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,818
Without having seen each other.
- This is such a beautiful bond

188
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:05,691
And what makes it so perfect
is that Tina is so beautiful

189
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,328
Yes, that she is!

190
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,835
Pooja, looks like we're going
to be good friends

191
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,940
You'll be my first girl-friend!
Will you be my friend?

192
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:27,008
y

193
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:53,205
Would you be that special friend?
That special friend till the end

194
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:06,782
whether it's worth
being friends with you

195
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:11,619
Let me tell you
in a day or two...

196
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:01,310
That way we are friends
since days...

197
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:15,084
then why behave
in such different ways

198
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:19,730
You never know when
you fall in love...

199
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,928
That is so true
there is no clue

200
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,767
Who takes that heart
and just goes through

201
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:32,804
So! Would you be
that special friend?

202
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:37,571
Whether it's worth
being friends with you

203
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:42,283
That special friend till the end.
Let me tell you in a day or two

204
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:36,336
You too are a friend of mine,
so help me with your sunshine

205
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:46,116
Go ask your friend the reason why
she is so clue less, she is so shy

206
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:50,443
There is no reason why!
She is so clue less and so shy

207
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:54,852
All I know that she wants to be...
Is a friend, friend till eternity?

208
00:29:55,059 --> 00:30:03,592
So! Would you be that special friend?
That special friend till the end

209
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:08,603
whether it's worth
being friends with you

210
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:12,866
Let me tell you
in a day or two...

211
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,297
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Walking into a girl's bedroom uninvited

212
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:11,527
Aren't you ashamed to sleep with the
door open with young men in the house?

213
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,561
Never expected a shameless young man

214
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:16,736
Well, that's me!
Anyway, what are you doing today?

215
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:17,441
Why?

216
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,709
You have to have lunch with
Tina and me today

217
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:24,112
No Raj, not today. I have to go
to the library and then...

218
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:34,422
This is such a romantic place.

219
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,126
There must be a special reason...
to bring me to such a romantic place?

220
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,964
Yes there is. What?
- I'm hungry!

221
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,071
Tina! Look there!

222
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:56,670
Raj, why are you looking at young boys?
- Didn't you see what he's reading?

223
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,412
Love Story

224
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:04,279
Love stories are so boring aren't they?
- You don't remember "Love Story"?

225
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,990
If you hang on to your old memories,
how will you ever create new ones Raj?

226
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:30,975
What will you have?
- You know what I like

227
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,177
Gobi parathas

228
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:41,348
Raj, I have to go. The youth festival
is coming up and like every year...

229
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:47,520
my dance performance will be the best!
Watch me! Everyone's waiting for me

230
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,598
Thanks you saved us today!

231
00:32:54,072 --> 00:33:00,170
Youth Festival

232
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:10,711
I can't figure out why Tina seems
different in person from her letters

233
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:17,193
Look Raj, you guys are meeting for
the first time. Give her some time

234
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,130
You know Tina.
She's a bit forgetful

235
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:24,629
And then again writing to someone and
meeting face to face is so different

236
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:34,537
When I'm not with her, I imagine what
it will like when we're together...

237
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:40,745
but when we are together,
everything is very different...

238
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,688
Have you heard that song?
You're in that state of mind...

239
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:45,445
Which song?

240
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:49,559
If you don't meet me I worry...

241
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,592
But when you do meet me I feel shy

242
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:56,597
What's wrong with you?

243
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,569
Hey, "paratha"! Who ordered?

244
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,767
You're such a little kid!

245
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:18,222
Dip hot "parathas" into cool yogurt.
- And then straight into your mouth!

246
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,659
It's more fun to have
someone feed you

247
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,565
When do Tina's rehearsals get over?
- By the evening

248
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,471
Did you go for your rehearsals
or to a wholesale market?

249
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:42,408
I got to wear the perfect look.
- And all this shopping just for that?

250
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,476
I couldn't make up my mind...
- So you bought the entire store!

251
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,890
Pooja-Tina, we're home

252
00:34:55,526 --> 00:35:00,657
Tina... don't you have something
to say to me?

253
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,830
What?
- Do I have to tell you...?

254
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:10,966
Not so fast
- Fifteen years is not fast...

255
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,945
Hey Pooja do you think
fifteen years is fast?

256
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,178
Even fifteen years weren't enough...

257
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,351
Why can't girls ever give a simple
answer to a simple question?

258
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,923
That's not how we say good
night in London

259
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:38,932
Hey Mr America, so tell me how
do you say good-night in London?

260
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,365
You can't be so far away...

261
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:46,767
Your eyes can't be open...

262
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,227
Eat. It's Sunday.
You won't put on weight

263
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,066
Back from his jogging.
He needs his cereal

264
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:30,416
Cereal-eater! You're missing "parathas"
- That's one "paratha"- paunch

265
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:34,580
No! That's my wife's love!
- Here's some more. With love

266
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:39,592
There's this really good proposal...
- Have you gone mad?

267
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,898
How can I get married a second time
when you're still alive?

268
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,461
Oh be quiet! Do you have to joke
all day long?

269
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,834
How can there be a proposal for you?
It's for Pooja

270
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:54,741
Nice people, the Vermas from London.
They own 3 restaurants. The boy is nice

271
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,207
What...?
- Really

272
00:36:56,414 --> 00:37:00,475
Hear? Proposals for Pooja from London!
After all, whose daughter is she?

273
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,483
Pooja wait.
- What's it Mamma? I'm in a hurry

274
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:08,125
I have to meet Raj at 9:.30.
- Listen... here's a proposal for you

275
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,619
How many times do I have to say it?
I'm not ready to get married

276
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:11,720
Alright.

277
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:17,199
Hear me out. A proposal from London!
- From London?

278
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:21,832
Yes, they are very close friends.
Rohan Verma is their son

279
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,903
Mamma, I'm not interested. Tell him.
What was the name...? Tell Rohan Verma

280
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,746
Well, she's turned down the proposal
without even seeing the boy!

281
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:34,140
After all whose daughter?
- Eat

282
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,556
Raj, what's going on?

283
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:53,993
How will this look on Tina?

284
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,468
This will look beautiful on anyone

285
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,272
This is no ordinary pendant. Look

286
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,615
You really know how to break hearts!

287
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,981
Not breaking hearts.
I'm reuniting hearts.

288
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:15,459
One half stays with me and
the other with Tina

289
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,094
Isn't it amazing?

290
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:20,961
I wanted to show you before buying

291
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:31,701
Give me one more

292
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,874
One more?
- For you

293
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,002
For me?

294
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,448
When you find someone special,
give him one half

295
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,550
Finding someone special isn't so easy

296
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,064
I thought you wanted to wait a while?

297
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:01,332
You...? What are you doing here?
What if Daddy sees you?

298
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:09,943
What if Daddy doesn't see me?
- You're not as stupid as you look

299
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:15,984
Hey, Miss Universe, you're not
as beautiful as you look

300
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,190
You're much more beautiful than that

301
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:28,888
Look at this... one half of this
heart will be with me

302
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:36,005
And the other half... with you
- Hey Mr America...

303
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:43,538
anyone can steal in here in the middle of
the night and declare their love

304
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,783
I'll believe it when you say it
in front of everyone

305
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,614
Then I will make you wear this pendant
in front of everyone

306
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:59,062
Where do you think you're going?
What if Daddy sees you?

307
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,931
Anyone can steal in here in the middle
of the night through the window

308
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:17,712
y

309
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:24,084
Today's guys I tell you,
such morons! What to do

310
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:44,467
Some ask me, how are you?
Some ask me, how do you do

311
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:51,674
Never! Ever! Has any one said?
Oh! My darling I love you

312
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:05,258
Hey! Today's girl, listen you,
what I have to say you hear that too

313
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:25,643
I won't say how are you!
I won't say how do you do!

314
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:32,517
Right here right now all I'll say is,
Oh! My darling I love you

315
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:46,100
Today's guys I tell you,
such morons! What to do

316
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:27,871
They want to meet up, hiding from all
They want to go out, hiding from all

317
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:38,119
They want to meet up, hiding from all
They want to go out, hiding from all

318
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:45,091
Where am I scared of any one?
I just want you to be the only one

319
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:51,798
How am I supposed to know that?
Hold my hand to prove that

320
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:55,802
Holding your hand
you know what I will do

321
00:43:54,398 --> 00:44:00,860
Then let's cross the seven seas
Together we shall always be

322
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:02,530
Where will you do such a thing!

323
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:11,046
Then let's cross the seven seas
Together we shall always be

324
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:17,887
With you I would never go,
risking life to do so

325
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:24,889
Only if you drown in love,
will you not fear God above

326
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:31,567
If that's the matter I'll tell you
Oh! My darling I love you

327
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:38,405
Oh! My darling I love you

328
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,571
Hey! Today's girls I tell you...

329
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:45,075
Hey! Today's boys I tell you...

330
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:48,577
I won't say how are you

331
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:52,079
I won't say how do you do

332
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:55,755
Right here, right now
I'm going to say it...

333
00:44:55,959 --> 00:45:02,387
Oh! My darling I love you!

334
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:58,480
Like every year, this year too!
The winner is Tina Kapoor

335
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,324
Don't move... I'm coming in

336
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,001
Look ahead. Smile

337
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,808
Excellent! Hold that

338
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,750
Tell me once more that you love me.
- Once more?

339
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,952
Hey Mr America, that was just a song.
Did you really believe it?

340
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,351
Hey Miss Universe... I was declaring
my love for you in the song

341
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,725
Say it... you love me

342
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,205
Pooja where are you... come on

343
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,372
Hey come on Pooja

344
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:58,876
Say it. You love me

345
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:05,513
It's late, good night

346
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,082
I'm going to change

347
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,348
Apart from this trophy, my son seems
to have won another trophy

348
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:42,487
Really, and what's that?

349
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:44,089
Should I say it?

350
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:51,499
Here's my son's real victory.
- Really...?

351
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:53,602
Yes

352
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:00,943
My daughter is naive

353
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:10,151
But we're sensible right?
I like Tina! What do you say lady?

354
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,355
I've been longing for a daughter-in-law
and Tina is like our own daughter

355
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:19,784
I can't believe this! Even after
becoming such a successful man...

356
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,794
you want Tina as your daughter-in-law?

357
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,627
Hey, save these filmi dialogues
for someone else

358
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:30,302
Money doesn't make a successful man.
Can you ever put a value on friendship?

359
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:36,807
Look this is my promise to you.
Tina will marry Raj

360
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:42,885
Wonderful! Wonderful!
We must have a picture

361
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:53,622
What's happening to me?
Nothing ever embarrassed me before

362
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:58,325
I've never felt anything in my heart
for anyone before... but now...

363
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:03,635
whenever Raj...
You know what I'm trying to say

364
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:07,410
But I don't know.
What are you trying to say?

365
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:17,248
I didn't know you pray to Radha Kishen.
I thought I knew everything about you

366
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:23,888
You've hidden quite a lot from me...
- Raj! You shouldn't eavesdrop!

367
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:30,499
But you were talking about me...
- Hey Mr America, what do you think?

368
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,266
I only think about you all the time?

369
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:39,308
Not all the time... maybe only all day?
Only while you're awake?

370
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,880
Why? I could even dream of you
when I'm sleeping?

371
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,679
Looks like that's where we'll meet next.
- Why?

372
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:54,550
I have to go back Tina. Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? So soon?

373
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,624
I did write to you that
I was coming only for two weeks

374
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:07,996
Wrote...? Oh your letters! Raj, can't
you stay back a few more days?

375
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,071
Not possible, we're launching a website
for a British company and then...

376
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,404
Hey what's the matter?
- You're the one that's leaving...

377
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:22,250
and you're asking me what's the matter?
- Hey, I'm going away...

378
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:31,521
but I will return. But I still
haven't heard...

379
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:39,925
what I've been waiting to hear.
Won't you say it once before I leave?

380
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:45,464
Fine... I too won't say it
till you return

381
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,013
Now I'll have to return

382
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:57,781
You got to bring him back. Fast

383
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,793
You're still awake?
- You too are still awake

384
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:10,526
I was saying bye to Tina
- Bye...? Oh yes of course...

385
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,163
Its been two weeks and you have
to launch that website...

386
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:18,563
See, you remember everything! Tina
doesn't even remember I'm leaving

387
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:25,472
Maybe she didn't want to remember.
- She still hasn't told me she loves me

388
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:28,651
Have you told her?
- Do I need to?

389
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:30,884
Not something you say.
It's something to be understood.

390
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:32,917
Then maybe you don't understand...
matters of the heart.

391
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:38,419
How do you do it Pooja?

392
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:43,165
How do you understand me so well?
- What to do? I take you for a friend

393
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,357
I have to live up to it right?
- Right...

394
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:47,836
What's up?

395
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:51,201
Beautiful song! Isn't it?
- One of your favourites right?

396
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,042
This is the problem with
these old cassettes

397
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:05,120
I've fallen in love

398
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:08,914
Then why is my heart
so afraid of love?

399
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,197
My heart says the road ahead
is difficult

400
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:20,392
And the destination is unknown

401
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,540
I've fallen in love

402
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:38,150
I'm in love
yet I am so afraid of love?

403
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:42,048
I'll miss you pal

404
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:48,224
You'll have to come to London for your
art course interview at some point

405
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,299
So why not come along with me?

406
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:55,461
How can I go until I hear from them?
- lt'll be nice if you're there

407
00:52:56,606 --> 00:53:01,475
I won't feel so far away from Tina.
- Oh so that's why you want me there?

408
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:08,145
No Pooja, just joking... you've become
such a good friend in these few days

409
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:13,688
What if I need my friend?
- Close your eyes, think of me...

410
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,686
and I'll be there!
- Promise?

411
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:16,584
I swear

412
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,776
You're lucky that she turned out
the way she did...

413
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:37,113
if she was fat or dark,
you'd be in trouble!

414
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,941
Ronnie, you only go by
physical appearances?

415
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:42,448
Isn't that what you're doing? You're
not looking at the other one at all

416
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:45,382
Who... Pooja?
- Pooja? Who's Pooja?

417
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:50,187
Pooja is our childhood friend
- You really had some childhood

418
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,525
Tina on one side
and Pooja on the other!

419
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,198
So tell me how was she,
this childhood friend?

420
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:04,637
She knows me so well...
she knows what I like to eat...

421
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,139
she loves Hindi songs
just like me

422
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,547
Pooja? I thought
you were talking about Tina

423
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:25,423
Papa, even though I really want to,
I can't express what's in my heart

424
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,831
Some things are better left unsaid

425
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,697
And what if they're not heard
because they're left unsaid?

426
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:37,173
If you say them with a true heart,
they'll always be heard

427
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:42,842
That's a big risk... what if
Mr America turns out to be Mr Stupid?

428
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:48,511
You're really opening up your heart!
You were so shy in front of the others

429
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:52,252
Watch me! The next time I'll say it
in front of everyone...

430
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:22,377
Close your eyes, think of me
and I'll be there

431
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:39,496
Gobi parathas

432
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:57,977
Ronnie, home-made lunch today?
- No. Mummy is away. I'm eating burgers

433
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:13,534
You..? What are you doing here?
- "Gobi parathas"

434
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,939
And I was just thinking about you!
- Didn't I tell you?

435
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,199
When you miss me, just close your eyes
and think of me and I'll be there!

436
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:20,108
So here I am!

437
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:24,442
Gobi parathas

438
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,284
What's with Mummy and Daddy?
They don't seem to want to return

439
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:30,783
Are they planning to settle down
in Shimla again?

440
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:34,623
You know what Papa is like... he keeps
postponing their tickets every week

441
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:37,122
And you? When is your interview?
- Tomorrow

442
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,294
And then?
- Since I've come all the way...

443
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,623
I'm thinking of staying on for a week
I'll go shopping for everyone

444
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:45,631
Shopping later... you're in my town,
I'm going to show you around

445
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:49,570
No work for a week...
I'll show you London City!

446
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:25,261
What a lovely church this is!
- lsn't it? I come here every Sunday

447
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,069
Oh this is the church!

448
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:53,596
What will you be studying?
- "Art

449
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,430
Art? Tina fancies Art too

450
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:57,429
Love stories are so boring

451
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,099
Oh your letters...?

452
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:04,372
Writing to someone and
meeting face to face is so different

453
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:07,769
I thought I knew everything about you.
You've hidden quite a lot from me.

454
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:09,638
Finding someone special
isn't so easy

455
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:11,446
Pooja what have you brought today?
- Raj

456
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:12,615
Me...?

457
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,449
But you never emailed me

458
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:17,449
You don't understand
matters of the heart

459
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,457
Maybe, you don't understand
matters of the heart

460
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,148
Tina doesn't even know this tune

461
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,323
Cricket posters in your room

462
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:02,998
The crucifix on your wall

463
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:07,495
Every Sunday, you go to church

464
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,007
On your bookshelf, "Love Story"

465
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:16,337
Gobi parathas

466
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:19,010
None of these...

467
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,182
Tina knows nothing about these

468
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,025
Tina is not different
from her letters

469
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:36,861
Tina is different from your letters

470
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:39,531
It was you!

471
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:44,202
It was you...?

472
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:56,379
You have to answer me! Why did you
lie to me? Why this deception?

473
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,550
Why did you play this cruel joke on me?
Why did you play with my heart?

474
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:07,893
Why Pooja? Why?

475
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,730
I'll recognise you the instant
I see you... your image is in my heart

476
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:18,733
Isn't that what you wrote?
I was waiting for you Raj

477
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:25,237
But at the station you didn't even
look at me

478
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:28,583
You just walked past me

479
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:36,581
You never thought Tina could be Pooja
because Tina is so beautiful!

480
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:44,092
Didn't we decide Raj that we would
recognise each other's hearts?

481
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,934
But you fell for Tina's beauty...

482
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,805
You immediately tell for her

483
01:01:54,477 --> 01:02:00,279
Raj the truth is that we always want
the one we love to be most exotic

484
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:05,780
But that's not me Raj,
that's not me

485
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:16,630
Tina doesn't admit it but I know she's
in love with you and you know it too

486
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:21,296
This love is not right! This love
was never Tina's to begin with

487
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:24,131
Tina will have to understand...

488
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:29,300
that I've always loved the person who
wrote me the letters...

489
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:39,482
and Tina... wasn't the one.
She's completely different

490
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:47,496
If we turn this lie into the truth,
then we'll suffer for it, Pooja...

491
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:57,667
you, Tina and l. There's only
one truth in this lie Pooja...

492
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:00,509
only one truth...

493
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,179
the truth...

494
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,852
that I love

495
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:18,015
I've always... Ioved only you

496
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:21,363
Only you

497
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:24,024
No Raj

498
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:35,709
Nothing else... nothing else, Pooja.
We had to come together Pooja

499
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:43,207
Your coming for the interview,
humming that tune in this church...

500
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:50,715
all this has happened for a reason

501
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,727
He's the one who decided
we should be together Pooja

502
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,897
He brought us together

503
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,902
And He will make sure
we stay together forever...

504
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:09,408
together forever

505
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:18,914
No Raj, it's too late Raj

506
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:26,925
It's too late, Raj.
Too late

507
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:38,297
y

508
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:44,276
God knows since when
you're in my heart

509
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:49,941
Since I'm there
you've been with me

510
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:55,617
I promise...

511
01:04:56,492 --> 01:05:07,630
you're the only one
in my heart till eternity

512
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:43,835
God knows since when
you're in my heart

513
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:48,336
Since I'm there
you've been with me

514
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:52,670
I promise...

515
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:57,341
you're the only one
in my heart till eternity

516
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:13,091
Life is like a long path

517
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:17,262
Where people just keep walking by

518
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:22,264
Whom are you waiting for then

519
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:26,768
Walk along till the end

520
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:31,102
I've been waiting all this while...

521
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:36,114
since, I've met you in my life

522
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:40,618
God knows since
when you're in my heart

523
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:45,120
Since I'm there
you've been with me

524
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:49,123
I promise...

525
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:53,966
you're the only one
in my heart till eternity

526
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:59,301
For an eternity

527
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:49,184
Love is like a sacrifice

528
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:53,187
Which people always have to bare

529
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:58,030
Let us take this sacrifice

530
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:02,200
To show that we really care

531
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:07,539
I'll do anything for you...

532
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:12,210
to show that I love you too

533
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:16,711
God knows since when
you're in my heart

534
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:21,219
Since I'm there
you've been with me

535
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:25,549
I promise...

536
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:30,722
you're the only one
in my heart till eternity

537
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:16,433
Come, let's go back to Shimla
and tell everyone the truth

538
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:31,125
These bangles have been
in our family for years...

539
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:37,788
every daughter-in-law wears them.
When Ma sees you wearing them...

540
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:39,793
she'll understand everything

541
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:45,132
Now I've given you
all my gold and my diamonds

542
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:49,641
And now... for once...?
- Not now. After the wedding

543
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:53,148
That's the problem with lndian girls!
Everything's after-we're-married

544
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:55,476
If you're in such a rush, why not
find yourself an English girl?

545
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:56,981
After-we're-married
