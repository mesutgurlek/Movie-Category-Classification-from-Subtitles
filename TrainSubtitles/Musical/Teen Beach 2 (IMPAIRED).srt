- Almost.

surfing" thing again, are we?

being one of your better ideas.

First of all,
that buoy had no business being there.

5
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,861
Second of all, no,
we're not going surfing.

6
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,658
At least, not yet.

7
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,493

8

- No.
- No?

in Dolphin's Cove,

10

right by the lifeguard tower,

11
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:45,676
which happens to be the exact spot
we met three months ago to this day.

what's turned out to be

15
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,281
the most bodacious summer of my life.

16
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,721
Even the part when we got trapped
in a 1960s beach movie.

17
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:06,359
Brady, it's beautiful.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,799
I had to do something cool
for our meet-iversary.

19
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,566
It all happened right here.
You were walking on the beach.

20
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,108
I sat there watching
<i>Wet Side Story</i> on my tablet.

21
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:18,668
And I thought, "Who is the surfer dude
with the shiny hair?"

22
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,475
And you said...

23
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,244
"Wanna watch
the awesomest movie ever made?"

24
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:26,081
(CHUCKLES) And I said,
"I don't think awesomest is a real word.

25
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,383
"And even if it was,
that movie's definitely not it."

26
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:31,753
Then I said, "Check it out with me.

27
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,795
"If you don't have a good time,
I'll buy you a mango smoothie.

28
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,423
"Either way, you win."

29
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,932
- And...
- And I do love mangos.

30
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,033
Yeah.

31
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,037
You did all this for me?

32
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,199
I'd swim to China for you.

33
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,144
Or Hawaii.

34
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,807
Or whatever's that way.
I have no idea what's that way.

35
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,045
You ready?

36
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,108

163
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,446
The waves were all like, "Muuma."
And I was like, "Bra!"

164
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,685
I was a one-man stoke machine
all summer long.

165
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,752
- Oh, mondo, dude.
- Beyond mondo, bro. Beyond mondo.

166
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,961
How was your summer? You spend
some quality time carving up the tubes?

167
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,595
I met a girl.

168
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,131
- No way. You trapped a honey?
- Yeah.

169
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,641
- Is she a super-chill surf chick?
- Yeah, well, yeah, she surfs.

170
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,509
- So, she's one of us? Laid back?
- Yeah, she's laid back.

171
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,278
On occasion. When she sleeps.
Probably.

172
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,650
Excellent.

173
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,549
I can't wait to meet
your little beach bunny.

174
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,088
Yeah, I mean, just...
I wouldn't call her that, exactly.

175
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,191
Right on, bro. Right on.

176
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,883
Three-pointer! (LAUGHS)

177
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,724
Oh, oh.

178
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,888
- Let's go.
- (SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

179
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,397
MACK: <i>Welcome back, everyone.</i>

180
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,694
Big Save the Beach Dance
this weekend.

181
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,497
Buy a ticket, save a seal.

182
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,437
Oh, come on. Who doesn't love seals?
Well, sharks, but they don't like anyone.

183
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,734
- Mack!
- (LAUGHS)

184
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,707
- Hey, how was your summer?
- Oh, beyond.

185
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,970
Science camp was epic,
the college tour was fab,

186
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,878
and don't even get me started on
the student government conference.

187
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,848
I'm so glad you came back this year.

188
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,351
I don't know what I would've done
if I'd lost you to that prep school.

189
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,716
Yeah, I'm glad I'm back, too.

190
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,482
- Oh, here.
- Ooh. What's this?

191
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,524
Uh, well, I made a deal with myself.

192
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,582
If I'm staying here, I'm doing
things that are important to me.

193
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,252
So, I started an oceanography club.

194
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,853
Which is super-convenient since
our school is literally on the ocean.

195
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,831
Super cool. Sign me up.
Oh! I have news.

196
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,828
Guess who I hung out with
at the student government conference?

197
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,830
Spencer Watkins.

198
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,009
The literally cutest guy in school.

199
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,304
BRADY: Mack.

200
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,436
- Brady. Hi.
- Hey.

201
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,505
Oh, you're wearing flip-flops to school.

202
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,981
Yeah, totally. They're my fancy ones.

203
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,549
- (CHUCKLES)
- Oh.

204
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,316
This is my bro, Devon.
Devon, this is my girlfriend, Mack.

205
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:52,051
- This is your girlfriend?
- This is your boyfriend?

206
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,224
- You seem surprised.
- Oh, no, bro. It's cool.

207
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:59,990
Book-bag. It looks very full of books.

208
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:04,003
And he doesn't seem
to have a bag, at all.

209
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,302
I do not have a bag.
I do, however, have a pen.

210
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,602
- (LAUGHS)
- How long has that been in there?

211
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:12,904
- (MUFFLED) Want some?
- Why not?

212
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,705
So, I'll see you later?

213
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,274
- Yeah, during break?
- Can't. French study group.

214
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,082
- Uh, lunch?
- Calculus study group.

215
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,277
After school?

216
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,017
Oceanography club
dance subcommittee meeting.

217
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,951
- How's Easter looking for you?
- (CHUCKLES)

218
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,494
- (SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
- Oh, um...

219
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,792
We have marine biology
together, right? Third period?

220
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,627
- So, I'll see you then.
- Sure, yeah. Cool.

221
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,132
- Okay.
- All right.

222
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,560
Mack seems super cool, bro.

223
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,503
Yeah, yeah. She is.

224
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,939
I mean, she went right to class
when the bell rang.

225
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,271
Different.

226
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,833
But, to each their own.

227
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,612
Mmm.

228
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,119
What's up,
my pucker-faced little buddy?

229
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,586
(CLEARS THROAT)

230
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,953
Sorry.

231
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,583
Sorry.

232
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,529
No.

233
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,806
- Hey.
- Hey.

234
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,742
- What you working on?
- (STAMMERS) Nothing.

235
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,005
Okay.

236
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,512
- This is fantastic.
- (BOTTLES CLINKING)

237
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,515
Mack! I got all the good stuff. Score!

238
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,574
I'm gonna go fire up the centrifuge. Oh.

239
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,313
Spencer.

240
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,821
Wow. Hi.

241
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:32,950
You look great.

242
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,460
Really, really great. Super great.
Perfect, even.

243
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,194
- Uh, thanks, Alyssa, I appreciate it.
- (BOTTLES SHATTERING)

244
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,360
(ALYSSA SCREAMING)

245
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,731
So, Mack, uh,
I'm happy that you're in this class.

246
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,399
I heard that you started
an oceanography club.

247
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,636
I'm chairing
the environmental studies society.

248
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,611
Really? I wanted to talk to you guys.

249
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,704
I thought we could work together
on shoreline watershed issues.

250
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,682
Yes. And maybe an emphasis on
habitat restoration and marine pollution.

251
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,811
Oh, I love pollution.
I mean, I don't love pollution.

252
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,320
- But it's an important issue.
- Yeah.

253
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,448
Uh, I'm also the head of a club.

254
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,924
It's the, uh, surf club.

255
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,986
You just hang out and surf.

256
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,261
Spencer, this is Brady. (GIGGLES)

257
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,600
Brady, it's... I've seen you surf.

258
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,640
You're amazing, man.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

259
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,799
- Uh...
- Um...

260
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,372
Right, yeah.

261
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,739
(FORCED LAUGHTER)

262
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,045
- Centrifuge.
- Check.

263
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,313
- Methylene blue dye.
- Check.

264
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,911
- Cultured Petri dish.
- Check.

265
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,152
Begin inoculation.
Let's dilute those solvents. Whoo!

266
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,660
Whoa. Cool.

267
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,600
Here we've got some weird,
tube-y thing.

268
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,467
A squeezy-sponge. Some wet stuff.

269
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,840
And a blue, creepy glove.

270
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,470
- Oh, you think?
- Yeah.

271
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,709
Thanks. I've always loved biology,
and the ocean.

272
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,412
Hey, uh, have you checked out

273
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,078
the new oceanography program
at Oregon Coastal College?

274
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,350
You get to spend half a year
on a ship at sea.

275
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,618
- (GASPS)
- I could introduce you to the rep.

276
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,920
That'd be amazing.

277
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,288
Brady.

278
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,786
<i>Hola.</i>

279
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,829
You okay, my man?

280
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,499
Yeah, yeah, I'm good. Totally.

281
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,903
All right, well, let's do this.

282
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,668
What?

283
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,513
(LAUGHS) I made a volcano!

284
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,607
- Uh, uh...
- That's so sick.

285
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:42,346
Oh, gnarly. Dude, look at this. What?

286
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,054
Oh, my gosh.

287
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,652
Mack! Mack!

288
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,720
- Hey.
- MACK: Hey.

289
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,697
Oh, hey, before I forget.
What do you think of this?

290
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,960
I'm gonna sell them
at the Save the Beach Dance.

291
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,472
- I dig it.
- Good, 'cause I got you, like, eight.

292
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,932
- (CHUCKLES)
- Wow.

293
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,100
I'm gonna need a bigger wrist. Thanks.

294
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,844
Hey, there's a big swell on.
Wanna go surfing?

295
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,243
Uh, that sounds awesome, but I can't.

296
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,483
The dance is this weekend,
and we are totally behind schedule.

297
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,349
Oh, speaking of, I had the coolest idea.

298
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,988
What if the dance was
a '60s <i>Wet Side Story</i> theme party?

299
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,988
You could do it at the beach.
People could dress up in costumes.

300
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,121
You could even project the movie
on a big 1960s-type theater deal.

301
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,165
- That would be really cool.
- Right?

302
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,222
But there's just no time.

303
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,030
And, as much as I love <i>Wet Side Story,</i>

304
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,799
you and I are, like, the only people
under 50 that have ever heard of it.

305
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,033
(CHUCKLES)

306
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,200
Yeah, you're probably right.

307
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,301
Oh, the college fair, later.
You're going with me, right?

308
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,480
Right. Yeah. Uh-huh.

309
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,113
Brady, this is important. It's college.
It's our future.

310
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,786
And there's
this amazing oceanography program

311
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,788
that I have to check out.

312
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,824
Yes, of course. I'll be there.

313
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,925
- In actual shoes?
- Sure. (CHUCKLES)

314
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,123
- Okay.
- Yeah. See you.

315
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,665
Bye.

316
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,798

00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:36,876
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

1108
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:38,012
Oh, yeah.

1109
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,284
"Mysterious Wanderer."

1110
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:41,757
And then, uh, "Thinking Guy."

1111
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,487
(SCREAMS)

1112
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,960
Uh, here. Check this out.

1113
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:46,254
Ooh.

1114
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,490
Thanks.

1115
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:52,563
Oh.

1116
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,662
Hi, medium-sized me. (LAUGHS)

1117
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,340
Still looking good.

1118
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:20,086
Brady, can I talk to you for a second?

1119
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:21,726
Yeah, sure.

1120
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:23,525
Um...

1121
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,263
I've been thinking about things.

1122
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,272
And I don't normally like to think
about things.

1123
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:33,102
(CLEARS THROAT)

1124
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:38,114
You see, I always assumed
Lela would just be there for me.

1125
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:44,111
But that night when she ran
into the water with her necklace,

1126
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:47,420
it gave me
this strange feeling in my stomach.

1127
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,949
It felt like...

1128
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,656
Like when I drink a milkshake too fast.
(CHUCKLES)

1129
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,398
It felt like...

1130
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:59,326
Like things

1131
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:02,795
might not work out.

1132
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,438
(CHUCKLES)

1133
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:07,875
It's called, "Worry."

1134
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:09,606
Yeah, yeah. That.

1135
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:13,616
And, the thing is,
things always work out for me.

1136
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,885
But here, now, I still have that feeling.

1137
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:24,057
- Worry?
- (SOFTLY) Yeah.

1138
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:25,322
Yeah.

1139
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,464
I'm worried that Lela wanted to come
to this strange world

1140
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,329
because I wasn't enough for her.

1141
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:33,061
(FORCED CHUCKLE)

1142
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,499
Yeah.

1143
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,308
I mean...

1144
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:47,349
I guess all you can really do is
be the best dude you can be

1145
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,943
and hope that's enough.

1146
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,612
Is that what you do with Mack?

1147
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:55,687
Um...

1148
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,651
Not recently, no.

1149
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,064
We kind of hit a rough patch.

1150
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,931
I've been working on something
I haven't told her about yet.

1151
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:07,734
What is it?

1152
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:11,871
Come on.

1153
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:16,871
TANNER: Are these surfboards?
BRADY: Yeah.

1154
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,074
They're all surfboards, but prototypes.

1155
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,483
Like this one. It has rotating fins,
so you can surf in any direction.

1156
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:25,181
Or this one. It's one of my favorites.

1157
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:27,121
It's my surfboard suitcase.

1158
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,850
So, you fold up your board,
put it in your bag,

1159
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,952
and it goes up on the carry on,
then when you land,

1160
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,291
you're ready to surf.

1161
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:34,658
That is so cool!

1162
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:35,892
Yeah.

1163
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,497
- Wait. So, you made all this stuff?
- Uh-huh.

1164
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:41,402
I've never made anything.
What's all this stuff?

1165
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:42,905
This one's crazy.

1166
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:46,340
So, you have two water intakes and
that leads to this sealed hydro-turbine

1167
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,708
that also goes to an internal,
lithium-ion battery.

1168
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,512
Then, we have a pneumatic actuator

1169
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:54,949
that's connected to this hatch,
that makes it open whenever I want it to.

1170
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:56,645
Uh...

1171
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:00,817
Everything you just said,
I have no idea what it means.

1172
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:02,483
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1173
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:06,192
Basically, this surfboard
doesn't need any waves.

1174
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,399
Well, that is, if it works.

1175
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:12,130
- That's so cool.
- (CHUCKLES)

1176
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:14,194
Why can't you tell Mack?

1177
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,298
Uh...

1178
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:20,600
Because, I don't think she'll get it.

1179
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:23,545
You know, me spending
so much time on surfboards.

1180
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,479
She's got her whole life mapped out.

1181
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,642
- She wants to go to college.
- College?

1182
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,777
What's it... Where is it...

1183
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,481
What's a... Where's a college?

1184
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:33,756
It's far away.

1185
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,559
And it's full of impressive people,
like her. It's...

1186
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:39,254
It's not a place where a guy like me
could get around by making surfboards.

1187
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,563
I understand, Brady.

1188
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:46,569
Maybe the problem is
that you're not tan enough.

00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,552
I mean, I love it all,

1192

the challenging classes,
the interesting conversations.

1193

there was more than one vanilla.

- Yeah.

1198

Lela, here's the thing.

1199
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,465
Our world isn't really all that great.

1200
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:28,171
Oh, there's finals and taxes
and global warming

1201
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,679
and hangnails and public restrooms.

1202
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,141
You really had it good
back in your world.

1203
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:35,981
You don't have to worry
about your future

1204
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:37,918
or picking the right college.

1205
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,922
You have a boy that loves you.

1206
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:44,687
You have a boy that loves you.

1207
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:47,255
Right?

1208
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,424
And you want more than that, right?

1209
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,933
You want to live life to the fullest.

1210
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,697
I want that, too.

1211
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:03,579
But, Lela, being with the right person
can actually make life more full.

1212
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:07,040
If you have the same passion,
the same drive.

1213
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:10,448
Or, maybe that doesn't help at all.

1214
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,455
You know, maybe
he just has to respect your passion

1215
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:20,258
and not keep secrets from you
and get weird when you're busy.

and if you don't totally dig it,
I'll buy you a mango smoothie.
