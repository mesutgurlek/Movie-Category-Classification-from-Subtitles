1
00:00:00,551 --> 00:00:02,102
<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

2
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,694
<i>Sam and Mercedes are dating</i>
<i>and they're actually living</i>

3
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:05,396
<i>together after Sam tried couch</i>
<i>surfing at Rachel and Kurt's</i>

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,797
<i>and they made him move out.</i>

5
00:00:06,832 --> 00:00:08,599
You've been sitting there
since I left this morning.

6
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,434
<i>Blaine moved out, too,</i>
<i>even though he and Kurt</i>

7
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:11,602
<i>are still together</i>
<i>and still getting married,</i>

8
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,137
<i>but still they decided</i>
<i>it'd be better</i>

9
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:15,139
<i>if they were living apart.</i>
<i>Artie's in New York, too,</i>

10
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:17,133
<i>and he used to date Tina</i>
<i>then Brittany then Kitty,</i>

11
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,409
<i>but now he's single</i>
<i>and on the prowl</i>

12
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:19,744
<i>at film school in Brooklyn.</i>

13
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:22,346
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

14
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:25,333
<i>America is under attack.</i>

15
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:27,034
<i>Who's about to</i>
<i>sneak up to Lady Liberty</i>

16
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,604
<i>and punch her in the face?</i>
<i>Is it the marauding Hun</i>

17
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:31,038
<i>blitzkrieging across Europe?</i>

18
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,074
<i>Is it the Imperial Navy,</i>
<i>who attacked our boys</i>

19
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:34,342
<i>at Pearl Harbor?</i>
<i>No.</i>

20
00:00:34,376 --> 00:00:36,410
<i>America faces a much more</i>

21
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:38,980
<i>insidious threat: STDs!</i>

22
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:40,414
<i> Hey, boys.</i>

23
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:41,849
<i>Did you know there's an</i>
<i>epidemic in this country?</i>

24
00:00:41,884 --> 00:00:44,952
<i>Well, there is. And it could</i>
<i>be hiding in your trousers.</i>

25
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:46,520
<i>Do you know what an STD is?</i>

26
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:49,257
<i>It's a sexually</i>
<i>transmitted disease.</i>

27
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,125
<i>And the numbers</i>
<i>are skyrocketing.</i>

28
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,079
<i>And don't think you're not</i>
<i>in danger just because</i>

29
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,462
<i>you're a handsome idiot,</i>

30
00:00:54,496 --> 00:00:56,364
<i>a debonair homosexual,</i>

31
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:57,899
<i>a hapless invalid,</i>

32
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,734
<i>or a strapping male soprano.</i>

33
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,436
<i>I'll bet you'd like to know</i>
<i>how you can stop this epidemic</i>

34
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:05,072
<i>in its tracks and give</i>
<i>Lady Liberty back her dignity.</i>

35
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,574
<i>Why, get tested, of course.</i>

36
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,076
<i>Just say, "I think I may</i>
<i>have the clap, please."</i>

37
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,912
<i>And you're well on your way</i>

38
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,847
<i>to making this country</i>
<i>shipshape again.</i>

39
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:16,450
Hey, boys. Do you know that an
untreated STD can lead to...

40
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:17,952
- Blindness!
- Sterility!

41
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:19,320
- Insanity?
- Even death.

42
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:21,489
Do you want to end up
in an iron lung?

43
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:22,757
No, sir!

44
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,158
Attaboy, soldier.

45
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:26,093
<i>Feels good, doesn't it, boys?</i>

46
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,461
And how.

47
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:30,164
<i>Remember, get tested for STD.</i>

48
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:32,800
<i>Or America will end up R.I.P.</i>

51
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,445
<i>I love New York.</i>

52
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,947
<i>The culture,</i>

<i>and, oh, the food.</i>

55
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:52,186
Hey. You want
the regular, Blaine?

56
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:53,421
You know it, Aristotle.

57
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:57,334
<i>Lima's idea</i>
<i>of international cuisine</i>

58
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,927
<i>is a Taco Bell and Breadstix.</i>

59
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:01,596
<i>But in NYC,</i>

60
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,798
<i>it's a United Nations</i>
<i>of restaurants.</i>

61
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,867
<i>From Mexican to Mongolian,</i>

62
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:07,368
<i>Hungarian to Honduran,</i>

63
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:09,036
<i>Vietnamese to Viennese.</i>

64
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:11,105
<i>And there's always room</i>

65
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,641
<i>in the tum-tum</i>
<i>for my newest obsession:</i>

66
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,177
<i>cronuts.</i>

67
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:19,881
<i>If a croissant and a donut</i>
<i>made sweet, sweet love,</i>

68
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:21,983
<i>their baby would be a cronut,</i>

69
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,485
<i>a flaky,</i>
<i>yet buoyant sugar-kissed</i>

70
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,053
<i>pastry of perfection.</i>

71
00:02:26,088 --> 00:02:27,955
<i>It's sort of become a habit</i>

72
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,625
<i>that I enjoy a cronut</i>
<i>or two on the way to school.</i>

73
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,193
<i>And maybe on the way back home.</i>

74
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:33,561
<i>Okay, I'm addicted to them.</i>

75
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:35,863
<i>But they go great</i>
<i>with everything,</i>

76
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:38,533
<i>especially the breakfast in bed</i>

<i>Yes, the Big Apple</i>

<i>on savoring every bite.</i>

81
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,347

come on, come on.

83
00:03:07,963 --> 00:03:09,464
Could this be the...

84
00:03:09,498 --> 00:03:12,200
Could it be the Freshman 15?

85
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:17,881
<i>Frank Sinatra said it best.</i>

86
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,074
<i>New York is my kind of town.</i>

87

<i>Actually, I think</i>
<i>he was talking about Chicago,</i>

88
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:23,711
<i>but I'm in New York now,</i>

89
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:25,546
<i>and as Dorothy Gale</i>
<i>always said,</i>

90
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,415
<i>there's no place like home.</i>

91
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:29,417
<i>Except she was talking</i>
<i>about Kansas.</i>

92
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:33,254
<i>Still, New York is just</i>
<i>so different from high school.</i>

93
00:03:33,288 --> 00:03:35,723
<i>At McKinley, no one wanted</i>
<i>anything to do with me</i>

94
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,859
<i>because I was a nerd in</i>
<i>a wheelchair</i>

95
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:39,927
<i>who tucked my sweaters</i>
<i>into my pleated khakis.</i>

96
00:03:39,962 --> 00:03:42,463
<i>But here,</i>
<i>I do exactly the same thing,</i>

97
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:43,965
<i>and everyone thinks it's cool.</i>

98
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:46,134
Hey, Artie. Look.

99
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:47,702
<i>In high school,</i>

100
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:49,570
<i>I had to beg girls</i>
<i>to go out with me.</i>

101
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,205
<i>Here, I'm lady bait.</i>

102
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,408
<i>I'm like the pied piper</i>
<i>of coed trim.</i>

103
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,322
<i>A year ago,</i>
<i>I was dating one girl</i>

104
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:56,465
<i>and considered myself lucky.</i>

105
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:58,546
<i>Now, I'm dating three.</i>

106
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,380
Hi, Artie.

107
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:00,715
Hey, Vanessa.

108
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:04,052
I'm Vanessa,
and I'm so hot for Godard.

109
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:06,247
I made my parents throw
a French New Wave party

110
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:07,588
for my sixth birthday.

111
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:10,591
<i>When I saw Artie's experimental</i>
<i>short film,</i>

112
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,093
Rags the Homeless Clown,

113
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,729
I was like, "Oh, yes,
I will sleep with him."

114
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:16,064
Hey, Jess.

115
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:17,965
Are we on for<i> The Fly</i>
at Film Forum tonight?

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,667
You bet your sweet ass we are.

117
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:21,269
Yeah, I have a thing
for wheelchairs.

118
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,937
<i>Crash</i> is the greatest
film ever made,

119
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,639
and I'm not talking
about that Paul Haggis

120
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:25,907
Oscar-bait train wreck.

121
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:27,421
That film could've used
a train wreck.

122
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:28,776
I'm talking Cronenberg.

123
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,144
Hey, Julie.

124
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:31,245

<i>And then there's Julie.</i>

126

<i>She's the one I've really</i>
<i>got my heart set on.</i>

a film by Artie Abrams,
take one.

130
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:49,364
When a plastic bag gets
caught in the wind,

131
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:51,966
does it feel sadness or hope?

132
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,936
Does the plastic bag know
it is eternal?

133
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,639
<i> She's smart,
funny, super talented,</i>

134
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,107
<i>and everyone likes her.</i>

135
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:00,541
<i>A year ago,</i>
<i>I would have been terrified</i>

<i>to ask out a girl like her,</i>

Great, Julie.

194
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,576
I want to try it again,

195
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,945
but this time
with a little more...

196
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,613
twilight in your voice?

197
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,014
Twilight.

198
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:22,116
That's amazing direction, Artie.

199
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:24,152
Listen, Julie,

200
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:27,088
maybe we could go out sometime?

201
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:28,256
Like on a date?

202
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:31,626
I'd love to, Artie.

203
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,962
It's just... I sort
of have a policy

204
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,764
where I don't date anyone
that I'm working with.

205
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,700
Oh, sure.

206
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:40,368
Great. Take two.

207
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:45,540
Stage combat
is not for the weak of heart.

208
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:47,842
Our bodies are our weapons.

209
00:07:47,877 --> 00:07:50,378
And speaking of weapons,
check out the gun show.

210
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:51,579
I finally hit puberty.

211
00:07:51,614 --> 00:07:52,881
I'm serious.

212
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:54,149
Make a muscle.

213
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:57,685
<i>I've got to hand it to Kurt.</i>

214
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,254
<i>He's looking amazing</i>
<i>these days,</i>

215
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:01,456
<i>and he deserves all</i>
<i>the attention he's getting.</i>

216
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,659
<i>Still, I just can't help</i>
<i>but feel...</i>

217
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,860
<i>What is it?</i>

218
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:08,630
<i>Oh, just cut the crap, Blaine.</i>

219
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:10,331
<i>I'm actually feeling</i>
<i>a little jealous.</i>

220
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,700
<i>Back at McKinley, I'd be</i>
<i>the guy getting fawned over.</i>

221
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:14,235
<i>I lifted; I boxed;</i>

222
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,371
<i>I was in the Dalton Fight Club</i>
<i>for God's sake.</i>

223
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:19,040
<i>And Kurt was, well, Kurt.</i>

224
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:20,575
<i>Most of the time,</i>
<i>he was more comfortable</i>

225
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:21,876
<i>hanging out with the girls.</i>

226
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:23,778
<i>Like when the Glee Club</i>
<i>sang "Summer Nights,"</i>

227
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:25,146
<i>he did the Rizzo part.</i>

228
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:27,015
<i>But the winds have changed.</i>

229
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,117
<i>There's a shift</i>
<i>in the power dynamic.</i>

230
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:30,418
<i>Kurt's the hot shot now.</i>

231
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:32,454
<i>And after what happened to him</i>
<i>a few weeks ago,</i>

232
00:08:32,488 --> 00:08:34,589
<i>a lot of people look at him</i>
<i>as a hero.</i>

233
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:35,890
<i>He's leading man material.</i>

234
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:37,158
<i>I've always known</i>
<i>he could be that,</i>

235
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:38,326
<i>but most people didn't.</i>

236
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,428
<i>I guess I'm just not used</i>
<i>to Kurt</i>

237
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:42,630
<i>being seen as a sexual object.</i>

238
00:08:42,665 --> 00:08:44,732
<i>And to be completely honest,</i>

239
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:46,568
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if I'm comfortable with that.</i>

240
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:47,735
Let's go, Cheese Puff.

241
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,546
Time-out, okay?

242
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:00,048
Time-out.

243
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,317
I need to come up for air.
This sofa's killing my back.

244
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:03,852
Well, actually, you know what,

245
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:05,553
Blaine's not going to be home
for a couple hours,

246
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:08,223
so if you wanted to
go lay down or...

247
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,525
Sam, I think we need
to have a conversation.

248
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,795
Okay.

249
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:16,464
Things never got...

250
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:19,234
too serious for us
back in high school

251
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,535
for a number reasons,

252
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:23,605
but the truth is, things haven't
gotten too serious

253
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,907
for me with anyone.

254
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:29,577
I'm a virgin.

255
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:30,979
Oh.

256
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:33,114
Okay.

257
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:35,750
I'm not.

258
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:36,985
Yeah, I got that.

259
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,720
You know, and that's fine.

260
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:41,756
We just,
we have different pasts,

261
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,093
and different levels
of experience.

262
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,215
I just,
I don't want to do anything

263
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,098
until I know that I should.

264
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,234
Hmm.

265
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,137
Okay, well, uh,

266
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:58,373
we can go as slow or as fast

267
00:09:58,407 --> 00:10:00,375
as you would like to.

268
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:01,476
As long as we're together,

269
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,631
you get to call the shots.

270
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:08,349
You guys, look, you need
to help me find a clinic,

271
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:10,318
preferably free.
Are you sick?

272
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:11,419
Um, I don't think so.

273
00:10:11,454 --> 00:10:12,720
Then what do you
need a clinic for?

274
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:16,057
To make sure that I'm
not, you know,<i> sick.</i>

275
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:17,659
Okay, guys, look, I'm trying
to be a gentleman here,

276
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:19,394
like, you know, Mercedes-wise.

277
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:21,229
Look, and I want to get
an STD test

278
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:23,598
just to make sure I have
a clean bill of health to,

279
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:25,333
you know, ease her mind.

280
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:27,469
Wait, you guys
haven't had sex yet?

281
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,637
What's so shocking?
Okay, we just started dating.

282
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,373
But you sleep in the same room.

283
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:33,875
Well, I mean, I really like her,

284
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:35,910
and I don't want
to mess things up, you know?

285
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:37,612
We're taking it slow.

286
00:10:37,646 --> 00:10:38,747
Well, I, for one,

287
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:40,749
think that's very,
uh, admirable

288
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:42,450
and, uh, postmodern romantic.

289
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:43,752
And if you need a free clinic,

290
00:10:43,786 --> 00:10:44,919
there's one
on 14th Street in Chelsea.

291
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:46,321
Does it hurt?

292
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,389
I mean, do they, like,

293
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,923
stick your thing with anything?

294
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,059
No, it's just, like,

295
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:52,660
a blood and urine sample.
It's just quick and simple.

296
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,129
If you're nervous about it,
I'll go with you. Yeah.

297
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:56,431
Boys' day. That sounds fun.
Yeah, I mean,

298
00:10:56,465 --> 00:10:58,800
you know, we haven't been tested
since the whole Eli C debacle.

299
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,201
I mean, not that we have
anything to worry about,

300
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:01,403
but it would
be the responsible thing to do,

301
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:02,558
for all of us to get tested.

302
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:04,439
Even you, Artie.
What?

303
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:06,041
Oh, I-I didn't order this.

304
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:07,242
Oh, I-I whispered to her.

305
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:08,777
It's my little gift
to you. Trust me,

306
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:11,513
you and your crazy self-denial
dietary regimen will thank me

307
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,782
once you have one sip of
this Frozen Hot Chocolate.

308
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:15,183
All right, uh, one sip,

309
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,778
then I'll thank you,
then I'll jog home.

310
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:17,585
Cheers.

311
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,987
Cheers, cheers.
Cheers.

312
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:20,155
Cheers, cheers.
Oh, my God.

313
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:21,756
Just have the whole thing.

314
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,692
It's really good.

315
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:27,996
Hello?

316
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,532
Artie Abrams?

317
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:33,068
Okay, I'll cut right
to the chase.

318
00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:36,404
You have tested positive
for chlamydia.

319
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:38,406
What? You can't be serious.

320
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:39,874
I haven't had any
of the symptoms.

321
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:41,276
If I had,
I would've come in right away.

322
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,811
Well, the test
came back positive,

323
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:44,646
which means you're asymptomatic,
which is even worse

324
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,648
because it means that you could
be spreading the disease

325
00:11:46,682 --> 00:11:47,782
without knowing it.

326
00:11:57,324 --> 00:11:59,804
That's what I call
a season finale.

327
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:01,930
Sam, I can't keep watching
this show with you.

328
00:12:01,964 --> 00:12:04,532
Oh, come on, Blaine. Season seven of
<i>Arliss</i> is when it gets really good.

329
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:07,007
Guys, I can't stand it anymore.
I have to tell you something.

330
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,937
I have chlamydia.

331
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:10,538
What? What? Oh, my God.

332
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:12,073
Yeah, I know. Yeah,
Are you serious?

333
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:13,675
The doctor called me
and said I tested positive.

334
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:14,642
How is that possible?

335
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:15,644
I don't know how.
Well,

336
00:12:15,678 --> 00:12:17,078
- do you wear condoms?
- No.

337
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:18,146
Well, that would be how.

338
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,881
Artie, are you kidding?!
The one time

339
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,549
I bought some, I got nervous
because they were locked

340
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:23,418
in a cabinet and the pharmacist
asked me which kind I liked

341
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,353
and I panicked so then she gave
me these ones that were all...

342
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:26,888
greasy and they smelled
like banana.

343
00:12:26,922 --> 00:12:28,556
It was like putting
on a-a tiny, greasy,

344
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:29,891
banana-flavored wet suit.

345
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:31,685
No, Artie, okay? That's...
There's no excuse.

346
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:33,361
That is completely
irresponsible!

347
00:12:33,396 --> 00:12:34,896
You have to wear
one every time!

348
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,299
Stop yelling. I'm sure
he feels bad enough.

349
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,769
No, Blaine, this isn't okay.
Artie needs to be slut-shamed.

350
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:43,438
- I'm slut-shaming you, Artie!
- You're lucky you just got chlamydia.

351
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,906
I mean, you could've caught
something that can't be cured.

352
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:45,874
Yeah, you could've
gotten somebody pregnant.

353
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:47,029
Did you think about that?

354
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:48,510
Slut! Slut shame!

355
00:12:48,544 --> 00:12:49,711
Well, I'm sure

356
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:50,779
you're getting treated, right?

357
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,580
Yes. I take antibiotics
for two weeks

358
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:54,082
and then I go for a checkup
to make sure it's cured.

359
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:56,451
You have to tell the girl you slept with.
Which one?

360
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,253
What?
I'm-I'm sorry, "which one"?

361
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:00,255
Yeah, I've been sleeping
with two different girls.

362
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:02,524
Who are you? It's like
I don't even know you!

363
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:03,858
Sam, calm down!

364
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:05,060
Artie, listen to us.

365
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:07,762
You have to tell these girls
that you have chlamydia.

366
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:09,731
If you don't, you're gonna
put their health at risk.

367
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:11,566
And they could be
spreading it to others.

368
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:14,081
It's the right thing to do.
You owe it to them.

369
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,693
You have what?!
I can't believe this.

370
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:20,152
I think I'm going to pass out.

371
00:13:20,187 --> 00:13:22,121
I'm so sorry. Let me explain.

372
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:23,622
What is there to explain?!

373
00:13:23,657 --> 00:13:24,857
You have chlamydia.

374
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:26,258
And now I have to get tested,

375
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:28,360
which means I have to go down
to the campus free clinic,

376
00:13:28,395 --> 00:13:30,763
and sit in that waiting room
with warts on my face.

377
00:13:30,797 --> 00:13:33,165
Oh, my God! Am I going
to get a freaking canker?

378
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,667
My parents are coming to visit.

379
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:37,503
I just hope we can
still be friends.

380
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:40,172
Friends?! No, Artie.
We are not friends.

381
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:42,374
You are Patient Zero,
and I'm telling everyone

382
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:44,977
to stay away from you because
you, Artie, are disgusting!

383
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:46,212
Oh!

384
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:48,380
And, Artie? Your films suck!

385
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:57,556
Jessica?

386
00:13:57,591 --> 00:13:58,824
Can I talk to you in private?

387
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:00,126
Sure.

388
00:14:01,394 --> 00:14:03,496
I'm-I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

389
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,408
I tested positive
for chlamydia.

390
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:07,967
Oh, okay, is that it?

391
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:10,302
I don't know if you heard
what I said. I...

392
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:12,204
You have chlamydia. I heard you.
Don't worry about it.

393
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:13,672
I'll just go to the free clinic
today after class.

394
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:15,541
You're not mad?
I'm not if you're not. I mean,

395
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:17,816
for all we know, I could've
given it to you. Later.

396
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,579
Artie.

397
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:21,814
Can I talk to you for a second?

398
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:23,482
Remember

399
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:25,484
when you asked me out,
and I said no?

400
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,585
Well,

401
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,087
I thought about it
and I'm an idiot.

402
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:29,488
I'd love to go out with you.

403
00:14:29,523 --> 00:14:31,524
Great.
Great.

404
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:33,159
I'm free tomorrow night
if you maybe want

405
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,226
to grab some food or something?

406
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:35,161
Mm-hmm, sure.

407
00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:38,397
Awesome!
Well, I will see you then.

408
00:14:40,398 --> 00:14:42,878
But you like it, don't you?
It's subdued, right?

409
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:45,037
It's, like, I wanted to
go all Russell Westbrook,

410
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:46,705
but then I was like no,
more like 'Melo Anthony,

411
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,740
'cause that's, like, my thing.

412
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:49,375
Stop stressing.

413
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:51,143
Look, I get it... you don't think
I'm gonna fit in here.

414
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:53,145
Uh, blond hair, light skin.

415
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,780
I'm-I'm DQ'd from the start.

416
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:57,716
Let's just offer our thanks
for our blessings.

417
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:59,952
Speaking of, I have an offering.

418
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:03,556
A clean, spotless
bill of health.

419
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,790
What?

420
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:06,025
In order to give you everything,

421
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:07,860
I have to make sure I don't...

422
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:09,228
give you anything.

423
00:15:09,262 --> 00:15:10,930
Okay. Come here.

424
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:14,633
Baby, thank you so much.

425
00:15:14,668 --> 00:15:16,736
Total, total sweetness.

426
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,271
But you are focusing way too
much on what's on the outside.

427
00:15:19,306 --> 00:15:20,773
I mean, the hair, the suit.

428
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:22,875
And the other thing.
Hmm.

429
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:25,077
I guess what
I'm trying to say is

430
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:26,979
I'm still unsure
about going all the way.

431
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:29,415
And I know that I love you,
but I don't know,

432
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:32,084
I just, I want to turn
to God for the answers.

433
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:34,687
I get it. In order to bring
someone into your life

434
00:15:34,721 --> 00:15:36,801
you have to bring
the Holy Spirit in first.

435
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:47,466
And praise
to our brothers and sisters

436
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:49,602
from the Land of the Rising Sun,

437
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:51,937
who came all the way across

438
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:55,474
from God's green Earth
to hear us lift our voices.

439
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:57,610
Not that I'm having a bad time,

440
00:15:57,644 --> 00:16:00,646
uh, or anything,
but when does this end?

441
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,881
Maybe your butt's too bony.

442
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:04,483
Maybe you just need
to grow a church cushion.

443
00:16:04,518 --> 00:16:05,951
That's, that's not even...

444
00:16:07,187 --> 00:16:08,754
We haven't even got
to the good part.

445
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:10,356
And I ask you,

446
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,826
brothers and sisters in Christ,

447
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,296
to let one of our own
speak from her heart.

448
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,300
And lift your voices
to the steeple of this temple!

449
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:23,636
To the melted snowcaps

450
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,638
of Mount Sinai!

451
00:16:25,672 --> 00:16:27,073
Whoa.
To the battered,

452
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:29,875
zero-gravity cubby holes

453
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,878
of the International
Space Station!

454
00:16:32,913 --> 00:16:34,980
I give to you

455
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,283
a gift from God

456
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:40,820
the voice

All right!

493
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,322
I need everyone to pair up.

494
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,723
Half of you are Athenians,

495
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:11,025
the other half Spartans.

496
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:13,627
Athens shirts, Spartan skins.

497
00:19:13,662 --> 00:19:16,063
Guess I'll be the Spartan.

498
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:17,665
Yeah, you will.

499
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,300
<i>In high school I
did everything I could</i>

500
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,402
<i>not to take my shirt off</i>
<i>in front of other people.</i>

501
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:24,038
<i>Like, I don't think I showered</i>
<i>once after gym class.</i>

502
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:26,140
<i>Now, though, thanks to</i>
<i>a little more working out,</i>

503
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:28,309
<i>a little more protein,</i>
<i>my outside self</i>

504
00:19:28,343 --> 00:19:30,044
<i>is catching up</i>
<i>to my inside self.</i>

505
00:19:30,078 --> 00:19:31,579
Okay, begin!

506
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:36,793
<i>And I feel pretty
comfortable in my skin.</i>

507
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:39,153
<i>And that feels good.</i>

508
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:43,366
<i>I have to be mindful</i>
<i>of Blaine though.</i>

509
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,992
<i>New school, new city.</i>

510
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:46,393
<i>It's stressful.</i>

511
00:19:46,428 --> 00:19:47,728
<i>He's being tested.</i>

512
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:50,431
<i>We, as a couple,</i>
<i>are being tested.</i>

513
00:19:50,465 --> 00:19:53,801
<i>I can't let</i>
<i>my new confidence erode his.</i>

514
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:55,803
So, I was thinking, you know,
as great as it is

515
00:19:55,837 --> 00:19:57,171
to have the whole gang
back together again,

516
00:19:57,205 --> 00:19:58,639
why don't you and I
have a date night?

517
00:19:58,673 --> 00:19:59,974
You know, just the two of us.

518
00:20:00,008 --> 00:20:01,008
Maybe dinner and a movie?

519
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:02,282
I would love that.

520
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,677
I'm working on dinner,
so you pick the movie.

521
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:05,713
All I ask is that it's
in color, in English,

522
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,214
and made after 1989.

523
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:10,761
What are you whipping up
in there?

524
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:12,186
Fettuccine in a cream sauce,

525
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,589
potato gratin and a molten
chocolate cake for dessert.

526
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:17,591
We can't eat all that.

527
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:18,793
I mean, it's just
a little heavy.

528
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:20,394
I hope you're not trying
to plump me up.

529
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,730
Since when are you manorexic?

530
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,366
I'm not, I'm just taking
better care of myself.

531
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,169
You know, as actors our bodies
are our instruments.

532
00:20:28,203 --> 00:20:30,771
And my instrument is, um,
getting a little out of tune?

533
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:33,073
Is that where you're going
with this?

534
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,910
No, your instrument is
as handsome as ever.

535
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,578
I was just thinking maybe we

536
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,380
skip the fettuccine
and walk to the movies

537
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:41,382
and pick up a salad
at Pax on the way.

538
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:44,418
Sure.

539
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:45,886
I guess this'll keep.

540
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:48,556
Great. I'll look up show times.

541
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,625
I hear there's a great new indie
playing at the Quad.

542
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,995
Um, Blaine?

543
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,264
Don't worry, I won't order
popcorn at the movie theater.

544
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,666
And by the way, I-I know

545
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,935
that I've been putting
on a few pounds.

546
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,504
No, no.
It's just this, um, very...

547
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:04,572
adult Web site

548
00:21:04,606 --> 00:21:06,407
I-I just found on your computer.

549
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:08,876
I-I wasn't snooping.
Uh, it was just, it was open,

550
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,245
um, uh, uh, right there on the
window on the desktop. Uh...

551
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,613
well, I-I, it was just,

552
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,915
um, oh, uh...

553
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,951
"FratBoyPhysicals.com."

554
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,586
How often are you on this?

555
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,688
You know?
I-I don't want to know.

556
00:21:20,722 --> 00:21:23,157
Whatever you do on your computer
is-is-is your business.

557
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:24,792
But I-I-I just

558
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,494
I find it a little interesting
that we haven't been intimate

559
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:29,130
in-in, like a week,
and maybe this is why.

560
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,732
Wait, wait, Kurt,
l-l-let's talk about this.

561
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:34,702
No, I don't want
to talk about this!

562
00:21:38,073 --> 00:21:39,206
She's so pretty.

563
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:40,908
I have to find out
who does her hair.

564
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:44,278
"Celebrity Beauty
Tips and Tricks."

565
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:46,814
Rachel?

566
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,984
Can I ask you something, um...?

567
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,019
It's a little personal.

568
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:53,521
Yeah, of course. What's up?

569
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:55,656
What was your first time like?

570
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,493
Oh, are you...
and Sam are thinking of...?

571
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:02,063
I mean, was... was it
like a... a big deal?

572
00:22:02,097 --> 00:22:04,165
Was there, like,
a hotel and flowers?

573
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,300
'Cause I just... I feel like
I'm a little too old for that.

574
00:22:06,334 --> 00:22:07,535
You know, it's not gonna be

575
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:09,703
romantic as if I were back
in high school,

576
00:22:09,738 --> 00:22:12,073
and I don't need, like,
a big moment or anything,

577
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:13,174
but...

578
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,508
as silly as it sounds,

579
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:17,144
I do want it to be... special.

580
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:19,480
No, I know I want at least that.

581
00:22:19,514 --> 00:22:21,348
Well, my first time,

582
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,417
uh, it was just at his house.

583
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:24,552
Mm.
And, um,

584
00:22:24,586 --> 00:22:26,187
it was special because,

585
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:27,588
you know, it was with him,

586
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:29,557
and I loved him,
and he loved me.

587
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:31,559
I just...

588
00:22:31,593 --> 00:22:34,962
I don't know
if I'm ready for this.

589
00:22:34,996 --> 00:22:37,298
Look, I don't think
anyone can ever know,

590
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:39,500
like, how or if
they're ever gonna be ready.

591
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:41,569
I just think that in the moment,
when you're with that person,

592
00:22:41,603 --> 00:22:42,837
you just feel like
you want to remember

593
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:44,105
being with them for forever,

594
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:45,980
and then, everything will just
fall into place.

595
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:48,509
Kind of wish
it was both of our first times,

596
00:22:48,543 --> 00:22:52,380
'cause I just don't know
if I'm gonna be any good at it.

597
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,681
No, don't think like that.

598
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:55,483
Sam is a really good guy.

599
00:22:55,517 --> 00:22:57,485
Okay, and if you feel
like it's right,

600
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,254
then, he will make you feel
like you're the only one.

601
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:03,124
Okay.

602
00:23:05,494 --> 00:23:07,895
Hey. We were supposed to meet
at the diner so we could walk

603
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,597
to class together. What happened?
Oh.

604
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:11,632
Sorry. I got off early,
and I forgot to text you.

605
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:14,535
Gather up!
Okay, today is

606
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:18,706
stage weaponry, and, yes,
this is a real bo staff.

607
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,409
And, no, you will not be
using real blades yet.

608
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,943
Not until you can be trusted.

609
00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:26,514
Remember... safety
first, safety last.

610
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:27,948
Safety always.

611
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:29,550
That's right.

612
00:23:29,584 --> 00:23:32,119
You're still mad about
the Web site thing, aren't you?

613
00:23:32,154 --> 00:23:33,688
No. God.

614
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:35,222
All right, everyone partner up

615
00:23:35,257 --> 00:23:38,492
and start moving your way
through the weapon stations.

616
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:41,328
I really think we
should talk about this.

617
00:23:41,363 --> 00:23:42,630
You know what, Blaine?

618
00:23:42,664 --> 00:23:45,066

What the hell, Kurt?!

647
00:26:13,982 --> 00:26:15,583
- Blaine, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

648
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,084
You sure?
Safety first.

649
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,886
I said I'm fine.

650
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:32,104
Oh, my God, I love this place.

651
00:26:32,105 --> 00:26:34,306
Well, can I get you two
lovebirds anything else?

652
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,242
Uh, yeah. What's the most
expensive dessert on the menu?

653
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:38,643
Sam!

654
00:26:38,678 --> 00:26:40,178
Uh, it's a diner, Sam.
I don't think

655
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:41,279
there's really anything
too expensive.

656
00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:42,681
What about, uh, do you
guys have those milkshakes

657
00:26:42,715 --> 00:26:44,116
with, like, little specks
of gold in 'em?

658
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,283
We do not.

659
00:26:45,318 --> 00:26:46,952
Sam, you do not have any money.

660
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:48,553
I'm not gonna let you
pay for this meal.

661
00:26:50,623 --> 00:26:53,325
Oh! Oh, look! There's Artie!
I'm gonna go say hi.

662
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,593
Don't touch him.

663
00:26:54,627 --> 00:26:56,027
What? Why would I touch him?

664
00:26:56,062 --> 00:26:57,295
Just don't touch him.

665
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,097
Hello...! Welcome
to the Spotlight Diner!

666
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:01,199
Julie, this is my friend,
Kurt. We went

667
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:02,400
to high school together.

668
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:03,668
Nice to meet you.

669
00:27:03,703 --> 00:27:06,371
This place is so cool!
Totally worth

670
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:08,407
the 45 minute subway ride.

671
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:10,842
So, do you guys want a HPV
or herpes simplex two?

672
00:27:10,877 --> 00:27:11,910
What?

673
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:14,012
He asked if we want
a table or a booth.

674
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:15,347
Oh. HPV.

675
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:16,815
I mean, a table.

676
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:18,583
Follow me.

677
00:27:21,084 --> 00:27:23,564
Look, Sam, I know
what you're doing.

678
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:25,724
We're on a date,
we had a really great night,

679
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:27,959
you tried to pay
for this delicious meal.

680
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:29,428
And what's wrong with that?

681
00:27:29,462 --> 00:27:32,197
Nothing, as long
as you're not assuming

682
00:27:32,231 --> 00:27:34,866
that this night is going
to end up a certain way.

683
00:27:34,901 --> 00:27:36,401
Okay, I'm not assuming anything.

684
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:38,637
I'm just, I'm just trying
to treat my lady right.

685
00:27:38,638 --> 00:27:40,839
You know, I don't do things
in exchange for anything.

686
00:27:40,873 --> 00:27:42,841
I just, that's just my way
of saying I love you.

687
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,843
Oh.

688
00:27:44,877 --> 00:27:46,945
All right, what can
I get you two?

689
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:48,213
How about you, rolling STD?

690
00:27:48,247 --> 00:27:50,248
Um, how's your Reuben?
It's okay,

691
00:27:50,283 --> 00:27:52,384
but there is a lot of pus on it.

692
00:27:52,418 --> 00:27:54,553
I'll have that.

693
00:27:54,587 --> 00:27:57,389
Would you recommend the
wartburger with grilled scabies

694
00:27:57,423 --> 00:27:59,424
or the fettuccine
in chlamydia sauce?

695
00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:01,293
People love our wartburger,

696
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:03,462
but, um, I would go with
the chlamydia fettuccine.

697
00:28:03,496 --> 00:28:05,764
It's my personal favorite thing
from the menu.

698
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:07,265
Oh, look!
It's someone's birthday!

699
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,202
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap,
clap, clap, clap...

700
00:28:10,236 --> 00:28:12,237
I'm sorry, Kurt,
can you give us a second?

701
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:13,772
Yeah.

702
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:17,809
Julie, I need
to tell you something.

703
00:28:17,844 --> 00:28:19,211
I really, really like you.

704
00:28:19,245 --> 00:28:22,581
And I don't want to ruin what
we have by moving too fast.

705
00:28:22,615 --> 00:28:24,456
I think it would be better
for our relationship

706
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:28,286
if we agree not have sex
for the next seven to ten days.

707
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:30,322
Okay...

708
00:28:30,356 --> 00:28:33,458
um, that's sort of an insanely
weird thing to bring up.

709
00:28:33,493 --> 00:28:35,627
I just really like you,
and I don't want to...

710
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:38,096
Yeah, I-I get it, but this
is a first date, right?

711
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:40,499
So this thing that "we have"

712
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:42,467
started a little less
than an hour ago.

713
00:28:42,502 --> 00:28:44,403
Which means I myself
wasn't even really thinking

714
00:28:44,437 --> 00:28:47,506
about sex, to be honest.

715
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,308
So, yeah, I think I'll be able
to wait an entire week.

716
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:54,279
Week to ten days.
Right. Not a problem.

717
00:28:56,349 --> 00:28:59,151
Look, do you know how much
it means to me that

718
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:00,185
you're even considering this?

719
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:01,386
Look, I mean, I don't know

720
00:29:01,421 --> 00:29:02,621
if our relationship is forever,

721
00:29:02,655 --> 00:29:04,456
but I know that nothing's
ever felt

722
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,658
as real to me
as my love for you.

723
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:08,760
And if there's a way
for me to express

724
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:10,362
how I feel about you,

725
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:14,933
whether it's buying you dinner
or spending time with you

726
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,968
or having sex,
I-I want to do it.

Hey, remember the rules.

All my hands
are above the waist!

766
00:31:58,455 --> 00:31:59,822
And and top of the clothes.

767
00:32:00,857 --> 00:32:02,625
Have you ever heard of the term

768
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:04,627
"high, dry, and suffering"?

769
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:06,262
Have you ever heard
of the term,

770
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:07,530
"Hell to the no"?

771
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:09,465
Sit up. Come on.
Let's talk.

772
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,837
What's up?

773
00:32:14,871 --> 00:32:19,074
Well, you know, everything
that you said to me, um,

774
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:21,010
in the diner,
it really meant a lot.

775
00:32:21,044 --> 00:32:24,680
And I do believe that if
we were to take that step,

776
00:32:24,714 --> 00:32:26,782
that it will be incredible
and special.

777
00:32:26,817 --> 00:32:28,851
Well, you know, I've never been
like this with anybody before.

778
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:30,853
So, in a lot of ways,

779
00:32:30,887 --> 00:32:32,755
it would be a first time
for me, too.

780
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:34,824
I went back to church
and I prayed about

781
00:32:34,858 --> 00:32:36,091
all of this all over again.

782
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:37,993
And I need to wait, Sam.

783
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:41,130
Okay, um, I can, I can dig that.

784
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:43,809
How long? Like, um,
a couple weeks?

785
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:45,935
Until I'm married.

786
00:32:45,969 --> 00:32:47,837
All right, hold on.

787
00:32:47,871 --> 00:32:49,638
Okay, I-I love you,
but I don't think

788
00:32:49,673 --> 00:32:51,607
I can get married
in a couple of weeks.

789
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:53,709
We haven't even
sent out invitations,

790
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:55,444
and that takes a long time.

791
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:57,680
I know that this

792
00:32:57,714 --> 00:32:59,181
sounds old-fashioned,

793
00:32:59,216 --> 00:33:01,517
but there's this special part
in my soul,

794
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:03,886
and it's the most secret
and vulnerable part,

795
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,555
and when I give that to a man,

796
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,824
I'll be completely exposed.

797
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:11,160
I can't just do that
with just anyone.

798
00:33:12,195 --> 00:33:14,130
I'm not just anyone.

799
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,035
I need to know that
the man that I'm with

800
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,570
is gonna be there
for me forever.

801
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:23,239
I want him to be my husband

802
00:33:23,273 --> 00:33:24,573
and I want him to open up to me

803
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:26,542
in the same way, too.

804
00:33:26,576 --> 00:33:28,744
You know, maybe when I do it

805
00:33:28,778 --> 00:33:31,046
I'll feel silly for making it
such a big deal,

806
00:33:31,081 --> 00:33:32,214
but maybe I won't.

807
00:33:32,249 --> 00:33:34,016
So you're saying it's just,

808
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,819
it's never gonna happen
unless we get married.

809
00:33:36,853 --> 00:33:37,887
Well, yeah.

810
00:33:37,921 --> 00:33:39,889
I mean, for now we'll just...

811
00:33:39,923 --> 00:33:41,891
have to figure out
ways to feel close

812
00:33:41,925 --> 00:33:43,092
that aren't physical.

813
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:44,160
Okay, so...

814
00:33:44,194 --> 00:33:45,694
what's the difference in that

815
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:47,396
and just being
really good friends?

816
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,464
Okay? I...

817
00:33:48,498 --> 00:33:49,765
I love you, Mercedes,

818
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,101
but, like, I'm also
a 19-year-old guy, and...

819
00:33:52,135 --> 00:33:54,470
I want to be able
to do this for you.

820
00:33:54,504 --> 00:33:55,838
But I-I can't.

821
00:34:01,411 --> 00:34:03,371
Can I have some time
to think about it?

822
00:34:04,314 --> 00:34:05,948
Yeah, sure.

823
00:34:05,982 --> 00:34:08,417
Take your time.

824
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,458
Yeah.

825
00:34:15,492 --> 00:34:17,860
Yeah, he's here.

826
00:34:17,894 --> 00:34:19,662
Okay. Okay, bye.

827
00:34:19,696 --> 00:34:21,697
Bye.

828
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:25,534
That was Rachel.

829
00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:28,370
She was just confirming us
for her opening night.

830
00:34:28,405 --> 00:34:29,939
What'd you tell her?

831
00:34:29,973 --> 00:34:31,907
I said, "Yeah, if we don't

832
00:34:31,942 --> 00:34:33,242
"kill each other
in Combat Class,

833
00:34:33,276 --> 00:34:35,277
count us in."

834
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:37,346
What happened in there?

835
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,814
You were really coming at me,

836
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:40,382
like-like... as if
you had something to prove.

837
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:42,384
What, I'm not sure.

838
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:44,220
That I'm as strong as you are.

839
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:46,655
Okay, but it's not a contest.

840
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,656
Isn't it, though?

841
00:34:47,691 --> 00:34:50,626
On some level?

842
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,461
'Cause for the first time
in my life,

843
00:34:52,496 --> 00:34:54,330
I really feel like I'm losing.

844
00:34:54,364 --> 00:34:55,664
I've felt that way

845
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:56,859
ever since I got to New York.

846
00:34:56,867 --> 00:34:59,068
I feel like...

847
00:34:59,102 --> 00:35:00,836
we're in this race together

848
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:05,207
and you are just so much
farther than I am.

849
00:35:05,242 --> 00:35:07,243
Like, it just feels
like the whole balance

850
00:35:07,277 --> 00:35:08,244
has shifted.

851
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:09,278
What balance?

852
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:12,648
I guess it started when

853
00:35:12,682 --> 00:35:14,316
we first met,
and you came to Dalton

854
00:35:14,351 --> 00:35:15,317
because you were trying

855
00:35:15,352 --> 00:35:16,652
to get away from Karofsky

856
00:35:16,686 --> 00:35:18,120
and I wanted to help
you through that.

857
00:35:18,155 --> 00:35:19,355
And you did.

858
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:21,257
And I loved the way that felt.

859
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:23,125
I loved, I loved being
able to protect you,

860
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,627
but now I look at your life

861
00:35:24,661 --> 00:35:26,662
and... it's
completely different.

862
00:35:26,696 --> 00:35:28,197
Y-You're a star at school,

863
00:35:28,231 --> 00:35:29,665
y-you have all these
cool new friends,

864
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,134
you started this band
and I just...

865
00:35:32,169 --> 00:35:33,469
I feel like you don't
need me anymore.

866
00:35:33,503 --> 00:35:35,304
To protect or anything.

867
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:37,273
I mean, you asked me
to move out, for God's sake.

868
00:35:37,307 --> 00:35:38,874
We made that decision together.

869
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:41,243
So-so is that what

870
00:35:41,278 --> 00:35:43,479
all this stuff is about,
that's going on?

871
00:35:43,513 --> 00:35:44,980
I mean, you trying
to get me to eat more?

872
00:35:45,015 --> 00:35:46,649
I don't like the way

873
00:35:46,683 --> 00:35:49,151
that I feel about myself
anymore, Kurt. Okay?

874
00:35:49,186 --> 00:35:50,986
And you have this, like...

875
00:35:51,021 --> 00:35:52,388
amazing new body.

876
00:35:52,422 --> 00:35:54,623
Do you want to know why
we haven't been intimate?

877
00:35:54,658 --> 00:35:57,226
It's because I feel
insecure around you.

878
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,329
I feel insecure
around my own fiancé,

879
00:36:00,364 --> 00:36:03,999
and fratboyphysicals.com
isn't gonna judge me.

880
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:05,034
And neither will I.

881
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:06,469
Ever.

882
00:36:06,503 --> 00:36:08,571
But I am not going to apologize

883
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:10,005
for not being some
delicate flower

884
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,474
that needs his boyfriend
to protect him.

885
00:36:11,508 --> 00:36:12,508
And you know what?
Maybe you're right.

886
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:13,876
Maybe it is a contest.

887
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,479
Maybe that's the way
it has to be with two guys.

888
00:36:16,513 --> 00:36:18,948
But I would much rather be
running this race with you

889
00:36:18,982 --> 00:36:20,116
rather than against you.

890
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,817
Me, too. I just...

891
00:36:21,852 --> 00:36:23,786
As equals.

892
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,820
I know, I know.

893
00:36:24,855 --> 00:36:25,821
I-I know.

894
00:36:25,856 --> 00:36:27,189
I know that, I'm sorry.

895
00:36:27,224 --> 00:36:29,225
I'm just...

896
00:36:31,161 --> 00:36:35,097
I'm just so scared
that you're gonna...

897
00:36:35,132 --> 00:36:36,899
keep changing,

898
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:39,869
and you're gonna
keep getting stronger,

899
00:36:39,903 --> 00:36:41,570
and then one day
you're gonna wake up

900
00:36:41,605 --> 00:36:44,940
and you're gonna realize that
"I don't love him anymore."

901
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:47,176
Never.

902
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,911
I'm always gonna love you.

903
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:51,047
And I don't want
you to be insecure

904
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:52,381
or ashamed around me.

905
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:55,418
Next time you're going through
something like this,

906
00:36:55,452 --> 00:36:57,332
you-you have to be
honest with me.

907
00:36:59,356 --> 00:37:00,389
Okay.

908
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:10,433
Julie.
I need to talk to you.

909
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:12,268
Our date was weird, and
I wanted to apologize.

910
00:37:12,302 --> 00:37:13,936
Yeah, it was weird.

911
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,371
You were all jumpy and nervous

912
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:17,940
and the sex conversation
was really bizarre.

913
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:19,608
Well, there was a reason
why I was acting so weird,

914
00:37:19,643 --> 00:37:20,943
and it's difficult
to talk about,

915
00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:22,858
but I need to be
completely honest.

916
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:24,780
I have chlamydia.

917
00:37:24,815 --> 00:37:26,415
Are you serious?

918
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,616
Yeah.

919
00:37:27,651 --> 00:37:28,951
And I'm not even sure
who I got it from.

920
00:37:28,986 --> 00:37:30,586
What? You don't know?

921
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,954
Well, it was either Vanessa

922
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:33,622
from our Postwar
European Cinema class,

923
00:37:33,657 --> 00:37:35,291
or Jessica from my

924
00:37:35,325 --> 00:37:36,425
Contemporary Voices in
Venereal Horror Seminar.

925
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,328
Wait, you slept with<i> them?</i>

926
00:37:39,363 --> 00:37:41,964
Artie, that's grosser
than the chlamydia.

927
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:43,132
Those girls are idiots.

928
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:44,100
Last term,

929
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:45,255
Vanessa made a short film

930
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:46,669
that consisted of
a single shot of her

931
00:37:46,703 --> 00:37:48,671
eating a pile of dirt
for 45 minutes.

932
00:37:48,705 --> 00:37:51,007
And Jessica had an endoscopy
for a stomach ulcer

933
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:53,409
and then entitled the footage
"Another Holocaust"

934
00:37:53,443 --> 00:37:54,910
and submitted it to Sundance.

935
00:37:54,945 --> 00:37:56,412
Look, I just wanted to be
completely honest with you...

936
00:37:56,446 --> 00:37:58,080
Well, great.

937
00:37:58,115 --> 00:38:00,149
Great, that you want to honest,

938
00:38:00,183 --> 00:38:03,486
'cause honesty makes you see
who everyone really is,

939
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,820
and who you are

940
00:38:04,855 --> 00:38:06,122
is not who I thought you were.

941
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,491
You're a creeper, Artie.

942
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:10,026
Congratulations

943
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,061
on totally skeeving me out.

944
00:38:23,356 --> 00:38:24,657
Hey, Mercedes, it's Sam.

945
00:38:24,691 --> 00:38:26,225
Yeah, I-I know.

946
00:38:26,259 --> 00:38:28,194
Um, if you're calling
to break up with me,

947
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:30,529
just go ahead and say it
a-and just get it over with,

948
00:38:30,564 --> 00:38:32,725
so we can figure out
how we're gonna be friends.

949
00:38:38,004 --> 00:38:39,338
Hold up.

950
00:38:39,372 --> 00:38:40,639
Blaine lit a bunch of candles.

951
00:38:40,674 --> 00:38:41,674
Blaine!

952
00:38:45,278 --> 00:38:46,312
Blaine!

953
00:38:47,414 --> 00:38:48,714
Mercedes,
I gotta cut this short.

954
00:38:48,748 --> 00:38:50,416
My girlfriend,
uh, just arrived.

955
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,751
Oh, uh, don't worry.

956
00:38:52,786 --> 00:38:55,226
I have a fire extinguisher handy
in case anything tips over.

957
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,591
Look, uh, I hope you don't
think I'm copying you,

958
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:00,659
but I also prayed about us.

959
00:39:00,694 --> 00:39:02,394
I didn't go back
to that church,

960
00:39:02,429 --> 00:39:04,764
'cause I didn't remember
where it was, but...

961
00:39:04,798 --> 00:39:07,039
I prayed in the bathroom
and that's where it hit me.

962
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:10,402
sex is awesome.

963
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:11,604
It's like one of
the greatest things

964
00:39:11,638 --> 00:39:12,638
that God ever invented.

965
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,375
But what's better
than sex? Um...

966
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,376
Horseback riding.

967
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,312
Um... skydiving,
probably.

968
00:39:20,347 --> 00:39:22,314
And hearing you sing.

969
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,251
Look, I-I don't need

970
00:39:25,285 --> 00:39:26,652
to think about this any more.

971
00:39:26,686 --> 00:39:29,054
I... you know,
I've said this before,

972
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:30,890
but this time,
I really mean it.

973
00:39:30,924 --> 00:39:33,225
I can... live without sex.

974
00:39:34,494 --> 00:39:36,128
But I can't live without you.

975
00:39:36,163 --> 00:39:37,284
Sam Evans...

976
00:39:42,068 --> 00:39:44,136
You have no idea how nice it is

977
00:39:44,171 --> 00:39:46,038
to have a real girlfriend
here to talk to.

978
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:47,540
I mean, Kurt pretends
to be one,

979
00:39:47,574 --> 00:39:48,874
but it's not the same,

980
00:39:48,909 --> 00:39:50,843
and Santana was just
a<i> tad</i> unpredictable.

981
00:39:50,877 --> 00:39:53,079
Yeah, well, thanks
for the good advice

982
00:39:53,113 --> 00:39:55,281
about the whole S-E-X thing.

983
00:39:55,315 --> 00:39:56,849
Okay, my philosophy is that if

984
00:39:56,883 --> 00:39:58,724
you can't even say the
word without spelling it,

985
00:39:58,752 --> 00:40:00,453
then you're
definitely not ready.

986
00:40:00,487 --> 00:40:02,721
Hey, I am not a prude.

987
00:40:02,756 --> 00:40:04,023
Okay.

988
00:40:04,057 --> 00:40:05,591
Okay.
I'm kind of a prude.

989
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,829
But you know, my heart is
my biggest erogenous zone.

990
00:40:09,863 --> 00:40:11,597
I just... if I decide to do it,

991
00:40:11,631 --> 00:40:13,265
I want it to be
the making love version,

992
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,167
not the bumping uglies version.

993
00:40:15,202 --> 00:40:16,602
Well, Sam definitely loves you,

994
00:40:16,636 --> 00:40:18,437
because I don't know
any other 19-year-old boy

995
00:40:18,438 --> 00:40:19,739
who would say it's okay to wait

996
00:40:19,773 --> 00:40:21,493
if he wasn't, like,
totally in love with you

997
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:22,641
and obsessed with you.

998
00:40:22,676 --> 00:40:24,610
No, I know that he loves me now.

999
00:40:24,644 --> 00:40:28,180
But it's easy to love
when it's new, you know, and...

1000
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:29,782
if he can put up with
my crazy and my sass

1001
00:40:29,816 --> 00:40:30,916
for just a couple more weeks...

1002
00:40:30,951 --> 00:40:32,418
or even a couple of months...
who knows?

1003
00:40:32,452 --> 00:40:34,086
Well, I salute you.

1004
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:36,021
And I have a very
good feeling about this

1005
00:40:36,056 --> 00:40:37,723
and I think Sam's a great guy.
Yeah.

1006
00:40:37,758 --> 00:40:39,191
I don't know, there was
like a minute there

1007
00:40:39,226 --> 00:40:40,793
where I thought something might
happen between he and I,

1008
00:40:40,827 --> 00:40:41,994
but it passed, thankfully.

1009
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:43,829
Really? How come?

1010
00:40:43,864 --> 00:40:45,364
Well, besides the fact

1011
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:46,879
that you two are
obviously soul mates.

1012
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,434
Oh, my God, obviously.

1013
00:40:48,468 --> 00:40:50,102
No, I don't think
I actually liked him,

1014
00:40:50,137 --> 00:40:51,337
I think I just, like...

1015
00:40:51,371 --> 00:40:52,771
I don't know,
he reminded me of home

1016
00:40:52,773 --> 00:40:54,240
and he and Finn were very close

1017
00:40:54,274 --> 00:40:55,875
and I think I liked the fact

1018
00:40:55,909 --> 00:40:57,276
that he understood how I felt.

1019
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,845
So...

1020
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,380
there's, like, not any guys

1021
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:02,548
that you're interested in?

1022
00:41:02,582 --> 00:41:05,184
Like, um... none of
your cast members,

1023
00:41:05,218 --> 00:41:06,519
or that director?

1024
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:07,520
Please.

1025
00:41:07,554 --> 00:41:08,788
This is closed for business.

1026
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
Rachel, you know
you guys weren't dating

1027
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:12,725
when it all went down, though.

1028
00:41:12,759 --> 00:41:14,794
No, come on,
we were always dating.

1029
00:41:14,828 --> 00:41:16,128
You know, even when we weren't.

1030
00:41:16,163 --> 00:41:18,030
We knew how it was gonna end.

1031
00:41:18,065 --> 00:41:19,699
Or, you know,
how it was supposed to.

1032
00:41:19,733 --> 00:41:21,033
I get that.

1033
00:41:21,068 --> 00:41:22,768
I think we all did.

1034
00:41:22,803 --> 00:41:25,237
But you're this amazing,
beautiful woman

1035
00:41:25,272 --> 00:41:27,907
about to go through the
greatest triumph in her life.

1036
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:29,575
Hey, I'm not saying
that you need

1037
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:31,911
to go out there and
fall in love, but...

1038
00:41:31,945 --> 00:41:33,779
let a dude, I don't know,
buy you dinner.

1039
00:41:33,814 --> 00:41:35,114
Tell you how hot you are.

1040
00:41:35,148 --> 00:41:36,449
I know. I should.

1041
00:41:36,483 --> 00:41:37,917
And I will.

1042
00:41:37,951 --> 00:41:39,151
It's just like...

1043
00:41:39,186 --> 00:41:40,519
you know, it's like a line

1044
00:41:40,554 --> 00:41:42,488
between your past
and your future and...

1045
00:41:42,522 --> 00:41:44,156
I mean, I'll draw it
when I'm ready.

1046
00:41:44,191 --> 00:41:45,825
It's like you and Sam.
You know, you weren't ready;

1047
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:47,259
you just had to listen
to your heart

1048
00:41:47,294 --> 00:41:48,661
and you'll know when it's right.
I know, babe.

1049
00:41:48,695 --> 00:41:50,329
You're okay, though, right?

1050
00:41:50,364 --> 00:41:52,598
Like, I didn't push too hard,
did I?

1051
00:41:52,632 --> 00:41:55,001
No.

1052
00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:56,235
Like I said, it's really great

1053
00:41:56,236 --> 00:41:57,636
having a girlfriend
here to talk to.

1054
00:41:58,538 --> 00:42:00,298
You know what?
It really is.

1055
00:42:03,377 --> 00:42:04,977
So how does that work, exactly?

1056
00:42:05,012 --> 00:42:07,013
Well, I have
to drink five pints

1057
00:42:07,047 --> 00:42:08,287
of hot coconut water every day,

1058
00:42:08,315 --> 00:42:09,515
with a little garlic salt,
some Splenda

1059
00:42:09,549 --> 00:42:12,184
and a splash of hot sauce.

1060
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:15,021
Then you basically jog
until you hallucinate.

1061
00:42:15,055 --> 00:42:16,956
I got it off of
Matthew McConaughey's blog.

1062
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,791
- That doesn't sound healthy.
- It's not.

1063
00:42:18,825 --> 00:42:20,359
What we're really doing
is just saying that, you know,

1064
00:42:20,394 --> 00:42:21,360
we're gonna start
eating healthier

1065
00:42:21,395 --> 00:42:22,728
and cooking healthier

1066
00:42:22,763 --> 00:42:25,044
and, uh, we started this new
ab class at the NYADA gym

1067
00:42:25,065 --> 00:42:26,666
and, uh, this is
kind of our way

1068
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,267
of saying good-bye
to eating out for a while.

1069
00:42:28,301 --> 00:42:29,869
So thank you so much
for being here

1070
00:42:29,903 --> 00:42:31,783
on the start of
Blaine's cleanse.

1071
00:42:33,173 --> 00:42:34,273
Whoa, Artie...

1072
00:42:34,307 --> 00:42:36,175
You want to talk about it?
Talk about what?

1073
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:37,877
Oh, my God,
that looks really delicious.

1074
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:38,944
What you're burying
in your worry hole

1075
00:42:38,979 --> 00:42:40,046
with all that hot fudge
and nuts?

1076
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,148
That girl Julie
still not talking to you?

1077
00:42:42,182 --> 00:42:43,983
She's not<i> not</i> talking to me,

1078
00:42:44,017 --> 00:42:46,686
it's just... I can see how she
sees me now, and it sucks.

1079
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,321
I didn't think there'd
actually be a downside

1080
00:42:48,355 --> 00:42:50,222
to being a film school
player, but I was wrong.

1081
00:42:50,257 --> 00:42:51,223
And I'd paid the price.

1082
00:42:51,258 --> 00:42:53,559
Herpes.
No.

1083
00:42:53,593 --> 00:42:54,694
Losing Julie.

1084
00:42:54,728 --> 00:42:57,396
And it was chlamydia.
Anyway...

1085
00:42:57,431 --> 00:42:59,031
I'm gonna give up the game.

1086
00:42:59,066 --> 00:43:00,733
For a little while, at least.

1087
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:02,727
I mean, sex isn't
the be-all-end-all.

1088
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,580
Well, it's like me
and Mercedes, you know?

1089
00:43:05,605 --> 00:43:07,373
Something's important, you can't
let sex get in the way of it.

1090
00:43:07,407 --> 00:43:09,241
Hey, you know what, guys?

1091
00:43:09,276 --> 00:43:11,911
We should do an all-guys
New York City Abstinence Club.

1092
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:14,113
No.

1093
00:43:14,147 --> 00:43:15,114
No way.
Definitely not.

1094
00:43:15,148 --> 00:43:16,115
That's not a good idea.

1095
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,484
Ugh...

1096
00:43:18,518 --> 00:43:21,882
Mm... No Oscar
is worth that.

1097
