1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:02,308
<i>So here's what you missed on</i>
Glee: <i>Marley's dating Jake,</i>

2
00:00:02,342 --> 00:00:03,860
<i>but Ryder totally kissed her</i>
<i>out of nowhere.</i>

3
00:00:03,894 --> 00:00:05,455
<i>Finn kissed Emma, too,</i>
<i>and then she freaked out</i>

4
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:07,111
<i>and left Will at the altar.</i>

5
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:09,297
<i>Everyone felt bad, but not bad</i>
<i>enough to waste a wedding</i>

6
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:10,882
<i>reception and everybody hooked</i>
<i>out, and I mean everybody.</i>

7
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:12,617
<i>Now Rachel thinks she might</i>
<i>have a bun in the oven</i>

8
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:13,885
<i>and Santana moved in with her</i>
<i>and Kurt and Brody lives there,</i>

9
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:15,153
<i>too, except he's gone a lot</i>

10
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:16,971
<i>and carries large wads of cash.</i>

11
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:18,306
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

12
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,328
(chuckles) Every Jack and
Jill at the Carousel Club

13
00:00:23,362 --> 00:00:25,063
couldn't take their peepers
off of you tonight.

14
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:28,066
Oh, applesauce. Oh, honest Injun.
And who could blame them?

15
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:30,368
You're the eighth Wonder of
the World, Emma Schuester.

16
00:00:30,402 --> 00:00:32,287
You're sunbeams and angel wings

17
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:36,007
and the Taj Mahal all rolled
into one marvelous dame.

18
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:38,293
And when we dance
together, why,

19
00:00:38,344 --> 00:00:39,544
my universe

20
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:41,129
becomes topsy-turvy.

21
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,798
Like gravity was never invented.

Everybody loves movies.

51
00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:58,650
They don't just tell stories...
they transport us

52
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:00,718
to other worlds.
They are inspirational.

53
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,820
They provide comfort,
and they help us escape

54
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:04,339
from our day-to-day anxieties.

55
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:06,407
Like getting left at the altar?

Too soon.
Exactly.

57
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:12,230
Or in your guys' case,
studying for exams or...

58
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:14,115
worrying about regionals.

59
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,399
In any case,

60
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:16,668
for this week's assignment,
I want you to pick

61
00:03:16,702 --> 00:03:19,237
your favorite songs
from your favorite movies.

Unique knows all there is
to know about <i>The Crying Game.</i>

00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,010
KITTY: You don't get dibs on <i>Les Mis
</i> just because you are the poster.

65
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,912
SAM (a la Nicolas Cage): Finally
I can do my Nicolas Cage

66
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,415
impression. "Oh, not the bees!
No! The bees! No!"

67
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:33,584
That is the worst Nicolas Cage
impression I've ever seen.

68
00:03:33,602 --> 00:03:34,969
Do you even know
who Nicolas Cage is?

69
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:36,020
WILL: Okay, it's not
that simple, guys.

70
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:38,223
This is a group competition...

71
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:41,192
boys against girls
and we are doing mash-ups.

72
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:43,144
Now remember,
movies are visual.

73
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:45,146
So it's not just about
the singing... it's about...

74
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:47,148
performance,
it's about theatricality,

75
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,534
it's about the language
of cinema.

76
00:03:49,568 --> 00:03:52,436
Preach. And as I move
into production

77
00:03:52,454 --> 00:03:55,740
on my first micro-budget feature...
(overlapping chatter)

78
00:03:55,774 --> 00:03:59,777
...I'm happy to offer starring
roles to whichever team wins.

79
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:01,713
No trailers, no per diem.

80
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:02,747
WILL:
Great. Okay.

81
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:03,915
Well, everyone split up
and start working

82
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:06,217
on your song choices.
(indistinct chatter)

83
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:08,169
You're making a movie?
Yeah.

84
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,388
Hey. Can I talk
to you for a sec?

85
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:12,223
Yeah.

86
00:04:12,258 --> 00:04:14,625
We should do <i>The Artist</i>
so we don't have to sing.

87
00:04:14,643 --> 00:04:16,644
(bell ringing)

88
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:21,482
So, how's the case going,
Detective Shue?

89
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,902
Her parents are
stonewalling me and...

90
00:04:24,937 --> 00:04:26,738
I don't have
any other leads right now.

91
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:28,740
So, what else
have you been up to?

92
00:04:28,774 --> 00:04:30,775
Come on. I'm starting to get
worried about you, man.

93
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:31,859
Finn, you can't just force

94
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,194
someone to do something.

95
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:34,912
Right now it's about
taking a step back

96
00:04:34,947 --> 00:04:36,948
and giving her some space.

97
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:38,950
In the meantime,
I'm catching up on a lot

98
00:04:38,984 --> 00:04:40,318
of old movies.

99
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:41,619
Really calms me down.

100
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:44,789
Look...

101
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:46,490
if she really wants
to be with me,

102
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:47,992
then she'll come back
on her own.

103
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,878
So, sitting around in front
of the TV is somehow supposed

104
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:52,663
to make her want to come back?

105
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:53,998
Of course not. I...

106
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:55,633
Look, I know she's hurt,

107
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,385
but I'm hurt, too.

108
00:04:57,436 --> 00:04:59,771
You are a good man, and I
really appreciate your concern,

109
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:02,223
but it's time to leave it alone.
No, it's-it's not.

110
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:03,775
It... It's time to take action.

111
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:05,943
Come on. <i>Stand and Deliver.</i>

112
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:07,979
<i>Zero Dark Thirty.</i>

113
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:12,317
(sighs)

114
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:14,986
(bell ringing)
I'm sorry, Finn Hudson.

115
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,655
But even I don't know
the whereabouts of the lovely

116
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:19,857
yet fragile Miss
Emma Pillsbury.

117
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,411
But I can tell you she's cashed
in all of her vacation days.

118
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:25,863
But you don't know where she went?
I have no idea, and frankly,

119
00:05:25,898 --> 00:05:28,466
I resent your flabby
accusation that

120
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,252
just because I wore an exact
replica of her wedding dress

121
00:05:31,286 --> 00:05:34,005
and was the last person to see
her before her Broadway-themed

122
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,291
freak-out that I have anything
to do with her being missing.

123
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:39,143
I'm not accusing you
of anything.

124
00:05:39,178 --> 00:05:41,779
Well, I assume she's checked
into some ginger asylum

125
00:05:41,814 --> 00:05:43,197
somewhere now
that she's escaped

126
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:46,384
from Will Schuester's
living dollhouse of the damned.

127
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:49,454
Even if I were privy to that
information, even if I did know,

128
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:52,990
I certainly wouldn't divulge it
to a flop sweat-smelling,

129
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:55,326
fake-teen-teaching,
Army-deserting,

130
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:57,395
high school-lurking,
sectionals-losing,

131
00:05:57,413 --> 00:05:59,397
special needs, baby-hating...

132
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:01,732
Point is, Sue didn't know.
There has to be some way

133
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,502
to reach her, Artie.
We owe Mr. Shue that.

134
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:06,954
Finn, let me dispense
some Hollywood logic on you,

135
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:10,508
if I may. What we have
on our hands is a lady manhunt.

136
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:13,044
We need a hard-target search
of every gas station, residence,

137
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:15,680
warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse,
outhouse and doghouse.

138
00:06:15,714 --> 00:06:18,383
- Ain't nobody got time for that. 
- Okay, then just talk to her parents.

139
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:21,519
- You think?
- Pretty sure that's your only lead.

140
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:24,138
Doin' a lot of the work here.

141
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:25,807
(bell ringing)

142
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:27,892
Guys, Brittany and I were just talking...
BRITTANY: And we agree

143
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:30,094
that though we love that it's mash-up
week and that it's girls versus boys...

144
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:32,146
It sucks that the guys and the
girls can't do a number together,

145
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:34,198
so we were thinking, just
as a warm-up, we should do

146
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:36,234
the guys versus girls
in the same number,

147
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:37,985
to kick things off. And then the
girls can kick the boys' butts.

148
00:06:38,036 --> 00:06:38,870
BLAINE:
Uh, or vice versa.

149
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:40,538
Which is my favorite
Fred Savage movie.

150
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:41,739
SAM:
Well, it'd have

151
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:43,875
to be the perfect movie song,
you know, like, uh...

152
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:46,444
"Dream Warriors"

<i>My first real week in New York</i>

230
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:19,196
<i>and I'm snowbound in Bushwick</i>

231
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:21,932
<i>with a bunch</i>
<i>of musical theatre queens.</i>

232
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,818
(imitates Mrs. Patmore): No,
you're doing it wrong, Daisy.

233
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:25,653

'cause I'm in love with William.

234
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:27,438
I just can't.
<i>It's like Eli Roth decided</i>

235
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:29,440
<i>to make a gay horror movie</i>
<i>and this is the scene</i>

236
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,992
<i>right before</i>
<i>we all eat each other.</i>

Oh, do it again, do it again.

238

00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:38,215
(Kurt and Adam laughing)
So, where you from, Doctor Who?

241
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,501
Uh, England. Do you know Essex?

242
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:42,053
No. Never heard of it.

243
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:43,954
Are you guys dating?
Because at Mr. Shue's bomb

244
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:46,090
of a wedding, you and Blaine, like...
(quietly): Shut up,

245
00:09:46,124 --> 00:09:48,676
Santana. Rachel and I are
letting you live here rent-free.

246
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:50,094
The least you could do is...
Where is Rachel anyways?

247
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:51,962
Giving that living mannequin
a bikini wax?

248
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,799
Uh, Brody is working and Rachel is
in the bathroom. Well, let's hope

249
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:58,269
that she's embracing her inner
bulimic because let me tell you,

250
00:09:58,303 --> 00:10:00,605
homegirl has been looking
extremely pumpkin-like

251
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,024
and not just 'cause of the Tan in a Can.
(door opens)

252
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:04,108
Okay, that's it!

253
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:05,142
You're gonna have to move out

254
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:06,360
because this <i>our</i>

255
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:08,279
sanctuary, and by ours,
I mean mine and Kurt's,

256
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:10,114
and frankly, you make me
feel uncomfortable,

257
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:11,649
and Brody says that you
make him feel uncomfortable

258
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,584
as well. Girls, girls, retract
the claws, all right?

259
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:15,486
NYADA canceled all the classes
because of the snow,

260
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:19,040
so let's just cozy up to our
little movie marathon. Santana,

261
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:20,324
did you go
through our DVD collection?

262
00:10:20,342 --> 00:10:23,294
I sure did.
Uh, <i>Knocked Up.</i> Hilarity.

263
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:25,796
<i>Rosemary's Baby...</i> that's
obviously Lady Hummel's.

264
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,599
And, uh, <i>She's Having a Baby.</i> RACHEL:
I don't want to watch any of those.

265
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:29,600
KURT:
Oh, really, Rachel?

266
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:30,885
Not even <i>She's Having a Baby?</i>

267
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:32,053
'Cause you always cry

268
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:33,721
at the end when
Elizabeth McGovern has

269
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:34,939
the baby.
I'm not

270
00:10:34,973 --> 00:10:36,807

I'm not in the mood.

271
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,442
KURT:
Okay, fine.

272
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:40,277
Because I have made
a selection that is perfect

273

Kurt, are you crying?

332
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:32,524
Um... no, no.
My-my contacts are...

333
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:34,643
really bothering me right now.

334
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:36,078
I didn't know you wore contacts.
Yes, Rachel,

335
00:14:36,112 --> 00:14:37,813
I just found out I have
a slight astigmatism.

336
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:40,365
ADAM: Oh, I think I might have
some solution in my bag.

337
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,402
No, no, I'm fine. I'll be good. Don't worry.
I would've thought that

338
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:44,703
you were crying
because you and Blaine

339
00:14:44,737 --> 00:14:46,321
used to talk about
how this was your dream

340
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:48,156
to sing this song to each other
at your wedding.

341
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:49,992
Did we?

342
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:51,410
Yeah. I remember you telling me

343
00:14:51,444 --> 00:14:52,878
that singing
this song to someone

344
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:54,612
was a more intimate act
than sex.

345
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,781
Who wants popcorn? Anyone?
SANTANA: No.

346
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,283
Hold on. I'm sorry.
Can we pause this

347
00:14:58,301 --> 00:14:59,617
for a second?
Kurt, please sit down.

348
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:01,169
I have something
to say, and I have

349
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,256
tried to keep it to myself,
but I will be silent no longer.

350
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,175
What is it? That Brody character
is a freakin' psycho.

351
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:08,393
Go on.

352
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:09,895
Here we go. SANTANA: Listen,

353
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:11,580
when I first met him,
totally thought he was weird.

354
00:15:11,614 --> 00:15:13,715
He smelled all talcum-y
like a Cabbage Patch Doll.

355
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,067
And then he said

356
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:16,601
that I wasn't a real New Yorker

357
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:18,687
until I had my first makeover,
and I was, like,

358
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:20,272
what does that even mean?

359
00:15:20,306 --> 00:15:21,639
Like, who are you?

360
00:15:21,657 --> 00:15:23,575
Oh, come on,
Brody's a sweetheart.

361
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:25,027
That's what
I told myself, you know?

362
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:26,978
I said, "So what if he's
completely hairless"

363
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:29,948
"and made out of plastic... I'm
gonna look past the fact that

364
00:15:29,982 --> 00:15:32,417
"he probably has a disgusting
porn star landing strip.

365
00:15:32,452 --> 00:15:33,785
"I'm gonna give Lars

366
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:36,455
"and the Real Boy
one more chance." But then

367
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:38,823
I found... this.

368
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,659
$1,200 in cash.

369
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:42,994
When did you find that?

370
00:15:43,012 --> 00:15:44,162
Last night when
I was rooting through

371
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,630
all the pockets and drawers
in this apartment.

372
00:15:55,024 --> 00:15:56,274
Wait. What?

373
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:57,476
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

374
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,228
Santana, you went through
all of our stuff?

375
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,679
Yeah. That's a thing I do.

376
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:03,148
It's completely unacceptable.
I can't.

377
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:05,567
Oh, okay. I like
how you guys pretend

378
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:07,402
to be all accepting
about everything,

379
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:09,121
but when your friend
suddenly shows up

380
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:12,190
in your home, moves in
and goes through all your stuff,

381
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,742
you're offended?

382
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:15,527
Just because he has
a little money on him

383
00:16:15,545 --> 00:16:16,745
doesn't mean
that he's a psycho.

384
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:17,913
That's what I thought, right?

385
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:19,414
Who cares if he's
terrified of banks?

386
00:16:19,465 --> 00:16:21,133
'Cause if <i>I</i> were
made out of plastic,

387
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:22,417
I'd be scared of a lot

388
00:16:22,468 --> 00:16:25,003
of things, too:
Open flames, barbecues. Then...

389
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:27,939
I found... this.

390
00:16:27,974 --> 00:16:29,141
What is that?

391
00:16:29,175 --> 00:16:30,675
Is that a garage door opener?

392
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:32,094
This is a pager, my friends.

393
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:33,345
And there's only one type

394
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,347
of person in this world
that carries cash

395
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:36,681
<i>and</i> a pager.

396
00:16:36,715 --> 00:16:39,851
Your friend Brody...

Okay, so-so let me
get this straight.

401
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:51,396
You brought us here because

402
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:54,232
the "Stop Ginger Bullying Club"
founded by our daughter

403
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,234
is in trouble. ARTIE:
We're leaderless.

404
00:16:56,252 --> 00:16:58,170
We're hemorrhaging money.

405
00:16:58,204 --> 00:17:00,505
We won't make it to the end of the month.
ROSE: That's horrible.

You two don't smell

00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:07,912
What do gingers smell like?

410
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,331
Gingers smell like pennies.

411
00:17:09,365 --> 00:17:10,999
We have a slight coppery odor.

WOMAN:
It's true.

When Rusty's away
on one of his business trips

414
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,754
to Ecuador and...
I'm really missing him,

415
00:17:16,772 --> 00:17:20,142
sometimes I shove my face
in a bowl full of loose change

It's about your daughter, Emma.

419
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:28,700
We just really need

00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:30,768
our faculty sponsor
to come back.

421
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:32,237
See, it's college
application time,

422
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:34,105
and young
Artie Seymour Hoffman here

really needs a scholarship.

forget about the hair

wheelchair thing.

RUSTY: You don't
want Emma's advice

00:17:42,548 --> 00:17:44,499
about college...
she doesn't know anything.

428
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,219
The kids at this school
don't seem to even think

429
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:50,222
about what college they want
to go to until about a week

430
00:17:50,256 --> 00:17:51,673
before graduation.

431
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:53,592
That's weird. You're
supposed to figure that out

432
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:54,960
when you're a junior.

433
00:17:54,994 --> 00:17:57,846
Look, I just need her
to proofread my personal essay.

434
00:17:57,897 --> 00:17:59,631
All we need

435
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:01,733
is an address.
We just need

436
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,801
to know where she is.

437
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,115
(quietly):
Thank you.

438

Oh, my God, it's getting
worse out there.

439
00:18:22,922 --> 00:18:25,257
We've been snowed in
for 48 hours.

440
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,491
Let's finish watching
<i>Moulin Rouge</i>

441
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:27,876
before we lose power again.

442
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:31,046
Or start eating each other.
Oh, no, please spare us.

443
00:18:31,097 --> 00:18:32,430
If I see one more
scene of Satine

444
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:33,932
coughing up blood
into a handkerchief,

<i>I'm</i> gonna start coughing up

Come on, Santana, it's so good,

447
00:18:37,136 --> 00:18:38,603
and we're right
in the middle of it.

448
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:41,389
Let's put it to a vote. Yea.
Oh, house vote. I say yea.

449
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,607
Yea. <i>Moulin Rouge</i> it is.

450
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:43,725
Well, what about Brody's vote?

451
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:45,443
Or do drug dealers
not get to vote?

452
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:47,312
Okay, he's not a drug dealer.

453
00:18:47,346 --> 00:18:49,064
Please, okay?
It's snowing outside.

454
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:50,398
He's probably
just stranded somewhere.

455
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:52,117
Do you want me to call him?

456
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:55,120
Okay. I'll
prove it to you.

Hey, Rach.
Hey, babe. Where are you?

459
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:03,295
Aw, the bridges are closed...
I'm stuck at my friend's house

460
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:04,963
in Manhattan.

461
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:06,081
You remember Leo, right?

462
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:07,198
Well, I miss you.

463
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:08,800
We're in the middle

Well, it's our tribute
to the early

I have a confession to make.

532
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:06,151
For the past six months,
I've sat behind your back

533
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:07,735
and in front of your face
that you're poor and fat

534
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,339
and mousy and boring and you
dress like Zach Galifianakis.

535
00:22:10,856 --> 00:22:12,107
I apologize.

536
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:13,724
God made me, and he's not
through with me yet.

537
00:22:13,742 --> 00:22:14,742
Besides, we're both

538
00:22:14,777 --> 00:22:15,994
dating Puckermans,
and someday we'll be

539
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:17,412
sister-in-laws and
hanging out with

541
00:22:19,198 --> 00:22:20,915

What's going on?

542
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,586
If I tell you something,

543
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,788
do you swear not to tell anyone?

544
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:30,258
Swear.

545
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:32,743
Last week, Ryder kissed me.

546
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:34,179
OMG.

548
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:37,265
humongous donkey teeth
bite into your lips?

549
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:39,684
He was good, but...
I still like Jake.

550
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:41,436
Say no more.
I completely get it.

And some turn into diamonds.

625
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,247
from the storm.

626
00:25:23,282 --> 00:25:24,749
I was a little sad we, uh,

627
00:25:24,783 --> 00:25:26,834
weren't snowed in
a little longer.

628
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:28,586
Ah, I know, I always
get a little sad

629
00:25:28,621 --> 00:25:30,838
when the sun comes out
and the snow starts to melt

630
00:25:30,873 --> 00:25:32,957
and all the snowmen look like
they have scoliosis.

631
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:35,176
But it was nice
to hang out with you and,

632
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,260
uh, watch a few movies.
Well,

633
00:25:36,295 --> 00:25:38,713
a movie.
A movie.

634
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:41,466
Look, about that...

635
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,550
Uh...

636
00:25:44,053 --> 00:25:45,603
I'm gonna ask you something

637
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:47,355
and I want you to be honest.

638
00:25:49,992 --> 00:25:51,442
You and Blaine did used to sing

639
00:25:51,477 --> 00:25:53,895
that duet together, didn't you?

640
00:25:56,532 --> 00:25:58,366
Yeah.

641
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,701
But it feels like

642
00:25:59,735 --> 00:26:01,452
a lifetime ago.

643
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:04,706
Maybe that's what's
hard about it.

644
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,493
You still love him, don't you?

645
00:26:11,997 --> 00:26:14,332
Was I your rebound?

646
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,484
No. No.

647
00:26:16,518 --> 00:26:19,337
'Cause I can't compete
with a fantasy, Kurt.

648
00:26:21,757 --> 00:26:24,676
I desperately want
to be over him.

649
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,594
Really, I do.

650
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,814
Good.

651
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:31,516
Then let's go to the
movies right now.

652
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,518
Oh, I'm serious.

653
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:34,986
We are going to go and find

654
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,054
the sappiest love
story that we can,

655
00:26:37,072 --> 00:26:38,239
and then that

656
00:26:38,273 --> 00:26:40,942
will be our movie.

657
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:44,662
(school bell rings)
Tomorrow, we watch.

658
00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:46,531
Spielberg's <i>Lincoln.</i>

659
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,199
Uh... sorry.

660
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,200
I found her.

661
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:50,918
What? Where?

662
00:26:50,953 --> 00:26:52,537
She's been staying
at her sister's house

663
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:53,538
up on Hilltop Lane.

664
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:54,539
You got to go to her.

665
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:55,707
I-I think she made it
pretty clear

666
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:56,874
she doesn't want to see me.

667
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:59,243
Well, then you have to make her
want to see you.

668
00:26:59,261 --> 00:27:01,713
Come on, Mr. Shue,
y-you don't have a choice.

669
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,415
This is like in the
third act of the movie,

670
00:27:04,433 --> 00:27:05,933
where the heartbroken guy

671
00:27:05,968 --> 00:27:07,719
chases through the crowded
city streets

672
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:10,521
to win his girl back,
and then he does some

673
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:11,773
big romantic gesture,

674
00:27:11,807 --> 00:27:13,558
and the music swells,

675
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,426
and then the crowd applauds,

676
00:27:15,444 --> 00:27:17,779
and their eyes well
up with tears...

677
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:21,065
And then she'll take you back.

678
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,067
That's just the way it works.

I didn't explain because I'm...

00:31:39,161 --> 00:31:41,112
I think we need
to start from scratch.

782
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:45,616
Maybe with a movie
on Friday night?

783
00:31:47,502 --> 00:31:49,537
See if we can get to know
each other

784
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:51,372
all over again.

785
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:55,626
I think that would be nice.

786
00:32:03,518 --> 00:32:05,770
(Will sighs)

787
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,142
Okay, New York
may be disgusting,

788
00:32:21,176 --> 00:32:23,194
especially when it's
covered in gray, nasty snow,

789
00:32:23,228 --> 00:32:25,980
and the people
may be horrible and rude,

790
00:32:26,014 --> 00:32:27,949
and some smelly homeless man

791
00:32:27,983 --> 00:32:29,984
in pee-stained tighty-whities

792
00:32:30,018 --> 00:32:31,619
might have groped me
on the subway,

793
00:32:31,654 --> 00:32:33,154
and <i>then</i> asked me for a dollar,

794
00:32:33,188 --> 00:32:34,822
but I gots to say,

795
00:32:34,856 --> 00:32:36,691
I finally feel like

796
00:32:36,709 --> 00:32:38,626
I have found my people.

797
00:32:38,661 --> 00:32:40,828
Glad that you found
your corner of the sky, Santana.

798
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:42,330
Where are the Hardy Boys?

799
00:32:42,364 --> 00:32:43,498
Investigating the mystery of.

800
00:32:43,532 --> 00:32:44,999
"God, Could You Be
Any More Annoying?"

801
00:32:45,033 --> 00:32:46,167
Kurt and Adam are at NYADA.

802
00:32:46,201 --> 00:32:47,218
And Pablo Escobar?

803
00:32:47,252 --> 00:32:48,636
Did he ever come home?

804
00:32:48,671 --> 00:32:50,037
Brody is in the shower.

805
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,172
Where he will be

806
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:53,541
for the next hour,
scrubbing the drug shame

807
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:55,176
off of his frictionless body.

808
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,479
For the hundredth time, okay, if you
keep making fun of Brody... I'm not.

809
00:32:58,514 --> 00:33:00,565
I mean, I am. Just, not now.

810
00:33:01,717 --> 00:33:03,884
Okay, look,
now that we're alone,

811
00:33:03,902 --> 00:33:05,486
I want to talk to you

812
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:07,855
about what I found
in your bathroom trash can,

813
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:09,741
<i>underneath</i>
<i>the wadded-up tissue paper,</i>

814
00:33:09,775 --> 00:33:11,576
<i>the used cotton swabs</i>
<i>and the soiled acne wipes.</i>

815
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,244
<i>An item which,</i>

816
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:15,863
<i>unless Lady's Hummel's actually</i>
<i>been a lady all these years,</i>

817
00:33:15,897 --> 00:33:17,532
could have only be yours.

818
00:33:17,566 --> 00:33:20,685
I don't know
what you're talking about.

819
00:33:20,719 --> 00:33:24,455
Rachel... you're really not
gonna tell me about the stick?

820
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:28,343
You had no right.

821
00:33:28,377 --> 00:33:30,345
Rachel,

822
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:32,213
I'm your friend,
you can trust me.

823
00:33:32,247 --> 00:33:33,848
Just tell me what's going on.

824
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:35,883
(crying)

825
00:33:37,586 --> 00:33:39,887
Oh, God.

826
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:41,889
You're gonna be okay. It's okay.

827
00:33:41,923 --> 00:33:43,924
(crying)

828
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:46,894
It's gonna be okay.

829
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:48,929
(crying)

830
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:51,899
(school bell ringing)

831
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:53,368
Hey.

832
00:33:53,402 --> 00:33:54,902
What's going on in here?

833
00:33:54,936 --> 00:33:56,571
You wanted to see me?

834
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:59,574
Uh, yes. I wanted to talk to you

835
00:33:59,608 --> 00:34:01,959
about what happened
on Valentine's Day.

836
00:34:01,994 --> 00:34:04,295
(sighs) I lied.

837
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:06,798
I didn't come up with
all that romantic stuff.

838
00:34:06,832 --> 00:34:09,050
Ryder did.
I-I didn't mean to lie.

839
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:12,487
It's just that all this trust
and monogamy... it's new for me.

840
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:15,423
I'm into it.
I just...

841
00:34:15,457 --> 00:34:17,425
I got nervous.

842
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:20,094
I was trying to impress you.

843
00:34:20,128 --> 00:34:22,263
(laughs) So,

844
00:34:22,297 --> 00:34:25,483
I came up with this on my own.

845
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:28,936
This is not what I think it is.
Oh, yes, it is.

846
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,154
(laughs)

847
00:34:30,189 --> 00:34:31,606
Come here, sit down.

848
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,241
I am singing your favorite song

849
00:34:33,275 --> 00:34:34,742
from your favorite
romantic movie.

850
00:34:34,777 --> 00:34:35,993
<i>The Hunger Games?</i>

851
00:34:36,028 --> 00:34:38,279
Second favorite romantic movie?

852
00:34:38,313 --> 00:34:39,864
Okay.

853
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,288

(sighs)

898
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,438
I lied about
Valentine's Day, too.

899
00:37:17,472 --> 00:37:19,473
I knew it was Ryder.

900
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:24,478
But I didn't care because
it was so sweet that you tried.

901
00:37:26,031 --> 00:37:27,915
Ryder kissed me.

902
00:37:30,702 --> 00:37:32,820
And I let him.

903
00:37:34,873 --> 00:37:36,874
Jake.

904
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:41,829
Are you...?

905
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:44,799
Jake? Jake, don't leave.

906
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:55,800
(school bell ringing)
Girls rule, as usual.

907
00:37:55,834 --> 00:37:57,802
And we should win
for these sweet glasses alone.

908
00:37:57,836 --> 00:38:00,037
WILL: Ladies and gentlemen,
the time has come

909
00:38:00,055 --> 00:38:01,756
for the announcement
of this year's

910
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:03,424
mash-off winner.

911
00:38:03,475 --> 00:38:04,258
(whooping)

912
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:05,643
Who of course, will be starring

913
00:38:05,677 --> 00:38:09,013
in my senior film project...
<i>Hollywood Hootenanny,</i>

914
00:38:09,047 --> 00:38:10,815
a tribute to dance on film.

915
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:12,316
WILL:
And the winner is...

916
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:14,051
everyone.

917
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:15,820
What?
Why do you always do this?

918
00:38:15,854 --> 00:38:17,321
That's insane.
This is a sham.

919
00:38:17,356 --> 00:38:19,557
(overlapping chatter,
Brittany grunts loudly)

920
00:38:19,575 --> 00:38:21,776
Why don't you just send Maria
Shriver in to give us all hugs?

921
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:23,327
In reality, what you're saying
is, we're all losers.

922
00:38:23,362 --> 00:38:25,279
Why did we bother having a
competition in the first place?

923
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,115
Calm down, y'all.
Calm down.

924
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:29,834
After exhaustive storyboarding
and pre-production,

925
00:38:29,868 --> 00:38:30,901
I realized that I needed a lot

926
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:32,954
of talented bodies
to make this film great.

927
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:35,239
So, choosing one winner
was just simply impossible.

928
00:38:35,257 --> 00:38:36,624
That is exactly right.

929
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:38,509
Uh, Finn, can I talk to you
in the hallway for a sec?

930
00:38:38,544 --> 00:38:39,677
Ooh! ARTIE: Yeah.

931
00:38:39,711 --> 00:38:40,878
Everybody's gonna in it.

932
00:38:40,912 --> 00:38:42,180
So, who's the lead?
Who's gonna be the lead?

933
00:38:42,214 --> 00:38:43,347
ARTIE: There is no lead...
There's no lead.

934
00:38:43,382 --> 00:38:44,549
Yeah, 'cause there's no point.

935
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,184
(overlapping chatter)

936
00:38:46,218 --> 00:38:48,186
No. You guys are awesome
together. I mean...

937
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,470
We're gonna be the leads.

938
00:38:49,521 --> 00:38:50,638
Yay!
Yay!

939
00:38:50,689 --> 00:38:53,257
(overlapping chatter)

940
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:55,526
Boy meets girl, boy loses girl.

941
00:38:55,561 --> 00:38:57,528
Boy mopes around
and sits on his ass

942
00:38:57,563 --> 00:38:59,564
until his best man
helps save the day.

943
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:01,599
Thank you.

944
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:04,652
Yeah, I-I... I mean, you would
have done the same thing for me.

945
00:39:04,703 --> 00:39:07,371
You have, like,
probably a thousand times.

946
00:39:07,406 --> 00:39:10,608
So, uh, you and Miss Pillsbury
talked it all out?

947
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:12,376
Yeah. I mean,
I actually think

948
00:39:12,411 --> 00:39:14,045
all this craziness
was for the best.

949
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,779
I mean, I actually think

950
00:39:15,797 --> 00:39:17,948
it's going to make our
relationship stronger.

951
00:39:17,966 --> 00:39:19,950
She say anything about me?

952
00:39:19,968 --> 00:39:22,003
No. Why would she?

953
00:39:22,054 --> 00:39:24,055
Because I kissed her.

954
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:28,059
Well, she...

955
00:39:28,093 --> 00:39:30,928
she was freaking out about the
wedding, and going all AC/DC,

956
00:39:30,962 --> 00:39:33,731
and I-I tried to calm her down.

957
00:39:33,765 --> 00:39:35,900
And then I just... I kissed her.

958
00:39:35,934 --> 00:39:37,068
But I didn't mean to

959
00:39:37,102 --> 00:39:38,903
because I don't even
think of her like that.

960
00:39:38,937 --> 00:39:41,355
I swear.

961
00:39:41,406 --> 00:39:43,357
And I tried to tell you,
but I couldn't,

962
00:39:43,408 --> 00:39:45,693
because I knew
that it would ruin

963
00:39:45,744 --> 00:39:48,863
everything, and it's all
my fault, so just...

964
00:39:48,914 --> 00:39:51,532
just go ahead
and just-just punch me,

965
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:54,151
or whatever,
because I deserve it.

966
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,425
I'm so sorry.

967
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:20,111
(sighs heavily)

968
00:40:21,813 --> 00:40:25,066
(school bell ringing)
