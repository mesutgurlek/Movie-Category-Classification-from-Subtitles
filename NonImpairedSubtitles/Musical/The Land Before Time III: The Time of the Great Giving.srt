The Land Before Time III
The Time of the Great Giving

3
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,800
A long time ago,

4
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,601
at least thirty-five hundred
million years ago,

5
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,900
the earliest form of life made
it's first appearance on earth.

6
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,300
These single-celled creatures
developed and grew,

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,500
and changed a million times over.

8
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,400
Until at last, there was a
creature able to leave the sea,

9
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,800
and to crawl out
into an unknown world.

10
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,200
From this long fish-like creature
came hundreds of other animals.

11
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,200
The mightiest of which was called

12
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,200
the Dinosaur.

13
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,900
For most of
the earth's dinosaurs,

14
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,350
life was filled with danger.

15
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,900
But for the fortunate
leaf-eating dinosaurs

16
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:45,000
of the Great Valley,

17
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,300
life was peaceful,

18
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,500
and food plentyful.

19
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,100
The Great Valley was
the perfect place for children

20
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:06,050
like Littlefoot, the longneck,

21
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,700
Cera, the threehorn,
Ducky, the swimmer,

22
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,500
Petrie, the flyer,
and Spike, the spiketail,

23
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,200
to grow and learn and play.

24
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,800
- I got it!
- No, me got it!

25
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,200
Go, Spike.

26
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,300
Did you did it, Spike?
Did you? Huh?

27
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,300
Yep, yep, yep. You got it.

28
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,300
I found an other one.
I found an other one.

29
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,400
Hy, Hyp. Do you hand
my rock back, please?

30
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,450
Your rock? Who said
it was your rock?

31
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:15,301
Yeah, who said
it was your rock, huh?

32
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Who said? Who said?

33
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,800
Oh. Ah. Yeah!

34
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, Gee, no-one, but we
were just playing with it.

35
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:26,101
So give it back, Hyp!

36
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,000
Well, I didn't hear you say:
Please.

37
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:30,101
That's, because I didn't.

38
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,100
Hey, maybe we can
all play, together.

39
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,500
Good idea, Littlefoot.
We all play.

40
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:41,600
Yep, yep, yep,
the more the better.

41
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,300
What do you thing guys?
Wanna play with these... babies?

42
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,500
Babies? Who's he calling babies?

43
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,200
- Us?
- Uh. Me no baby! Me big!

44
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,700
Yeah, big baby!

45
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
- Me no like them.
- Me neither.

46
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:08,650
I'll show 'em!

47
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,100
- Cera!
- I'm busy!

48
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,400
- Come, and get us!
- Yeah, try!

49
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,700
Whow. What's that?

50
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,500
- Its' a...
- Earthshake!

51
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,000
- Rocks flying?!
- Flying rocks!

52
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,200
- Daddy!
- Mama!

53
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,000
Grandma! Grandpa!

54
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,900
Fly children! Fly!

55
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Run!

56
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,300
Littlefoot!

57
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,600
Look out!

58
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,400
- Littlefoot.
- I'm in here, Grandma.

59
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,600
Are you all right, little one?

60
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,100
Would you like to come out now?

61
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,550
Shee, that wasn't a regular
kind earthshake, was it?

62
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,700
No, Littlefoot, it wasn't.

63
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,700
- Than what kind was it?
- We don't know, Littlefoot.

64
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,400
Perhaps it had to do
with those great rocks,

65
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,250
falling from the sky.

66
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,500
Oh, yeah. I saw 'em.
And I saw that big one,

67
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:56,650
landing somewhere
in the mysterious beyond.

68
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,600
I sure wish
we could go find it.

69
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,600
Yes, that would be an
adventure now, wouldn't it?

70
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:05,650
Well, I think we've had enough
adventure for one day.

71
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,500
Come. It's time to settle
down for the night.

72
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,000
It's beautiful,
isn't it, Grandpa?

73
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,850
Oh, yes, Littlefoot.
Beautiful.

74
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,500
And mysterious.
As is so much in our world.

75
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,100
Well, at least
that danger has passed.

76
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,500
- Huh, what? - Look, everyone!
Where did the water go?

77
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,200
- It stopped flowing.
- How can that be?

78
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:15,350
What will we do without water?

79
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,100
Grandpa? Why did the
Thundering Falls just stop?

80
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,200
I don't know, Littlefoot.
I don't know.

81
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,400
Littlefoot, go and play.

82
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,550
Grandpa and I must talk
with the other grown-ups.

83
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,900
Sure, Grandma.

84
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,500
- See you later, Grandpa.
- This's never happened before.

85
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,600
Hey guys!

86
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,100
Guess, what happened
to the Thundering Falls!

87
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Sss! We are trying to find Cera.
She has hided from us.

88
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,500
- But...
- Me no find Cera anywhere.

89
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,700
- Guess, what, Petrie!
- What? You no find Cera either?

90
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,200
Cera is a very good hider.
She is.

91
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,500
I scared you!
I scared you! I did!

92
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,200
You no scared me, Cera.
Me unscareable!

93
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,400
Peatrie, you are rubbing my nose.

94
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:28,950
Oh, huhuh, sorry.
Me no know my own strength.

95
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,400
Now who is going to hide?
Littlefoot?

96
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,700
Okey, but first
I wanna tell you something.

97
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:39,550
Well, hurry it up!
We wanna play!

98
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,800
I saw a... hey!

99
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,400
Spike is taking your term
for you, Littlefoot.

100
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,100
My brother is not
a very good hider, oh no.

101
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,000
Now, just what were you
gonna say, Littlefoot?

102
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,650
It's the Thundering Falls!

103
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,100
It's not giving us any water!
You gotta come see!

104
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,500
Why don't you hatchlings
go run and see?

105
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:19,500
Yeah, run and see!
Run and see!

106
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,400
Oh! Aa... yeah!

107
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,300
- Try and make us!
- No, Cera, no!

108
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,200
Oh, don't worry!
I won't hurt them. Much.

109
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,800
Put those away!

110
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,300
How come all you ever
want to do is fight, Hyp?

111
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,601
Yeah, fight.

112
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,200
Ouh. Fighting hurt.

113
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,300
Yeah. It does give you aue-s,
Hyp. Why do we do it?

114
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,200
Why? Why?
Because we are bigger!

115
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:07,200
And bigger's smarter!
Bigger is meaner,

116
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:09,851
and bigger is better!

117
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,300
When you're big, you can push
all the little ones around,

118
00:12:20,301 --> 00:12:25,350
they're looking up,
while you are looking down.

119
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,100
You can snap a tree in two,
like it's just a twig.

120
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,101
Things are better,
when you're big.

121
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:40,200
When you're big, you can do
anything you wanna do.

122
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:45,450
All the rules the grown-ups make,
they don't apply to you.

123
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,400
Just smashing on the puddles,
gop and slurp and swig

124
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,101
the world is wider,
when you're big.

125
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,100
You can snort, you can grunt.
You can stock, you can haul.

126
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,950
You can bug someone smaller
on the head.

127
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,400
On the head.

128
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,400
You can take, what you want.
Lay all day in the swamp.

129
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,601
And you never ever
have to go to bed.

130
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,500
When you're big, you can step
on little peoples toes,

131
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,601
lunch on their lunch,
bump them in the nose.

132
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,400
Threehorns and longnecks,
and duckfeet too.

133
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,300
They all have to do
anything you want'em to.

134
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,501
And if they don't, you can
plumb them in the gue.

135
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,100
Don't you forget,
what you want you get.

136
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,650
Things are better,
when you're big.

137
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,300
When you're big.

138
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,500
When you're big.

139
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:07,700
When you're big.

140
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,700
But Hyp, when you're a grown-up,
you won't be very big at all.

141
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,800
Yeah! Your kind
never gets very big.

142
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:22,350
When we grow up,
we'll be much bigger.

143
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,000
Aha. Aha,
much-much-much-much bigger!

144
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh, yeah? Well I'm gonna see
to it, that you never grow up.

145
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,100
- Oh, yeah!
- Never grow up, never.

146
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,000
How are we gonna do that, Hyp?

147
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,200
Shee, is he dumb.
Let me lay it out for you.

148
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:45,700
First we chase 'em,
second we catch 'em,

149
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:48,300
third we hurt 'em! See?

150
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,500
No Hyp. I don't see.

151
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,100
- Anybody. - Me neither.
- What?

152
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,400
Come on, haul 'em later.

153
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,800
As you can all see,
our valley is quickly drying up.

154
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,200
Yes. We see it,
and feel it as well.

155
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:23,150
There is less and less
water to drink.

156
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,100
And green food to eat.

157
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,400
I know. That is why our herds
must work together.

158
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:33,000
To save the little water
we have left.

159
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,000
From now on, we must drink only
what we need to survive.

160
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,150
And no more.

161
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,600
Hopefully soon the Thundering
Falls will bring us water again.

162
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,200
If not, we may have to
leave the Great Valley.

163
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,700
- Leave the Great Valley?
- Never! - It's our home!

164
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,700
Than, until the water returns,

165
00:15:56,701 --> 00:16:01,550
we must not use the water
we have left unwisely.

166
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,700
Threehorns never use water
unwisely. But your herds do!

167
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,200
Our herds? What makes you think,
our herds would do such a thing?

168
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,500
You drink greedily
with no concern for others.

169
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,300
Can you believe
he is saying that?

170
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,300
- Well, I've seen threehorns
waste. - What?

171
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:28,750
You take long baths, even if
you are the least bit dirty.

172
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,600
And, I've seen
your kind waste, too.

173
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:34,001
Splashing water
needlessly, for shame.

174
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,600
Impossible!
I never did such a thing!

175
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,800
Hey! Let's play bullies!
I'll be Hyp!

176
00:16:55,801 --> 00:17:00,750
- I'm gonna get you!
- Not, if I get you first!

177
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,000
Me wanna play bullies too!

178
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,201
Hey, hatchling,
you no eat my green-food!

179
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,300
Me go play bullies
someplace else.

180
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,500
Petrie! You're a flyer,
not a swimmer!

181
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,000
Me no bully either.

182
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,500
But I am!

183
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,400
- Not again!
- Oh, no-no-no-no-noooo!

184
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,200
It them!

185
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,500
That you hatchlings keep playing
in our swimming hole, huh?

186
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,201
They're beginning
to get on my nerves.

187
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,600
Can we teach'em a lesson, Hyp?
Huh? Can we, huh?

188
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:01,450
Be my guest, Nod!

189
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,100
Run!

190
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,500
- See ya!
- Wouldn't wanna be ya!

191
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,900
This is not funny!

192
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,850
Now someone splashed me,
and wasted precious water.

193
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,400
Littlefoot, are you all right?

194
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,601
Aha. But I think I'm in trouble.

195
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,900
Your Littlefoot is guilty
of wasting water.

196
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,000
What happened, Littlefoot?

197
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:48,001
It was an accident,
Grandpa! Honest!

198
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
I'm sure, it was, Littlefoot.

199
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,500
Our children don't understand
the water problem,

200
00:18:56,501 --> 00:19:00,400
the Great Valley has always
given them everything they need.

201
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,150
What are those grown-ups
talking about?

202
00:19:02,151 --> 00:19:06,701
What water problem? Isn't the
Thundering Falls coming back?

203
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't know.

204
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:10,750
Well, it should!
Why wouldn't it?

205
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,900
Maybe it is tired
and needs to rest.

206
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,800
We need to
teach our children,

207
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:21,650
how to use
the remaining water wisely.

208
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,800
Speak for yourself, longneck!

209
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,800
My Cera would never waste!

210
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:29,050
Your Littlefoot
is a bad influence!

211
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,100
That's not true!

212
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,700
- What is influmance?
- Me no know.

213
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Come, Cera!

214
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:41,600
You're not to play with the
little longneck any more.

215
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,000
But, Daddy!

216
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,400
My friend.
I think you're acting rushly.

217
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:51,850
Littlefoot is not to blame.

218
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,500
- I said, come Cera!
- No!

219
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
Cera, I'm your father.

220
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:01,400
And I know,
what's best for you.

221
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:22,700
- Petrie, it's time to go home!
- Bye-bye! Coming, Mama!

222
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,700
Come Ducky, Spike, you too!

223
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,450
Do not worry, Littlefoot!

224
00:20:28,451 --> 00:20:33,250
You're not an influmance,
whatever that is.

225
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,400
I don't understand, Grandpa. Why
does Cera's dad think I'm bad?

226
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,350
Oh, he is just confused,
Littlefoot.

227
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,400
Sometimes fear makes
grown-ups do strange things.

228
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,850
I don't understand, Daddy!

229
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,900
You need friends, who know
how to behave.

230
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:05,751
Especially in times like this.

231
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,800
Littlefoot is my friend!
He'll always be my friend!

232
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,000
- Cera, I'm your father!
I want, what's best for you!

233
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,000
No, you don't! You just
don't want me to have any fun!

234
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,900
Cera, please. I'm just
trying to... as a parent I...

235
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,500
Time to wake up, my little one.

236
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,800
Grandma! It's early.
I'm still sleepy.

237
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,500
You must get up, Littlefoot!

238
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:51,550
If you want to drink
the morning dew with us.

239
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,000
The morning dew?

240
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,700
Yes. It collects on the leeves
in the early morning.

241
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,900
If we hurry,
we can drink the dew,

242
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:05,800
before the bright circle gets
too high in the sky

243
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:07,851
and dries it all up.

244
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,300
All right.

245
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,650
Here, Littlefoot,
drink this.

246
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:25,250
I think,
you'll find it delicious.

247
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,100
Ups! It broke!

248
00:22:34,101 --> 00:22:36,300
It's not your fault, Littlefoot.

249
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:41,000
The treestars are very dry now,
and crumble easily.

250
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,900
But when will everything be green
and wet again, Grandma?

251
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,801
I don't know.
I hope, soon.

252
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,200
But what's going to happen,
if it's not soon?

253
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,500
Water will get
harder and harder to find.

254
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:05,800
Soon, everything will be
as dry as that treestar.

255
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,700
- And it will be easier for fires
to start. - Fire?

256
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,500
Yes, Littlefoot. Which is why

257
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:16,050
you must remember the
escape paths, we've shown you.

258
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,500
Don't worry, Grandma.
I'll remember.

259
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,600
I think, we're in luck.

260
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,200
There is still quite a few
green treestars left here.

261
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:33,050
Come on, then! Let's eat!

262
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,100
Yeah, let's eat!

263
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,000
These don't look too good.
But I sure am hungry.

264
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
They taste terrible!

265
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,100
Here, Littlefoot. Try these!
They're still very green.

266
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,350
- Thanks, Grandpa!
- Go on, Littlefoot. Eat up!

267
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:28,250
But, but what about you?
Don't you want some?

268
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,200
Thank you, Littlefoot.
But Grandpa and I will be fine.

269
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,650
Yes. You're still growing,

270
00:25:34,651 --> 00:25:39,250
you need the very best
green food, we can find.

271
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,500
Well, okey.

272
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,300
That was good!
But sure I am thirsty.

273
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:56,850
When is it our turn for water?

274
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,400
Our turn for water

275
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:05,750
is when the bright circle
touches the Smoking Mountain.

276
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,600
But if you're thirsty,
I think you can have a drink now.

277
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,300
After all, we never agreed

278
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:14,500
that the children should have

279
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:17,450
the same water restrictions
as the elders.

280
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,700
Oh, boy! Water!

281
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,300
It's not your time to drink,
longnecks!

282
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,200
What do you mean,
not our time?

283
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,650
We agreed, that all herds
must take terms

284
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:36,850
drinking at the watering hole.

285
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,200
Yes, we all agreed,
but I didn't think,

286
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:43,450
that it included the children.
It really isn't fair to them.

287
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,800
There is no fair,
when it comes to survival.

288
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,000
When life is tough,
you got to be tougher,

289
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:04,250
if you wanna stay alive!

290
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,300
When the trail gets rough,
you got to get rougher,

291
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:11,450
to help your family survive.

292
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:18,800
You can run around in circles,
wondering what to do.

293
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,700
Someone's got to be
the boys a reason,

294
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:25,950
is it you, or you, or you?

295
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,600
When things around us
are going bad,

296
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:33,250
we all better be strong.

297
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,800
We could loose
everything we've had,

298
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:40,450
if this goes on too long.

299
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:47,200
Don't stand around here talking!
I say, that's not enough!

300
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,900
No tears, no sighs,
don't close your eyes!

301
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,500
We got to stand tough!

302
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:06,000
I used to hear my father say:
Stand and fight, don't run away!

303
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,700
He made me, what I am today,
I'm here!

304
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,600
And I'm tough!

305
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
When times are hard,
you better be harder,

306
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,150
you don't know
what's in store.

307
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,150
You think, you're smart?

308
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:30,150
You got to be smarter,
than you ever were before.

309
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,300
You say, I'm mean,
you say, if I bother,

310
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:38,350
but I have a daughter
and I'm her father.

311
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,600
I'm gonna make sure,
we all have water enough.

312
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
That's why I'm tough!

313
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,400
I'm standing tough!

314
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
We got to stand tough!

315
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,700
You don't like it? Tough!

316
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,900
Littlefoot! Over here!

317
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,500
You judge us wrongly, threehorn.

318
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:23,250
I'm only doing,
what needs to be done.

319
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,200
But this is going too far!

320
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,550
What are we gonna do
about the grown-ups, Littlefoot?

321
00:29:28,551 --> 00:29:32,350
- They're acting like babies!
- I know.

322
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,250
And it's all the
Thundering Falls's fault, too.

323
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:38,750
If we had more water,
this wouldn't be happening.

324
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,200
- That's it, Cera!
- What's it?

325
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,350
Water!
If we find some,

326
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:45,850
the grown-ups will stop
being mad.

327
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,300
Maybe. Except for my Dad.
He is always mad.

328
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,200
Yeah. He is kind'a grumpy.

329
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,900
But I'm sure it's just because
he is so worried about the water.

330
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,750
Yeah. Anyway, let's go get
Petrie, Ducky and Spike

331
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:05,850
and find some water.

332
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,400
- How about a compromise?
- No. We must be firm.

333
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:13,650
Can't we agree on anything?

334
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,500
- Are we all here?
- Yep-yep-yep. Here. All here.

335
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,000
Oh, no. We are not.
Where is Spike?

336
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,400
Well, don't ask me!
He is not my brother.

337
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,100
Oh, Spike! Where are you,
little brother?

338
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,000
What that?
It sound like monster.

339
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,600
Do not worry, Petrie!

340
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:53,601
That is not a monster!
That is Spike!

341
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,900
Spike?

342
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,600
That is his sleeping sound.
Come on, I'll show you.

343
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,200
See?

344
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,900
You are right, Ducky.

345
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,100
Get up, silly. This is not
nap-time. This is get up-time.

346
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,600
You wake up now, okey Spike?

347
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,000
Huh! Spike up!

348
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,800
Spike down.

349
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,100
Spike, no!

350
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:47,100
- Are you okey, Petrie?
- Aha. Spike sure heavy sleeper.

351
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,100
We gotta wake him up,

352
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:56,250
because it's gonna take
all of us to find more water.

353
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,500
Water? Yes!
Me help find water!

354
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,700
Spike, stop!
Me no find water yet.

355
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,300
Don't worry, Spike!
We find it, I just know we will.

356
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,100
We'd better!
Because if our parents

357
00:32:13,101 --> 00:32:17,100
stay mad any longer,
I'm just gonna scream!

358
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
- Oh, I will scream too!
- Petrie good screamer!

359
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,300
What about you, Spike?

360
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,200
- How we find water, Littlefoot?
- We smell for it, silly.

361
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:57,100
Oh, yes! Smell for it,
with our noses.

362
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
I know how to do that.

363
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,200
No smell so hard,
okey, Spike?

364
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:32,300
- This is serious, Ducky.
- Oh, yes, Cera. I know. I know.

365
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,600
It's not your turn!

366
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,500
Go on!

367
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,200
My sniffer is
very-very sniffed out.

368
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:38,250
Well, I'm so thirsty,
I could drink a lake.

369
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Me too,
if we could find one.

370
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,600
Funny. Me smell water,
but me no see water.

371
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:59,500
- Did you hear a...a splash?
- Aha. - Water!

372
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,400
That is so good!

373
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,500
Oh, yes. This is the
yummiest water ever. It is!

374
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,500
And we drink all we want,
no-one yelling us.

375
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,900
There they are. And would you
look, what they've found for us.

376
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,350
What is it?

377
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,300
Hi, ya, hatchlings.
Say bye-bye, water.

378
00:35:53,301 --> 00:35:56,601
Why?
Is it going somewhere?

379
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,350
No, but you are!

380
00:35:58,351 --> 00:36:02,350
- This is our water now!
- So give it back!

381
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,600
Give back?
But it already in my tummy.

382
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:07,750
But do you not want to share?

383
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,300
- We don't share with anybody.
Do we? - No, not. - Nobody.

384
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,000
So I'm warning you,
small fries,

385
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:17,000
if you tell anybody else
about this water,

386
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:20,750
you'll be very-very sorry!

387
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,100
We are telling. And you
better not try to stop us!

388
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,900
Hurry!

389
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,600
Hurry! Can't let them tell!

390
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,450
What am I running for?

391
00:36:38,451 --> 00:36:42,850
I'm not afraid of those.
Hey! What's the big idea?

392
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,800
No time to fight bully, Cera.
We go tell grown-ups about water.

393
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,000
Where'd they go, Hyp, huh?
Where'd they go?

394
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:54,750
If I knew,
I wouldn't be looking for 'em.

395
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
- Yeah!
- Yeah, dummy!

396
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,100
Aaaa!

397
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,500
Keep running!

398
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,900
Are they still after us?

399
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,350
Me no know.
Me too scared to look.

400
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,800
Spike, you're going
the wrong way!

401
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,200
Hurray! Now you're
on the right way!

402
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,300
Why are we going this way
anyway, Littlefoot?

403
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,350
We're tired,
and this way is hard!

404
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,700
Because this is the shortest
way back to the grown-ups.

405
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:51,750
And it will be harder
for the bullies to follow us.

406
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,500
It is the
mysterious beyond!

407
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,650
And it have water!
Whole bunches!

408
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,800
The flying rocks must have
caused slides

409
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:43,450
in the mysterious beyond too.

410
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,300
Yeah! And those dumb
slides blocked our barwater.

411
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,900
Come on! The grown-ups
will know what to do.

412
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,000
Bad weather for flying.

413
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,500
Lookout!

414
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,800
Not this way!
I know an other path.

415
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,900
That's enough. You've had
your share for today.

416
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,200
- The threehorn is getting
far too bossy. - I agree.

417
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,300
- Grandpa! Grandma!
- Daddy!

418
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,600
Fire!
There's fire in the valley!

419
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:12,250
Are you sure,
Littlefoot?

420
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Yes, Grandpa.
It's near to border pass.

421
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,200
Yes, we can see
the fire signs from here.

422
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,300
The border pass?

423
00:40:21,301 --> 00:40:24,050
- That's close to here.
- We must run.

424
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,700
Calm yourselves.
We will lead you to safety.

425
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,400
No, I will. We will be
better off, following me.

426
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,300
This way!
Come!

427
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,400
But you're heading
down-wind,

428
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:45,950
where the fire
will surely spread.

429
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,600
We must go
up-wind of the fire.

430
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,000
Do as you will,
longneck,

431
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:53,350
but Cera and I go
this way. Come, Cera.

432
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,300
But Daddy!

433
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:55,850
The others can do
what they want,

434
00:40:55,851 --> 00:41:00,000
but you are my daughter,
and you'll do as I say.

435
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:10,500
I'm... 'm...
I'm going with my father.

436
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,700
I do not feel good about this.
Oh, no. I do not.

437
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,000
Grandma! Grandpa!
Can't you stop them?

438
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,800
I have to go after 'em!

439
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:28,400
Yes. Littlefoot,
you come with me.

440
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:30,850
We'll lead the others
to safety.

441
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,100
But what about everybody
else in the valley, Grandma?

442
00:41:33,101 --> 00:41:35,350
What will happen
to them?

443
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,100
They'll use the escape routes
closest to them. Now come.

444
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,900
Everyone! Follow me!
Children first!

445
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,300
Cera!

446
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,000
Grandma!
What's wrong?

447
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:46,850
The smoke is too thick.
You'll have to lead.

448
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
But I...

449
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,400
Follow me, everyone!

450
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,400
- Where is he?
- I can't see!

451
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:15,400
Littlefoot! The grown-ups cannot
see good. They cannot.

452
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,300
They can hear.
Follow my voice!

453
00:43:18,301 --> 00:43:21,150
Stay close to the one
in front of you!

454
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,300
Keep you heads down,
it's not much further.

455
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,400
- Are you sure, this is right,
Daddy? - Of course I'm sure!

456
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,500
- Daddy!
- This way, Cera!

457
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,700
We're trapped!

458
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,400
Threehorns! Over here!

459
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Hurry, Cera!

460
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,000
- Are you all right, Cera?
- Yes, Daddy.

461
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,700
Come!

462
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,900
Grandpa!

463
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:24,600
- They made it! I was so worried!
- I'm fine, dear, really.

464
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,800
How is everyone else?

465
00:45:29,801 --> 00:45:35,050
Our group got here safely.
Thanks to Littlefoot.

466
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,600
Oh, yes.
Thanks to Littlefoot.

467
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,700
We are all very lucky.

468
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:47,450
Lucky? How can you say we are
lucky, when our valley burns?

469
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,500
We are without water,
and now we are without a home.

470
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,600
All is lost.

471
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,800
All is not lost, my friend.

472
00:45:57,801 --> 00:46:02,050
You still have Cera.
And you are still here.

473
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,800
Able to care for her.

474
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,400
Well, you are right.
Thank you longneck.

475
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,800
But the threehorn
speaks the truth.

476
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:14,350
We don't.

477
00:46:14,351 --> 00:46:17,150
We'll never be able to go back
to the Great Valley.

478
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,600
Never go back to the
Great Valley? Oh, no!

479
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,300
The water! We forgot
to tell them about the water!

480
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,900
Grandma! Grandpa!
We found water!

481
00:46:28,901 --> 00:46:32,150
- Water?
- Where, Littlefoot?

482
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,400
- It's stuck!
- Behind the Thundering Falls.

483
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,600
- The flying rocks did it.
- They did.

484
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:43,200
Which means, the water is trapped
in the mysterious beyond.

485
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,550
The mysterious beyond.

486
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,650
- We can't go there!
- It's dangerous!

487
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,900
Of course it's dangerous!

488
00:46:48,901 --> 00:46:53,450
But no place is safe now.
We must go and free the water!

489
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,800
But such a huge
gathering place of water

490
00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:58,850
will attract other creatures
besides ourselves.

491
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,500
In the mysterious beyond,
there'll be sharp-teeth.

492
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,400
Sharp-teeth?!

493
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,300
I do not like sharp-teeth.
Oh, no!

494
00:47:08,301 --> 00:47:11,550
Their teeth are too sharp.

495
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,200
Still, we must do something!

496
00:47:13,201 --> 00:47:16,450
We must come up with a plan
to free the water!

497
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,500
I have a plan!

498
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:21,250
I hope it's better than
your fire-escape plan.

499
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,000
Please!
This is no time to argue.

500
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:27,550
At least I had a plan!

501
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,000
Stop!
You're acting like children!

502
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,550
We no act like that!

503
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,100
- I have a plan, too.
- Mine's better.

504
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,750
I sure would like to
get to that water first,

505
00:47:41,751 --> 00:47:45,150
before the rest of those
dummies go slubbering in it.

506
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,600
But you heard the
grown-ups, Hyp.

507
00:47:47,601 --> 00:47:50,850
- What about sharp-teeth?
- What about them?

508
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,500
You tell'm, Mutt!

509
00:47:53,501 --> 00:48:00,800
Well, they're bad. Yeah!
And scary too.

510
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,400
Come on! You are
just as afraid as we are!

511
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:07,050
Me?
I'm not afraid of anything.

512
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,000
- Bet, you are!
- Bet, I'm not!

513
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:12,100
You were afraid of
those big flying rocks!

514
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,100
I was not! I just ran,
because you guys did.

515
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:18,500
I... I dind't want
you to feel stupid.

516
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,600
Well, than prove it!

517
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,100
All right, I will! I'll get me
some tasty water,

518
00:48:25,101 --> 00:48:27,700
and you babies
can stay here!

519
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,100
- I'm not a baby!
- Me neither!

520
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,400
- Hyp! Wait!
- Ah, yeah. For us!

521
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:42,400
- We must act now!
- We must not act rushly.

522
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,750
They are so dumb!

523
00:48:44,751 --> 00:48:47,700
Didn't they hear what the
grown-ups said about sharp-teeth?

524
00:48:47,701 --> 00:48:49,400
I guess not.

525
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,300
Well if they get eaten,
it'll just serve them right.

526
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:59,600
- Cera! That is not nice!
- I don't care! They deserve it!

527
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,100
I don't know, you guys,
maybe we should do something.

528
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:04,900
Like what?

529
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,900
Like... tell their parents
where they went?

530
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:11,450
All of our parents 're
too busy arguing.

531
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,700
Your plan is too dangerous.

532
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:17,250
- Yours is no better!
- Then listen to mine!

533
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,600
Yours? Don't be silly!

534
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,600
Then... maybe
we should go stop them!

535
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:24,000
- Stop them?
- Us?

536
00:49:24,001 --> 00:49:27,450
They hate us.
They will not listen.

537
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,700
- I know, they're bigger.
- But definitely not smarter!

538
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,100
- Still we have to try!
- But why?

539
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,700
They have feelings,
just like we do.

540
00:49:38,701 --> 00:49:41,550
They have problems too.

541
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:47,500
We think, because they're big,
they don't. But they do.

542
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,100
They're louder
and they're stronger,

543
00:49:50,101 --> 00:49:53,400
and they make a bigger foss.

544
00:49:53,401 --> 00:49:57,850
But way down deep inside,
I think,

545
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,800
They're kids like us.

546
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,500
They have parents just like ours
who tell them what to do.

547
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:17,500
They have feet and tails and
horns and skins and noses too.

548
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,700
And when the earth is shaking,
they run and hide, because

549
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:32,100
even if the think they're tough,
they're still kids like us.

550
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,600
It's just too dangerous,
Littlefoot.

551
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:37,350
Yes, it is.

552
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,400
- And the're too mean.
- Very, very mean!

553
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:47,700
Maybe when you're bigger,
you think you should pretend,

554
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,300
you're not afraid
of scary things,

555
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:53,550
that you
don't need a friend.

556
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:59,900
But they're just kids in trouble.
They need some-one to trust.

557
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:05,500
If we can't bring them home,
show them they're not alone.

558
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:09,650
That they're just kids.

559
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:16,200
Kids like us.

560
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,500
I just have to try
and stop'em.

561
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,100
You guys do what you want.

562
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,300
Last one to go is a scary egg!

563
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,400
Me no scary egg!

564
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:35,300
Wait for us!
We're not scary eggs either!

565
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,400
Are you sure, this is the
right way to the water, Hyp?

566
00:51:57,401 --> 00:51:59,350
Sure I'm sure!

567
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,100
I'm just taking us
this special way.

568
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:05,550
So we don't run into
any stupid sharp-teeth.

569
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,300
Wait for me!

570
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,900
Come on, guys! Wait!

571
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,000
Stop whining, Mutt!
This is easy!

572
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,500
Well, what do you know?

573
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:41,750
A little watering hole.
Just for me!

574
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,700
You guys can have some.
If I leave any.

575
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,400
Huh-uh! Water!

576
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,300
I'm sinking! I'm sinking!

577
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,850
Don't you stand there,
pull me out!

578
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,300
- Oh, yeah!
- Right. What do we do?

579
00:53:05,301 --> 00:53:08,350
I don't know.
What do you think we should do?

580
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,000
Somebody do something!
Help! Help!

581
00:53:12,001 --> 00:53:13,750
That's Hyp!

582
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,100
Get me out!
Get me out!

583
00:53:17,101 --> 00:53:19,650
- You pull him out!
- What if I get stuck?

584
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,600
- Then I'll pull you out, okey?
- What if you get stuck..

585
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,700
He's stuck in a tarpit.

586
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:27,550
Stop moving Hyp! It will
only make you sink faster.

587
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,300
We'll have to pull him out.
Everybody line up!

588
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,200
Okey. When me say pull.

589
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,600
- Hey! You're squitching me!
- I'm sorry.

590
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,200
Petrie! Pull!

591
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,400
Are you, are you okey, Hyp?
Are you?

592
00:54:00,401 --> 00:54:05,050
Of course I'm okey.
I was never not okey.

593
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,800
He big fat fibber.

594
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:10,550
Yeah! We helped you
and you know it!

595
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,600
I don't need anybody's help!
Not now, not ever!

596
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:21,200
But everyone needs
help some time! They do.

597
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,700
Help!

598
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,400
There they are!

599
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,000
Littlefoot.
This is no time to go exploring.

600
00:54:39,001 --> 00:54:43,950
Didn't you realise you wandered
into the mysterious beyond?

601
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,400
We weren't exploring, Grandpa!

602
00:54:45,401 --> 00:54:47,300
We were trying to
stop the bullies...

603
00:54:47,301 --> 00:54:49,650
I... I mean
Hyp and his friends,

604
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,900
or they might've got hurt.

605
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,500
Hyp. Here we are
chasing after you,

606
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,600
when we should be finding a way
to free the water.

607
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,000
I thought I told you
to stay where it was safe!

608
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,500
Don't look at me that way!

609
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:10,950
I'm your father and
I know what's best for you.

610
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,400
Yelling is no way to teach
your child what is right,

611
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:20,050
or to show that you care.

612
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,500
- How would you know?
- I know, because...

613
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,400
because I have a daughter,
and I yell at her too much.

614
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,900
Especially when
I'm worried for her safety.

615
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,300
You don't have to worry about me,
Daddy.

616
00:55:35,301 --> 00:55:40,650
If you always react with anger,
that's all, your son will know.

617
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:44,700
And that's all, he'll be
able to express to others.

618
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,400
What?

619
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,400
I know now, that we can't
live together that way.

620
00:55:53,401 --> 00:55:55,850
With such anger
between us.

621
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,700
Our kids found water,
because they worked together.

622
00:55:58,701 --> 00:56:02,050
Now we must
work together, too.

623
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,200
At last, we all agree.

624
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,800
What's the matter with you?

625
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,600
Nothing.
Except I think we're in trouble.

626
00:56:13,601 --> 00:56:16,850
Yeah.
So what else is new?

627
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,700
That!

628
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,500
And that!

629
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,200
Children! Stay behind me!

630
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,200
- And me!
- Gonna stay too.

631
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,000
Littlefoot! You and your friends,
run to safety!

632
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,000
Trough here, kids!
Follow me!

633
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,200
- Grandpa!
- Don't look back! Come on!

634
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,000
We can't let them pass!

635
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,200
They've gone
after the children!

636
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,700
Stay close!
We're going to get home!

637
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,300
Stop, where you are,
sharp-teeth!

638
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,000
- They're leaving!
- Yes, but why?

639
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,500
Something bad is
happening up there.

640
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,700
Stop, you babies!

641
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,700
Me first!

642
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,900
Look!

643
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,000
- Oh, no! Daddy!
- Grandpa!

644
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,900
You kids get to the top
of that dam, where it's safer.

645
00:59:33,901 --> 00:59:36,150
But what about
the grown-ups?

646
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,700
Just get out of here!
I'll handle this!

647
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,000
Come on!

648
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,400
Why's your dad
risking his neck.

649
00:59:57,401 --> 01:00:01,000
- Yeah, what a dumb!
- He is not!

650
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,300
Dad!

651
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:07,400
- Na-na! Can't get me!
- Son?

652
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,900
The grown-ups are all right!

653
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,700
I'm out of here!

654
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,300
That serve sharp-tooth right.

655
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,700
- He bigger bully than you.
- Hey, watch it!

656
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,200
Come on!
Let's get on'em more rocks!

657
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,100
Are you nuts?
By the time you punch that,

658
01:00:52,101 --> 01:00:55,800
those sharp-teeth would be
picking the teeth with our toes.

659
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,900
We got to try.

660
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,500
Move over, hatchlings.

661
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,800
This isn't gonna work.

662
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,300
Hyp!

663
01:01:10,301 --> 01:01:13,850
Forget him, Littlefoot!
He is a creep.

664
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,600
Who are you calling,
mate?

665
01:01:15,601 --> 01:01:19,450
Get in there and help,
you creeps.

666
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,100
Okey, everybody!
Let's get them!

667
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,700
We did it!

668
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,900
Leave our children alone!

669
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,500
We've got to stop the fighting!

670
01:01:41,501 --> 01:01:45,400
Then let's squash those
sharp-teeth once and for all.

671
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:57,700
Look! Water!
We've unlocked the water!

672
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,100
Run!

673
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,000
Looks like you and your friends
saved the day, Littlefoot.

674
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,400
I think, we all did,
Grandpa.

675
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,800
Spike likes you now.
He does.

676
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,300
And so,
with the return of the water,

677
01:03:19,301 --> 01:03:25,250
the Great Valley dinosaurs
were able to go home again.

678
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:40,300
But the home they returned to,
wasn't the same.

679
01:03:40,301 --> 01:03:45,650
Fire had destroyed
much of their green food.

680
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,200
But instead of
giving into despair,

681
01:03:56,201 --> 01:04:00,150
the dinosaurs divided into
groups, to find the spots,

682
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:04,400
where green food still grew.

683
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,200
Hey, everybody!
We found more!

684
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:19,100
Did you hear that?
More green food!

685
01:04:19,101 --> 01:04:20,850
How wonderful!

686
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,600
Where?
I mean...Where, son?

687
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,700
Over the canyon.
Not far from here, Pap.

688
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,901
If we share, this should
be enough for everyone.

689
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,600
Are you feeling okey, Hyp?
You're talking about sharing.

690
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Oh, yeah, sharing.

691
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:42,200
I know that.
Not sharing is for scary eggs.

692
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,400
Right?

693
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,100
Right!

694
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,300
Sharing is good.
Yep-yep-yep!

695
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,800
Come on.
Everybody follow us!

696
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,400
And so, as it turned out,

697
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:11,201
the dinosaurs travelled
from green spot to green spot.

698
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,800
Eating their fill,

699
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,100
Each helping the others
to find what they needed.

700
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,600
Each learning
the special kind of joy,

701
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:26,200
which comes from
giving to others.

702
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,300
And in the years to come,

703
01:05:54,301 --> 01:06:00,001
this story of sharing
was told over and over again.

704
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,400
Until it became known, as

705
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,600
The Time of the Great Giving
