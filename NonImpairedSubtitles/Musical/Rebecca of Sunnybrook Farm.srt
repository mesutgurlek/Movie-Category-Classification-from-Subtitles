1
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,842
# Happy ending #

2
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,245
# With all our troubles behind #

3
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,477
#Happy ending #

4
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,849
# That's what
we're trying to find #

5
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:32,389
# Why didn't Cinderella waver #

6
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,891
# What made her braver #

7
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,464
# She knew the prince
would come and save her #

8
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,862
# Happy ending #

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,991
# The best of wonderful times #

10
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,468
# Always ending #

11
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,697
# Just like in nursery rhymes #

12
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:51,275
# May each thing you pray for #

13
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:55,039
# Bring you joy and laughter #

14
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,376
# Ever after #

15
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:04,184
# Happy ending to you all ##

16
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,425
And now for a very important
announcement.

17
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:10,325
Wednesday night at 8:00
over the Federal Broadcasting
Company's coast-to-coast network...

18
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,297
the Crackly Grain Flakes Company bring you
something new in entertainment...

19
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:17,995
tomorrow's sensation of the airwaves,
Little Miss America.

20
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:22,403
# You got to eat your spinach, baby #

21
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:26,171
# That's the proper thing to do #

22
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:30,578
# It will keep you
kind of healthy too #

23
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,813
# And what it did for Popeye
it will do for you #

24
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:38,014
# You got to eat your spinach #

25
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,422
Kent, our program
starts next week...

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,188
and you haven't found me
a Little Miss America yet.

27
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,627
I'm beginning to lose faith
in the whole idea.

28
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,199
- Mr. Bartlett, if you'll just be patient...
- Patient? Patient?

29
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,928
Look. Look.
All this advertising.

30
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,096
What I can't understand
is how you had the colossal nerve...

31
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,538
to spread publicity
from coast to coast...

32
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,940
before you found
the right child for the program.

33
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,945
Wait a minute.
You turned down some talented kids...

34
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,675
and some of them were
very successful radio entertainers.

35
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,751
That's just what
was wrong with them.

36
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:10,322
They weren't what the program
calls for, and you know it.

37
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,892
If this thing blows up after it's been
announced all over the country...

38
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,224
it'll be an irreparable blow to
the prestige of Crackly Grain Flakes...

39
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,228
and, Kent, I won't have it!

40
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,230
Take your hands off my child.

41
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,733
I will if she'll take
her teeth out of my hand.

42
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,430
- You worm. I'll have
the Humane Society up here.
- Let go. Ooh!

43
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,667
Say, what do you got in that bag?

44
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,277
I carry it for luck.

45
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,904
Glad you took the horse off it.

46
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,210
Quiet!

47
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,946
Quiet!

48
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,522
Quiet! Now, listen!
Listen!

49
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,592
Now, listen, please! Quiet, ladies!

50
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,992
You'll have to wait your turn:

51
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,223
You sure you got
the song right?

52
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,834
Yew, Uncle Harry,
but I'm awfully hungry.

53
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:59,871
Shh. Not so loud. We'll be eating regular
soon as I hand these guys the old one-two.

54
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,871
You better not, Uncle Harry.

55
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:05,068
The last time you gave the old one-two,
you came home with a black eye.

56
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,075
That was a crooked game,
and can prove it.

57
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,811
Well, honey, when do we
start broadcasting?

58
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,113
It's my guess
you've never stopped.

59
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,157
Don't be that way, sweetheart.
Isn't this the place
that advertised for a kid?

60
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:23,058
I have here the most sensational,
the most extraordinary and thrilling...

61
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,165
So you're another one of those.
I'm afraid you're too late.

62
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,164
Harry Kipper is never too late.

63
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:32,795
All right, hotshot. Have it your own way.
Child's name and address.

64
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:36,100
Rebecca Winstead,
950 10th Avenue.

65
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,177
- Where's the man in charge?
- That door.

66
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,746
Thanks, sister.
I'll be seeing you oh the way out.

67
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,815
I can't wait.

68
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,854
You'll have to excuse him.
I've told him not to act that way.

69
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,427
Oh, that's all right.
I'm used to it.

70
00:04:56,562 --> 00:05:00,430
- Would you like some candy?
- Thank you.

71
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,933
We'd really get further in our act
if he wouldn't talk so much.

72
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,437
- Is he in the act with you?
- No, I'm the act. He's my manager.

73
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,474
I bet you'd make a better manager
than your father.

74
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,909
Uncle Harry's not my father.
He's my stepfather.

75
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,515
I've been taking care of him
ever since Mother died.

76
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,618
- Oh, you poor child.
- I'm not a poor child.

77
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,619
- You know, I'm very self-reliant.
- You are?

78
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,349
Yes. My mother told me
to always be that way.

79
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,392
Well, Kent, what are
we waiting for now?

80
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,395
I'll see what's holding them up.
Orville, let's go.

81
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:35,126
Okay, chief.
What are you going to sing, little girl?

82
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:40,205
Frorabelle will now sing
"You Got to Eat Your Spinach, Baby."

83
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,399
Do they all have to
sing that song?

84
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,770
Give it to them, Florabelle.

85
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,147
- Now, honey.
- # You got to eat your spinach, baby #

86
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,123
# That's the only thing to do #

87
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,787
Come on.
Snap in to it, sweetheart.

88
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,898
Snap in to it.

89
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:11,062
#You got to eat your spinach#

90
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,728
"Baby," isn't it?
It's "baby," isn't it? Yes, "baby."

91
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,841
Come on, honey.
You can do better than that. Now-

92
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:27,277
Mike fright, eh? I know just
how you feel. It happened to me once.

93
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,981
- What's she doing that for?
- Stage fright. She can't help it.

94
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,989
What's stage fright?

95
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,562
Well, it's, um-
It's something you'll never get.

96
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,631
- Why?
- Because I trained you. That's why.

97
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,735
You're a trouper.
That kid's just an amateur.

98
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:47,101
Stop it. Stop it. You're killing me.

99
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,903
If it wasn't for setting
a bad example for Florabelle...

100
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,205
I'd pin your ears back.

101
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,815
Come on, doll.

102
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:03,411
I have here the most sensational,
most extraordinary and thrilling-

103
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,025
Say, do you get stage fright?

104
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,254
- No, I'm a trouper.
- Have you got adenoids?

105
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,092
No, but I'll get some
if you want them.

106
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,132
Okay. You're next.

107
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,032
Play it good, professor.
Your search is over, son.

108
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,605
If I do say so myself,
this child is the most, uh-

109
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,471
Clever child. Clever child.
All right. Go to it.

110
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,084
#What is all this dizzy
busy hustling for#

111
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,654
#People running helter-skelter
on their way#

112
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,882
# What is all this hazy
crazy bustling for #

113
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,688
# No time to notice
it's a sunny day #

114
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,356
# Why don't you take
a vacation #

115
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:51,232
# Looks like you've got to
have relaxation #

116
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:55,306
# Aw, come on, forget
your troubles for a while #

117
00:07:55,441 --> 00:08:00,743
# Why don't you try to
feel like I do #

118
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,611
# If I had one wish to make #

119
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,014
#This is the wish I would choose #

120
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,587
That's great!
Just what I've been looking for

121
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,987
No need to look further.
She's perfect.

122
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,990
Okay, Orville.
That's enough.

123
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,187
I'm sorry, honey.
I guess you're not the type.

124
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,698
I can change my type.
I'm very self-reliant.

125
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,268
But you didn't even
let her finish her song!

126
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,997
The chief said he's heard enough,
and he's giving orders around here.

127
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,404
Why, he's passing up
the most colossal, the most in-

128
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:34,172
You told him that once before,
Uncle Harry, and it didn't do any good.

129
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,372
That's very true, my child,
very true.

130
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,609
You don't know talent
when you see it.

131
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,185
It's people like you that'll put radio
on the spot today.

132
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,255
Why, at this rate, the big networks
will be bankrupt within a year!

133
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,915
Radio Center will be
as empty as your head!

134
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,961
Thousands of employees will be thrown
out of work, and all because of you!

135
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,292
Bah!

136
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,366
I do all that?

137
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,935
You can't come in here!

138
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,038
You'll have to get out.
Now, please.

139
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,278
- How'd you make out, honey?
- The man said I wasn't the type.

140
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,413
There's nothing wrong
with your type.

141
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,016
It's your environment
that's not so hot.

142
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,517
Then maybe I should have
my- my environment fixed.

143
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:19,023
- Come, come. Enough of this slumming.
- Hmm.

144
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,591
My goodness.
I thought we were wowing them.

145
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,359
Well, I guess it's time
to go home.

146
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,436
It may interest you to know, Rebecca,
that we have no home.

147
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,095
That foul landlady
locked us out this morning.

148
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,037
Uncle Harry, why are landladies
always doing that to us?

149
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,078
It won't happen again. I'm going to give your
other relatives a chance to feed you.

150
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,647
Oh, goody!
You mean we’re going to have dinner?

151
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,843
I mean I'm taking you to your
Aunt Miranda's at Sunnybrook Farm.

152
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,920
From now on,
you're living with her

153
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,219
But, Uncle Harry, I want to stay here and
be a success like my mother wanted me to.

154
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:57,455
Well, I've done all can for you.
I taught you all know.

155
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,566
Yes. I guess it just
wasn't enough.

156
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,238
Good-bye, Mr. Bartlett. I'm glad
everything's turned out so well.

157
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,604
So am I, Kent. And don't let anything
happen to that little girl.

158
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,608
Without her, there's no program.

159
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,340
- Just tune in next Wednesday night.
- I'll be glued to that radio.

160
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,625
- Yes?
- Okay for the next kid, chief?

161
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,423
What do you mean "the next kid"? Bring in
the little girl that just sang, and fast.

162
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,499
Well, I didn't think-You didn't-
I didn't think you liked her.

163
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,967
- She just left.
- She just-What? Get her back here!

164
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,571
I want that kid right now!

165
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,800
Oh, of all the stupid,
dumb morons

166
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,139
- Who, me?
- Oh, hello, Lola:

167
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,045
Well, that's a fine greeting
after last night's stand-up.

168
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,413
I'm sorry, Lola.
I was busy. I forgot.

169
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,417
I waited three hours for you.

170
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:59,752
- I said I'm sorry.
- You still haven't told me where you were.

171
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,792
Lola, can't you understand?

172
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,361
I've been busy, and when I say "busy,"
I mean crazy.

173
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,432
I've had kids in my hair day and night.
Now, please don't make it any worse!

174
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,228
- Well, you needn't scream.
- Who's screaming?

175
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,805
Hello. Stoddard?
Did you see a big girl with a little man?

176
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,203
I mean, a little man
with a big girl. l-

177
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,675
What's that? They're down there?
Hold them! Stop them! Yes.

178
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,508
Send them back to Kent's office
right away.

179
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:26,106
Oh, Myrtle,
I thought I made a mistake.

180
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,584
Impossible.

181
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,554
All right, all right.
If you insist, then I wasn't working.

182
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,489
I was out with a blonde,
a beautiful, gorgeous, luscious blonde.

183
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,562
And we're going to be married next week.
Are you satisfied?

184
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,791
Ah, Tony, we're crazy
fighting like this.

185
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,925
It's okay, chief.
They're on their way back up here.

186
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,129
Oh. Hello, Lola.

187
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,637
Hello, love of my life.

188
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,708
Aw, cut it out, Lola.

189
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,640
Can I help it if go all pieces
when I see you?

190
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,339
The man and the little girl
are here, Mr. Kent.

191
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,575
Oh!

192
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,243
Well, come right in. I'm certainly glad
we caught you in time.

193
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,753
When they tapped me on the shoulder,
I thought it was the cops.

194
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,880
But, chief, she isn't-
That isn't-

195
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,960
Keep quiet, Orville. Lola, I want you to
get a load of this kid's voice.

196
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,690
She's sensational. Sing me
that last chorus of your song, honey.

197
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,926
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Please. Oh, wait till he finds out.

198
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,229
- Just listen to this.
- Chief, chief.

199
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,507
Let her go, Florabelle!

200
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:32,208
#You got to each
your spinach, baby #

201
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,254
- Oh.
- Come on. Pull yourself
together, sweetheart!

202
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,689
Ouch!

203
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,696
- # You got to eat your spinach #
- That's plenty.

204
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,322
- That's plenty.
- Well, this guy-

205
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,731
- I said that's enough.
- This bird here-

206
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,338
You'll be hearing from me very soon,
very soon indeed.

207
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,736
- This guy told us...
- I'll be calling you up someday.

208
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,935
- But this fellow-
- Yes, yes. Good-bye. Good-bye.

209
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,810
- I am going to cut you
up and sell you for bait.
- It wasn't my fault.

210
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,544
Do you realize if we don't find that kid,
Bartlett cancels everything?

211
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,621
Careful, Tony. Remember your apoplexy.
I gotta run now, darling.

212
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,020
- Bye, Casanova.
- Good-bye, Lola.

213
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,024
I gotta hand it to you, Orville.

214
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,153
I've been out on a limb
before, but I've never had a
guy behind me sawing it off.

215
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,561
You realize we're on
the worst spot of the century?

216
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,429
You've got nothing to worry about, chief.
We've got the kid's address.

217
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:27,471
- You have?
- Of course. We've got all their addresses.

218
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,541
- Yes?
- Did you get the addresses of
every one of the applicants?

219
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,541
- Yes.
- Well.

220
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,545
That's a load off my mind.
Whew. I'm dead.

221
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,616
Between you and Lola and
getting this program set, I'm going screwy.

222
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,185
Why don't you take a run down
to Atlantic City for a few days?

223
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,084
Atlantic City. That's the sort of place
I'm trying to get away from.

224
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,657
I'm going up to my farm
where I can relax.

225
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,317
Birds, trees, new-mown hay,
the simple life.

226
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,895
Well, anyway, that's what I need.

227
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,829
Oh, when you find that kid,
be sure you get the contract signed.

228
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,300
Pay her anything she wants!
Well, within reason.

229
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,462
If you make any mistakes,
I'm going to tear your head off
and use it for a doorstop.

230
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,041
- Okay, chief. You know me.
- I'm still regretting it.

231
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,503
Now you're going to meet
your Aunt Miranda.

232
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,576
I wonder if she'll like me.

233
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,770
You be nice to her,
and she'll be nice to you.

234
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,847
Uncle Harry...

235
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,543
is this where my mother used to live
when she was a little girl?

236
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,550
Yup.

237
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,155
I think I'm going to like it here.

238
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,225
Wait for me.

239
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,406
How do you do?
I guess you must be my Aunt Miranda.

240
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:16,275
Heavens above.
It's Bess's child.

241
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:20,613
- How did you ever get here?
- Oh, we drove up on the village bus.

242
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,448
"We"? Who's we?

243
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,920
Why, Uncle Harry and I.

244
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,821
There ought to be a law
against loose planks.

245
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,793
- It's a miracle I'm still alive.
- It's no miracle.

246
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,366
It's a calamity. I suppose you want
something, as usual.

247
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,731
Let's not start by quarreling, Miranda.
I'm only going to be here a few minutes.

248
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,768
That's long enough for me.

249
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,465
My, this is a very fine boarding house.

250
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,609
This is no boarding house, honey.

251
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,802
I thought everyone took in roomers.

252
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,970
A nice environment
you've given her.

253
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,309
I want to have
my environment fixed.

254
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,977
- I'll wager the child hasn't
had a bit of food.
- Oh, yes, I have.

255
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,985
Uncle Harry bought me a candy bar.

256
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,987
Candy bar?

257
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,649
Take the child in the kitchen and
get her something decent to eat.

258
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,389
- Oh, I can help myself.
I'm very self-reliant.
- I'm hungry too.

259
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,829
Let's go together, huh?

260
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,958
My name's Rebecca Winstead.
What's yours?

261
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:14,471
- I'm Gwen Warren. We're first cousins.
- Oh, are we?

262
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,474
My, it's nice to get-out
in the country again.

263
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,011
You certainly have
a cozy little place here, Miranda.

264
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,046
Get to the point, Harry.

265
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,276
Well, Miranda, it's this way.

266
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,148
I've had Rebecca on my hands
for some time now.

267
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:33,349
It's been quite a burden. Of course,
I'm only too glad to take care of the child.

268
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,393
Although she really isn't
my own, you might say.

269
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,622
But lately I've had several
financial reverses, and I thought-

270
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:43,531
You're trying to tell me you want me
to take the child off your hands.

271
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:48,038
I'd hardly put it that way, Miranda,
but that's the general idea.

272
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,107
Listen to me, Harry Kipper.

273
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:54,406
I'll take Rebecca,
but only on one condition.

274
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:58,573
Promise to let me have her for good, so
I can give her the right kind of upbringing.

275
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,277
I don't want her to come to
a bad end like her mother.

276
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,479
Now, now, your sister
didn't do so bad.

277
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,182
- You're just against show people.
- Show people!

278
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,759
If Bess hadn't eloped with that
opera singer who died without a cent...

279
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,158
she wouldn't have had to marry
a no-good like you!

280
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,526
- Now, Miranda.
- Don't you "Now, Miranda" me!

281
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,930
Will you promise not to come back here
if I take the child?

282
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:21,438
It's a sacrifice, but I'll go for anything
that's good for Rebecca.

283
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,007
- You know me, Miranda.
- Yes, I know you.

284
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:28,910
- You're probably in a hurry. Good-bye.
- Oh, just one more thing.

285
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,142
I've been sort of short lately,
and I thought that maybe-

286
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,447
I wouldn't lend you a cent
if it was to save your life, Harry Kipper.

287
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,283
Well, no harm in asking.

288
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,723
Aunt Miranda,
you certainly are a good cook.

289
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,660
- Bye-bye, Rebecca. Don't miss me too much.
- I won't, Uncle Harry.

290
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,290
Well, see you folks in church.

291
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:00,273
Maybe it's for the best.
He has been an awful trial to me.

292
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,506
- Take her up to the side room.
- Come on, darling.

293
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,651
As long as you live here,
you'll wear your hair this way.

294
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,057
I like it.
It's so nice and cool.

295
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,858
I wore my hair that way
when I was a little girl.

296
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,432
- My, I bet you were pretty.
- Now, get along.

297
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,695
See what you can learn
about farming.

298
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,203
All right. I'll introduce myself
to the chickens.

299
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,313
I was considered
quite a belle in my day.

300
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,144
I'll bet you kicked up your heels
when you were young.

301
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,149
The idea.
Stuff and nonsense.

302
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,923
Oh, you poor little thing.

303
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,929
I hope you're all right.

304
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,296
Oh, you bent your tail.

305
00:18:56,435 --> 00:19:00,371
I'll fix it. I'm surprised Aunt Miranda
lets you wear it curled.

306
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,642
I'll bet you haven't had
any breakfast.

307
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:09,736
I'll ask Aunt Miranda
to give you some eggs and bacon.

308
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,085
Oh, there's your breakfast!
Hurry up, or there won't be any left.

309
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,789
Oh, that's the wrong way.
Come back!

310
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,486
Please come back!
You'll get lost:

311
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,131
For heaven's sake, where are you?

312
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,200
Don't you want your breakfast?

313
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,371
You're a very naughty pig.

314
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,874
Well, hello, stranger.
What's your hurry?

315
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,643
I'm sorry, but I was trying
to catch our pig.

316
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,548
- Don't you know you're trespassing?
- What's that mean?

317
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,552
It means you're very welcome.

318
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,214
Thank you, but I must catch our pig.

319
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:57,021
Wait. I'll round him up.
You stay here andhead him off.

320
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,905
Aunt Miranda! Gwen!

321
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,977
- Aunt Miranda! Gwen!
- Rebecca, what's the matter?

322
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,705
- They fell in the well.
- Who fell in the well?

323
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,281
A pig and the man
with the long legs.

324
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,715
- Something wrong, Miss Gwen?
- Someone fell in the well.

325
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,446
- Perhaps it's Homer.
- No, ma'am. There's Homer now.

326
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:28,219
- Hello Gwen. What's all the rumpus?
- There's a man down there.

327
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,222
It's my boss.
Are you hurt, Mr. Kent?

328
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,959
- We're all right. Get a rope.
- Let's use the hose.

329
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,240
Ouch:

330
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,967
You might have at least
taken the nozzle off.

331
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,008
Okay. Haul away.

332
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,079
Everybody, pull.

333
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,456
- Thank you.
- Oh, don't mention it. Nothing at all.

334
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,358
Whew.

335
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:09,092
I hope you'll pardon my appearance.
I didn't expect callers.

336
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,725
I'm glad you're not hurt.
Or are you?

337
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,804
I'm afraid so.
There's a strange feeling right here.

338
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,500
Oh, I hope it doesn't
hurt you too much.

339
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,736
You better let Gwen and me
put you to bed.

340
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,813
That would be
a pleasant experience.

341
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,542
I think Homer can handle the situation.
Come on, darling.

342
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,549
I'm sorry she bothered you Mr...

343
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:31,486
Kent is the name. Anthony Kent. I live here,
but this is my first trip of the year.

344
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,854
I hope you'll bother again soon.
I've got a lot of other tricks.

345
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,791
I'd love to see them.
Will you do one now?

346
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,863
I'd better clean up first.
How 'bout tomorrow?

347
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,932
Perhaps. Come on, darling.

348
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,366
- Homer, see the ladies to the door.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,438
I'll hold the pig.

350
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,507
Over we go.

351
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,378
Gwen! Haven't I told you
to keep out of that place?

352
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:59,041
The place is all right, Auntie.
In fact, it's quite nice.

353
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,176
- Besides, I had to help Rebecca.
- What were you doing in there?

354
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,482
Now, Miranda, it wasn't her fault.

355
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,558
- Your pig ran away,
and she had to chase it.
- Is that my pig?

356
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,890
- Yes, Aunt Miranda.
- Tell that man to give it to Aloysius.

357
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,463
But he's right here.
Why don't you tell him?

358
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,691
'Cause I refuse to speak to him.

359
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,268
Aunt Miranda says for you
to give the pig to Aloysius...

360
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,462
and she refuses to speak to you.

361
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,040
I'm used to it. She's refused
to speak to me for 25 years.

362
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,441
You can tell Homer Busby
he's not fit to touch my pig...

363
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,877
and he's a no-good loafer!

364
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,043
You're not fit to touch our pig,
and you're no-good loafer.

365
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,280
- But I don't think so.
- I'm glad someone's got a kind word for me.

366
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,287
See you again soon, Rebecca.

367
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:43,622
- Tell him he will not!
- Oh, yes, I will.

368
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:47,129
After this, stay on
your own side of the fence!

369
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:50,098
Such people!

370
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,939
- What does Homer do?
- He takes care of Mr. Kent's place.

371
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,271
Why doesn't
Aunt Miranda like him?

372
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:03,176
Well, a long time ago, Homer
asked Aunt Miranda to marry him.

373
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,909
- Is that why she's mad at him?
- Not exactly.

374
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:10,112
You see, Homer celebrated so much the night
before that he forgot to go to the wedding.

375
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:13,122
Mr. Kent is very nice too.
Don't you think?

376
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:17,490
We were talking about Homer.
Come on. Help me pick berries.

377
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,359
Oh, Aloysius, give Rebecca a pail
and show her how to pick berries.

378
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:21,796
Yes, ma'am. It's a pleasure.

379
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,964
Yes, ma'am. It's a pleasure.

380
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:26,298
Now, honey,
you just watch me.

381
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:34,377
# If I had one wish to make #

382
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,981
# This is the wish I would choose #

383
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,174
# I'd want an old straw hat #

384
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:44,653
# A suit of overalls
and a worn-out pair of shoes #

385
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,554
# Just let me roam around #

386
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,559
# Laughing at big-city blues #

387
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,721
# With an old straw hat
a suit of overalls #

388
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:57,357
# And a worn-out pair of shoes #

389
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:00,335
# Howdy, Mr. Brown
Ho-hum #

390
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,999
Going fishing?
Hope you get a bite.

391
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,339
# Howdy, Mr. Jones
Ho-hum #

392
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,312
# How's about a hayride
Saturday night #

393
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,044
# Say hi-ho
the merry... o #

394
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,019
# What have you got
What have you got to lose #

395
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:20,352
# Get an old straw hat
a suit of overalls #

396
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,757
# And a worn-out pair of shoes #

397
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,372
- See who's at the door, Homer.
- Yes, sir.

398
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:46,844
- Why hello there.
- How do you do, Mr. Busby?
I would like to see Mr. Kent.

399
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,852
Well, that might be arranged.
Come right on in.

400
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,215
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thank you.

401
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,919
You may tell him
Miss Winstead is calling.

402
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,929
Well, that would make it
more official.

403
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,334
Uh, that little girl from next door
wants to see you, Mr. Kent.

404
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:13,911
- Oh, so I see.
- You said you'd announce me
as Miss Winstead, Mr. Busby.

405
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:17,276
You'll have to forgive Homer,
Miss Winstead. He's out of practice.

406
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,815
- Oh, that's all right.
- Won't you have some breakfast with me?

407
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,385
We had our breakfast
a long time ago...

408
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,751
but if it were lunch,
I would love to.

409
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,983
Lunch it is then.
Homer, lunch for the lady.

410
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:31,619
I'll try. You know how the cook is
about digging up things at the last minute.

411
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:37,065
The servant problem gets more difficult
every day, don't you think?

412
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,067
I guess it must be terrible.

413
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:43,298
- Will you have a glass of milk?
- Thank you. I'd like that.

414
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,739
You have an awfully
pretty house, Mr. Kent.

415
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,278
I'm glad you like it,
Miss Winstead.

416
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,814
My, but that's good.

417
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,647
Don't look now, Miss Winstead,
but there's milk on your nose.

418
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,920
Dear me. I don't know how
it could have gotten there.

419
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,030
- May I?
- I guess you better.

420
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,257
- Ah. There you are.
- Thank you.

421
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,130
Not at all.
Awfully glad you dropped in.

422
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,760
- I can stay for a minute.
- Do you have to hurry?

423
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:18,433
Aunt Miranda won't like it if I'm gone
too long. She's sold-fashioned.

424
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,410
Oh. I know
just what you mean.

425
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,175
I knew you would
if I explained it to you.

426
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,410
This is all I could dig up.

427
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:31,511
Oh, that's all right.
I eat most anything.

428
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,250
My, Mr. Kent,
but I'm having a good time.

429
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,257
So am I, Miss Winstead.

430
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,760
I've never enjoyed entertaining a lady
so much before.

431
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:42,298
Thank you.
You may call me Rebecca, if you like.

432
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,228
And I'd appreciate it
if you'd call me Tony.

433
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:50,568
Pardon me, madam. Miss Gwen is here
and says your lunch is ready at home.

434
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,040
Homer, where are your manners?
Ask her in.

435
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,612
I hope Gwen will like it here
as much as I do.

436
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,476
Rebecca, I grow fonder of you
by the minute. Hello there.

437
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,414
I'm sorry to intrude...

438
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,385
but Aunt Miranda got worried
when Rebecca didn't come home for lunch.

439
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:06,922
I'll take the blame. Rebecca dropped in
for a call, and I insisted that she stay.

440
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,992
- Won't you sit down?
- I'm afraid I can't.

441
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,823
You better, Gwen.
The food's awful good.

442
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,864
You really can't afford to pass this up.

443
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,594
All right, but no lunch for me, and
I can only stay a minute.

444
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,500
That's what I said,
and I'm still here!

445
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,505
Believe it or not, I was hoping
I'd see you today.

446
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,577
I always say neighbors should be,
well, uh, neighborly.

447
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:30,374
- What do you always say?
- I always say that
depends on the neighbors.

448
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:34,952
I can see we're going
to get along great:

449
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:38,078
Hello. Could you direct me
to Mr. Kent's house, please?

450
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:41,215
- You're looking right at it, bub.
- Oh, thanks.

451
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,793
Just a minute.
I'll have to introduce you first.

452
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,362
Aw, come on. This is important.
I'm Mr. Kent's assistant.

453
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,989
Hold your horses, bub,
and wait till I introduce you.

454
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,999
Keep your eye on him, Al.

455
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:54,264
- I got my eyes right on him.
- How do you like... Ooh!

456
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,873
Would you mind
pointing that the other way?

457
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,705
There's a sort of
a simple-looking person outside.

458
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,281
Says he's got to see you.
Claims he's your assistant.

459
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,749
- Orville? Will you excuse me a moment?
- Sure.

460
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:14,687
- Could I get you some more turkey, madam?
- No, thank you.

461
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,726
I think I have enough.

462
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,365
Well, Orville, I didn't expect
to see you down here.

463
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,991
- Nothing's wrong, I hope.
- No, everything's going to be okay.

464
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,400
You did find the kid
all right, didn't you?

465
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:30,598
- Well, it's this way. See, the detectives-
- Did you find that kid?

466
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,834
- Now, don't get excited.
- Did you find her?

467
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,572
- Chief, there are a lot of other kids.
- Quit stalling, Orville.

468
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,082
- What's happened?
- Well, chief, I lost Little Miss America.

469
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,652
What? What do you mean
you've lost her?

470
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:45,221
It wasn't my fault. We went
to her address, and she'd gone.

471
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,290
I tell you, we even hired detectives.

472
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:50,519
- That kid has vanished from
the face of the Earth.
- That's what you're going to do.

473
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,096
- Do you realize what you've done to me?
- No, wait a minute.

474
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,699
- I'll never explain this to Bartlett.
- You won't have to.

475
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,859
- I told him already.
- You what?

476
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:01,369
- What did he say?
- Well, for a minute he didn't say anything.

477
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,700
Then I couldn't understand him.

478
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,740
Why, you-

479
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,712
Hello, Operator.
I want New York.

480
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,116
I want to speak to Mr. Cyrus Bartlett,
Ryan Lender 51680.

481
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,119
Informs me...

482
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,121
Yes?

483
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,692
- Mr. Kent on long distance.
- Hello?

484
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,692
- Hello. Mr. Bartlett?
- Yeah!

485
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,694
This is Kent. Tony Kent.

486
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:29,698
Look here, Kent, you sold me
on the idea of-

487
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:39,235
##I'd want an old straw hat
a sui9t of overalls ##

488
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,504
Just a minute, Mr. Bartlett.
You're going a little too far.

489
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,512
We can straighten out everything.

490
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:48,016
Why, you-You've ruined-
You've scuttled my product!

491
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,018
The failure of this program...

492
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:54,023
will be an insurmountable affront
to the dignity of Crackly Grain Flakes!

493
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,424
And, Kent, I'll get you for this!
I'll... I'll... I'll...

494
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,622
# This is the wish I would choose #

495
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:04,292
# I'd want an old straw hat
a suit of overalls #

496
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:08,132
# And a worn-out pair of shoes #

497
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,934
# Just let me roam around #

498
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,669
# Laughing at big-city blues #

499
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,145
# With an old straw hat
a suit of overalls #

500
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:20,809
# And a worn-out pair of shoes #

501
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,386
# Howdy, Mr. Brown
Ho-hum #

502
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,115
- Chief! Chief! It's a mirage!
- Shut up.

503
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,953
It's the kid! Little Miss America!
You got to listen.

504
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,825
# How about a hayride
Saturday night #

505
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,331
But, Mr. Bartlett,
I've been trying to tell you...

506
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,332
I've got Little Miss America!

507
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,232
Wait. Listen.

508
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,236
- Listen!
- ## Get an old straw hat ##

509
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:46,304
# A suit of overalls and
a worn-out pair of shoes #

510
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,773
Hold it.
And don't hang up!

511
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,781
Hello?

512
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,409
Homer! Aloysius!
Give me a hand!

513
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,715
Oh!

514
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,654
Get over here.

515
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,056
Keep playing. Loud.
Let's go.

516
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,834
Come on, Rebecca!
Come on. Come on, honey.

517
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,439
Sing another chorus right here
under the phone. Play it, will ya?

518
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,541
Give it everything
you got, honey.

519
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,701
# If I had one wish to make #

520
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,541
# This is the wish I would choose #

521
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:27,048
# I'd want an old straw hat
a suit of overalls #

522
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,949
# And a worn-out pair of shoes #

523
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,052
# Just let me roam around #

524
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,059
# Laughing at big-city blues #

525
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,460
# With an old straw hat
a suit of overalls #

526
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:44,227
# And a worn-out pair of shoes #

527
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,600
# Howdy, Mr. Brown
Ho-hum #

528
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:51,139
# Going fishing? Hope you get a bite
Yes, indeed, I do #

529
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:54,370
# Howdy, Mr. Jones
Ho-hum #

530
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:58,175
# How's about a hayride #

531
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:01,183
# On Saturday night
Ho-ho-ho #

532
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,516
# Sing hi-ho, the merry-o #

533
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,420
# What have you got
What have you got to lose #

534
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,823
# Get an old straw hat
a suit of overalls #

535
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,522
# And a worn-out hat #

536
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,257
# Overalls #

537
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,766
# Shoes #

538
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,935
Did you hear that, Mr. Bartlett?

539
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,939
Of course she's right here.
That's what I called to tell you.

540
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,339
Oh, that. Uh, uh-

541
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:30,072
My assistant was just
playing a practical joke.

542
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:33,615
Oh, you're right. It wasn't very funny.
He's never very funny.

543
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,117
Yes, Mr. Bartlett.
Everything's fine.

544
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,313
In fact, everything's beautiful.

545
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,321
Good-bye, Mr. Bartlett.

546
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,323
Whew.

547
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,325
Well, I put it over, chief.

548
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,327
I knew I'd find her.

549
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,331
I still can't believe it.
Why, it's marvelous.

550
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,332
- But what, Mr. Kent?
- It's uncanny!

551
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,835
We had a kid all set
for a big program.

552
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,371
She disappeared, and now
it turns out to be Rebecca.

553
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,372
Why, it sounds like a fairy tale.

554
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,306
- It is!
- I love fairy tales.

555
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,743
My old pal, Rebecca!

556
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,747
I was crazy about you before,
but now- Ohh!

557
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,943
Why didn’t you tell me
you tried out for my program?

558
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,952
But I didn’t know
it was your program.

559
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,455
- Am I going on the radio after all?
- You bet you are!

560
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,456
Why, you'll be a sensation.

561
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,993
Oh, I don't think
Aunt Miranda will like it.

562
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,994
Don't you worry
about Aunt Miranda.

563
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,190
I'll sell her a bill of goods.

564
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,461
Going to have to be
a mighty good salesman, Mr. Kent.

565
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,372
Rebecca tells me Aunt Miranda
is rather old-fashioned.

566
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,375
- She's mighty peculiar.
- I'm glad I brought you, Homer.

567
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,376
Having along an old friend
of Aunt Miranda's...

568
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,378
ought to get me off
on the right foot.

569
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,382
I'm warn you again... It won't none
to have me along.

570
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,249
I've known Miranda for 25 years, and
I can't rightly say understand her yet.

571
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,256
- Maybe I'd better wait out here.
- Wait a minute.

572
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,259
That's no way to talk to the chief.
Where's your loyalty?

573
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,260
We got to pull together.

574
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,696
Orville, I think you'd better pull from
out here, where you can't do any damage.

575
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,767
Oh, now, chief-

576
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,935
Hello.

577
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,938
Have you told
Aunt Miranda anything yet?

578
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,670
No. Gwen thought
it would be better to surprise her.

579
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:11,270
- Aunt Miranda isn't in
a very good humor today.
- Oh-oh.

580
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,182
Where are you going, Homer?

581
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,184
It just came to me
sort of sudden-like.

582
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,687
Maybe I'd be in the way, hmm?

583
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,758
I'm depending on you.

584
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,069
Aunt Miranda,
this is Mr. Kent.

585
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,470
How do you do, Miss Wilkins?
How are you?

586
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,974
What's that man
doing in my house?

587
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,006
- Why, l... l...That is, l...
- Now, Miranda...

588
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,449
Rebecca, tell that man
to get out of my house.

589
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,579
I think Aunt Miranda
wants you to leave, Mr. Busby.

590
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,089
All right.
I guess I can take a hint.

591
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,992
But you can tell her for me
it isn’t Christian
to hold a grudge so long.

592
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,293
- Mr. Busby says it isn't
Christian to hold a-
- I heard him.

593
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,731
You did?

594
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,736
Mr. Kent, I don't thank you
for bringing that no-good-

595
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,770
Auntie, I don't think
Mr. Kent understands.

596
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:13,399
I assure you, I had no idea there'd been
a breach between you and Mr. Busby.

597
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:17,412
Breach? I don't even know
that Mr. Busby's on Earth.

598
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,614
I quite understand,
Miss Wilkins.

599
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,618
I can see now there couldn't possibly
be any community of interest...

600
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:26,814
between a lady of your background
and a man like Homer.

601
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,121
Hmm. Won't you sit down,
young man?

602
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,195
Thank you, Miss Wilkins.

603
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,792
I knew you'd like Tony, Aunt Miranda.

604
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,457
Tony?

605
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,469
Yes. That's short for Anthony.

606
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,505
I have a great surprise for you,
Miss Wilkins.

607
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,007
I've been connected
with radio a long time...

608
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,011
but never have I met a more talented child
than Rebecca.

609
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,014
Fortunately, she's just what we need for
a big program we're starting.

610
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,382
- Why, Rebecca's personality
and voice are two of the most...
- Just a minute, young man!

611
00:35:56,521 --> 00:36:00,048
Are you trying to tell me
you want to put Rebecca on the radio?

612
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:03,820
Why, yes, on a very important program.
A nationwide hookup-

613
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:07,328
- Get out of here!
- B... B... But, Miss Wilkins,
I don't understand. l...

614
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,330
Auntie, please listen to Mr. Kent.

615
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,833
I want to go on the radio so bad.

616
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:15,097
- You keep out this
- This is a very important
opportunity for Rebecca.

617
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,332
- Surely you can't say no.
- Oh, can't I?

618
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,738
Well, just listen to this, Mr. Kent... No!

619
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:23,540
I know what you theatrical people are-
a no-good lot:

620
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,548
I took Rebecca out of
that unwholesome atmosphere...

621
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,050
and I'm not going to
put her back into it.

622
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,553
She's going to stay right here
where I can keep an eye on her.

623
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,556
- But, Miss Wilkins, I...
_ Mr. Kent, I'm asking you to leave.

624
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,560
- If that's the way you feel,
there's nothing more to say.
- Indeed, there isn't.

625
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,961
All right, Miss Wilkins,
but you're making a serious mistake.

626
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,805
I don't want to hear this subject
mentioned again.

627
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,307
And, Rebecca, if you go
near that man again...

628
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,310
I'll take you over my knee
and give you a spanking you'll never forget.

629
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,380
That goes for both of you.

630
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,941
How much you have to pay her, chief?

631
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,212
Pay her?
Why, we didn't even get her.

632
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:06,346
Tony! Waite minute!

633
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,959
The charming Miss Wilkins
practically tore my head off.

634
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,962
- She was awfully mean to you, Tony.
- It looks hopeless.

635
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:17,261
Once Aunt Miranda makes up her mind,
she's too stubborn to change it.

636
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,598
I've been trying to change it
for 25 years.

637
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:24,605
I'm afraid this is good-bye.
I've got to get back to New York
and straighten out this mess.

638
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,334
We're sorry you're going.

639
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,775
I'm none too happy over it myself,
but I'll be back.

640
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,779
Good-bye, Tony.

641
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,511
I wish I could sing you over
the telephone, like I did to Mr. Bartlett.

642
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,518
- Tony, why not?
- What do you mean?

643
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:40,089
Broadcast from here.
It's possible, isn't it?

644
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,557
Why, yes, it could be done
by remote control.

645
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:46,561
Sure, chief!. We could run wires down
like we did on the courthouse.

646
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,995
Then the kid could stay
in the program.

647
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:52,569
Oh, please try it. With all her talent,
Rebecca deserves a chance.

648
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,568
Oh, Tony, please do!

649
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:58,300
It's insane, but I don't see
why it won't work.

650
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,904
Uh-oh. What about Aunt Miranda?

651
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:06,539
Well, we won't tell her. And you can
Depend on us to keep her in the dark.

652
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,551
You bet we will.
We're very "inescapable."

653
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:15,216
I don't know.
Miranda's a mighty peculiar woman.

654
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,262
# Crackly Grain Flakes #

655
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,229
#The breakfast food of the land #

656
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,231
# Crackly Grain Flakes #

657
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,131
#Are what the people demand #

658
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,398
#What did the white man
fight and die for #

659
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,507
# What did he sign for #

660
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,611
#What things today
do babies cry for #

661
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,679
# Crackly Grain Flakes #

662
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,714
# The very cream of the crop #

663
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,783
# Crackly Grain Flakes #

664
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,681
# In every market and shop #

665
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,685
# They're so tasty #

666
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,086
# Just like pastry #

667
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,089
# Why not try them#

668
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:51,160
# Go and buy them #

669
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:56,426
# Crackly Grain Flakes
are the top #

670
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,002
- You've just heard the
Crackly Grain Flake...
- Never mind the commercial.

671
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,901
Boys, that was
a swell rehearsal.

672
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,941
Knock off and get your feed.
We go on the air in a couple of hours.

673
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,614
Come and get it!

674
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:17,209
You'd better relax too.
It won't be long now, Rebecca. Nervous?

675
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:21,792
Of course not. I never get nervous.
I'm very self-reliant.

676
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:26,192
I don't mind saying
I'm shaking like a leaf.

677
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,496
Well, well!

678
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,498
If it isn't Farmer Gray.

679
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,500
How are all the crops?

680
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:37,038
- Nice of you to show up for
the broadcast anyway.
- Darling, don't be that way.

681
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:39,540
I suppose I should cheer
when you miss a rehearsal.

682
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:44,080
- Now you know how I feel
when you keep me waiting!
- Uh, Miss Warren, Miss Lee.

683
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,115
Miss Lee is an old friend.

684
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,775
- How do you do, Miss Lee?
- Hello, Miss Warren.

685
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:51,046
I've always wanted to meet
a farmer's daughter.

686
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:54,680
Ig led known you were coming,
I'd have worn my sun bonnet.

687
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:57,692
And this is Rebecca,
the star of our program.

688
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:00,194
Oh, isn't she cute.
How old are you, little one?

689
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,196
I'm eight. How old are you?

690
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,767
That's a question
you must never ask a lady.

691
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,632
Oh. I guess
you must be pretty old.

692
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,636
Sweet little thing, isn't she?

693
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:12,641
We'd better be going
Before Aunt Miranda gets suspicious.

694
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,644
That's right. We don't want anything
like that to happen.

695
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,943
Don't worry about a thing.
Homer and I know exactly what to do.

696
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,450
That was a sweet greeting. You practically
broke my arm when I tried to kiss you.

697
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,453
- Couldn't you have at least
waited until they'd gone?
- Oh, so that's it.

698
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,456
A barnyd romance. No wonder you
wanted to broadcast from this outpost.

699
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,958
That blonde hayseed's
got you doing nip-ups.

700
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,962
- Don't start anything, Lola.
That kid means a lot to me.
- Yeah?

701
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,963
Which kid are you talking about?

702
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,967
- Chief, I couldn't find Lola anywhere.
- Keep looking, Orville.

703
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:41,627
- You'll find her.
- Not if I can help it.

704
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,671
Oh! Lola!

705
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,673
I'm sure glad to see you.

706
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,505
- Thanks, my pet.
- Lola.

707
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:53,245
- There's something I've
been wanting to tell you.
- Shoot.

708
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,581
Maybe I better
tell you some other time.

709
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,086
Aw, come on, Orville.
Let's have it.

710
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,453
Well, I don't know
whether I should...

711
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,457
because this is
sort of a secret.

712
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,459
I won't tell a soul.

713
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,962
Well, uh, there’s a certain party...

714
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,225
that's crazy about you.

715
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,232
- Yes?
- Yes.

716
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,337
And because of
certain circumstances...

717
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,873
this party is afraid to tell you
just how he feels.

718
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,010
Oh, how ridiculous.

719
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:24,238
Why, when a man loves a girl,
he should take her in his arms,
smother her with kisses...

720
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,474
and tell her he adores her.

721
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,676
All right then. I will.

722
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,016
Lola, I adore you.

723
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,021
Oh!

724
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,752
- Were you talking about yourself?
- Sure, Lola.

725
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,488
- Couldn't you go for a guy like me?
- Yeah, with an ax.

726
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,565
With an-
I was afraid of that.

727
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,635
- I guess the only one you can see is Tony.
- That's right.

728
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,237
We'll be seeing it with orange blossoms
any day now.

729
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,670
- Well, congratulations.
- Aw, Cheer, Orville.

730
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:54,039
Let's run over the number. Pete, will you
give us "Alone With You," please?

731
00:41:56,547 --> 00:42:00,108
# I've always known
that three's a crowd #

732
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:03,186
# Only two may dance #

733
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:08,257
# Only two romance #

734
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,828
# So when I see you in a crowd #

735
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:15,830
# I'm not satisfied #

736
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:20,733
Till I reach you side#

737
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:25,399
# Atone with you #

738
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:29,637
# I don't know
the meaning of time #

739
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,443
# Alone with you #

740
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:38,317
# I'm yours
without reason or rhyme #

741
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:41,288
# I'd be content to be sent #

742
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:45,691
# To an island in the sea #

743
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,788
# If I had you with me #

744
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:54,064
# How lucky I would be#

745
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:58,265
# Alone with you #

746
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:02,139
# I'll have everything that need#

747
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:06,238
# I always knew #

748
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:11,218
# I'd follow wherever you leag #

749
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:15,314
# So ring the bells
in the steeple #

750
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,758
# Tell all the people #

751
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:22,593
# That we are one #

752
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,726
# And I've begun #

753
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,805
# To live in the heaven #

754
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,536
# Alone with you #

755
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:38,512
- # Alone #
- # Alone with you #

756
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:42,176
# I don't know

757
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,085
- # Alone #
- # Alone with you #

758
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:50,592
# I'm yours

759
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:53,561
# I'd be content to be sent #

760
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:57,758

00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:01,200
# If I had you with me #

762
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:04,205
# How lucky I would be
Ho-ho #

763
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:07,037
# Ho-ho, alone #

764
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,338
# Alone with you #

765
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,916
# I'd have everything that I need #

766
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,781
# I always knew #

767
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,584
# I'd follow wherever you lead #

768
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:25,422
# So ring the bells

769
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:28,429
# Tell all the people #

770
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:31,625
# That we are one #

771
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:37,002
# And I've begun #

772
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,007
# To live in the heaven #

773
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:43,045
- # Alone #
- # Alone #

774
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:51,087
# With you #

775
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,016
Rebecca should be here now.
She goes on in five minutes.

776
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:56,388
- She'll be here, all right.
- I hope so.

777
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,462
- What if she can't make it?
- I've got a two-minute emergency ready.

778
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,689
- After that, we're sunk.
- Oh.

779
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:06,496
- You didn't, by any chance,
have anything to do with this?
- I didn't do a thing.

780
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,572
So the doctor said to me,
"Mrs. Turner, in my 20 years of practice...

781
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,107
I've never seen a case
like yours before."

782
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:16,406
So he called right away,
and they rushed me to the hospital.

783
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:20,574
What's gotten into you, Rebecca? You've been
yawning and fidgeting ever since dinner.

784
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,346
I'm so sleepy...

785
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,421
and this horsehair tickles.

786
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:29,788
Where are your manners, child?
I don't know what ails her, Mrs. Turner.

787
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:33,226
- Don't you think Rebecca
ought to go to bed?
- Might as well.

788
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:35,263
Better than falling asleep
here in our laps.

789
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,026
Good night!

790
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:41,262
Rebecca!
Come right back here!

791
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,704
Didn't you forget
something, Rebecca?

792
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,708
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

793
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:50,905
Good night, Reverend Turner.
Good night, Mrs. Turner.

794
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:54,313
Land's sakes. I never did see a child
so eager to go to bed.

795
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,715
I think I'll go up and help her.

796
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,118
Since when couldn't Rebecca
undress herself?

797
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,384
- But the poor little thing's so sleepy.
- Well!

798
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,839
Gwen, there's something
wrong with my whistler.

799
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,341
If mine's out of order,
we're sunk.

800
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:26,138
- That's the signal.
- Let's go.

801
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:42,332
- You Hold it steady, Al.
I'll go up and get her.
- If I don't hold it, skip it.

802
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,675
We're late.
What kept you?

803
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,212
- Mrs. Turner's operation.
- Is the ladder safe?

804
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:00,714
- I built it myself.
- Just the same, you better
hold it up from here.

805
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:07,087
Shh.

806
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,496
You better get her on it.

807
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:35,016
Come on, honey. We've got to hurry.
Program is half over now.

808
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:54,329
- Gwen!
- Hang on.

809
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,365
- Yes, Auntie?
- What's going on up there?

810
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,171
Oh, it's nothing.
I just knocked over a rocking chair.

811
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:04,712
Well, you're old enough
to know better.

812
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,713
Yes, Auntie.

813
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,599
Shh.

814
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:32,339
That was a close call.

815
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,877
You better stay up here
until they bring Rebecca back.

816
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:44,119
This way, dear.

817
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,756
The doctor told me
he operated just in time.

818
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:56,389
- Have another piece of kake.
- I've already had two.

819
00:48:56,533 --> 00:49:00,264
- You've had three, but you're welcome.
- Oh, that reminds me.

820
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,302
Henry, what time is it?

821
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,408
Surely you're not thinking
of leaving, Mts. Turner?

822
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:10,376
Oh, no, but I did want to hear that new
Crackly Grain Flakes Hour on the radio.

823
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,277
8:10, dear.

824
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,384
Oh, my. It's started already.

825
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:18,887
- Uh, may I?
- Well, no. It's not working, I don't think.

826
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:22,185
There was nothing wrong
with it this morning, I'm sorry to say.

827
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:25,261
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the high spot of our program.

828
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:29,058
Crackly Grain Flakes takes pleasure
in presenting everybody's little girl...

829
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,531
healthy, happy
Little Miss America.

830
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:35,604
Her first song will be
"Come and Get Your Happiness."

831
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,306
# Why are grown-up people's
faces wrinkled #

832
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,817
# Like a lot of prunes #

833
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:54,481
# Money, money That's what
chases them around like crazy loons #

834
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:58,025
# I thing they make a big mistake #

835
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,755
# Wealth and happiness that counts #

836
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:04,993
# Are free to all
in large amounts #

837
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:09,071
# There's millions worth
of golden sunbeams #

838
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:12,733
# That everybody can possess #

839
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,367
# All God's children got success #

840
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:19,572
# Come and get your happiness #

841
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:23,550
#There's billions worth
of silver moonbeams #

842
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:27,350
# Enough for everyone
I guess #

843
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:31,018
# What's a million
more or less #

844
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,255
# Come and get your happiness #

845
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:38,164
# Almond the wildwood
of your happy childhood #

846
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:41,395
#Where you were Jill and Jacks #

847
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:45,507
# In rangy britches
there's a lot of riches #

848
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:49,076

- Isn't she cute?
- A remarkable child.

873
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:16,261
# Millions worth of golden sunshine #

874
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:18,367
Well, that sounds like Rebecca.

875
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:22,302
Why, that's ridiculous, Auntie.

876

00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:10,752
# And come and get your happiness #

889
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:14,220
# Come and get your happiness #

890
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:18,221
Land's sakes, that’s peculiar!

891
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,852
If I didn't know Rebecca
was upstairs in bed...

892
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:23,431
I'd swear that was her voice
on the radio.

893
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:27,264
Well, it did sound like Rebecca,
but of course it couldn't possibly be.

894
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:36,739
Maybe not, but she's gotten
mighty heavy all of a sudden.

895
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,913
Now, Auntie...

896
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,558
Rebecca? Are you asleep?

897
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,895
Yes, Auntie.

898
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:07,799
- Homer Busby, get off that bed!
- Miranda.

899
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,880
- You're talking to me.
- Course I'm talking to you.

900
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:16,782
- Take me to Rebecca.
- I've waited we years for this moment.

901
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,287
- Fiddlesticks.
- Oh, don't be stubborn any longer.

902
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,017
We're wasting
the best gears of our livers.

903
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:25,354
Homer Busby, you're revolting.

904
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:28,089
Come on, Mirandy. Give in.

905
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,825
How do I know I can trust you
after the way you acted?

906
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,731
I swear I'll never
keep you waiting again.

907
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:36,064
Give me one more chance.

908
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:39,800
Are you sure you got all the wild oats
out of your system?

909
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:42,001
Congratulations, you two.

910
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:44,738
There's no time for this folderol.
Where is she?

911
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:47,349
Take me to her!
Come on!

912
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:52,121
And now, before we sign off, our little star
has another number for you.

913
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,120
What would you like
to sing for us?

914
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,225
What would you like me
to sing, Mr. Smithers?

915
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,384
I'm sure everyone would like to
hear you sing the songs...

916
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:01,088
- that have made a lot of people happy.
- All right.

917
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:13,567
# My dear radio audience #

918
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:15,608
# Now I shall do #

919
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:20,512
# Some of the songs I've had the pleasure
of introduction to you #

920
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,177
# It was not so very long ago #

921
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,516
# When you heard this little ditty #

922
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,819
# On your radio, oh #

923
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:33,190
# On the good ship
Lollipop #

924
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,821
# It's a sweet trip
to a candy shop #

925
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,899
# Where bonbons play #

926
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,628
# On the sunny beach
of Peppermint Bay #

927
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:44,764
# And do you remember #

928
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:47,739
# Animal crackers in my soup #

929
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:50,607
# Monkeys and rabbits loop the loop #

930
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:53,215
# Gosh, oh, gee but I have fun #

931
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,547
# Swallowing animals one by one #

932
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:01,623
# And I never ever will
forget my grandest thrill #

933
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:05,319
# The very first time that I sang #

934
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:10,863
# An ordinary day becomes a holiday #

935
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,298
# When I'm with you #

936
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,529
# Mmm, mmm #

937
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:19,835
# I have lots of toys
but I don't want to play #

938
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,943
# Yes, and I'll never forget it #

939
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:24,637
# I sat in my daddy's lap
and whispered #

940
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:28,615
# Oh, Daddy, how I miss you #

941
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:31,880
# You're busy all your life #

942
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:36,448
# I long to hug and kiss you #

943
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:39,619
# Marry me and
let me be your wife #

944
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:43,765
#Ah, but it’s great to reminisce #

945
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,460
# When I sang to my little Dutch dolly #

946
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:49,299
#J ust like this #

947
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,906
# Sometimes I ought to haste you #

948
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,407
# You make me feel so blue #

949
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:56,910
# But honest I can't haste you #

950
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:59,708
# When you smile at me
main lovely popgun #

951
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:02,079
# Ach, main goodness #

952
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:10,057
The clock is ticking
the hours away.

953
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:13,094
# And so, my radio audience #

954
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,493
# The time has come #

955
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:17,623
# For me to say #

956
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:22,534
# Good night, my friends #

957
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:26,334
# The tired old moon is descending #

958
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:29,808
# Good night, my friends #

959
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:33,882
# My moment with you now is ending #

960
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:40,379
And so I must leave you
with kindest regards...

961
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:43,492
from Rebecca and Crackly Grain Flakes...

962
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,060
the grain flake that makes your tummy...

963
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:48,460
Say yum, yum, yummy.

964
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:53,160
I want all my little friends
to close their eyes and dream...

965
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:56,272
for in the morning,
it's Crackly Grain Flakes...

966
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:58,374
some sugar and cream.

967
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:01,635
Eat it with a smile,
and life will be worthwhile.

968
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:03,643
Now, in conclusion...

969
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,806
please join me
in singing my theme.

970
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:12,385
# Good night, my friends #

971
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:16,049
# Sleep tight, my friends #

972
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:19,286
# God bless you
Pleasant dreams #

973
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,664
Nighty-night.

974
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:28,767
- That was Rebecca.
- Go on. You're daffy.

975
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:32,465
Oh, am I? I know that kid when I hear.
I've heard her a thousand times.

976
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,872
What would she be doing
on a big hookup like that?

977
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,105
I told you when you married me
you'd be in the dough, didn’t I?

978
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:40,216
Come on. Get dressed.

979
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,888
Adorable!

980
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,118
Come on, folks. Hurry up.
10:00 train, don't forget.

981
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:54,594
Miss Winstead,
I think you're wonderful.

982
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:57,996
- You mean, the program was all right?
- Who cares about the program?

983
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:01,399
- Miss Winstead, I love you.
- And I love you too, Tony.

984
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:04,039
I don't know how
I ever got along before I met you.

985
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,005
Tony, when I grow up,
would you marry me

986
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:11,807
Rebecca, I've never received a more
flattering proposal, but it won't work out.

987
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:15,111
By the time you're ready to get married,
I'll have a long, gray beard.

988
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:18,584
Then would you marry Gwen?
She's almost ready.

989
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,986
Rebecca, will you give me a kiss?

990
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,093
They just can't resist you,
can they, Tony?

991
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,195
How 'bout running down
to the village with me?

992
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:29,662
I can't. I've got to wrap up Little
Miss America and put her back
where I found her.

993
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:32,324
So far, everything's
gone like clockwork.

994
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,936
- I'm afraid the clock's going to stop, Tony.
- Huh?

995
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:39,235
Now, Miss Wilkins, I don't want you to
say anything until you hear my side of this.

996
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,570
Young man, what are you
going to pay Rebecca?

997
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,201
Well- Huh?

998
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:46,405
But, Aunt Miranda, I don't want any pay.
I love to sing.

999
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:48,346
Then you don't mind, Miss Wilkins?

1000
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:52,944
Course I mind. I'm not going to have my niece
a big radio star and not get paid for it.

1001
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,853
You won't have a thing to worry about,
Miss Wilkins. I assure you.

1002
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,085
- You're an old dear.
- You're a honey, Aunt Miranda.

1003
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:00,092
- Hmm.
- How about me?

1004
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:02,424
Homer Busby,
you're an old fool.

1005
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:05,033
But you can't wait
much longer, Aunt Miranda.

1006
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:07,102
She's right, Mirandy.

1007
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,205
I got my rig out here if you want to
take a ride in the moonlight.

1008
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,274
Go on, Auntie. I'll be along later.

1009
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:15,343
Homer Busby, you always were impulsive.
Come on, Rebecca.

1010
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:18,036
But, Miranda, I thought that
after all these years...

1011
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:20,706
Nonsense! It's past Rebecca's bedtime
and mine too.

1012
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,943
Come along. Good might!

1013
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:30,591
Tony, darling, if Miss What’s Here Name
doesn't mind, I'd like to speak with you.

1014
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:33,161
- Will you pardon me, Gwen?
- Oh, don't bother about me.

1015
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,958
I'll be right back.

1016
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,964
- Oh, hello!
- Hello.

1017
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:40,069
- Gee, it was a swell program, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was.

1018
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:42,363
- Wasn't she wonderful?
- Rebecca’s all right.

1019
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:45,530
- Uh, yes, she is, but I meant Lola.
- Oh.

1020
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,643
- Oh, gosh, she's sweet.
- So it's like that, is it?

1021
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:50,905
Well, only on my side.
She's crazy about the chief.

1022
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:53,572
Oh, really?

1023
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:55,980
Gee, he's a lucky guy.
He gets everything guy.

1024
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:59,816
- Yes, I... I suppose he does.
Good night, Orville.
- Good night.

1025
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:03,719
Where's Gwen?

1026
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:07,489
Oh, think she started for home.

1027
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,495
Gwen.

1028
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:15,064
- Pardon me, but haven't you
forgotten something?
- I don't think so.

1029
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,900
Well, think again. A fella named Kent
is going to take you home.

1030
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,770
- You think again.
- What's wrong?

1031
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:24,038
- Oh, nothing, nothing at all.
- Gwen, what is all this about?

1032
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,513
- Please, it isn't anything.
- Tony, darling:

1033
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,515
Is it Lola
that's worrying you?

1034
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:33,179
Lola? Mm-mmm. Let's forget it.
Good night.

1035
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:44,628
Now I'm going to make a gingerbread man.

1036
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:47,497
Now I think I'll make a moon.

1037
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:53,973
Now I thing a heart.

1038
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,841
Now a star.

1039
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:05,543
Gwen, when these are done,
let's take some over to Tony.

1040
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:08,486
Well, I'll be too busy,
but you can take some over to him.

1041
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:11,787
- Don't you like Tony anymore?
- Well, of course I like him.

1042
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:13,793
You sounded like
you're mad at him.

1043
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:17,132
Now, Melba, act nice to the kid.

1044
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:19,700
You don't have to tell me how to act.

1045
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:32,878
So, all right, honey.
I got it twice.

1046
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:35,779
- We could sue them for that.
- That's an idea.

1047
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,785
Oh, run along, will you,
and see who's at the door?

1048
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:49,563
Hello there, honey.
How's tricks? Meet the missus-

1049
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:52,293
- Your new mother.
- How do you do?

1050
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,370
Hello, kid. How about a kiss?
- No, Thank you.

1051
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:58,099
- Fresh, eh?
- Aunt Miranda!

1052
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,742
- Aunt Miranda!
- What a dump!

1053
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:03,743
Isn’t it a laugh? Wait till
you see Aunt Miranda. She'll kill you.

1054
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,543
- I hope not.
- Hey, come on in. Get a load of this.

1055
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:14,949
- What do you think of it?
- I wouldn't like it if I was a moth.

1056
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:18,060
Well, well!
A long time no see, folks.

1057
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:21,391
Meet the new missus.
And this is my attorney Singer.

1058
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:24,432
- Pleased to meet you.
- I thought you weren't
coming back here, Harry Kipper.

1059
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:27,934
It's this way, Miranda. I been
doing all right, just got married and all.

1060
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:30,231
And I'm ready to
take Rebecca back now.

1061
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:35,036
You do no such thing! You gave the child up
once, and you can't take her back now.

1062
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:39,672
Now, now, now, now, Miranda, there's
no reason we can't be friendly about this.

1063
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,681
I'd as soon be friendly
with a rattlesnake.

1064
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,582
It's obvious you've heard Rebecca
on the radio and you're after her money.

1065
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,417
It's Harry's kid, isn’t it? We got
more right to her dough than you have.

1066
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:52,085
Don't let them take me away,
Aunt Miranda. I didn't like it with him.

1067
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:55,925
Now, honey, you'll have
a swell time with me.
You can have anything you want.

1068
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:57,589
Then I want to stay here!

1069
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:00,293
Oh, Mr. Kipper,
you can't take Rebecca away.

1070
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,994
She's been happier here
than she's ever been in her whole life.

1071
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:06,733
- Now you get out of my house!
- Not without the kid, we don't.

1072
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,878
I don't want to get tough about this,
Miranda, but you're asking for it.

1073
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,911
You just try and take her.

1074
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:14,846
Now, my dear madam, all this yelling
isn't going to get us anyplace.

1075
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:18,818
And don't forget that Mr. Kipper is
the child's stepfather and legal guardian.

1076
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:22,914
The courts of New York have decreed
that he shall have custody of the child.

1077
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,924
Here are the papers.

1078
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:27,359
Now, madam, if you'll
take the advice of a lawyer...

1079
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:30,294
who's looking out for your interest...

1080
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:35,097
as well as my own client's,
you'll see that this child parks
her things and gets out of here.

1081
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:38,638
He's right, Auntie.
There's nothing we can do about it now.

1082
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:42,175
et y pac, kid. Go on.

1083
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:44,609
I'll help.

1084
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:52,311
I warn you, Harry Kipper.
You better take good care of the child.

1085
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:54,355
Say, didn't I always
treat her right?

1086
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:57,755
Don't worry. I'll handle the kid
like she was my own.

1087
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,057
Sure!

1088
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:10,062
Maybe if I work hard, Uncle Harry
will let me come back for the visit.

1089
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,104
Of course, darling.

1090
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,301
Maybe you and Aunt Miranda
can come to the city and see me too.

1091
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:17,639
You bet we will.

1092
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,074
I guess I won't
need these in the city.

1093
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:25,881
Will you save them for me,
for when I come back?

1094
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:31,792
Don't cry, Gwen.
You said you'd come and see me.

1095
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:35,227
I brought you some cookies
to eat on the way.

1096
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:39,232
Thank you, Aunt Miranda.
I'm going to miss your cookies.

1097
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:43,065
And here's a picture of me,
so you won't forget what I look like.

1098
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:46,265
Of course, it isn't a very good likeness.
It was taken 20 years ago.

1099
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:50,173
- I'll never forget you, Aunt Miranda.
- Oh, of course you will.

1100
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:54,977
Please, Aunt Miranda,
I don't want to leave.

1101
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:03,651
Go on, now. Go on.
We haven't got all day.

1102
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,625
Here, honey.

1103
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,596
They're taking enough time. That kid
must have more clothes than I've got.

1104
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:18,968
- All set, kid?
- Yes.

1105
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:22,304
- Come on.
- Good-bye, Gwen. Good-bye, Aunt Miranda.

1106
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,345
So long, folks.
See you in church.

1107
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,676
Bye, Aloysius.
I'm going away.

1108
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:32,686
- I sure hate to see you go, Miss Rebecca.
- Oh, I'll be back.

1109
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,256
Sure, you will, honey.
And don't forget this.

1110
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:39,792
I won't.

1111
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,898
Take good care
of yourself, Rebecca.

1112
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:47,491
I will, Aunt Miranda.
I'm very self-reliant.

1113
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,570
Good-bye, darling.

1114
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:51,570
Come on.

1115
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:08,014
- Good morning, Gwen.
- Hello. Is Mr. Kent home?

1116
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:10,057
He'll be right out.

1117
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:14,356
- Well, good morning.
- I hate to be a bother,
but I had to see you.

1118
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,863
I was hoping I'd see you
before I went back to New York.

1119
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:19,991
- Gwen, what was wrong last night?
- Oh, I was rude, and I'm sorry.

1120
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,001
But that isn't what
I came over here for.

1121
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:25,004
Something terrible happened,
and you've got to help me. Rebecca's gone.

1122
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:27,109
Gone? But how?
What happened?

1123
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:29,244
Her stepfather came back
with a court order.

1124
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:31,403
But he can't take her.
I'm going to put her under contract.

1125
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,778
It's too late.
They've already gone to New York!

1126
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:37,647
- Come on and pack. We got to get Rebecca.
- All right.

1127
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:50,693
Baby Bath invites you to the premiere
of a new series of programs...

1128
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:54,564
starring that cheerful little earful,
Little Miss Universe.

1129
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:58,537
Remember, if you want
your child to have a perfect skin...

1130
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:01,871
use Baby Bath, The velvet soap.

1131
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:05,913
To start things off, smiling Frankie Lee
and his Baby Bathers...

1132
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:10,280
bring you that new song sensation,
"Wash Your Troubles Away."

1133
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:24,788
- Here we are, Mr. Purvis.
- Well, we're on our way, Kipper.

1134
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:28,597
You're a lucky man, Mr. Purvis.
If you handle the kid right,
she'll make you a fortune.

1135
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,636
You're lucky yourself
with this contract.

1136
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,264
We'd feel a lot luckier
if you'd give us a little advance.

1137
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:38,345
If Rebecca clicks tonight as
she did at rehearsal,
you'll get a big, fat check tomorrow.

1138
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:41,278
I still can't understand why you sold her
to me instead of to Kent.

1139
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,282
Well, first come,
first serve, Mr. Purvis.

1140
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:46,388
I've been waiting for a long time
to put something over on Tony Kent.

1141
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:51,824
Will he burn when he hears that his Little
Miss America is now my Little Miss Universe.

1142
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:58,196
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear me.

1143
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,794
- Anything wrong, mister?
- I'm almost a nervous breakdown.

1144
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,837
I get this way
before every program.

1145
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,169
Oh, are you going on
the radio now?

1146
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,777
Well, that's just what makes me
so nervous. I never know.

1147
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:11,640
Then why don't you
ask somebody?

1148
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,270
Well, they don't know either.

1149
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:16,384
This is certainly
a funny radio station.

1150
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,887
Why, my dear young lady,
there's nothing funny about in.

1151
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:25,517
lim an organist, one of the best,
if I may say so.

1152
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:30,428
- Hamilton Montmarcy.
Perhaps you've heard of me?
- I don't think so.

1153
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:33,558
Well, there you are. Nobody has.

1154
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:36,500
You see, I'm an emergency musician.

1155
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,606
But there's never
any emergencies around here.

1156
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:41,107
You mean, people get sick
and can't go on the radio?

1157
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:45,236
Well, that was the idea when they hated me,
but nobody ever gets sick around here.

1158
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:49,841
I've waited 10 months, and
there hasn't been so much as a bad cold.

1159
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:54,615
Don't worry, Mr. Montmarcy.
Somebody’ll be sick any day now!

1160
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:57,692
I certainly hope sp.

1161
01:09:57,826 --> 01:10:01,819
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

1162
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,394
- Gwen! Tony!
- Hello, honey.

1163
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,436
Darling! Oh!

1164
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:15,442
- Well!
- Purvis, you put over
a fast one, didn't you?

1165
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:19,480
- All's fair, you know, kent.
- I'll give goy &100,000
for Rebecca's contract.

1166
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:23,277
- Ha! Not a chance.
But, Mr. Purvis, this isn't
just a business matter.

1167
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,717
It is to me... big business

1168
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:28,220
Little Miss Universe
goes on the air in a minute.

1169
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:30,985
There's a couple of seats
in the auditorium, if you care to listen.

1170
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:35,957
A hundred thousand bucks,
and you had to sell her to Purvis.

1171
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,760
- Well, that's that.
- Can't I go back with you and Tony?

1172
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,766
I'm afraid not, darling.

1173
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:44,497
- At least not for a little while.
- But I don't wanna stay here.

1174
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:49,133
I know, but you can't always have everything
you want right when you want it.

1175
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:51,905
But we'll get you
back with us someday.

1176
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:55,039
I guess I won't be able
tp sing for you now, Tony.

1177
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,243
Mmm. Don't you worry
about that, honey.

1178
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:01,117
Singing for me isn't important anymore.
It's just that we want you with us.

1179
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,920
It may take time, so you've got to
be a brave little girl.

1180
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,257
- I will, Tony.
- We'll be listening to you,
so do your best.

1181
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:12,027
- Come on, Gwen.
- Good-bye, darling.

1182
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:18,038
All right.
Here's your cue.

1183
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:25,143
And here comes your cheerful little earful,
Little Miss Universe...

1184
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:28,717
bringing you that charming
melody, "Old Straw Hat".

1185
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:43,556
# If I had one wish to make #

1186
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:46,691
#This is the wish...#

1187
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:52,870
Let's try it again.

1188
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:55,875
Please.

1189
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:00,373
# If I had one wi...#

1190
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:09,719
Want to try it again?

1191
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:24,764
- What’s the matter with your voice/
- I can't talk.

1192
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:28,205
- What is the matter?
- Go on and sigh. Go on.
You're getting paid for it.

1193
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,676
- Do you want a glswof water?
- I can't talk.

1194
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:33,407
- Go on. Do something.
- What is the matter?

1195
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:36,382
- Sing in there.
- I can't talk.

1196
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,052
- Poor baby.
- I'll get a doctor.

1197
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:44,950
Hey. Montmarcy, you're on!
Studio "B".

1198
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:47,619
- I'm on? Oh.
- Yeah.

1199
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:52,393
Oh. Oh. Oh, I'm on.

1200
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,934
Oh, dear. I'm on.

1201
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,700
Oh. I'll be back in a minute.

1202
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,671
I'm on.

1203
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:07,877
Wonderful.

1204
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:10,075
Isn't it marvelous?

1205
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,153
How wonderful.

1206
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:24,461
You will now hear an organ recital
by Hamilton Montmarcy.

1207
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:37,811
Oh. Okay.

1208
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:41,413
Because of conditions
beyond our control...

1209
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,882
our program will continue
with selected recordings.

1210
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:46,817
- I knew something would go wrong.
- Shut up!

1211
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:48,855
- I can't...
- You shut up too!

1212
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:51,357
If you don't want the licking of your life,
tell me the truth.

1213
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:54,326
- Did Kent put you up to this?
- No. I can't talk.

1214
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,328
Kipper, you knew this
when you sold me the kid!

1215
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:59,332
I'll stake my professional integrity
that this is a frame-up.

1216
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:02,369
- Dr. Hill is here.
- Ah! Now we'll know
whether it's a frame-up or not.

1217
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:04,403
- Where's the patient?
- This little girl here.

1218
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,065
Well, you look healthy enough to me.
What's wrong with you?

1219
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:08,675
I can't talk.

1220
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:10,744
She claims something
happened to her voice.

1221
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:13,814
And, Doc, if the little brat's stalling,
I'll slather silly.

1222
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:16,713
Mmm, we'll see. Is there
someplace where I can examine her?

1223
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:18,717
You can examine her
right in here, Doctor.

1224
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:20,719
Thank you. Come on.

1225
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,684
I'm sorry.

1226
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:31,825
If this little girl is really sick,
you'll need a doctor too.

1227
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:36,831
- Where's Rebecca?
- She's in there with the doctor.

1228
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:57,055
- Oh, darling.
- What's wrong, honey?

1229
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:59,057
I can't t...

1230
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:06,024
- Well, Doc?
- Oh, there's no question about it.

1231
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:10,104
It's partly a psychogenic
condition, and partly the result
of straining the child's voice.

1232
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,137
Doc, you mean the kid can't work?

1233
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:14,742
Oh, she won't be able to sing
or even to talk very clearly.

1234
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:18,812
But with a complete rest for a year or two,
she may get over it.

1235
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:23,781
Well, Kipper, there's your contract.

1236
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,222
Don't you worry, honey.

1237
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,350
It's kind of fun to whisper anyway.

1238
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:35,861
Come in here, you two.

1239
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,232
Look, Kipper.
I think Rebecca should be with her aunt.

1240
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:46,101
After all, she's not
much use to you now.

1241
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:49,676
I'll give you $5,000 if you turn over
your legal guardianship to Aunt Miranda.

1242
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:52,211
Well, now, um, the kid
means a lot to me.

1243
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:54,212
- Don't be a sucker! Take it.
- Okay.

1244
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:56,214
Drop up to my office
in the morning.

1245
01:15:56,351 --> 01:16:00,651
- You can get the money
as soon as you sign the papers.
- How about a little advance?

1246
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:03,223
Here's a hundred dollars
to clinch the deal.

1247
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,393
Well, so long, kid.
See you in church.

1248
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,125
Thank you, Tony.

1249
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:15,759
I imagine these are the good friends
you told me about.

1250
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:17,929
Doctor, isn't there anything
we can do for Rebecca?

1251
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:19,971
That depends
on the circumstances.

1252
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:23,077
Sometimes these things
clear up rather suddenly.

1253
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,770
Good-bye.
Good night, Rebecca.

1254
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:30,510
Good-bye, Doctor. And thanks!
I hope I can do the same for you some day.

1255
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:33,177
Rebecca!

1256
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,688
What a smarty
you turned out tube.

1257
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:38,292
I always told you
I was very self-reliant.

1258
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:08,856
# Have you heard
Have you heard #

1259
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,255
# There's a new tooter in
with the tin-pan parade #

1260
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:13,486
# Pass the word
Pass the word #

1261
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,722
# 'Cause it's some
toy trumpet brigade #

1262
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:18,128
# Come along
Come along #

1263
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,359
# If you're soon enough
you'll hear him do his stuff #

1264
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:22,367
# Hurry up
Hurry up #

1265
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:24,869
# They will soon be here
They're getting nearer #

1266
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:26,941
# Here they come
Here they come #

1267
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,134
# Hear the hum of the drum
of the tin-pan parade #

1268
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,245
# Better run
Better run #

1269
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,746
# 'Cause it's some
toy trumpet brigade #

1270
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:35,941
# Here they are
There's the leader passing by
Isn’t he grand #

1271
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:38,245
# He's a star
He's the leader of the band #

1272
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:40,321
# There he goes with his trumpet
Tooting high, tooting low #

1273
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:42,582
# When he blows
He's a rooting tooting dandy #

1274
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:44,589
# Tooting low
Tooting high #

1275
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:46,887
# He's a new tooter in
with the tin-pan parade #

1276
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:49,122
# There they go
passing by #

1277
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,732
# That was some
toy trumpet brigade #
