1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,613
Timo, hey.
-Yes?

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,539
Could you turn on the projector?
-It's on

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,292
Where those hairs come from?
Again there's one on the lens

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,968
I don't know.
-Red hair

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,256
And it's curly.
-It's your erogenous hair

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,973
It's not, it's armpit hair

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,648
It is your penis hair,
blow it away

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,412
Good evening

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,975
Finnish trucker Reino Laakso -

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,455
has ended up in open conflict -

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,776
at Luxembourg's border station

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,098
A truck full of carrots has been -

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,291
denied entry to
the country by the customs

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,936
with too weak arguments
according to Laakso

15
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,575
Here're some great carrots
for Luxembourgians

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,611
(German gibberish)

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,378
What is loss?

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,616
Here's the car papers

19
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,212
Filthy car

20
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,650
Oh damn. You see, for 20 years -

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,499
I have done this work
and one thing I've learned -

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,258
is that to never give up

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,611
If need to deliver carrots to
Luxembourg I'm going to finish it

24
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,220
(gibberish)

25
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,770
Laakso's numerous contact attempts -

26
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,893
have been shrugged off
by Luxembourg's government

27
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,492
It's so that you can keep the carrots

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,014
Finland's EU-Commissioner
Erkki Liikanen disapproves -

29
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,576
both Laakso's and
Luxembourg goverment's actions

30
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,258
I think, I have to,
with this note -

31
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,974
touch my arse

32
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,610
I see

33
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,540
Luxembourgian ministers
have performed -

34
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,538
rituals that dishonor Finnishness

35
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,578
Klaus, just look.
-Good job

36
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,933
Finnish government has given
Luxembourg goverment -

37
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,132
an ultimatum. If profanity
doesn't come to an end -

38
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,128
Finland threatens
to adopt further secret measures

39
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,894
Esa.
-Moth has cocooned

40
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,374
Fox acknowledges

41
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,850
Listen up, it's best now
that girls go home

42
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,018
What? I haven't got anything yet

43
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,052
And Jari as well

44
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,571
Open, open away

45
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,055
Pirjo, could you
hand over those forceps

46
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,418
Open

47
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,208
Open, open, open

48
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,694
Kariluoto.
-Moth has cocooned

49
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,171
Hare acknowledges

50
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,689
Ilmo, Ilmo, you have a call

51
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,299
Ilmo

52
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,815
Lynx acknowledges

53
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,098
Mom, I must go now
-Oh my goodness

54
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,451
So this is what it meant when my
buttocks began to tickle terribly

55
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,616
Boy goes to war

56
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,533
Ilmo, Ilmo, I brought
you some lunch box

57
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,173
Oh you, mom

58
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,178
Don't worry about me,
I take care of myself

59
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,099
I'll be back by the hay-making
-So said you father -

60
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,418
and he only went to deliver
milk churns, never returned

61
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,010
Captain Rankkanen,
captain Rankkanen -

62
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,412
your suit has arrived
from washing

63
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,292
At ease

64
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,088
Fox?
-Here

65
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,376
Hare?
-Here

66
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,214
Lynx?
-Here

67
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,180
Cigarette man is always cigarette man

68
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,778
Your mission -

69
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,408
is to strike enemy's living
and materialistic force -

70
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,295
everywhere in the areas
that they are ruling

71
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,214
This mouse-shit here
is Luxembourg -

72
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,334
An area about the size of Forssa.
Know that -

73
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,336
even at this very moment they
are fucking us pretty harshly

74
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,177
It's the end now!

75
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,455
The mission will be accomplished
quickly and efficiently -

76
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,777
after which you will exit the area
according to your own judgment

77
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,659
Air Force will transport you
to the enemy's airspace

78
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,897
At 19:30 your parachutes
will open, any questions?

79
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,452
Check your clocks

80
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,493
Dismissed!

81
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,052
And remember!

82
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,129
Today the shit rang here too
and called me gay

83
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,212
Even if I was gay -

84
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,729
there's no need to tell it to me

85
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,775
Oh Sibelius,
oh, Juha Mieto...

86
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,490
Please

87
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,409
Please

88
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,575
Dear passengers, prepare
to jump in 30 seconds

89
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,368
Weather is beautiful
at Luxembourg, but partly cloudy

90
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,095
Captain Rantala and crew
wish a successful jump

91
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,249
The most important is that
we were not detected

92
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,530
It's only an advantage

93
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,369
Have to burrow.
-And fast

94
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,571
Watch out, right side

95
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,660
Don't recall me,
I take care of my plot

96
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,252
This is quite rally

97
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,530
No boys, rally is
something very different

98
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,569
He has bought some
random tires worth 50 marks -

99
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,089
from some junkyard

100
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,458
When Stefa installs it's precise.
-As always

101
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,570
There's no time to lose now.
-As always

102
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,693
What?

103
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,498
What, what?

104
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,657
It's fun to have spot check here

105
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,251
It's joy to give you fines

106
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,415
Radar stops you,
it stimulates us

107
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,010
Here's the end of your ride

108
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,291
It's fun to breathalyze drunkards

109
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,096
We are hepaticas of the roads

110
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,050
We may loosen your plates,
it refreshes us -

111
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,616
if can dry up the licence

112
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,012
Fines, fines,
great fines

113
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,576
We don't skimp,
we gladly give -

114
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,251
fines, fines,
fines to everybody

115
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,051
Come and get yours

116
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,492
Hey dudes, you hear?
You hear me?

117
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,613
Yes we hear

118
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,408
Quite cold is here,
quite cold is here

119
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,576
Yes. -Shall we exchange?
Shall we exchange?

120
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,131
In a minute. -Let's exchange
already. Let's exhange already

121
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,257
In a minute

122
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,978
Dudes, now some 96 comes
at least 600 mph

123
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,298
I guess it's red, perhaps red

124
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,978
To what hell's rally
are you going to?

125
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,490
Nordics rally

126
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:02,811
Red Opel Kadett HKR-420,
child is screaming inside

127
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,255
Release the child

128
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,250
Have a good rally to you

129
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,578
Girls, after the final race
at the hotel a bit...

130
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,895
You are just awful

131
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,216
Hi there

132
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,257
This is the place for signing up?

133
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,089
Oh fuck, I have eaten
cabbage casserole 4 days straight -

134
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,213
my stomach's upset.
-Class, certificate and licence

135
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,737
A-group.
-Have you got any charcoal tablets -

136
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,090
my stomach's messed up

137
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,373
Sorry but I only have
a full tube of rectal wax

138
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,539
These are fine, have a
good rally. -Yes thanks

139
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,776
Was there any trouble?
-Nope

140
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,456
Well what then? -I was just
looking at those other teams

141
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,459
Well what about them?
-They are quite clowns

142
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,051
Sure are

143
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,851
...already 35 times

144
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:16,096
Five, four, three,
two, one, drive

145
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,608
Oh darn.
-Go to push

146
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,496
Moisio, third gear, clutch down -

147
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,134
when car moves, clutch up

148
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,929
Clutch... Brake

149
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,057
Right, different fast,
left, different fast

150
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,249
75 right, flat out

151
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,418
Over 50, jump, right fast

152
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,212
Where are we?

153
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,576
Bottom of the bank,
right's okay, left down, up

154
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,055
Left full speed forward,
not fast

155
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,975
Left fast, this is most of all
goddamn curvy road

156
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,653
Pull your owns.
-Right

157
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,055
I could pull one cigarette
during this interval

158
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,457
If okay?
-Hey, this stick snapped

159
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,694
Well then, let's replace it.
Stefa will do

160
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,697
That's precise

161
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,811
Hey, clutch's gone.
Could you steer? -Okay

162
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,178
To right

163
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,978
To left.
-Stefa

164
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,814
New clutch. Stefa's working on it

165
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,817
That's precise.
-Right

166
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,137
Hey, cigarette dropped

167
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,655
Bench is burning.
-Stefa will take care of it

168
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,939
Foam to the eggs

169
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,856
I'm foamed all over

170
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,012
Ha, ha, looking good

171
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,649
Really fast, hundred

172
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,454
Right down,
left full speed

173
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,050
Really embarrassing to say but...

174
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,940
Of course you can go and pee now

175
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,936
May Day drink is?

176
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,660
That's mead

177
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,853
Mead

178
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,495
"Tsorry."
-That's ok

179
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,896
It was very difficult
and hard race

180
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,056
We had some troubles
with the tires

181
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,376
But the team is
working very fine -

182
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,935
and I'm drinking and
fucking all the time

183
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,335
I heard that Carlos
is coming very strong

184
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,135
Anyway I think that if I try my
best we're gonna win this race

185
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,138
Tomorrow of course I'm
gonna have lot of troubles -

186
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,776
because I'm gonna have
hangover and some other diseases

187
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,972
But I think that anyway
it's gonna be alright

188
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,091
Well boys, there's
nothing to worry about

189
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,452
We are less than 5 minutes
behind the second last

190
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,896
I'll put 20x bigger nozzles -

191
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,056
and I think we'll make it
to winner's podium

192
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,020
That's great when team functions
well and we get feedback

193
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,336
We have had good thing going today

194
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,735
We come strong and
aggressively to the curves

195
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,215
But need to get out of there

196
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,372
Lampinen, you have to be able
to tighten your map reading

197
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,618
It's great when team functions
well and we get feedback

198
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,333
And need to give that to you

199
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,610
What do you think those
other teams are doing?

200
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,776
They also give feedback
to their drivers

201
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,574
It's not enough to
be born as winner -

202
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,214
but we need to polish the diamond

203
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,413
You know?
-Yeah

204
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,214
Did we come here to
win or lose? -We did

205
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,899
Lampinen, hey?
-Yeah

206
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,931
Go to reserve those
hotel rooms now -

207
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,018
so we can get some sleep.
-Okay. Give money

208
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,017
What money? -Give cash

209
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,690
Take from the sponsor funds.
-Which sponsor fund?

210
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,098
This car is full of stickers.
You have sold advertizing space...

211
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,178
Lampinen, tell me what is sponsoring?

212
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,052
Sponsoring?
-Yes?

213
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,333
It's a kind of modern marketing -

214
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,454
where athlete or someone such -

215
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,697
obtains stickers or fabric brands

216
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,575
Right. I see

217
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,932
Don't say that you have
let the stickers to be -

218
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,098
glued on the car for free!
-No, I sure paid for them

219
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,731
Hey, the main thing is,
that the team works, yes?

220
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,250
I'm going to pee now

221
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,735
After that we'll take
one more tier

222
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,250
Then we all go to
a restaurant to eat lamb

223
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,094
So those boys slept
their night in the car

224
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,655
They didn't mind

225
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,170
That's how they
had done it before

226
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,418
Look at that, I guess
we are last right in the morning

227
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,937
They trusted their
mechanic like stone wall

228
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,611
Because he knew his red Saab
like his own mother

229
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,176
I have had -99 model

230
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,848
But that's different.
-I know that

231
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,097
That mechanic didn't
run out of tricks

232
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,614
I left the keys inside by the way

233
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,057
Wouldn't have needed the second one

234
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,615
If Stefa takes care, it's precise

235
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,934
Let it be

236
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,256
With this the competition
will get fiercer -

237
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,577
because I'm pouring nitro
into the fuel tank, Moisio

238
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,259
Thank you

239
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,776
Yes, this kind of lighter bodywork -

240
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,050
needs a little bit wider tires

241
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,728
50 full speed up

242
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,139
(unclear driving instructions)

243
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,450
50 over hillock

244
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,379
Right fast, 100 down

245
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,852
What? What you said?

246
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,734
(gibberish)

247
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,969
Well this is clear advantage to us

248
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,694
Spare weight away, Stefa leaves

249
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,178
Fuck, I think
they won't come anymore

250
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,735
No they won't come,
let's take the rag down -

251
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,500
and let's go home

252
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,614
I wonder what yummy my wife
has made from potatoes today?

253
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,574
Oh fuck, surely we have
fucking dill meat again

254
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,053
Wait now, we'll make it
together to the finish line

255
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,851
It's quite a bit the same, are
we doing it together or separate

256
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,218
Stefa takes care, it'll be precise.
-Right

257
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,172
Yea, that is precise

258
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,738
Like that

259
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,696
Oh, hey, coming

260
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,176
So they do

261
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,010
Let's go to watch Cindy Crawford
video at my trailer

262
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,495
I keep myself fit with that

263
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,176
No, no, need no,
we need no team, nor group

264
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,975
No, no, we don't follow Vatanen

265
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,616
Leather suit doesn't squeeze balls,
this is heavenly rally

266
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,490
Now the end is spark plug changing
and messing with the oil

267
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,056
Map reading was shitty job,
never learnt it

268
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,976
Couldn't care less, whole
stepping on the gas pisses me off

269
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,775
Now past is cruising,
devil's gnashing has come to an end

270
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,009
No, no, we need no team, nor group

271
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,696
No, no, we don't follow Vatanen

272
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,290
Leather suit doesn't squeeze balls,
this is heavenly rally

273
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,212
No, no, we need no team, nor group

274
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,856
No, no, we don't follow Vatanen

275
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,656
Leather suit doesn't squeeze balls,
this is heavenly rally

276
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,856
Try and hit the right once in awhile

277
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,778
I guess I have eyes on my head

278
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,130
Yes, two and third in the ass

279
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,497
Boys, come to eat

280
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,617
They are seriously
trying to rush through

281
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,617
We'll make them
quiet down eventually

282
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,936
Alright then, welcome to the
inauguration of the dugout

283
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,415
There's like wedding here or what?

284
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,330
Here's ammo and supplies storage.
-Yea-a

285
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,289
On the left,
naturally next to the door -

286
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,172
gun rack

287
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,374
I laid 1.5 meters of
concrete above -

288
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,935
so it's nice to loll here

289
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,536
I was thinking if
Kari would sleep here

290
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,014
This is stove, don't
burn your ass, it's hot

291
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,892
Whose rario is that?

292
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,056
It is radio.
-So

293
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,139
Alright, here's the holiest
of the holies, the dining area

294
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,416
Ilmo, if you could sleep there -

295
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,611
then I could sleep there
in the corner

296
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,970
This is rather practical -

297
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,296
but quite conventional

298
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,333
This sort of shitty outhouses
these have been for 50 years

299
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,735
But this isn't even ready yet

300
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,500
Or what Esa?
-No

301
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,808
I cooked some whitefish for you

302
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,056
I don't like fish at all

303
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,139
Wife ordered me to say that
I'm allergic to fish

304
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,460
Nevertheless I did it according
to couple city boys' recipe

305
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,098
Naked, naked,
soon everyone are naked,

306
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,408
Naked, naked...
-Very good evening to everyone

307
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,657
And welcome to watch
entertainment show: Naked

308
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,534
For fifth week in a row
in the studio -

309
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,050
brothers Kulkerson Kille and Kalle

310
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,410
And their opponent today -

311
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,815
gentleman who doesn't
pee to his socks: -

312
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,738
mister Jortikka

313
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,694
What made you decide to
take part in this?

314
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,209
I didn't have any idea to come -

315
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,412
but our neighbor Pete Mulkvisti
registered us here

316
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,214
Very nicely done by Pete.
What hobbies you have?

317
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,617
Well, mainly graphics.
-What sort of graphics?

318
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,175

319
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,657
Lovely hobby and now to
the business, a question:

320
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,454
Who was the first person -

321
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,299
who performed naked on screen?

322
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,897
Mister Jortikka has an answer.
-Buster Keaton

323
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,855
Wrong answer, sock off!

324
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,295
I'm embarrassed for them.
-So am I

325
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,451
Noble fish swims drowsily to my net,
fresh salted salmon in my thoughts

326
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,538
Blazed salmon, smoked salmon, salmon,
broiled salmon fins -

327
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,095
and of course, salmon soup

328
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,893
This Pentti Ahvanainen's poem is
certainly about experienced life -

329
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,136
but could it be reality -

330
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,298
also to us ordinary fishermen?
-Surely it can, Timo

331
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,060
Already thousands of fishermen
all over the world trust -

332
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,854
this new invention and now
we got it here in Finland

333
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,177
Catch-a-fish, unbelievable lure,
all fish grasp to it -

334
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,450
in salty as well as in freshwater

335
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,936
He gutting the fish...
-How much is whitefish per kilo?

336
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,700
In blink of an eye Catch-a-fish
prepares a fish meal

337
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,017
Shall we ring?
-Chops wood, fills tax return

338
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,415
My life was changed by Catch-a-fish

339
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,770
Night-frosts
in the bedroom are history

340
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,175
New wife fishes
with Catch-a-fish also

341
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,895
Sure thing. -Can I
order Catch-a-fish from you?

342
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,898
Yes.
-Frankly

343
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,455
Generously. Sixteen
-Twenty

344
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,457
Twenty it is

345
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,254
Here's great sports car
for the boys

346
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,212
We need a car -

347
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,695
that manages a more
challenging circumstances

348
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,253
So, a jeep?
-Yeah

349
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,418
Here we actually have a
unbeatable model

350
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,976
But unfortunately it costs.
-It doesn't matter

351
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,297
This kind of tire spins easily

352
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,968
Not necessarily,
because this has 4-wheel drive

353
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,699
What does it mean?

354
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,368
It means that
all wheels are tensile

355
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,691
Four wheels.
-But is this good?

356
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,733
Not just good,
but this is the best

357
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,169
We take this

358
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,052
And final sum
including accessories -

359
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,492
in cash is 499,499 marks

360
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,458
Thank you

361
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,698
Well then
it's still missing 1000 marks

362
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,573
Thank you

363
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,568
Boys are looking for boat right?
-Yes, for trolling

364
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,012
This is unbeatable,
but surely not the cheapest

365
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,775
Well, it doesn't matter
but is it good?

366
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,050
This is the best.
-We take this

367
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,298
Let's go and find
a proper engine for it

368
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,493
Stop, stop, stop, stop

369
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,778
This here's The engine

370
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,654
Isn't there normally
2 engines on a trolling boat?

371
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:28,489
Not necessarily. 4-stroke engine
doesn't choke even on low speeds

372
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,578
It's probably cheaper?
-Not necessarily

373
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,175
Well it doesn't matter anything.
Is it good?

374
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,371
This is the best.
-We take this

375
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,014
So then let's go to
look at accessories

376
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,296
499,070

377
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,897
How we get the boat to the shore?
-With a trailer

378
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,898
We take such.
-Okay then

379
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,889
This is missing 1000

380
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,092
It's going to be warm day

381
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,336
I think I'll sunbathe
without shirt

382
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,577
May I wax your back?
-Yes that would be nice

383
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,457
What's that rock pile?
-I don't know

384
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,734
(background song lyrics:)
"I met you on the beach then"

385
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,295
"and soon we were holding hands"

386
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,652
This is how it goes.
-Codger

387
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,130
Hey codger,
you think you're getting fish?

388
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,894
This runs pretty sweet.
-This is the best

389
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,613
Sure is

390
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,013
Manu.
-Yes?

391
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,176
We could do some spinning here

392
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,217
Could you drop the anchor?

393
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,017
Well of course we
can do trolling too

394
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,615
Did these cost a lot?
-Sure did

395
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,691
Doesn't matter

396
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,295
Oh damn.
-What?

397
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,336
That Mao Zedung is
catching fish like crazy

398
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,931
Sure is

399
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,049
Oh goddamnit.
-What now?

400
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,093
That's the boat seller.
-Show me

401
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,660
Lumumbas.
-Looks like

402
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,496
How about we will just troll

403
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,131
Last Catch-a-fish

404
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,931
We won't get anything

405
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,218
Hey

406
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,370
What? -It's a fish

407
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,850
Take the net.
-I will, I will

408
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,336
That's it

409
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,978
Pull, pull

410
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,250
Start pulling.
Reel in, reel in

411
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,739
It's a fish. It is big.
-What is it?

412
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,976
Use the net now.
-What is it?

413
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,456
Ui-jui.
-Good, good

414
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,219
Nice.
-Is it roach?

415
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,571
No it's whitefish.
-Whitefish, okay, okay

416
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,895
Drop it there.
-Handsome fish

417
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,098
Hey shall we take glasses of
sherry in the honor of this?

418
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,456
Oh my

419
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,653
Should we kill it?
-No, let it live

420
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,932
It's fun to breathalyze drunkards

421
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,819
we are hepaticas of the roads

422
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,696
We may loosen your plates,
it refreshes us -

423
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,531
if can dry up the licence

424
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,736
Fines, fines,
great fines,

425
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,536
We don't skimp,
we gladly give -

426
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,375
Fines, fines,
fines to everybody,

427
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,299
come and get yours

428
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,374
You seem to have
all kinds of gadgets -

429
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,650
but, I don't see
the most important -

430
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,694
there're no life jackets,
no anchor, no paddle

431
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,010
But soon you got fines. -Ask
do they have fishing licence

432
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,371
Do they have fishing licence?
-No

433
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,658
I guessed that.
-You go and breathalyze them

434
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,448
Sure, I go and breathalyze them

435
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,777
Yes, you got 2.6 per mills together -

436
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:50,815
so 1.7 per man

437
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,853
So there are quite
generous fines upcoming -

438
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,938
that we will go to count them
while we have a coffee break

439
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,530
Would you give that sherry
bottle from the cooler?

440
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,057
You don't move anywhere
and wait right here

441
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,449
Well then Osku, look at
what came out from oven

442
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,731
Hasn't it gotten a bit smaller?

443
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,295
Things always shrivel a bit
in hot. -My dear

444
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,416
Take gadgets away

445
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,132
This is good looking

446
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,570
Have you thought about
becoming fighter jet pilot?

447
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,738
Look. -By buying this
for 60 billion per piece -

448
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,977
you'll be part of project,
that makes you fighter jet ace

449
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,738
And that's not all -

450
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,818
pilots are traditionally
firm ladies' men

451
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,698
Should we ring?

452
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,496
One.
-Two...

453
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,856
Five.
-Six

454
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,652
Sorry about interrupting the movie -

455
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,976
but our sponsor
has something to say

456
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,011
Och samma på svenska, ursäkta -
(And same in Swedish, excuse me -)

457
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,734
sponsoren har någonting att säga
(sponsors have nothing to say)

458
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,019
This is Pastirol-day.
A day that will be remembered

459
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,892
With the income from
that commercial we are able to -

460
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,893
finance the next scene.
Please, var so god (please in Swedish)

461
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,573
Dear viewers -

462
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,931
in every ambitious Finnish movie -

463
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,779
boobs are shown.
Please

464
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,217
After the end credits
there will be some more boobs

465
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,053
In hopes that the movie producers
wouldn't be seen as chauvinists -

466
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,854
here's some eye candy for womenfolk

467
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,254
4000 years ago at Hellaa -

468
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,928
young men gathered to compete -

469
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,256
in following sports:

470
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,179
wrestling, discus throwing
and javeling

471
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,379
Women weren't let in to the stadion,
because the athletes were -

472
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,572
naked

473
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,815
No doubt that being at war
is the best action -

474
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,534
that a man can do with
his pants on. -That's true

475
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,731
And ice hockey is another

476
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,978
Our town has a team
called Kangasalan Voitto

477
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,695
It was used to be coached by
rather pricey codger, Esko

478
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,780
I recall when they
went to one memorable game

479
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,615
Dear gentlemen, it's
a new season ahead -

480
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,698
and new gimmicks

481
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,178
We can't let the relegation
to the 6th division -

482
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,291
discourage our minds

483
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,570
Instead for tonight's match -

484
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,533
we go to chest in arc
and victory in mind

485
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,336
Our team has gotten
some foreign reinforcement

486
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,015
From Alaska's farm league
an actual "pencil man" -

487
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,491
mister Begining.
-Hello everybody

488
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,372
Tonight's tactics -

489
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,253
is based on Napoleon's
and Hitler's gambits -

490
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,735
as well as Raattentie battles

491
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,699
We are not going to
attack for nothing -

492
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,811
to the enemy's territory -

493
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,659
but we give the puck for
the enemy at the faceoff

494
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,374
We switch to turtle defence

495
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,572
And when the enemy
approaches our blue line -

496
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,856
the attackers
skate via the wing -

497
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,937
and strike enemy's back

498
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,859
Preferably by cross-checking.
-Listen to coach

499
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,132
In the meanwhile the defenders
hide behind the net -

500
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,138
and reveal themselves to
the enemy when they reach -

501
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,695
our goalie area

502
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,891
If they nevertheless score -

503
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,536
fat-Salonen will be exchanged.
Any questions?

504
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,534
Esko, shall I give you
your own sports drink?

505
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,970
No need to

506
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,651
Hey listen Kalle, don't put more

507
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,454
It's the last tape of the firm

508
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,130
Alright then let's do it

509
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,093
Good luck. Close the wings

510
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,530
Put helmet on, boy

511
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,416
Good spirits

512
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,333
Try to try even

513
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,497
"Raipe" is iron.
No penalties, Summanen

514
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,658
Good ice hockey.
Thank you very much

515
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,659
Let's fuck.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey....

516
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,893
Good job dudes,
just catch them

517
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,694
Go to the barbershop tomorrow.
This is our game

518
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,370
Catch him!

519
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,815
You, do something,
I don't pay for nothing

520
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,295
Let's fuck.
-Thank you very much

521
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,531
I kill you

522
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,576
Go, go, go

523
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,135
Oh well here we go again

524
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,253
What?
Hey, mister referee

525
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,858
Mister referee! It wasn't my
fault, it was the other guy

526
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,928
You, back.
-Thank you very much

527
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,212
Raipe, do you think should we
put more blade to the lubricant?

528
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,616
Give me the drink.
-Here you go

529
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,291
They have a phone call for me.
-Alright

530
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,776
Is everything alright
with your equipments?

531
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,016
I mean in equipments?
-Yeah, shit man

532
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,051
Perfect

533
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,656
Game, game

534
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,417
Shit, man

535
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,215
Zero five, who cares.
Finnish boy will still rise

536
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,094
Remember Syväri, Raatteentie
(Winter war battle location)

537
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,689
Ã…land Islands war was terrible

538
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,050
Sumppi, you had
your screws loose again

539
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,218
This is now
at it's biggest, try

540
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,092
It's good.
-It is?

541
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,813
Yes.
-Well I guessed that

542
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,094
Raipe, look I rockered
really proper curves for you

543
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,095
You could even shave your beard

544
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,458
Fuck the shit,
fuck the shit, fuck the shit

545
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,413
Hey, Alaska, Alaska

546
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,291
No penalties anymore.
-No penaltys, yes

547
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,180
No penalty.
-"Ei jehuje?"

548
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,059
Yes, yes.
-Couch, thank you very much

549
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,774
Be good, good spirits

550
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,531
Mister referee, it was...

551
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,538
Mister referee.
-So calm down then

552
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,812
Don't you see it was a kick goal?

553
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,617
He scored,
I'm going to beat that bloke

554
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,735
Stoneblind owl-referee

555
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,216
It was a kick goal, get it?

556
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,458
Score. -You see anything?
What sign is this?

557
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,776
Spirits are good

558
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,215
Good spirits end now,
get down from there

559
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,971
No tearing.
-Let go

560
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,253
Let go

561
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,293
Here's little bit...

562
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,695
Hey Begining,
that 99 there, kill him

563
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,619
Don't take that now.
-Sure, coach

564
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,732
Let's see how Alaska boy shines

565
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,612
Hey, coach, what you doing, man?

566
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,288
Good looking bitch you got.
-Yeah. That's my wife

567
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,172
Then what?
-That's my wife

568
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,098
Monkey, you just got beaten up

569
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,531
That's not fair.
-Shut up!

570
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,173
That's not fair.
-Shut up!

571
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,940
You are fired, you're fired

572
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,093
Summanen doesn't go anywhere

573
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,450
You're fired,
you are over-aged anyways

574
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,338
Helminen also

575
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,496
Esko is running so hot -

576
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,613
that it's better
that you go to that direction

577
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,534
Jonna, take a snap?

578
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,210
You can pull until that mark there

579
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,772
Okay then, I take myself

580
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,695
I'm able to do a handstand

581
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,688
Do you want to see? Take a look

582
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,578
Oh honey, please, help me.
-Joanna

583
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,294
Let's go home, back to Arkansas.
-Yeah

584
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,737
Hey, take your bitch monkey,
and go back to Alaska

585
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,338
Damn. This is starting
to be done for tonight

586
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,849
I'm moving to Pori next year,
to coach Porin Karhut

587
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:10,133
Peekaboo, how are you monkeys?

588
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,610
Weird jobs "hammeli"

589
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,257
Esko, isn't it best
that you went home?

590
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,851
I can't,
the game isn't finished yet

591
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,978
Väinö, let's pull the finger trap.
-Hell no

592
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,455
Let's put the man on the ice

593
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,735
Just sit very near

594
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,974
Go on, Salonen.
-Esko, don't you go there

595
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,490
Now I go on the ice

596
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,489
There's no problem here

597
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,932
End came.
-Oh no, Esko

598
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,136
That's alright

599
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,732
Salonen to the net

600
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,768
Salonen to the net

601
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,772
Five, four, three -

602
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,892
two, one, zero

603
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,499
Ow-owowow

604
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,011
Bus is coming

605
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,171
Fellas...

606
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,133
What do you think of
our new kitchen?

607
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,375
Under these conditions a
damn good performance by me

608
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,737
This is a bit awkward to say -

609
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,374
but I think this is
quite artificially made

610
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,377
Not my taste.
-Not mine either

611
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:32,698
I see. Well, I thought that
today we would eat lightly

612
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,937
Here's the season's salad,
gravlax rosette

613
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,650
As dessert, strawberries
and cherries on meringue bed

614
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,772
Fucking dude, do you think -

615
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,733
that we get enough for warfare
from this rabbit food?

616
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,608
Damn, quite a crackle
you have arranged

617
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,693
Tried to hit my head with
this potato mashing mallet -

618
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,176
but I managed to catch it
at the last minute

619
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,417
I'm not hungry afterall,
I go to keep guard

620
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,898
Reporter Oy Mauno Ahonen Yleisradio Ab

621
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,932
Is the reporter hungry?
Table is set here

622
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,890
Oh well, I should manage to produce
some shitty report to the airwaves

623
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,091
But why not

624
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,098
Looks like all silverware
is already set

625
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,972
"Hilirimpsis" (bottoms up!)

626
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:25,093
Ruffino Chianti, 11.6 years

627
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,973
Goddamnit, dudes have drinks
available like at Kaanaa wedding -

628
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,819
Only Jesus is missing, naturally

629
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,889
Show me what you are reading there,
Commando comics?

630
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,297
No, I'm just trying to study.
-I see

631
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,539
Even it is Friday -

632
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,609
we are not on vacation yet

633
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,449
Good morning

634
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,293
Banana fly's importance -

635
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,899
in the field of genetics -

636
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,653
can never be over-estimated, Sami

637
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,131
Czech monk Gregori Mendel -

638
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,415
whom shouldn't be mixed up with -

639
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,417
later influencer -

640
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:18,295
Mengele-named fella...
-Good arse

641
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:23,530
...was master of peas and flies, Sami

642
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,499
Let's write down
the most important terms

643
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,654
Mitosis and meijosis
(wrong on purpose)

644
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,890
Mitochondriasis (wrong on purpose)

645
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,374
"Tsygootti" (fertilized egg)

646
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:56,458
Conjugation, stamen.
Sami, I have about had enough

647
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:03,216
There's specific amount
of chromosomes -

648
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:07,772
which transform to diploid
during intercourse, Sami!

649
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:13,774
Huh! I've been nicely the
whole time, it's that Keinonen

650
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,136
Exit my class!

651
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,170
It's Spiidi playing with
those gadgets all the time!

652
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:23,333
Out! U-L-O-S!

653
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,176
Yes, suspend it

654
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,493
Goodbye, wind nest.
-Keinonen

655
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:34,691
Why this fly has red eyes?

656
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,179
Let's see, it's probably
a communist fly -

657
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,338
having a terrible hangover.

658
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,012
Right

659
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:54,298
Well, Sakari Ã–stermalm -

660
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:59,654
why this fly has yellow wings?

661
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:07,012
Sakari, don't say you're sleeping?

662
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:14,097
Sakari Ã–stermalm,
why fly has yellow wings?

663
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,491
Good day

664
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:34,216
Hey, look. Soikkeli.
-Hey moron, come here -

665
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:37,332
and let's talk about planes

666
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,415
Hey Soikkeli, what are we
going to do in woodshop?

667
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,258
How's band saw doing?

668
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:47,135
Today is Friday, for you it's
Good Friday (Long Friday literally)

669
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,376
Pain

670
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,018
Go and get Höylä

671
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,971
Hey, Höylä

672
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,417
Could you come and
check our previous work?

673
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,290
We have kind of a surprise

674
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,013
Yes, I like surprises

675
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,098
Höylä, could I
already take this home?

676
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,929
Do you think that that
sta-starling fits in from this?

677
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,938
Does it need to fit to go in too?
I thought they only come out

678
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,937
Don't your hear bell rang already?
-Yes yes

679
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:00,098
Go home with that goldeneye-nest.
-Happy weekend

680
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,575
Happy week-e-e-end

681
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,294
So, "silvuplee" to you too, thanks

682
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,930
Soikkeli is good and waits there

683
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,938
Yep

684
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,096
Yep, yep.
-Yep

685
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,334
Gee, boys have a ca-ca-ca-canoe

686
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,538
Not actually. -This is
sophisticated, who is this?

687
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,732
It's the metal works teacher

688
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,300
Just kidding, it's rubber

689
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,697
Let's remove the lid.
-Very elegant decor

690
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,811
Is this leop-leop-leopard?

691
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,090
No, it's "geopard" (cheetah).
-I see

692
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,212
Quadraphonic stereos.
-Yes, I got those in my car

693
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,696
You did, or I mean you do. In the middle
there's support for small of the back

694
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,891
Soikkeli is good and experiments

695
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,170
I don't think so.
-Harri goes now

696
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,575
Well okay then.
-Please, please

697
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,697
It's like made for the teacher.
-Quite suit-suited

698
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,772
Let's try...
-Just fine

699
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,978
Does the teacher know
who is Houdini? -I don't

700
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,296
That is good

701
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,651
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep

702
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,972
Soikkeli,
prepare for an art pleasure

703
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,335
Here comes our demo

704
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,648
Summer hit, Doomsday

705
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,696
On an infinite cassette

706
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,209
Open.
-Good day

707
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,977
Good morning, students

708
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,531
Good morning, mister Aarnio

709
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:58,695
It's another
tough workweek ahead

710
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:05,130
It's not beginning on
very bright circumstances

711
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,938
Is anyone having
pangs of conscience?

712
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:18,056
Loved workshop teacher,
Harri "Höylä" Soikkeli -

713
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,975
has been barred
in his workshop class

714
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,856
But we are letting
Harri himself to tell -

715
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:31,690
what happened and
name the guilty ones

716
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:45,174
On Friday afternoon
I was helding last -

717
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:49,134
workshop cl-cl-class

718
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:56,170
When two per-per... who
shall remain nameless...

719
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,376
persons...

720
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:12,808
When Harri's able to tell what happened,
the guilty ones will be punished

721
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:17,289
Next, traditional morning prayers -

722
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,730
is going to be held by -

723
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:23,376
loved religion and
sports teacher, Sampo Ekman

724
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,020
When I came
to school this morning -

725
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,973
I watched how little squirrel -

726
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:40,135
collected cones to store

727
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,856
Then I said to myself -

728
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,178
look Sampo, this is how it is -

729
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:51,133
also in humans' lives

730
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:58,693
We have to collect
life-cones to life's store

731
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,216
And morning prayers music
is performed -

732
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:07,971
by Sakari Ã–stermalm and Pertti.
-Thanks

733
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,810
Cool outfit

734
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:17,250
This our piece somewhat
relates to those life-cones

735
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,814
In a way, it's name is Doomsday

736
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,858
Galaxies blow up

737
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,416
and Keinonen descends
to punish everyone

738
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,895
Skeletons rise from their graves

739
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,900
Keinonen is released from his chains

740
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,649
Doomsday,
Doomsday -

741
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,130
it's Keinonen's name day

742
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,729
It's Doomsday,
it's Doomsday

743
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,456
Pertti's name day

744
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:05,568
That was flik flak -series.
This lecture's subject

745
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,020
Even though the move
is very simple -

746
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,339
we must recall,
that it begins -

747
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,650
from the hips

748
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:18,169
When we play baseball?

749
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,691
Not on the spring term, now
we practise flik flak -series

750
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,109
The first one is Sakari Ã–stermolm

751
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:29,834
Well, how about Pärtti.
-Alright

752
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,360
So the movement
begins from the hips

753
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,676
Indeed.
-Yes, from deep

754
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,836
Can we play baseball already?

755
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:46,915
Alright Pärtti, it's best
to forget that flik flak now

756
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,998
Focus on the bar,
this also is pelvis sport

757
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,671
And let go

758
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,878
Yes, don't brake

759
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:00,071
We still spin Keinonen, or
could we play baseball already?

760
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,198
Okay then, the slow ones
should also be ready by now

761
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,631
Who would come to translate
this sentence on the board?

762
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,552
Keinonen Pertti, please.
-With pleasure, teacher

763
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,555
Sami, say in two ways -

764
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,149
a horse, that runs

765
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,357
Häst, hästen springer -

766
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,149
som hösten,
it's at least one and...

767
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,796
Häst...
I can't figure out another

768
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,200
Sakari,
could you help Sami a bit?

769
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,399
En häst, som springer
(a horse, that runs)

770
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,474
Or from the same motif, using
the present participle -

771
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:34,110
en springande häst (a running horse)
-Very good, Sakari

772
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,353
And, looks like
Pertti is done already

773
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,233
Yes teacher, jag är allt färdigt här
(I'm all finished here)

774
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,750
And the sentence was approximately:
widespread, uniform -

775
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,633
and rectangular color surfaces
are... -No doubt

776
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,798
...no doubt very mondrianic,
and same in Swedish

777
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,714
Och samma på svenska
(And same in Swedish)

778
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,676
(reads what's on board
very fast in Swedish)

779
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,559
Alright then,
could you still write -

780
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,070
that dressmakers are slow
and oh my pincers

781
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,478
Oh my pincers.
-And, voluntary homeworks' -

782
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,955
feedback right after the class

783
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,993
And Sami has
remedial teaching tomorrow

784
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,712
Tack så bra (thanks a lot)

785
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,034
Sakari had written
about space shuttles'

786
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,073
fuel systems,
it was very good Swedish -

787
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,794
but somewhat
too technical subject

788
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,468
Nevertheless 9 and half

789
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,516
Is the teacher married?
-Oh my Sakari -

790
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,996
those are my personal affairs

791
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,197
I didn't know that
Pertti is such a romantic

792
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,949
Wonderful poems, especially
this, "your blue eyes sake" -

793
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:58,630
was just charming.
-It's about a teacher

794
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:02,391
For daring to have feelings,
9 and half

795
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,151
Good day

796
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,796
I'm sickly excited.
-I'm so much in love

797
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,719
See, I did a napkin holder
for the teacher

798
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,639
Perfect. -Hey, now she comes,
now she comes

799
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,752
Oh my vitals.
-I'll give her life-cones

800
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,318
Teacher? Teacher?

801
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,556
Austere

802
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,838
Oh, life's harsh cones -

803
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,873
that is sickest,
that I've never seen

804
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,037
Went through quite a heavy
human relationship there, yes?

805
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,750
You wrote surprisingly good lyrics
for Doomsday by the way

806
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,879
Well, your melody
isn't much shittier

807
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:02,313
So, school wisdom and life wisdom
do not go hand in hand -

808
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,114
here is very living example of it

809
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,029
They're seriously
trying to get through

810
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,312
Kari is alone out there

811
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,670
Let's go and help

812
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,519
Don't have any hurry back

813
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,517
Can't drink anything here,
it's so dusty

814
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,235
Well let's taken when...
Here it goes

815
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,071
It's good like this too

816
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,039
What's banging there?

817
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,913
I don't know damnit,
devil has gotten loose, look

818
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,271
True leader

819
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,830
It'll be tough

820
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,516
Now the devil comes,
go and get bazooka

821
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,109
I can go and get it,
but we have no ammo

822
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,754
Where are they?
-I left them home under the bed

823
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,437
They're going to roll over us

824
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:57,394
Welcome to the velvety,
Kalevi Härmä front to front -

825
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,273
or From front to front
-entertainment tour

826
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,514
This next song
got hugely popular -

827
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,358
at Luxembourg side

828
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,949
The name is,
"I have returned"

829
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,351
Disco lights guide my ship
like a lighthouse

830
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:17,155
I miss a pilot, my keel
is scraping the bottom

831
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,557
I find you in corner,
behind a round table

832
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,070
Evening so hot
and song this -

833
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,955
will unite us tonight

834
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,760
I have done a comeback

835
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,389
He has returned

836
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,669
I composed a hit for you

837
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,678
in other words
I plagiarized disco piece

838
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,438
He made a comeback

839
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:53,517
Eventhough he had
never been missing

840
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:57,118
Kalevi brought the mood

841
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,519
Härmä (Finnish region)
and organs play

842
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,352
Greetings from home forces

843
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,835
Asked to bring you
this videocassette

844
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,237
It should have something exciting
to watch. -Thanks

845
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,679
We had a room reservation,
for a week

846
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,190
Name? -Maakanen,
mister ja Mrs Maakanen

847
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,110
Maakanen

848
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,880
Your room is not ready yet

849
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,515
You can wait
in the winter garden

850
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:53,510
And I will serve you sherry

851
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,396
This is nice

852
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:36,275
I poured slightly more for the bride

853
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,351
I wonder why
can't we get to our room yet?

854
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,471
Because sweepers are coming there

855
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,599
You are late again.
-We are sorry -

856
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,078
but town house cleaning
took hours...

857
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,635
Don't explain!

858
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,877
Clean the honeymoon suite quickly

859
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,792
Quickly!

860
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,190
So this is the honeymoon suite

861
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:48,998
Look, look

862
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,075
Look at that, it's a rat

863
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,430
Rat.
-Yes, a rat

864
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,037
Rat

865
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,835
Rat

866
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,318
Verner, don't squeeze the rat
too hard, it can die

867
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,399
Cat. -Yes, the cat lost its life,
when you squeezed too hard

868
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,075
Shall we start working?

869
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,835
Verner?
-Look

870
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:37,077
Verner, sweet under the bed.
-Okay

871
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,952
What was that?

872
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,435
Nothing. Calm down my love

873
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,918
I took liberty
to bring more sherry

874
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,954
We have happy hour now

875
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,116
Maybe no more sherry -

876
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,834
but could be order dinner?
-What?

877
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,110
Coq au vin (Wine rooster)

878
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:03,632
We serve the best
wine booster in the region

879
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,870
I leave these sherries anyway -

880
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,629
perhaps you want them later

881
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,957
See my rooster -

882
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:42,593
you are going to be a meal
for the bride and groom

883
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,073
Namely, a memento meal

884
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,114
Could we get to our room already?

885
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,279
Let's go and see

886
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,870
Is that bag very heavy?
-It isn't

887
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:16,079
Well then I could have
carried it too

888
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,431
It is this one

889
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,109
Gentlefolk is good
and shall do well

890
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,472
I took the liberty to
bring your forgotten sherries

891
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,752
Thank you.
-Place them there

892
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,030
Excellent

893
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:24,432
By the way, is it too hot here?
-No

894
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,428
Not at all.
-As it should be

895
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,839
It is clean here -

896
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:43,430
but we could rearrange
some things a bit

897
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,238
Excellent

898
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,637
Verner, Verner

899
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,798
You have to be careful
with glassware. -Okay

900
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,192
What was that?

901
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,189
Go and see

902
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,277
Go, go

903
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,348
What a dusty chandelier

904
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:45,473
Verner, go and catch crystal
polisher from the bucket

905
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,069
Bucket

906
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,356
It sure is strange

907
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,872
Verner, go and get brush.
-Brush

908
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:19,238
Wine rooster eh?

909
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,316
Wine taste has to be thick -

910
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,317
gushing -

911
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,080
and bloody

912
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,353
This is wrong

913
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,596
Brush

914
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,631
Fetch... brush

915
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,870
Otto? Otto?

916
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,274
Here you go, relaxed and happy

917
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,958
No, no, no

918
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,148
Otto? Otto?

919
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,510
(gibberish)

920
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,436
Come here

921
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,514
That boy up there,
he is Juhani

922
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,472
He is lord's little brother

923
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,875
And lord keeps him
in the cage because -

924
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,152
he is somewhat like you.
He is a bit weird

925
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,029
Hey don't cry now

926
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:12,677
Strong and bloody,
this is just right

927
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,595
Hands off taffel!

928
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:43,237
We were practising Chopin in
honor of afternoon. -Don't explain!

929
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,752
Don't you see that floors
are still not been scrubbed?

930
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,236
Act!

931
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,956
Goddamn it

932
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,675
Sherry is not having an effect -

933
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:08,471
so fate shall intervene the game

934
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,116
So this is what happened

935
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,073
You didn't drink your sherries

936
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,595
There's no soft pine soap left

937
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:04,675
Dear friends, my darling wife

938
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,512
Now that evil
has been defeated -

939
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,836
and our brutal lord is dead -

940
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,679
I want to thank you all

941
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,117
You Juhani, I want to
congratulate for being set free

942
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:21,029
You have life ahead of you and
you can become whatever

943
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,432
Such as... like a novelist

944
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,034
Otto and Verner...

945
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:34,637
Thank you, you saved my life
and our young marriage

946
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,553
Few words.
-Otto, Otto

947
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:47,034
For my behalf and
Verner's behalf I can say -

948
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:50,596
that lord's demise
was to us too -

949
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,473
immense relief

950
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,831
One more request

951
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,512
Seeing young love -

952
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,194
makes us immensely happy

953
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,517
Could you kiss?

954
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,192
Dudes

955
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:43,830
I think this decoration thing
begins to be ready

956
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,875
At least I'm damn proud.
What do you think?

957
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,874
I have no opinion anymore

958
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,918
Kari?

959
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,278
All the same

960
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,270
So what says reporter Ahonen?

961
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,359
Mauno?
-Right

962
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:06,677
What do you think of the cabin?
-Well personally I don't like

963
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,440
Besides this your surface
renovation comes a bit late

964
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,438
According to radio
this war ends in 3 seconds

965
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,234
Which is right now

966
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:22,391
So has this been
totally wasted trip then?

967
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,398
Don't get depressed now, the war
has its positive side too -

968
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,398
as it employs soldiers, arms dealers -

969
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,353
cuts off trash population
and indeed arse brushing -

970
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,632
Finns have something worth to
defend, er, Juha Mieto, buttermilk -

971
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:37,638
Ã…land Islands, Sweden, Norway

972
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,751
It sure got silent

973
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,920
the Finnish Broadcasting Corp,
Mauno Ahonen

974
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,358
Do you hear Jarkki?
Would you mind going to Siwa -

975
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:26,836
and buy one 6-pack, I should
be coming back on the next flight

976
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,598
I can get strong drinks
on the plane, but for morning

977
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,478
Right

978
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:37,191
Let's run away from the oat field

979
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:42,239
Run and disarm

980
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:48,276
Heaven leaks its light there

981
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:53,068
Let's bury the iron
to rust already

982
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,877
Da daa dada dada daada

983
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,389
sunflowers remain

984
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,429
They give yellow color to gold
but it is white

985
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:14,639
Believed in the right

986
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,630
and swore

987
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,999
but unnecessary murder

988
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:26,194
got tired, won

989
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,988
Or lost?

990
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:33,717
To whom bells these ring for?

991
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:39,957
Could I raise my head straight up?

992
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:45,675
Let's run away from from oat field

993
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:51,037
run and disarm

994
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:56,710
Heaven leaks its light there

995
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,638
Let's bury the iron
to rust already

996
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:05,479
Because light is fast

997
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:08,752
Da daa da dada daada

998
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,110
sunflowers remain -

999
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,750
They give yellow color to gold
but it is white

1000
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:19,069
Da daa da dada daada

1001
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,874
naked souls remain

1002
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:26,119
so let's drink
young wine of freedom

1003
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,194
Da daa da dada daada

1004
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,868
sunflowers remain -

1005
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:37,870
They give yellow color to gold
but it is white

1006
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,035
Da daa da dada daada

1007
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,834
naked souls remain -

1008
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:47,669
so let's drink
young wine of freedom

1009
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,708
Da daa da dada daada

1010
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,309
sunflowers remain

1011
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:58,832
great man withered so small

1012
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:02,520
Da daa da dada daada

1013
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:05,439
naked souls remain -

1014
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,799
again a final war ended

1015
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:14,559
Da daada dada daada

1016
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:24,237
Goddamn,
what perverts are still here?

1017
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,875
There are no boobs shown anymore

1018
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,554
Go home
