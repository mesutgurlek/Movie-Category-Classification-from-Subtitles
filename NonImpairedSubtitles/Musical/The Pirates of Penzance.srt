1
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,335
Shoo, shoo.

2
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,734
Pirates!

3
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,625
What? No! No!
I'll get you for this.

4
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,524
Not in the water! No!

5
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,089
Happy birthday!

6
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,501
<i>Pour, oh pour,
the pirate sherry</i>

7
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:15,104
<i>Fill, oh fill,
the pirate glass</i>

8
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:23,651
<i>And to make us
more than merry,
let the pirate bumper pass!</i>

9
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:30,056
<i>For today our pirate friend,
he rises from indentures freed</i>

10
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,461
<i>Strong his arm
and keen his scent is</i>

11
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,261
<i>He's a pirate now, indeed</i>

12
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,393
<i>Here's good luck
to Frederic's ventures</i>

13
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,596
<i>Frederic's out
of his indentures</i>

14
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,434
Happy
21st birthday!

15
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,701
<i>One and 20
now he's rising</i>

16
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,675
<i>And alone
he's fit to fly</i>

17
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,874
<i>Which we're bent on
signalizing with
unusual revelry</i>

18
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,007
<i>Here's good luck
to Frederic's ventures</i>

19
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,575
<i>Frederic's out
of his indentures</i>

20
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,712
<i>Pour, oh pour,
the pirate sherry</i>

21
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,847
<i>Fill, oh fill,
the pirate glass</i>

22
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,789
<i>And to make us
more than merry</i>

23
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:04,626
<i>Let the pirate bumper pass</i>

24
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,399
Yes, Frederic.

25
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,810
From today, you'll rank
as a full-blown member
of our band.

26
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,508
My friends, I thank
you all from my heart
for your kind wishes.

27
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,557
Would that
I could repay them
as they deserve.

28
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,317
What do you mean?

29
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,326
Today, I am out
of my indentures.

30
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,226
Today...

31
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,800
I leave you forever.

32
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:43,893
Hey.
What?

33
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,029
This is quite
unaccountable.

34
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,073
A keener hand
at scuttling a Cunarder

35
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,974
or cutting a P&O
never shipped
a handspike!

36
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,237
Yes, I did
my best for you.

37
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,808
And why?

38
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,845
Because it was my duty
under my indentures.

39
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,282
And I am
the slave of duty.

40
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,543
Oh.

41
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,783
As a child,
I was regularly
apprenticed to your band.

42
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,759
It was through
an error.

43
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,420
An error?
No matter.

44
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:14,091
The mistake was ours,
not yours, and I was
in honor bound by it.

45
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,532
What error?

46
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,064
Well, I dare not say,

47
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:20,264
for it would reflect
upon my well-loved Ruth.

48
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,532
Ruth?

49
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,666
Nay, dear master,

50
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:28,043
my mind has long been
gnawed by the cankering
tooth of mystery.

51
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,707
Better have it
out at once.

52
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,280
<i>When Frederic
was a little lad</i>

53
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,917
<i>He proved
so brave and daring</i>

54
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:46,363
<i>His father thought
he'd 'prentice him
to some career seafaring</i>

55
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,060
<i>I was, alas,
his nursery maid</i>

56
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,729
<i>And so it fell
to my lot</i>

57
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,934
<i>To take and bind
the promising boy</i>

58
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:59,068
<i>Apprentice to a pilot</i>

59
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,770
A ship's pilot?

60
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,112
<i>A life not bad
for a hardy lad</i>

61
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:07,880
<i>Though surely
not a high lot</i>

62
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,985
<i>Though I'm a nurse</i>

63
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:15,253
<i>You might do worse
than make your boy
a pilot</i>

64
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,194
<i>I was a stupid
nursery maid</i>

65
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,829
<i>On breakers
always steering</i>

66
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,499
<i>And I did not catch
the word aright</i>

67
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,042
<i>Through being
hard of hearing</i>

68
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,343
<i>Mistaking my instructions
which within my brain
did gyrate</i>

69
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,680
<i>I took and bound
this promising boy</i>

70
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,756
<i>Apprentice to a pirate</i>

71
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,958
<i>A sad mistake
it was to make</i>

72
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,797
<i>And doom him
to this vile lot</i>

73
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:01,969
<i>I bound him
to a pirate, you</i>

74
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,238
<i>Instead of to a pilot</i>

75
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,417
This afternoon
my obligation ceases.

76
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,544
Aye.

77
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,216
Individually, I love you all
with affection unspeakable.

78
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,787
But collectively,

79
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,496
I look upon you
with a disgust

80
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,501
that amounts to
absolute detestation.

81
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,431
Oh, pity me,
beloved friends.

82
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,971
For such is my
sense of duty,

83
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,438
that once out
of my indentures,

84
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,065
I shall feel
myself bound

85
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,440
to devote myself
heart and soul

86
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,179
to your extermination.

87
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,948
No, no, no,
no, Frederic.

88
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,921
If you
conscientiously feel

89
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,463
that it is your duty
to destroy us,

90
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,558
we cannot blame you
for acting on
that conviction.

91
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,667
Always act
in accordance
with the dictates

92
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,229
of your conscience,
my boy,

93
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,801
and chance
the consequences!

94
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,178
And besides,
we can offer you

95
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,407
but little temptation
to remain with us.

96
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,547
We don't seem able
to make piracy pay.

97
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,887
I don't know
why I'm sure,
but I don't.

98
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,718
Well, I do know why.

99
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,888
Alas, I cannot tell you!

100
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,657
It would not be right.

101
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,257
Why not?

102
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:31,952
It's only...

103
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,533
11:56.

104
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,196
And you are one of us
until the clock
strikes 12.

105
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,532
Aye!

106
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,005
And until then,
you are bound to
protect our interests.

107
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,837
Hear, hear.

108
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:47,470
Well, then, it's my duty
as a pirate to tell you

109
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,913
that you are too
tender-hearted.

110
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,249
For instance,
you make it a point
of never attacking

111
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,152
a weaker party
than yourselves.

112
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,424
And when you attack
a stronger one,

113
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,427
you invariably
get thrashed!

114
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,922
There's some
truth in that.

115
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:12,067
And then again,
you make it a point of
never molesting an orphan.

116
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:17,206
Well, of course not!
We're orphans ourselves!
And know what it is like!

117
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,969
Yes, but it has got about.
And what is the consequence?

118
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,383
Everyone we capture
says he's an orphan!

119
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:30,583
The last three ships we took
proved to be manned
entirely by orphans.

120
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,721
One would think
that Great Britain's
mercantile fleet

121
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,627
was recruited
solely from her
orphan asylums.

122
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,222
And we know
this is not the case.

123
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:44,497
Frederic, you wouldn't
have us absolutely
merciless?

124
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,932
Ah, well,
there's my problem.

125
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,877
Till 12:00, I would,
after 12:00, I wouldn't.

126
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,778
Oh, was ever a man placed
in so delicate a situation.

127
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,218
Frederic.

128
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,725
Frederic.
Frederic.

129
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,559
And, Ruth, your own Ruth
whom you love so well,

130
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,293
who has won
her middle-aged way
into your boyish heart.

131
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,891
What is to become of her?

132
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:20,405
Oh, he will take you
with him.

133
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,402
Well, Ruth.

134
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,308
I feel some little
difficulty about you.

135
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,313
It's true
I admire you
very much.

136
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:33,511
But I've been
constantly at sea
since I was eight years old.

137
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,647
Yours is the only
woman's face I've
seen in that time.

138
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,654
I think it is
a sweet face.

139
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,387
Ah, it is.
Oh, it is.

140
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,153
I say,
I think it is.

141
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,021
But as I've never
had the opportunity

142
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,498
of comparing you
with other women,

143
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,228
I just
may be mistaken.

144
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,291
True.

145
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,236
Excuse me.

146
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,570
What a terrible thing
it would be

147
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,633
if I were to marry
this innocent person,

148
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,441
to find out that she is,
on the whole...

149
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:07,743
...plain.

150
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,484
Plain? Oh, Ruth?
Ruth is very...

151
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,288
Well...

152
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,154
Well?

153
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,524
Yes. Very well.

154
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,563
There are the remains
of a fine woman about Ruth.

155
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,397
Do you really
think so?

156
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,598
I do.

157
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,164
Well then,
I will not be
so selfish

158
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,005
as to take
her from you.

159
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:36,411
In justice to her,
and in consideration
for you, sir,

160
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,749
I will
leave her behind.

161
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,215
Oh.

162
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,344
Ah.

163
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,478
Oh.

164
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,317
Oh, no. No.

165
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,585
No!

166
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,423
No, Fredric. No, no.
No, this must not be.

167
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,554
No, no! We are rough men!
Rough!

168
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,120
Who lead
a rough life.

169
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,223
Rough! Rough!

170
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,394
But we are not
so utterly heartless

171
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,698
as to deprive thee
of thy love!

172
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,572
I think I'm right
in saying that
there is not one here

173
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:08,011
who would rob thee
of this inestimable treasure
for all the world holds dear.

174
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,306
Not one!

175
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,684
I thought there wasn't.

176
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:16,187
Well, it's the top
of the tide and
we must be off ourselves.

177
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,779
There's the day's
pillage to be done.

178
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,554
Man the foresail.
Jib the top fold.
Hoist the topsail.

179
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:27,031
Hoist the mainsail.
Hoist the jibsail.
Drop the anchor.

180
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,532
Weigh the anchor.

181
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,598
Hoist the topsail.

182
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,331
Frederic! Don't swim.

183
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,499
Take the dinghy.

184
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,667
And when your process
of extermination begins,

185
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,737
let our deaths be
as swift and painless

186
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,141
as you can conveniently
make them.

187
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,685
I will.

188
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,620
By the love
I have for you,
I swear it!

189
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,555
Oh, would that
you could render this
extermination unnecessary,

190
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,425
by accompanying me
back to civilization.

191
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,128
No, Frederic,
it cannot be.

192
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,529
I don't think much
of our profession.

193
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,338
But contrasted
with respectability,

194
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,597
it is comparatively
honest.

195
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,340
No, Frederic.

196
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,809
I shall live

197
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,940
and die

198
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,079
a Pirate King!

199
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,790
<i>Oh, better far
to live and die</i>

200
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,560
<i>Under the brave
black flag I fly</i>

201
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,525
<i>Than play
a sanctimonious part</i>

202
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,470
<i>With a pirate head
and a pirate heart</i>

203
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,137
<i>Away to the cheating world
go you</i>

204
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:52,039
<i>Where pirates all
are well-to-do</i>

205
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:58,123
<i>But I'll be true
to the song I sing</i>

206
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:05,597
<i>And live and die</i>

207
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:12,961
<i>A Pirate King</i>

208
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:20,344
<i>For I am a Pirate King</i>

209
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:26,984
<i>And it is,
it is a glorious thing
to be a Pirate King</i>

210
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,947
<i>But I am a Pirate King</i>

211
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,512
<i>You are!
Hurrah for the Pirate King</i>

212
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,424
<i>And it is,
it is a glorious thing
to be a Pirate King</i>

213
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,519
<i>It is!
Hurrah for the Pirate King</i>

214
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:44,525
<i>Hurrah for the Pirate</i>

215
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,368
<i>King</i>

216
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,706
<i>He is a Pirate King,
he is</i>

217
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,752
<i>Hurrah for the Pirate King</i>

218
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,049
<i>And it is,
it is a glorious thing</i>

219
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,987
<i>To be a Pirate King, it is</i>

220
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:09,494
<i>Hurrah for the Pirate King,
hurrah for the Pirate King</i>

221
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,957
<i>When I sally forth
to seek my prey</i>

222
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,826
<i>I help myself
in a royal way</i>

223
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,923
<i>I sink a few more ships,
it's true</i>

224
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,902
<i>Than a well-bred monarch
ought to do</i>

225
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:01,237
<i>But many a king
on a first-class throne</i>

226
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,516
<i>If he wants to call
his crown his own</i>

227
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:11,851
<i>Must manage somehow
to get through</i>

228
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:17,686
<i>More dirty work</i>

229
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:24,063
<i>Than ever I do</i>

230
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,633
<i>For</i>

231
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:32,473
<i>I am a Pirate King</i>

232
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:37,043
<i>And it is,
it is a glorious thing
to be a Pirate King</i>

233
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,811
<i>I am a Pirate King</i>

234
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,250
<i>You are,
you are a Pirate King</i>

235
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,518
<i>And it is,
it is a glorious thing
to be a Pirate King, it is</i>

236
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,218
<i>Hurrah for the Pirate King</i>

237
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:54,221
<i>Hurrah for the Pira...</i>

238
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,736
<i>Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha</i>

239
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:13,107
<i>Ho</i>

240
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,481
<i>...rate King</i>

241
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,626
Now watch it.
Watch it carefully.
That's it. That's it.

242
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:25,993
Now take my hand.

243
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,532
Be careful,
don't rock
the boat now.

244
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,658
Oh!

245
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,461
Ruth.
Oh!

246
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,904
Tell me candidly,
and without reserve.

247
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,465
Compared with
other women,

248
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,736
how are you?

249
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,039
I will tell you
truthfully.

250
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:44,844
I have a slight cold,
but otherwise
I'm quite well.

251
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,210
Well, I am sorry
for your cold,

252
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:51,120
but I was referring
rather to your
personal appearance.

253
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,021
Compared with
other women, are you...

254
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,192
You know...

255
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,755
Beautiful?

256
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,834
I have been told so,
dear master.

257
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,459
Oh, but lately?

258
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,498
No. Years
and years ago.

259
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,036
Well, what do you
think of yourself?

260
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,536
It is a delicate
question.

261
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,916
But I think
I am a fine woman.

262
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,752
Thank you, Ruth,
I believe you.

263
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,880
For I know
you would not practice
upon my inexperience.

264
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,254
I wish to do
the right thing.

265
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,555
And if you are truly
a fine woman,

266
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,290
well, then, your age
shall be no obstacle
to our union!

267
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,891
Hark!
Surely, I hear voices!

268
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,566
Who has ventured
to approach our all
but inaccessible lair?

269
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,672
Can it be
the Coast Guard?

270
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,175
Oh, yes,
it's the Coast Guard.

271
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,236
No, it does not sound
like the Coast Guard.

272
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,209
By all that's marvelous,
a bevy of beautiful
young maidens!

273
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,719
Oh, it's lost,
lost, lost.

274
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,783
How lovely!
How surpassingly lovely
is the plainest of them.

275
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,661
What grace,
what delicacy.

276
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,359
What refinement!

277
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,501
<i>Oh, false one,
you have deceived me</i>

278
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,336
<i>I have deceived you?</i>

279
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,781
<i>Yes! Deceived me</i>

280
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,354
<i>You told me
you were fair as gold</i>

281
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,186
<i>And, master,
am I not so</i>

282
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:36,056
<i>And now I see
you're plain and old</i>

283
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,824
<i>I'm sure
I'm not a jot so</i>

284
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,730
<i>Upon my innocence
you play</i>

285
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,325
<i>I'm not the one
to plot so</i>

286
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,236
<i>Your face is lined,
your hair is gray</i>

287
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,104
<i>It's gradually
got so</i>

288
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,369
<i>Faithless woman
to deceive me</i>

289
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,106
<i>I who trusted so</i>

290
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,241
<i>Master, master,
do not leave me</i>

291
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,343
<i>Hear me 'ere you go</i>

292
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,717
<i>Faithless woman</i>

293
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,278
<i>Master, master</i>

294
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,550
<i>Faithless woman</i>

295
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:06,784
<i>Master, master</i>

296
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,485
<i>Faithless woman
Do not leave me</i>

297
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,152
<i>To deceive me
Do not leave me</i>

298
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,129
<i>I who trusted so
Hear me 'ere you go</i>

299
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,800
<i>Faithless woman to deceive me
Master, master,
do not leave me</i>

300
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:22,238
<i>I who trusted so
Hear me 'ere you go</i>

301
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:30,970
Ow!

302
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:41,888
<i>My love
without reflecting</i>

303
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,357
<i>Oh, do not be rejecting</i>

304
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,759
<i>Take a maiden tender</i>

305
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:57,039
<i>Her affection
raw and green</i>

306
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:02,644
<i>At very highest rating</i>

307
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:07,918
<i>Has been accumulating</i>

308
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:13,154
<i>Summer's 17</i>

309
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:19,153
<i>Summer's 17</i>

310
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:25,164
<i>Don't, beloved master</i>

311
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:30,340
<i>Crush me with disaster</i>

312
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,534
<i>What is such a dower</i>

313
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:40,083
<i>To the dower
I have here</i>

314
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:47,024
<i>Yes, your former master
Don't, beloved master</i>

315
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:52,228
<i>Save you from disaster
Crush me with disaster</i>

316
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:56,261
<i>Your love would be
What is such a dower</i>

317
00:23:56,334 --> 00:24:02,500
<i>Uncomfortably fervid,
it is clear
To the dower I have here?</i>

318
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,505
<i>My love unabating</i>

319
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,842
<i>If, as you are stating</i>

320
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:14,082
<i>Has been accumulating</i>

321
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,744
<i>Forty-seven years</i>

322
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:20,485
<i>Forty-seven years!</i>

323
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,323
<i>Forty-seven years</i>

324
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:26,295
<i>Faithless woman
to deceive me</i>

325
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,390
<i>I who trusted so</i>

326
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,058
<i>Faithless woman
to deceive me</i>

327
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,467
<i>Master, master,
do not leave me</i>

328
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:38,032
<i>I who trusted
Hear me 'ere you</i>

329
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:44,014
<i>So!
Go!</i>

330
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,102
<i>Climbing over rocky mountain</i>

331
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,835
<i>Skipping rivulet
and fountain</i>

332
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:16,310
<i>Passing where
the willows quiver</i>

333
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,144
<i>By the ever rolling river</i>

334
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:21,777
<i>Swollen with
the summer rain,
the summer rain</i>

335
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,582
<i>Threading long
and leafy mazes</i>

336
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,282
<i>Dotted with
unnumbered daisies</i>

337
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,918
<i>Dotted, dotted with
unnumbered daisies</i>

338
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,791
<i>Scaling rough
and rugged passes</i>

339
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,557
<i>Climb the hardy
little lassies</i>

340
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:36,158
<i>Till the bright seashore
they gain</i>

341
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,997
<i>Scaling rough
and rugged passes</i>

342
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,798
<i>Climb the hardy
little lassies</i>

343
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,238
<i>Till the bright seashore
they gain</i>

344
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:56,653
<i>Let us gaily
tread the measure</i>

345
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,748
<i>Make the most
of fleeting leisure</i>

346
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:04,727
<i>Hail it as a true ally</i>

347
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:08,197
<i>Though it perish
by-and-by</i>

348
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,063
<i>Hail it as a true ally</i>

349
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,433
<i>Though it perish
by-and-by</i>

350
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:16,440
<i>Every moment
brings a treasure</i>

351
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:20,410
<i>Of its own especial pleasure</i>

352
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:24,574
<i>Though the moments
quickly die</i>

353
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:29,586
<i>Greet them gaily
as they fly</i>

354
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:35,954
<i>Greet them gaily</i>

355
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:39,997
<i>As they fly</i>

356
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,928
<i>Though the moments
quickly die</i>

357
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,968
<i>Greet them gaily
as they fly</i>

358
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,503
<i>Let us gaily
tread the measure</i>

359
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:58,140
<i>Make the most
of fleeting leisure</i>

360
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:01,843
<i>Hail it as a true ally</i>

361
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,549
<i>Though it perish
by-and-by</i>

362
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:09,149
<i>Hail it as a true ally</i>

363
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,560
<i>Though it perish
by-and-by</i>

364
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,590
<i>Let us gaily
tread the measure</i>

365
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,395
<i>Make the most
of fleeting leisure</i>

366
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,436
<i>Hail it as a true ally</i>

367
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:24,499
<i>A true ally!</i>

368
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:37,683
We're quite alone.
Suppose we
take off our shoes.

369
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,350
And our stockings
and paddle.

370
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,359
Paddle?

371
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,190
In all probability
we are the
first human beings

372
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,563
who ever set foot
on this enchanting spot.

373
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,795
Except for
the mermaids, it's the
very place for mermaids.

374
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,996
Who are only
human beings
down to the waist.

375
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:58,167
And who can't be said
strictly to set foot anywhere.

376
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:00,934
I'm going to
take off my stocking.

377
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,649
<i>Stop, ladies, pray</i>

378
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,653
<i>A man!</i>

379
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,694
<i>I had intended
not to intrude myself
upon your notice</i>

380
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:21,193
<i>In this effective
but alarming costume</i>

381
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,801
<i>But under these
peculiar circumstances</i>

382
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,806
<i>I feel it is my bounden duty
to inform you</i>

383
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:34,868
<i>That your proceedings here
will not be unwitnessed</i>

384
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:39,344
<i>But who are you, sir?
Speak!</i>

385
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,975
<i>I am a pirate</i>

386
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:45,088
<i>A pirate! Horror!</i>

387
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,659
<i>Ladies, do not shun me</i>

388
00:28:55,667 --> 00:29:00,604
<i>This evening I renounce
my vile profession</i>

389
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:05,233
<i>And, to that end,
o pure
and peerless maidens</i>

390
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:12,272
<i>Oh, blushing buds
of ever-blooming beauty</i>

391
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:17,814
<i>I, sore at heart,
I, sore at heart</i>

392
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:23,786
<i>Implore your kind assistance</i>

393
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:29,894
<i>How pitiful his tale</i>

394
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:35,538
<i>How rare his beauty</i>

395
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:42,377
<i>How pitiful his tale</i>

396
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:47,281
<i>How rare</i>

397
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:52,289
<i>His beauty</i>

398
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:10,036
<i>Oh, is there not
one maiden breast</i>

399
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:16,643
<i>Which does not feel
the moral beauty</i>

400
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:23,886
<i>Of making worldly interest</i>

401
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:30,817
<i>Subordinate
to sense of duty?</i>

402
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:37,167
<i>Who would not
give up willingly</i>

403
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:43,337
<i>All matrimonial ambition</i>

404
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:50,709
<i>To rescue such a one as I</i>

405
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:55,682
<i>From his unfortunate</i>

406
00:30:56,754 --> 00:31:00,713
<i>Position?</i>

407
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:05,094
<i>From his</i>

408
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:10,931
<i>Position</i>

409
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:26,780
<i>Oh, is there not
one maiden here</i>

410
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:33,346
<i>Whose homely face
and bad complexion</i>

411
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:40,222
<i>Have caused
all hope to disappear</i>

412
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:46,737
<i>Of ever winning
man's affection?</i>

413
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:52,804
<i>To such a one,
if such there be</i>

414
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:59,283
<i>I swear by heaven's arch
above you</i>

415
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:06,118
<i>If you will cast
your eyes on me</i>

416
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:11,528
<i>However plain you be</i>

417
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,899
<i>I'll love you</i>

418
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:24,364
<i>However plain you be</i>

419
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:34,774
<i>If you will
cast your eyes on me</i>

420
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:39,647
<i>However plain you be</i>

421
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:46,630
<i>I'll love</i>

422
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,828
<i>You!</i>

423
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:58,103
<i>I'll love you</i>

424
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:08,408
<i>I'll love</i>

425
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:22,162
<i>You</i>

426
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,360
<i>Alas!</i>

427
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:29,770
<i>There's not one maiden here</i>

428
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:36,246
<i>Whose homely face
and bad complexion</i>

429
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:43,148
<i>Have caused
all hope to disappear</i>

430
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,789
<i>Of ever winning man's</i>

431
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:52,660
<i>Affection!</i>

432
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,560
<i>Not one?</i>

433
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,098
<i>No, no, not one</i>

434
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,431
<i>Not one?</i>

435
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,467
<i>No, no!</i>

436
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,734
<i>Yes, one!</i>

437
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,278
Oh, Mabel!

438
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,973
<i>'Tis Mabel</i>

439
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:16,954
<i>Yes, 'tis</i>

440
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:23,950
<i>Mabel</i>

441
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,960
<i>Oh, Sisters,
deaf to pity's name
for shame!</i>

442
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:33,765
<i>It's true that
he has gone astray
but pray</i>

443
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,569
<i>Is that a reason
good and true
why you</i>

444
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:44,275
<i>Should all be deaf
to pity's name?</i>

445
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:47,909
<i>The question is
had he not been
a thing of beauty</i>

446
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:51,944
<i>Would she be swayed
by quite as keen
a sense of duty?</i>

447
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:57,957
<i>For shame</i>

448
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:03,292
<i>For shame</i>

449
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:07,026
<i>Poor wandering one</i>

450
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:11,299
<i>Though thou
hast surely strayed</i>

451
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:15,939
<i>Take heart of grace,
thy steps retrace</i>

452
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:23,143
<i>Poor wandering one</i>

453
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,280
<i>Poor wandering one</i>

454
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:32,089
<i>If such poor love as mine</i>

455
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:39,593
<i>Can help thee find
true peace of mind</i>

456
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:43,565
<i>Why, take it</i>

457
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,306
<i>It is thine</i>

458
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,878
<i>Take heart,
no danger low'rs</i>

459
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,750
<i>Take any heart
but ours</i>

460
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,484
<i>Take heart,
fair days will shine</i>

461
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:03,618
<i>Take any heart,
take mine</i>

462
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:04,854
Thank you.

463
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:08,490
<i>Take heart,
no danger low'rs</i>

464
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:12,229
<i>Take any heart

<i>Take heart of grace,

470
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:04,878
<i>Poor wandering one</i>

00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,088
<i>Poor wandering one</i>

472
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,660
<i>Poor wandering one</i>

473
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:17,057

First-rate opportunity.
Now, to the port.

493
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,957
You to the starboard.
No. I mean, the starboard.
You to the port.

Each man to a woman.

507
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,287
Man your women.

508
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,057
<i>Too late</i>

00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,365

<i>Here's a first-rate

<i>Hurrah for the Major-General</i>

551
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:11,819
Got it!

00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:22,572
<i>With many cheerful facts

Strategy?

569
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:29,136
Oh, my word.
That's a hard one,
isn't it?

570
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,298
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

571
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:31,432
Cup of tea.
Allergy.

572

Can you do it one more time?
Certainly.

583
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:02,996
And can you do it
really fast?

584
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,438

00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,848
Well, now that
I've introduced myself.

601
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,021
I should like to have
some idea
of what's going on?

602
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,590
Permit me,
I can explain
in two words.

603
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:57,852
We propose
to marry your daughters.

604
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:00,829
Against our wills, Papa.
Against our wills.

605
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:03,025
Oh, you mustn't
do that!

606
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:08,631
Ooh! May I ask.
This is a picturesque uniform.
I'm not familiar with it.

607
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,037
What are you?

608
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:12,301
We are all
single gentlemen.

609
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:15,868
I gather that.

610
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:18,605
Anything else?

611
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:20,682
No, nothing else.

612
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,151
Don't believe him, Papa.
They're all pirates.

613
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,313
The famous Pirates
of Penzance.

614
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,220
Yes, infamous.

615
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:32,420
The Pirates of Penzance!
Yes, I've often
heard of them.

616
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,228
All except
for this gentleman,

617
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:38,268
who was a pirate once,
but is out of
his indentures today

618
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,496
and means to lead
a blameless life
evermore.

619
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,672
Now wait a bit.
I said you wait a bit!

620
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:48,703
I object to pirates
as sons-in-law.

621
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:55,183
We object to major-generals
as fathers-in-law.

622
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,914
But we waive
that point.

623
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:58,977
Oh!

624
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,387
We do not press it.

625
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:03,654
We look over it.

626
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,463
I have an idea.

627
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,397
And do you mean
to say...

628
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,935
Do you mean to say
you would rob me of these,

629
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:15,699
the sole remaining props
of my old age?

630
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,638
And leave me to go through
the remainder of my life

631
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:22,873
unfriended, unprotected
and alone?

632
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:26,974
Well, yes,
that's the idea.

633
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,142
To them, lads.

634
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:30,652
One moment.
One moment.

635
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:36,249
Have you ever known
what it is to be an orphan?

636
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,127
Oh, dash it!

637
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:40,857
Here we are again!

638
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:44,992
I ask you
have you ever known
what it is to be an orphan?

639
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,530
Often!

640
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,935
Yes, orphan.
Have you ever known
what it is to be one?

641
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,373
I say, often.

642
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,911
Often, often, often.

643
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,504
To the ship.
Hang on a minute.

644
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,072
I tell you,
hang on a minute.

645
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,913
Now, listen,
I don't think we quite
understand one another.

646
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,816
I ask you have you
ever known what it is
to be an orphan,

647
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,479
and you say "orphan. "

648
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:08,753
Now as I understand you,
you are merely repeating
the word "orphan"

649
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,124
to show that
you understand me. Hmm.

650
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:12,626
I didn't repeat
the word "orphan. "

651
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,254
Pardon me,
you did indeed.

652
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,398
I only
repeated it once.

653
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,661
True, but you
repeated it!

654
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:20,831
But not often!

655
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,739
Ooh! Ooh!

656
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,840
I think I can see
where we are
getting confused.

657
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,605
Now, when you say
"orphan,"

658
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,307
did you mean "orphan,"
a person that has
lost his parents

659
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,349
or "often,"
"frequently"?

660
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,517
Oh!

661
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,790
I beg your pardon.
I see what you mean.

662
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,758
Of course,
you do, yes.

663
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:45,519
Frequently.

664
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,860
You said
"often" frequently?

665
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,658
No, only once.

666
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:52,725
Exactly. You said
"often," frequently,
only once.

667
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,163
Seize that man!

668
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:05,176
<i>Oh, men of dark
and dismal fate</i>

669
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,379
<i>Forgo your cruel employ</i>

670
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:15,050
<i>Have pity
on my lonely state</i>

671
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:22,162
<i>I am an orphan boy</i>

672
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:27,198
<i>An orphan boy?</i>

673
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:31,002
<i>An orphan boy</i>

674
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,903
<i>How sad</i>

675
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:42,584
<i>An orphan boy</i>

676
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,186
<i>These children
whom you see</i>

677
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,987
<i>Are all that
I can call me own</i>

678
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:53,426
<i>Poor fellow</i>

679
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,325
<i>Take them away from me</i>

680
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:01,895
<i>And I shall
be indeed alone</i>

681
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:06,804
<i>Poor fellow</i>

682
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:11,947
<i>See, at our feet
they kneel</i>

683
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,978
<i>Our hearts we cannot steel</i>

684
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:22,382
<i>Against the sad, sad tale</i>

685
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:27,863
<i>Of the lonely</i>

686
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:36,363
<i>Orphan boy</i>

687
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,777
<i>I'm telling a terrible story
but it doesn't
diminish my glory</i>

688
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:43,608
<i>For they would have
taken my daughters
over the billowy waters</i>

689
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,238
<i>If I hadn't,
in elegant diction</i>

690
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,577
<i>Indulged in
an innocent fiction</i>

691
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,448
<i>Which is not in
the same category as telling
a regular terrible story</i>

692
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,043
<i>He's telling
a terrible story</i>

693
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:52,486
<i>Which will tend
to diminish his glory</i>

694
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,784
<i>Though they would
have taken his daughters</i>

695
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:55,347
<i>Over the billowy waters</i>

696
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:56,915
<i>It is easy,
in elegant diction</i>

697
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,325
<i>To call it
an innocent fiction</i>

698
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,623
<i>But it comes
in the same category</i>

699
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,323
<i>As telling
a regular terrible story</i>

700
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:02,797
<i>It's easy,
in elegant diction</i>

701
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,265
<i>To call it
an innocent fiction</i>

702
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,494
<i>But it comes in
the same category</i>

703
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:08,766
<i>As telling a regular story</i>

704
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:16,808
<i>Although our dark career</i>

705
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:23,285
<i>Sometimes involves
the crime of stealing</i>

706
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:27,813
<i>We rather think
that we're</i>

707
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:34,797
<i>Not altogether
void of feeling</i>

708
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:39,899
<i>Although
we live by strife</i>

709
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:47,139
<i>We're always sorry
to begin it</i>

710
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:51,207
<i>For what, we ask</i>

711
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:58,444
<i>Is life</i>

712
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:04,686
<i>Without a touch</i>

713
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:11,861
<i>Of poetry in it</i>

714
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:21,777
<i>Hail, poetry</i>

715
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:29,585
<i>Thou heaven-born maid</i>

716
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:38,885
<i>Thou gildest even</i>

717
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:46,358
<i>The pirate's trade</i>

718
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:55,139
<i>Hail, flowing</i>

719
00:51:55,212 --> 00:52:02,015
<i>Fount of sentiment</i>

720
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:07,982
<i>All hail</i>

721
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:13,453
<i>All hail</i>

722
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:18,097
<i>Divine</i>

723
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:25,074
<i>Emollient!</i>

724
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:38,082
<i>You may go,
for you're at liberty</i>

725
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:44,151
<i>Our pirate rules
protect you</i>

726
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:48,024
<i>And honorary members
of our band</i>

727
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:51,732
<i>We do elect you</i>

728
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:54,027
Thank you.
Hurray!

729
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,401
<i>For he is
an orphan boy</i>

730
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,770
<i>He is!
Hurrah for the orphan boy</i>

731
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,038
<i>And it sometimes
is a useful thing
to be an orphan boy</i>

732
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,942
<i>It is!
Hurrah for the orphan boy</i>

733
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,981
<i>Hurrah for the orphan boy</i>

734
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,606
<i>Oh, happy day,
with joyous glee</i>

735
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,514
<i>They will away
and married be</i>

736
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,348
<i>Oh, happy day,
with joyous glee</i>

737
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,320
<i>They will away
and married be</i>

738
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,947
<i>Should it befall
auspiciously</i>

739
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,992
<i>Our Sisters all
will bridesmaids be</i>

740
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:17,686
<i>Should it befall
auspiciously</i>

741
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,456
<i>Our Sisters all
will bridesmaids be</i>

742
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,360
<i>Oh, happy day,
with joyous glee</i>

743
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:23,262
<i>They will away
and married be</i>

744
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,096
<i>Should it befall
auspiciously</i>

745
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:26,999
<i>Our Sisters all
will bridesmaids be</i>

746
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,662
<i>Should it befall
auspiciously</i>

747
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:32,174
<i>Our Sisters all
will bridesmaids be</i>

748
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,310
Papa?

749
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,123
Papa?

750
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,197
Papa?

751
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:52,650
<i>Oh, dry
the glistening tear</i>

752
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:57,819
<i>That dews
that martial cheek</i>

753
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:01,461
<i>Thy loving children hear</i>

754
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:06,195
<i>In them thy comfort seek</i>

755
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:10,068
<i>With sympathetic care</i>

756
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:15,043
<i>Their arms around thee creep</i>

757
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:19,604
<i>For oh, they cannot bear</i>

758
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:23,551
<i>To see</i>

759
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:27,579
<i>Their father weep</i>

760
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,063
Oh, Frederic,

761
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:47,434
cannot you,
in the calm excellence
of your wisdom,

762
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,841
reconcile it
with your conscience

763
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:51,005
to say something
that will ease
my father's sorrow?

764
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,275
What?

765
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,275
Can't you cheer
him up?

766
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,151
Oh, I would try,
dear Mabel.

767
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:05,457
But why does he sit here
night after night
in this drafty old ruin?

768
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,723
Why do I sit here?

769
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,992
Oh, Frederic,
Frederic!

770
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,328
In order to escape
the pirates' clutches,

771
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:16,372
I described myself
as an orphan,

772
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:19,374
and heaven help me,
I am no orphan.

773
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,744
Well, be comforted, sir.

774
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:25,576
For had you not
acted as you did,

775
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,616
these reckless men
would most assuredly

776
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,914
have called in
the nearest clergyman

777
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:32,250
and married
your large family
on the spot.

778
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:35,689
I thank you for
your proffered solace,
but it is unavailing.

779
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:39,092
I tell you, Frederic,
such is the anguish
and remorse I feel

780
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:40,754
at the abominable
falsehood

781
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,799
by which I escaped
these easily deluded
pirates,

782
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:47,462
that I would go
to their simple-minded
chief this very night

783
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,663
and confess all.

784
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:49,762
Ah!

785
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,808
But did I not feel
that the consequences

786
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:55,936
would be oh, oh,
oh, no, oh, no, no,
most disastrous,

787
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:58,572
most disastrous
to myself.

788
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:02,607
At what hour
does your expedition march
against these scoundrels?

789
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:04,016
At 11:00.

790
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:06,853
And before midnight
I hope to have atoned

791
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:10,552
for my involuntary
association with
the pestilent scourges

792
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,761
by sweeping them
from the face
of the Earth!

793
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,161
Oh.

794
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:19,827
And then, dear Mabel,
you will be mine.

795
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,996
Are your devoted
followers at hand?

796
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,631
They are.
They only await
my order.

797
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,835
<i>Then, Frederic</i>

798
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:32,177
<i>Let your escort
lion-hearted</i>

799
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:38,576
<i>Be summoned to receive
a General's blessing</i>

800
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:46,084
<i>Ere they depart
upon their dread adventure</i>

801
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,791
<i>Dear, sir, they come!</i>

802
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,925
<i>When the foeman
bares his steel</i>

803
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,727
<i>Tarantara,
tarantara</i>

804
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,529
<i>Oh, we uncomfortable feel</i>

805
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,331
<i>Tarantara</i>

806
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:29,234
<i>And we find
the wisest thing</i>

807
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:31,102
<i>Tarantara,
tarantara</i>

808
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,903
<i>Is to slap our chests
and sing</i>

809
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,876
<i>Tarantara</i>

810
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:36,605
<i>For when threatened
with emutes</i>

811
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,408
<i>Tarantara,
tarantara</i>

812
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:40,244
<i>And your heart
is in your boots</i>

813
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,250
<i>Tarantara</i>

814
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,115
<i>There is nothing
brings it round</i>

815
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:48,582
<i>Like the trumpet's
martial sound</i>

816
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:50,421
<i>Tarantara,
tarantara</i>

817
00:58:50,493 --> 00:59:01,297
<i>Tarantara, tarantara</i>

818
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,271
<i>Ra-ra-tarantara</i>

819
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:08,202
<i>Go, ye heroes,
go to glory</i>

820
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,907
<i>Though ye die
in combat gory</i>

821
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:15,610
<i>Ye shall live
in song and story</i>

822
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:18,381
<i>Go to immortality</i>

823
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:21,821
<i>Go to death
and go to slaughter</i>

824
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:25,051
<i>Die, and every
Cornish daughter</i>

825
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:29,722
<i>With her tears
your grave shall water</i>

826
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:36,864
<i>Go, ye heroes,
go and die</i>

827
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,635
<i>Tho' to us
it's evident</i>

828
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,471
<i>Tarantara,
tarantara</i>

829
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:42,204
<i>These attentions
are well meant</i>

830
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:44,007
<i>Tarantara</i>

831
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,775
<i>Such expressions
don't appear</i>

832
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,645
<i>Tarantara,
tarantara</i>

833
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,344
<i>Calculated men
to cheer</i>

834
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,284
<i>Tarantara</i>

835
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:53,151
<i>Who are going
to meet their fate</i>

836
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:54,814
<i>In a highly
nervous state</i>

837
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:58,520
<i>Tarantara, tarantara,
tarantara</i>

838
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,426
<i>Still to us
it's evident</i>

839
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,088
<i>These attentions
are well meant</i>

840
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:05,623
<i>Tarantara,
tarantara,
tarantara</i>

841
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:10,099
<i>Go and do
your best endeavor</i>

842
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:13,734
<i>And before all links,
we sever</i>

843
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:17,507
<i>We will say farewell
forever</i>

844
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:21,141
<i>Go to glory
and the grave!</i>

845
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:24,345
<i>Go to glory
and the grave</i>

846
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,115
<i>For your foes are
fierce and ruthless</i>

847
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:27,952
<i>False, unmerciful
and truthless</i>

848
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:29,855
<i>Young and tender,
old and toothless</i>

849
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:32,190
<i>All in vain
their mercy crave</i>

850
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:37,032
<i>We observe
too great a stress</i>

851
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,897
<i>On the risks
that on us press</i>

852
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,697
<i>And of reference
a lack</i>

853
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:42,465
<i>To our chance
of coming back</i>

854
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:44,267
<i>Still perhaps
it would be wise</i>

855
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,433
<i>Not to carp
or criticize</i>

856
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:47,976
<i>For it's very evident</i>

857
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,807
<i>These attentions
are well meant</i>

858

01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,310
Wait!
Get back in line.

864
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:01,050
<i>These attentions

Get back! Back!</i>

<i>Oh, rapture unexampled!</i>

01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:10,182
<i>At last I may atone
in some slight measure</i>

918
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:14,019
<i>For the repeated acts
of theft and pillage</i>

919
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:17,915
<i>Of which, at a sense
of duty's stern dictation</i>

920
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:23,131
<i>I, circumstance's victim</i>

921
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:25,563
<i>Have been guilty</i>

<i>Young Frederic!</i>

<i>Who calls?
Your late commander</i>

<i>And I,
your little Ruth</i>

925
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:38,476
<i>Oh, mad intruders</i>

926
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,948
<i>How dare
ye face me?</i>

927
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,217
<i>Know ye not,
oh, rash ones</i>

928
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:49,586
<i>That I have doomed you
to extermination?</i>

929
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,586
<i>Have mercy on us
Have mercy on us</i>

930
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,562
Get back! Back!

931
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,724
<i>Hear us,
ere you slaughter</i>

932
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:01,870
<i>I do not think
I ought to listen to you</i>

933
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:16,815
<i>Yet, mercy should alloy
our stern resentment</i>

934
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:22,724
<i>And so
I will be merciful</i>

935
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:24,919
<i>Say on!</i>

936
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:27,384
Quiet.

937
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:36,664
<i>When you had left
our pirate fold</i>

938
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:38,468
<i>We tried to raise
our spirits faint</i>

939
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,475
<i>According to
our custom old</i>

940
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,204
<i>With quips and
quibbles quaint</i>

941
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,610
<i>But all in vain
the quips we heard</i>

942
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,341
<i>We lay and sobbed
upon the rocks</i>

943
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:47,473
Oh.

944
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,347
<i>Until to somebody
occurred</i>

945
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:50,510
<i>A startling paradox</i>

946
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:52,417
<i>A paradox?
A paradox!</i>

947
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:54,217
<i>A most ingenious
paradox</i>

948
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,053
<i>We've quips
and quibbles
heard in flocks</i>

949
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,990
<i>But none to beat
this paradox!</i>

950
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:00,685
<i>A paradox, a paradox</i>

951
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:02,253
<i>A most ingenious paradox</i>

952
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,161
<i>This paradox</i>

953
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:08,032
Ooh, I love
a good paradox.

954
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,763
<i>The paradox</i>

955
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:21,409
<i>For some
ridiculous reason</i>

956
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:25,813
<i>To which, however,
I've no desire
to be disloyal</i>

957
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:27,355
No.

958
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,620
<i>Some person
in authority</i>

959
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,257
<i>Who?</i>

960
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:34,385
<i>I don't know who</i>

961
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:37,762
<i>Very likely
the Astronomer Royal</i>

962
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:39,323
<i>Has decided that</i>

963
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:43,304
<i>Although for
such a beastly month
as February</i>

964
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:47,172
<i>Twenty-eight days
as a rule are plenty</i>

965
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,140
<i>One year in every four</i>

966
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:56,447
<i>His days shall be reckoned
as nine and twenty</i>

967
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,748
<i>Through some
singular coincidence</i>

968
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:01,881
<i>I shouldn't be surprised</i>

969
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,655
<i>If it were owing
to the agency
of an ill-natured fairy</i>

970
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:12,224
<i>You are the victim of
this clumsy arrangement</i>

971
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:16,196
<i>Having been born
in leap year</i>

972
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:21,403
<i>On the 29th of February</i>

973
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:22,569
And so?

974
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:25,978
<i>And so, by a simple
arithmetical process</i>

975
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:30,007
<i>You'll easily discover</i>

976
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:34,446
<i>That though you've
lived 21 years</i>

977
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:38,823
<i>Yet, if we go
by birthdays</i>

978
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:44,558
<i>You're only five
and a little bit over</i>

979
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:50,569
<i>Dear me! Let's see!</i>

980
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:54,005
<i>Yes, yes, with yours
my figures do agree</i>

981
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,405
Five and a quarter,
oh, that's rich!

982
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,278
<i>How quaint
the ways of paradox</i>

983
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,749
<i>At common sense
she gaily mocks</i>

984
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:04,649
<i>Though counting
in the usual way</i>

985
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,915
<i>Years 21
I've been alive</i>

986
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:11,420
<i>Yet, reckoning
by my natal day</i>

987
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:16,224
<i>Yet, reckoning
by my natal day</i>

988
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:18,592
One, two, three, four...

989
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:21,160
<i>I am a little boy of five</i>

990
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:22,795
<i>He is
a little boy of five</i>

991
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:27,131
<i>A paradox, a paradox</i>

992
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,676
<i>A most ingenious paradox</i>

993
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:31,404
<i>The paradox</i>

994
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,880
<i>A curious paradox</i>

995
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:43,181
<i>A most ingenious paradox!</i>

996
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:57,839
Upon my word,
this is most curious
indeed.

997
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:00,570
Most absurdly whimsical.

998
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:03,309
Five-and-a-quarter, eh?

999
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,846
You wouldn't think it
to look at me.

1000
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:11,385
You'll be glad
I'll be bound,
that you spared us.

1001
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:12,751
You never
would have
forgiven yourself

1002
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:14,915
when you discovered
you killed
your two comrades.

1003
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,593
My comrades?

1004
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:23,896
I'm afraid you don't
appreciate the delicacy
of your position.

1005
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,758
You were apprenticed
to us.

1006
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,635
Yes, until I reached
my 21st year.

1007
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:32,265
Ah! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

1008
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:35,534
Until you reached
your 21st...

1009
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,843
Oh. Birthday.

1010
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:45,349
And going by birthdays,
you are as yet only
five-and-a-quarter.

1011
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:51,517
You don't mean to
say you are going to
hold me to this?

1012
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:53,459
No, no. No, no.
No, no, no, no.

1013
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,156
We merely remind you
of the fact,

1014
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:58,794
and leave the rest
to your sense of duty.

1015
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,295
Your sense of duty.

1016
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:05,606
Oh, I abhor
your infamous calling.

1017
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:10,242
I shudder at the thought
that I've ever been
mixed up with it!

1018
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:14,407
But duty is before all!

1019
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:17,749
And at any price

1020
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:20,954
I will do my duty.

1021
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:24,557
Oh, bravely spoken!

1022
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:25,616
Come!

1023
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,587
You're one of us
once more.

1024
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:30,662
Lead on, I follow.

1025
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:31,764
Come.
That's the ship.

1026
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,974
<i>My eyes are fully opened
to my awful situation</i>

1027
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,941
<i>I shall go at once to Mabel
and make her an oration</i>

1028
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,035
<i>I will tell her
I am bound by duty
and my moral senses</i>

1029
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:45,046
<i>And I don't know what to do
about the penny consequences</i>

1030
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,048
<i>Now I do not want to perish
by the sword or by the dagger</i>

1031
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:49,175
<i>But a pirate must indulge
a little pardonable swagger</i>

1032
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:51,048
<i>And a word or two
of compliment my vanity
would flatter</i>

1033
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,145
<i>But I've got to go tonight
so it really doesn't matter!</i>

1034
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:59,020
<i>So it really doesn't matter!
So it really doesn't matter!</i>

1035
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:01,085
<i>So it really
doesn't matter, matter,
matter, matter, matter!</i>

1036
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:03,290
<i>Matter, matter, matter,
matter, matter, matter,
matter, matter</i>

1037
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,162
<i>If this were not
a little mad
and generally silly</i>

1038
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:07,134
<i>I should give you my advice
upon the subject, willy-nilly</i>

1039
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,137
<i>I should show you
in a moment how to
grapple with the question</i>

1040
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,264
<i>And you'd really be astonished
at the force of my suggestion</i>

1041
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,240
<i>On the subject
I shall write you
a most valuable letter</i>

1042
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:15,675
<i>Full of excellent suggestions
when I feel a little better</i>

1043
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:17,644
<i>But at present I'm afraid
I am as mad as any hatter</i>

1044
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,806
<i>So I'll sing this song
for ruddy good
it really doesn't matter</i>

1045
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:23,784
<i>What we sing doesn't matter
What we sing doesn't matter</i>

1046
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:24,876
<i>What we sing
doesn't matter</i>

1047
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:25,943
<i>No, it really
doesn't matter</i>

1048
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:27,852
<i>What we sing doesn't
matter, matter, matter,
matter, matter</i>

1049
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:30,551
<i>Matter, matter, matter,
matter, matter, matter,
matter, matter</i>

1050
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:33,290
<i>If I had been so lucky
as to have a steady mother</i>

1051
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,954
<i>Who could talk to me
as we are talking now
to one another</i>

1052
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:36,861
<i>Who could give me
good advice when she
discovered I was erring</i>

1053
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:38,593
<i>Which is just the very favor
which on you I am conferring</i>

1054
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:40,157
<i>My existence would have made
a rather interesting idyll</i>

1055
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,794
<i>And I might have
lived and died
a very decent indiwiddle</i>

1056
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,360
<i>This particularly rapid,
unintelligible patter</i>

1057
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:45,168
<i>Isn't generally heard,
and if it is,
it doesn't matter!</i>

1058
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,401
<i>If it is, it doesn't matter
If it is, it doesn't matter</i>

1059
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:50,240
<i>This particularly
rapid, unintelligible patter</i>

1060
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:51,939
<i>Isn't generally heard,
and if it is,
it doesn't matter!</i>

1061
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:53,606
<i>This particularly rapid,
unintelligible patter</i>

1062
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:55,206
<i>Isn't generally heard,
and if it is,
it doesn't matter!</i>

1063
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:56,683
<i>Matter, matter, matter,
matter, matter, matter</i>

1064
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,310
<i>Matter, matter, matter!</i>

1065
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,354
Oh, horror!

1066
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:07,094
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

1067
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:08,356
Ought I to tell you?

1068
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:09,419
What?

1069
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:11,056
Oh, no, I cannot.

1070
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,532
Yet, as one of
your band...

1071
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:15,001
Speak out, I charge you
by that sense of
conscientiousness

1072
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:17,868
to which we've
never yet appealed
in vain.

1073
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,241
General Stanley...
Yes.

1074
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:25,377
The father of my Mabel.
Yes, yes!

1075
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:29,150
General Stanley
escaped from you

1076
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:32,751
on the plea
that he was an orphan.

1077
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:34,916
He did?

1078
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,920
Oh. Oh, yes, he did.

1079
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:42,630
I was there.

1080
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,092
Well?
Oh!

1081
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:50,565
It breaks my heart
to betray the honored father
of the girl I adore.

1082
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:51,901
Break it.

1083
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:56,472
And yet,
as your apprentice,
I have no alternative.

1084
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:57,534
None.

1085
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,106
It is my duty then
to tell you...

1086
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:01,706
Yes, your duty.

1087
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:03,479
...that General Stanley...
Yes?

1088
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:05,380
Well, General Stanley...

1089
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:06,546
General Stanley
is what?

1090
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:08,647
Well, he is no...

1091
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:09,782
He's no...

1092
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:10,950
Well...
What, what, what?

1093
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:13,517
General Stanley is no

1094
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:17,696
orphan!

1095
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:25,706
When you say "orphan,"

1096
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:30,773
you mean, "orphan,"
a person that has
lost his parents

1097
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,372
or "often,"
"frequently"?

1098
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:36,617
A person that has
lost his parents.

1099
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,350
What?
What?

1100
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,319
And more than that...

1101
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,616
No.

1102
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:49,886
Oh.
Oh.

1103
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:56,199
He never was one!

1104
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,048
Am I to understand

1105
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:17,250
that in order to save

1106
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:21,592
his contemptible life,

1107
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:25,460
he dared to practice

1108
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:30,467
on our credulous
simplicity?

1109
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:49,083
Our revenge

1110
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:52,285
will be swift!

1111
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:54,358
We will go
and collect our band

1112
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:59,527
and attack Tremorden Castle
this very night.

1113
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,364
But stay!
Not a word!

1114
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,565
He is doomed!

1115
01:14:06,308 --> 01:14:08,640
<i>Away, away!
My heart's on fire</i>

1116
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:11,008
<i>I burn, this base
deception to repay</i>

1117
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:13,411
<i>This very night
my vengeance dire</i>

1118
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,882
<i>Shall glut itself in gore!
Away, away!</i>

1119
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,215
<i>Away, away!
Ere I expire</i>

1120
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,619
<i>I find my duty
hard to do today</i>

1121
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,953
<i>My heart is filled
with anguish dire</i>

1122
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:25,459
<i>It strikes me to the core!
Away, away!</i>

1123
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:28,052
<i>With falsehood foul
he tricked us
of our brides</i>

1124
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,655
<i>Let vengeance howl
the pirate so decides</i>

1125
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:33,428
<i>Our nature stern
he softened with his lies</i>

1126
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:36,198
<i>And, in return,
tonight the traitor dies</i>

1127
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:44,776
<i>Yes, yes!
Tonight the traitor dies!</i>

1128
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:46,909
<i>Tonight he dies</i>

1129
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,609
<i>Yes, or early tomorrow</i>

1130
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:50,049
<i>His girls likewise?</i>

1131
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:51,676
<i>They will welter
in sorrow</i>

1132
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:53,015
<i>The one soft spot</i>

1133
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:54,612
<i>In their natures
they cherish</i>

1134
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:56,055
<i>And all who plot</i>

1135
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:57,751
<i>To abuse it
shall perish</i>

1136
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,488
<i>Tonight he dies
Yes, or early tomorrow</i>

1137
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:03,258
<i>His girls likewise,
they'll welter in sorrow</i>

1138
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,926
<i>The one soft spot
In their natures
they cherish</i>

1139
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:08,401
<i>And all who plot
to abuse it shall perish</i>

1140
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:11,098
<i>Away, away! Away!</i>

1141
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,767
<i>Tonight the traitor dies!</i>

1142
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:19,178
<i>Away, away!
Tonight! Tonight! Tonight!</i>

1143
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:23,912
<i>The traitor dies tonight!</i>

1144
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:30,924
<i>Away!</i>

1145
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,185
Oh.

1146
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:38,795
<i>Stay, Frederic, stay!</i>

1147
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:40,129
<i>Nay, Mabel, nay!</i>

1148
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,328
<i>They have no claim</i>

1149
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:42,563
<i>But duty's name</i>

1150
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:44,663
<i>The thought my soul appalls
No shadow of a shame</i>

1151
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:47,402
<i>But when stern duty calls
Will fall upon thy name</i>

1152
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:49,940
<i>Stay, Frederic, stay!</i>

1153
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:51,946
<i>I must obey</i>

1154
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:03,481
<i>Ah, leave me
not to pine</i>

1155
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:10,465
<i>Alone and desolate</i>

1156
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:16,064
<i>No fate seemed
fair as mine</i>

1157
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:21,602
<i>No happiness</i>

1158
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:26,513
<i>So great</i>

1159
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:33,480
<i>And nature, day by day</i>

1160
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:37,122
<i>Has sung</i>

1161
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:42,596
<i>In accents clear</i>

1162
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:50,505
<i>This joyous roundelay</i>

1163
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:57,501
<i>"He loves thee</i>

1164
01:16:57,713 --> 01:17:01,114
<i>"He is here</i>

1165

<i>Ah, must I
leave thee here</i>

1173
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:12,843
<i>In endless night
to dream</i>

1174
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:18,953
<i>Where joy is dark
and drear</i>

1175
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:23,195
<i>And sorrow</i>

1176
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:29,261
<i>All supreme</i>

1177
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:36,036
<i>Where nature, day by day</i>

1178
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:39,305
<i>Will sing</i>

1179
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:44,648
<i>In altered tone</i>

1180
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:52,393
<i>This weary roundelay</i>

1181
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:58,632
<i>"He loves thee</i>

1182
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:02,131

I of age shall be</i>

1190
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:05,624
<i>I'll then return
and claim you</i>

1191
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,601
<i>I declare it!</i>

1192
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:13,564
<i>It seems so long</i>

1193
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:18,372
<i>Swear that till then
you will be true to me</i>

1194
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:23,814
<i>Yes, I'll be strong</i>

1195
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:28,315
<i>By all the Stanleys
dead and gone</i>

1196
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,621
<i>I swear it!</i>

1197
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:35,426
<i>Oh, here is love
and here is truth</i>

1198

<i>And here is food
for joyous laughter</i>

<i>Oh, here is love

01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:50,799
Farewell.

<i>No, I am brave</i>

1222
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:11,087
<i>Oh, family descent</i>

1223
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:17,730
<i>How great thy charm,
thy sway, how excellent</i>

1224
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:24,595
<i>Come one and all,
undaunted men in blue</i>

1225
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:29,466
<i>A crisis, now,
affairs are coming to</i>

<i>When the danger's near</i>

1227
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:44,681
<i>Tarantara,
tarantara</i>

1228
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:46,556
<i>We manage to appear</i>

1229
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,255
<i>Tarantara</i>

1230
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,195
<i>As insensible to fear</i>

1231
01:22:50,265 --> 01:22:54,627
<i>As anybody here</i>

1232
01:22:54,703 --> 01:23:07,076
<i>Tarantara, tarantara</i>

1233
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:10,015
<i>Ra-ra-tarantara</i>

1234
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:17,590
<i>Sergeant, approach!</i>

1235
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:24,731
<i>Young Frederic
was to have led you
to death and glory</i>

1236
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:29,060
<i>That is not
a pleasant way of putting it</i>

1237
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:34,667
<i>He will not so lead you</i>

1238
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:36,734
<i>For he has allied himself
once more</i>

1239
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:40,269
<i>With his old associates</i>

1240
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:45,679
<i>He has acted shamefully!</i>

1241
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:47,755
<i>You speak falsely</i>

1242
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:49,722
<i>You know nothing about it</i>

1243
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:56,720
<i>He has acted nobly</i>

1244
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:02,029
<i>He has acted nobly</i>

1245
01:24:02,103 --> 01:24:04,936
<i>Dearly as
I loved him before</i>

1246
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:07,474
<i>His heroic sacrifice
to his sense of duty</i>

1247
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:10,443
<i>Has endeared him
to me tenfold</i>

1248
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:14,580
<i>He has done his duty,
I will do mine</i>

1249
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:22,145
<i>Go ye and do yours</i>

1250
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:26,922
<i>Right oh!</i>

1251
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:30,259
This is perplexing.

1252
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:34,263
But no matter,
our cause is clear.

1253
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:39,836
We must do our best
to capture
these pirates alone.

1254
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:45,910
<i>It is most distressing
to us to be the agents</i>

1255
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:50,679
<i>Whereby our erring
fellow-creatures</i>

1256
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:54,017
<i>Are deprived
of that liberty</i>

1257
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:58,958
<i>Which is so dear
to us all</i>

1258
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,089
<i>But we should have
thought of that</i>

1259
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:07,123
<i>Before we joined
the force</i>

1260
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:09,703
<i>We should</i>

1261
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:11,801
Well, too late now!

1262
01:25:20,648 --> 01:25:23,412
<i>When a felon's not engaged
in his employment</i>

1263
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:24,509
<i>His employment</i>

1264
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:27,248
<i>Or maturing
his felonious
little plans</i>

1265
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:28,380
<i>Little plans</i>

1266
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:31,084
<i>His capacity
for innocent enjoyment</i>

1267
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:32,387
<i>'Cent enjoyment</i>

1268
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:35,122
<i>Is just as great
as any honest man's</i>

1269
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:36,254
<i>Honest man's</i>

1270
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:39,061
<i>Our feelings
we with difficulty
smother</i>

1271
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,123
<i>'Culty smother</i>

1272
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:42,829
<i>When Constabulary
duty's to be done</i>

1273
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:43,928
<i>To be done</i>

1274
01:25:44,005 --> 01:25:47,338
<i>Ah, take
one consideration
with another</i>

1275
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:48,966
<i>With another</i>

1276
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:53,139
<i>A policeman's lot
is not a happy one</i>

1277
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:59,345
<i>Oh</i>

1278
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:02,446
<i>When Constabulary
duty's to be done</i>

1279
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:03,513
<i>To be done</i>

1280
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:06,560
<i>A policeman's lot
is not a happy one</i>

1281
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:08,687
<i>Hoo!</i>

1282
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:12,928
Quiet down there.

1283
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:15,395
Good night.

1284
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:37,182
<i>A rollicking band
of pirates we</i>

1285
01:26:37,258 --> 01:26:38,850
<i>Who, tired of tossing
on the sea</i>

1286
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,561
<i>Are trying their hand
at a burglary</i>

1287
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:43,859
<i>With weapons
grim and gory</i>

1288
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,529
<i>Hush, hush!</i>

1289
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:53,372
<i>I hear them
on the manor poaching</i>

1290
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:59,175
<i>With stealthy steps
the pirates
are approaching</i>

1291
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:02,208
<i>We are not coming
for plate or gold</i>

1292
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:04,444
<i>A story
General Stanley told</i>

1293

<i>We seek a penalty
fifty-fold</i>

1294
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:08,781
<i>For General Stanley's
story</i>

1295
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:10,983
<i>They seek a penalty

1296
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,186
<i>We seek a penalty
Fifty-fold!</i>

01:27:27,308 --> 01:27:31,108
<i>With stealthy stride</i>

1302
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:33,647
Silence! Down.

1303
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:41,878
<i>Our obvious course
is now to hide</i>

<i>Tarantara, tarantara</i>

1305
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,531
Go on.

1306
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,174
Quiet!

1307
01:28:14,322 --> 01:28:15,880
<i>With cat-like tread</i>

1315
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:32,998
<i>So stealthily
the pirate creeps</i>

soundly sleeps</i>

<i>Through the trees</i>

1399

1400
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:33,271
<i>Laughs for very love</i>

1401
01:33:34,008 --> 01:33:37,967

<i>Wave their arms above</i>

1403
01:33:40,915 --> 01:33:44,646
<i>Yes, the trees for very love</i>

1404
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:49,850
<i>Wave their leafy arms above</i>

1405
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:54,427
<i>River, river
little river</i>

1406
01:33:54,495 --> 01:33:58,363
<i>May thy loving prosper ever</i>

1407
01:33:58,432 --> 01:34:01,993
<i>Heaven speed thee,
poplar tree</i>

1408
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:05,771
<i>May thy wooing happy be</i>

1409
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:09,804
<i>Heaven speed thee,
poplar tree</i>

1410
01:34:09,877 --> 01:34:12,846
<i>May thy wooing</i>

1411
01:34:12,913 --> 01:34:18,715
<i>Happy be</i>

1412
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:29,592
<i>Yet, the breeze
is but a rover</i>

1413
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:32,861
<i>When he wings away</i>

1414
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,068
<i>Brook and poplar
mourn a lover</i>

1415
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:40,039
<i>Sighing, "Well-a-day!"</i>

1416
01:34:40,107 --> 01:34:42,598
<i>Well-a-day</i>

1417
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:46,443
<i>Ah, the doing
and undoing</i>

1418
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:49,677
<i>That the rogue
could tell</i>

1419
01:34:50,084 --> 01:34:53,918
<i>When the breeze
is out a-wooing</i>

1420
01:34:53,988 --> 01:34:56,718
<i>Who can woo so well?</i>

1421
01:34:56,791 --> 01:35:00,420
<i>Shocking tales
the rogue could tell</i>

1422
01:35:00,494 --> 01:35:05,522
<i>Nobody can woo so well</i>

1423
01:35:06,267 --> 01:35:10,101
<i>Pretty brook,
thy dream is over</i>

1424
01:35:10,171 --> 01:35:13,902
<i>For thy love
is but a rover</i>

1425
01:35:13,974 --> 01:35:17,740
<i>Sad the lot of poplar trees</i>

1426
01:35:17,945 --> 01:35:21,403
<i>Courted by a fickle breeze</i>

1427
01:35:21,482 --> 01:35:25,213
<i>Sad the lot of poplar trees</i>

1428
01:35:25,486 --> 01:35:29,013
<i>Courted by a</i>

1429
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:37,120
<i>Fickle</i>

1430
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:44,961
<i>Breeze</i>

1431
01:35:46,707 --> 01:35:49,039
Papa!
Papa! Where are you?

1432
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:54,806
<i>Now what is this
and what is that?</i>

1433
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:56,110
<i>And why does Father
leave his rest</i>

1434
01:35:56,183 --> 01:35:59,016
<i>At such a time of night
as this, so very
incompletely dressed?</i>

1435
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:01,919
<i>Dear Father is,
and always was,
the most methodical of men</i>

1436
01:36:01,989 --> 01:36:04,856
<i>It's his invariable rule
to go to bed at half-past ten</i>

1437
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:07,655
<i>What strange occurrence
can it be that calls
dear Father from his rest</i>

1438
01:36:07,728 --> 01:36:10,993
<i>At such a time of night
as this, so very
incompletely dressed?</i>

1439
01:36:11,999 --> 01:36:13,967
<i>So very incompletely dressed</i>

1440
01:36:14,869 --> 01:36:17,838
<i>At such a time of night!</i>

1441
01:36:18,038 --> 01:36:19,733
Forward, my men,

1442
01:36:19,807 --> 01:36:21,707
and seize that
General there!

1443
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:23,243
His life is over!

1444
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:25,608
<i>The pirates!
The pirates!
Oh, despair!</i>

1445
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:28,705
<i>Yes, we're the pirates,
so despair!</i>

1446
01:36:33,587 --> 01:36:36,351
<i>Frederic here!
Oh, joy!
Oh, rapture!</i>

1447
01:36:36,423 --> 01:36:39,187
<i>Summon your men
and effect their capture!</i>

1448
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:40,852
<i>Frederic, save us!</i>

1449
01:36:40,928 --> 01:36:44,955
<i>Beautiful Mabel,
I would if I could,
but I am not able</i>

1450
01:36:45,032 --> 01:36:48,490
<i>He's telling the truth,
he is not able</i>

1451
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:56,435
<i>With base deceit</i>

1452
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:59,638
<i>You worked
upon our feelings</i>

1453
01:36:59,914 --> 01:37:02,007
<i>Revenge is sweet</i>

1454
01:37:02,082 --> 01:37:05,518
<i>And flavors
all our dealings</i>

1455
01:37:05,586 --> 01:37:07,645
<i>With courage rare</i>

1456
01:37:07,721 --> 01:37:10,986
<i>And resolution manly</i>

1457
01:37:11,358 --> 01:37:13,758
<i>For death prepare</i>

1458
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:20,358
<i>Unhappy General Stanley</i>

1459
01:37:21,302 --> 01:37:23,065
<i>Is he to die</i>

1460
01:37:23,137 --> 01:37:26,573
<i>No!
Unshriven, unannealed?</i>

1461
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:29,734
<i>Oh, spare him!</i>

1462
01:37:30,211 --> 01:37:34,875
<i>Will no one in his cause
a weapon wield</i>

1463
01:37:34,949 --> 01:37:37,816
<i>Oh, spare him!</i>

1464
01:37:38,352 --> 01:37:43,051
<i>Yes, we are here,
though hitherto concealed</i>

1465
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:46,123
<i>Oh, rapture!</i>

1466
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:47,522
What do we do?

1467
01:37:47,595 --> 01:37:50,996
<i>So to Constabulary,
pirates yield</i>

1468
01:37:51,065 --> 01:37:54,159
<i>Oh, rapture!</i>

1469
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:57,230
To them, lads!

1470
01:38:39,246 --> 01:38:40,611
Charge! Ow!

1471
01:38:41,715 --> 01:38:45,583
Kill! Kill!
Come on, boy,
sic 'em, sic 'em!

1472
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:48,554
Come on, boy, bite them!
Bite those pirates!

1473
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:55,926
Sit!

1474
01:39:01,268 --> 01:39:02,565
Away!

1475
01:39:25,693 --> 01:39:31,222
<i>Sailors always
welcome ladies</i>

1476
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:37,502
<i>Most politely</i>

1477
01:39:46,947 --> 01:39:50,439
<i>Now give three cheers</i>

1478
01:39:50,517 --> 01:39:53,350
<i>I'll lead the way</i>

1479
01:39:54,021 --> 01:39:56,888
<i>Hurrah! Hurrah!</i>

1480
01:39:57,358 --> 01:40:07,126
<i>Hurray!</i>

1481
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:28,452
Kill them!

1482
01:41:56,276 --> 01:42:00,235
<i>To gain a brief advantage
you've contrived</i>

1483
01:42:00,314 --> 01:42:04,307
<i>But your proud triumph
will not be long-lived</i>

1484
01:42:04,718 --> 01:42:08,620
<i>Don't say you are orphans,
for we know that game</i>

1485
01:42:08,689 --> 01:42:12,989
<i>On your allegiance
we've a stronger claim</i>

1486
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:17,861
<i>We charge, you yield</i>

1487
01:42:17,965 --> 01:42:22,265
<i>We charge, you yield</i>

1488
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:26,272
<i>In Queen</i>

1489
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:33,212
<i>Victoria's name</i>

1490
01:42:36,383 --> 01:42:39,944
<i>You do?</i>

1491
01:42:40,254 --> 01:42:42,484
<i>We do!</i>

1492
01:42:42,589 --> 01:42:48,619
<i>We charge, you yield</i>

1493
01:42:48,695 --> 01:42:52,859
<i>In Queen</i>

1494
01:42:52,933 --> 01:42:59,805
<i>Victoria's name</i>

1495
01:43:03,343 --> 01:43:07,211
<i>We yield at once</i>

1496
01:43:07,948 --> 01:43:12,942
<i>With humbled mien</i>

1497
01:43:13,787 --> 01:43:20,249
<i>Because with all our faults</i>

1498
01:43:20,327 --> 01:43:25,026
<i>We love</i>

1499
01:43:25,098 --> 01:43:28,659
<i>Our Queen</i>

1500
01:43:29,469 --> 01:43:31,096
<i>Yes, yes</i>

1501
01:43:31,171 --> 01:43:34,163
<i>With all their faults</i>

1502
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:38,940
<i>They love their Queen</i>

1503
01:43:39,279 --> 01:43:41,110
<i>Yes, yes</i>

1504
01:43:41,415 --> 01:43:44,782
<i>With all their faults
With all our faults</i>

1505
01:43:44,851 --> 01:43:51,780
<i>They love their Queen
We love our Queen</i>

1506
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,851
<i>Away with them</i>

1507
01:43:55,929 --> 01:44:01,390
<i>And place them
at the bar</i>

1508
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:04,204
<i>One moment!</i>

1509
01:44:05,005 --> 01:44:09,305
<i>Let me tell you
who they are</i>

1510
01:44:09,876 --> 01:44:16,805
<i>They are no members
of the common throng</i>

1511
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:21,717
<i>They are all noblemen</i>

1512
01:44:21,788 --> 01:44:28,455
<i>Who have gone wrong</i>

1513
01:44:28,895 --> 01:44:32,956
<i>They are all noblemen</i>

1514
01:44:33,033 --> 01:44:38,335
<i>Who have gone wrong</i>

1515
01:44:41,575 --> 01:44:47,172
<i>No Englishman unmoved
that statement hears</i>

1516
01:44:47,414 --> 01:44:51,510
<i>Because,
with all our faults</i>

1517
01:44:51,752 --> 01:44:56,348
<i>We love</i>

1518
01:44:56,490 --> 01:45:01,587
<i>Our House of Peers</i>

1519
01:45:02,396 --> 01:45:05,593
<i>I pray you, pardon me,
ex-Pirate King</i>

1520
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:08,362
<i>Peers will be peers,
and youth
will have its fling</i>

1521
01:45:08,435 --> 01:45:11,563
<i>Resume your ranks
and legislative duties</i>

1522
01:45:11,638 --> 01:45:14,937
<i>And take my daughters</i>

1523
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:19,104
<i>All of whom are beauties</i>

1524
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:25,241
<i>At length we are provided
with unusual facility</i>

1525
01:45:25,452 --> 01:45:30,856
<i>To change piratic crime
for dignified
respectability</i>

1526
01:45:31,191 --> 01:45:36,219
<i>Combined I needn't say with
the unparalleled felicity</i>

1527
01:45:36,296 --> 01:45:40,130
<i>Of what we have
been longing for</i>

1528
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:45,137
<i>Unbounded domesticity</i>

1529
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:51,069
<i>Tomorrow morning early
we will quickly
be parsonified</i>

1530
01:45:51,144 --> 01:45:56,343
<i>Hymeneally coupled,
conjugally matrimonified</i>

1531
01:45:56,750 --> 01:46:01,949
<i>And this
shall be accomplished
by the doctor of divinity</i>

1532
01:46:02,422 --> 01:46:09,328
<i>Who happily resides
in the immediate vicinity</i>

1533
01:46:10,664 --> 01:46:18,830
<i>Who happily resides
in the immediate vicinity</i>

1534
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:23,070
<i>My military knowledge,
though I'm plucky
and adventury</i>

1535
01:46:23,143 --> 01:46:25,509
<i>Has only been brought down
to the beginning
of the century</i>

1536
01:46:25,579 --> 01:46:28,139
<i>But still
in getting off my daughters</i>

1537
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:31,582
<i>Eight or nine
or ten in all</i>

1538
01:46:31,685 --> 01:46:35,519
<i>I've shown myself
the model of</i>

1539
01:46:35,589 --> 01:46:37,113
<i>A modern Major-General</i>

1540
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:38,555
<i>But still
in getting off his daughters</i>

<i>Eight or nine
or ten in all</i>

<i>He's shown himself
the model of a modern
Major-General</i>

1543
01:46:49,703 --> 01:46:53,161
<i>Poor wandering ones</i>

1544
01:46:53,774 --> 01:46:57,107
<i>Though ye have
surely strayed</i>

1545
01:46:57,878 --> 01:47:02,076
<i>Take heart of grace,
your steps retrace</i>

1546
01:47:02,149 --> 01:47:09,055
<i>Poor wandering ones</i>

1547
01:47:10,056 --> 01:47:13,617
<i>Poor wandering ones</i>

1548
01:47:14,361 --> 01:47:17,888
<i>If such poor love as ours</i>

1549
01:47:18,498 --> 01:47:20,591
<i>Can help you find</i>

1550
01:47:20,667 --> 01:47:25,604
<i>True peace of mind</i>

1551
01:47:25,672 --> 01:47:29,574
<i>Why, take it</i>

1552
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:33,846
<i>It is yours</i>

1553
01:47:34,981 --> 01:47:37,347
<i>Poor wandering ones</i>

1554
01:47:38,618 --> 01:47:40,677
<i>Poor wandering ones</i>

1555
01:47:42,989 --> 01:47:44,456
<i>Take heart</i>

1556
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:46,281
<i>Take heart</i>

1557
01:47:54,734 --> 01:47:57,328
