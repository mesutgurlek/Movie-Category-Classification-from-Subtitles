TONIGHT SANTA CLAUS COMES.

HE HOLDS HIS BREATH
LIKE THIS.

114
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,860
THAT'S LIKE TRYING
TO GET A BASKETBALL

00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:22,041
## AND FILL THEIR HEARTS
WITH CHRISTMAS ##

167
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,543
## SPIRIT THEY CAN SHARE ##

168
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:30,049
## THAT'S THE BEST PART
OF CHRISTMAS ##

169
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:34,053
## AND IF THAT ISN'T
A TRUE BLUE MIRACLE ##

170
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:38,057
## I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ONE IS ##

171
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,560
## AND IF THAT ISN'T
A TRUE BLUE MIRACLE ##

172
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:46,065
## I DON'T KNOW WHAT ONE IS ##

173
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:46,065
## I DON'T KNOW WHAT ONE IS ##

174
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,572
THIS IS REALLY
GOING TO LOOK GREAT.

175
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,074
SMELLS GOOD.

176
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,576
THIS KEEPS
YOUR EARS WARM.

177
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,078
GO ON!

178
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,080
HEY, OSCAR, WAIT!

179
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,084
I KNOW HOW SANTA
GETS DOWN THE CHIMNEY.

180
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:09,588
HE TIES HIS BIG BELT
TIGHT AROUND HIS WASTE.

181
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:14,593
IT MAKES HIM SO SKINNY,
HE FITS DOWN THE CHIMNEY.

182
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:18,597
YOU ARE WITHOUT A DOUBT 
THE STUPIDEST...

183
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,600
[TRAIN ROARING BY]

184
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:21,600
[TRAIN ROARING BY]

185
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,107
BIRD I EVER MET.

186
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:28,607
BIRD I EVER MET.

187
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:40,119
## BUT THE GREATEST WONDER
OF THEM ALL ##

188
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:44,623
## IS NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING
AROUND YOU ##

189
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:51,130
## IT'S THE WAY
YOU START TO BE ##

190
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,134
## YES, THE GREATEST WONDER
OF THEM ALL ##

191
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,637
## IS HOW YOUR HEART
IS FILLED WITH LOVE ##

192
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:06,645
## YOU START TO LIGHT UP
LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE ##

193
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,648
OSCAR, SANTA COVERS
HIMSELF WITH BUTTER

194
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:13,652
SO HE CAN SLIP
RIGHT DOWN THE CHIMNEY.

195
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:13,652
SO HE CAN SLIP
RIGHT DOWN THE CHIMNEY.

196
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,156
DING-DONG,
YOU'RE WRONG.

197
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,659
I DON'T THINK
THERE IS A WAY

198
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,662
HE CAN GET DOWN THE CHIMNEY.

199
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,664
AND IF HE DOESN'T,

200
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:29,168
NO YOU-KNOW-WHATS
TOMORROW MORNING.

201
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:29,168
NO YOU-KNOW-WHATS
TOMORROW MORNING.

202
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,672
## FEELINGS
FEEL SO WONDERFUL ##

203
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:37,676
## YOU HAVE TO
LET THEM SHOW ##

204
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,180
## MAYBE THAT'S WHY
EVERYONE ##

205
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,682
## BEGINS TO GET
A GLOW ##

206
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:48,687
## AND FILL THEIR HEARTS
WITH CHRISTMAS ##

207
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,190
## SPIRIT THEY CAN SHARE ##

208
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:56,695
## THAT'S THE BEST PART
OF CHRISTMAS ##

209
00:14:56,695 --> 00:15:00,199
## AND IF THAT ISN'T
A TRUE BLUE MIRACLE ##

210
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:04,203
## I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ONE IS ##

211
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,207
## AND IF THAT ISN'T
A TRUE BLUE MIRACLE ##

212
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,210
## I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ONE IS ####

213
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:11,210
## I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ONE IS ####

214
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,214
HI, BIG BIRD.

215
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,715
HI, PATTY.

216
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,218
HOW WAS
THE SKATING PARTY?

217
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,719
OH, O.K.

218
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,721
JUST O.K.?
WHAT'S WRONG?

219
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,724
EVERYTHING WAS O.K.
UNTIL OSCAR STARTED...

220
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:30,229
"HOW DOES SANTA CLAUS
GET DOWN THOSE SKINNY CHIMNEYS

221
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,730
WHEN HE'S SO FAT?"

222
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,233
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT.

223
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:38,737
"IF HE CAN'T GET DOWN,
NO ONE WILL GET PRESENTS!"

224
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,240
THAT'S WHAT OSCAR SAYS.

225
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,243
I SEE. LET US
CONSIDER THE QUESTION.

226
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:49,748
HOW DOES BIG, FAT SANTA CLAUS
GET DOWN THOSE SKINNY CHIMNEYS?

227
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,250
WELL...AHEM.

228
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,254
LET US LOOK AT IT
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE.

229
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,257
UH...RETURNING
TO THE FIRST ANGLE,

230
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,260
IT'S A SIMPLE MATTER
OF, UH...

231
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,263
I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT IT BEFORE.

232
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,765
HOW DOES HE DO IT?

233
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,769
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE! 
WE GOT TO FIND OUT!

234
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,773
WHO KNOWS MORE
ABOUT SANTA THAN ANYBODY?

235
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,275
THE ELVES.

236
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,776
MRS. CLAUS?

237
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:18,777
MACY'S.

238
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,779
KIDS. THAT'S WHO.

239
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,780
KIDS?

240
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,282
YEAH, KIDS!

241
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,285
I WILL GO ASK SOME KIDS

242
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,288
AND BE RIGHT BACK
WITH THE ANSWER.

243
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:34,293
KERMIT, I AM A KID, 
AND I DON'T KNOW.

244
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,296
THAT'S OUR FIRST ANSWER,
ISN'T IT?

245
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:37,796
THAT'S OUR FIRST ANSWER,
ISN'T IT?

246
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,703
GOLLY...
CHRISTMAS EVE.

247
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,706
I STILL DON'T
HAVE AN IDEA

248
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,708
FOR ERNIE'S PRESENT.

249
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,711
IT'S GOT TO BE
REALLY SPECIAL.

250
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:53,712
[QUACK]

251
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,714
WHAT IS--

252
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,217
OH, ERNIE'S RUBBER DUCKIE.

253
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,718
[SIGH]

254
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,220
HEY, WAIT!

255
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,223
THAT GIVES ME
A NEAT-O IDEA!

256
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,226
I WILL GET ERNIE
A SOAP DISH

257
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,728
TO PUT
HIS RUBBER DUCKIE IN!

258
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,231
WHAT A NIFTY IDEA!

259
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:12,231
WHAT A NIFTY IDEA!

260
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,235
I AM HOME, BERT.

261
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,237
OH, BERT?

262
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,739
OH! WHAT'S THIS?

263
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:24,743
IT'S A PAPER CLIP FROM
BERT'S PAPER CLIP COLLECTION.

264
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,747
OF COURSE!
THIS IS BERT'S 1957 ACME.

265
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:32,251
HE WOULD FEEL AWFUL
IF HE LOST THIS.

266
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:36,755
I KNOW WHAT
I WILL GET BERT FOR CHRISTMAS!

267
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:41,260
A CIGAR BOX
TO KEEP HIS PAPER CLIPS IN!

268
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,263
THEY WILL NEVER
GET LOST AGAIN.

269
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:44,263
THEY WILL NEVER
GET LOST AGAIN.

270
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,768
IF SANTA CLAUS
HAS TO DELIVER

271
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,771
ALL THOSE PRESENTS
ON CHRISTMAS EVE,

272
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,275
HOW DOES HE GET DOWN
THE CHIMNEY?

273
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,776
EASY.

274
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,279
WITH THE BAG
OF PRESENTS.

275
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:01,780
HOW?

276
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,284
HE COMES DOWN
WITH HIS REINDEERS.

277
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:05,284
HE COMES DOWN
WITH HIS REINDEERS.

278
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:09,788
ALL THE REINDEER

279
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,791
JOIN HIM
DOWN THE CHIMNEY?

280
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,293
YES.

281
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,795
YOU MEAN
IT'S A PARTY?

282
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:21,300
YES. THEY PUT THE PRESENTS,
THEN THEY GO UP.

283
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,802
DON'T THE ANTLERS
GET STUCK?

284
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:24,803
NO.

285
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:25,804
WHY?

286
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,307
HE TIES
THE ANTLERS TOGETHER...

287
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,808
WITH TAPE.

288
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:29,808
WITH TAPE.

289
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,313
TELL ME,
HOW DOES HE DO IT?

290
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,814
HE SLIDES!

291
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,316
SLIDES?

292
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:41,320
WAIT! MAYBE HE IS MAGIC
AND GROWS SMALL.

293
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,821
THROUGH THE DOOR.

294
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,823
HE GOTS
HIS KEYS.

295
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,825
WHAT KEYS?

296
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,329
SANTA CLAUS KEYS.

297
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,331
HE SQUISHES!

298
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,333
WHAT HAPPENS
IF SANTA

299
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,835
CANNOT GET DOWN
THE CHIMNEY,

300
00:18:56,835 --> 00:19:00,339
AND THE WINDOW
AND DOOR ARE LOCKED?

301
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,841
HE WILL NEVER
BRING THE PRESENTS

302
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,843
EVER AGAIN!

303
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,345
WHAT HAPPENS?

304
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,347
I DON'T KNOW.

305
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,849
MAYBE THEY WILL MOVE.

306
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,851
HE PUSHES THE BUTTON,

307
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,355
THEN IT OPENS,
AND HE GETS IN!

308
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,859
HE STEPS ON THE BIG STEP,
THEN HE GOES IN.

309
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,862
AND THERE
YOU HAVE IT.

310
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,864
SPIRIT

311
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,866
GIVING

312
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,368
PEACE

313
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,870
BOB IS COMING!

314
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:31,870
BOB IS COMING!

315
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,273
HI, KIDS.

316
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,774
HI, BOB.

317
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,776
LINDA, YOU ARE EARLY.

318
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:42,781
WE HAVE TO REHEARSE
A SONG WITH THE KIDS.

319
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:46,285
WOULD YOU MIND WAITING?

320
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,788
MAYBE YOU CAN
READ A MAGAZINE.

321
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,290
O.K.?

322
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,791
O.K. GOOD.

323
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:52,791
O.K. GOOD.

324
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,795
EVERYBODY
ALL READY?

325
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,297
YES.

326
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:02,301
RUBY, WOULD YOU

00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:59,716
I MUST HAVE
FALLEN ASLEEP.

980
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,718
WOW! AM I COLD!

981
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:05,722
I BETTER GO DOWN
TO GORDON AND SUSAN'S

982
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:08,725
AND WARM UP
FOR A MINUTE.

983
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:09,726
BRRR!

984
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:09,726
BRRR!

985
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:15,732
OOH! I THINK
I FROZE MY GIBLETS!

986
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:15,732
OOH! I THINK
I FROZE MY GIBLETS!

987
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:23,240
LET'S GO INSIDE
AND GET WARMED UP,

988
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,743
CALL YOUR MOTHER
SO SHE DOESN'T WORRY.

989
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:29,246
BIG BIRD!

990
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:31,248
OH, HI, PATTY.

991
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,250
HOW ARE YOU?

992
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,751
FINE.

993
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,753
HI. I WAS--

994
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:39,256
OH, HI, GORDON.
HI, SUSAN.

995
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,258
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

996
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,760
YES, EXCEPT
FOR MY GIBLETS.

997
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,763
BIG BIRD,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

998
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:51,768
I WENT UP ON THE ROOF
TO WATCH FOR SANTA.

999
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:56,773
I GOT SO COLD,
I CAME DOWN TO WARM UP,

1000
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,776
BUT I'M GOING
RIGHT BACK UP.

1001
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:03,780
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
COME IN AND THAW OUT.

1002
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:03,780
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
COME IN AND THAW OUT.

1003
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,316
OH, DEAR.

1004
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:43,320
NOW I'LL NEVER KNOW 
HOW HE DID IT.

1005
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,324
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT OSCAR SAID TO YOU?

1006
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:49,826
OSCAR SAID
THAT IF SANTA

1007
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:52,829
CAN'T GET DOWN
THOSE LITTLE CHIMNEYS,

1008
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:55,832
NO ONE WOULD GET
ANY PRESENTS.

1009
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:57,834
WELL, LOOK AROUND YOU.

1010
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:00,337
DOES IT LOOK TO YOU

1011
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:03,340
LIKE NO ONE'S
GETTING ANY PRESENTS?

1012
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,842
NO, BUT IT'S
A MIRACLE.

1013
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:08,345
HOW DID HE DO IT?

1014
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:11,348
WHY DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW?

1015
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:12,849
IT'S IMPORTANT.

1016
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:14,851
NO, BIG BIRD.

1017
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,853
THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

1018
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:18,355
WHATISIMPORTANT

1019
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:20,857
IS WE LOST YOU TONIGHT.

1020
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:23,860
WE WERE VERY WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

1021
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,863
NOW YOU'RE BACK,
SAFE AND SOUND,

1022
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:30,367
AND WE'RE ALL TOGETHER
FOR CHRISTMAS AGAIN.

1023
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:30,367
AND WE'RE ALL TOGETHER
FOR CHRISTMAS AGAIN.

1024
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:39,876
## AND IF THAT ISN'T
A TRUE BLUE MIRACLE ##

1025
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:45,882
## I DON'T KNOW WHAT ONE IS ####

1026
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:45,882
## I DON'T KNOW WHAT ONE IS ####

1027
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:52,389
I HEAR
THE TURKEY'S BACK.

1028
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,391
RIGHT, OSCAR.
COME IN.

1029
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:54,391
RIGHT, OSCAR.
COME IN.

1030
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,896
WELL, HI, THERE, OSCAR.

1031
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,899
HEY, LISTEN,
YOU BIG CANARY,

1032
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,902
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK,

1033
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:09,906
'CAUSE I WANT TO
ASK YOU A QUESTION.

1034
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:11,908
SURE. WHAT IS IT?

1035
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:14,411
HOW CAN
THE EASTER BUNNY

1036
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:17,914
HIDE ALL THOSE EGGS 
IN ONE NIGHT?

1037
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,916
OSCAR!
OSCAR!

1038
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:19,916
OSCAR!
OSCAR!

1039
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:31,548
## YES, KEEP
CHRISTMAS WITH YOU ##

1040
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:46,062
## ALL THROUGH THE YEAR ##

1041
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:46,062
## ALL THROUGH THE YEAR ##

1042
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:51,067
AHH!

1043
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:51,067
AHH!

1044
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:55,071
OHH.

1045
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,073
AWHH.

1046
00:57:57,073 --> 00:58:00,577
OHH. AWWH. OH.

1047
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:02,579

BUT DOUGLAS FIR

OH. URP.

00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,594

OH, THAT A LONG ONE.
