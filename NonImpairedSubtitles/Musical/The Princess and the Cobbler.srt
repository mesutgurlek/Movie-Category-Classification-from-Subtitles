72
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:48,817
No...

156

The world is mine to take.

157
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,199
Eh, Fido?

158
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:37,636

I fear you haven't eaten yet.

172
00:28:49,418 --> 00:28:52,411
For you, dear bird, a special treat

173
00:28:52,536 --> 00:28:53,899
For breakfast

174
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,838
you'll have cobbler to eat.

175
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,904
Thief!

176
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,873
Stop, thief!

177
00:30:25,886 --> 00:30:28,941
Youll have the head for starters

178
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:32,177
then the neck and then the heart.

179
00:30:32,318 --> 00:30:35,089
Such a tasty little man, eh...

180
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:38,427
My flying garbage can?

181
00:30:40,327 --> 00:30:43,957
There's your breakfast, Fido dear

182
00:30:44,139 --> 00:30:47,224
You can eat it up, right here.

183
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:08,068
Zigzag! Zigzag!

184
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:12,953
Get me Zigza!... Now!

Fido, affairs of State.

189

Coming, Your Majesty,  coming!

190
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,442
Oh Great King Nod, have no fear!

191
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,794
Zigzag, your Grand Vizir is here

192
00:32:03,876 --> 00:32:06,576
Death and destruction, Zigzag

193
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:11,916
My kingdom will come to
destruction and death.

194

Calm, Serene Highness.

195

You must catch your breath

196
00:32:16,974 --> 00:32:19,179
What dawn of disaster?

197
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:22,838
Why speak you of death?

198
00:32:22,964 --> 00:32:25,654
A nightmare... no, a vision!

199
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,466
A vision of invasion!

200
00:32:55,678 --> 00:32:59,569
An entire race of one eyed men!

201
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:03,271
And death... death, everywhere.

202
00:33:03,443 --> 00:33:06,818
Excellent Majesty, Ruler Supreme!

203
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:09,232
I can safely assure you

204
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,861
a dream's just a dream.

205
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:40,350
I saw it, I tell you!

206
00:33:40,406 --> 00:33:43,054
Calm down, Your Highness.

207
00:33:43,226 --> 00:33:46,588
Invaders?! One-eyed?!

208
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:50,433
But, this is against what has been profecied.

209
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:54,904
For, has it not been written,
we are safe from any threat.

210
00:33:55,055 --> 00:33:59,716
as long as those three golden
balls are on the minaret?

211
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:27,602
Aah! What if the balls are taken away?

212
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,597
A way has never been found

213
00:34:30,712 --> 00:34:32,962
to take them away.

214
00:34:33,122 --> 00:34:34,661
What freak of nature

215
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:38,048

top of that minaret?

216
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:31,443
*Sangre! Fire!

217
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,318
-Catastrofe! Calamity!
-Oh my dear!

218
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:37,208
Such things could never happen here

219
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:40,525
Such things have never occurred here.

220
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:43,158
Well, they haven't happened yet!

221
00:35:43,263 --> 00:35:45,138
Oh, can't you see?

222
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:49,416
The golden balls are
safe atop the minaret!

223
00:36:43,692 --> 00:36:46,481
I - I just...

224
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:50,906
have this funny feeling.

225
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:44,072
It's not time to get up, too early to arise,

226
00:39:44,235 --> 00:39:48,645
too early to open the King's sleepy eyes.

227
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:50,505
Wait, wait father!

228
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,888
Something's happening!

229
00:41:04,647 --> 00:41:07,761
Is this the opportunity ringing?

230
00:41:08,817 --> 00:41:13,153
I thunk there are some balls,
you should be bringing.

231
00:41:15,615 --> 00:41:19,255
Get those balls. Keep out of sight.

232
00:41:19,419 --> 00:41:23,060
Bring them to me late tonight.

233
00:41:39,084 --> 00:41:41,185
Who won?

234
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,343
Won?

235
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:58,443
One... eye...

236
00:41:58,552 --> 00:42:01,130
Won?!... I?

237
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:04,178

238
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,044
One I?!

239
00:42:06,632 --> 00:42:07,505
Aye?!

240
00:42:07,629 --> 00:42:10,033
One eye!!!

241
00:42:16,114 --> 00:42:17,802
Alla barad!

242
00:42:19,138 --> 00:42:22,240
The balls are gone!

243
00:42:22,895 --> 00:42:27,021
My kingdom will come to
destruction and death!

246
00:42:50,976 --> 00:42:56,215
The three golden
balls have gone!

247
00:42:58,946 --> 00:43:04,497
Our city faces invasion!

248
00:43:05,904 --> 00:43:11,548
The mighty One Eye is coming

249
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:17,124
Take up your positions!

250
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:20,771
With my blessing.

251
00:43:21,592 --> 00:43:24,576
<i>Long live King Nod!</i>

252
00:43:25,178 --> 00:43:28,178
<i>Long live King Nod!</i>

253
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,311
Nanny, where could my cobbler be?

254
00:43:48,414 --> 00:43:49,824
Try the prision.

255
00:43:49,874 --> 00:43:52,418
What? Oh, no!

256
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,333
What goes on in this palace?

257
00:43:55,506 --> 00:43:58,084
<i>Ah, lovely balls!</i>

258
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:04,568
<i>Use the door you idiot!</i>

259
00:45:16,851 --> 00:45:19,099
Oh, I see who jailed you.

260
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,169
Get away, bird of evil!

261
00:45:25,405 --> 00:45:28,482
Get back to your master's tower!

262
00:45:37,414 --> 00:45:38,786
Gone!...

263
00:45:41,123 --> 00:45:47,433
Thief! Thief!

264
00:45:49,065 --> 00:45:55,625
Thief! Thief!

265
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:11,303
Gentlemen, gentlemen! What a delight!

266
00:47:17,678 --> 00:47:21,288
We'll let this be our little secret...

267
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,154
All right?

268
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:33,945
I'll rule the land, after one little thing.

269
00:47:37,218 --> 00:47:39,941
Now that I have the balls,

270
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:42,668
I will go see the king

271
00:47:47,121 --> 00:47:49,927
Have no fear, Zigzag, your Gran...

272
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:54,128
You're here, Zigzag, but where are the balls?

273
00:47:54,393 --> 00:47:56,544
Magicked away, my Lord.

274
00:47:56,616 --> 00:47:58,739
Magicked away?!

275
00:47:59,153 --> 00:48:01,588
Oh, no...

276
00:48:01,714 --> 00:48:04,924
Oh, you mustn't look so tragic.

277
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:08,703
I am not unschooled in magic.

278
00:48:09,098 --> 00:48:11,177
You mean... you?!

279
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,216
Alakazam!

280
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:16,099
Observe!

281
00:48:18,164 --> 00:48:20,117
Look at that!

282
00:48:23,062 --> 00:48:24,396
There's something...

283
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:30,411
You see, I can restore you the gold balls,
though they be lost.

284
00:48:30,524 --> 00:48:33,802
I'll give you anything, Zigzag
Just do it!

285
00:48:33,904 --> 00:48:36,080
As my peril will be dire,

286
00:48:36,187 --> 00:48:39,200
you must grant my heart's desire.

287
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:40,575
Which is?

288
00:48:40,654 --> 00:48:42,957
I require, Sire,

289
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:47,941
your daughter Yumyum, to wed.

290
00:48:49,836 --> 00:48:53,669
You... want my daughter?!

291
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,760
Never!

292
00:48:57,005 --> 00:48:58,105
Never?

Well, I just thought I'd ask.

We'll see who wins at the end of the day!

We'll see who ends up grieving!

298
00:49:18,885 --> 00:49:21,655
I'll go to One Eye, right away.

But we may have one chance.

313

There is a mad and holy old witch

who dwells at the top
of the desert mountain.

You must go and seek out this witch.

Perhaps she can tell us how
the city can be saved.

317

Had I a son, I would send him

Father, I can handle it.

At the foot of the desert mountain...

320
00:50:26,191 --> 00:50:30,971
is a golden idol, with a priceless
ruby set in its forehead.

321
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:34,940
When the desert sun is directly overhead,

322
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:38,951
the reflection of the ruby
falls upon a hidden door

323
00:50:39,021 --> 00:50:41,122
to a path up the mountain.

324
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,980
Yes father.

325
00:50:43,831 --> 00:50:47,794
You must cross the great desret. Go now!

326

Father, we need a guide!

327
00:50:52,495 --> 00:50:53,927
Yes, but who?

I am a magician -- sorcerer too.

408
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:53,799
And I'm in a position,
I think, to serve you.

409
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:56,246
Sorcerer?

410
00:58:01,592 --> 00:58:04,716
I conjure demons,

411
00:58:06,009 --> 00:58:08,089
charm beasts,

412
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:12,878
and birds of prey too.

414
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:28,569

00:58:31,581 --> 00:58:32,940
Haha!

416
00:58:38,167 --> 00:58:40,718

417
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:43,710
though they may appear complex

418
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:49,013
for me, they fall like playing cards.

419
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:52,298
And I control the deck!

420
00:59:00,134 --> 00:59:02,654
But all this is nothing,

421
00:59:02,836 --> 00:59:05,936
for, now, in my hand

422
00:59:06,072 --> 00:59:11,022
is the very key to the golden land!

423
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:15,976
For, no man can take it, no matter how great

424
00:59:16,629 --> 00:59:20,064
unless he possesses...

425
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,911
these three balls of fate!

426
00:59:28,075 --> 00:59:34,613
You say you can charm beasts?

427
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:45,494
Throw him to the alligators!

429
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:17,592

ought to be staying here.

440
01:02:36,123 --> 01:02:39,255
Yes, Roofless, you stay here.

441
01:02:39,396 --> 01:02:42,076
Guard the exit, we're going up.

Match... match!

473
01:11:08,972 --> 01:11:10,394
Attack...

474
01:11:10,815 --> 01:11:12,314
a tack.

475
01:11:13,678 --> 01:11:15,013
Hah!

476
01:11:16,036 --> 01:11:17,342
A tack.

477
01:11:18,177 --> 01:11:19,427
See?

478
01:11:19,545 --> 01:11:24,427
But it's what you do
with what you got!

479
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,084
Go home!

480
01:11:29,631 --> 01:11:33,748
Noooowww!...

481
01:11:56,665 --> 01:12:00,314
Faster! Faster! Faster!

482
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,083
Take me to your master!

483
01:12:07,588 --> 01:12:10,660
One mistake will suffice.

484
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:13,972
Don't treat me lightly twice.

485
01:12:14,323 --> 01:12:16,403
Take me to your master!

486
01:12:23,035 --> 01:12:26,402
Gentlemen, we must return at once!

487
01:12:26,481 --> 01:12:30,591
Your Majesty, if there's one thing myself and my men are good at...

488
01:12:30,823 --> 01:12:32,036
Good at ?

489
01:12:32,134 --> 01:12:35,747
We're good at making our getaway!

490
01:12:35,828 --> 01:12:37,328
We're good at running.

491
01:12:37,415 --> 01:12:39,116
- Away!
- Away!

492
01:12:41,521 --> 01:12:43,013
Banzai!

493
01:12:50,976 --> 01:12:53,376
Get set, GO!!

494
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:59,177
Now, shall we slaughter?

495
01:12:59,509 --> 01:13:03,649
Except for the Princess,
that, we agreed.

496
01:13:03,831 --> 01:13:08,707
She is the price for my traitorous deed.

497
01:13:09,476 --> 01:13:13,651
Their soldiers will cower behind these walls

498

the three golden balls.

My friends, my friends, are you still here?
