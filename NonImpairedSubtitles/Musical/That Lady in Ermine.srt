1
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:19,283
Lady in Ermine,
lady in white

2
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:26,324
This is the moment,
tonight is the night!

3
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:32,282
THAT LADY IN ERMINE

4
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:35,923
This is the castle of Bergamo,
and the principality of Bergamo,

5
00:01:36,047 --> 00:01:37,719
in south eastern Europe.

6
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,519
The year is 1861.

7
00:01:40,487 --> 00:01:42,876
This is the castle's ancestral gallery.

8
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:46,043
Every night, old Luigi bids
goodnight to his dead masters

9
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:48,597
who, through the centuries,
ruled from this castle

10
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:49,795
in peace and war.

11
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:52,965
Mostly in war,
for small Bergamo

12
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:56,557
holds a strategically important
position on the road to Rome.

13
00:01:56,767 --> 00:02:01,124
There in the background is Count Giovanni,
a famous poet in his time.

14
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,962
Next, Countess Isabella.
This is Count Dominic.

15
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:06,520
This is Orlando...

16
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:10,442
And this is Count Alberto,
the great-great-great-great grandfather

17
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:13,400
of the presently ruling
Countess Angelina.

18
00:02:13,527 --> 00:02:16,963
His wife, Francesca,
called the Lady in Ermine,

19
00:02:17,127 --> 00:02:19,287
saved the castle 300 years ago,

20
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:21,962
from a mighty conqueror
in a moment of danger.

21
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:24,601
But tonight Francesca is happy,

22
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:30,877
for her great-great-great-great granddaughter
Angelina, will be married tomorrow.

23
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:55,763
And this is Angelina,
ruling Countess of Bergamo,

24
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:59,962
great-great-great-great granddaughter,
of the Lady in Ermine.

25
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:42,284
It was a beautiful ceremony, wasn't it?

26
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:43,442
Yes, very.

27
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:46,643
And the devotion of the people,
it was touching.

28
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:50,442
They all seemed so happy.
They were taking to you, I could feel it.

29
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:51,716
Strange.

30
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:54,447
One can be prepared,
and yet when it happens...

31
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,076
Well, I've known all these years
than when a simple baron

32
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,158
marries into a family of
sovereign lineage it...

33
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:01,881
Darling, it was just a formality.

34
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,680
Yes, I know it, and yet when I had
to kneel before you

35
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:07,037
and you crossed the sword over my head,
and you raised me to the rank of

36
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:09,800
the Count of Bergamo,
it was a feeling of...

37
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:13,079
Well, I'm sure I will get over it.

38
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:18,443
I'll tell you how I felt
at the same moment,

39
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,558
Just as I was about to
make you a Bergamo...

40
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:23,406
Do you realise how heavy
that big ancestral sword is?

41
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:26,126
I was so frightened,
if that sword had fallen on your head,

42
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:28,482
you would have never found out
that you had become a Bergamo.

43
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:31,206
And I would have been a widow
before I became a wife.

44
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:35,236
But darling, the sword didn't fall.
And here we are.

45
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:37,722
One Bergamo and another Bergamo.

46
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:39,798
Darling, try to understand...

47
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:42,361
When you put the ring on my finger,
it suddenly dawned on me that

48
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:46,804
you were going to be the count, and frankly,
I don't think I'll be very happy as a countess.

49
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:47,717
But, darling...

50
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:49,439
Oh and when he asked me to
promise to obey, I...

51
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:51,205
... I could have killed that man.

52
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,840
Do you remember when we were children?

53
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:55,720
You were nine years old,
and our parents pledged us in marriage,

54
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:58,003
and after we had promised
to obey that pledge,

55
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:00,561
I stuck out my tongue at you,
and you pushed me into the flowerbed?

56
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:01,477
Well, I...

57
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,764
Darling, if you ever doubt that you are
the master, take me in the garden.

58
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,519
The flowerbed is still there.

59
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:07,636
Thank you, Angelina.

60
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:10,645
Oh Mario, I want this
to be a glorious marriage,

61
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:15,443
With quarrels and making up, with tears
and kisses. Always something happening!

62
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:18,839
I want to be a good wife,
not only because it's right, but because

63
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:24,076
I once read a book, or maybe I heard it,
that when you fall in love,

64
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:30,642
somewhere, or somehow, you hear the
sound of a flute, way off in the distance.

65
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,120
Well we can do much better.

66
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:37,404
I'll get a whole orchestra, by your window.
How does that sound, eh?

67
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:42,524
I ask for so little,
yet you offer me so much...

68
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:43,722
That's my nature.

69
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,562
What's that?
- I didn't order a salute.

70
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:50,076
And I gave strict orders against it.
With a firing line so close

71
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:51,646
It might cause a turmoil.

72
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:59,926
- What is it?
- The enemy, they've broken through our lines.

73
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:03,317
The Hungarian hussars
are on their way to the castle.

74
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:05,520
Oh my dear countess!

75
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:08,485
I carried you in my arms
when you were a baby.

76
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,319
Those soldiers are ours!

77
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:17,842
Our troops, retreating from Hungarians!

78
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:20,964
I gave everybody downstairs
instructions on how to behave.

79
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:25,877
I told them not to call those Hungarians
'Hungarian'! Why should one provoke people?

80
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,476
- Tell them to have the horses ready.
- Yes sir.

81
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:41,686
The thought that you would be at the
mercy of that Hungarian colonel...

82
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:45,476
That dreadful man strutting into this
castle and ordering you around.

83
00:06:46,087 --> 00:06:49,602
No! No, no. No no no no.

84
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:50,717
No!

85
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:54,126
I'm not going.
I'll stay here and protect you.

86
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:56,240
They will take you prisoner.

87
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:57,442
I'll disguise myself.

88
00:06:57,567 --> 00:07:00,479
I'll hide you, darling.
I'll do everything in my power.

89
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,086
Of course if they catch me
they will shoot me.

90
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:02,997
Shoot you!?

91
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:05,357
Ha! Let them shoot me, I'm not afraid,
I'm a good target.

92
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:08,519
Mario, do whatever you think is best
and forget about me.

93
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:12,725
You don't want me to stay do you?

94
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:15,925
I'd love you to stay. It would only
be too wonderful if you could.

95
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:18,475
Of course I realise that I have
to go, and immediately.

96
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,083
What a wedding night.
What an unfortunate wedding night.

97
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:23,083
But you'll come back.

98
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:26,404
And then it will be at the head of your
troops, taking the castle by storm.

99
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:28,916
Yes, you'll come back,
not only as a Bergamo,

100
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:30,918
but as the conqueror of Bergamo!

101
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:33,317
And I'll be in the entrance hall,
waiting for you.

102
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:35,444
Your prized captive.

103
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:08,446
The threat on the castle of Bergamo,
was also heard in the ancestor's gallery.

104
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:44,077
What a crisis.

105
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:45,156
What a crisis!

106
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:46,680
It calls for clever devices.

107
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:47,843
It calls for strategy.

108
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,679
- Calls for trickery!
- Calls for cruelty!

109
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:50,677
Yes, brutality.

110
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:52,962
- It calls for a woman!
- Francesca!

111
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:58,966
- Francesca!
- Francesca!

112
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:01,601
Francesca! Where is she?
Where is she? Where is she?

113
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:02,677
Somebody find her.

114
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,359
- Somebody get her.
- Maybe she's here.

115
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:06,597
- Maybe she's there.
- Stop! Look.

116
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:07,723
A letter!

117
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:10,037
- A letter?
- What does it say? What does it say!?

118
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:11,680
Right away, don't delay.

119
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:12,637
What does it say!?

120
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:18,203
"We'll be back in an hour.
Have gone to the tower."

121
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:20,238
We can't wait an hour!
We can't wait an hour!

122
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:23,046
The tower, the tower!
Let's go to the tower, the tower!

123
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:28,161
Francesca, Francesca, at last!

124
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:31,767
Save the castle, as you did in the past.

125
00:09:32,727 --> 00:09:34,399
You heroes.

126
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,282
What do you see?

127
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:38,163
What do you see?

128
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:39,403
Nothing.

129
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:43,078
She sees nothing.
Simply nothing.

130
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,722
Wait, I see something.

131
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:48,442
Something!

132
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:50,677
And is he something.

133
00:09:51,527 --> 00:09:54,280
He looks like he'd stop at nothing.

134
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:57,998
She sees something,
that would stop at nothing!

135
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:00,359
- He is a captain!
- A captain!

136
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:02,165
- No, a colonel!
- A colonel!

137
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:05,159
And he is so young
to rank so high.

138
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:08,566
He must be a great fighter.

139
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:12,085
But so... am I!

140
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:19,117
Oh what I'll do
to that wild Hungarian.

141
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:26,037
Oh what I'll do
to that wild barbarian.

142
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:30,322
I'll handle, that vandal,
with weapons of my own.

143
00:10:30,447 --> 00:10:34,281
I'll haunt him, I'll taunt him,
and when I get him where I want him...

144
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:39,963
Oh what I'll do
to that wild Hungarian.

145
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:45,842
Oh what I'll do
to those eyes.

146
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,600
He'll get a little surprise!

147
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:49,365
I'll trip him, I'll trap him

148
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:51,165
I'll pinch him, I'll slap him!

149
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:54,045
I'll teach him
manoeuvres that are new!

150
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:57,037
So, let him come.

151
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:00,521
And I'll do what I'll do.

152
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:04,401
It's wonderful, it's glorious,
again she will be victorious!

153
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:07,160
- Bravo, Francesca.
- Bravo! Bravo!

154
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:12,887
Oh what she'll do
to that wild Hungarian.

155
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:19,677
Oh what she'll do
to that wild barbarian.

156
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:23,639
I'll let him have a rhapsody,
and not the one by Liszt!

157
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:25,320
She will use her fist!

158
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,478
I'll keep him jumping with my thumping.

159
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:33,283
Oh what she'll do
to that wild Hungarian.

160
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:38,399
And what I'll do, to that man

161
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:39,243
Hooray!

162
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:40,760
No other enemy can.

163
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:42,400
I'll rip off his medals.

164
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:44,085
She'll bite off his buttons.

165
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:47,079
This battle will be his Waterloo.

166
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,840
- So, let him come.
- Let him come!

167
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:52,565
- Let him come!
- Let him come!

168
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:54,285
- Let him come!
- Let him come!

169
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,645
- Yes, let him come!
- Let him come!

170
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:00,719
And do what she will do.

171
00:12:01,247 --> 00:12:02,521
What she will do.

172
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:03,921
What she will do.

173
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:05,675
What she will do.

174
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:07,396
What she will do.

175
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:09,275
What she will do.

176
00:12:13,127 --> 00:12:14,526
What I will do.

177
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:19,156
Attention!

178
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:28,647
May I report sir, all your
orders have been carried out.

179
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:11,562
That is the countess Francesca,
1537 to 1578.

180
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:14,682
I like her best of all the ancestors.

181
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,719
She even smiles at me.

182
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:21,526
Naturally I can't see it,
but one can feel when one is liked.

183
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:25,637
Horvath!

184
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:27,358
Yes sir.

185
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:30,081
I want you to make it clear to the men
that this is not a vacation from war.

186
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,158
- Yes sir!
- If I find the slightest...

187
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:36,522
... What is the matter with her!?
She has her coat on and her shoes off

188
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,405
This woman doesn't make sense.
- She certainly doesn't sir.

189
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,320
What woman does?

190
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:43,445
Do we want them to make sense?

191
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:46,964
Believe me, sir, there is a reason
for everything in that picture.

192
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:48,919
- Horvath!
- Yes sir.

193
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:52,005
If I find the slightest lack of discipline
I'll throw them out of their soft beds,

194
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:53,884
And they will sleep in the mud again.
- Yes sir.

195
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,206
- Horvath!
- Yes sir.

196
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:01,364
What are these women dressed up for?

197
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:04,607
To welcome you sir, that's the way
we do things in Bergamo.

198
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,041
- What is your name?
- Luigi sir.

199
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:06,684
Luigi?

200
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:09,520
Yes, I was born in this castle.
My father was born here too.

201
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:11,279
- And your grandfather too?
- Yes that's right.

202
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,925
- Watch him Horvath, keep your eye on him.
- Yes sir.

203
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:15,396
- Who is the master of this house?
- Angelina, countess of Bergamo.

204
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,761
Where is she? Why isn't she here?

205
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:19,202
I think the countess probably didn't expect you...

206
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:20,800
- Be quiet.
- Thank you, sir.

207
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:23,117
I don't want this countess to throw
roses at my feet, but I

208
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:25,482
Want her to know there is somebody
new in command of this castle.

209
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:27,159
Bring her down immediately.
- Yes sir.

210
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:30,757
Now see here you charming
ladies of Bergamo.

211
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:32,963
I think we should have a heart
to heart talk.

212
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,841
I saw you looking at my hussars,
and I know what you're thinking,

213
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:39,161
But if I catch any of you with my men I...

214
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:41,720
Attention!

215
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:49,118
Now listen, you stupid sons of
the wind swept Hungarian steppes!

216
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:51,802
You are so stupid, that if you don't
watch out, these women will

217
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:54,396
steal your horses right out from
under your saddles!

218
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:57,326
Don't give them any information.
Dismissed.

219
00:14:58,287 --> 00:14:59,402
Dismissed!

220
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,802
- Good night.
- Good night.

221
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:10,837
Novak!

222
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:14,405
- Yes sir.
- Looks like we lost Horvath.

223
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,398
- Yes sir.
- I want them down here in one minute.

224
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:19,480
And I don't care if Horvath carries the
countess, or the countess carries Horvath.

225
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:20,044
Yes sir.

226
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,242
- And Novak...
- Yes sir?

227
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:23,363
- Don't forget to come back yourself.
- No, sir.

228
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:43,516
The composition isn't right.

229
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:46,285
But you play it beautifully sir.

230
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:47,403
No, no, no.

231
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:49,796
The composition of the painting.
The painting in the hall.

232
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:52,359
What was the painter thinking?

233
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:55,235
Why did he cover her shoulders
and reveal her feet?

234
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,125
It strikes me as very peculiar.

235
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:08,083
Where is she?

236
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:10,164
Well I spoke with her personal maid.

237
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:11,117
Where is she!?

238
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:14,438
Unfortunately, the countess had already
retired and did not wish to be disturbed.

239
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:17,445
I see that I'll have to handle this countess
myself, and I'm going to.

240
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:21,956
As for you, how dare you bring me
such a ridiculous message!

241
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:23,925
And not even from the countess herself!

242
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:26,078
You half-witted hussar!

243
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,325
You've been sitting on a horse so long that
even your brains have become bow-legged.

244
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,197
Yes sir.

245
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:32,002
I beg your pardon sir.

246
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:33,037
What do you want?

247
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:36,523
I'm sorry sir, but the countess has
asked me to explain to you

248
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,723
that there are strange echoes
in this castle

249
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:41,640
and by the time the echoes
have carried you to the second floor

250
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:44,958
your voice, which by itself
may not be offensive...

251
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:58,325
- She moved!
- Who moved?

252
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:02,002
The Lady in Ermine.
I saw it with my own eyes.

253
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:08,983
What is the matter with you?
Go back where you belong, go to bed.

254
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:10,406
Yes colonel.

255
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:20,563
Horvath!

256
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:23,364
Yes sir.

257
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:24,960
Everybody is crazy around here!

258
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:25,883
Yes sir.

259
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:26,957
That's all.

260
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:28,117
Thank you sir.

261
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:38,717
Horvath!

262
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:42,163
Yes sir.

263
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:43,482
Good night.

264
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:45,596
Night sir.

265
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:00,206
What I'll do.

266
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:05,675
Let's look at the horses.

267
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,520
Good morning, gentlemen.

268
00:20:26,887 --> 00:20:30,004
I see you're looking at my ancestor.
A very interesting woman.

269
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:32,925
Some people think we look alike.
Perhaps we do.

270
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,637
I'm so happy to meet you, colonel.

271
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:39,681
Oh I'm afraid there's a...
Well, may I introduce the colonel?

272
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:45,037
Oh, so you're the colonel.

273
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:46,925
How do you do?
- How do you do.

274
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:50,836
I'm sorry I was unable to greet you
last night, but your arrival was a bit late.

275
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:55,440
By the way, there is one person I
simply must meet: Horvath.

276
00:20:57,887 --> 00:20:59,979
- Horvath.
- Yes!

277
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:04,881
May I present Major Horvath.
The countess of Bergamo.

278
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:08,961
So you're Horvath. Major Horvath.
How do you do?

279
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:14,204
You seem to be quite popular.
Apparently very much in demand.

280
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:15,476
Isn't he, colonel?

281
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:18,878
Uh, countess there are several matters
I'd like to discuss as soon as possible

282
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:20,799
Well Tuesday is always such a busy day.

283
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:21,797
This is Wednesday.

284
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,559
Wednesday is even worse.

285
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:25,365
I'm sorry, I have to see you.

286
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:29,998
Well perhaps that can be arranged.
Let me think. I'll see you right now.

287
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:31,522
I'll join you later.

288
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:32,837
If you please.

289
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:39,643
Now countess...

290
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:41,046
Please sit down, colonel.

291
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:43,322
Countess unfortunately this is war.

292
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:46,520
Please colonel, there is nothing to be
embarassed about.

293
00:21:46,687 --> 00:21:49,440
I realise that you didn't come here
of your own volition [will]

294
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:52,764
You were just sent here by a higher authority
and there is nothing you can do about it

295
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:57,638
So please, no apologies colonel.
I want you to feel completely at ease.

296
00:21:57,807 --> 00:22:01,686
I've already told my people to make
everything as comfortable as possible.

297
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:03,883
And if you have any complaints, don't hesitate.

298
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:06,322
Just talk to Luigi, and I'm quite sure...

299
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:09,843
Countess, may I make a suggestion?
Why don't you keep quiet.

300
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:11,957
Thank you.

301
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:14,523
Well...

302
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:18,239
It may take me a little while to get
accustomed to the way

303
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:20,005
one talks to a prisoner of war.

304
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:22,442
Prisoner of war?
No, no, it has nothing to do with that.

305
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:25,485
That's just the way I talk to a woman
who talks too much.

306
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:27,886
Have you ever been slapped in the face?

307
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:31,323
Many times. And I take it very well.

308
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:34,841
Once in Madagascar, I asked for more.

309
00:22:36,407 --> 00:22:37,237
Sit down.

310
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,206
As I was trying to say, this is war. Grim war.

311
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:47,925
Men are shooting and other
men are shooting back.

312
00:22:48,007 --> 00:22:49,804
- Yes sir.
- Technically you are an enemy.

313
00:22:49,887 --> 00:22:51,445
I'll have to restrict your freedom of movement.

314
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:52,795
Thank you sir.
May I go now?

315
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:55,560
There are just a few more questions
I'd like to ask for security reasons.

316
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:57,400
You are the ruling countess.
- Yes sir.

317
00:22:57,487 --> 00:22:58,840
- Born here?
- Yes sir.

318
00:22:59,407 --> 00:23:00,760
By the way, are you married?

319
00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:03,004
Is this also for security reasons?

320
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:03,918
Might be.

321
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,406
I am married, I love my husband,

322
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:09,639
I'm a good wife and always will be.
I hope that makes you feel secure.

323
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:12,597
- How long have you been married?
- Since last night.

324
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:15,238
- Last night!?
- Yes last night.

325
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,200
- Well well well! Congratulations.
- Thank you.

326
00:23:18,327 --> 00:23:19,919
Where's the happy bridegroom?
I'd like to see him.

327
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,406
So would I. Very much.

328
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:26,841
This is not very easy to grasp, but
nevertheless I would like to grasp it.

329
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:29,202
When I stood in front of your door
last night, did he...

330
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:31,198
He had already gone back to his regiment.

331
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:34,480
Oh I'm so sorry.
Did I spoil your honeymoon?

332
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:37,479
- I'd rather not discuss it.
- Well I'm sure I didn't help it.

333
00:23:37,687 --> 00:23:39,405
Countess, if only I had known

334
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:42,320
I would have postponed this attack
a few days, or at least a few hours.

335
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,637
I hardly think there could be any
more questions colonel.

336
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:47,480
By the way, what made your husband leave?

337
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:50,287
- Not a fear of you.
- Oh no, I'm sure not.

338
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:53,201
When he made his decision,
I'm sure he was guided by

339
00:23:53,287 --> 00:23:56,324
a passionate love, for his country,
and nothing else.

340
00:23:56,967 --> 00:23:58,002
You're quite right.

341
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:00,956
And yet countess, sometimes,
love and war

342
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:03,322
go beautifully together,
very beautifully.

343
00:24:03,887 --> 00:24:06,082
I always thought it so romantic
that Napoleon wrote

344
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:08,317
his greatest love letters to Josephine
in the heat of battle.

345
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:12,196
"I love you, Josephine".
And the bullets flying around and around.

346
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:14,877
Yes, and when Marc Anthony learnt that
Caesar was approaching

347
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:17,322
did he free himself from the arms of Cleopatra?

348
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:21,566
He not only remained in the same palace,
he stayed in the same embrace.

349
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,718
Historically, you are speaking
complete nonsense.

350
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:26,002
- The fact remains that he ran away.
- He left.

351
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:29,966
Countess, people in love don't leave each
other just because a few shots are fired.

352
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:34,684
If two lovers are caught in the rain,
do they part just because of a few drops?

353
00:24:34,927 --> 00:24:37,521
If one is in love, one doesn't need an umbrella.

354
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:39,763
No, countess. No umbrella.

355
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:43,243
Why you impudent, conceited,
impertinent creature!

356
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:45,763
Why do I tolerate all this?

357
00:24:58,127 --> 00:25:03,042
I love your great-great grandmother.
I loved her from the moment I saw her.

358
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:05,922
What's that?

359
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:26,906
Just target practice.

360
00:25:27,127 --> 00:25:30,358
No one was shot.
No spy, no husband.

361
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:31,557
Thank you.

362
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:35,197
Countess, I don't know anything about
your husband.

363
00:25:36,087 --> 00:25:38,965
But when those shots were fired
and I saw that look on your face...

364
00:25:39,847 --> 00:25:41,675
Is he really that wonderful?

365
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,462
Yes, he is.

366
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:48,839
I can see him in front of me: Very strong,
very brave, very brilliant...

367
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:52,081
and very lucky.

368
00:25:53,647 --> 00:25:55,205
I congratulate you again.

369
00:25:58,207 --> 00:25:59,242
Countess...

370
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:05,037
If I had lived in your grandmother's day,
you think she would have dined with me?

371
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:09,984
She might have. She was rather daring.

372
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:15,996
Yes, she is wonderful, magnificent, inspiring!

373
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:19,327
I never thought a painting could make
such a deep impression on me.

374
00:26:19,607 --> 00:26:21,723
Yes, it's a very fine portrait.

375
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,126
Oh, it's much more.

376
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:26,581
You know countess,
sometimes I feel she smiles at me.

377
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:28,720
That she's taken a liking to me.

378
00:26:29,127 --> 00:26:32,085
But I don't imagine that's hereditary, is it?

379
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:34,876
I wouldn't know.

380
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:38,677
They say I inherited her looks,
and that's all.

381
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:43,245
Congratulations anyway.

382
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:53,882
More coffee, sir?

383
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:57,684
A fresh glass of wine?
- No.

384
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:00,001
Don't go, Luigi.

385
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:06,766
You seem sad, sir.
And I think I know the reason.

386
00:28:07,247 --> 00:28:10,557
I don't blame you. She's the loveliest
girl in the world.

387
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:14,045
Tell me about her Luigi.
Tell me everything.

388
00:28:14,807 --> 00:28:18,197
Well sir, she was born more
than 300 years ago.

389
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:21,963
It was on the 22nd of June that she
made her gallant decision.

390
00:28:22,527 --> 00:28:26,679
The castle was doomed, surrounded
by the troops of the duke of Ravena.

391
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:30,484
Just as you sir, are gentle and
kind at heart,

392
00:28:30,847 --> 00:28:32,963
he was severe and terrifying.

393
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:35,125
A brute, sir, a tyrant.

394
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:38,121
His own men trembled
at the sound of his voice.

395
00:28:38,807 --> 00:28:42,800
And he was even more dangerous in silence,
when he paced back and forth in his tent.

396
00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:54,082
Benvenuto!

397
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:58,082
Yes, your grace.

398
00:28:58,807 --> 00:28:59,956
I'm getting bored.

399
00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:00,758
Yes.

400
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:03,236
How long have I been looking
at that castle of Bergamo.

401
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:05,080
Almost three weeks, your grace.

402
00:29:05,207 --> 00:29:07,323
Spoiling my view.
I want it destroyed at dawn.

403
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:08,362
Yes, your grace.

404
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:13,726
I vowed to myself that everything would
be wiped out! Except that little dog.

405
00:29:13,927 --> 00:29:16,487
I know, your grace. The one that comes
out of the gate every evening.

406
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:18,036
I love that little dog.

407
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:19,242
Yes, your grace.

408
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:22,236
Why are my men laughing!?

409
00:29:22,447 --> 00:29:24,119
Did I say something amusing today?

410
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:25,197
No, your grace.

411
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:26,322
Then why do they laugh!?

412
00:29:38,127 --> 00:29:39,958
I offer my sword to my conqueror.

413
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:44,798
What I ask, your grace, is to spare
Bergamo and its people.

414
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:51,407
If this doesn't move you, take me.

415
00:29:51,887 --> 00:29:53,798
I offer myself for what I'm worth.

416
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:55,886
Let me be your slave.

417
00:29:56,287 --> 00:29:58,243
Let me be your court jester.

418
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:01,844
Permit me to make you laugh.
I can be very funny.

419
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:05,083
- Benvenuto!
- Yes, your grace.

420
00:30:05,727 --> 00:30:07,763
- Tell him to be funny.
- Yes, your grace.

421
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:11,562
Be funny.

422
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:17,006
Well I usually sing a song at the round table.

423
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:18,964
My knights think it's hilarious.

424
00:30:19,727 --> 00:30:22,605
Oh, the donkey kicked the king, ha ha...

425
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:24,598
the donkey kicked the king

426
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:27,357
I was there, and I know where

427
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:29,483
the donkey kicked the king.

428
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:31,320
Did he kick him in the palace?

429
00:30:31,407 --> 00:30:32,362
No, no, no.

430
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:34,802
Did he kick him in the garden?
No, no, no

431
00:30:34,887 --> 00:30:36,605
He kicked him, he kick...

432
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:40,556
This is where my knights always
scream with laughter.

433
00:30:40,647 --> 00:30:43,719
As a matter of fact, they laugh so much
that I never get any further...

434
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:49,483
Benvenuto!

435
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:50,676
Yes, your grace.

436
00:30:51,087 --> 00:30:52,964
After we have destroyed the castle

437
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:55,762
I want my portrait painted,
with me standing on its ruins.

438
00:30:56,327 --> 00:30:57,203
That's all.

439
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:00,522
Where did he kick him?

440
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:02,206
He kicked him in the courtyard.

441
00:31:03,887 --> 00:31:05,240
Get out of here!

442
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:23,481
Mt poor Francesca...
Francesca!

443
00:31:26,647 --> 00:31:27,716
Where are you going?

444
00:31:28,247 --> 00:31:30,442
I only want to try where you failed.

445
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:34,646
It's no use. He will only sneer at your
noble efforts as he sneered at mine.

446
00:31:34,847 --> 00:31:36,439
He's not our kind, Francesca.

447
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:40,645
I know it, Alberto, and yet where you
awaken the warrior in him

448
00:31:40,887 --> 00:31:43,799
I might be able to get under his armour,
and touch his heart.

449
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:47,000
Alberto, I don't want you to die,
I really don't.

450
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:48,925
You must live by all means.

451
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:51,118
You devoted good woman.

452
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:53,523
I know I shouldn't let you go, I...

453
00:31:53,927 --> 00:31:55,201
... Why the ermine coat?

454
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,563
To uphold the dignity of the Bergamo's.

455
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:00,444
I wish my father could have heard that.

456
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:03,565
You splendid woman. Splendid, splendid...

457
00:32:03,847 --> 00:32:04,404
But...

458
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:06,245
But Francesca, your feet are bare.

459
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:07,960
To show my humility.

460
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,965
You came with a sword.
I come with my feet.

461
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:12,556
It's a deep thought.

462
00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:15,043
It's deep, Francesca, very deep.

463
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:17,803
I shouldn't let you go.
I shouldn't.

464
00:32:17,927 --> 00:32:18,962
Goodbye, Alberto.

465
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:20,322
Goodbye, Francesca.

466
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:26,962
Benvenuto!

467
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:30,722
Benvenuto!

468
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:56,761
He's going to kill her.

469
00:33:56,847 --> 00:33:58,075
No, no, no, no.

470
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:01,204
No you don't know him,
and you don't know her.

471
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:05,606
If she talks to him the way she sometimes
talks to me, he's going to kill her.

472
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:15,243
Benvenuto...

473
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:19,836
Yes, your grace.

474
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:27,801
The seige is lifted.
The people of Bergamo are free.

475
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:32,483
Escort the countess back to the castle.

476
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:18,443
Yes...

477
00:35:18,767 --> 00:35:19,961
She killed him...

478
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:21,686
with his own dagger.

479
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:24,841
Killed the man who had fallen in
love with her.

480
00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:28,120
Some say she did it because he was
the enemy.

481
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:33,522
Some say she was afraid of herself,
for she too, was falling in love.

482
00:35:34,247 --> 00:35:37,762
Still, others claimed that she killed him
because she couldn't bare the thought

483
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,958
of any other woman putting
her arms around him.

484
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:42,163
But that's a lie, sir. A malicious lie.

485
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:44,164
Don't you believe it
- I won't, Luigi.

486
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:47,277
Don't worry, it's a beautiful legend.

487
00:35:47,447 --> 00:35:49,915
It's not a legend, sir, it's true.
Every word.

488
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,321
I'm sure it is, Luigi.

489
00:35:53,007 --> 00:35:54,645
What great days those were.

490
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:57,999
Filled with excitement, love, death...

491
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:02,640
Luigi, the duke was a very lucky man.

492
00:36:03,807 --> 00:36:05,445
At least he wasn't ignored.

493
00:36:07,287 --> 00:36:08,197
Good night, Luigi.

494
00:36:08,327 --> 00:36:09,282
Good night, sir.

495
00:36:41,647 --> 00:36:42,523
Mario!

496
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,436
My bride.

497
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:48,756
How did you get here?

498
00:36:48,887 --> 00:36:50,559
I couldn't stand it anymore.
I had to see you.

499
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:53,759
A gypsy caravan came along, and instantly
I realised that this was my chance.

500
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:56,276
So I went to the general, you know what he
thinks of me,

501
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:59,006
He gave me permission right away.
- I'm so glad the general did!

502
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:00,156
My bride!

503
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:06,003
Now, tell me everything, every detail,
everything about that colonel.

504
00:37:06,127 --> 00:37:09,483
Mario, I wish he would leave.
How I hate that man!

505
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:10,556
What has he done?

506
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:14,478
Well, nothing in particular.
Nothing I can put my finger on.

507
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:17,004
But his mere presence is unendurable.

508
00:37:17,087 --> 00:37:18,645
Well what did he do?
What did he say?

509
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:21,520
He is the most irritating, annoying person.

510
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,763
You know I simply couldn't fall asleep tonight.

511
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:25,360
I'll settle with him someday.

512
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:27,364
Please, Mario, talk to the general again.

513
00:37:27,527 --> 00:37:30,644
Come back with your whole army,
and soon, Mario, soon!

514
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:33,037
Throw that man out of the castle, please.

515
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,520
I will Angelina.

516
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:57,963
I...

517
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:00,564
I just wanted to say goodnight.

518
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:03,401
Good night, coronel.

519
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:05,601
Good night, countess.

520
00:38:22,527 --> 00:38:23,357
Mario.

521
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:29,443
Who was it?

522
00:38:29,647 --> 00:38:30,921
Oh, the colonel.

523
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:33,238
The colonel? What did he want?

524
00:38:33,807 --> 00:38:35,206
Just to say goodnight.

525
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,326
Why should he say goodnight?

526
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:38,443
I don't know.

527
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:42,598
In the middle of the night, suddeny a man
knocks at the door and says goodnight...

528
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:44,606
What exactly did he say?

529
00:38:45,127 --> 00:38:46,162
"Good night".

530
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:48,122
I don't like it.

531
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:50,716
I don't like it.

532
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:53,998
No, I don't like it at all!

533
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:57,644
Please darling, you didn't come here
to argue, did you?

534
00:38:57,927 --> 00:39:01,237
- What made him come upstairs?
- He's probably going to bed.

535
00:39:01,727 --> 00:39:02,921
He's going to bed!?

536
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:06,643
Well yes, everybody goes to bed
sooner or later.

537
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:09,925
Don't tell me he sleeps in my room!

538
00:39:10,287 --> 00:39:11,686
Yes Mario, he does.

539
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:13,162
In my bed?

540
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:14,078
Yes.

541
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:15,837
In my...

542
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:17,522
How do you know?

543
00:39:17,727 --> 00:39:21,800
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't,
maybe he is sleeping on the floor.

544
00:39:22,047 --> 00:39:24,481
I'm gonna drag that Hungarian
out of my room!

545
00:39:24,607 --> 00:39:27,201
I'll break every bone in his body!

546
00:39:27,447 --> 00:39:29,802
I'm gonna kill him with my own two hands!

547
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:44,683
I beg your pardon countess,
we heard a man's voice in here.

548
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:46,075
You must be mistaken.

549
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:47,886
I'm sorry, countess.
Search the room.

550
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:48,837
Just a moment.

551
00:39:52,527 --> 00:39:53,482
What is it, lieutenant?

552
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:55,603
We distinctly heard a man's voice
in here, sir.

553
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:58,805
- Is there someone here?
- No.

554
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:00,800
- Was someone here?
- No.

555
00:40:00,927 --> 00:40:02,406
All three of us heard it, sir.

556
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:08,245
There are strange echoes in this castle,
and it's easy to be mistaken.

557
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:12,158
Anyway I don't think we should question
the countess' word, that's all.

558
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:18,039
I'm glad there was nobody here.

559
00:40:18,407 --> 00:40:20,921
And I take it for granted that nobody will be.

560
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:22,163
Naturally.

561
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:26,318
- Good night, countess.
- Good night, colonel.

562
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:39,077
Mario.

563
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:52,837
It is the east, and Juliet is the Sun.

564
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:56,285
Arise, fair Sun, and kill the envious Moon

565
00:40:56,727 --> 00:41:01,926
who is already sick and pale with grief
that thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.

566
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:06,358
Tis my lady, oh, tis my love!

567
00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:09,163
I thought I'd forgotten what Shakespeare I knew.

568
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:11,524
I wonder what could have brought it back.

569
00:41:12,087 --> 00:41:15,397
Italy? This night in june? The balcony?

570
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,479
Or perhaps you, countess.

571
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:21,484
I'm afraid I'm no Juliet.

572
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:25,835
One has to be very very young,
to be so foolish.

573
00:41:26,127 --> 00:41:28,800
I might not be young enough to be foolish,
but I'm foolish enough.

574
00:41:29,127 --> 00:41:31,163
And I'm certainly not too old to climb a balcony.

575
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:33,641
Not this one, colonel.

576
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:38,444
If you're in a climbing mood, may I recommend
that very steep mountain to the left?

577
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:41,280
It's been climbed before.
I mean your balcony.

578
00:41:42,407 --> 00:41:45,319
And by someone who has no respect
for your beautiful roses.

579
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:48,516
Good night, countess.

580
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:50,797
Good night, colonel.

581
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:39,121
If you should hear, a magic flute,
and someday dear, you might...

582
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:43,757
Just remember this.
You must remember this.

583
00:42:44,127 --> 00:42:46,960
The melody has to be right.

584
00:42:48,087 --> 00:42:51,921
If someone cute, should play that flute,

585
00:42:52,047 --> 00:42:54,720
the touch may be too light.

586
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:59,363
Just remember that.
You must remember that.

587
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:02,566
The melody has to be right.

588
00:43:03,407 --> 00:43:07,082
So wait, for a great persuader...

589
00:43:07,247 --> 00:43:11,081
who isn't only a serenader.

590
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:15,042
He'll play something gay and lilting [lively].

591
00:43:15,207 --> 00:43:19,803
And you positively will start wilting [melting].

592
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:24,156
He might be tall, he might be small.

593
00:43:24,447 --> 00:43:27,200
Forget about his height.

594
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:32,799
If you get a kiss, and want another kiss,

595
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:37,123
then the melody is right.

596
00:43:38,447 --> 00:43:41,644
The tune should be entertaining

597
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:45,846
if there is a snowstorm, or if it's raining.

598
00:43:46,087 --> 00:43:49,636
If you like the music faster,

599
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:53,806
you'll discover he's a music master.

600
00:43:54,367 --> 00:44:01,079
He might be shy, and only sigh.
But when he holds you tight...

601
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:07,481
Only say "I do", if he convinces you...

602
00:44:08,207 --> 00:44:11,483
that the melody is right.

603
00:44:11,727 --> 00:44:12,796
Good night.

604
00:44:17,247 --> 00:44:18,316
Gypsy, eh?

605
00:44:21,607 --> 00:44:23,404
Got separated from your caravan.

606
00:44:25,687 --> 00:44:26,881
Sounds very plausible.

607
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:34,362
So you're a gypsy.
- Yes, my colonel.

608
00:44:34,447 --> 00:44:36,324
- Where were you born?
- In wagon.

609
00:44:36,567 --> 00:44:38,080
Naturally, you don't know which country.

610
00:44:38,247 --> 00:44:39,077
No, don't know.

611
00:44:39,207 --> 00:44:42,802
Of course, gypsies are always travelling,
from there to here, from here to there.

612
00:44:43,287 --> 00:44:45,118
"All world home of gypsy".

613
00:44:45,327 --> 00:44:46,806
Yes, my colonel.

614
00:44:48,327 --> 00:44:50,921
Now tell me, my wonderful gypsy,
are you married?

615
00:44:51,007 --> 00:44:52,201
Yes, to wife.

616
00:44:53,087 --> 00:44:53,883
Where is wife?

617
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:55,036
Wife in wagon.

618
00:44:55,247 --> 00:44:56,600
In wagon with other gypsies?

619
00:44:56,687 --> 00:44:58,086
Yes, everything in wagon.

620
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,125
- Quite a wagon.
- Yes.

621
00:45:04,807 --> 00:45:05,683
Play it, gypsy.

622
00:45:07,127 --> 00:45:09,083
Not have violin for long time.

623
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:10,676
Hand little stiff?

624
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:12,241
Hand very stiff.

625
00:45:13,047 --> 00:45:15,117
But gypsies can always play,
stiff or not stiff.

626
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:16,356
Yes, my colonel.

627
00:45:18,727 --> 00:45:20,160
I didn't ask you to sing, my friend.

628
00:45:20,247 --> 00:45:21,396
No, no, my colonel.

629
00:45:22,527 --> 00:45:24,279
Just play a few notes.

630
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,037
Wonderful.

631
00:46:42,407 --> 00:46:43,396
Wonderful.

632
00:46:44,647 --> 00:46:48,037
Wonderful!
You really are a gypsy.

633
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:49,760
Did my colonel doubt?

634
00:46:49,847 --> 00:46:51,565
Forgive me, my friend. I'm sorry.

635
00:46:55,327 --> 00:46:56,840
Thank you, thank you, my colonel.

636
00:46:56,927 --> 00:46:58,918
You know, I haven't seen a gypsy
since I left Budapest.

637
00:46:59,007 --> 00:47:00,281
You make me so homesick.

638
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:02,762
What is life without a gypsy?
You must stay with me.

639
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:04,798
But, colonel, I must look for wagon.

640
00:47:04,887 --> 00:47:05,842
You stay with me!

641
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:07,396
Yes, my colonel.

642
00:47:10,087 --> 00:47:11,759
Thank you, thank you, my colonel.

643
00:47:12,927 --> 00:47:13,723
Thank you.

644
00:47:14,647 --> 00:47:16,797
From now on, you will be my personal gypsy.

645
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,283
When I'm sad, you will play
something gay [cheerful].

646
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:23,085
When I'm gay, you will play
something very, very sad.

647
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,282
And when I'm angry and I break
the violin over your head!...

648
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:27,563
Don't worry...

649
00:47:28,487 --> 00:47:29,602
You'll get a new violin.

650
00:47:29,887 --> 00:47:31,240
Thank you.

651
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:36,086
I heard the music. Someone told me
there was a gypsy.

652
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,756
Oh, please. Don't apologise.

653
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:40,759
Good morning.
- Good morning.

654
00:47:41,447 --> 00:47:44,200
You looked so lovely in the moonlight
last night. I hated to leave.

655
00:47:44,767 --> 00:47:45,404
Get out, gypsy.

656
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:47,757
Would colonel like me to play
other gypsy songs?

657
00:47:47,847 --> 00:47:50,520
- Not now. Get out.
- Maybe colonel would...

658
00:47:50,607 --> 00:47:52,359
like me to tell fortune.
- Out!

659
00:47:59,447 --> 00:48:00,516
Please sit down, countess.

660
00:48:01,567 --> 00:48:02,716
I want to tell you something.

661
00:48:03,807 --> 00:48:06,162
Something that is so easy to say
if one doesn't mean it.

662
00:48:06,447 --> 00:48:09,280
And by not saying it, you make it
unnecessary for me to protest. Thank you.

663
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,523
But, countess I...

664
00:48:10,607 --> 00:48:13,201
You forget I'm the enemy.
And even worse, a married enemy.

665
00:48:13,287 --> 00:48:15,482
Countess, I believe in marriage,
I believe in married men,

666
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:16,920
and just as much in married women.

667
00:48:17,007 --> 00:48:20,317
But I also believe in fate, and I'm
sure that you and I...

668
00:48:21,007 --> 00:48:23,567
That we, are two people destined by
mysterious fate

669
00:48:23,647 --> 00:48:25,956
to have dinner together tonight.
Shall we say 9 o'clock?

670
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:28,125
I'm sure it's written on our hands.

671
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:31,604
Colonel, it's definetely out of the question.
Tonight or any other night.

672
00:48:31,687 --> 00:48:33,564
Well let me call the gypsy and have him...

673
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:37,287
Yes, my colonel.
Your gypsy always near you.

674
00:48:37,407 --> 00:48:38,886
You have good ears, gypsy.

675
00:48:39,927 --> 00:48:41,326
Anyhow, come here, my friend.

676
00:48:41,927 --> 00:48:44,805
If you see anything about this beautiful
lady in my hand, don't be afraid.

677
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:45,717
Speak up.

678
00:48:46,247 --> 00:48:47,646
Gypsy won't be afraid.

679
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:48,444
Good.

680
00:48:50,087 --> 00:48:53,443
Oh, colonel fine man.
Very kind heart.

681
00:48:55,527 --> 00:48:58,519
I see colonel winning battle.
And another battle...

682
00:48:58,887 --> 00:49:01,355
See many more battles
and colonel always winning.

683
00:49:01,527 --> 00:49:03,006
Come on, read the civilian part
of my life.

684
00:49:03,127 --> 00:49:03,957
Oh, yes.

685
00:49:04,887 --> 00:49:08,323
Here private line.
Very private.

686
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:11,762
But oh, it's not good.
It's very bad.

687
00:49:11,927 --> 00:49:13,804
- Bad, eh?
- Here is dangerous line.

688
00:49:14,007 --> 00:49:15,838
Saying colonel should leave castle soon.

689
00:49:16,007 --> 00:49:19,682
And here is very little line saying
much sooner.

690
00:49:19,967 --> 00:49:21,286
I'm sorry, colonel.

691
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:23,837
That's alright, gypsy.
You're honest and I'm grateful.

692
00:49:24,807 --> 00:49:25,717
Thank you, my colonel.

693
00:49:25,807 --> 00:49:28,162
Now just one little look at the
ladies hand.

694
00:49:28,887 --> 00:49:29,876
Please, I'd rather not.

695
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,084
Now countess, I really think you
can trust this gypsy.

696
00:49:33,247 --> 00:49:33,963
Oh yes, yes.

697
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:37,238
I see man in ladies hand.

698
00:49:37,327 --> 00:49:38,999
- Really?
- But not colonel.

699
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:41,836
Please go on.

700
00:49:42,367 --> 00:49:46,963
I see husband. Very nice husband.
Wonderful husband.

701
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:49,478
Husband love lady,
lady love husband.

702
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:51,598
And here I see colonel winning
another big battle.

703
00:49:51,687 --> 00:49:53,723
Congratulations colonel!
- Thank you, my gypsy.

704
00:49:54,287 --> 00:49:56,357
- Thank you, my colonel.
- Guard!

705
00:49:59,007 --> 00:50:01,123
- Yes, sir.
- Take good care of our friend here.

706
00:50:01,687 --> 00:50:03,598
Give him a good meal, anything he wants.

707
00:50:03,927 --> 00:50:06,316
And keep your eye on him:
I don't want to lose him.

708
00:50:06,407 --> 00:50:08,398
Thank you, my colonel, thank you.

709
00:50:12,167 --> 00:50:14,635
Well countess, our lifelines seem
to go in different directions.

710
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:16,001
I'm afraid they do.

711
00:50:16,087 --> 00:50:18,760
And yet, we are going to have dinner together.

712
00:50:19,607 --> 00:50:22,280
You know, this situation reminds me of 1561.

713
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:24,923
- I don't understand.
- Oh yes you do.

714
00:50:25,327 --> 00:50:27,443
There was a moment when I was
completely fooled...

715
00:50:27,887 --> 00:50:30,640
but when this gypsy became ecstatic
about your husband,

716
00:50:31,327 --> 00:50:32,885
something in me rebelled.

717
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:37,077
Something in my pocket that I picked
up under your balcony last night...

718
00:50:39,247 --> 00:50:40,236
Here, countess.

719
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:55,158
If he weren't your husband, what duets
we could've played together. It's too bad.

720
00:50:55,247 --> 00:50:56,521
You've got to save him.

721
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:58,917
You're right. We simply must
save him, you and I.

722
00:50:59,487 --> 00:51:02,445
It's true, neither of us love him, but
we can't have him shot can we?

723
00:51:02,607 --> 00:51:05,440
Colonel, there must be a way.
Let him escape.

724
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:08,365
To let a disguised officer escape, I'd be shot.

725
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:12,443
You're going to lose one of us. Make up your mind.
Which one will you miss more?

726
00:51:14,407 --> 00:51:17,285
Shall I die for you?
Now there's a tempting idea...

727
00:51:17,767 --> 00:51:19,598
Your horrible.
Just horrible.

728
00:51:19,687 --> 00:51:21,166
I'm a beast and you know it.

729
00:51:21,327 --> 00:51:23,238
Listen, tonight my tent will be right here...

730
00:51:23,367 --> 00:51:25,005
Take off your shoes.
Put on an ermine coat.

731
00:51:25,087 --> 00:51:26,725
It's 1561 again.

732
00:51:28,247 --> 00:51:30,442
Alright, wear your shoes.
But you must come.

733
00:51:30,607 --> 00:51:32,120
Make history repeat itself.

734
00:51:32,327 --> 00:51:34,761
There will be a buffet with every
delicacy you can think of.

735
00:51:35,247 --> 00:51:38,239
And in the middle of the table,
a long sharp knife.

736
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:43,797
If you want to kill me before dinner,
or after dinner, it's entirely upto you.

737
00:51:46,207 --> 00:51:48,675
If I come, my husband will be free?

738
00:51:49,007 --> 00:51:52,317
If I should survive the dessert,
I'll take you to that window

739
00:51:52,407 --> 00:51:57,083
and you and I will watch your husband
climb that very steep mountain to the left.

740
00:51:57,527 --> 00:51:58,642
My word of honour.

741
00:51:59,087 --> 00:52:02,204
What can I do? I'm defeated.
I have to help my husband.

742
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:03,686
I'm at your mercy.

743
00:52:04,447 --> 00:52:08,486
Colonel, you've won another battle.
Congratulations.

744
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:30,962
What time is it, Luigi?

745
00:52:31,087 --> 00:52:34,397
Just a little bit later, sir.
Not very much.

746
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:38,686
She won't come, Luigi.

747
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,005
If you knew where she is,
would you tell me?

748
00:52:47,127 --> 00:52:48,003
No, sir.

749
00:52:57,367 --> 00:52:58,402
Do you know where she is?

750
00:52:58,487 --> 00:52:59,363
No, sir.

751
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:13,357
Any better?

752
00:53:14,007 --> 00:53:14,757
Worse.

753
00:53:19,887 --> 00:53:21,036
Go to bed, Luigi.

754
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:22,283
Thank you, sir.

755
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,839
Wouldn't you rather go upstairs, sir.

756
00:53:26,127 --> 00:53:26,957
I can't.

757
00:53:27,887 --> 00:53:31,436
I'm expecting someone who is just
a little late, that's all.

758
00:53:32,567 --> 00:53:33,477
Good night.

759
00:53:33,767 --> 00:53:34,722
Good night, sir.

760
00:54:14,367 --> 00:54:16,198
Don't look so unhappy, colonel.

761
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:18,564
It's time you had a little dream.

762
00:54:18,887 --> 00:54:20,923
It would make you feel so much better.

763
00:54:21,687 --> 00:54:27,045
Yes colonel, dream. You will have you're
evening. I'll give it to you.

764
00:54:27,607 --> 00:54:31,680
It'll be 9 o'clock all over again,
and I wil be Angelina.

765
00:54:32,087 --> 00:54:35,796
I will wear her prettiest dress,
and her prettiest smile.

766
00:55:47,087 --> 00:55:51,046
This is the moment,

767
00:55:51,967 --> 00:55:56,324
this is the time.

768
00:55:56,647 --> 00:56:00,037
Why don't we take it

769
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:06,160
and make it sublime.

770
00:56:06,647 --> 00:56:12,404
On this grand night,
we could whisper in the shadows

771
00:56:12,767 --> 00:56:15,804
until dawn,

772
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:24,762
As skies grow bright, I'll be sorry
that the shadows, are gone.

773
00:56:25,247 --> 00:56:28,319
This is the moment.

774
00:56:29,847 --> 00:56:33,965
Love has begun.

775
00:56:34,687 --> 00:56:37,724
Maybe there is danger,

776
00:56:39,207 --> 00:56:42,483
but that might be fun.

777
00:56:45,087 --> 00:56:51,117
I used to say, if the right one
came my way,

778
00:56:51,487 --> 00:56:55,958
I would know it, in a moment.

779
00:56:56,807 --> 00:57:00,686
This is the moment.

780
00:57:01,887 --> 00:57:06,199
You are the one.

781
00:57:16,007 --> 00:57:17,565
I must tell you, countess, that I...

782
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,677
Angelina.

783
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,321
Angelina!

784
00:57:22,287 --> 00:57:25,836
Do you realise it's four minutes after nine
and you haven't kissed me yet?

785
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:28,646
Angelina!

786
00:57:29,287 --> 00:57:30,242
Kiss me!

787
00:57:49,367 --> 00:57:52,882
Tell me, before you became a colonel,
were you by any chance a shepherd?

788
00:57:53,287 --> 00:57:57,166
Shepherd? I don't remember.
I can't remember anything.

789
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,162
Angelina, there are so many things
I have to tell you.

790
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:02,442
But time is so precious,
why waste it on words?

791
00:58:02,527 --> 00:58:03,164
Angelina...

792
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:05,681
Chatter, chatter, chatter,
nothing but chatter.

793
00:58:10,127 --> 00:58:11,958
I want you to know that I'm going
to keep my promise.

794
00:58:12,207 --> 00:58:15,040
Your husband will not be shot.
Nothing will happen to him.

795
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,123
Who cares? It doesn't matter.

796
00:58:17,367 --> 00:58:19,756
He's just a boy I met when I was
nine years old.

797
00:58:20,047 --> 00:58:22,197
I don't care whether he gets shot,
or you get shot,

798
00:58:22,287 --> 00:58:25,165
or I get slightly wounded. What's
the difference? I want champagne.

799
00:58:25,327 --> 00:58:26,282
Yes, countess.

800
00:58:28,007 --> 00:58:29,679
And you better see to it that it bubbles.

801
00:58:29,767 --> 00:58:30,677
Yes, countess.

802
00:58:35,287 --> 00:58:36,845
Would you mind if I propose a toast?

803
00:58:37,007 --> 00:58:39,077
Let's drink to what's going to happen next.

804
00:59:17,407 --> 00:59:18,237
Kiss me!

805
00:59:29,727 --> 00:59:32,639
I loved you from the moment I saw you
riding to the castle.

806
00:59:33,087 --> 00:59:35,203
I was mad about you
even before I saw you.

807
00:59:35,607 --> 00:59:37,882
When I walked into the hall,
and took one look at that painting.

808
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,277
The Lady in Ermine?
She was a fool.

809
00:59:40,527 --> 00:59:43,564
She killed him and for 300 years
she wish she hadn't.

810
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:47,835
But Angelina won't make that mistake.
You're going to live.

811
00:59:48,487 --> 00:59:51,206
Oh yes, indeed, you're going to be alive.

812
00:59:51,567 --> 00:59:52,363
Horvath!

813
00:59:52,567 --> 00:59:53,477
Yes, countess.

814
00:59:55,487 --> 00:59:56,806
Isn't this wonderful.

815
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:58,236
Yes, countess.

816
01:00:00,047 --> 01:00:01,082
That is all, Horvath.

817
01:00:01,207 --> 01:00:02,003
Thank you, countess.

818
01:00:07,727 --> 01:00:12,357
Oh what she'll do
to that young Hungarian.

819
01:00:14,647 --> 01:00:19,163
Oh what she'll do
to that poor barbarian.

820
01:00:20,167 --> 01:00:21,839
She'll taze him.
Amaze him.

821
01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:23,446
She'll drive him simply mad.

822
01:00:23,687 --> 01:00:25,279
Salom was milder.

823
01:00:25,367 --> 01:00:27,801
He may be wild, but he'll be wilder.

824
01:00:55,207 --> 01:00:56,662
Dance with me.

825
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:58,286
But I don't dance. I can't.

826
01:00:58,527 --> 01:01:00,882
With me you can do anything.
Dance!

827
01:01:12,247 --> 01:01:16,918
I can't believe it! I'm dancing!
I'm dancing beautifully!

828
01:01:17,527 --> 01:01:19,085
I'm the best dancer in the world!

829
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,400
Why shouldn't you be?

830
01:02:45,487 --> 01:02:48,126
Angelina, something's happening to me!

831
01:02:48,327 --> 01:02:49,806
This is nothing. Just the beginning.

832
01:02:49,887 --> 01:02:51,320
But I want to shout and sing!

833
01:02:51,407 --> 01:02:53,682
- Alright, then sing.
- Oh but I can't. I never could.

834
01:02:53,807 --> 01:02:55,399
With me you can.
Sing!

835
01:03:18,967 --> 01:03:22,164
I'm singing!
I'm singing magnificently!

836
01:03:22,407 --> 01:03:23,886
With me, anything.

837
01:03:25,687 --> 01:03:28,724
This is the moment,

838
01:03:29,487 --> 01:03:32,160
this is the time.

839
01:03:33,207 --> 01:03:36,085
Why don't we take it

840
01:03:36,887 --> 01:03:39,685
and make it sublime!

841
01:03:42,207 --> 01:03:49,363
On this grand night we could
whisper in the shadows

842
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:51,723
until dawn,

843
01:03:53,127 --> 01:04:01,239
as skies grow bright, I'll be sorry
that the shadows, are gone...

844
01:04:03,087 --> 01:04:05,920
This is the moment.

845
01:04:06,727 --> 01:04:09,719
Love has begun.

846
01:04:10,567 --> 01:04:13,445
Maybe there is danger,

847
01:04:14,087 --> 01:04:16,999
but that might be fun.

848
01:04:19,487 --> 01:04:22,524
At last you're here,

849
01:04:23,047 --> 01:04:26,676
and your lips are very near.

850
01:04:27,327 --> 01:04:32,959
And your eyes are full of kisses...

851
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:37,722
This is the moment.

852
01:04:41,447 --> 01:04:43,563
You are the one.

853
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,920
I could conquer the whole earth!

854
01:04:51,207 --> 01:04:54,677
I could be Alexander in the morning,
and Caesar in the afternoon!

855
01:04:55,127 --> 01:04:57,687
I could pick up the whole world with
one hand.

856
01:04:58,967 --> 01:05:01,686
I don't want it.
I'd rather have you.

857
01:05:02,087 --> 01:05:02,803
Thank you.

858
01:05:03,407 --> 01:05:04,157
Kiss me!

859
01:05:04,327 --> 01:05:05,157
Thank you!

860
01:06:01,807 --> 01:06:03,240
They went through the roof.

861
01:06:19,327 --> 01:06:20,965
- Good night.
- Good night.

862
01:06:51,927 --> 01:06:53,246
Well, good morning...

863
01:07:04,207 --> 01:07:06,496
What's the matter?
- We don't know...

864
01:07:21,887 --> 01:07:23,161
This is the moment.

865
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,523
Love has begun.

866
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:31,236
Maybe there's danger

867
01:07:32,807 --> 01:07:35,082
but that can be fun...

868
01:07:35,287 --> 01:07:37,642
I must have danced for miles.

869
01:07:41,087 --> 01:07:41,917
Horvath.

870
01:07:43,247 --> 01:07:43,918
Yes, sir.

871
01:07:45,207 --> 01:07:47,641
Have you ever danced on a table?

872
01:07:49,367 --> 01:07:50,197
No, sir.

873
01:07:53,607 --> 01:07:57,486
You don't know what life is until
you have danced on a table.

874
01:07:59,887 --> 01:08:00,717
Yes, sir.

875
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:06,883
Good morning.

876
01:08:06,967 --> 01:08:08,400
Good morning, sir.

877
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:11,038
Horvath! Good morning.

878
01:08:11,247 --> 01:08:12,623
Good morning sir.

879
01:08:12,967 --> 01:08:16,357
- Good old Horvath, how are you?
- Very well, sir.

880
01:08:16,687 --> 01:08:19,645
That little boy of yours, how is he?
Do you have a picture of him, Horvath?

881
01:08:20,047 --> 01:08:20,877
Yes, sir.

882
01:08:25,767 --> 01:08:27,786
Look at him, look at him!

883
01:08:28,087 --> 01:08:30,840
Isn't he quaint.
How many teeth does he got?

884
01:08:31,587 --> 01:08:32,308
Four, sir.

885
01:08:32,447 --> 01:08:34,961
Four! Four, oh isn't that wonderful.

886
01:08:36,287 --> 01:08:37,037
Yes, sir.

887
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:50,005
- Colonel.
- Good morning, darling.

888
01:08:50,807 --> 01:08:52,684
I'll get rid of them in just a second.

889
01:09:00,567 --> 01:09:03,639
Well gentlemen, I think we've covered
everything haven't we?

890
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:05,081
Except one matter, colonel.

891
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:09,919
Horvath, this is such a fine morning,
I can't imagine anything urgent...

892
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,883
Dismissed.

893
01:09:38,047 --> 01:09:39,275
Good morning, countess.

894
01:09:40,847 --> 01:09:42,121
Good morning, colonel.

895
01:09:43,207 --> 01:09:44,845
I've tried to reach the general all night.

896
01:09:45,567 --> 01:09:48,284
I wanted to beg for my husbands life
but I was detained by a patrol.

897
01:09:48,607 --> 01:09:50,723
Save him, colonel. I beg of you.

898
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:59,126
Horvath, will you come in for
a minute please.

899
01:09:59,307 --> 01:09:59,957
Yes sir.

900
01:10:00,047 --> 01:10:02,686
- About this gypsy...
- That's the subject I was trying to bring up

901
01:10:02,767 --> 01:10:04,141
I'm pretty certain he's an enemy officer.

902
01:10:04,257 --> 01:10:06,695
Enemy officer? Horvath let's not see a
spy in every corner.

903
01:10:06,787 --> 01:10:08,723
But sir, I have very strong evidence!

904
01:10:08,907 --> 01:10:10,684
- We're getting very suspicious these days.
- But sir...

905
01:10:10,867 --> 01:10:12,659
See that they give him a good breakfast
and let him go.

906
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:13,641
Those are my orders.

907
01:10:13,767 --> 01:10:14,563
Yes, sir.

908
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:19,277
Thank you.

909
01:10:20,887 --> 01:10:22,002
Thank you, countess.

910
01:10:25,647 --> 01:10:28,320
Tell me countess, do you dream?

911
01:10:30,327 --> 01:10:31,362
Occasionally.

912
01:10:32,607 --> 01:10:34,882
Countess, you missed a great
dream last night.

913
01:10:35,407 --> 01:10:38,246
Not just a dream that fades in the
sunlight and is forgotten.

914
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:39,841
No, this one will stay.

915
01:10:40,207 --> 01:10:43,579
Whether it makes me happy or mad,
it will never leave me.

916
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,162
When you didn't come last night,
everything looked hopeless

917
01:10:46,767 --> 01:10:49,076
but I didn't give up, and I was right.
I was rewarded.

918
01:10:49,367 --> 01:10:51,323
The clock struck nine all over again.

919
01:10:51,967 --> 01:10:55,084
Countess, you were so charming,
so gay...

920
01:10:55,807 --> 01:10:58,321
You were magnificent.
Inspiring.

921
01:10:59,447 --> 01:11:01,563
You were capricious and cruel,

922
01:11:02,447 --> 01:11:03,402
and loveable,

923
01:11:04,287 --> 01:11:05,561
like no other woman.

924
01:11:06,407 --> 01:11:09,126
You were everything, and you still are.

925
01:11:10,327 --> 01:11:11,965
Like no other woman.

926
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:14,166
And you don't know it.

927
01:11:17,047 --> 01:11:20,119
I don't want to.
So please don't tell me.

928
01:11:21,007 --> 01:11:22,076
Not even a word?

929
01:11:23,327 --> 01:11:24,362
Not a syllable.

930
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:32,997
Horvath.

931
01:11:34,367 --> 01:11:34,799
Yes sir.

932
01:11:34,887 --> 01:11:37,276
We are leaving this castle immediately.
I don't want a minute wasted.

933
01:11:37,367 --> 01:11:38,902
Very well sir.

934
01:11:45,287 --> 01:11:47,084
I will always love you, Angelina.

935
01:12:06,967 --> 01:12:07,877
Goodbye, countess.

936
01:12:09,527 --> 01:12:10,562
Goodbye, colonel.

937
01:12:53,407 --> 01:12:55,477
Cheer up darling, here I am.

938
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:01,675
Angelina, I'm back and alive!

939
01:13:03,647 --> 01:13:04,921
No handkerchief?

940
01:13:10,207 --> 01:13:12,163
Well we certainly got rid of him.

941
01:13:12,487 --> 01:13:16,196
How I fooled him!
Giving me money, the stupid idiot.

942
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:20,243
Look he's gone now,
why talk about him?

943
01:13:20,367 --> 01:13:21,925
Wouldn't it be better to forget?

944
01:13:22,127 --> 01:13:24,595
Forget? Why? I want to know everything.

945
01:13:24,687 --> 01:13:26,166
Everything that happened yesterday.

946
01:13:26,367 --> 01:13:27,163
Mario.

947
01:13:27,247 --> 01:13:29,283
Every bit of it. I insist.
I have a right.

948
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:32,003
Very well.

949
01:13:37,527 --> 01:13:40,719
He found your earring under the balcony.
He knew who you were.

950
01:13:40,827 --> 01:13:42,845
He...
Then...

951
01:13:43,327 --> 01:13:45,158
Then why did he let me go?

952
01:13:45,527 --> 01:13:48,519
Maybe he was gallant.
Maybe he was generous.

953
01:13:48,767 --> 01:13:50,399
Maybe I should be grateful to him.

954
01:13:50,527 --> 01:13:52,458
Maybe I should write him a
letter of thanks.

955
01:13:52,687 --> 01:13:53,802
Maybe you should.

956
01:13:54,447 --> 01:13:56,139
Did you have anything to do with my fortune?

957
01:13:56,227 --> 01:13:57,321
In a way, yes.

958
01:13:59,567 --> 01:14:02,361
- Exactly what did you do?
- Nothing.

959
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,399
- What did he do?
- Nothing.

960
01:14:05,767 --> 01:14:07,925
Let me recapitulate [recap].

961
01:14:08,247 --> 01:14:12,445
I'm still alive, and yet you did
nothing, and he did nothing.

962
01:14:13,247 --> 01:14:15,124
Angelina, why am I alive!?

963
01:14:15,647 --> 01:14:17,683
You see, the colonel had a dream.

964
01:14:17,807 --> 01:14:21,356
A dream?
What could he have dreamed about me?

965
01:14:21,887 --> 01:14:24,560
No, Mario, it wasn't you he dreamed of.

966
01:14:27,447 --> 01:14:28,477
Look at me.

967
01:14:28,807 --> 01:14:29,956
Angelina, look at me!

968
01:14:30,087 --> 01:14:31,415
I am looking at you.

969
01:14:31,527 --> 01:14:34,202
Exactly what kind of a dream was this?

970
01:14:34,807 --> 01:14:39,942
He dreamed that I was magnificent,
wonderful, inspiring...

971
01:14:40,607 --> 01:14:42,604
Like no other woman.

972
01:14:46,087 --> 01:14:47,440
Where did all this happen?

973
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:49,205
- In the living room.
- When?

974
01:14:49,607 --> 01:14:51,956
I entered his dream at exactly
9 o'clock last night.

975
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:54,317
- When did you leave?
- I don't know.

976
01:14:55,247 --> 01:14:57,681
It seems that time had stopped.

977
01:14:58,567 --> 01:15:00,000
Let me recapitulate...

978
01:15:00,607 --> 01:15:04,998
A Hungarian, has a dream,
in my living room...

979
01:15:07,207 --> 01:15:08,435
What's the matter Teresa?

980
01:15:08,567 --> 01:15:10,797
The Lady in Ermine.
She was smiling!

981
01:15:10,967 --> 01:15:12,559
In the morning? Now Teresa...

982
01:15:12,647 --> 01:15:15,056
She was almost laughing!
She seemed to be so happy.

983
01:15:15,247 --> 01:15:17,163
Calm down. Calm down.

984
01:15:17,367 --> 01:15:19,961
We're all happy. Especially this morning.

985
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:24,176
Did you realise, my child, that history
has repeated itself?

986
01:15:24,317 --> 01:15:28,445
That the castle has been saved again,
just as in 1561?

987
01:15:28,647 --> 01:15:33,323
Only this time, our mistress didn't
have to kill that very nice colonel.

988
01:15:33,647 --> 01:15:36,741
I'm glad she didn't.
Now go back to work.

989
01:15:37,607 --> 01:15:40,367
Yes, history has repeated itself.

990
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,837
Yes it has.

991
01:15:42,967 --> 01:15:45,959
You see Mario, the truth can
sometimes be so simple

992
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:48,845
that one has to have imagination
to appreciate it.

993
01:15:48,927 --> 01:15:50,201
When you were pleading for my life...

994
01:15:50,287 --> 01:15:53,484
I never forgot, not even for a moment,
that I was married.

995
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,638
I was taught to believe in marriage.

996
01:15:55,847 --> 01:15:57,505
And I still believe in it.

997
01:15:57,707 --> 01:16:00,758
A Hungarian saving my life
in my own living room!

998
01:16:00,967 --> 01:16:03,242
No! No! No!

999
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:19,962
Your move, sir.

1000
01:16:20,087 --> 01:16:22,806
I know it.
Give me time to think, that's not fair.

1001
01:16:22,887 --> 01:16:24,115
I'm sorry, sir.

1002
01:16:26,767 --> 01:16:28,864
- How is your family?
- Fine sir.

1003
01:16:34,007 --> 01:16:35,217
Your little boy.

1004
01:16:37,407 --> 01:16:38,476
What happened to it?

1005
01:16:41,967 --> 01:16:43,719
He got smaller.
He's tiny.

1006
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:45,638
That's a different one.
A new one.

1007
01:16:45,847 --> 01:16:47,200
He's six months old, sir.

1008
01:16:48,887 --> 01:16:51,242
- You must be a happy man.
- I am sir.

1009
01:16:55,207 --> 01:16:57,004
- Whose move is it?
- Yours.

1010
01:17:03,647 --> 01:17:05,285
- You did that on purpose.
- I beg your pardon...

1011
01:17:05,367 --> 01:17:07,676
You know you're a better player than I
and you haven't won a game.

1012
01:17:07,767 --> 01:17:09,485
Does it bore you to play with me?
- No, sir.

1013
01:17:09,607 --> 01:17:12,599
You're always trying to please me.
You're only telling me what I want to hear.

1014
01:17:12,887 --> 01:17:14,240
Would you like me to go, sir?

1015
01:17:16,367 --> 01:17:17,686
I'm sorry, Horvath.

1016
01:17:19,087 --> 01:17:21,726
I'm afraid I'm getting a little irritable.

1017
01:17:21,847 --> 01:17:22,986
I know, sir.

1018
01:17:24,447 --> 01:17:25,857
You know what?

1019
01:17:27,327 --> 01:17:29,783
Well you're not quite yourself, sir.

1020
01:17:30,247 --> 01:17:32,807
That's nonsense!
Never felt better in my life.

1021
01:17:33,087 --> 01:17:35,582
I don't want to hear such
ridiculous talk again.

1022
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,004
Horvath, what's wrong with me?

1023
01:17:39,127 --> 01:17:40,242
Well sir...

1024
01:17:41,047 --> 01:17:43,720
You used to say: "Another war, another love".

1025
01:17:44,847 --> 01:17:47,077
Now we're in another war, and you still...

1026
01:17:49,327 --> 01:17:51,045
Well, that's the trouble, sir...

1027
01:17:52,207 --> 01:17:55,605
I'm amazed.
How did you know that?

1028
01:17:56,447 --> 01:17:58,565
It's not very difficult, sir.

1029
01:17:59,247 --> 01:18:00,999
Has anyone else noticed?

1030
01:18:01,887 --> 01:18:02,922
Tell me the truth.

1031
01:18:03,847 --> 01:18:06,281
Everybody, down to the last soldier.

1032
01:18:07,887 --> 01:18:11,966
You used to scold them. You used to
call them every name under the sun.

1033
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:15,140
But underneath there was a great love
for them, and the men knew it.

1034
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:18,599
Remember how you used to shout
at me: "Horvath!".

1035
01:18:19,047 --> 01:18:20,700
And how I would jump.

1036
01:18:21,207 --> 01:18:22,681
I miss that, sir.

1037
01:18:23,367 --> 01:18:27,396
There are men who were born to shout,
and others who were born to jump.

1038
01:18:28,207 --> 01:18:29,899
I happen to be a jumper.

1039
01:18:30,167 --> 01:18:31,980
She was so lovely...

1040
01:18:33,327 --> 01:18:35,438
Horvath, she was so lovely...

1041
01:18:35,607 --> 01:18:38,958
Have you ever seen a more
lovely woman in your life?

1042
01:18:39,447 --> 01:18:43,235
Frankly sir, I think there is nobody
quite like my wife.

1043
01:18:47,407 --> 01:18:48,960
Yes, she is wonderful...

1044
01:18:49,327 --> 01:18:51,921
But after your wife, second to your wife...

1045
01:18:52,007 --> 01:18:53,076
Well, sir...

1046
01:18:53,447 --> 01:18:58,946
this might strike you like a bolt of lightning,
but if I hadn't been married to my Bertha...

1047
01:18:59,567 --> 01:19:03,196
you would've found in me a deadly rival.

1048
01:19:03,807 --> 01:19:05,923
And instead of playing checkers here tonight,

1049
01:19:06,167 --> 01:19:09,125
we probably would've been out in
the snow, dueling.

1050
01:19:10,407 --> 01:19:11,742
Yes, Horvath,

1051
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:14,956
she is worth risking ones life.

1052
01:19:16,367 --> 01:19:17,856
Angelina...

1053
01:19:19,447 --> 01:19:23,281
Shall we play another game?
I'll try my very best to win.

1054
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:24,956
Thank you, Horvath.

1055
01:19:25,607 --> 01:19:26,642
Not tonight.

1056
01:19:27,407 --> 01:19:30,385
And tomorrow I promise you
that everything will be different.

1057
01:19:30,567 --> 01:19:32,080
I'll tear into the men.

1058
01:19:32,207 --> 01:19:35,882
And you will jump as you've
never jumped before.

1059
01:19:36,527 --> 01:19:38,245
Good night, Horvath.
- Good night, sir.

1060
01:19:40,647 --> 01:19:41,477
Horvath!

1061
01:19:42,367 --> 01:19:43,197
Yes sir!

1062
01:19:44,967 --> 01:19:46,605
She was lovely, wasn't she?

1063
01:19:48,007 --> 01:19:49,360
Yes she was, sir.

1064
01:19:51,047 --> 01:19:51,957
Good night sir.

1065
01:24:12,687 --> 01:24:14,385
He didn't believe in dreams.

1066
01:24:14,497 --> 01:24:15,118
Who?

1067
01:24:15,287 --> 01:24:18,902
I'm a bad woman. The worst in
the world. That's what he said.

1068
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:19,758
Who!?

1069
01:24:20,087 --> 01:24:22,760
Remember: There was a gypsy
who turned out to be my husband.

1070
01:24:22,887 --> 01:24:26,163
Well he isn't my husband anymore.
He walked out of my castle and my life.

1071
01:24:26,247 --> 01:24:27,726
It's all over with.

1072
01:24:28,647 --> 01:24:29,966
Angelina!

1073
01:24:33,327 --> 01:24:34,476
Will you marry me?

1074
01:24:34,767 --> 01:24:36,439
I can't believe it yet. You're here...

1075
01:24:36,567 --> 01:24:40,003
You came out of nowhere, in the
middle of the night. Alone.

1076
01:24:40,127 --> 01:24:44,086
Yes, all alone. Just myself, my maid,
Luigi, and a priest.

1077
01:24:44,607 --> 01:24:46,279
- A priest?
- Yes, a priest.

1078
01:24:46,407 --> 01:24:49,285
Father! Father! Father!

1079
01:24:50,927 --> 01:24:52,883
This man wants to marry me.

1080
01:24:53,967 --> 01:24:55,161
Angelina!

1081
01:24:55,247 --> 01:24:56,236
Just a moment.

1082
01:24:56,487 --> 01:24:57,986
Colonel darling, what is your name?

1083
01:24:58,097 --> 01:24:59,619
Yes colonel, what is your name?

1084
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:02,161
Ladislaus Karoly Teglash.

1085
01:25:02,607 --> 01:25:08,743
Ladislaus Karoly Teglash.
How beautiful!

1086
01:25:12,687 --> 01:25:17,442
Oh what she'll do,
to that wild Hungarian.

1087
01:25:19,487 --> 01:25:24,197
Oh what she'll do,
to that wild barbarian.

1088
01:25:25,247 --> 01:25:27,715
Oh, what she'll do!
