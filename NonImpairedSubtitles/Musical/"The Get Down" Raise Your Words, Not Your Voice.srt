1
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,475
Yeah, rise and shine, Napoleon.

2
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,978
Boo, drop a record, loud!

3
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,148
You a gang dude, right?

4
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,275
So you know what an Apache line is.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,112
They beat you for a whole song
to jump you in. Right?

6
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,281
Then we handing you over to my man, Wolf.

7
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,284
Boo, drop that record,
come over here and smack his ass.

8
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,202
Get your ass up.

9
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,164
Come on.

10
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,041
Smack his ass.

11
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,752
Smack him, Boo. Come on.

12
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,920
You got it. Come on.

13
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,149
All right, all right. Stop.

14
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,776
Smack him, Boo. Come on. Come on.

15
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,028
- Not this song.
- I can't hit him like that.

16
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,364
- This song...
- Hey, look, this ain't right.

17
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,074
He loves this song.

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,743
What the fuck are you crying about?

19
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,871
Hey. Why you crying, motherfucker?

20
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,790
Please. No more.

21
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,083
We ain't even get started yet.

22
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,793
- I can't.
- You supposed to be hard.

23
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,045
Stop crying!

24
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,048
-Th-- They--
-They who?

25
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:34,261
I know stuff. I know it,
and that's why he killed my brothers.

26
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,972
Stop sniveling, motherfucker!
Pull yourself together.

27
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,225
Tell me, who the fuck is he,
and what the fuck do you know?

28
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,395
I know he... he set up Fat Annie.

29
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:47,024
He paid the Warlords to do it.
Please, I don't wanna die.

30
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,819
- I don't want him to kill me.
- Yo, who is he?

31
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:51,737
No, I don't know.

32
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,948
He smokes cigars
and he drives a Buick. Red.

33
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,243
And he always played this song.

34
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,581

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,584

72
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,048
<i>So, how is a disco hit made?</i>

73
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,051
<i>With its lavish productions</i>
<i>of strings and brass,</i>

74
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,971
<i>most picture a band of musicians</i>
<i>playing together in a studio.</i>

75
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,389
<i>Not so with disco.</i>

76
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,016
<i>Instead the producer, composer</i>
<i>and arranger</i>

77

<i>mix 24 individually recorded</i>
<i>vocal and instrumental tracks</i>

<i>to create the symphonic experience</i>
<i>that dancers know and love.</i>

79
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,901
<i>This multitracking technique is not new.</i>

80
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,697
<i>What's new is that almost all</i>
<i>dance records are now made this way.</i>

81
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,741
<i>- But that's only step number one.</i>

82
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:05,829
Step two, ladies, is getting
the big-time club DJs to spin the record.

83
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,914
-I'm so nervous.
-Don't be.

84
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,250
Look, number one,
your song's a guaranteed hit.

85
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,754
Number two, when it comes
to the business of doing business,

86
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,505
Jackie Moreno has no peer.

87
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,966
All right? I'm a hit maker,
that's what I do.

88
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,218
<i>♪ You're gonna be a star... ♪</i>

89
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,637
Is the record pool this way?

90
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,473
Love the shoes.

91
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,641
<i>When a disco producer finishes a track,</i>

92
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,394
<i>he'll invite prominent club DJs</i>
<i>to give input.</i>

93
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,189
<i>If a DJ likes a track,</i>
<i>he might play it in his club.</i>

94
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,484
<i>But remember,</i>
<i>the DJ's own reputation is at stake.</i>

95
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,653
<i>And believe me, the serious</i>
<i>hitmakers care about their rep.</i>

96
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,363
<i>But they don't got time to listen</i>

97
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,157
to every new disco track.

98
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,618
That's why Leslie started the record pool.

99
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,788
She listens and then once a week
the DJs gather at the pool,

100
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,957
they hear her crème de la crème,
'cause she's got the taste.

101
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,710
And these guys make the hits,
not the radio, not the record company.

102
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,130
<i>And one woman, Leslie Lesgold,</i>
<i>controls it all.</i>

103
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,343
-I appreciate you seeing me, Miss Lesgold.
-Jackie Moreno.

104
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,721
Mylene Cruz's record is dynamite.
Right?

105
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,056
Long time no see.

106
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,725
My apologies.
That's-- Have we met?

107
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,977
I sucked your dick
in the back of Maxwell's Plum.

108

Really?

109
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,898
Um... small world.

110
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,484
...two ships passing in the night?

111
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,362
-I was your intern at La Lupe Records.
-No.

112
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,072

Wow, hi.
Hey, what a happy coincidence.

117
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,333
Happy for me, not for you.

118
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,378
-May I just say--
-Go fuck yourself.

119
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,547

120
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,174

-Your youth notwithstanding,

you were unstable.

You were surly, you stole.

And without them and without me...

153
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,287
-your record goes nowhere.
-Nowhere.

154
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,542
So, how do you know Francisco?

155
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,752
His, um...

156
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,506
- His niece and I grew up together.
- Is she cute?

157
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,550
- Claudia.
- What? I'm just asking.

158
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,802
-What's her name?
-Mylene.

159
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,345
<i>Vous l'aimez, cette belle Mylene ?</i>

160
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,555
Don't feel compelled to answer, Ezekiel.

161
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,892
Claudia enjoys the, shock value
of her little quips.

162
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:56,977
You into punk?

163
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,814
-I'm not sure what that is, to be honest.
-You never heard of the Ramones?

164
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,399
You don't know "I Wanna Be Sedated"?

165
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,901
Try your vichyssoise.

166
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,028
It's divine.

167
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,363
It's pretentious.

168
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,281
- Claudia.
- Oops.

169
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,576
Okay, you got me. You win. Touché.

170
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,330
What do you want me to do?

171
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,835
I'm gonna exploit you...

172
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,129
like you exploited me.

173
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:28,174
I'm gonna abuse my power
like you abused yours.

174
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:32,762
And if you're compliant, then...
we'll see.

175
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,180
You up for this, Tiny?

176
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,724
Good, lock the door.

177
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,231
To estimate the intelligence of a leader,

178
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,484
look at the men he keeps around him.
You have to consider that.

179
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,069
In what sense, sir?

180
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,573
Are you a man willing to make
tough decisions to get what you want?

181
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,325
-I think so.
-Me, too.

182
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,248
You had the intestinal fortitude
to come to my office,

183
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,543
to tell me you weren't gonna kiss my ass
to earn your internship back.

184
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,923
That was a tough decision to make.
It got you here, in my home.

185
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,843
It got you what you wanted.

186
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:14,929
Thank you.

187
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,641
-You like my home?
-Yes, sir.

188
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,813
I'm thinking about putting a piano
in the front room.

189
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,776
What do you think?
Steinway, Bösendorfer, Mason & Hamlin?

190
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,652
Bechstein. Bechstein's the best.

191
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,655
-How do you know?
-My mother, she liked pianos.

192
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,034
But Bechsteins cost lots of money.
Thousands of dollars.

193
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,952
What if I told you I owned four of them?

194
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,581
Know what I did to get them?

195
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,627
Worked hard and pulled yourself up
by your bootstraps?

196
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:48,922
Not quite.

197
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,467
This morning, I voted to increase
the cost of a subway token.

198
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,429
And then I endorsed a plan
to close a hospital, near you.

199
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,432
And I blocked the teachers' union
from getting a raise.

200
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,268
And that was before lunch.

201
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,938
You see, leaders make sacrifices.

202
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,524
We are vigilant about the company we keep.

203
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,776
If someone holds us back,
we leave them behind.

204
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,613
-You make difficult decisions.
-Exactly.

205
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,282
Aw, shit. All right, Wolf,
who you take in a fight?

206
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,910
- Bruce Lee or Jim Brown?
- Shao, baby,

207
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,914
put on Wolf's favorite record.
It's time to share the big news.

208
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,126
Bruce Lee all day, man.

209
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,878
You seen<i> Fists of Fury?</i>
Mr. Lee is lethal as hell.

210
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,631
Motherfucker, come on.

211
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,341
Bruce Lee ain't shit.

212
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,803
Jim Brown could pulverize
his little narrow egg-roll ass.

213
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,221
He fast though.

214
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,267
He fast 'cause they speed up that camera
over there in Hong Kong.

215
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,602
They sneaky like that over there,
right, Slim?

216
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,646
That's my song. Yes, sir.

217
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,523
<i>♪ Ooh, like a river... ♪</i>

218
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,568
Y'all won't believe what
this little bad motherfucker did.

219
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,864
<i>-♪ Dragging me under ♪</i>
-What he did?

220
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,532
He found Napoleon.

221
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,536
And all your dirty little secrets
that came with him.

222
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,292
Annie...

223
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:12,005
whatever you heard, it ain't true.

224
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,882
<i>♪ You got the power ♪</i>

225
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,133
What I heard?

226
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,678
I heard it's a man who drives a red Buick.

227
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,556
And loves Cuban cigars.

228
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,682
Who loves this song.

229
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,393
<i>♪ Ooh ♪</i>

230
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,773
<i>♪ Your power... ♪</i>

231
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,776
Uncle Wolf here is the one
who tried to kill me.

232
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,612
He broke my heart.

233
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,655
Yes, you did.

234
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,199
-Warlords working for him.
-Tell me that shit ain't true.

235
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,327
Ain't this family been good to you?

236
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,078
-And I was trying to save it.
-Save it?

237
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,622
She's trying to go after Nicky Barnes.

238
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,918
Ask her. You don't have to be a genius
to know that's suicide.

239
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,503
You go after Mr. Untouchable
and you gonna get touched.

240
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:56,341
-Nicky's a weak nigga just like you.
-Let me finish him, Mama.

241
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,344
No. Shaolin took the initiative...

242
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,722
so he's gonna do the honors.

243
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,475
Could you leave your best friend behind?

244
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,226
Could you take that initiative

245
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,189
to advance yourself and your city
before New York is left to the roaches?

246
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,650
Are you following me?

247
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,611
I think so.

248
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,529
Because if you say yes...

249
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,366
you will be empowered.

250
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,242
And with that power,

251
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,537
you can return to your friends and family
in the Bronx as a leader.

252
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,916
Free of poverty,
free of filth and squalor.

253
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,126
But you have to free yourself first.

254
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,382
You see, it's the friendships we break

255
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,968
more so than the friendships we make

256
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,470
that delineate the intelligent leader.

257
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:47,058
I've got the power now, Jackie.

258
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,685
Open up.

259
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,311
Open.

260
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,399
<i>- ♪ I'm gonna drink you up ♪</i>

261
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,316
<i>♪ Whoa ♪</i>

262
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,570
<i>♪ Unh, sweet like cherry wine... ♪</i>

263
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,740
Take that in your hand.

264
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,493
Feel the power in that.

265
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,247
The power to take a man's life.

266
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,084
Power can restore justice...

267
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,003
right wrongs...

268
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,213
lift whole communities.

269
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:24,012
I want you to taste exactly
what it's like to be powerless.

270
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:28,891
You have the power to stay quiet
or the power to tell.

271
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:33,354
Power can change people's lives,
improve them.

272
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,065
You have the power over this man's life.

273
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,775
You chose to kill him.

274
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:42,321
<i>If you excel</i>
<i>in this internship, college awaits.</i>

275
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:47,160
<i>But the road to power will take you away</i>
<i>from all you hold dear.</i>

276
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,455
So, kill him. Use it. Use your power.

277
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,165
Feel it.

278
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,292
And when you return to the Bronx,

279
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,795
the friends and family
that you left behind...

280
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,506
<i>- ...will look you in the eye...</i>

281
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,052
Don't hide behind Annie no more.

282
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,095
...and say to you, "Ezekiel..."

283
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,931
-Count to three.
-"...you're not the same."

284
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,391
<i>Quiet and slow.</i>

285
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,061
- "<i>You're changing</i>."
- Take three breaths.

286
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,354
"You're not one of us anymore."

287
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,356
-Don't let her run you.
-And on the third one...

288
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,150
-Make her do it.
-...pull the trigger.

289
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,570
<i>Be bold.</i>

290
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,114
"<i>Your heart's turned cold."</i>

291
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,701
She might've got your manhood,
but don't let her steal your soul.

292
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,788
<i>- Can you handle that sort of road?</i>

293
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,792
I can handle it, Mr. Gunns.

294
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,217
Real good.

295
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,845
Just like I knew you would.

296
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,394
I want the power to change things.
I want the internship, Mr. Gunns.

297
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,605
Next Saturday your friend Francisco
is hosting a campaign event

298
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,857
for my friend Ed Koch.
I'd love you to be there.

299
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,277
Not as our ghetto mascot
as you implied before,

300
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:07,115
but as a young leader taking his first
transformative steps to help his city.

301
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,536
Endorse Ed as a representative
of the future we're building.

302
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,913
-Could you do that?
-Next Saturday?

303
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,583
-Or do you have something else scheduled?
-My friends and I have this music thing.

304
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,045
I can do both.

305
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,256
Welcome aboard, Ezekiel.

306
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,484
So, how you feeling?

307
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,194
I'm all right.

308
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,737
-You sure?
-Yeah.

309
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,117
Wolf was your friend, right?

310
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,287
Mine, too.

311
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,123
It's hard growing up, ain't it?

312
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,170
Come on. Give Annie a hug.

313
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,006
It's okay, baby.

314
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,341
It's okay.

315
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,514
It's a rough game we play, man.

316
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,892
But it's the only one we got, right?

317
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,311
You a man now.

318
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,355
The kind of man I knew you'd be.

319
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,485
And Annie's got so much love
in her heart for you.

320
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,825
I remember the first day you came around.

321
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,538
Looking so lost, like a little lost puppy.

322
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,708
And we took you in like you was blood.

323
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,126
And now you are.

324
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,046
Now you in it all the way, sugar.

325
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,382
You know, could've been worse for Wolf.

326
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,428
For what he did, what he tried to do,

327
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:56,015
there was a time when
I would've really made him suffer.

328
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,061
But Annie's getting old and soft now.

329
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,566
So, anybody asks you about Wolf,
what you gonna say?

330
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,735
I don't know nothing about that.

331
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:13,574
Now I'm gonna need you to, 
take over some of his responsibilities.

332
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,703
So, Saturday night I'm gonna need you
on 123rd to supervise.

333
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,081
-This Saturday?
-Yeah, this Saturday.

334
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,584
No, no, Annie, I can't do that.
I got my music on Saturday.

335
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,628
-A DJ'ing thing.
-A DJ thing?

336
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,506
Something I've been planning for a while,
it's important.

337
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,925
Ain't no "buts," man.
"Buts" are for children.

338
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,719
You a man now.

339
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,429
You gotta answer the call.

340
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,724
All right, wait. What if I push
your product at my party instead?

341
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,769
We're gonna have a crowd.
I could move more dust, coke and weed

342
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,063
than every pusher on 123rd combined.

343
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,357
I'm telling you, Annie,
we'll sell so much shit.

344
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,069
I can do my DJ thing and make you
beaucoup profit. I can do both.

345
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,113
I promise you.
Just give me one go at this.

346
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,120
Well, if you say so, sugar.

347
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,003
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm a little disgusted with myself.

348
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,340
Just make sure that the record
gets out to the DJs, okay?

349
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,509
-No chance, Jackie.
-What?

350
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,177
But nice seeing you again.

351
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,013
Yo, Leslie, I--

352
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,474
Come on. I'll go to the police.

353
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,769
-For what?
-That was rape. I was raped.

354
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:24,854
So was I.

355
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,608
You and your girl are dead
in this business, Jackie.

356
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,693
Please, you gotta give me a chance.

357
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,903
- Fuck off.
- Yeah, fuck off.

358
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,488

-No.

I've done bad things.

ultimate goal in this graffiti gig?

370
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,905
-Goal?
-I can't believe Rumi wants to be

writing in tunnels his whole life.

372
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,076
Doesn't he wanna rise
from some alien ashes?

373
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,495
Be a phoenix? Find a new form?

374
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,331
True, true.

375
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:29,335
So, let him do it.
Set the alien in the top hat free, bro.

376
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:33,381
-Introduce him to the world.
-Maybe. One day.

377
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,634
Tonight.
There's an art party in a gallery.

378
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,136
Phoenixes, aliens.
You should come down to SoHo.

379
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,347
...okay, I guess.

380
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,349
Don't worry. They'll let you in.

381
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,267
We'll celebrate this.

382

in New York.

one day see the light of day.

Hi, Sondra.
Jackie Moreno calling for Dan Gold.

385
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:08,916
But the thing is, Janice,
this is a very time-sensitive opportunity.

386
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:13,713
Les Lesgold from Turntable Tastemakers
went berserk when she heard "Set Me Free."

387
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,966
- <i>Leslie Lesgold said it was dead.</i>
- Yeah, but listen, listen...

388
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,178
Donna Summer heard an advance pressing
and she fired her whole entire staff.

389

"Set Me Free" by Mylene Cruz.
I'm shocked you haven't heard of it.

- Okay, okay.

back to Kangaroo-ville.

No, no, no. You were supposed to send
a thousand textbooks

504
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,313
and two dozen school desks.

505
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:32,317
Instead you sent two dozen books
and zero desks.

506
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,485
<i>Que fue--</i>

Roy Asheton from Marrakesh Star
on Line 2.

508
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,407
I'm gonna call you right back.

509
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,747
Gran Barrio Records,
Francisco Cruz, CEO speaking.

510
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,125
Who's calling please? Roy Asheton?

511
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,670
I know who you are, Roy.
Marrakesh Star Records, right?

512
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,923
Thank you.

513
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,218
Well, yeah, we think the world
of Mylene over here, too.

514
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,513
What? Today?

515
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,309
Well, we're kind of busy over here
right now, Roy.

516
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,854
But you know what, why not?

517
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,190
Well, yeah, me and Mylene, of course.

518
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,444
Well, we can be there later,
you just give me the address.

519
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,696
You're gonna send a limo.

520
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:22,034
Fine, that'll work.
Okay, we'll see you later on today.

521
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,707
You... take the rest of the day off.

522
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,084
<i>Pero </i>get me Mylene on the phone first.

523
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,801
Whoa.

524
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,221
Hold it! Hold it, hold it. Hold the line.

525
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,097
Hey, hold the line.
Hold the line.

526
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,933
Hold, hold it, hold it, hold it.

527
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,311
Moreno Industries,
Jackie Moreno speaking, how may--?

528
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,354
Francisco.

529
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,316
Francisco, <i>qué pasa,</i> bro?
It's funny, I was just gonna call you.

530
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,154
I wanted to-- You're going where?
That's not a good idea, that's a bad idea.

531
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,823
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You cannot go up there without me.

532
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:02,741
I'm on my way.

533
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,766
Good cake.

534
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,352
<i>Forgive me, Mr. Asheton,</i>
<i>Teddy Pendergrass, Line 2.</i>

535
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,980
- Take a message.
- Did she say "Teddy Pendergrass"?

536
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,523
So, Mr. Cruz,

537
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,900
-like I said before--
-Hold on for a second.

538
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,652
I don't mean any disrespect, Roy.

539
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:42,364
But if you're too big-time to take
Teddy Pendergrass' phone call,

540
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,574
how I know what you'll do
with my phone calls?

541
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,410
-Or my niece's?
-Fair question.

542
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,245
Teddy's on tour right now.

543
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,456
While on tour,
Teddy enjoys copious amounts of...

544
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,626
-winter sports.
-Winter sports?

545
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:55,961
Skiing.

546
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:01,383
- "Peruvian slopes."
. <i>Entiendo,</i> yeah. I-- I see.

547
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,719
Teddy'd be broke by Harrisburg
if I didn't ignore his calls.

548
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,139
- <i>Sorry, I tried to stop him.</i>
- Cisco! Cisco, don't--

549
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,016
- Hey.
- Don't listen to this guy.

550
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,809
This fucking guy, he's a liar.

551
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,686
-Jackie.
-Cisco, I came down here...

552
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,438
Jackie fucking Moreno.

553
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,523
...to admit my wrongdoings.
I'm gonna pay you back.

554
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,900
I'm just begging you right now
to hear me out.

555
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,111
Is that Jackie fucking Moreno
I see before me?

556
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,197
-I bet you are enjoying this, aren't you?
-You know what you are?

557
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,782
Yeah! It's not good, either!

558
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,493
-You are a fucking genius!
-But that doesn't mean--

559
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:33,498
You hear me?
A genius, that's what you are.

560
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,877
-Jackie, have some cake.
-You guys-- You guys are eating cake?

561
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,171
- Have a slice, it's light.
- And buttery.

562
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,966
I always believed in you.
You know that, right?

563
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,136
You just needed some tough love.
I provided it, and now look.

564
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,972
"Set Me Free" is a winner,
the first of many.

565
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:51,850
- You think it's a winner?
- Who gives a shit what I think?

566
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,228
Your record is busting out
in all the gay clubs.

567
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:59,024
And disco hits don't become hits
unless all the fairies

568
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,984
wave their wands in unison.

569
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,696
"Set Me Free" has a 21-gun salute from
every wand-waving Tinker Bell in town.

570
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,407
-Yeah, I mean...
-How'd you get to Carlo Pakoussa?

571
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,203
Hey, man, I don't-- I don't kiss and tell.

572
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:17,209
This Pakoussa character, Mr. Cruz,
he's the king of the fairies.

573
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:21,046
Doesn't have a pot to piss in,
yet his say-so makes stars overnight.

574
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,298
And stars make money.

575
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,051
That's what you're gonna be, Mylene,
if we do this right.

576
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,844
Not so fast with the "we" shit, okay?

577
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,264
What about this contract
that your lawyer sent?

578
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,391
What lawyer?

579
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,227
Ignore the contract.
Fuck the lawyer, he's fired.

580
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,646
We'll make our own contract, together.

581
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,357
An equitable one between all parties.

582
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:41,858
Right, Jackie?

583
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,945
I'm gonna tell you the truth, Roy.

584
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:49,825
I asked Jackie about you, and he didn't
have a lot of good things to say.

585
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:52,953
Okay.

586
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,747
How about I put my cards on the table?

587
00:31:56,706 --> 00:32:00,085
I sell more disco albums
than any other label in the country.

588
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,463
My records go number one,
my artists win Grammys.

589
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,799
If you sign to Marrakesh Star,
you will make more money

590
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,218
than you could anywhere else.

591
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,471
Yes, I take a higher percentage
than other labels.

592
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:16,226
But that's because I'm the fucking best.
And my employees are the fucking best.

593
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:19,521
You will make more money and have
a longer career with me taking more

594
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,356
than with anyone else taking less.

595
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:25,068
Your niece, her two friends,
they're stars.

596
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,279
"Set Me Free" is a hit.

597
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:31,992
So, feel free to shop around.
But don't wait too long.

598
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,326
I'm fickle

599
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,662
and occasionally vindictive.

600
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,707
My analyst says I should work on that.
I fired him.

601
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,917
So, what do you say?

602
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,961
I say we're a lot alike.

603
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,713
Okay, then.

604
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,592
We're gonna shop around a little,
then we'll get back to you.

605
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,509
-No.
-Yes.

606
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:54,181
No, no, no, <i>tío</i>. I want this.
I wanna sign with Mr. Asheton.

607
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,559
Regina, Yolanda and I wanna be
at Marrakesh, same as Misty.

608
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,811
I trust you to protect me
and Jackie to guide me.

609
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,189
I'll let you write the contract
and I'll sign it,

610
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,065
but we wanna be at Marrakesh.

611
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,192
Okay?

612
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,154
Fine.

613
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,825
Roy, you're a serious man.
I'm a serious man, too.

614
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,036
I know you are, I looked you up.

615
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,787
Good. So, then...

616
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,832
-we understand each other.
-Absolutely.

617
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:24,544
Hey, welcome to the music business.

618
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,340
Thank you.

619
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:29,799
Thank you.

620
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,513
<i>Dear Mom</i>

621
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,474
<i>Tonight I find myself in a strange place</i>

622
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,684
<i>Will I about face?</i>

623
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:43,063
<i>Will I leave my brothers</i>
<i>And vanish without a trace?</i>

624
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,983
<i>And in exchange as I step onstage</i>
<i>I'm handed talking points which say</i>

625
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,069
<i>The youth have lost their way</i>

626
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:52,197
<i>So, on election day</i>
<i>Brothers and sisters of the Bronx</i>

627
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,074
<i>Vote for the great white hope</i>

628
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,868
<i>Koch is a man who will lock up the animals</i>

629
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,997
<i>Like my friend Dizzee</i>
<i>Whose crime is painting with bright colors</i>

630
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,541
<i>On rusty trains</i>

631
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,168
<i>I mean, are my brothers</i>
<i>Really crabs in a barrel</i>

632
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,837
<i>Loading bullets in the barrel</i>
<i>In the belly of the beast?</i>

633
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,840
<i>No</i>
<i>There's no justice, no peace</i>

634
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,176
<i>Yo, I'm going through emotions</i>
<i>About my street brothers</i>

635
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,428
<i>With that music in our veins</i>
<i>But then what?</i>

636
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,556
<i>Underground</i>
<i>Is that where I'll remain?</i>

637
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:20,559
<i>Where can I reign?</i>
<i>Where is my kingdom, man?</i>

638
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,354
<i>'Cause I know a king needs a queen</i>
<i>And my butterscotch queen, Mylene</i>

639
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,357
<i>I blush when I see her</i>
<i>I cry when she sing</i>

640
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:31,820
<i>-But she's got a ticket out, now I do, too</i>
-Power can change people's lives.

641
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,281
<i>So, I know what I gotta do</i>

642
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,326
<i>Painful as it seems for me</i>
<i>And my queen and our dream</i>

643
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,662
<i>I gotta leave the Bronx</i>
<i>'Cause the Bronx is burning</i>

644
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,122
<i>And we need a solution</i>

645
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,751
<i>But the Get Down ain't no revolution</i>

646
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:52,007
<i>So, God forgive and please, please, please</i>
<i>Grant me absolution</i>

647
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:57,429
Okay, Okay.
<i>Oye,</i> Ed Koch is running a little late,

648
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,723
but you're not gonna wanna miss this,
so sit tight, okay?

649
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,777
Hey, yo, y'all know where Books at?

650
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:14,988
-No.
-No.

651
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,744
How about you? 
You know where he at?

652
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,787
No.

653
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:26,833
Yo, he said his ghetto mascot
audition wasn't gonna jam us up.

654
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:28,960
Where's he at, man?

655
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,880
What the fuck is going on here?

656
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,507
<i>Hola, mi gente.</i>

657
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,135
Look at all of our beautiful people
here?

658
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:43,224
You all know how much we've suffered
for years under Mayor Beame.

659
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:49,356
Mayor Abe Beame, who has proven himself
time and time again

660
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:52,359
to be an incompetent, insensitive,

661
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:55,403
bean-counting, pencil-pushing
little midget...

662
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,616
...who has betrayed our people
and our community.

663
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,034
- Yeah.
- That's right.

664
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,453
And then there's Mario Cuomo.

665
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,581
-I like Mario Cuomo. I know Mario.
-Can I have that after?

666
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:10,960
I used to play sandlot baseball
with-with-with Mario, a long time ago.

667
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:15,840
<i>Pero</i>, the unions,
they have Mario in their pockets.

668
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,384
<i>Es la verdad.</i> That's the truth.

669
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:21,012
And I like the unions,
but I'm gonna ask you something right now.

670
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,474
How many of you actually have
a nice union job?

671
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,768
- Nope. No.
- That's right.

672
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,271
The unions are not just gonna
open up for us on their own.

673
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,982
Poverty is not just gonna end on its own.

674
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,195
The Bronx is not gonna stop burning
on its own!

675
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:43,159
I pulled you off the corner because
Annie needs y'all working the crowd.

676
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:48,039
Annie don't play, so I don't wanna hear
about no problems offing this shit.

677
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,874
- Yo, we got you, Shao.
- All right.

678
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,710
Five twenties to a gram.

679
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,586
Don't take no shorts.

680
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,256
Get that money. 'Cause if you don't,
I'll have hell to pay.

681
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,008
- If I gotta pay, y'all gonna pay, too.
- Get Down Brothers.

682
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,594
Watch out for the stick-up kids.
Where the fuck is Zeke?

683
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,057
We need a guy in city hall
who cares about us.

684
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:10,186
We need someone who's gonna bring
the proper services to us, right up here!

685
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:14,441
- We need jobs and safe streets.
- Yes.

686
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,818
Clean, affordable homes for our people.

687
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,280
Ladies and gentlemen, <i>damas y caballeros</i>,

688
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,407
that man is sitting with us
here right now.

689
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:26,703
The next mayor of New York.
Born in the Bronx.

690
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,080
- A friend of the Bronx.
- All right.

691
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:32,333
A tough guy for tough times. Bronx tough.

692
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,543
<i>Vamos a darle la mano.</i>

693
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:37,130
Ed Koch! Give him a hand. Ed Koch!

694
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:46,014
The sounds you hear.
Deaf to your ear.

695
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,348
Are you ready?

696
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,061
-Damn, man, yo, what is that?
-That's the Echoplex.

697
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,481
We can't fight that without Zeke.

698
00:37:55,273 --> 00:38:00,195
Listen up!
We say ladies first.

699
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,035
Fuck Zeke. We don't need him.
This is a DJ battle, right?

700
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,955
Don't forget, whichever crew
gets the B-boys to rock

701
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,083
is the crew that comes out on top.

702
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,545
Hello, South Bronx!

703
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:21,007
-How you doing?
-We got no hot water. How you doing?

704
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:24,511
And let me tell you, that is a crime.

705
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:30,517
And speaking of crime, how many of you
feel safe in your own neighborhood?

706
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,103
-Spend a night out here and find out!
-I grew up here.

707
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:39,400
And what I see is nothing short
of a national emergency.

708
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:43,822
And you know what?
It makes me mad as hell.

709
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:44,823
How about you?

710
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,199
Yeah!

711
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,534
I'm mad.

712
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:52,247
I mean, look at this place.
This used to be a nice place.

713
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,832
You see that wall?

714
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:58,127
You know what that wall said
when I was a kid? Nothing.

715
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:02,674
Because when I was a kid,
we had a mayor who cared

716
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,760
about hoodlums defacing public property.

717
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,721
Whoo!

718
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,452
Job one when I am mayor:

719
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:37,417
Francisco Cruz and I are gonna build new,
clean, affordable housing right here.

720
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,795
That's right, right here.

721
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,381
But when we do...

722
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:48,219
there won't be any more vile,
lawless graffiti animals to worry about.

723
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,096
Because guess what?

724
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:55,393
I'm gonna pass laws
to put those vandals behind bars.

725
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,062
That's right.

726
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,149
-Yo, Dizzee better watch out.
-Yo, forget this dude.

727
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:06,070
Mandatory three-day sentences
for all repeat graffiti thugs.

728
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,574
Yeah!

729
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:16,247
Graffiti will die under Ed Koch!

730
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,019
Yo, turn on the Berthas.

731
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,527
Friends, you all know...

732
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:50,031
...that some of our brightest hopes
for the future

733
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,618
reside right here in the South Bronx...

734
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,079
and I'd like you to meet one of them.

735
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:57,705
Come here, son.

736
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,671
This is Ezekiel Figuero...

737
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:13,554
...the first participant
in the new internship program

738
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,556
at the Fiscal Control Committee.

739
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,352
Ezekiel, you're not one of these, 
graffiti bums, right?

740
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,189
No, sir.

741
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:26,609
And he's certainly
not one of those delinquents

742
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,028
making all that noisy racket over there.

743
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,697
With the boom-boom-boom, is he?

744
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,326
Give Ezekiel a hand.

745
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,878
We can't hear you!

746
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,258
Play! Loud!

747
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:53,803
Your system ain't strong enough.

748
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:59,726
We gonna give you a taste of the bass.

749
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,398
<i>♪ Put those hands up</i>
<i>Put those hands up ♪</i>

750
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:06,899
<i>♪ Everybody put those hands up ♪</i>

751
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,956
<i>♪ With a little treble</i>
<i>And a whole lot of bass ♪</i>

752
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,375
<i>♪ We're Notorious Three</i>
<i>We about to rock this place ♪</i>

753
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,259
Um... I wrote a speech.

754
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,705
But who's got time for all that, right?

755
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,083
So, I'm gonna just riff this.

756
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:12,298
The-- The super-cool Persian poet Rumi
once wrote:

757
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,886
"Where there's ruin,
there's hope for a treasure."

758
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,142
Now, the other day I was up on 183rd,

759
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,603
and this rich lady called it "taki," man.

760
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,567
But I talked to my man Tracy from 168th.

761
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:36,906
And he said,
"Listen for the voice of the ghetto."

762
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,950
Yeah.

763
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,662
'Cause it crashes down on you
when you least expect it.

764
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,789
That's you, man.

765
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,836
Even from the cats that stay high...

766
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:51,712

00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,883

Or how quick they fly by.

771
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:05,726
Or I could listen.

772
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,314
And say, we're a team.

773
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,484
Aw, yeah!

774
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,195
And as a crew or a squad...

775
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,614
we work together like Moses did...

776
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,200

780
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,751
let me just say this.

781
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,589
The young people aren't the problem.

782
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:36,841
We're the solution.

783
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:40,636
Yeah!

784
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:45,224
That's what my mama used to say.

785
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:48,144

00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,782
Which is why I'm honored to be here.

gave me this opportunity.

791
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,623
vote Ed Koch for mayor.

792
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,082

793
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:12,585
