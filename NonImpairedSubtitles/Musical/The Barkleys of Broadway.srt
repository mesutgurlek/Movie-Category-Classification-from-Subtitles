1
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:25,767
<i>You'll adore the step</i>
<i>that everyone's been waiting for</i>

2
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:28,977
<i>You'll find a crowd on every dancing floor</i>

3
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:30,910
<i>Because of something called</i>
<i>the Swing Trot</i>

4
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,277
<i>Remember Swing Trot</i>

5
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:35,647
<i>It's a deal</i>
<i>It's very simple with terrif'appeal</i>

6
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,122
<i>You grab a partner when you hear a band</i>
<i>And you're the greatest dancer in the land</i>

7
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:43,819
<i>It's bill and coo-y</i>
<i>Tea for two-y</i>

8
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:46,359
<i>Just watch your partner's eyes grow dewy</i>

9
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:48,761
<i>Entre nous-y, you're slightly screwy</i>

10
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>But irresistible!</i>

11
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:55,201
<i>On and on</i>
<i>Oh, what a natural they've hit upon</i>

12
00:00:55,271 --> 00:01:00,140
<i>It gets you going till you're really gone</i>
<i>And you will never rue the day</i>

13
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,044
<i>The day you realize</i>
<i>the Swing Trot is here to stay</i>

14
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,104
Speech!

15
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,567
Thank you again, ladies and gentlemen.

16
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:34,262
We're overjoyed
at this wonderful reception...

17
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:36,567
of our third show together...

18
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,631
and I think I speak
for my two lifelong partners...

19
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:42,906
my charming wife
and Ezra Millar, the composer...

20
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:47,040
when I say that none of us
could have done it without the other two.

21
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:53,183
I don't know.
I've done it before without you two.

22
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,281
Four shows, four flops.

23
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:00,161
Ezra, the score to this is just wonderful.
I feel you should get all the credit.

24
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,629
I do, too.

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,026
Incidentally, while we're patting
each other on the back...

26
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,468
what about your little woman?

27
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:11,006
She contributed something
to the occasion.

28
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:16,401
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
But what would my performance be...

29
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,778
without my husband
Josh Barkley's clever lyrics...

30
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:21,544
and brilliant direction?

31
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,746
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sure that my lyrics and direction...

32
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:28,450
would mean absolutely nothing...

33
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:31,493
without my clever and brilliant wife
to perform them.

34
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:36,131
But, ladies and gentlemen,
I merely perform the material...

35
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,690
the way my husband taught
and directed me.

36
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:42,363
But, ladies and gentlemen,
in the hands of a talent...

37
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:44,406
such as my lovely wife Dinah's...

38
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,204
any material would look
pretty darned wonderful.

39
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,411
- But, ladies and gentlemen...
- Ladies and gentlemen...

40
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,641
this meeting
of the mutual admiration society...

41
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:55,240
is now adjourned.
Thank you, and good night.

42
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:01,651
- Sign my book.
- Just one more. Please sign.

43
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,425
Just one more.

44
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:09,898
There you are.
All right. That's the last one now.

45
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:12,434
- We've got to go.
- I'm going.

46
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,263
- Where are you going?
- Have a good time.

47
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:18,966
- Goodbye.
- Have a nice time.

48
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,077
- Allow me, madam.
- Thank you, sir.

49
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:35,389
Must we go to old lady Belney's party?
It's so nice here.

50
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:38,851
But we have to. Opening night party
at Mrs. Livingston Belney's.

51
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:40,953
My dear, it's a state law.

52
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:44,795
Opening night.
It was wonderful, though, wasn't it?

53
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:48,334
- Everything went so smoothly.
- It just goes to show...

54
00:04:48,404 --> 00:04:51,805
all those little troubles along the way
just don't matter now.

55
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:55,669
Like those silly little rows we had
in rehearsal and on the road.

56
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,048
Darling, did you really mean
all those things you said about me...

57
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,011
in your curtain speech?

58
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,946
Honey, of course I did.

59
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:07,679
It was your show tonight. I could feel it.

60
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,523
Then you mean it was really all right?

61
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,821
All right? Why, you were terrific.

62
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:18,324
You got all your laughs, your timing,
every gesture, perfect.

63
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:20,365
Oh, thank you, darling.

64
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:26,466
Of course, if I wanted to be a...
Well, it didn't amount to anything.

65
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,878
There was one place
in the subway scene...

66
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:32,574
that maybe you could've gotten
a little more out of.

67
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:33,876
But, well...

68
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,443
Really?

69
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,719
No, it was nothing. It was just a...

70
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:44,983
No, what was wrong? I want to know.

71
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:47,826
It was just a detail.

72
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:50,862
Probably opening night nerves.
We'll talk about it later.

73
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,663
I want to talk about it now.
I won't sleep a wink tonight...

74
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:56,102
- worrying about it.
- Nothing to worry about, drop it.

75
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:59,232
You brought it up.
You think you can sit here, criticizing me...

76
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:01,503
I don't want to go into it. It's just a detail.

77
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:03,010
It's always just a detail.

78
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:06,105
A detail here, a detail there,
and then it starts to grow.

79
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:09,913
Pick, pick, pick on everything I do.
It's just...

80
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:11,812
What was it?

81
00:06:13,322 --> 00:06:14,789
Well, if you must know...

82
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:18,384
I just thought you could've
put a little more drama in there.

83
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:21,222
A little more emotion.
The audience wants to cry there.

84
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,060
You didn't let them. You owe it to them.

85
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,690
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

86
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,600
- Did it ever occur to you that you...
- The doorman.

87
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,366
Well.

88
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:32,837
There they are! Welcome, my darlings.

89
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,511
- Josh! Dinah!
- What?

90
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:41,744
- I've got something important to tell you.
- I've got to talk to you.

91
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,446
- Hurry up.
- What's the secret?

92
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,215
What are you doing? Stop it.

93
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:47,347
Well, what?

94
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:48,651
- What is the matter?
- Nothing.

95
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:50,521
I thought I'd rescue you from the squares.

96
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:51,617
- Thanks, pal.
- I wondered.

97
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:53,525
"In the nick of time Ezra,"
that's my name.

98
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:55,325
- Come on. Have some coffee.
- No, thanks.

99
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:58,390
Like during those curtain speeches.
If I hadn't stopped you...

100
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:01,403
you'd have been at each others' throats
in another second.

101
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:03,302
What do you mean
"at each others throats"?

102
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:05,738
- We meant every word we said. Didn't we?
- Of course.

103
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:09,073
Ezra, you exaggerate this thing
about our fighting much too much.

104
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:12,376
- Sure.
- After all, we haven't had a fight in weeks.

105
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:14,143
- In weeks.
- Of course not.

106
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:19,510
I apologize for what happened
in the car, Dinah.

107
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,124
I'm sorry. I apologize to you.

108
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:30,057
And I apologize to both of you
for having let you out of my sight.

109
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,624
It's my fault.

110
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,692
Hey, Cleo. Where have you been?

111
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:38,002
I beg your pardon, Mr. Millar.
This lady happens to be my wife.

112
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:40,565
Congratulations.
Are you happy in your work?

113
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:44,475
- Cleo?
- Looking for me, baby?

114
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,914
Why don't you wear an X
on your forehead? Come on, follow me.

115
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:55,814
There's Mrs. Belney.
She's going to ask us to perform.

116
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,189
Let's duck. Mrs. Belney.

117
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,421
- Excuse us. I'm sorry.
- Thank you very much.

118
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:01,360
- Excuse us, please.
- I know what let's do.

119
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,863
- What?
- We'll fill these plates...

120
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:05,423
- smuggle them under our coats, go home.
- We can't.

121
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:08,834
- This whole thing is for us.
- There must be a place we can be alone.

122
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,237
- Well, I know, but...
- Let's go out on the terrace.

123
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:12,535
Honey, there's snow out there.

124
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,405
I'll get your wrap. We'll have a picnic.

125
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:16,741
- Wonderful!
- Fine. Now you pile up your plate...

126
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:19,542
and follow me out there.
Bring a knife and fork.

127
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,180
I'll probably freeze to death.

128
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:25,180
May I be of some assistance,
Mrs. Barkley?

129
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,585
Thank you, yes.

130
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,715
- Would you mind holding that?
- Not at all.

131
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,089
We haven't met. I'm Jacques Barredout.

132
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:33,995
How do you do? Of course.

133
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:36,224
I should have recognized you
from your pictures.

134
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,130
I'm glad you didn't. They're frightful.

135
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:41,227
The only good one I have
is rather indecent, I'm afraid.

136
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:43,772
Taken on a bearskin rug
at the age of three months.

137
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,466
I have one of those, too.

138
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,530
- You do?
- Yes.

139
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:54,042
I'm quite an admirer of your plays.

140
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,614
I understand you're just finishing
a new one.

141
00:08:56,686 --> 00:09:00,315
It's just about finishing me.
My most serious effort. I plan to direct it.

142
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,857
- How nice.
- I only hope it'll be half as successful...

143
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:06,088
as your little musical extravaganza.
I was there tonight.

144
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:12,026
- Well, the audience seemed to like it.
- Unfortunately, I did not.

145
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,528
- Well, at least you're honest.
- Now, don't be angry, please.

146
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,265
I don't care for musical comedy in general.

147
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:23,837
- But this one for a special reason.
- And what was that?

148
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,272
You.

149
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:30,849
You're wasted in musical comedy.
You could be a great tragic actress.

150
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:35,084
<i>Monsieur</i> Barredout,
you really don't mean that.

151
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,249
I do.

152
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:40,551
There was one moment in particular
I was moved to tears, the subway scene.

153
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,927
Shall we?

154
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,762
The subway scene!

155
00:09:57,246 --> 00:10:00,807
And who knows?
Sarah Bernhardt, Eleanora Duse...

156
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:05,512
in this crass, modern, commercial theater
might have ended up in musical comedy...

157
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:07,852
just as you have done. Don't you see?

158
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:13,889
Oh, but it's so utterly silly of you
to compare me...

159
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:16,488
with those inspired immortals.

160
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,356
After all...

161
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:24,566
But you really did think
in the subway scene I had some of their...

162
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,131
Their quality. <i>Mais oui.</i>

163
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:29,876
How extraordinary.

164
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,539
Only a few minutes ago
I was talking to someone...

165
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:38,815
who didn't think
I had the emotional gift at all.

166
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:43,820
- He must be a complete idiot.
- Well, it's interesting to get both...

167
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,862
- Oh! Darling, where have you been?
- Siberia.

168
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,888
Bless you.

169
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:54,169
I got into the most interesting
conversation with <i>Monsieur</i> Barredout.

170
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,761
Allow me to present <i>Monsieur</i> Barredout.
Mr. Husband.

171
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,397
- Barkley's the name.
- How do you do?

172
00:10:58,474 --> 00:11:00,442
- How do you do?
- I was telling your wife...

173
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:03,740
- I'd seen your show tonight and I think...
- Don't tell him.

174
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,479
- Charming.
- Thanks.

175
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,076
And now, Mrs. Barkley,
I hope we meet again...

176
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,584
now that we have a bearskin rug
in common.

177
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:14,612
- Will you excuse me?
- Certainly.

178
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,382
<i>- Au revoir.</i>
<i>- Au revoir.</i>

179
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:23,855
Don't you think we ought to...

180
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,767
Where are they? Oh, there you are!

181
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:29,201
You're not going?
Darlings, I want you to come...

182
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,900
- do the little number you did.
- Sorry, I can't sing, I have a terrible cold.

183
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:35,443
I may not be able to do
the show tomorrow night.

184
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:39,447
- But, Millie, I'm in beautiful voice tonight.
- Don't you think you better play?

185
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:42,951
Listen everyone, Ezra's going to play.

186
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:44,952
- Good.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

187
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:49,086
You know my favorite, darling.
<i>Pale Fingers.</i>

188
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:02,097
Did anybody here ask
for the <i>Sabre Dance?</i>

189
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:04,571
- I'd like to hear <i>Campanella.</i>
<i>- Rhapsody in Blue.</i>

190
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,766
<i>Malaguena.</i>

191
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:17,844
<i>- Sabre Dance,</i> anybody?
- Oh, no.

192
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:26,584
Well, if you insist.

193
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:33,185
Opening night.

194
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:43,324
Some opening night.

195
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:48,795
All right. What about opening night?

196
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:51,329
Big sentimental occasion.

197
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,901
Our moment of triumph.
And what do I find you doing?

198
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:58,744
Flirting with a stuffed dinner jacket.

199
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:00,806
- Flirting?
- Flirting.

200
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,510
- Oh, darling, how perfectly ridiculous.
- Yeah.

201
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:04,780
I was just sitting there...

202
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:07,253
- talking to the man, that's all.
- Sure, naturally.

203
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,484
- And I couldn't get away.
- You couldn't get away.

204
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:12,550
And I'm out there
on that terrace catching my death of cold.

205
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:15,529
A lot you care if I have to do
the show from an oxygen tent.

206
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:17,828
An oxygen tent! Oh, really!

207
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,767
I've been sneezing and coughing
like a Model T.

208
00:15:22,237 --> 00:15:24,728
You haven't had a hint of a sneeze
for over an hour.

209
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:26,604
I'll bet you're sorry I'm not sneezing.

210
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,111
- Go find a nice draft, sneeze your head off.
- I will not!

211
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:32,773
Oh, darling, don't be so childish!

212
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:35,975
- A lot of sympathy a fellow gets here.
- You're tired, so am I.

213
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:38,952
- I could stay in bed for a week.
- Could be in bed for a week...

214
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,249
and nobody would give a hang.

215
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:43,314
- What's the matter with...
- Did you say something?

216
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:46,954
For all you care,
I'd still be out on that terrace frozen blue...

217
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,897
and you'd still be inside
simpering at that half-stuffed...

218
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,899
- Oh, Josh.
- "Oh, Josh."

219
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:58,273
I really don't know
what to think of Mr. Barredout.

220
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,001
He said some of the silliest,
most stupid things.

221
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:06,173
Let's hear some of those stupid things
you were so afraid he'd repeat to me.

222
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:11,078
Well, if you really must know,
he just hated the show.

223
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:14,919
Did he? I'm glad. Now I know it's good.

224
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:17,756
- He hated...
- And the funniest thing of all...

225
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:21,557
is that he thought I was at my best
in the subway scene.

226
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:24,232
Oh, no!

227
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:28,268
He says I'm a great tragic actress...

228
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:31,201
wasted in musical comedy.

229
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:32,706
You, a tragic actress?

230
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:36,006
I'm glad you told me.
Now I know he's a complete imbecile.

231
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,077
He's not such an imbecile as all that.

232
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,951
After all,
before I really went into the theater...

233
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:47,722
in high school, I played Juliet.

234
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,690
"Romeo, Romeo

235
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:01,035
"Wherefore art thou, Romeo?"

236
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,396
- Who played Romeo?
- Mildred Higgins. She was...

237
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:11,034
It's possible that <i>Monsieur</i> Barredout
could see things in me...

238
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,549
- that you don't appreciate.
- Don't get any silly notions in your head.

239
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:18,017
- You're a song and dance girl.
- That's all you ever allowed me to do.

240
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:20,851
- What?
- That's all you ever allowed me to do.

241
00:17:20,923 --> 00:17:24,518
"Allowed you"? Why, you couldn't walk
across the stage without me.

242
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:28,029
There isn't a gesture you do
that I didn't teach you.

243
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:29,325
That's a lie!

244
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:31,730
It took a lot of patience
to put you where you are.

245
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,360
- Patience?
- I worked. I pulled things out of you.

246
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:36,495
- I think that's going...
- I molded you like...

247
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:38,767
- Oh, sure.
- Like Svengali did Trilby.

248
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:42,067
- Svengali?
- Yeah, the guy with the beard, that's me.

249
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,136
- Why, you cheap...
- Go ahead. Throw it.

250
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,917
Thank you, and good night.

251
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:59,023
- Blood!
- Blood?

252
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:02,928
- Blood? Darling, what have I done?
- Nothing. It's just concussion, that's all.

253
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,989
- Darling, no. What have I done?
- I don't know.

254
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,627
Please come in here, let me fix it.
I'll put water on it.

255
00:18:07,703 --> 00:18:11,070
- Looks like a fractured skull.
- Let me fix it for you. You have a hanky?

256
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,165
What with walking pneumonia
and concussion...

257
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,176
a fine performance
I'll give tomorrow night.

258
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:17,735
I'm so sorry. I'm so...

259
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:22,143
- Oh, it's stopped bleeding.
- It has?

260
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:25,718
- Yes. You're going to be all right.
- I am?

261
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:30,514
Dearest, I'm horrible! I'm just horrible!

262
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:32,824
I know what let's do.

263
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:35,329
Come on. Now, hit me!

264
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:42,000
- In cold blood?
- Well, come on. I deserve lt.

265
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:50,501
You look so brave
and you didn't even ask to be blindfolded.

266
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:53,776
- I just can't.
- I insist upon being punished.

267
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,214
All right. You asked for it.

268
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:04,156
- Thank you, darling.
- Thank you.

269
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,224
- I love you.
- I love you, too, baby.

270
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:11,659
I know what let's do.
Let's go downstairs...

271
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,361
- and fix some scrambled eggs and toast.
- I'm not hungry.

272
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:17,633
- But we didn't eat at the party.
- Sure. You were so busy, I was...

273
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:19,298
- Now, now...
- I'm sorry.

274
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:20,907
I'll go get your robe.

275
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:24,343
You must keep nice and warm.
We'll turn on the heat downstairs.

276
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,381
Hey, let's light the fire.

277
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:34,317
Here you are, darling.
Oh, you shouldn't smoke.

278
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:35,822
It isn't good for your cold.

279
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:39,258
I have a confession to make.
I haven't got a cold.

280
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,225
I know it.

281
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:55,571
<i>All that I know</i>

282
00:19:56,245 --> 00:20:00,648
<i>Is you'd be hard to replace</i>

283
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:05,049
<i>Where else in all the world</i>

284
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:09,990
<i>Such loveliness and such grace?</i>

285
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:14,761
<i>The poet often chanted</i>

286
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:20,457
<i>The love he found divine</i>

287
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:24,694
<i>But never was he granted</i>

288
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:30,774
<i>A lady-love like mine</i>

289
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,912
<i>Deep down, deep down inside</i>

290
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:39,349
<i>My secret heart knows</i>

291
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,087
<i>The more that I'm with you</i>

292
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,629
<i>The more and more my rapture grows</i>

293
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:53,663
<i>Without you at my side</i>

294
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:55,133
<i>I fear</i>

295
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:00,441
<i>No future could I face</i>

296
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:04,476
<i>For you'd be</i>

297
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:10,585
<i>Oh, so hard to replace</i>

298
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:44,349
Hello, Ezra.

299
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:47,946
For the producer of a hit show,
you look awful sad. What's up, Bert?

300
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:52,016
- I'm worried, Ezra. Just sit down.
- What about? The show closing in 1953?

301
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,559
I'm worried about Josh and Dinah.

302
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:56,722
They haven't had a fight
since the show opened.

303
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:58,095
They've got a peace pact.

304
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,532
That's just it.
This tension is too much for me.

305
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:04,629
All this calm, all this lovey-dovey.
I don't quite trust it.

306
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:07,774
Ezra, we've got to get
an understudy for Dinah.

307
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:09,674
Don't look at me, I'm knock-kneed.

308
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,939
Come on up on the stage.

309
00:22:11,013 --> 00:22:14,141
There's a cute kid from the chorus
I've had my eye on for some time.

310
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:15,376
I want you to listen to her.

311
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,010
Dinah's never had an understudy.
She's not gonna like it.

312
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,577
Someone will have to break it
to her gently.

313
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:22,680
- I'll bet I'm elected.
- Shirlene!

314
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:25,251
- Yes?
- Ezra, this is Shirlene May.

315
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:29,058
Hello, Mr. Millar.
I'm just scared to death...

316
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:31,861
to sing for such a talented composer
as you are.

317
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:35,102
I'll let you know about that later.
What're you gonna sing?

318
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,229
Mrs. Barkley's blues song from the show.

319
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:38,897
- Good.
- Okay, Shirlene.

320
00:22:39,408 --> 00:22:42,275
Well, if you all are ready, I am.

321
00:22:43,311 --> 00:22:44,778
<i>I'm gonna sing</i>

322
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,938
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi.

323
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:48,107
- Look who dropped in.
- What are you doing here?

324
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:51,016
- We'd like to rehearse.
- In the middle of the night, isn't it?

325
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:53,213
- See you. I'd better get back.
- Wait a minute.

326
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,017
We're caught
with our understudy showing.

327
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,148
- Understudy?
- Understudy?

328
00:22:56,224 --> 00:22:58,818
Josh, Dinah, come here a minute.
I want you to...

329
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:00,384
Ezra!

330
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:03,758
It's like this.
In case anything ever happened...

331
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:06,266
I mean, in case the two of you
just sometime...

332
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:09,098
What he means is,
if you two ever quarrel and you decide...

333
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:12,629
not to go on some night, Dinah.
Bert felt you should have an understudy.

334
00:23:12,707 --> 00:23:15,232
- Nothing wrong with that. Wonderful idea.
- Why not?

335
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,538
- What?
- We don't object, do we?

336
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:18,078
Of course not. You won't need one.

337
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:21,547
- Wonderful.
- Mr. Millar, excuse me. Can I sing now?

338
00:23:21,616 --> 00:23:23,481
- Of course. Go right ahead.
- Fine. Thanks.

339
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:24,541
- Honey.
- Yes?

340
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:26,780
Dinah, this is Miss Shirlene.

341
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:29,421
- Hello, Mrs. Barkley.
- Oh, hello.

342
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,022
- Cute.
- She's going to sing your blues number.

343
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,561
I hope I remember it.
I'm so frightened in front of all my bosses.

344
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:43,598
- I guess I shouldn't have said that.
- Don't be silly. We're all your friends.

345
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,764
- Why, sure.
- Go on, Shirley.

346
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,035
- Thanks. It's Shirlene.
- Shirlene, I'm sorry.

347
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:48,133
Thank you.

348
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,199
Cute?

349
00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:52,008
- Is this all right?
- Yeah, fine. Go ahead.

350
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,240
Joe, please.

351
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:54,574
<i>I'm gonna sing</i>

352
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:56,617
It's not necessary
to make Shirley audition...

353
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,050
- Shirlene.
- Yes, I know, dear.

354
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,417
She'll be perfect for the part.

355
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,649
Let's start our rehearsal
or we won't get it done.

356
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:04,385
- Break it up. Here we go.
- We have a long dance.

357
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:06,859
You're it.
Come on. We'll go up to the office.

358
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:09,419
- Thanks. Thanks awfully.
- All right.

359
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:14,535
You've all been so wonderful to me
and I want to thank you.

360
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:18,102
And, Mrs. Barkley,
I'm going to learn your part real good.

361
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,275
I'll probably never get to do it,
but, well, you never can tell, can you?

362
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:28,382
Well, I guess that's show business. Bye.

363
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:36,052
Josh, what about lunch?

364
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:38,092
Can't do it.
We have to rehearse this number.

365
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,458
It goes in the show tonight.
And then we've to go...

366
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,997
to the gallery where that fellow's
got that portrait...

367
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,588
for publicity or something of us.

368
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:46,099
- The art gallery?
- Yeah.

369
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:47,965
Well, that's show business.

370
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:55,473
- I didn't think she was as cute as all that.
- Not quite as cute as all that, Mr. Barkley.

371
00:24:57,812 --> 00:25:00,872
Your worries are over.
With that hunk of fluff in the wings...

372
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:02,883
why, Dinah would go on
with two broken legs.

373
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:04,515
All right. Go.

374
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:20,518
...principle between art forms...

375
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:23,079
- and formed art. The secret...
- It's here. I'll get Ladi.

376
00:27:23,158 --> 00:27:24,750
- The Barkleys are here.
- Are you ready?

377
00:27:24,826 --> 00:27:25,850
Ready.

378
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:27,417
Mr. Ladislaus Ladi, the Barkleys.

379
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:31,431
Mr. Barkley, Mrs. Barkley,
this is a great pleasure.

380
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,501
I've never met you,
but now that I see you...

381
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,538
I realize how perfectly I've captured you.

382
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:40,631
I hope you will admire my crude efforts.

383
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:46,711
I'm sorry to be so stupid...

384
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:50,576
but why am I a pancake?

385
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:54,119
As I see you, you are creative union.

386
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:57,151
You, creative frying pan...

387
00:27:57,292 --> 00:28:00,819
in which the shapeless, raw batter, you...

388
00:28:01,296 --> 00:28:04,629
are transformed by creative miracle...

389
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,698
into irresistible pancake.

390
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:11,031
It is Pygmalion breathing life on Galatea...

391
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:13,830
or like, who's that fellow...

392
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:15,500
- With the beard?
- Yeah.

393
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:17,243
- Svengali.
- Yeah!

394
00:28:17,312 --> 00:28:19,610
- Yes.
- Only impression, of course.

395
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:21,842
Naturally, it's only an impression.

396
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,578
I am very grateful for the explanation.

397
00:28:24,853 --> 00:28:27,788
If you'll forgive me, I'll go now.

398
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:29,046
Goodbye.

399
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,783
What's the matter, honey?

400
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,021
Did you hear what he said? Svengali.

401
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:38,261
If that's what everybody thinks,
there must be something to it.

402
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:41,825
- After all, these are just total strangers...
- Darling! How divine.

403
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:44,736
We've come all the way from the country
to see your portrait.

404
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,933
- Well, it's...
- You remember <i>Monsieur</i> Barredout?

405
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:48,976
- Hello.
- Mrs. Barkley, Mr. Barkley.

406
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:50,601
How are you? We were just leaving.

407
00:28:50,678 --> 00:28:53,670
Oh, wait a moment.
I'm perishing for the sight of your portrait.

408
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:55,079
I hear it's brilliant.

409
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,879
- It's right up there.
- Well, come along.

410
00:28:56,951 --> 00:28:59,010
I'm sure it's perfectly dreadful.

411
00:28:59,087 --> 00:29:02,523
Ladi's nothing better
than a tenth-rate surrealist.

412
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:05,055
I'm so glad to hear you say that.

413
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:09,427
You know, for a minute I was just
a little afraid he might make sense.

414
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:12,932
I very much doubt
that he could possibly capture you.

415
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:16,533
I guess we'd better hurry.
Gotta put on the old feedbag.

416
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:20,597
Wait, you impulsive children.
Always scurrying.

417
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:24,577
I can never pin you down.
I want you for next Sunday in the country.

418
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:27,410
It's for Jacques. He's finished his play.

419
00:29:27,715 --> 00:29:30,013
- How nice! Congratulations.
- Thank you.

420
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:34,414
Well, we'd like... I think it's all...
I don't... Josh.

421
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:36,320
Josh, where are you?

422
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:40,088
You must come.
We'll all sit around an open fire...

423
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:41,822
and roast a few old chestnuts.

424
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:44,660
And then possibly later,
we can roast my play.

425
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:46,733
Please try to come.

426
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,066
Well, we'll see.

427
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:54,206
Oh, no! I don't believe we could, because,
you see...

428
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:55,936
we have tickets for the symphony.

429
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,672
Yes, I'm terribly sorry, Millie.
Josh, we really must go.

430
00:29:58,746 --> 00:30:01,146
- It's nice to have seen you.
- There's no symphony...

431
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,484
- Why didn't you help me out?
- I didn't think you wanted me to.

432
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,576
You didn't want to go.

433
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:06,642
- Do you?
- No.

434
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:10,316
Then why the hesitation? All you have
to say is, "I'm sorry, can't make it."

435
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,791
You acted as flustered
as a schoolgirl at a prom.

436
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:14,192
You flustered me.

437
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,364
What kind of talk is that?
"Gotta go put on the old feedbag."

438
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:20,458
That fellow brings out the gangster in me.
Stick to the subject.

439
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:22,867
- lf you want to go, go!
- I don't want to go.

440
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:25,770
But if you want to go,
I'm not going to try to hold you back.

441
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,503
I wish we'd never gone to that exhibition,
then this wouldn't have come up.

442
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,944
Dinah, every time you've come in contact
with that fellow Barredout...

443
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:35,505
you've been affected
in a very peculiar manner.

444
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,450
"Every time"? I've only met the man twice.

445
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,920
He's got some kind of strange hold on you.

446
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:43,651
Look, let's get the cast
of characters straight.

447
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:46,717
You're Svengali, remember?
How many do I need?

448
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,698
- Excuse me. I should have knocked.
- Yes, you should have.

449
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:55,361
Well, now that I'm inside,
apologies and all that.

450
00:30:56,204 --> 00:30:58,832
I wanted to ask you
about that makeup base you use.

451
00:30:58,907 --> 00:31:00,875
- Please don't. I'm fixing my eyes.
- I'm sorry.

452
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,536
In case I ever do go on,
I'd like to look like you.

453
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,171
- It's Number four.
- Is it really?

454
00:31:06,314 --> 00:31:08,874
Well, it looks wonderful on you.

455
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:14,211
That's funny. I tried it once, you know,
and it just looked awful on me.

456
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,223
I thought maybe I was allergic
or something.

457
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,759
I took it back to the store
and the girl there said:

458
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:21,260
"Well, it's all right
for a different type of skin."

459
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:24,423
Mine's much too delicate.
Now, isn't that ridiculous?

460
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:28,659
Yes, as a kid they used to call me
"Old Elephant-hide."

461
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:31,196
- I didn't mean...
- Shirley.

462
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:34,173
- It's Shirlene, dear.
- Do you mind? We haven't much time.

463
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:36,142
Of course not. Pardon the intrusion.

464
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,338
It's just that I'm so willing to learn,
Mr. Barkley...

465
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:42,881
Well, I'll be watching you. Bye.

473
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,870

<i>Was my highland fling</i>

<i>No chance was I chancin'</i>

477

<i>I'm not the man you dangle on a string</i>

478
00:33:00,028 --> 00:33:03,020

<i>For the real, real thing</i>

480
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:12,102

481
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:15,973
<i>Na ' one would do</i>

482
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:20,845

490
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:56,149
<i>I thought you were falling</i>
<i>for Andy MacPherson</i>

491
00:33:56,217 --> 00:33:58,845
<i>Nay, nay, he became an impossible person</i>

492
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:02,179
<i>But what about you</i>
<i>and that Connie Mackenzie?</i>

493
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:04,952
<i>She talked when I putted</i>

494
00:34:05,093 --> 00:34:07,687
<i>But what of the lad</i>
<i>known as Bobby MacDougal?</i>

495
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:10,993
<i>It pays to be thrifty, but he was too frugal</i>

496
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:13,932
<i>And weren't you daft</i>

<i>Every lackly laddie was</i>

<i>My highland fling</i>

00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:56,169
<i>No glance I was glancing</i>

509
00:34:56,244 --> 00:35:00,112
<i>Well, nothing really worth a-mentioning</i>

510

<i>For the real, real thing</i>

<i>In a fling I was flung with you</i>

<i>The years I'll weather</i>

<i>In the hame or on the heather</i>

<i>With me one and only highland fling</i>

521
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,567
Are you all right, Mrs. Barkley?

522
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:46,012
Yes, I'm all right.

523
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,912
This may sound
like awful prima donna stuff...

524
00:37:49,984 --> 00:37:51,508
but I can't stand that girl.

525
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:53,883
Now, it isn't as bad as all that, is it?

526
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:55,889
Yes, it is. She gives me the heebie-jeebies.

527
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:58,482
Every time I turn around,
there she is staring at me.

528
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:00,322
Now, don't get jumpy about her, honey.

529
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:04,057
I'll rehearse her in the afternoons
and keep her out of the wings, all right?

530
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:08,864
If you don't get jumpy
whenever I see that silly Barredout man.

531
00:38:08,936 --> 00:38:12,633
No, I won't. The next time I see him
I'll go out of my way to be nice to him.

532
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,696
That's better.

533
00:38:13,774 --> 00:38:15,503
- You know something?
- What?

534
00:38:15,943 --> 00:38:18,503
I think you and I could use
a little relaxation...

535
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:20,706
sort of a Sunday in the country
or something.

536
00:38:20,781 --> 00:38:23,807
We'll go to Millie's, and I promise you
when I see Barredout...

537
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,216
I'll treat him like a long-lost cousin.

538
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:28,346
- That's my baby.
- Yeah.

539
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,557
Ezra, get a whiff of that fresh air.

540
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:39,360
Can I go home now?

541
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,167
- Hello, there.
- Hello.

542
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,396
- Let me take those bags, sir.
- Yeah.

543
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:46,664
- How far is the house from here?
- About half a mile, madam.

544
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,265
- Let's walk.
- No!

545
00:38:48,342 --> 00:38:50,003
- Come on.
- Say, that's a great idea.

546
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,068
It'll put the color back in those cheeks.

547
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:54,876
They're my favorite color now.
A nice healthy green.

548
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:56,780
- Go ahead, driver.
- Yes, sir.

549
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:03,216
- We turn right at the fork, don't we?
- Yes, sir. Then left at Pinetop Road.

550
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,315
Fine. Now I remember. Thank you.

00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:07,706
Oh, yes, Pamela Driscoll.
I can just see the play.

602
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,333
A well-dressed, brittle affair?

603
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:13,176
Not at all. My play is a character study
of a great actress, Sarah Bernhardt.

604
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:16,614
It deals with her early years,
so I call it <i>The Young Sarah.</i>

605
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:18,879
It takes a great actress
to play a great actress.

606
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,477
You're absolutely right, Millar.

607
00:42:20,554 --> 00:42:22,818
Pardon me. Gloria, this is Mr. Barredout.

608
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,050
How do you do?

609
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,921
- Jacques, darling!
- Hello, Pamela.

610
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:27,358
Hello, Ezra. Hello, Gloria.

611
00:42:27,428 --> 00:42:30,454
Can you imagine
me playing Sarah Bernhardt?

612
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:32,225
I'm working on it.

613
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,561
Nothing.

614
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:36,898
Jacques, I've memorized the first scene.
I'd like to do it for you.

615
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,496
I've got such ideas about the part.

616
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:43,640
For my entrance, I'm going to wear
a sumptuous black velvet suit.

617
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:45,372
Period, of course, you understand...

618
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:48,506
Pamela, remember,
it's not clothes that will make this part.

619
00:42:48,582 --> 00:42:49,742
I know, darling, I know.

620
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:53,810
Young Sarah must have sincerity
and sensitivity.

621
00:42:54,388 --> 00:42:55,912
And she will.

622
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,424
Now come on in the library
and let me read for you.

623
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:01,859
- I'll join you in a minute.
- Good. I'll get the script.

624
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:05,926
- You know what I like about you, Gloria?
- What?

625
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,492
You're free of the slavery of talent.
Your play.

626
00:43:09,603 --> 00:43:11,002
Hello, there.

627
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,161
Hello.

628
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,970
Hello, Jacques! How are you, boy?
Glad to see you.

629
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:18,170
I hope you've had enough
of this good clean fun.

630
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:21,146
Why don't we all go inside
and take a sleeping pill?

631
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:24,648
- Beg your pardon.
- I beg your pardon. My fault.

632
00:43:24,718 --> 00:43:26,015
Not at all.

633
00:43:26,086 --> 00:43:28,145
Ez, you promised
to play a little golf with me.

634
00:43:28,222 --> 00:43:30,156
I feel just dire.
I was hoping you'd forget it.

635
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:31,486
- Honey, do you mind?
- What?

636
00:43:31,558 --> 00:43:35,187
- We're going to play a little golf.
- Not at all. I'll go shower and change...

637
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:37,127
and meet you on the ninth green
in an hour.

638
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,221
- Fine.
- Okay.

639
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:39,596
I'll be waiting. Come on.

640
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:42,659
- You can come along, Gloria.
- You going to teach me to play golf?

641
00:43:42,736 --> 00:43:46,695
If you're good, you can wear a sumptuous
black gown and play the best part: caddy.

642
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:48,674
Oh, caddy, that's cute.

643
00:44:15,636 --> 00:44:17,797
Here it is. I was looking for it.

644
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:21,034
Yes, I found it right here
in the middle of the floor.

645
00:44:21,108 --> 00:44:24,271
Pamela must have left it.
She was a trifle upset.

646
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:26,572
Yes, I noticed something was wrong.

647
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:29,138
Is she going to be in it?

648
00:44:30,651 --> 00:44:33,916
- What part is she going to play?
- Sarah.

649
00:44:33,987 --> 00:44:36,285
- Sarah?
- I know just what you're going to tell me.

650
00:44:36,357 --> 00:44:38,382
She's a dreadful choice for the part.

651
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:39,824
It's unanimous.

652
00:44:39,893 --> 00:44:42,327
I just finished telling her myself.

653
00:44:42,396 --> 00:44:47,197
- Well, then why is she going to be in it?
- I promised it to her, unfortunately.

654
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:51,162
I can't understand
an author like you doing such a thing.

655
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:55,341
Here you take what might be
a great piece of theater and deliberately...

656
00:44:55,409 --> 00:44:59,436
ruin it by giving it to someone
you know isn't right for the part at all.

657
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,378
I know it's none of my business,
and I'm very sorry for...

658
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,384
Oh, no, please.
I'm very upset about all this.

659
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:09,081
I'd like to discuss it more with you.

660
00:45:09,223 --> 00:45:10,656
I'd love to.

661
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:14,289
And maybe I could, sometime,
but I've got to go meet my husband...

662
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:16,989
They won't be at the ninth green
for at least a half hour.

663
00:45:17,064 --> 00:45:18,793
Please come and sit down.

664
00:45:25,038 --> 00:45:26,505
Go ahead, Ez.

665
00:45:26,907 --> 00:45:29,205
I don't know why playing caddy
is the best part.

666
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:30,937
I never get to hit the ball.

667
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:33,309
Stop complaining. Neither do I.

668
00:45:35,616 --> 00:45:37,777
- Nice try.
- All right. That's good.

669
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:40,146
Well, I'm sorry, putt it out.

670
00:45:40,354 --> 00:45:41,480
Putt it out?

671
00:45:41,555 --> 00:45:43,489
Why not? It's the philosophy of the game.

672
00:45:43,557 --> 00:45:46,390
It's a kick away.
You're not going to make me putt that?

673
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,624
What's the matter? Jangled nerves?
Let's see you do it. It's simple.

674
00:45:50,697 --> 00:45:53,291
I'm giving this fellow
three strokes a hole handicap...

675
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:57,167
and he's making me putt one-inch putts.
Look out, will you? Step back.

676
00:45:58,205 --> 00:45:59,502
Oh, well.

677
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:02,805
Nice try. You better stick to your dancing.

678
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:04,468
- Putt it out.
- Oh, now look...

679
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:05,978
- Come on.
- All right.

680
00:46:06,046 --> 00:46:07,570
Lets go back to the house.

681
00:46:07,648 --> 00:46:11,084
No, Dinah's going to meet us.
She'll be here any minute.

682
00:46:11,418 --> 00:46:13,443
That is the end of Act Two.

683
00:46:14,988 --> 00:46:18,822
Oh, it's thrilling. Perfectly thrilling.

684
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:23,491
I'm convinced that you must wait until
you have the right actress for the part.

685
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,494
Yes. But who?

686
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,428
Well, I don't know offhand.

687
00:46:31,004 --> 00:46:33,302
Certainly, you must have
someone in mind.

688
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,362
Yes.

689
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:36,367
Who?

690
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,602
You.

691
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:49,478
That's the most wonderful thing
that anyone has ever said to me.

692
00:46:50,657 --> 00:46:52,215
Just think.

693
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,906
Look at the rain on the fields.

694
00:47:11,111 --> 00:47:14,603
Every living thing is lifting its thirsty face.

695
00:47:15,115 --> 00:47:17,276
She said she'd meet me here.

696
00:47:17,351 --> 00:47:20,650
Be reasonable, Josh. Love will find a way.

697
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:23,585
I'm soaking wet. It's raining.

698
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:27,353
Nonsense. Just a few million
scattered drops that got together.

699
00:47:27,461 --> 00:47:30,055
Wait till I get my hands on her!

700
00:47:30,297 --> 00:47:33,130
- Why wait? Let's go now.
- Let's go.

701
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,030
Well, it's about time.

702
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,433
- Okay.
- Come on.

703
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:38,528
Last one in is a rotten egg!

704
00:47:38,705 --> 00:47:42,300
Dinah, I am not going to do the play
with anyone else but you.

705
00:47:42,376 --> 00:47:43,673
You're mad.

706
00:47:43,744 --> 00:47:46,611
But haven't you ever felt the need
to prove yourself...

707
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,377
to lift yourself to heights no one
ever dreamed you were capable of?

708
00:47:51,218 --> 00:47:55,211
It's out of the question.
I'm perfectly contented.

709
00:47:55,856 --> 00:47:59,724
And besides, I love my husband
and I love working with him...

710
00:47:59,826 --> 00:48:03,626
and a step like this would mean
the breaking up of our career together.

711
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:06,598
Of course. The whole idea was stupid.

712
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:09,192
We won't speak of it again. Ever.

713
00:48:17,377 --> 00:48:21,006
Do you think
I really could play Sarah Bernhardt?

714
00:48:21,114 --> 00:48:22,308
I knew it.

715
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:24,676
- You do want to do this.
- Oh, no!

716
00:48:24,751 --> 00:48:27,117
Dinah, I'll wait a year,
until your show closes.

717
00:48:27,187 --> 00:48:28,654
Just say you'll do it.

718
00:48:28,722 --> 00:48:31,589
No. I'm fine for musical comedy.

719
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:34,149
That's what I'm suited for...

720
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:38,320
but no one would believe me
in a serious part.

721
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:40,229
Of course they would.

722
00:48:41,735 --> 00:48:45,603
I think you're going to have
a quick chance to prove it. Look.

723
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:53,672
That's my husband!

724
00:48:53,747 --> 00:48:56,238
- And it's raining! What'll I do?
- Act.

725
00:48:56,316 --> 00:48:59,945
Act? No. I'll hide!
That's what I'll do. How's this?

726
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,250
- That's much too obvious.
- What'll I do?

727
00:49:02,322 --> 00:49:06,315
- Improvise.
- Improvise? I'm terribly faint.

728
00:49:06,393 --> 00:49:07,690
I feel sick.

729
00:49:07,761 --> 00:49:09,058
Oh, I feel terribly sick.

730
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:10,460
You look terribly healthy.

731
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,657
I do? That's no good.
I'll take my makeup off.

732
00:49:12,733 --> 00:49:15,031
You'd better hurry, whatever you do.
They're coming.

733
00:49:15,102 --> 00:49:18,037
Oh, no! Say, now you've got to hide.

734
00:49:18,105 --> 00:49:20,005
Well, good luck, Camille.

735
00:49:20,073 --> 00:49:21,506
Dinah?

736
00:49:24,344 --> 00:49:28,747
Don't you wave at me. What's the idea
of standing me up in a hurricane?

737
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,946
Josh. I thought you'd never get here.

738
00:49:35,022 --> 00:49:37,252
- Never get here? What...
- Take it easy, Josh.

739
00:49:37,324 --> 00:49:41,158
- I think she might really be sick.
- Sick? What's the matter, darling?

740
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,059
Oh, it's nothing.

741
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:46,429
- It's just that I've been terribly faint.
- Ezra, get something.

742
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,730
- What?
- Get something. Brandy.

743
00:49:48,835 --> 00:49:50,769
Darling, what happened?

744
00:49:51,605 --> 00:49:55,735
I don't know.
I was coming down to meet you...

745
00:49:57,377 --> 00:49:59,868
and suddenly I felt very strange.

746
00:50:00,213 --> 00:50:03,046
Everything started to go round and round.

747
00:50:04,217 --> 00:50:07,015
I came in here to rest for a minute...

748
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,782
and I must have fainted.

749
00:50:08,855 --> 00:50:11,449
I'll never forgive myself
for thinking what I did.

750
00:50:11,525 --> 00:50:13,288
Oh, Josh, you sound so far away.

751
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,760
I'm right here, darling. I'm right here.

752
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:18,855
I felt so cold and suddenly so hot...

753
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,763
and dizzy.

754
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:23,496
Josh, I've never felt like this ever before.

755
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:25,060
You've never felt like this before?

756
00:50:25,138 --> 00:50:28,130
Sweet, honey, baby, you mean...
It's wonderful!

757
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:29,197
- What?
- Ez!

758
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,938
No, it's not that. Definitely.

759
00:50:32,012 --> 00:50:35,675
It's just that I've had too much tennis
or too much sun or...

760
00:50:35,749 --> 00:50:37,182
I want to go home.

761
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,083
- We will go home. Just...
- Here, take a sip of this.

762
00:50:40,153 --> 00:50:41,620
- No, I'm too weak.
- It's cognac.

763
00:50:41,688 --> 00:50:43,178
- It's brandy.
- I'm too weak.

764
00:50:43,256 --> 00:50:46,020
Maybe we'd better get Shirlene ready
for tomorrow night.

765
00:50:46,093 --> 00:50:48,960
Oh, no. I'll be all right.

766
00:50:49,029 --> 00:50:50,929
- Help me, Josh.
- You're all right now.

767
00:50:50,997 --> 00:50:52,862
We'll go home and everything will be fine.

768
00:50:52,933 --> 00:50:55,766
All you have to do is just leave it to me.

769
00:50:57,738 --> 00:51:00,707
"Sarah, flustered,
steals last look at her book and gets up.

770
00:51:00,774 --> 00:51:03,800
"The judges:
'What will you recite, <i>Mademoiselle? '</i>

771
00:51:03,877 --> 00:51:07,369
"Sarah, nervously:
'The potion scene from <i>Romeo and Juliet. '</i>

772
00:51:07,447 --> 00:51:10,314
"She pauses. Judge: 'Very well, begin."'

773
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:13,882
- Hello, honey.
- Hello, darling.

774
00:51:15,522 --> 00:51:17,251
- Miss me?
- Well, of course.

775
00:51:17,357 --> 00:51:19,120
You've almost been gone a half an hour.

776
00:51:19,192 --> 00:51:20,989
What happened,
no rehearsal with Shirlene?

777
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:24,360
I called it off. We're having
pictures taken for <i>Look</i> magazine today.

778
00:51:24,431 --> 00:51:27,400
Oh, my dear, I forgot all about it.
I must change.

779
00:51:27,467 --> 00:51:31,233
That's just the way they want to see you.
The beautiful Mrs. Barkley at home.

780
00:51:31,304 --> 00:51:34,467
Come on, a little service, please?
You're slipping.

781
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:37,738
I'm terribly sorry. I have the lighter
in my pocket, but I can't...

782
00:51:37,811 --> 00:51:40,712
Well, all you have to do
is take this pillow off...

783
00:51:41,982 --> 00:51:45,008
- Now, Josh, now...
- Hold it. Don't move. That's perfect!

784
00:51:45,085 --> 00:51:48,350
What did I tell you? Is this going
to be a picture story or isn't it?

785
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:50,753
- Hello, Larry.
- This is Mr. Perkins...

786
00:51:50,824 --> 00:51:53,384
Mr. Clarke, Mr. Leggett,
and Mr. Taylor of <i>Look</i> magazine.

787
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,860
Nice to see you.
Darling, he just wanted my opinion.

788
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:57,760
Perkins, it's your show. Take over.

789
00:51:57,831 --> 00:52:00,026
We'd like to get the whole day.
You know, maybe...

790
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,898
Starting with breakfast.
We have it all set up on the terrace.

791
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:05,335
Just come along. Follow me.
Darling, come on.

792
00:52:05,405 --> 00:52:06,804
I've got orange juice.

793
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,068
Good light, too, I think, don't you?

794
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:15,808
"Your dying scene in the country
equaled Bernhardt's in <i>Camille.</i>

795
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,214
"Read Act Three. I'll be waiting."

796
00:52:18,285 --> 00:52:22,085
- Darling, will you please come...
- "Dying scene in the country"?

797
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:23,887
Oh, I see.

798
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:27,226
Well, we have everything picked
for the pictures.

799
00:52:27,427 --> 00:52:30,590
Well, my poor sick little bride.
Let me help you.

800
00:52:30,664 --> 00:52:32,757
Looks like one of the best setups
we've had.

801
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:35,165
Well, that was a performance.

802
00:52:35,368 --> 00:52:37,199
It had me fooled completely.

803
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:39,734
Josh, not now. Sit down, darling.

804
00:52:39,806 --> 00:52:41,467
What's going on between you two?

805
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:44,738
Please hold on before we say
something we'll be sorry for later.

806
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:46,676
- All ready for the picture?
- Yes.

807
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,805
Lovely couple
cooing over the breakfast table.

808
00:52:48,882 --> 00:52:51,077
Shut up! He's been after you, hasn't he?

809
00:52:51,151 --> 00:52:54,120
I wouldn't be surprised
if he asked you to play Sarah Bernhardt.

810
00:52:54,187 --> 00:52:56,951
- Could we get the picture, please?
- By all means.

811
00:52:57,023 --> 00:53:00,015
Pick up the coffee cup.
You know, like you're having breakfast?

812
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,924
Yes. I'm terribly...

813
00:53:01,995 --> 00:53:04,463
Now, smile, kiddies, smile. That's it.

814
00:53:05,298 --> 00:53:07,994
He's a pretty smooth article.
Knew just how to work on you.

815
00:53:08,068 --> 00:53:09,296
What're you talking about?

816
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:12,236
You don't think he'd let you
play Sarah Bernhardt, do you?

817
00:53:12,305 --> 00:53:14,796
- Even you couldn't be that dumb.
- Well, now...

818
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,502
Would you feed him a strawberry?

819
00:53:16,576 --> 00:53:18,635
A strawberry. Certainly.

820
00:53:18,879 --> 00:53:21,712
He says he won't even do the show
unless I play the part.

821
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,009
Hold it.

822
00:53:24,217 --> 00:53:27,448
- He thinks I'm a great actress.
- Don't make me laugh.

823
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,750
That's fine.
Now can we go in the living room?

824
00:53:29,823 --> 00:53:32,815
Yes. Please go ahead and help yourself,
and we'll be right in...

825
00:53:32,893 --> 00:53:34,417
in just a moment.

826
00:53:35,061 --> 00:53:36,551
He believes in me.

827
00:53:36,897 --> 00:53:38,888
He gives me confidence in myself.

828
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:42,332
All you've ever done is tear me down,
make me feel like a nobody.

829
00:53:42,402 --> 00:53:43,994
Your little sidekick.

830
00:53:44,404 --> 00:53:46,964
Can't even walk across the stage
without you.

831
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:49,398
- Can't even make a gesture.
- Correct.

832
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,944
- Big fat Svengali.
- You're darn tooting.

833
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:53,604
Well, I've had enough!

834
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,679
That goes double.

835
00:53:55,749 --> 00:53:59,310
I'm sick and tired of your lies,
your deceits, your tricks.

836
00:53:59,386 --> 00:54:01,650
You're nothing
but an inconsiderate, selfish...

837
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:03,188
What are you doing here?

838
00:54:03,256 --> 00:54:05,952
We were waiting to rehearse,
so I brought Shirlene along.

839
00:54:06,026 --> 00:54:08,085
Shirlene, there's a girl with talent.

840
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,459
She knows your part
better than you do right now.

841
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,998
I could put her on tonight
and she'd be a sensation.

842
00:54:13,066 --> 00:54:14,124
- Gee, thanks.
- Shut up!

843
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,395
Simmer down, take it easy.

844
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:18,164
That's all right. Happens all the time.

845
00:54:18,238 --> 00:54:20,468
All calmed down, Dinah?
Now, why don't we get...

846
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:23,839
Why don't you take a picture of me
walking out of the house for good?

847
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:26,572
Dinah! Josh, do something. Stop her.

848
00:54:26,646 --> 00:54:29,740
- This time I think she means it.
- So do I.

849
00:54:29,816 --> 00:54:32,808
As for Shirlene, you have
my permission to put her on tonight...

850
00:54:32,886 --> 00:54:34,649
because I won't be there.

851
00:54:34,988 --> 00:54:36,285
What am I going to do?

852
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,881
We've got this picture spread
set up for <i>Look</i> magazine.

853
00:54:38,959 --> 00:54:40,688
What am I going to tell them?

854
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,196
Tell them you can fill in with eight pages
of an appendix operation in color.

855
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,395
<i>When I've got shoes with wings on</i>

856
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,574
<i>The winter's gone, the spring's on</i>

857
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,871
<i>When I've got shoes with wings on</i>

858
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,313
<i>The town's full of rhythm</i>
<i>and the world's in rhyme</i>

859
00:58:23,716 --> 00:58:26,276
<i>The neon city glows up</i>

860
00:58:26,886 --> 00:58:29,320
<i>My pretty, pretty shows up</i>

861
00:58:30,156 --> 00:58:32,647
<i>We'll dance until they close up</i>

862
00:58:33,326 --> 00:58:36,090
<i>I've got my guardian angel</i>
<i>working overtime</i>

863
00:58:36,162 --> 00:58:39,859
<i>I give Aladdin the lamp, Midas the gold</i>

864
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,094
<i>Who needs a wizard or magician</i>

865
00:58:42,168 --> 00:58:43,795
<i>In the old tradition?</i>

866
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:45,599
<i>That's not competition</i>

867
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,639
<i>I've got 'em beat a thousand fold</i>

868
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:49,697
<i>Why?</i>

869
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,142
<i>'Cause I've got shoes with wings on</i>

870
00:58:52,645 --> 00:58:55,239
<i>And living has no strings on</i>

871
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,816
<i>I put those magic things on</i>

872
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,877
<i>And I go flying with 'em</i>

873
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,444
<i>And the town is full of rhythm</i>

874
00:59:02,522 --> 00:59:05,320
<i>And the world in rhyme</i>

875
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:40,965
We'll do the entire scene again.
Better take it from your entrance, Dinah.

876
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,371
From my entrance.

877
01:02:43,376 --> 01:02:45,606
- Dinah, darling.
- Yes?

878
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:50,106
I should think that after two weeks, you
would try to do this without the script.

879
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:53,277
Well, I know it.
It's just that I like to hold on to it.

880
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:56,788
You mustn't get to rely on it.
You won't have it with you opening night.

881
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:58,687
All right. Here we go.

882
01:02:58,758 --> 01:03:00,555
Excuse me a minute, Jacques.

883
01:03:01,494 --> 01:03:03,553
What do you mean
by snooping around here?

884
01:03:03,629 --> 01:03:04,653
Hiya, Dinah.

885
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:08,427
If you're here for news of the enemy camp,
I'd like to say that I'm happy.

886
01:03:08,501 --> 01:03:12,164
I love the play, and I think that...
You may tell Josh in particular...

887
01:03:12,238 --> 01:03:15,230
I think Jacques is the best director
I have ever worked with.

888
01:03:15,308 --> 01:03:16,707
That's a beautiful suit...

889
01:03:16,776 --> 01:03:19,677
If you're here to play Cupid,
you can put away your arrows.

890
01:03:19,745 --> 01:03:20,769
It won't do you any good.

891
01:03:20,847 --> 01:03:23,281
Listen, you and I never had a fight,
remember?

892
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:26,113
I'm sorry. You can't barge in,
in the middle of a rehearsal.

893
01:03:26,185 --> 01:03:29,382
I'm trying to concentrate and...
All right. What is it?

894
01:03:29,655 --> 01:03:32,886
I came to ask you about doing
that big benefit at Symphony Hall.

895
01:03:32,959 --> 01:03:35,553
You know, the one we do every year
for the hospital.

896
01:03:35,628 --> 01:03:37,220
No, not this year.

897
01:03:37,296 --> 01:03:40,788
If you think you can get Josh and me
on the stage together, you're crazy.

898
01:03:40,867 --> 01:03:43,233
- Dinah!
- I'll be right there in a second.

899
01:03:43,302 --> 01:03:47,068
I'd like to see one of the Barkleys
represented. Josh won't be there.

900
01:03:47,507 --> 01:03:51,443
He turned it down. He said he's too busy.
He has a big party that night.

901
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:55,043
Isn't that just like him?
Too busy to do a benefit.

902
01:03:55,114 --> 01:03:56,445
Has to go to a party.

903
01:03:56,516 --> 01:03:58,711
- You can count on me, Ezra, I'll be there.
- Dinah!

904
01:03:58,784 --> 01:04:00,376
Bye. Yes, Jacques, I'm terribly sorry.

905
01:04:01,621 --> 01:04:04,590
You're not superstitious
about one on a match, are you?

906
01:04:04,657 --> 01:04:08,286
If you think you can get Dinah and me
to perform at that benefit together...

907
01:04:08,361 --> 01:04:09,760
you're just crazy.

908
01:04:09,829 --> 01:04:12,354
I'd like one of the Barkleys there.
Dinah can't make it.

909
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:13,420
Why not?

910
01:04:13,499 --> 01:04:15,399
She's got a rehearsal that night.

911
01:04:15,468 --> 01:04:17,095
Now, isn't that just like her?

912
01:04:17,169 --> 01:04:19,433
All wrapped up in that big dramatic career.

913
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:22,633
Can't take a half hour off to do
one number for a worthy cause.

914
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:24,608
You can count on me, Ez, I'll be there.

915
01:04:24,677 --> 01:04:27,077
Good. I'll see you at dinner.

916
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,680
- Wait a minute.
- Yeah, what's the matter?

917
01:04:30,349 --> 01:04:32,249
You saw her today?

918
01:04:32,652 --> 01:04:34,142
Yep, I saw her.

919
01:04:34,353 --> 01:04:36,287
- Where?
- At her rehearsal.

920
01:04:37,023 --> 01:04:39,287
How is the great tragic actress
getting along?

921
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:41,189
Okay. She appeared a little nervous.

922
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,228
Seemed to flounder around,
unsure of herself.

923
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,456
You know something?

924
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:46,760
She's going to take a header
right on her face.

925
01:04:46,832 --> 01:04:49,960
And you know something else?
I'm going to let her lie there.

926
01:04:50,036 --> 01:04:53,130
That's the spirit.
Who says the age of chivalry is dead?

927
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:56,770
Joshie, I'm all ready, honey.

928
01:04:56,842 --> 01:04:58,639
Shirlene, you better run along.

929
01:04:58,711 --> 01:05:00,941
I've got some business
before the show tonight.

930
01:05:01,013 --> 01:05:02,139
I'm sorry.

931
01:05:02,214 --> 01:05:04,682
- Well, I'll see you back here then?
- Yeah.

932
01:05:05,351 --> 01:05:07,114
I'll be awful lonely.

933
01:05:07,253 --> 01:05:08,720
You'll get over it.

934
01:05:10,056 --> 01:05:13,583
You know,
I find that girl completely resistible.

935
01:05:38,718 --> 01:05:42,313
All right, we'll take it again
from the same spot. Places, please.

936
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:46,324
All right, go.

937
01:05:47,827 --> 01:05:48,885
Mother, l...

938
01:05:48,961 --> 01:05:52,954
No, Dinah. I'm afraid you're forgetting
all the action we've set for this.

939
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:55,590
You come in, pause for three counts
in the doorway...

940
01:05:55,668 --> 01:05:57,829
Iook at your mother,
look at the Duke de Morny...

941
01:05:57,903 --> 01:05:59,962
Iook at your aunt, walk to the window...

942
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:02,269
say the first half of your line,
turn and finish it.

943
01:06:02,341 --> 01:06:04,309
You've got it written down.
You must remember.

944
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:07,778
I do remember it.
It's the scene I worked on last night.

945
01:06:07,847 --> 01:06:09,109
Mother, I've made up my...

946
01:06:09,181 --> 01:06:11,376
No, darling, you just look at your mother.

947
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:13,213
That's right. I'm sorry.

948
01:06:18,024 --> 01:06:20,993
- Mother, I've made up my mind...
- No. Well, all right.

949
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:25,797
Just say your first line, and we'll
work on it in more detail tomorrow.

950
01:06:25,865 --> 01:06:27,628
- From here?
- From there.

951
01:06:27,867 --> 01:06:31,132
Mother, I've made up my mind.
I'm not going to the conservatory...

952
01:06:31,203 --> 01:06:33,603
But, darling, your mother is right here.

953
01:06:33,673 --> 01:06:37,507
She's not in the second balcony.
Speak to her in a more natural tone.

954
01:06:38,144 --> 01:06:41,045
This is not a musical comedy.
It's a legitimate play.

955
01:06:44,473 --> 01:06:46,703
Mother, I've made up my mind.
I'm not going to go to...

956
01:06:46,775 --> 01:06:50,074
I can't hear you at all now, Dinah,
so speak louder, please.

957
01:06:50,779 --> 01:06:53,247
Mother, I've made up my mind. I'm not...

958
01:06:53,949 --> 01:06:55,678
That's too loud, isn't it?

959
01:06:57,386 --> 01:06:58,683
I'm sorry.

960
01:06:59,521 --> 01:07:01,318
I don't know what's the matter with me.

961
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:04,291
I'm behaving
as if I've never been in a theater before.

962
01:07:04,359 --> 01:07:07,795
You mustn't be panicky, dear.
It's a new field. You'll get over it.

963
01:07:07,863 --> 01:07:09,660
Well, of course I'll get it.

964
01:07:09,731 --> 01:07:12,029
Well, that's all for today, anyway.
Thank you.

965
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,125
Wait for your calls, everyone.

966
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:18,768
10:00 tomorrow for Miss Elston,
Miss Gage, Miss Wilder, Mr. Henderson.

967
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:22,502
Hiya.

968
01:07:22,578 --> 01:07:24,842
Hey, you're late. This is Genevieve.

969
01:07:24,913 --> 01:07:26,278
- How do you do?
- Hello.

970
01:07:26,348 --> 01:07:29,283
Well, I just looked in
on the noble experiment.

971
01:07:29,351 --> 01:07:30,682
How's it coming?

972
01:07:31,019 --> 01:07:34,955
Not so good. Looks as if she's going
to make a complete fool of herself.

973
01:07:35,123 --> 01:07:37,148
Well, that's what you wanted, isn't it?

974
01:07:37,226 --> 01:07:38,818
Sure. She deserves it.

975
01:07:38,994 --> 01:07:41,622
She certainly does.
She's no dramatic actress.

976
01:07:41,897 --> 01:07:44,525
No? Listen, she can do anything, that girl.

977
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,291
- Yeah?
- She could be great in that part.

978
01:07:47,402 --> 01:07:48,528
Really?

979
01:07:48,604 --> 01:07:50,970
Barredout doesn't know how to direct her.

980
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,507
- He's sitting in the bar.
- What do I care?

981
01:07:54,042 --> 01:07:57,011
Listen, Ezra,
he doesn't understand her at all.

982
01:07:57,079 --> 01:07:59,172
He keeps tearing her down, confusing her.

983
01:07:59,248 --> 01:08:02,376
When she thinks she's not
getting something right, she's no good.

984
01:08:02,451 --> 01:08:05,420
You've got to approach her
in a different way and...

985
01:08:05,587 --> 01:08:07,487
Well, I know how to help her.

986
01:08:08,056 --> 01:08:10,388
- But you want her to flop.
- Sure.

987
01:08:11,093 --> 01:08:13,960
Besides, she wouldn't take
any suggestions from me.

988
01:08:14,997 --> 01:08:16,988
- Good evening, Mr. Barkley.
- Hello, Helen.

989
01:08:17,065 --> 01:08:19,431
Funny, I thought
Barredout was supposed to be good.

990
01:08:19,501 --> 01:08:21,560
Good? Did you ever see him work?

991
01:08:23,238 --> 01:08:24,637
"Dinah...

992
01:08:24,706 --> 01:08:27,038
"this is much different
from musical comedy.

993
01:08:27,109 --> 01:08:30,237
"It is a play, <i>mais oui.</i> A legitimate play."

994
01:08:31,647 --> 01:08:33,808
Say, that's a great imitation you do of him.

995
01:08:33,882 --> 01:08:35,406
- It is?
- Pretty good.

996
01:08:38,453 --> 01:08:39,613
It is?

997
01:08:39,755 --> 01:08:41,450
- Is that yours or mine?
- Mine.

998
01:08:41,523 --> 01:08:42,888
Want to split it?

999
01:08:45,627 --> 01:08:47,686
Excuse me a minute, will you?

1000
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,544
Hello.

1001
01:09:13,622 --> 01:09:15,920
Hello, Dinah? This is Jacques.

1002
01:09:16,358 --> 01:09:18,383
Hello, Jacques. I'm so glad it's you.

1003
01:09:19,461 --> 01:09:23,329
I was very anxious to know
how you feel after today's rehearsals.

1004
01:09:25,901 --> 01:09:29,132
Well,
it's not going along much better, is it?

1005
01:09:29,905 --> 01:09:33,363
I don't know, I get out there
and I feel absolutely lost.

1006
01:09:34,376 --> 01:09:35,900
<i>That is all my fault.</i>

1007
01:09:36,545 --> 01:09:37,603
Don't be silly.

1008
01:09:39,081 --> 01:09:41,948
Yes, it is.
My direction is completely to blame.

1009
01:09:43,885 --> 01:09:46,547
Jacques, your voice sounds so odd.

1010
01:09:47,589 --> 01:09:48,920
Have you been drinking?

1011
01:09:49,691 --> 01:09:52,251
No, it must be a bad connection.

1012
01:09:53,161 --> 01:09:55,994
Now listen, Dinah,
I want you to know that...

1013
01:09:56,431 --> 01:10:00,197
I was wrong in telling you
how different this is from musical comedy.

1014
01:10:00,369 --> 01:10:01,631
It is not different.

1015
01:10:02,771 --> 01:10:04,932
<i>It's wonderful to hear you say that.</i>

1016
01:10:05,607 --> 01:10:08,872
You're still a great performer
and a wonderful actress.

1017
01:10:09,678 --> 01:10:11,543
<i>In that scene with your family...</i>

1018
01:10:11,613 --> 01:10:15,208
<i>where you make your entrance,</i>
<i>you must walk in slowly.</i>

1019
01:10:15,851 --> 01:10:19,412
<i>You see, you must remember</i>
<i>that the keynote to your attitude is...</i>

1020
01:10:19,855 --> 01:10:21,880
<i>defiance toward your mother.</i>

1021
01:10:22,357 --> 01:10:25,087
Walking slowly. Defiant.

1022
01:10:26,161 --> 01:10:27,560
I resent her.

1023
01:10:27,763 --> 01:10:30,254
Why, of course, Jacques. That feels right.

1024
01:10:31,099 --> 01:10:34,068
And when the Duke comes toward you...

1025
01:10:34,269 --> 01:10:35,861
and offers you his hand...

1026
01:10:35,937 --> 01:10:37,427
you must pull away quickly.

1027
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:39,767
<i>You're very frightened.</i>

1028
01:10:40,142 --> 01:10:43,236
Yes, Jacques, I see. I'm afraid of him.

1029
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,906
Yes, I understand.
It's a matter of relationships.

1030
01:10:47,983 --> 01:10:50,577
It's not just a mechanical movement.

1031
01:10:51,053 --> 01:10:54,921
Jacques, let's start from the beginning
and go through the whole scene.

1032
01:10:55,057 --> 01:10:59,118
<i>Now, when your mother says, "Sarah..."</i>

1033
01:10:59,995 --> 01:11:02,395
The Duke de Morny has
secured an audition for you.

1034
01:11:02,464 --> 01:11:04,455
I don't want to be an actress.

1035
01:11:04,666 --> 01:11:06,634
You're to read for them next week.

1036
01:11:06,702 --> 01:11:09,830
- Well, Sarah...
- Why don't you leave the poor girl alone?

1037
01:11:10,138 --> 01:11:13,574
I'll wager Sarah has
never even seen an actress.

1038
01:11:14,443 --> 01:11:15,967
Oh, yes, I have.

1039
01:11:16,278 --> 01:11:18,508
It was at the convent last year.

1040
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:22,949
A sick lady came there and the sisters said
she used to be beautiful...

1041
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:27,415
but that she was going to die alone
and unloved because she'd led a bad life.

1042
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:32,255
She was pale and coughing, and her
eyes were big dark holes in her face.

1043
01:11:32,527 --> 01:11:34,051
And you know who she was?

1044
01:11:34,129 --> 01:11:36,620
She was the star
of the <i>Comdie Franaise.</i>

1045
01:11:36,698 --> 01:11:39,189
I won't be like that
and you can't make me!

1046
01:11:40,068 --> 01:11:42,969
Dinah, that's wonderful! Wonderful!

1047
01:11:43,138 --> 01:11:45,504
It was? Darling, I'm so glad.

1048
01:11:45,574 --> 01:11:47,599
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1049
01:11:47,676 --> 01:11:50,406
Your timing, your inflections were
just what I wanted.

1050
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:52,276
- I believed every word.
- Perfect.

1051
01:11:52,347 --> 01:11:54,247
Joan has come to life for the first time.

1052
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:58,208
- You seen any of the rehearsals lately?
- Dinah's? No.

1053
01:11:59,387 --> 01:12:02,515
- I wonder how it's coming along.
- I don't know.

1054
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:06,385
It couldn't be much worse
than it was when I saw it.

1055
01:12:06,928 --> 01:12:08,953
I forgot. I've got to make a telephone call.

1056
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,463
- Want another drink?
- No, thanks.

1057
01:12:10,532 --> 01:12:12,830
I'll have one. Would you like a drink?

1058
01:12:16,505 --> 01:12:17,529
Hello.

1059
01:12:18,173 --> 01:12:22,405
Hello, Dinah, I just called you to tell you
again how wonderful you were today.

1060
01:12:22,878 --> 01:12:25,005
I can't believe it. It's a miracle.

1061
01:12:26,114 --> 01:12:28,309
Yes? In Scene Two?

1062
01:12:29,985 --> 01:12:32,681
But I can't sit there
through the whole speech.

1063
01:12:35,223 --> 01:12:37,783
Yes, Jacques. Well, you're a genius.

1064
01:12:38,193 --> 01:12:41,162
Thank you, my dear.
Well, that is about all for now.

1065
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:43,063
Incidentally...

1066
01:12:43,365 --> 01:12:47,267
while we are in rehearsal,
I wish you wouldn't be so demonstrative.

1067
01:12:48,804 --> 01:12:50,032
So what?

1068
01:12:50,105 --> 01:12:52,198
- Demonstrative.
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

1069
01:12:53,775 --> 01:12:57,768
Well, throwing your arms about my neck
and kissing me in front of the company...

1070
01:12:57,846 --> 01:12:59,074
is most embarrassing.

1071
01:12:59,848 --> 01:13:02,339
<i>- We'll have none of that.</i>
- Why, Jacques...

1072
01:13:03,418 --> 01:13:04,680
Discipline, you know.

1073
01:13:06,988 --> 01:13:09,047
Well, I'm sorry.

1074
01:13:09,791 --> 01:13:13,921
I hope it won't be too compromising if you
take me to the benefit on Sunday night.

1075
01:13:15,497 --> 01:13:17,158
Benefit? What benefit?

1076
01:13:17,899 --> 01:13:19,890
The hospital... I told you.

1077
01:13:20,969 --> 01:13:23,164
Yes, I'll take you.

1078
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:25,501
Goodbye.

1079
01:13:30,645 --> 01:13:34,342
Hey, what's the idea of telling me
Dinah's not coming to the benefit?

1080
01:13:34,416 --> 01:13:37,408
- Is she?
- You know darned well she is. But I'm not.

1081
01:13:37,986 --> 01:13:40,216
You cooked up this little plot, now eat it.

1082
01:13:48,864 --> 01:13:52,061
Well, what happened, Ezra?
Are they both going to be here?

1083
01:13:52,133 --> 01:13:55,830
Dinah's here. I saw her. But that
pigheaded mule, I don't know if he'll come.

1084
01:13:55,904 --> 01:13:57,804
<i>Now presenting Ezra Millar playing...</i>

1085
01:13:57,873 --> 01:14:01,001
<i>Tchaikovsky's</i> Piano Concerto Number One
in B Flat Minor.

1086
01:14:01,977 --> 01:14:03,137
Goodbye.

1087
01:17:31,319 --> 01:17:33,014
What are you doing here?

1088
01:17:34,255 --> 01:17:36,815
What are you doing here? Ezra.

1089
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:41,585
Why, the double-crosser.

1090
01:17:45,633 --> 01:17:48,932
Don't you think the gallant thing
would be for you to leave?

1091
01:17:49,938 --> 01:17:51,565
I'm not going to leave.

1092
01:17:52,107 --> 01:17:53,597
This is a benefit.

1093
01:17:53,675 --> 01:17:55,939
They're expecting
a number from me out there.

1094
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:59,571
Why don't you leave?
This is beneath you now, anyway.

1095
01:18:00,782 --> 01:18:03,512
I have never walked out
on a benefit in my life.

1096
01:18:03,818 --> 01:18:06,286
And I'll not walk out
on all these hospital people.

1097
01:18:06,354 --> 01:18:10,051
It's for them. It makes no difference
to me whether you're here or not.

1098
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:11,615
I'll perform anyway.

1099
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:10,935
Thank you. I'm touched.

1100
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:13,667
The piano's touched
and Tchaikovsky's touched.

1101
01:21:14,242 --> 01:21:17,370
And now I have a surprise
which I'm sure will touch you.

1102
01:21:17,879 --> 01:21:21,007
In this corner,
one of the great stars of show business.

1103
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:25,815
And in the same corner,
another great star of show business.

1104
01:21:27,622 --> 01:21:31,114
Who will brilliantly oppose each other
in one of their greatest numbers.

1105
01:21:31,192 --> 01:21:32,819
Josh and Dinah Barkley.

1106
01:21:51,212 --> 01:21:54,443
<i>The way you wear your hat</i>

1107
01:21:57,085 --> 01:22:00,248
<i>The way you sip your tea</i>

1108
01:22:02,256 --> 01:22:05,487
<i>The memory of all that</i>

1109
01:22:07,428 --> 01:22:12,297
<i>No, no, they can't take that away from me</i>

1110
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:16,192
<i>The way your smile just beams</i>

1111
01:22:17,939 --> 01:22:21,102
<i>The way you sing off-key</i>

1112
01:22:23,044 --> 01:22:25,945
<i>The way you haunt my dreams</i>

1113
01:22:28,282 --> 01:22:33,413
<i>No, no</i>
<i>They can't take that away from me</i>

1114
01:22:35,056 --> 01:22:40,016
<i>We may never, never meet again</i>

1115
01:22:40,328 --> 01:22:44,094
<i>On the bumpy road to love</i>

1116
01:22:45,433 --> 01:22:49,369
<i>Still I'll always, always keep</i>

1117
01:22:49,437 --> 01:22:52,497
<i>The memory of</i>

1118
01:22:54,475 --> 01:22:57,911
<i>The way you hold your knife</i>

1119
01:22:59,814 --> 01:23:02,977
<i>The way we danced till three</i>

1120
01:23:05,052 --> 01:23:08,215
<i>The way you changed my life</i>

1121
01:23:10,224 --> 01:23:15,252
<i>No, no</i>
<i>They can't take that away from me</i>

1122
01:23:15,363 --> 01:23:21,063
<i>No, they can't take that away</i>

1123
01:23:21,602 --> 01:23:24,230
<i>From me</i>

1124
01:26:07,802 --> 01:26:09,565
Bravo!

1125
01:26:25,319 --> 01:26:27,981
- Thank you very much, Josh and Dinah.
- Thank you.

1126
01:26:28,189 --> 01:26:31,158
- It was so nice seeing you together again.
- Thank you very much.

1127
01:26:37,598 --> 01:26:38,997
Thank you.

1128
01:26:39,634 --> 01:26:42,933
- Dinah, that was wonderful.
- It was fun, wasn't it?

1129
01:26:44,038 --> 01:26:45,300
Look...

1130
01:26:46,707 --> 01:26:48,504
can't we be civilized about this...

1131
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:51,101
and maybe go someplace
and talk things over?

1132
01:26:51,979 --> 01:26:55,142
There's nothing to talk over, Josh.

1133
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:58,082
You're doing very well without me...

1134
01:26:58,886 --> 01:27:01,787
and I'm doing what I guess
I've always wanted to do.

1135
01:27:03,257 --> 01:27:06,192
In the long run,
we'll be much happier apart.

1136
01:27:07,194 --> 01:27:08,627
Don't you think so?

1137
01:27:10,097 --> 01:27:11,291
Do you?

1138
01:27:12,433 --> 01:27:13,798
Of course I do.

1139
01:27:15,469 --> 01:27:17,733
I can't believe you really mean that.

1140
01:27:18,873 --> 01:27:20,067
Look, Josh.

1141
01:27:20,141 --> 01:27:22,609
That wasn't just another squabble we had.

1142
01:27:22,877 --> 01:27:25,505
Our break-up wasn't
just a whim of the moment.

1143
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:28,649
It's been coming for a long time.
It had to happen.

1144
01:27:31,352 --> 01:27:33,843
You've been taking me for granted
too long.

1145
01:27:35,056 --> 01:27:37,991
I have to stand on my own two feet,
as a person...

1146
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:40,659
and as an actress.

1147
01:27:41,095 --> 01:27:44,724
Until I do,
I can't take time to think about...

1148
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:49,363
us or anything connected with the future.

1149
01:27:51,205 --> 01:27:52,934
That's how it's got to be.

1150
01:27:55,109 --> 01:27:57,202
You really do mean it, don't you?

1151
01:27:58,546 --> 01:27:59,774
Yes, I do.

1152
01:28:11,092 --> 01:28:12,616
Thanks for the dance.

1153
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:25,495
I knew this would do it.
I know how to handle those kids.

1154
01:28:25,573 --> 01:28:27,871
I'll bet they're in each other's arms
right now.

1155
01:28:27,942 --> 01:28:29,068
Good, Ezra.

1156
01:28:29,343 --> 01:28:30,833
Josh, where's Dinah?

1157
01:28:31,879 --> 01:28:33,506
She's right over there.

1158
01:28:34,882 --> 01:28:38,079
Well, if at first you don't succeed, give up.

1159
01:28:40,521 --> 01:28:42,318
- Hello, Ez.
- Hello, Josh.

1160
01:28:42,389 --> 01:28:44,653
- Hello, Genevieve.
- This is Henrietta.

1161
01:28:44,959 --> 01:28:47,985
Sorry.
Helen, Scotch and plain water, please?

1162
01:28:48,129 --> 01:28:50,620
- Yes, sir.
- Tonight's the night.

1163
01:28:50,865 --> 01:28:52,856
- For what?
- Dinah's show's opening.

1164
01:28:52,933 --> 01:28:54,798
Oh, that. Give me a cigarette.

1165
01:28:54,869 --> 01:28:56,166
Not interested?

1166
01:28:56,237 --> 01:28:58,432
- Barredout come in yet?
- What do you care?

1167
01:28:58,506 --> 01:29:00,371
Where have you been these past 10 days?

1168
01:29:00,441 --> 01:29:04,138
- I can't even get you on the phone.
- I'm taking a day course at City College.

1169
01:29:04,211 --> 01:29:06,338
Stop kidding, Josh. You look a wreck.

1170
01:29:06,413 --> 01:29:08,210
Well, I'm not. I feel fine.

1171
01:29:12,153 --> 01:29:14,883
- Here's to Dinah.
- To Dinah, right.

1172
01:29:38,312 --> 01:29:41,577
The honorable judges
of the <i>Conservatoire Franaise.</i>

1173
01:29:56,330 --> 01:29:59,128
<i>Mademoiselles,</i>
you have each been coached...

1174
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,725
in gesture and diction for this audition...

1175
01:30:01,936 --> 01:30:03,927
and you will all have an equal chance.

1176
01:30:04,004 --> 01:30:06,302
But only one will be chosen...

1177
01:30:06,373 --> 01:30:09,740
to join the ranks
of the <i>Conservatoire Franaise.</i>

1178
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:12,244
You may each perform one selection.

1179
01:30:12,913 --> 01:30:16,007
When you finish,
take your place over there.

1180
01:30:17,718 --> 01:30:19,242
Let us begin, please.

1181
01:30:20,888 --> 01:30:23,880
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Clementine Villard.

1182
01:30:31,799 --> 01:30:34,996
Don't be nervous, <i>mademoiselle.</i>
What will you recite?

1183
01:30:36,237 --> 01:30:38,762
Portia's speech from
<i>The Merchant of Venice.</i>

1184
01:30:41,909 --> 01:30:44,434
"The quality of mercy is not strained

1185
01:30:44,845 --> 01:30:47,245
"It droppeth,
as the gentle rain from Heaven

1186
01:30:47,314 --> 01:30:49,043
"Upon the place beneath"

1187
01:30:49,483 --> 01:30:51,576
Hello, Joe. How's it going?

1188
01:30:51,652 --> 01:30:53,813
Terrific, so far. Looks like a hit.

1189
01:30:55,522 --> 01:30:58,047
"And then is heard no more

1190
01:30:58,726 --> 01:31:03,163

full of sound and fury

1191
01:31:03,631 --> 01:31:05,531

<i>Mademoiselle</i> Sarah Bernhardt.

1193
01:31:26,487 --> 01:31:28,648
What will you recite, <i>Mademoiselle?</i>

1194
01:31:28,722 --> 01:31:31,088
The potion scene from <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

1195
01:31:31,859 --> 01:31:34,157
There's no need for you to be nervous.

1196
01:31:34,261 --> 01:31:36,456
I am not nervous, <i>Monsieur le Judge.</i>

1197
01:31:36,764 --> 01:31:39,062
Very well, in that case you may begin.

1198
01:31:40,901 --> 01:31:42,095
"Farewell!

1199
01:31:43,137 --> 01:31:45,332
"God knows when we shall meet again

"I have a faint cold fear

"I'll call them back"

1203
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,387
Forgive me, <i>Monsieur.</i>

1204
01:32:01,455 --> 01:32:05,357
These are words and gestures taught me
by my coach. I learned them like a parrot.

1205
01:32:05,426 --> 01:32:07,223
They have nothing to do with acting.

1206
01:32:07,294 --> 01:32:09,854
With your permission,
I'd like to recite something else.

1207
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:11,921
Very well. Be quick about it.

1208
01:32:17,905 --> 01:32:20,703
I'll recite the <i>Marseillaise.</i>

1209
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:27,068
Any child can recite that.
That's not acceptable. Let us go on.

1210
01:32:27,414 --> 01:32:31,145
<i>Monsieur,</i> you cannot deny
a loyal French citizen...

1211
01:32:31,218 --> 01:32:33,277
the right to stand in public...

1212
01:32:33,354 --> 01:32:35,845
and speak the words
of our national anthem.

1213
01:33:39,286 --> 01:33:40,480
Wait.

1214
01:33:52,599 --> 01:33:55,625
By unanimous consent,
this committee has chosen you...

1215
01:33:56,136 --> 01:33:58,161
for the <i>Conservatoire Franais.</i>

1216
01:34:02,109 --> 01:34:04,009
Bravo!

1217
01:34:21,261 --> 01:34:24,628
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm much too excited to say anything.

1218
01:34:25,265 --> 01:34:28,393
I can only hope
that this evening marks the beginning...

1219
01:34:28,702 --> 01:34:31,227
of a long association between myself...

1220
01:34:31,839 --> 01:34:34,933
and my beautiful, enchanting star,
whom I worship...

1221
01:34:35,042 --> 01:34:36,566
on and off the stage.

1222
01:34:48,422 --> 01:34:50,947
- Josh, did you see any of it?
- Last scene.

1223
01:34:51,191 --> 01:34:53,853
- She was pretty good, wasn't she?
- Pretty good? Great.

1224
01:34:53,927 --> 01:34:55,087
She sure was terrific.

1225
01:34:55,162 --> 01:34:57,494
What I can't get over
is that Barredout fellow.

1226
01:34:57,564 --> 01:34:59,395
- He should be in the movies.
- Wish he were.

1227
01:34:59,466 --> 01:35:02,299
He's dreamy.
They make such a handsome couple.

1228
01:35:02,369 --> 01:35:05,099
Marie, this is Mr. Barkley, her husband.

1229
01:35:05,372 --> 01:35:07,567
I thought you two were divorced.

1230
01:35:09,143 --> 01:35:11,634
- You were wonderful.
- See you later, Dinah.

1231
01:35:11,712 --> 01:35:14,203
- You were terrific, darling.
- Thank you very much.

1232
01:35:14,281 --> 01:35:17,114
Thanks for coming back.
See you at Millie's later.

1233
01:35:22,656 --> 01:35:26,558
- Dinah, I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you, Jacques.

1234
01:35:26,894 --> 01:35:29,385
I feel like a tongue-tied schoolboy.

1235
01:35:29,997 --> 01:35:32,898
I really meant what I said before.
I do worship you.

1236
01:35:33,767 --> 01:35:37,669
I was hoping that tonight
you would give me some word, some sign.

1237
01:35:39,373 --> 01:35:42,206
Well, later, Jacques.

1238
01:35:43,177 --> 01:35:45,145
All right. This is your night.

1239
01:35:45,812 --> 01:35:48,838
- I'll wait for you at Floriano's, darling.
- All right.

1240
01:35:49,082 --> 01:35:51,016
- Don't be too long.
- All right.

1241
01:35:53,654 --> 01:35:57,715
- Mrs. Barkley, you were wonderful.
- Thank you, Mary.

1242
01:35:58,492 --> 01:36:00,289
- Mary?
- Yes, ma'am?

1243
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:04,221
- Are these all the telegrams?
- That's all there are.

1244
01:36:04,932 --> 01:36:07,264
- Did you ask the doorman?
- Yes, I did.

1245
01:36:07,501 --> 01:36:08,490
You did?

1246
01:36:15,642 --> 01:36:17,166
There he is.

1247
01:36:17,511 --> 01:36:20,571
He is handsome, isn't he?
Gee, she's a lucky girl.

1248
01:36:20,647 --> 01:36:22,672
Marie, why don't you go
powder your nose?

1249
01:36:22,749 --> 01:36:26,480
I just did. Everyone in the powder room
was talking about him and her.

1250
01:36:26,553 --> 01:36:28,748
She thinks she's proved
she doesn't need me.

1251
01:36:28,822 --> 01:36:31,222
Thinks? She has proved it. Drink up.

1252
01:36:31,692 --> 01:36:33,159
- And I helped her do it.
- You what?

1253
01:36:33,227 --> 01:36:36,162
When he got up on stage
to make his speech, I held my breath.

1254
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:39,131
I thought for sure he was
going to announce their engagement.

1255
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:41,724
Why don't you get your broomstick
and fly home?

1256
01:36:41,802 --> 01:36:44,669
I threw Dinah right into his arms.
What a sap.

1257
01:36:44,905 --> 01:36:46,964
If ever a fellow dug his own grave...

1258
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,770
What are you talking about?
You were both to blame.

1259
01:36:49,843 --> 01:36:51,572
So you think it's over, too?

1260
01:36:51,645 --> 01:36:53,340
I don't know, not necessarily.

1261
01:36:53,413 --> 01:36:55,472
You think she doesn't love me anymore.

1262
01:36:55,549 --> 01:36:57,915
- You think I've lost her.
- I didn't say that.

1263
01:36:57,985 --> 01:37:01,580
- You think she loves Barredout.
- Well, what do you think?

1264
01:37:02,489 --> 01:37:05,322
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

1265
01:37:06,927 --> 01:37:09,725
I love her, Ez.
I've got to know where I stand.

1266
01:37:10,097 --> 01:37:11,826
This night might be the end.

1267
01:37:11,898 --> 01:37:14,924
She's still at the theater.
Why don't you call her up?

1268
01:37:15,002 --> 01:37:16,299
I couldn't do that.

1269
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:20,170
You've got to face it and talk to her.
Otherwise it might be too late.

1270
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:23,698
- No, I can't.
- Mr. Barredout.

1271
01:37:27,014 --> 01:37:30,074
Sure, I'll call her.

1272
01:37:30,150 --> 01:37:32,482
Good luck. Ten-to-one it's still you.

1273
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:35,880
Yes, I agree with you.
I think she's going to be...

1274
01:37:35,956 --> 01:37:38,516
one of the greatest legitimate actresses
of our time.

1275
01:37:38,592 --> 01:37:40,287
There's no doubt.

1276
01:37:42,696 --> 01:37:45,756
Mary, you did double-check
all the cards from the flowers?

1277
01:37:45,832 --> 01:37:47,299
Yes, I did, Mrs. Barkley.

1278
01:37:47,367 --> 01:37:49,927
- And there wasn't anything?
- No, not a thing.

1279
01:37:52,039 --> 01:37:54,405
Hello. Just a minute, please.

1280
01:37:56,443 --> 01:37:59,105
Hello. Yes, Jacques.
What on earth do you want?

1281
01:37:59,179 --> 01:38:00,646
I'll be right over.

1282
01:38:01,148 --> 01:38:04,481
I just wanted to ask you
something frightfully important.

1283
01:38:05,986 --> 01:38:08,352
I hope you realize what you mean to me.

1284
01:38:09,423 --> 01:38:13,086
I don't mean anything to you, do I?

1285
01:38:14,961 --> 01:38:17,327
Why do you ask me these questions now?

1286
01:38:17,397 --> 01:38:18,989
We'll talk later.

1287
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,831
But I must know this minute.

1288
01:38:22,102 --> 01:38:26,163
Do you still love your husband, or is it me?

1289
01:38:26,673 --> 01:38:29,642
But I can't possibly answer you
over the telephone.

1290
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:33,402
<i>Why not? What better way is there</i>
<i>to find out things, than on the phone?</i>

1291
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,812
- This is absurd.
- I'm sorry, dear.

1292
01:38:35,882 --> 01:38:39,045
I'll be with you in just a second.
I don't see how...

1293
01:38:41,455 --> 01:38:42,615
Jacques.

1294
01:38:44,391 --> 01:38:47,121
Just a minute.
Will you hold on just a second?

1295
01:38:47,194 --> 01:38:48,354
Jacques, come here.

1296
01:38:48,428 --> 01:38:50,555
They've gone to Millie's,
so I thought I would...

1297
01:38:50,630 --> 01:38:52,598
I've got to ask you
something very important.

1298
01:38:52,666 --> 01:38:56,432
Jacques, you did telephone me
at the hotel during rehearsals, didn't you?

1299
01:38:56,503 --> 01:38:57,731
No. Why?

1300
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:02,265
You didn't telephone me
during rehearsals?

1301
01:39:02,642 --> 01:39:05,770
No. I knew you were resting.
I didn't want to bother you.

1302
01:39:08,148 --> 01:39:10,810
Will you wait outside for...
I'll get dressed now.

1303
01:39:10,884 --> 01:39:12,215
I'll get a cab.

1304
01:39:13,253 --> 01:39:16,086
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

1305
01:39:16,323 --> 01:39:18,689
- Good. I'll be waiting.
- Yes.

1306
01:39:28,902 --> 01:39:30,665
Hello, Jacques.

1307
01:39:31,438 --> 01:39:33,429
Yeah? Yes?

1308
01:39:35,542 --> 01:39:39,103
I just took a minute to think things over...

1309
01:39:40,914 --> 01:39:42,142
darling.

1310
01:39:44,017 --> 01:39:46,884
And I'll answer you now.

1311
01:39:48,522 --> 01:39:49,784
I love you.

1312
01:39:50,824 --> 01:39:51,950
<i>Only you.</i>

1313
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:54,183
<i>I did think for a while that...</i>

1314
01:39:54,261 --> 01:39:56,752
<i>I might have some feeling left for Josh...</i>

1315
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:59,023
<i>when I was faltering in rehearsals.</i>

1316
01:39:59,099 --> 01:40:03,331
<i>But when you started calling me</i>
<i>and showing me the way...</i>

1317
01:40:04,638 --> 01:40:07,198
<i>I realized that, compared to you...</i>

1318
01:40:07,674 --> 01:40:11,075
<i>he's a cheap, incompetent hack.</i>

1319
01:40:13,814 --> 01:40:15,577
I love you, darling.

1320
01:40:18,452 --> 01:40:21,649
You've made me very happy.

1321
01:40:32,365 --> 01:40:34,856
Mary! Come on, help me find the key.

1322
01:40:34,935 --> 01:40:38,132
I've got to find the key.
You know, the one I put away.

1323
01:40:38,205 --> 01:40:39,900
Now, Mrs. Barkley, if you'll...

1324
01:40:44,845 --> 01:40:46,312
Taxi!

1325
01:40:48,315 --> 01:40:50,044
390 River Terrace, please.

1326
01:41:51,511 --> 01:41:54,878
<i>All that I know is</i>

1327
01:41:54,948 --> 01:41:58,543
<i>You'd be hard to replace</i>

1328
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:03,350
<i>Where else in all the world</i>

1329
01:42:04,124 --> 01:42:08,356
<i>Such loveliness and such grace?</i>

1330
01:42:10,063 --> 01:42:13,089
<i>The poet often chanted</i>

1331
01:42:14,768 --> 01:42:18,704
<i>The love he found divine</i>

1332
01:42:19,606 --> 01:42:22,871
<i>But never was he granted</i>

1333
01:42:24,411 --> 01:42:28,040
<i>A lady-love like mine</i>

1334
01:42:30,083 --> 01:42:34,042
<i>Deep down, deep down inside</i>

1335
01:42:34,487 --> 01:42:37,149
<i>My secret heart knows</i>

1336
01:42:39,826 --> 01:42:42,294
<i>The more that I'm with you</i>

1337
01:42:43,029 --> 01:42:47,432
<i>The more and more my rapture grows</i>

1338
01:42:49,202 --> 01:42:52,228
<i>Without you at my side</i>

1339
01:42:52,305 --> 01:42:54,432
<i>I fear</i>

1340
01:42:54,507 --> 01:42:59,001
<i>No future could I face</i>

1341
01:43:01,014 --> 01:43:05,747
<i>For you'd be oh, so hard to</i>

1342
01:43:06,419 --> 01:43:11,356
<i>Hard to, hard to, hard to</i>

1343
01:43:14,127 --> 01:43:15,458
Dinah, what are you doing here?

1344
01:43:16,830 --> 01:43:19,560
Hello. I came to see you.

1345
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,833
Well, this is a rare honor.

1346
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:26,730
I would have thought
that you'd be out celebrating.

1347
01:43:26,806 --> 01:43:29,832
Well, don't worry.
I'm going to make you very happy.

1348
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:33,211
I won't contest it.
You can have your divorce.

1349
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:34,806
Thank you.

1350
01:43:35,048 --> 01:43:37,608
Divorce happens
to suit my plans perfectly.

1351
01:43:39,352 --> 01:43:42,412
As a matter of fact, I'm expecting
a young lady here any minute.

1352
01:43:42,489 --> 01:43:44,719
So, if you don't mind...

1353
01:43:46,393 --> 01:43:48,486
- Shirley?
- Shirlene.

1354
01:43:49,796 --> 01:43:53,061
- Then you and she are really...
- We're mad about each other.

1355
01:43:54,234 --> 01:43:57,795
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations to you, too.

1356
01:43:58,805 --> 01:44:03,003
I hope you'll find your new director
easier to get along with than I was.

1357
01:44:05,578 --> 01:44:07,045
I doubt that.

1358
01:44:12,919 --> 01:44:14,147
Goodbye.

1359
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:18,052
Goodbye.

1360
01:44:22,862 --> 01:44:25,626
Don't you even want to shake hands?

1361
01:44:35,975 --> 01:44:39,069
Perhaps you should not be
quite so demonstrative...

1362
01:44:39,612 --> 01:44:43,514
throwing your arms around me and
kissing me in front of all of those people.

1363
01:44:43,583 --> 01:44:46,051
Discipline, you know. Discipline.

1364
01:44:47,053 --> 01:44:49,851
- Darling, your accent was amazingly good.
- Wait a minute.

1365
01:44:49,923 --> 01:44:52,448
Had me completely fooled until tonight...

1366
01:44:52,525 --> 01:44:55,153
when Jacques walked in
while you were on the phone.

1367
01:44:55,228 --> 01:44:56,559
Dinah, you know.

1368
01:44:57,564 --> 01:44:59,498
And you tortured me like this?

1369
01:44:59,699 --> 01:45:00,996
Just a little torture.

1370
01:45:01,067 --> 01:45:04,127
Why, you know
that I almost walked into the East River?

1371
01:45:04,304 --> 01:45:06,238
- I almost shot myself?
- No.

1372
01:45:06,439 --> 01:45:09,203
- I almost jumped off that roof?
- My poor darling!

1373
01:45:09,275 --> 01:45:12,005
- You might have almost killed yourself.
- I know.

1374
01:45:14,547 --> 01:45:16,344
I love you so.

1375
01:45:19,385 --> 01:45:21,512
- It mustn't happen again, darling.
- No.

1376
01:45:21,588 --> 01:45:23,488
We mean much too much to each other.

1377
01:45:23,556 --> 01:45:26,719
You're such a wonderful girl.
And such a talented actress.

1378
01:45:26,793 --> 01:45:29,353
Your performance was magnificent.

1379
01:45:29,429 --> 01:45:30,760
You are great.

1380
01:45:31,097 --> 01:45:31,995
I have an idea for a play.

1381
01:45:32,065 --> 01:45:34,329
- I don't want to do another play.
- No more dramas?

1382
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:35,833
- No biography.
- No messages?

1383
01:45:35,902 --> 01:45:37,164
No worrying about the plot.

1384
01:45:37,237 --> 01:45:39,432
Then we'll have
nothing but fun set to music.

1385
01:45:39,506 --> 01:45:41,098
We'll have tempo.

1386
01:45:41,174 --> 01:45:43,165
You know, that good old tempo.

1387
01:45:43,543 --> 01:45:46,740
<i>Just give me that Manhattan downbeat</i>

1388
01:45:47,013 --> 01:45:49,777
<i>That beats a tempo of its own</i>

1389
01:45:49,883 --> 01:45:52,681
<i>You've got to shout, "This is it!"</i>

1390
01:45:52,752 --> 01:45:54,379
<i>The day you visit</i>

1391
01:45:54,454 --> 01:45:57,321
<i>The jumpenest town was ever known</i>

1392
01:45:57,390 --> 01:46:00,655
<i>Keep your Paree and London town beat</i>

1393
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:04,327
<i>Pop Knickerbocker stands alone</i>

1394
01:46:05,064 --> 01:46:08,465
<i>Drive up any avenue,</i>
<i>swing down any street</i>

1395
01:46:08,535 --> 01:46:11,265
<i>There's no beat has</i>
<i>Manhattan downbeat beat</i>

1396
01:47:15,335 --> 01:47:18,532
<i>Manhattan has a beat that's all its own</i>

1397
01:47:18,605 --> 01:47:22,302
<i>Manhattan has a beat to call its own</i>

1398
01:47:22,375 --> 01:47:27,540
<i>So, Mr. Leader, when you give</i>
<i>the band the downbeat</i>

1399
01:47:28,147 --> 01:47:29,409
<i>A one, two, three</i>

1400
01:47:29,482 --> 01:47:32,645
<i>And give them that Manhattan downbeat</i>

1401
01:47:32,886 --> 01:47:35,787
<i>That beats a tempo of its own</i>

1402
01:47:36,623 --> 01:47:38,921
<i>You've got to shout, "This is it!"</i>

1403
