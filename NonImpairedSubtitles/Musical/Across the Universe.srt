1
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000

2
00:00:56,756 --> 00:01:03,025
Is there anybody
Going to listen to my story

3
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:08,193
All about the girl who came to stay

4
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:13,598
She's the kind of girl
You want so much

5
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,640
It makes you sorry

6
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,209
Still you don't regret a single day

7
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,059
Hold me tight

8
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,326
Tell me I'm the only one

9
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,934
And then I might

10
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,298
Never be the lonely one

11
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,941
So hold me tight

12
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,378
Tonight

13
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,269
Tonight

14
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,880
It's you

15
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,041
Who will take me out next week?

16
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,806
You'll be halfway around the world.

17
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,749
Well, it better not be Phil Scully.

18
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,543
Come here.

19
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,750
I'll be back soon.

20
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,919
They give you a furlough
after boot camp.

21
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,357
And after that?

22
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,213
- Yeah. All right.
- Good night. I'll see you tomorrow.

23
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,820
All right, then.

24
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,663
Don't spend it all at once.
Last one for a while, eh, son?

25
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,362
- Last one ever, Cyril.
- I felt the same at your age.

26
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:12,340
I told myself, "When I'm 64,
I'll be long gone from this place."

27
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,506
- But I'm still here.
- Move it along.

28
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,242
Some of us are thirsty and
the pubs have been open five minutes.

29
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,281
Hi, Charlie.

30
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,490
You're gonna miss this place.

31
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,121
Don't count on it, Phil.

32
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,215
I've ironed your best shirts.

33
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:58,981
I'll be shoveling coal in a furnace,
Mum. I don't think I'll be wearing them.

34
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,161
You'll be wearing them
when you go ashore in America.

35
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,061
Yeah, well, that could be
months from now.

36
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,788
If you wanted a seafaring life...

37
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,467
...couldn't you have
signed up for the Mersey Ferry?

38
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,569
At least you'd be home
for your supper every night.

39
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,152
I sometimes feel
you're not telling me everything.

40
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,022
I just need a break
from the yard, Molly.

41
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,557
I'll be back before you know it.

42
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:20,204
Or do you need a break from me?
Is that what this is about?

43
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,237
Come here.

44
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:26,736
Close your eyes and I'll kiss ya

45
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,941
Tomorrow I'll miss ya

46
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,114
And remember I'll always be true

47
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,883
- Pull the other one.
- What?

48
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,956
And then while I'm away

49
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,357
I'll write home every day

50
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,295
You better.

51
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:53,063
And I'll send all my loving to you

52
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,365
You bastard.

53
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,932
- Bye, sweetheart!
- Bye!

54
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,697
Goodbye, Danny!

55
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,568
Bye.

56
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,066
- Go deep!
- Let's go...

57
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,672
...Wildcats!

58
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,912
All right, ladies, let's take a break.
Come on.

59
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:18,284
Yeah, I'll tell you somethin'

60
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:24,029
I think you'll understand

61
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:29,858
When I say that somethin'

62
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,533
I wanna hold your hand

63
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:53,959
Oh, please say to me

64
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:59,053
You'll let me be your man

65
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:05,032
And please say to me

66
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:12,468
You'll let me hold your hand

67
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:34,795
And when I touch you
I feel happy inside

68
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:42,808
It's such a feeling that my love

69
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,173
I can't hide

70
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,024
Hop in.

71
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,423
Thanks, mate. Appreciate it.

72
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,375
Sorry. Excuse me.

73
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,517
Shit! Goddamn it.

74
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,323
Thanks, man.

75
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,320
Excuse me, you don't where I
could find Professor Huber, do you?

76
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,193
No such person.
Not that I'm aware of.

77
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,096
Professor Wesley Huber?

78
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,828
Listen, I've pissed off
every professor in Princeton...

79
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,768
...and he's not one of them.

80
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,637
Oh, wait a second,
there's a Wes Huber.

81
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,277
That's him right over there.

82
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,688
Can I have a word?

83
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,859
If you're looking for work here,
check with administration.

84
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,118
I got a job, thanks.

85
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,162
You sound like a limey.

86
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,687
I am, yeah.

87
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:27,096
I was stationed there during the war.
I had some good times.

88
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,298
Yeah, I know.

89
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,570
At Burtonwood, right?

90
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,710
How would you know that?

91
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,017
L... I believe I'm your son.

92
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,018
I don't think so.

93
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,117
Me mother's Martha Feeny.

94
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,792
How'd you track me down?

95
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,660
Through Army records.

96
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,062
If I would have known about you...

97
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,798
What? You would've come back,
is that it?

98
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,771
You know, she said that wouldn't
have proved that you loved her...

99
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,470
...only that you felt obligated.

100
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,984
Well, it would have been better
than raising a kid on her own.

101
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,849
Yeah, well, she wasn't the only one
in those days.

102
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,823
You could excuse a bastard by saying
his dad was killed in the war.

103
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,371
Did she find someone else?

104
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,376
There were a few hopefuls
over the years, yeah.

105
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,011
I think I scared them off.

106
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,343
- Listen, kid, l...
- It's Jude.

107
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,950
Jude.

108
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,282
I got a family.
I got a wife, I got two kids.

109
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:55,119
Yeah, look. Mr. Huber,
I didn't come here to derail your life.

110
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,026
You know? And I'm not here
for your love or your approval.

111
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,723
I'm just here so that we both...

112
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:06,234
Both know
that the other one exists.

113
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,002
All right.

114
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,114
- Fifteen bucks says you miss this shot.
- Fifty says your sister still marries me.

115
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,944
Yeah, well, maybe.

116
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,676
All right, window. Let's go.

117
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,377
- All right, ladies.
- There you go.

118
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,886
- Ready?
- Yep.

119
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,714
Okay.

120
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,052
Fore!

121
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,257
Run!

122
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:31,960
You missed!

123
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,392
- Whatever.
- It was the wind.

124
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,157
- Set me up.
- I believe in you.

125
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,165
You couldn't hit the barn side
of a broad, man. Come on.

126
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,769
There you go.

127
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,462
Fore!

128
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,807
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

129
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,674
- How do you like me now?
- We're gonna get you, asshole!

130
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,113
How do you like me? Go to bed.
Go to bed, you ain't got nothing.

131
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,220
- Yeah, they're going back into...
- They're not going back to bed.

132
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,117
- No, they're not.
- Go, go, go.

133
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,824
Go, go, go.

134
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,327
They went this way. Come on!

135
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,110
Shit, I'm out of shape.

136
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,152
You're the guy who was
asking for the janitor, right?

137
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,350
Yeah.

138
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,190
So, what are you,
like the assistant janitor?

139
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,532
I'm just bunking down here,
you know, temporarily.

140
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,728
- Why?
- Why do you need to know?

141
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,905
You're wanted by the cops, huh?
FBI?

142
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,846
You know, it looks to me as though
you're the one who's on the run.

143
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,915
Yeah.
Thank you for that, by the way.

144
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,143
What would they have done
if they caught you?

145
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:06,313
I don't know. Something involving
genitalia and shoe polish.

146
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,493
- Nasty.
- Yeah.

147
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,256
- Where's that accent from?
- Same place as me. Liverpool.

148
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,694
And do you have a name?

149
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,899
Yeah.

150
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,600
- It's Jude.
- Max.

151
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,731
I'm pleased to meet you.

152
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,809
Well, Jude,
as a stranger to our shores...

153
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:31,972
...the least I can do is offer you
some Ivy League hospitality.

154
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,520
Cheers.

155
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,024
Welcome to the nursery.

156
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,794
What would you do
If I sang out of tune

157
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,433
- Thank you.
- Would you stand up

158
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,728
And walk out on me?

159
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,329
- Hey. I'm Chris.
- Lend me your ears

160
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,474
- And I'll sing you a song
- Thanks.

161
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,769
- And I'll try not to sing out of key
- There we go. All right.

162
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,945
I get by
With a little help from my friends

163
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,980
He gets high
With a little help from his friends

164
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,614
- Take it easy, man.
- Hold it in.

165
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,298
I can't believe her.

166
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,013
I'm never having children.

167
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:52,411
- Really?
- No.

168
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,109
Think about it, it's pure narcissism.

169
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,517
I mean, people putting out little
carbon copies of themselves, going:

170
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,624
"Oh, doesn't he have
his father's eyes?

171
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,760
Doesn't he have his mother's lips?"
It's...

172
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,861
It's disgusting.

173
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,632
Well, what about adoption?

174
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,496
Luce!

175
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,996
Lucy!

176
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,661
Every night
When everybody has fun

177
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:42,930
Here am I
Sitting all on my own

178
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,068
It won't be long, yeah

179
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,938
Till I belong to you

180
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,217
Since you left me, I'm so alone

181
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:06,050
Now you're coming
You're coming on home

182
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,187
I'll be good like I know I should

183
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,466
- Do you know when?
- Next weekend.

184
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,504
He got a pass
before his outfit ships out.

185
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,410
I tell you, man,
this is my favorite time of day.

186
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:39,284
- Look at these. That one, she's cute.
- Emily!

187
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:42,082
- Look at these. That one, she's cute.
- Emily!

188
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,618
- Hey.
- Max!

189
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,382
Jailbait.

190
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,954
- How are you? Good.
- I'm good.

191
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,134
- Damn.
- Max, you're such a pervert.

192
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,700
What? Some of them
are kind of cute.

193
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,401
When did Emily get tits?

194
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,565
Emily.

195
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:08,101
This is Jude. I asked him over
for Thanksgiving.

196
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,885
We don't have it in England.
Is it...? Is it a big deal?

197
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,750
Well, it's a heartwarming
American tradition.

198
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,949
Yeah. It celebrates the time...

199
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,993
...when the Indians shared their food
with the early settlers.

200
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,927
And how did we repay them?
We slaughter them in thousands...

201
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,125
...and then ship them off
to the shittiest bits of real estate.

202
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,902
I'm Lucy.

203
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,004
I went to the closet under the stairs
and my clubs weren't there.

204
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,042
- If you'd asked...
- You'd have said no.

205
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,111
I never knew Princeton
had a golf program.

206
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,304
They don't.

207
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:47,082
It's just my way of unwinding,
you know?

208
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,378
Whack a few balls around
at the end of the day.

209
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,215
Those lectures can fry your brains.

210
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,358
"Lectures." What lectures?
He dropped two courses.

211
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,787
Is that fashionable?

212
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,121
Is what fashionable?

213
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:02,194
- Your haircut, or lack of one.
- Androgyny suits you, Max.

214
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,034
These kids are so spoiled.

215
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:08,331
I washed dishes
to put myself through college.

216
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,499
You've never washed one since.
More stuffing, Jude?

217
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,341
I'm stuffed enough, thanks.

218
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:17,481
You have any idea what your father
pays for those tuition fees?

219
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,809
- Please.
- You know, Uncle Teddy...

220
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,248
...he won't have to
pay them much longer.

221
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:25,252
- I'm dropping out.
- The cranberry sauce isn't as tangy...

222
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,448
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I am not cut out...

223
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,149
...for this collegiate crap.

224
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,420
No problem. What are you...?
What's your plans?

225
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,155
You gonna buy a broken-down
station wagon...

226
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,493
...and drive across America
like Jack...

227
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,963
- What is it?
- Kerouac.

228
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,659
- Mom.
- I read.

229
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:44,240
Well, actually, I was hoping to borrow
your car, Dad. It's got AC and stereo.

230
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,739
Goddamn it, Max!

231
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,936
Be serious for once.

232
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,638
What do you actually intend
to do with your life?

233
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,375
Why is it always about,
"What will you do?"

234
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:57,578
"What will you do? What will he do?
Oh, my God, what will he do?"

235
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,256
Do, do, do, do, do.

236
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,288
Why isn't the issue here who I am?

237
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,720
Because, Maxwell,
what you do defines who you are.

238
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:09,026
No, Uncle Teddy,
who you are defines what you do.

239
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,326
Right, Jude?

240
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,503
Surely it's not what you do...

241
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,906
...but it's the way that you do it.

242
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:28,013
Sorry you had to sit through that.

243
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,318
Is it like that at your house?

244
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,354
Not really, no.

245
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,583
It's just me and me mum...

246
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:39,230
...so me education
is rarely a topic of conversation.

247
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,196
Max said you came here
to find your father.

248
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:47,566
- You jumped ship.
- Yeah, I did. Yeah.

249
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:52,072
It was weird when I got
this Princeton address, you know.

250
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,610
I had it in my head that he might be
some kind of Einstein or something.

251
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:59,375
But it turns out he's just
a working stiff like meself.

252
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,081
How'd it go?

253
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,051
It was okay.

254
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,254
I mean, he didn't invite me back
for Thanksgiving.

255
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:12,920
Might've been a bit tricky anyway. I've
spent half me life trying to hate him.

256
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:19,097
He walked out on me mum
when I was just a bun in the oven.

257
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,735
I never realized I had it so easy.

258
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,813
I mean, we're so... normal.

259
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,482
Oh, yeah?

260
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,151
I don't know, dinner was quite lively.

261
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,981
You know, when do that lot start
chucking plates at each other?

262
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,985
- Dessert. Yeah.
- Oh, dessert. All right, yeah.

263
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,954
My God, you...
You have perfect teeth.

264
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,058
No, you do, they're perfect.

265
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,131
People in Liverpool,
they only seldom do.

266
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:54,533
They stick out in all different
directions. It's horrible.

267
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:55,899
You never heard of braces?

268
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:59,565
Yes, I have, thank you very much.
We use them to keep our trousers up.

269
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,372
Goddamn it! It's like this
every time I come home.

270
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,276
I mean, what the hell do they
talk about when I'm not here?

271
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,314
You, mainly.

272
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,488
Jude, shit. I'm sorry, man.

273
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,486
Come on, we gotta
do something with him.

274
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,024
He's a sailor on leave. He needs
a bar, a brawl and a brothel.

275
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,022
I've just seen a face

276
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,668
I can't forget
The time or place where we just met

277
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,030
She's just the girl for me

278
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:30,071
And I want all the world to see
We've met

279
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,451
No.

280
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,331
Why, thank you.

281
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,045
Oh, yes!

282
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,644
What will you do
if you don't go back to college?

283
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,842
What any irresponsible, unmotivated
dropout would do:

284
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,918
Go to New York. Like, tonight.

285
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,218
What's the rush?

286
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,423
I mean, I like it here.

287
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:24,288
Come on. The most exciting thing
that ever happened here...

288
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,590
...was when they got automatic
pin setting. I'm talking the Village.

289
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,290
Think about it.
Great music, great dope, orgies.

290
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,899
It'll be a gas!

291
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,076
Yeah!

292
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,563
She's got a boyfriend.

293
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,298
That's okay. I've got a girlfriend.

294
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,967
Forget it, man.

295
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,236
I'm not living here.

296
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,835
You must be the two who called.

297
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:50,173
Yeah. We saw your ad
in Rat Magazine.

298
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,415
Right. Come on in.

299
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,714
It's our kitchen through here.

300
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,390
This would be our main room...

301
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,825
...living room, whatever room.

302
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,763
Real bummer losing my last tenant.

303
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:13,495
He played sax at the Gaslight.
Out all night, slept all day.

304
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:15,832
We could do that.

305
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,440
You'd have to, man,
because I'm a singer.

306
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,840
I can't have no one screwing up
my beauty sleep before 2:00.

307
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,909
Someone can take this bedroom.

308
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,051
I'm gonna need two weeks in advance,
guys. Is that a problem?

309
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:32,019
- No, no, no, that's not a problem at all.
- You look kind of clean-cut.

310
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,351
Then again, could've murdered
your granny with a hammer.

311
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:43,723
Actually, we're students.

312
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,630
I'm Jude and he's Max.

313
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,099
I'm Sadie.

314
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,603
That's me. Out of bounds.

315
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,066
- Are you famous, Sadie?
- Man.

316
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:54,836
Not yet.

317
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,008
You guys have
a good memory for faces?

318
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,274
Yeah, I think so. Why?

319
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,484
There's no mirror in your bathroom.

320
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,260
- Oh, man! What a fox!
- Yes!

321
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,298
I mean, for an older woman, huh?

322
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:22,699
Max, I will pay for my share of the rent
just as soon as I get a job, man.

323
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:27,771
Jude, don't worry about it.
Look where we are, man.

324
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,874
Move it, pal. Come on.

325
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,378
Get out of here.

326
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:26,465
Get on the ground!
Get down!

327
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,259
Attention.

328
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,959
The 7:05 Northeast Limited
leaving for New York City...

329
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,470
...now ready for boarding
on Platform 20.

330
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:55,840
Platform 20, Northeast Limited
now ready for boarding.

331
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,492
Check it out, man.

332
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,255
Check it out.

333
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,433
Rat.

334
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,471
What the hell are you doing, man?

335
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,144
Desmond, this boy
wants to talk to you.

336
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:15,642
Hey.

337
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:21,411
I love it.

338
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,257
"Just stand on your head."
She said, "Why?"

339
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,859
"I wanna see what it'd look like
through a beer."

340
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,461
- Get off me.
- Oh, man.

341
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,632
Hey, do you write your own songs,
Jo-Jo?

342
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,064
Yeah.

343
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,769
I got 20 in a notebook...

344
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,833
...another 10 in my head.

345
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,599
Leave room for anything else?

346
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:22,173
Music's the only thing
that makes sense anymore, man.

347
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:27,113
Play it loud enough,
it keeps the demons at bay.

348
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,054
Hello, hello. Who are you?

349
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:42,054
- Prudence.
- Where you from, Prudence?

350
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,327
Nowhere.

351
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,665
Oh, and before nowhere?

352
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,601
Ohio.

353
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:55,609
Then I was living
with this guy across the street.

354
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,814
Did he do that to you?

355
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,217
He was a mistake.

356
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:05,812
Where'd she come from?

357
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,589
She came in
through the bathroom window.

358
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:12,923
Thanks.

359
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,989
I understand you need to get away...

360
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,668
...but why not come to Europe
with your father and me?

361
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,860
I'd rather be with Max.

362
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,766
In New York?

363
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,771
Just for the summer,
till I go to college.

364
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:30,310
I shudder to think how Max lives,
or what he's up to.

365
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,982
He always attracts
the most dubious people.

366
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:36,584
He's probably surrounded by
promiscuous dope fiends.

367
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,448
Mom!

368
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,856
You know me. I don't even smoke.

369
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,862
The big, bad city's
not gonna get me.

370
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,752
Isn't she fantastic?

371
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:22,893
Amazing.

372
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,335
She's our landlady.

373
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,130
- You live with my brother too?
- Yeah, him and Jude took me in.

374
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,604
I don't sleep with them anymore.

375
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,128
Thank you.

376
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,472
Hey, Lucy?

377
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,040
How do you like New York so far?

378
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:09,178
This is all I've seen. I only
got off the train three hours ago.

379
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,746
- Oh, yeah?
- Let's hear it for the Po Boys, y'all.

380
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,042
Do you wanna go out
and get some fresh air?

381
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,618
- Yeah?
- How about another one?

382
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,790
- All right, bring it home!
- All right!

383
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,786
Man, it's packed in there.

384
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:28,056
Your girlfriend didn't look too happy
about us leaving together.

385
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,326
She... She's not my girlfriend.

386
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:35,995
Well, you know, she's a friend
who's a girl.

387
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:40,910
I thought you'd gone home.

388
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,978
No, no. I like it here.

389
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,580
Although I'm not really here.

390
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:49,344
You know, without a visa
I don't officially exist.

391
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:53,819
It's exhilarating in a way. It's like
a weird kind of freedom. You know?

392
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,793
Hey.

393
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,627
Are you okay?

394
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,060
I mean, you know,
I heard what happened.

395
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,702
Yeah.

396
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,867
But...

397
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:18,711
...a letter came for Max
before I left home...

398
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:23,585
...and I haven't been able
to bring myself to give it to him yet.

399
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:29,952
- Scrub the floor, right, Jo-Jo?
- That's disgusting.

400
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,960
That was great, man.
You got a really good sound.

401
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,092
You shouldn't have
dropped out of college, Max.

402
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:41,703
Your sister's right. You had that
whole Ivy League thing going for you.

403
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:45,136
- And your father's a lawyer and shit.
- Max, what exactly does it say?

404
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,239
It says I have to report to
an induction center on the 7th.

405
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:50,413
Bummer.

406
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,707
You got a week to contract
some fatal disease.

407
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,248
Guys tried all kinds of stuff
when I did my time.

408
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,910
- You were in the military, Jo-Jo?
- No escaping it where I'm from.

409
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,385
I went in when I was 17.

410
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,559
Say you're a homo.
They don't take homos.

411
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,786
Just say you're a pedophile.
Say you wanna go into the villages...

412
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:09,898
...and you wanna rape and pillage
all the little girls that look like me.

413
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,567
I remember this one cat.

414
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,169
He ate a ton of beets
the night before the physical.

415
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,896
- Looks like blood when you piss.
- Well, I hate beets.

416
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,234
- Can we get the check, please?
- In a minute.

417
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,172
- What is with these pricks?
- Calm down.

418
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,609
My mate's brother swallowed
a ball of cotton to get out the army.

419
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,043
What does that do?

420
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,775
It shows up as, like,
a shadow on the x-ray.

421
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:32,251
- Track marks. They won't take a junkie.
- You want him to shoot up?

422
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,152
No. We could just jab his arm
with a needle a few times.

423
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,520
Make it a rusty needle.
Then it'll get infected.

424
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,787
- That could work.
- Yeah. Gets all nasty.

425
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,795
- Max.
- Oh, man, Max, what are you doing?

426
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,265
You can burn that paper, boy...

427
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,929
...but you still gotta show.

428
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,276
Daniel couldn't wait to go.

429
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:59,441
He saw it as his patriotic duty.

430
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,207
And I went along with it.

431
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:03,352
I was proud of him, I guess.

432
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:09,325
Apparently, he did
something brave...

433
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:13,326
...so he wore a medal
when they buried him.

434
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,928
You don't have to talk about this.

435
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,229
I want to.

436
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:24,639
I can't pretend like it didn't happen.

437
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:28,404
He was my first boyfriend.

438
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:31,547
He was the first person
I ever knew to die.

439
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,114
I'd never even been
to a funeral before.

440
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,453
I'm so scared for Max.

441
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,754
Listen, no one and no gun
is gonna get Max.

442
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:52,396
You know, he's so twisted,
he'll bend his way out of this fix.

443
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:55,601
Hope you're right.

444
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,700
I am right.

445
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:00,841
I love the bugger.

446
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:24,795
- Do you have the draft in England?
- Not anymore.

447
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:27,300
Well, I'd have been exempt
as a shipyard worker.

448
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,904
You should've studied art.

449
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,740
Yeah.

450
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,705
Well, I had to bring money
into the house.

451
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,213
So I joined the ranks
of the great unwashed.

452
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:45,287
Here. Come here.

453
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:46,645
Come here.

454
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:52,191
A little closer.

455
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,825
I just wanna get your eyes right.

456
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:04,340
You two, scram!
You're defacing city property.

457
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,839
- Oh, shit.
- What are you talking about?

458
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:09,569
This was just a crappy wall
and now it's a work of art.

459
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,213
You want me to come down there?

460
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:15,146
Please do come down.
You'll scuff up them shiny black boots.

461
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:16,546
Idiot.

462
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:19,517
Shit! Come on, you don't want to
get in trouble with the law.

463
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,055
- Let's go!
- Go! Go, go, go.

464
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,196
Jude, Jude, come here. Come here.

465
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,524
If I fell in love with you

466
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:03,196
Would you promise to be true

467
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:11,767
And help me understand

468
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:17,172
'Cause I've been in love before

469
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:21,210
And I found that love was more

470
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:28,055
Than just holding hands

471
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:37,064
If I give my heart to you

472
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:45,372
I must be sure from the very start

473
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:54,546
That you would love me
More than her

474
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:03,486
If I trust in you

475
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:10,166
Oh, please, don't run and hide

476
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:15,430
If I love you too

477
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:24,578
Oh, please, don't hurt my pride
Like her

478
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:30,876
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain

479
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:42,927
And I would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

480
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,778
So that's the way it is.

481
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:41,656
Yeah. That's the way it is.

482
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:45,692
Yeah, well, speaking as a brother,
I think she could do better.

483
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:47,825
Max, get out.

484
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:52,127
Well, excuse me, but as blissful as
you are in the throes of young love...

485
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,395
...l'm just letting you know
I got a date with Uncle Sam.

486
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,835
I want you

487
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,403
I want you so bad

488
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:42,212
I want you so bad

489
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:44,387
It's drivin' me mad

490
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:55,883
Any reason you shouldn't
be in this man's Army, son?

491
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:59,385
I'm a cross-dressing homosexual
pacifist with a spot on my lung.

492
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,384
Long as you don't have flat feet.

493
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:10,259
You know what really pisses me off?
Is I swallowed all those cotton balls...

494
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,094
...and they never even
took an x-ray.

495
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:14,793
- You still have options, man.
- Yeah, jail or Canada...

496
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:16,335
...and they both suck.

497
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,837
I mean, I could never come home.
So, what is it?

498
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:23,479
It's a choice of a 6-by-4 cell or an
endless wasteland of frozen tundra.

499
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,649
- Montreal's cool.
- Man, they speak French.

500
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,078
So learn French.
Learn French or die.

501
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,612
You think Sadie knows?

502
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,979
Knows what?

503
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,205
Let me see.

504
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:30,079
- No way.
- You look gorgeous.

505
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,305
Sadie, come on. What...?

506
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:36,144
- It's my band, honey.
- I can't wear this.

507
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:41,088
It's Tuxedo Club. For my 'do.

508
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,516
Yeah?

509
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:54,503
- Cool.
- Don't start.

510
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:56,638
What is it, Max?

511
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,774
Prudence. Come on, sweet pea.

512
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,304
We all love you.

513
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,844
- How long's she been in there?
- All night, I guess.

514
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:08,446
- Come on, Pru.
- What's going on?

515
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,176
It's Prudence.
I think she's hung up on me.

516
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,089
Dear Prudence

517
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:19,557
Won't you come out to play?

518
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:23,863
Dear Prudence

519
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:29,664
Greet the brand-new day

520
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,875
The sun is up, the sky is blue

521
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:38,479
It's beautiful and so are you

522
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:51,088
- Sadie, we gotta go.
- Later.

523
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,934
Hey, hey, LBJ.
How many kids did you kill today?

524
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:18,946
Our voice is our weapon.
And united we will win!

525
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:21,814
That's right, yeah!

526
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:27,888
You can crush the idealists,
but you cannot crush their ideals!

527
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:35,355
The Americans are forcing even their
friends into becoming their enemies.

528
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:38,932
Every day the hatred increases...

529
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,127
...in the hearts of the Vietnamese
who want us out!

530
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,966
The image of America
will never again...

531
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:53,444
...be the image of revolution,
freedom and democracy...

532
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,118
...but the image
of violent imperialism!

533
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,320
Hey, Luce! Luce, come on,
stop worrying about it.

534
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:02,821
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

535
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:05,517
I could go in the Army
and not get shipped to anywhere.

536
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:08,128
Play a lot of cards, learn how to box.

537
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,856
Come on, look at this.
It's happening everywhere, man.

538
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:15,026
Maybe LBJ will have a change of heart
and call the whole thing off, huh?

539
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,832
This war is totally immoral!

540
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:27,110
- As soon as possible.
- Yeah, I can get it.

541
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:29,443
Paco. This is Lucy Carrigan.

542
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:31,586
She's an old friend.
She's not a student...

543
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:34,018
...but she's interested in what we do.
Wanted to meet you.

544
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:35,451
- Paco.
- Nice to meet you.

545
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:37,091
How'd you hear about us?

546
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:40,751
I saw you at the Fifth Avenue peace
march. I was moved by your speech.

547
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:50,471
I'm thinking of renting the spare room
since Prudence split.

548
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:52,902
Jesus, Max.

549
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:55,873
Well, she's Prudence. She'll show.

550
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:02,442
You're up before 2 and
looking wicked cool. Who's it for?

551
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:06,315
- I have a meeting.
- Why, is that a prayer meeting?

552
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:09,416
Yeah, for your twisted soul.

553
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:14,090
- Put my shirt away when you're done.
- Yes, ma'am.

554
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,760
What the hell was that?

555
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:25,203
That's Dr. Robert.

556
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,138
He's here to plug his book.

557
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:30,209
Spread the word.

558
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:33,281
There's a party for him tonight
if you wanna join me.

559
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,214
We could celebrate.

560
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,284
I haven't said yes yet, Bill.

561
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,615
Sign with my label.

562
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:44,554
I'll put you in a studio within a month
and get you a publishing deal.

563
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:50,799
It sounds fantastic, man. But I still
gotta talk it over with the guys.

564
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:53,093
No, you don't.

565
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,946
- Whose place is this?
- Luna Park, Dr. Robert's publisher.

566
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:14,554
There she is. Luna!

567
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:18,691
Bill, good to see you.

568
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,419
Luna Park.

569
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:24,097
- Wow, this place is amazing.
- This is Sadie.

570
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,703
Fabulous singer and future star,
if she's smart and signs with me.

571
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:30,702
Oh, look at this, pink punch.

572
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:35,238
Cheers.

573
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:38,740
- You're not listening.
- Your guitar sound is a little lazy.

574
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:41,576
- We need it tighter, not slick.
- This band gets behind me.

575
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:45,948
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Dr. Robert.

576
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:54,587
Time is not on our hands, people.

577
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,863
Time is slipping through them.

578
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:02,629
We gotta transcend the bullshit,
and fast.

579
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:08,072
But, hey, no point butting your heads
bucking the system.

580
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:12,381
Let them get all snarled up
in their dreary hive.

581
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:16,309
Never knock the way
another cat swings, man.

582
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:25,754
Hate to mess with your groove,
New York...

583
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:29,090
...but we're about two years
ahead of you on the coast.

584
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:33,291
We already graduated
from what's been going on...

585
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:35,561
...to where it's gone.

586
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,407
Amen.

587
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:22,498
Nice. Nice.

588
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:27,932
Love the people. Love the people.
We love the people.

589
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:51,694
Where are we?

590
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,860
I don't know.
And I don't know how we got here.

591
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:58,097
What is that place?

592
01:07:58,307 --> 01:08:01,470
Headquarters of
the League of Spiritual Deliverance.

593
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:04,441
The home of Dr. Geary.

594
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:09,448
Another outlaw like myself.
We're navigators.

595
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:12,382
We're aviators. We're...

596
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:15,455
...eating taters.
Masturbating alligators.

597
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:18,286
Bombardiers, we got no fears,
won't shed no tears.

598
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:20,962
We're pushing the frontiers...

599
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:23,825
...of transcendental perception.

600
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:28,299
What's weird is we haven't met yet...

601
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:31,405
...on this or any other plane.
- Hey, doc.

602
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:34,633
- He says he won't see you, man.
- Why, is he sick?

603
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:37,142
He just said he's busy.

604
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:41,477
Did you tell that son of a bitch...

605
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:45,347
...that we drove 3000 miles
to see him?

606
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:50,317
- All right, everybody back on the bus.
- What?

607
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:52,619
We're going home. California.

608
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,090
- Doc?
- We just got here.

609
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,491
- California isn't home to all of us.
- Yeah.

610
01:08:56,699 --> 01:09:02,001
What can I say? You're either
on the bus or off the bus.

611
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:08,035
- Sayonara!
- Screw you!

612
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:09,711
Oh, well, that's just perfect.
