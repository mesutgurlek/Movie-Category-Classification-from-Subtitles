1
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,781
<i>This is France, 1918...</i>

2
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,791
<i>World War I.</i>

3
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:46,355
<i>The first American troops to land in France
and to fight in France were the marines.</i>

4
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,263
<i>They were veterans who had seen
service all over the world...</i>

5
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,930
<i>China, Cuba, Santa Domingo, Mexico
and the Philippine Islands.</i>

6
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:56,007
<i>This is a company
of those marines...</i>

7
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,078
<i>Company "L", 3rd Battalion,
5th Regiment...</i>

8
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,203
<i>returning from the front.</i>

9
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,542
What outfit is this, buddy?

10
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,709
What outfit is it?

11
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,656
This is the 101 Ranch,
and I'm Pawnee Bill.

12
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,419
- All right, wise guy! What outfit?
- Company "L," 5th Marines!

13
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,461
- Thanks.
- Hey, that's us.

14
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,259
I know it.

15
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,499
- Who's your commanding officer?
- Flagg!

16
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,096
- Who?
- Captain Flagg.

17
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,308
Captain Flagg.

18
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,778
- Wait a minute!
- Isn't that the outfit we're assigned...

19
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,874
Yeah. Captain Flagg.

20
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:43,421
We're not due in till tomorrow, and I am not
joining Flagg's outfit until I have to.

21
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,083
We got lost, see?
Come on.

22
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,126
Flagg.

23
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,985
Company, attention!

24
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,987
Charmaine! Charmaine!
Charmaine!

25
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,175
<i>Company, forward.!</i>

26
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,197
Eyes... right!

27
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,948
<i>Squad, right.!</i>

28
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,529
Company... halt!

29
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,279
Dismiss your men and feed 'em.

30
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,249
Fall out!

31
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,198
Try it again, Moran.

32
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,337
Eight hundred and
fifty-three francs to date.

33
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,589
<i>Sorry, Sergeant.</i>

34
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,183
No, no, no, no, no!

35
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,434
Moran, wait a minute.
Hey, Charmaine.

36
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:27,734
<i>How 'bout a little song?</i>

37
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,773
<i>Enchanté, Charmaine.</i>

38
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,820
How's business, Pete?

39
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,786
No kiddin'?

40
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,667
Not that bad, huh?

41
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,201
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

42
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,704
Very good.
Very good. Yeah.

43
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:17,373
- Huh? Well, fine. Yeah.
Hey, where are the boots?
- Huh?

44
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,177
- The boots.
- Boots?

45
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,842
- Boots. Yeah, boots.
- Boots.

46
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,182
<i>Oui. Boots. Boots, boots!</i>

47
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,189
<i>- Ah, the boots. Oui.
- Yeah.</i>

48
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,590
No, no, no. Boots, boots.

49
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,094
Boots, boots.

50
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,495
<i>Yeah, the boots.
Les boots. Please.</i>

51
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,659
I said it.

52
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,738
<i>Huh? Huh? Oui.</i>

53
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:48,243
All right. Okay. When I want to
go to Paris, I want to look very neat
and very snappy, eh? All right.

54
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,979
Hey, anybody home?

55
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,947
Hey in there!

56
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,986
Lewisohn, trot out that
high school French of yours.

57
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,384
But we are your allies.

58
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,521
Allies!

59
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:43,328
Wait a minute. Wait a second.
You got any money on you? Take your time.

60
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,699
- Yeah, a little.
- Well, let's have it.

61
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,233
There you are.

62
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,400
See?

63
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,503
Remind me to tell you sometime what I was
doing while you were in high school.

64
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,428
Lewisohn!

65
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,430
<i>Lewisohn.!</i>

66
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,582
Maybe I should have
gone to high school.

67
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,495
<i>Capitaine.!</i>

68
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,731
- What, baby?
- What are you doing in my room?

69
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,703
I've been looking over
your medal collection.

70
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:58,368
- Ah, that's nothing. But you
must go back to your room.
- Yeah, in a minute.

71
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,604
Captain Flagg.
Hiya, Charmaine.

72
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:05,012
I got almost everything packed.
Will you want your long underwear in Paris?

73
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,449
No. Shove off, lamebrain!

74
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,578
- You're going to Paris?
- Yeah.

75
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,622
- Take me with you.
- I can't. It's impossible.

76
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,318
- Why?
- Very important meeting. They're
gonna be asking me questions.

77
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,623
- You?
- Yeah. They want the point of
view of an observer from up front.

78
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,292
- Get outta here! Will you get out?
- All right, all right.

79
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:27,035
Well, I've observed much.
I'd be glad to tell them.

80
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,266
Yeah, I know, but I can't.

81
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,275
Your father wouldn't like it.
What would he think about it?

82
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,938
Papa? Well, Papa,
he would be very glad...

83
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,676
if you would marry me
and take me with you to Paris.

84
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,447
- M-Marry you?
- No?

85
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,079
Uh, no, no.

86
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,625
No, it's impossible, Charmaine.
I'd like to, but I can't. You see...

87
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,958
uh, I'm married already.

88
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,692
- You terrible liar.
- Oh, no, I'm not. I'll prove it to ya.

89
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,995
Wait. Oh, here.
Here's a picture.

90
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,230
Picture of my wife right here.
There it is.

91
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,897
"Lillian Russell."

92
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,943
That was her maiden name.

93
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,172
"Sweet Caporal."

94
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,181
Sweet corporal. You see, I was a corporal
when she married me.

95
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:15,845
That's what she always called me.
Always called me. Yep.

96
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:20,254
Her sweet... sweet corporal.

97
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,886
- Captain Flagg?
- Is it important, Mr. Moore?

98
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,691
- Urgent.
- That door.

99
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,699
Take me with you anyway.

100
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,168
I can't, baby. I can't.

101
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,536
<i>She is very beautiful.</i>

102
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,581
Come in.

103
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,117
Oh, l... I beg
your pardon, Captain.

104
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:52,156
<i>Sir, what about those three men
who are supposed to go up to Le
Mans to get the Croix de Guerre?</i>

105
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,486
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

106
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,720
All right, get 'em out
of the guardhouse...

107
00:14:56,862 --> 00:15:00,195
and have 'em take a bath
and send 'em up with an M.P. Escort.

108
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,292
And tell 'em not to belt the French general
when he kisses 'em. It's part of the ceremony.

109
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,336
Aye, aye, sir.

110
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,507
What an outfit.

111
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,988
<i>Oh, Capitaine.</i>

112
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,330
<i>- So these are
the new replacements.
- Yes, sir.</i>

113
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:41,998
Mm-hmm. What does headquarters
think I am, a wet nurse?

114
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,406
It's a citizens' army these days,
Captain Flagg.

115
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,604
Citizens' army!

116
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,771
I'll bet not one of them
has even voted yet!

117
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,720
- You, how old are you?
- Going on 20, sir.

118
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,052
- In how many years?
- Two, sir.

119
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,118
- You?
- Seventeen, sir.

120
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,494
Seventeen whole years.

121
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,203
- Where do you hide 'em?
- Here, sir.

122
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,148
You might as well
wear these while you're here.

123
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,507
- Yes, sir.
- You'll need 'em.

124
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,521
- You, where do you come from?
- Providence. Rhode Island, sir.

125
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:34,860
I know where it is. What kind of a job
do you have there?

126
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:37,124
L... Well, nothing, sir.

127
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,720
I was gonna go to college
before this came up.

128
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,924
- This is your first job.
- Yes, sir.

129
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,297
Well, we'll try to teach you
what you have to know.

130
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:49,636
And the more you learn, the better
your chances will be of staying alive.

131
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,642
College.

132
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,644
Texas!

133
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,582
Feed 'em, mister.
Feed 'em.

134
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,711
<i>Pick up your bags.</i>

135
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,658
<i>Right face.</i>

136
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,560
Let me know when that new
top soldier gets here. He's got
his work cut out for him.

137
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,597
Aye, aye, sir.

138
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,201
- "L" Company?
- Company headquarters.

139
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,137
- More like a two-bit flophouse to me.
- We aim to please.

140
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,472
Please yourselves. I'm the new
top soldier here. Who's company clerk?

141
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:28,740
- I am.
- Clear this stinkin' mess and
let's look at what you're doin'!

142
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:32,305
You heard what he said. Get out of here
and don't come back till I send for you.

143
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,011
Lose weight!

144
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:38,920
- Anything else, Top?
- Yeah. Here.

145
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,467
Is he in?

146
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,299
Are you the new top soldier?

147
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,839
- Is he in?
- He's waiting for you.

148
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,876
Well, tell him
I'm here. Now!

149
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,809
- Your name.
- Lipinsky.

150
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,247
- Lewisohn. Put him on your
roster. Help him with his gear.
- Aye, aye.

151
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,383
There.

152
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,888
Captain Flagg, your new
top soldier is here.

153
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,857
Well, it's about time.
Send him in.

154
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,860
Aye, sir.

155
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,302
- China!
- Nicaragua!

156
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,340
Philippines!

157
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,042
Sergeant Quirt reporting for duty
and requesting transfer at the same time.

158
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:19,487
- And there it is in triplicate.
- You know something.

159
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,491
- You're not gonna get it.
- No?

160
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,458
- You know why? I'm glad to see ya.
- No.

161
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,257
<i>- You are?
- Yeah.</i>

162
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,265
When I asked for a replacement, I thought
they'd send me a run-of-the-mill soldier.

163
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,700
And instead, they send me
the finest sergeant in the entire corps.

164
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,067
You must really be
in trouble to want me.

165
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,073
Cards on the table,
Quirt, I am.

166
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,373
I got a company made up of half
old men and half green kids who
want you to wipe their noses.

167
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,175
I want you to take those kids
and show 'em what they're in for.

168
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:47,241
<i>Make 'em hard, but don't break 'em.
Eight hours of guns and drill a day.</i>

169
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:52,289
And make them so hard they'd rather eat
steel than take a dressing down from you.

170
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,450
Begging your pardon, but where are you
gonna be while all this is going on?

171
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,553
I'm gonna be in Paris.
I got eight days leave. Why?

172
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,566
If you don't know why you're going to Paris,
I'd be the last one to try to tell you.

173
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:08,538
- Kiper! Kiper. All the platoon
leaders, on the double.
- Aye, sir.

174
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,007
<i>- Who's this?
- Lewisohn. Came up with me.
Just got out of the hospital.</i>

175
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,169
- Wounded, soldier?
- No, sir. Measles.

176
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,178
Measles!

177
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,215
Measles!

178
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,649
Babies. Always
sending me babies.

179
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,347
<i>Look. I wanna show you the layout.</i>

180
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,957
Come in.
We're holding over here.

181
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,356
On our left is the French.

182
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,656
Another baby to see you, Captain Flagg.

183
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:46,337
Charmaine, what are
you doing here?

184
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,413
I've changed my mind.
I'm going with you.

185
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:57,081
<i>I don't mind if you're going to be
busy in Paris. I'll be busy too.</i>

186
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,453
I'll bet!

187
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,686
Charmaine, I thought we settled
all this last night.

188
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:06,025
First, I can't take you to Paris
because of your father and my wife.

189
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,725
<i>Second, I haven't got room
on the motorcycle.</i>

190
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,394
Third, I might not stay in Paris.
This is gonna be one of
the biggest meetings of the war.

191
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:16,974
- General Pershing himself is gonna be there.
- You're a terrible liar. Is he not, Sergeant?

192
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,909
- Huh?
- It's not true that General
Pershing would talk to him?

193
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:26,007
It's true, lady. Absolutely true.
Captain Flagg here is a very important man.

194
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,951
<i>He has to go to Paris.
As a matter of fact, that's why I'm here.</i>

195
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,956
I'm what you'd call
a sort of a... replacement.

196
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:38,390
- I do not understand.
- Never mind. And don't you try
to explain either.

197
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,432
<i>Now, Charmaine,
you go on home to Papa Pete.</i>

198
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,729
And wait for Captain Flagg.
You're my girl, remember?

199
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,396
And if I hear of your running
around with anybody else...

200
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,474
I will tear you in two.

201
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,908
See? Now, go on home.

202
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,606
- Good night, Charmaine.
- Good-bye, Captain.

203
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,478
<i>- Good-bye, Sergeant.
- Good-bye.</i>

204
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,022
Replacement, huh?
Don't try anything while I'm gone.

205
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,955
I broke you in China for something
like this and I'll break you again.

206
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,960
- Whatever happened to that little girl?
- What little girl?

207
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:13,520
- Don't give me that!
The one in Chefoo, China.
- Captain, I saved your life.

208
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,860
If it hadn't been for me you'd have married
that little girl and right now...

209
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,435
be running a Chinese laundry
with the seat of your pants
hanging out between your knees.

210
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,562
<i>- What happened to her?
- What happened to the battleship Maine?</i>

211
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,446
- Platoon commanders aboard, sir.
- Send 'em in.

212
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,218
Wait a minute.
Who's senior?

213
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,888
Aldrich.

214
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,932
Attention!

215
00:22:55,507 --> 00:23:00,774
Gentlemen, this is First Sergeant Quirt
who'll be in charge here.

216
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,780
This is Lieutenant Aldrich,
Lieutenant Moore, Lieutenant Schmidt.

217
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,907
Aldrich, you are senior here,
aren't you?

218
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,315
Yes, sir. Two days
ahead of the others, sir.

219
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,320
You'll be in command.

220
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,949
Ask Quirt for any advice you need.
I'll be back Wednesday week.

221
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,061
Now, men, Sergeant Quirt...

222
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,596
is one of the best darn soldiers that
ever tore up a memorandum receipt.

223
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,633
I have soldiered with him
all over the world.

224
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:28,604
And there isn't a finer, cleaner,
smarter marine afloat than Quirt...

225
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,766
when he's sober.

226
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:35,039
And while he's sober, he'll run this outfit
whether I'm here or absent.

227
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,479
But, uh, Quirt... loves the bottle.

228
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,609
<i>And when he's drunk,
he is the lousiest...</i>

229
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,347
<i>filthiest tramp that
ever wore a uniform.</i>

230
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:49,324
He's even worse than I am. And I don't
allow anybody to get as bad as that.

231
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,828
If he tanks up, I'll bust him.

232
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,262
I busted him before
and I'll bust him again.

233
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,926
Get that, Aldrich.

234
00:23:57,068 --> 00:24:00,231
The first time you find him down in
the square with his face in the dirt...

235
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:03,705
Iock him up, and keep him
locked up till I get back.

236
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:08,143
But if he behaves himself, give him his head
and let him have anything he wants.

237
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:12,808
He's forgotten more about being a soldier
than any of you college boys will ever know.

238
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,352
Now, if you're wise...

239
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,515
you will not play cards with him.

240
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:23,116
You said it.
And before you lend him any money...

241
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,196
kiss it one last long farewell.

242
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,198
He'll steal your cognac...

243
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,259
<i>he'll steal your socks,
your women...</i>

244
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,703
and your front teeth
if they've got any gold in them.

245
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,605
That's all. Kiper.

246
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,009
- Motorcycle alongside, sir.
- Give her a spin and we'll shove off.

247
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,774
Gangway.

248
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,782
Attention!

249
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,055
Right face!
Forward march!

250
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,490
Just kidding, sir.

251
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,088
Will do!

252
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,237
Wheel blocks away!

253
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,542
One, two, three, four.

254
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,480
One, two, three, four.

255
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,553
One, two, three, four.

256
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,622
We do the fightin' for the navy.

257
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,453
And the sailors get the gravy.

258
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,358
One, two, three, four.

259
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,953
One, two, three, four.

260
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,965
Had a girl in Madagascar.

261
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,662
First I kissed her,
then I asked her.

262
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,864
One, two, three, four.

263
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:18,373
One, two, three, four.

264
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:21,309
When I lost that blond Norwegian.

265
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,348
Went and joined the foreign legion.

266
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,609
Hup, two, three, four.

267
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,311
One, two, three, four.

268
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,751
Just like our soldiers.

269
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,565
Next thing we're gonna take up is
the marching manual done in 16 counts.

270
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,999
Starts from right shoulder arms
and it goes like this.

271
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,196
One, two, three, four...

272
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,330
five, six, seven, eight...

273
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,305
nine, 10, 11, 12...

274
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,468
13, 14, 15, 16.

275
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:58,413
That's the way we do it in the
corps, and that's the way you're
gonna do it. Any questions?

276
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,508
Attention!
Right shoulder arms!

277
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:07,681
Sixteen count manual ho!
One, two, three, four.

278
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,953
Left, two, three, four.

279
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:13,656
<i>One, two, three, four.
Hup, hup, hup, hup...</i>

280
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,497
Hup, hup... All right, wise guys.
Line it up!

281
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,538
You think this is funny?
You gonna laugh? Now laugh.

282
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,573
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

283
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,940
By the numbers! Right face!

284
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,876
Forward march!

285
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,005
Laugh. It's funny.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

286
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,617
When you get back,
pick up those pieces.

287
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,653
Right face!

288
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:44,323
<i>Hey, you, corps man.!
On your feet.!</i>

289
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,262
Left face!
Forward march!

290
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,638
We do the fighting for the navy.

291
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,639
Then the sailors get the gravy.

292
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,470
Hup, two, three, four.

293
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,544
Hup, two, three, four.

294
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,510
Company, left!

295
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,481
<i>Hup, two, three, four.
Sing it out.!</i>

296
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:09,212
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.

297
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,188
To the rear, turn!

298
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,055
Hup, two, three, four.
Sing it out!

299
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,095
Hup, two, three, four.

300
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,129
Hup, two, three, four.

301
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:24,133
- Hup, two, three, four.
- To the left flank, march!

302
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:27,932
To the rear, march!
To the rear, march!

303
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,939
Company, halt!

304
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,010
Fall out!
Fall in!

305
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:36,602
When I say "fall in," I wanna see
nothing but a cloud of dust.

306
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:40,184
And when that cloud of dust clears away,
I wanna see 40 quivering statues.

307
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,980
Fall out! Fall in!

308
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,851
Dismissed!

309
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,778
<i>Voulez-vous promenade avec moi
down by the canal tonight?</i>

310
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,821
- No.
- Why not?

311
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:22,120
Sergeant, I have something
terrible to tell you.

312
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,228
Come.

313
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,890
What is it?

314
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:31,832
Sergeant, you must find another place
to stay. Papa says so.

315
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,531
Now wait a minute.
I don't wanna leave. I like it here.

316
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:39,370
But you came here to spend one night
and you've been here the whole week.

317
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,969
- Have you ever had a nicer guest?
- That's not the point.

318
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,947
This is the captain's room,
and he's coming back tomorrow.

319
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,747
- Let the captain find himself another room.
- But you do not understand.

320
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,755
The captain pays for the room,
even if he's not here.

321
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:56,122
Do you mean that the captain's been paying
for this room and I've been paying for it too?

322
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:59,958
<i>Oui. But he pays more
than you, so you must go.</i>

323
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,827
Papa says.

324
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:05,334
- Do you want me to go?
- No.

325
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,370
Charmaine, come here.

326
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,702
You're making a terrible mistake.

327
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,369
Honey, this isn't just another one
of those things with me.

328
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:16,742
This is different.
Why, I'd do anything for you.

329
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,748
Just ask me. Anything.

330
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,880
- Give up the room.
- Oh, Charmaine.

331
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:28,481
- Who would I get to do my laundry?
- You'll find someone.

332
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:33,529
No, honey. There never was another girl
in the world who could iron shirts like you.

333
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:38,861
Maybe... Maybe you could
meet me down by the canal?

334
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,665
What would we do
down by the canal?

335
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,003
The laundry.

336
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,648
<i>Well, au revoir,
Mademoiselle Charmaine.</i>

337
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,686
It certainly has been nice knowing ya.
Hope I meet up with you again sometime.

338
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,585
Pardon me, Pete.
And the same to you.

339
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,366
<i>Nicole! Nicole!
Here. Ici.</i>

340
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,108
<i>Oh, don't be afraid.
N'a pas peur.</i>

341
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:28,277
- I'm not afraid, if that is what you say.
- Hey, you speak American.

342
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:32,856
<i>- We study at the school.
- Well, that's a pretty
good school. Vous parlez.</i>

343
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,891
You speak very well.

344
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,266
Sister Cecile does not permit us to
speak French in English class.

345
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,335
I can't tell you how glad
I am you have Sister Cecile for a teacher.

346
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:50,840
Thank you. Also, my father does not permit
that I speak with American soldiers.

347
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:53,410
- In any language.
- Oh, I see.

348
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:57,913
But sometimes in the English class,
we speak a little French.

349
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,613
What village in America
do you come from?

350
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,154
I come from the village
of, uh, Philadelphia.

351
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,521
- Philadelphia's a city.
- Thank you.

352
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,618
Benjamin Franklin
came from Philadelphia.

353
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,822
He discovered lightning.

354
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:16,866
He did?

355
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:20,426
- How old are you?
- I have 17 years.

356
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:23,597
- What age have you?
- I have 22 years.

357
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,880
Nicole, l... I think
about you all the time.

358
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:31,440
Yes.

359
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,449
You only see me three times.

360
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:37,988
Four times. I waited for you yesterday
at the crossroads, but I did not speak.

361
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,649
- Nicole, l...
- It is the war.

362
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:43,886
Yes, if it hadn't been for the war,
I never would have seen you at all.

363
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,161
Nicole?

364
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,735
That song you sing at school...

365
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,804
what does it mean, in English?

366
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,401
To you I give...

367
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,714
All my love.

368
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,651
All my life.

369
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,124
I promise.

370
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,628
All my love.

371
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,932
All my life.

372
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,366
The leaves fly away.

373
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,812
The roses die.

374
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:46,123
But the flower of our love.

375
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,758
Will last forever.

376
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,233
All my love.

377
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,738
All my life.

378
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:45,248
All for you

379
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:53,416
Attention!

380
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:03,056
- Nice, eh, skipper?
- Oh, wonderful.

381
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,152
Harder!

382
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,531
Harder!

383
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,298
Harder!

384
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,133
Not that hard!
That hard!

385
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:26,442
- How are you, Captain?
- I am a wreck! That's what I am.

386
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,384
I am an epoch-making disaster.

387
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,513
- You see before you, mister, uh...
- Aldrich.

388
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,888
One of the seven great
calamities of the world!

389
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,700
Well, what's happened?

390
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,895
Not a thing.

391
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:50,235
<i>- Kids in shape?
- They'll do.</i>

392
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,469
- Give me three more days,
I'll risk 'em on the line.

393
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:57,639
Three more days.
Just try and get three more days.

394
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:00,182
<i>- Brigade runner, Captain Flagg.
- Send him in.</i>

395
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,912
<i>All right, buddy.</i>

396
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,682
- Captain Flagg? Captain Simpson.
- Here.

397
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,657
He wants you to know that the crowd
from G1 are on their way over.

398
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,091
Mm-hmm. Tell him
I'm much obliged.

399
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,493
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, soldier.

400
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,906
Do you know what headquarters
wants us to do?

401
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,451
They want us to go in
and straighten the line.

402
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:40,081
Straighten the line. Did you ever hear of
a straight line between two countries?

403
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,284
- A little more coffee, Skip?
- No!

404
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,196
- Good evening, Mr. Kiper.
- Hello.

405
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:51,200
Did you get tattooed
while you were in Paris?

406
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,778
I, uh... I was wondering, maybe my
discharge papers got here.

407
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:18,787
Nope. Didn't come.
Keep in touch with us.

408
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,226
Tough.

409
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,598
- Three years.
- Red tape.

410
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:32,001
<i>- You, uh, attendez ici.
- Okay.</i>

411
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:39,208
Captain Flagg, there's an old
gentleman outside, and he wants
to see you about his daughter.

412
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,218
- What about his daughter?
- He has a complaint, sir.

413
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,550
- Against someone in this outfit?
- Yes, sir.

414
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,954
Well, send him in.

415
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:52,086
I can't leave this outfit half a day
without somebody breaking loose!

416
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:56,155
Don't you know this is a decent village
with decent people living in it?

417
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,139
Pete.

418
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,334
- Is this the man that has the complaint?
- Yes, sir.

419
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:10,642
- Think fast. Think fast.
- What is this all about, Pete?
One of my men?

420
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:15,344
- Oh, this is hard to believe,
Pete. Hard to believe.

421
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:19,287
All right, let's have it.
Spit it out.

422
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,291
<i>Allez, Pete.</i>

423
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:42,137
He says the soldier's been making a lot
of promises to Charmaine.

424
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,237
- Is that all he said?
- The rest is poetry.

425
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:48,045
- Well, omit the poetry.
Say, "Omit the poetry."

426
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,758
- What's this?
- He says she's an innocent lamb.

427
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,295
Charmaine?

428
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,831
Think fast. Think fast.

429
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,400
Tell him I know
she's an innocent child.

430
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,562
That she's one of the most charming
and respectable, virtuous ladies...

431
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:10,196
I've ever had the privilege
of meeting.

432
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:12,867
- And ask him how much he wants.
- How much what?

433
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:17,141
Money, you pie brow! Money! What else
do you think he wants?

434
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,512
It's only a game. Go on.

435
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:23,519
No, no.

436
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:34,026
- More lamb?
- No, he wants the fella to marry the girl.

437
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,258
<i>And he wants 500 francs.</i>

438
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,562
Well, now we're
getting somewhere.

439
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,569
All right, offer him 300 francs...

440
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:44,607
and tell him he can have any son-in-law
he wants out of the whole outfit.

441
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:02,651
G.H. Q! G.H. Q

442
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,661
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

443
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:13,233
- What does that say, Aldrich?
- It's a formal complaint.
The mayor drew it up for him.

444
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,998
Think fast. Think fast.

445
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,374
Tell him we apologize
and he can have the 500 francs.

446
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,559
<i>The money's all right, but it has to be
a certain man. Which man? Quel homme?</i>

447
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:52,601
- What is this, Quirt?
- I don't know. I didn't quite
catch the drift myself.

448
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,940
- You been around with Charmaine?
- Charmaine? Char...

449
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:58,276
Cut the act! You knew she was my girl
and couldn't keep your hands off her.

450
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:01,545
- Suppose it's true, what are
you gonna do about it?
- What am I gonna do about it?

451
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,552
Yeah?

452
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,688
I'm not gonna do a thing.

453
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,958
It's regulations, Quirt.

454
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:20,560
A formal charge has been lodged against you
and my hands are tied. I'm trapped.

455
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:24,163
If I let the old man go to headquarters,
you know the law. They'll hang you.

456
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,368
It breaks my heart to see
this happen, Quirt...

457
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,604
but you are about
to become a bridegroom.

458
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,612
This is a frame-up,
and you know it!

459
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,773
This old man just wants money.
He ain't got a thing on me.

460
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:36,580
I haven't done anything with Charmaine
but teach her a couple of songs.

461
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,587
What's so funny?

462
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:42,625
Oh, Quirt. With your reputation in
this army, who's gonna believe that?

463
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,887
I'll take my chances.
Let him go to headquarters.

464
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,361
Don't be a hay shaker, Quirt.

465
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,659
What chance would you have
before an army court-martial...

466
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,997
when 10 majors start
an iron ball rolling?

467
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:56,300
Ten majors back in Paris are gonna see to
it that nobody has any fun but themselves.

468
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,671
You haven't got a chance, Quirt,
and you know it!

469
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:02,109
Aldrich, escort Sergeant Quirt
down to the tavern.

470
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:06,376
And tell Charmaine I'm giving away in
marriage the handsomest sergeant in the war.

471
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:10,579
And, Quirt! You arrived just in time
with the replacements.

472
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:15,284
You've saved the day. The marines have
landed and the situation is well in hand.

473
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:20,125
We're going to decorate you.
We're gonna let you hold the bag!

474
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,791
Kiper! Get down to the manure pile
and pick up the mayor.

475
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,233
- Dust him off and bring him back here.
- Aye, sir.

476
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:28,965
I wanna witness
this ceremony myself.

477
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,085
Good morning, boys.

478
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:47,854
I'm in the clear because she'll explain
she don't want this.

479
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,825
No good, Quirt. In France,
the papa runs the family.

480
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:20,656
All right, wise guys, line up!
One at a time! You first!

481
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:25,024
No, you don't, Colonel! Let's go.

482
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,709
- What is he talkin' about?
- Why, your relatives, Quirt.

483
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,540
Pete must have sent out
invitations a week ago.

484
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,409
Hi.

485
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,609
Well, he's never gonna get away
with this little game...

486
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,279
because as soon as Charmaine...

487
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,860
Married?
You wanna get married?

488
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:11,662
Yes, sir. And I understand
you can give me permission.

489
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,795
- Who's the girl?
- Nicole Bouchard.

490
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:18,204
Nicole Bouchard. Does she
live here in Bar-le-Duc?

491
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:21,141
Her father has that farm on the hill
where the road turns into Bar-le-Duc.

492
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:25,477
Mm-hmm. Lewisohn.

493
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:28,073
Aren't you the boy
that had the mumps?

494
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:30,983
- Measles, sir.
- Oh.

495
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,784
But you've been here only eight days.
Did you know her before?

496
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,950
No, sir.

497
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:39,495
Well, even in a war, eight days is
an awful short time.

498
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,496
Uh, you sure you wanna do this?

499
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:44,066
Oh, yes, sir. I'm sure.

500
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:47,501
<i>- Mm-hmm. Hundred to one
she's only after your allotment.</i>

501
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:51,472
- Oh, no, sir. I don't think so.
- You don't, huh?

502
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:54,100
- How old are you?
- Twenty-two, sir.

503
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,236
Mm-hmm. Well,
it's your life...

504
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:59,440
and now more than ever
you've got every right to mess it up.

505
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,745
Uh, have you talked
to her parents?

506
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:05,049
<i>- No, sir. Not yet.
- Brigade runner.</i>

507
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,316
- Company commander? Orders, sir.
- Here.

508
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:09,324
Please initial.

509
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,761
- Luck, sir.
- Thank you.

510
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:21,067
Well, Lewisohn, one thing about the army...
decisions are all made for you.

511
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,469
We're moving in immediately,
so this'll have to wait till we get back.

512
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,474
- Yes, sir.
- Lipinsky.

513
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,544
<i>- Yes, sir?
- On your way, boy. On your way.</i>

514
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:32,206
We're moving in. Pass the word
to all patrol commanders to be
standing in heavy pack in 30.

515
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,216
Camions at the crossroads
with ammunition.

516
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,287
And tell Quirt to salvage
all rations in the square.

517
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,184
Oh, wait.

518
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:41,883
Wait, wait!

519
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:44,552
Don't tell Quirt we're going in.

520
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,686
<i>We'll marry him to Charmaine...</i>

521
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:50,324
And march the blushing
bridegroom off to war.

522
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,493
- Shove.
- Aye, sir.

523
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,806
Attention!

524
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:02,373
- Attention!
- Attention!

525
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:06,539
- Attention!
- Hello, Flagg. Haven't you
received those orders yet?

526
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:09,914
I come into town for a staff conference
and find the whole shebang asleep.

527
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,454
Just got the order, General. We'll get off
on time. Never missed a train in my life.

528
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,492
- I don't see how you do it.
Davis, where's that map?
- Map.

529
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,652
- Map.
- Map, sir.

530
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,956
See here, Flagg.

531
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,068
Here's where you're going in.

532
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:29,434
Here's the line.
Corps wants that line straightened out.

533
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:33,100
Your men can do it. They're a bunch of
tramps, but they're good at that.

534
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,804
- Individualists, General. Individualists.
- Yes, so I've heard.

535
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:39,780
That's why they picked
another job for you.

536
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,908
They want you to bring out
a German officer.

537
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,384
Oh, don't say that.
Don't break my heart.

538
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:50,925
I knew you had a bowl of black crepe up
your sleeve when you came through that door.

539
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,961
What?

540
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:56,260
Oh, yeah.

541
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,267
Flagg, we hear there's
gonna be a big push coming up.

542
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,496
If we can confirm it,
we can save thousands of lives.

543
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:05,540
If your men bring me back
one German officer in good condition...

544
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:07,610
I'll send the whole company
back for a month's rest.

545
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:09,644
I'll do better than that.

546
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:12,613
I'll give you eight days
in any hotel in Paris.

547
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:16,982
You're an awful bum, Flagg.
Otherwise, I'd put you on staff.

548
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,487
And carry a map?
No, thank you.

549
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,819
Yeah.

550
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:25,360
You know 'em. You know.
Cold steel. Let him have it.

551
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,362
Gangway!

552
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,955
<i>What is this? A wedding party?</i>

553
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:37,064
Flagg, you're not
getting married, are you?

554
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,335
Not this time, sir.
Sergeant Quirt.

555
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:58,989
Quirt, you're the last man
in the world I'd expect to get married.

556
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,427
- Me too, sir.
- Flagg, what is this?

557
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,863
Some sort of case error?
Charges of some sort?

558
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,958
Oh, no.
Not at all, sir.

559
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:09,197
Sergeant Quirt here expressed a desire
to marry the innkeeper's daughter.

560
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,500
<i>And I saw no reason
to stand in the way.</i>

561
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:14,201
General, I'd like to have you
meet the bride.

562
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,505
<i>The future Mrs. Quirt.</i>

563
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,841
<i>Charmaine, General Cokely.</i>

564
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:22,145
I hope you'll be
very happy, mademoiselle.

565
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,219
Are you really a general?

566
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:30,153
Well, yes. Uh, uh, don't waste time.
Get on with it.

567
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,784
Start the ceremony.

568
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,726
Do you, Charmaine...

569
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,200
take this man
for your husband?

570
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:44,330
Quirt, I'm sorry that I won't be able to
wait and kiss the bride.

571
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,881
- You have about 20 minutes, Flagg.
- Aye, aye, sir.

572
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:54,176
You won't have much time
for a honeymoon, Quirt.

573
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:57,252
But if you bring me back one German officer
in good condition...

574
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,845
I'll see you get
a whole month's leave.

575
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,424
Remember, Flagg.
Twenty minutes!

576
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,459
<i>Gangway.!</i>

577
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,223
<i>Allez, allez.
Come over here.</i>

578
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:10,458
- Do you, Charmaine...
- She does not!

579
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,966
I do not. We do not.

580
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,061
So we're going
in 20 minutes, huh?

581
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,400
And you were gonna tie me up
before I knew anything about it.

582
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,975
And I suppose if I don't marry her,
you're gonna lock me up.

583
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,910
If you think you can take your men in
without a first sergeant, lock me up.

584
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:27,381
I'd like to see you take this bunch of
babies across that last two miles...

585
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,179
without a top sergeant.

586
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,220
If this sergeant goes in, he goes in single,
so you better make up your mind.

587
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:35,348
- I won't lock you up. I'll turn
you over to headquarters.
- That suits me fine!

588
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:39,019
Who are you kidding? Let us have
some more of that ceremony.

589
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:42,097
Do you, Charmaine,
take this man...

590
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:45,360
- Nobody's taking this man.
Let's go down to headquarters.
- They'll hang you!

591
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,402
Sure, they will.
And what about you?

592
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,438
If you take this outfit
up front without me...

593
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:53,771
a day after they hang me, wherever I am,
I'll be seeing you!

594
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,310
Do you, Charmaine, take this man...

595
00:51:56,413 --> 00:52:00,440
All right, turn it off, man.
Turn it off, turn it off.

596
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:03,485
All right, skunk. You got me.

597
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:07,045
- You win. Hit the deck.
- Now you're talkin'.

598
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:13,223
Sorry, Charmaine. I can't
marry you tonight. I got work to do.

599
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:16,230
And if I never see you again...

600
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,665
well, I guess I never see you again.

601
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:20,793
So long, kid.

602
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,462
All right, you ugly sons of ugly fathers!

603
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:27,236
Pass the word for inspection in five minutes!
And things better be shipshape.

604
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,716
And don't let Quirt
do all the work!

605
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,981
- All right, Kiper, Moran!
- Aye, aye!

606
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:41,522
Kiper, pick up my battle gear.

607
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:45,185
- Lipinsky, take this map there too.
- Yes, sir.

608
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,296
Yeah, sure, they're married,
they're married.

609
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:52,493
Look. We're fighting a war
with Germany.

610
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:57,096
I don't give a hoot whether they're married
or not. Now, go on. Beat it. Get out of here.

611
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,969
<i>Why don't you...</i>

612
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,236
- Please...
- What does he want?

613
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:05,610
- Somebody swiped his hat.
- Get out of here, you...

614
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,718
Now, look, uh, Moran.
We're going to Aurignac.

615
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,843
When those extra rations
come through, bring 'em on up.

616
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,455
And try to get those kids a couple of
hot meals while we're up there.

617
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,490
Aye, aye, sir.

618
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:41,349
I'm sorry, Charmaine...

619
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:43,543
but I need that sergeant.

620
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:48,015
You should have taken me
to Paris with you, Captain.

621
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:50,524
Yeah, maybe I should have.

622
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:53,061
But I brought something
back for you...

623
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,063
like I promised.

624
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:58,657
<i>It's a costume. Bought off a gal
in the Folies Bergeres.</i>

625
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:00,827
The only costume in the show.

626
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:04,496
I thought I'd get to see you in it...

627
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:07,166
but I guess I won't now.

628
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,477
Well, kiss me good-bye.

629
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,920
Now look, kid. Forget me.

630
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,958
Forget all about me and Quirt.

631
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,755
'Cause chances are you'll never
see either of us again.

632
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:29,524
<i>I'll never forget you, Capitaine.</i>

633
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:34,035
<i>Well, maybe if I get leave, Charmaine...</i>

634
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:36,071
You never can tell.

635
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,040
It's a lousy war, kid.

636
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,677
But it's the only one we've got.

637
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:18,469
<i>Good luck.</i>

638
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:21,675
You noncoms think you can march
these kids out of here, don't you?

639
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,719
- Yeah, yeah.
- Well, make sure you march 'em back alive.

640
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,917
'Cause if you don't, I'll know where to
find you every decoration day.

641
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:31,152
Anything else, Sergeant?

642
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:34,525
Yeah, keep that out of there.
Move out.

643
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,171
- What'd you say?
- Nothing, sir.

644
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,173
- You said something.
- I didn't say anything.

645
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:48,210
Talking back to a noncommissioned officer,
huh? Pennick, come here.

646
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:52,042
Throw him in the brink. And don't prefer
charges until we get back. Get him out of here!

647
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,446
- All right.
- All right, fellas.

648
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,814
- I thought I made you a cook.
- But we're moving up, sir.

649
00:55:56,953 --> 00:56:00,354
That's why I made you a cook. Get out
of here! Fill them up here. Let's go.

650
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,287
Fill it out!

651
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:20,370
<i>Forward, march.!
Hup, two, three, four.</i>

652
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:40,760
Come on! Get them hokeypokey wagons
out of here, will ya!

653
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:43,765
The marines are moving up!
Come on.

654
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,628
- Go on!
- Hey, Grandpop. How far to Gettysburg?

655
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:51,206
You'll have to ask one
of the M.P. S at the crossroads.

656
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:54,435
We're not allowed
to give out information.

657
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,477
Gettysburg?

658
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:00,473
Grandpop!

659
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:04,018
Company, halt!

660
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:06,179
"L" Company all present
and accounted for...

661
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:08,517
and I repeat,
all present, Captain Flagg.

662
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:13,187
All right, Quirt.
Come on. Let's shove off.

663
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,366
Right platoon, march!

664
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:21,869
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

665
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:23,996
Forward step!

666
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,353
Harrish, rifle!

667
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,356
Bullet rifle!

668
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,483
Identification!
That rifle!

669
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:36,732
Little boys! Little boys.

670
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:41,896
<i>Little boys.!</i>

671
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:45,064
Little boys.

672
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:24,747
Pinky, come here.

673
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:42,052
- All right, son.
- Bad?

674
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:44,531
He was crawling on the embankment
by the railroad stations.

675
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:47,501
Somebody threw him a potato masher.
Give me one them dope sticks.

676
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:50,037
- Those are quarter-grain, Captain.
- Good.

677
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,300
Here, take two of these now, son.

678
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:54,774
I'm gonna put the rest of these
in your pocket.

679
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,778
Take one every three hours
until they carry you out.

680
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,280
What if I take them all
when your back is turned?

681
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,318
Go ahead.
That's your business.

682
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:07,253
Don't be a sucker, kid.
You got a free ticket home.

683
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,918
Come on. Sleep, boy.

684
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:14,326
Go on and sleep.

685
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:19,026
You're in a nice, quiet deep hole now
where the shells can't reach you.

686
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,213
The rations are in
and the men are fed, Captain Flagg.

687
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:42,951
- Thanks, Quirt.
- It was pretty rugged
coming out of that ravine.

688
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:45,493
Sometimes I think
you're trying to lose me.

689
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:52,258
Mind if I take a look around?
I'd like to see some of this war.

690
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:55,201
All I've been up to now
is a lousy bakery wagon.

691
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:58,000
Get your head blown off
if that's what you want.

692
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,473
But go bury yourself
while you're about it!

693
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:03,739
- The burial detail is in for the night.
- Ten-hut!

694
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:07,616
- Captain Flagg?
- No!

695
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,414
- Captain Flagg?
- Hmm? Yeah.

696
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:18,824
Lieutenant Cunningham reporting, sir.

697
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:23,197
- First time up?
- Yes, sir.

698
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,165
Holy sweet jumpin'Joseph!

699
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:32,833
And with spurs!

700
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:36,241
Are you goin' to a masquerade ball
disguised as an officer...

701
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:39,314
or are you just trying to save the snipers
the trouble of spotting you with a glass?

702
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:42,043
<i>- I see what you mean, sir.
- Oh, you do?</i>

703
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,711
What do they teach you guys
at those officers' colleges?

704
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,415
<i>How to shine your shoes
and press your pants?</i>

705
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:49,787
I'll do anything you will, sir.

706
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:54,693
Why, if it ain't Frank Merriwell.

707
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:57,766
Well, I'll tell you what
we're gonna do with you, Frankie.

708
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:00,893
We're gonna let you
pitch tomorrow.

709
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,665
Now go on over and sit down
and keep your eyes open.

710
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:11,907
<i>Headquarters, Company "L."
Yeah. "L.!"</i>

711
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:16,383
"L." "L!"
"A," "B," "C," "D,"

712
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:18,146
"E," "F," "L."

713
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:22,054
"L!" "L!"
"L" as in Brooklyn, you stupid...

714
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:25,286
General Copley. Yes, sir.

715
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:27,362
- Captain Flagg.
- The old man?

716
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,931
- Yes, sir.
- Flagg here, sir.

717
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,523
- Hello, Flagg?
- Yes, General.

718
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:35,103
Yes, I know they're back
in the railway station.

719
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,263
Our crossfire
couldn't keep 'em out.

720
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,274
It'll take a whole brigade action to
keep them outta there for good.

721
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:43,277
Huh? What's that, sir?

722
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,939
Staff officers? Where?

723
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:49,211
Louder, sir. Louder.
I can't hear you.

724
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:51,218
Well, now you're
too loud, sir.

725
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:55,416
All right. Go ahead. I got a map...
I got a map right in front of me.

726
01:04:55,524 --> 01:05:00,791
Yeah? Farmhouse behind a gray stable,
100 yards to the east?

727
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,388
Uh-huh. Yes, sir.

728
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:07,230
All right, I'll get somebody
through tonight, sir. Yes, sir. Yes.

729
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:09,736
- Same to you, sir.
- Staff officers, huh?

730
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:13,297
Mm. Yeah, they got a report
from an observation post.

731
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,572
Staff officers are in that farmhouse
behind the gray stable.

732
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,214
- Lipinsky!
- Yes, sir?

733
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:22,477
- Get Lieutenant Moore.
- Wait a minute!

734
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,713
You're not gonna send Moore.
This is a job for a man, not a boy.

735
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:28,654
You give him Moran. We'll get you a Kraut
and we'll all go home.

736
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,727
Quirt... Quirt,
I'm not keeping you here out of love.

737
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,727
These men have to be fed.

738
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:37,287
You're the only one that can run the rations
down the ravine under enemy gunfire.

739
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,096
- Now, Lipinsky, hit the deck!
- Yes, sir.

740
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,211
Ready, Mr. Moore?

741
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:00,789
We're ready, sir.

742
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,450
Let's go.

743
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,360
- Any sign of Moore and his party?
- No, sir.

744
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,438
Let's have a look.

745
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:54,069
<i>Are they overdue, sir?</i>

746
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:58,306
<i>I'm afraid they are, boy.
They should've been back an hour ago.</i>

747
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:10,625
Relief.

748
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:19,130
Oh, it's you. You still wanna
get married?

749
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:21,032
For the record, sir?

750
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:24,334
For the record. There's nothing
I can do about it now.

751
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,772
Yes, sir.

752
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,668
Mm-hmm.

753
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:34,716
I almost got married once.
Once. Hmph. Twenty-five times.

754
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:38,149
<i>China, Philippines,
Santa Domingo...</i>

755
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:40,882
even New York City...

756
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,890
wherever there was women.

757
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:44,892
But I was a wise guy.

758
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:47,292
<i>I was saving myself.</i>

759
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:52,624
From what? From what?

760
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:16,283
<i>To you I give.</i>

761
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:20,761
<i>All my love.</i>

762
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:25,633
<i>All my life.</i>

763
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:30,264
<i>I promise.</i>

764
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:34,866
<i>All my love.</i>

765
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,614
- News of Moore?
- Nothing.

766
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:18,919
No sign of the college boy?

767
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,623
Does he win his letter,
Captain Flagg?

768
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:28,720
The chocolate soldier
who forgot to come back?

769
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,129
Or maybe the Germans captured him
and they get to go home.

770
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:33,997
<i>Is that the way the game
is played, Captain Flagg?</i>

771
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:36,333
- Take it easy, kid.
- Let him talk.

772
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:40,067
That's right. Let the 30-day wonder
speak his piece.

773
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:43,043
Why don't you get off
the bench and play, Captain Flagg?

774
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:45,375
Why don't you get in the game?

775
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:49,577
We can use a hero. There are
two minutes left, we can use a hero.

776
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:52,711
What price glory now, Captain Flagg?

777
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:13,669
- Quirt, you wanna win your letter?
- I wanna go home.

778
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:16,244
The shortest way home
is right out there.

779
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:20,775
<i>- Cunningham?
- Yes, sir.</i>

780
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:24,751
You're in command here.
Look, at exactly 5:10...

781
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:27,549
- Check your watch, see what you've got.
- 5:03, sir.

782
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:30,250
Make it 5:02.
At exactly 5:10...

783
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:32,589
you throw everything we have right at
the railway station...

784
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:35,687
and send the first platoon down through
the ravine to start firing from there.

785
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,698
Make 'em think we're
comin' through that way.

786
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,200
Don't send anybody in,
and don't lose anybody, you got it?

787
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,270
- Aye, aye, sir.
- All right.

788
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,512
Anything you want me
to tell Charmaine?

789
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:55,072
Yeah. Tell her
you're a friend of mine.

790
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,620
When this rat race is over,
are we going back to Bar-le-Duc?

791
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:09,452
Quirt, I'm gonna do
something for you.

792
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:11,924
- I'm gonna get you off the hook.
- What hook?

793
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:16,225
After we get this Kraut, I'm gonna have you
transferred to another outfit...

794
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,267
so you won't have to go back to
Bar-le-Duc and face the music.

795
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:22,428
- What music, Flagg?
- Wedding music.

796
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:29,176
One campaign at a time, Flagg.

797
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:32,679
Don't lay out the Bar-le-Duc campaign
till we get this one done.

798
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:49,486
- No guts, huh?
- Brains.

799
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,854
Don't do me any favors, Flagg...

800
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,789
'cause I've been thinking
about Charmaine, just like you...

801
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,951
and I'm seeing things different.

802
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,393
Back in Bar-le-Duc...

803
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:24,523
I thought she was just another dame
in a long line of dames.

804
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,567
But I must have been wrong...

805
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:29,466
'cause I keep thinking
about her all the time.

806
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:32,633
Something's got into me.

807
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:36,837
Maybe it's running those rations down
the ravine, I don't know.

808
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:41,609
But, you know, if you tried
to unload her on me now, I'd take her...

809
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:45,312
wedding, Cognac Pete,
relatives and all.

810
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,981
Just like you, only you
haven't got a chance.

811
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:51,685
What makes you...
What makes you think she'd see you...

812
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:53,887
after the way
you walked out on her?

813
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:57,523
She'd see me, all right.
She's crazy about me.

814
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:00,534
Told me I was the greatest
soldier she ever met.

815
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:06,097
She used to say she wished the whole outfit
would move away and leave us in peace.

816
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:09,234
She doesn't know enough
English to say that...

817
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:11,244
and you don't know
enough French.

818
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:14,315
The language I was talking,
she understood.

819
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:27,088
What are you waiting for?

820
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:49,642
<i>I think they said
a live German officer.</i>

821
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:02,590
A cook. A lousy cook.

822
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:19,173
I am Colonel.

823
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:24,085
- Is he an officer?
- Officer? He's a colonel.

824
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:28,748
A colonel. Colonel, am I glad
to see you.

825
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:32,816
Let's go, Colonel.
Come on. Let's move, Colonel.

826
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:01,922
Come on, Colonel. Let's go.

827
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:09,456
- The colonel ain't going.
- Why couldn't it have been you?

828
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,700
Oh, no.

829
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:28,248
- Hey, Flagg!
- What?

830
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,011
- I'm wounded.
- You what?

831
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:32,552
- I got hit.
- Why, you dirty...

832
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,349
Wouldn't you give
a million bucks for that?

833
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:36,424
Ain't that the prettiest
little punch you ever saw?

834
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:38,459
In and out without
touching the bone.

835
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,188
- You crook! You stuck
your leg out on purpose.
- I never did, Captain.

836
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:44,197
- You know you did!
- Come on, Flagg. I got a date with a lady.

837
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,267
Oh, you...

838
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:52,565
<i>Oh, a casualty.</i>

839
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:54,938
- Everything all right, Cunningham?
- Yes, sir.

840
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:57,910
Except some general has been
calling about a German officer.

841
01:16:58,013 --> 01:16:59,708
Wants to know if we got one.

842
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:03,774
Well, tell him if he calls again,
we got some, but they're all dead.

843
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:06,513
- Hmm, bb guns, Captain?
- Didy pins.

844
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,318
- Vaccination.
- It'll be a miracle if he ever recovers.

845
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:11,984
I suppose you think you're gonna
go back to Bar-le-Duc.

846
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:14,119
Holsen, tell him there's nothing
the matter with him.

847
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:16,060
He doesn't have to go back
to the base hospital.

848
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:18,598
Tell him you can fix him up right here.
Go on, tell him.

849
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:21,760
- You been crawling in the mud with this?
- You bet your sweet life.

850
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,668
- Can you walk?
- That depends on what I see.

851
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:26,707
You don't mean to tell me
you're gonna send him back?

852
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,605
This man's got to
get out of here, Captain Flagg.

853
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:31,577
Sergeant, get over to sick bay at once,
get a tetanus shot, then get out of here.

854
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:37,948
This is breaking my heart!
But duty calls.

855
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:40,920
Oh, it brings tears to my eyes...

856
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:44,220
to say farewell to
my old company commander.

857
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:47,495
I don't see how
I can go through with it.

858
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:50,497
- You better make it snappy,
or that door'll be locked.
- What door?

859
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:53,261
- Charmaine's.
- Are you wounded too, Captain Flagg?

860
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:57,702
No, but inside of 10 minutes, I'll be
wounded, bumped off or have that officer.

861
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:03,210
Do me a favor, will you? Get yourself
killed just once. Just to please me.

862
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:08,112
<i>Well, as we say in France,
au revoir. Oh!</i>

863
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:12,743
Captain Flagg,
how about some company?

864
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:15,186
The air by that railroad embankment
is full of flying steel.

865
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:17,622
- A green man wouldn't have a chance.
- Are you going?

866
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:21,093
- I got personal and private reasons.
- If you're going, that suits me.

867
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:25,030
- Can you crawl on your belly?
- Captain, I've been crawling
under trains for five years.

868
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:29,502
<i>I was a locomotive engineer on
the Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabam.</i>

869
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:31,731
You oughta see
a few railroad wrecks.

870
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,809
I had three engines
shot out from under me last year.

871
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:39,609
- Cunningham, I think you'll do.
- You know I'll do.

872
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:47,980
- Captain Flagg, I've got one!
I've got a German officer.
- Let's have a look.

873
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:51,389
Throw some light on him.
Well, let's have a look. Well...

874
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:56,526
Boys, boys,
a German lieutenant.

875
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:58,963
He didn't wait for us to
go get him. He came on over.

876
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:02,230
You are the sweetest thing
I've seen since Charmaine.

877
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:06,535
Kiper. Kiper,
take good care of him for me.

878
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,666
And whatever you do,
don't frighten him to death.

879
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:11,371
He's our ticket of leave.
We're going home.

880
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:15,746
- Easy, easy! Easy.
- Come on, honey. Come on.

881
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:19,514
Lewisohn. Lewisohn, I'm gonna see to it
that you're decorated for this.

882
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:21,919
And I insist upon being
best man at your wedding.

883
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:25,618
And besides, I personally
am going to give you 10 francs.

884
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:27,695
Thank you, sir.

885
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:43,106
Captain Flagg.
Captain Flagg!

886
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:46,180
Yes, son. Yes, son.
Yes, son.

887
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:47,873
- Captain Flagg?
- Come on!

888
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:49,848
Please, please, stop the bleeding.

889
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,509
- All right, son.
- Please.

890
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,918
- All right.
- Please, Captain Flagg.

891
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:58,684
- Please, Captain Flagg?
- All right.

892
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:03,595
- Please.
- You're gonna be all right, boy.

893
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:07,327
You're gonna be all right. All right.

894
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:38,493
<i>Company "L."</i>

895
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,898
Captain?

896
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:44,130
Captain Flagg? Skipper?

897
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,842
Flagg here, sir.

898
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:00,183
Yes, sir.

899
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:02,188
Now?

900
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:05,851
But we got your officer
for you, sir. Right here.

901
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:08,259
You said if we got
an officer, we could all go...

902
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:12,399
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

903
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:16,828
We'll send him back to you, sir.

904
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:19,236
I got the order.

905
01:21:19,341 --> 01:21:21,468
Aye, aye, sir.

906
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:28,412
We're ordered to take
the railway station and hold it.

907
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:31,007
- But, Captain, they said...
- I know what they said.

908
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:34,520
- They said if we got him a Kraut...
- This is what they're saying now!

909
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:37,592
- Everybody goes. Lipinsky, hit the deck.
- Yes, sir.

910
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:39,250
- Moran, first platoon.
- Aye, aye, sir.

911
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:41,158
- Ferguson, second platoon.
- Aye, aye, sir.

912
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:44,164
- Gowdy, you're new top soldier.
- Aye, aye, sir.

913
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:46,564
All right, you overpaid,
underfed mud guppies...

914
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:48,829
rise and shine and hit the deck!

915
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:52,168
We're moving out!
Come on! Everybody! Hit the deck!

916
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:54,242
Holsen.

917
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:26,196
- Are you Irish?
- I am.

918
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:51,357
Come on, everybody!
All together!

919
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:53,290
<i>Come on, men!</i>

920
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:25,982
<i>Poor kid. A very tragic thing
happened to her.</i>

921
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:31,122
- Huh?
- She and an American sergeant.
Terribly in love.

922
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:35,168
About to be married when he was shipped
up to the front. Never heard from again.

923
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:53,218
- Moran.
- Good evening, Major.

924
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,556
- Sergeant Quirt.
- Shh.

925
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:58,558
- What's up, Quirt?
- The outfit in?

926
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:01,322
No, they're coming in tonight.
What'd you do, jump the hospital?

927
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:04,626
You bet your sweet life I did. Now do me
a favor, get me an American uniform.

928
01:25:04,732 --> 01:25:07,496
I got two M.P. S on my tail,
I don't wanna meet 'em in these.

929
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,661
Why should I stick
my neck out for you?

930
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:12,569
You can't get in trouble. I was wounded.
I ain't in my right mind.

931
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:16,337
- When were you ever?
- Look, I was wounded. I got Aspasia.

932
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,537
My name is Field Marshal
von Hindenburg...

933
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:21,945
and I'm looking for a carload of pants
that was lost in a shipment.

934
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:25,042
Now get me an American uniform, will ya?
And don't tell anybody.

935
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:27,951
Thanks a lot.

936
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:03,390
<i>Thanks.</i>

937
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:08,955
- Sergeant, you're back!
- You're darn right I'm back.

938
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:10,963
They had me dying in a hospital...

939
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:13,966
but the thought of you gave me strength
enough to come crawling back here.

940
01:26:14,068 --> 01:26:17,469
And what do I find when I get here?
You waiting for me brokenhearted?

941
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:21,303
I should say not. You've been working
both sides of the ocean.

942
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:25,243
<i>Playing footsies with our boy allies.</i>

943
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:28,042
My foot.
Whose hat is that?

944
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:33,087
And you, Sergeant?

945
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:35,622
You never looked at another woman
when you were away, huh?

946
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:38,556
You're darn right I didn't.

947
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:42,118
There were no women.

948
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:45,529
That's right. There was only Flagg,
and I'm the first one back.

949
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:47,863
- Come here.
- Stay away from me!

950
01:26:47,969 --> 01:26:51,427
- What's the matter?
- You don't remember the way you left, do you?

951
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:55,737
"I do not. She doesn't not.
We doesn't not. The marriage is off.

952
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:59,142
<i>If I never see you again,
I'll never see you again!"</i>

953
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:06,477
I guess you're right, Charmaine.

954
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:10,490
After the way I acted,
I don't deserve a second chance.

955
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:13,060
Turn around. Come on.

956
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:16,722
You know, all the time
I was out there...

957
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,890
I kept thinking...

958
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,798
"She could've been mine."

959
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:25,532
That's what kept me going
through all the shot and the shell.

960
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:29,235
Maybe it could still be...
me and Charmaine.

961
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:32,780
And then when I was wounded, and I was
lying in the hospital under ether...

962
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,508
they tell me that
I kept calling your name.

963
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:39,348
"Charmaine. Charmaine.

964
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:43,754
Forgive me, Charmaine."

965
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:45,883
- Yeah.
- You were wounded?

966
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:50,260
Just in the leg.

967
01:27:59,507 --> 01:28:02,943
That's more like it.
There was a couple of other things...

968
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:06,172
I thought of in the hospital, only I
don't know how to say them in French.

969
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:09,512
<i>That must be Moran with my uniform.</i>

970
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:13,519
- Uniform?
- Yeah. I'm just wearing
pajamas. Come on in, slug.

971
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:19,715
Well, l-I say, l...
I beg your pardon, Major...

972
01:28:19,827 --> 01:28:21,818
<i>- Quirt.
- Captain Wickham here.</i>

973
01:28:21,929 --> 01:28:25,160
I thought... Well, l-I mean,
I had no idea...

974
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:29,532
Well, don't get any ideas, Captain, because
this young lady happens to be my fiancée.

975
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:31,537
Fiancée?

976
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:35,370
Well, as you Americans say
in, uh, baseball...

977
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:38,968
I, uh... I appear to be offside.

978
01:28:41,749 --> 01:28:44,479
- Fiancée, eh?
- Yeah, yeah, sure. Why not?

979
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:47,918
Now wait a minute. Does it mean the same
thing in English that it mean in French?

980
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:50,456
- It means you don't go with
anybody else. Come here.
- And what about you?

981
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:52,890
<i>Never mind about me. Come on in, Moran.</i>

982
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:54,962
Wickham.

983
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:59,558
I, uh... I'm awfully sorry...

984
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:03,967
but, uh, your fiancée has my cap.

985
01:29:09,544 --> 01:29:14,504
Thank you. Well, uh,
congratulations again.

986
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:22,185
- Evening.
- Good evening.

987
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:33,899
Good night.

988
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:45,342
<i>Now what do you...
Oh, Moran. Yeah.</i>

989
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:21,141
Charmaine. Charmaine!

990
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:25,447
<i>Charmaine!</i>

991
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:30,256
Charmaine, is she here?

992
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:37,430
<i>- You still got a mayor in this town?
- Mayor? Oh, the mayor. Oui.</i>

993
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:40,365
Well, go down and wake him up.

994
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:44,029
<i>- I wanna marry your daughter.
- Oh, mariage.</i>

995
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:46,606
<i>Mmm. Mariage.
Wedding ring. Comprends?</i>

996
01:30:46,707 --> 01:30:51,440
No.

997
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:57,476
<i>- Avec moi. Me. Moi.
- You?</i>

998
01:30:59,754 --> 01:31:01,585
Break it up. Break it up.

999
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:04,089
Go on down and get the mayor.

1000
01:31:04,192 --> 01:31:07,923
- I wanna get married tonight.
- Charmaine! Charmaine!

1001
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:48,627
Captain of your heart, am I?
Well, you know something?

1002
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:53,002
Tonight I'm gonna believe that. I wanna
believe it, and I'm gonna believe it.

1003
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:56,702
<i>- Come here.
- Captain, mon papa.</i>

1004
01:31:56,811 --> 01:32:00,804
Well, if you mean Pete,
he's my papa too.

1005
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:03,110
I just sent him down to get the mayor.

1006
01:32:03,217 --> 01:32:06,653
We're gonna get married, you and me.

1007
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:10,747
And the United States government is
gonna send us to Paris on our honeymoon.

1008
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:14,316
- What do you think of that?
- What about your wife?

1009
01:32:15,897 --> 01:32:17,831
You didn't believe that, did you?

1010
01:32:19,233 --> 01:32:23,260
No. But...

1011
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:27,398
I did believe you did not
want to marry me.

1012
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:30,068
I'm sick of wandering.

1013
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:33,146
I wanna sit down in one place
and never get up.

1014
01:32:34,982 --> 01:32:36,882
That's today.

1015
01:32:36,984 --> 01:32:39,646
Tomorrow you...
you'll feel different.

1016
01:32:39,754 --> 01:32:43,815
- I'm betting against tomorrow.
- What?

1017
01:32:43,925 --> 01:32:47,656
- Nothing. Do you love me?
- Yes.

1018
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:50,162
That's the right answer.

1019
01:32:54,969 --> 01:32:56,937
Are you through?

1020
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:04,067
Whatever it is... Whatever it is,
go tell Cunningham!

1021
01:33:04,178 --> 01:33:07,306
That little girl...
the one Lewisohn was... she's outside.

1022
01:33:09,016 --> 01:33:11,644
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Talk to her.

1023
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:16,023
Send her in.

1024
01:33:19,694 --> 01:33:22,754
- I gotta talk to this girl.
- I understand.

1025
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:45,746
- Captain Flagg, my name is Nicole.
- I know. I know.

1026
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:50,888
So you're the girl.
Lewisohn told me about you.

1027
01:33:50,992 --> 01:33:54,189
He wanted to marry you,
but according to regulations...

1028
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:56,763
he had to get permission
from his commanding officer.

1029
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:59,697
<i>- You understand?
- Oui. Yes.</i>

1030
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,394
- Is he...
- Yes. Yes.

1031
01:34:02,503 --> 01:34:05,836
Yeah, he did a...
he did a brave thing.

1032
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:10,069
And I thought he was too young
to get married.

1033
01:34:11,846 --> 01:34:14,906
But when you think of him...

1034
01:34:15,016 --> 01:34:17,109
please think this.

1035
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:20,517
A lot of boys come over here
and the only thing that happens to them...

1036
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:23,647
is what happened to him out there.

1037
01:34:23,758 --> 01:34:25,749
But he had more.

1038
01:34:26,794 --> 01:34:28,762
He met you.

1039
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:32,366
Thank you.

1040
01:34:48,549 --> 01:34:51,211
Oh, I'm sick of this war.

1041
01:34:51,318 --> 01:34:53,912
I'm off war for life.

1042
01:34:54,021 --> 01:34:56,319
No more for me.

1043
01:34:56,424 --> 01:35:00,258
It was all right when you had 30 or 40
men in the hills that knew their jobs.

1044
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:04,092
But now there are...
there are so many little boys.

1045
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:08,032
Little boys who have no business
being here at all.

1046
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:17,571
You know, Charmaine...

1047
01:35:17,678 --> 01:35:22,638
if ever they finish this war,
I ain't even going home.

1048
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:27,178
I'm gonna stay right here...

1049
01:35:27,288 --> 01:35:29,779
drink Papa's wine...

1050
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:32,791
and have a lot of little kids
hopping around the floor.

1051
01:35:33,861 --> 01:35:35,954
Yours and mine.

1052
01:35:48,008 --> 01:35:49,999
Well, if it ain't Sergeant Quirt.

1053
01:35:50,111 --> 01:35:54,343
- I got here first, Flagg.
- You ain't wanted around here, Quirt.

1054
01:35:54,448 --> 01:35:57,144
You take your hands off of Charmaine.

1055
01:36:00,988 --> 01:36:04,685
You want my hands off of Charmaine,
you come on and take 'em off.

1056
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:08,421
- No, no. We must be friends.
- With you around?

1057
01:36:08,529 --> 01:36:12,761
Flagg, this lady
is my fiancée, remember?

1058
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:16,928
- You engaged me to her.
- Well, I changed my mind.

1059
01:36:17,037 --> 01:36:19,528
She's my fiancée now,
and I'm gonna marry her.

1060
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:22,837
- Don't fight, please.
- Charmaine, get behind the bar.

1061
01:36:22,943 --> 01:36:26,674
Get out of here, Flagg.
Beat it! Go get a girl of your own.

1062
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:28,681
- Quirt, you're drunk.
- Both of us.

1063
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,876
- Yeah, both of us.
- What are you gonna do about it?

1064
01:36:30,985 --> 01:36:34,113
What are we gonna do about it?
I'm gonna have a drink.

1065
01:36:37,158 --> 01:36:39,183
Both of us.

1066
01:36:45,733 --> 01:36:47,963
Pour, Charmaine, pour.

1067
01:36:50,704 --> 01:36:52,695
And pour one
for the sergeant too.

1068
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:56,140
'Cause this is the last thing
you'll ever do for him.

1069
01:37:01,115 --> 01:37:04,482
Flagg, I think it's only fair to warn you
that I am a sole survivor...

1070
01:37:04,585 --> 01:37:06,485
of seven catastrophes...

1071
01:37:06,587 --> 01:37:10,079
each of which was calculated
to carry off every man jack...

1072
01:37:10,191 --> 01:37:12,785
in the immediate neighborhood
as well as adjacent.

1073
01:37:12,893 --> 01:37:17,159
So if there was to be a catastrophe of
any dimensions...

1074
01:37:17,264 --> 01:37:19,528
in the near future
in this here vicinity...

1075
01:37:19,633 --> 01:37:23,000
I have expectations of
survival exceeding your own.

1076
01:37:23,103 --> 01:37:25,867
- Have one on me.
- Thanks, I will.

1077
01:37:28,242 --> 01:37:32,941
Quirt, your method of expression is
complicated by the fact that...

1078
01:37:33,047 --> 01:37:35,811
your tongue is as
thick as your head.

1079
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:38,441
But if you contemplate any trouble...

1080
01:37:38,552 --> 01:37:41,680
I think it's only fair to warn you
that among other things...

1081
01:37:41,789 --> 01:37:44,622
you forgot to
bring along your gun.

1082
01:37:44,725 --> 01:37:47,853
Have a drink on me.

1083
01:37:47,962 --> 01:37:49,930
Thanks, I will.

1084
01:37:51,332 --> 01:37:53,300
I'll tell you what
I'll do with you, Flagg.

1085
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:57,131
I'll take you outside with
two of those little toys at 50 yards.

1086
01:37:57,238 --> 01:37:59,399
And you, the best pistol shot
in the corps?

1087
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:01,667
Why, you'd put a bullet
through my carburetor...

1088
01:38:01,775 --> 01:38:05,006
as easy as pitching
a penny through a well.

1089
01:38:05,112 --> 01:38:08,411
- Come again and have another drink on me.
- Thank you. I will.

1090
01:38:10,618 --> 01:38:14,247
I'll take you on any way you want,
you little baboon.

1091
01:38:14,355 --> 01:38:17,256
I can outthink, outshoot
and outdrink ya.

1092
01:38:17,358 --> 01:38:20,521
There ain't nothing I can't do any better
than you. Have one on me.

1093
01:38:20,628 --> 01:38:22,596
Thanks, I will.

1094
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:30,793
Quirt, the time has come
for you to say good night.

1095
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:42,375
Flagg, did you ever know of me leaving
a place before I was ready to leave?

1096
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:46,783
No. But tonight I'm gonna see it
for the first time.

1097
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:54,728
Stop it! Stop it!

1098
01:38:56,697 --> 01:39:00,633
You don't ask me who I marry!
You think I'm going to marry
the one that is not dead!

1099
01:39:00,734 --> 01:39:04,602
- It's a cinch you ain't gonna
marry the one that is.

1100
01:39:04,705 --> 01:39:08,004
<i>- I'm going to marry the one I choose.
- All right, choose.</i>

1101
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:21,083
L... I love you both.

1102
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:26,722
All right, then I'll choose,
'cause I got the gun.

1103
01:39:26,827 --> 01:39:29,159
Are you gonna go
jump in the canal...

1104
01:39:29,263 --> 01:39:31,891
or is it gonna take six pallbearers to
put you there?

1105
01:39:31,999 --> 01:39:36,299
- Take your hands out of your pocket.
- I haven't got a gun, remember?

1106
01:39:36,403 --> 01:39:39,566
Just a pair of dice.
I'll shoot you for her.

1107
01:39:41,842 --> 01:39:44,902
Kiper, is Quirt
crooked with the dice?

1108
01:39:45,012 --> 01:39:49,073
He's got a pair of dice
that oughta be in the circus.

1109
01:39:49,183 --> 01:39:49,410
- All right, then, a hand of poker.
- Poker?

1110
01:39:51,785 --> 01:39:54,686
Sure. The man that wins
gets the gun.

1111
01:39:54,788 --> 01:39:58,019
The man that loses gets a head start.
Everybody wins, see?

1112
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:01,253
One gets the girl, the other gets to
stay in bed the rest of this war.

1113
01:40:01,362 --> 01:40:04,456
- Charmaine, go on, get the cards.
- Captain, I wouldn't do that.

1114
01:40:04,565 --> 01:40:07,728
Close your hatch!
I'll try anything once, soldier.

1115
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:10,395
<i>- Go on, Charmaine, get the cards.
- Please, Capitaine, please.</i>

1116
01:40:10,504 --> 01:40:13,530
Don't worry about me. I'm indestructible.
Go ahead, get 'em.

1117
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:16,666
- Have a drink.
- Come on, Quirt. I'll call the M.P.s.

1118
01:40:16,777 --> 01:40:18,677
- You belong in...
- Get out of here!

1119
01:40:18,779 --> 01:40:22,738
Kiper, march through that door,
and if you stick your neck in once...

1120
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:25,512
before the game is over,
I'll wreck you for life.

1121
01:40:25,619 --> 01:40:29,077
- Now, are you gonna go, or do I demonstrate?
- Get out!

1122
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:32,852
- Sit down, Captain Flagg.
- Thanks.

1123
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,928
You're welcome.

1124
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:45,134
Thank you, Charmaine.
Now, upstairs.

1125
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:51,905
- Cut.
- Gun on the table between us.

1126
01:40:52,012 --> 01:40:53,946
Charmaine, upstairs!

1127
01:40:59,086 --> 01:41:01,020
- Captain Flagg in there?
- Don't go in there.

1128
01:41:01,155 --> 01:41:03,953
- Why not?
- Listen, you didn't get killed
at the front, did you?

1129
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:07,494
- No.
- Well, what's the sense of
getting killed in the saloon?

1130
01:41:22,142 --> 01:41:24,201
The bottom card is an ace.

1131
01:41:24,344 --> 01:41:27,279
Captain Flagg,
the chances are one in 13...

1132
01:41:27,381 --> 01:41:29,406
that the bottom card
will be an ace.

1133
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:34,283
<i>And what are the chances of the second
from the bottom card being an ace?</i>

1134
01:41:36,457 --> 01:41:39,153
I'll shuffle.

1135
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:43,029
<i>Cut.</i>

1136
01:41:51,405 --> 01:41:56,035
Cold poker.
Five cards open. No draw.

1137
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:07,281
<i>- Ace.
- I'll have a drink.</i>

1138
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:13,658
Ace. I'll have a drink.

1139
01:42:25,272 --> 01:42:27,206
Eight.

1140
01:42:28,242 --> 01:42:30,540
Six.

1141
01:42:32,946 --> 01:42:35,039
Trey.

1142
01:42:37,084 --> 01:42:40,019
Sixes, a pair.

1143
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:46,084
Pair of eights, Flagg.

1144
01:42:52,432 --> 01:42:55,026
Three sixes, Quirt.

1145
01:42:58,972 --> 01:43:01,736
This next card
better be an eight...

1146
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:04,868
or you are a dead man.

1147
01:43:36,343 --> 01:43:39,642
I bluffed him!

1148
01:43:39,746 --> 01:43:42,340
I bluffed him!

1149
01:43:42,482 --> 01:43:45,383
<i>He had an eight coming, and I bluffed him!</i>

1150
01:43:55,495 --> 01:43:59,431
You killed him!

1151
01:43:59,566 --> 01:44:02,967
Nah, he knocked
the lamp over and ran.

1152
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:06,062
I didn't kill him.
I did better than that.

1153
01:44:06,206 --> 01:44:08,436
I bluffed him.
Bluffed him.

1154
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:11,238
He had an eight coming,
and I bluffed him.

1155
01:44:11,345 --> 01:44:14,371
And now, Charmaine,
it's just you and me.

1156
01:44:14,514 --> 01:44:17,449
Now get behind the bar,
and buy my friends a drink.

1157
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:18,050
- Come on.
- Captain Flagg.

1158
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:18,346
- Come on.
- Captain Flagg.

1159
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:22,079
Battalion's moving up.

1160
01:44:29,596 --> 01:44:32,793
<i>We're ordered back.
Ordered back in.</i>

1161
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:36,767
Everybody's going back in.
General movement.

1162
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:40,101
<i>- The big push is on.
- What?</i>

1163
01:44:41,141 --> 01:44:43,075
What?

1164
01:44:50,851 --> 01:44:54,048
- But I'm on a leave.
- All leaves are cancelled.

1165
01:44:54,154 --> 01:44:56,122
Well, why'd you have to
come and tell me?

1166
01:44:56,256 --> 01:45:00,386
- Headquarters sent out
looking for you, Captain.
- Come on, skipper. Let's go.

1167
01:45:00,494 --> 01:45:03,725
Well, you never found me
to give me the message.

1168
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:07,527
Now, can you remember that, or do I have to
bury you to keep your mouths shut?

1169
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:09,966
I got 'em their prisoner.
I gave 'em their railway station...

1170
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:12,129
and I got papers
that say I'm on leave.

1171
01:45:12,272 --> 01:45:15,036
The company was moving out.
What could I do, Captain?

1172
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:17,235
You could've got
an attack or something.

1173
01:45:17,377 --> 01:45:20,312
You could've fallen down
and broken your neck on the way here.

1174
01:45:20,447 --> 01:45:24,042
Tell 'em any story you can think of.
Only I didn't get the message.

1175
01:45:24,184 --> 01:45:27,119
I earned my leave.
It's signed, sealed and delivered.

1176
01:45:27,254 --> 01:45:30,189
That crowd at headquarters have to
keep their end of the bargain.

1177
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:32,918
They can't take
those men back in.

1178
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,224
I won't stand for it.

1179
01:45:40,033 --> 01:45:44,299
Charmaine, shall we stay here?

1180
01:45:44,404 --> 01:45:46,929
Yes.

1181
01:45:47,074 --> 01:45:49,008
Yes.

1182
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:55,746
Oh, no.

1183
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:57,908
No, I'll go.

1184
01:45:58,051 --> 01:46:00,485
I'll go.

1185
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:04,317
I may be drunk, but I know I'll go.

1186
01:46:05,392 --> 01:46:09,795
Gowdy! Lipinsky! Get rolling.

1187
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:17,363
There's something... something about
this profession of arms.

1188
01:46:17,471 --> 01:46:20,463
Some kind of religion connected
with it that you can't shake.

1189
01:46:24,878 --> 01:46:26,812
Good-bye, Charmaine.

1190
01:46:28,648 --> 01:46:31,344
Put your money in real estate...

1191
01:46:31,451 --> 01:46:33,783
and marry that cuckoo if you can.

1192
01:46:35,422 --> 01:46:37,890
You'll never see me again.

1193
01:46:49,669 --> 01:46:53,799
Moran, follow us close with the rations.

1194
01:46:53,907 --> 01:46:56,432
Follow us because
we don't know where we're going.

1195
01:46:56,576 --> 01:46:59,170
- Nobody knows.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1196
01:47:05,652 --> 01:47:07,586
I got something for you.

1197
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:13,856
Your discharge papers.
