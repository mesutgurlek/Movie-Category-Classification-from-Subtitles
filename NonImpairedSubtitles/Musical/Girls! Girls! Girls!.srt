00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,394
Captain! Captain!

2
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,275
Ross! Strike!

3
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,038
Hold her down, Chen!

4
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,196
l got a strike!

5
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,031
- What you got?
- lts putting up a fight!

6
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,429
Dont let it get away.

7
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,518
- Maybe youd better give me a hand.
- Right.

8
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,957
Watch it!

9
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,633
OK, Mr Morgan, shes all yours.

10
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,229
Watch yourself!

11
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,190
Thanks. Heart attacks are so common.
ld hate to bury him at sea.

12
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,629
- Arthur! You reel him in.
- Shut up and give me another pill.

13
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,757
Open your mouth... There you go, sport.

14
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,952
OK, Chen. Lets haul it in.

15
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,476
OK, Chen. Now.

16
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,272
Put a canvas over it, Chen.

17
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,235
- Where is it?
- lts in the bow, Mr Morgan.

18
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,675
- l like the way you did that.
- Thanks.

19
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,958
<i>Ahoy, Kingfisher!</i>

20
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,151
<i>Ahoy, West Wind!</i>

21
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,190
- Well race you!
- Why? You know l cant beat you.

22
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,597
- A sailboat take a fisher?
- l let them win.

23
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,278
- l can see why.
- Theyre girls!

24
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,555
See you at the dock, Ross!

25
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,672
- Sure is a beauty.
- Which one?

26
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,836
The boat! Sharp, aint she?

27
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,759
- Real yare, Jack.
- Ross.

28
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,999
Why dont you relax
and come get some sun with me?

29
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,715
- Why not check on your husband?
- No!

30
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,070
Take a look, Chen.

31
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,716
- Mr Morgan, hes sleeping.
- Thats him!

32
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,114
- Dont you feel sorry for me?
- ln a way, yeah.

33
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,073
-You must get a lot of this.
- Quite a bit.

34
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,471
Youd think the fish smell
would keep them away.

35
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,116
- You wanna keep them away?
- No! l like girls.

36
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,916
- Not as much as the boat.
- l live on her. ld like to own her.

37
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,236
- Whats stopping you?
- Money.

38
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,431
That shouldnt be a problem.

39
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,155
- You must be kidding.
- No, l wouldnt do that.

40
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,750
l dont give to organised charity.

41
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,997
But theres a big charge
in doing it this way.

42
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,430
- lndividual cases.
- Mrs Morgan...

43
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,315
l dont accept charity.
l have to earn what l get.

44
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,239
You would, honey. You would.

45
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,597
- Ross.
- Hi.

46
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,951
When will you teach your daughters
to stow a sail?

47
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,993
Mr Morgan liked the boat.
Hell charter again.

48
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,156
Can l talk to you, please?

49
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,916
Whats the matter, Papa Stavros?

50
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,668
- Nothing.
- Somethings bugging you.

51
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,078
- The doctor says a bug is bugging me.
- lm sorry...

52
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,717
Today, he tells us we must move
to a dry climate, like Arizona.

53
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,675
- Arizona?
- Arizona.

54
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,758
Papa learn English
so they want him to move.

55
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,669
- What they speak there?
- Mama, this is not a joke.

56
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,953
- Dont worry, Ross. We wont move.
- But if youre sick...

57
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,393
Sick? A woman isnt as young as
she was, so they look for a reason.

58
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,592
- Then its not serious?
- Of course it is.

59
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,316
Dont listen. lf he says he must
sell the boats, also dont listen.

60
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,354
Come to our wedding anniversary
on Wednesday night

61
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,074
and forget about all this.

62
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,309
- All right, Mama, thank you.
- Chen. You come, too.

63
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,317
Thank you, Mama.

64
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,433
Come on, Papa. You have made
enough trouble already.

65
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,278
Papa...

66
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,836
<i>The West Wind, too?</i>

67
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,632
Yes.

68
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,679
Hey, Sam.

69
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,552
- Hi, Ross.
- How are you?

70
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,069
Shell be off soon. Wait at the bar.

71
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,959
- Long time no see.
- Not so long.

72
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,311
To what disaster do l owe this visit?

73
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,080
- You know?
- No.

74
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,512
Only, l know when old head on
the shoulder Robin comes on.

75
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,995
l come when theres nothing wrong.

76
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,876
You come when you want to sing
a little or cry on my shoulder.

77
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,676
- Which is it tonight?
- l dont feel much like singing.

78
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,352
<i>Stavros is moving to Arizona, selling
the fishing boats and the West Wind.</i>

79
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,030
Good. lts the only way
to get it out of your system.

80
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,199
lts not that easy. Losing a home
and a job all in one day.

81
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,756
lt might be worth it...
if you lose the dream, too.

82
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,191
Look, my father and l
built the boat together.

83
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,153
l wanted to own it.
Thats not a dream.

84
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,989
Your father is gone
and so is that part of your life.

85
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,398
The worst thing for you was
Papa letting you live on that boat.

86
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,672
- l can count on that speech.
- Count on me.

87
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,555
- Here we go again!
- Should l pretend l dont care?

88
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,718
Dont make things
tougher than they are!

89
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,479
Ready for your number, Robin?

90
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,389
Let Sir Galahad do it, OK?

91
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,433
- What are you doing to her, Ross?
- Nothing.

92
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,872
He just came in to tell me
his troubles and l told him mine.

93
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,230
- lts my fault.
- lts nobodys fault...

94
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,396
Jeez! Would somebody sing?

95
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,398
- Sure, Mac, sure.
- Thanks, pal.

96
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,679
Hey, you sing, Ross.
Come on, favour to me.

97
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,191
Great! Any time you wanna
make it permanent, let me know.

98
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,517
Thanks, Sam. lm still a fisherman.

99
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,951
- Whats this?
- The swinger with the mink look sent it.

100
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,709
- You must smell of musk or something.
- Excuse me.

101
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,434
l dont work here,
but thanks anyway.

102
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,076
- Whats the matter? Not enough?
- Want me to...?

103
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,919
- You sing lousy anyway.
- Thank you.

104
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,113
- l thought you sang very well...
- He stinks! The old stinkeroo.

105
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,356
- Ross Carpenter.
- Laurel Dodge.

106
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,836
Yes, sir.
The real old-fashioned stinkeroony.

107
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,636
- Whos the intellectual?
- A bad idea l had. Blind date.

108
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,515
- Hes blind, all right.
- Wait, pal, get your own date.

109
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,950
Had to call the cops, didnt you?

110
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,912
Thank you.

111
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,679
- Go cry on her shoulder.
- Wait a minute.

112
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,555
Youre Sir Galahad, all right,
to strangers.

113
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,111
- lm sorry l caused trouble for you.
- Dont give it a second thought.

114
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,151
Girls!

115
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,989
- What?
- You dropped a handkerchief.

116
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,156
- Come on!
- Got a match?

117
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,318
- Cut it out.
- l thought you needed help.

118
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,348
- l can get this from my enemies.
- l never saw him before.

119
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,472
- Honey, l gathered that.
- Now, you come on!

120
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,229
He said he was a friend
of my fathers and he wasnt.

121
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,396
OK, l believe you.

122
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,955
OK. Whos the girl?

123
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,676
She said she was an old football
buddy of my mothers, but she wasnt.

124
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,235
- Where do you live?
- Down the road.

125
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,113
- Very far?
- Not too far.

126
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,878
Lets go.

127
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,155
lf youre trying to tire me, its working.

128
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,271
Whats the name of that church?

129
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,396
- The Old Church, everybody knows that.
- lve never been here before.

130
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,234
Where do you come from?
Grand Rapids?

131
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,318
No. Cant we go back and go inside?

132
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,795
- Corpus Christi?
- No.

133
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,673
You could rest.
Maybe sing with the choir.

134
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,838
- Prattville, Oklahoma?
- No!

135
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,875
lts such a nice night. Wouldnt you
like to go to another local landmark?

136
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,071
Only the one youre staying at.

137
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,151
- lll show you where lm staying.
- Good. Shall l call a cab?

138
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,638
- l dont think thats necessary.
- lf you think lm gonna walk...

139
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,308
Well, here we are.

140
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,469
- Here?
- lts simple and it reeks of history.

141
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,477
- Reeks of something.
- Goodnight.

142
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,593
- Arent you asking me in?
- They double the rent for that.

143
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,469
- What do you think this place is?
- l want to find out.

144
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,999
Tomorrow.

145
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,519
- What time?

146
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,756
- lll pick you up.
- Where are we eating?

147
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,552
The Mariners. Menu?

148
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,876
- Well meet there.
- You dont know it.

149
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,196
lll find it.

150
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,588
Youre sweet, Ross.

151
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,160
Then, why am l leaving?

152
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,792
Would you like a room or anything?

153
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,718
lf you dont mind parrots.

154
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,797
- Parrots?
- Yes.

155
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,552
You see, l have 23 darling creatures
who travel with me everywhere.

156
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,877
Of course, l always make
arrangements far ahead.

157
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,509
The Hilton people werent
at all understanding this time.

158
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,078
As a result, l find myself
and these poor creatures left...

159
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,434
You have to excuse me now.

160
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,479
Bye-bye, now.

161
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,638
Bye-bye, now... Parrots?

162
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,954

163
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,469

164
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,398
You know Mr Johnson?

165
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,874
By reputation.

166
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,470
Mr Johnson is interested
in the boats.

167
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,591
- These the other boats?
- Yes.

168
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,110
Theyre in first-class shape,
Ross sees to that.

169
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,677
<i>How would l know? Lets shake down
the Kingfisher and lll tell you.</i>

170
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,633
Ross, he wants to take a ride.

171
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,833
Youre on, Skipper.

172
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,953
Hey, dont rev it up so much.

173
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,197

174
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,109
- Comin aboard, Papa?
- No, l gotta stay with Mama.

175
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,232
He doesnt wanna get
hot-rodded around by you.

176
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,273
Know something, Mr Johnson?
You may be right.

177
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,193
OK, Captain Blood.
Can we go home now?

178
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,836
- Why not?
- Can you handle a following sea?

179
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,116
- Like to try?
- No!

180
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,630
- Unless you can get some speed up.
- Speed, huh?

181
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,870
OK.

182
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,678
- Are you gonna buy the boats?
- At a price.

183
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,670
- l bet. Three top boats.
- Whats wrong with the fourth?

184
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,839
- Whatd you do with the sailboat?
- Make like a gentleman of the sea.

185
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,150
lf the old manll throw it in.

186
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,716
- lt wouldnt suit you.
- l have a girl it would.

187
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,354
- Wholl teach you to sail?
- She will.

188
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,632
lts her second-favourite sport.

189
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,353
Your butterflies opened. Two of em.

190
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,269
Thats the sea, unpredictable.
Have to clean the carburettor.

191
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,552
Shouldnt take a good mechanic
over five minutes.

192
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,756
Can you hold that for me?

193
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,878
Keep it turned away from you.
lts a little messy, you know.

194
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,153
Ross!

195
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,954
Ross!

196
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,033
Hello, Suzie Wong!

197
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,869
- Arent we getting repetitious?
- l came, l saw, l left.

198
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,877
l leave now.

199
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,150
You were very late. l waited.

200
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,750
- You picked up an ageing gentleman.
- My father.

201
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,110
Thats no gentleman,
thats my father.

202
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,393
- lll make my own jokes, thanks.
- lts not funny. lts sad.

203
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,433
You didnt show.
Hes in town so l called him.

204
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,596
Why am l always explaining?

205
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,951
Maybe its something you do.
The hotel never heard of you.

206
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,515
- Trust me on that one.
- Why?

207
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,838
Because l went to the trouble
of asking where l could find you,

208
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,349
and you like games as well as l do.

209
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,278
Come aboard and play.

210
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,517
- Tell me the rules.
- l got a feeling youd cheat.

211
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,598
Thats usually what ladies say
to gentlemen.

212
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,713
- l just came to mend fences.
- Ever tried canvas?

213
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,514
- Can you stitch?
- l kicked the habit.

214
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,359
- Sit down. Coffee?
- Save it for tonight.

215
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,676
- What happens tonight?
- Dinner.

216
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,316
lm taking you to dinner!
Well eat at my bosss house.

217
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,715
- lf youre broke...
- lm not.

218
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,593
l hope youre not dreary
about money.

219
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,439
We go where l can afford
or not at all.

220
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,393

No wandering around hotel lobbies.

222
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,796

223
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,835
Whats she doing here? ls the fleet in?

224
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,873
- Lay off, Robin.
- Ditto.

225
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,433
Wanna come aboard?

226
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,234
l wouldnt get aboard
Cleopatras barge with you.

227
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,513
- Why did you come?
- To apologise for the other night.

228
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,478
- l accept.
- l withdraw.

229
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,955
- l didnt know you had company.
- Robin.

230
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,277
- Youre a fast worker.
- l know youre upset.

231
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,790
lm not upset. lm hurt. H-U-R-T.

232
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,514
You know how it is
between you and l.

233
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,711
l dont want to hear that.

234
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,357
l know how it is between us.
l also know how it could be, OK?

235
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,910
OK.

236
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,152
Youll come back this time,
like you always do.

237
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,920
All right, Robin, all right.

238
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,998
Are you? Tell me.

239
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,156
l dont know.

240
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,754
Sir Galahad.

241
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,748
Youre Sir Galahad,
Don Juan and Casanova rolled into one.

242
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,033

And dont you follow me!

244
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,635
Sir? Could you tell me...?

245
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,549
Scat! Get outta here! Scat!

246
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,114
- This is really your family, isnt it?
- Well, sort of.

247
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,790
l never knew my mother.
We lost her when l was born.

248
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,312
When my dad died, l had to sell
the boat to pay for everything, so...

249
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,559
You dont have to explain to me.
lm sorry theyre leaving.

250
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,832
Quiet, please! Quiet!

251
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,759
A toast from Linda and me
to Mama and Papa,

252
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,317

to meet, marry and get us born.

253
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,954
lt was no trouble at all!

254
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,233
Excuse me.

255
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,152
Many happy years to you, Mama
and Papa Stavros. Best of health.

256
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,874
- This is for you.

257
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,992

258
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,631

259
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,432

260
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,073
- lts so pretty!

261

Shes running just fine. Just fine.

262
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,552
You love this boat.

263
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,833
Oh, yeah. My father and l spent
every spare minute working on it.

264
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,669
We measured, sanded
and polished every board.

265
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,350
My dad was a great guy.
Youd have liked him.

266
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,473
And then, the day it was finished

267
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,393
was the day he died.

268
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,637
Somehow the boat meant...

269
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,997
lm sorry. Were getting too serious.

270
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,795

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,756
- Ross got a new girl.
- Shh!

313
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,110
String any peas before?

314
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,437
- You know this one long?
- Forever. 24 hours.

315
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,677
- No harm done yet. Hows Chen?
- Hes fine.

316
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,713
Chen very fine son. Very scarce.

317
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,391
Ross adopted son. Also very scarce.
Except when in trouble.

318
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,068
Stand in line if you wanna lecture me!

319
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,633
Start!

320
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,753
- We help, too!
- We help, too!

321
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,829
Miss Laurel, you are guest.
You can clean shrimp.

322
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,520
Children, dinner time.
Better go home.

323
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,029
- Bye, Miss Laurel.
- Goodbye.

324
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,073
- Bye, kids.
- Bye, Ross.

325
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,916
Work!

326
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,717
Excuse me.

327
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,594
Here. l wouldnt want you to starve.

328
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,473
- lts not very filling.
- lve had plenty.

329
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,877
Even if you full,
you hungry one hour later.

330
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,833
You make date with Chinese girl,
same thing.

331
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,190
One hour later,
you want second date.

332
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,032
Old men remember small things
very big. Old Chinese proverb.

333
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,196
Dinner finished.

334
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,116
You wash dishes. l show young
couple calm before storm from porch.

335
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,630
Young couple look at own calm
before storm. You help wash dishes.

336
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,071
Honourable ancestors do not approve
of men in kitchen!

337
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,192
Use honourable detergent!

338
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,876
Ross. Very pretty on porch
this time of night.

339
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,036
Shall we?

340
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,557
- Put your sweater on.
- What a beautiful view!

341
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,274
Looks like rain to me.

342
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,072
Help!

343
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,988
- There you go.
- l like the Yungs.

344
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,158
- They like you.
- Do they like Robin, too?

345
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,194
The Chinese are inscrutable,
dont express their feelings.

346
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,030
- lsnt damp air bad for instruments?
- lt can only improve this one.

347
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,073
Sing something lute-ish.

348
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,318
Gotcha!

349
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,398
- Whats so funny?
- You sing Chinese velly funny!

350
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,596
Me sing Chinese velly funny!

351
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,475
Everybody wants to be a critic.
Think you can do better?

352
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,234
That means...

353
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,993
Earth boy dream of angel

354
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,513
Make him have happy heart

355
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,670
ln land of love

356
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,353
Angel dream of earth boy

357
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,630
ln land of love

358
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,310
Youd better run! lll get you!

359
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,998
Run home to your mama.
Too late for children to be up.

360
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,749
Too late for anybody to be up.

361
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,555
- ls she trying to tell us something?
- Something.

362
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,398
l wonder what it could be.

363
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,397
- You go to bed now.
- A mans home is his castle.

364
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,433
Kin, you sleep with
brother-in-law next door.

365
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,635
Kin doesnt like to sleep
with brother-in-law. He snores.

366
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,718
You sleep with brother-in-law!

367
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,478
- Sleep well.
- Goodnight.

368
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,433
Ross, Laurel, you come with me.

369
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,150
Laurel, you sleep with me.
Ross, you on couch.

370
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,749
- Goodnight.
- Night.

371
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,518
Night.

372
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,038
l must have gotten
the wrong fortune cookie.

373
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,912
Laurel...? Laurel!

374
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,554
Laurel!

375
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,833
<i>Ahoy, West Wind!</i>

376
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,190
One if by land...

377
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,755
...and two if by sea.

378
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,718
We can weigh anchor, Admiral.
lm ready.

379
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,358
lts no fit night for man nor beast.

380
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,996
lts not sensational here, either.

381
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,435
- Frightened?
- Terrified! Lets watch.

382
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,073
Good idea.

383
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,878
Why do you feel
so much more alive in a storm?

384
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,479
l dont know.

385
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:55,074
Maybe its because everything
seems more intense, more real.

386
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,078
This is real.

387
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,280
Yes.

388
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,000
You sound doubtful.

389
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,159
- Youre not too real yourself.
- Not yet.

390
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,829
- Youre not married, are you?
- Almost.

391
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,474
ls that what
youre running away from?

392
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,956
Yes. Lets not talk any more.

393
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,239
You still love him?

394
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,000
He didnt love me.

395
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,159
- l didnt ask you that.
- l was hurt.

396
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,717
- The whole thing was such a lie.
- What about him?

397
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,117
Thats why my father
brought me here from Chicago.

398
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:42,110
lts over with,
but lm just not all together yet.

399
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,915
Youre together enough for me.

400
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,192
l couldnt stand being fooled again.

401
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,472
lts me. And it is real. lsnt it?

402
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,432
- Were getting wet.
- Do you care?

403
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,279
l dont want to care about anything!

404
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,754
- Goodbye, Ross!
- Bye, Miss Laurel!

405
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,349
Come back soon!

406
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,158
- Bye, kids!
- Goodbye, everybody!

407
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,713
Bye!

408
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,749
Papa Stavros! What are you doing?

409
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,872
l didnt expect you.
Hello, Miss Dodge.

410
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,231
- Whats the ledger for?
- Marine insurance.

411
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,116
- They want the gear itemised.
- l itemised it last month.

412
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,675
Well, this is sort of an inventory.

413
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,597
Ross. l sold the boats.

414
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,553
You sold em? All?

415
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,753
Johnson said, Take it or leave it.
l need the money for the house...

416
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,918
- You dont have to explain.
- Well, l just...

417
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,076
How soon does he take over?

418
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,590
- Ross. The trouble is...
- lll get my gear packed.

419
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,352
No, no! Tonight, tomorrow...
Goodbye, now.

420
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,830
- Where will you live?
- Chen can take me in for a while.

421
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,951
What are you gonna do?

422
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,789
Yep. lm gonna see him now.
Right now.

423
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,956
- Chen?
- Nope, Johnson.

424
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,357
- lll take you home.
- lll get a cab. Go see him.

425
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,269
Wait. You were going to let me
take you home, werent you?

426
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,597
l live at 1 36 Bay Street.
lll be waiting.

427
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,758
- l dont know how long...
- lll be waiting!

428
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,715
- We knock, Skipper.
- And we take advantage of old men.

429
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,269
This was no Greek bearing gifts. l paid.

430
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,755
<i>Will you sell the West Wind?</i>

431
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,398
Depends. l dont own anything
without a price.

432
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,830
- How much?
- Ten thousand.

433
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,110
- What dyou pay Stavros?
- Six.

434
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,471
- Youre a thief!
- A businessman. Got the money?

435
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,434
- You know l havent got any.
- Why are you wasting my time?

436
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,076
Johnson... Whatll you do
with the fishing boats?

437
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,555
Dry dock. Painting and refitting.

438
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,833
Theyll be out of circulation
for a while. And so will you.

439
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,634
- Want to work for me?
- Doing what?

440
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,229
- Fishing for tuna.
- No dice.

441
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,034
- lll tell you...
- lll tell you what youre gonna do.

442
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,993
Get your junk off my sailboat. Now.

443
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,838
Hold on, Skipper!

444
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:50,431
<i>Youll get nowhere with games
like choking the Kingfisher´s engine.</i>

445
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,838
All that did was let me knock
the sale price down.

446
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,873
All right, you want a job?

447
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,276
Then will you sell me the boat
for so much a week?

448
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,189
Everythings for sale.
But l wont promise not to sell her.

449
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,868
- What do you pay a captain?
- Captain?

450
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,117
Shouldnt you be a deck-hand first?

451
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,670
Sixty bucks a trip. lf you really want
the boat, make two trips a week.

452
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,589
- Commercial captains get a percentage.
- Not if theyre inexperienced.

453
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,075
Why pay me a salary?

454
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,636
This way, the more l haul,
the more we both make.

455
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,195
- What percentage?
- Ten percent.

456
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,118
- Two.
- Seven.

457
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,033
- Five and l see the books.
- OK. Deal.

458
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,277
- Chen Yung goes with it.
- Sure.

459
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,596
- Thats how generous l am.
- Real generous.

460
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,598
- Drink?
- lf yours is a Mickey.

461
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,792
You know, l like you.
You remind me of me.

462
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,312
- Trying to get me to blow the deal?
- Be here tomorrow. 3 a.m.

463
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:56,714
- And you can stay on the sailboat.
- Want me to maintain it, too?

464
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,480
You will, Skipper. You will.

465
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,515
- l came to talk to you, Sam.
- Good.

466
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,713
- Well?
- Got room for another singer?

467
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,515
The other dame sings, too?
Youre becoming a specialist.

468
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,280
- l sing.
- lve been telling you that.

469
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,392
- lm available.
- What made you decide, now?

470
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,239
- Money.
- lve offered you money before.

471
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,318
l didnt need it before.
How much can l make?

472
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,115
Scale to begin with.
More if youre a big draw.

473
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,595
This wont affect Robin. She stays.

474
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,189
Of course. She stays.

475
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,632
Sam, dont say anything about it.
lll tell her tomorrow, OK?

476
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,877
- Where are you going?
- l got a date.

477
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,278
- Theres a nice crowd. Go on now.
- l cant tonight.

478
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,519
Fishing, singing and hunting?
That makes for a full day.

479
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,598
Youre gonna have
to give up something.

480
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,314
Come on, Ross.
l want to see if l made a good deal.

481
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,556
All right, Sam.

482
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,591
- Doctor Livingstone!
- Hi!

483
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,588
Somehow this isnt how l imagined
the big reconciliation.

484
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,552
Good evening.

485
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,595
Regular patrons know Ross Carpenter,
whos sung here many times.

486
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,759
Tonight, Ross sings for the first time
as a professional.

487
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,599
Hell be here regularly from now on.

488
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,109
Lets all wish him a lot of luck.

489
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,560
Thats what l was trying to tell you.

490
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,992
Thought you were letting me tell her.
Thanks.

491
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,553
Sorry.

492
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,558
Play it again! More!

493
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,232
- More!
- Come on! More!

494
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,034
Ross?

495
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,312
Ross?

496
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,759
- More!
- Sing it again!

497
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,509
- Robin, l was going to...
- You go the whole route, dont you?

498
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,235
Pull the rug from under me,
take the bread out of my mouth.

499
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,069
lt sounds complicated.
lm keeping the wolf from the door.

500
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,590
- From the boat!
- lm singing for the money to buy it.

501
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,156
lm doing two jobs at once.
lt doesnt affect you.

502
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,191
You bet it doesnt.

503
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,393
- Can l go now?
- Anchors away!

504
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,550
- Youre a busy boy!
- Youre not on my back, too!

505
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:08,719
The other one was just here.
She went that-a-way.

506
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,673
Laurel!

507
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,352
Laurel!

508
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,518
- People dont stand me up.
- lm not people.

509
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,597
And this is your second try.

510
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,395
- What were you doing with Robin?
- Sam gave me a job.

511
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,672
- Fishing?
- Yeah, the place is full of tuna!

512
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,233
Very funny!

513
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,000
When lm not working for Johnson,
lm here.

514
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,634
When do you work at us? Split shift?

515
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,912
- l need the money.
- Money isnt that important.

516
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,556
Not when youve got it.
lts important to me.

517
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,557
How come it isnt to you?

518
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,390
- lts what you buy that matters.
- Hes not going to give me the boat.

519
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:54,037
- And not much else means anything.
- Thats right. Until l do buy it.

520
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,438
l thought it was Robin.
l wish it was, l could fight that.

521
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,076
- You dont understand.
- lve never wanted anything that badly.

522
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,716
Who and what are you
that lets you play it this cool?

523
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,315
Did you forget something?

524
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,229
lm sure she isnt cool
and she really understands.

525
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,273
Why dont you go back to her?

526
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,238
- No comment?
- lm thinking of the answer.

527
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,877
- Have you found it?
- Yeah, lve found it.

528
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,713
Lets see if we catch more bait than tuna.

529
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,878
Havent had much luck
catching anything yet.

530
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,232
Wheres the bait?
We got a net full of water!

531
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,228
We havent got enough bait
for a sardine, much less a tuna!

532
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,830
Start the engines.
Lets make another haul.

533
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,674
Head out to sea, Chen.

534
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,073
Hey! Kill the engine!
Take it out of reverse!

535
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,553
Kill it! Kill it!

536
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,318
Kill it!

537
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,470
Gee, Ross. lm sorry.

538
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,275
Oh, well. Save the pieces.
Johnsonll want to count em.

539
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,232
We go home now?

540
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,193
Unless you want to catch
a tuna by hand!

541
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,356
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

542
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,789
- Lot different than game fishing.
- Or shrimping.

543
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,833
l used to do that off New Orleans.

544
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,590
New Orleans.
l wish l was there right now.

545
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,193
- Well, lll be...
- How long to fix it?

546
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,868
- Too long.
- How soon for a new section?

547
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,877
No wonder youre in a hurry.

548
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:00,277
lf that trips a sample,
youll have to live out there.

549
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,550
Mr Johnson! Thats it.

550
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,793
- One ton!
- l read more.

551
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,073
- Maybe 20 pounds more.
- 1 ton, 20 pounds. How much?

552
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,955
lll have to check todays prices.
Lets go to the office.

553
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,152
Where you got that
trick adding machine!

554
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,872
Why the For Sale sign?

555
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:29,108
How do you sell a boat if you dont let
people know its for sale?

556
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,478
Thought you had a girl
that just loved sailing?

557
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,070
That was last week.
This week, she likes staying home.

558
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,840
- Knitting.
- Youre funny.

559
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,200
Honey, whats todays price?

560
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,433
Now give me the one on tuna.

561
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,038
Thank you, honey.

562
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:09,799
Your cuts $23. So, figuring $1 1 0
for a new section, you owe me $87.

563
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,953
Mr Johnson, dont go without
food and water until you get it.

564
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,549
- You wanted a percentage.
- On profit!

565
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,639
- Wheres the profit?
- Next trip. lf l make a next trip.

566
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,673
- l got 20 bucks says you will.
- lts a bet.

567
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,758
lll show you what kind of guy l am.
Call it square.

568
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,235
- lll pay for the net.
- No.

569
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,749
- $23 and you pay for the net.
- No.

570
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,999
All right. You owe me $20
on your bet, because lm through.

571
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,317
Five, ten,

572
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,511
fifteen, twenty.

573
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,551
Skipper!

574
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,912
21 , 22, 23.
Youre a rough beginner!

575
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:53,510
lm learning from you, Pops,
lm learning from you!

576
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,751
- Hi!
- Hi!

577
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,156
Dont be nervous. l come as a friend.

578
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,513
- Why are you all made up?
- This is what ladies wear to work.

579
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,836
- This is called a hat.
- Oh, a hat.

580
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,793
- l got a job.
- As what? Mata Hari?

581
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,232
No, selling ladies hats.
Nothing mysterious about that.

582
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,479
- Are you still mad at me?
- No.

583
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,831
- How are things?
- Not too good.

584
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,271
- Hes selling the boat.
- l know.

585
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:39,270
- What about that lunch?
- l cant. lm due at the shop.

586
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,756
- Arent you carrying this too far?
- Theres dinner.

587
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,872
- ld like to cook for you.
- You know what youre doing?

588
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:50,358
Youll find out when you taste
the cooking. Remember the address?

589
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:54,155
- 1 36 Bay Street.
- And lll be waiting.

590
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,399
- Try not to detour this time.
- Try not to detour this time!

591
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,350
- Hello!
- Do something!

592
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,471
- What?
- The ovens on fire!

593
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,557
Dont get excited.

594
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,230
- Got any salt?
- Just ground pepper or oregano.

595
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,394
- Looking for salt?
- No, a place to hide.

596
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,433
- lf l have any, it will be up there.
- Thanks.

597
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:16,077
This is salt.
lm gonna show you something.

598
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,710
lts an old wives trick.

599
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,510
Maybe its a little too well done.

600
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,439
How can you say that?

601
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,834
You dont have an old wife?

602
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,270
- lts kind of late...
- You never said!

603
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,516
You never asked! No!

604
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:46,157
This is white wine.
Got any canned shrimp or crab?

605
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,909
Yes, but the dressing l bought
goes with cheese.

606
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,074
- Got any oil?
- l dont mind the squeak.

607
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,511
- Salad oil!
- l have some from the drugstore.

608
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,756
Never mind! Forget it.

609
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,078
See the little box? Pick it up.

610
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,874
Attagirl! Put it in your little hand.

611
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,991
Come in here.

612
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,795
Light the candles.
Take off your shoes.

613
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,039
Smoke your corn-cob pipe
and dinnerll be ready in a jiffy.

614
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,073
Papas gonna cook the dinner.

615
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,079
Mustnt play with matches!

616
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,798
- Coffee in the living room, Madam?
- Please.

617
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,594
- Cream and sugar?
- Black, thank you.

618
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:51,920
Shall l drown that out? Next door
have very far-out tastes in music.

619
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,510
l kind of like it.
Maybe its the way l feel.

620
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,235
- Dinner wasnt that bad?
- Best meal l ever cooked!

621
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,516
Ross, its still the boat, isnt it?

622
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,836
You think lm dingy, dont you?

623
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:10,556
You can want a thing for
the right reason. But prepare yourself.

624
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,718
- lf shes sold?
- Yes.

625
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,516
Well, the good thing is l wont have
to work for Johnson any more.

626
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,476
Shh... ! lts a fight!

627
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:32,199
- Theyre arguing about bracelets.
- What did she say?

628
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,676
She says if he feels that way,
he can have them back.

629
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,189
He got em back!

630
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,119
Shes working up to bigger things.

631
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,949
Theyre not fighting.
l hope theyre married!

632
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,390
Yeah, me, too.

633
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,434
Just trying to make em feel at home.

634
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,872
These walls not only have ears,
they got hands, feet, broomsticks...

635
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,036
My turn!

636
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,512
Well, hello!

637
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,153
Youre Mr Johnson?

638
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,237
Or lm stealing his liquor.

639
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,635
- Bloody Mary?
- Laurel Dodge.

640
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,229
Come in and close the door!

641
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:01,950
- Wont you join me in my vice?
- lm touched. But lm on business.

642
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:05,709
ln that case, lll have this later.
Sit down.

643
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,435
lm better on my feet.
lm told its a must with you.

644
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,074
- Flattery will get you everywhere.
- l doubt it.

645
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:16,273
- ld like to buy the sailboat.
- A lot of people would.

646
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,358
- They come every morning.
- lm here this morning.

647
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,836
- lts $1 0,000, Miss...
- Dodge. Like in Detroit?

648
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,235
You dont have to club me!

649
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,193
- 1 0,000 is too much.
- But thats the price.

650
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,109
- l know what you paid.
- Everybody knows what l paid.

651
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:37,633
You have to want to buy more
than l want to sell. And l bet you do.

652
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,435
- Not that much.
- Good. We can forget the boat.

653
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,517
- Lunch? A drive?
- Seven?

654
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:48,748
- Oclock? Dinner? Even better!
- 8,000, thats all lve got.

655
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,679
Would you like a loan till next week?

656
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,916
The interest would be too high.

657
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,998
Stay a while!
lm not as tough as l seem.

658
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:01,318
- lm sure. But youre as greedy.
- lm just trying to be nice.

659
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,798
lf you want to sweet-talk me,
do it in numbers!

660
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,193
Temper, Miss Dodge! Temper!

661
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,077
<i>$ 1 0,000!
And tou´re calling me collect!</i>

662
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,953
No, Daddy, $2,000.

663
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,550
<i>l know, l just gave it to tou.

664
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,354
<i>- Of course not!
- Wht that much monet?</i>

665
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,551
<i>- lll tell you when l see you.
- Now!</i>

666
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,990
Youll only make a big thing of it.

667
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:33,676
Please, deposit the $2,000
in my account and trust me.

668
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:36,440
<i>Are tou sure it´s nothing medical?</i>

669
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,710
Thats my pop!

670
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,194
<i>- ls that you breathing?
- Who is he?</i>

671
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,392
<i>- A fisherman.
- A marlin fisherman?</i>

672
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,910
No, Daddy. Not marlin. Tuna.

673
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,793
<i>- Tuna!
- People have to eat!</i>

674
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,912
lm gonna write that cheque now,
Daddy. Bye!

675
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,270
OK. Thanks.

676
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,719
Mr Johnson.

677
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,389
That must be it.
Youre from Alcoholics Anonymous!

678
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,269
Youre gaping, Mr Johnson!

679
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,831
lts a Chicago bank.
ltll take a few days to clear.

680
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:24,352
The boat can stay here.
lm not asking you to wrap it up!

681
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,870
Youre in the big time now.
Lets not be so shook up.

682
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,550
- That lm saving for someone else.
- Just one condition.

683
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,354
- What?
- Dont tell anyone l bought it.

684
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,632
- l promise. Let me show you...
- Thats not necessary.

685
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,389
l have to! Dont want your diamonds
caught in the rigging!

686
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,115
- Thank you. lll manage.
- A toast to the new owner.

687
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:49,438
- lts a custom of the sea.
- l look forward to it.

688
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,632
Remember, lm serious
about keeping this secret.

689
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:56,355
- Want me to sign in blood?
- Would you?

690
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,756
Bring in another one!

691
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,350
Attaboy! Bring in another one!

692
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,391
Hey, Chen!

693
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,673
Attaboy! Bring in another one!

694
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,393
Beautiful!

695
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,709
What did you do?
Hijack another boat?

696
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:01,675
- Get em unloaded. Fast!
- You heard! Get em unloaded.

697
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,438
Sure is a happy one!

698
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:07,030
You gotta say one thing for him.
He sure...

699
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,596
He sure is! Weigh em and load em.

700
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,158
Thats the last truck-load.
Take it away!

701
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,033
- Whats the figure?
- Gross weight.

702
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:37,516
- And that?
- The days price per ton!

703
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:41,793
- Whats that sneaky little figure?
- Sliding scale differential.

704
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,916
- What does that mean?
- lt means your share is $7 1 .59.

705
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:52,716
Your differential friend has thrown you
a curve. l make it $1 03.

706
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,559
- Thats without the sliding scale.
- Sos our deal.

707
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,274
Bigger load, smaller percentage.
lts standard.

708
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,436
- ln the numbers racket?
- Everyone accepts it.

709
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,914
Mr Johnson!

710
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,554
The more l haul,
the bigger your cut.

711
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:08,673
l was nice when you blew
your first run. Dont push me!

712
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,514
Johnson! ld rather
you be honest than nice.

713
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:18,236
- $7 1 is good for a days work.
- $1 03 is better. lts what we agreed.

714
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:21,512
$7 1 and 59 cents.

715
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,154
Count out the rest, Mr Johnson.

716
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,476
You just dont understand business.

717
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:27,954
Johnson!

718
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,356
The For Sale signs off.

719
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,358
- Usually is when you sell.
- Who bought it?

720
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,109
Thats classified material, Skipper.

721
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,875
Pick up your money.

722
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,909
This just came in.

723
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,793
l know its new...

724
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,191
...but is it really me?

725
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:11,279
l think it captures your image
extremely well, Mrs Figgot.

726
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,996
Oh! That one over there has
a teeny-weensy bit more elan.

727
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,316
l dont think so. This is...

728
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,954
lve always loved roses...

729
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:29,073
This one is so beautifully
understated, dont you think?

730
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,078
- Absolutely muted.
- lll take it.

731
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,191
- Put it on my account.
- Yes.

732
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:38,075
Now... ! Lets check...

733
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,030
No!

734
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,957
- lm sorry. We ran out of boxes.
- Thats all right.

735
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,993
l just love the hat! Bye!

736
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,239
Laurel...

737
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,158
- Where is it?
- lts been sold.

738
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,237
- lt was mine!
- l know.

739
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,715
Why didnt you do something?

740
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,037
- Are you just going to stand there?
- Can we go?

741
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,277
This is outrageous.
l will not stand for it.

742
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,438
- Mr Peabody!
- l heard the sound of conflict.

743
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,835
- You must be the manager.
- Yes, Madam.

744
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,871
lm Mrs Figgot.

745
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:16,198
- Thats a name you dont fool with!
- lm taking my coffee break.

746
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,719
Miss Dodge!

747
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,798
- The penalty for desertion...
- Mr Peabody!

748
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:28,672
<i>How did you know
Johnson sold the West Wind?</i>

749
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,431
l went to the docks to look for you
and they were taking the sign off.

750
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,871
- Good afternoon.
- Come with me, please.

751
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:51,078
- May l take your order?
- Two coffees, two salads. OK?

752
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,589
Bring the coffee now, please.

753
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:59,636
Theres something l must tell you.
The man l told you about...

754
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,515
That wasnt the first time
ld been fooled.

755
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,676
- With you...
- With me, what?

756
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,235
With you it was different.

757
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:12,319
lt wasnt me before, it was my money.

758
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:16,195
Oh! Thats the mystery. Youre rich.

759
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,958
Yes.

760
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,720
- Try to live with it!
- Dont!

761
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,912
- You dont know what its like.
- No, l dont!

762
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:27,192
You look at every man suspiciously.

763
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:31,916
l had to find someone
whod love me for myself.

764
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:37,558
- lve been very lucky.
- Weve both been lucky, that way.

765
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:42,311
<i>- Why are you telling me this now?
- l bought the West Wind, Ross.</i>

766
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,719
- Where are you going?
- l dont know.

767
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,070
lm going with you.

768
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,839
- What have l done?
- Look...

769
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:59,112
When my father died,
l lived on what people gave me.

770
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:03,518
Clothes that didnt fit,
toys that had been thrown out.

771
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:07,633
l thought the food l ate was because
someone had finished with it.

772
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,152
Youll never understand.
A man must work for what he wants.

773
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,437
l have a right to do this for you.
l love you!

774
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:20,589
l dont take handouts from anybody.
l dont want to be kept.

775
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,154
Arent we working a little early today?

776
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,830
- You sing very well.
- l hear youre talented, too.

777
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:06,589
- lm sorry how things turned out.
- Boo-hoo.

778
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,395
- We had a fight.
- Tough.

779
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,670
Do you know where he is?

780
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,668
- l ought to have you thrown out.
- l have to find him.

781
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,589
He does this all the time.
Gets in a mood and disappears.

782
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,473
- Where?
- Paradise Cove.

783
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,353
Thatll be home
now the Stavroses are gone.

784
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,838
lm being much too polite to you.
l must be over the guy!

785
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,315
- Ready, Robin?
- Sure.

786
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,034
- Well?
- l would like to thank you.

787
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,595
Youd better not.

788
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,354
- Too late. Got my drink down.
- May l use that man? lll pay.

789
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,516
You want to rent him or buy him?

790
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,718
<i>l want him to sail the West Wind
to Paradise Cove.</i>

791
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,956
l couldnt possibly spare him.

792
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,958
There must be somebody you can spare.

793
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:14,470
Theres only one man
this business can spare.

794
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,796
- Thats me.
- lm sure of that.

795
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,116
lll take you.

796
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:24,076
- How much?
- lt wont cost you a dime.

797
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,238
- Just what do you expect?
- Dinner, Saturday.

798
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:30,591
- Thats all?
- l dont have to push.

799
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,360
l know lm irresistible.

800
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:40,390
- When can we start?
- lll get my hat and go with you.

801
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:48,029
- Ed, stand by to cast off.
- Yes, sir.

802
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,594
Make yourself comfortable.

803
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:01,438
l heard sailboats needed sails to sail.

804
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,517
They do.

805
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:07,190
- You didnt say it had an auxiliary.
- You didnt ask.

806
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:10,551
l could have done this myself.
lve been had.

807
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:12,273
Not yet.

808
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:16,029
Your eyes are bigger than
your stomach, Mr Johnson.

809
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,031
- Guests dont work, Ross.
- This one does.

810
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:37,872
Better get it finished. Radio says
heavy rains in the next few hours.

811
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,355
They did, huh? We find out.

812
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,391
Kapu! Kapu!

813
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,397
Kapu!

814
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,751
There you are, kitty.

815
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,952
First time l saw that.
He must know hell be fed.

816
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,390
No food. He tells weather.

817
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,989
lts gonna rain. l heard it on the radio.

818
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:02,274
- What they know about weather?
- l suppose Kapu knows!

819
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:07,270
White spots in eyes, it rain.
No spots, no rain.

820
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,035
No spots, no rain.

821
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:17,791
Youd better stow this gear
if you dont want to get it wet.

822
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:22,876
Very dangerous animal
when contradicted.

823
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,071
- Terribly sorry!
- lll bet.

824
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,874
Chen!

825
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:48,236
- Chen!
- Yes, sir!

826
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:51,079
- Do you see anything?
- Yes, sir!

827
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,838
Fish?

828
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,110
No, sir!

829
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:59,632
Captain! Hey, Captain!
Fish off the starboard bow!

830
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:07,916
Thank you! Youre very kind.

831
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:25,633
This is WY2 768,
calling marine operator. Over.

832
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,435
<i>- This is a marine operator.

835
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,878

Save strength for party.

836
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:49,640
- What party?
- Big catch, big party.

837
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:53,719

l dont feel much like a party.

838
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:58,072
You will, Ross.
Plenty wine, plenty girls.

839
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:01,272
Not interested. lts hot!

840
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,950
So true. Sun is out.

841
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,355
OK. The cat was right, wasnt it?

842
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:10,028

01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,914
This is Ross. Whats your location?

848
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,839
About four miles south of Paradise Cove.

849
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,998
<i>We passed the West Wind just now.</i>

850
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,395

867
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:12,279
You bought this boat for him.
Or you bought him for this boat.

868

OK, jump!

He still reminds me of me.

Know something? l should win a medal.

888

894
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:47,231
Either you marry me
or live with me in sin.

895
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,398
Couldnt l have a little bit of both?

896
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,753
Oh, no... Oh, no!

897
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:59,829
