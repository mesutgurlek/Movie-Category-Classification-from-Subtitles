<i>"How to Become the Richest Man?"</i>

2
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:11,581
<i>Please mind the gap
between train and platform.</i>

3
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:15,460
Sorry.

4
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:26,971
Good morning. Free newspaper.

5
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:29,557
Sorry.

6
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:32,059
Excuse me.

7
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:34,812
Excuse me.

8
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,654
Sorry.

9
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:48,618
Morning.

10
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:15,269
This way, please.

11
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:16,813
Please make way for her.

12
00:05:18,147 --> 00:05:19,190
This way, please.

13
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:27,698
- Take your time.
- Morning.

14
00:05:27,782 --> 00:05:28,741
Morning.

15
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:38,167
Not everyone can take this elevator.

16
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:39,752
What do you mean?

17
00:05:40,336 --> 00:05:41,838
If you want to take this elevator,

18
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,464
come before 7 am

19
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:45,758
or after 10 pm.

20
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:47,927
It takes you directly to 71st floor.

21
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,805
If you're in it, it guarantees
your future success.

22
00:05:51,013 --> 00:05:54,725
Otherwise, you'll lose your job.

23
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:04,694
- Morning.
- So early today?

24
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:08,197
Ready.

25
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:12,660
Okay.

26
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,598
My name is Lee Xiang.

27
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,099
Lee for Ang Lee, Xiang for dream.

28
00:06:35,182 --> 00:06:36,183
24 years old.

29
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:37,518
Nice to meet you!

30
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:40,813
Kat.

31
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:42,523
I'm in the Sales Department.
What about you?

32
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:44,650
The boss will decide after my probation.

33
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:48,321
Why can you take the direct elevator?

34
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:49,822
I'm Ben.

35
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:51,407
You are?

36
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,951
Kat. Don't be afraid. I don't bite.

37
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:55,536
Lee Xiang, Lee for Ang Lee,
Xiang for dream.

38
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,704
What's going on?

39
00:06:56,787 --> 00:06:57,788
He's Howard.

40
00:06:57,914 --> 00:06:59,081
Why they come at

41
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:00,374
our busiest hours?

42
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,126
- I'm Lee Xiang...
- Follow us.

43
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:03,169
Xiang for dream.

44
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:09,926
Look.

45
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:11,677
This is our office.

46
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:14,138
Everyone is working hard.

47
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:15,932
Look, our colleagues are so efficient.

48
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:17,683
All of us share the same belief in

49
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:19,101
getting off work early.

50
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:28,611
Here is photocopy room.

51
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:32,031
Smoke on the rooftop.

52
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,618
Die in the executive office.

53
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:38,746
Loiter in the toilet.

54
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:41,999
Gossip in the pantry.

55
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,209
Listen carefully!

56
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:44,001
Remember!

57
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:47,046

64
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:04,855
Got it?

65
00:08:05,606 --> 00:08:06,816
Got it?

66
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:10,236
Here you have to learn it the first time.

67
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:14,073
CEO Chang likes black coffee,

68
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:15,449
hot milk for Sophie,

69
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,076
Kevin likes oolong tea,

70
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:18,744

and water for everyone.

74
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:27,920
Here! Here they are!

75
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:29,213
The IPO team is here!

76
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,215
Excuse me.

77
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:34,010
Up how many points today?

78
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:35,886
Good.

79
00:08:36,178 --> 00:08:37,763
- The other two stocks?
- David,

80
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:39,515
please hand in the

81
00:08:39,598 --> 00:08:41,308
2007 account.

82
00:08:41,392 --> 00:08:42,727
Chang wants it immediately.

83
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:47,481
They're here?

84
00:08:47,565 --> 00:08:48,566
Yes.

85
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:10,212
<i>Bankers have sharp eyes for money,
as befits bankers.</i>

86
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:14,050
<i>I foresee the market
price of our IPO.</i>

87
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:17,511
<i>Lawyers are dressed lawfully
in black and white.</i>

88
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:21,140
<i>Such boring attire in
youth creates no delight.</i>

89
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:24,685
<i>Marry one lawyer and we'll never
worry about the legal fight.</i>

90
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:28,439
<i>Nice to meet you. When I see you,
I see my future bright.</i>

91
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:32,068
<i>We'll help you secure your
well-being and avoid plight.</i>

92
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:35,738
<i>We're so professional that
we do things with might.</i>

93
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:39,700
<i>Look, we belong to the same team.</i>

94
00:09:39,784 --> 00:09:43,496
<i>Look, we're social elites.</i>

95
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:46,749
<i>Fight, going public is difficult.</i>

96
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:50,294
<i>Our strong will leads us to light.</i>

97
00:09:50,377 --> 00:09:53,881
<i>We're the accounting team:
Miky, Mary, Michael, Martin</i>

98
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:55,216
<i>I'm Sophie.</i>

99
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,551
<i>I don't have an English name.</i>

100
00:09:57,635 --> 00:10:01,138
<i>We'll do a financial checkup to check
if you're sick or not.</i>

101
00:10:01,222 --> 00:10:04,725
<i>We'll do an accounting blood test
to see if it's clean.</i>

102
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:08,479
<i>With our Midas touch
you'll have no problems.</i>

103
00:10:08,562 --> 00:10:11,857
<i>All the numbers will become artworks
under your cooperation.</i>

104
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:15,903
<i>We're so professional that
we do things with might.</i>

105
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:19,782
Morning, Chairman.

106
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:25,204
Morning, Chairman.

107
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,796
David, you look fit!

108
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:34,922
Thanks a lot, Chairman.

109
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:36,340
We've been busy going public.

110
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:37,716
Not much time for exercise.

111
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:02,883
Do you know the relationship
between Chairman Ho and CEO Chang?

112
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:04,743
Chang used to be Ho's secretary.

113
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:07,204
She's been working for him
until he becomes a big shot.

114
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:08,956
She's also his mistress.

115
00:11:09,123 --> 00:11:11,041
Stop it.

116
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,294
They've been in love for 20 years.

117
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:15,838
Ho's wife is a big shot.

118
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,258
Her family is the financial source
of our head office.

119
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:20,676
Poor Chang is just a...

120
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:22,761
CEO.

121
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:28,017
<i>Why no one dares to speak louder!</i>

122
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,561
Let me introduce Jones & Sunn.

123
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:32,938
It grows from a small agent

124
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:35,858
to the biggest trading company
going public today.

125
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:37,443
It's all about guts.

126
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:39,778
What others dare not do, she dares.

127
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:41,697
What others can't think of, she can.

128
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:44,867
Where others are afraid to
take accountability, she's not afraid.

129
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,285
From fancy food,

130
00:11:46,535 --> 00:11:48,579
foreign wines, house appliances,

131
00:11:48,704 --> 00:11:50,623
to the indispensable cosmetics for women.

132
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:53,083
Supermarkets, department stores,

133
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,252
the most eye-catching shelf space.

134
00:11:55,336 --> 00:11:58,797
It is the joint effort of all of you.

135
00:11:58,881 --> 00:12:02,551
My elite team is aiming for...

136
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:04,720
...a more ambitious goal.

137
00:12:04,803 --> 00:12:08,224
<i>Listen, the loyal
chant is charming.</i>

138
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:11,602
<i>Listen, the money is mellifluous.</i>

139
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:15,064
<i>Look, we'll build a
financial empire,</i>

140
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:18,567
<i>with one heart.</i>

141
00:12:19,276 --> 00:12:20,319
Raising money,

142
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:21,570
expanding business,

143
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,573
reigning over Asia, going international.

144
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,327
<i>Look, we belong to the same team.</i>

145
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,413
<i>Look, we're social elites.</i>

146
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:35,167
<i>Look, we'll build a
financial empire</i>

147
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:38,587
<i>with one heart.</i>

148
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:41,298
All employees will be given

149
00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:42,841
pre-emptive rights as bonus.

150
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:46,303
<i>We're one big family</i>

151
00:12:46,553 --> 00:12:52,309
<i>with one heart.</i>

152
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:08,117
You two are lucky...

153
00:13:08,784 --> 00:13:10,452
...to learn from me.

154
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:13,163
Can you make it or not?

155
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:19,545
Say it out loud!

156
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:22,381
I dread seeing youngsters,

157
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:24,591
who only shake or nod their heads,

158
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:26,760
or show me silly smiles.

159
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:28,679
You got to talk in our business.

160
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:30,764
It's important to be talkative.

161
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:32,224
We can make it.

162
00:13:32,474 --> 00:13:33,475
We can make it.

163
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:37,146
Draft an email for me

164
00:13:37,229 --> 00:13:38,856
to the wine factories in France.

165
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:40,691
I'll tell you the address.

166
00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:42,192
Tell them:

167
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:45,529
although the government announced
wine tax relief months ago,

168
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:48,532
the exchange rate of Euro remains high.

169
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:52,828
Our profits haven't
increased in proportion.

170
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:56,040
Besides, we have fierce competitors
in Hong Kong

171
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:02,046
and we've built more wine warehouses.

172
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:03,297
In the short term,

173
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,799
our profits won't be much higher.

174
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,093
For the present price,

175
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:09,970
we would ask for a six-year contract.

176
00:14:10,054 --> 00:14:11,930
If they insist on a three-year contract,

177
00:14:12,014 --> 00:14:13,265
tell them to lower the price.

178
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:16,018
Can you finish it in half an hour?

179
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:17,644
It's ready.

180
00:14:20,522 --> 00:14:21,648
Show me.

181
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:30,741
Where did you graduate from?

182
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,369
An economics major at Harvard.

183
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:36,038
Tell me, with your credentials,

184
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:38,707
why you work here as an assistant?

185
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:42,544
Tell the tell able truth.

186
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:44,671
Because I'm inexperienced,

187
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:47,049
I would like to learn more.

188
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:50,761
You went to Harvard.
Your family must be rich.

189
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:52,638
What do your parents do?

190
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:54,723
Be brief and vague.

191
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,600
They do business.

192
00:14:56,725 --> 00:14:57,976
What kind of business?

193
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:01,480
My father owns a siu mei restaurant.

194
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,361
Make it more convincing.

195
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:08,987
The landlord's raising the rent

196
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:10,572
and my father's worried.

197
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:12,408
Evade by asking questions.

198
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:14,660
David, do you need any documents
for tomorrow's meeting?

199
00:15:14,743 --> 00:15:17,037
Maybe Lee Nian and I can help you?

200
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:19,498
Yes! We can prepare something for you.

201
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:22,334
The applicants' CVs
normally come through me.

202
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:25,504
But I don't recall seeing yours.

203
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:30,342
Did Chang interview you herself?

204
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:32,344
Or you're hired by the head office?

205
00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:35,055
Do you know anyone from the head office?

206
00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:41,937
My name is Lee Xiang,
Lee for Ang Lee, Xiang for dream.

207
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:44,440
David.

208
00:15:45,274 --> 00:15:46,358
Busy?

209
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:47,609
Not really.

210
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,112
You're free to ¿o!

211
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:53,365
Someone will come to your rescue

212
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:54,992
if you need help.

213
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:57,035
Sorry.

214
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,745
I misremembered your name.

215
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:01,123
I remember now, Lee Xiang.

216
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:18,932
Come over, quick!

217
00:16:19,016 --> 00:16:21,351
Marketing is all about efficiency.

218
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,395
<i>These products are misplaced.</i>

219
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,938
<i>This is too high, that is too low.</i>

220
00:16:25,022 --> 00:16:27,566
<i>Look carefully and take notes.</i>

221
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:29,651
<i>How's the sales?</i>

222
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:30,903
<i>Which is the best-seller?</i>

223
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:33,071
<i>Look carefully and take notes.</i>

224
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:35,574
<i>Don't just look at the crowd.</i>

225
00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:37,075
<i>How many carry our bags?</i>

226
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:39,620
<i>Look carefully and take notes.</i>

227
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:42,372
<i>Customers' eyes and minds.</i>

228
00:16:42,456 --> 00:16:45,542
<i>Look carefully and take notes.</i>

229
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:51,340
David, I'm busy now.

230
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:53,759
<i>Looking at these brands,</i>

231
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:55,344
<i>I feel the urge and the regret.</i>

232
00:16:55,427 --> 00:16:58,180
<i>It's like falling in love.</i>

233
00:16:58,555 --> 00:16:59,890
<i>I'm dazed by their look.</i>

234
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:01,433
<i>If I don't lose my control,</i>

235
00:17:01,517 --> 00:17:04,436
<i>I would be too hypocritical.</i>

236
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:05,979
<i>I don't have enough money to buy.</i>

237
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:10,609
<i>It's sad but maybe
I will in the future.</i>

238
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,110
<i>Don't say I'm materialistic.</i>

239
00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:12,978
<i>Without famous brands,</i>

240
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:16,398
<i>your personality and life are fake.</i>

241
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:24,081
<i>I'll work hard.</i>

242
00:17:24,248 --> 00:17:28,210
<i>I can do everything in
exchange for my love.</i>

243
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:30,337
<i>No purchase, no happiness.</i>

244
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,548
<i>I love this, I love that</i>

245
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:34,758
<i>I want to take them all home.</i>

246
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,401
<i>Unless you suffer
from personality disorder,</i>

247
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:40,305
<i>you should profess your love.</i>

248
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:42,599
<i>I purchase, therefore I am</i>

249
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:47,271
<i>It's good to show
off to earn respect.</i>

250
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,010
Told you so many times.

251
00:18:18,135 --> 00:18:20,971
Not that I don't want to get married.

252
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,474
I got a raise and was promoted.

253
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:25,976
How can I leave?

254
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:28,478
I want to buy a flat.

255
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:31,023
You want to ¿o to Shanghai.

256
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,900
And the car loan.

257
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,361
And your parents.

258
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:39,865
We'll have children, right?

259
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:43,076
How much it takes to raise a child?

260
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:45,454
Hold on.

261
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,124
Hello? It's Sophie.

262
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,917
Manager Wu? I've been looking for you.

263
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:52,836
Hold on, please.

264
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:55,839
Got an important call.

265
00:18:55,922 --> 00:18:57,049
I'll call you back.

266
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:02,220
I'll call you back.

267
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:10,312
Mom,

268
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:14,608
Mom, you're smiling.

269
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:18,320
Daddy, Mom's smiling.

270
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:27,746
Do you hope that she wakes up?

271
00:19:28,664 --> 00:19:32,459
She's in a coma because she's mad at you.

272
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:38,465
It's the obstructed
blood flow in her brain.

273
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:41,301
She's not mad at me.

274
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:43,679
She's mad at you.

275
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,848
I don't know what you're thinking,

276
00:19:47,057 --> 00:19:48,892
or what you've heard.

277
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:51,937
Don't believe in gossip.

278
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:45,323
<i>I don't want to be ordinary.</i>

279
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:50,912
<i>I want to become closer
and closer to my dream.</i>

280
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:54,249
<i>I want to talk to my boss about</i>

281
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:57,711
<i>my life, my dream,</i>

282
00:20:57,794 --> 00:21:00,213
<i>and my belief.</i>

283
00:21:00,297 --> 00:21:01,298
Is it good?

284
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:02,340
It is good.

285
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:04,342
<i>I want to be the pillar of society,</i>

286
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:06,178
<i>to think, to do,</i>

287
00:21:06,261 --> 00:21:09,389
<i>and to take responsibility.</i>

288
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:11,183
<i>I want to be enthusiastic,</i>

289
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:12,976
<i>to shine,</i>

290
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:16,229
<i>and to be a model employee.</i>

291
00:21:16,438 --> 00:21:19,649
<i>I want to be promoted
and successful,</i>

292
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:23,403
<i>but I'm anxious about it.</i>

293
00:21:24,863 --> 00:21:31,328
<i>This is the dream that obsesses me.</i>

294
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,166
<i>I want to rush to pay
the bills for my friends.</i>

295
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:37,042
Let me take the bills.

296
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:41,838
<i>I want everyone to
see me doing great.</i>

297
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:43,381
<i>I want to tell everyone that</i>

298
00:21:43,465 --> 00:21:46,635
<i>I'm busy but I'll be
busier tomorrow.</i>

299
00:21:46,718 --> 00:21:50,055
<i>I'm everywhere every day.</i>

300
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:54,226
<i>I'm indispensable,
not an egg-laying chicken.</i>

301
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:58,730
<i>I'm Lee Xiang.</i>

302
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,491
Morning, Ms. Chang.

303
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:14,162
Hot lemon water, thank you.

304
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,292
OK, I see you.

305
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,295
I'm in a rush to trade.

306
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:23,338
- Sorry.
- Your coffee.

307
00:22:23,421 --> 00:22:25,173
Good morning. Thanks.

308
00:22:26,091 --> 00:22:27,509
What's new?

309
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:30,303
Lehman Minibonds are sure profitable.

310
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:32,848
This accumulator is hot.

311
00:22:33,056 --> 00:22:34,766
HSBC just distributed dividends.

312
00:22:36,017 --> 00:22:39,396
Perfect time to buy.

313
00:22:39,688 --> 00:22:40,522
Great!

314
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:45,235
OK.

315
00:22:48,405 --> 00:22:50,282
Chang told me to sell 005.

316
00:22:50,991 --> 00:22:52,534
But I expect it to ¿o higher.

317
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:54,160
Sell it

318
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:55,620
and buy what you just said...

319
00:22:55,704 --> 00:22:56,872
- Accumulator?
- Accumulator

320
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:57,873
How much?

321
00:22:58,206 --> 00:22:59,249
All in.

322
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:00,876
All in? Have you asked Chang?

323
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,961
Put them all under my account.

324
00:23:03,211 --> 00:23:04,379
It's OK.

325
00:23:04,754 --> 00:23:05,881
If it keeps rising,

326
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:08,008
profit will double in less than a month.

327
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,343
Double!

328
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,639
Cheers! Double!

329
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:17,976
Black coffee for CEO Chang.

330
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:19,227
Sophie...

331
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:20,145
Milk.

332
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:22,063
Hot milk for Sophie.

333
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:23,690
Kevin...

334
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:25,233
Oolong tea.

335
00:23:25,692 --> 00:23:27,944
So exciting! It's like
going to the battlefield.

336
00:23:28,486 --> 00:23:31,031
Can you tell who Kevin and Sophie are?

337
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:32,365
And the rest?

338
00:23:32,949 --> 00:23:34,200
Get upstairs first.

339
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:37,996
I don't think those teenage girls

340
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:40,040
have the money to buy cosmetics!

341
00:23:40,248 --> 00:23:41,249
We shouldn't neglect

342
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,501
the buying power of teenage girls.

343
00:23:44,502 --> 00:23:46,922
Lancome wants to open
a specialty store this year

344
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:49,257
because the department stores can
no longer accommodate

345
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:50,258
the increasing sales of cosmetics

346
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:52,469
and the cutthroat
competition between brands.

347
00:23:52,552 --> 00:23:53,470
Another issue is

348
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:56,556
the rising cost of samples

349
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,517
distributed at department stores.

350
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:01,978
Who said oil price couldn't
rise above USD 100?

351
00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:03,980
-005 up again!
- David.

352
00:24:04,147 --> 00:24:06,274
Cosmetics is not my forte

353
00:24:06,691 --> 00:24:08,693
but I heard MADAME

354
00:24:08,818 --> 00:24:11,321
won't renew their contracts with Fungchoi.

355
00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:13,907
Is the image of MADAME

356
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,367
too similar to Lancome?

357
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:16,952
More brands we represent,

358
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:19,079
more international we become.

359
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:20,830
It's easier said than done.

360
00:24:21,331 --> 00:24:23,500
Who should make it work?

361
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:24,417
John, have you counted

362
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:27,754
how many bottles to sell to teenagers

363
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:31,424
to match one eye cream of MADAME?

364
00:24:32,258 --> 00:24:33,009
Have you calculated?

365
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:35,470
MADAM E's eye cream is priced at $880.

366
00:24:35,553 --> 00:24:37,555
And we buy it for $150.

367
00:24:38,431 --> 00:24:39,599
Why didn't you answer my call?

368
00:24:39,683 --> 00:24:42,686
You don't reply to my text and
your phone is always off.

369
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:44,688
Chang,

370
00:24:44,771 --> 00:24:46,106
I'm taking leave to ¿o back to Hangzhou.

371
00:24:46,189 --> 00:24:48,316
Is Fungchoi not renewing
contracts with MADAME

372
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,318
or the other way around?

373
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:52,862
Of course MADAME is not renewing
contracts with Fungchoi.

374
00:24:52,946 --> 00:24:54,614
Fungchoi can't break
into the Mainland market.

375
00:24:54,698 --> 00:24:56,533
It's all rumor.

376
00:24:56,616 --> 00:24:58,034
They've been in partnership

377
00:24:58,118 --> 00:24:59,369
for over 10 years...

378
00:24:59,452 --> 00:25:01,871
Business is just about making money.

379
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:02,747
Ben.

380
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:04,374
Yes!

381
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,168
Didn't I say I don't drink decaf?

382
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:17,012
Or you don't know how to train new hires?

383
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:21,766
Sorry, my bad! I made the coffee.

384
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,352
I don't know what is decaf or...

385
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,021
..."hi-caf."

386
00:25:28,732 --> 00:25:29,816
You're?

387
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:31,276
Lee Xiang!

388
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:32,694
Remember,

389
00:25:33,028 --> 00:25:34,904
I only drink regular black coffee.

390
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,037
Can you remember such a simple fact?

391
00:25:43,496 --> 00:25:44,748
Yes.

392
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:54,716
When can I give you
such an expensive gift,

393
00:25:54,841 --> 00:25:57,719
like the one given by Chung-ping?

394
00:25:57,802 --> 00:25:58,887
Stop dreaming.

395
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:02,766
You two are not in the same league!

396
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:05,268
Sell all the stocks

397
00:26:05,351 --> 00:26:08,521
and get the money back.

398
00:26:08,688 --> 00:26:12,108
Before going public, we need to have
a clean accounting record.

399
00:26:13,318 --> 00:26:18,198
We'd better take in one famous brand
before going public.

400
00:26:18,948 --> 00:26:20,742
You and me.

401
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:23,703
Have you ever been shortchanged?

402
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:27,791
Tell you an inside information:

403
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:29,584
the stock price will be rising.

404
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:31,628
But we need to sell it all by next week.

405
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,588
Who told you this?

406
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:36,091
Ho Chung-Ding?

407
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:40,470
Your eyes are shining
when it comes to money.

408
00:26:41,096 --> 00:26:43,598
Smart guys control money,

409
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:45,975
stupid guys are controlled by money.

410
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:49,020
Is money ever enough?

411
00:26:49,395 --> 00:26:52,732
Can you resist the temptation?

412
00:26:52,816 --> 00:26:54,818
Hasn't Sophie been
chasing you for the money?

413
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:57,237
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

414
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:10,875
Sorry,

415
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,919
I have to ¿o back to finish my work!

416
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:15,463
Bye.

417
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:18,758
Typhoon Signal No. 3 is raised.

418
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:22,345
Signal No. 8 may be raised tomorrow!

419
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,638
No need to work.

420
00:27:23,721 --> 00:27:24,514
Cheers!

421
00:27:27,892 --> 00:27:29,477
Sorry.

422
00:27:36,985 --> 00:27:38,153
Where are you going?

423
00:27:39,154 --> 00:27:41,406
Sophie, poor Sophie.

424
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:43,825
I've heard her fiance is leaving her.

425
00:27:43,908 --> 00:27:45,618
Why? Why?

426
00:27:45,702 --> 00:27:48,580
Because she doesn't want to
give up work and get married.

427
00:27:48,663 --> 00:27:49,789
That's why her fiancé

428
00:27:49,873 --> 00:27:51,499
is pissed off.

429
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,668
Sophie and her fiancé had a fight

430
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:55,962
because she wants to stay in the city.

431
00:27:56,296 --> 00:27:57,881
No.

432
00:27:57,964 --> 00:28:02,135
Sophie wants to stay in the city

433
00:28:02,218 --> 00:28:04,011
because she fell in
love with someone else.

434
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:05,763
Who is he?

435
00:28:05,847 --> 00:28:06,931
David.

436
00:28:08,808 --> 00:28:09,851
David?

437
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:12,770
How dare you spell it out!

438
00:28:12,854 --> 00:28:13,855
David?

439
00:28:24,032 --> 00:28:25,992
<i>How's work going?</i>

440
00:28:26,075 --> 00:28:26,868
Hi!

441
00:28:26,951 --> 00:28:28,286
<i>How's work going?</i>

442
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:29,370
It's all right.

443
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:31,623
<i>How's work going?</i>

444
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:32,415
I'm surviving.

445
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,751
<i>How's work going?</i>

446
00:28:35,126 --> 00:28:37,670
<i>Big mouths wait to be fired.</i>

447
00:28:38,046 --> 00:28:40,757
<i>Chirping birds take the bullet.</i>

448
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,593
<i>Too easy to find new hires.
Difficult to pass probation.</i>

449
00:28:43,676 --> 00:28:46,262
<i>Too many are after this job.</i>

450
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:48,348
<i>Use your brain, not your age.</i>

451
00:28:49,098 --> 00:28:51,226
<i>Bad mouths may well be fired.</i>

452
00:28:52,018 --> 00:28:54,854
<i>A well-dressed hen
with a high salary</i>

453
00:28:54,938 --> 00:28:57,398
<i>has a high risk of being fired.</i>

454
00:28:59,817 --> 00:29:01,486
Calm down!

455
00:29:02,946 --> 00:29:04,948
<i>Are you fine with being
a corporate slave?</i>

456
00:29:05,031 --> 00:29:05,782
It's a must.

457
00:29:05,907 --> 00:29:07,784
<i>Are you fine with
working till you drop?</i>

458
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:08,451
Perhaps.

459
00:29:08,534 --> 00:29:10,536
<i>Are you fine with being
a corporate slave?</i>

460
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,412
We're enjoying it.

461
00:29:11,496 --> 00:29:13,414
<i>Are you fine with
working till you drop?</i>

462
00:29:14,082 --> 00:29:16,417
<i>If you two survive,</i>

463
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:19,587
<i>others will be fired.</i>

464
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:22,423
<i>I work such long hours for my baby</i>

465
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:24,926
<i>who doesn't even know his daddy.</i>

466
00:29:25,134 --> 00:29:30,390
<i>I'm turning 40 but without man
or money by my side.</i>

467
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:32,183
<i>I'm obliged to my
parents in their old age</i>

468
00:29:32,267 --> 00:29:33,559
<i>and obliged to the
bank until my old age.</i>

469
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:36,354
<i>Let's not compare with one another</i>

470
00:29:36,437 --> 00:29:41,484
<i>in jobs or for survival.</i>

471
00:29:41,943 --> 00:29:47,573
<i>Even diligent pigs want to
live a decent life.</i>

472
00:29:47,657 --> 00:29:50,285
<i>Dogs have their
worries, just like us.</i>

473
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:53,079
<i>Never intent on fighting,</i>

474
00:29:53,162 --> 00:29:55,873
<i>we only want to be fed.</i>

475
00:29:55,957 --> 00:29:58,710
<i>Show me the money
and I'll bow to you.</i>

476
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:00,878
<i>Are you fine with being fired?</i>

477
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:03,798
<i>As long as it's not me.</i>

478
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:09,220
Cheers!

479
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:27,447
Don't bite your fingers.
Such beautiful hands.

480
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:40,877
Why so nervous?

481
00:30:43,046 --> 00:30:46,716
You're troubled.
Can I help you in any way?

482
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,387
I heard that you...

483
00:30:51,471 --> 00:30:53,431
I don't need consoling words.

484
00:30:54,474 --> 00:30:55,892
I don't need anyone.

485
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:57,518
Sweet talk

486
00:30:57,602 --> 00:30:59,854
doesn't work with me.

487
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:07,737
Anyway, thank you for driving me home.

488
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:23,836
Please settle the accounts immediately!

489
00:31:24,712 --> 00:31:25,880
I have a lot of works to do.

490
00:31:25,963 --> 00:31:28,007
Why you hate me so much?

491
00:31:28,716 --> 00:31:30,593
Do you think I have nothing to do

492
00:31:30,676 --> 00:31:33,388
so I drive you home in such wind and rain?

493
00:31:55,326 --> 00:31:56,577
Morning, Ms. Chang!

494
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:01,165
Morning, Ms. Chang!

495
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:03,292
- This elevator isn't for you.
- I'm in a rush.

496
00:32:03,376 --> 00:32:05,086
Let him in.

497
00:32:18,224 --> 00:32:19,684
Thanks a lot.

498
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:21,185
Why so early?

499
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:23,354
Many cosmetics

500
00:32:23,438 --> 00:32:24,439
are bound for shipment

501
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:26,607
so I come earlier today.

502
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:29,068
How long have you been here?

503
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:30,528
Almost a month.

504
00:32:31,946 --> 00:32:34,490
Your supervisor is...David?

505
00:32:34,574 --> 00:32:36,951
Yes, David.

506
00:32:39,495 --> 00:32:40,788
Can you pass the three-month probation?

507
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:42,165
Of course.

508
00:32:43,207 --> 00:32:45,418
It's not easy to please David.

509
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:46,335
No problem!

510
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:47,879
I can make it!

511
00:32:49,422 --> 00:32:51,215
Chang, do you remember who I am?

512
00:32:51,382 --> 00:32:52,925
You are Lee Xiang.

513
00:32:53,217 --> 00:32:55,219
You're loyal to your colleagues.

514
00:32:55,386 --> 00:32:56,554
I remember you.

515
00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:57,889
Thanks a lot.

516
00:33:00,892 --> 00:33:03,519
Ms. Chang, may I have a small request?

517
00:33:04,645 --> 00:33:06,022
Say it!

518
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:07,732
If I pass the three month probation,

519
00:33:07,815 --> 00:33:10,401
can I take the direct
elevator with you again?

520
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:13,196
Sure!

521
00:33:13,946 --> 00:33:14,947
Let's bet on

522
00:33:15,031 --> 00:33:16,616
whether you can make it!

523
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,205
Howard.

524
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:25,124
I'm meeting a client at 2 pm
in Eastern District.

525
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:26,167
No, you can't.

526
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:27,502
We have to inspect

527
00:33:27,585 --> 00:33:29,045
all our Southern
District counters by 2:30 pm.

528
00:33:29,128 --> 00:33:30,296
Move the afternoon

529
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:32,673
schedule to morning, can you?

530
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:33,716
Ben,

531
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,842
- Terry.
- Yes!

532
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:36,385
Have you fixed my battle shoes?

533
00:33:36,469 --> 00:33:38,095
The heels of your shoes

534
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:39,096
are broken.

535
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,681
It takes a few days to repair.

536
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:43,601
My feet will be broken.

537
00:33:44,727 --> 00:33:45,603
- Band-Aid.
- Kar-ling

538
00:33:45,686 --> 00:33:47,230
wants to swap her schedules. Understand?

539
00:33:47,313 --> 00:33:49,607
- Go!
- Bring the Band-Aid.

540
00:33:50,483 --> 00:33:51,943
Band-Aid.

541
00:33:52,276 --> 00:33:53,611
Follow me!

542
00:33:55,655 --> 00:33:59,242
Oh my!

543
00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:02,787
David, something went wrong.

544
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:06,415
What happened? Oh my...

545
00:34:06,582 --> 00:34:08,251
- Kevin, Kevin.
- Yes.

546
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:10,586
- Please come here.
- OK.

547
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:15,800
Gray & Young has finished
the first phase of audit.

548
00:34:15,883 --> 00:34:19,345
I've handed out everything
except for the 2007 account.

549
00:34:20,555 --> 00:34:21,973
What happened?

550
00:34:22,181 --> 00:34:24,058
Chang, should we consider changing
a shipping company?

551
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:26,060
Our goods were stolen again.

552
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:29,188
- Get back to work.
- Yes.

553
00:34:31,983 --> 00:34:32,942
John,

554
00:34:33,025 --> 00:34:34,527
what did the claims adjusters say?

555
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,861
Those bastards

556
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:38,406
mainly stole shipments to Mainland.

557
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:41,742
They don't steal much.
10 to 20 containers.

558
00:34:41,951 --> 00:34:43,244
Call TGS

559
00:34:43,327 --> 00:34:45,413
and ask them to give us a thorough report.

560
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:46,998
This isn't the first theft.

561
00:34:47,081 --> 00:34:50,126
Figure out how the goods got stolen.

562
00:34:50,626 --> 00:34:52,128
Follow up on this.

563
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,630
Also find out how much to ship
directly from Europe.

564
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:55,923
Yes.

565
00:34:57,675 --> 00:34:59,010
David.

566
00:35:03,723 --> 00:35:05,933
Have you read these proposals?

567
00:35:07,351 --> 00:35:09,979
I've seen the same proposals
for the past half year.

568
00:35:10,438 --> 00:35:12,189
What did "Research and
Development Department" do?

569
00:35:12,315 --> 00:35:15,109
Their ideas are all about endorsement.

570
00:35:15,276 --> 00:35:17,445
I don't want an advertising firm.

571
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,072
I want unique ideas.

572
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:24,201
The management from MADAME
will arrive next week.

573
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:27,580
Which level of executives?

574
00:35:27,663 --> 00:35:29,457
Vice President, Mr. Greenberg.

575
00:35:29,874 --> 00:35:31,500
I've arranged dinner with him.

576
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:33,586
OK, good.

577
00:35:34,253 --> 00:35:36,255
Shall we bring Kar-ling and John?

578
00:35:38,591 --> 00:35:40,426
Don't we have other talent?

579
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,848
Bring Kat and Lee Xiang.

580
00:35:46,932 --> 00:35:48,476
Lee Xiang?

581
00:35:49,518 --> 00:35:50,811
Vice CEO Wang,

582
00:35:50,895 --> 00:35:52,271
you've been too busy investing in stocks

583
00:35:52,355 --> 00:35:54,774
to know your new recruits?

584
00:35:55,107 --> 00:35:58,361
Lee Xiang, Lee for Ang Lee,
Xiang for dream.

585
00:35:58,694 --> 00:36:00,863
He reminds me of a younger you.

586
00:36:05,618 --> 00:36:08,412
Auntie.

587
00:36:09,246 --> 00:36:10,706
David said it's urgent.

588
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,749
Please sign it immediately.

589
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:13,084
Take it to my secretary.

590
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:14,460
I thought you were leaving.

591
00:36:14,794 --> 00:36:17,004
I don't sign documents
without reading them first.

592
00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:20,716
By the way, address me as Ms. Chang.

593
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:22,885
There's no such thing
as Uncle or Auntie here.

594
00:36:23,094 --> 00:36:24,679
Sorry.

595
00:36:25,054 --> 00:36:27,848
And don't ask your
driver to drive you to work.

596
00:36:28,015 --> 00:36:30,768
Learn to take the subway and bus.

597
00:36:31,394 --> 00:36:33,229
Don't wear brand-name clothing.

598
00:36:34,313 --> 00:36:36,148
People will suspect your true identity,

599
00:36:36,524 --> 00:36:38,901
or think you have part-time jobs.

600
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:42,405
People gossip-

601
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,241
No one else will look out for you.

602
00:36:45,825 --> 00:36:46,784
Understood.

603
00:36:48,703 --> 00:36:52,873
We are very pleased to have
the Vice Chairman of MADAME,

604
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:53,958
Mr. Greenberg,

605
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:57,586
and his wonderful team
to be here with us tonight.

606
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,214
Thank you for coming, welcome!

607
00:37:01,549 --> 00:37:05,428
I hope you'll enjoy the champagne
we've chosen for you.

608
00:37:05,678 --> 00:37:09,432
Ms. Winnie Chang
apologizes for her absence,

609
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:13,519
but she did pick the restaurant
and the wine herself.

610
00:37:15,688 --> 00:37:17,565
Anyway, Mr. Greenberg,

611
00:37:17,857 --> 00:37:21,861
Our company takes this meeting seriously.

612
00:37:24,363 --> 00:37:28,242
I'd like to introduce
you to this elite team

613
00:37:28,451 --> 00:37:31,454
that will help you

614
00:37:31,537 --> 00:37:35,583
develop M Cosmetics.

615
00:37:37,752 --> 00:37:40,588
And please join me
to look at this direction.

616
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:44,925
The direction of China!

617
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:50,598
And yes! The whole world is now
looking at this direction!

618
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,642
I'm sure you know that our head office

619
00:37:53,726 --> 00:37:58,481
has been doing business in Mainland
for more than 15 years.

620
00:37:58,814 --> 00:38:00,399
Translate.

621
00:38:07,198 --> 00:38:08,783
Mr. Greenberg,

622
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:13,871
You're now looking at the best team
your company can rely on to expand

623
00:38:13,954 --> 00:38:16,999
the growth of MADAME cosmetics.

624
00:38:17,124 --> 00:38:21,587
Also, I'd like for you
to look this direction,

625
00:38:22,004 --> 00:38:25,382
which is the direction of China!

626
00:38:27,718 --> 00:38:30,179
I told you sooner or
later the American system

627
00:38:30,262 --> 00:38:32,097
of spending future money would collapse.

628
00:38:32,223 --> 00:38:34,141
It takes a formidable amount of money

629
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:36,310
to rescue the "subprime mortgage crisis."

630
00:38:36,644 --> 00:38:39,355
It won't affect China!

631
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,859
Mr. Ho, is your inside
information reliable?

632
00:38:44,735 --> 00:38:47,863
- Will it affect your IPO?
- Don't worry.

633
00:38:48,197 --> 00:38:50,199
But the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy

634
00:38:50,282 --> 00:38:53,202
will more or less affect the
whole world economically.

635
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:55,496
My company is simple and clean,

636
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:57,081
no records of deficits.

637
00:38:57,164 --> 00:38:58,958
Will there be any
problems with going public?

638
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,835
That's good!

639
00:39:01,293 --> 00:39:02,211
That's great!

640
00:39:02,294 --> 00:39:03,879
Cheers.

641
00:39:04,797 --> 00:39:06,131
Thank you again for coming.

642
00:39:06,215 --> 00:39:09,510
To new venture!

643
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:13,848
There won't be any problems. Cheers!

644
00:39:20,396 --> 00:39:22,439
Excuse me, Mr. Greenberg.

645
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:26,819
If you're free,

646
00:39:26,902 --> 00:39:31,156
what do you say we
meet sometime like Tuesday?

647
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,116
Tuesday is great.

648
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:35,703
I've got some small gifts for you.

649
00:39:35,828 --> 00:39:37,496
Hope you like them.

650
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,039
You're too kind.

651
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:41,375
Everyone has one.

652
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:43,127
This is impressive!

653
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,005
Since we're enjoying this wonderful wine,

654
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:47,882
I think...

655
00:39:48,257 --> 00:39:50,593
A toast to new friends...

656
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:53,345
- ...and working closely together!
- Sure.

657
00:39:55,014 --> 00:39:55,764
How's the wine?

658
00:39:55,848 --> 00:39:56,932
- Which vintage year?
-1982

659
00:39:57,016 --> 00:39:57,725
1982?

660
00:39:57,808 --> 00:39:58,684
Should be alright.

661
00:39:58,851 --> 00:40:02,271
What era is it now?

662
00:40:02,354 --> 00:40:03,230
What era?

663
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:05,065
It is an era of financial dominance!

664
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,276
Come on, be smart.

665
00:40:08,611 --> 00:40:10,237
Working is nothing.

666
00:40:10,362 --> 00:40:11,697
Look at me.

667
00:40:12,364 --> 00:40:13,699
You don't have to be that hard-working.

668
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:16,619
I make a few phone calls and
earn more than my salary.

669
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:19,413
It's gambling. The stake is too high!

670
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:25,044
Life is gambling.

671
00:40:25,252 --> 00:40:26,253
Your future depends on

672
00:40:26,337 --> 00:40:27,796
how much you put in now!

673
00:40:28,464 --> 00:40:32,468
Hubby, look at my bag. Good?

674
00:40:33,636 --> 00:40:36,138
Women are happier with bags

675
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:37,973
than with husbands.

676
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:39,808
You know nothing about bags.

677
00:40:39,892 --> 00:40:42,519
This is a limited edition.
Only ten of them in the world.

678
00:40:42,603 --> 00:40:45,272
Your limited edition hubby
is one of a kind too!

679
00:40:46,565 --> 00:40:50,444
An accumulator allows you to buy
in stocks at a 70% discount.

680
00:40:50,736 --> 00:40:54,323
You can sign a half-year, 9-month,
or one-year contract.

681
00:40:54,406 --> 00:40:55,658
Best of all,

682
00:40:56,825 --> 00:40:59,787
you only need one third of the principal.

683
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:04,375
If the stock rises by 5%,
the contract will be terminated.

684
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:05,876
Profits...

685
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:10,089
...are in your pockets.

686
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:14,885
- I don't get it.
- Never mind!

687
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:17,388
Join the game if you dare!

688
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:25,062
- Come visit us in Shanghai,
- Thanks for coming.

689
00:41:25,145 --> 00:41:27,314
- Mrs. Ho.
- Take care.

690
00:41:27,398 --> 00:41:28,774
We can ¿o to Hangzhou together.

691
00:41:28,857 --> 00:41:30,609
I love Hangzhou.

692
00:41:30,693 --> 00:41:33,404
Come in September and we can have
some seasonal crabs.

693
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:36,907
- Thank you!
- Yes! Crabs are so tasty!

694
00:41:38,033 --> 00:41:40,786
Thank you everyone again.

695
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:42,246
Thank you.

696
00:41:42,454 --> 00:41:44,873
Thank you Ms. Chang and Mr. Ho.

697
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:49,294
Is your inside information true?

698
00:41:51,547 --> 00:41:52,965
Do you think I would lie?

699
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:55,968
Is it a good time to ¿o public then?

700
00:41:57,011 --> 00:41:59,430
It's time to see what we've got

701
00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:01,807
and to revamp our company.

702
00:42:02,224 --> 00:42:04,476
Some will leave, while others will stay,

703
00:42:04,727 --> 00:42:09,106
It's going to be bad but you can
thrive in adversity.

704
00:42:10,274 --> 00:42:11,817
Don't worry,

705
00:42:11,984 --> 00:42:15,362
thriving in adversity is my forte!

706
00:42:15,529 --> 00:42:16,697
Good.

707
00:42:17,823 --> 00:42:20,034
Ms. Chang, please sign here.

708
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:10,834
A calls me Mrs. Ho.

709
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:13,087
B calls me Mrs. Ho.

710
00:43:13,921 --> 00:43:16,590
<i>Where's she from? I don't know.</i>

711
00:43:16,673 --> 00:43:19,301
<i>Mrs. Ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho!</i>

712
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:26,558
<i>Such music to my ears</i>

713
00:43:26,642 --> 00:43:29,603
<i>makes me glow.</i>

714
00:43:32,731 --> 00:43:34,149
Chung-ping,

715
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:35,943
the way they address me

716
00:43:36,026 --> 00:43:39,655
as Mrs. Ho

717
00:43:39,988 --> 00:43:42,116
is so natural.

718
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:47,788
Hello?

719
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:49,832
A perfect battle.

720
00:43:50,415 --> 00:43:54,670
We've defeated the enemies totally.

721
00:43:55,379 --> 00:43:58,215
I just sent them back to hotel.

722
00:43:58,298 --> 00:44:00,551
Mr. Greenberg is meeting you on Tuesday.

723
00:44:00,676 --> 00:44:02,052
Good job!

724
00:44:02,553 --> 00:44:03,595
See you on Monday.

725
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:04,596
Wait,

726
00:44:04,805 --> 00:44:05,889
I'm coming over.

727
00:44:05,973 --> 00:44:08,225
I drank too much.
Don't want to drive all the way home.

728
00:44:08,433 --> 00:44:09,935
Sorry.

729
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:12,020
Not tonight.

730
00:44:13,355 --> 00:44:14,857
Don't drink and drive.

731
00:44:16,108 --> 00:44:17,442
Take care.

732
00:44:20,195 --> 00:44:21,363
Good night.

733
00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:34,126
Do you care at all?

734
00:44:36,962 --> 00:44:38,547
It's David.

735
00:44:39,047 --> 00:44:40,799
He said everything was OK.

736
00:44:41,383 --> 00:44:44,761
Be careful with MADAM E's
financial situation.

737
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,056
What do you mean?

738
00:44:48,265 --> 00:44:51,018
In a recent wine auction,

739
00:44:51,101 --> 00:44:53,812
they've sold all their best wine.

740
00:44:53,937 --> 00:44:55,272
Really?

741
00:44:57,149 --> 00:44:58,275
Short of cash?

742
00:44:58,734 --> 00:44:59,985
I don't know.

743
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,154
We should be careful.

744
00:45:08,327 --> 00:45:10,704
We can negotiate in another way.

745
00:45:12,206 --> 00:45:14,625
All depends on you, Mrs. Ho.

746
00:45:19,922 --> 00:45:21,215
Good evening, sir.

747
00:45:21,506 --> 00:45:23,759
Coffee and a pack of cigarettes.

748
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,516
Please place your Octopus Card here.

749
00:45:33,101 --> 00:45:34,811
All set.

750
00:45:35,354 --> 00:45:37,105
All set.

751
00:45:38,523 --> 00:45:40,317
Your coffee is over there.

752
00:45:47,699 --> 00:45:49,493
This way, madam.

753
00:45:54,831 --> 00:45:56,959
Cash or Octopus Card?

754
00:45:59,461 --> 00:46:00,712
Place your card here.

755
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:15,852
Hey!

756
00:46:17,354 --> 00:46:19,564
You shouldn't be drinking and driving.

757
00:46:45,674 --> 00:46:50,178
Why don't you take a rest on the couch?

758
00:47:07,612 --> 00:47:09,781
Leave after you're no longer drunk.

759
00:47:13,035 --> 00:47:13,994
Hey!

760
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:21,835
Don't think too much.

761
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:23,587
We're just colleagues.

762
00:47:24,379 --> 00:47:26,923
You're drunk for our company.

763
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,609
<i>Dong calling</i>

764
00:49:57,949 --> 00:49:59,534
<i>Vibration to loud</i>

765
00:50:15,175 --> 00:50:17,427
How was the champagne and wine?

766
00:50:20,514 --> 00:50:22,933
Steak should've been good too.

767
00:50:24,518 --> 00:50:26,853
Have you looked into MADAM E's

768
00:50:26,937 --> 00:50:29,648
sales figures in the States?

769
00:50:30,524 --> 00:50:33,026
We only have the Hong Kong sales figures.

770
00:50:33,193 --> 00:50:34,778
So you don't know?

771
00:50:35,278 --> 00:50:37,197
Let me tell you.

772
00:50:37,364 --> 00:50:39,950
This brand is famous

773
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,869
but it's declining in American,

774
00:50:42,953 --> 00:50:45,330
even South Asian market.

775
00:50:45,497 --> 00:50:47,749
They're facing fierce competition,

776
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:49,626
but without a sense of direction.

777
00:50:50,293 --> 00:50:52,796
The name is its sole valuable asset.

778
00:50:53,463 --> 00:50:55,131
So, what do you think?

779
00:50:58,927 --> 00:51:00,303
You haven't done your homework

780
00:51:00,387 --> 00:51:02,138
but at least you have some thoughts on it?

781
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:05,892
<i>Stock market is looking good,</i>

782
00:51:05,976 --> 00:51:07,561
<i>continuing the rising trend
for the past two days.</i>

783
00:51:07,644 --> 00:51:10,188
<i>The Hang Seng Index hit
a top of 20,909 points</i>

784
00:51:10,647 --> 00:51:13,275
<i>HSI temporarily
reports at 20,803 points.</i>

785
00:51:13,483 --> 00:51:15,318
<i>Turnover of 33.4 billion.</i>

786
00:51:15,485 --> 00:51:17,821
Have you come up with new ideas?

787
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:20,991
I don't ask you to be ingenious

788
00:51:21,074 --> 00:51:23,577
but at least do use your brain.

789
00:51:24,911 --> 00:51:26,162
David!

790
00:51:26,496 --> 00:51:28,164
Stop looking at the stocks!

791
00:51:29,124 --> 00:51:31,042
<i>Dong calling</i>

792
00:51:31,501 --> 00:51:32,752
No cellular phone during meeting.

793
00:51:32,836 --> 00:51:34,421
Sorry, it's family emergency.

794
00:51:34,588 --> 00:51:35,880
Talk outside.

795
00:51:44,681 --> 00:51:46,182
Morning. Here.

796
00:51:46,308 --> 00:51:48,852
Morning.

797
00:51:49,811 --> 00:51:51,062
Morning.

798
00:51:53,189 --> 00:51:55,358
You're late! Take it.

799
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,278
Go in as

800
00:51:58,361 --> 00:51:59,779
if nothing happened.

801
00:51:59,863 --> 00:52:01,740
Give me you bag. Go ¿o ¿o!

802
00:52:03,325 --> 00:52:05,201
Tell Chang Ms. Yip would like to see her.

803
00:52:09,873 --> 00:52:10,832
Ms. Chang...

804
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,713
What if MADAME stopped selling cosmetics?

805
00:52:17,213 --> 00:52:19,591
They would just ¿o out of business.

806
00:52:20,175 --> 00:52:21,718
What are you getting at?

807
00:52:22,093 --> 00:52:24,346
I saw on the Internet greeting cards
manufacturer Hallmark

808
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:26,097
started selling clothes.

809
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:29,684
I was wondering what kind of
clothes they would sell.

810
00:52:30,393 --> 00:52:32,520
Ms. Chang, Ms. Yip would like to see you.

811
00:52:32,604 --> 00:52:36,274
Wearing their clothes, you would look like
a Christmas card.

812
00:52:37,067 --> 00:52:38,526
What if MADAME

813
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,362
started selling lingerie?

814
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:47,661
What's so funny?

815
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,793
Does she want to partner
with MADAME or not?

816
00:52:54,876 --> 00:52:58,338
What's on her mind?

817
00:53:02,342 --> 00:53:06,304
<i>What she says may
not be what she thinks.</i>

818
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:07,972
<i>You'd better be careful.</i>

819
00:53:08,056 --> 00:53:11,601
<i>We can only guess what she wants.</i>

820
00:53:11,768 --> 00:53:13,728
<i>Her mind is fickle with emotion.</i>

821
00:53:13,812 --> 00:53:17,649
<i>She may think yes but says no.</i>

822
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:19,401
<i>We'd better watch out.</i>

823
00:53:19,484 --> 00:53:23,196
<i>Naive as you are,
how can you read her heart?</i>

824
00:53:23,488 --> 00:53:27,158
<i>You're also a big shot,
as powerful as her art.</i>

825
00:53:27,325 --> 00:53:32,330
<i>She seems cool. Isn't she lonely?</i>

826
00:53:32,747 --> 00:53:34,874
<i>She's a supermodel.</i>

827
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:38,420
<i>We worship her. We obey her.</i>

828
00:53:38,503 --> 00:53:42,257
<i>She's a judge.
She dispenses justice.</i>

829
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,175
<i>Can she feel nothing?</i>

830
00:53:44,259 --> 00:53:46,261
<i>She's a valuable investment,</i>

831
00:53:46,344 --> 00:53:49,931
<i>worth buying in and being with.</i>

832
00:53:50,056 --> 00:53:52,058
<i>To become her confidant,</i>

833
00:53:52,142 --> 00:53:55,854
<i>shall we write her a love letter
or concede defeat?</i>

834
00:53:55,937 --> 00:53:57,689
<i>I don't want to become her.</i>

835
00:53:57,897 --> 00:54:02,694
<i>She seems admirable
but deep in her heart</i>

836
00:54:03,069 --> 00:54:10,452
<i>Guess! Under her nose,
what are we allowed to think?</i>

837
00:54:10,702 --> 00:54:18,168
<i>Guess! In her mind, what does she want?
What's on her mind?</i>

838
00:54:18,293 --> 00:54:25,633
<i>What's on her mind?</i>

839
00:54:25,717 --> 00:54:27,343
<i>"Kat Ho"</i>

840
00:54:28,219 --> 00:54:30,555
Is this the final version

841
00:54:30,638 --> 00:54:31,723
of the stakeholders?

842
00:54:31,806 --> 00:54:34,559
Seems to be different from
what Mr. Ho has told me.

843
00:54:34,851 --> 00:54:36,728
This is the final version
from the head office.

844
00:54:36,811 --> 00:54:39,230
Should be right and won't be changed.

845
00:54:39,606 --> 00:54:42,901
Your name is on the
senior executives page.

846
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,259
The subway was so crowded today.

847
00:55:08,343 --> 00:55:10,303
I almost couldn't get on the train.

848
00:55:17,811 --> 00:55:19,437
You don't believe me, either?

849
00:55:19,562 --> 00:55:21,564
You could've asked your driver
to drive you here.

850
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,860
Kat, who are you?

851
00:55:26,486 --> 00:55:29,447
Your dad is selling siu <i>mei,</i>
but you have a driver.

852
00:55:29,781 --> 00:55:32,700
You carry a branded bag
to ¿o directly to 71st floor!

853
00:55:32,867 --> 00:55:34,702
You speak better English than David.

854
00:55:37,247 --> 00:55:38,665
Who are you?

855
00:55:43,253 --> 00:55:45,880
If I tell you the truth,

856
00:55:45,964 --> 00:55:47,882
will you keep my secret?

857
00:55:49,717 --> 00:55:51,970
My dad doesn't sell siu mei.

858
00:55:52,178 --> 00:55:53,930
Actually...

859
00:55:55,056 --> 00:55:59,227
He drives for the rich people
living in the peak.

860
00:55:59,477 --> 00:56:02,939
He loves me so much that he secretly
drives me to work sometimes.

861
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:04,983
Do you understand now?

862
00:56:12,365 --> 00:56:16,327
<i>Too many lies and too little love.</i>

863
00:56:16,411 --> 00:56:19,330
<i>Am I blushing?</i>

864
00:56:19,914 --> 00:56:23,710
<i>She's mysterious and beautiful.</i>

865
00:56:23,877 --> 00:56:27,589
<i>How can she become my close friend?</i>

866
00:56:28,715 --> 00:56:30,341
The rich family is kind to us.

867
00:56:30,425 --> 00:56:33,511
They gave me the branded bag
that they didn't want.

868
00:56:33,845 --> 00:56:35,805
The direct elevator to
71st floor was one-off.

869
00:56:36,014 --> 00:56:37,891
That security guard is my dad's friend.

870
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:40,435
I was about to be late so he helped me.

871
00:56:40,518 --> 00:56:42,604
He almost got fired because of it.

872
00:56:43,813 --> 00:56:46,941
My better English comes from hard work.

873
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,110
I'm the only child.

874
00:56:49,193 --> 00:56:50,570
I want to prove that

875
00:56:50,653 --> 00:56:52,572
I'm a good daughter.

876
00:56:52,906 --> 00:56:54,365
Do you understand?

877
00:56:54,574 --> 00:56:55,825
Yes.

878
00:56:56,075 --> 00:56:58,536
We all want to prove
ourselves to our families.

879
00:56:59,245 --> 00:57:01,122
Do you believe me?

880
00:57:02,624 --> 00:57:09,714
<i>I'm not myself.
I don't like my real self.</i>

881
00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:13,593
<i>Do you believe I like myself only</i>

882
00:57:13,676 --> 00:57:16,763
<i>if I'm unlike myself?</i>

883
00:57:17,555 --> 00:57:25,104
<i>I do because I love you too much.</i>

884
00:57:28,441 --> 00:57:30,068
I believe you.

885
00:57:39,702 --> 00:57:41,245
What are you angry at?

886
00:57:41,412 --> 00:57:43,289
Told you to sell the stocks. Did you?

887
00:57:43,373 --> 00:57:45,124
Dare I not?

888
00:57:45,249 --> 00:57:46,918
I hate myself for not being capable

889
00:57:47,085 --> 00:57:48,544
nor informed enough for you.

890
00:57:50,171 --> 00:57:51,589
Know you place. Don't ask for more.

891
00:57:51,673 --> 00:57:53,007
I got what I asked for.

892
00:57:53,091 --> 00:57:54,926
I should've known better.

893
00:57:55,093 --> 00:57:56,678
Lee Xiang is still green.

894
00:57:56,803 --> 00:57:58,012
With me, he'll be bad.

895
00:57:58,096 --> 00:58:00,039
With you, he'll become as immoral as me.

896
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:02,475
Give him

897
00:58:02,558 --> 00:58:03,977
a chance to live!

898
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,442
You pretend to be kind?

899
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:16,280
David, we are the best partners.

900
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,366
How can we harm each other?

901
00:58:18,449 --> 00:58:20,451
I just said he reminded me of you.

902
00:58:20,535 --> 00:58:21,619
What are you afraid of?

903
00:58:21,703 --> 00:58:23,037
Don't be afraid

904
00:58:29,669 --> 00:58:32,296
<i>Asian stocks plummet.</i>

905
00:58:32,463 --> 00:58:36,050
<i>Japan stocks falls 5%
to 3-year low.</i>

906
00:58:36,134 --> 00:58:38,845
<i>Korean stocks drop over 6%.</i>

907
00:58:38,928 --> 00:58:42,056
<i>Taiwan stocks drop almost 5%.</i>

908
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,391
<i>The offshore stock
market drops so much that</i>

909
00:58:43,474 --> 00:58:45,309
<i>The People's Bank of
China cuts interest rates,</i>

910
00:58:45,393 --> 00:58:47,437
<i>but it doesn't help
the Mainland stocks.</i>

911
00:58:47,645 --> 00:58:50,606
<i>Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index
falls below 2000 points</i>

912
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:52,817
<i>to 21-month low.</i>

913
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:00,783
<i>The U.S. government is likely</i>

914
00:59:00,867 --> 00:59:02,493
<i>to take over the biggest two...</i>

915
00:59:02,577 --> 00:59:05,079
<i>The U.S. government is considering
a bailout plan.</i>

916
00:59:05,246 --> 00:59:07,707
<i>Their stocks plunged</i>

917
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:09,625
<i>and the stock market suffered.</i>

918
00:59:09,959 --> 00:59:11,669
This account should be

919
00:59:11,753 --> 00:59:13,755
in 2006 rather than 2007.

920
00:59:14,422 --> 00:59:19,093
No, this account was
forwarded to us in 2007

921
00:59:20,136 --> 00:59:22,346
from the head office.

922
00:59:22,513 --> 00:59:24,015
What do you mean?

923
00:59:29,687 --> 00:59:34,150
This was forwarded to
us from the head office.

924
00:59:34,358 --> 00:59:37,195
Are we waiting for
the head office accounts?

925
00:59:39,405 --> 00:59:41,616
It's stated clearly here.

926
00:59:42,825 --> 00:59:44,827
OK, if the account belongs to 2007,

927
00:59:44,911 --> 00:59:46,913
then 2006 should be all completed.

928
00:59:47,205 --> 00:59:49,207
Let's begin looking at 2007.

929
00:59:51,626 --> 00:59:53,544
Sorry can we take a break?

930
00:59:53,836 --> 00:59:55,588
I'd like to...

931
01:00:04,097 --> 01:00:06,557
We can't sell it now.

932
01:00:07,141 --> 01:00:09,393
If we sell it now, we're finished.

933
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,729
Why?

934
01:00:12,188 --> 01:00:13,940
Why does it plunge so rapidly?

935
01:00:14,023 --> 01:00:15,108
Didn't your analysis indicate

936
01:00:15,191 --> 01:00:17,610
it would rise by 5%?

937
01:00:17,902 --> 01:00:20,154
Damn! Aren't you a financial specialist?

938
01:00:23,866 --> 01:00:25,368
Are you alright?

939
01:00:25,451 --> 01:00:27,411
I have medicine.

940
01:00:29,455 --> 01:00:33,126
David, may I smoke with you?

941
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,183
You alright?

942
01:00:50,268 --> 01:00:51,227
Sorry.

943
01:00:53,563 --> 01:00:55,439
I don't smoke.

944
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,192
Then why you smoke?

945
01:01:01,112 --> 01:01:05,575
People smoke, whether happy or not.

946
01:01:17,003 --> 01:01:18,921
What for?

947
01:01:22,133 --> 01:01:24,260
Lucky that it's just a cigarette.

948
01:01:38,983 --> 01:01:41,068
Where's your hometown, Sophie?

949
01:01:44,989 --> 01:01:46,657
Your hometown?

950
01:01:55,333 --> 01:02:03,174
<i>My hometown has good
feng shui. A good place.</i>

951
01:02:05,843 --> 01:02:13,726
<i>Youthful dreams carry me
away from the old home.</i>

952
01:02:16,562 --> 01:02:21,692
<i>The road in my hometown
is not as wide as here.</i>

953
01:02:21,943 --> 01:02:26,989
<i>Yet people on the road
don't clash with one another.</i>

954
01:02:27,365 --> 01:02:31,619
<i>It's a desire-free paradise there.</i>

955
01:02:31,702 --> 01:02:39,543
<i>Time is slow and flowing there.</i>

956
01:02:40,253 --> 01:02:42,922
<i>- In my hometown,
- There are...</i>

957
01:02:43,005 --> 01:02:44,924
<i>- we study the colors
- meandering brooks</i>

958
01:02:45,007 --> 01:02:48,302
<i>- of the heavens.
- lush reeds.</i>

959
01:02:48,386 --> 01:02:50,721
<i>We read the origins
of the universe.</i>

960
01:02:51,013 --> 01:02:55,601
<i>- Facing adversity, we fall in love
- We grow old here.</i>

961
01:02:55,685 --> 01:03:01,524
<i>- with the old home.
- It turns into the old home.</i>

962
01:03:02,024 --> 01:03:03,234
<i>There's adversity</i>

963
01:03:03,317 --> 01:03:07,238
<i>- Everywhere is the same.
- everywhere.</i>

964
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:12,410
<i>- There's adversity everywhere.
- There's discontent everywhere.</i>

965
01:03:12,576 --> 01:03:16,956
<i>The desire-free paradise
is to blame because</i>

966
01:03:17,081 --> 01:03:25,089
<i>we have too much time
to imagine and desire,</i>

967
01:03:25,339 --> 01:03:30,469
<i>to imagine and venture.</i>

968
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:39,103
<i>Venture out into the old home
that buried our youth.</i>

969
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:42,189
<i>Where to venture?</i>

970
01:03:42,273 --> 01:03:52,867
<i>Where to rush? Where to be busy?
Where to imagine?</i>

971
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:55,995
Call the factories according to the list

972
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,622
Ask in detail about
their scale of production,

973
01:03:58,914 --> 01:04:01,083
their maximal capacity

974
01:04:01,167 --> 01:04:03,169
and minimal order.

975
01:04:04,253 --> 01:04:06,172
I'll ask David

976
01:04:06,255 --> 01:04:08,090
to visit the factories with you.

977
01:04:08,507 --> 01:04:10,885
You will observe the
factories and executives.

978
01:04:12,595 --> 01:04:15,639
That's the best way to learn.

979
01:04:15,723 --> 01:04:16,807
Got you.

980
01:04:16,974 --> 01:04:20,603
Don't tell your colleagues about this.

981
01:04:21,103 --> 01:04:22,021
Got you.

982
01:04:22,104 --> 01:04:22,855
Hello?

983
01:04:22,938 --> 01:04:23,981
Is David here?

984
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,442
David and Kar-ling are out of the office.

985
01:04:26,525 --> 01:04:27,360
Yes.

986
01:04:28,986 --> 01:04:30,654
Haven't found David?

987
01:04:30,738 --> 01:04:33,324
I think he killed himself!

988
01:04:33,616 --> 01:04:36,577
Oh! My feet ache from rubbing.

989
01:04:36,786 --> 01:04:38,204
Howard's gone.

990
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:42,625
No one can get my
battle shoes back for me.

991
01:04:44,835 --> 01:04:46,170
Kat,

992
01:04:46,295 --> 01:04:49,340
¿o get them tomorrow.

993
01:04:53,886 --> 01:04:54,970
Awesome!

994
01:04:55,179 --> 01:04:56,430
You're a real mimic.

995
01:04:56,722 --> 01:04:59,767
Kar-ling's far more
capable than we imagine.

996
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,560
Her voluptuous figure
does a disservice to her.

997
01:05:02,353 --> 01:05:05,398
Don't look down upon women with big boobs.

998
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:09,360
I got brain as well as boobs.

999
01:05:13,781 --> 01:05:16,033
Kar-ling, you're jealous
of wise women like us.

1000
01:05:16,117 --> 01:05:20,621
We use brain rather than breasts to think.

1001
01:05:20,955 --> 01:05:22,123
Lee Xiang!

1002
01:05:22,206 --> 01:05:23,290
Learn from David.

1003
01:05:23,374 --> 01:05:24,708
Be smart

1004
01:05:24,792 --> 01:05:26,961
and adventurous.

1005
01:05:27,711 --> 01:05:28,712
Lee Xiang,

1006
01:05:29,046 --> 01:05:30,673
don't tell others

1007
01:05:30,756 --> 01:05:33,008
what I've told you.

1008
01:05:33,426 --> 01:05:34,885
Understand?

1009
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:36,804
What did she tell you?

1010
01:05:40,641 --> 01:05:42,643
I can't tell you.

1011
01:05:43,185 --> 01:05:45,187
Not interested at all!

1012
01:05:47,398 --> 01:05:49,984
Nothing. She...

1013
01:05:50,901 --> 01:05:52,903
She asked me to visit lingerie factories.

1014
01:05:53,904 --> 01:05:56,532
MADAME is into the lingerie industry?

1015
01:05:57,116 --> 01:05:58,742
Have we signed the contract?

1016
01:05:59,243 --> 01:06:00,744
I don't know.

1017
01:06:03,914 --> 01:06:05,416
Finally we meet.

1018
01:06:05,624 --> 01:06:07,710
I've heard so much about you,
Madame Winnie Chang.

1019
01:06:07,793 --> 01:06:09,003
How are you, Mr. Greenberg?

1020
01:06:09,086 --> 01:06:10,713
Very well, thanks.

1021
01:06:10,796 --> 01:06:12,423
Only three of you?

1022
01:06:12,715 --> 01:06:14,425
Don't you think it's enough?

1023
01:06:14,508 --> 01:06:16,469
You met David, Lee Xiang.

1024
01:06:16,802 --> 01:06:20,181
We don't really need any
unnecessary sit-in staff, do we?

1025
01:06:21,682 --> 01:06:23,017
As you say.

1026
01:06:51,754 --> 01:06:53,756
Do you know why she wants us all out?

1027
01:06:53,881 --> 01:06:55,257
I don't know.

1028
01:06:56,467 --> 01:06:59,470
Because we can only know
what she wants us to know.

1029
01:06:59,637 --> 01:07:02,848
We only need to know
what we're supposed to know.

1030
01:07:04,808 --> 01:07:06,227
Don't think that a proposal

1031
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:07,978
can make you succeed.

1032
01:07:08,812 --> 01:07:10,189
Not till you drop!

1033
01:07:14,902 --> 01:07:16,695
Feeling a sense of achievement?

1034
01:07:17,655 --> 01:07:19,365
Being in the same meeting with us?

1035
01:07:19,573 --> 01:07:20,783
No.

1036
01:07:20,866 --> 01:07:21,825
No?

1037
01:07:22,117 --> 01:07:23,786
You dare not say yes?

1038
01:07:23,869 --> 01:07:25,496
- I look down upon you.
- Yes.

1039
01:07:26,497 --> 01:07:28,707
You even made me translate your proposal.

1040
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:30,876
You want to replace me?

1041
01:07:32,711 --> 01:07:35,339
Chang said you
reminded her of a younger me.

1042
01:07:37,675 --> 01:07:39,677
I don't quite remember.

1043
01:07:44,056 --> 01:07:45,683
If you want to destroy someone,

1044
01:07:45,808 --> 01:07:50,854
give him lots of benefits...

1045
01:07:55,609 --> 01:07:59,196
...and then take them all away.

1046
01:08:01,282 --> 01:08:03,951
Promotion and destruction are
two sides of the same coin.

1047
01:08:05,703 --> 01:08:07,454
Remember my words.

1048
01:08:09,248 --> 01:08:10,874
Nice meeting you, Mr. Greenberg.

1049
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:12,418
The pleasure is all mine.

1050
01:08:14,336 --> 01:08:15,588
Mr. Greenberg,

1051
01:08:15,671 --> 01:08:18,716
it's my great pleasure
doing business with you.

1052
01:08:18,882 --> 01:08:21,969
MADAM E's future can't rely on
the traditional marketplace.

1053
01:08:22,052 --> 01:08:24,555
Bygone benefits are bygone.

1054
01:08:24,638 --> 01:08:26,307
Facing unknown crisis,

1055
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:28,726
we need to attack as well as defend.

1056
01:08:28,809 --> 01:08:31,979
MADAM E's market is threatened.

1057
01:08:32,062 --> 01:08:34,565
Let's create a new beginning.

1058
01:08:34,648 --> 01:08:36,984
A new beginning Ho
Chung-ping isn't aware of.

1059
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:39,570
A brand-new independence.

1060
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:47,328
MADAM E's new product:

1061
01:08:47,578 --> 01:08:49,913
Taking care of you, thinking of you.

1062
01:08:50,372 --> 01:08:54,460
The body-Warming, heart-warming
MADAME lingerie.

1063
01:09:02,009 --> 01:09:03,594
Morning, Chairman.

1064
01:09:03,677 --> 01:09:04,928
Morning!

1065
01:09:05,763 --> 01:09:07,014
Lee Xiang?

1066
01:09:07,431 --> 01:09:08,265
Have a seat.

1067
01:09:09,266 --> 01:09:10,893
I came as soon as I received your call.

1068
01:09:11,101 --> 01:09:12,394
Am I late?

1069
01:09:14,647 --> 01:09:16,273
People speak highly of you,

1070
01:09:16,357 --> 01:09:19,068
young, energetic, proactive, and sincere.

1071
01:09:19,276 --> 01:09:21,236
It was Ms. Chang who
gave me the opportunity.

1072
01:09:22,946 --> 01:09:25,908
She told me you have
lots of innovative ideas

1073
01:09:25,991 --> 01:09:27,201
I want to hear it from you in person.

1074
01:09:27,284 --> 01:09:31,163
You mean the heart-warming
MADAME lingerie?

1075
01:09:32,414 --> 01:09:35,042
Heart-warming rather than body-warming?

1076
01:09:35,334 --> 01:09:37,961
Ms. Chang says women
love heart-warming lingerie.

1077
01:09:39,505 --> 01:09:40,798
I have a proposal here.

1078
01:09:40,881 --> 01:09:43,425
I've been visiting factories
and comparing prices.

1079
01:09:44,718 --> 01:09:46,470
May I have a look?

1080
01:09:46,553 --> 01:09:47,846
Sure.

1081
01:09:51,975 --> 01:09:54,311
No wonder MADAME is happy.

1082
01:09:54,978 --> 01:09:56,647
We have fewer hands in the company

1083
01:09:56,772 --> 01:09:58,273
and need to open a newline.

1084
01:09:58,357 --> 01:09:59,233
Are you overworking?

1085
01:09:59,316 --> 01:10:00,567
No.

1086
01:10:00,651 --> 01:10:01,735
The team in the company

1087
01:10:01,819 --> 01:10:03,445
takes care of MADAM E's cosmetics

1088
01:10:03,654 --> 01:10:05,989
As for the new product,
Ms. Chang asked David and I

1089
01:10:06,073 --> 01:10:08,409
to produce it in small quantities.
Our colleagues know nothing about it.

1090
01:10:08,992 --> 01:10:10,661
Business secret.

1091
01:10:12,579 --> 01:10:15,499
The meeting between
us is business secret, too.

1092
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,042
Don't tell anyone.

1093
01:10:17,292 --> 01:10:18,585
Sure.

1094
01:10:19,962 --> 01:10:21,338
Young man!

1095
01:10:21,672 --> 01:10:24,842
I knew I could believe you
from the instant I saw your eyes.

1096
01:10:25,175 --> 01:10:26,510
Really?

1097
01:10:28,178 --> 01:10:29,847
Thank you, Chairman!

1098
01:10:30,681 --> 01:10:32,015
Thank you.

1099
01:10:44,445 --> 01:10:45,529
Hello?

1100
01:10:46,196 --> 01:10:48,073
How was the deal with MADAME?

1101
01:10:48,991 --> 01:10:50,534
Too early to tell!

1102
01:10:51,952 --> 01:10:53,579
What did they say?

1103
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:57,833
They're tough and demanding.

1104
01:10:58,208 --> 01:11:00,043
Not necessarily a sure success.

1105
01:11:00,961 --> 01:11:01,879
Are they?

1106
01:11:02,045 --> 01:11:03,380
Yes!

1107
01:11:04,047 --> 01:11:05,924
The market isn't good.

1108
01:11:06,675 --> 01:11:08,385
There's no hurry.

1109
01:11:11,388 --> 01:11:12,431
Right.

1110
01:11:12,765 --> 01:11:13,807
I agree with you.

1111
01:11:13,891 --> 01:11:16,268
OK, bye.

1112

wolf goes hunting.</i>

1116
01:11:57,893 --> 01:12:06,360
<i>Why eat and sleep and
hear only the thundering?</i>

1117
01:12:06,443 --> 01:12:14,576
<i>The wind blowing from the
north-southwest is inedible.</i>

1118
01:12:14,952 --> 01:12:23,460
<i>I hear the big gray
wolf fears thundering.</i>

1119
01:12:23,627 --> 01:12:32,135
<i>It is the heart of the most
brilliant pig that is in turmoil.</i>

ends up in the wolf's entrails.</i>

1121
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:51,446
<i>Look, who's the storyteller
that fears the wind?</i>

1122
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:59,955
<i>Look, who doubts the story
after hearing the story?</i>

1123

01:13:15,846 --> 01:13:17,222

We're late.

01:14:23,538 --> 01:14:25,499
She had been awake for only 15 minutes.

1149

Ten minutes, five minutes,
even one minute.

I wish I could've made it.

She's unwilling to let ¿o because of us.

My love toward you and
Mom will never change.

1154

You always say so.

1155
01:15:00,325 --> 01:15:04,329
I can't pretend not to hear the gossip.

I can't pretend Chang isn't there.

1157
01:15:11,753 --> 01:15:12,838
Daddy,

1158
01:15:14,589 --> 01:15:16,299
do you love Chang?

1159
01:15:21,596 --> 01:15:23,557
Do you know what's on her mind?

1160
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:26,393
What she's doing behind you?

1161
01:15:27,352 --> 01:15:30,397
What should I know?

1162
01:15:31,106 --> 01:15:34,234
David's always with her.

1163
01:15:34,693 --> 01:15:36,862
The naive Lee Xiang is busy

1164
01:15:36,945 --> 01:15:39,823
with her secret MADAME plan.

1165
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:41,950
Do you know it?

1166
01:15:42,534 --> 01:15:44,578
Do you know it?

1167
01:15:56,965 --> 01:15:59,634
There are things I don't need to know.

1168
01:16:01,678 --> 01:16:04,848
There are things I don't want to know.

1169
01:16:05,891 --> 01:16:07,934
If I want to know,

1170
01:16:08,435 --> 01:16:10,228
who can stop me?

1171
01:16:20,655 --> 01:16:22,115
I knew it.

1172
01:16:25,035 --> 01:16:27,829
I knew you can't stand being lonely.

1173
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:36,254
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1174
01:16:39,841 --> 01:16:45,764
Is this the love we used to believe in?

1175
01:17:16,753 --> 01:17:24,052
<i>Imagine you passing through
the crowd towards me.</i>

1176
01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:31,268
<i>Should I look forward to it
or fear waiting for you?</i>

1177
01:17:31,893 --> 01:17:38,108
<i>Love is between "already" and "not
yet," between presence and absence.</i>

1178
01:17:39,276 --> 01:17:46,867
<i>You just stand in the wind imagining
where I could've been.</i>

1179
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:53,665
<i>I'm looking at you looking at the
distance between our gaze.</i>

1180
01:17:54,332 --> 01:18:01,339
<i>I can't hear what you're hearing.</i>

1181
01:18:01,882 --> 01:18:05,385
<i>Can I truly love you</i>

1182
01:18:05,468 --> 01:18:08,805
<i>without really knowing you?</i>

1183
01:18:09,431 --> 01:18:16,855
<i>I love "my ideal self. "</i>

1184
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:18,732
<i>Not that I don't care.</i>

1185
01:18:18,815 --> 01:18:24,154
<i>I do care about what
lies ahead of us.</i>

1186
01:18:24,404 --> 01:18:28,033
<i>Not that I'm not
willing to say I do.</i>

1187
01:18:28,116 --> 01:18:31,745
<i>But I prefer to remain silent.</i>

1188
01:18:31,953 --> 01:18:35,582
<i>We're not yet in a relationship</i>

1189
01:18:35,665 --> 01:18:39,211
<i>but already afraid of ending it.</i>

1190
01:18:39,377 --> 01:18:43,131
<i>Not that I don't worry.</i>

1191
01:18:43,215 --> 01:18:47,010
<i>But I prefer to be carefree.</i>

1192
01:18:47,093 --> 01:18:50,680
<i>When I'm imagining you,</i>

1193
01:18:50,764 --> 01:18:54,017
<i>your eyes keep me company.</i>

1194
01:18:54,476 --> 01:18:58,063
<i>When I'm looking at you,</i>

1195
01:18:58,146 --> 01:19:01,775
<i>your face encounters mine.</i>

1196
01:19:01,858 --> 01:19:03,777
<i>I don't really know you.</i>

1197
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:08,782
<i>I don't know if I've been in love
with you for a long time.</i>

1198
01:19:09,324 --> 01:19:16,790
<i>We love "our ideal selves."</i>

1199
01:19:16,998 --> 01:19:26,341
<i>We love "our ideal selves" only
because you love them too.</i>

1200
01:19:31,596 --> 01:19:33,648
I've been waiting for you
for over half an hour.

1201
01:19:38,853 --> 01:19:41,856
I missed the previous ferry.
Please don't be angry.

1202
01:19:42,023 --> 01:19:43,817
I am too busy today.

1203
01:19:44,025 --> 01:19:46,778
Do you know how many lingerie
factories I visited today?

1204
01:19:48,947 --> 01:19:50,365
Look at the camera

1205
01:19:52,409 --> 01:19:54,661
It's a gift from Chang.

1206
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:57,163
If you're busy, don't ask me out.

1207
01:19:57,247 --> 01:19:58,957
Why didn't you call and tell me that
you would be late?

1208
01:19:59,082 --> 01:20:00,000
Let me take you to a pizza restaurant.

1209
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:01,126
No, I'm going home.

1210
01:20:01,209 --> 01:20:02,585
Let me see you home.

1211
01:20:02,711 --> 01:20:04,045
No.

1212
01:20:04,421 --> 01:20:06,047
Why don't you let me see you home?

1213
01:20:06,965 --> 01:20:08,508
I want to see where you live,

1214
01:20:08,591 --> 01:20:10,552
what's your daily life like?

1215
01:20:10,635 --> 01:20:12,762
Is your family going to like me?

1216
01:20:12,929 --> 01:20:14,014
Lee Xiang,

1217
01:20:14,806 --> 01:20:16,182
you've changed.

1218
01:20:17,309 --> 01:20:19,227
Kat, I haven't.

1219
01:20:20,312 --> 01:20:21,938
I haven't changed.

1220
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:23,898
I'm honest with you.

1221
01:20:23,982 --> 01:20:25,692
I told you everything I knew.

1222
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:29,487
Is being honest so difficult?

1223
01:20:29,988 --> 01:20:31,197
Isn't this the principle

1224
01:20:31,281 --> 01:20:33,366
we've learned at home and at school?

1225
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:35,660
You mean I've changed?

1226
01:20:43,168 --> 01:20:44,252
Hello? Mr. Lin.

1227
01:20:45,462 --> 01:20:46,671
Are you out of your mind?

1228
01:20:46,755 --> 01:20:48,465
I've looking for you in your factory

1229
01:20:48,548 --> 01:20:50,675
and you were not there!

1230
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,637
Please show up tomorrow.

1231
01:21:33,968 --> 01:21:36,012
I'm waiting for your bank slips.

1232
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:40,141
Have to submit the
"Profit and Loss" of 2007.

1233
01:21:45,063 --> 01:21:47,023
Let me see.

1234
01:21:53,822 --> 01:21:55,281
See what?

1235
01:21:56,408 --> 01:21:59,285
Let me see if the account is right.

1236
01:22:07,168 --> 01:22:08,503
I broke up with Dong.

1237
01:22:14,217 --> 01:22:16,803
I decided to break up with Dong.

1238
01:22:17,387 --> 01:22:19,055
Is the account right?

1239
01:22:25,019 --> 01:22:26,229
I made the decision

1240
01:22:26,312 --> 01:22:31,526
and was sad.

1241
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:35,196
I really feel sad.

1242
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:40,034
The only thing

1243
01:22:40,118 --> 01:22:42,871
I wanted to do is find you

1244
01:22:44,205 --> 01:22:46,374
and tell you that I'm not marrying him.

1245
01:22:47,459 --> 01:22:48,751
Great!

1246
01:22:49,043 --> 01:22:52,630
- Is it great?
- Yes.

1247
01:22:53,298 --> 01:22:54,549
Is it?

1248
01:23:00,472 --> 01:23:02,724
We're the perfect match.

1249
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:12,901
You're the woman of my life.

1250
01:23:30,335 --> 01:23:32,962
I won't let you feel lonely anymore.

1251
01:23:45,934 --> 01:23:49,145
Help me out of this crisis.

1252
01:23:49,229 --> 01:23:50,563
Fill in the number.

1253
01:23:51,523 --> 01:23:52,607
Change the total number.

1254
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:54,943
I'll find the receipts later.

1255
01:23:59,781 --> 01:24:01,449
What are you talking about?

1256
01:24:02,575 --> 01:24:04,035
What am I talking about?

1257
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:06,704
About our future!

1258
01:24:07,038 --> 01:24:09,916
You're the only woman who cares for me.

1259
01:24:10,208 --> 01:24:13,169
After IPO, Chang will have other plans.

1260
01:24:13,253 --> 01:24:15,797
As soon as she leaves,
I'm the one who can replace her.

1261
01:24:16,172 --> 01:24:17,924
You'll never see me again

1262
01:24:18,007 --> 01:24:20,468
if anything goes wrong now.

1263
01:24:24,681 --> 01:24:27,183
Or you don't want to see me again?

1264
01:24:29,477 --> 01:24:31,104
I'm so stupid.

1265
01:24:32,105 --> 01:24:34,232
You've never loved me.

1266
01:24:34,774 --> 01:24:36,276
I thought you did.

1267
01:24:36,943 --> 01:24:38,319
OK.

1268
01:24:39,904 --> 01:24:41,239
Do you have any idea

1269
01:24:41,322 --> 01:24:43,241
what you're asking is illegal?

1270
01:24:43,324 --> 01:24:45,451
It's temporary.
I'll put the money back soon.

1271
01:24:45,535 --> 01:24:46,995
What?

1272
01:24:53,167 --> 01:24:54,836
You're taking advantage of me.

1273
01:24:58,006 --> 01:25:01,175
Your relationship with Chang is dubious.

1274
01:25:03,094 --> 01:25:03,970
If we're in a dubious relationship,

1275
01:25:04,053 --> 01:25:06,347
I would just ask her to solve this.

1276
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,768
Because of you, I want to keep
a distance from her.

1277
01:25:10,935 --> 01:25:14,981
I want everyone to know I love you.

1278
01:25:15,732 --> 01:25:17,692
Don't bite your nails. Fix it for me.

1279
01:25:17,859 --> 01:25:19,861
I'll take full responsibility.
Don't bite your nails!

1280
01:25:25,116 --> 01:25:28,536
- Hit me...
- Stop it. That's enough.

1281
01:25:29,203 --> 01:25:31,789
If I didn't hit you,
how could I see who you are?

1282
01:25:32,206 --> 01:25:33,916
Look at me.

1283
01:25:38,921 --> 01:25:40,632
Let's see each other clearly...

1284
01:25:42,717 --> 01:25:45,595
We are in need of each other, Sophie.

1285
01:25:51,851 --> 01:25:54,020
You need someone

1286
01:25:54,103 --> 01:25:56,064
who knows you better.

1287
01:25:58,024 --> 01:25:59,942
I won't leave you.

1288
01:26:08,743 --> 01:26:10,411
Help me...

1289
01:26:12,413 --> 01:26:17,085
Help me...

1290
01:26:18,503 --> 01:26:20,338
Help us.

1291
01:26:23,424 --> 01:26:33,267
<i>I need your love,
just as you need my devotion.</i>

1292
01:26:33,393 --> 01:26:34,477
<i>Mutual love</i>

1293
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:38,314
<i>- means keeping promises
- Mutual love</i>

1294
01:26:38,398 --> 01:26:42,443
<i>- which are priceless.
- Is a fair solution.</i>

1295
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:43,486
<i>Perhaps</i>

1296
01:26:43,569 --> 01:26:52,704
<i>- only you know my heart's motion.
- Only I know your heart's motion.</i>

1297
01:26:53,371 --> 01:26:54,747
<i>- Let's face difficulties together
- Let's strive together</i>

1298
01:26:54,831 --> 01:27:03,131
<i>- and start a love revolution.
- and start a love revolution.</i>

1299
01:27:04,632 --> 01:27:08,845
<i>There was a time</i>

1300
01:27:08,928 --> 01:27:13,850
<i>when we were attracted to dreams.</i>

1301
01:27:14,058 --> 01:27:19,731
<i>When we were in the mood,
we had no worries.</i>

1302
01:27:19,814 --> 01:27:26,320
<i>Now, we can only
rely on each other.</i>

1303
01:27:26,487 --> 01:27:31,993
<i>Why don't we confide in each other
until the sky's cleared up?</i>

1304
01:27:32,368 --> 01:27:34,746
<i>- Deep as our friendship is,
- Merciless as our world is,</i>

1305
01:27:34,829 --> 01:27:41,419
<i>- we can exchange love.
- we can exchange more than sympathy.</i>

1306
01:27:41,502 --> 01:27:43,546
<i>- Let's sing love songs
- The more we sing,</i>

1307
01:27:43,629 --> 01:27:47,300
<i>- to each other.
- the more music to our ears.</i>

1308
01:27:47,383 --> 01:27:51,429
<i>- We're made for each other.
- You have my word.</i>

1309
01:27:51,512 --> 01:27:53,222
<i>We're made for each other.</i>

1310
01:27:53,306 --> 01:28:00,104
<i>- We shouldn't waste the beautiful future.
- We will win the beautiful future.</i>

1311
01:28:02,315 --> 01:28:06,652
<i>In the remaining days,</i>

1312
01:28:13,451 --> 01:28:23,711
<i>we will depend on and
believe in each other.</i>

1313
01:28:27,173 --> 01:28:28,174
Hello?

1314
01:28:29,050 --> 01:28:31,552
I'm sorry. David is not in office.

1315
01:28:33,471 --> 01:28:35,389
Securities firm?

1316
01:28:36,557 --> 01:28:37,391
Yes.

1317
01:28:43,606 --> 01:28:45,066
Hello? Jones & Sunn.

1318
01:28:45,399 --> 01:28:47,652
Sorry, David is out.

1319
01:28:50,655 --> 01:28:51,823
OK.

1320
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:02,708
Excuse me, Sophie, please come here.

1321
01:29:04,794 --> 01:29:07,046
I need the one for June, 2007.

1322
01:29:07,129 --> 01:29:10,758
It's the wrong file.

1323
01:29:16,848 --> 01:29:18,307
Morning.

1324
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,276
David is out.

1325
01:29:28,401 --> 01:29:31,612
Yes, he's out. Who are you?

1326
01:29:32,488 --> 01:29:33,614
The bank?

1327
01:29:44,667 --> 01:29:45,418
Hello?

1328
01:29:45,501 --> 01:29:46,961
Tell David Wang

1329
01:29:47,044 --> 01:29:48,671
if he can't return the money by Friday,

1330
01:29:48,754 --> 01:29:50,381
we'll ¿o look for him in the company.

1331
01:29:50,464 --> 01:29:52,258
Let him decide whether
he wants his left or right hand.

1332
01:29:52,341 --> 01:29:53,885
Who are you?

1333
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:00,266
Why the A.C. is so cold?

1334
01:30:00,349 --> 01:30:01,767
The A.C. is centralized.

1335
01:30:02,518 --> 01:30:03,895
Of course I know!

1336
01:30:03,978 --> 01:30:06,731
Can't you turn it off?

1337
01:30:06,814 --> 01:30:08,441
Idiot!

1338
01:30:10,276 --> 01:30:12,111
Have you found Mr. Greenberg?

1339
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,112
Mr. Greenberg,

1340
01:30:13,195 --> 01:30:15,364
anybody knows where Mr. Greenberg is?

1341
01:30:16,073 --> 01:30:18,034
He's been missing for several days.

1342
01:30:20,328 --> 01:30:21,329
Kar-ling!

1343
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:23,205
Kar-ling!

1344
01:30:23,331 --> 01:30:24,040
Yes!

1345
01:30:24,832 --> 01:30:25,791
Where is Mr. Greenberg?

1346
01:30:25,875 --> 01:30:27,627
I don't know.

1347
01:30:28,127 --> 01:30:30,796
Where did you hide him?
In your skirt or underwear?

1348
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:33,883
Find him before you get off work today!

1349
01:30:36,135 --> 01:30:37,595
- Lee Xiang!
- Yes.

1350
01:30:37,678 --> 01:30:39,013
- Got a cigarette?
- Yes.

1351
01:30:39,138 --> 01:30:40,097
Let's ¿o.

1352
01:30:41,182 --> 01:30:42,183
Quick.

1353
01:30:47,813 --> 01:30:50,358
You've heard what she said about me.

1354
01:30:51,150 --> 01:30:52,860
You all heard it, right?

1355
01:30:53,736 --> 01:30:56,030
I resign now.

1356
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,868
Kar-ling!

1357
01:31:00,952 --> 01:31:02,495
Kar-ling, calm down!

1358
01:31:02,578 --> 01:31:04,413
- It's hard to find a job
- What are you doing?

1359
01:31:04,497 --> 01:31:06,374
- In such bad environment!
- Give it back to me!

1360
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:07,833
- Calm down.
- Give it back.

1361
01:31:07,917 --> 01:31:09,502
I can't bear it anymore!

1362
01:31:10,419 --> 01:31:12,004
Kar-ling!

1363
01:31:12,505 --> 01:31:14,799
Your shoes.

1364
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:23,391
<i>Chang's enemies have to leave.</i>

1365
01:31:23,557 --> 01:31:27,228
<i>I'm not going to be
others' obstacles.</i>

1366
01:31:27,311 --> 01:31:30,523
<i>We want a better job but
the outside world is ghastly.</i>

1367
01:31:30,731 --> 01:31:34,318
<i>After buying all the famous brands,
I find my existence not necessary.</i>

1368
01:31:34,402 --> 01:31:37,905
<i>Why this tolerance if it only
leads to subservience?</i>

1369
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:41,409
<i>I toil here for my

<i>for my future affluence.</i>

<i>for my future success.</i>

<i>for a beautiful future

1373
01:31:48,958 --> 01:31:52,545
<i>The up-and-coming Lee Xiang wants to
replace the missing David.</i>

1374
01:31:52,628 --> 01:31:56,007
<i>It's said that David
owes an enormous debt.</i>

1375
01:31:56,090 --> 01:31:57,758
A million...just a million

1376
01:31:57,842 --> 01:31:59,760
Can I pay you back in one week?

1377
01:31:59,885 --> 01:32:03,931
<i>And brought Sophie along with him.</i>

1378
01:32:04,056 --> 01:32:07,643
<i>Listen, the loyal
chant is charming.</i>

1379
01:32:07,727 --> 01:32:11,355
<i>Listen, bonuses are

1380

<i>Look, with one heart we'll build</i>

1381

<i>We're one big family.</i>

1383
01:32:36,464 --> 01:32:40,718
Pay you half a million first.
The rest comes later.

1384
01:32:40,801 --> 01:32:42,720
I only got half a million.

1385
01:32:42,803 --> 01:32:45,181
You get nothing if I die!

1386
01:32:47,975 --> 01:32:49,894
Ms. Chang, we've received
the order from Mr. Ho

1387
01:32:49,977 --> 01:32:51,562
to call off the IPO.

1388
01:32:51,896 --> 01:32:53,022
How come?

1389
01:32:53,147 --> 01:32:54,857
You should ask the accounting firm!

1390
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:56,484
I shouldn't comment on this.

1391
01:33:00,446 --> 01:33:03,616
Why are you taking all our documents?

1392
01:33:11,123 --> 01:33:12,166
Mr. Ho, please

1393
01:33:12,249 --> 01:33:15,211
Sorry, Ms. Chang, Mr. Ho went abroad
the other day.

1394
01:33:15,503 --> 01:33:16,504
Where? When will he be back?

1395
01:33:16,587 --> 01:33:18,672
Sorry, I don't know.

1396
01:33:22,676 --> 01:33:23,928
What do you want?

1397
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:27,807
What's this?

1398
01:33:27,932 --> 01:33:29,475
My resignation letter.

1399
01:33:32,228 --> 01:33:33,687
Let me tell you,

1400
01:33:33,771 --> 01:33:35,022
I can fire anyone,

1401
01:33:35,106 --> 01:33:37,691
except for you!

1402
01:33:37,858 --> 01:33:41,445
You're not firing me. I want to resign.
I want to leave.

1403
01:33:41,529 --> 01:33:43,614
Do you remember who hired you?

1404
01:33:43,697 --> 01:33:45,699
It is Chairman Ho Chung-ping.

1405
01:33:45,908 --> 01:33:48,536
As a CEO, I can't let you ¿o.

1406
01:33:48,702 --> 01:33:51,413
If you think you can
come and ¿o as you wish,

1407
01:33:51,539 --> 01:33:52,790
maybe you're too naive!

1408
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,126
I can decide for myself.

1409
01:33:55,209 --> 01:33:58,129
I tender the resignation
only out of politeness.

1410
01:33:59,713 --> 01:34:00,589
Tell me

1411
01:34:00,673 --> 01:34:04,343
when you can decide for yourself.

1412
01:34:05,177 --> 01:34:06,220
You were arranged

1413
01:34:06,303 --> 01:34:08,222
to work here!

1414
01:34:08,722 --> 01:34:09,890
I suggest you work hard

1415
01:34:09,974 --> 01:34:11,642
rather than be angry with me.

1416
01:34:11,851 --> 01:34:14,603
Think of it as a way
to pay back to your Dad.

1417
01:34:15,896 --> 01:34:17,273
Go!

1418
01:34:18,315 --> 01:34:20,234
Everyone is looking at you.

1419
01:34:20,943 --> 01:34:23,946
Your dad doesn't want people
to know you're his daughter.

1420
01:34:24,572 --> 01:34:28,659
You can tell everyone that
I urged you to stay sincerely.

1421
01:34:30,161 --> 01:34:33,497
And may offer you a better salary.

1422
01:34:34,039 --> 01:34:37,585
So you decided to stay.

Help me transfer five million to the bank.

Two more days and we'll be free.

1430
01:35:04,195 --> 01:35:06,071
How can I have five million?

1431
01:35:06,155 --> 01:35:07,948
Our company has called off the IPO.

1432
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:11,410
Use the company's money
to solve this problem for me,

help me.

1434
01:35:12,453 --> 01:35:14,455
Otherwise we'll both be finished.

1435
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:16,707
The accountants have
taken the accounts away.

1436
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:19,043
Where are you?
You will incriminate all of us!

1437
01:35:19,126 --> 01:35:20,794
Give me 5 million!

1438
01:35:20,961 --> 01:35:23,714
No! 20 million has gone.

1439
01:35:23,797 --> 01:35:26,383
David, come back!

1440
01:35:26,467 --> 01:35:28,385
David, you must figure something out!

1441
01:35:28,469 --> 01:35:30,971
Quick, figure something out!

Nothing.

is so magnificent</i>

1476
01:38:07,878 --> 01:38:11,924
<i>that I've forgotten
I'm living like shit.</i>

1477
01:38:12,091 --> 01:38:15,636
<i>What for?</i>

1478
01:38:16,053 --> 01:38:18,847
<i>The balloon I blow up blows up</i>

1479
01:38:18,931 --> 01:38:23,310
<i>before it reaches the sky.</i>

1480
01:38:23,936 --> 01:38:24,978
<i>What for?</i>

1481
01:38:25,062 --> 01:38:30,567
<i>The tomorrow I've invested in
tortures me before I enjoy it.</i>

1482
01:38:30,651 --> 01:38:31,819
David.

1483
01:38:34,071 --> 01:38:37,908
<i>What for? Hugs and rewards?</i>

1484
01:38:37,991 --> 01:38:41,662
<i>Where's my love?</i>

1485
01:38:42,037 --> 01:38:45,833
<i>Contracts and promises?</i>

1486
01:38:45,916 --> 01:38:49,920
<i>What are the consequences?</i>

1487
01:38:50,170 --> 01:38:51,880
<i>What for?</i>

1488
01:38:51,964 --> 01:38:57,428
<i>I don't want to choose
what I'm offered.</i>

1489
01:38:57,761 --> 01:38:59,930
<i>What for?</i>

1490
01:39:00,013 --> 01:39:07,062
<i>I didn't expect I would
be dying to survive.</i>

1491
01:39:18,031 --> 01:39:20,451
Told you cleverness would be your undoing.

1492
01:39:20,534 --> 01:39:22,327
You just wouldn't listen. Look at you!

1493
01:39:22,744 --> 01:39:24,413
Help me.

1494
01:39:24,496 --> 01:39:27,249
My help harms you.

1495
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:31,420
No, I won't make the same mistake.

1496
01:39:32,171 --> 01:39:34,339
I'll listen to you in the future.

1497
01:40:52,334 --> 01:41:00,092
<i>I need your love and
you my devotion.</i>

1498
01:41:00,175 --> 01:41:07,266
<i>Mutual love is a fair solution.</i>

1499
01:41:08,225 --> 01:41:16,066
<i>Only you know my heart's motion.</i>

1500
01:41:16,149 --> 01:41:20,988
<i>Let's strive together...</i>

1501
01:41:24,408 --> 01:41:29,955
<i>...and start a love revolution.</i>

1502
01:41:34,334 --> 01:41:37,879
Police department?

1503
01:42:33,727 --> 01:42:35,604
I'd like to take this opportunity

1504
01:42:35,687 --> 01:42:37,981
to thank you for your hard work

1505
01:42:38,148 --> 01:42:40,984
and to clarify our company's
future development.

1506
01:42:41,401 --> 01:42:44,196
Due to the financial crisis
and unstable market,

1507
01:42:44,404 --> 01:42:47,991
the IPO has been temporarily called off.

1508
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:50,744
But during the process,

1509
01:42:50,994 --> 01:42:52,329
our excellent accounting team

1510
01:42:52,412 --> 01:42:55,916
has found out some incidents
that shouldn't have happened.

1511
01:42:56,708 --> 01:42:59,002
This is absolutely the fault

1512
01:42:59,419 --> 01:43:02,756
The executive in charge
should be held accountable.

1513
01:43:06,885 --> 01:43:08,845
I feel regret for our colleagues

1514
01:43:08,929 --> 01:43:11,556
who have left us

1515
01:43:12,265 --> 01:43:13,475
and those who

1516
01:43:14,768 --> 01:43:16,228
will be leaving.

1517
01:43:17,729 --> 01:43:18,772
Come!

1518
01:43:19,523 --> 01:43:21,108
Let's drink for parting.

1519
01:43:31,618 --> 01:43:33,620
We toast for the past

1520
01:43:34,204 --> 01:43:35,789
as well as for the future!

1521
01:43:35,956 --> 01:43:38,625
I have an important announcement to make.

1522
01:43:38,917 --> 01:43:41,628
The head office has struck a deal with
MADAME Chairman Mr. Cohen

1523
01:43:41,712 --> 01:43:44,798
to establish MADAME CHINA

1524
01:43:45,465 --> 01:43:48,885
and open new lines of products
besides cosmetics.

1525
01:43:49,761 --> 01:43:54,266
The first plan is to produce
heart-warming lingerie for women.

1526
01:43:54,641 --> 01:43:55,851
I want to acknowledge

1527
01:43:55,934 --> 01:43:58,270
Lee Xiang

1528
01:43:59,479 --> 01:44:01,690
for coming up with

1529
01:44:01,773 --> 01:44:05,235
such a great idea.

1530
01:44:05,652 --> 01:44:08,071
We need more young talent.

1531
01:44:08,405 --> 01:44:11,700
I have a habit that
if I encounter new recruits,

1532
01:44:11,783 --> 01:44:13,702
I always pay attention to their eyes.

1533
01:44:14,411 --> 01:44:15,871
Because in their eyes,

1534
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:20,083
I can see energy and fire!

1535
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:22,294
We need

1536
01:44:22,377 --> 01:44:24,337
younger leader

1537
01:44:24,421 --> 01:44:26,673
to succeed in fierce competition.

1538
01:44:26,965 --> 01:44:28,541
Let me introduce you to the new leader

1539
01:44:28,675 --> 01:44:31,094
of Jones & Sunn and MADAME CHINA.

1540
01:44:31,178 --> 01:44:33,847
My daughter, Kat Ho.

1541
01:44:42,397 --> 01:44:44,399
Kat, come here.

1542
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,908
I think you are all familiar with her.

1543
01:44:52,991 --> 01:44:55,744
She is your good colleague

1544
01:44:56,161 --> 01:44:58,914
and my good daughter.

1545
01:45:08,423 --> 01:45:11,551
It's not easy to get acquainted.

1546
01:45:12,093 --> 01:45:14,012
It's not easy

1547
01:45:14,095 --> 01:45:16,723
to work together, either.

1548
01:45:17,182 --> 01:45:18,683
We should cherish

1549
01:45:18,767 --> 01:45:20,477
and help each other.

1550
01:45:20,894 --> 01:45:24,731
We don't have to feel sad
if someone is leaving.

1551
01:45:25,232 --> 01:45:27,234
Don't know if I'm getting senile.

1552
01:45:27,651 --> 01:45:29,569
I've been feeling sentimental.

1553
01:45:30,695 --> 01:45:33,156
I feel that we haven't had chance

1554
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:35,909
to say goodbye properly.

1555
01:45:36,743 --> 01:45:40,622
We should seize the present moment

1556
01:45:40,789 --> 01:45:42,749
and reminisce

1557
01:45:42,833 --> 01:45:45,669
about the good old days.

1558
01:45:45,752 --> 01:45:51,132
Nothing is better than the present moment.
Carpe diem!

1559
01:45:52,759 --> 01:45:54,386
Do YOU agree?

1560
01:46:23,123 --> 01:46:24,916
Help me.

1561
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,251
I need you.

1562
01:46:26,334 --> 01:46:27,711
You lied to me.

1563
01:46:27,794 --> 01:46:29,713
I didn't mean to.

1564
01:46:30,213 --> 01:46:32,632
- You!
- You know Chang will leave

1565
01:46:33,383 --> 01:46:34,801
because you've betrayed her.

1566
01:46:34,885 --> 01:46:36,678
I didn't.

1567
01:46:39,472 --> 01:46:41,266
You didn't mean it.

1568
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:50,442
- Winnie.
- Stop it.

1569
01:46:52,652 --> 01:46:54,029
You've taught me everything.

1570
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,115
I know what I'm supposed to do.

1571
01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:04,289
Let me enjoy our last dance.

1572
01:47:43,411 --> 01:47:44,996
I didn't mean it.

1573
01:47:45,413 --> 01:47:46,915
This is not my intention.

1574
01:47:48,792 --> 01:47:50,251
I know.

1575
01:47:53,171 --> 01:47:55,131
We didn't mean it.

1576
01:47:56,341 --> 01:47:57,467
Right.

1577
01:47:58,009 --> 01:47:59,719
We didn't mean it.

1578
01:48:49,561 --> 01:48:50,979
You win.

1579
01:49:20,842 --> 01:49:23,595
Ms. Chang, I'd like to explain.

1580
01:49:37,859 --> 01:49:39,277
Goodbye, Ms. Chang.

1581
01:49:40,445 --> 01:49:41,738
Goodbye, Ms. Chang.

1582
01:49:45,366 --> 01:49:46,743
Goodbye, Ms. Chang.

1583
01:49:48,286 --> 01:49:49,871
Goodbye, Ms. Chang.

1584
01:49:50,121 --> 01:49:51,539
Goodbye, Ms. Chang.

1585
01:50:09,933 --> 01:50:11,851
You've passed your three-month probation?

1586
01:50:13,812 --> 01:50:15,105
Long time ago.

1587
01:50:42,090 --> 01:50:43,508
Farewell!

1588
01:50:45,677 --> 01:50:47,095
Young man,

1589
01:50:49,764 --> 01:50:51,307
what's your name again?

1590
01:50:51,724 --> 01:50:53,059
Lee Xiang!

1591
01:50:53,852 --> 01:50:56,855
Lee for Ang Lee. Xiang for dream.

1592
01:50:57,897 --> 01:50:59,732
Hope you'll remember it.
