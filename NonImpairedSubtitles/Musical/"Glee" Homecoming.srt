00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,954
BLAINE: <i>In a world where
everything changes,</i>

2
00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:06,490
<i>some things
always stay the same.</i>

3
00:00:06,524 --> 00:00:07,725
<i>They say
there's only three things</i>

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,159
<i>you can count on in life:</i>

5
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:13,163
<i>death, taxes and Dalton Academy.</i>

6
00:00:13,198 --> 00:00:15,132
<i>When Kurt and I broke up,
I was devastated.</i>

7
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,134
<i>I thought I was gonna spend
the rest of my life with him,</i>

8
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:19,503
<i>and then suddenly he was gone.</i>

9
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,439
<i>My therapist told me
I should concentrate</i>

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,174
<i>on the thing I love most:</i>

11
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:25,476
<i>music.</i>

12
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,911
<i>And then...
I couldn't even do that.</i>

13
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:29,880
<i>But then I started
coaching the Warblers</i>

14
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:32,216
<i>and I was totally reinvigorated.</i>

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,154
♪ Oh, yeah! ♪

16
00:00:37,188 --> 00:00:39,023
<i>I know I stepped out of the box</i>

17
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:40,491
<i>when I started dating Dave,</i>

18
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:42,026
<i>but honestly I thought.</i>

19
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,694
<i>I needed to shake things up
even more.</i>

20
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:44,828
<i>I mean, everyone's always saying</i>

21
00:00:44,863 --> 00:00:47,097
<i>change is a good thing, right?</i>

22
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:48,532
<i>So I stopped gelling my hair.</i>

23
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,568
Terrorist!

24
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,571
<i>I even stopped wearing bow ties.</i>

25
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:54,939
Hey.

26
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:56,740
It's me.
It's Blaine.

27
00:00:56,775 --> 00:00:58,542
Look, bro, okay, I don't
care what your name is.

28
00:00:58,577 --> 00:01:00,211
I'm not into that stuff.

29
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:01,545
BLAINE:
<i>It was that moment.</i>

30
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,515
<i>I realized that
I didn't need to change it up.</i>

31
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:06,350
<i>I had to get back
to where I once belonged,</i>

32
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:08,118
<i>and that's Dalton Academy,</i>

33
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:09,313
<i>where no matter what happens,</i>

34
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:11,021
<i>you can always count on the fact</i>

35
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:13,057
<i>that nothing's
ever gonna change.</i>

36
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:14,091
Excuse me.

37
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:16,527
Can I help you?

38
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:17,962
You're Mr. Anderson, right?

39
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:19,096
Um, my name's Jane.

40
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,231
I am... new to Dalton.

41
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:22,700
Uh... what do you mean?

42
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:23,868
You're a girl.

43
00:01:23,902 --> 00:01:24,802
My dad went to Dalton.

44
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:25,970
And two of my uncles.

45
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:27,271
That's nice.

46
00:01:27,305 --> 00:01:28,873
But then here I was,
stuck at one of

47
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:30,374
the lowest-performing
public schools in Ohio,

48
00:01:30,408 --> 00:01:31,775
with no arts, no music...

49
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,745
So my parents brought a Title IX
lawsuit against Dalton Academy

50
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:35,813
and won.

51
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:37,087
That's shocking.

52
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:39,884
I mean, that's-that's amazing.

53
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:41,252
Thanks, that's nice to hear.

54
00:01:41,286 --> 00:01:43,220
Anyway, I talked to
the Dean of Performing Arts,

55
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:44,922
and he said I should
talk to you.

56
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:46,190
I want to be a Warbler.

57

58
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:52,596
(school bell ringing)

59
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:54,398
Attention, McKinley idiots.

60
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,966
It's homecoming week,

61
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:58,135
which means that
a bunch of old farts

62
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,637
will be creeping
around the hallways

63
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:01,405
like<i> Game of Throne</i>
White Walkers...

64
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,573
Did you hear?

65
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:04,675
The glee club is back!

66
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,076
...horrifying me
with their beer bellies

67
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:07,945
and their liver spots.

68
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,914
And that's just
the class of 2012.

69
00:02:09,948 --> 00:02:11,849
The sign-up sheet
is right over here.

70
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:13,017
SUE:
FYI,

71
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:16,587
the much-beloved McKinley High
homecoming dance

72
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:18,956
is canceled, due to...

73
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,724
uh, let's say Sharia Law.

74
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:26,263
Lima Loser.

75
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:28,299
(gasps)

76
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:31,969
(cup clatters on floor)

77
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:33,471
(school bell ringing)

78
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:36,707
I mean, honestly, I forgot
how cold those slushees are.

79
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,442
They chill you to the bone!

80
00:02:38,477 --> 00:02:39,837
I'm so sorry that
happened, Rachel.

81
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:41,345
All right, guys,
dinner is served.

82
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:42,379
You know what, though?

83
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,614
It didn't really bother me.

84
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:45,449
It's like I felt good
being an underdog again,

85
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:47,384
like I was getting back
to my McKinley roots.

86
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:49,019
All that from getting
slusheed in the face?

87
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:50,788
Well, I guess Becky
did you a solid.

88
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:51,956
Well, I don't know.

89
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,390
Uh, wait, so you two
are co-directing, then?

90
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:54,825
Yes.
Not really.

91
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,128
Well, I guess we haven't come
around to that conversation yet.

92
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:59,296
We're just focusing on
recruiting right now, so...

93
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:00,331
Oh, uh...
(doorbell rings)

94
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:01,732
Oh.
Oh, guess that's Blaine.

95
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:04,301
(door opens) WILL:
Oh, hey, buddy.

96
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:05,369
Come on in.

97
00:03:05,403 --> 00:03:06,570
BLAINE:
Hey, everybody.

98
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:08,239
Oh, my God, you will not believe

99
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:09,473
the day that I just had.

100
00:03:09,508 --> 00:03:10,641
Sorry I'm late.

101
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:11,976
- What did I miss?
- WILL: Uh, not much,

102
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,410
but since I have you all here,

103
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:14,545
we might as well get started.

104
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:15,913
RACHEL: Mm-hmm. (Clears throat)

105
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:18,182
We have some fierce show choir
competition ahead of us

106
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:20,484
and, uh, I think we should
lay down some ground rules.

107
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,720
Yes. Uh, like no stealing
each other's set lists

108
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:23,888
and no spying.

109
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:25,156
- And no poaching.
- Mm-hmm.

110
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,524
And always be supportive
and clap for each other,

111
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:27,992
no matter what.

112
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:29,493
I actually really,
really need everyone's advice.

113
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:31,896
I have a huge dilemma.

114
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,331
A girl wants
to join the Warblers.

115
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:35,599
What's the dilemma?

116
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:37,935
You cannot be on the wrong
side of history here.

117
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,503
I mean, you of all people
should know that.

118
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:41,071
Well, I know, I just think

119
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:42,506
that tradition
is important, too,

120
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,841
- you know?
- Yeah, well,

121
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,176
some traditions
are meant to be broken.

122
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,178
You have to let her try out.

123
00:03:47,212 --> 00:03:49,213
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

124
00:03:54,486 --> 00:03:56,954
A house divided against itself
cannot stand.

125
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:59,690
This house is built
on a foundation of lies.

126
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:00,858
The Warblers

127
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:01,892
is a house of lies!

128
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:03,961
(talking over each other)

129
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,196
Order!

130
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,230
BLAINE:
Look, look.

131
00:04:06,231 --> 00:04:07,531
No decision has been made yet.

132
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:09,300
I'm just presenting the issue

133
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:11,368
for the Warbler
Council to discuss.

134
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:13,871
Should female students
be allowed to join?

135
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:16,207
(shouting)

136
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:17,541
You know, okay.

137
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:18,709
All right, what's next, huh?

138
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:20,044
Cat and dog Warblers?

139
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:21,412
I mean, the very question

140
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:22,713
is risible.

141
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:24,248
How about a student
who's a skunk?

142
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:25,983
Should it be allowed
to become a Warbler?

143
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:28,452
We can't have a girl Warbler.

144
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:30,054
Imagine the sexual tension.

145
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:31,655
We would never
get anything done.

146
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,058
But, uh, aren't
most of you guys gay?

147
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:34,992
How dare you?!

148
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,861
(Warblers exclaiming)

149
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:38,929
I have a girlfriend.

150
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:40,898
We all have girlfriends.

151
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:42,566
- Really?
- WARBLERS: Yes!

152
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,201
(clamoring)

153
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:47,405
Order. Order.

154
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,741
Warblers, as coach,
I am a non-voting member

155
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:53,744
of this body,
and once a vote is cast,

156
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:55,746
I will respect
the council's decision.

157
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:58,282
But let's be on the right side
of history here.

158
00:04:58,316 --> 00:05:02,453
Dr. King... he said that the arc
of the moral universe

159
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:04,255
bends toward justice, and...

160
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:07,258
isn't justice all about

161
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:09,260
equal rights
and equal opportunity

162
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:10,294
and inclusion?
I mean...

163
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:11,529
What about squirrels?

164
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:12,863
(laughing):
I mean,

165
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:14,865
should squirrels be allowed
to join the Warblers?

166
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,967
Th-The very premise
of your argument

167
00:05:17,002 --> 00:05:17,802
is laughable.

168
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:18,836
WARBLER:
So is yours!

169
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:21,639
(talking over each other)

170
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:24,542
- Order!
- Order.

171
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:25,576
Thank you, gentlemen,

172
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:28,679
for that... high-minded debate.

173
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:31,982
As Head Warbler, I'd like
to propose a compromise.

174
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:33,651
Why take the unprecedented step

175
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:34,952
of amending
the Warbler constitution

176
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:36,287
when we may not even need to?

177
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:40,291
We may be allowed to refuse
entry based on gender.

178
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:41,625
And we may not.

179
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,660
That's an open question.

180
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:44,195
But what is not in question

181
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:47,598
is our right to refuse entry
based on talent.

182
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,401
What I'm saying is,
shouldn't we first find out

183
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:51,475
if she can even sing?

184
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:53,671
Hmm?

185
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:54,972
All those in favor?

186
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:59,076
(singing in harmony):
♪ Aye. ♪

187
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:01,812
KURT: Well, I never agreed
to be your assistant.

188
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:03,981
I'm just saying, co-chair
seems a little more fair.

189
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:05,149
Yeah? Well, you never
would have thought

190
00:06:05,183 --> 00:06:06,650
to do your work-study program
here at McKinley

191
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:08,018
if I wasn't here
in the first place.

192
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:10,321
Okay. Well, let just hold off
on the whole labels issue

193
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:12,156
until we actually have
a glee club to lead.

194
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,510
Fine.
Where did you put.

195
00:06:13,525 --> 00:06:15,493
"We Both Reached for the Gun"
from<i> Chicago?</i>

196
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:17,695
1975 to 1980.

197
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:19,497
You organized them
chronologically?

198
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:20,364
Yes.

199
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:21,732
(sighs)

200
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:23,067
Wait a minute.

201
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:25,202
What does<i> Xanadu</i> have
to do with Ace of Base?

202
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:27,004
I'm filing them
based on emotion,

203
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:28,839
as we always should
have filed them.

204
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:30,674
All right, this pile
is Divas Strike Back

205
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,543
and that pile is
Cherish Yourself

206
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:34,345
and that pile right
there is Makeovers,

207
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:35,846
'cause we always tend to
love a good makeover.

208
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:37,248
Great. Well, we just
wasted the past two hours,

209
00:06:37,282 --> 00:06:38,783
and now we have to start over
all over again.

210
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:41,018
Okay, there is no point
in organizing sheet music

211
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:42,787
if we don't have any members.

212
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:44,381
Rachel, you've got
to get more proactive

213
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:45,923
if you expect this to work.

214
00:06:45,957 --> 00:06:48,077
All right, you can't just
post a sign-up sheet

215
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:50,060
and-and expect people
to sign up, like Mr. Shue did.

216
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:52,029
McKinley has changed.

217
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:54,365
Sue has got these kids thinking
the arts don't even exist.

218
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,134
We have got to show them
that Glee is possible.

219
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:58,702
I'll be in the auditorium.

220
00:06:58,737 --> 00:07:00,771
(footsteps receding)

221
00:07:00,806 --> 00:07:03,374
MALE VOICE: ♪ Can you hear me
now, can you hear me now? ♪

224
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:26,564
I promise I am not looking
at anyone or anything,

225
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:27,932
I just am looking...

226
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:30,301
Don't worry. Sorry, guys.

227
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:31,902
And...

228
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:33,571
♪ Oh... ♪

229
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:37,108

(continues singing indistinctly)

232
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:43,314
Oh, my God, Sam,
you hear it, too?

233
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:44,782
Yeah, is it like
a high-pitched ringing

234
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:45,856
but only in your left ear?

235
00:07:45,884 --> 00:07:47,164
Because yes, I do, all the time.

236
00:07:47,185 --> 00:07:48,285
I never wanted
Mr. Shue to know

237
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,440
because he's like God to me,

238
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:51,088
but now that you know,
I feel like I can tell you

239
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:52,189
all this stuff that I've
been holding... Shh!

240
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:53,457
I hear it now.

241
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:55,493
(students talking)

242
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:57,928
I swear I heard it.

243
00:07:57,963 --> 00:07:59,296
I know it's true.

244
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:00,798
Yeah.
No, I believe you, Rachel.

245
00:08:00,832 --> 00:08:03,701
I mean... doctors won't,
but I believe you.

246
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:05,736
(school bell ringing)

247
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:08,272
Found the God mic.

248
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:09,546
Hmm.

249
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:14,845
Okay...

250
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,881
I know things got
a little crazy earlier,

251
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:18,949
and we both said some things
about your life

252
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:20,284
that weren't very nice, so...

253
00:08:20,318 --> 00:08:21,786
Mostly me.

254
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,387
Wait, why are you smiling?

255
00:08:23,422 --> 00:08:24,955
'Cause you were right.

256
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,292
A-About me hiding in here
and not being proactive.

257
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:30,294
But when you left yesterday,
I had an epiphany

258
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:32,329
and I heard a voice.
You-you found a student?

259
00:08:32,364 --> 00:08:34,298
Not exactly, but I heard him.
At least I think it's a him.

260
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:35,900
Well, let's not label or judge.

261
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:38,169
The point is,
is that you were right.

262
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:39,537
About everything.

263
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:40,571
They're out there.

264
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:41,806
They're here, right now,

265
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,240
in McKinley,
hiding in plain sight.

266
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:45,342
They just need something huge
to draw them out,

267
00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:46,510
to show them what they could be.

268
00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:47,678
Uh-huh.

269
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:48,979
So I got on the phone.

270
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:51,215
With who?

271
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:52,817
With everyone!

272
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:54,685
MERCEDES:
Surprise!

273
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,986
(giggles)

274
00:08:56,021 --> 00:08:57,021
Yay!

275
00:08:57,956 --> 00:08:59,490
(laughs) Let's go say hi.

276
00:08:59,524 --> 00:09:01,959
(overlapping chatter)

277
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:04,028
ARTIE:
What's up?

278
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:05,763
RACHEL:
Hi, guys!

279
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:06,797
Pull up, pull up.

280
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:07,798
Artie!

281
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,733
Hi...

282
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:11,168
BRITTANY:
I missed you!

283
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:12,169
- PUCK: Hey, buddy.
- QUINN: Hey.

284
00:09:12,204 --> 00:09:14,004
Hi!
Missed your musk.

285
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,673
ARTIE:
Hi.

286
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:17,108
Oh, my God.

287
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:18,175
SAM:
Hey.

288
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,510
Now the whole gang is back

289
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:21,112
to reboot the glee club.

290
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:22,680
Damn it, you guys,
you said you'd wait for me

291
00:09:22,714 --> 00:09:24,682
- to park the rental car!
- ALL: Oh...

292
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:27,351
ALL:
Tina! Tina!

293
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:28,519
Come on!
Come over here,

294
00:09:28,553 --> 00:09:29,553
let's go.

295
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:30,855
ALL (chanting):
Tina, Tina, Tina,

296
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:33,057
- Tina, Tina, Tina...
- SAM: Come on, Tina!

297
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:36,694
...Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina...

298
00:09:36,728 --> 00:09:38,729
Yay, group hug!

299
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:40,698
Are you still a virgin?

300
00:09:40,732 --> 00:09:42,032
Sam...

301
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:43,067
Hugs, everybody!

302
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,417
(school bell ringing)

303
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,085
It's so great to have
you all together

304
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,253
in this room again.

305
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:51,349
It means so much to us
that you would come

306
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:52,279
at the drop of a hat.

307
00:09:52,314 --> 00:09:53,847
Artie, are you drawing me?

308
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:55,449
- Nope, just your boobs.
- Hmm.

309
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:57,351
I'm practicing for my
storyboarding class.

310
00:09:57,385 --> 00:09:58,452
Okay, we need to focus.

311
00:09:58,486 --> 00:09:59,520
Yeah, guys, we really got
to focus here, okay?

312
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:00,688
We-We're in crisis mode,
all right?

313
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:02,142
Glee Club has done so
much for all of us.

314
00:10:02,152 --> 00:10:03,452
You know? It brought
us together,

315
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:05,454
it-it gave us hope, it
put us out in the world.

316
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:06,555
And it brought
some of us home again.

317
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,656
She's talking about me.

318
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:08,891
Here's the situation.

319
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:10,693
We need you guys back...
Not all the time,

320
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:12,161
we realize that you have lives
in other places.

321
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,363
We've got to get Glee Club
back on its feet, you know?

322
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,899
Especially since now some
of us are the competition.

323
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,300
He's talking about
Shue and Blaine.

324
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:19,402
We need you back.

325
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:20,503
Not all the time,

326
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,138
but if you're not here,

327
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:23,906
then the tradition of the club
we love so much will be gone.

328
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,242
So we're going to find kids
that can bring something to it

329
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:27,576
the same way that we did,

330
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:28,911
and we will mentor them
based on our strengths.

331
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:30,413
KURT: But right
now we really got

332
00:10:30,447 --> 00:10:31,647
to get out there
and take on the school.

333
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:33,182
You know, really
rattle Sue's cage.

334
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,084
We are going to give McKinley

335
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:37,653
a little taste of what
they've been missing.

336

BOY:
<i>Did you hear the joke</i>

383
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,471
<i>about the fat kid
who always wears headphones?</i>

384
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,706
<i>He wears them
so he doesn't have to hear</i>

385
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:12,241
<i>your lame-ass fat jokes.</i>

386
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:15,478
<i>'Cause, believe me,
I've heard them all.</i>

387
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:17,914
<i>And this is my senior year.</i>

388
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:20,183
<i>It's supposed to be
the best year of my life,</i>

389
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:23,219
<i>but instead I'm a no-name
transfer from Chicago,</i>

390
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:25,655
<i>and not one of these
McKinley douche bags</i>

391
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:28,257
<i>has bothered to talk to me.</i>

392
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:29,826
<i>Whatever.</i>

393
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,394
<i>Who needs them?</i>

394
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:34,831
<i>I've got my boys: Tupac,
Hendrix, Jagger, Sinatra.</i>

395
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:37,400
<i>Music might be my only friend,</i>

396
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:40,169
<i>but it's the only friend
that I need.</i>

397
00:13:40,204 --> 00:13:41,938
<i>Still...</i>

398
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:44,507
<i>wouldn't kill me
to meet some people here.</i>

399
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,843
<i>Maybe make some friends?</i>

400
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:49,412
<i>Some real friends.</i>

401
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:50,880
(muffled, indistinct talking)

402
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,181
I'm sorry, what?

403
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:53,783
Are you thinking of trying out
for the glee club?

404
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:55,218
- I-I just saw the...
- Fantastic.

405
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,353
I'm Rachel Berry,
and I'm rebooting McKinley's

406
00:13:57,387 --> 00:13:59,522
award-winning New Directions!
With my best friend Kurt Hummel.

407
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:00,923
You may have heard of us.

408
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,625
We're taking a break from
our showbiz careers right now

409
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:03,860
just to give back
to the community.

410
00:14:03,894 --> 00:14:05,294
I'm so sorry.
I didn't even ask your name.

411
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:06,596
- Uh, Roderick.
- Okay, Roderick,

412
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,264
so auditions are next week,
and we're asking everyone

413
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:09,765
to prepare an up-tempo song
and a ballad.

414
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,867
Do you have any favorites?

415
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:12,034
- I...
- Fantastic.

416
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:13,536
Okay, so I would pick
something not too obscure...

417
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,704
Like "Corner of the Sky"
from<i> Pippin.</i>

418
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:15,972
Isn't that, like,
the best song ever?

419
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:17,740
And then I would pick
something not too popular.

420
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,375
Try not to stay within,
like, two minutes.

421
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:22,044
And if I were you, I would do,
like, 16 to 32 bars.

422
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,480
- Here's some sheet music for...
- Uh, listen, I... I'm sorry.

423
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:26,549
I-I-I'm really busy
after school

424
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,917
with everything, so...

425
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,819
- Okay, are you sure?
- Thank you.

426
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:31,687
It was nice meeting you.

427
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,750
Nice going, Berry.
You scared him off.

428
00:14:38,362 --> 00:14:40,062
Jane, wait up. Wait.

429
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:41,230
The Warbler Council has decided

430
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:43,099
to let you come in
and sing for them.

431
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,734
They want to see
how talented you are

432
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,102
before they decide to overturn

433
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,470
a 100-year-old
males-only policy.

434
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:49,071
Let me get this straight.

435
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:51,507
I have to go in there
and perform for the Warblers

436
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,142
just to make sure
I'm good enough

437
00:14:53,177 --> 00:14:54,677
to warrant them
taking a closer look

438
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:55,945
at their already sexist

439
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,939
and discriminatory
admission policies?

440
00:14:57,948 --> 00:14:59,415
Yeah.

441
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,818
Hey, Jane, Jane, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

442
00:15:01,852 --> 00:15:03,092
Just-just listen to me.

443
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,489
Look, the Warblers are
a very old organization.

444
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:09,003
I mean, they've been around
since the War of 1812.

445
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:12,995
When Francis Scott Key sang
"The Star-Spangled Banner"

446
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,150
to an ailing
President William Henry Harrison

447
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:18,534
on his death bed,
the Warblers sung behind him.

448
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:20,603
The point
that I'm trying to make

449
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:22,839
is that sometimes change
is scary,

450
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:24,941
even when it doesn't seem
all that significant,

451
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:26,442
and I'm telling you,

452
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:27,944
it would mean so much to me...

453
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:30,012
And-and it could mean
so much to the Warblers...

454
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,015
If you'd just...
if you could swallow your pride,

455
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,930
come in and show us
what you got.

456
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:37,153
And before you do,

457
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,689
there is someone
I want you to meet.

458
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:42,325
Jane, meet Rachel Berry,

459
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,026
the greatest performer

460
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:45,294
I have ever known.

461
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:47,029
Ms. Berry, it's so nice
to actually meet you.

462
00:15:47,064 --> 00:15:48,464
You're a legend.

463
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:50,233
Yeah, well, that's not
the general opinion these days,

464
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:51,801
but thank you...
It's an honor to help.

465
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:54,637
I think you are in the
best possible hands.

466
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:55,972
My work is done here,

467
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:58,241
and I think I should leave
you two ladies alone.

468
00:15:58,275 --> 00:15:59,742
All right.

469
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:03,813
Um... can I say something?

470
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:05,248
Why are you helping me?

471
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:06,749
Oh, well, look.

472
00:16:06,784 --> 00:16:08,684
We might be mortal
show-choir enemies,

473
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,887
but I'm a woman
before all of that,

474
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:13,489
and I figure you're fighting
this fight for all of us girls,

475
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:15,425
so... let's get started.

476
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:16,826
Okay.

477
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,960
Center stage.

478
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:20,063
(snaps fingers)

479
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:21,337
All right.

480
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:23,332
It's a packed house.

481
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:25,334
Show me your presence.

482
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:26,602
(takes deep breath)

483
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:30,339
Okay, keep your back straight.

484
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:34,911
You have to command the audience
with your body language.

485
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:36,379
Keep your head up.

486
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:38,781
And make eye contact.

487
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:41,684
Even if there's
a hundred people out there,

488
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:43,353
you have to make
a personal connection.

489
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:45,521
You have to
make each person feel

490
00:16:45,556 --> 00:16:47,557
like they have a one-on-one
connection with you.

491
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,193
And, most important,

492
00:16:50,227 --> 00:16:51,661
your song.

493
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:54,430
Well, my family has a tradition

494
00:16:54,465 --> 00:16:56,746
of singing "Up, Up and Away,"
which is bad because...

495
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,601
Let me see your phone.

496
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,241
Oh, it... well...
(chuckles)

497
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,377
Janelle Monáe's "Tightrope"
has the most plays.

498
00:17:07,411 --> 00:17:09,371
Oh, my God, that...
she's incredible.

499
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:13,983
Well, I think you found
your audition song.

500
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:18,721
Oh.

501
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:19,996
Okay.

502
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:21,658
From the top.

503
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,762
KURT:
Hey. I'm open.

504
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:31,901
I guess that's
why I was the kicker.

505
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:34,404
Which was a
transformational moment

506
00:17:34,438 --> 00:17:36,739
for the school, by the way.

507
00:17:36,774 --> 00:17:39,409
Yeah, marked the beginning
of a great synchronicity

508
00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:41,244
between Glee Club and football.

509
00:17:41,278 --> 00:17:43,079
Just ask any of the...
the football guys

510
00:17:43,113 --> 00:17:44,080
that are back for homecoming.

511
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:45,314
So, why aren't they here

512
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:46,616
trying to recruit me?

513
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,351
Why'd they send you?

514
00:17:48,385 --> 00:17:50,453
'Cause we both like guys?

515
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:55,124
Look, I know we don't have
much else in common,

516
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,959
but only a gay man

517
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,528
knows what it's like
for us out there.

518
00:17:58,562 --> 00:18:00,663
I know, when you were
in high school,

519
00:18:00,698 --> 00:18:03,299
being gay was how you
primarily identified yourself,

520
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:04,801
but that's not my thing.

521
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,337
But don't you think it's
everyone else's thing?

522
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:09,172
When I told people I was gay,

523
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:11,040
only two people
had a problem with it.

524
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:12,608
Coach Beiste
kicked them off the team.

525
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:14,811
Look, you're... you're naive
if you don't think

526
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,012
you're standing
on our shoulders.

527
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:17,380
Okay, you owe Glee Club.

528
00:18:17,414 --> 00:18:19,816
Please. I owe<i> Modern Family.</i>

529
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:23,453
Listen, when Coach Beiste
kicked those guys off the team,

530
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:24,954
they cornered me
in the parking lot

531
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:26,489
when I was getting into my car.

532
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,024
Got all up in my face.

533
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:30,326
One of them ended the day
with his jaw wired shut,

534
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:33,062
and the other... I don't think
he ever stopped running.

535
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:36,866
I can't stand Gaga,
I've never seen<i> Newsies,</i>

536
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,002
and I don't write
<i>Archie</i> fan fiction

537
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,471
where Archie and Jughead
are hot for each other.

538
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:44,307
Just because you and I
happened to be born in the same

539
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:46,542
ten percent of the population
that would choose

540
00:18:46,577 --> 00:18:48,378
Andrew Garfield over Emma Stone,

541
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:50,647
doesn't mean we have
anything else in common.

542
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:52,815
So, I'm not saying no
to your glee club

543
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,251
because it's gay or straight;

544
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:58,655
I'm saying no
because I think it sucks.

545
00:18:58,689 --> 00:19:00,923
I'm sorry, man.

546
00:19:04,461 --> 00:19:06,195
(sighs)

547
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:10,199
(cell phone buzzing)

548
00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:18,708
Ready?

549
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,945
(takes deep breath)

550
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,782
Distinguished councilmen,
fellow Warblers,

551
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,583
may I present...

552
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:29,752
Jane Heyward.

553

The Tea Party Patriot Club
has now come to order.

608
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:57,957
First order of business...
Protecting McKinley's borders.

609
00:21:57,992 --> 00:21:59,692
PUCK:
Attention!

610
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:01,861
At ease, teabaggers.

611
00:22:01,896 --> 00:22:03,196
I'm Airman First Class
Noah Puckerman.

612
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,597
But you can call me sir.

613
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:06,266
QUINN:
When we went to McKinley,

614
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,268
we were part
of conservative clubs as well,

615
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:10,436
such as the Celibacy Club
and the God Squad.

616
00:22:10,471 --> 00:22:11,938
Most of you guys are
Christians, right?

617
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:13,373
We're all Christian.

618
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:14,774
Before I joined Glee Club,

619
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:17,110
I only hung out with people
that were exactly like me.

620
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:18,444
And then Puck got her pregnant,

621
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:20,446
and she sort of changed
for the better.

622
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:22,448
The point is, nerds...

623
00:22:22,483 --> 00:22:23,950
You need to take
the three-cornered hats

624
00:22:23,984 --> 00:22:27,053
out of your loser butts
and join the New Directions!

625
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:29,155
They'll take anybody. Even you.

626
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,058
Sir, I was brought up
to respect my elders.

627
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:34,194
But don't call us losers.

628
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,030
The Tea Party Patriots is
McKinley's most popular club.

629
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,699
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

630
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,634
What is happening to America?!

631
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:43,736
I'll tell you what's happened.

632
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:46,072
We've grown up in the
biggest economic depression

633
00:22:46,106 --> 00:22:47,473
since the 1930s.

634
00:22:47,508 --> 00:22:49,742
Our mission is to fix the mess

635
00:22:49,777 --> 00:22:51,411
that Barack Hussein Obama
created

636
00:22:51,445 --> 00:22:53,813
before he and the homo-elite

637
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:56,082
turn this country
into a Muslim welfare state.

638
00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:57,116
Oh, no.

639
00:22:57,117 --> 00:22:59,352
Oh, hell to the no.

640
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:01,154
You know what?

641
00:23:01,188 --> 00:23:03,923
Don't you, you or you join
the glee club.

642
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,925
'Cause, you know, we don't need
you ignorant, backwards,

643
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,730
lily-white, gay-hating,
Obama-bashing clubbers anyway.

644
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,764
Nope.

645
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:16,302
I will be taking these.

646
00:23:17,204 --> 00:23:18,204
Yeah.

647
00:23:18,205 --> 00:23:19,506
And you know what?

648
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,876
Quinn once had sex
with a Latina lesbian.

649
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,544
Ooh.

650
00:23:24,578 --> 00:23:25,578
(grunts)

651
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:26,946
Learned that in Glee Club.

652
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:28,615
M-My bad.

653
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:29,649
(laughing)

654
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,217
(slamming gavel) Order.

655
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:32,185
Order!

656
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:33,853
Order.

657
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,889
(school bell ringing)

658
00:23:48,903 --> 00:23:51,423
The Warbler Council
voted against you.

659
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:54,974
They saw how talented you are,

660
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:58,578
but they're a brotherhood, and
they voted to keep it that way.

661
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:06,319
What am I gonna tell my dad?

662
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:09,322
You are gonna tell him
that we are not giving up on you

663
00:24:09,356 --> 00:24:11,658
because I am going straight
to the Dalton board of directors

664
00:24:11,692 --> 00:24:13,993
and telling them
that I am not interested

665
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:16,162
in coaching the Warblers
if you're not one of them.

666
00:24:16,197 --> 00:24:19,165
So you're going
to threaten to resign

667
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,369
so I can join a club
where nobody wants me?

668
00:24:24,438 --> 00:24:26,239
Yeah.

669
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:28,741
Yeah, because this is wrong.

670
00:24:28,776 --> 00:24:30,410
This is wrong.

671
00:24:30,444 --> 00:24:33,413
And sometimes, if you
want to make change,

672
00:24:33,447 --> 00:24:35,927
you-you got to make
a little noise.

673
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,784
I can fix this.

674
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:40,820
I just need a little time.

675
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,925
QUINN: Okay, just remember...
Sex sells.

676
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,594
BRITTANY: That's true,
that's how Lady Tubbington got.

677
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:49,262
Lord Tubbington caught up
in a Ponzi scheme.

You guys got some great moves.

738
00:27:02,863 --> 00:27:04,664
We could really use some
of that in the glee club.

739
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:07,167
Yeah, you could.

740
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:09,302
Oh, hi, Artie.

741
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,904
Kitty, wh-where have you been?

742
00:27:10,938 --> 00:27:12,938
I thought Sue made
all the New Directions! Transfer

743
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,574
out of McKinley.

744
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:16,309
We need you back.

745
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:17,644
You really think
I'm gonna come back

746
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:18,979
and help you
and your stupid glee club

747
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,180
after the way
you treated all of us?

748
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:21,848
The way you treated me

749
00:27:21,882 --> 00:27:23,516
when you went away to college?

750
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:25,952
Sue didn't make me transfer

751
00:27:25,987 --> 00:27:27,454
because she's smart enough
to recognize

752
00:27:27,488 --> 00:27:29,522
a star player when she sees one.

753
00:27:29,557 --> 00:27:32,258
Unlike Rachel Berry who never
even knew any of our names.

754
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:33,773
(scoffs) I know your
name, it's Quinn.

755
00:27:33,794 --> 00:27:35,195
(scoffs) I'm Quinn.

756
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:36,696
Liar.

757
00:27:36,731 --> 00:27:38,098
Listen, don't you guys
want to do more

758
00:27:38,132 --> 00:27:39,332
than just get shot
out of cannons?

759
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,600
Don't you want to be a star?

760
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:43,703
Oh, that is rich
coming from you.

BOTH:
Can two people try out together?

763
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,378
Yes. Yep. Yeah, I
don't see why not.

764
00:27:51,412 --> 00:27:52,946
The three of us
tried out together.

765
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,981
Of course
the incest twins want in.

766
00:27:55,016 --> 00:27:56,216
Let's go, ladies.

767
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,884
We have to explain
to these two again

768
00:27:57,918 --> 00:28:01,921
why<i> Flowers in the Attic</i> is
not a love story to aspire to.

769
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:10,442
(school bell ringing) If you really
want to get Blaine back,

770
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:12,052
here's what you do.

771
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:13,887
First, promise him you're
gonna burn all your clothing

772
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:15,055
and then tell him

773
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:16,489
you're gonna start dressing
like a normal person.

774
00:28:16,524 --> 00:28:18,792
Then I think you should really
start getting honest with him

775
00:28:18,826 --> 00:28:20,493
about following
your life's ambition,

776
00:28:20,528 --> 00:28:22,128
which is becoming America's
top Barbara Bush impersonator.

777
00:28:22,163 --> 00:28:23,997
That's not my life's ambition.

778
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:25,899

781
00:28:29,704 --> 00:28:30,704
Horrible.

782

It ain't working.

00:29:07,008 --> 00:29:09,009
♪ O-Oh... oh... ♪

797
00:29:16,183 --> 00:29:17,651
Oh, God.

798
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:19,152
Are you guys gonna beat me up?

799
00:29:19,186 --> 00:29:21,506
'Cause I just need a second
to get in the fetal position...

800
00:29:21,522 --> 00:29:22,722
No, no, we...

801
00:29:22,757 --> 00:29:23,957
we heard you singing.

802
00:29:23,991 --> 00:29:25,191
Yeah, you're amazing.

803
00:29:25,226 --> 00:29:27,127
Dude, you've got to audition
for the glee club.

804
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:30,297
So people can make fun of me
more than they already do?

805
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:32,499
Even the principal calls me
"White Precious."

806
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:33,667
(chuckles)

807
00:29:33,701 --> 00:29:35,168
Come here, you are precious.

808
00:29:35,202 --> 00:29:39,472
Well, all anybody cares about in
Glee Club is the way you sing.

809
00:29:39,507 --> 00:29:42,642
Look, no one has signed up
for your club yet, right?

810
00:29:42,677 --> 00:29:45,912
Okay. Well, having me
as your first member

811
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:48,582
is just gonna drive kids
away even more.

812
00:29:48,616 --> 00:29:52,085
I have designed my entire life
around people not noticing me.

813
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:54,421
Look, no one has wanted
to feel more invisible

814
00:29:54,455 --> 00:29:56,256
than I have over the past
couple of months.

815
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,924
But when I'm with these people,

816
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,926
they remind me
of the best parts of myself.

817
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:01,595
And they would never
make fun of me.

818
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:03,930
Mmm, not to her face, no way.

819
00:30:03,965 --> 00:30:06,266
You're the poster child
for Glee Club.

820
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,768
You're why Mr. Shue started
the club in the first place.

821
00:30:08,803 --> 00:30:11,771
I-It's a place
where misfits can fit in.

822
00:30:11,806 --> 00:30:13,173
Will you please try out?

823
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:15,709
I'm really sorry
that I came on so strong.

824
00:30:15,743 --> 00:30:17,877
But you can sing
whatever you want.

825
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:19,713
Yeah, I guarantee
you're gonna get in.

826
00:30:19,747 --> 00:30:21,748
QUINN:
Look at all of us.

827
00:30:21,782 --> 00:30:23,550
We're all so different,
and yet there's nothing

828
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:25,018
that we wouldn't
do for each other.

829
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:26,920
We're all just
a phone call away.

830
00:30:26,954 --> 00:30:29,756
And that is because we
took a chance on Glee Club.

831
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,270
And that's something
that you deserve as well.

832

SUE:
<i>Dear Journal,</i>

833
00:30:38,332 --> 00:30:41,368
<i>I am living a nightmare.</i>

00:30:41,402 --> 00:30:43,203
<i>Just when I thought.</i>

835
00:30:43,237 --> 00:30:46,473
<i>I had finally killed

838
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:54,214
<i>it returns...</i>

heritage of this nation</i>

840
00:30:58,352 --> 00:31:02,722

841
00:31:02,757 --> 00:31:04,724
<i>So forlorn am I</i>

842
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:06,726

843

844
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:12,499
Ah...

845
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:15,101
<i>And now I've taken

846

and bat guano,</i>

847
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,342
<i>just so I can bleed out and die.</i>

848
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:26,613
<i>There must be some way
I can get at that glee club,</i>

849
00:31:26,647 --> 00:31:30,684
<i>some naive unsuspecting pawn
I can bend to my will</i>

850
00:31:30,718 --> 00:31:34,487
<i>to dismantle that glee club
once and for all.</i>

851
00:31:36,524 --> 00:31:38,491
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

852
00:31:38,526 --> 00:31:40,160
<i>That's it.</i>

853
00:31:40,194 --> 00:31:44,197
<i>Oh, Journal, once again, you've
given me reason to go on.</i>

854
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:48,301
<i>Sue Sylvester knows who her
shiny new plaything will be.</i>

855
00:31:54,909 --> 00:31:56,610
So let me get
this straight, Sue.

856
00:31:56,644 --> 00:31:58,278
Uh, Principal Sylvester.

857
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:00,447
You want me to infiltrate
the glee club

858
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:01,481
and be terrible on purpose

859
00:32:01,515 --> 00:32:02,716
so that everybody gets
demoralized and quits.

860
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,384
It works every time.

861
00:32:04,418 --> 00:32:05,552
(chuckles)

862
00:32:05,586 --> 00:32:08,106
And I'll make it
worth your while.

863
00:32:09,323 --> 00:32:10,624
What's that?

864
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:13,059
This is a
one-of-a-kind,

865
00:32:13,094 --> 00:32:17,063
custom-molded Tom
Brady Fleshlight.

866
00:32:18,332 --> 00:32:20,000
Um, no, thank you.

867
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:24,471
Okay, well...

868
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:27,807
How about I hook up with
my friends at Pfizer

869
00:32:27,842 --> 00:32:30,810
to supply me with
enough anti-nausea pills

870
00:32:30,845 --> 00:32:32,312
so I can stomach a conversation

871
00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:36,316
with the lovably
hideous Coach Beiste

872
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,152
and force her to make you
the starting quarterback.

873
00:32:39,186 --> 00:32:43,490
I'm gonna have to be really
honest with you, Sue.

874
00:32:43,524 --> 00:32:45,492
It's, uh, Principal Sylvester.

875
00:32:45,526 --> 00:32:47,827
First of all, I'm not for sale.

876
00:32:47,862 --> 00:32:51,164
And secondly, if you want
to get rid of the glee club,

877
00:32:51,198 --> 00:32:53,358
you're gonna have to get
better items than that.

878
00:32:57,238 --> 00:33:00,646
Touché, postmodern gay.

879
00:33:03,223 --> 00:33:04,356

880
00:33:04,391 --> 00:33:07,493
(students chattering)

881
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,329
Hey, uh, can you, can you
take your headphones off?

882
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,603
It's distracting me.

883
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:13,599
Uh, actually, I kind of need...

884
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:15,000
No, it's fine.

885
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,602
It's okay.
You can keep them on.

886
00:33:16,636 --> 00:33:18,170
We get it.

887
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,405
Everyone has
their own security blanket.

888
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:20,773
We just want to hear you sing.

889

Loyal subjects,

935
00:35:48,192 --> 00:35:50,593
Homecoming Day is upon us,

936
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:52,395
and I am pleased
to welcome back one

937
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:55,398
of McKinley High's
most distinguished graduates,

938
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:57,067
who will serve as Grand Marshal

939
00:35:57,101 --> 00:36:00,136
for tonight's activities.

940
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:02,005
Becky Jackson,
I hand it over to you.

941
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:03,406
Becky.

942
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:04,574
Listen up, bitches.

943
00:36:04,608 --> 00:36:08,078
Tonight Becky Jackson's
in charge.

944
00:36:08,112 --> 00:36:09,779
Rule number one,

945
00:36:09,814 --> 00:36:11,514
I'm bringing my Taser.

946
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:16,086
I am going to drop anyone who
is not dressed in school colors.

947
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,420
Rule number two,

948
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:20,657
no making out
under the bleachers.

949
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:22,592
That's where I'm gonna make out.

950
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:24,761
Rule number three,

951
00:36:24,795 --> 00:36:27,530
every student must bring
two books to burn

952
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:29,432
at the bonfire.

953
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:31,801
Rule number four...

954
00:36:31,836 --> 00:36:33,770
Okay, that's enough. Give me the
microphone. Give me the microphone.

955
00:36:33,804 --> 00:36:36,106
BECKY: The losing team
will be sacrificed.

956
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,307
SUE:
Okay, that's enough.

957
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:38,808
Let go of the microphone.

958
00:36:38,843 --> 00:36:40,944
Honey, I'm gonna peel
your fingers off one by one.

959
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:42,212
Give me the microphone!

960
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:43,947
Give it to me! (Groans)

961
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:45,815
Oh, there she is.

962
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,851
Come on. You don't want
to be late

963
00:36:47,885 --> 00:36:49,485
for the first official
glee club meeting.

964
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:51,187
You okay?

965
00:36:51,222 --> 00:36:52,989
Yeah, I was just...

966
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:55,125
thinking about Mr. Shue.

967
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,793
About how he did it.

968
00:36:56,827 --> 00:36:59,963
About how he turned nothing
into what we became.

969
00:36:59,997 --> 00:37:03,833
As individuals and as
a team and as friends.

970
00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:05,969
Well, we can't recreate
what we had,

971
00:37:06,003 --> 00:37:08,471
but we have to be open
to finding something new

972
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:10,907
or different or better.
Yes.

973
00:37:10,941 --> 00:37:13,710
So, why don't we just have
the meeting in here?

974
00:37:13,744 --> 00:37:16,246
I mean, since I am
the only member?

975
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,315
First of all, we have
to have the first meeting

976
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:19,549
in the choir room.
It's tradition.

977
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:20,823
And second of all,

978
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:22,485
you're not the only member.

979
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,254
Someone new joined yesterday.
Wait, who?

980
00:37:24,288 --> 00:37:25,355
(door bangs)

981
00:37:25,389 --> 00:37:27,324
I cannot believe you did this!

982
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:29,326
We sat down, we made rules.

983
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,593
No poaching.

984
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:32,195
It's not poaching.

985
00:37:32,229 --> 00:37:33,430
She came to me.

986
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:35,165
I don't feel comfortable
with this.

987
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,833
Even if they let me
on the Warblers,

988
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:38,735
I'll be fighting
for every vocal breakout.

989
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:40,270
Yeah, you'll be fighting
that fight anywhere.

990
00:37:40,304 --> 00:37:42,439
Yeah, but at least here,
it'll be a fair fight.

991
00:37:42,473 --> 00:37:43,873
With the changes
Principal Sylvester

992
00:37:43,874 --> 00:37:45,709
has made to the school,
it's academically on par

993
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:47,243
with any private school
in the state.

994
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:49,512
My parents are willing
to let me transfer here

995
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:50,714
if it's what I want.

996
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:52,582
And besides, what did you
expect me to do?

997
00:37:52,617 --> 00:37:53,917
I mean, say no?

998
00:37:53,951 --> 00:37:55,352
Jane asked me
not to say anything

999
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:56,753
until the transfer papers
were through.

1000
00:37:56,787 --> 00:37:59,956
I just spent the last two days
threatening to quit my job

1001
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:01,858
in order to convince everyone
to let her in,

1002
00:38:01,892 --> 00:38:03,193
and as soon as I did,

1003
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:04,527
she tells me she's leaving
to join your team?

1004
00:38:04,562 --> 00:38:06,129
I was humiliated.

1005
00:38:06,163 --> 00:38:08,698
Blaine, you have a full team
and God knows how many

1006
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:10,600
other students at Dalton
that would kill to join.

1007
00:38:10,635 --> 00:38:13,536
Don't act all cool
and loving about this, Kurt.

1008
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:14,771
I'm sure you're very happy

1009
00:38:14,805 --> 00:38:16,473
about all of this.
I wouldn't be surprised

1010
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:17,874
if you made this all happen
after seeing you with Dave.

1011
00:38:17,908 --> 00:38:19,776
Uh, maybe I should just go.

1012
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,911
- No, it's okay. No, stay.
- No, no, stay.

1013
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:24,047
You're fine. You should stay
and see what kind of people

1014
00:38:24,081 --> 00:38:26,216
your coaches are.

1015
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,119
This whole
friendly competition thing...

1016
00:38:29,153 --> 00:38:31,855
it's over.

1017
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:36,092
(sighs)

1018
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:41,620
(school bell ringing)

1019
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:44,456
The new and improved glee club

1020
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:46,191
has officially begun.

1021
00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:47,926
Introducing our first
two members,

1022
00:38:47,961 --> 00:38:49,328
Jane and Roderick.

1023
00:38:49,362 --> 00:38:51,363
(applause)

1024
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:52,698
(in deep voice):
If you build it, they will come.

1025
00:38:52,732 --> 00:38:53,866
Well, they'd better come fast.

1026
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,334
I mean, I'm sorry,
but two people?

1027
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:57,536
SANTANA:
Shut up, Tina.

1028
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,770
There's actually four.

1029
00:38:58,805 --> 00:39:01,306
As per usual, my undeniable
sexual magnetism

1030
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:02,608
has worked yet again.

1031
00:39:02,642 --> 00:39:03,682
Ladies and gentlemen,

1032
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,444
this is Mason and Madison

1033
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:06,879
McCarthy.

1034
00:39:06,913 --> 00:39:08,046
(applause)

1035
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:10,449
Hey, gang.

1036
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:12,050
We're super pumped
there's a glee club again.

1037
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:13,485
Now, I know what
you're thinking.

1038
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,287
They can obviously log roll
and kick toss,

1039
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:17,222
but can they sing?

1040
00:39:17,257 --> 00:39:18,817
Well, not to toot our own horns...
Toot!

1041
00:39:18,825 --> 00:39:20,492
But we've won karaoke night

1042
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,194
at the Wapakoneta
Summer Cheer Camp

1043
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:24,229
every year since we were three.
It's in our blood.

1044
00:39:24,264 --> 00:39:26,198
Our parents met while touring

1045
00:39:26,232 --> 00:39:28,467
with the inspirational,
world-famous singing group,

1046
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:30,636
Up with People.

1047
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,703
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1048
00:39:31,738 --> 00:39:32,871
I think I've made a mistake.

1049
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:34,039
RACHEL: No, it's okay.
You're welcome.

1050
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:35,174
I mean, you're gonna have
to audition.

1051
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,675
We have a very rigorous process.

1052
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,644
I mean, not really. Sugar Motta
was literally tone-deaf.

1053
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:40,312
Yeah, but she was hot.

1054
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:42,314
I'm actually really happy.

1055
00:39:42,348 --> 00:39:43,348
This is the start

1056
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:45,517
of something really special.

1057
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:48,987
And I know that most of you
came home just for homecoming

1058
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:51,056
and not for me and Kurt,

1059
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,570
but we can't tell you how
grateful we are for your help.

1060
00:39:55,962 --> 00:39:57,162
- Get over here.
- Let's hug.

1061
00:39:57,197 --> 00:39:58,597
- Bring it in.
- Get in for this.

1062
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:00,766
You guys, bring it in!

1063
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,836
Start getting comfortable
with group hugs.

1064
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,771
(whistling)

1065
00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:07,806
