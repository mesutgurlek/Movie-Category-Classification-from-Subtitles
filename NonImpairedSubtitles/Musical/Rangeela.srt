1
00:02:24,827 --> 00:02:29,560
"Let's dance"

2
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:37,636
"Let's set off
a storm together"

3
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:45,447
"Dance with me and steal
some color from the world"

4
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:49,583
"Get colorful"

5
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:53,585
"Get colorful"

6
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:58,984
"Let's dance"

7
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:07,828
"Let's set off
a storm together"

8
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,873
"Dance with me and steal
some color from the world"

9
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:19,205
"Get colorful"

10
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,886
"So very colorful"

11
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:14,400
"There are so many faces...
mine ought to be recognized"

12
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:23,100
"There are so many big names...
may mine be mentioned too"

13
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,449
"Life would be great"

14
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,616
"The days would be mine,
so would the nights"

15
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:36,184
"And a joyous tune played
all the time..."

16
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,828
"Dance away"

17
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,669
"Let's kick up a
storm together"

18
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,770
"Dance with me; let's steal
some color from the world"

19
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:01,140
"Get colorful"

20
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:05,580
"Get colorful"

21
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:31,508
"Come to me, friends;
drive away my problem"

22
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:39,917
"The goodies fight among themselves;
I'm the sweeter one, they all say"

23
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:41,779
"They take me for a kid!"

24
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:48,228
"There's so much
of tension around"

25
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:52,464
"What would a man do..."

26
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:56,863
"who doesn't know how to
live it up in the world"

27
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,208
"They look for their
destiny in the parrots..."

28
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,069
"in the stars up above..."

29
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,337
"they hunt for their fortune...
but can't tell what it is"

30
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:09,378
"Should one believe
in oneself..."

31
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:13,551
"all obstacles would be
easy to overcome"

32
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,949
"And the world would
be in our hands"

33
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:22,789
"Dance away"

34
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:31,739
"Let's kick up a storm together"

35
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:38,873
"Let's steal some color
from the world"

36
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,743
"Get colorful"

37
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:46,916
"Get colorful"

38
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:25,151
What's up?

39
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:29,992
You've ruined my dream!

40
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,862
What a dream!

41
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:37,938
I was dancing and singing
and swaying away...

42
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:42,907
and the world was
swaying with me.

43
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:45,912
I'm not going to
forgive you for this!

44
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:49,948
Oh indeed. As if...
- Where's my file?

45
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:53,511
It's there on the table!

46
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:55,087
And where is the table?

47
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,486
Under that heap of files.
- Found it!

48
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,888
"Enjoy yourself, O drunkard..."

49
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:05,831
Not you too!
- Well?

50
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:11,162
Who else has been bothering my wife?
- Look at the princess's airs!

51
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:15,637
She's late for work. And she says
I've ruined her dream!

52
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:17,276
That's not right, Mili.

53
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:21,840
She ruined your dream
while you slept.

54
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:23,847
And she ruined my dreams
while I still live!

55
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,783
Have I ever complained?
- As if you'd be a big shot!

56
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,756
Listen, darling...
- Yes?

57
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:39,195
I had always dreamed, "that
I'd never be a somebody"

58
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:41,695
"What have we to be...?"

59
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:45,835
Aren't you going for your bath?
- "Why must we bathe...?"

60
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:51,905
What are you doing...?
Have you gone mad?

61
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:54,911
Stop it!

62
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:00,511
You must be happy that your daughter
even dreams of what she wants to be.

63
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,189
All right. But dreams are fulfilled
only when man rises from his slumber.

64
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:07,856
But you dream only when you
go to sleep, understand?

65
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:16,938
What is it?

66
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:20,337
What are you doing?
- I'm studying.

67
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:22,238
Are you really studying?
Or are you asleep?

68
00:09:22,878 --> 00:09:26,041
He's studying... he isn't dreaming.

69
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,943
Here I go...

70
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,688
My word, Motilal! You've taken to
your books so early in the day!

71
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,991
I don't intend to spend 3 years
in Class 10 like you.

72
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:41,352
My little brother...

73
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:46,860
I wasn't killing time in Class 10.
I was learning to dance.

74
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:49,636
Because I'm not going to be
a clerk after those studies.

75
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:52,567
I want to become an actress.

76
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:55,368
Sister...
- Well?

77
00:09:55,578 --> 00:09:57,239
Could you give me an autograph?

78
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,415
How about a kick...?
Will that do?

79
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:05,109
Mili! Aren't you leaving?
- I'll fix you, all right.

80
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,348
The camera isn't rolling.

81
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,312
Whether the camera's
rolling or not...

82
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,922
I'm a director whose mind
is always at work.

83
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,924
I'm not competing with
the directors here.

84
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,223
I'm competing with Hollywood.
So let me see the frame.

85
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,725
It's so very dark...
I can't see anything.

86
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:56,938
Dark...? It must be
because of this cap.

87
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:04,838
As I said, "Hum Aapke Hain koun"
is said to be a hit movie.

88
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:06,982
It has broken all records.

89
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,845
All that is okay. But do you
know the inside story?

90
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,278
No, I don't.

91
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:18,016
It was my script.
- Yours?!

92
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:19,624
I was supposed to produce
the film originally.

93
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:24,925
And all those sequences are
actually part of my marriage!

94
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,135
Really?
- But I said it's okay...

95
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:32,203
Suraj is my own boy.
Let him direct the film.

96
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:36,668
And everyone praises the film today.

97
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:40,106
It's Suraj who is walking
away with all the credit...

98
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:41,749
but it was my story, after all!

99
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:44,375
Gulbadan hasn't yet
reported for shooting.

100
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:48,546
It's a 9 'O clock shift.
And she isn't here at 12!

101
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:51,724
She's going to make
beggars out of my kids!

102
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:54,553
I don't think I will
ever see this film.

103
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:57,228
Don't stand there and grin.
Go and call her!

104
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,161
Here she is...
so very punctual!

105
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,829
Welcome, madam.

106
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:10,269
Get a chair for mummy!

107
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:15,309
Set it here.
- Of course, madam.

108
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,620
Do you know the story before
the song sequence?

109
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:25,620
My baby doesn't know anything.

110
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:36,372
Our heroine is in the village.
Out there, the cold breeze...

111
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:38,465
Would you like a cold drink, dear?
- Sure.

112
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:40,536
Could you send for
some fruit juice?

113
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,975
Get a glass of fruit-juice.
- Two glasses.

114
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:49,415
As I said, there's a cool breeze
blowing in the village...

115
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:54,748
I'd like a milk shake
with custard apple... okay?

116
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,316
A milk shake with custard apple.
- Make it two.

117
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:01,620
Yes. Go on.
- With lots of ice.

118
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:06,459
This isn't a season for custard apple.
- Get it from somewhere!

119
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:09,832
It's available only in November.
- So get it in November!

120
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:11,637
I've been explaining a sequence!

121
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:15,440
You're screaming!
You have scared my little girl!

122
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,850
Send for the fan...
- Get the fan!

123
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,116
Is this dress okay?

124
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:35,221
Let's shoot the song first.
I'll narrate the story later.

125
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,294
The shot is ready.

126
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,665
Tickets worth 10 going
for 30...

127
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:48,332
Want one?

128
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:53,608
Tickets worth 10
going for 30...

129
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:57,250
How much?
- 30 Rupees.

130
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:07,857
Two tickets for me.
- So cough it up.

131
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:09,827
What?
- 60 bucks.

132
00:14:09,998 --> 00:14:13,399
They're corner seats, I hope?
- Of course. At opposite ends.

133
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,929
Give me some tickets, Munna.
Mine are finished.

134
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:23,041
How are you doing?
- Great.

135
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:25,170
I come on foot and hail
a cab to go back home.

136
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:28,046
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...

137
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:34,319
Do you have any tickets?
- Want an advance booking?

138
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,114
You're kidding.
How much is it going for?

139
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:38,758
Didn't you hear that?
For 30 Rupees.

140
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:42,619
Could I have it for 15 Rupees?
- You get to watch half the film.

141
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,533
Oh damn it...
- Come back here.

142
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:50,100
I like your face.
Go and watch the film.

143
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:54,706
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...

144
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:59,742
Come here.
- What is it?

145
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:01,346
Come here!
- Me...?

146
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:04,552
You've been selling tickets
in the black-market?

147
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,454
Me? Do I look like
a black-marketer?

148
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:12,322
What was that about 30 Rupees then?
- I was looking for tickets myself.

149
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:15,595
I'd happily pay 30 bucks for a ticket.
But there's no one around.

150
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,925
Do you think I'm a fool?
Raise your hand!

151
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:21,795
Stop kidding sir...
how'd I raise my hand at you?

152
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:26,067
Raise your hands... go on!
- Hey! You're bullying me!

153
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:30,070
Look at this, folks!

154
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,876
They let those who instigate
riots, go scot-free.

155
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,408
There was a scandal involving
billions in the stock market.

156
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,177
Did they arrest anyone?
No.

157
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:42,889
But they will harass a poor guy
like me who wants to watch a film.

158
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:44,783
Go ahead...

159
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:47,561
Did you find something?
No?

160
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:49,991
You have humiliated me
publicly, haven't you?

161
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:51,823
What's going to happen
to this country...?

162
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:55,800
Get lost, fellows!
This ain't no drama!

163
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,306
What sleight of hand!

164
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:04,109
Hey black egg... get lost.
- Scram!

165
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:06,539
Where's the rest of the gang?
- They've left.

166
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:09,010
Let's make ourselves scarce...
things are heating up here.

167
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,426
What happened?

168
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:30,399
What kind of a director are you
to make her do such a dance?

169
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,577
Aren't you ashamed to give her
such difficult steps?

170
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,180
This director is a fool!

171
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,115
He watches MTv and gets us
to do weird steps...

172
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:44,178
Does anyone ask an actress
to do such difficult steps?

173
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:50,585
What if something had
happened to my girl?

174
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:53,518
Don't get excited, mummy.
I'll handle it...

175
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,557
Does it hurt?
- Don't worry...

176
00:16:56,698 --> 00:16:58,928
I'll have the steps changed.
- Like hell you will!

177
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:01,694
You should've known better than
ask her to do such steps!

178
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:05,629
You aren't hurt badly...
- Shut up! How isn't it bad?

179
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:06,739
What do you know?

180
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:09,643
You don't become a director
by merely wearing a viewfinder.

181
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:10,970
The poor baby has
sprained her ankle...

182
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:14,440
It's pack-up for the day...
Pack up!

183
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:18,776
Hear me out, mummy, please...!
- Didn't you hear me? Pack up!

184
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:20,952
Come, dear... let's go.

185
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:23,282
Please, mummy!
I'll have it changed!

186
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:29,929
I can't figure out of if we have
signed the girl or her mother!

187
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:33,160
Why do the girls' mothers
ever attend a shoot?!

188
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:36,960
I'm going to quit this place and
head straight for Hollywood!

189
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:41,398
What the hell! I'll go bust,
if you go to Hollywood!

190
00:17:41,743 --> 00:17:44,439
I don't care what happens to you!
That old hag...

191
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,979
Calm down, please. I'll somehow make
them see reason and bring them...

192
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,579
Why are you getting worked up?

193
00:17:50,552 --> 00:17:52,611
Sorry, Kamalji.
It's pack up.

194
00:17:55,691 --> 00:17:58,888
Would Julia Roberts' mother ever treat
Spielberg like I've been treated?

195
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:02,896
Kamalji's leaving.
- What else will he do?

196
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:04,892
He's such a fine actor.

197
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:08,764
But the lady always finds
some excuse to throw a fuss.

198
00:18:08,937 --> 00:18:10,837
I think she's just not
interested in her work.

199
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:13,631
Why must we bother?
We're getting paid.

200
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:15,333
How can you say such things?

201
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:20,379
We come here so we can learn
something and become good actors.

202
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,617
It isn't that we just
come here, dance and leave.

203
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,580
Sorry, lady. I have no ambitions.
I'm happy where I am.

204
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,418
Go ahead if you want
to make it big.

205
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,732
How're you doing?
- Fine.

206
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:47,231
Switch on that fan.

207
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,901
Get us some tea.
Quick.

208
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,505
Read that sign. You pay cash.

209
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,516
If I had the money, wouldn't
I go to a five-star?

210
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,288
I'll settle your account tomorrow.
- Sure?

211
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:04,319
Of course. Whom else have I paid?

212
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,059
Go on. And get me
some cookies.

213
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,692
Did you get those tickets, Munna?

214
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:18,997
What're you screaming for?
- Mili! Come here!

215
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:21,502
Why are you screaming?
- Sit down. Have a soft drink.

216
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:23,140
No. I'm going home.

217
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:26,176
Sit for a while. I'll join you.
...get a cold drink for her.

218
00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:30,640
Prakash! You're smoking again?
- I'm kicking the habit tomorrow.

219
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:34,351
So... how's the shoot going?

220
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:35,957
Don't even ask me.

221
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:40,328
The lead-lady made us work so
hard on a simple step today...

222
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:43,126
that we had it coming out
of our ears.

223
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:44,524
I've been telling you
to give it up.

224
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,160
You're going to wear out
your shoes in those shoots.

225
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:49,562
You start lecturing me now...?
- It's true.

226
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:53,831
I've seen life there on the footpaths.
- Try and think of something better.

227
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:56,309
You're wasting your time
like a worthless loafer.

228
00:19:57,212 --> 00:20:00,704
Find some job in a nice company.
- To hell with jobs!

229
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:06,314
Rather than play a rich man's dog,
I'll enjoy my life out on the streets.

230
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:09,318
I'll be my own boss...
Right, Pakya?

231
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:10,818
Right!

232
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,851
You're never going to change.
- Where are you going, Mili!

233
00:20:55,237 --> 00:21:00,402
"Listen to what I have
to say, guys..."

234
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:06,779
"Lead your life like I do"

235
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:10,879
"It's okay if I don't
own cars and bungalows"

236
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:14,086
"It's okay if I don't
have a bank balance"

237
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:17,357
"It's okay if I don't own
Tv's and videos"

238
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:20,957
"It's okay if I can't
flaunt fancy clothes"

239
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:24,296
"What must I worry
about all that?"

240
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:27,898
"I'll lead a carefree life"

241
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,708
"Listen to what I have
to say, friends"

242
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:40,108
"Lead your lives
the way I do"

243
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:43,941
"lt'd be great to own
cars and bungalows"

244
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:47,187
"With a bank balance to color
your days and nights"

245
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:50,549
"Tv's and videos would
be the icing on the cake..."

246
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:53,989
"to dress up well
would add to your status"

247
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:57,761
"value the good things in life"

248
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:01,025
"Mend your ways a bit"

249
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:06,535
"Listen to the philosophy
I follow, friends"

250
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:13,170
"And spend your lives
the way I do"

251
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:49,649
"Look at me..."

252
00:22:49,784 --> 00:22:53,982
"I'm a prince who
acts on his whims"

253
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,357
"Wait for the world
to call you a prince..."

254
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,719
"Don't call yourself
a prince"

255
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,863
"The name is Munna..."

256
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,234
"I do just what pleases me"

257
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,165
"Why should I worry
about how business is"

258
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:13,500
"Why must I ever keep track
of people coming and going"

259
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:16,711
"You're ignorant about
the ways of the world..."

260
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:20,743
"in such a world
you will never make it"

261
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:26,153
"Listen to this philosophy, friends"

262
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:32,624
"Lead your lives
as I do"

263
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:03,556
"Who knows about tomorrow"

264
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:06,725
"I live for today"

265
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:10,163
"Only those without
any confidence..."

266
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:13,161
"talk the way you do"

267
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:16,928
"Don't you ever say such a thing"

268
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,741
"They think I'm really tough"

269
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:23,006
"The heart of a lion I possess"

270
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,374
"No matter what,
I hold my head high"

271
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:29,514
"I wish you could see
beyond your nose"

272
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,654
"But you know nothing"

273
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:39,225
"Listen to me, guys"

274
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:45,056
"Lead your lives
like I do"

275
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:48,965
"It's be great own
cars and bungalows"

276
00:24:49,637 --> 00:24:52,697
"Oh to have a bank balance that
would color your days and nights"

277
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:55,744
"Tv's and videos would
be such fun"

278
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,646
"Dressing well would
add to your status"

279
00:25:00,014 --> 00:25:02,847
"Why must I worry
about all that?"

280
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:06,479
"I'd rather lead a carefree life"

281
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:11,920
"So listen to me, friends..."

282
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:18,963
"Lead your lives
the way I do"

283
00:25:22,036 --> 00:25:25,369
Kamal was fed up of the
lady's tantrums and left...

284
00:25:27,075 --> 00:25:30,533
What ice cream will you eat?
Vanilla, raspberry, pineapple...?

285
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:33,280
I don't want an ice cream.
- I'm buying it for you.

286
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,750
Have some.
- I don't want it. Let's go.

287
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,277
Strange! I'm treating you to some
Ice cream, and you don't want it!

288
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,115
So what am I to do?

289
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:45,756
I didn't like that, Mili.
- What?

290
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:47,962
I felt like buying you an ice cream.
And you refused it!

291
00:25:48,863 --> 00:25:52,264
Oh come on, Munna. You take
offense for every little thing.

292
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,625
I didn't want an ice-cream
and so I refused it.

293
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:56,337
I only asked you to have an ice cream!
- There you go again...

294
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:59,431
Did I say something wrong?
- What's right and what's wrong...?

295
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:02,039
You start a fight everywhere...
- What are you doing?

296
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:04,345
One banana. What loss is it to you?
- Pay up quietly!

297
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:06,872
What will you do if I don't?
Want a bloody punch?

298
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:09,914
One moment... how much is it?
- You're not going to pay, Mili!

299
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,578
Will you take it away for free?
- You're asking for it!

300
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:15,757
I've already paid you, so keep quiet.
...c'mon, Munna... c'mon!

301
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:20,660
You don't know me, punk!
I'm famous around here!

302
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:23,587
Mess with me and you'd never be
able to sell bananas here again!

303
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,800
What the hell was that, Munna?
- You shouldn't have paid him!

304
00:26:27,135 --> 00:26:29,160
Won't he ask you for money
when you pick up a banana?

305
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:31,166
It's not about money!
Can't I pay him?

306
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,172
But you didn't pay him.
- He acted as if I'd stolen a fortune!

307
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:37,037
It was you who started it, Munna.
- But he started the fight!

308
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:42,642
All right! You're not at fault.
Nor is he. I'm the one to blame!

309
00:26:44,118 --> 00:26:46,985
So why fight with me
if it was your mistake?

310
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:54,125
What are you doing all alone, Motilal?
- Mili won't play with me.

311
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:57,792
Not she... go ahead and bat.
I'll bowl an over.

312
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,104
Mom!
- Here I am.

313
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:10,102
Munna's going to drive me mad someday.
- Why? Did he get into a fight today?

314
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,744
It wasn't just a fight.
It was a scene!

315
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:17,141
What happened?
- We were walking together...

316
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:21,487
and there was this banana-seller.
Munna picked up a banana.

317
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:24,683
know what Munna said when the
poor man asked for his money?

318
00:27:24,926 --> 00:27:27,053
What?
- "What loss will one banana make?"

319
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:32,564
You're laughing! And I know what I've
been through out there on the streets.

320
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:36,359
Munna is mischievous, I know.
But he's good-hearted.

321
00:27:36,804 --> 00:27:39,500
Most orphans go berserk
without their parents.

322
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:43,868
But not him. He's a nice boy.
- Nice, my foot!

323
00:27:44,178 --> 00:27:45,543
Where the hell is it?

324
00:27:48,082 --> 00:27:52,018
For a boy as little as you are,
you play shots like Tendulkar.

325
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,346
know what?
- What?

326
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:56,721
Anyone can score sixers
off your bowling.

327
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:59,493
Really?! Let me see.
Score a sixer...

328
00:28:07,902 --> 00:28:10,928
You've had it, my boy!
You're going to get a thrashing!

329
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:13,306
What's happening out here?

330
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:16,435
Motilal... who
smashed the pane?

331
00:28:16,811 --> 00:28:18,972
It was Munna.
- What?

332
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,178
Who was batting?
You? Or me?

333
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:24,352
I'm sure Munna's responsible
for all this, Mom.

334
00:28:24,352 --> 00:28:26,445
Is he innocent only because
he's your brother?

335
00:28:26,721 --> 00:28:28,313
Yes, he's my brother...
so what are you going to do?

336
00:28:28,656 --> 00:28:29,452
Quiet, Mili.

337
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:32,155
Tell me the truth, Motilal.
Who broke the pane?

338
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,894
Munna did.
- You're lying!

339
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:37,731
Weren't you the one who was batting?
- But you said you'd score a sixer.

340
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:40,034
When did I say that?
- You said it, of course!

341
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:41,729
Will you bully me because
I'm a kid?

342
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:46,072
A kid, eh...?
You're acting smart with me!

343
00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:53,173
He's blaming me!
- It's all over, okay?

344
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:56,642
The story's over!
- What's over?

345
00:28:56,951 --> 00:29:00,751
Go and take a look at the kitchen.
- So?

346
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:02,747
Whoever has done it
will clean the mess.

347
00:29:03,224 --> 00:29:04,987
That's exactly what we don't know.
Who did it?

348
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:07,090
Munna has done it, I say!
- You're lying again!

349
00:29:07,695 --> 00:29:09,959
Don't you touch me!
- No? I'll give you a slap!

350
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:15,868
I know you well, fatso.
Go on and clean the mess.

351
00:29:16,204 --> 00:29:18,468
But...
- No arguments... go on.

352
00:29:19,173 --> 00:29:21,664
Very well...
I'll fix you later.

353
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:26,637
Go ahead and laugh. You're always
waiting for a chance to laugh at me.

354
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,382
My sweet will.

355
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:33,884
I can laugh at anything
and anyone I wish.

356
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:37,486
Really...?
- What's this between you now?

357
00:29:37,825 --> 00:29:40,094
I've had enough of
their fights already.

358
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:42,927
Come on inside and freshen up.
I'll give you something to eat.

359
00:29:43,297 --> 00:29:44,662
That's something!

360
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:48,026
I'm leaving... I'm going
to the movies.

361
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:52,430
Which film?
- That Raj Kamal starrer...

362
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:54,833
Mr. Bond?
- Yes.

363
00:29:58,212 --> 00:30:00,942
D'you have tickets for the film?
- Sure. I have two tickets.

364
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:02,844
Wait till I get ready...
- Not you.

365
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:07,043
I'm going with a friend.
- Won't you take me then?

366
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:09,247
Why must I take you along?

367
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,583
Please, Munna... I've been
dying to see the film.

368
00:30:12,994 --> 00:30:16,122
Will you poke fun at me again?
- No.

369
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:19,059
Will you be angry with me?
- Never.

370
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:23,498
All right. Go on and get ready.
I'll change, too.

371
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:39,486
Kamal! Congratulations!

372
00:30:39,687 --> 00:30:41,484
This film of yours
is a super hit too!

373
00:30:42,023 --> 00:30:44,651
There was this distributor
who called from C.P.C.I.

374
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,326
He said the film would
gross more than 10 million.

375
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:50,256
The distributor from Delhi
said the same thing.

376
00:30:50,698 --> 00:30:53,929
The film is bit weak
in Rajasthan, no doubt.

377
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:56,432
But it will pick up
by word of mouth.

378
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,166
In Bengal and Punjab, it's going
to break all box-office records!

379
00:31:10,184 --> 00:31:12,675
This is what I came
to tell you.

380
00:31:13,988 --> 00:31:16,218
Well then, I must leave now.

381
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:23,989
How about the heroine's call-sheet?
- I've spoken to her mom.

382
00:31:24,432 --> 00:31:26,332
She said she would
confirm tomorrow.

383
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:30,531
My God! The movie must've begun.
- How are you?

384
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:37,208
C'mon now... we're already late.
The movie must've already begun.

385
00:31:37,545 --> 00:31:39,206
It's full of songs in
the first half.

386
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,141
Watch the songs on Tv
if you miss them.

387
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:43,080
No way. I'm going to
watch the whole film.

388
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,351
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...

389
00:31:46,754 --> 00:31:49,222
Munna! There's your friend. Pakya.

390
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:51,654
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...

391
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,386
So?

392
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,819
He's selling tickets
in the black-market!

393
00:31:56,063 --> 00:31:58,998
He's had such a black life...
what else will he do?

394
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:06,399
What's that about his black life?
- You'd be shaken up...

395
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:08,006
if you get to know the
story of his life.

396
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,577
Pakya's mother died when
he was just 5 years old.

397
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:14,677
His father, the alcoholic,
kicked the bucket soon after.

398
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:19,744
Pakya had just one intention in life.
To get his only sister married.

399
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:21,918
He lived only so his
sister could be married.

400
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,858
But his bad luck. The suitor's parents
asked for so much of dowry...

401
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:32,964
that he has been selling tickets
in the black-market ever since.

402
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:36,832
Tickets for 10 Rupees
going for 30...

403
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:41,398
No one could know Pakya has
such a sordid story behind him.

404
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:45,307
The truth about a man is never
obvious from the way he looks.

405
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,873
Let's go.

406
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:55,816
Show us to our seats, buster...
has the movie started?

407
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:05,024
This cinema hall is a furnace!
Start that fan!

408
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:07,425
Will you let us
watch the film, please?

409
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:10,599
Please let us watch the film.
- Stick to your wife, old man.

410
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:14,171
Enjoying yourself, lady?
- Shut up, Munna!

411
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:15,975
You won't even let them
watch the movie in peace!

412
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:21,575
What a great shot!
- I bought it today. Readymade.

413
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:25,445
It's him I'm talking about.
Not you.

414
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:29,256
He wears a hired shirt. I've bought
mine with hard-earned money.

415
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:32,792
Right?
- Oh yes.

416
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,434
Take that foot off!

417
00:33:47,074 --> 00:33:49,406
Watch the movie... not my foot.
Look ahead.

418
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:52,407
I've bought a ticket, too.
- So you own the theater, eh?

419
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:54,874
You're showing off
to the girl, are you?

420
00:33:55,082 --> 00:33:56,879
Really? Wait till I fix you...

421
00:33:57,518 --> 00:33:59,452
Get up! What did you say?
- Don't touch me!

422
00:33:59,654 --> 00:34:02,054
I won't touch...
I'll kick you!

423
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,735
Hey Mili...

424
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,376
At least hear me out!

425
00:34:24,345 --> 00:34:26,006
Why aren't you answering me?

426
00:34:27,381 --> 00:34:30,350
I've been calling out to you...
at least answer me.

427
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:32,442
Get out of my way!

428
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,614
What have I done...?
Why are you so angry?

429
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,323
Don't talk to me, I say!

430
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:41,062
What have I done?
- What have you done?

431
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:44,498
Why did you get into a fight with him?
- Didn't you hear what he said?

432
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,328
I did. And I even saw what you did.
Who asked you to put your foot up?

433
00:34:48,736 --> 00:34:52,467
Great! You find fault only with me!
This isn't right, okay?

434
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,865
I've taken enough, Mili...

435
00:34:55,743 --> 00:34:59,076
Can't you live without
getting into fights?

436
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:02,246
Now tell me something, uncle.
Why do you go to the movies?

437
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:06,680
Why do you go to the movies?
For the fun of it, isn't it?

438
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:09,454
When I pay for my ticket,
won't I even sit comfortably?

439
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,158
Sure you will.
- Then?

440
00:35:11,158 --> 00:35:15,618
That doesn't mean you will kick
the man sitting in front of you.

441
00:35:16,163 --> 00:35:19,030
Now don't make up stories!
I haven't kicked anyone!

442
00:35:19,266 --> 00:35:21,700
What's wrong if my foot
happened to touch him?

443
00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:25,133
Nothing wrong at all.
He was having a whale of a time!

444
00:35:25,473 --> 00:35:27,031
What's happened, Munna?
- Nothing, aunt!

445
00:35:27,174 --> 00:35:30,473
She takes everything to the limit!
So what if I stretched my feet?

446
00:35:30,644 --> 00:35:32,111
Was that guy more interested
in my foot?

447
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:33,679
Everyone goes to the movies
to enjoy them.

448
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,150
That doesn't mean you can
kick people around.

449
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,345
Tell me... isn't that
rather cheap?

450
00:35:38,986 --> 00:35:40,453
Isn't it?
- Absolutely.

451
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:43,847
Talk to me! I'll answer
every accusation!

452
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:47,283
I don't want to talk to you, I said.
- See?

453
00:35:47,595 --> 00:35:50,621
You decide this, uncle.
She doesn't even listen to me.

454
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:53,632
And it was such a rotten movie.
It drove me crazy.

455
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:57,167
Listen... not a word
about the movie, okay?

456
00:35:57,371 --> 00:36:00,431
Why not? Because Raj Kamal,
your favorite, starred in it?

457
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:03,405
Will a rotten film be good
just because he acts in it?

458
00:36:03,677 --> 00:36:07,204
You're a big shot, aren't you?
- I'm the public!

459
00:36:08,315 --> 00:36:10,749
I have a right to my opinion.

460
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,943
If I don't get value for my money,
he's finished!

461
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:15,621
Even your favorite, Raj Kamal.
- Really?

462
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:16,984
Of course!

463
00:36:20,895 --> 00:36:22,795
My finger...!

464
00:36:25,232 --> 00:36:28,827
Are you hurt...?
What happened?

465
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,995
Let me see...

466
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,075
You're always bothering me!

467
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:49,546
Dad! You're laughing...?

468
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,149
See that?

469
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:23,821
It looks as if the stars
had descended to the earth.

470
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,457
With a house behind every star...

471
00:37:29,797 --> 00:37:31,662
and a story behind
every household.

472
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,200
They all look similar
from a distance.

473
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:10,801
Munna... what are
you doing here?

474
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:14,030
I've been looking for you.
And you're dancing here all alone.

475
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,310
The lead-lady threw a fuss
and walked out again.

476
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:20,773
I thought I'd rehearse
for a while.

477
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,508
But what brings you here?

478
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:26,647
I created a scene at the
theater yesterday, didn't I?

479
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:29,182
I went home and thought
about the whole thing.

480
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,819
I felt very sorry.

481
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,994
I'm a hot-tempered guy, you know.
I flare up when provoked.

482
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:39,792
So I've brought two more tickets.

483
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,301
I'll show you the film today
without anymore fuss.

484
00:38:43,037 --> 00:38:44,595
Oh, get lost.

485
00:38:49,977 --> 00:38:54,710
Is this the set where you shoot?
The place you're so excited about?

486
00:38:55,216 --> 00:38:58,151
All that blah blah...
what's go great about it?

487
00:38:58,786 --> 00:39:01,311
We have better decorations during
our festivals in the streets.

488
00:39:01,855 --> 00:39:02,753
Really?

489
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:12,757
"What are you looking for...?
Tell me"

490
00:40:13,227 --> 00:40:14,057
"Tell me..."

491
00:40:14,628 --> 00:40:17,791
"You can have anything you want"

492
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:23,899
"Such is the magic I work"

493
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:28,302
"You will have
everything you want"

494
00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:42,253
"What do you want...?
Tell me"

495
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,257
"Take it..."

496
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:48,524
"You can have my heart
if you wish"

497
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:59,533
"What else will I wish for
except your heart...?"

498
00:41:37,878 --> 00:42:07,335
"Take a look at the things
you can see from here"

499
00:42:07,574 --> 00:42:14,605
"Everything belongs to you"

500
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:21,748
"What have I to do with
all these things...?"

501
00:42:22,423 --> 00:42:29,454
"I belong to you;
you belong to me"

502
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,597
"What are you looking for...?
Tell me"

503
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:44,634
"Ask me... how I feel"

504
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:53,279
"Let me have your
heart, darling..."

505
00:42:57,024 --> 00:42:59,185
"how about it?"

506
00:43:04,298 --> 00:43:08,894
"Try and understand
what I'm saying"

507
00:44:02,155 --> 00:44:08,583
"Come and take look
at the breath-taking view"

508
00:44:09,096 --> 00:44:16,059
"Let me introduce you
to the spring"

509
00:44:16,603 --> 00:44:23,509
"Forget the views
and the spring..."

510
00:44:23,877 --> 00:44:30,783
"Come closer...
my heart beckons you"

511
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:38,351
"What do you want...?
Tell me"

512
00:44:39,026 --> 00:44:44,692
"Take anything you wish"

513
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,163
"Such is the magic I weave"

514
00:44:50,504 --> 00:44:54,099
"You will have anything
you wish"

515
00:46:00,874 --> 00:46:03,240
I've got to say something to you.
You won't tell anyone, will you?

516
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,568
Of course not. What is it?

517
00:46:05,245 --> 00:46:08,408
I haven't spoken about it to anyone.
You're the only one.

518
00:46:08,715 --> 00:46:10,376
No sweat.

519
00:46:12,419 --> 00:46:15,149
Mili...
- What has she done now?

520
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:17,580
Have you had another fight?
- Listen to me!

521
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:20,082
You start speaking even before
I've said something.

522
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:24,726
Mili...

523
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:29,233
her folks likes me a lot.

524
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,702
They love me so very much.

525
00:46:33,006 --> 00:46:35,497
Her Mom and dad...
they're like family to me.

526
00:46:37,844 --> 00:46:39,106
As for Mili...

527
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:42,744
I like her very much.

528
00:46:45,285 --> 00:46:47,344
You understand what I say?
- Sure.

529
00:46:47,654 --> 00:46:52,523
What?
- You like Mili. Her mom and dad too.

530
00:46:58,265 --> 00:47:01,132
I... I want to marry Mili.

531
00:47:01,802 --> 00:47:03,667
What? Come again, Munna!

532
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:06,605
I want to marry Mili.
- Marriage?

533
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,009
Munna's getting married!

534
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:13,108
Hey... forget it.

535
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:17,850
I'm serious.
And you're joking.

536
00:47:18,118 --> 00:47:21,884
I'm delighted! But why're you
telling me all this?

537
00:47:22,155 --> 00:47:25,386
Go and tell your bride.
I'll only be a guest!

538
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,819
That's the problem.
Mili doesn't take me seriously.

539
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:31,858
What if I propose to her
and she laughs at me?

540
00:47:32,132 --> 00:47:34,794
Why would she laugh at you?
- You don't know how she is.

541
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:38,462
Forget all that.
You want to marry her, right?

542
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:40,764
So you'll have to propose
to her sooner or later.

543
00:47:41,174 --> 00:47:43,005
You're right.

544
00:47:44,544 --> 00:47:47,945
Okay, I'll propose to her.
The moment I find an opportunity.

545
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,093
Help!

546
00:48:03,597 --> 00:48:05,588
She was scared!

547
00:48:05,732 --> 00:48:08,200
You're such a crybaby, Mili.
How're you going to manage?

548
00:48:08,502 --> 00:48:11,198
I'm going to scream even louder!
D'you know how scary it is?

549
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:15,274
This is nothing. In America
they have better games.

550
00:48:15,609 --> 00:48:17,611
America indeed!
As if you've been there!

551
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:19,943
He has a railway pass.
He travels there everyday.

552
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,349
That's enough. Why do you keep
bothering her, Munna?

553
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,082
See? And you keep blaming me, mom!
- Enough!

554
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,843
Aren't we going anywhere else?
C'mon...

555
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,614
Where's your daddy?

556
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:38,388
Did you enjoy the ride, Mili?

557
00:48:38,698 --> 00:48:41,098
Don't ask her, uncle!
- Shut up!

558
00:48:42,335 --> 00:48:45,202
Remember the ride we took on
the beach before we married?

559
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:48,466
Sure. And you had run out
of breath after the ride.

560
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,674
That was because you were with me!
- Really?

561
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,806
Stop it... not before
the children.

562
00:48:54,114 --> 00:48:58,380
Let's go... are we going to stay here?
- Yes. Let's fight in the car.

563
00:48:58,652 --> 00:49:02,611
No. Look at that ride there.
- Are we to do only what you wish?

564
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:04,723
Quiet! Are you going
to fight even here?

565
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:08,521
Go any place you want to go.
And we'll go wherever we wish.

566
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:11,158
We'll meet at lunch.
Okay?

567
00:49:25,412 --> 00:49:26,344
Talk to her!

568
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,648
Don't be silly...
there are people around.

569
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:33,384
This is the right time, I say!
Strike when the iron is hot!

570
00:49:33,587 --> 00:49:35,714
You're crazy! This is no place
to talk about love.

571
00:49:36,022 --> 00:49:37,956
This is a fair...
and we need silence.

572
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,558
Silence? So I'll go away.
Why must I spoil the fun?

573
00:49:41,995 --> 00:49:45,795
There she is... Go on!
And pour out your heart.

574
00:49:57,143 --> 00:49:58,201
Where's Pakya?

575
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:02,178
He's gone to fetch
some ice cream.

576
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,843
There's something I must tell you.

577
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,715
Actually, there's something
I've got to tell you...

578
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:14,484
Hurry up! I'm getting late!

579
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,797
As I said...
isn't this a great place?

580
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,900
Listen... there's something
I must tell you.

581
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,500
Yes?

582
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,738
As I said...
- Go on.

583
00:50:34,514 --> 00:50:35,640
Actually...

584
00:50:36,249 --> 00:50:37,682
that ride we took, you know?

585
00:50:38,418 --> 00:50:40,386
I was scared too.

586
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:45,524
Scared, weren't you?
- Terribly scared.

587
00:50:45,926 --> 00:50:48,019
Isn't that true?
I knew it!

588
00:50:48,495 --> 00:50:50,019
Liar! ...c'mon!

589
00:50:51,498 --> 00:50:53,432
No! Don't hit me!

590
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:17,366
Kamalji?

591
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:18,967
Who are you?

592
00:54:19,806 --> 00:54:23,537
Me? I'm Mili.

593
00:54:25,545 --> 00:54:30,244
I see you everyday.
At the studio.

594
00:54:30,917 --> 00:54:35,820
I'm a dancer for choreographer
Saroj khan's troupe.

595
00:55:05,585 --> 00:55:08,383
What?! Gulbadan's getting married?

596
00:55:08,855 --> 00:55:11,517
Not just getting married. She's
walking out of our film too!

597
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:15,056
Walking out? Why?
- We have a lot of love scenes.

598
00:55:15,595 --> 00:55:20,055
And Sudhir doesn't approve!
- Now who is Sudhir?

599
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:21,561
Her driver.

600
00:55:23,937 --> 00:55:26,428
What has her driver
to do with our film?

601
00:55:26,673 --> 00:55:32,111
He isn't just her driver.
He owns the car!

602
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,640
They're getting married.

603
00:55:34,047 --> 00:55:38,677
You don't mean Gulbadan
is marrying her driver?!

604
00:55:39,018 --> 00:55:42,977
Exactly. I went to meet
her Mom early this morning.

605
00:55:43,389 --> 00:55:47,951
Her mom told me that since they go
from one studio to another...

606
00:55:49,395 --> 00:55:56,426
they fell in love and
are going to get married.

607
00:56:01,174 --> 00:56:04,234
Imagine, Dada! A film heroine
and her driver. In the car.

608
00:56:04,844 --> 00:56:06,709
They romance in the car.

609
00:56:07,046 --> 00:56:08,843
And they marry in the car!

610
00:56:10,016 --> 00:56:11,711
Not even Speilberg
could dream of it!

611
00:56:12,051 --> 00:56:15,817
To hell with Speilberg!
You're obsessed with him!

612
00:56:17,056 --> 00:56:19,718
She's going to settle down
and I'm going to be ruined!

613
00:56:20,727 --> 00:56:23,662
What's going to happen to me?
And to my film?

614
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:27,797
I'll be lynched by my creditors.
- Just tell me...

615
00:56:28,034 --> 00:56:29,592
what I've got to do?

616
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:36,199
Take the call, Motilal.
- Haven't I anything else to do?

617
00:56:42,215 --> 00:56:43,842
Yes, Mili here.

618
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,453
What?!

619
00:56:50,757 --> 00:56:53,055
Yes, I'm free...

620
00:56:59,265 --> 00:57:00,960
Okay...

621
00:57:30,463 --> 00:57:32,954
Listen to this!
- Watch out...

622
00:57:35,401 --> 00:57:38,734
know what? You're not
going to believe me!

623
00:57:39,005 --> 00:57:40,199
What happened?

624
00:57:40,773 --> 00:57:43,606
You know Raj Kamal, don't you?
- Which Raj Kamal?

625
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:47,571
The film star! Raj Kamal!
- So?

626
00:57:47,947 --> 00:57:49,847
He telephoned me, Munna!

627
00:57:50,283 --> 00:57:53,218
I've just spoken to him!
- Why did he call you?

628
00:57:53,653 --> 00:57:56,315
Guess!
- Tell me.

629
00:57:56,856 --> 00:58:00,451
Try and guess!
- Tell me... I'm no astrologer.

630
00:58:00,993 --> 00:58:04,952
He wants me to play the female lead
in his next film!

631
00:58:05,331 --> 00:58:07,526
He has called me over
for a screen test tomorrow!

632
00:58:07,967 --> 00:58:10,936
What are you talking about?
- It's true! I swear!

633
00:58:11,604 --> 00:58:14,440
This is it, Munna!

634
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:19,207
I'll deliver such a performance,
speak my lines in such a way...

635
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,513
I'm going to shock all of them!

636
00:58:21,981 --> 00:58:26,384
Your eyes are the most important
thing in acting.

637
00:58:26,886 --> 00:58:30,656
Whatever lines you speak...
they must come from your heart.

638
00:58:30,656 --> 00:58:32,920
You must feel them... Okay?

639
00:59:03,556 --> 00:59:05,114
Do you...?

640
00:59:06,692 --> 00:59:07,989
Can you...?

641
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,538
Speak your lines!

642
00:59:26,512 --> 00:59:28,002
Can you...?

643
01:00:07,987 --> 01:00:10,148
Why must you cry?

644
01:00:12,024 --> 01:00:16,051
It happens to all of us.
It happened even to me.

645
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:20,321
No, it doesn't.

646
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,832
I couldn't speak two lines.

647
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,465
I have no right to be there
in front of the camera.

648
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,607
It's not your mistake.

649
01:00:29,976 --> 01:00:31,967
Let's cancel the shoot today.

650
01:00:34,113 --> 01:00:38,311
Go home and rehearse your lines.
We'll shoot again tomorrow.

651
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:42,043
You'll do it tomorrow.
Don't worry...

652
01:00:43,089 --> 01:00:44,920
Everything will be all right.

653
01:00:47,026 --> 01:00:55,456
"Come back to me, my love.
I sing for you"

654
01:00:57,036 --> 01:00:59,596
I'm not in!
- It's me, Munna!

655
01:01:01,374 --> 01:01:03,103
Hide the bottle...

656
01:01:06,112 --> 01:01:07,875
Open the door!
- One moment!

657
01:01:08,548 --> 01:01:10,140
Sit down here quickly...

658
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,908
Hold this paper...
- What is it?

659
01:01:14,186 --> 01:01:17,314
You read Rakesh's lines, okay?
- Who's Rakesh?

660
01:01:17,623 --> 01:01:21,457
The hero of the film.
Read the lines after me, okay?

661
01:01:22,161 --> 01:01:23,458
Let's get cracking.

662
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:28,590
What? Are you in love with me?

663
01:01:30,202 --> 01:01:36,471
My God! I hadn't ever dreamed
you'd talk to me like this.

664
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:39,535
I've never thought
like that about you.

665
01:01:41,414 --> 01:01:45,714
I don't even know what
to say to you...?

666
01:01:57,597 --> 01:02:01,192
Don't stare at me! Read those lines!
It's your part after mine!

667
01:02:02,101 --> 01:02:05,093
Well, sure...
- One moment.

668
01:02:06,072 --> 01:02:08,267
Now what do I say...

669
01:02:09,742 --> 01:02:18,047
"You mean you don't love me?
And I thought..."

670
01:02:18,284 --> 01:02:19,717
Give it to me.
- What now?

671
01:02:19,852 --> 01:02:24,118
Is that the way to read...
like a parrot?

672
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:27,215
Can't you read it with some feeling?
Bloody idiot!

673
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:32,064
Nonsense! You barge into the room
and ask me to read Rakesh's lines.

674
01:02:32,064 --> 01:02:35,830
Now who the hell is Rakesh?
I'm not reading anything!

675
01:02:37,403 --> 01:02:40,429
All right. Don't read it!
- Of course I won't!

676
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,769
You don't need to
do anything.

677
01:02:47,813 --> 01:02:53,012
Do you know what happened
there... at the studio?

678
01:02:54,553 --> 01:02:56,783
I talk so big out here.

679
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:06,454
And there... I couldn't speak a
single line when it mattered most.

680
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:08,034
Not a word.
I had forgotten everything!

681
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,695
I looked like a fool!

682
01:03:11,671 --> 01:03:13,969
It was only because
of Mr. Raj Kamal...

683
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:18,000
that they agreed to give me
a second chance.

684
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:23,810
They want me there at 9 tomorrow.
And it's already 11.

685
01:03:26,986 --> 01:03:30,615
I wanted to rehearse my lines
with someone.

686
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:33,217
So I came to you.

687
01:03:35,227 --> 01:03:37,695
Who will help me,
if not you?

688
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,666
Why should you cry
over such a thing?

689
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,373
How would I know it
matters so much to you?

690
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,565
All right. I'll speak
those lines with you.

691
01:03:51,043 --> 01:03:54,945
Once you have practiced with me,
you'll be an expert.

692
01:03:57,249 --> 01:04:02,084
"Are you in love with me?
O God!"

693
01:04:02,688 --> 01:04:06,784
"I've never thought of you
like that"

694
01:04:07,393 --> 01:04:12,797
Idiot! They're my lines.
- Damn! I goofed up!

695
01:04:13,399 --> 01:04:16,027
It's the other lines I speak.
Rakesh's...

696
01:04:21,073 --> 01:04:23,064
Will you show me
how to say it?

697
01:04:23,509 --> 01:04:26,273
"You know my sister
loves you, Rakesh"

698
01:04:26,545 --> 01:04:30,072
"Do you want me to tell my sister
that you love me, and not her?"

699
01:04:30,282 --> 01:04:31,647
"That you want to marry me?"

700
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,476
"Do you realize what she will
go through after hearing that?"

701
01:04:36,922 --> 01:04:38,617
"Let alone saying
such a thing to her..."

702
01:04:38,924 --> 01:04:40,983
"I can't even think
of such a thing"

703
01:04:41,594 --> 01:04:43,755
"My sister is a very
emotional person"

704
01:04:44,096 --> 01:04:48,396
"If she even gets the feeling that
you're in love with me, not her..."

705
01:04:48,768 --> 01:04:50,929
"she could even
commit suicide"

706
01:04:51,704 --> 01:05:00,510
"Don't let that happen, Rakesh.
Save my sister, please"

707
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,814
What's the time, mister?
- 5.30.

708
01:06:17,389 --> 01:06:20,187
What's the time?
- 5.30.

709
01:06:42,414 --> 01:06:45,474
What's the time?
- I told you. 5.30.

710
01:06:45,818 --> 01:06:48,582
Why are you asking me again and again?
- So what's wrong?

711
01:06:48,954 --> 01:06:50,444
I only asked you for the time.
I didn't snatch your watch.

712
01:06:50,823 --> 01:06:52,154
Go ahead and read the newspaper.

713
01:06:56,462 --> 01:06:59,761
Mili! Watch out...
what are you doing?

714
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,737
Shut your eyes!
- What happened?

715
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,633
Shut your eyes, I say!
- But what's up?

716
01:07:07,973 --> 01:07:09,372
Shut your eyes...
Go on.
