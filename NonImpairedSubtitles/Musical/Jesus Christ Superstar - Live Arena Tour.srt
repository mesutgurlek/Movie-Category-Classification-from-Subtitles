REPORTER 5: But the tough economy

# You really do believe
this talk of God is true

26

# They think they've found the new Messiah

35
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,399
# And they'll hurt you

# And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

43
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,199
# Nazareth, your famous son
should have stayed a great unknown

44
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,079
# Like his father carving wood
he'd have made good

# Jesus Christ

1131
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:14,039
# Who are you? What have you sacrificed?

1132
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:18,039
# Jesus Christ Superstar
# Superstar

1133
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:22,079
# Do you think you're what they say you are?
# Do you think you're what they say you are?

1134
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:25,879
# Jesus Christ Superstar
# Do you think you're

1135
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,999
# Do you think you're what they say you are?

1136
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:33,719
# l only wanna know
# l only wanna know

1137
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,799
# Tell me, tell me
# Won't you tell me, Jesus?

1138
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:41,719
# Don't you get me wrong
# Don't you get me wrong

1139
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:47,559
# Only wanna, only wanna, only wanna know
# Only wanna know

1140
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,479
God, forgive them.

1141
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,759
They don't know what they're doing.

1142
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:30,719
Where is my mother?

1143
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:41,919
My God.

1144
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:47,279
My God, why have you forsaken me?

1145
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:59,199
l'm thirsty, l'm thirsty.

1146
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:36,279
lt is finished.

1147
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,479
Father,

1148
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:46,919
into your hands

1149
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:48,799
l commend

1150
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,079
my spirit.

1151
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,439
-Thank you.
-Thanks again.

1152
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:55,919
Oh, my gosh.

1153
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,039
l just don't know really what to say...

1154
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,159
Thank you to everybody.

1155
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:12,999
l mean, what an extraordinary thing for me
to see this brought back,

1156
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:16,679
to where l'd hoped it would always be,
in a rock and roll arena.

1157
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,839
And with this fabulous, fabulous cast.

1158
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:25,919
One of the problems about being
in a rock venue is, um,

1159
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,039
Tim will tell you, and Mel will tell you,
is that...

1160
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,959
What happens is that about this time of night

1161
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:35,999
the set gets moved, so we could be here...

1162
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:38,999
And if l talked for hours
and l said thank you to everybody,

1163
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:42,959
bits and pieces of the scenery would start
to be removed from underneath me,

1164
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:44,519
so, um... And all of us.

1165
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:48,279
So l'm gonna keep it very, very simple
and l'd like to say

1166
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,359
thank you to our fantastic cast.

1167
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:57,759
And Laurence Connor,
who directed the show so brilliantly.

1168
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:02,919
And our wonderful live rock band.

1169
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,439
We are live, remember that.

1170
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,599
And just before they clear the set away...

1171
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:10,519
This may sound very, very strange.

1172
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:14,159
l would like to dedicate this performance
to one person

1173
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:17,119
who was with me when Superstar was written.

1174
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:19,839
Her name was Sarah, and l'd like to say,

1175
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:22,919
if you're in the audience, Sarah,
thank you for coming.

1176
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,479
Thank you, all of you.
