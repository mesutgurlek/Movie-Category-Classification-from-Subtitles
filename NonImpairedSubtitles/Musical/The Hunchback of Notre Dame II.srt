1
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,630
Hey, come back!
Wait up!

2
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,838
Oh, what a beautiful day.
Good morning.

3
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,553
There's music in the marketplace

4
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,790
The streets have come alive

5
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,871
The town is in a tizzy

6
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,428
It's a busy buzzing hive

7
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,911
There's cause for this commotion
and emotional display

8
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,389
we just can't wait to celebrate

9
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,517
Our favourite holiday

10
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,830
Le Jour D'Amour

11
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,831
Your song is in the air

12
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,956
what magic
will you make for us

13
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,110
what promise will you share

14
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,236
That golden bell
sweet La Fidele

15
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,471
will soon be ringing clear

16
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,439
The best of all the festivals
Le Jour D'Amour is here

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,717
Mesdames et messieurs,
time is short.

18
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,870
You must find your true love.

19
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,996
Find your soul's mate...

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,471
for the Festival D'Amour
is upon us.

21
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,315
Some have come in puppy love
perchance to steal a kiss

22
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,949
Some are still enamoured
after years of wedded bliss

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,157
Everyone's parading
down the promenade in pairs

24
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,835
To join the celebration
at the finest of the fairs

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,117
Le Jour D'Amour
Your song is in the air

26
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,715
what magic will you make for us
whose name shall I declare

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,078
That golden bell, sweet La Fidele
will soon be ringing clear

28
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,470
The best of all the festivals
Le Jour D'Amour is here

29
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,836
Oh, how the stars
will sparkle on the water

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,515
As the troubadours sing
tales of true romance

31
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,797
The spirits may rise

32
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,350
with fire in their eyes

33
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,319
while gypsy girls
enchant you with a dance

34
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,990
Le Jour D'Amour
Your song is in the air

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,436
what magic will you make for us
what promise will you share

36
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,595
That golden bell, sweet La Fidele
will soon be ringing clear

37
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:32,794
The best of all the festivals
Le Jour D'Amour is here

38
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,312
Ah, observe the rituals
of courtship...

39
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,789
as citizens gather two by two.

40
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,395
Oh, looks like there's
someone for everyone.

41
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,359
Ah, yes. Too bad there's
only one of me to go around, eh?

42
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,398
Ha! One is plenty.
Believe me.

43
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,199
Ah, thanks. Hey!

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,919
- Was that a shot?
- Maybe.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,275
- Take that back!
- No!

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,557
Take that-- Back.

47
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,037
Are you guys gonna fight all day
or help me get ready for the festival?

48
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,839
There he is in
his triumphant return.

49
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,956
Dashing gadabout town, eh?

50
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,033
Come on. Let's get the marble out, huh?
We have to polish La Fidele.

51
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,998
- And what's the festival--
- Without the bell?

52
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,152
Or the bell-ringer!

53
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,350
Toro! Toro!

54
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,749
- Toro! Toro!
- Charge!

55
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,470
Zephyr, you need
to slow down.

56
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,836
Okay...

57
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,753
Mom.

58
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,879
- Listen to your mother, young man.
- Yes, Papa.

59
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,269
Look at her.

60
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,038
La Fidele,
you are magnificent.

61
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,270
Are you gonna ring it
once for my mom, Quasi?

62
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,749
You bet he is, and your mother's
gonna be down in the square...

63
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,671
screaming loudly into the night...

64
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,309
"I love my husband Phoebus."

65
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,029
Oh, really? And what makes you
think that I'm gonna shout so loudly?

66
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,509
You'll have to to be heard
over me yelling...

67
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,309
"I love Esmeralda!"

68
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,189
- Yuck.
- Yeah. Yuck.

69
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,392
Whose name are you
gonna yell tomorrow, Quasi?

70
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,029
- No one, I guess.
- Then who's gonna scream your name?

71
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,192
I don't think anyone
ever will, Zephyr.

72
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,068
Well-- Well, why not?

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,831
Quasi.

74
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,434
Takes more than looking
to really see.

75
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,313
Someday you'll be ready.
And when you are, you'll find her.

76
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,234
Someday. Nah.

77
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,598
What could possibly ever change?

78
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,196
Oh, boy!
Wow! It's the circus!

79
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,314
- A giraffe!
- Look how tall he is!

80
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,313
- Look!
- Oh, look at the monkey.

81
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,471
Come, mes amis!

82
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,994
As part of the Festival D'Amour...

83
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,992
a circus has come to Paris!

84
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,635
Come one, come all...

85
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,870
to Cirque de Sarousch!

86
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,474
See juggling clowns...

87
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,836
fire-breathers and magic.

88
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,633
And now, may I present
the prettiest ornament on the midway...

89
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,830
I can't see!

90
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,514
my assistant, Mad--

91
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,556
Well, my assistant, Made--

92
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,393
- It's empty!
- There's no one there.

93
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,917
Well-- Well, of course not! You have
to come to the circus to see her.

94
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,356
Where is Madellaine?

95
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,352
And pull!

96
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,431
Mesdames and messieurs...

97
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,751
kindly direct
your attention high above...

98
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,671
as the magnificent Madellaine...

99
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,433
is about to perform
her daring high-wire act...

100
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,397
without a net.

101
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,119
Oops.
And the crowd goes wild.

102
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,909
A hush comes over the crowd
as Madellaine begins her graceful trek.

103
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,069
Madellaine catches her breath
having nearly plummeted to her death.

104
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,118
And the crowd
bursts into applause!

105
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,351
As they scream for more!
Encore!

106
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,477
Thank you.
You're too kind.

107
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,279
Where were you,
my little trinket?

108
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,354
Oh, well, I-I-I was, um--
I-I was standing.

109
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,908
Well, of-of course I was standing.
I mean, I haven't always been sitting.

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,596
That would be stupid, I guess.
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,159
I-I-I just want to contribute more
to the circus.

112
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,676
Your job is to stand there
and look pretty.

113
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,469
Hello. Oh, lovely.

114
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,678
- I wanna do more.
- And so you shall, my little clair.

115
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,992
I have the perfect job
for a girl like you.

116
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,991
Up in the tower
of Notre Dame...

117
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,356
is a bell of
extraordinary value.

118
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,353
I want you to go up there and find out
which is the bell called La Fidele.

119
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,031
- Why?
- Because I mean to steal it, silly.

120
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,557
I'll be rich. I can travel
the world in style and comfort.

121
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,236
No. Why must we always steal?
I-I was thinking--

122
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,390
Thinking?

123
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,234
Not your strong suit,
is it, my little bonbon?

124
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,151
No, it's mine.

125
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,596
- And where would you be without me?
- On the streets.

126
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,355
Precisely. For it's
a cold world out there--

127
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,955
For a girl like me.
What do I do?

128
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,156
Oh. Lovely.

129
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,478
There's a bell-ringer
that lives in the tower.

130
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,836
Smile at him.
Wile and beguile him...

131
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,230
and he'll tell you
exactly what I want to know.

132
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,030
Uh, hello.

133
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,510
- Damsel alert.
- And a lovely vision at that.

134
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,511
What am l, chopped liver?

135
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,670
I-l'm looking for the bell-ringer.

136
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,751
She wants you, big guy.

137
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,990
Is anyone here?

138
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,238
- Get out there, sweetie.
- I-I-I can't. What would I say?

139
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,595
Open your mouth.
Something will come out.

140
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,035
- I-I-I--
- Nothing came out.

141
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,714
My name is Madellaine.
I-l'm with the circus...

142
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,076
and, oh, I just love bells.

143
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,080
Which one is La Fidele?

144
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,836
The bells, you ding-dong.
She likes the bells. Talk shop.

145
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,713
Are-Are you hiding from me?

146
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,871
No. What's so funny?

147
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,475
Nothing. It's just-- It looks like
you're wearing a really big hat.

148
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,629
Oh. That-- That sounds silly,
doesn't it?

149
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,190
No. I just never looked
at it that way before.

150
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,596
Yes, it's a--
It's a brass beret.

151
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,636
A-A 2-ton topper.

152
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,116
A-A chapeau in C-sharp!

153
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,395
- The gargoyles!
- Gargoyles?

154
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,789
Well, they were--
they were alive!

155
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,797
But that's dumb, isn't it?

156
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,717
No.

157
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,836
You must think I'm stupid.

158
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,751
Not at all.

159
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,990
That just means you
have an imagination.

160
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,992
- Do you really think so?
- I do.

161
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,470
- What's your name?
- Quasimodo.

162
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,950
Well, Quasimodo...

163
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,315
wouldn't you like
to come where I can see you?

164
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,474
I h-h-have to go.

165
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,596
I'm sorry.

166
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,311
Oh, poor kid.

167
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,471
Are you okay?

168
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,836
No. You saw the way
she looked at me.

169
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,593
Well, then, get her
to look again, honey.

170
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,434
- Do you believe in miracles?
- Miracles? What kind of miracles?

171
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,080
Oh, you know,
just ordinary miracles.

172
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,912
I'm not following you, kid.

173
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,835
Well, I see people
together, couples...

174
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,596
and it looks so nice
being with someone who loves you.

175
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,558
I guess I'm just
wondering if...

176
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,279
maybe someone could love me.

177
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,829
Imagine someone to love

178
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,354
who loves you

179
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,311
Imagine

180
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,552
To look in her eyes and see

181
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,669
Imagine how miraculous
it seems to be

182
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,595
But it's not so very rare

183
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,355
You can find it anywhere

184
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,955
It's an ordinary miracle

185
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,229
The kind you find
around you every single day

186
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,151
Or maybe it's just seasonal

187
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,196
Like spring and May

188
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,875
They're so many

189
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,679
The ordinary miracle

190
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,554
A common kind of miracle
that runs right by

191
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,599
Or maybe it's too gradual
to catch your eye

192
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,910
So you miss it

193
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,396
A sudden bolt
of distant lightning

194
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,234
Cathedrals rising out of stone

195
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,359
A baby starts
to walk or talk one day

196
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,954
Then shockingly he's grown

197
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,271
And in love

198
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,636
That volcano of emotion

199
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,712
Not 10, 000 gypsy potions

200
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,314
Can undo

201
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,915
Yes, it's love

202
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,117
well, of course
my view is slanted

203
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,351
But people
do take love for granted

204
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,910
Sad but true

205
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,639
Of all the many miracles

206
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,879
Mysterious and marvellous
and big and small

207
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,953
when people fall in love
it really beats them all

208
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,158
Oh, to see it
To feel it

209
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,279
To know it

210
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,830
Imagine someone to love

211
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,150
who loves you

212
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,513
Imagine to look in her eyes

213
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,592
And see

214
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,070
Imagine how extraordinary

215
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,151
It would be

216
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,551
If an ordinary miracle

217
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,438
Happened to

218
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,992
Me

219
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,750
Go to the circus!
Make a good impression!

220
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,434
Hmm, what does one wear
to a carnival event?

221
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,353
- Nothing.
- Daring! Oh!

222
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,795
Maybe a bit pushy
for a first date.

223
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,952
Quasi, you can stay here
and hope for a miracle...

224
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,555
or you can get out there
and make a miracle of your own.

225
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,071
You're right.
I'm off to the circus!

226
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,153
- Oh, but what am I gonna wear?
- I got the perfect thing, kid.

227
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,348
Well, how do I look?

228
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,876
Uh, too much?

229
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,634
- No, no. I mean--
- Of course not.

230
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,995
- Wow! Great hat, Quasi.
- It's a new you.

231
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,310
Quasi, don't worry.
You look dashing.

232
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,279
Welcome, welcome
to the Cirque de Sarousch!

233
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,510
Magic! Magic!

234
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,830
Tricks that you
cannot ever dream of!

235
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,115
Look at the juggler!

236
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,957
Come one, come all!

237
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,034
Oh, wow!

238
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,712
- Wow!
- Zephyr, stay close.

239
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,598
I don't want to lose you.
I don't trust these people.

240
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,875
- What does that mean?
- Well, just look at them.

241
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,110
I mean, they travel from town to town
like-like-like-like--

242
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,031
- Gypsies?
- Yes! No!

243
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,951
I mean-- I mean-- Uh--

244
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,396
Uh, uh, so, Quasi, um...

245
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,550
where's this
Madellaine of yours?

246
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,679
I don't know, but I-I'm sure
she'll be out soon.

247
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,311
You don't understand.
You didn't see him.

248
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,311
I don't want to be
a part of this anymore.

249
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,517
You should have thought of that
before you stole from me.

250
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,149
- But I was only six years old.
- And you were starving...

251
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,390
and it was only a few coins.

252
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,835
Oh, you cretin, not so tight!

253
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,276
- I made a mistake.
- Yes.

254
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,079
And did I turn you over
to the authorities?

255
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,912
No.

256
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,754
- Or the workhouse?
- No.

257
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,308
And who took you in?

258
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,710
- Looked after you like a true friend?
- You did.

259
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,756
Oh, yes.

260
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,877
All you need to do
is to look pretty for him...

261
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,269
and he'll tell you
what I need to know.

262
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,190
Mirrors!

263
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,675
I could kiss me...

264
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,591
but I'd fall in love.

265
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,836
Come, trinket.
We're on.

266
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,357
Boys and girls!
Voila!

267
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,590
A treat for your senses.

268
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,797
A delight for your soul.

269
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,750
Wow! Yeah!

270
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,957
Welcome to Cirque de Sarousch!

271
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,392
- Hubba hubba!
- May I present my assistant--

272
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,391
the lovely Madellaine.

273
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,437
And now, I will astound you
with a feat of magic...

274
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,273
unparalleled in modern times.

275
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,352
Behold La Petit!

276
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,199
Do not look away
from the beast...

277
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,432
for I shall make it vanish
before your very eyes.

278
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,114
Keep a sharp watch.

279
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,318
See the creature
disappear into thin air.

280
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,714
Yeah!

281
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,358
Wow! Wow, wow, wow!

282
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,989
Sarousch is incredible!
I wish I could join the circus.

283
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,071
Hey, hey, maybe
I could join a circus.

284
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,472
Yeah! I could be a juggler. What do you
think, Quasi? I'd juggle and I'd--

285
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,315
Quasi?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Quasi?

286
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,475
- Hello?
- What are you doing?

287
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,996
Nothing. You were making
goo-goo eyes at your girlfriend.

288
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,150
Oh, she-- she's not my--

289
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,959
Who said she was my--
That's a--

290
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,678
Zephyr.

291
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,592
And where do you think
you're going? Get out there.

292
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,399
I mean to have that bell.

293
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,198
- I thought you forgot about me.
- That will never happen.

294
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,989
- I'll always be here for you.
- Always?

295
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,911
Always.

296
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,150
You mean if ever

297
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,835
I'm in any kind of
great big mess or trouble

298
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,751
I'd be right there

299
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,070
we'd be a pair

300
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,390
You mean you'll never
leave me all alone

301
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,109
we'll always be
a double, we two

302
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,079
That's the arithmetic
I'd stick with you

303
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,756
Just say we're hanging by a rope
above an evil witch's brew pot

304
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,115
It's bubbling blue

305
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,668
with sticky goo

306
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,035
Our rope gives way
and then we crash and make a splash

307
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,192
Inside her stew pot of glue

308
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,796
Even if you're sticky slick
I'd stick with you

309
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,713
- I'm sticking to you.
- Hey, no fair.

310
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,870
Can't help that.

311
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,837
We're stuck together.

312
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,948
- Best friends.
- And we always will be.

313
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,917
Always.

314
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,835
Through all the thin and thick

315
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,230
Closer than frack and frick

316
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,550
we two will do the trick

317
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,791
I'd stick with you

318
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,069
F ast as the clock can tick

319
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,596
I'd be there just as quick

320
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,558
No one I'd rather pick

321
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,351
I'd stick with you

322
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,037
Zephyr.

323
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,877
- You have a way with kids.
- Hi. M-Madellaine, hi.

324
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,872
I-I-I-I-I-I was just-- Hi.

325
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,997
He's lucky to have
a good friend like you.

326
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,071
Oh.

327
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,392
- Hey, you were really great up there.
- Ah, me?

328
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,552
Nothing to it. I just have to
stand there and look pretty, you know?

329
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,237
- No big deal.
- No, no, i-it is a big deal.

330
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,552
You-You have to make the audience
look where they're supposed to,
not give away the trick.

331
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,790
Hmm. You mean...

332
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,996
hocus their pocus?

333
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,196
Delusion their illusion?

334
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,873
Abra their cadabra?

335
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,990
Actually, I would really like
to walk the tightrope.

336
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,390
Oh. But I'm not really
very good at it.

337
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,758
Oh, I don't believe that.
I'm sure you can do anything.

338
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,354
Paris is r-really pretty.

339
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,831
I-I mean, you-- you've probably seen
it already, but then, maybe you haven't.

340
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,593
A-And if you haven't,
then-then maybe we could--

341
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,559
I could, y-you know, show you.

342
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,835
I'd really like that.

343
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,554
Oh, lovely.

344
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,916
I love you, love you,
love you, and you.

345
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,434
You're a genius.

346
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,669
Captain of the Guard,
I insist you do something.

347
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,276
They took my silver! All my coins to
pay my landlord! They'll throw us out!

348
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,271
- My bracelet is gone!
- Bracelet. Can you
describe the bracelet?

349
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,874
- My life savings is gone!
- All right, all right, have no worry.

350
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,951
The king's guard
is on the case.

351
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,996
We'll find the culprits.

352
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,475
Where we'll find them,
I don't know.

353
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,595
Wait a minute.

354
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,355
A string of robberies begins
the moment the circus comes to town?

355
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,637
Coincidence?
I don't think so.

356
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,075
How many times
have I ever been wrong?

357
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,273
Achilles, that was
a rhetorical question.

358
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,957
You know, the Festival D'Amour
is tomorrow.

359
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,271
- Would you, uh, like to go?
- Oh, I don't know.

360
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,669
Oh, but please.
We shall have a good time.

361
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,558
Well, uh, I'd love to.

362
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,108
Try my famous souffl, huh?

363
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,428
- Oh. It's ruined.
- No, no. Taste.

364
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,829
I-l think those are weeds.

365
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,797
Oh, no. Smell.

366
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,394
Oh, they smell so flowery.
They're wonderful.

367
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,313
It's rosemary.
Come on.

368
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,551
This is one of my favourite spots
in all of Paris.

369
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,510
Isn't it beautiful?

370
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,438
But I-- I can't see anything.

371
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,590
Close your eyes.

372
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,513
Listen to Paris.

373
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,594
Oh. Quasi, it's wonderful.

374
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,114
Oh, come on, show me more!

375
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,238
It's all too sudden

376
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,153
Our boy has grown

377
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,152
- There's nothing more to do
- It's true

378
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,038
He's on his own

379
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,873
we've tried to teach him

380
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,032
we've tried to show

381
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,236
The things a gargoyle

382
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,198
And a gar-guy ought to know

383
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,272
- He's gone
- He's left

384
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,635
And do we feel bereft

385
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,235
No, he's fa-la-la-la
fallen in love

386
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,834
He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love

387
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,797
Sing a rousing
rollicking roundelay

388
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,351
For our rip-roaring rhapsody

389
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,113
He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love

390
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,998
He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love

391
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,279
why should we be blue
His love is true, so bid the kid adieu

392
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,438
Oh, wow

393
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,432
Just across the square

394
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,080
Look at Quasi there

395
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,038
Love has nailed him

396
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,317
Oh, wow

397
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,119
Sighing when he talks

398
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,919
Flying when he walks

399
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,151
Love's derailed him

400
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,993
- He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love
- Oh, wow

401
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,435
- He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love
-Just across the square

402
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,988
- Sing a merry madrigal melody
- Look at Quasi there

403
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,789
- For his marvellous malady
- Love's derailed him

404
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,678
- He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love
- Oh, wow

405
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,593
- He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love
- Sighing when he talks

406
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,274
He's fa-la-la-la
la-la-la fallen

407
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,318
F a-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la
la-la-la fallen

408
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,278
F a-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la
la-la-la fallen

409
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,069
F a-la-la-la
Oh, wow

410
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,230
Quasimodo's fallen in love

411
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,435
Oh, oh, they're coming. They're coming.
Come on. Go, go, go, go, go.
Spread out. Spread out.

412
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,196
You can dry off in here.

413
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,590
Put'er there, mon frre!

414
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,917
- So, what's the plan?
- Plan? Uh--

415
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,470
- A little soft music?
- A little candlelight?

416
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,438
A cosy t^ete--t^ete by the fire?

417
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,108
- Gesundheit!
- Oh, thank you.

418
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,670
You're welcome. Hey!

419
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,432
- Shh!
- Oh.

420
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,632
Oh, it's beautiful.

421
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,713
Yes, you are.
I-I mean, yes, she is.

422
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,631
La Fidele, that is.
That's her name.

423
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,109
La Fidele--
"The F aithful One."

424
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,632
But she's even more beautiful
on the inside.

425
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,759
I-l'll show you.

426
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,197
Whoa.

427
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,760
This must be worth a fortune.

428
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,355
You should get warm.

429
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,191
Here, put this on.

430
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,718
You're very kind.

431
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,669
Do you really think there's more
to me than what you see?

432
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,355
That I have something
else to give?

433
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,158
I do.

434
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,674
I know I'm not much to look at.

435
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,792
I've never met anyone
like you, Quasimodo.

436
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,638
I mean, you understand
the world...

437
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,871
better than anyone
I've ever known.

438
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,838
Do you really think so?

439
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,956
I do.

440
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,870
I made this for you.

441
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,757
Now you can always see yourself...

442
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,718
through my eyes.

443
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,591
Well, I should--

444
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,832
I-I mean, I-I'd better--
I-It's late and, well--

445
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,278
I'm-- I'm-- I'm babbling again.

446
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,635
Stupid me.

447
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,950
No.

448
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,032
No, maybe I'm not.

449
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,951
Thank you.

450
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,751
I-I-I'll see you tomorrow?

451
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,871
Oh. It does my heart good
to see our boy like that.

452
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,954
Yes. He does seem to have
a certain savoir faire.

453
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,713
I hope it's not contagious.

454
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,233
Come see the lovely Esmeralda...

455
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,118
in her dance d'amour.

456
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,351
Careful, or you may
lose your heart.

457
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,235
- Esmeralda!
- Me! I want to play!

458
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,436
- I want to play too!
- Can I dance?

459
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,870
Esmeralda. Esmeralda!
You've gotta help me.

460
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,831
Quasi, wh-what is it?
What's wrong?

461
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,593
I think I'm sick.
I feel awful...

462
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,511
and then wonderful!

463
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,195
And then wonderfully awful
and-and-and awfully wonderful.

464
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,955
- Euphoria.
- I can't eat. I can't sleep.

465
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,715
I see, and-and-and it hurts
to breathe, but you don't care?

466
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,439
Yes! Yes! Exactly.
What do I do?

467
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,640
- Well, you have
to tell her how you feel.
- Uh, how can l?

468
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,598
- What would she say?
- Sorry.

469
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,274
I can't help you with this one.

470
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,555
- You'll have to find out yourself.
- But I--

471
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,870
Hey, you're ready.

472
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,994
That circus is responsible
for a string of robberies.

473
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,674
- What?
- I like the circus, Papa.

474
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,990
- I want to join and-and--
- Absolutely not!

475
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,196
- Those people--
- "Those people"?

476
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,998
How can you lump people
together like that?

477
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,277
But the gypsies weren't guilty
of crimes like these circus people.

478
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,669
Madellaine's not.
She's different.

479
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,193
Well, maybe...

480
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,397
and maybe she's just using you
to get something else.

481
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,677
You don't think she could
be interested in me just for me?

482
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,151
Oh, of course she cou-- Yes,
anyone could, but look at the facts.

483
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,117
Find some, and I will.

484
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,638
Achilles, do you believe this?
Everybody is mad at me.

485
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,915
How often does that happen?

486
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,831
Rhetorical!

487
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,796
What are you doing now,
my little cabbage?

488
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,957
- Practicing.
- Why strain yourself?

489
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,033
Oh, did you find out where
the monster keeps his bell, trinket?

490
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,590
He is not a monster,
and I am not your trinket.

491
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,955
I mean to have that bell.

492
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,951
I want nothing more
to do with your thefts.

493
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,112
Oh, really? And how will you
survive out there, hmm? On your looks?

494
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,033
- Quasimodo sees something you don't.
- Oh, does he?

495
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,157
Well, what if he were to have
an unfortunate accident?

496
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,708
If I have to go
up there with my men...

497
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,918
and do it the hard way,
the hunchback may get hurt.

498
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,231
No! You can't! You-- You wouldn't.

499
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,677
If you want him alive,
then lure the bell-ringer away...

500
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,354
while I steal La Fidele.

501
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,238
Lead him out of harm's way.

502
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,635
Oh, lovely.

503
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,514
- Captain!
- I'm here about a rash of robberies.

504
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,477
A rash? Oh.

505
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,951
I find a little soothing lotion
does wonders for the complexion.

506
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,794
- I'm talking about thefts in town.
- Portraits!

507
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,388
Well, we've had nothing go missing...

508
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,789
except some of my hair!

509
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,917
Are you clever enough
to retrieve that?

510
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,629
Oh, no, I suppose not.

511
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,871
My investigation leads me here.

512
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,190
Oh, it's true, Captain.
And it's my fault!

513
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,236
You're-- You're confessing?

514
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,869
Absolutely.
She's my responsibility.

515
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,669
See, she's been a thief
since she was six.

516
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,070
I thought I could break her of it
if I gave her a job...

517
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,594
a place to call home.

518
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,875
Oh, Madellaine.

519
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,110
- Oh, Madellaine.
- Madellaine?

520
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,792
- Madellaine.
- Where is she?

521
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,269
Gone. She and the hunchback...

522
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,920
are-are strolling about the town.

523
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,157
- Thank you.
- No, thank you, Captain.

524
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,915
I'll let you get back
to your self.

525
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,470
Perfect. I make
the heist of the century...

526
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,950
while the girl leads the monster
and the captain away.

527
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,954
- Madellaine! I--
I-I-I want to talk with you.
- Oh, um--

528
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,952
Let's-- Let's go for a walk.

529
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,110
- I got it!
- Whoa!

530
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,760
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa!

531
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,308
Oh, oh, oh! Mr. Sarousch!

532
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,914
Can I join your circus?

533
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,229
- Ah, the price you pay.
- Hey, wait!

534
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:35,152
I can join the circus if I want to.
Hey, where you guys going?

535
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,277
- Have you seen this woman?
- No.

536
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,158
Do you know
where I might find her?

537
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,913
- What are you doing there?
- Uh, nothing.

538
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,830
Hey, who are these clowns?

539
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,232
Madellaine says La Fidele is...

540
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,038
this one!

541
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,680
I smell something rotten in Denmark.

542
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,273
Oh, Madellaine. The fool!
Look at this ugly thing.

543
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,115
Oh. What--

544
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,750
Oh, lovely.

545
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:35,072
I'm rich, rich! I wonder if
they make diamond underwear.

546
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,230
Oh! They're stealin' La Fidele!

547
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,109
Here, hold this.

548
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,632
What part of"hold this"
was too complex?

549
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,395
- There's something I need to tell you.
- There's something I need to know.

550
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,438
Madellaine, you know,
the festival's tomorrow...

551
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,637
and-and-and I thought that--
I-l mean, we could...

552
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,598
you know, go?

553
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,229
Quasi, I'm not the person
you think I am.

554
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,596
But I want to be,
more than anything.

555
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,557
Madellaine, tell me the truth.

556
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,357
Hey!

557
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,112
What happened to La Fidele?

558
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,276
They stole it! Dad was right.

559
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,999
Come on! We gotta find out
where they're taking the bell.

560
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,390
All right. I've had enough!

561
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,193
Something's wrong.

562
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,840
- We have to hurry!
- But-- But, Quasimodo, I--

563
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,595
La Fidele! It's gone!
The bell has been stolen!

564
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,478
We must find her,
or the festival will be ruined!

565
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,870
Sarousch! How could I
have been such a fool?

566
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,237
- Sarousch?
- Seal off the city--

567
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,151
every street,
every river, every alley!

568
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,198
They won't get far
with a bell that size.

569
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,550
Did you know about this?

570
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,870
I-I wanted to tell you. I tried.

571
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,552
- You used me!
- No!

572
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,153
- "Which one is La Fidele?"
- Please!

573
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,152
"Let's-- Let's go for a walk."
You never cared about me.

574
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,800
- No! That is not true!
- You were right.

575
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,031
Quasi, I'm sorry.
Take her away.

576
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,671
No! No! Quasi, please, just--
just let me explain.

577
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,594
Look at me!
Quasimodo, just look at me!

578
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,476
Quasi! Yo, Quasi!

579
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,795
- Quasi, is that you?
- I say, old chap, bit of assistance?

580
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,519
Hey, get us out of here!

581
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,239
- We gotta hurry.
- Speed is essential.
- It wasn't my fault.

582
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,754
- One at a time.
- It's Zephyr.

583
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,910
He's gone after them.

584
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,030
What happened to the circus?

585
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,717
Halt! Okay. Come on.

586
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,351
Won't be long now
till we're home free.

587
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,318
Wha--

588
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,236
Come here! Come back!
Come back here!

589
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,270
You won't get away with this!
My dad's captain of the guard!

590
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,194
Captain of the guard, eh? Really?

591
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,836
Captain, the city is secured,
but there is no sign of Sarousch.

592
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,831
- Then we have to look further!
- Phoebus!

593
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,559
Zephyr has gone after Sarousch!

594
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,835
- I've looked everywhere.
- I've got men all over the city.

595
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,957
-We'll find him.
-You're looking in all the wrong places.

596
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,874
Sarousch has made a living
from illusion, but I can outthink him.

597
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,110
It's the same as
the disappearing elephant.

598
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,589
Th-There was always
a tunnel under the stage.

599
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,475
He's taken the bell underground.

600
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,597
The catacombs.
He could be using the catacombs.

601
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,274
And she could be saying
exactly what Sarousch wants her to.

602
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,273
We go underground, and he slips
right out of town. Can't you see?

603
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,989
Listen to me.
Your son's life is at stake.

604
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,278
Maybe you should look again
like you did with me.

605
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,959
All right!
But she's coming along as a prisoner.

606
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,709
Djali!

607
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,189
Where's Zephyr?

608
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,078
Hurry, Djali, take us to him!

609
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,875
Which will go better with my eyes--
diamonds or sapphires?

610
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,837
Sarousch!

611
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,475
Surrender now!

612
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,234
- You've got no way out!
- Oh, really?

613
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,675
I see things a bit differently.

614
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,399
Mama! Papa!

615
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,198
Let him go!

616
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,714
Let him go?
I think not, Captain.

617
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,633
He's my ticket out of here.

618
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,075
You're not going anywhere, Sarousch.

619
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,116
Now release the boy!

620
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,669
Let me pass safely,
and you may see...

621
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,751
your precious little boy again.

622
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,118
Quasimodo, he means it. He'll hurt
Zephyr, but I know how we can save him.

623
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,034
- Please untie me.
- Why, so you can escape with Sarousch?

624
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,236
Don't test me, Captain!

625
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,356
Papa!

626
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,436
Lovely.

627
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,198
Quasi, listen to me.
I know I hurt you.

628
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,716
I'm sorry, but I am
someone you can trust.

629
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,916
How can l?

630
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,070
I've already made that mistake.

631
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,152
Quasimodo, there's more to me.

632
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,233
Well done, mon capitaine.

633
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,314
Mama! Papa!

634
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,473
You hold the rope.
I'll do the rest.

635
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,511
A hush comes over the crowd
as Madellaine begins her graceful trek.

636
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,871
I can do this.
I can do this.

637
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,428
I know you can.

638
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,918
What-- What are you doing here?

639
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,110
Just standing here looking pretty.

640
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,798
Seize him!

641
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,316
No, no, no! Not the face!
Watch the face!

642
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,873
Oh, Mom, Dad.

643
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,671
- Let's go.
- Fools! I am Sarousch!

644
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,957
- This is not the ending I had in mind.
- Get in there!

645
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,038
No prison can hold me!
Wait, we can work this out.

646
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,998
Did I mention
I do birthday parties?

647
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,430
And now while Quasimodo
rings La Fidele...

648
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,590
come and proclaim your love...

649
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,717
for all of Paris to hear!

650
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,837
I love Josette!

651
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,831
I love Jean Paul!

652
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,153
I was wrong about all of it.

653
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,469
- I know.
- There's only one thing I can say.

654
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:29,680
I love Esmeralda!

655
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,435
I love Phoebus!

656
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,354
- Huh? Huh.
- Huh? Huh.
- Wait a minute.

657
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,954
- Huh? Hmm.
- What is it?

658
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,469
Quasimodo, you've shown me...

659
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,869
that the world
is full of miracles.

660
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,474
Just ordinary miracles.

661
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,551
They happen every day.

662
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,753
Yuck.

663
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,637
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

664
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,393
- Yuck.
- Yuck.

665
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,278
I'm so happy,
I could just mildew.

666
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,955
Aw, lighten up!
Take your heart for granite...

667
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,112
Iike me!

668
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,955
Aw. She'd better
take good care of our boy.

669
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,871
Don't worry. I will.

670
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,110
- Wha--
- Huh?

671
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,918
I love Madellaine!

672
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,152
And I love Quasimodo!

673
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,589
Angel in disguise

674
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,195
Stories in his eyes

675
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,953
Love for every true heart

676
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,794
That he sees

677
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,634
was it just a lucky day

678
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,076
That he turned and looked my way

679
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,038
Or is it heaven right before

680
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:14,875
My very eyes

681
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,714
He's shown me all new things

682
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,349
The shimmer of moonbeams

683
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,839
I was blind

684
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,994
But now he's helped me see

685
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:33,153
I was lost, but now I'm found

686
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,789
His happiness surrounds

687
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,553
And now I find that my dreams

688
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,713
Can come true

689
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,713
'Cause I'm gonna love you

690
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,156
For the rest of my life

691
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,357
I'm holding you safe here

692
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,319
In this heart of mine

693
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,188
I can't live without you

694
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,670
'Cause my soul would die

695
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,275
You know I'm tellin' the truth

696
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,397
I'll spend the rest of my life

697
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,359
Loving you

698
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,355
It didn't start this way

699
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,989
It happened just one day

700
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,593
You smiled at me

701
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:34,879
And I saw you differently

702
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,953
Now I would tremble just to be

703
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,635
A part of you as we

704
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,312
Begin a life

705
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,633
That's sure to never end

706
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,349
'Cause I'm gonna love you

707
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,955
For the rest of my life

708
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,157
I'm holding you safe here

709
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,392
In this heart of mine

710
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,950
I can't live without you

711
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:11,476
'Cause my soul would die

712
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:15,030
You know I'm tellin' the truth

713
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,998
I'll spend the rest of my life

714
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:22,312
Loving you

715
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,515
The rest of my life, baby

716
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,997
Loving you
