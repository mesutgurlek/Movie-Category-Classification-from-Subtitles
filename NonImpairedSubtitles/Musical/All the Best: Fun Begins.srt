Mary, without lie I can’t even
— pay your salary. Got it?

44

That’s right. But why lie for2 years.

Don’t worry. Once my band is
— set, everything will be fit. —

52
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,012
I just need some luck.

53
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,161
Oh God! This won’t stop.

54
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,225
Oh God!Janvi.

What happened, Rachel? -This
treadmill won’t stop.

Oh! -Are you ok.

61
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,028
This isn’t treadmill I but suicide machine

62
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,730
All the buttons aren’t working.

63

•i know. Ididn’t fix I it on purpose. -Why?

64
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,100
Look, you run for 3 kilometers
daily. -Yes.

65
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,606
But today you’ve done
4.7 kilometers.

66
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:20,407
Yes, but..

67
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:24,107
• The guideline of our gym is more you run the more you lose.

68
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,614
Shut up, Pinto.

00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,346
Come on. Don’t lose time, lose weight. Back to the machine.

70
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:31,648
I’ll just come.

71
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,756

I give 2 months guarantee of
• my best fitness trainer.

73
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,522
But.. -There is one tagline of our gym.

74
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,435
Life is a cycle. Get, set, go.

75
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,131
Help! Help!

76
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,044
Very good, Peter. Do it again.

77
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:05,422
Madam, I’m going by what you’re
saying, not by what I see.

78
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,321
It’s ok. You sign.

79
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,293
Madam, handle of pulley broke.

80
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,223
Take one year fee from him. -Ok.

81

Buy a seconnd hand handIe.

82
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,399
Second hand handle. How many second hand things should I buy?

83
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,502
Even in market I’m calle
second hand.

84
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,268
Even second hand girls approach
me with proposals.

85
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:27,334
Janvi, help. -Look, second hand.. Pinto, help them.

86
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,544
Prem, where are you?

87
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,184
Prem, where.. -At your feet, love.

88
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,381
Prem, your ancestor’s out-dated
gym is running me nuts.

89
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,291
Now what? -Madam, even the pulley of handle broke now.

90
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,658
Shut up, Pinto. Go
•away. -Strange.I

91
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,721
It seems I married this
— old gym, not you.

92
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,690
Not a single machine operates properly.

93
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,133
Is my work to fooI
•aII my clients?

94
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,432
Janvi, fooling has become
part of our lives.

95
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,133
Look at Chautala.-Hi.-Hi.

96
00:09:56,195 --> 00:10:00,268
From January to December he’s fooled every month.

97
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,413
You got the notch. It was the onlything Ieftto fit. ___

98
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,674
Wow! The car is ready.

99
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,044
Looking awesome, Prem.

100
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,485
Nice.-One minute.

101
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,149
You bought this cylinder with your pocket money.

102
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,252
I knew it. Why do you aIways spend money.. -Janvi.

103
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,257
Prem too has rights on
— his pocket money.

104
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,730
Right, Prem? -Yes.

105
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,493
•It was my idea to say to his brother that they were married.

106
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,005
Prem, you always.. -Hi, guys.

107
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,366
Hi. -Hi, what’s up?

108
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,372
Hi, guys. -Cool. -Veer.

109
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,406
You got it. Got the ampIifier.

110
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,244
Of Roland. Thanks to your
pocket money, man.

111
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,681
Let’s jump. Come on.

112
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,320
Veer, mark my words.

113
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:49,683
When Dharam will know of this
lie, it’ll be very bad.

114
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,194
Not at all.

115
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,489
Everything will be fine
as I’ve got this.

116
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,757
Veer, wear this. This is
•Iucky stone for you.

117
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:00,697
Are you ok?

118
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,540
Bring a stone for him
too. -Whatever.

119
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,021
1. 2. 3.

120
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,457
Nice tune.-But it's of no use.

121
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:30,067
We’ve no lyrics for it.
• -Romantic lyrics.

122
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:36,504
It’s very easy for me. -Car mechanic will write songs.

123
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,103
Time for reality check, guys.

124
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,737
Prem didn’t woo meIike
— this. He’s very sly.

125
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:22,344
The more I see you, I feel..

126
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:34,125
..my heart beats only for you.

127
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:42,563
I see you everywhere.

128
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:52,311
I’ll always be with you.

129
00:12:54,774 --> 00:13:02,625
The more I see you, I feel..

130
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:13,266
..my heart beats only for you.

131
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:34,455
What’s my fault if my heart fell for you?

132
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:44,725
For you I’ve forsaken
the world.

133
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:53,811
You’re my love, my world.

134
00:13:55,467 --> 00:14:03,443
These moment are special
as we are together.

135
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:13,487
The more I see you, I feel..

136
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:24,233
..my heart beats only for you.

137
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,570
Move. Please. -Hey, guys.

138
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,374
Entry form for Goa fun fair has been submitted. -Wow.

139
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,971
All credit goes to him
-Awesome, dude.

140
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,075
Yes. -He has good connections.

141
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,209
Give me coffee.-Ok.

142
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,580
My time got wasted
•because of you.

143
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,385
Veer, Chris of Aura group was also there. We’ve to be careful.

144
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:18,460
We’ve to be careful. -Forget
it. We’ll see.

145
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,230
Look. Think of the devil
and devil is here.

146
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,076
Insolent. You ruined my shirt.

147
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,518
I’d to attend meeting. Ar you blind? -Sorry, sir.

148
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,555
Uncle, she’s apologizing.

149
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,784
So will this get cleaned?

150
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,617
It won’t get cleaned if you call her blind.

151
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:54,358
Shut up! Apologize after
— kicking a dog! Wow!

152
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,555
You mean.. which breed, sir?

153
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,795
What do you mean? I’m a dog’?

154
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,166
I was giving an example.
It’s a proverb.

155
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,500
Didn’t your father taught you
how to talk to elders.

156
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,044
Your mother must’ve taught you how to wash clothes. S1

157
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,015
Let it be. He’s old generation.

158
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:16,212
Ok. So this is your generation.

159
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,388
These bunchs of fools.
-Take it easy.

160
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:22,150
He’s laughing like a monkey
from british era.

161
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,751
And it’s hard to say if he’s a boyoragirI.

162
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,992
He’s made in China. He’ll be ruined within 2 days.

163
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,162
• I don’t know if he’s holding • guitar or guitar is holding him.

164
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,034
And you? You’re roaming with
a beard like a goat.

165
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,503
You showed perform before tribals.

166
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,804
And now we are going
to perform for.

167
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,572
..you as you look like tribal.

168
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,243
You mean I'm tribal?-Yes.

169
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,288
Hi, guys. Whom are you ragging?

170
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,186
Look.

171
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,754
Daddy. -Mummy!

172
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,659
Veer, what have you done?

173
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,025
He’s my father.

174
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,993
Dad, I’m so sorry.

175
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,001
I mean, I’m really very sorry. -Shut up. I

176
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,272
I didn’t know your choice was so low. -You’re insulting me.

177
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,602
So what?

178
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,408
Don’t just insult me.
— Abuse me too..

179
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,274
..hit me, but forgive me.

180
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,042
God!I can't stand him.

181
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,744
But dad, I love him. -Come on.

182
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:27,250
Prem, everything got ruined.

183
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,357
You want to solve your problem.

184
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,563
Go to Vidya’s house
and clean it.

185
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,760
Clean his father’
-No, his shirt.

186
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,174
Pal, I don’tthinkthatl shirt could be cleanedJ

187
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:51,808
Sorry, I.. -It’s ok. You didn’t know he was Vidya’s dad.

188
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,717
No. Idrank your glas
by mistake. Sorry.

189
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,054
It's Ok.

190
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:05,124
Prem, jf I don’t get married to Vidya..

191
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,788
..my lie will be caught.

192
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:13,467
Brother will break my nose and take me to hospital.

193
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:21,702
You know what, I deserve
this, Prem.

194
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:28,377
Even though a step-brother, he raised him as his real brother.

195
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,314
He supported me at every step.

196
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,015
Whatdidlgivein return?

197
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:41,597
To double my pocket money
I lied to him.

198
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,468
I feel like a failure.

199
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:53,339
You know what, I’m a faiIure.

200
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,214
I'm the worst failure.

201
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,548
Exhausted and beaten up.

202
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,255
I understand.

203
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:12,219
But I’m worse than you.

204
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,162
I’m a worthless chap.

205
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:23,338
When I was born, people said I was so naughty and cute..

206
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:28,037
..so my dad named me ‘Prem’(love) with love.

207
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:34,313
But he forgot that surname is Chopra.

208
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,144
Prem Chopra.

209
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,150
He died and left this for me.

210
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,197
Chopras 1956. Ancestral gym.

211
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,233
Janvi got stuck with it.

212
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,436
She’s busy every day without
saying a word.

213
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,703
Veer, you know why I want to make car? —

214
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,511
Tell me.

215
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,685
To fill Janvi’s life with happiness.

216
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,452
It’s empty..

217
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,194
Life isn’t so empty, Prem.

218
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,137
No, I was talking about
empty bottle.

219
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,771
Come to eat food. -What
did you cook?

220
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,607
Come.-Sauce.

221
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,582
Come quickly.

222
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:45,814
Guys, great news.

223
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,225
You want money. You’ve to race?

224
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,852
What do we have to
— steal and run?

225
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,493
No, man. There is illegal car race every Saturday in Kolwa.

226
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,999

229
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,212
But I’ve already taken loan from him. He’ll give you.

00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,985
Who?-Tobu.-Tobu.

231
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,121
Tobu, forgive me. I couldn’t repay your money on time.

232
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:35,367
Tobu says he won’t forgive.

233
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,101
You’ll be punished.
-What punishment?

234
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,612
Tobu says you didn’t
listen to him..

235
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,445
..so your ears will be punished.

236
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,809
Ear?cut his ears.

237
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,521
No, if you cut my ear
— I’ll become blind.

238
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,083
How?

239
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,560
If you cut my ears, how
•will I wear glasses? —

240
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,354
Correct.

241
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,527
Sorry. Cut his ears.

242
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,228
No, forgive me. Brother
with guitar.

243
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,737
Help me. -Prem, do something.
-Come, Prem.

244
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,435
He’s our member. The second one..

245
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,439
..music player, has a solid bungalow.

246
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:21,311
Tobu. Tobu, I’ll play. Doitagain. I

247
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:33,127
You’ve stolen my heart.

248
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:38,829
Don’t go away from me.

249
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,295
I got it.

250
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,699
Remix.

251
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,475
You've stolen..

252
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,072
Tobu says stop singing.

253
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,650
Tobu says.. what?

254
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:03,488
• Tobu says if you take 5 lakh I when and how will you return it.

255
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:09,198
Tobu, we’ll make 50 of 5 after winning the race with his car.

256
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,650
Tobu says, go to hell. You
• won’t get finance as..

257
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,586
.Tobu won’t bet money I on such junkcar.

258
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,179
Tobu. -What are you doing?

259
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,753
Mind your Ianguage!

260
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,161
Come, I’ll show you.

261
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,557
Look, special automatic
triple horse..

262
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,260
..power nitrogen engine car.

263
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,501
Tobu says where are the
rest of the cars.

264
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,803
Tobu this car has all
the qualities.

265
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,069
Come, I’ll show you.

266
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,514
People make formula car, I’ve made formula in car.

267
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,085
Look, nitro accelerator
zoom button.

268
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,247
When it’s pressed car will run faster than your gun.

269
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:12,394
Tobu, this car is an example in speed.

270
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:16,223
It’ll mint money once
it’s in race.

271
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,754
Goli, your boss is dancing in excitement after hearing it.

272
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,248
From head to toe..

273
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:48,087
Leg. His legs. Move it.

274

Tobu says loan passed.

276
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,723
Will your nitro pump work? We’ve bet all the money.

277
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:59,525
Car will blast once this
• button is pressed.

278
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,463
Really? -Yes, just watch.

279
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,811
Ok. -I’ll organize my own
— race after this race

280
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,846
I’ll design all the cars of different concepts.

281
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:55,286
Good idea.

282
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:00,463
Itoo think of starting a music company.

283
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,996
Coffee series, like T-series. -Not bad.

284
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,405
Tobu, our car is in
— first position.

285
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,113
I’ve beat 5 Iakh from your side.

286
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:21,275
Today we’ll win jack pot. Sorry.

287
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,780
It’s runing smoothIy.

288
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:02,714
These donkeys turned out
• to be horses of derby.

All the best!

303

Prem, really your car has blasted.

304
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,457
Chris has done it.

305
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,200
No.

306
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,311
Tobu says, pack your Iuggage.

307
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,386
But we’re not going anywhere.

308
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,589
You’ve to go. You’ve to
•evict the bungalow.

309
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,492
Why? We’ll return 5 Iakhs.

310
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:01,797
Not 5 but 10 lakh.

311
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:03,862
10 Iakh. Why?

312
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:08,070
Because of your words Tobu
• bet 5 Iakhs on your race.

313
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,104
And he lost.

But you bet the money.
Why will we pay?

323
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:07,488
It’s been one week, but we
• didn’t arrange 5 Iakhs.

324
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,290
Veer, tell brother Dharam to pay 5 lakh in advance.

325
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:17,167
Which lie should I say now2

Did your brother learnt about I your fake marriage for 2 years?1

343
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,408
But what about Chautala who comes every year.

Bytheway, how many peopIe

454
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,575
Sir Dharam is in Goa.

455
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,410
It's means he will come here.

456
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:12,720
What will he do if he doesn’t see madam Vidya at home.

457
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,218
What are you doing?

458
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:18,293
What will we say if he asks?

459
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,462
What will you say he if asks
why Gopi lives here?

460
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:26,630
How dare you race? What will you do..

461
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:27,464
..if he asks.

462
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:31,701
It’s not easy. His lie of
marriage will be exposed. -Mary.

463
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:37,109
His brother will won’t spare
us. Listen to me

464
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,749
All the best, sir.

465
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:45,253
Prem, think of something
or we’re finished.

466
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,315

I’ll change get up I and become Vidya

468
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:55,693
But I’ve told brother that I’v
married a beautiful girl.

469
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,664
So you change get up and become Vidya.

470
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,201
Be serious.

471
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:05,407
Prem, think of something.

472
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,271

00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,077
Prem.

475
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:15,380
One more idea!

476
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:19,251
•We’II say Vidya is kidnapped I and they want I million ransom.

477
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,283
If your brother pays, Tobu’s
— problem will be solved.

478
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:26,327
Kidnap? Ransom? He’ll
leave flight.

479
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,055
And we’ll be in more problem.

480
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,424
You’re giving third class ideas.

481
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,729
Can’t you think of something better?

482
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,599
I can't see but see.-Look

483
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,167
All the best!

484
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,788
Veer- Brother.

485
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,417
How are you? -I’m fine.
How are you?

486
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:01,592
Brother, he’s my.. -Driver.

487
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,427
No, my friend.

488
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,360
You befriended a driver.

489
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,800
I’m so proud of you,
• Veer. Anyway..

490
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,799
..teII me where is Vidya.

491
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,831
Brother, Vidya can’t..

492
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:18,068
You’ll say she’s missing. She’s been kidnapped.

493
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,742
Hey, make some other story.

494
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,521
I know Vidya is home and angry with me.

495
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,654
Yes, that’s true. Right, Veer?

496
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:35,120
Yes, she’s angry. She has all
• the reasons to be angry.

497
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:36,824
I  've not met her.

498
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,627
And I missed your wedding
for business.

499
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:42,329
We misssed too..

500
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,568
Your presence.

501
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:48,534
Anyway, let’s cut it.

502
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:52,403
And go for coffee. We’ve to
•catch up. -Yes, let’s go

503
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:55,541
Another aircraft is arranged from Singapore to Losoto.

504
00:42:55,906 --> 00:43:00,048
Flight has to come from Mumbai
so it’ll take 4 hours.

505
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,111
We’re sorry.

506
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,784
4 hours deIay.

507
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,358
4 hours deIay.

508
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,261
4 hours deIay.

509
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:11,856
That’s great news.

510
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,198
Let's drink coffee -No!

511
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,668
We’ll go home and drink coffee
with Vidya. How’s that?

512
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,509
Get the car. I’N get my luggage.

513
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,375
Come on, boys. 4 hours
delay. What a..

514
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:30,282
He went to take luggage.
For your funeral.

515
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,523
Will the car come by itself?

516
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:48,793
I’ll get it, brother.

517
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,204
Prem, come. -Excuse me.

518
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,307
If brother goes home, I’ll
— end up in hospital.

519
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,080
Getthe car. I’ll think
• of something.

520
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,082
What willisay to him? -Go.

521
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:08,216
Mother. Mother, ballons.

522
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:18,328
She’s so cute. That’s the
— reason I miss India

523
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,495
I feel like kissing her.

524
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,176
It’s time.. What are you looking at?

525
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,780
It’s Rolex. OriginaI.

526
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:35,681
24 carats gold diamond studded.
It’s worth 2.5 lakhs.

527
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,841
Watches don't excite me.

528
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,481
Now that’s what Ical a hot super model.

529
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:43,848
What a piece!

530
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,118
I think it's new in market.

531
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,630
I never saw it before.

532
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,556
Bumpers are small, but headligthts are good.

533
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,130
I wish I could ride her.

534
00:44:58,862 --> 00:44:59,636
What’s your name?

535
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:04,239
Prem. Prem Chopra.

536
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,245
Fantastic. It suits you.

537
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:11,316
Tell me, which fool answered
the phone at home?

538
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:14,918
I don't know.

539
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,352
Veer- Yes!

540
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,427
Which fool answered the phone at home?1

541
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:22,428
Prem.

542
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,155
Wait.

543
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,363
This is royal gift for the king of Yusoto.

544
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,530
Keep the luggage in.

545
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,271
We are finished.

546
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,399
Don’t worry.

547
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,772
Your wife will be arranged before you reach home.

548
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,371
How leave it me?

549
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,677
Go. All the best!

550
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,346
Chopra isn’t coming.

551
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,521
He has some work.

552
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,524
Coming.

553
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,796
Hello. -Hello, Mary.

554
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,798
Who is it? - Prem.

555
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,869
Sir Prem and sir Veer
went outside.

556
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,399
I'm Prem.

557
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:04,530
Sir, you were at airport.

558
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,403
Can’t I call from airport?

559
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:11,475
Sorry, sir. -Listen, wear sari.1 You’ve to become Vidya.

560
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,509
Veer’s wife. Brother Dharam
will be home soon.

561
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,217
Sir - Yes.

562
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:16,875
All the Best.

563
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:21,655
Hello, sir. Sir, I didn’t hear.

564
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,832
Door will open automatically.

565
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:42,766
Sorry, brother.

566
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,744
Sir Veer, what happened..

567
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,949
She’s your maid. -Yes, brother.

568
00:46:57,114 --> 00:47:00,789
You can’t be wrong.
-You’re right.

569
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,891
I can recognize Vidya.

570
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,309
Vidya. -No..

571
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,606
Vidya. -Brother, actauIIy..

572
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:22,614
Relax, I’ll arrange your wife
•before you reach home.

573
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,452
Actually I.. -Actually you’re angry with me.

574
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:28,378
You should be.

575
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,552
Because I gave priorities to business rather than family.

576
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,560
I’m sorry for that.

577
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,131
Why are you apologizing’
It doesn’t look nice.

578
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:38,325
Actually, Vidya.. -It’s ok.

579
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,094
Chautala was right.

580
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,400
Kapoor family is the best.

581
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,637
Actually I’ve become
a family man.

582
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,340
Veer, well done. -Thank
you, brother.

583
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,442
Your pocket money will
be 2 Iakh now.

584
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,445
Just double. - Double.

585
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:54,816
Double- Double.

586
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:00,652
What happened?

587
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,650
You’ve a big heart. You didn’t
— give it a second thought.

588
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:09,687
I gave it a thought.

589
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:11,425
Anything for a friend.

590
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:24,378
Shower flowers on my mer-maid.

591
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:28,145
Not bad. Impressed without sari.

592
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,275
Brother.

593
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:36,885
Tell me, do you like the
bungalow? And how about Vidya?

594
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:40,884
Bungalow is mine.

595
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:44,594
And why should I talk to you about Vidya?

596
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:49,170
Vidya, get black tea.

597
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:50,561
Sure.

598
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,634
Vidya, get black tea.

599
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:57,740
I’m talking to Vidya.

600
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,179
I’m talking to Vidya too.

601
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,377
Vidya. -Vidya.

602
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:09,384
Veer, is he cross-eyed?

603
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,325
He can’t see or hear properly.

604
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,531
She’s my Vidya.

605
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,762
Yes, P rem. She’s my Vidya.

606
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,366
She’s our Vidya.

607
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,542
Hey! -Leave me!

608
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,585
Leave me. -What’s with him’ -Brother, it’s panic attack. 1

609
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:40,553
What panic attack is it?

610
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,214
I think he's mad.

611
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,121
Mr. Dharam, it’s a disease.

612
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:47,321
He moves like wiper of car
• when he gets attack.

613
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:53,629
Brother, I’ll handle him. He has calmed down.

614
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,597
You.. -Sir, pIease.

615
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,273
I got him.

616
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:06,470
What the hell is wrong with you?

617
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,312
Everything is wrong. I made Mary your wife.

618
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,750
Exactly, your wife became my wife.

619
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,413
I’m talking about Mary not mywife. ‘

620
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:18,382
Yes, it happened as you wanted.

621
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,928
I told Mary on phone..

622
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,595
..to become your wife.

623
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,203
Prem, let this charade go on.

624
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:31,268
Brother, thought Janvi was Vidya and doubled my pocket money.

625
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:32,602
Our problems will be solved.

626
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,505
I don't care.

627
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,636
I saw how lustlull your brother
was at the airport.

628
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,209
Fool! He’ll do something
evil in..

629
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,840
..return of double pocket money.

630
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,279
It’s my wife. Janvi..

631
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,220
How could you? You made
me hyper wiper.

632
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,791
What could I do? He thought
IwasVidya.

633
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,553
So you should’ve told
him the truth.

634
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,494
I was about to, but he doubIed
Veer’s pocket money.

635
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,231
And he’s Veer. Your friend And he’s Veer’s brother. I

636
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,835
Look, don’t get involved! Dharam isn’t a good man.

637
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:07,871
Ok. When you spend Veer’s pocket
• money on your experiments..

638
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:11,476
..u call Veer your brother
and friend.

639
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,872
That’s fine, but.. -Look.

640
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,809
Veer has always helped us. Now it’s our turn.

641
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,548
It’s only for 4 hours.

642
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,882
Now take this tea. - No.

643
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:27,258
And behave nicely with him. Ok.

644
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:29,721
Remember. We’re doing
this for Veer.

645
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:33,561
Go now. - Now.

646
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:40,340
• Sir, sorry I couldn’t hear you on the phone. What did you say?

647
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,173
Iwas saying to slit yourj throat with the knife.1

648
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,443
Prem, go.

649
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,447
Why me?

650
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,744
Veer, tell me.. -Yes.

651
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,752
Why does Chopru live with you?

652
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,949
Brother, he has problem
of panic attack.

653
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:58,854
Doctor, told him to change
his surrounding.

654
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,894
So he shifted her for few days.

655
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:08,767
Listen, it’s dangerous to keep a lunatic at home.

656
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,270
Brother! - Brother!.

657
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,262
Black Tea.

658
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,375
Veer, who is she?

659
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:26,554
She.. she’s a girl.

660
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,625
I know that.But who is she?

661
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:32,458
What do you mean?

662
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:37,287
I mean, I’m Dharam, you’re
Veer and he’s mad.

663
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:38,790
Who is she?

664
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,130
I.. tell him she’s girlfriend.

665
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,239
His.

666
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,441
Mine.

667
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,170
Why is your girlfriend’s
•snap in this house?•

668
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:53,942
Can’t you control your girl friend?

669
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:55,915
I did.

670
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:59,610
But you messed everything.
-Really?

671
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:04,884
It’s surprising that even you
• can have a girl friend.

672
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:07,321
Why? Why not?

673
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,760
It’s possible.

674
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,394
Anyone can be mistaken.

675
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,499
Look, you’re insuIting
my girl friend.

676
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,105
Insult?

677
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:23,301
She was insulted when she
•became your girl friend.

678
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:27,678
Brother, leave it. Leave it.

679
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,910
Yes, leave it.

680
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,817
His girlfriend’s snap can
be in this house..

681
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,821
..but not Vidya’s.

682
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,658
It'll be somewhere around.

683
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:41,923
I’ve. Look, brother.

684
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:49,561
Veer, why is Vidya’s photo in his wallet?

685
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:53,832
Prem, how is Vidya’s photo
in your wallet?

686
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,735
Veer, how is Vidya’s photo in my wallet?

687
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:01,474
Dharam, this is Veer’s waIIet.

688
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,780
He send Prem to buy bread.
— He took the wallet. -Yes.

689
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,653
Give it me. What?

690
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:07,687
Yes.

691
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:12,351
You’ve no money even to buy bread. Disgusting.

692
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:17,392
Mr. Dharam, my time will also come. —

693
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:25,470
Do you see this. This
•is Rolex. Original.

694
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,769
You can’t get such time.

695
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:34,474
Buttell me, how did
— Vidya’s photo..

696
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:37,347
Dharam, geyser is on. Take bath.

697
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,817
Take bath, brother.

698
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,182
Yes go. on.

699
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,385
I'll take bath.

700
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,632
Veer. - Veer.

701
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,195
How did you like the room?

702
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,202
Room? This is a bungalow.

703
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:04,144
Listen, hurry up. My
•wife is pregnant.

704
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,811
I’ve to take to to hospital
any moment.

705
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:10,476
Congrats, Dhondu. ChiId
— is a father of woman.

706
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:14,249
Ok. Should I get the
— luggage? -Wait.

707
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,588
Let me put this first.

708
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,420
RGV. Raghunandandas Govardhandas
Vagawle.

709
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:23,293
Vagawl.

710
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:39,707
What are you doing?

711
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:45,650
This is my house. I can do anything. Who are you?•

712
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,824
Please heIp!

713
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:04,099
He'll kill me.

714
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,875
Please. How long will! you keep beating me’

715
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:17,243
Oh no! Don’t hit me. -What
happened, brother?

716
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,548
An idiot was putting his nameplate here.

717
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,616
Where did he go, brother? -Up.

718
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:27,253
You killed him.

719
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:30,422
No, he’s up there.

720
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,396
Prem.

721
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:33,394
You know him. - No.

722
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,492
It’s formal hi, hello. Hi. -Hi.

723
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,401
Hello. -What are you
•doing, upstairs?

724
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,701
This man hit me. - You!

725
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:43,266
Mr. Dharam, you’re rich so you’ll exploit poor.

726
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,505
This isn't fair.

727
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,638
No. Hey, you. -What?

728
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,640
Get down fool. - Don't hit me.

729
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,685
• I’ll explain it to • you. Come with me.

730
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:52,981
Please come.

731
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,188
Who is he?

732
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:58,782
Brother, Raghu is actually
mad. -What?

733
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,556
Yes, Raghu. Brother]
— Dharam is mad.

734
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:05,355
So we put extra sugar
in tea. -Why?

735
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,128
To digest bitter truth.

736
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:08,832
But how did it happen?

737
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,134
Once Raghu owned 6 bungalow
in this area.

738
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,333
He got addicted to betting
in cricket match.

739
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,207
Tell me.Listen.

740
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:21,214
You know the match of Yuvraj.
-Yes, 6 sixes on 6 baIls.

741
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,611
Brother had bet that he can’t hit six. -ReaIIy?

742
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:27,546
Then. Then What?

743
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,656
Every ball was out of boundary.

744
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:35,161
And Raghu lost all hisi bungalows in gambling.

745
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,489
And then over eneded there.

746
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,457
..n his madness started.

747
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,497
Now he thinks every bungalow
is his lost bungalow.

748
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:46,468
He chants bungalow all day.

749
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,605
I don’t know what he says.

750
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:53,643
It means this mad man is here, there, everywhere.

751
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,275
Brother, it’s dangerous.

752
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:57,476
It’s dangerous.

753
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:02,956
But doctor say that if he stays
*near this bungalow he might get cured.

754
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:06,285
Not all all. He should be sent to asylum.

755
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:08,555
That’s why we’re shifting
brother to Losoto.

756
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:09,722
Flight is in 4 hours.

757
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:14,329
But I came with the luggage in tempo.1

758
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:16,932
So shift. Rental with
— mental. Come.

759
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:22,734
Come. -No, he’ll break my denaI.
We’ll come after 4 hours.

760
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,506
Come. -We’ll catch up Iater.

761
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:30,475
Dhondu, God has made such
a big man crazy.

762
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,884
Let’s go.;0]

763
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,940
Where is the packing?

764
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,636
Where? - Don't shout.

765
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,970
Don't shoo me.- Where is the..

766
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:00,873
Talk softIy.

767
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,276
You got tempo. -Who are they?

768
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,954
They’re my friends.

769
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,156
Why did they come in tempo?

770
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,652
To get your luggage to airport.

771
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:15,919
One tempo for 2 bags.

772
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,798
So you needed 2 tempos.

773
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:24,797
Actually all these things will also go with your luggage.

774
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,532
Veer won’t let you go empty handed.

775
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:29,643
Whose idea was it of gifts?

776
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,804
Of Prem. - I knew it.

777
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:37,817
Veer. - Yes?

778
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,278
If you want to give me something..

779
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,188
..give me Vidya.

780
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:45,959
I’ll take Vidya along.

781
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:49,595
Will you come with me, Vidya?

782
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,256
You?

783
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,826
Hey!

784
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,904
Do you own her! How dare
•you touch her! -What?

785
00:59:58,227 --> 00:59:59,570
Brother, side please.

786
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:02,137
Go from middle.Go from middle.

787
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:03,307
Uninvited guest.

788
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:05,639
Go from middle.Get Lost.

789
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:07,375
get out. get out.

790
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:10,851
What is this?. Go. Go.

791
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,116
You too go. -Prem. Prem.

792
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:18,715
Prem, let’s go. Prem move.

793
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:30,796
What happened to him.

794
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,471
Another panic attack.
I’ll see him.

795
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:35,968
You wait here.

796
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:38,674
Not even in a mall...

797
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,476
..so many people don’t come
as in your bungalow.

798
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:43,642
We will take him out
for shopping.

799
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,319
We’ll take his luggage also and leave him to airport directly.

800
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,617
But who will convinc
him to go out?

801
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,750
I’ll talk to him.-Wait. Not you.

802
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:54,688
I'll do this.

803
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:09,274
I hope Veer isn’t irritating you?

804
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:13,012
If yes then this is my personal
number, call me.

805
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,371
There is no need of that.

806
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,542
Veer is a good husband.-You
look forward.

807
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,850
Why? I’m not driving.

808
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,180
Then why are you looking back?
-I’m keeping an eye.

809
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,654
On what? -Cars coming
from behind.

810
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:25,957
someone shouldn't knock us.

811
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,255
There is rear view mirror.

812
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:30,325
But I’m free then wha
— need of mirror?

813
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:32,565
Sit properly. Don’t
— take tension.

814
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,124
Why? Who will take care of him?

815
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:39,531
Mr. Dharam, actually Prem
• is so attached to you..

816
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,565
..that he’s taking care of you.

817
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:44,035
That’s why he’s Iooking
•at you. -Oh my God!

818
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,675
Dindayal protects me so much.

819
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:50,046
Who is Dindayal? Your
security man?

820
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,351
No. My doberman.

821
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,247
Prem, look forward.

822
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,994
Coffee. -Thank you.

823
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:08,194
Prem, not coffee.. Doctor Verma has warned you. I

824
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:14,707
Dr. verma is our common doctor.

825
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,938

Hello. Yes, aunty. How are you?

830
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:32,151
Veer.-Yes.

831
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:40,195
Don’t you feel odd.

832
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,232
Odd. Why, brother?

833
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,438
Vidya’s phone on Prem’s
cell. Isn’t it odd?

834
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,101
Brother, we’re getting calls
on phone. I mean..

835
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:52,277
..itwill be odd when we get fax on phone.

836
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,980
Why didn’t call for Vidya came on your phone?

837
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,982
I think network.
-Network is full.

838
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:04,551
Full network.

839
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:08,019
This is Veer’s phone.

840
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,126
They’re identical sets.
— It was by mistake.

841
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:12,731
This is mine.

842
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:18,128
In Losoto military coup is announced.

843
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:20,270
There is curfew imposed.

844
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:23,373
And king Bumbata is under house arrest.

845
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:26,770
Authorities.. -King Bumbata.

846
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,776
Losoto’s king. My friend.

847
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:32,744
Its ok, brother, I’m sure everything will be fine.

848
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:34,685
Control yourself, Mr. Dharam.

849
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:36,786
Vidya, my friend.. -Leave her.

850
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,283
I mean leave this. Let’s
go to airport.

851
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:41,555
You’re right.

852
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:44,496
because of curfew in lostso..

853
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:48,759
..all flights to Losot are cancelled for now.

854
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:51,497
Now the.. -How could it happen?

855
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:53,037
How did this happen?

856
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:55,041
How will I go there? -How
will he go there?

It’s a big problem. -Yes.

858
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:00,069
Veer.-Veer.-Veer.

859
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:01,581
Janvi. I mean Vidya.

Brother won’t go. Brother won’t go.

864
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:13,891
Brother won’t go

865
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:19,160
I didn’t knew that he loves me a lot.

866
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,894
Don’t worry about the expenses
of chartered plane

867
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:25,529
What! Even Charter Plane
can’t land there?

868
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:27,404
No. You’ve to do something.

869
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:30,205
You’re the captain of ship. Can’t you go to Losoto.

891
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,164
Oh, you’re thinking that

892
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:34,274
But what’s a big deal for him?

893
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:35,900
He's rich.

894
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,339
Veer.-Yes.

895
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,307
An astrologer told me..

896
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:46,246
..I'll kill someday..

897
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,287
..someone one day.

898

01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,307
You go to my house and bring some clothes for me and Prem.

905
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,842
Ok, Janvi. Ok?

906
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:16,277

Wait.-Hello.

Hey Red chili. -What?

911
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,497
Go and call your bosses.

912
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:42,239
I beg your pardon.

913
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:43,842
What pardon?

914
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,207
Tell them that his father
is in garden.

915
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:51,113
Look, if you give respecti
you take respect.

916
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:53,414
Ok. You give me respect..

917
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:56,221
..I'll take it.

918
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:59,350
Oh! God he touched me.

919
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:02,056
Someone help me. -What’s
going on? -Sir.

920
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:05,930
Sir, this man touched me from here to here.

921
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,327
Who are you ?

922
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:10,871
Me? Goli (tabIet).

923
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,206
Were you a capsule when
you were born?

924
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:15,606
Hey, you don’t know me.

925
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:19,105
People die when I breathe.

926
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:22,114
Then chose a good mouth fresher.

927
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,374
You’re mocking me.

928
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:46,269
Mummy!.

929
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:47,898
Dhondu, move the tempo.

930
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,106
Mummy!.

You fool.-Brother.

933
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:03,217
Goli.Brother Goli.

934
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:05,822
You know him.

935
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:09,830

01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,242
Don’t judge a book by its cover.

948
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,743
Why do you know onIy such kind of peopIe?

01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:17,395
How will we pay 2.5 lakhs

953
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,580

It’s rolex. OriginaI. Worth 2.5 Iakh.

969
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,759
You stole my brother’s watch.

970
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:01,032
You want watch on
•your brother’s..

01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,330
..wrist or heads on our shoulders. —

972
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,372
Heads.- Good.

01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:08,198
It's Rolex.

01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,505
Original. 24 carat gold, diamond
studded. Water proof.

01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,991
Tobu says, remaining 5 Iakh..

01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:31,990
..after 2 days.

978
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:39,568
If we don’t pay him 5 Iakhs
we are finished.

979
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:41,438
Think. -I’ll come up
•with something.

980
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:44,268
Trust God. -Why are
• you so relaxed?

981
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,708
Mary. -Sir.

982
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,345
Did you see my watch? -Watch?

983
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,543
Rolex?-Yes

984
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,384
Round - Yes.

985
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:58,220
Diamond-studded? -Yes.
-I didn’t see it.

986
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:02,890
Vidya, did you see my watch?

987
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:05,027
No, Mr. Dharam. -Veer.

988
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:08,097
I don’t know. -Strange.

989
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:11,063
How could it just disappear?
-Brother.—-------J

990
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:15,066
What’s the time? -How can
I say without watch?

991
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:17,308
That’s right. But what’s the time.

992
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:21,011
I’ve watch if you want
to check time.

993
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:23,539
It’s not expensive but shows correct time

994
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:34,786
Janvi, you know what?

995
01:12:35,015 --> 01:12:36,426
We got sponsors for our show.

996
01:12:37,818 --> 01:12:41,061
Veer, listen.

997
01:12:41,822 --> 01:12:43,096
You know what?

998
01:12:43,156 --> 01:12:44,794
We got sponsors for our show.

999
01:12:45,292 --> 01:12:46,703
Our dream will come true.

1000
01:12:48,695 --> 01:12:50,732
Oh my God.

1001
01:12:50,797 --> 01:12:52,367
Brother.-Oh God!

1002
01:12:53,834 --> 01:12:54,812
What’s going on, Veer?

1003
01:12:55,302 --> 01:12:56,576
When did you come, 1II brother Dharam?

1004
01:12:56,637 --> 01:12:59,811
Didn’t you recognize her? Prem’s snap.

1005
01:13:00,207 --> 01:13:01,345
He’s my Janvi.

1006
01:13:02,142 --> 01:13:06,090
If she’s your girl friend, why did she kiss Prem?

1007
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:07,850
What drama is going on?

1008
01:13:08,382 --> 01:13:10,794
It's about a drama.-drama?

1009
01:13:11,518 --> 01:13:14,431
Actually their musical group
is playing a culture.

1010
01:13:14,821 --> 01:13:17,665
On 26th January. She
•was rehearsing it.

1011
01:13:18,692 --> 01:13:21,070
She starts anytime. Let me
— say action first, silly.

1012
01:13:21,128 --> 01:13:22,869
But I don’t think she was acting.

1013
01:13:24,731 --> 01:13:27,371
But acting has to be original.

1014
01:13:27,634 --> 01:13:29,636
I mean she’s so talented.
-Thank God.

1015
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:31,676
I thought something eIse.

1016
01:13:31,738 --> 01:13:34,184
Thank God. You didn’t think
of something else.

1017
01:13:37,144 --> 01:13:40,318
Tell me, what’s the name of the play?

1018
01:13:44,618 --> 01:13:46,393
Yours is mine and mine..

1019
01:13:47,554 --> 01:13:48,624
Yours is mine.

1020
01:13:48,689 --> 01:13:49,759
Lets rehearse-Ok.

1021
01:13:50,157 --> 01:13:52,831
wait.

1022
01:13:54,628 --> 01:13:56,107
Such a cheap name.

1023
01:13:57,197 --> 01:14:00,474
On 26th January you should
— play a patriotic theme.

1024
01:14:01,401 --> 01:14:04,211
Love. Sacrifice. Country. -Yes.

1025
01:14:07,174 --> 01:14:08,744
It has all these things.

1026
01:14:11,311 --> 01:14:12,449
You can see love.

1027
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,150
His dad drinks country liquor.

1028
01:14:14,614 --> 01:14:16,150
And I’m making sacrifice.

1029
01:14:16,216 --> 01:14:17,320
I’m the producer.

1030
01:14:20,387 --> 01:14:23,391
He has no money to buy bread,
• but has become producer.

1031
01:14:28,462 --> 01:14:29,736
Anyway..

1032
01:14:30,597 --> 01:14:32,804
Veer, kiss was in the script.

1033
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,806
And you kissed her.

1034
01:14:35,369 --> 01:14:36,609
No love, no emotions.

1035
01:14:37,237 --> 01:14:38,409
There should be a build up.

1036
01:14:39,539 --> 01:14:41,678
Brother, I didn’t get it.

1037
01:14:42,275 --> 01:14:43,549
No? I’ll explain.

1038
01:14:43,844 --> 01:14:45,221
Move.-Let it be.

1039
01:14:45,278 --> 01:14:47,724
Move. -It’s okay
-Wait a minute.

1040
01:14:48,148 --> 01:14:50,321
Brother has experience
-Come here.

1041
01:14:52,119 --> 01:14:53,257
Cue.

1042
01:14:54,488 --> 01:14:56,593
We got sponsor of our show.. -What?

1043
01:14:56,656 --> 01:14:58,727
Our dream will come true.

1044
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:00,237
Oh my God. -What?

1045
01:15:00,293 --> 01:15:02,330
Anyway, let it be. Dear..

1046
01:15:03,296 --> 01:15:06,106
Dream shouldn’t be just woven.

1047
01:15:07,267 --> 01:15:10,248
Dream should make us sleepless.

1048
01:15:11,505 --> 01:15:14,111
That’s rig ht.

1049
01:15:14,174 --> 01:15:15,312
Brother.

1050
01:15:15,509 --> 01:15:17,546
Yes. What is it? -Your
— phone is ringing.

1051
01:15:17,611 --> 01:15:18,681
Where? -In your pocket.

1052
01:15:18,745 --> 01:15:19,849
Losoto.

1053
01:15:20,113 --> 01:15:21,217
Losoto.

1054
01:15:26,052 --> 01:15:28,089
Brother crossed the
— Iimitthistime.

1055
01:15:28,422 --> 01:15:30,402
Now you understood..

1056
01:15:30,457 --> 01:15:32,232
..how it feels when someone else uses your credit card?

1057
01:15:33,126 --> 01:15:34,537
Tell me what’s going on.

1058
01:15:34,594 --> 01:15:36,471
Dharam came suddenly
and thought I was..

1059
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:38,100
..Vidya and doubled the pocket money.

1060
01:15:38,365 --> 01:15:40,276
In short, I’m Vidya now..

1061
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:41,368
..and you Janvi. -Yes.

1062
01:15:41,435 --> 01:15:43,176
And before new problem
arise, go.

1063
01:15:43,203 --> 01:15:45,274
Please go. -Don’t worry.

1064
01:15:45,839 --> 01:15:47,477
It's 2.

1065
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:49,578
And Venus is vertical. Ther
won’t be any problem.

1066
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:52,222
Vidya, please. Go. HelloI
sister-in-law.

1067
01:16:01,288 --> 01:16:02,824
How are you, my Veer?

1068
01:16:03,089 --> 01:16:05,296
Brother Prem. Sister-in-law Janvi. What’s going on?

1069
01:16:05,559 --> 01:16:06,594
Where is Mr. Dharam?

1070
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,800
Brother left for Losoto.

1071
01:16:09,863 --> 01:16:11,171
How could he?

1072
01:16:11,598 --> 01:16:13,509
Without any prior notice.

1073
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:15,740
Mad has gone. Dhondu shift.

1074
01:16:16,203 --> 01:16:18,342
My prayer has been answered.

1075
01:16:18,405 --> 01:16:20,885
Owner is in the bungalow.

1076
01:16:21,308 --> 01:16:23,117
Do you get it? -ShouId

1077
01:16:23,343 --> 01:16:25,084
Justchill.-Whoarethey?

1078
01:16:26,313 --> 01:16:28,315
They’re.. -Prem’s friends.

01:16:29,182 --> 01:16:31,253
Oh! How do you do?

1080

Well. -Ragunanddas Govardhandas
Vag havle.

1081
01:16:34,321 --> 01:16:35,698
Dhondu.

1082
01:16:36,356 --> 01:16:38,461
I’m owner of the bungaIow.

1083
01:16:40,427 --> 01:16:41,565
He’s psychiatrist.

1084
01:16:42,395 --> 01:16:43,601
He doesnot seem to be.

1085
01:16:43,864 --> 01:16:45,241
Should I get the luggage?

1086
01:16:45,265 --> 01:16:47,836
Dhondu. -Just chill. -Flight
didn’t resume.

1087
01:16:48,235 --> 01:16:49,771
But how could it be? Mr. Dharam..

1088
01:16:50,804 --> 01:16:52,875
Bye, Veer. -Bye.

Chautala.

When did you come? -Mr. Dharam..

1091
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:02,155
..u are home, but they said..

1092
01:17:02,215 --> 01:17:03,353
..u left to Losoto.

1093
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:05,291
What is this mad man doing here?

1094
01:17:05,752 --> 01:17:06,856
Vidya, come here.

1095
01:17:07,387 --> 01:17:09,526
Sir, she’s sister-in-law Janvi.

1096
01:17:09,589 --> 01:17:10,795
Mary, you too come here.

1097
01:17:10,857 --> 01:17:12,393
Sir, she’s sister-in-law Janv.

1098
01:17:12,459 --> 01:17:13,631
She’s sister-in-law Vidya.

1099
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:15,305
Are you mad?

1100
01:17:15,595 --> 01:17:16,665
She’s Vidya. -Yes.

1101
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:19,438
A mad man thinks everyone
else is mad.

1102
01:17:20,567 --> 01:17:22,569
All amd man look alike.

1103
01:17:23,303 --> 01:17:25,214
Sir, don’t confuse me.

1104
01:17:25,405 --> 01:17:27,510
Are you a riddle..

1105
01:17:27,574 --> 01:17:29,076
..to confuse you more.

1106

No. WeII done, doctor.

1107

Good treatment.

1108
01:17:33,747 --> 01:17:36,421
You! He’s not a doctor, idiot.

1109
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,354
Correct.

1110
01:17:38,418 --> 01:17:39,726
This sofa isn't sofa and ..

1111
01:17:39,786 --> 01:17:41,231
..door isn't door.

1112
01:17:41,288 --> 01:17:43,097
This pant isn’t pant.

1113
01:17:43,156 --> 01:17:44,726
He’s not Ajay Devgan. -Quiet.

1114
01:17:44,791 --> 01:17:46,532
He's not a doctor.

1115
01:17:46,593 --> 01:17:48,766
I'm new man.-Get out.

1116
01:17:49,329 --> 01:17:51,639
Veer, get him out. Janvi, come here.

1117
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:54,401
Sir, she’s not Janvi.

1118
01:17:54,601 --> 01:17:57,309
Should I get the luggage.
— -Just chill, Dhondu.

1119
01:17:57,337 --> 01:17:59,248
Sir, are you going mad?

1120
01:17:59,306 --> 01:18:01,650
What are you harping, ChautaIa?

1121
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:04,848
That’s why you’re called, doctor..

1122
01:18:05,111 --> 01:18:07,091
..to treat lunatic. Right, Prem?

1123
01:18:07,447 --> 01:18:10,485
Veer, Veer!

1124
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:13,292
Veer, he’s talking to you. Come on.

1125
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,227
Get him out.

01:29:06,906 --> 01:29:08,544
I’m doing fighting for 30 years.

1291
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:22,583
Hit him.

1292
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,867
Oh no!- Dad is outside.

1293
01:32:17,196 --> 01:32:18,698
Bye, Janvi. -Ok, bye.

1294
01:32:18,764 --> 01:32:21,938
Wait, idiots. Don’t you’ve manners or etiquettes.

1295
01:32:23,302 --> 01:32:24,940
Janvi, I’ll drop you home. Veer, get out.

1296
01:32:25,738 --> 01:32:28,378
Dad, thank God you’re safe.

1297
01:32:28,808 --> 01:32:31,345
Inspector Walia phoned
and told..

1298
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:32,684
..there was fig hting
• at your place.

1299
01:32:32,745 --> 01:32:34,656
Yes, but he was there.

1300
01:32:35,247 --> 01:32:36,658
He thrashed them.

1301
01:32:36,715 --> 01:32:39,719
They’ll be in hospital
for a month.

1302
01:32:39,785 --> 01:32:41,822
And the
— toMr.
credit goes Dharam.

1303
01:32:42,455 --> 01:32:43,866
Veer's elder brother.

1304
01:32:44,089 --> 01:32:46,535
The famous Mr. Dharam Kapur.

1305
01:32:46,725 --> 01:32:48,102
Thank you, sir.

1306
01:32:48,294 --> 01:32:50,331
You brought my daughter
safely home.

1307
01:32:50,529 --> 01:32:53,339
I’m pleased to see you.

1308
01:32:53,732 --> 01:32:55,405
Why?

1309
01:32:55,468 --> 01:32:58,142
No, I was giving an example.

1310
01:32:58,337 --> 01:33:00,248
An example. A proverb.

1311
01:33:00,706 --> 01:33:02,743
You know, dad, he dances very well.

1312
01:33:02,808 --> 01:33:05,789
He plays drum very weII. Mind-blowing. Superb.

1313
01:33:05,845 --> 01:33:07,381
Anyway, I’ll go and change.

1314
01:33:07,646 --> 01:33:09,148
Bye. -Bye.;0]

1315
01:33:09,448 --> 01:33:11,792
Ok, sir. Thank you very much. -Wait.

1316
01:33:15,387 --> 01:33:16,695
ldon’t know if I should say this.

1317
01:33:17,189 --> 01:33:19,760
But your daughter is
• going to marry.. —

1318
01:33:20,459 --> 01:33:22,234
..a boy who isn’t worthy of becoming your son-in-law.

1319
01:33:22,828 --> 01:33:24,239
You’re saying this.

1320
01:33:25,197 --> 01:33:26,505
What’s going on?

1321
01:33:26,565 --> 01:33:28,772
You’re getting criticized
because of him.

1322
01:33:30,436 --> 01:33:32,279
But my daughter says..

1323
01:33:32,338 --> 01:33:34,375
..he’s decent, upright..

1324
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:35,578
..and down to earth.

1325
01:33:35,641 --> 01:33:36,915
You’re right. Down to earth.

1326
01:33:37,576 --> 01:33:39,317
He’s very IowIy.

1327
01:33:40,613 --> 01:33:42,559
Your daughte
— (love)

1328
01:33:43,415 --> 01:33:45,486
My daughter’s Prem (love)
isn’t right.

1329
01:33:46,352 --> 01:33:49,231
But what to do? - love is blind.

1330
01:33:50,189 --> 01:33:52,829
Actually, because of you..

1331
01:33:53,459 --> 01:33:55,336
..connection to Kapur’s famiIy..

1332
01:33:55,394 --> 01:33:56,702
..I thought..

1333
01:33:57,663 --> 01:33:59,506
I don’t blame you. Listen.

1334
01:34:00,266 --> 01:34:03,440
If you put horse’s shoe on donkey..

1335
01:34:03,869 --> 01:34:05,405
..don key won’t become horse.

1336
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:07,913
If I could’ve my way..

1337
01:34:08,374 --> 01:34:10,445
..I’d drive him out of my house.

1338
01:34:11,577 --> 01:34:13,181
He’s not my own.

1339
01:34:13,512 --> 01:34:15,287
Step-brother. -What? -No.

1340
01:34:15,347 --> 01:34:16,348
Straight-forward .

1341
01:34:16,415 --> 01:34:18,895
I’ve seen straight-forward
man like you.

1342
01:34:18,951 --> 01:34:21,158
We don’t see such kind hearted man.

1343
01:34:21,887 --> 01:34:24,766
By the way, are you married. -Bachelor.

1344
01:34:25,357 --> 01:34:27,098
Oh! Muscular.

1345
01:34:27,459 --> 01:34:28,904
Popular. Spectacular.

1346
01:34:29,128 --> 01:34:32,166
And bachelor. -And I can also dance.

1347
01:34:33,866 --> 01:34:36,210
Why are they hugging?

1348
01:34:36,735 --> 01:34:38,373
Marriage is fixed. Congrats.

1349
01:34:38,871 --> 01:34:40,316
What are you saying?

1350
01:34:40,573 --> 01:34:42,712
Vidya will surely be
daughter-in-law of Kapur family.

1351
01:34:43,175 --> 01:34:44,711
What are you saying?

1352
01:34:44,777 --> 01:34:46,654
But wife of elder brother.

1353
01:34:47,746 --> 01:34:49,589
What are you saying?

1354
01:34:55,588 --> 01:34:57,192
Good night, Veer. -Good
night, brother.

1355
01:34:59,692 --> 01:35:01,763
Good night, Vidya. -Good
night, brother.

1356
01:35:02,161 --> 01:35:04,402
Leave me. -Good night.

1357
01:35:05,731 --> 01:35:08,337
Hey! Why are you going there?

1358
01:35:10,369 --> 01:35:11,814
I’m scared to sleep alone.

1359
01:35:12,571 --> 01:35:14,517
Sleep with me. Come. -No.

1360
01:35:14,773 --> 01:35:16,252
I'm not so scared.

1361
01:35:16,875 --> 01:35:18,513
Good night. -Good night.

1362
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:22,516
Good night. -Good night.

1363
01:35:23,215 --> 01:35:25,422
Come. When will this problem be solved?

1364
01:35:26,452 --> 01:35:29,126
God, when will my brother
go to Losoto.

1365
01:35:30,356 --> 01:35:31,835
Veer, Iwas thinking
• of something.

1366
01:35:32,257 --> 01:35:33,895
We've lied now.

1367
01:35:34,126 --> 01:35:35,867
But when you’ll marry Vidya..

1368
01:35:35,928 --> 01:35:37,635
..Mr. Dharam wiII find the truth.

1369
01:35:38,831 --> 01:35:40,276
Why are you scaring me, Janvi.

1370
01:35:40,633 --> 01:35:41,839
We'll think about it later.

1371
01:35:42,701 --> 01:35:44,112
Good night.

1372
01:35:56,482 --> 01:35:58,826
What are you doing? -Exercise
early morning..

1373
01:35:59,218 --> 01:36:01,357
..is good for healt -
-It’s late night.

1374
01:36:01,654 --> 01:36:03,133
There’s time to morning.

1375
01:36:04,156 --> 01:36:05,499
Late night.

1376
01:36:05,924 --> 01:36:07,301
What's the time?

1377
01:36:08,661 --> 01:36:10,607
You don’t have a watch.
Good night.

1378
01:36:21,206 --> 01:36:23,277
Coming. -No.

1379
01:36:32,317 --> 01:36:34,820
Vidya. -Prem, dad is admitted
in hospital. -What?

1380
01:36:44,129 --> 01:36:46,609
It’s you. -Prem, there is a problem. -What?

1381
01:36:47,433 --> 01:36:48,878
Vidya phoned. Her dad
is in hospital.

1382
01:36:49,301 --> 01:36:50,439
He got heart attack.

1383
01:36:51,136 --> 01:36:52,444
It had to happen. -What?

1384
01:36:52,504 --> 01:36:54,506
Your brother must’ve said
something worse.

1385
01:36:54,773 --> 01:36:55,843
Forget that. What should I do now?.

1386
01:36:55,908 --> 01:36:57,251
Go to hospital.

1387
01:36:57,910 --> 01:37:00,356
Veer, where are you going?

1388
01:37:01,213 --> 01:37:02,521
So late in the night.

1389
01:37:03,916 --> 01:37:06,556
Vi. Janvi’s father
•is in hospital.

1390
01:37:07,753 --> 01:37:09,426
Really? -Yes.

1391
01:37:09,488 --> 01:37:12,298
So he should go. Why
are you going?

1392
01:37:13,158 --> 01:37:16,401
Brother, if I go and Janvi’s
father sees me..

1393
01:37:16,795 --> 01:37:18,797
..his heart attack will become heart fail.

1394
01:37:19,465 --> 01:37:20,705
Correct.

1395
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:23,837
You’ve said something right
— for the first time in life.

1396
01:37:24,203 --> 01:37:26,149
Veer, you go. All the
best. Ok? -Ok.

1397
01:37:26,338 --> 01:37:27,612
I’ll phone you.

1398
01:37:37,149 --> 01:37:38,890
Come.- Come.- No.

1399
01:37:47,826 --> 01:37:50,306
Meena, I’m not a rogue.

1400
01:37:51,263 --> 01:37:53,300
What? You’re in hospital.

1401
01:37:54,199 --> 01:37:55,644
Have patience, Meena.

1402
01:37:56,201 --> 01:37:59,273
Let me deliver the goods before
you deliver the baby.

1403
01:37:59,705 --> 01:38:01,685
Have patience. I’m coming.

1404
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:03,817
I’m coming, dear.

1405
01:38:04,143 --> 01:38:06,714
Coming. -Dhondu. -What?

1406
01:38:07,179 --> 01:38:09,557
Tell your half-better? -What?

1407
01:38:09,615 --> 01:38:11,856
Just chill, Meena.

1408
01:38:11,917 --> 01:38:14,329
Yes. -Shut up, fool.

1409
01:38:14,686 --> 01:38:16,893
Dad, you can’t leave us.
-What are you doing?

1410
01:38:16,955 --> 01:38:18,730
No. -Dad, talk to me.

1411
01:38:18,791 --> 01:38:20,600
He has no problem.

1412
01:38:21,426 --> 01:38:23,599
He got breathing problem
because of gas.

1413
01:38:24,196 --> 01:38:25,698
Oh! Thank God.

1414
01:38:25,764 --> 01:38:28,574
Dad, you’re saved. -Help me.

1415
01:38:28,767 --> 01:38:31,213
I’m dead. I’ll di beca use of you.

1416
01:38:31,270 --> 01:38:32,510
Because of me. - This.

1417
01:38:33,238 --> 01:38:36,378
Move your leg from oxygen pipe.

1418
01:38:36,441 --> 01:38:40,321
Vidya, he’ll kill me like a fox. -Dad.

1419
01:38:40,379 --> 01:38:42,723
Don’t say fox. -l was giving an example.

1420
01:38:43,315 --> 01:38:46,125
It’s example. It’s proverb.

1421
01:38:46,351 --> 01:38:49,298
Dad. - Doctor.

1422
01:38:49,922 --> 01:38:51,401
Doctor.

1423
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:52,694
He’s heart attack i
getting severe.

1424
01:38:52,758 --> 01:38:53,896
We need to move him
— into ICU. -What?

1425
01:38:54,359 --> 01:38:56,805
Get the stretcher. - Dad.

1426
01:38:58,597 --> 01:39:01,134
What happened? -Get out of here.

1427
01:39:16,748 --> 01:39:18,625
God, you scared me.

1428
01:39:19,451 --> 01:39:21,260
What are you doing here?
• -Icametomeetyou. I

1429
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:22,965
Vidya’s dad got heart probIem.

1430
01:39:23,422 --> 01:39:24,958
He’s in Holy Care hospital. -Vidya.

1431
01:39:25,524 --> 01:39:27,162
Vidya. -God, it’s Mr. Dharam.

1432
01:39:27,226 --> 01:39:28,569
Open the door. -No, Prem.

1433
01:39:28,894 --> 01:39:31,738
You don’t worry. I’ll handle him. -Open the door, Vidya.

1434
01:39:32,297 --> 01:39:34,834
Coming. Coming. -Vidya.

1435
01:39:36,869 --> 01:39:38,439
What happened? Wh
•are you shouting?

1436
01:39:38,971 --> 01:39:42,578
That.. Lizard. - Lizard?

1437
01:39:43,775 --> 01:39:46,517
There is a lizard in room.
I’m scared of it.

1438
01:39:46,778 --> 01:39:49,691
No problem. Sleep in my room.

1439
01:39:50,249 --> 01:39:52,627
I’ll sleep here. -No.
-l won’t hear a word.

1440
01:39:52,684 --> 01:39:54,527
Please go. -Mr. Dharam.

1441
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,700
Go. -Go. - Mr. Dharam.

1442
01:40:10,202 --> 01:40:12,375
Look who are going in?

1443
01:40:12,437 --> 01:40:14,713
And you rented the house yet..

1444
01:40:14,773 --> 01:40:16,411
..you’re with a tern po driver outside.

1445
01:40:16,675 --> 01:40:18,245
Do you’ve any value?

1446
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:20,620
Don't talk about value.

1447
01:40:20,679 --> 01:40:22,249
Don't shout.

1448
01:40:22,514 --> 01:40:23,993
Don’t shout at this poor man.

1449
01:40:24,216 --> 01:40:26,822
If you’ve guts go and see what’s happening inside.

1450
01:40:27,886 --> 01:40:30,833
Ok. I’m going to take risk.

1451
01:40:31,256 --> 01:40:32,792
But wait here. -Why?

1452
01:40:33,425 --> 01:40:35,132
Otherwise snake will kiss.

1453
01:40:37,596 --> 01:40:39,803
Janvi. -Veer, how is
— Vidya’s father.

1454
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,368
He got worse after seeing me.

1455
01:40:42,601 --> 01:40:43,841
What? -What are you
— doing outside?

1456
01:40:44,803 --> 01:40:45,941
Where is prem?

1457
01:40:46,171 --> 01:40:48,378
I thought he was with you.
-He’s not with me.

1458
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,911
If not with you, where is Prem?

1459
01:40:51,476 --> 01:40:54,821
‘You’re Prem Chopra’.

1460
01:41:47,532 --> 01:41:49,842
Veer! - Veer!

1461
01:41:50,535 --> 01:41:53,277
Veer! -Br, what happened?

1462
01:41:53,705 --> 01:41:55,548
This Prem Chopra..

1463
01:41:55,907 --> 01:41:58,444
..hugged me thinking IwasVidya.-What?

1464
01:41:58,710 --> 01:42:01,520
No. -You’re blinded by his friendship.

1465
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:04,683
Actaully he wants Vidya.

1466
01:42:04,850 --> 01:42:06,887
Brother. -Bloody rapist.

1467
01:42:07,586 --> 01:42:09,327
Mr. Dharam, he’s not a rapist.

1468
01:42:10,288 --> 01:42:13,599
He.. he has disease of sleep walking.

1469
01:42:14,659 --> 01:42:17,401
Yes, brother. His panic attack..

1470
01:42:18,230 --> 01:42:19,607
I mean, this is its
— side effects. —

1471
01:42:23,535 --> 01:42:25,537
Look, he’s walking in sleep.

1472
01:42:29,207 --> 01:42:30,481
I'll check.

1473
01:42:30,742 --> 01:42:32,847
..when this knife will go in his stomach..

1474
01:42:33,412 --> 01:42:35,517
..and come out of his back
-No, Mr. Dharam.—J

1475
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:37,560
I’ll see if he’s sleep walking..

1476
01:42:37,949 --> 01:42:39,360
..or something else. -Brother.

1477
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,625
I knew it.

1478
01:42:44,389 --> 01:42:46,130
Brother, listen to me.

1479
01:42:46,191 --> 01:42:48,364
Brother, this is side effect
of panic attack.

1480
01:42:53,799 --> 01:42:55,369
Thief.

1481

Don’t go inside. Gentlemen
Dhondu.

1483
01:43:03,208 --> 01:43:05,484
Start the tempo.

1484
01:43:07,612 --> 01:43:09,717
Start. -What happened?

1485
01:43:10,382 --> 01:43:11,952
start.

1486
01:43:21,426 --> 01:43:23,463
Why did you stop? Drive, Dhondu.

1487
01:43:23,528 --> 01:43:26,737
You’re saying to drive. But
— nobody is behind us.

1488
01:43:27,265 --> 01:43:28,676
You’ve made me mad. -Nobody.

1489
01:43:28,867 --> 01:43:31,643
Yes. Don’t laugh.

1490
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:34,741
Dondu -What? - just chill.

01:43:42,547 --> 01:43:45,528
That.- Dondu -What?

1495
01:43:48,987 --> 01:43:51,934
I go to teach Vasudha as you.

1496
01:43:52,624 --> 01:43:54,729
And what I say as you, she
thinks I’m saying it.

1497
01:43:54,893 --> 01:43:57,237
I say it.;0]

1498
01:43:57,529 --> 01:43:59,202
But that's me.

1499

And you’re me. I mean I’m you.

01:44:19,918 --> 01:44:22,262
..my diesel is getting over.

1505
01:44:22,954 --> 01:44:24,490
Who is the new character

1506
01:44:25,724 --> 01:44:27,567
It's beacuase of that mad man..

1507
01:44:27,792 --> 01:44:30,568
Don’t shout, Dhondu, just chiII.

1508
01:44:30,795 --> 01:44:33,241

Don't shout.

1513
01:44:42,908 --> 01:44:44,979
Yes? - What?

1514
01:44:45,443 --> 01:44:46,683
Are you scared?

1515
01:44:46,745 --> 01:44:49,453
They got scared when
•I shouted, Raghu.

1516
01:44:52,984 --> 01:44:55,260
Why are you scared, Dhondu.

1517
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:59,325
You’re standing as
— if behind me..

1518
01:45:00,492 --> 01:45:02,836
You’re standing as if behind me, he’s.

1519
01:45:04,229 --> 01:45:06,709
You’re standing as if behind me, he’s.

01:45:08,833 --> 01:45:10,540
Let me see.

1521
01:45:11,436 --> 01:45:12,915
Dhondu, get the tern po.

1522
01:45:13,405 --> 01:45:15,817
Raghu, my brother. My friend.

1523
01:45:16,308 --> 01:45:19,380
Come. Let's drink tea.

1524
01:45:20,779 --> 01:45:22,554
Brother, you know.. -Veer.

1525
01:45:23,848 --> 01:45:26,886
Driving away mad man can’t
cure his madness.

1526
01:45:27,852 --> 01:45:29,889
We shout explain to
him. -Correct.

1527
01:45:30,121 --> 01:45:31,828
Brother, he’s totally mad.

1528
01:45:32,591 --> 01:45:34,127

1529

01:45:42,667 --> 01:45:43,941
Don't leave me alone.

1532
01:45:50,342 --> 01:45:51,980
Raghu, how many spoons?

1533
01:45:52,577 --> 01:45:54,454
There is only one spoon. Give 2 spoonsful sugar.

1534
01:45:57,616 --> 01:45:58,924
Raghu.

1535
01:45:59,284 --> 01:46:01,457
Have you read Geeta? -Never.

1536
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:02,958
Never. -I’ll tell you.

1537
01:46:04,789 --> 01:46:06,700
What have you got? -Tempo.

1538
01:46:06,992 --> 01:46:08,994
Right. It has my luggage.
-It’s mine.

1539
01:46:10,462 --> 01:46:11,532
I’m talking about knowledge.

1540
01:46:13,898 --> 01:46:15,275
KnowIedge.

1541
01:46:16,901 --> 01:46:17,902
Ok, repeat.

1542
01:46:19,504 --> 01:46:20,642
Look, Raghu..

1543
01:46:21,673 --> 01:46:22,777
..in Geeta it's written.

1544
01:46:25,277 --> 01:46:27,450
..what was yours yesterday

1545
01:46:28,913 --> 01:46:31,359

Got it.

1547
01:46:32,517 --> 01:46:35,396
It’s not so, silly.

1548
01:46:35,787 --> 01:46:37,198
Don't look there. - Listen to me.

1549
01:46:37,489 --> 01:46:40,265
What was yours yesterday
is mine today.

1550
01:46:40,325 --> 01:46:42,396
And it'll be mine.

1551
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:45,464
..do you understand, kid.

1552
01:46:46,331 --> 01:46:48,368
It’s simple. Prem.

1553
01:46:49,801 --> 01:46:51,439
What is it? -Take it easy.

1554
01:46:51,970 --> 01:46:53,711
Take it easy. I’ll expIain.

1555
01:46:55,407 --> 01:46:57,944
Look, even daughter belongs
to someone else.

1556
01:46:58,843 --> 01:46:59,947
She has to go one day.

1557
01:47:00,812 --> 01:47:01,950
That’s why I say..

1558
01:47:02,714 --> 01:47:04,990

Wrong.

What was yours is mine now..

1562
01:47:13,725 --> 01:47:15,671
..and it'll be mine.

1563
01:47:15,727 --> 01:47:17,434
Mad. - Fool.

1564
01:47:18,263 --> 01:47:19,469
Are you crazy?

1565
01:47:19,931 --> 01:47:23,378
Move, mad. Are you crazy?

1566
01:47:23,568 --> 01:47:25,570
What was yours is mine now..

1567
01:47:25,637 --> 01:47:26,843
..and it'll be mine.

1568
01:47:26,905 --> 01:47:28,248
No. - No.

1569
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:29,885
Dhondu, save him.

1570
01:47:29,941 --> 01:47:31,852
Stop. Wait. Should I get..

1571
01:47:31,910 --> 01:47:33,514
..the Iuggage.

1572
01:47:33,578 --> 01:47:36,218
Don't hit that kid.Talk to me.

1573
01:47:36,481 --> 01:47:38,552
He’s hitting us. -Get out.

1574
01:47:40,452 --> 01:47:42,398
For the first time death isn’t
moving towards us..

1575
01:47:42,754 --> 01:47:43,892
..but we’re moving towards death.

1576
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:46,830
Why are you driving so sIowIy?

1577
01:47:47,225 --> 01:47:49,569
We’ve no money. What will we say to Tobu?

1578
01:47:49,627 --> 01:47:51,698
I'm here. Don't be tense.

1579
01:47:51,763 --> 01:47:53,606
I’m tense as you’re
here. -Relax.

1580
01:47:53,932 --> 01:47:56,538
Stop.

1581
01:48:00,405 --> 01:48:01,645
Tobu, please forgive us.

1582
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:03,877
We tried a lot, but we couIdn’t
arrange the money.

1583
01:48:04,376 --> 01:48:06,356
Please Veer.

1584
01:48:06,778 --> 01:48:09,349
Let me talk. - Tobu come.

1585
01:48:11,216 --> 01:48:13,423
We’ve no money, but..

1586
01:48:14,386 --> 01:48:16,332
..we’ve something to make
you our debtors.

1587
01:48:18,456 --> 01:48:20,458
Expect the unexpected.

1588
01:48:22,293 --> 01:48:23,431
Move.

1589
01:48:24,462 --> 01:48:26,669
This is royal gift for
— king of Losoto.

1590
01:48:27,332 --> 01:48:28,470
Prem.

1591
01:48:28,933 --> 01:48:30,378
You stole king’s gift.

1592
01:48:30,435 --> 01:48:32,847
What will brother say? -Veer.

1593
01:48:33,872 --> 01:48:35,647
You want to see this gift
• in king’s treasure..

1594
01:48:36,408 --> 01:48:38,183
on our Iders

1595
01:48:39,844 --> 01:48:41,152
Head.

1596
01:48:51,956 --> 01:48:54,459
Diamonds, gems.

1597
01:48:54,526 --> 01:48:56,938
Pearl harbour. Black Diamond.

1598
01:48:57,395 --> 01:49:00,968
Treasure. Everything.

1599
01:49:06,604 --> 01:49:08,641
Brother Prem says so you
don’t need to ask.

1600
01:49:08,807 --> 01:49:10,616
Everything is in it. Open it.

1601
01:49:29,527 --> 01:49:30,835
It’s lemon pickle.

1602
01:49:34,165 --> 01:49:35,701
It’s not pickIe.

1603
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:37,345
Does anyone give pickle
asgiftto king?

1604
01:49:37,402 --> 01:49:39,404
It must’ve hidden diamonds
to evade customs.

1605
01:49:39,637 --> 01:49:41,742
He’s right. This belongs
to my brother.

1606
01:49:53,418 --> 01:49:54,658
This isn’t lemon pickle.

1607
01:49:55,253 --> 01:49:56,323
I said so.

1608
01:49:56,754 --> 01:49:57,892
It has carrot and raddish too.

1609
01:50:03,228 --> 01:50:04,798
Tabu says pickle is nice.

1610
01:50:04,929 --> 01:50:06,806
It would’ve been better if you’d brought bread too.

1611
01:50:06,965 --> 01:50:09,502
Not bread. We’ll chop you.

1612
01:50:13,671 --> 01:50:14,911
Tobu says..

1613
01:50:15,573 --> 01:50:18,782
..if you don’t give money
within 2 days..

1614
01:50:18,843 --> 01:50:21,722
..we’ll seize your bungalow
worth millions.

1615
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:24,483
And for fooling us with pickle..

1616
01:50:24,749 --> 01:50:27,423
..we’II punish you now.

1617
01:50:28,553 --> 01:50:29,759
Tobu is very wicked.

1618
01:50:30,588 --> 01:50:31,828
He took our clothes too.

1619
01:50:33,258 --> 01:50:35,295
It’s because of your foolishness. -What?

1620
01:50:35,693 --> 01:50:36,763
Mine? - Yes.

1621
01:50:36,828 --> 01:50:39,536
He bought cheap shirts
and trousers.

1622
01:50:39,864 --> 01:50:41,002
Wefooled him of million
of rupees.

1623
01:50:41,232 --> 01:50:42,370
What are you doing here?

1624
01:50:42,834 --> 01:50:44,245
Sorry. -Run away.

1625
01:50:46,704 --> 01:50:48,809
It’s not about money, but your judgement.

1626
01:50:49,908 --> 01:50:51,387
Because of your creative ideas..

1627
01:50:51,676 --> 01:50:53,952
..there are more problems
in my life.

1628
01:50:54,412 --> 01:50:55,823
Was your dad photographer. -Why?

1629
01:50:57,315 --> 01:50:58,760
You always think so negative.

1630
01:50:59,317 --> 01:51:00,557
Don't be tense. - I'm here.

1631
01:51:00,752 --> 01:51:02,254
I’ve many creative ideas.

1632
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:03,731
I don't care.

1633
01:51:05,757 --> 01:51:07,361
Why are you barking?

1634
01:51:07,625 --> 01:51:08,695
Dharam is there.

1635
01:51:08,927 --> 01:51:10,702
..who isn’t going to Losoto.

1636
01:51:11,229 --> 01:51:13,573
Tobu has exposed our shorts.

1637
01:51:13,965 --> 01:51:15,273
And now you’re barking.

1638
01:51:15,667 --> 01:51:17,840
Dog, you’re barking from
inside the car..

1639
01:51:17,902 --> 01:51:20,883
..I’II come in and whack you.

1640
01:51:27,178 --> 01:51:28,657
Run, Veer.

1641
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,655
You run. - You have teased him.

1642
01:51:38,556 --> 01:51:40,229
Can you believe it, Mrs. Lobo?

1643
01:51:40,692 --> 01:51:43,434
These days a person known
as Rapist Ranga..

1644
01:51:43,695 --> 01:51:46,904
..is raping beautiful girl becoming half naked.

1645
01:51:47,332 --> 01:51:48,868
Beautiful girls. -Yes.

1646
01:51:48,933 --> 01:51:51,641
Then we must take care.
-Yes. -Show me.

1647
01:51:51,936 --> 01:51:53,210
Yes.

1648
01:51:57,408 --> 01:51:59,319
Ranga. -Half naked.

1649
01:51:59,377 --> 01:52:01,357
Run. -HeIp.

1650
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:07,361
Save Us.

1651
01:52:15,927 --> 01:52:18,203
Help me. -Someone help us.

1652
01:52:19,864 --> 01:52:23,311
Rapist. -Help us.

1653
01:52:32,644 --> 01:52:33,748
Hello, sir. -Please.

1654
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:38,688
Mary, you’re a girI.

1655
01:52:39,550 --> 01:52:41,325
Like a family member.
-Thank you, sir.

1656
01:52:41,486 --> 01:52:42,624
That’s why I say..

1657
01:52:43,421 --> 01:52:45,458
..from today you’ll sleep
in my bedroom..

1658
01:52:45,523 --> 01:52:46,763
..and I’ll be in your .bedroom. -We..

1659
01:52:48,192 --> 01:52:49,865
He’s saying..

1660
01:52:51,262 --> 01:52:52,400
I’d to say it.

1661
01:52:53,264 --> 01:52:55,244
Because ‘Prem’(Iove) is between us.

1662
01:52:55,833 --> 01:52:58,245
What? - Love between us.

1663
01:52:58,836 --> 01:53:00,543
Sir, I’m a servant.

1664
01:53:00,772 --> 01:53:02,615
Prem. - Prem.

1665
01:53:03,775 --> 01:53:05,186
..doesn’t differentiate between rich and poor.

1666
01:53:05,777 --> 01:53:07,017
He can befall on anyone.

1667
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:12,621
So now you’ll be in my bedroom.

1668
01:53:12,884 --> 01:53:14,488
Is that clear? - Yes.

1669
01:53:24,028 --> 01:53:25,302
Hello, Veer.

1670
01:53:25,730 --> 01:53:28,472
Now Mary will give you your pocket money.

1671
01:53:28,733 --> 01:53:29,973
What? Our Mary.

1672
01:53:30,535 --> 01:53:32,173
Now she’s not our Mary.

1673
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:33,847
She's madam from maid.

1674
01:53:34,505 --> 01:53:37,816
Your brother will be with Mary tonight.

1675
01:53:38,009 --> 01:53:40,250
I’ve no time to Iisten
•to your rubbish!

1676
01:53:40,778 --> 01:53:41,984
I’m going to change.

1677
01:53:43,514 --> 01:53:44,652
He's shocked.

1678
01:53:44,882 --> 01:53:46,953
He doesn’t know he’s not
wearing anything.

1679
01:53:48,252 --> 01:53:49,322
What will he change?

1680
01:53:49,787 --> 01:53:52,461
Prem, saw the result of your third class idea.

1681
01:53:52,857 --> 01:53:54,837
You’re roaming in city half naked.

1682
01:53:55,526 --> 01:53:56,698
And you started stealing too.

1683
01:53:56,961 --> 01:53:58,201
First Mr. Dharam's watch.

1684
01:53:58,463 --> 01:54:00,340
Then king’s royal gift.

1685
01:54:00,698 --> 01:54:02,439
Not royal, it had pickle.

1686
01:54:02,834 --> 01:54:03,938
You don’t have to yell at me.

1687
01:54:04,368 --> 01:54:07,042
You said that we should
do this for Veer.

1688
01:54:07,271 --> 01:54:08,375
And..

1689
01:54:09,774 --> 01:54:11,583
Janvi- It's same.

1690
01:54:16,547 --> 01:54:17,924
Prem, stop.

1691
01:54:18,349 --> 01:54:20,056
Veer.

1692
01:54:20,551 --> 01:54:21,586
What happened?

1693
01:54:22,253 --> 01:54:23,288
What happened?

1694
01:54:23,621 --> 01:54:25,601
Prem fled with Vidya.

1695
01:54:25,823 --> 01:54:26,927
Get the car.

1696
01:54:27,458 --> 01:54:28,664
He took the car.

1697
01:54:31,829 --> 01:54:32,864
Come.

1698
01:54:33,464 --> 01:54:35,307
What are you doing?

1699
01:54:44,575 --> 01:54:45,645
Dhondu.

1700
01:54:48,946 --> 01:54:50,391
What is this?

1701
01:54:55,486 --> 01:54:56,988
Prem, tell him.

1702
01:55:12,303 --> 01:55:14,305
He broke it.

1703
01:55:20,478 --> 01:55:22,287
Drive properIy.

1704
01:55:22,346 --> 01:55:23,620
Drive sIowIy.

1705
01:55:28,419 --> 01:55:30,160
Dhondu, stop.

1706
01:55:31,255 --> 01:55:32,359
Dhondu.

1707
01:55:35,259 --> 01:55:37,205
Dhondu, stop.

1708
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:45,312
Dhondu, chair.

1709
01:55:46,671 --> 01:55:48,708
Shut up. -I didn’tsayaword.

1710
01:55:50,474 --> 01:55:51,680
Dhondu.

1711
01:55:55,813 --> 01:55:58,020
Raghu, chill.

1712
01:55:58,616 --> 01:56:01,222
Dhondu.

1713
01:56:12,296 --> 01:56:16,767
I’m ruined. My Meena
•is in this hospital. •

1714
01:56:16,834 --> 01:56:17,812
Meena.

1715
01:56:27,178 --> 01:56:28,623
What happened to Janvi?
-I don’t know.

1716
01:56:29,013 --> 01:56:30,993
He famed while talking. -Prem.

1717
01:56:40,825 --> 01:56:42,395
Prem, this time you’ve
gone too far.

1718
01:56:42,927 --> 01:56:44,235
Actually, brother..

1719
01:56:44,428 --> 01:56:45,907
.Vidya got seriousIy
ill suddenly.

1720
01:56:46,397 --> 01:56:47,671
So prem.

1721
01:56:47,732 --> 01:56:49,609
Vidya was ill so..

1722
01:56:49,667 --> 01:56:50,873
..he should have told us.

1723
01:56:51,535 --> 01:56:52,707
How dare you touch her!

1724
01:56:53,004 --> 01:56:54,745
Congrats, she’s pregnant.

1725
01:57:29,473 --> 01:57:32,750
Why is it so peaceful here?

1726
01:57:34,679 --> 01:57:39,560
Why am I dumb-struck?

1727
01:57:40,985 --> 01:57:43,261
What has happened..

1728
01:57:44,021 --> 01:57:46,262
..even the season is new.

1729
01:57:46,657 --> 01:57:51,504
The earth and sky is
filled with joy.

1730
01:58:05,509 --> 01:58:08,956
Why is it so peaceful here?

1731
01:58:10,681 --> 01:58:15,255
Why am I dumb-struck?

1732
01:58:17,021 --> 01:58:19,433
What has happened..

1733
01:58:20,057 --> 01:58:22,401
..even the season is new.

1734
01:58:22,727 --> 01:58:27,267
The earth and sky is
filled with joy.

1735
01:58:27,565 --> 01:58:33,413
The ambience is new.

1736
01:58:33,971 --> 01:58:39,649
happened, how Wh1d I tell you? —

1737
01:58:39,977 --> 01:58:45,518
The ambience is new.

1738
01:58:45,983 --> 01:58:51,990
happened, how Wh1d I tell you? —

1739
01:59:17,548 --> 01:59:21,860
I never thought..

1740
01:59:22,686 --> 01:59:27,829
..joy will come with tears.

1741
01:59:29,593 --> 01:59:33,871
What are these moments.

1742
01:59:34,632 --> 01:59:39,741
..where we are afar even
though together?

1743
01:59:41,572 --> 01:59:44,746
WhyamIsoIoneIy?

1744
01:59:46,811 --> 01:59:51,351
Why do the world seem lonely?

1745
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:55,491
Everything it upside down.

1746
01:59:56,287 --> 01:59:58,426
What's the matter?

1747
01:59:58,823 --> 02:00:03,670
Life is cross with me.

1748
02:00:03,727 --> 02:00:09,700
The ambience is new.

1749
02:00:10,267 --> 02:00:15,717
happened, how Wh1d I tell you? —

1750
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:21,722
The ambience is new.

1751

happened, how Wh1d I tell you? —

1752
02:00:56,347 --> 02:00:57,553
Thank God for..

1753
02:00:58,949 --> 02:01:00,553
..not sending friends with price tag.

1754
02:01:02,553 --> 02:01:04,396
Or I wouldn’t have been able
to afford you, friend.

1755
02:01:05,422 --> 02:01:06,628
You’re very priceless.

1756
02:01:09,026 --> 02:01:10,664
Now you’re talking sense.

1757
02:01:15,432 --> 02:01:16,638
I’m sorry.

1758
02:01:18,736 --> 02:01:20,716
For what?-You know

1759
02:01:22,606 --> 02:01:25,018
I’ve decided to tell brother the truth.

1760
02:01:25,576 --> 02:01:26,816
What are you saying, Veer?

1761
02:01:27,278 --> 02:01:28,586
I’m right, Janvi.

1762
02:01:28,646 --> 02:01:31,786
I mean, is it worth it? My friend, my sister-in-law..

1763
02:01:32,650 --> 02:01:34,596
..can’t enjoy important
joy of life.

1764
02:01:35,252 --> 02:01:36,560
I don’t care for such money.

1765
02:01:37,421 --> 02:01:38,957
You did so much for us.

1766
02:01:39,023 --> 02:01:41,469
This time.. -But this lie is proving costly now.

1767
02:01:42,359 --> 02:01:43,599
And what you’re doing is..

1768
02:01:43,827 --> 02:01:45,864
..can’t be repaid by me.

1769
02:01:46,931 --> 02:01:51,641
Favor. Repay. Such words
shouldn’t come between friendsi

1770
02:01:52,303 --> 02:01:53,407
That’s right, Prem.

1771
02:01:53,637 --> 02:01:55,378
We think of other’s benefit
in friendship.

1772
02:01:55,606 --> 02:01:57,813
Not taken advantage of. -Veer.

1773
02:02:05,416 --> 02:02:07,020
It’s all over. I’m going.

1774
02:02:07,618 --> 02:02:10,030
Mr. Dharam, you found out. -Yes.

1775
02:02:11,555 --> 02:02:13,000
Chautala, told me everything. -Yes.

1776
02:02:13,924 --> 02:02:16,803
Veer was going to tell you what Chautala told you.

1777
02:02:18,262 --> 02:02:20,037
Yes, brother. Forgive me.

1778
02:02:20,598 --> 02:02:22,407
I'd erred!- Err?

1779
02:02:23,667 --> 02:02:25,613
My flight to Losoto is resumed..

1780
02:02:25,836 --> 02:02:26,871
..so what’s your fault?

1781
02:02:29,206 --> 02:02:30,879
It’s his fault, brother.

1782
02:02:31,542 --> 02:02:33,351
He knew your flight is resumed.

1783
02:02:33,510 --> 02:02:35,285
But he wanted you to stay
for few more days.

1784
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:36,851
How sweet, Veer!

1785
02:02:37,448 --> 02:02:41,658
Chautala, book a ticket
• after 2 days.. -No.

1786
02:02:42,186 --> 02:02:43,756
No.

1787
02:02:44,722 --> 02:02:45,894
It’s important for him to Ieave.

1788
02:02:46,657 --> 02:02:49,297
Control your emotion,
• not your brother.

1789
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:50,764
Control.

1790
02:02:52,529 --> 02:02:53,701
Have a safe journey.

1791
02:02:55,566 --> 02:02:57,546
Come, sir. It’s time]
— forthe flight.

1792
02:02:58,402 --> 02:03:01,781
That’s ok. But I can’t
— go without gift.

1793
02:03:02,573 --> 02:03:05,019
Mary. -Sir. -Did you
— seethatgift?

1794

1795
02:03:07,578 --> 02:03:08,989
That treasure box type? -Yes.

1796
02:03:09,213 --> 02:03:11,022
Rectangular shape?
-l didn’t see it.

1797
02:03:11,815 --> 02:03:13,761
Mr. Dharam, that day
a thief came..

1798
02:03:14,051 --> 02:03:15,758
..and might have stolen
your gift

1799
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:17,756
Yes, it must be very expensive.

1800
02:03:18,055 --> 02:03:19,295
Diamonds.

1801
02:03:19,723 --> 02:03:21,999
Let’s go to police to lodge a complain.

1802
02:03:22,059 --> 02:03:23,595
We’ll get the thief caught. -No.

1803
02:03:24,061 --> 02:03:25,972
It’s important for me]
to go to Losoto.

1804
02:03:26,363 --> 02:03:29,401
Correct. -Take another gift.

1805
02:03:29,667 --> 02:03:32,011
Here. This will solve
• your problems.

1806
02:03:48,786 --> 02:03:49,958
Who are they?

1807
02:03:50,821 --> 02:03:52,994
Didn’t you recognize them?
They collect donations.

1808
02:03:55,259 --> 02:03:56,431
Hey, what is it?

1809
02:03:57,594 --> 02:03:59,665
Corect the question?
—Ask who they’re?—’

1810
02:03:59,830 --> 02:04:01,571
He’s Tobu. Remember, GPL.

1811
02:04:01,765 --> 02:04:03,870
He’s head boy of GPL. He’s dumb.

1812
02:04:09,506 --> 02:04:11,349
Tobu says when wiII
— you pay5lakh.

1813
02:04:11,975 --> 02:04:13,477
5 Lakh.

1814
02:04:13,544 --> 02:04:16,650
Hey, are you demanding donation
or extortion money.

1815
02:04:24,621 --> 02:04:25,725
All the best.

1816
02:04:39,269 --> 02:04:41,647
Go away. I’ll pay letter. Go.

1817
02:04:43,607 --> 02:04:44,881
Go. We will come.

1818
02:04:52,049 --> 02:04:53,357
.Brother.

1819
02:05:20,978 --> 02:05:22,389
Tobu says..

1820
02:05:24,515 --> 02:05:26,688
..Tobu creates war..

1821
02:05:29,353 --> 02:05:30,798
Tobu says..

1822
02:05:31,622 --> 02:05:33,932

1823
02:05:34,591 --> 02:05:36,571
Tobu says..

1824
02:05:38,695 --> 02:05:39,833
Tobu can speak.

1825
02:05:39,897 --> 02:05:41,535
Tobu can speak. GoIi.

1826
02:05:42,966 --> 02:05:44,445

1828
02:05:46,437 --> 02:05:47,677
Tobu can speak.

1829
02:05:48,005 --> 02:05:52,852
Sage! You’re a sage.

1830
02:05:54,511 --> 02:05:56,616
Your slap has magic.

1831
02:05:56,980 --> 02:06:00,257
You can make someone deaf
•or give voice to someone.

1832
02:06:00,717 --> 02:06:04,255
Sage, you’re great.

1833
02:06:04,321 --> 02:06:05,994
You're God! -Powerfull

1834
02:06:06,323 --> 02:06:07,927
You’re everything.

1835
02:06:08,525 --> 02:06:10,732
Sage. -How much wiII
•you say in a day?

1836
02:06:10,961 --> 02:06:13,373
I was dumb. Let me talk today.

1837
02:06:14,665 --> 02:06:16,770
One slap cured me.

1838
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,707
I can speak.

1839
02:06:18,769 --> 02:06:23,275
My sage has worked magic.

1840
02:06:23,807 --> 02:06:25,753
Tobu can speak.

1841
02:06:25,976 --> 02:06:28,456
I waived your loan of 5 lakh.

1842
02:06:28,645 --> 02:06:29,885
Which loan?

1843
02:06:30,981 --> 02:06:32,790
Acutally.. -Let me talk, sage.

1844
02:06:33,283 --> 02:06:35,854
Sage, I can talk. Let me taIk.

1845
02:06:36,019 --> 02:06:38,465
They came to me to
— bet on car race. —

1846
02:06:38,522 --> 02:06:40,297
They took 5 Iakhs from me.

1847
02:06:40,591 --> 02:06:41,865
But they lost.

1848
02:06:42,526 --> 02:06:45,473
It was good. We got to meet.

1849
02:06:45,863 --> 02:06:48,469
You returned my voice..

1850
02:06:48,532 --> 02:06:50,512
..what can I give in return?

1851
02:06:50,734 --> 02:06:52,372
What can I give you, sage?

1852
02:06:52,436 --> 02:06:54,347
But I want to give you something.

1853
02:06:55,005 --> 02:06:59,454
Sage, take this Rolex from me.

1856
02:07:04,248 --> 02:07:06,751
Sage, don’t ask me about
other watches.

1857
02:07:07,050 --> 02:07:08,961
It has all the quaIities.

1858
02:07:09,353 --> 02:07:10,525
Sage.

1859

Sage, they gave me this gift.

1860
02:07:14,758 --> 02:07:16,567
I returned it to you.

1861
02:07:20,297 --> 02:07:21,776
First installment of loan.

1862

02:08:16,053 --> 02:08:18,693
Save me from bullets.

1877
02:08:25,462 --> 02:08:27,703

Who threw stones?

1882
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:38,251
It’s not stone, but buIIets.

1883

That’s what I said. Who

How can this dead man
— kill someone else?

1915
02:10:56,947 --> 02:10:59,553
Are you ghost?

1916

answer my phone.

1918
02:11:06,323 --> 02:11:07,996
I was getting worried.

1919
02:11:08,458 --> 02:11:10,404
I thought Veer eloped
with Vidya..

1920
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:11,564
..and got married.

1921
02:11:11,628 --> 02:11:13,301
Hey! What are you saying?

1922
02:11:13,964 --> 02:11:15,875
Veer and Vidya ar already married.

1923
02:11:15,932 --> 02:11:18,037
No.It can't be.

1924
02:11:18,268 --> 02:11:20,270
No, dad. -You can’t
— do this, Vidya.

1925
02:11:20,337 --> 02:11:22,578
Fool, she’s Vidya.

1926
02:11:23,573 --> 02:11:26,417
I’m his dad. She’sI my daughter Vidya

Veer’s girl friend. -What

1930

You’re a girl friend of a married man.

1931
02:11:33,350 --> 02:11:34,693
No, Veer isn’t married.

1932
02:11:34,751 --> 02:11:36,526
